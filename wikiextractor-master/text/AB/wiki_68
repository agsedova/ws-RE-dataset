{"id": "2001740", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2001740", "title": "Cyrille Guimard", "text": "Cyrille Guimard\n\nCyrille Guimard (born 20 January 1947) is a French former professional road racing cyclist who became a directeur sportif and then a television commentator. Three of his riders, Bernard Hinault, Laurent Fignon, and Lucien Van Impe, won the Tour de France. Another protege of Guimard's, Greg LeMond, described him as \"the best (coach) in the world\" and \"the best coach I ever had\". He has been described by cycling journalist William Fotheringham as the greatest directeur sportif in the history of the Tour.\n\nBorn in Bouguenais, Loire-Atlantique, Guimard rode as a junior, an amateur and a professional, on the road, track and in cyclo-cross. He was national champion in all three forms: road in 1967 as an amateur, track sprint in 1970 and cyclo-cross in 1976. The riders ahead of him in the 1970 and 1971 professional road championships were disqualified and the titles not given. He said: \"After those in front of me were disqualified for failing the drugs test, the federation never had the idea of giving me the titles.\". Guimard was then president of the riders' union (see below) and the resentment that that created was why he was not named champion, he said, while others in the same position had been.\n\nGuimard was a sprinter who won nearly 100 races in eight seasons. He won stages of the Tour de France in 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973 and 1974 – four of them in 1972 – although he finished the race only twice. He came 62nd in 1970 and seventh in 1971, the only year in which he didn't win a stage. He wore the green jersey of leader of the points competition in 1972 and won the combativity award in the 1972. He also won the points competition of the Vuelta a España and the Six-Days of Grenoble in 1972.\n\nGuimard's most striking Tour de France was in 1972, when he wore the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification and matched Eddy Merckx in the mountains. Fighting to keep the lead on long climbs created pain in his knees, one of which he injured in 1969 in an accident with a car while he was training. Merckx won two stages in the Alps and Guimard the next. Merckx tried to dispose of him on a 28 km stage to Mont Revard but Guimard, instead of cracking, won by 10 cm as the Belgian raised his hands thinking he had won.\n\nGuimard was in second place and leading the points competition two days from the finish in Paris when he was forced to withdraw. Merckx gave his green points jersey to Guimard on the podium in Paris.\n\nThere were concerns about Guimard's treatment during the race, and reports that he had to be carried to his bike each morning because he could no longer walk. The team official caring for him was Bernard Sainz, sentenced to three years in 2008 for doping athletes and practising as an unqualified doctor. Sainz was sentenced to be jailed for the first half of the sentence and to be released on probation for the rest. He produced no evidence of medical training at his trial. He wrote in his autobiography:\n\nThe two men met when Sainz was assistant manager of Gan, the team for which Guimard rode with Raymond Poulidor. Sainz was at Guimard's side throughout the 1972 Tour. In 1973, Guimard was caught in a drugs test at the end of the stage from Avignon to Montpellier.\nKnee pain ended Guimard's racing and he moved into team management.\n\nGuimard became a directeur sportif with the Gitane team, which included Bernard Hinault and Lucien Van Impe. It was run by the former national champion, Jean Stablinski. Guimard had just won the French cyclo-cross championship. He took over as main directeur sportif in 1976. Hinault was considering leaving the team but Guimard, who had ridden in the peloton with Hinault, convinced him to stay. Hinault said: \"Stablinski was a manager of the old school: 'Race and we'll talk about it later.' He gave me no advice at all, though he was decent enough. I would have been more impressed if he'd stuck to his word and not had me racing every race on the calendar. I wasn't a machine and he expected too much of me. But for Guimard, I might have joined up with Raymond Poulidor of the Mercier team and we'd never have got on. There'd have been wars between us and I'd have been off again, trying all the teams one by one, and wasting a lot of time. If you want to devote yourself to racing, you must find the right conditions and be able to get on with your colleagues. With Guimard I knew that things would improve and that we could agree on a programme. Guimard and I had a perfect understanding and realised most of our ambitions, even if we were to fall out later.\"\n\nIt was as directeur sportif that Guimard forged his reputation. He ran Gitane-Campagnolo, Renault-Elf-Gitane, Système U-Gitane, Super U, Castorama, and Cofidis; riders under his direction included Van Impe, Hinault, Laurent Fignon, Greg LeMond, Charly Mottet and Marc Madiot. Seven times his riders won the Tour de France. Said Van Impe:\nCyrille was one of the best directeurs sportifs that I ever met. Without him, I don't know if I would ever have won the Tour. Perhaps I would, but his way of talking to riders really lifted us. There's no one better for re-motivating a rider. As a manager, he always stayed a rider in the way he thought. That makes all the difference. He always knew when to go after a break or to let it go. And everything he predicted at the morning briefing came true later in the race. On the other hand, the moment the race was over he always wanted the last word... a real Breton! But Guimard is Guimard.\nIn the Saint Lary Soulan stage of the 1976 Tour de France Van Impe was following Joop Zoetemelk, calculating that the Dutchman would exhaust himself. He ignored the urgings of team assistants to go on the attack and said that if Guimard wanted him to ride differently then he was to say so himself. Guimard drove up alongside Van Impe and shouted that he'd run him off the road with his car if Van Impe didn't attack. Van Impe attacked, caught the riders ahead, put almost half the field outside the time limit and beat Zoetemelk by three minutes. In doing so he won the Tour. Said Hinault: \"With Guimard, you do not argue.\"\n\nHinault said Guimard insisted he plan his season and his career. \"He had no intention of taking on too much too early. Just as you plan your tactics before each race, so you should have a career strategy, too, at least for the first three or four years.\" Guimard told Hinault not to ride the Tour in 1977, even though he had won the Dauphiné Libéré and beaten the favourites for the Tour, Van Impe and Bernard Thévenet. Hinault rode in 1978 and won then and in four other years. In his autobiography, Hinault credited Guimard with an uncanny tactical sense that led to his greatest wins, including Liège–Bastogne–Liège of 1980.\n\nGuimard's personality led to disagreements with riders, notably with Hinault in the mid-1980s. Hinault did not enter the 1983 Tour de France due to a knee injury, and his teammate, Laurent Fignon, won the race. The following season Hinault left Guimard to ride for the new La Vie Claire team. Guimard had the previous year taken on a young American, Greg LeMond, whom he knew from his win in the world junior championship in 1979 and whose career he had followed. Negotiating a contract reported as setting new standards for what riders could expect to earn exhausted his fax machine, Guimard said. \"Americans are the kings of paperwork.\"\n\nGuimard was an ardent advocate of modern methods of rider preparation. LeMond described him as the first professional cycling coach to formally study physiology in order to apply it to rider training. He also took riders to the Equipe Renault Elf Formula One team's wind tunnel to perfect their positioning on the bike and maximise their aerodynamic efficiency. Guimard's wind tunnel work with Hinault led to the development of the Gitane Profil, the first bike to use teardrop-shaped tubes and handlebars, which Hinault claimed gained him one and a half seconds per mile in time trials, and he also experimented with internal cabling. His interest in aerodynamics also led to his teams introducing other innovations in bicycle design during the 1980s, including sloping bike frames and disc wheels. At the 1986 Tour de France, his rider Thierry Marie won the prologue by a quarter of a second with the aid of a \"lower back rest\" on his bicycle which functioned as an aileron to reduce aerodynamic drag, although the design was subsequently banned.\n\nGuimard was left without a team when Castorama dropped out of the sport at the end of 1995. He helped form the Cofidis team but left after a court case in 1997 in which he was accused of false accounting and of obtaining credit by false pretences. Guimard had been one of the founding directors of Siclor, a company set up in 1996 with 2.8 million francs of state aid to make bicycle frames. It collapsed in January 1997 with debts of 4.5 million francs. A court sentenced Guimard to a suspended jail sentence for \"abuse of social funds\" and Cofidis, a moneylending company, said: \"Given the personal difficulties that face Cyrille Guimard and the media risks that could unfairly bring to Cofidis, Cyrille Guimard and Cofidis have agreed to end their collaboration.\"\n\nIn 2003, Guimard became advisor and technical director of the French amateur cycling team Vélo Club Roubaix where he worked with the amateur Andy Schleck. In 2007, Vélo Club Roubaix Lille Metropole became a professional continental team with Guimard as manager. He remained with the team up to 2014.\n\nIn June 2017 Guimard was announced as the coach of the French national team. His successor, in 2019, was Thomas Voeckler.\n\nGuimard was president of the professional riders' body, the Union Nationale des Coureurs Professionels, when he was 23. He and another team manager, Roger Legeay, created the AIGCP, to represent teams in negotiations.\n\nGuimard failed to win election in 2009 as president of the Fédération Française de Cyclisme, the body representing France at the Union Cycliste Internationale. His campaign accused the federation's management of being clannish, eliminating those who did not please it and coopting those who did. He called for an audit of the federation's accounts. Professional riders, he said, should deposit a year of their salary as a suspended credit card payment, as potential payment for any doping offence.\n\nHe came third of the three candidates, with seven votes against the 347 for David Lappartient and 265 for Michel Callot.\n\nGuimard served as a member of the French Cycling Federation's executive for four years and as a member of its federal council for two years, but resigned from the latter body in December 2014 due to the Federation's failure to consult him on sporting matters.\n\n"}

(i.e. a \"package\" containing an image(s), subimages, symbols, labels, and text as well as other information related to the image(s)) NITFS supports the dissemination of secondary digital imagery from overhead collection platforms. \n\nGuidance on applying the suite of standards composing NITFS can be found in MIL-HDBK-1300A, National Imagery Transmission Format Standard (NITFS), 12 October 1994. The NITFS allows for Support Data Extensions (SDEs), which are a collection of data fields that provide space within the NITFS file structure for adding functionality. Documented and controlled separately from the NITFS suite of standards, SDEs extend NITF functionality with minimal impact on the underlying standard document. SDEs may be incorporated into an NITF file while maintaining backward compatibility because the identifier and byte count mechanisms allow applications developed prior to the addition of newly defined data to skip over extension fields they are not designed to interpret. These SDEs are described in the Compendium of Controlled Extensions (CE). This standard is mandated in the DoD for imagery product dissemination.\n\nNITF has been implemented and fielded since the early 1990s. Its content evolved over the years to embrace new technology in support of emerging operational requirements. NITF has adopted the ISO/IEC 15444-1 standard for imagery compression, JPEG 2000. Commercial implementations of the standard are largely driven by marketability to the DoD and IC.\n\nA follow-on update to the standard, Mil-Std-2500C, has been released.

It is characterized by slower tempo and rapping than usual, often combined with lyrics with sociopolitical content. The words \"Low Bap\" do not have a specific meaning; they merely represent a perspective on life, society and politics that people in the movement have. The Low Bap movement has been expanded, so that today it includes bookstores, youth centers and specialized magazines. Cinematic attempts, concerts, and festivals have also taken place in an effort to broaden the scope of the movement, and introduce new bands to the genre's range of followers.\n\nIn June 1992, during a live performance of Public Enemy in Nikaia, B.D. Foxmoor and MCD met each other and created one of the first Greek hip hop groups, Active Member. In 1995, hip hop music was not well known in Greece. Active Member attracted big discographic companies and signed up with the consortium Warner (Warner Music Group). A few months later, the third album of Active Member was produced, under the name \"To Megalo Kolpo\" (The Great Wangle), and became widely known. On that album, Active Member decided to rename hip hop as they had taken it in, thus naming it Low Bap.\n\n\"“Support your word with your life and vice versa”, or to make it short “you walk, you talk”: this is the path that leads to Low Bap. It is the new base of all that comprehend, think, feel, act and resist.

Ouellet is currently under contract to Ring of Honor (ROH), where he is a former ROH World Champion.\n\nOuellet is best known for his appearances with the World Wrestling Federation and World Championship Wrestling as one-half of The Quebecers/The Amazing French Canadians with Jacques Rougeau (with whom he held the WWF Tag Team Championship on three occasions). Other promotions Ouellet has wrestled for include Extreme Championship Wrestling, the International Wrestling Association, Major League Wrestling, and NWA Total Nonstop Action. After retiring in 2011, Ouellet returned to the ring in 2016, undergoing a career renaissance with the gimmick of \"part beast-turned-man, part old-time strongman\".\n\nCarl Ouellet debuted in 1987. He worked on the independent circuit - at one point forming a tag team with \"Evil\" Eddie Watts known as \"The Super Bees\".\n\nIn January 1993, Ouellet began wrestling for the International Wrestling Association in Puerto Rico. While working in Puerto Rico, he was offered a tryout with the World Wrestling Federation.\n\nIn 1993, Ouellet joined the World Wrestling Federation as the tag team partner of Jacques Rougeau. As one half of The Quebecers, Ouellet adopted the name \"Pierre\" and dressed like Mounties. This was a reference to Jacques's previous gimmick, \"The Mountie\", which had been banned in Canada out of fear that the heelish character of The Mountie would lead to children mistrusting legitimate Mounties. The Quebecers sang their own entrance theme, in which they stated that, contrary to appearances, \"We're not the Mounties\". Later in the year they were joined by manager, Johnny Polo.\n\nThe Quebecers held the WWF Tag Team Championship on three occasions. On September 13, 1993, they defeated the Steiner Brothers for the tag titles (under \"Province of Quebec Rules\", which provided for titles change hands on disqualifications). They were defeated by the 1-2-3 Kid and Marty Jannetty on January 10, 1994 and again by Men on a Mission on March 29 (during a tour of England) but each time regained the titles within days. They lost the belts a third and final time to The Headshrinkers on the April 26 episode of \"Monday Night Raw\" in Burlington, Vermont, which would soon lead to Pierre's sneak attack on Jacques. The feud culminated in the former partners' wrestling one another in Rougeau's retirement match on October 21, 1994 in Montreal, main-eventing a sold-out house show.\n\nAs a singles wrestler, Ouellet was repackaged in 1995 as \"Jean-Pierre LaFitte\", the descendant of real-life pirate named Jean LaFitte. As a pirate he wore an eyepatch over his blind right eye. He engaged in a three-month feud with Bret Hart and stole the mirrored sunglasses that Hart handed to fans at ringside. After LaFitte stole Hart's trademark leather jacket, the enemies faced one another at In Your House 3 on September 24, 1995, where Hart forced Ouellet to submit by using the Sharpshooter. In his \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\", Dave Meltzer described this pay-per-view match as the \"show saver\" and an \"excellent match.\" Hart later recalled, \"In a lot of ways, I loved working with guys like him. He was a guy, that when he threw you in the ropes, he really threw you in the rope...everything he did was power, and at the same time he was a very safe guy... He took a lot of pride in his work, he really wanted to have a great match with me...And so we worked really hard, and it was a really good match.\"\n\nOuellet's WWF career came to an end after an alleged legit conflict with The Kliq, a backstage group including main-event wrestlers Shawn Michaels and Diesel. According to Shane Douglas, who was working with the company at that time, a match pitting LaFitte against Nash, then the WWF Champion, in a house show in LaFitte's hometown Montreal was booked to end without a clean finish, with Lafitte winning by either DQ or countout, enabling the WWF to return to Montreal for a rematch at a later time. However, due to backstage politicking by Shawn Michaels the booking was reversed into a clean pinfall for Diesel. In turn, LaFitte refused to be pinned by Diesel and the match ended in a double-countout. Due to his refusal to put Diesel over, LaFitte was buried due to the Kliq's influence. Ouellet left the WWF in November 1995.\n\nIn 1996, Ouellet reunited with Jacques Rougeau and moved to World Championship Wrestling (WCW), where the duo was known as The Amazing French Canadians. They wore more traditional wrestling gear, but failed to duplicate the success they had found in the WWF. They had the distinction of losing to Arn Anderson and Steve \"Mongo\" McMichael in Anderson's last match.\n\nThe Amazing French Canadians were managed by Col. Robert Parker (who began dressing in a French Foreign Legion uniform), and they began feuding with Harlem Heat as a result of tension between Parker and Harlem Heat's manager, Sister Sherri. After Harlem Heat defeated the Amazing French Canadians at World War 3 on November 24, 1996, Sherri won the right to fight Parker for three minutes. Parker was beaten down by Sherri, but the rivals later reconciled and fell in love with one another.\n\nOuellet won a 'patch match' against The Giant in a house show in Montreal and was fired shortly after.\n\nAlong with Jacques, Ouellet was rehired by the WWF in 1998 yet again, but rarely utilized. Ouellet competed in the Brawl for All tournament, but lost in the first round to \"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams. The Quebecers took part in the tag team battle royal at WrestleMania XIV, but disbanded once again soon afterward. Along with other WWF employees such as Bart Gunn and Vader, he worked for All Japan Pro Wrestling as part of a talent loan, and spent time in the WWF's Memphis based developmental territory, Power Pro Wrestling, where he was known as \"Kris Kannonball\". He left the WWF once more when his contract expired in January 2000, unhappy with the way he was being used.\n\nOuellet began working for Extreme Championship Wrestling in mid-2000, squashing jobbers for several weeks before losing to Justin Credible in a match for Credible's ECW World Heavyweight Championship.\n\nOuellet and Rougeau had a second run in WCW in August 2000, briefly joining Team Canada at the New Blood Rising pay-per-view. Rougeau—who had additionally served as a guest referee in Lance Storm's win over Mike Awesome—left immediately afterwards, upset with the WCW creative team's plans for him, while Ouellet worked two more dates in Canada and was awarded the WCW Hardcore Championship by Storm on August 14 as Storm held three different titles at the same time. He lost the title that same night to Norman Smiley.\n\nDue to working visa issues, Ouellet could not work in the US, and had to be released back to Canada soon after.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2003, Ouellet appeared with Rougeau's International Wrestling 2000 promotion. He headlined an event in the Verdun Auditorium in Montreal on December 29, 2000, facing King Kong Bundy in front of an audience of 4,000. In the summer of 2003 Ouellet decided to begin wrestling in the Quebec area once more.\n\nOuellet returned to the Puerto Rican promotion International Wrestling Association, this time wrestling as Jean-Pierre Laffite. He was brought in by Savio Vega to join his stable, The Corporation. Immediately he feuded with then-IWA Intercontinental Champion Ricky Banderas, a feud that lasted around 3 months. He was managed by José Chaparro, another member of Vega's Corporation. At Summer Attitude, after a losing effort to Ricky Banderas. In April 2005 defeated Banderas to win IWA Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship for first time in his career. Lafitte left IWA.\n\nIn November 2003, Ouellet debuted in NWA Total Nonstop Action as \"X\", a masked wrestler who competed primarily in the X Division as he had a feud with Christopher Daniels and Sonjay Dutt. He left after two months. \n\nIn February 2005, Ouellet began hosting the French version of \"TNA Impact!\" from the RDS studios with Marc Blondin, replacing Michel Letourneur. He even had a war of the words against comedian Jean-René Dufort (of \"Infoman\" fame), to which Dufort responded by adopting the wrestling gimmick \"La Punaise Masquée\" (The Masked Tick) and \"challenging\" Ouellet to a match. However, Dufort backed out before the match could take place. In October 2007 he quit the company and was replaced by Sylvain Grenier.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, Ouellet wrestled for the Montreal-based International Wrestling Syndicate and the Hull-based CPW International promotion, under the \"Pierre Carl Ouellet\" name once again. In October 2007, Ouellet wrestled a dark match for World Wrestling Entertainment under the name of \"Carl Ouellet\" at the \"ECW\" / \"SmackDown!\" tapings. He was defeated by Tommy Dreamer.\n\nOuellet also wrestled for All-Star promotions in Britain alongside his friends and tag team partners with Rene Dupree. Ouellet has mainly been working a lot of Tag Team matches with Rene Dupree, Robbie Dynamite, Hannibal and Mikey Whiplash. He defeated Sylvain Grenier in an RDS battle on June 21, 2008 in Hawkesbury, Ontario Canada with Marc Blondin serving as the special referee. He then defeated long-time rival Kevin Nash on May 30, 2009 at the International Wrestling Syndicate's 10th Anniversary show by making him submit via an armbar. In an interview with \"Slam! Sports\" on August 6, 2008, Ouellet declared that he would like another stint with the WWE.\n\nOuellet retired from professional wrestling on February 8, 2011.\n\nOn May 21, 2016, Ouellet made his return to professional wrestling at an MWF event, entitled \"Collision,\" in Valleyfield, Quebec, Canada, defeating Jake Matthews, following a cannonball. On November 5, 2017, Ouellet, as \"Quebecer\" Jean-Pierre Lafitte, defeated Hannibal to win the Great North Wrestling Canadian Championship in Rockland, ON. On May 25, 2018, Ouellet was defeated by Hannibal via disqualification in a Great North Wrestling Championship rematch in Pembroke, ON. Post-match, Ouellet was stripped of the championship for his assault on GNW President, Michael Andrews. Under a new gimmick as a \"French Frankenstein\" as Ouellet described it, he became a regular name in several independent promotions. On April 2, 2018, Ouellet defeated Walter at Game Changer Wrestling's (GCW) Joey Janela's Spring Break 2 in New Orleans. Ouellet's performance and online footage of his unconventional workout regimen impressed the independent wrestling audience, and led to many higher-profile bookings.\n\nOn June 18, 2018, Ouellet was announced as the first of twenty-four participants for Pro Wrestling Guerrilla's (PWG) annual Battle of Los Angeles tournament. At \"2018 Battle of Los Angeles - Stage One\" on September 15, he made his company debut, losing to Brody King in the Opening Round. Two nights later, at \"2018 Battle of Los Angeles - Final Stage\", he led a losers' ten-man tag team match, in which Team PCO (Ouellet, Darby Allin, Dan Barry, Jody Fleisch and Puma King) defeated Team DJ Z (DJ Z, Adam Brooks, David Starr, T-Hawk and Timothy Thatcher).\n\nOn December 1, 2018, Ouellet announced his exclusive signing with Ring of Honor. He debuted for ROH at the December 15 tapings joining up with Marty Scurll and Brody King in a new stable called Villain Enterprises. At Honor Reigns Supreme 2019, Villain Enterprises defeated Silas Young and the Briscoe Brothers. PCO and King would then go on to win the 2019 ROH Tag Wars Tournament during the ROH Road To G1 Supercard tour in February 2019, and on March 15, 2019, he and King defeated the Briscoes to win the ROH World Tag Team Championship for the first time in a Las Vegas street fight at the ROH 17th Anniversary Show. The following night at the \"Ring of Honor Wrestling\" tapings, PCO, King and Scurll defeated The Kingdom to win the ROH World Six-Man Tag Team Championship, making PCO a double champion within a 24 hour span.\n\nAt the G1 Supercard, PCO and King dropped the ROH World Tag Team Championship to the Guerrillas of Destiny in a winner takes all four-way tag team match also including the Briscoe Brothers and Evil and Sanada, with G.O.D.'s IWGP Tag Team Championship belts also on the line. In a Six Man Tag title defence, PCO would get the winning fall over ROH World Champion Matt Taven, which gave him a future title opportunity.\n\nOn April 27 at the 2019 Crockett Cup event, PCO and King won the eight-team tournament (winning three matches in the same night) to not only win the Crockett Cup Trophy, but also win the vacant NWA World Tag Team Championship as well. At War of the Worlds, PCO challenged ROH World Champion Matt Taven for the championship, however he was defeated. The following night, PCO continued his feud with Taven by attacking Taven following his win over Mark Haskins. PCO would then compete in a Four Corner Survival match to determine the #1 contender for the ROH World Championship which was won by Jeff Cobb. At State of the Art, PCO competed in a DEFY or DENY match for the ROH World Championship which was won by Taven. At Death Before Dishonor XVII, PCO defeated Kenny King in a First round match in the Final Battle ROH World Championship #1 contender tournament. At Glory By Honor XVII, PCO defeated fellow member of Villain Enterprises Marty Scurll in the finals of the tournament to become the #1 contender for the ROH World Championship. At Final Battle, PCO defeated Rush to become the ROH World Champion, in the process once again becoming a double champion in ROH, as well as becoming a world champion for the first time in his career. After his title win, Villain Enterpraises feuded with Rush's La Facción Ingobernable, retaining the World title against Dragon Lee, but losing against Rush on February 29.\n\nOuellet lost vision in his right eye at the age of 12 after an accident with a pellet gun.\n\n\n"}

As such, it is a 'cousin' to the more infamous \"Latrodectus mactans\" (black widow).\n\n\"L. geometricus\" is slightly smaller and generally lighter in color than the black widow species; the color can range from tan to dark brown to black, with shades of grey also possible. Like the black widow species in the United States, \"L. geometricus\" has a prominent hourglass-shaped marking on the underside of the abdomen; the brown widow's hourglass, however, is usually a vivid orange or a yellowish color. Unlike the black widow, \"L. geometricus\" has a black-and-white geometric pattern on the dorsal side of its abdomen. Although the Latin name comes from this pattern, a spider's coloring can and does darken over time and the pattern may become obscured. Also, they have stripes on their legs. Brown widows are often preyed on by mud daubers and sometimes by digger wasps.\n\nBrown widows can be located by finding their egg sacs, which are easily identifiable. They resemble a sandspur, having pointed projections all over, and they are sometimes described as \"tufted\", \"fluffy\", or \"spiky\" in appearance. Eggs hatch in approximately 20 days. Female brown widows lay about 120–150 eggs per sac and can make 20 egg sacs over a lifetime.\n\nSimilar widows include the \"L. rhodesiensis\", a brown-colored relative of \"L. geometricus\" which is native to Zimbabwe. Both species are collectively known as brown button spiders throughout southern Africa. Brown button spiders are known to have a lifespan of about two years.\n\nThe brown widow has a cosmopolitan distribution. It is thought by some researchers to originate in South Africa, although this is uncertain, as specimens were discovered in both Africa and South America. They are usually found around buildings in tropical areas. They can compete with populations of the black widow spider. It is found in many areas of South Africa, the United States (including Hawaii), Australia, Afghanistan, Southern Europe, China, Japan, Dominican Republic, Cyprus, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Uruguay, and Brazil, and there have been sightings in the United Arab Emirates, Pakistan, India (Ahmedabad) and Thailand.\n\nAs of 2012, researchers at the University of California, Riverside, suggested that the brown widow spider, newly established in Southern California, may in fact be displacing black widow spiders from the region, competing and/or fighting for territory. While certainly not definitive, this evidence does suggest that the brown widow is likely to be more hostile and aggressive towards its relative, the black widow, than the black widow is towards it. If that proves to be true, humans may be positively affected since brown widow bites are less toxic than those of black widows, thus posing less of a threat as they displace black widows over time.\n\nLike all \"Latrodectus\" species, \"L. geometricus\" has a neurotoxic venom. The venom acts on nerve endings causing the very unpleasant symptoms of latrodectism. However, brown widow bites are usually not very dangerous; usually much less dangerous than those of \"L. mactans\", the black widow. The effects of the toxin are usually confined to the bite area and surrounding tissue, unlike the black widow's. Mere toxicity of the venom is not the only factor in dangerousness. Brown widow bites are minor compared to black widow bites because they cannot deliver the same amount of venom as the black widow. The LD of \"L. geometricus\" venom has been measured in mice as 0.43 mg/kg, and separately again as 0.43 mg/kg (with a 95% confidence interval of 0.31–0.53).\n\n"}
{"id": "2001788", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2001788", "title": "Planet Us", "text": "Planet Us\n\nPlanet Us (pronounced \"Planet-uss\") was a short-lived supergroup that formed in 2002 with Sammy Hagar on lead vocals, Neal Schon on guitar, Michael Anthony on bass, and Deen Castronovo on drums. The band later recruited a fifth member—famed guitarist Joe Satriani—when their original choice, Slash, turned them down. \nThe band's name \"Planet Us\" has been alternatively spelled as \"Planet US\" in various publications.\n\nIn 2002, with some down time between Journey albums and Van Halen still unreformed at this point, the members decided to kickstart a separate project. The band was announced in early 2002 yet Schon and Castronovo were still recording and subsequently toured with Journey that summer, while Hagar was touring with David Lee Roth in the successful 'Sans Halen' tour. The new group then planned to reconvene in the Fall but the initial recording sessions scheduled in San Francisco were again delayed until January 2003 while Castronovo recovered from an illness.\n\nIn the end, only two songs were written and recorded under the Planet Us name: \"Vertigo\" and \"Peeping Through a Hole\" and neither was officially released by the band itself. \"Vertigo\" was originally intended for the first \"Spider-Man\" movie; however, it was turned down by Sony (correctly, says Sammy) for being \"too f—in' heavy!\" \"Peeping Through a Hole,\" a very dark song about an abused child, was later re-recorded by another of Neal Schon's projects, Soul SirkUS with Jeff Scott Soto on vocals, and released as \"Peephole\" on the Soul SirkUS \"World Play\" CD.\n\nIn an interview from late 2005, Neal Schon described how material he had originally written for Planet Us ended up on the Soul SirkUS project instead: \"There was a couple songs that did end up on Journey's \"Generations\" that I wrote during the same time period that I wrote that material like \"Faith in the Heartland\" and \"Out Of Harm's Way\". They were all written in the same month. I wrote about twenty songs that month and it was all going to be for the project that I was doing with Sammy Hagar. ... I wanted to do something with this material that I had written with Planet Us. So, I decided to re-group and put it out with some guys that I think are 'happening'. And that's what I did. I sent Jeff (Scott Soto) all my material and he wrote all the vocals. When he got eight songs done, we went into the studio and knocked it out in a couple of days.\"\n\nThe band only appeared live four times, the first being at the 25th annual Bammies (aka the California Music Awards) on Saturday, April 27, 2002 in Oakland, California. After Sammy Hagar took the stage playing three songs with his band the Waboritas he announced a few friends and Schon, Anthony, and Castronovo took the stage. They then played \"Vertigo\" and \"Peeping Through a Hole\" publicly for the first time. Hagar and Anthony had performed at the Bammies years earlier as Los Tres Gusanos.\n\nThe second and third appearances also occurred when Schon, Anthony, and Castronovo joined Hagar on tour, this time at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas on May 17 and May 18, 2002. Both nights they ended Hagar's headlining show with performances of their only two songs.\n\nTheir fourth and final performance occurred on March 12, 2003 on the syndicated radio show \"Rockline\" hosted by Bob Coburn. Sammy introduced the band's recently expanded line-up with Joe Satriani on guitar and after briefly explaining the origin of the 'side project' they played \"Vertigo\" to end the night.\n\nPlanet Us never finished their planned album likely due to the busy nature of its members at the time. Hagar and Anthony returned to Van Halen with much fanfare in 2004 and subsequently went on a world tour. In frustration, Schon and Castronovo took the material written for Planet Us and formed Soul SirkUS with Soto, touring the results before returning to their regular duties in Journey.\n\nIn 2008, Hagar released the songs \"Vertigo\" (now renamed to \"Psycho Vertigo\") and \"Peephole\" on his \"Cosmic Universal Fashion\" album. In the liner notes Hagar states: \"Neal Schon has been a friend for years. We have talked about working together but the time had never been quite right. A few years ago we finally wrote a couple of songs, \"Psycho Vertigo\" and \"Peephole\", and decided to go into the studio and record. I called Michael Anthony to play his bass while Neal enlisted Deen Castronovo to play drums. I had a home studio in my\nbasement where we worked out these two tracks. We were really excited about the way things were going and had already decided to call ourselves Planet Us. Then the phone rang and the Van Hagar reunion was an idea that was just too irresistible to pass up. I am happy these tracks are finally coming out.\"\n\nPlanet Us was the second project that Hagar and Schon formed, the first being the short-lived Hagar Schon Aaronson Shrieve from the mid-1980s. Although it seems unlikely that they will regroup and produce a proper album, Neal Schon has left the door open stating \"If he (Hagar) calls me up and says 'Schon – let's go'. I'm gone and it'll be fun.\"\n\nSatriani, Hagar and Anthony would later join forces for another band named Chickenfoot; that band formed in 2009.\n\n"}

Both methods are designed to satisfy the Condorcet criterion, and allow for incomplete ballots and equal rankings.\n\nThe Nanson method is based on the original work of the mathematician Edward J. Nanson in 1882.\n\nNanson's method eliminates those choices from a Borda count tally that are at or below the average Borda count score, then the ballots are retallied as if the remaining candidates were exclusively on the ballot. This process is repeated if necessary until a single winner remains.\n\nIf a Condorcet winner exists, they will be elected. If not, (there is a Condorcet cycle) then the preference with the smallest majority will be eliminated.\n\nNanson's method can be adapted to handle incomplete ballots (including \"plumping\") and equal rankings (\"bracketing\"), though he describes two different methods to handle these cases: a theoretically correct method involving fractions of a vote, and a practical method involving whole numbers (which has the side effect of diminishing the voting power of voters who plump or bracket). This then allows the use of Approval-style voting for uninformed voters who merely wish to approve of some candidates and disapprove of others.\n\nThe method can be adapted to multi-winner elections by removing the name of a winner from the ballots and re-calculating, though this just elects the highest-ranked \"n\" candidates and does not result in proportional representation.\n\nSchwartz in 1986 studied a slight variant of Nanson's rule, in which candidates less than \"but not equal to\" the average Borda count score are eliminated in each round.\n\nCandidates are voted for on ranked ballots as in the Borda count. Then, the points are tallied in a series of rounds. In each round, the candidate with the fewest points is eliminated, and the points are re-tallied as if that candidate were not on the ballot.\n\nThis method actually predates Nanson's, who notes it was already in use by the Trinity College Dialectic Society. \n\nIt was systematized by Joseph M. Baldwin in 1926, who incorporated a more efficient matrix tabulation, extending it to support incomplete ballots and equal rankings.\n\nThe two methods have been confused with each other in some literature.\n\nThe Nanson method and the Baldwin method satisfy the Condorcet criterion. Because Borda always gives any existing Condorcet winner more than the average Borda points, the Condorcet winner will never be eliminated. \n\nThey do not satisfy the independence of irrelevant alternatives criterion, the monotonicity criterion, the participation criterion, the consistency criterion and the independence of clones criterion, while they do satisfy the majority criterion, the mutual majority criterion, the Condorcet loser criterion and the Smith criterion. The Nanson method satisfies and the Baldwin method violates reversal symmetry.\n\nBoth the Nanson and the Baldwin methods can be run in polynomial time to obtain a single winner. For the Baldwin method, however, at each stage, there might be several candidates with lowest Borda score. In fact, it is NP-complete to decide whether a given candidate is a Baldwin winner, i.e., whether there exists an elimination sequence that leaves a given candidate uneliminated.\n\nBoth methods are computationally more difficult to manipulate than Borda's method.\n\nNanson's method was used in city elections in the U.S. town of Marquette, Michigan in the 1920s. It was formerly used by the Anglican Diocese of Melbourne and in the election of members of the University Council of the University of Adelaide. It was used by the University of Melbourne until 1983.\n\n"}

Plans to restore and include the old marquee never came to fruition. However, a 4-screen multi-plex movie theater was built inside the new tower. Originally the new theater was operated by Act III Theaters, which had been formed from the chain started by Moyer. The 1000 Broadway theater, along with all Act III theaters, was later acquired by Regal Cinemas in 1998, which in turn closed the 1000 Broadway four-plex in September 2011. \n\n\n"}

He is known for owning and operating the Gallery Furniture retail chain.\n\nMcIngvale was born on February 11, 1951, in Starkville, Mississippi. He graduated from Bishop Lynch High School in Dallas and attended North Texas State University, now University of North Texas, in Denton where he played football. He and his wife have three children. Their daughter Elizabeth was diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder at age 12, and at one point several doctors declared her illness too severe to be treatable. McIngvale and his wife sent her to the Menninger Clinic when she was 15, where she underwent Exposure Response Prevention Therapy and eventually learned to manage her OCD. She later became an assistant professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the Baylor College of Medicine, and founded the Peace of Mind Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to helping people with OCD.\n\nIn 2002, Jim McIngvale co-authored the book \"Always Think Big\" with Thomas Duening and John Ivancevich, which chronicles the ups and downs of McIngvale's entrepreneurial career. He lives in the Northgate Forest community in an unincorporated area of Harris County, Texas. Ericka Mellon of the \"Houston Chronicle\" said that he was \"one of Northgate's most recognizable residents.\"\n\nMcIngvale is best known for his energetic, fast-paced sales pitches, typically ending with some variant of his catchphrase \"saves you money!\" His distinctive sales style originated from an incident that occurred early on in Gallery Furniture's history. Faced with financial difficulties, McIngvale invested all his remaining money, approximately $10,000, in a television commercial to be aired on two stations. While watching the commercial being produced, he became dissatisfied and ad-libbed a sales pitch, speaking rapidly because of the limited amount of time available. The commercial proved very effective, and his sales increased dramatically afterward.\n\nIn 1999, McIngvale spoke to the British Deming Association annual conference about the influence of \"W Edwards Deming\" on his business methods.\n\nIn May 2009, the \"Houston Chronicle\" reported that McIngvale refused to pay $48,000 dollars of taxes to the Greater Northside Management District that was assessed from 2005 to 2007; he paid taxes to the district in 2008. His northside facility is within the district's boundary. McIngvale said the management district does not do enough to maintain the area; the business owner described the management district's taxation policies as \"taxation without representation.\" The district sued McIngvale to try to force him to pay the taxes, and McIngvale said he's willing to dispute the charges in court.\n\nIn June 2019, McIngvale suffered a possible transient ischemic attack.\n\nWhen Hurricane Imelda flooded Houston in 2019, McIngvale once again opened the doors of Gallery Furniture and partnered with Crisis Clean Up to provide free meals and shelter at the North Freeway location.\n\nIn 2010, Jim McIngvale supported the Tea Party movement. He funded full-page ads for the Tea Party that appeared in the \"Houston Chronicle\". He was a guest speaker along with many local conservative radio hosts for The North Houston Tea Party Patriots at Sam Houston Race Park.\n\nIn the 2015 Houston mayor's race, McIngvale endorsed conservative candidate Bill King over Sylvester Turner. Turner won the election.\n\nIn 2018, McIngvale endorsed the reelection of Republican US Representative John Culberson and appeared in commercials supporting the congressman.\n\nIn April 2020, Governor Greg Abbott named McIngvale to the Strike Force to Open Texas – a group \"tasked with finding safe and effective ways to slowly reopen the state\" amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n"}

It operated ad hoc charter services, VIP flights, and inclusive-tour and sub-charter flights, as well as ACMI wet leases for other airlines. Its main base was Bournemouth Airport. The company went into administration on Tuesday 2 December 2008.\n\nEuropean Aviation Air Charter Limited held a United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority Type A Operating Licence. It was permitted to carry passengers, cargo and mail on aircraft with 20 or more seats.\n\nEuropean Aviation Air Charter began in 1989, as European Aviation. Paul Stoddart, the boss of European Aviation Air Charter, saw a gap in the market for an ad-hoc charter airline. The aircraft used at first were rather old BAC-111 jets, which had been first built during the 1960s. The aircraft were flown over from Australia, as their previous owner was the Royal Australian Air Force. European Aviation was initially based in the building where the British Aircraft Corporation used to make aircraft such as the Vickers Viscount and the BAC-111s that the airline was operating. European Air Charter operated from Bournemouth Airport from its inception, making the airport a hub for the airline. The airline was profitable, so the company expanded its operation into other areas such as flight crew training, maintenance for other operators and leasing and selling aircraft.\n\nIn 1993, the company directors took the decision of changing European Aviation's name to \"European Aviation Air Charter\", or EAC for short. That same year, twenty other BAC-111s were bought from British Airways. This meant the airline could include tour groups among its charter clients. By then the airline also acquired but never operated the far newer Airbus A300, as well as Boeing 737s. By 1997 European had acquired one Boeing 727 airliner as well.\nEuropean Air Charter asked for permission to land at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, Chicago and other US and Canadian destinations in 2001. Due to the volume of passengers the airline projected to transport on each flight to North America, Boeing 747s were bought, once again from British Airways. A total of six former British Airways aircraft of that type entered service with the airline after the permits were granted. European Air Charter formed an association with Palmair, which flew passengers to Bournemouth so they could board the European Air Charter jets to North America.\n\nHowever, in 2004 EAC started losing money. Paul Stoddart resumed control of EAC and went about cost-cutting; this involved selling or scrapping the Boeing 747s, selling some Boeing 737-200s and disposing of the rest of the fleet. In May 2008 it was announced that Paul Stoddart had sold his stake in OzJet to HeavyLift Cargo Airlines, and the four Boeing 737-200s which were in European's fleet were handed over in the process.\n\nThe airline was wholly owned by Paul Stoddart and had 270 employees (at March 2007).\n\nThe European Aviation Air Charter fleet consisted of the following aircraft at the time of collapse:\n\n"}

The homes in Victorian Village were built from 1846 into the 1890s, and range in style from Neo-classical through Late Gothic Revival. Edward C. Jones, one of Memphis's most significant Victorian-era architects, and his partner, Matthias Harvey Baldwin, built the Woodruff-Fontaine House (1870) and renovated the Harsson-Goyer-Lee House (1871).\n\nMallory-Neely House]]\n\nThe Massey House, the oldest in the area (ca. 1846), was built for Benjamin A. Massey, an early Memphis lawyer.\n\nThe Mallory-Neely House (1852) was built in Italian villa style with a central tower for banker Isaac Kirtland and extensively renovated and expanded during the 1880s and 1890s. The interior is well preserved, with much of the original late-19th-century furnishings intact.\n\nThe Harsson-Goyer-Lee House (690 Adams, see photograph) was once the home of riverboat owner James Lee. It was expanded in 1871 by Charles Goyer, a founder of Union Planters Bank.\n\nThe Pillow-McIntyre House (ca. 1852) is a two-story Greek Revival home purchased in 1873 by Mexican War and Confederate General Gideon Pillow. This striking eclectic-style Victorian had been unused for years, but with the assistance of corporate and community donations it was refurbished in 2004.\n\nThe Woodruff-Fontaine House (1870) was built in French-Victorian style by Amos Woodruff, a successful carriage maker, entrepreneur and politician. The second resident, Noland Fontaine, was a factor in the Memphis Cotton Exchange. The house was deeded to the city in 1936, and in later years was used for an art school. In 1961 the art school moved, and the Association for the Preservation of Tennessee Antiquities took over the house and restored it with 19th-century regional antiques and textiles. A Victorian Gingerbread playhouse is also on the grounds.\n\nThe Snowden home in the Annesdale-Snowden Historic District dates from the same era. In 1850, Dr. Samuel Mansfield built this \"Italianate villa\" on his plantation just outside Memphis. The house was situated on a knoll above what was then the stage route to Mississippi. In 1869 Colonel Robert C. Brinkley bought the estate as a wedding gift to his daughter, Annie Overton Brinkley, and her new husband, Colonel Bogardus Snowden. The estate was named Annesdale in her honor. In the first decade of the 20th century, Col. Snowden and his sons John and Robert built two subdivisions on the estate, \"Annesdale Park\" (1903), claimed to be the first in the South, and \"Snowden Homestead\" (1910). The streets in these then-affluent subdivisions were named for the Snowden children. Memphis entrepreneur Kemmons Wilson and other well-known Memphis names resided there. After World War II, the neighborhood gradually declined until it began to be gentrified in the 1970s and after it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. The Snowden home is not open to the public.\n\nSome of these three- and four-story mansions now stand near the city's downtown along Adams Avenue. While most of the original homes are now gone, several remain as museums: the Magevney House (198 Adams), the Mallory-Neely House (652 Adams) and the Woodruff-Fontaine House (680 Adams). The Magevney House is currently open the first Saturday each month from 1pm-4pm with free admission. The Mallory-Neely House is open Friday and Saturday, 10:00-4:00. After 60+ years of being vacant, the Harsson-Goyer-Lee House has been renovated into a high-end Bed and Breakfast. The Woodruff-Fontaine House's hours are Wednesday-Sunday, 12:00-4:00 and is a popular venue for weddings and private parties.\n\nThe Victorian Village neighborhood is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe Lowenstein-Long House (1901) at 217 N. Waldran Blvd. and the Lee-Macintyre House in Victorian Village are considered to be endangered by Memphis Heritage, a non-profit preservationist group based in the city.\n\n"}

Some historians of economics believe that he coined the phrase \"laissez faire, laissez passer\". Evidence was to be found when the French State parted the West Indies Company privilege - monopoly - on the slave trade. He is also credited with coining the term \"bureaucracy\". Together with François Quesnay, whose disciple he was, he was a leader of the Physiocratic School.\n\nGournay's father was Claude Vincent, a merchant in Saint-Malo as well as a secretary to the king. Gournay didn't write much, but had a great influence on French economic thought through his conversations with many important theorists. He became instrumental in popularizing the work of Richard Cantillon in France.\n\nGournay was appointed an \"intendant du commerce\" in 1751. One of the main themes of his term in office was his opposition to government regulations because of what he saw as the way they stunted commerce. He coined the term \"bureaucratie\" (literally \"government by desks\") to describe the situation. Gournay's disdain for government regulation of commerce influenced his disciple Turgot. \n\nGournay's first name is often mistakenly given as \"Jean\", due to an error made by Turgot in his letter to Jean-François Marmontel known as \"In Praise of Gournay\".\n\nA street in Saint-Malo, the \"Rue Vincent-de-Gournay\", takes its name from him.\n"}

Originally formed in 1991 by brothers Johnny Gioeli and Joey Gioeli, the band consisted of five members, Johnny Gioeli, Joey Gioeli, Neal Schon, Todd Jensen and Deen Castronovo. The band's most recent album is \"Life\", which was released in 2019. Joey Gioeli has not appeared on a Hardline album since 2002's \"II\" after retiring from music to focus on family business. Johnny Gioeli remains the only original member of the band.\n\nHardline is a band created by brothers Johnny Gioeli and Joey Gioeli, who had previously played in the bands Killerhit and Brunette (which at one point was the top-drawing band in Hollywood, setting the all-time attendance record at Gazzarri's), starred in the unreleased Roman Coppola film 'Smash Crash & Burn' as the band Royal Smash, and later played in the band Gravity, and have since returned to Hardline. The band originally also included guitarist Neal Schon of Journey and Bad English, bassist Todd Jensen (ex-Sequel), and drummer Deen Castronovo. The group's sound was a mainstream commercialized mixture of glam metal and AOR. Two of the group's first songs were played in the movie \"Rapid Fire\" which starred Brandon Lee, the son of martial arts expert, Bruce Lee, at the actor's request.\n\nTheir debut album Double Eclipse was released on April 28 1992, and was well received by audiences and had extensive radio airplay at the time. It consisted of many tracks suitable for the Album-oriented rock genre. They toured with artists such as Mr. Big and Extreme across America. Several music videos such as 'Hot Cherie', 'Takin' Me Down', and 'Can't Find My Way' were made to promote the album. The Danny Spanos cover of 'Hot Cherie' was their most famous performance. The Japanese edition of the album featured the bonus track \"Love Leads The Way\". Although they mainly performed as opening acts for artists, they did do their own shows too. Plans for a Japan tour were also made but folded after the band broke up in late 1992. Extensive touring in other countries such as Europe were also planned, but again did not materialise after the band's initial break up. \n\nOn November 2, 1992, the Hardline song \"In the Hands of Time\" was played in its entirety during a montage on the \"princess of Tides\" episode of the TV serial, Baywatch\n\nAfter Hardline lost its record deal, Neal Schon departed to begin several projects before finally rejoining Journey. Former Jag Panzer and Shrapnel Records legend Joey Tafolla was approached to join but was unable to participate at the time due to his work schedule, consisting primarily of building his southern California merchandising company. Todd Jensen and Deen Castronovo left to join Ozzy Osbourne's backing band, though Jensen was replaced by Geezer Butler. Eventually, Deen Castronovo also joined Journey.\n\nDrummer Bobby Rock played on Hardline's second album, \"II\". He had previously played several times with the Gioeli brothers in the band Brunette, replacing their regular drummer. They met via Rock's former Vinnie Vincent Invasion bandmate Dana Strum, who produced one of Brunette's demos, on which Rock played some drum tracks. Rock suggested his friend, LA session bassist Christopher Maloney, who had previously worked with Dweezil Zappa, to handle the bass duties on \"II\". Due to Maloney's focus on promoting his solo album \"Control\" as well as working with other artists, he was unable to join the band for \"The Gods Festival\" in Bradford, England in June 2002. Producer Bob Burch played bass at the festival in his stead.\n\nAngel keyboardist Michael T. Ross, a friend to Tafolla, joined the band for \"II\" and the live DVD. Former The Storm guitarist Josh Ramos was signed up to play lead guitar for Hardline at \"The Gods Festival,\" and, when Tafolla was unable to finish recording lead guitar for \"II\", was brought in and, in two long, pressure-packed days, laid down all the leads for the album. Johnny Gioeli was displeased with the performance at The Gods festival, and often discredits it. The band tried to revive the original Hardline line up for the performance, but things didn't go to plan. He could not stop the DVD and CDs from being released due to the Frontiers record label's demands, the two bonus tracks \"Hypnotised\" and \"Mercy\" were released without his permission. The acoustic version of \"Only a Night\" is also available on the CD version, which was also a exclusive bonus track from Japan. \n\nHardline's third studio album, \"Leaving the End Open\", was released on April 17, 2009 in Europe and on May 19 in the United States, after much delay. It was originally slated for release in Spring 2006. Recording began in 2004, then under the title 'Just Add Water'. They initially asked ex Ozzy Osbourne and Quiet Riot bassist Rudy Sarzo to join the band, but he was busy with other projects at the time. Instead, White Fang bassist Jamie Brown took his place, with Atma Anur on drums and returning member Michael T Ross on keyboards. The album could be described as a co-project between Gioeli and Ramos, the latter having contributed significantly to the lyrics and concept of the project. The album's artwork is also the first album cover by the group that doesn't include a reference to their first album, Double Eclipse. Johnny Gioeli expressed interest for touring for this album but plans never materialised, as he was busy touring with Axel Rudi Pell at the time. This line up is one of the only eras of Hardline that never played live on stage with the members of this album. .\n\nOn December 22, 2011, Johnny Gioeli confirmed, via the Frontiers Records official site, that he and Italian keyboard player and producer Alessandro Del Vecchio of Edge of Forever and Eden's Curse would release Hardline's fourth studio album in mid-2012. Entitled \"Danger Zone\", the new album's art features an eclipse to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the debut album \"Double Eclipse\" and was released on May 18, 2012 by Frontiers Records. Del Vecchio commented that he had written the lyrics and music for the album with Gioeli's vocals in mind, and sent demos to Frontiers president Serafino Perugino, who then sent the demos to Gioeli, who immediately became interested in reforming Hardline once again. Music video shooting for the track \"Fever Dreams\" began on April 15, and the final video was released on May 18. Via Frontiers Records's official electronic press kit for Danger Zone, Johnny Gioeli and Alessandro Del Vecchio announced that \"by the time you watch this, we will already be working on the next [album].\" \n\nHardline appeared live, for the first time since \"The Gods Festival,\" at the Sweden Rock Festival on June 7, 2013. Axel Rudi Pell drummer Mike Terrana and returning Hardline guitarist Josh Ramos joined the band in place of Thorsten Koehne and Francesco Jovino to play ten songs from all four Hardline albums, notably performing songs from \"Leaving the End Open\" and \"Danger Zone\" live for the first time. Additionally, Hardline played in person at the tenth anniversary of the Melodic Rock Festival \"Firefest\" in Nottingham on October 19, 2013 as the headlining band. Drummer Mark Cross stood in for Mike Terrana for the performance, and bass player Nikola Mazzucconi stood in for Anna Portalupi.\n\nOn October 14, 2016, Hardline released their fifth album called \"Human Nature\" with returning guitarist Josh Ramos, first time performing on a Hardline album since 2009's \"Leaving the End Open\" but had been continuously touring with the group since 2013. Human Nature was received quite positively by fans and critics, with offering homages to their 1992 debut album \"Double Eclipse\" with a fresh new sound. They performed only 2 shows in 2016, but toured extensively for the new record throughout Europe during 2017. A Japanese edition of \"Human Nature\" was also released which includes a special orchestral arrangement of Take You Home. During 2017 their Human Nature tour was changed to the Double Eclipse 25th Anniversary Tour which was also that year, however newer songs from \"Human Nature\" were also still performed. These tours were very successful. \n\nOn May 6 2018, it was announced that long time guitarist since 2002, Josh Ramos would leave Hardline, due to conflicts over production reasons and creative differences. Ramos was quickly replaced with the guitarist Mario Percudani who appeared on the \"Gioeli - Castronovo\" side project album (which also featured original Hardline member Deen Castronovo on drums & guest vocals) and is now a permanent member. On August 14, 2018, Johnny Gioeli confirmed during a new update video for his Pledgemusic campaign for his upcoming solo album that Hardline were working on their sixth album titled \"Life\", which was eventually released April 26, 2019. It is the first album to feature their new guitarist. It also contains a cover of the Queen song Who Wants To Live Forever as Gioeli often exclaims that Freddie Mercury is a huge influence on his voice, and many Hardline fans often compare the two singers that sound alike. The cover was also a dedication to Mercury and Queen. An extensive tour of the Life album followed, which began in 2019 majorly across Europe and Germany, and still continues in 2020. \nA forthcoming live CD and DVD set, 'Life Live' was recorded and filmed at the Frontiers Rock Festival in 2019 in Milan Italy, featuring tracks from the \"Life\" album performed live for the very first time, as well as classics from Double Eclipse. Released in February 2020, it will be their first official live recording since the Live at the Gods Festival 2002 CD & DVD release in 2003.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was built between 1924 and 1929 by RWE AG, to transport electricity produced in the hydro-electric power plants in Vorarlberg, Austria and the southern Black Forest to the Ruhr district. \n\nThe line begins in Bludenz and in Herbertingen connects with a second line, which comes from Tiengen. It continues to the transformer stations at Ludwigsburg-Hoheneck, Mannheim-Rheinau, Kelsterbach, Koblenz, and Bad Neuenahr to Brauweiler.\n\nThe entire line was originally installed on pylons with a three-tiered arrangement. With the exception of the Kelsterbach–Koblenz and Heilbronn–Neckarwestheim sections of the line, the North–South Powerline is still carried by the original masts. For the section which travels through Bad Neuenahr, Koblenz, Kelsterbach, Mannheim/Rheinau and Ludwigsburg/Hoheneck, C1-pylons are used; in other sections, C2 and C3 pylons are used, depending upon the need for the lines to withstand loads of ice during the winter.\n\nIn 1964, an electric circuit of the section traveling through Ludwigsburg/Hoheneck, Herbertingen and Tiengen switched over to 380 kV. In the section between the transformer stations Ludwigsburg–Hoheneck and Mannheim/Rheinau, an electric circuit was deemed to be dispensable in the year 2003. The two lowest conductors on this section of the line were dismantled between 10 November and 16 December 2003, to make better use of the land beneath the line route. The dispensable fourth conductor on the masts was left as an anchor.\n\n"}
{"id": "2001868", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2001868", "title": "The Demon Headmaster", "text": "The Demon Headmaster\n\nThe Demon Headmaster is a series of books by Gillian Cross which were later adapted as a television series starring Terrence Hardiman in the title role and Frances Amey as Dinah.\n\nThe title character is a strange being with the powers of hypnosis and a desire to take over the world, as he believes it will be better under his ordered rule. He has piercing light green eyes, which he normally hides behind dark-tinted glasses - removing these in order to hypnotise his victims.\n\nVery little about the Demon Headmaster or his background is shown in the books. His name is never revealed; he is referred to only as 'the Headmaster' both in the books and on television, except when he takes on an alias - such as the Computer Director in \"The Prime Minister's Brain\", and on each occasion he uses a title rather than a name.\n\n\nFirst Published in 1982.\n\nDinah Glass moves in with Lloyd and Harvey Hunter and at first does not like them. Soon she discovers that at her new school, the Headmaster is very strange and she finds herself saying things like, \"\"I think the Headmaster is a marvellous man and this is the best school I've ever been to\"\". With the help of her new friends, SPLAT, (Society for the Protection of our Lives Against Them, the children at the school who are immune to the Demon Headmaster's hypnotic powers), she successfully stops the Headmaster's plot to hypnotise the country through the Eddy Hair Television Show and she gets adopted by the Hunters. This became the first three episodes of the first series of the television adaptation.\n\nFirst published in 1985.The PrimeMinister_s_Brain The Prime Minister's Brain by Gillian Cross]</ref>\n\nDinah wins a place in the final of a computer competition, and she and SPLAT go to the finals. Little does she realise that the computer competition is a plot by the Demon Headmaster to take over the world, by hacking into the Prime Minister's computer (The Prime Minister's Brain) and hypnotizing the Prime Minister, thus allowing him to meet the other world leaders and gain control of them himself. This became the last three episodes of the first series of the television adaptation. (Later republished as \"The Demon Headmaster and the Prime Minister's Brain\" following the success of the television series.)\n\nFirst published in 1994 as \"Hunky Parker is Watching You\" \n\nWhen Ingrid turns up at a SPLAT meeting she is raving about Hunky Parker, a new TV show. It's the latest craze, she says, and soon everyone will be hooked. The other SPLAT members disagree until Ingrid shows them her Hunky video, which Dinah eventually realises is due to subliminal messages in the tape. Tracking the source of Hunky Parker merchandise, SPLAT learns that it has been created by the Demon Headmaster, attempting to trigger riots for new merchandise that he can use to exert his control over the populace.\n\nFirst published in 1996.\n\nDinah's father is headhunted for a new job at the Biogenetic Research Centre, unaware that the Demon Headmaster is the director. This time his lust for power sees him meddling with evolution itself. He has created an Evolution Accelerator: a machine to speed up the evolution process and produce the perfect human, beginning with the development of a fast-growing poisonous creeper that attacks Lloyd. But for this, he needs Dinah's DNA - combining it with a lizard to create Eve, a human/lizard hybrid who possesses Dinah's intellect but lacks her emotions - and then put her into terrible danger, pitting her against Eve to test his theories. This became series two of the television adaptation.\n\nFirst published 1997\n\nWhen the army starts dismantling the research centre, Dinah contacts Professor Claudia Rowe, an expert on botanical sciences who has expressed an interest in the creeper. Then weird things start to happen. Libraries start closing and their books are taken away. Telephones stop working, and there is no internet access. People start talking like robots, even Claudia Rowe, and more and more of the population seem to be wearing strange badges. Dinah's search leads her to the university where she finds the mysterious Director developing \"Hyperbrain\", a computer with superhuman intelligence and deadly potential. SPLAT swiftly realises that, although the original Headmaster was killed when he fell into the Evolution Accelerator, the machine still recorded his DNA and was thus able to create a clone, lacking the originals memories but retaining his lust for control. This became the third and final series of the television adaptation.\n\nFirst published 2002\n\nThe new club Purple is the place to go - if you can get in - and Mandy's cousin, Ellie, persuades Dinah and her friends to come along too. The man everyone wants to see is DJ Pardoman whose face keeps changing from Elvis to Madonna to Brad Pitt. His electronic mask is mesmerising but no one knows who he really is. When the kids visit his website they find an online competition: the person who finds out DJ Pardoman's true identity will be allowed to lift off the mask. Dinah, thinking the whole setup strange, joins in out of curiosity. In her search she stumbles across something amazing: her real father might be alive after years of thinking he was dead. Dinah must find out more. But she only realises the truth of these strange coincidences too late. This time the Demon Headmaster is intent on ensuring that Dinah will not interfere with his plans.\n\nFirst published 2017\n\nThe story continues with a new group of children, in a new school, without SPLAT's members. The stories centers on Lizzie, her younger brother, their friend Ethan and Angelika. Lizzie and her brother return from the United States, where their mother had surgery. After returning to their school, they realize that the school has a new headmaster and the students are showing exceptional talents, even their bully enemy Blake. However Lizzie suddenly starts to behave aggressive against the school, her brother becomes a robotics genius and their recent made friend Ethan becomes a soccer star. But when they try to talk, or even think about those sudden changes, their minds goes blank. Ethan eventually discover that the Headmaster is hypnotizing and controlling everybody in the school. They team up with Angelika (a girl who suddenly became a coffee business enthusiast) and even Blake (who became a Multilingual greeter) and discovers the great plot of The Headmaster to show to the Prime Minister the great results of the school, thus allowing The Headmaster to administrate others school.\n\nFirst published 2019\n\nBack in 1998, Puffin Books released a series of goody bags on certain themes and featured a notepad, pencil, rubber, etc., along with a small book. In the 'Fantasy' goody bag there was a book calling 'Crash Landing & Other Stories' by Gillian Cross. This book contains three short stories about the Demon Headmaster or people similar to him.\n\nThe first story, called 'Crash Landing', is set at some point after \"The Prime Minister's Brain\", and is about the Demon Headmaster crashing his getaway helicopter in a small village, although he is identified only as 'the Visitor'. It features SPLAT-type characters, including a lead named Charity who actually reads the \"Demon Headmaster\" books in the story, Charity defeating the Headmaster by using mirrored sunglasses to trick him into hypnotising himself.\n\nThe second story, called Carnival!, doesn't explicitly identify one of its characters as the Demon Headmaster, but from the illustrations and description are meant to make it obvious that it is him.\n\nThe third story is called 'Maths Homework', and features a teacher referred to as Old Webster. This isn't the Demon Headmaster but is a very similar character. The introduction to the story says, 'Maybe you think you have spotted the Demon Headmaster somewhere. Are you sure? Things aren't always what they seem.'\n\nIn the front of the book it says that 'Crash Landing' was first published in \"Shark And Chips And Other Stories\", and that 'Carnival' was published in the \"Young Telegraph\" in 1996. The third story is not mentioned.\n\nDinah is the main protagonist in the story \"The Demon Headmaster\" by Gillian Cross. She arrives in the story at the Hunters' house as a foster child, having been orphaned at an early age and brought up in a children's home. She is extraordinarily intelligent, but she normally keeps this quiet. Her intelligence causes the Headmaster to take an interest in her, and makes her pivotal in his plans to win a national school quiz competition for nefarious ends, as well as other subsequent plots, made easier by the fact that she is the only member of SPLAT not immune to his hypnosis. At the end of the first story, Dinah is adopted by the Hunter family and becomes Dinah Hunter.\n\nLloyd is the founder and leader of the Society for the Protection of our Lives Against Them, or SPLAT as it's known. Lloyd is one of only five children in the entire school whom the Headmaster is unable to hypnotize. Lloyd comes across as arrogant and cocky at times and also isn't the brightest kid at school unlike his now proper sister, Dinah, but Lloyd has shown on more than one occasion he is by no means stupid and is a more than capable leader of SPLAT even though he does come across as bossy and hates people stealing his thunder. Lloyd at first is very hostile towards Dinah and also takes the longest to accept her out of all the members of SPLAT, but eventually he is the first to suggest that his and Harvey's parents adopt Dinah.\n\nHarvey is a pleasant laid-back boy, very different to his older brother, Lloyd. It's clear he is very close to Lloyd, possibly because Lloyd has always looked out for him at school and helped him stay out of trouble with the Headmaster. Harvey accepts Dinah into the family and SPLAT a lot quicker than Lloyd and the others do, and soon is as close to his new sister as he is his brother. Harvey seems to understand Dinah more than Lloyd does and is more prepared to listen to her.\n\nIan acts as Lloyd's second-in-command in SPLAT. Ian, like Harvey, is very laid back and very much the joker of SPLAT. Ian will often break any tension with a well-timed joke and acts as a good foil to the more serious Lloyd.\n\nMandy is one of the more mature members of SPLAT and seems to be the motherly influence in the society. She is the best at soothing people like Lloyd and Ingrid when they get in a temper, and is generally the most level-headed of the gang, although she is not above making the odd snide remark when Lloyd's plans backfire.\n\nIngrid is the youngest member of SPLAT, but she's no pushover. Ingrid is generally the most childish member of SPLAT, prone to sulking when things don't go her way or the others don't listen to her. The fact that she's the youngest does mean that she is generally ignored if she makes a suggestion, although nine times out of ten she'll be right.\n\nThe Headmaster is the main antagonist of the series. He can turn almost anyone into a hypnotic state by having them look into his eyes, except for a few who seem to be naturally immune, among them Ingrid, Mandy, Harvey, Lloyd and Ian.\n\nIn 1996, the Demon Headmaster books were adapted by the BBC to make a television series based on the books. The series proved popular with children and ran for three series from 2 January 1996 to 22 January 1998. The first series contained six episodes, and aired twice weekly from 2 to 18 January 1996, the second series contained seven episodes, and aired once a week from 25 September to 6 November 1996, and the third series contained six episodes, and aired twice weekly from 6 to 22 January 1998.\n\nThe first series of the show was split into two distinctive story lines, with the first three episodes adapted from the first book in the series \"The Demon Headmaster\" and the last three were adapted from the second book \"The Demon Headmaster and the Prime Minister's Brain\". The second series was adapted from the fourth book \"The Demon Headmaster Strikes Again\". The third and final series was adapted from the fifth book \"The Demon Headmaster Takes Over\".\n\nIn 2019, CBBC broadcast a new adaptation, later revealed as a sequel to the previous show, from the book \"Total Control\". It aired from Monday October 14 with the pilot episode, \"everystudentastar\", adapted and showrun by Emma Reeves.\n\nReeves has pitched a second series to CBBC, using further elements of \"Total Control\", as well as its sequel, \"Mortal Danger\". As of January 28 2020, it has not yet been announced if there'll be a renewal.\n\nAll of the original books in the series are available on audiobook, \"Beware the Demon Headmaster\" and the \"Crash Landing\" book have yet to be released on Audio. Most of the books in the series are read by Judy Bennett, although Facing the Demon Headmaster is read by Kelly Hunter and not Judy Bennett. Also The Demon Headmaster (the first of the series) was read by Terrence Hardiman and released on cassette.\n\n"}

Pipe Major Sandy Jones of the Air Force band took over in 1970. \n\nIn 1985, the band changed its name to The Scottish & Irish Imports Pipe Band due to a sponsorship change, and was upgraded to Grade One. In 1990 Mike Green was named Pipe Major, and after competing under the Denny & Dunipace name during the 1990 season, the band was renamed to the City of Washington Pipe Band to avoid confusion with a new Pipe Band of the same name. In 2007 Dan Lyden was named Pipe Major, and continues the band's tradition of excellent playing on the east coast.\n\nSponsorship from Icelandair allowed the band to compete internationally in the 1990s, and the band was downgraded to conform with international standards. They won Grade Two at the World Pipe Band Championships in 1999, and were subsequently upgraded back to Grade One.

The tower was completed in 2000 at a cost of $64 million, and was named after the Fox Theatre that occupied the site from 1911 until the late 1990s. TVA Architects designed the building and Tom Moyer developed the property.\n\nOriginal designs for the tower included seven floors of above-ground parking. Plans for the above-ground parking levels were removed in 1998 to add space for what was originally to be a movie theater operated by Act III Theaters. The building earned Gold Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification from the U.S. Green Building Council in 2012 for its sustainability.\n\nThe building is most notable for the contrast between its curving east side and boxy west side. The juxtaposition of the building's angles create a unique profile from each side. This multiplanar and set-back design is meant to prevent as much of the building's shadow as possible from falling upon Pioneer Courthouse Square on the opposite corner.\n\nThe ground floor houses retail stores, and Regal's Fox Tower 10 movie theater is located on the second floor. The 462-space underground parking garage was the deepest in Portland when built. In 2006 the Fox Tower's developer, Tom Moyer, started construction of an underground garage on the block to the west, connected to the Fox Tower garage. This new parking structure opened in December 2007 making the total underground parking space count 1132. Because the west block lies slightly uphill from the Fox Tower, the west garage is deeper than the Fox Tower garage, relative to ground level. The new garage is an underground facility, with a City of Portland park on top of the garage. Construction and landscaping for the park was started by the City of Portland in March 2008. The underground parking is also planned to be connected to the Park Avenue West Tower.\n\n"}

Owned by iHeartMedia, WNIC broadcasts an adult contemporary radio format. Each year, between mid-November and December 25, WNIC switches its format to all-Christmas music.\n\nWNIC's studios and offices are located in Farmington Hills. WNIC's transmitter is located near Schoolcraft Avenue and Turner Street in the City of Detroit on the Near West Side. WNIC broadcasts with an effective radiated power of 32,000 watts from an antenna 600 feet in height. WNIC is licensed for HD Radio operation and features a soft AC/oldies format on its HD2 channel from iHeartRadio's \"Sunny Radio\" channel.\n\nWNIC signed on the air in December 1946 as WKMH-FM, sister station to 1310 WKMH (now WDTW). Both stations were, and still are, licensed to Dearborn. With FM radio still in its early stages, the two stations largely simulcast their programming through the 1970s.\n\nOn Halloween 1963, WKMH-AM-FM became WKNR-AM-FM, and legendary Top 40 radio station \"Keener 13\" was born, beginning a three-and-a-half-year reign at the top of Detroit's radio ratings until it was toppled by CKLW in nearby Windsor, Ontario, in 1967. WKMH's FM signal at 100.3 chiefly simulcast Keener AM (with automated Top 40 programming during non-simulcast times). In 1969, inspired by the success of groundbreaking progressive rock station 99.5 WABX (now WYCD), WKMH-FM adopted its own progressive rock sound. \"Uncle\" Russ Gibb was the WKNR-FM disc jockey who helped to spread the rumor that Paul McCartney was dead. According to Gibb, a college student in Ann Arbor called him on the air one Sunday afternoon and explained the theory to him. The rumor took off from there and generated lots of publicity for Gibb and WKNR-FM. It was air personality Chris Randall who phoned WABC New York City DJ Roby Yonge. Yonge put the rumor on the air in New York and was responsible for it spreading nationwide.\n\nWKNR-FM dropped its progressive rock format in 1971 to become \"Stereo Island,\" a cross between Beautiful Music and Middle of the Road that could be described as an early form of what would be later be called Soft Adult Contemporary. \"Stereo Island\" was successful and spawned imitators such as WFMK in Lansing, Michigan. In 1972, both WKNR and WKNR-FM were sold and became WNIC-AM-FM, simulcasting a straightforward Beautiful Music format. The WNIC call letters were meant to denote the station's \"NICe\" music. In 1976, WNIC adopted a more up-tempo sound called \"Rock 'n' Easy\", and moved to its current adult contemporary format. WNIC scored its first number-one placing in the monthly Arbitron ratings in Detroit in 1998.\n\nOn December 27, 2010, following its annual Christmas music programming and a two-hour \"music test\" at 2:00 p.m., WNIC dropped its long-time mainstream AC format and flipped to hot adult contemporary as \"Fresh 100.3\". Clear Channel's Detroit operations manager Todd Thomas stated that the new format was \"the music that radio listeners in Detroit told us they wanted to hear\", and \"a unique sound on 100.3 for 2011 and beyond.\" The new format was competed primarily with WDVD.\n\nIn December 2011, WNIC began to backtrack on its format changes, reflected by the amended slogan \"Variety From Today & Back In The Day\". The station also adjusted its on-air lineup adding Billy The Kidd for nights. \n\nOn November 7, 2013, coinciding with the start of the station's annual shift to all Christmas music, WNIC dropped the \"Fresh\" branding and returned to using \"100.3 WNIC\" as its on-air brand. While the station continued with its more upbeat format, WNIC has added an increased amount of 1980s and 1990s music and occasionally a 1970s song.\n\nWNIC, WOMC, and WDVD gained new competition in November 2018 with the flip of WDZH to soft AC. Four Detroit radio stations now compete for the 25-54 female audience.\n\n"}

It is spoken mostly on the islands of Makian, Kayoa and southern Halmahera in North Maluku province of Indonesia by about 20,000 people.\n\nThere are minor differences in dialect between all of the villages on Makian island in which Taba is spoken. Most differences affect only a few words. One of the most widespread reflexes is the use of /o/ in Waikyon and Waigitang, where in other villages /a/ is retained from Proto-South Halmaheran.\n\nAs of 2005, Ethnologue lists Taba as having a speaking population of approximately 20,000, however, it has been argued by linguists that this number could in reality be anywhere between 20,000 and 50,000. The language is predominantly spoken on Eastern Makian island, although it is also found on Southern Mori island, Kayoa islands, Bacan and Obi island and along the west coast of south Halmahera. There has also been continued migration of speakers to other areas of North Maluku due to frequent volcanic eruptions on Makian island. The island itself is home to two languages: Taba, which is spoken on the eastern side of the island, and a Papuan language spoken on the western side, known alternatively as West Makian or Makian Luar (outer Makian); in Taba, this language is known as \"Taba Lik\" (\"Outer Taba\"), while its native speakers know it as \"Moi\".\n\nTaba is divided into three different levels of speech: \"alus\", \"biasa\" and \"kasar\".\n\nAlus, or ‘refined’ Taba is used in situations in which the speaker is addressing someone older or of greater status than the speaker themselves. \nBiasa, or ‘ordinary’ Taba, is used in most general situations. \nThe Kasar, or ‘coarse’ form of Taba is used only rarely and generally in anger.\n\nTaba has fifteen indigenous consonant phonemes, and four loan phonemes: . These are shown below:\n\nTaba has five vowels, illustrated on the table below. The front and central vowels are unrounded; the back vowels are rounded.\n\nTaba is, predominantly, a head-marking language which adheres to a basic AVO word order. However, there is a reasonable degree of flexibility.\n\nTaba has both prepositions and postpositions.\n\nIn Taba, pronouns constitute an independent, closed set. Syntactically, Taba pronouns can be used in any context where a full noun phrase is applicable. However, independent pronouns are only used in reference to animate entities, unless pronominal reference to inanimate Patients is required in reflexive clauses. \n\nAs mentioned, independent pronouns are generally used for animate reference. However, there are two exceptions to this generalisation. In some circumstances an inanimate is considered a 'higher inanimate' which accords syntactic status similar to animates. This is represented as in English where inanimates such as cars or ships, for example, can be ascribed a gender. This is illustrated below in a response to the question 'Why did the \"Taba Jaya\" (name of a boat) stop coming to Makian?':\n\nThe \"Taba Jaya\", a boat significant enough to be given a name, is accorded pronoun status similar to animates. The other exception occurs in reflexive clauses where a pronominal copy of a reflexive Patient is required, as shown below:\n\nNon-human animates and inanimates are always grammatically singular, regardless of how many referents are involved. In Taba, pronouns and noun phrases are marked by Person and Number.\n\nTaba distinguishes three Persons in the pronominal and cross-referencing systems. Person is marked on both pronouns and on cross-referencing proclitics attached to verb phrases. The actor cross-referencing proclitics are outlined in the following table. In the first Person plural, a clusivity distinction is made, 'inclusive' (including the adressee) and 'exclusive' (excluding the addressee), as is common to most Austronesian languages.\n\nThe following are examples of simple Actor intransitive clauses showing each of the proclitic prefixes. This is an example of first Person singular (inclusive); \nsecond Person singular;\nthird Person singular;\nfirst Person plural (inclusive);\nfirst Person plural (exclusive);\nsecond Person plural; and\nthird Person plural;\nThe alternation between proclitic markers indicates Number, where in (3) \"k=\" denotes the arrival of a singular Actor, while in (7) \"a=\" indicates the arrival of first Person plural Actors, exclusionary of the addressee, and is replicated in the change of prefix in the additional examples.\n\nNumber is marked on noun phrases and pronouns. Taba distinguishes grammatically between singular and plural categories, as shown in (3) to (9) above. Plural marking is obligatory for humans and is used for all noun phrases which refer to multiple individuals. Plurality is also used to indicate respect in the second and third Person when addressing or speaking of an individual who is older than the speaker. The rules for marking Number on noun phrases are summarised in the table below:\n\nThe enclitic \"=si\" marks Number in noun phrases. \"=si\" below (10), indicates that there is more than one child playing on the beach and, in (11), the enclitic indicates that the noun phase \"mama lo baba\", translated as 'mother and father,' is plural.\n\nPlural Number is used as a marker of respect not only for second Person addressees, but for third Person referents as seen in (12). In Taba, it has been observed that many adults use deictic shifts towards the perspective of addressee children regarding the use of plural markers. Example (13) is typical of an utterance of an older person than those they are referring to, indicative of respect that should be accorded to the referent by the addressee.\n\nAll Taba verbs having Actor arguments carry affixes which cross-reference the Number and Person of the Actor, examples of proclitics are shown above. In Taba, there are valence-changing affixes which deal with patterns of cross-referencing with three distinct patterns. The dominant pattern is used with all verbs having an Actor argument. The other two patterns are confined to a small number of verbs: one for the possessive verb, the other for a few verbs of excretion. This is discussed further in Possession below.\n\nTaba does not, as such, have possessive pronouns. Rather, the possessor noun and the possessed entity are linked by a possessive ligature. The Taba ligatures are shown below:\n\nAdnominal possession involves the introduction of an inflected possessive particle between the possessor and the possessed entity; this inflected possessive, formally categorised as a ‘ligature’, is cross-referenced with the number and person of the possessor. This ligature indicates a possessive relationship between a modifier noun and its head-noun. In Taba, adnominal possession is distinguished by reverse genitive ordering, in which the possessor noun precedes the noun referring to the possessed entity.\n\nIn many contexts the possessor will not be overtly referenced.\n\nExample of reverse genitive ordering in Taba:\n\nIn Taba, alienable and inalienable possession is not obligatorily marked by the use of different forms, though this is common in many related languages. However, there are a number of seemingly inalienable entities which cannot be referred to without referencing a possessor.\n\nFor example:\n\nVerbal possession in Taba is generally indicated through the attaching of the causative prefix \"ha\"- to the adnominal possessive forms. The possessor then becomes actor of the clause, and the possessed entity becomes the undergoer. This method of forming a possessive verb is very unusual, typologically, and is found in almost no other languages.\n\nLike other Central-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian languages spoken in the Maluku Islands, Taba uses different particles to negate declarative and imperative clauses; declaratives are negated using \"te\", while imperatives are negated using \"oik.\" In both cases the negative particles are clause-final, a placement which is posited to be the result of contact with non-Austronesian Papuan languages.\n\nDeclarative clauses are negated using the particle \"te\", which follows all other elements of the clause except for modal and aspectual particles (these are discussed below). Examples (15a) and (15b) show negation of an Actor intransitive clause, while (16a) and (16b) give negation of a non-Actor bivalent clause (i.e. a clause with two Undergoer arguments); \"te\" has the same clause-final placement regardless of the clause structure.\n\nNegation of complex sentences can be ambiguous — see example (17), where \"te\" can operate on either just the complement clause \"khan\" 'I'm going' or to the whole clause complex \"kalusa khan\" 'I said I'm going':\n\nNegative existential clauses\n\n\"te\" can serve as the predicator of a negative existential clause, with no verb required. It can occur immediately following the noun phrase that refers to whatever is being asserted as non-existent, as in (18):\n\nHowever, a discourse marker is generally interposed between the noun phrase and \"te\". This marker expresses something about how the non-existence of the noun phrase's referent relates to the discourse context, or alternatively indicates the speaker's attitude towards the proposition. In (19), the discourse marker \"mai\" (glossed as 'but') is used to indicate that the non-existence of tea, sugar and coffee in the household described by the speaker is counter to one's expectations that a normal household would have these items:\n\nComplex negative modal / aspectual particles\n\nTaba has three complex negative particles which, in addition to negation, express mood or aspect; these are formed by the modal and aspectual particles attaching onto \"te\" as clitics. The three particles are \"tedo\" (realis negative), \"tehu\" (continuative negative), and \"tesu\" (potential negative).\n\n\"tedo\" (realis negative)\n\n\"tedo\" is a compound of \"te\" and the realis mood marker \"do\", and expresses a more emphatic negation than plain \"te\". In (20), it is used to emphasize the absolute nature of the prohibition against making alcohol in the Muslim community of the speaker:\n\n\"tehu\" (continuative negative)\n\n\"tehu\" is a compound of \"te\" and the continuous aspect marker hu, and can be roughly translated as 'not up to the relevant point in time': this may be either the time of utterance (i.e. 'not yet', 'still not'), or some other time relevant to the context of the utterance, as in (21). Unlike the potential negative \"tesu\", \"tehu\" does not express any expectations about the likelihood of the negated event or state occurring in the future.\n\n\"tehu\" also often appears at the end of the first clause in a sequence of clauses, indicating whatever is referred to by the first clause has not still occurred by the time of the event(s) or state(s) referred to by the following clauses.\n\n\"tesu\" (potential negative)\n\n\"tesu\" is formed by suffixing \"-su\", expressing the potential mood, to \"te\". Although \"tesu\" is similar to \"tehu\" in that it encodes the meaning 'not up to the relevant point in time', it also expresses an expectation that the event referred to \"will\" occur in the future: this expectation is made explicit in the free translation of (23).\n\n\"tesu\" shares with \"tehu\" the ability to be used at the end of the first clause in a sequence of clauses, and also carries a similar meaning of incompletion; in addition, it encodes the expectation that the event referred to by the first clause should have happened by the event(s) of the following clauses. This expectation does not need to have actually been fulfilled; the breakfast that was expected to be cooked in the first clause of (24) was, in reality, never cooked due to the ensuing eruption.\n\nUnlike the modal and aspectual markers which are used to form the other complex negative particles, \"su\" is not attested as a free morpheme elsewhere; however, it is likely related to the optional final \"-s\" of the modal verb \"-ahate(s)\" 'to be unable', which appears to be derived historically from \"te\" having fused onto the verb \"-ahan\" 'to be able'. When used with a final \"-s\", as in (25b) compared with (25a), this modal verb encodes the same meanings expressed by \"tesu\":\n\nImperative clauses are negated using the admonitive particle \"oik\". This particle appears to be derived from a verb \"oik\" 'to leave something behind'; however, this verb requires Actor cross-referencing, whereas the particle is never cross-referenced. Bowden (2001) posits that the imperative use of \"oik\" has developed from the use of the independent verb in serial verb constructions, with the morphological elements being lost in the process of grammaticalization. The particle is shown in (26), while the verbal use (with cross-referencing) is shown in (27):\n\nYes-no (polar) questions can be posed with either positive or negative polarity; positive polarity questions operate in much the same way as in English, while negative polarity questions, which are formed using forms of the negative marker \"te\" as question tags, work in a different manner. An example of a positive polarity question is given below in (28a), while (28b) shows a negative polarity question:\nThe answers to the positive polarity may be either \"Jou/Ole\" (Yes, I do smoke) or \"Te\" (No, I don't smoke); when responding to the negative polarity question, the answers are either \"Jou/Ole\" (Yes, I do \"not\" smoke), \"Te\" (No, I \"do\" smoke).\n\nAs is common with many Melanesian people, Taba speakers practice ritual name taboo. As such, when a person dies in a Taba community, their name may not be used by any person with whom they had a close connection. This practice adheres to the Makianese belief that, if the names of the recently deceased are uttered, their spirits may be drastically disturbed. The deceased may be referred to simply as ‘Deku’s mother’ or ‘Dula’s sister’. Others in the community with the same name as the deceased will be given \"maronga\", or substitute names.\n\n"}
{"id": "2001884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2001884", "title": "Material culture of the Manasir", "text": "Material culture of the Manasir\n\nThe material culture of the Manasir is very basic and primarily relies on the by-products of palm tree cultivation (cf. Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir). Date trees not only constitute the main source of income and an important supply of nutrition in Dar al-Manasir, but the Manasir also make intelligent use of all different parts of the palm tree. From it they produce diverse household items, garden tools and building material for their traditional mud houses. (cf. Architecture in Dar al-Manasir).\n\nWhat follows is a list of raw materials gathered from the date palm and the products that can be manufactured from them.\n\n\"Garidah\" is the midrib part of the palm leaf. In order to be used as a raw material the \"Garidah\" is stripped of its leaflets and spikes and its broad petiole is removed. \"Garidat\" are an esteemed raw material for the production of robust containers and furniture.\n\nThe Manasir use it to manufacture small boxes (Sunduq, صنضق) in which they carry vegetables to the weekly market at \"Suq Salamat\" (سوق سلمات).<br>\nAdditionally, \"Garidah\" is a good fencing material used for making small hutches called Qafas (قفص) to protect the chicken against wild animals. The Manasir also use it as roofing material to thatch their traditional mud houses (\"Galus\", جالوص).\n\n\"Sa'fat\" are the leaflets of palm leaves and the most important raw material for a variety of household items including baskets for use in gardening.\n\nHousehold items of particular cultural and practical significance are woven mats called Burush (sing. \"Birsh\", برش).<br>\nMats that are called Segagah (سجاجة) are two ells wide and are laid out on the traditional beds called 'Anqarib \n(عنقريب).\nA plain uncoloured \"Segagah\" is kept aside in every household to be used for washing and carrying the body of a deceased.<br>\nA second type of Segagah is dyed in different colours and laid out by the bride groom during bridal night and further marriage festivities. It is reused for the period of forty days (ربع) after a woman has given birth and during which she is not supposed to leave the house.<br>\nA different kind of \"Birsh\" can be found in many households and in community places such as the guest house (\"Madeifah\", مضيفة) of the village. It is four ells long and will be rolled out on the floor during banquets or for prayers. It is called Birsh Ruba'i (برش رباعي).\nThe best \"Burush\" are woven from the leaves of \"Mishriq\" palm trees prominent for their soft and flexible leaflets, although leaflets of other varieties are added for higher durability (cf. Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir). Old \"Burush\" are reused for mending holes in the ceiling or for supporting small window openings in the rooms.\n\nAnother very specific mat has a circular shape with a central hole the size of a head. It is called Nutu' (نطع).\nOnce a week most Manasir women apply a \"smoke mask\" called \"Dukhan\" (دخّان) to their face and body. They burn the wood of Acacia seyal (\"Talh\"; طلح) in the kitchen hearth or a buried earthen pot in the courtyard. When the burning wood starts to produce smoke the woman will place herself on the \"Nutu\"' above the hole, covered by a big piece of coarse fabric and fumigate parts of her body until the upper skin peels off. As a result of this weekly procedure the colour of her skin will appear more pale (cf. CROWFOOT 1918:127-128). The \"Dukhan\" can also be used for medical purposes burning additional wood of Acacia ehrenbergiana (\"Salam\"; سلم) and Balanites aegyptiaca (\"Higlig\"; حجليج).\n\nOne very common household item made from palm leaflets is the Mi'laq (معلاق), also called Mishle'ib (مشلعيب).<br>\nIt is a simple loop big enough to hold a food container. It is made from two crossed straps of plaited palm leaflets. The \"Mi'laq\" is hanging freely from the ceiling, from wooden beams in the courtyard or in doorways. It is a simple and effective local utensil to protect small quantities of food from animals.\n\nAnother storage device made from palm leaflets is the Shedifah (شدفة), a tightly plaited container for storing sorghum (\"Dhurah\" or \"'Ayish\", ذرة or عيّش).\n\nFor their work on the fields the Manasir generally rely on a minimum of equipment. \nThe most important and much diversified objects are baskets made from palm leaflets. A multitude of different sizes with somehow similar shapes are in use, each type of basket meant for certain materials to be carried in.<br>\nThe Quffah (قفّة) is the most common basket and used for carrying dates and clothes.<br>\nThe Kunshibr (كونشبر) is a slightly smaller basket in which earth (\"Turab\", تراب) and manure (\"Maruq\"; ماروق) are transported (cf. NICHOLLS 1918:24). A proper builder and cultivator (\"Turbal\", تربال – both working with mud and therefore not further distinguished by the Manasir) is expected to employ his own \"Kunshibr\".<br>\n\nThe Ghutaiah (غتاية) is another very common small basket used to carry dates and seeds. Its size is exactly defined, since this basket is used as a local measurement for sorghum. \"Ghutaiat\" are exceptionally tightly plaited from leaflets of \"Gau\" palm trees (cf. Date cultivation in Dar al-Manasir).<br>\nThe Saqataiah (سقتاية) is a multipurpose basket, its size in-between a \"Quffah\" and a \"Ghutaiah\" (سقتاية لاها قفّة ولاها غتاية).\nSpecial baskets are used for mounting on animals. The Bedouin Manasir have large containers for transporting sorghum on the back of camels called Qalibah (قليبة).<br>\n\nA very particular funnellike basket is the Rahal (رحل). It is always used in pairs, attached to the sides of a donkey by placing a transverse wooden stick through their handles. \"Rahal\" are used to carry manure, mud or dates. The lower end of the funnel consists of a narrow hole (about 10 cm wide) that is plugged with a piece of cloth or \"Lif\" (ليف). In order to unload the cargo the plug is simply pulled out from below. Nowadays \"Rahal\" are mostly substituted by a combined pair of reworked plastic sacks of wheat.\n\nOther items plaited from palm leaflets are the Tabaq (طبق), a flat tray for winnowing wheat and sorghum during the threshing process and a small fan called Hebabah (هبابة), for heating the coal during the preparation of the traditional coffee (\"Gabenah\", جبنة).\n\nThe connective tissue between young fronds, which eventually develops into a dried brown vascular bundle of rough fibre, attached to the lower edges of the midribs ensheathing the trunk, makes up a very durable tough fibre (cf. ZAID 2002).\n\n\"Lif\" can be woven to different strengths of ropes called Hibal (sing. \"Hibl\", حبل). Ropes are used for the handles of baskets, the bridles for donkeys and camels, for carrying water containers attached to a stick and to string the frames of the traditional beds.\n\n\"Lif\", preferably from \"Gau\" date trees is also used as a soft but durable filling material called Lihaf (لحاف). Among the older Manasir \"Lihaf\" is preferred to cotton for filling mattresses and considered very healthy.\n\"Lif\" is further employed to fill of the lower parts of donkey saddles in order to prevent sores by friction and called Libdah (لبدة) or Bedidah (بديدة – the \"ة\" can be substituted by a \"ى\"). The Bedouin Manasir employ \"Lif\" for the same purpose in their camel saddles and call it Tillah (تلّة).\n\n\"Lif\" further plays an important role in the Sudanese coffee tradition as the straining plug Lifei (ليفي) in the spout of the \"Gabenah\" (جبنة).\n\nThe fruit bunch of the female palm tree is also called \"Shakhlub\" (شخلوب) and consists of a central stem and about 100 to 150 strands of spikelets.\n\nThe whole cluster can be used as a broom to sweep the ground whereby it is called Hanquqah (حنقوقة).\n\nBut also some of the finest basketry of the region is created by wrapping palm leaflets, preferably of the Dum palm around a strand of spikelets. The resulting strand is spirally plaited to dishes. They are either used as a Kabbet (كبّت) for covering meals or the earthen water containers (\"Sir\", زير), or as a Tabaq (طبق) in the shape of flat bowl for serving the traditional \"Kisrah\" bread (كسرة) on special occasions. The central part of \"Tabaqat\" can be worked from leather. Straps of cloth or plastic may be added to the leaflets in order to make the work more colourful and water resistant.\n\nApart from the listed by-products of palm trees, wood of other trees and the leather of the animals are used by the Manasir to manufacture tools and household items.\nThe finest but rarely found handicraft of the region are big bowls (Tabaq, طبق), skillfully crafted out of the soft wood of Faidherbia albida (\"Haraz\", حراز). \"Haraz\" wood is also used for the lower parts of donkey saddles. Nowadays the practise of fine wood carving has declined rapidly, one reason being the shortage of the particularly suitable \"Haraz\" tree.\n\nThe most common agricultural tools in Dar al-Manasir are the Turiah (طورية), a hoe with an angular blade that proves very functional in opening and closing irrigation channels, and a small sawed sickle. Whereas the blade of the \"Turiah\" is bought from outside and often even imported from China, all wooden handles are locally produced.\nA different local impediment entirely manufactured from wood is the rake-like Arbil (اربيل) used for levelling the ground.\n\nVery popular among the Bedouin Manasir is the Qirbah (قربة), a hose made from the entire skin of a goat. Filled with a liquid it becomes moist and flexible. The \"Qirbah\" is hung in a shady windy place, either from the ceiling, a beam or on a wooden tripod. Due to constant evaporation its content is cooled down considerably. The riverain Manasir employ the \"Qirbah\" primarily for cooling fermented milk since their water is cooled in huge permeable earthen jars called \"Sir\" (زير). These jars are placed in the shadow of a tree or lined up in a row in isolated covered mud structures called \"Masirah\" (مزيرة).\n\n[Information by 'Abdallah Ahmad al-Hassan Abu Qurun from Mideimir (عبدالله أحمد الحسن أبو قرون من مديمر) on the western bank of the Nile, Halimah Hassan al-'Aqib from Khaliwah (حليمة حسن العقيب من خليوة في سور) and Al-Tahir 'Uthman al-Tahir from Musari' (الطاهير عثمان الطاهير من مزارع في سور) on Sur Island]\n\n"}
{"id": "2001886", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2001886", "title": "Christopher Rice Mansel Talbot", "text": "Christopher Rice Mansel Talbot\n\nChristopher Rice Mansel Talbot FRS (10 May 1803 – 17 January 1890) was a Welsh landowner, industrialist and Liberal politician. He developed his estate at Margam near Swansea as an extensive ironworks, served by railways and a port, which was renamed Port Talbot. He served as a Member of Parliament for Glamorgan constituencies from 1830 until his death in 1890, a sixty-year tenure which made him the longest serving MP in the nineteenth century. He was Lord Lieutenant of Glamorgan, from 1848 to 1890.\n\nTalbot was descended from the Earls of Shrewsbury, through Hensol Castle, Talbot's Castle and Lacock Abbey. The family had bought Margam Abbey and its extensive parish of Margam during the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Having then married with the Mansels of Oxwich and Penrice, the Talbot's had become Glamorgan’s largest resident landowners, with estates totalling in that county alone. Their home estate at Margam included ancient metal workings, and extensive mineral rights across Margam, Kenfig and Aberavon. Talbot's father acquired the estate at Penrice, where having rebuilt Penrice Castle by 1820 the annual rent revenues reached £15,000.\n\nChristopher Rice Mansel Talbot was born at Penrice, Swansea, the son of Thomas Mansel Talbot, and Lady Mary Lucy, the daughter of Henry Fox-Strangways, 2nd Earl of Ilchester. When his father died in 1813, Christopher was only ten years old, so his estates at Penrice and Margam were held in trust until he came of age in 1824. His governess for some time was Agnes Porter. He was educated at a private school in Dorset, and then at Harrow School and Oriel College, Oxford, from where he graduated in 1824 with a 1st class honours degree in mathematics. He then undertook a Grand Tour of Europe. His favourite activities were yachting, racing and hunting. In 1823 he was elected a member of the Royal Yacht Club (later the Royal Yacht Squadron), and he was its Vice Commodore from 1851 to 1861.\n\nNine members of the Mansel family had sat in Parliament from the early sixteenth century and the family were seen in aristocratic circles as Glamorganshire's natural representatives at Westminster. Talbot's father, however, had shown no interest in becoming an MP but after his death in 1813, the family reasserted its political influences when his mother's second husband, Sir Christopher Cole was elected as county member in 1817. This was commonly regarded as a family arrangement until C.R.M. Talbot was ready to enter political life.\n\nEven in 1817, however, there was some opposition to Cole's election. At the meeting in Bridgend where the new member was returned unopposed, George Tennant, a Swansea industrialist, struck a note of discontent.\n\nWill you not, at some convenient time, avail yourself of those well-known means which are always at hand to enable you to retire from your post, when the infant legislator of the House of Margam shall be ripe for action, and thus surrender back the situation which you hold as a trust for that family by, whose interests you have been principally supported throughout the present election.\n\nAs widely expected therefore, Talbot virtually inherited the role of Member of Parliament for Glamorganshire in 1830 upon the retirement of his stepfather. Although nominally considered a Liberal, Talbot exercised considerable independence for most of his long political career, and his freedom to operate outside of party structures only became limited by the parliamentary reforms which occurred in the latter part of his time in the Commons, where he remained for the rest of his life. \n\nAlthough firmly of the Whig wing of the Liberal Party, Talbot had shown signs of support for more radical policies long before the Gladstonian takeover of the party in the 1860s. In 1853 he voted in favour of the ballot. Two years later he supported the abolition of church rates, and in 1856, voted along with the Swansea member Lewis Llewelyn Dillwyn in support of Irish disestablishment.\n\nTalbot recognised that improved transport could stimulate industrial growth, and as Member of Parliament he introduced a Bill in 1834 to improve the old harbour at Aberavon; two years later, a further Bill provided for the harbour's expansion and a change of name to Port Talbot in his honour. He also encouraged the development of Swansea docks, and pioneered the introduction of railways to south Wales, being chairman and a shareholder in the South Wales Railway Company, which was acquired by the Great Western Railway in 1863, with Talbot joining the board of the GWR.\n\nTalbot also invested in the area's extractive and metal production industries. The Port Talbot ironworks opened in early 1831, part of the industrialisation then taking place across south Wales; copper had been smelted at nearby Neath since 1584, and there were tinworks and ironworks at Pontardawe.\n\nIn 1869 aboard his private yacht Lynx he attended the opening of the Suez Canal, accompanied by members of his family and several guests. When he was in Egypt, Gladstone offered him a peerage, but he declined on this and two other occasions. He was adjudged the wealthiest commoner of his time.\n\nOver a ten-year period from 1830, Talbot set about redeveloping the family estate at Margam Castle. The mansion was designed in the Tudor Gothic style by architect Thomas Hopper (1776–1856), while Edward Haycock (1790–1870) was supervisory architect and designed parts of the interior and exterior of the house, the stables, terraces and lodges. Talbot also took a keen interest in the project, encouraging his architects to borrow elements from Lacock Abbey in Wiltshire (ancestral home of the Talbots and home to his cousin William Henry Fox Talbot) and Melbury House in Dorset (home of his mother's family, the Fox-Strangways, Earls of Ilchester). Margam Castle is a Grade I listed building owned by Neath and Port Talbot County Borough council.\n\nTalbot encouraged his relations William Fox Talbot and John Talbot Dillwyn Llewellyn in the development of photography and was himself a Fellow of the Royal Society.\n\nTalbot, like his fellow county member, Sir Hussey Vivian, were not opposed to parliamentary reform. The Reform Acts of 1867 and 1884, together with the redistribution of boundaries for the 1885 General Election, led to the enfranchisement of increasing numbers of industrial workers. In time this was to revolutionise the politics of Glamorgan, but the immediate impact was to increase the Liberal Party's hold on the county and make the election of a Conservative, in most seats, almost inconceivable.\n\nOn redistribution of parliamentary seats in 1885, he was elected for Mid Glamorganshire, a predominantly mining constituency, which included the Llynfi, Garw and Ogmore valleys Despite his venerable status the Liberal Association initially considered other candidates including Gwilym Williams and J. Carvell Williams.\n\nTalbot, at this time, was asked by William Abraham for his views on the election of labour representatives to the House of Commons, and specifically the desirability of a labour member representing the new Rhondda constituency. Talbot replied as follows:\n\nI am of opinion that there has always hitherto been a great dearth of such members in the House of Commons, and that if a few really able men were elected, the proceedings in Parliament would be all the more likely to give satisfaction to the bulk of the labouring classes. We have plenty of employers of labour in the House, and many amongst them who profess to have the interest of their men at heart, and we have also a large number who from sentimental or philosophical motives advocate the promotion of the welfare of the people. But none of these men possess that intimate acquaintance with the peculiarities and specialties of mining operations which men who have themselves had experience as workmen in the mine have acquired, and they are often led in consequence to legislate on what they believe to be the interest of their constituents, but in what really is to their injury. Hence it is that I believe the presence of real working men in the House would be of vast advantage to the community at large, and I should be very glad to hear that the electors in the new Rhondda division entertained the same feeling, and were likely to send one of their own body to represent them.\n\nEven though Talbot had reconciled himself with Gladstonian Liberalism to a significant extent, he had very little time for subjects relating specifically to Wales. He refused to take any part in the campaigns for Welsh disestablishment and Welsh intermediate education, in contrast to his fellow Glamorgan member, Hussey Vivian. Above all, he was firmly opposed to the Cymru Fydd movement. which demanded Welsh Home Rule.\n\nHaving initially opposed Irish Home Rule, there was criticism of his standpoint, particularly in the Maesteg area. He complained to his fellow county member, Hussey Vivian, that he had a meeting with Maesteg Liberals and although they were friendly to his face, 'I am told that [they] became quarrelsome after I left, and suggested various substitutes'. A few weeks later, however, a meeting of the Association at Briton Ferry which, significantly, was not attended by delegates from some industrial districts, unanimously re-adopted Talbot, stating that he had 'made great progress towards the views they, as an association, held'.\n\nAlthough at heart a Liberal Unionist, Talbot also supported a range of Gladstonian policies and this was undoubtedly a factor in preventing opposition at the 1886 General Election.\n\nHe retained his seat until his death, becoming Father of the House of Commons. He was described as \"a tall, elderly gentleman ... wearing a long woollen comforter\" in Sir Henry Lucy's Diary of the Salisbury Parliament for 10 June 1888 which was published in book form in 1892.\n\nTalbot was the last Whig aristocratic landowner to represent Glamorgan in the House of Commons and, upon his death in 1890, he was succeeded by Samuel Thomas Evans, the nonconformist son of a Skewen tradesman, and a prominent radical.\n\nOn 31 October 1880, Talbot laid the foundation stone of Maesteg Town Hall, Maesteg. He gave £500 (£ today) towards the building fund, and the miners of the valley agreed to levy themselves a day's wages towards the cost.\n\nIn Llanfair, his name still survives in \"Talbot Terrace\". In 1865 there was a public house in the village called the \"Talbot Arms.\"\n\nTalbot married Lady Charlotte Butler, daughter of Richard Butler, 1st Earl of Glengall, at Cahir House, County Tipperary on 28 December 1835. She died at Malta on 23 March 1846, where the Talbots were on their yacht \"Galatea\".\n\nTalbot's only son Theodore died in 1876 following a hunting accident. Hence the dedication to St. Theodore of an Anglo- Catholic parish in the east of Port Talbot It was therefore his daughter Emily Charlotte Talbot (1840–1918) who inherited her father's fortune and became just as notable in the development of ports and railways. Another daughter, Olive Talbot, founded an Anglican theological college in Aberdare subsequently moved to Cardiff Road, Llandaff St. Michael's College. Lt.-Col. Sir John Mansel Miller was his great-grandson.\n\n"}
{"id": "2001887", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2001887", "title": "Duets (film)", "text": "Duets (film)\n\nDuets is a 2000 American road trip film co-produced and directed by Bruce Paltrow and written by John Byrum. The motion picture features an ensemble cast co-starring Gwyneth Paltrow, Paul Giamatti, Maria Bello, Scott Speedman, Andre Braugher, Huey Lewis and Angie Dickinson, among others. The movie \"revolves around the little known world of karaoke competitions and the wayward characters who inhabit it.\"\n\nThe story revolves around unrelated pairs of people who spend time in karaoke bars across the United States in the week leading up to a big contest in Omaha.\n\nAll three pairs end up at the Omaha contest, each having won the right to compete there for $5,000 by virtue of winning in a smaller town. Finally accepting his daughter, Ricky invites her to perform a duet of her mother's favourite song, \"Cruisin'\". Billy discovers that Suzi's confidence is fake when he finds her in the ladies' room, vomiting from stage fright, but he convinces her to compete. Reggie sees the police arrive, investigating the service station shooting. He performs an a cappella version of \"Free Bird\" before pulling a gun on stage, prompting police to shoot him; this gives Todd a chance to put the full blame for the service station shooting on Reggie, which frees Todd to return to his old life.\n\nAfter the contest, Billy and Suzi continue on their way to California. Billy invites Liv (with whom he had been flirting with at the contest) and Ricky to join them, and they resolve to take a slight detour to another karaoke contest in Nevada. Todd and Candy contemplate reconciliation, but the fate of their relationship is left open.\n\n\nThis was the only time Gwyneth Paltrow and her producer/director father Bruce Paltrow worked together on a film project, and it was also Bruce Paltrow's last production before his death.\n\nBrad Pitt was first cast in Speedman's role, but, after he and Gwyneth Paltrow announced the end of their off-camera romance, Pitt decided not to take the role.\n\nThe film locations include Las Vegas, Nevada; British Columbia, Canada; and Los Angeles, California.\n\nFilm critic Roger Ebert gave the film a thumbs down on his television program, and wrote on his newspaper review, \"\"Duets\" has little islands of humor and even perfection, floating in a sea of missed marks and murky intentions.\" Kenneth Turan, film critic for the \"Los Angeles Times\", described the film as \"six characters in search of a movie. Any movie will do...\"\n\nCritic Bob Graham, writing for the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", liked the spirit of the film and the acting, and he wrote, \"Cut 'Duets' some slack. This is an appealing, and ultimately moving, ensemble comedy/drama about ordinary folks whose one chance at anything resembling stardom is a karaoke contest...The fable style is a fragile one. The \"Ally McBeal\" test probably applies here. Fans of that show are likely to give themselves over to \"Duets,\" too.\"\n\n\"Variety\" critic Todd McCarthy singled out Giamatti's work and character, writing, \"Giamatti gets the lion's share of Byrum's good lines and if the film is to go over with auds, it will be largely due to this character and performance, which reps one of the funniest sustained rants against the lowest common denominator in American culture that has been seen in ages.\"\n\nOverall, many critics echoed Stephanie Zacharek's review in \"Salon.com\". She wrote, \"Its three interlocking stories don't find the right rhythmic balance, and some of the dialogue is stiff and mannered.\" Zacharek did praise the acting and the film's message. She added, \"In that respect, the way \"Duets\" treats its characters is refreshing. There are brief moments when it reminds us that plenty of people enjoy karaoke at the expense of their audience (during one scene an Asian businessman warbles tunelessly in the background), but \"Duets\" isn't out to make anyone look ridiculous.\"\n\nThe producers marketed the film using the following tagline:\n\nThe film was first presented at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2000. When released, \"Duets\" suffered at the box office. The first week's gross sales at the box office was $2,002,588 (581 screens) and the total receipts for the run were $4,734,235.\n\nIn its widest release the film was featured in 583 theaters and the film was in circulation for seven weeks. The production budget was $16,000,000.\n\nA DVD of the film was released on May 8, 2001 by Hollywood Pictures Home Entertainment. The DVD contained additional features: a commentary track by director Bruce Paltrow and producer Kevin Jones, additional scenes, conversations with director Bruce Paltrow, and a multi-angle music video of \"Cruisin'\".\n\nAn original motion picture soundtrack album was released on September 12, 2000, by Hollywood Records. The CD contained twelve tracks, including the original music composed for the film by David Newman.\n\nThe actors who sang their own tunes in the film, and included on the CD, are: Huey Lewis, Gwyneth Paltrow, Paul Giamatti, and Maria Bello. Arnold McCuller sings all of Andre Braugher's songs including Lynyrd Skynyrd's \"Free Bird\", performed \"a cappella\".\n\nThe soundtrack spawned two hit singles in Australia, with Gwyneth Paltrow and Huey Lewis' \"Cruisin'\" spending two weeks at No. 1 in Australia and five weeks at No. 1 in New Zealand, with Paltrow's \"Bette Davis Eyes\" also becoming a top 3 hit in Australia.\n\nMichael Bublé has a cameo singing \"Strangers in the Night\", but the song is not included on the soundtrack.\n\n"}

He also served as Adjutant General of the State of Maryland.\n\nReckord was born to John and Lydia (Zimmerman) Reckord at their home in Harford County, Maryland. He commenced work at his father's milling plant in 1896 upon his graduation from Bel Air High School.\n\nReckord expressed desire to serve in the military, but, at the request of his mother, delayed entry into service until he turned 21. He enlisted in Company D, 1st Maryland Infantry, Maryland National Guard on February 15, 1901, and would eventually rise to command the same company when he was commissioned as a captain in December 1904. As a major, in 1916, Reckord was given command of the 2nd Battalion, 1st Maryland Infantry, which deployed to the Mexican border and served in the Mexican Expedition commanded by Gen. John J. Pershing. When the 29th Infantry Division was created on the eve of World War I in 1917, Reckord was given command of one of its regiments, the 115th Infantry, which saw combat during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. In 1920, he was appointed Adjutant General of the Maryland National Guard and, in 1934, while still serving as Maryland's Adjutant General, he assumed command of the 29th Infantry Division.\n\nDuring the years between the First and Second World War, Reckord was a leading advocate for increasing the role of the National Guard in the United States' national defensive strategy. From 1923 to 1925, he served as president of the National Guard Association of the United States. In 1933, he authored legislation that permanently gave National Guard personnel status as both state and federal troops. \n\nReckord was mobilized for World War II with the 29th Infantry Division in February 1941 and took a leave of absence from his post as Maryland's Adjutant General. Deemed by the Army to be too old to command a division in combat, he was relieved of command and assigned as the commander of the III Corps Area. He later deployed overseas and was named Theater Provost Marshal, European Theater of Operations.\n\nAfter World War II, Reckord returned to his post as the Adjutant General of Maryland. He received a state promotion to Lieutenant General from Governor J. Millard Tawes in 1961, and continued to serve as Adjutant General until his retirement in 1966.\n\nRecord died at Fort Howard Veterans Hospital in Fort Howard, Maryland on September 8, 1975. He was buried at Mountain Christian Church Cemetery in Joppa, Maryland.\n\nIn 1910, Reckord married Bessie Payne Roe. They were the parents of a daughter, Gladys Atchison Reckord. Mrs. Reckord died on January 17, 1943, and Reckord never remarried. After retiring, he resided in Ruxton, Maryland with his daughter and her husband, H. Frederick Jones Jr.\n\nIn his military life, Reckord was a leader of the National Guard Association of the United States (NGAUS), and served as its president from 1923 to 1925. In the years after World War II, Reckord was chairman of the NGAUS Committee on Legislation, and was the first individual to be appointed a life member of the NGAUS Executive Council. He was also a member of the Adjutants General Association of the United States (AGAUS), the 29th Infantry Division Association, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Military Order of Foreign Wars, and the Army and Navy Club.\n\nIn his civilian life, Reckord was a member of the National Rifle Association (NRA) beginning in 1920, and served on the organization's Executive Council and as its executive vice president. He served as president of both the Maryland Jockey Club, which owned Pimlico Race Course, and the Hartford Agricultural and Breeders Association, which owned Havre de Grace Racetrack. In addition, he belonged to the Freemasons, Maryland Club, Baltimore Country Club, Advertising Club of Baltimore, and Racquet Club of Washington, D.C.\n\nThe Reckord Trophy is a prize awarded annually to the Army National Guard battalion(s) that achieves the highest standards of training and readiness. \nThe Reckord Trophy is one of the highest peacetime awards given to National Guard units.\nThe Reckord Armory at the University of Maryland is named after General Reckord.\n\nReckord was the recipient of several honorary degrees, including: Franklin & Marshall College (LL.D., 1943); Western Maryland College (Doctor of Military Science and Tactics, 1943); the University of Maryland (LL.D., 1944); and Pennsylvania Military College (LL.D., 1944).\n\nReckord Armory, a recreation and athletics building on the campus of the University of Maryland, College Park, was named for Reckord in 1961.\n\nThere is also a National Guard facility in the town of Bel Air, Maryland known as Reckord Armory. No longer used for military activities, it is now a facility for public events including weddings, trade shows, and business meetings.\n\nIn 1950, Reckord was the first recipient of the National Guard Association of the United States Distinguished Service Medal.

{"id": "2001889", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2001889", "title": "Virginia–Highland", "text": "Virginia–Highland\n\nVirginia–Highland (often nicknamed \"VaHi\") is an affluent neighborhood of Atlanta, Georgia, founded in the early 20th century as a streetcar suburb. It is named after the intersection of Virginia Avenue and North Highland Avenue, the heart of its trendy retail district at the center of the neighborhood. The neighborhood is famous for its bungalows and other historic houses from the 1910s to the 1930s. It has become a destination for people across Atlanta with its eclectic mix of restaurants, bars, and shops as well as for the Summerfest festival, annual Tour of Homes and other events.\n\nIn 2011 readers of \"Creative Loafing\" voted Virginia–Highland \"Best Overall Neighborhood.\" In June 2011, \"Atlanta\" Magazine designated Virginia Highland \"favorite neighborhood overall\". In 2012 readers of \"Creative Loafing\" voted VaHi \"Best Walkable Neighborhood\".\n\nNewspaper articles from the early 1920s refer to the \"Virginia Highland\" section of Atlanta with regard to the area around the intersection of Virginia and Highland avenues. Later in the 1920s, southeast of this intersection, the \"Virginia Highlands\" (with an \"s\") subdivision was built. However, neither term appeared again in the press until the 1970s.\n\nDuring the revolt against the construction of the I-485 freeway through Morningside and what is now Virginia–Highland, a pro-highway group called themselves the \"Highland–Virginia Civic Association\", claiming to speak for the neighborhood. When Joe Drolet and other residents formed a group to oppose the highway in Fall 1971, they chose the name \"Virginia–Highland Civic Association\". With the victory of the anti-highway forces, the Virginia–Highland name stuck and the press started to use it to refer to the entire neighborhood between Amsterdam, Ponce, Piedmont Park and Druid Hills.\n\nAround Atlanta, \"Virginia–Highland\", \"Virginia Highlands\" and \"the Highlands\" are all commonly heard. However, \"Virginia–Highland\" is the official name of the neighborhood. The other terms are included in some business names, but are incorrect.\n\nThe term VaHi, imitating the New York style of naming neighborhoods (SoHo, TriBeCa), first was used in the Atlanta newspapers in 1998. It is now in common use as a shortened, playful form or in URLs of neighborhood media and organizations (examples are www.vahi.org, www.vahinews.com and vahi.patch.com).\n\nThe first record of settlement of the area that is now Virginia–Highland was in 1812, when William Zachary bought and built a farm on of land there. In 1822 he sold his farm to Richard Copeland Todd (1792–1850). Todd's brother-in-law Hardy Ivy settled in 1832 in what is now Downtown Atlanta and the road between their two farms came to be known as Todd Road (a portion of which still exists in VirginiaºHighland).\n\nIn the 1880s, Georgia Railroad executive Richard Peters and real estate developer George Washington Adair organized the Atlanta Street Railway Company. Their first project was the Nine Mile Trolley, which started serving the area sometime between 1888 and 1890. At first, patrons used this streetcar line to visit \"the countryside\" outside the city, and the line stimulated later development in the area. Adair built his home at 964 Rupley Drive (still standing and divided into upscale apartments). The iconic curves in the street at the intersections of Virginia Ave. with N. Highland and Monroe are remnants of the trolley line, which required gentle curves. The Trolley Square Apartments (now \"Virginia Highlands [sic] Apartments\") near Virginia and Monroe were built on the site of trolley maintenance facilities.\n\nThe first land to be subdivided in what is now Virginia–Highland was Highland Park in the 1890s, located on either side of Ponce de Leon Ave. between today's Barnett St. and N. Highland Ave. The majority of the houses and streets in Virginia–Highland were constructed between 1909 and 1926. In 1916 the Arc Light Controversy raged between neighbors on Adair Ave. and N. Highland Ave.\n\nSome businesses opened around the intersection of Virginia and N. Highland starting in 1908, with many more opening starting in 1925. At the same time development started in the Atkins Park commercial district around St. Charles. Ave. and N. Highland, including the present-day Atkins Park Restaurant (1922), which reportedly got what is now Atlanta's oldest liquor license when it became a bar and restaurant in 1927. Between 1928 and 1930, the Howard Dry Cleaning Company and the Phelps Millard Grocery opened, anchoring the Amsterdam and N. Highland business district. The Samuel N. Inman School, named after the nineteenth-century cotton merchant, was built in 1923. In 1924, fire station 19 was built on N. Highland at Los Angeles Ave.\n\nStreetcar service to Virginia–Highland ended around 1947, along with all of the other trolley lines into and out of central Atlanta.\n\nVirginia–Highland, like most intown Atlanta neighborhoods, suffered decline starting in the 1960s as residents moved to the suburbs. Less-affluent residents moved in, some single-family houses were turned into apartments, and crime increased. Some businesses closed and were replaced by lower-rent tenants such as pawn shops. Others, such as Moe’s and Joe’s (which opened in 1947) and Atkins Park Restaurant, stayed open. Many buildings deteriorated.\n\nWhat could have been the death knell for the neighborhood sounded in the mid-1960s, when the Georgia Department of Transportation proposed building Interstate 485 to connect what is now Freedom Parkway through the neighborhood and to what is now Georgia 400 at Interstate 85. It would have included an interchange at Virginia Avenue where John Howell Memorial Park is today. Despite the I-485 proposal moving forward, a few middle-class families began moving back into the neighborhood, renovating homes.\n\nIn Fall 1971, Joseph (Joe) Drolet and others founded the Virginia–Highland Civic Association (VHCA), whose mission was to defeat I-485, and registered the association with the Georgia Secretary of State on August 22, 1972. They along with residents of Stone Mountain, Inman Park, and Morningside finally defeated I-485, and became a political force to be reckoned with. The current Neighborhood Planning Unit (NPU) system is an outgrowth of these events. In 2009, the original north/south freeway (connecting 675 to 400) was again put on GDOT's to-do list, but this time running in a tunnel underneath the neighborhoods, with buildings to vent exhaust fumes and smog above ground.\n\nBetween 1972 and 1975, property values increased from 20 to 50 percent. Home ownership levels rose 20 percent. A tour of renovated homes started in 1972. The Georgia Department of Transportation began selling properties it had acquired for I-485, virtually all of them for infill housing. The of land on Virginia Avenue where 11 houses had been taken and demolished to make way for a Virginia Avenue exit, however, was finally opened in 1988 as John Howell Memorial Park, in memory of Virginia–Highland resident and anti-freeway activist John Howell, who died from complications of HIV in 1988.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s the VHCA also worked to improve the city's process of home inspection, to develop a resource network of quality, affordable service providers to aid homeowners in renovation, and to encourage developers to lease renovated commercial buildings “as is” at low rates in order to encourage new and unique businesses, and thus a truly distinct commercial district.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Atkins Park restaurant was renovated. Meanwhile, Stuart Meddin bought and renovated the 1925 commercial block at North Highland and Virginia.\n\nIn 1988, the turn-of-the-century trolley barns on on Virginia Avenue on the east side of the BeltLine Eastside Trail (today's Virginia–Highland Apartments) were torn down despite the City Council and VHCA's attempts to save them. Although previously assuring local residents that he favored saving the historic structures, Mayor Andrew Young then vetoed the resolution, and the Council's vote of 11-3 was not enough to override it. Young cited the discovery of asbestos in the buildings and other hazardous materials on the property.\n\nAs the neighborhood continued to regentrify, property values increased rapidly; the shops and restaurants became progressively more upscale. Towards the end of the 90s, the neighborhood-oriented character of the business districts gave way to businesses serving patrons from across greater Atlanta. Virginia–Highland wrestled with traffic and parking issues. Apartments affordable to students became more difficult to find.\n\nIn 2000, a spat among organizers and a shakeup in the organizing committee made local headlines. However, Summerfest did continue as usual in 2001 as one of Atlanta's highest profile neighborhood festivals.\n\nIn November 2006, the Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation added Virginia–Highland to its list of \"places in peril\" due to an acceleration of teardowns and infill projects by real estate developers and newcomers to the area. However, Virginia–Highland remains one of the most architecturally historic, distinct and vibrant neighborhoods in Atlanta.\n\nResidents, through the VHCA, succeeded in getting the city council to pass zoning legislation prescribing development that fits the scale of the streets, rolling back loose zoning ordinances passed in the 1960s. The new zoning also prescribes a maximum number of each type of establishment – restaurants, bars, retail and other types.\n\nThe zoning aims to preserve a vibrant mix of enterprises while keeping control noise, parking and traffic issues but also addresses specific problems which came up in 2005-2008:\n\nIn December 2008 the VHCA bought the land for New Highland Park, a small park at N. Highland and St. Charles.\n\nIn Autumn 2010, a rash of seven muggings occurred, statistics which were far lower than those of the 1980s when the neighborhood was edgy, but in 2010 shaking up the neighborhood. Partly in response, the local security patrol, FBAC, expanded patrol coverage to the entire neighborhood. Shortly thereafter in Nov. 2010 Charles Boyer was murdered during a mugging, for which the \"Jack Boys\" were indicted in Jan. 2011. Police continued to step up patrols and since then Virginia–Highland has returned to its status as one of Atlanta's lower-crime neighborhoods.\n\nCurrently the neighborhood is enjoying adjacent development projects including a new biking and walking trail along the BeltLine Eastside Trail from Piedmont Park to Inman Park, as well as the redeveloped Ponce City Market, the old Sears building, now a major multi-use development. Behind Ponce City Market is Historic Fourth Ward Park, opened in 2011.\n\nIn July 2014 the Atlanta City Council accepted the Virginia–Highland Civic Association's master plan, as a result of which the plan becomes part of the City of Atlanta’s Comprehensive Development Plan.\n\nVirginia–Highland is bounded on the north by Amsterdam Avenue and the neighborhood of Morningside, on the east by the Atlanta city limit/Briarcliff Road and the Druid Hills neighborhood, on the south by Ponce de Leon Avenue and the Poncey–Highland neighborhood, and on the west by the BeltLine Eastside Trail which is the border with Piedmont Park and Midtown.\n\nWithin these boundaries is Atkins Park, a neighborhood listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The City of Atlanta recognizes Atkins Park as a separate neighborhood, however, Atkins Park is a part of the Virginia–Highland Civic Association.\n\nSt. Charles-Greenwood had its own neighborhood association in the 1980s, but was then absorbed into Virginia–Highland.\n\nVirginia–Highland is one of many intown Atlanta neighborhoods characterized by commercial space of two sorts:\n\nSuch \"streetcar corner\" nodes are located at Virginia at North Highland — the neighborhood's namesake and main shopping and dining area, well known since the 1990s for its restaurants, St. Charles at North Highland, Amsterdam at North Highland, and Virginia at Rosedale Drive. Amsterdam Walk, a shopping and entertainment complex built in what was originally part of the Campbell Coal Company warehouse. Ponce de Leon Place also has a concentration of warehouse space converted to commercial use.\n\nJust across the BeltLine Eastside Trail from the western border of Virginia–Highland are two major strip malls, Midtown Place and Midtown Promenade. Adjacent is the former Sears building, now Ponce City Market, with office, retail and residential space, and a gourmet food hall.\n\nVirginia–Highland is best known for its oldest residences – the Craftsman bungalows that line the streets closest to which or on which the Nine Mile trolley ran: Virginia Avenue, North Highland Avenue, St. Charles Avenue, etc. Other architectural styles include English Vernacular Revival and Colonial Revival, and other house types include English Cottage and American Foursquare.\n\nBesides the churches noted below, some other landmarks of note are:\n\nVirginia–Highland and Atkins Park are both listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), with Atkins Park having in addition the status of historic overlay district which, unlike a NRHP listing by itself, actually provides for measures to enforce preservation. The VHCA is investigating the possibilities of designating Virginia–Highland a historic overlay district as well.\n\nVirginia–Highland is a neighborhood of Atlanta, which unlike in many other cities, are officially defined and organized and given specific areas of control. The Virginia–Highland Civic Association consists of a volunteer board and oversees matters controlled at the neighborhood level such as community festivals, community safety, beautification, and efforts to improve parks, sidewalks, etc. As noted above, the Atkins Park neighborhood, while having its own neighborhoods association, participates in the VaHi association much as if it were part of VaHi. Planning, building permits, etc. are controlled by the Neighborhood planning unit F, which also includes Morningside-Lenox Park, Piedmont Heights and Lindridge-Martin Manor.\n\nVirginia–Highland serves as a model for other neighborhoods of Atlanta in implementing a comprehensive range of safety measures:\n\nVirginia–Highland borders:\n\nWithin the boundaries of Virginia–Highland are:\n\nIn 2014, residents cleaned up and beautified the unpaved alley between St. Charles Avenue and Ponce, and it is now known as Maiden Trail.\n\nVirginia–Highland has one of seven Atlanta \"neighborhood arboreta\", which are in fact walking routes of trees (identified by markers) in yards, sidewalk planting strips, and parks. A brochure maps out the route and the trees along each route, as well as educating visitors about the trees.\n\nThe VHCA hosts the yearly Virginia–Highland Summerfest arts and music festival, which also includes a popular road race, and is one of the largest art festivals in the Southeastern United States and one of Atlanta's most popular neighborhood festivals. VHCA also organizes the annual Virginia–Highland Tour of Homes. In May, Taste of the Highlands in John Howell Park features samplings from favorite neighborhood restaurants and live music. Every March or April, the North Highland Mile (formerly Morningside Mile) race and block party takes place.\n\nPortions of the films \"Life as We Know It\" (the bakery portrayed was the real-life Belly General Store) and \"Trouble with the Curve\" (George's restaurant) were filmed in Virginia–Highland. Portions of the pilot for the \"B.E.T.\" network's \"Being Mary Jane\" were filmed at 780 N. Highland Ave. in April 2012.\n\nVirginia–Highland is home to a number of churches:\n\nThe Chabad Intown synagogue is located on Ponce de Leon Avenue.\n\nThe Virginia–Highland eruv covers nearly all of Virginia–Highland as well as part of the Morningside-Lenox Park neighborhood up to E. Rock Springs Road/E. Morningside Drive. The eruv is \"marked off\" by defining utility poles as \"sides of the doorways\" and the wires as the \"lintels\" (tops of doorways). Within its boundaries observant Jews are allowed to do certain things on the Sabbath that they would not normally be allowed to do outside the home, such as carry keys or food.\n\nThe community is zoned to Atlanta Public Schools.\n\nZoned schools include:\n\nVirginia–Highland is served by the following MARTA bus routes which also connect it to MARTA rail lines:\n\nThe neighborhood was long served by streetcar line #15 which later became bus line #45. Bus line 45 was discontinued in 2010.\n\nNoted residents of Virginia–Highland, past and present, include:\n\n\nNeighborhood organizations and events\n\nAbout Virginia–Highland\n"}

Substituting this into the above we get\n\nand any curl-free vector can be written as the gradient of a scalar, hence\n\nwhere formula_10 is the electric scalar potential. These relationships now allow us to write\n\nwhere formula_12, which can be rewritten by vector identity as\n\nAs we have only specified the curl of A, we are free to define the divergence, and choose the following:\n\nwhich is called the Lorenz gauge condition. The previous expression for A now reduces to\n\nwhich is the vector Helmholtz equation. The solution of this equation for A is\n\nwhere formula_17 is the three-dimensional homogeneous Green's function given by\n\nWe can now write what is called the electric field integral equation (EFIE), relating the electric field E to the vector potential A\n\nWe can further represent the EFIE in the dyadic form as\n\nwhere formula_21 here is the dyadic homogeneous Green's Function given by\n\nThe EFIE describes a radiated field E given a set of sources J, and as such it is the fundamental equation used in antenna analysis and design. It is a very general relationship that can be used to compute the radiated field of any sort of antenna once the current distribution on it is known. The most important aspect of the EFIE is that it allows us to solve the radiation/scattering problem in an unbounded region, or one whose boundary is located at infinity. For closed surfaces, it is possible to use the Magnetic Field Integral Equation or the Combined Field Integral Equation, both of which result in a set of equations with improved condition number compared to the EFIE. However, the MFIE and CFIE can still contain resonances.\n\nIn scattering problems, it is desirable to determine an unknown scattered field formula_23 that is due to a known incident field formula_24. Unfortunately, the EFIE relates the \"scattered\" field to J, not the incident field, so we do not know what J is. This sort of problem can be solved by imposing the boundary conditions on the incident and scattered field, allowing one to write the EFIE in terms of formula_24 and J alone. Once this has been done, the integral equation can then be solved by a numerical technique appropriate to integral equations such as the method of moments.\n\nBy the Helmholtz theorem a vector field is described completely by its divergence and curl. As the divergence was not defined, we are justified by choosing the Lorenz Gauge condition above provided that we consistently use this definition of the divergence of A in all subsequent analysis. However, other choices for formula_26 are just as valid and lead to other equations, which all describe the same phenomena, and the solutions of the equations for any choice of formula_26 lead to the same electromagnetic fields, and the same physical predictions about the fields and charges are accelerated by them.\n\nIt is natural to think that if a quantity exhibits this degree of freedom in its choice, then it should not be interpreted as a real physical quantity. After all, if we can freely choose formula_26 to be anything, then formula_29 is not unique. One may ask: what is the \"true\" value of formula_29 measured in an experiment? If formula_29 is not unique, then the only logical answer must be that we can never measure the value of formula_29. On this basis, it is often stated that it is not a real physical quantity and it is believed that the fields formula_33 and formula_34 are the true physical quantities.\n\nHowever, there is at least one experiment in which value of the formula_33 and formula_34 are both zero at the location of a charged particle, but it is nevertheless affected by the presence of a local magnetic vector potential; see the Aharonov–Bohm effect for details. Nevertheless, even in the Aharonov–Bohm experiment, the divergence formula_29 never enters the calculations; only formula_38 along the path of the particle determines the measurable effect.\n\n"}

Its main neighbours are Westbury on Trym, Horfield, Bishopston and Redland. \n\nHenleaze is also the name of a ward for Bristol City Council, which includes Golden Hill and Westbury Park as well as Henleaze.\n\nThe name of Henleaze probably derives from a Robert Henley, who in 1659 bought a property which became known as Henley's House and later as Henleaze Park. The area was a rural part of the parish of Westbury on Trym until 1896, when land between Henleaze Road and Durdham Down was sold for development. Most of the rest of the area was developed in the 1920s.\n\nHenleaze is in the Bristol North West constituency, and the MP for the area is Darren Jones, for Labour. There are three seats on Bristol City Council for the Westbury-on-Trym & Henleaze ward, one held by Liberal Democrats and two by the Conservatives as of the 2016 elections. Up until the early 1990s, it was a solid Conservative area, however The Liberal Democrats established a more solid position up until 2006, when it began to swing back to the Conservatives. In the 2009 elections, when the Liberal Democrats took control of the City Council, Liz Radford a local campaigner achieved an unprecedented swing in the ward for the Conservatives. Henleaze would have fallen to them if the swing had been just 1.5% higher.\n\nHenleaze is one of the most affluent areas of the city. Among the thirty-five wards into which Bristol is divided, it had the fifth lowest proportion of people in routine and semi-routine occupations, according to the 2001 census, and the fifth highest proportion with higher education qualifications.\n\nHenleaze Lake, a flooded former quarry on the northern edge of Henleaze near Southmead and Westbury on Trym, is owned by the Charity (No 1132633) \"Henleaze Swimming Club\" since 2009 and celebrated its Centenary in 2019 \n\nThe other former quarry was filled in and made into a park, now known as Old Quarry Park. It was recently renovated with the help of a grant from the National Lottery for the provision of play equipment, seating and flower beds.\n\nHenleaze also features newsagents, bakeries, supermarkets and charity-shops, as well as a library, the Orpheus cinema which is run by 'King' Harold and Scott Cinemas and the Den (Est 2007). Henleaze Old Boys Cricket Club was formed in 2005 and play at the neighbouring Golden Hill Cricket ground. The membership of the club is primarily former Henleaze Junior School pupils. The is also a thriving Tennis Club based in Tennessee Grove with 4 outdoor courts and planning permission for floodlighting one has recently been granted.\n\nHenleaze parish church, St Peter's, was designed and built in 1926 by A. V. Gough. Trinity-Henleaze United Reformed Church was built in 1907 (as Henleaze Congregational Church) and designed by Frank Wills, who designed many Bristol churches.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2001907", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2001907", "title": "Zheng Keshuang", "text": "Zheng Keshuang\n\nZheng Keshuang, Prince of Yanping (; 13 August 1670 – 22 September 1707), courtesy name Shihong, art name Huitang, was the third and last ruler of the Kingdom of Tungning in Taiwan in the 17th century. He was the second son of Zheng Jing and a grandson of Koxinga (Zheng Chenggong). After surrendering to the Qing dynasty in 1683, he was ennobled as Duke Hanjun, and lived the rest of his life in Beijing.\n\nZheng Keshuang was born in of the Kingdom of Tungning in Taiwan; the administrative centre of Chengtian Prefecture was at Fort Provintia. His father was Zheng Jing, the king of Tungning and the eldest son of Koxinga (Zheng Chenggong), the founder of Tungning. His biological mother was Lady Huang (黃氏), Zheng Jing's concubine.\n\nWhen Zheng Jing was leading a campaign against the Manchu-led Qing dynasty in China in the late 1670s, he designated his elder son, Zheng Kezang, as his heir apparent and put him in charge of Tungning's internal affairs. At the same time, he also arranged marriages between his two sons and the daughters of two of his most trusted officials: Zheng Kezang married the daughter of , while Zheng Keshuang married the daughter of Feng Xifan.\n\nZheng Jing returned to Tungning in 1680 from a failed campaign against the Qing Empire. In the same year, Chen Yonghua died after he was ousted from the political arena by his rivals, Feng Xifan and Liu Guoxuan (劉國軒). Zheng Jing died a year later in Chengtian Prefecture. After Zheng Jing's death, Feng Xifan allied with Liu Guoxuan, Zheng Cong (鄭聰) and others to slander Zheng Kezang in front of Queen Dowager Dong, Zheng Jing's mother. They claimed that Zheng Kezang was not Zheng Jing's biological son, and launched a coup to kill Zheng Kezang and seize power. Following the coup, a 12-year-old Zheng Keshuang was installed on the throne as the ruler of Tungning under the title \"Prince of Yanping\" (延平王). After his accession to the throne, Zheng Keshuang rewarded the officials who supported him in the coup by granting them nobility titles. He also gave posthumous honorary titles to his ancestors.\n\nIn 1683, the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing Dynasty ordered Shi Lang to lead a naval fleet to attack and conquer Tungning. Shi Lang and his fleet defeated the Tungning forces, led by Liu Guoxuan, at the Battle of Penghu. After the battle, the Tungning royal court split into two factions, with one advocating war and the other advocating surrender. The \"war\" faction was led by Zheng Dexiao (鄭得瀟), Huang Liangji (黃良驥), Xiao Wu (蕭武) and Hong Gongzhu (洪拱柱), while the \"surrender\" faction was led by Feng Xifan and Liu Guoxuan. Zheng Keshuang heeded Feng and Liu's advice. On 5 July 1683, Feng Xifan ordered Zheng Dexiao to write a surrender document to the Qing Empire. About ten days later, Feng sent Zheng Keshuang to meet Shi Lang. On 13 August, Shi Lang entered Taiwan and received the official surrender.\n\nNoble titles were given to the dynasts and officers of the formerly reigning House of Koxinga. Zheng Keshuang and his family were taken to the Qing imperial capital, Beijing, to meet the Kangxi Emperor. The emperor made Zheng Keshuang a member of the Plain Yellow Banner and awarded him the hereditary title Duke Hanjun (漢軍公; lit. \"the duke of Han Eight Banners\"). Some former Tungning military units, such as the rattan shield troops, were inducted into the Qing military and deployed in the battle against Russian Cossacks at Albazin.\n\nZheng Keshuang died of illness in 1707 in Beijing at the age of 37. His younger brother, Zheng Kexue (鄭克壆), was ordered by the Qing government to bury the remains of Zheng Chenggong and Zheng Jing in Quanzhou, Fujian – the ancestral home of the House of Koxinga. Zheng Keshuang's mother, Lady Huang, tried to seek assistance from the Qing government to return their family property in Fujian to them, which was annexed by local officials, but she failed. Later, during the reign of Yongzheng Emperor, the remaining family of Zheng's was reassigned to Plain Red Banner.\n\nZheng Keshuang was survived by three sons: Zheng Anfu (鄭安福), Zheng Anlu (鄭安祿), and Zheng Ankang (鄭安康). However, all his sons died without issue; and so, Zheng Xianji (鄭咸吉), a first cousin once removed of them, was appointed as heir to Zheng Anfu. Zheng Xianji was the elder son of Zheng Ande (鄭安德) and a grandson of Zheng Keqiao (鄭克塙), and the latter was the youngest brother of Zheng Keshuang.\n\nZheng's descendants served as Bannermen in Beijing until 1911 when the Xinhai revolution broke out and the Qing dynasty's fell, after which they moved back to Anhai and Nan'an in southern Fujian. They still live there to this day.\n\nA poet Zheng Chouyu (鄭愁予; born 1933), claimed to be one of Zheng's descendants, was born in Shandong province in China. Zheng Xiaoxuan 鄭曉嵐 the father of Zheng Chouyu, fought against the Japanese invaders in the Second Sino-Japanese War. Zheng Chouyu was born in Shandong in mainland China and called himself a \"child of the resistance\" against Japan and he became a refugee during the war, moving from place to place across China to avoid the Japanese. He moved to Taiwan in 1949 and focuses his work on building stronger ties between Taiwan and mainland China. Zheng Chouyu was born in mainland China, he identified as Chinese and he felt alienated after he was forced to move to Taiwan in 1949 which was previously under Japanese rule and felt strange and foreign to him.\n\nZheng Keshuang appears as one of the antagonists in the novel \"The Deer and the Cauldron\" by Louis Cha.\n\n"}

In use as a prison from 1820 to 1889, the building is now a living museum. It is a category A listed building.\n\nDesigned by James Gillespie Graham (1776–1855) in 1813 after original plans by Robert Reid in 1807. The original plans had called for a courthouse and three prisons, one for males, one for females and one for debtors. The ground obtained was sufficient for such an ambitious plan, but the finance was not and the Prison Commissioners had to be content with only one prison.\n\nBoth the courthouse and prisons opened in 1820. The courtroom, on the first floor, has a semicircle of large windows which overlook the prison yard and, beyond, to Loch Fyne.\n\nThe two-storied prison has three-foot-thick walls of rough hewn red stone and originally contained cells on both floors, eight in total. A third of the ground floor was occupied by a day-room which was lit, like the cells, by narrow, unglazed windows.\nThe Prisons (Scotland) Act 1839 brought about many changes, including the separation of prisoners. A second prison was finally built on the spare ground, opening in the closing days of 1848. Designed by Thomas Brown of Edinburgh, the new prison consisted of twelve cells on three floors with an exercising gallery at the top. A pair of outdoor exercise yards were also built, separated from each other by a wall. Prisoners were not allowed to fraternize. The separate system was designed to give them time to reflect upon their sins.\n\nThe Prisons (Scotland) Act 1877 heralded another major change in the administration of prisons. Local authorities would no longer have the responsibility of running and financing prisons; the Government was taking control. Large prisons were built in population centres. Barlinnie in Glasgow opened in 1882 and small local prisons in the West of Scotland began to close. Inveraray would be the last. On 20 July 1889 readers of the \"Argyllshire Herald\" were informed that \"the prison of Inveraray will be closed on 31st August\".\n\nDespite changes to the prison system, the court was still sitting, continuing until 1954, with a little activity since then.\nOn several occasions the premises have come near to being abandoned, especially when it was necessary to spend money on repairs.\nIn the 1980s extensive restoration was undertaken by the Scottish Office, but then all plans fell through and the building lay empty.\n\nIn May 1989, Inveraray Jail was reopened as a privately owned tourist attraction, re-enacting the trials and the life of the inmates of the 19th century.\n"}

Based on actual events, the story examines U.S. national security policies during World War II, focusing on President Franklin D. Roosevelt's executive order 9066, which authorized the internment of Japanese Americans. Roosevelt studied court documents and personal diaries of key political figures, including Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black, J.

The school is part of Kennewick School District. Construction of the $30 million building began in 1995, with classroom doors opening in the spring of 1997. The plans for Southridge High School were originally designed for a high school on the east side of the country; however, the school was never built and the Kennewick School District purchased the blueprints and plans. During construction, classes were held at Fruitland Elementary School, under the direction of Principal Ron Williamson. The first commencement was held inside the Toyota Center in June 1999. Southridge was the third 4A school constructed in Kennewick, but with the reorganization of leagues in 2006, Southridge became a 3A school and is now a member of the Columbia Basin League. Yet again, in 2008, it was decided that Southridge would be put back under the 4A schools along with 2 other high schools in Kennewick, WA. Once again in 2010 Southridge was brought back down to a 3A school.\n\nThe campus lies within a valley on the southwest border of Kennewick. Southridge is located several miles away from the majority of its students.\n\nThe school's main complex, divided into wings A through F, was designed by the architecture firm Hammel, Green and Abrahamson of Minnesota; Joe Lavernier Construction of Spokane was the general contractor. The B, C and D-wings are classrooms, each containing two floors with eight classrooms per floor as well as lockers. The A-wing houses the auditorium, cafeteria and music rooms. The F-wing contains one large gym and a small gym as well as a weight room - with locker rooms and training room both located downstairs. The E-wing contains the library and main offices.\n\nThe wings are all connected by a long crescent-shaped hall with A and F-wing at the north and south ends, respectively. The E-wing is in the inner curve, and wings B, C and D branch off along the outer curve.\n\nThe school grounds include football and baseball fields, as well as softball fields, a track, several soccer fields and eight lit tennis courts. The school uses the Kennewick Public Pool as it does not have one of its own.\n\nThe school nickname, the Suns, was selected in a vote among the first freshman class (Class of 1999). The mascot is a gorilla named \"Sunny\" and was inducted into SHS in the 2006-2007 school year.\n\nThe school colors are blue and gold (originally blue, silver and gold). The school fight song, \"Southridge Will Forever Hold My Heart\", was written in 1996 by a Southridge student to the tune of the Notre Dame Victory March.\n\nSouthridge has a storied Mock Trial Program. Winning back to back YMCA Mock Trial regional championships in 2012 and 2013, and attending the Washington State YMCA tournament multiple times.\nThe Southridge Drama department and Drama Club produce several ensemble performances each year.\n\nSouthridge also has one of the best engineering technology programs in the state, led formally by Jim Hendricks, who was invited to join Tri-Cities STEM School, Delta High, in 2009. It offers college-level projects like power supplies and \"Sumo\" robots, with which it compete with Battelle. Its material science course offers the chance to create a sterling silver ring and a personal piece of stained glass, both designed by the students. The course was taught by Roy Bunnell.\n\nFormer Southridge student Danica Lyn Stewart achieved acting success in her adult life and can be seen on NBC's daytime soap \"Passions\".\n\nSouthridge participates in the Columbia Basin Big Nine (CBBN) 3A. The CBBN is the former Columbia Basin League which is the former Big Nine. Football and soccer games are played at Neil F. Lampson Stadium, which is located on the grounds of Kennewick High School. Southridge shares the stadium with Kennewick and Kamiakin High School. In their brief existence, the Suns have won state championships in dance for 4 years (2004–2008), golf, soccer, and baseball, along with several individual state championships in tennis, gymnastics, Swimming, diving, ice hockey, and wrestling.\n\nThe Southridge High School fight song is sung to the tune of the Notre Dame Fight Song.<br>\n<br>\n\"All hail to our Southridge High\"<br>\n\"Bring on the challenge, let's do or die\"<br>\n\"Honor, fame, and glory too\"<br>\n\"Guardians of the GOLD & BLUE!\"<br>\n<br>\n\"We are the finest under the sun\"<br>\n\"Carry the fight 'till victory's won\"<br>\n\"Greatest school to you & I\"<br>\n\"That's almighty Southridge High\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2001950", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2001950", "title": "Tim Noakes", "text": "Tim Noakes\n\nTimothy David Noakes (born 1949) is a South African scientist, and an emeritus professor in the Division of Exercise Science and Sports Medicine at the University of Cape Town. He is also a member of the National Research Foundation (South Africa), who list him as one of their highest-rated members.\n\nHe has run more than 70 marathons and ultramarathons, and is the author of several books on exercise and diet. He is known for his work in sports science and for his support of a low-carbohydrate, high-fat (LCHF) diet, as set out in his books \"The Real Meal Revolution\" and \"Lore of Nutrition: Challenging Conventional Dietary Beliefs\".\n\nNoakes was born in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia (today Harare, Zimbabwe) in 1949 and moved to South Africa at the age of five. His father had arrived in what was then Southern Rhodesia in 1946, establishing a successful tobacco exporting company that he sold in 1954. As a young boy his main sporting interest was cricket. Noakes attended Monterey Preparatory School in Constantia, Cape Town. One year was spent as a foreign exchange student at Huntington Park High School in Huntington Park, California. Prep school was followed by Diocesan College. He has earned an MBChB (1974), MD (1981), and DSc (Med) (2002).\n\nIn 1980 Noakes was tasked to start a sports science course at the University of Cape Town. Noakes went on to head the Medical Research Council-funded Bioenergetics of Exercise Research Unit, which was later changed to the MRC/UCT Research Unit for Exercise Science and Sports Medicine.\n\nIn the early 1990s Noakes co-founded the Sports Science Institute of South Africa, with former South African rugby player Morne du Plessis. His unit's physiological research has produced over 370 scientific articles since 1996.\n\nHe is a leading researcher on the condition now known as exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH). He first recognised this condition in a female runner during the 1984 Comrades Marathon, and published his findings in 1985 in the journal \"Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise\". Noakes hosted the 1st International Exercise-Associated Hyponatremia Consensus Development Conference in Cape Town in May 2005.\n\nIn 1996 Noakes published his theory of the \"central governor\". The theory proposed that fatigue is a \"protective emotion\" rather than a physiological state.\n\nIn 2005 he undertook a series of experiments in the Arctic and Antarctic on South African (British-born) swimmer Lewis Gordon Pugh to understand human capability in extreme cold. He discovered that Pugh had the ability to raise his core body temperature before entering the water in anticipation of the cold and coined the phrase 'anticipatory thermo-genesis' to describe it. In 2007, Noakes was the expedition doctor for Pugh's one kilometre swim at the Geographic North Pole.\n\nNoakes is an advocate of a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet, often referred to in South Africa as the \"Noakes\" or \"Banting\" diet. Noakes has characterised mainstream dietary advice as \"genocide\".\n\nIn February 2014 a registered dietician complained to the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) that Noakes tweeted to a mother that she should wean her baby onto low-carbohydrate, high-fat foods, which he described as real foods. The HPCSA held a hearing about the allegation against Noakes over the next few years. Controversially, on 28 October 2016, the HPSCA incorrectly released a statement announcing that Noakes had been found guilty of misconduct. In a second press release issued over three hours later, the HPSCA apologised for the mistake. Noakes was cleared of misconduct in April 2017. The HPSCA lost its appeal in June 2018.\n\nIn August 2014, Noakes sent a tweet to his 46,000 twitter followers which said: \"Dishonest science. Proven link between autism and early immunisation covered up?\". The tweet included a link to a video from the disgraced ex-doctor and anti-vaccine activist Andrew Wakefield, in which Wakefield was repeating the conspiracy theory that the CDC is covering-up a link between vaccination and autism. Subsequently challenged on twitter, Noakes responded that he personally had \"no opinion\" on the matter.\n\nNoakes co-wrote the 2017 book \"Lore of Nutrition\" with journalist Marika Sboros. In it Noakes describes his Damascene conversion to low-carbohydrate dieting, explores how the lipid hypothesis is the \"biggest mistake in modern medicine\" and details his struggles with the medical establishment. In a review for \"Medical Brief\", paediatrician Alastair McAlpine described the book as \"an extraordinarily heady mix of conspiracy theory, bad science, bad writing, and persecution complex\".\n\nIn 1996 he was honoured by the American College of Sports Medicine when he was asked to present the J.B. Wolfe Memorial Lecture, the college's keynote address at its annual meeting. In 2002 he was awarded a Doctorate in Science (DSc). In 2002 Noakes was awarded the International Cannes Grand Prix Award for Research in Medicine and Water, for his work on Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH). In 2004 Runner's World (USA) included this work as one of the 40 most important \"persons or events\" in the sport of running in the past 40 years. In 2008 he was elected an honorary fellow of the Faculty of Sports and Exercise Medicine (UK), the first foreigner to be so recognised. In that year he also received the Order of Mapungubwe (Silver), from the President of South Africa for his \"excellent contribution in the field of sports and the science of physical exercise\". In 2011 Noakes was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Netherlands. In 2012 he received the Lifetime Achievement Award from South Africa's National Research Foundation for his contribution to sports science research. In 2014 the Southern Africa Association for the Advancement of Science (S2A3) awarded Noakes their prestigious South Africa Medal (gold) for his outstanding contributions to sport physiology.\n\nNoakes has written several books detailing his research in sports science and nutrition.

{"id": "2001951", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2001951", "title": "Sauger", "text": "Sauger\n\nThe sauger (\"Sander canadensis\") is a freshwater perciform fish of the family Percidae which resembles its close relative the walleye. They are members of the largest vertebrate order, Perciformes. They are the most migratory percid species in North America. Saugers obtain two dorsal fins, the first is spiny and the posterior dorsal fin is a soft-rayed fin. Their paired fins are in the thoracic position and their caudal fin is truncated which means squared off at the corners, a characteristic of the family Percidae. Another physical characteristic of Saugers are their ctenoid scales which is common in advanced fishes. Saugers have a fusiform body structure, and as a result saugers are well adapted predatory fishes and are capable of swimming into fast currents with minimal drag on their bodies. They may be distinguished from walleyes by the distinctly spotted dorsal fin, by the lack of a white splotch on the caudal fin, by the rough skin over their gill, and by their generally more brassy color, or darker (almost black) color in some regions. The average sauger in an angler's creel is in weight.\n\nSaugers are a widely distributed fish species. Their historical range consisted of eastern U.S west of the Appalachian Mountains, mostly southern, central, and western U.S up into southern Canada. Sauger distribution and range has decreased from historical ranges because of degraded and fragmented habitat conditions. Sauger distribution within its home range varies by time of year because they are a migratory fish species. Saugers are more typical of rivers whereas walleyes are more common in lakes and reservoirs. In many parts of their range, saugers are sympatric with walleyes. Hybridization between saugers and walleyes is not unknown; the hybrids, referred to as saugeyes, exhibit traits of both species. Being intermediate in appearance between the two species, saugeyes are sometimes difficult to differentiate, but they generally carry the dark blotches characteristic of the sauger. Saugers, however, are usually smaller and will better tolerate waters of higher turbidity than the walleye. Saugers require warmer summer water temperatures of 20-28 degrees Celsius. The need for warm water temperatures is thought to affect the northern and western boundaries of their range.\n\nSaugers generally move upstream to spawn during March–May depending on where their home locations are. They move downstream to their home locations from April–July after their spawning period is over. Saugers have been known to travel between 10 and 600 km from their home to spawning location downstream. Habitat at spawning sites are less complex and diverse than home locations. Females prefer rocky substrate and pools to deposit their eggs. As females increase in length, egg quality and fecundity increase. However, it is thought that egg production begins to decline after age 6 in female sauger. Sexual maturity is reached between 2 and 5 years old. Other measures of sexual maturity are related to size. A sauger is considered to be an adult when it reaches 250–300 mm. Upon birth, larval saugers drift downstream before developing feeding tendencies and horizontal maneuverability. Juvenile saugers tend to develop in diversion canals and backwaters until autumn when they migrate upstream to their wintering habitat. Residing in diversion canals is a large source of mortality for juvenile saugers.\n\nSauger feed on a variety of invertebrates and small fishes depending on the time of year and size of the sauger. Channel catfish \"Ictalurus punctatus\" and freshwater drum \"Pylodictus olivaris\" are a midsize (300–379 mm) and large (>379 mm) sauger's main food source during spring. The diet of a small sauger (200–299 mm) is slightly different than a larger sauger's. Smaller saugers generally feed on benthic invertebrates, mayfly larvae, and catfish during spring and summer. Mid-size and large saugers feed mainly on fish from spring to autumn, but their diets alter during summer. Mid-size and large saugers feed predominantly on mayfly larvae but only during summer months. Freshwater drum \"Aplodinotus grunniens\" and gizzard shad \"Dorosoma cepedianum\" are dominant food sources for saugers of all sizes during autumn. Fish accounted for over 99% of a sauger's diet during autumn. Saugers also prey on shiners during spring and summer but they do not account for a significant part of their diet. Shiners are absent from a sauger's diet in autumn probably due to their availability.\n\nSauger are most likely to be found in large rivers with deep pools with depths greater than 0.6 m. Pools with depths less than 0.6 m are not likely to yield saugers. They encounter a variety of habitats because of their migratory tendencies. They are usually found in natural rivers because they have more abundant pools and their flow regime has not been altered by dams or diversions. They are still common in impounded river systems. Diversions and dams affect habitat and spawning areas of Saugers. Saugers are usually found in areas with high turbidity, low channel slope, low stream velocity, and deep water. Saugers tend to select pools with sand and silt substrates, and habitat features that provide cover from the river current. They tend to avoid runs and riffles. They are most commonly found in pools that are at least 1.5 m deep. They can also be found in shallower pools but in lesser numbers. There have been no observed differences in habitat preference for males and females. The amount of saugers observed will increase with mean summer water temperature, maximum water depth, and mean summer alkalinity.\n\nSaugers face many conservation issues because of migratory barriers, habitat loss, entrainment in irrigation canals, and overexploitation. Dams and diversion canals prevent spawning in upstream habitats. Altering flow regimes in rivers affects turbidity, formation of pools, and temperature. All of which are important for the timing and success of spawning saugers. Long migrations are the main reason why saugers struggle in dammed or diverted river systems. Low water levels in periods of drought are the most detrimental to sauger populations because it strands eggs during spawning and prevents larval sauger from reaching their downstream locations. High death rates that occur during spawning are related to degraded and fragmented river systems. Mortality rates in autumn are related to exploitation by fishermen.\n\n"}

She is the 2006 Four Continents Champion and 2004 Junior World bronze medalist. She was an alternate to the 2006 Winter Olympic team after finishing fourth at the 2006 United States Figure Skating Championships.\n\nTaylor was born in Houston, Texas, to Keith and Tammy Taylor. Her father owns and operates a wholesale floral business. She has one older brother, Brennan. As a child, she participated in a number of activities, including gymnastics, T-ball, soccer, ballet, and tennis. When she was four years old, Taylor told her parents she wanted to be a \"pretty famous ice skater.\" \n\nShe attended Mayde Creek Junior High School and Mayde Creek High School. While in school, Taylor was a member of the National Honor Society and the student council and won the Presidential Award for Academic Excellence. Taylor was also a member of the 2007 State Farm/U.S. Figure Skating Scholastic Honors Team. She graduated from high school in 2008. She was considering attending the University of Texas at Austin or another college in Texas, but decided to stay in her hometown and attend the University of Houston.\n\nTaylor began skating one week before her sixth birthday. When she was eight, she began taking individual lessons with coach Jana Conter. She landed her first triple, a triple loop, when she was 10.\n\nIn 2001, Taylor competed on the juvenile level at the U.S. Junior National Championships, which are the national championships for skaters at the juvenile and intermediate level. She finished third. The next year Taylor competed on the intermediate level and finished tenth. In the 2002–2003 season, she moved up to the novice level and qualified for the 2003 U.S. Figure Skating Championships by finishing second at Southwestern Regionals and second at the Midwestern Sectional Figure Skating Championships. At the National Championships, Taylor finished second behind gold medalist Kimmie Meissner. Taylor was then named to the team for the Triglav Trophy, where she won the silver medal on the novice level.\n\nDuring the 2003–2004 season, Taylor moved up to the junior level. She won a silver medal at her first Junior Grand Prix event in Bratislava, Slovakia. In her next Junior Grand Prix event in Japan, she finished fourth. On the national level, Taylor qualified for the 2004 United States Figure Skating Championships by winning the Midwestern Sectional Championships on the junior level. At the National Championships, she finished second to Meissner once again, although she did win the short program. (Chron-Barron2004; Interview) After the event, Taylor was named to the team for the 2004 World Junior Figure Skating Championships. She won the bronze medal, finishing behind Japan’s Miki Ando and Kimmie Meissner.\n\nDuring the 2004–2005 season, Taylor competed on the Junior Grand Prix once again. She finished third at the events in Budapest, Hungary, and Chemnitz, Germany, but did not qualify for the Junior Grand Prix Final. (Houston Chron 2004) She moved up to the senior level nationally and qualified for the 2005 United States Figure Skating Championships after finishing first at Midwestern Sectionals. At the National Championships, she finished sixth in the short program after hitting all her elements. She ended the competition in ninth place after popping a triple Lutz and falling on a triple Salchow.\n\nIn the fall of 2005, Taylor competed on the Junior Grand Prix again. She finished fourth at the event in Slovakia and second at the event in Bulgaria. Taylor originally was named as an alternate to the Junior Grand Prix Final but later received a last-minute call to the competition in Ostrava, Czech Republic. (Chron 2006) She received the call after competing and winning the Sectionals competition in Denver, Colorado, all while suffering from a cold and sinus infection. Taylor, her coach, and her mother spent 26 hours traveling from Houston to Ostrava and arrived at 7:30 p.m. the day before the event. She placed fourth at the competition, only 3.5 points away from the bronze medal. \n\nIn January 2006, Taylor competed at the 2006 U.S. Figure Skating Championships. She placed seventh in the short program after singling the second part of her triple Lutz-double toe combination. In the long program, she skated to the Forrest Gump Suite and had the third highest technical score (54.21). She ended the competition in fourth place after finishing third in the long program. Her final score was 152.54. After the competition, she was named to the Junior World team. U.S. Figure Skating also named her as the second alternate to the 2006 Olympic team. Taylor later dropped out of Junior Worlds after she had skate problems.\n\nAfter the National Championships, Taylor competed at the Four Continents Championships in Colorado Springs, Colorado, her first senior international event. She won the gold medal after finishing second in both the short program and the long program. During the short program competition, Taylor had to deal with a power outage in the arena that caused a 15-minute delay in the event. She still earned a personal best in the short program. In the long program, Taylor landed five triple jumps, including a triple Lutz at the end of the program. Her only major error was popping a triple loop. Katy still remains the youngest Four Continents Champion winning the competition when she was 16 years and 98 days old.\n\nAs the 2006–2007 season began, Taylor stated that her goals for the year were to qualify for the Grand Prix Final, make the world team, place well at the National Championships and receive a standing ovation. She began the season by winning the bronze medal at the Nebelhorn Trophy in Oberstdorf, Germany, in September. She then competed on the Senior Grand Prix for the first time at Skate America in Hartford, Connecticut and Skate Canada International in Victoria, British Columbia. Before Skate America, Taylor broke in a new pair of skates, which caused her a lot of pain. In the short program, she place eleventh with 34.66 points after falling on her triple flip. She remained in eleventh, and last, place after the long program. A week later, Taylor finished last in the field of 12 at Skate Canada. Taylor believed that her poor results on the Grand Prix series were the result of training, equipment, and personal problems.\n\nAfter the Grand Prix series, Taylor changed her short program from \"Happy Feet\" to \"Legends of the Fall\" so that she would be more comfortable on the ice and more able to tell a story. In December she performed her new short program at the 2006 Marshalls U.S. Figure Skating Challenge in Boston, Massachusetts, an American Idol-style competition in which fans voted for their favorite skating performance. After falling on her triple flip, Taylor did not make it to the final round of the competition.\n\nTaylor's next competition was the 2007 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Spokane, Washington. Before the competition began, she said that she had resolved the personal and boot problems that had bothered her during the Grand Prix events.\n\nTaylor did not compete in the 2007–2008 season, citing an injury, and has not returned to competition since.\n\n\"GP: Grand Prix; JGP: Junior Grand Prix\"\n\n"}
{"id": "2001956", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2001956", "title": "Computer-aided production engineering", "text": "Computer-aided production engineering\n\nComputer-aided production engineering (CAPE) is a relatively new and significant branch of engineering. Global manufacturing has changed the environment in which goods are produced. Meanwhile, the rapid development of electronics and communication technologies has required design and manufacturing to keep pace.\n\nCAPE is seen as a new type of computer-aided engineering environment which will improve the productivity of manufacturing/industrial engineers. This environment would be used by engineers to design and implement future manufacturing systems and subsystems. Work is currently underway at the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) on CAPE systems. The NIST project is aimed at advancing the development of software environments and tools for the design and engineering of manufacturing systems.\n\nThe future of manufacturing will be determined by the efficiency with which it can incorporate new technologies. The current process in engineering manufacturing systems is often ad hoc, with computerized tools being used on a limited basis. Given the costs and resources involved in the construction and operation of manufacturing systems, the engineering process must be made more efficient. New computing environments for engineering manufacturing systems could help achieve that objective.\n\nWhy is CAPE important? In much the same way that product designers need computer-aided design systems, manufacturing and industrial engineers need sophisticated computing capabilities to solve complex problems and manage the vast data associated with the design of a manufacturing system.\n\nIn order to solve these complex problems and manage design data, computerized tools must be used in the application of scientific and engineering methods to the problem of the\ndesign and implementation of manufacturing systems. Engineers must address the entire factory as a system and the interactions of that system with its surrounding environment.\nComponents of a factory system include:\n\nCAPE must not only be concerned with the initial design and engineering of the factory, it must also address enhancements over time. CAPE should support standard engineering methods and problem-solving techniques, automate mundane tasks, and provide reference data to support the decision-making process.\n\nThe environment should be designed to help engineers become more productive and effective in their work. This would be implemented on personal computers or engineering workstations which have been configured with appropriate peripheral devices. Engineering tool developers will have to integrate the functions and data used by a number of different disciplines, for example:\n\nMany of the methods, formulas, and data associated with these technical areas currently exist only in engineering handbooks. Although some computerized tools are available, they are often very specialized, difficult to use, and do not share information or work together. Engineering tools built by different vendors must be made compatible through open systems architectures and interface standards.\n\nCAPE will be based upon computer systems providing an integrated set of design and engineering tools. These software tools will be used by a company’s manufacturing engineers to continuously improve its production systems. They will maintain information about manufacturing resources, enhance production capabilities, and develop new facilities and systems. Engineers working on different workstations will share information through a common database.\n\nUsing CAPE, an engineering team will prepare detailed plans and working models for an entire factory in a matter of days. Alternative solutions to production problems could be quickly developed and evaluated. This would be a significant improvement over current manual methods which may require weeks or months of intensive activity.\n\nTo achieve this goal, a new set of engineering tools are needed. Examples of functions which should be supported include:\n\nThe tools implementing these functions must be highly automated and integrated; and will need to provide quick access to a wide range of data. This data must be maintained in a format that is accessible and usable by the engineering tools. Some examples of the information that might be contained in these electronic libraries include:\n\nThese on-line libraries would allow engineers to quickly develop solutions based upon the work of others.\n\nAnother critical aspect of this engineering environment is affordability, which\ncan best be achieved by designing an environment that can be constructed from low cost \"off-the-shelf\" commercial products, rather than custombuilt computer hardware and software. The basic engineering environment must be affordable. For both cost and technical reasons, it must be designed to be able to support incremental upgrades. Incremental upgrades would allow companies to add capabilities as they are needed. Commercial software products must be easy to install and integrate with other software already in use. These capabilities exist to a limited extent in some general purpose commercial software today, e.g., word processors, databases, spreadsheets.\n\nMany technical issues must be considered in the design and development of new engineering tools for CAPE. These issues include:\n\nThere are three critical elements to be addressed: creating a common manufacturing systems information model; using an engineering life cycle approach; and developing a software tool integration framework.\n\nResolution of these elements will help ensure that independently developed systems will be able to work together. The common information model should identify the elements of the manufacturing system and their relationships to each other; the functions or processes performed by each element; the tools, materials, and information required to perform those functions; and measures of effectiveness for the model and its component elements.\n\nThere have been many efforts over the years to develop information models for different\naspects of manufacturing, but no known existing model fully meets the needs of a CAPE ernviroment. Therefore, a life cycle approach is needed to identify the different processes that a CAPE environment must support, and must define all phases of a manufacturing system or subsystem’s existence. Some of the major phases which may be included in a system life cycle approach are, requirements identification; system design specification; vendor selection; system development and upgrades; installation, testing, and training; and benchmarking of production operations.\n\nManagement, coordination, and administration functions need to be performed during each phase of the life cycle. Phases may be repeated over time as a system is upgraded or re-engineered to meet changing needs or incorporate new technologies.\n\nA software tool integration framework should specify how the tools could be independently designed and developed. The framework would define how CAPE tools would deal with common services, interact with each other and coordinate problem solving activities. Although some existing software products and standards currently address the common services issue, the problem of tool interaction remains largely unsolved. The problem of tool interaction is not limited to the domain of computer-aided manufacturing systems engineering—it is pervasive across the software industry.\n\nAn initial CAPE environment has been established from commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software packages. This new environment is being used to demonstrate commercially available tools to perform CAPE functions, to develop a better understanding and define functional requirements for individual engineering tools and the overall environment, and to identify the integration issues which must be addressed to implement compatible environments in the future.\n\nSeveral engineering demonstrations using COTS tools are under development. These demonstrations are designed to illustrate the various types of functions that must be performed in engineering a manufacturing system.\n\nFunctions supported by the current COTS environment include: system specification/diagramming,\nprocess flowcharting, information modeling, computer-aided design of products, plant layout, material flow analysis, ergonomic workplace design, mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, line balancing, manufacturing simulation, investment analysis, project management, knowledge-based system development, spreadsheets, document preparation, user interface development, document illustration, forms and database management.\n"}

Owned by the Public Media Group of Southern California, it is sister to the area's secondary PBS member, Los Angeles-licensed KCET (channel 28). The two stations share studios at The Pointe (on West Alameda Avenue and Bob Hope Drive, between The Burbank Studios and Walt Disney Studios complexes) in Burbank; KOCE-TV maintains a secondary studio at the South Coast Corporate Center (in the South Coast Metro area) in Costa Mesa and transmitter facilities atop Mount Harvard (adjacent to Mount Wilson). Since 2011, the station has been branded as PBS SoCal.\n\nKOCE-TV and KCET are two of four PBS member stations serving Greater Los Angeles (the others being San Bernardino-licensed KVCR-DT [channel 24], which mainly serves the Inland Empire, and the Los Angeles Unified School District-run KLCS [channel 58]).\n\nThe station first signed on the air on November 20, 1972, as the first television station licensed to Orange County, initially airing four hours of programming per day. It broadcast its first telecourse in 1973. It was originally owned by the Coast Community College District. The station was originally based from studios at Golden West College in Huntington Beach. For most of its history, KOCE-TV was a \"beta\" or secondary PBS station, airing only 25 percent of the national PBS schedule.\n\nIn 2002, the Coast Community College District offered KOCE for sale to raise revenue for other programs. A bidding war ensued between the religious broadcaster Daystar Television Network and members of the community who wanted to continue membership with PBS. In 2004, the station was sold to the KOCE-TV Foundation, an organization made up of civic and business leaders who wanted to keep KOCE-TV as an educational station, for $25.5 million, reduced from an initial bid of $32 million (with $8 million paid up front and the rest paid in 25 equal installments without interest beginning in 2009). The foundation outbid Daystar by $500,000; the religious broadcaster placed a bid of $25 million, which it intended to compensate in an all-cash payment.\n\nDaystar sued in state court, stating that under the terms of the auction, its all-cash bid should have been accepted. A lower court ruled in favor of the college district and the foundation; but on June 23, 2005, the California Court of Appeals ruled that the sale of KOCE-TV was illegal, since the offer was modified after the end of bidding and because the value of the bid was not expressed in net present value terms. Both sides appealed this decision. On November 22, 2005, a state appeals panel reheard arguments in the case following a petition from KOCE, the KOCE Foundation, the Coast Community College District and Daystar. On May 25, 2006, the appeals court reaffirmed its decision, again ruling the sale illegal.\n\nAt the same time, Daystar also filed a federal lawsuit, alleging religious discrimination, civil rights violations and racketeering. On May 1, 2006, the District Court dismissed the racketeering claim, but not the civil rights portion of the lawsuit.\n\nIn June 2006, a state assembly bill that had previously been approved was changed to allow the Coast Community College District to sell KOCE below fair market value in order to keep it a PBS station. The new bill was passed by the assembly, but Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed it, citing concerns about serving the public interest in the sale of public property and the unresolved legal challenges to the type of sale that the bill would have authorized.\n\nIn June 2007, an agreement was reached in which the KOCE-TV Foundation would keep the station, provided that Daystar would be allowed to broadcast over one of KOCE's digital subchannels. As a result, KOCE-DT3 is reserved to broadcast Daystar's national schedule without any local deviation.\n\nKOCE became the Los Angeles market's primary PBS station on January 1, 2011, when the area's longtime original primary member station of the network, KCET (channel 28), ended its association with PBS after 40 years due to an increase in costs to carry PBS programming—leading to its switch to an independent public television station.\n\nAfter KCET left PBS, KOCE entered into a broadcast agreement with KLCS and KVCR to form \"PBS SoCal\" effective January 1, 2011. The PBS programming originally carried on KCET is now shared between the three stations. As a consequence, on December 31, 2010, KOCE expanded its cable coverage into Santa Barbara, and later expanded to Palm Springs. Both San Luis Obispo and Santa Maria (who were previously served by KCET), however, were not included in the cable coverage, as those communities are now served by San Francisco PBS member KQED via cable (Palm Springs is also served by KVCR-DT, while Bakersfield, which was also served by KCET, is now served via cable and over-the-air through Fresno PBS member KVPT).\n\nIn the spring of 2011, KOCE moved its administrative offices to a modern facility in Costa Mesa.\n\nKOCE was available in the Palm Springs area and the Coachella Valley on cable and over the air since the late 1990s, formerly on K55FI and later K35LA, now a KCET translator since 2011, when KOCE became the major PBS station for Southern California.\n\nOn April 25, 2018, KCETLink Media Group and the KOCE-TV Foundation announced that they would merge, effective by the end of the first half of 2018. KOCE will remain Los Angeles' primary PBS station but will relocate its operations to KCET's facility in Burbank (maintaining its Costa Mesa location as a secondary facility). The two stations will continue to carry their existing programming, but KCET will return to PBS. The merger was completed on October 1, 2018, with the combined company branded as Public Media Group of Southern California. \n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nOn January 1, 2011, World moved from KCET-DT4 to KOCE-DT4.\n\nKOCE-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 50, at 11:30 p.m. on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 48, using PSIP to display KOCE-TV's virtual channel as 50 on digital television receivers.\n\nOn April 13, 2017, KOCE-TV announced it had sold its over-the-air spectrum in the FCC's spectrum reallocation auction, reaping $49 million, which the station said it would use to invest in programming and other services. As a result of its spectrum sale, KOCE-TV entered into a channel sharing arrangement with multicultural independent station KSCI (channel 18). KOCE completed the move to UHF 18 on the morning of June 19, 2018, with all five programming streams appearing in the virtual channel table with the same numbering.\n\nIn addition to PBS programs, KOCE also features programming focused on the communities of Orange County, such as the nightly newscast, \"Real Orange\". It also broadcasts several college telecourses by the Coast Community College District, which was the station's original owner. Programming produced by KOCE include \"\".\n\nKOCE produced and broadcast the only Orange County-focused nightly newscast in the Los Angeles market, \"Real Orange\", with a concentration on human interest and public service stories. The program was co-anchored by former longtime KTLA (channel 5) news/sports anchor Ed Arnold, and Ann Pulice. KOCE partnered with the \"Orange County Register\" for newsgathering resources for the station's newscasts, the newspaper also served as a sponsor for the program. The program aired five nights a week until 2009, when only two episodes a week were produced (with rebroadcasts the other three weeknights). The program ended in 2013 due to funding constraints.\n\nKOCE also operated a Weather Center stationed in La Habra Heights, located about north of the Huntington Beach studios. This weather station, which only consists of a weather camera, was shown live during the weather segments of \"Real Orange\" on Monday, Wednesday and Friday evenings. Weather radar imagery and other forecast data are gathered from other weather sources (such as the National Weather Service), as KOCE does not employ its own weather radar.\n\n\n\n"}

As its name indicates, it is based in and primarily serves the German state of Baden-Württemberg.\n\nOn 1 January 1997, EnBW was formed from the merger of two utilities companies from Baden-Württemberg, Badenwerk AG and Energieversorgung Schwaben AG (EVS). On 16 July 1999 two subsidiaries of the former EVS decided to retroactively merge into EnBW Ostwuerttemberg DonauRies AG (ODR). On 1 October 2003 the merger of EnBW with Neckarwerke Stuttgart AG took place.\n\nEnBW was the main sponsor of football-clubs VfB Stuttgart (2005–2010) and Karlsruher SC. Currently it is sponsor of both clubs on a lower level. EnBW is also name- and main sponsor of Volleyball-Bundesliga-club EnBW TV Rottenburg and Beko Basketball-Bundesliga-club EnBW Ludwigsburg.\n\nIn January 2015, EnBW sold a stake in its Baltic 2 offshore wind park to the Australian investment group Macquarie Group for a fee totalling €720 million, due for completion in summer 2016 and subject to antitrust approval.\n\nIn 2017, EnBW won the right for the 900 MW He Dreiht offshore wind farm in 2025 with zero subsidy.\n\nThe two principal shareholders of EnBW are NECKARPRI-Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH, with a 46.55% share and Oberschwäbischen Elektrizitätswerke (OEW), with a 46.55% share. The two shareholders agreed to keep the share ratios as they are and to vote in mutual agreement on important decisions.\n\nAbout 6 million customers make EnBW the third-largest utilities company in Germany. With just under 24,600 employees an annual turnover of approximately 10.6 billion euro was generated in 2003. After the first mid-year 2004 19,500 coworkers remained generating a turnover of approximately €5.8 billion.\n\n\n\nA further special feature is, that on many powerlines of EnBW, which were built by former EVS before 1985 the aerial cable for telecommunication is installed like a garland on the ground conductor or an auxiliary rope.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2001979", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2001979", "title": "Roosevelt family", "text": "Roosevelt family\n\nThe Roosevelt family is an American political family from New York whose members have included two United States Presidents, a First Lady, and various merchants, politicians, inventors, clergymen, artists, and socialites. Progeny of a mid-17th century Dutch immigrant to New Amsterdam, many members of the family became locally prominent in New York City politics and business and intermarried with prominent colonial families. Two distantly related branches of the family from Oyster Bay on Long Island and Hyde Park in Dutchess County rose to national political prominence with the elections of Presidents Theodore Roosevelt (1901–1909) and his fifth cousin Franklin D. Roosevelt (1933–1945), whose wife, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, was Theodore's niece.\n\nThe earliest known ancestor of the family was a man from the Netherlands named Claes van Rosenvelt. It has been suggested that he was related to the Van Rosevelts of Oud-Vossemeer, who were amt lords in the Tholen region of the Netherlands. While evidence suggests that Claes van Rosenvelt indeed came from the Tholen region where the Van Roosevelts were landowners, no records exist that prove that he is related to the noble family. It may simply be a coincidence, or Claes van Rosenvelt may have chosen the name purposefully because of its noble origins or to honor his local amt lord, as was common practice for peasants of the time.\n\nClaes Martenszen van Rosenvelt (c. 1626 - 1659), the immigrant ancestor of the Roosevelt family, arrived in New Amsterdam (present day New York City) some time between 1638 and 1649. About the year 1652, he bought a farm from Lambert van Valckenburgh comprising 24 morgens (that is, 20.44 ha or 50.51 acres) in what is now Midtown Manhattan, including the present site of the Empire State Building. The property included approximately what is now the area between Lexington Avenue and Fifth Avenue bounded by 29th St. and 35th St.\n\nClaes' son Nicholas was the first to use the spelling Roosevelt and the first to hold political office, as an alderman. Nicholas' children Johannes and Jacobus were, respectively, the progenitors of the Oyster Bay and Hyde Park branches of the family. By the late 19th century, the Hyde Park Roosevelts were generally associated with the Democratic Party and the Oyster Bay Roosevelts with the Republican Party. President Theodore Roosevelt, an Oyster Bay Roosevelt, was the uncle of Eleanor Roosevelt, later wife of Franklin Roosevelt. Despite political differences that caused family members to actively campaign against each other, the two branches generally remained friendly.\n\nIn heraldry, canting arms are a visual or pictorial depiction of a surname, and were and still are a popular practice. It would be common to find roses, then, in the arms of many Roosevelt families, even unrelated ones (the name Rosenvelt means roses-field). Also, grassy mounds or fields of green would be a familiar attribute.\n\nThe Van Roosevelts of Oud-Vossemeer in Zeeland have a coat of arms that is divided horizontally, the top portion with a white chevron between three white roses, while the bottom half is gold with a red lion rampant. A traditional blazon suggested would be, \"Per fess vert a chevron between three roses argent and Or a lion rampant gules\".\n\nThe coat of arms of the namesakes of the Dutch immigrant Claes van Rosenvelt, ancestor of the American political family that included Theodore and Franklin D. Roosevelt, were white with a rosebush with three rose flowers growing upon a grassy mound, and whose crest was of three ostrich feathers divided into red and white halves each. In heraldic terms this would be described as, \"Argent upon a grassy mound a rose bush proper bearing three roses gules barbed and seeded all proper\", with a crest upon a torse argent and gules of \"Three ostrich plumes each per pale gules and argent\". Franklin Roosevelt altered his arms to omit the rosebush and use in its place three crossed roses on their stems, changing the blazon of his shield to \"Three roses one in pale and two in saltire gules barbed seeded slipped and left proper\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was a helmet made of bronze which in its later styles covered the entire head and neck, with slits for the eyes and mouth. A large curved projection protected the nape of the neck. \n\nOut of combat, a Greek hoplite would wear the helmet tipped upward for comfort. This practice gave rise to a series of variant forms in Italy, where the slits were almost closed, since the helmet was no longer pulled over the face but worn cap-like. Although the classical Corinthian helmet fell out of use among the Greeks in favour of more open types, the Italo-Corinthian types remained in use until the 1st century AD, being used, among others, by the Roman army.\n\nApparently (judging from artistic and archaeological evidence) the most popular helmet during the Archaic and early Classical periods, the style gradually gave way to the more open Thracian helmet, Chalcidian helmet and the much simpler pilos type, which was less expensive to manufacture and did not obstruct the wearer's critical senses of vision and hearing as the Corinthian helmet did. Numerous examples of Corinthian helmets have been excavated, and they are frequently depicted on pottery.\n\nThe Corinthian helmet was depicted on more sculpture than any other helmet; it seems the Greeks romantically associated it with glory and the past. The Romans also revered it, from copies of Greek originals to sculpture of their own. Based on the sparse pictorial evidence of the republican Roman army, in Italy the Corinthian helmet evolved into a jockey-cap style helmet called the Italo-Corinthian, Etrusco-Corinthian or Apulo-Corinthian helmet, with the characteristic nose guard and eye slits becoming mere decorations on its face . Given many Roman appropriations of ancient Greek ideas, this change was probably inspired by the \"over the forehead\" position common in Greek art. This helmet remained in use well into the 1st century AD.\n\nHerodotus mentions the Corinthian helmet in his \"Histories\" when writing of the Machlyes and Auseans, two tribes living along the River Triton in ancient Libya (the portion of ancient Libya he describes is most likely in modern Tunisia). The tribes chose annually two teams of the fairest maidens who fought each other ceremonially with sticks and stones. They were dressed in the finest Greek panoply topped off with a Corinthian helmet. The ritual fight was part of a festival honoring the virgin goddess Athena. Young women who succumbed to their wounds during the ordeal were thought to have been punished by the goddess for lying about their virginity (\"Histories, 4.180\").\n\n\n"}

Apple released Rosetta in 2006 when it changed the instruction set architecture of the Macintosh platform from the PowerPC to the Intel processor. The name \"Rosetta\" is a reference to the Rosetta Stone, the discovery that made it possible to comprehend and translate Egyptian hieroglyphs.\n\nRosetta is based on QuickTransit technology. It has no graphical user interface, which led Apple to describe Rosetta as \"the most amazing software you'll never see.\"\n\nRosetta was initially included with Mac OS X v10.4.4 \"Tiger\", the version that was released with the first Intel-based Macintosh models.\n\nRosetta is not installed by default in Mac OS X v10.6 \"Snow Leopard\", but can be retained as an option via the installer or Apple Software Update for users who need to run PowerPC applications.\n\nRosetta is neither included nor supported in Mac OS X v10.7 \"Lion\" or later. Therefore, with Lion and later releases, the current Macintosh platform does not support PowerPC applications.\n\nRosetta is part of Mac OS X for Intel operating systems prior to Lion. It translates G3, G4, and AltiVec instructions; however, it does not translate G5 instructions. Therefore, applications that rely on G5-specific instruction sets must be modified by their developers to work on Rosetta-supported Intel-based Macs. According to Apple, applications with heavy user interaction but low computational needs (such as word processors) are well suited to translation via Rosetta, while applications with high computational needs (such as AutoCAD, games, or Adobe Photoshop) are not.\nPre-existing PowerPC versions of Apple \"Pro\" media-production applications (such as Final Cut Pro, Motion, Aperture, and Logic Pro) are not supported by Rosetta and require a \"crossgrade\" to a universal binary version to work on Rosetta-supported Intel-based Macs.\n\nRosetta does not support the following:\n\n\nThe reason for Rosetta's reduced compatibility compared to Apple's earlier 68k emulator for PPCs lies within its implementation: Rosetta is a user-level program and can only intercept and emulate user-level code, while the older emulator was integrated with the system at a much lower level. The 68k emulator was given access to the very lowest levels of the OS by being at the same level as, and tightly connected to, the Mac OS nanokernel on PPC Macs (later used for multiprocessing under Mac OS 8.6 and later), which means that the nanokernel was able to intercept PowerPC interrupts, translate them to 68k interrupts (then doing a mixed mode switch, if necessary), and then executing 68k code to handle the interrupts. This allowed lines of 68k and PPC code to be interspersed within the same binary of a fat application. While a similar effect could likely have been achieved for Mac OS X by running Rosetta within XNU, Apple instead chose to implement Rosetta as a user-level process to avoid excessive debugging and the potential for security issues.\n\n\n"}

He was the eldest son of Richard Prosser, the Birmingham, England, engineer and inventor. R. B. Prosser was educated at University College School, London where he was a fellow pupil of Joseph Chamberlain.\n\nRichard Prosser was heavily involved with the introduction of the Patent Law Amendment Act 1852, and his 700-volume library, combined with that of Bennet Woodcroft,(1803-1879) formed the basis of the Patent Office Library, which opened on 5 March 1854.\n\nRichard Prosser died in 1854; in 1856 R. B. Prosser joined the Office of the Commissioners of Patents, London, where he later rose to become Chief Examiner. He was forced to retire early, in 1888, because of partial blindness, but continued to take an active part in local government and church life in St Pancras, London, where he lived. He was much involved in national Church of England organisations. He married Anne Ostell, daughter of William Ostell of Bloomsbury, London; she died in 1911. They had a daughter and three sons.\n\nR. B. Prosser was greatly interested in technical history, and in particular the biographies of inventors. This was due to his work on patents, where he needed to be able to assess the priority of them - a knowledge of patents history was vital for this. He wrote 58 lives for the Dictionary of National Biography, and supplied much material for the New English Dictionary. Prosser also wrote \"Birmingham Inventors and Inventions\", 1881, in a limited edition of 50 copies. This was a cumulation of notes he had published earlier in the \"Birmingham Gazette\". A similar work on Manchester inventors was never finished. His 315 contributions to 'St Pancras Notes and Queries' in the \"St. Pancras Guardian\" between 3 February 1897 and 2 January 1903 were later published in a book of 150 copies. He was a frequent contributor to Notes and Queries, as well as to technical periodicals. Prosser had in mind to write a history of invention, written around the abstracts of British Patent Specifications, but the project never got further than the planning stage.\n\nProsser died, aged 79. His library was dispersed by auction, and his files of biographical notes were sold for about £50. They surfaced again in the 1970s, to be bought by the British Library, Dept of Manuscripts, Add Ms 54,496 - 54,507. They comprise 24 volumes and cover over 1600 names. More of Prosser's papers are in Birmingham and Manchester reference libraries, having been presented either by himself in his lifetime or by his family after his death. The on-line catalogue of the National Archives lists small collections of Prosser's papers for patentees in the South West of England, Northamptonshire and Buckinghamshire. These might be part of his history of inventions project, noted above.\n\nProsser was a pioneer of the study of technical history, and his published biographies and manuscript records are an incomparable source for present-day researchers.\n\n"}

In 1999, Buddha Records issued an expanded version of the album entitled \"The Mirror Man Sessions\", which features five additional tracks taken from the abandoned tapes.\n\nWhen the band went into the studio in late 1967 to record the follow-up to their debut album \"Safe as Milk\", which had been released earlier that year, it was with the intention of producing a double album, provisionally entitled \"It Comes to You in a Plain Brown Wrapper\". Three of the tracks they recorded—\"Tarotplane\", \"25th Century Quaker\", and \"Mirror Man\"—were long, psychedelic blues jams performed 'live in the studio' (in one take with no overdubs). These were intended to fill one of the set's two LPs.\nThe band were also working on a number of other tracks, many of which would eventually be included on \"Strictly Personal\" (1968). These songs were characterized by their polyrhythmic structures and psychedelic themes, which marked a progression from the band's previous blues-rooted work on \"Safe as Milk\".\n\nThe \"Brown Wrapper\" concept, however, was at some point abandoned, and many of the tracks from the sessions were left unfinished and without any vocals. The reason for this remains unclear, though Beefheart biographer Mike Barnes suggests it was probably because the band's record label, Buddah, simply lost interest. A number of the abandoned tracks were re-recorded in 1968, and released as \"Strictly Personal\", through producer Bob Krasnow's own record label, Blue Thumb. The original session tapes, however, which included the three long blues jams along with a number of other unreleased songs, remained the property of Buddah, who released \"Mirror Man\" in May 1971, compiling the track list from the three 'live' jams and a finished version of \"Kandy Korn\" (which was one of the tracks re-recorded for \"Strictly Personal\", where it appears in shortened form). The album's original pressing was put together somewhat carelessly, with the cover art featured a shot of the band's 1970 line-up. Later pressings replaced this photo with a more striking image of Van Vliet (Beefheart) wearing a top hat.\n\nThe opening track, \"Tarotplane\", takes its title after the Robert Johnson song \"Terraplane Blues\", which was about a popular 1930s car. Throughout \"Tarotplane\"'s nineteen minutes, Van Vliet quotes lines from Johnson's song as well as from various other blues tunes including Blind Willie Johnson's \"You're Gonna Need Somebody on Your Bond\", Son House's \"Grinning in Your Face\", and Willie Dixon's \"Wang Dang Doodle\". The song is built on a single two-chord blues riff, and also features an appearance by Van Vliet on an Indian reed instrument called a shehnai, which was supposedly given to him by Ornette Coleman, and which he plays in a different key from the rest of the band.\n\nAlso on side one is an eight-minute \"Kandy Korn\", the second Magic Band tune to reference confectionery, following \"Safe as Milk\"'s \"Abba Zaba\". A different, shorter version of this song appears as the closing track on \"Strictly Personal\", where the production buries the later sections of the song under a profusion of backwards cymbals. Here, the track is heard without Krasnow's controversial production effects.\n\nThe second long 'live' blues jam, \"25th Century Quaker\", owes its surreal lyrics more to the psychedelic mood of the time, with its references to \"blue cheese faces\" and \"eyes that flutter like a wide-open shutter.\" Around the time the song was recorded the band had been wearing black Quaker coats on stage, and even began to play their live shows as The 25th Century Quakers.\n\nThe album closes with its fifteen-minute title track; an AllMusic review of the album cites \"Mirror Man\" as \"one of the key tracks of Beefheart's entire career\", adding, \"Probably the catchiest tune Beefheart ever wrote, 'Mirror Man' has an almost funky, hip-swaying groove.\" Drummer John French notes, \"This is the session in which I was told afterwards I had been given LSD in my tea by someone. Actually, it must have been a rather small amount, because I didn't find myself too far from reality.\" Like \"Kandy Korn\", it was re-recorded for \"Strictly Personal\", where it appears as \"Son of Mirror Man – Mere Man\".\n\nReviews of the album have made much of the length of its four compositions. A contemporary review written for \"Rolling Stone\" magazine by Lester Bangs, who opens by citing Beefheart as \"one of the four or five unqualified geniuses to rise from the hothouses of American music in the Sixties\", states: \"None of them really build in intensity or end up anyplace other than where they started, and would most likely prove intolerable to anyone already a bit put off by Beefheart's work.\" Mike Barnes suggests the lengths are partly justified by other bands' long blues compositions of the period, such as the nineteen-minute \"Revelation\" from Love's \"Da Capo\" (1966), or the eleven-minute \"Alligator\" from the Grateful Dead's \"Anthem of the Sun\" (1968). Bangs, too, goes on to say, \"If all those millions settled for Cream throttling 'Spoonful' for 16 minutes, their attention spans shouldn't have any trouble with this, which is not only better blues jamming but actually has more variety.\" The album reached a peak UK chart position of number 49, although, like all other Magic Band releases, it failed to break into the top 100 in the United States.\n\nAll tracks written by Don Van Vliet and published by Flamingo Music.\n\nIn 1999, Buddha Records (which had renamed itself to correct the earlier misspelling, 'Buddah') reissued the album under the title \"The Mirror Man Sessions\", which was released with a newly expanded track list and a 12-page booklet explaining the history of the recordings. The additional tracks included on this release are also taken from the abandoned \"Brown Wrapper\" sessions, and thus yield a track listing which is somewhat closer to the original concept. Other tracks from these sessions are included as bonus material on Buddha's 1999 issue of \"Safe as Milk\".\n\n\n\n"}

It is the second tallest building in the city after Wells Fargo Center, and with its nearly office space, it is the largest in Oregon in terms of volume. In October 2019, the building was awarded the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Platinum certification for environmental sustainability by the U.S. Green Building Council.\n\nDesigned by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM) with Pietro Belluschi as the consultant, the tower cost $60 million to construct. Ground was broken on May 29, 1981, and the building was largely completed in June 1983. It was dedicated on December 1, 1983. The tower adjoins U.S. Bank Plaza at 555 SW Oak Street, a 7-story, building constructed in 1974. A tower expected to rise about 37 stories was already part of the bank's long-term site plans at that earlier date, but that phase of the plans ended up being delayed until the 1980s.\n\nOriginally, the building served as the national headquarters of U.S. Bancorp, and was the regional headquarters of that organization until a 1997 merger moved the corporate offices to Minneapolis, Minnesota. As of 2004, U.S. Bancorp had leased until 2015.\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, the top floors held the headquarters of Louisiana-Pacific.\n\nSince a $4 million renovation in 2002, the 30th floor of the tower has been occupied by the Portland City Grill, Portland's top-grossing restaurant. It has been cited as the restaurant with the best view in Portland.\n\nIn 2000, the U.S. Bancorp Tower was sold for a price of $165 million to a partnership of three firms: Unico Properties, JPMorgan and Wafra Investment Advisory Group. In 2004, a majority stake in the tower was acquired by California-based Broadreach Capital Partners LLC, which bought-out JPMorgan and Wafra, but Unico continued to own 25 percent. At that time, 92 percent of the building was leased.\n\nIn August 2006, a majority stake in the building was purchased by \"institutional investors advised by JPMorgan Asset Management\" for a price of $286 million.\n\nIn 2008 LaSalle Investment Management purchased a majority stake in the building from Unico Properties; the building had an estimated value of $285 million at the time. LaSalle sold their stake in 2015, to TPF Equity REIT that is majority-owned by UBS. Unico Properties retains a minority share in the building. The sale price was $372.5 million, a record for any office building in the Portland area.\n\nPerhaps the most unusual features of the U.S. Bancorp Tower are its shape and color. Pietro Belluschi was most concerned about the play of light and shadows on its surface; meanwhile, the SOM team had to work with a uniquely shaped lot due to the street grid. Because of the street grid, the tower features no right angles in its parallelogram footprint. This, in turn, makes it look either extremely slender or wide depending upon one's viewing angle. Belluschi carefully selected the glass and granite for the exterior facing. The pink granite covering the building was quarried in Spain. The Pittsburgh Plate Glass used for the windows is also pink, an effect caused by its being \"glazed in a semitransparent coating of copper and silver that looks pink from the outside\". The windows can absorb or reflect light depending upon how much light is upon them, while the surrounding granite may appear darker or lighter than the window panes, depending upon the time of day. The unusual color earned the building the nickname \"Big Pink\". From 2013 to 2015, the entire building underwent interior design renovation.\n\nIn October 2019, the building achieved the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Platinum certification for environmental sustainability from the U.S. Green Building Council.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2002008", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2002008", "title": "Figure skating spirals", "text": "Figure skating spirals\n\nA spiral is an element in figure skating where the skater glides on one foot while raising the free leg above hip level. It is akin to the arabesque in ballet.\n\nSpiral positions are classified according to the skating leg (left or right), edge (outside or inside), direction the skater is traveling (forward or backward), and the position of the free leg (backward, forward, sideways).\n\nSpirals were a required element in ladies' singles and pair skating prior to the 2012–13 season. Spirals were infrequently performed by men at the Olympic level prior to the 2012–13 season because it was not a required element nor could men receive points for spiral sequences in the element score of the ISU Judging System. In spite of this, some male skaters are known for their spirals, such as Toller Cranston, Paul Wylie, and Shawn Sawyer.\n\nThe name \"Spiral\" is indicative of the \"skating edge\". This move is generally (but not exclusively) demonstrated on a deep inside or outside edge. As the skater moves, he or she glides slightly to the left or right (depending on the edge used), and continues in a spiral pattern around the ice if held long enough.\n\nSpirals can be performed on four edges: forward or backward, and on the inside or outside edge. Spirals performed on a \"flat\" (no lean) are generally not counted as \"true\" spirals. The basic spiral is performed with the free leg stretched and extended to the rear above hip level. Many skaters try to lift the leg as high as possible, but more important than the height of the free leg is that it be fully stretched and that the tension of the position be maintained in the upper body as well.\n\nJudges look at the depth, stability, and control of the skating edge, speed and ice coverage, extension, and other factors. Some skaters are able to change edges during a spiral, i.e. from inside to outside edge.\n\nA \"spiral sequence\" is a series of spiral moves performed together. The spiral sequence was a required element for ladies and pairs in international competition prior to the 2012–13 season; under the rules for the ISU Judging System, the skater must have held each spiral position for at least 3 seconds to have received credit for it. \n\nA spiral sequence often included a \"change of edge\" spiral. The same spiral position was held, but the skater changed the edge he or she was skating on. The most common was forward inside edge to forward outside edge.\n\nFrom the 2012–13 season and onward, the spiral sequence was replaced by the choreographic sequence. The choreographic sequence is required for men's, ladies' and pairs' free skating. The choreographic sequence consist of moves in the field, unlisted jumps, spinning movements, etc.\n\nSpirals can also be performed in other positions, such as with the free leg extended forward or to the side, with a bent knee, or with the leg, knee, or skate supported with one or both hands. There are many variations and some names, while not necessarily official, have come into common use.\n\nAn arabesque spiral is the basic spiral position. The free leg is extended behind the body above hip height (at least a 90 degree angle). Some skaters are able to achieve vertical (180 degrees) with this position, but it is not required.\n\nA catch-foot spiral does not refer to any single position, but generally refers to any spiral with the skate of the free leg being held in one or both hands. Catchfoot spirals include:\n\nA Charlotte spiral is a variation in which the torso is dropped down forward toward the skating leg and the free leg is lifted behind in a near-split position.\n\nA Kerrigan spiral is a high-leg outside spiral performed with one hand supporting the knee of the free leg. This position is named after Nancy Kerrigan.\n\nA skid spiral (also known as a slide spiral) is a difficult 180-degree turn on the ice performed in a spiral position, using a skidden three turn to change directions. It was invented by Robin Cousins, and is notably performed by Sasha Cohen and Evgenia Medvedeva.\n\nA fan spiral is a back outside edge spiral held with the free leg held unsupported to the skater's front or side. Ideally, this position should be held with both legs straight, although less flexible skaters attempt to compensate for a lack of strength or flexibility by not fully extending the free leg or bending the skating leg.\n\nAn inverted spiral is a variation performed with the free leg held in front with the skater leaning backward over the edge of the skating foot so that the skater's upper body is held almost parallel to the ice. The position attained in this spiral is similar to that of a layover camel.\n"}
{"id": "2002009", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2002009", "title": "Northwest Staging Route", "text": "Northwest Staging Route\n\nThe Northwest Staging Route was a series of airstrips, airport and radio ranging stations built in Alberta, British Columbia, the Yukon and Alaska during World War II. It extended into the Soviet Union as the ALSIB (ALaska-SIBerian air road).\n\nThe route was developed in 1942 for several reasons. Initially, the 7th Ferrying Group, Ferrying Command, United States Army Air Corps (later Air Transport Command) at Gore Field (Great Falls Municipal Airport) was ordered to organize and develop an air route to send assistance to the Soviet Union though Northern Canada, across Alaska and the Bering Sea to Siberia, and eventually over to the Eastern Front. The US-Canadian Permanent Joint Board on Defense decided in the autumn of 1940 that a string of airports should be constructed at Canadian expense between the city of Edmonton in central Alberta and the Alaska-Yukon border. Late in 1941 the Canadian government reported that rough landing fields had been completed.\n\nWith the outbreak of war, American lines of communication with Alaska by sea were seriously threatened and alternative routes had to be opened. The string of airports through the lonely tundra and forests of northwest Canada provided an air route to Alaska which was practically invulnerable to attack, and it seemed to be in U.S. interests to develop them and open a highway which would at once be a service road for the airports and a means for transporting essential supplies to the Alaskan outposts. In response to this need, United States Army engaged in the Alaskan Highway project.\n\nNeither the Eleventh Air Force, nor the United States Army, nor the Lend-Lease aid to the Soviet Union could wait for the Alaska Highway to be completed. The long route though the Caribbean to Brazil, Nigeria, Egypt and Iran was unworkable, nor could aircraft be flown via Greenland or Iceland. A huge program of airport construction and road making, therefore, was undertaken.\n\nThe Alaska Highway was but a part of the defenses provided for the Northwest North American frontier. Much less is known about the great air route leading from the United States to Alaska through Canada. Airfields were built or upgraded every or so from Edmonton, Alberta to Fairbanks, Alaska (\"the longest hop being the 140 miles or so between Fort Nelson and the Liard River flight strip\") The route of the Alaska Highway, which was built to provide a land route to Alaska, basically connected the airfields together. Edmonton became the headquarters of the Alaskan Wing, Air Transport Command.\n\nTwo routes were developed from the United States, which met at Edmonton, Alberta, from which the aircraft were ferried to Ladd Field, near Fairbanks, Alaska where the American-built aircraft were to be turned over to Russian flight crews. Marks Army Airfield, near Nome, Alaska was 500 miles closer to Russia, but was ruled out because the United States feared it was too vulnerable to Japanese attack. One route originated at Great Falls Army Air Base, Montana, where aircraft bound for Russia were ferried from their manufacturing plants in Southern California.\n\nThe other route originated at Minneapolis, Minnesota, where Wold-Chamberlain Airport was used as an aircraft staging point for aircraft manufactured in the Midwest and northeastern United States. The Minneapolis-Edmonton route, however was turned into a transport route only by the end of 1943, with aircraft ferrying operations being shifted to Great Falls. In addition to the Lend-Lease aircraft, Alaskan Eleventh Air Force aircraft were also ferried up the NSR, with the aircraft being flown to Elmendorf Field, near Anchorage from RCAF Station Whitehorse upon their arrival.\n\nThree main types of combat aircraft were ferried to the Soviet Union under Lend-Lease. Fighter aircraft were Bell P-39 Airacobras, and later its successor, the Bell P-63 Kingcobra, which were favored by the Red Air Force who used the two types with great success. The majority of the P-39s shipped to the Soviet Union were the definitive Q-models. Bombers included the Douglas A-20 Havoc light attack bomber and North American B-25 Mitchell medium bombers that were also sent to the Red Air Force. Transport aircraft were made up of predominantly, the Douglas C-47 Skytrain, also supplied in great numbers.\n\nThe Bell fighters and the B-25 Mitchells were flown up to Ladd via Minneapolis; the C-47s and A-20s came up via Great Falls. A handful of other aircraft types, North American AT-6 Texan trainers, some North American Curtiss P-40 Warhawk fighters, three Republic P-47 Thunderbolts and one Curtiss C-46 Commando transport were also ferried to Russia. The aircraft were supplied with Russian language operations and maintenance manuals, as well as painted in Red Air Force camouflage colors and national markings.\n\nThe Russians set up a command at Ladd Field and Nome where their pilots were trained to take over the aircraft and fly them to Krasnoyarsk in Siberia and on to various fronts in western Russia. The first group of Russian pilots arrived at Nome on 14 August 1942 on their way to Ladd Field. Along with the pilots were civilians from the Soviet Purchasing Commission and a group of Red Air Force mechanics. Most were located at Ladd, with a secondary group at Marks Field. The first Lend-Lease aircraft, a group of twelve A-20 Havocs, arrived at Ladd on 3 September 1942. The first Russian pilots, after five days of training on the aircraft, took off for Nome and the long trip to the Eastern Front.\n\nInitially the USAAF provided the initial training on how to operate and maintain the Lend-Lease aircraft. Later, after an experienced cadre was developed, the Russians assumed the responsibility. The Russians also meticulously inspected each aircraft, and would reject any aircraft that presented the slightest problem. The USAAF was then left with the chore of correcting them. It was sometimes quite exasperating, as the USAAF would work long hours of overtime to get the aircraft into first-class condition so that all the Russians had to do was fly them from Fairbanks to the Eastern Front.\n\nThe ALSIB and Northwest Staging Route also provided a diplomatic route between Washington, D.C. and Moscow. Diplomats, high political figures and countless other government officials shuttled back and forth along it in transports during the war. Wendell Willkie, Vice-President Henry A. Wallace, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov, and Andrei Gromyko were but a few who used the route. President Roosevelt considered holding a summit in Fairbanks in 1944 to meet with Stalin, however the location was subsequently changed to Yalta in the Soviet Union. Also the route provided a means over which the Russians moved intelligence agents and classified information obtained illegally in the United States. The Soviets, claiming diplomatic immunity, routinely moved large numbers of suitcases in batches of 50 or more, their contents diplomatically sealed.\n\nThe Russians who arrived in Alaska also frequently visited shopping areas in Fairbanks and Nome, and contingents visited the aircraft manufacturing plants in the United States. They maintained a strict decorum and politely paid for their purchases, sometimes in old US gold certificates. Many luxury items were bought and shipped back to the Soviet Union on the Lend-Lease aircraft with the hope that they would reach their final destinations in Russia. Most of the Russian pilots were experienced combat veterans who saw the ferrying mission as a respite from their combat missions. They were generally reserved, and political officers were sent to Alaska to ensure their loyalty.\n\nAs the Pacific War wound down, the wartime marriage of convenience between the capitalistic and communist countries was coming to an end. In 1945, the United States and Soviet Union were about to embark on a Cold War and the Russians departed Fairbanks shortly after the Japanese apitulation in September 1945.\n\nPossibly because of their strict inspection standards, there were remarkably few aircraft accidents. During the 21 months of the program, 7,983 aircraft were delivered to the Russians with only 133 lost to weather or pilot error. Thirteen Red Air Force pilots were buried in the Fort Richardson cemetery.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The series was cancelled in the early 1990s.\n\nThe show featured the adventures of the title character Fortycoats (Fran Dempsey) - his catchphrase was \"Be me forty coats and me fifty pockets\" - and his companions Sofar Sogood (played by Conal Kearney), a prim goody two shoes character and Slightly Bonkers (played by Virginia Cole), a naive schoolgirl. They occupied the Flying Trick Shop (also known as the Flying \"Tuck\" Shop and the Flying Sweet Shop) and battled against the evil Whilomena, the Whirligig Witch (and her cat, Spooky) and the equally evil Pickarooney (who lived in a rubbish tip and kidnapped children).\n\n\n\n\nThe name \"Johnny Fortycoats\" first appears in Dublin folklore in the 1930s. It may perhaps have been applied to more than one person, including one of a couple of tramps who walked the coast of Dublin at the time of the television series. A wild looking man, well recognized in the city centre and harmless as anyone knew. He was far removed from the world of television. It was his habit to wear several coats, hence the nickname.\n\nThe show was a spin-off from Wanderly Wagon, in which Fortycoats was played by Bill Golding, who also played Rory. The in joke of the programme was that Fortycoats only ever visited in his flying sweetshop when Rory had gone off on some errand and Rory seemed to doubt Fortycoats existence because he never met him. When Goulding left the series, Fran Dempsey took over the heavily disguised role of Fortycoats but not that of Rory, who was written out.\n\nEugene Lambert (creator of Wanderly Wagon) described it as \"a rehash of our program\".\n\nKildanore Press published two annuals based on Wanderly Wagon, written by Martin Duffy and illustrated by Don Conroy.\n\n"}

Based on tournament attendance, hockey is the most popular high school sport in the state. Approximately 256 schools and over 6,500 participants in total (due to cooperative team arrangements) field sanctioned varsity teams competing in the Minnesota State High School League (MSHSL). These teams are divided into two classes, AA and A. Each class is also divided into eight sections.\n\nAttendance has been strong throughout the years, with 22 tournaments eclipsing the 100,000+ barrier, and in 2015 a record-setting total of 135,618 (both classes). In the 2006 State Tournament, the average attendance per game in the championship brackets was 18,000 people. The Minnesota State High School Hockey Tournament is currently the largest state sports tournament in terms of viewing and attendance, beating the Florida's State High School Football Tournament and Indiana's State High School Basketball Tournament.\n\nHigh school hockey players throughout Minnesota participate in a maximum of 25 contests, excluding the section tournaments and the Minnesota State Boys' High School Hockey Tournament. Teams currently play three 17-minute periods to comprise a game. A lengthened period time was adopted by the Minnesota State High School League in 2003.\n\nBoys hockey concludes their season with a four-day tournament in March that features sixteen teams competing for championships in both classes. From 1945 through 1991 the tournament consisted of a single class, eight team tournament instead of the present day two class (AA and A) tournament. Private schools were not allowed to play in the Tournament until the 1974–75 season. In 1992–93, the tournament was composed of Tier I and II teams. This two-year experiment sent the top teams from each of the eight sections to the Tier I portion of the tournament and the remaining teams conducted a playoff to determine who would be included in the Tier II tournament. In 1994, the dual class system was adopted and teams were placed into a class structure based on school enrollments.\n\nSince 1994, the MSHSL's process to determine section assignments for boys' hockey is based on school enrollments and activity classifications. The basic premise is to place the largest 64 schools into Class AA and the remaining high schools in Class A. Both Classes are then divided into 8 sections each. Teams are placed into their section assignments with geographic location as a primary consideration. High schools initially placed in Class A have the option to play at the Class AA level.\n\nBeginning with the 2007 state tournament, the top five teams in each class are seeded. Coaches of the participating schools vote to determine the seeded teams the Saturday before the state tournament. The four teams are then bracketed so that if the seeded teams advance, the top seed plays the fourth seed while the second and third seeds play each other. The quarterfinal opponents of the seeded teams are determined by a blind draw.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Licensed to Los Angeles, California, KKLQ's transmitter is located atop Mount Wilson and has a booster in Santa Clarita, KKLQ-FM2 at 100.3 MHz, to extend its coverage into the Santa Clarita Valley and other areas north of Los Angeles.\n\nFrom 2008 through 2017, the station broadcast a classic rock format (though it initially aired an adult album alternative format) under the brand \"100.3 The Sound\" as KSWD. In 2017, station owner Entercom announced its merger with CBS Radio. In order to satisfy Federal Communications Commission ownership caps, Entercom retained CBS Radio's pre-existing Los Angeles cluster but divested KSWD to EMF, who assumed control of the station on November 16, 2017 and flipped it to K-Love programming. The former broadcast studios of The Sound were located on Wilshire Boulevard in the Miracle Mile district of Los Angeles.\n\nKKLQ is not affiliated with KLVE, a Spanish-language radio station which has used the name \"K-Love\" in the Los Angeles market continuously since 1974 and holds the trademark locally. Prior to assuming control of KKLQ, EMF reached an agreement with Univision Radio (now known as Uforia Audio Network), owner of KLVE, that allows KKLQ to use the K-Love brand on-air yet requires the station to differentiate itself in its marketing efforts.\n\nThe station at the 100.3 FM frequency debuted in 1957 as a background music station with the call letters KMLA. In 1965, the station became KVXN and then KFOX-FM, the country sister station to KFOX in Long Beach\n\nIn 1972, KFOX-FM was purchased by four businessmen who changed the call letters to KIQQ in an attempt to capitalize on its 100.3 MHz dial location. The following year, with the station's soft rock format failing to gain ratings or billing, KIQQ brought in deposed KHJ heavyweights Bill Drake and Gene Chenault, who contracted to program and manage the station. In spite of bringing in former KHJ powerhouse jocks, including Robert W. Morgan and The Real Don Steele, certain management and programming decisions are believed to have led to the demise of Drake-Chenault's run at KIQQ. By 1975, Morgan and Steele were gone. Ultimately, the station cut costs drastically by airing a generic national format via satellite.\n\nIn the early 1980s, the station dropped its K-100 handle and kept to the calls as \"KIQQ\" with a live and local aggressive top-40 or contemporary hit radio (CHR) format. The on-air lineup included Jeff Thomas, G.W. McCoy (engaged to actress Heather Locklear for a time), and Francesca Cappucci. \"Play Hits for Cash\" was a regular promotion. KIQQ simulcast the NBC television show \"Friday Night Videos\" and even had Wally George as a weekend call-in host. KIQQ also carried \"American Top 40\" beginning in 1983 after competing CHR station KIIS-FM lost the countdown program over the playing of network commercials; this move forced KIIS-FM to create its own chart show, \"Rick Dees Weekly Top 40\".\n\nBy the mid-1980s, CHR competition from KIIS-FM, KKHR, and KBZT proved too intense for KIQQ; KIIS-FM alone had a 10 share in the Arbitron book. On July 29, 1985, KIQQ flipped to a satellite-delivered adult contemporary format as \"100.3 K-Lite\". The format lasted for only four years before the launch of another new format.\n\nIn 1989, KIQQ was sold to Westwood One, which hired Scott Shannon from WHTZ in New York City to program the station. At 5:00 a.m. on March 17, 1989, KIQQ became KQLZ, \"Pirate Radio\", airing a top-40 playlist heavily leaning towards rock. The last song played on KIQQ was \"The End\" by Earl Grant, while the first song on Pirate Radio was \"Welcome to the Jungle\" by Guns N' Roses. While KQLZ played a lot of heavy metal music, they also mixed in some mainstream rock and even a few dance songs by artists like Madonna.\n\nThe first ratings books showed an initial spike, but faded rather quickly once the novelty wore off. KQLZ eventually dropped the dance songs and went completely rock. Shannon was dismissed in February 1991, and he eventually returned to New York to program WPLJ. On December 28, 1992, KQLZ shifted to modern rock and dropped the \"Pirate Radio\" moniker, rebranding as simply \"100.3 FM\" with the slogan \"Southern California's Cutting Edge\".\n\nFinally opting to leave the radio ownership business, Westwood One sold KQLZ to Viacom in 1993, and the new owners ended the rock format on April 2 at 3:00 p.m. Viacom brought KXEZ and its soft adult contemporary format back to life at 100.3 FM after a six-month absence from the FM dial. The KXEZ call letters and format previously resided at 98.7 FM, which in 1992 had become KYSR, \"Star 98.7\". It was during this period that the station hired prostitute Divine Brown to be their television spokesperson soon after her arrest with actor Hugh Grant. \n\nOn August 29, 1996 at noon, KXEZ changed calls to KIBB and flipped to a dance-leaning rhythmic hot AC format, branded as \"B100\" (\"The Rhythm of L.A.\"). The first song on KIBB was \"You Dropped a Bomb on Me\" by The Gap Band. The move was to go after listeners who have become disenfranchised with the increasing hip-hop content at KPWR. The move also came about based on the instant success of WKTU in New York City, which debuted in February of that year. In 1997, the Chancellor company bought KIBB, added current songs to its playlist, and shifted directions to rhythmic contemporary hits. The slogan changed to \"L.A.'s Hot FM\".\n\nDespite the effort and a promotional campaign (one memorable ad featured a large billboard of a Latina woman dancing placed near a building on Broadway in Downtown Los Angeles), KIBB couldn't make a dent in the ratings. After a little over a year and minor tweaks in its playlist and direction, KIBB's fate was sealed when Chancellor decided to drop the format at 5 PM on November 19, 1997 (after a couple of days of teasing a \"major event\" and playing \"I'll Be Missing You\" by Puff Daddy as the final song) for yet another short-lived fad: Rhythmic Oldies as \"Mega 100\". The first song on \"Mega\" was \"The Cisco Kid\" by War. The call letters were changed to KCMG. The format, which drew instant ratings success in the market, was replicated on many stations across the country in the late 1990s (however, many of these stations would flip in the early 2000s due to poor ratings and promotion). Chancellor merged with Capstar in 1999, forming AMFM Inc.\n\nClear Channel Communications merged with AMFM in 2000. Because of the merger, Clear Channel exceeded the radio station ownership limits (5 FM stations, 3 AM stations) in Los Angeles. As a result, Clear Channel decided to keep the stronger 92.3 FM frequency. They chose to sell the 100.3 FM frequency and the intellectual property of KKBT, which was on 92.3, to Radio One. KCMG's format and call letters would be retained and move to 92.3 FM.\n\nWhen the switch was made on June 30, 2000 at 5 p.m., 100.3 FM became KKBT, \"100.3 The Beat\" and 92.3 became KCMG, \"Mega 92.3\". In August 2001, as the \"Jammin' Oldies\" format was starting to fade in popularity, Mega's format on 92.3 morphed into an urban adult contemporary direction and the station became KHHT, \"Hot 92.3\", a direct competitor to KKBT. Soon afterward, KKBT released their morning team of Dre and Ed Lover, as well as afternoon drivers \"The Baka Boyz\".\n\nDuring the first four years under Radio One, KKBT enjoyed modest success as it battled KPWR for the R&B/hip-hop crown. KKBT heavily promoted Steve Harvey as its high-profile morning star and billed itself under the slogan of \"Harvey & Hip-Hop\". However, KKBT never overtook KPWR in the ratings. Harvey was also at odds with station management over the station's hip-hop content and refused to play questionable songs during his show until his departure from the station, when he went to KDAY.\n\nBy 2004, the station began showing signs of erosion in ratings, as it faced new competition. KDAY, which was formerly on 1580 AM, signed on for the first time on FM at 93.5 and debuted its own hip-hop format that September, siphoning off a good number of KKBT listeners. KXOL-FM's flip to Reggaeton in 2005 took many of The Beat's Hispanic listeners. KKBT went through a great deal of turmoil, with several popular air staffers leaving or being dismissed from 2002 through 2006.\n\nOn May 19, 2006 at midnight, KKBT officially threw in the towel as a mainstream urban outlet and flipped to a hybrid urban adult contemporary/urban talk format dubbed \"Rhythm & Talk\". According to the press release that was featured on the station's website: \"The new format, which will engage 25- to 49-year-old adults, takes the best music of urban adult contemporary stations and adds compelling content delivered by proven national personalities Tom Joyner, Ananda Lewis, Michael Baisden, Wendy Williams and Free.\" Although it retained \"The Beat\" branding, the peace sign which was long a staple of The Beat in station logos was discontinued.\n\nHowever, the 'Rhythm and Talk' emphasis did not succeed in the ratings, and the station dropped Free and Lewis first from the lineup. Williams, which aired on tape delay after midnight on weekends, was dropped later, and the \"Tom Joyner Morning Show\" was dropped when it could not compete with Steve Harvey on KDAY. Other on-air staffers also left the station, but Baisden remained until the station's format flip in April 2008. Michael Baisden later landed on KDAY, before being dropped by the station in July 2009.\n\nKKBT was the last full-market hip hop/R&B station to use the Urban format as opposed to Rhythmic, not to mention the only one that covered the entire metro. However, much of its target audience tuned to other stations: Hispanics preferred KPWR and KXOL-FM; African-Americans had KHHT, KJLH, and to a lesser extent KTWV as options; and in the meantime KMVN debuted and targeted older listeners with dance pop from the 1980s to the present day. With that, ratings suffered and speculation grew about its future. Emmis Broadcasting reportedly was interested in the station, but decided not to buy it.\n\nEventually, KKBT elected to go head-to-head with the urban AC formats of KHHT and long-time Compton-based KJLH. The station also hired Cliff Winston away from KJLH for afternoon drive.\n\nIn October 2006, the station began phasing out the \"Beat\" branding and promos would only reference the 100.3 frequency and in December 2006, briefly touted \"Majic\", giving rise to speculation that Radio One would use the \"Majic\" brand, most notably found on sister stations WMMJ in Washington, DC, WWIN-FM in Baltimore, and KMJQ in Houston.\n\nHowever, on December 29, 2006, at 8 a.m., Radio One instead unveiled \"V 100.3\". With that, an Urban heritage based era came to an end: The KKBT call-sign was no more after 16 years, and \"The Beat\" branding was erased as a piece of radio brand history as KKBT was the very first radio station to carry \"The Beat\" moniker (although KDAY briefly revived the branding soon after). With the format flip, the call letters changed to KRBV. (Ironically, KRBV and the moniker \"V 100.3\" were both used on an urban AC station, what is now KJKK, in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex in the mid- to late 1990s.) The imaging was similar in fashion to WRKS in New York City, perhaps a reason being that Barry Mayo, the former general manager for WRKS, was consulting Radio One and thus wanted to use similar imaging for this station.\n\nThe re-imaging and air-staff changes did not help the station's ratings, however. At a stockholders' meeting in 2007, some investors called for KRBV to be sold, but company officials said that they had no such plans. One possible reason for this is that KRBV was the only Radio One-owned-and-operated station in the three leading markets in the U.S.; at the time, they did not own stations in New York City or Chicago. Also, a sale of KRBV would come at a loss to Radio One compared to how much it originally paid for it, possibly because of the residual effects of the frequency swap with KCMG.\n\nOn March 24, 2008, Radio One announced that the station had been sold to Bonneville International for $137.5 million. The transaction closed in the second quarter of 2008. According to a spokesperson for Bonneville, the station would continue to be a music station, although there were rumors that the station would actually flip to news/talk (similar to sister stations KTAR-FM in Phoenix, Arizona, KIRO-FM in Seattle, Washington, and WWWT in Washington, D.C.). On April 3, Bonneville confirmed it would flip the station to adult album alternative. KRBV's air staffers bid farewell to their listeners on their final day, April 7.\n\nOn April 8, 2008, Bonneville took over the operations of KRBV, and dropped the urban AC format at midnight Pacific time. The station then began stunting as \"Bruce Radio 100.3\", playing all of Bruce Springsteen's hits in connection with his show that night at the Honda Center in Anaheim). After ten hours of playing \"the Boss\", followed by the song \"I Love L.A.\" by Randy Newman, KRBV made the following announcement: \"Hello, and welcome to what we hope will be a new beginning for Southern California and music fans everywhere.\" The station then became \"100.3 The Sound\" and the AAA format officially launched, with \"Beautiful Day\" by U2 being the first song played.\n\nThe new station offered listeners a wide selection of rock music, stretching from the 1960s to \"last week\", according to Bonneville vice president of programming Greg Solk and executive VP Drew Horowitz. In an interview from R&R the day of the launch, Bonneville president and chief executive officer Bruce Reese told the music trade publication, \"It’s great to be back in L.A.\" He added that \"we are truly excited about our new station — 100.3 the Sound will be a music station that has absolute respect for the music and that features a broad playlist\".\n\nOn May 14, 2008, new call letters KSWD were officially introduced. The rights to these call letters had to be purchased from an FM station in Seward, Alaska, who then switched to the call sign KKNI-FM.\n\nKSWD's new format and \"The Sound\" logo were loosely patterned after its then-sister station in Cincinnati, WSWD. But whereas KSWD's direction took a broader approach, WSWD focused mostly on 1990s and current fare (WSWD switched to a different format in 2009). KSWD was the fourth station in the Los Angeles radio market to program a Triple-A format. KNX-FM, KSCA and KACD/KBCD all have featured the format in past years. The last of those stations also used the positioning statement \"World Class Rock for Southern California.\"\n\nIn May 2009, KSWD dropped its new music and shifted to classic rock, although its playlist included many more deep album tracks than their nearest competitors, KLOS and KCBS-FM. As a result, KSWD was pulled off of Mediabase's AAA reporting stations panel. Rival KLOS had already switched back to a harder-edged version of the same format.\n\nOn July 10, 2009, KSWD held \"Finally a KMET Friday\", an on-air event paying tribute to the defunct, pioneering Los Angeles rock station KMET. The event featured on-air appearances by former KMET personalities, classic jingles, and much of the music programming from the era, including an airing of Bob Marley & The Wailers's \"Live at the Roxy\" concert. The event was spearheaded by KSWD personality Jeff Gonzer, who was an alumnus of KMET; the station's program director Dave Beasing stated that public response to the event was \"absolutely overwhelming and proof of the emotional connection that a generation of Southern Californians had with KMET\". In 2013, KSWD held a second edition of the event, the \"Mighty Met Weekend\", from November 1 to November 3, 2013.\n\nOn December 8, 2014, KSWD general manager Peter Burton and program director Dave Beasing announced that Mark Thompson would replace Joe Benson in morning drive at KSWD. Benson would move to mid-days and current midday host Andy Chanley would become part of Thompson's show. Thompson hosted his last show on KSWD on August 3, 2016, after which Chanley took his place as morning host. From 1987 to 2012, Thompson co-hosted the morning show on KLOS with Brian Phelps.\n\nOn July 14, 2015, it was announced that Entercom would swap four of its stations in Denver to Bonneville in exchange for KSWD, to comply with ownership limits related to Entercom's acquisition of Lincoln Financial Media's radio stations. Once the purchase was completed on July 17, Entercom began operating KSWD under a time-brokerage agreement, marking the company's entry into the Los Angeles market for the first time, while Bonneville began operating their new cluster in Denver that same day. The swap to Entercom was consummated on November 24, 2015.\n\nOn May 21, 2016, LARadio.com announced that the recently rechristened Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League would air live games on KSWD, alongside AM station KSPN.\n\nOn February 2, 2017, Entercom announced its intent to merge with CBS Radio. The company was required to divest stations in order to comply with ownership limits and on September 26, 2017, the company announced that it would divest KSWD, KSOQ-FM, and WGGI to Educational Media Foundation (EMF) for $57,750,000. KSWD was to be flipped to a contemporary Christian music format as part of EMF's K-Love network. The sale of the three stations to EMF was approved on November 2.\n\nOnce the station was scheduled to switch to K-Love on November 16, 2017, it was also announced that Los Angeles Rams FM radio broadcasts would move to KCBS-FM, beginning with the team's next game on November 19. As the station's final songs as a rock station, morning co-host Andy Chanley played the side-two medley of The Beatles' \"Abbey Road\", concluding with \"The End\". Shortly after a final sign-off by Chanley, KSWD switched to K-Love at 1:00 p.m. Pacific time with the first song aired being Toby Mac's \"Love Broke Thru\". The station also changed to the KKLQ call letters which had been warehoused by a K-Love station in Fargo, North Dakota now known as KLDQ. The KSWD call letters were moved to KMPS-FM, an Entercom-acquired station in Seattle that flipped to a soft AC format and branded itself as \"94.1 The Sound\". Entercom completed its merger with CBS Radio the next day.\n\nEMF was required to reach an agreement with Univision Radio (later known as Uforia Audio Network) in order to use the \"K-Love\" brand in the Los Angeles market. KLVE, a Univision-owned Spanish language AC outlet, has used the name K-Love continuously since 1974; the company holds the trademark to that brand locally. While terms of this agreement were not disclosed, KKLQ markets itself locally as \"Positive, Encouraging 100.3\", and its station identification contains the slogan \"The K-Love for Christian music\", in order to distinguish it from KLVE. In addition, the station markets itself as \"Positive, Encouraging 100.3\" when used in advertising.\n\nKKLQ broadcasts in HD Radio with both its HD1 and HD2 channels providing Artist Experience data including song titles, artists, and albums on compatible radios. Over the years, 100.3 FM has hosted a variety of formats on its HD sub-channels. The current HD sub-channel formats are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2002024", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2002024", "title": "New men", "text": "New men\n\nNew men is a term referring to various groups of the socially upwardly mobile in England during the House of Lancaster, House of York and Tudor periods. The term may refer to the new aristocracy, or the enriched gentry. It is used by some historians when referring to middle class professionals who held important positions in government, most notably during the reign of Henry VII.\n\nIn the late Middle Ages social mobility was not generally seen as a good thing, and could be regarded as dangerous to the social order. There had always been social mobility, as the economy expanded continuously, but much of it was in the church, which was more acceptable. In the 15th century the heavy losses from the Wars of the Roses at the top of society, followed in the 16th by much more rapid economic growth and the English Reformation, after which fewer clergy worked in administrative roles, and which liberated in the Dissolution of the Monasteries vast quantities of assets for the agile nobility and gentry to acquire, all worked to greatly increase upwards mobility at the top of society.\n\nThese new men were most usually lawyers, clerics and financial administrators who had come to the notice of the King and had been granted ministerial positions because of their own skills rather than because of a noble background. Common examples of new men are John Morton, Richard Foxe and Reginald Bray. Cardinal Thomas Wolsey could be considered a new man, although by the time of his rise to power new men were not so new and were in fact becoming the norm within government.\n\nNew men were first used in order to ensure the aristocracy were not allowed to become over-mighty by giving positions to people with little money, land or influence. This was in many respects a success - as it increased efficiency within government by the use of competent ministers and moved away from the previous policy bias towards the nobility. However, many new men used the influence they gained to secure new lands and great wealth and were essentially corrupt. Men like Edmund Dudley and Richard Empson were resented by both the nobles and the general population for the harsh taxes they collected uncompromisingly. This led to their execution on dubious charges of treason.\n\nThe existence of new men has been disputed by several historians, who feel that middle class professionals have always been a part of government throughout British history. Other historians have claimed that the use of new men, rather than being invented by the British Kings, was borrowed from the French monarchs' tendency to use the middle classes to help govern. However, it is commonly agreed that there was a sudden rise in this type of administrator in government towards the end of the 15th century and this, rather than being a paradigm shift, occurred over a sustained period of time.\n\n\n"}

As-grown MgSi usually forms black crystals; they are semiconductors with n-type conductivity and have potential applications in thermoelectric generators.\n\nMgSi crystallizes in the antifluorite structure. In the face-centered cubic lattice Si centers occupy the corners and face-centered positions of the unit cell and Mg centers occupy eight tetrahedral sites in the interior of the unit cell. The coordination numbers of Si and Mg are eight and four, respectively.\n\nIt can be produced by heating silicon dioxide, SiO, found in sand, with excess magnesium. The process first forms silicon metal and magnesium oxide, and, if an excess of SiO is used, then elemental silicon is formed:\nIf an excess of Mg is present, MgSi is formed from the reaction of the remaining magnesium with the silicon:\nThese reactions proceed exothermically.\n\nMagnesium silicide can be viewed as consisting of Si ions. As such it is reactive toward acids. Thus, when magnesium silicide is treated with hydrochloric acid, silane (SiH) and magnesium chloride are produced:\n\nSulfuric acid can be used as well. These protonolysis reactions are typical of a Group 2 and Group 1 silicides.\n\nMagnesium silicide is used to create aluminium alloys of the 6000 series, containing up to approximately 1.5% MgSi. An alloy of this group can be age-hardened to form Guinier-Preston zones and a very fine precipitate, both resulting in increased strength of the alloy.\n\nMagnesium silicide is a narrow-gap semiconductor. Its as-grown crystal exhibit n-type conductivity, but it can changed to p-type by doping with Ag, Ga, Sn and possibly Li (at high doping level). The major potential electronic application of MgSi is in thermoelectric generators.\n"}
{"id": "2002041", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2002041", "title": "Reuben (band)", "text": "Reuben (band)\n\nReuben were an English three-piece musical group from Camberley, Surrey. Their music is a fusion of alternative rock and heavy metal, as their songs cover a variety of styles, ranging from heavy and upbeat, such as their 2005 single \"Blamethrower\" to slower, more melodic songs such as their 2004 single \"Moving to Blackwater\". The former style of song often featured vocalist Jamie Lenman switching between shouting and whispering, a technique often used in heavy metal and post-hardcore music. The band performed in the UK underground music scene. Although they attracted a significant fanbase, Reuben never achieved mainstream success, but did chart four songs in the UK Singles Chart. Their highest charting single was 2004's \"Freddy Kreuger\", that reached UK No. 53.\n\nIn June 2008, Reuben entered a state of indefinite hiatus. Fans were emailed by the band manager, making them aware of the hiatus, assuring them that this was not the end for Reuben.\n\nThe band formed in 1998 when singer/guitarist Jamie Lenman and bassist Jon Pearce originally played with producer Jason Wilson (formerly Wilcock) of Stakeout Studios on drums as Angel, sharing local stages with many bands, one of which would become Hundred Reasons. Between 1998 and 2000, Angel recorded and self-released a string of limited edition demos. The songs and artwork of one of these demos, \"Betrayed\", was available to download via the band's website. Many Angel songs were used as b-sides to Reuben singles.\n\nIn March 2000, they parted ways with Wilson, and Mark Lawton joined as drummer, with whom they wrote and recorded the \"Pilot\" EP, which was released in January 2001 on the Badmusic label after they changed their name to Reuben. The group decided to go ahead with recording the EP after they had won a battle of the bands in Bookham, Surrey, in front of a panel of 12-year-olds. Following the release of \"Pilot EP\", Lawton left and was replaced by their final drummer, Guy Davis. The new line-up toured around the UK, and were the subject of a two-hour special on Zane Lowe's XFM Radio Show, despite not yet releasing an album.\n\nTheir debut album \"Racecar Is Racecar Backwards\" was released in June 2004 through Xtra Mile Recordings. Jason Wilson produced the album at Stakeout Studios which at the time was based in Chobham. It spawned the chart singles \"Freddy Kreuger\" and \"Moving To Blackwater\", and led to their nomination for a \"Kerrang!\" Award for Best British Newcomer. Their many singles were popular on the underground music scene, receiving airplay on MTV2.\n\n2005 saw the release of the band's second album, \"Very Fast Very Dangerous\" on Xtra Mile Recordings, spawning a further three singles, including the download-only \"Blamethrower\". The album received reasonable reviews, the BBC giving it a 4/5 rating, and many of the songs featured on this album were performed regularly by the band.\n\nIn September 2005, the band played a three-song live set on the Zane Lowe show on BBC Radio 1 in support of the then-upcoming album. The set featured a cover version of the Gorillaz song \"Feel Good Inc.\", as well as two songs from the second album, \"Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em\" and then upcoming single \"Keep It to Yourself\".\n\nIn September 2006, the band toured around the UK and Europe with Canadian punk band Billy Talent. This was the first time that Reuben played in Europe.\n\nOn 20 November 2006, the band returned to the studio to record their third album, \"In Nothing We Trust\". It was produced by Sean Genockey with Jack Rushton in Livingstone Studios, London. The album featured three guest vocalists, Frank Turner, Hannah Clark (the singer from the Hampshire-based band, Arthur) and Paul Townsend (formerly of Hundred Reasons). Throughout recording the band uploaded short videos on YouTube for each day in the studio. The album was released on 25 June 2007 via Hideous Records.\n\nReuben were also featured on the \"Print Is Dead Vol. 1\" project by the UK band on the track \"Captain of Lies\".\n\nThe band released their first DVD, a double-disc offering named \"What Happens in Aldershot Stays in Aldershot\", on 19 March 2007. The DVD featured both a documentary of life in the band and a full recording of the band's show at London's Mean Fiddler on 27 April 2006 (including an audio commentary).\n\nOn 13 January 2007, Reuben announced that they would be running their own label, Hideous Records in order to have more control over future releases. The video for the first single from their next album, \"Blood, Bunny, Larkhall\" was posted on their website on 7 May 2007. The track was released on 18 June 2007.\n\nTheir third album, \"In Nothing We Trust\" was released to critical acclaim, receiving 9/10 from \"Rocksound\", 4/5 from \"Kerrang!\" and \"Q\" magazine and 8/10 from \"Hot Press\". The second single from the album, \"Deadly Lethal Ninja Assassin\" (featuring Frank Turner of Million Dead fame) was released on 24 September. The band released a new track, \"Christmas is Awesome\", for download on 17 December in an attempt to make Christmas No. 1 but, due to an error the wrong song was registered for chart inclusion, and therefore the song was disqualified from chart entry.\n\nThe third and final song to be released from the album, \"Cities On Fire\" was released in March 2008 as a part of the \"TwoByThree EP\". The EP also featured the bands Baddies and The Ghost of a Thousand, both of whom accompanied Reuben on a nationwide tour in support of the EP.\n\nIn June 2008 Reuben stopped recording and performing, and cancelled their planned July performance at the 2000 Trees Festival. Following the band's split, all three members went off into their own directions. Lenman stopped playing music for over a year to focus on his illustration work. However, after years of receiving letters from fans he was encouraged to get back into music which led to him releasing his debut solo album \"Muscle Memory\" in late 2013.. Pearce and Davis however started the band Freeze the Atlantic and would go on to create 3 albums with that band before their eventual split in 2018.\n\nOn 24 July 2009, the Reuben website was updated to advertise a new rarities collection entitled \"We Should Have Gone To University\". The collection, released in August 2009, contained every non-album track the band released as well as rare demos and session tracks. In addition there was a DVD containing the band's full set at 2007's Download Festival as well as interviews, documentaries and all of the band's music videos. The artwork for the collection was drawn by Lenman, and the collection was issued on Xtra Mile Recordings.\n\nIn June 2019, Guy Davis joined Lenman for his show at The Palm House in Belfast. He would then join Lenman as one of two of the touring drummer's on Lenman's tour for his third solo album \"Shuffle.\"\n\nIn 2005, the band members, under the name of Los Skeletos (A reference to the video for the band's single Freddy Kreuger) posted alternative recordings of Reuben songs on their music player. Los Skeletos played a string of gigs in the same year, playing some Reuben hits, but also new songs with which Reuben fans would be unfamiliar. \n\n\n"}

It is currently the ninth tallest building in the city. The building's current name dates to January 2002.\n\nConstruction began in 1978 and was completed in 1980. It was named the Orbanco Building, for its largest tenant, Orbanco Inc., which at the time of groundbreaking was set to lease around 30 percent of the space. That company's two largest subsidiaries, Oregon Bank (established in 1887) and Northwest Acceptance Corporation, were set to be headquartered in the building. Oregon Bank moved to the new building from another downtown location in March 1980. The building earned Gold Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification from the U.S. Green Building Council in 2012 for its sustainability. American Realty Advisors and Unico Properties LLC purchased the building in December 2016 for $85 million from Shorenstein Properties.\n\nThe firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM) designed what is now Congress Center, with reflective dark glass that contrasts with the mostly white or lighter colored architecture common in Portland's architectural history. However, the highly reflective surface of Congress Center's glass curtain walls reflect all the nearby buildings. Most notable are 1000 Broadway, the Portland Building and Multnomah County Courthouse.\n\nThe current name is the fourth name the building has carried. Opened in 1980 as the Orbanco Building, it was renamed Security Pacific Plaza in April 1989, as the building housed the Oregon headquarters of Security Pacific Bank, which had acquired Oregon Bank in 1987. Security Pacific was taken over by Bank of America in 1992, and in 1994 Security Pacific Plaza was renamed \"1001 Fifth Avenue\", a condensed version of the building's address. That name gave way to the current one, Congress Center, in January 2002. This name is taken from the former Congress Hotel, located on the site from 1912 until 1977.

In turn, it was abolished by Executive Order 9361, July 15, 1943, and the functions were transferred to the newly created Office of Economic Warfare, OEM, which also assumed control of U.S. Commercial Company, Rubber Development Corporation, Petroleum Reserves Corporation, and Export-Import Bank of Washington from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. Consolidated into the Foreign Economic Administration, 1943.\n\nVice President Henry A. Wallace chaired the Economic Defense Board, the Supply Priorities and Allocation Board, and the Board of Economic Warfare as a member of President Roosevelt's secret \"war cabinet\".\n\nDivided into an Office of Imports, Office of Exports, and Office of War Analysis, the Board of Economic Warfare (BEW) supported the Allied war effort through procurement of strategic resources. As chairman, Wallace freed himself to deal with long-term policy matters by delegating the day-to-day management of the BEW to Milo Perkins, an associate from the Department of Agriculture. Like many special boards created by President Roosevelt, the BEW came in for its share of interdepartmental bickering, rivalries, and conflicts of authority.\n\nWhen Roosevelt signed an executive order in April 1942 allowing the BEW to negotiate contracts with foreign governments, Secretary of State Cordell Hull saw it as an attempt to create a second State Department. Wallace was convinced that the Latin American rubber supply could be increased if living standards of that region's rubber workers were raised to reduce the incidence of chronic malnutrition and malaria. He attempted to force negotiated contracts to provide for improvements to the Latin American infrastructure, with the United States funding half the cost of these programs. Wallace's acquisition of executive authority had been unpopular with the rank and file in Congress, and most members supported Hull, a former senator, in his attacks on the BEW and its chairman.\n\nThe BEW controversy climaxed in February 1943, when Wallace tried to place the purchasing authority of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) under the BEW's jurisdiction. Commerce Secretary Jesse Jones denounced Wallace's action. When Wallace retaliated by accusing Jones of delaying shipments of quinine to Marines dying of malaria, the imbroglio became too hot for Roosevelt to ignore. The embattled vice president wrote to the president, asking for either complete vindication for his actions in the matter or relief of his duties as chairman of the BEW. Roosevelt responded on July 15, 1943, by dissolving the BEW and reconstituting its function under a new Foreign Economic Administration, headed by Leo Crowley, a known supporter of Jones.\n"}

{"id": "2002056", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2002056", "title": "Rolle Canal", "text": "Rolle Canal\n\nThe Rolle Canal (or Torrington Canal) in north Devon, England, extends from its mouth into the River Torridge at Landcross 6 miles southwards to the industrial mills and corn-mills at Town Mills (now called \"Orford Mill\"), Rosemoor, Great Torrington and beyond to Healand Docks and weir on the Torridge, where survive the ruins of Lord Rolle's limekilns, upstream of today's Rosemoor Garden. Town Mills were built by Lord Rolle and were powered by a stream which flowed past his seat of Stevenstone to the east of Great Torrington and also supplied water to the canal. Rosemoor and North and South Healand farms were part of Lord Rolle's Stevenstone estate on the east bank of the Torridge.\n\nThe canal comprises a sea lock at Landcross, a 60-foot inclined plane at Weare Giffard and an aqueduct of five arches over the River Torridge at Beam.\nAt the terminus of the canal at the limekilns at Rosemoor a leat supplies the canal to ensure a constant water level, which channels-off water from the River Torridge at Healand (or Darkham) Weir, rebuilt in 1837.\n\nThe canal terminates beyond \"Rowes Moor\" (modern: Rosemoor) at a group of lime kilns designed by James Green. These consist of five large pots, each one 14 ft in diameter and 20 ft deep, arranged consecutively in a straight line along a wharf. Railway tracks led from the canal up a ramp to the top of the pots where a flat area existed for the storage of lime and fuel (culm/anthracite) pending burning. An office for the site forman was situated at the upper level. These kilns are derelict in 2013.\n\nThe construction of the canal started in 1823 as a private venture financed largely by John Rolle, 1st Baron Rolle (died 1842), one of whose principal seats was at Stevenstone, east of Great Torrington. He was the largest landowner in Devon and owned much land around Torrington, including the estate of Beam, where continues to exist a mansion house which had served as a home for junior members of the Rolle family. Other shareholders in the company were William Tardrew of Annery, Monkleigh and Richard Pine-Coffin of Portledge, who owned land on which the northerly section of the canal was constructed between the Rolle estate of Beam and the end of the canal at Landcross.\n\nThe canal was built largely without permission, with an act of Parliament eventually being granted for this purpose in 1835. The idea for the canal had been proposed originally by Lord Rolle's father Denys Rolle but for various reasons nothing had come of those plans. The function of the canal was to import limestone from Wales to be burnt with coal, also imported, at inland kilns to make lime fertiliser which would greatly increase the fertility, and thus the value, of agricultural land. Marland Clay, mined south of Torrington, was to be exported via the seaport of Bideford, at the estuary of the River Torridge, for the making of bricks.\n\nMore generally the canal was to link the industrial mills at Great Torrington, some of which were owned by Lord Rolle, to the seaport of Bideford on the River Torridge. James Green was employed as the lead engineer. Lord Rolle laid the foundation stone of the aqueduct in a ceremony which included the firing of a cannon, which unfortunately exploded, causing injury to a man by the name of John Hopgood, whom Rolle compensated with a year's salary. A stone tablet on the north parapet of the Beam Aqueduct is inscribed: The first stone of this aqueduct was laid by the Right Honourable John Lord Rolle, Baron Rolle of Stevenstone in the county of Devon, on the 11th day of August 182(1?) in the presence of the mayor, corporation and feoffees of Great Torrington and other persons assembled to witness the commencement of the (word chiselled out) CANAL undertaken at the sole expense of his Lordship. James Green Engineer. The canal was completed in 1827 at a cost of between £40,000 and £45,000. The canal shared many design features with the Bude Canal, unsurprisingly as the Bude Canal had partly inspired the scheme and shared the same lead engineer. Similarities included the use of trains of tub boats and of canal inclined planes rather than locks. The inclined plane was powered by a water wheel. The canal received its water supply from a weir on the River Torridge which also supplied two mills with power.\n\nIn about 1852, some ten years after Lord Rolle's death, the canal was leased to George Braginton (1808–1886), of Moor House, St Giles in the Wood, (the centre of the Rolle's Stevenstone estate) several times Mayor of Great Torrington, described in 1830 as \"canal agent to Lord Rolle, and Portuguese vice consul for the Devonshire coast, in the Bristol channel\".\n\nGeorge's father was Richard II Braginton (1784–1869), of Great Silver, in the parish of Great Torrington, employed by Lord Rolle since 1814 and described in Lord Rolle's will proved in 1842 as \"my steward at Stevenstone\" was bequeathed £200, with a further £40 to \"William Braginton one of his sons\". Richard II thus played the important role of steward of Stevenstone during the time of Mark Rolle's minority from the death of Lord Rolle in 1842 to 1856. Thus it was possibly Richard II who advised the trustees of Mark Rolle to grant the lease to his son. Richard II married Ann Dwerryhouse of Liverpool in 1806.\n\nGeorge's grandfather was Richard I Braginton (1752–1812) who had been quartermaster-serjeant of the South Devon Militia, of which Lord Rolle was colonel. He died at Leicester and had been well regarded by Lord Rolle who erected a gravestone to his memory in St Martin's Church, Leicester, inscribed as follows:\nBeneath are deposited the remains of Richard Braginton Quarter Master Serjeant of the South Devon Militia who expir'd suddenly in this Town on his march to Nottingham in the night of 15th of February 1812 after retiring to rest in perfect health AGED 60 YEARS He served 40 in the said Regiment with unabated Zeal, diligence and Loyalty to his King; and firm attachment to his Country; While his private conduct was equally commendable. For Rectitude, Probity and Sobriety He was esteem'd by his Officers and beloved by his fellow Soldiers. To perpetuate the remembrance of his worth, This stone was caus'd to be erected By his Colonel Lord ROLLE. Reader! may this additional Example of the awful uncertainty of Life prove a warning to thee to prepare for a similar fate, by a faithful discharge of the duties of thy station; and by an humble reliance on the merits of thy Redeemer.\n\nGeorge was a merchant and banker, and owned at least one ship, the \"Margaret\", a brigantine of 139 tons built in Bideford in 1835. This was later owned by his younger brother William Dwerryhouse Braginton (died 1888), merchant and substantial shipowner of Northam, near Bideford, who was declared bankrupt in 1879 and died at Bristol in 1888. George had also become bankrupt in 1865 on the failure of his bank, Braginton, Rimington & Co. He then faced several lawsuits for his \"rash and hazardous dealings\", and moved away to Compton Giffard. In 1874 his bankruptcy was discharged. He died in 1886 and was buried in Ford Park Cemetery, Plymouth.\n\nGeorge had six children by his wife Margaret Grace Vicary (died 1868), but his only two sons both died as infants, George Vicary Braginton (1840–1842) and Richard George Braginton (1849–1850). George erected a large chest tomb to his infant sons in St Giles's churchyard, and later next to it he buried his parents Richard II Braginton (died 1869) and Ann Dwerryhouse (died 1866), commemorated by a gravestone.\n\nExactly when the lease to George Braginton ended is unknown, but certainly no later than 1865. On the termination of the lease, control of the canal passed to Lord Rolle's adoptive heir Mark Rolle (1835–1907), a younger son of Lord Clinton and the nephew of his second wife.\n\nIn 1871 the canal was closed and sold to the London and South Western Railway to form the trackway of the proposed new railway from Bideford to Torrington. At one point the railway company wished to abandon the project but at Mark Rolle's insistence the railway was built. The track followed the canal in several stretches, not sitting within the former canal but on elevated ground beside it. The railway was dismantled during the 20th century and the trackway now forms part of the Tarka Trail cycleway.\n\nSome parts of the canal are still visible today, including the Beam Aqueduct, now a viaduct carrying a new entrance drive to Beam Mansion, now an adventure holiday centre. The sea lock also survives, without its gates, as do parts of the inclined plane. The Annery kiln near Weare Giffard lies close to the old canal, between it and the River Torridge, and is visible from the Tarka Trail. The canal has been designated a Devon County Wildlife Site.\n\nThe Beam section of the canal is still owned by the heir of Lord Rolle, Lord Clinton and is managed by the family's management company, Clinton Devon Estates, still possibly the largest landowner in Devon.\n\nParts of the canal have been under restoration since 1988. Clinton Devon Estates plan to restore the Beam estate section of the canal after 2013, and in 2000 completed restoration of the old stone bridge which took the old driveway from Beam Mansion northward over the canal, which passes under through a narrow tunnel. Some work on the sea lock was carried out in 2006 involving re-pointing and rebuilding the eastern wall.\n\nThe Beam Aqueduct is referred to as the \"canal bridge\" in Henry Williamson's \"Tarka the Otter\".\n\n\n"}

Derbyshire and Brian Hodgson, then both former members of electronic music project \"Unit Delta Plus\", joined Vorhaus to form the band.\n\nIn June 1969 White Noise released the groundbreaking album \"An Electric Storm\" on Island Records. The album was created using a variety of tape manipulation techniques, and used the first British synthesizer, the EMS Synthi VCS3. Amongst many oddities, the first track on the album, \"Love Without Sound\", employed sped-up tape edits of Vorhaus playing the double bass to create violin and cello sounds. Although not initially commercially successful for Island, the album is now considered an important and influential album in the development of electronic music, namechecked by contemporary artists like The Orb and Julian Cope, influencing contemporary acts such as Broadcast, Add N to (X), and Secret Chiefs 3. Peter Kember of Spacemen 3 included 'Firebird' on his 2004 curated compilation \"Spacelines\".\n\nFollowing the departure of Derbyshire and Hodgson, to pursue other projects, Vorhaus released a second album, the largely instrumental \"White Noise II - Concerto for Synthesizer\" on Virgin Records in 1974. It was recorded in his own studio in Camden, North London. The album further utilized the EMS VCS 3, as well as prototype sequencers. A third album, the single track 'space fantasy' \"White Noise III - Re-Entry\" was released by Pulse Records in 1980. A further two albums were released, the atmospheric \"White Noise IV - Inferno\" (AMP Music) (1990) incorporated the use of samples, and \"White Noise V - Sound Mind\" (AMP Music; 2000), an experiment in what Vorhaus called \"dark ambient\".\n\n\"\"It means I won't be getting on Top Of The Pops, but I felt the category was broad enough that I could redefine it in ways that I couldn't redefine other genres, such as country and western - much as I'd like to!

He is also the vocalist and guitarist for heavy metal bands Silvertomb and Seventh Void, and sometimes the touring guitarist for Danzig. All three bands also feature fellow Type O Negative member Johnny Kelly on drums.\n\nHickey was born in New York City in 1966. He was asked to join Type O Negative after former Carnivore guitarist Marc Piovanetti declined. Hickey was a childhood friend of the band, growing up in the same neighborhood as the band members. He has been on every Type O Negative release with fellow members Peter Steele and Josh Silver (Johnny Kelly joined in 1994).\n\nIn the early days of Type O Negative, Hickey could be seen playing a black Gibson Flying V. He played this for the music video of “Christian Woman.” He then switched to a black Gibson SG, to which he added green accessories (knobs and pickups and a green painted fretboard), and would continue to follow this trend. Starting in 1996, he used Fernandes Guitars, starting with a Raven Elite Sustainer and Revolver Sustainer with the green additions like his previous SG. He would use this for over half a decade. He would always use the Raven live, but as seen on the music video for “I Don't Wanna Be Me,” he could be seen using a Monterey Deluxe (without EMGs) in satin black, with a green fingerboard. In 2007, he began using Schecter guitars, most prominently a green C-1 Baritone. Unlike his previous guitars, this has true green inlays, exposed pickups (A Seymour Duncan SH-4 “JB” bridge, and a Sustainiac neck pickup), and the body, including the headstock, the back of the headstock and the back of the neck is entirely green. All Hickey’s guitars have invariably been tuned to B Standard throughout his career.\n\nHickey's early rig (before \"World Coming Down\") consisted of ADA MP-1 & MP-2 preamps or a Marshall JMP-1 with an Alesis Quadraverb running into Marshall 9005 and/or Mosvalve 500 power amps, which were run into one or more Marshall 4x12s w/ G12-75 speakers. During the recording of \"World Coming Down\", Hickey used a Mesa/Boogie dual rectifier, and still uses it, along with a Mesa Boogie Mark IV, as a backup. His main setup consists of a Mesa Boogie TriAxis preamp and TC Electronics G-Force effects processor being sent to a Mesa Boogie Simul-Class 2: Ninety power amp into one or more Mesa Boogie 4x12 cabinets. In the early days he may have used Dean Markley 10-52 gauged strings for B tuning. Today he uses Ernie Ball Not Even Slinky 12-56.\n\nWhile performing with Seventh Void, he could be seen using Mesa/Boogie dual rectifiers and Schecter Solo-6 guitars in either a black finish (seen in the music video for “Last Walk In The Light”), or Sunburst (seen in the music video for “Heaven is Gone”).\n\nIn late 2012, Schecter announced an artist model based on his custom baritone he used near the end of his Type O Negative tenure.\n\n"}

He hit .291. Taveras was the Astros' starting center fielder during his rookie season (2005), replacing Carlos Beltrán, who signed with the New York Mets in the offseason. In Game 4 of the 2005 NLCS against the St. Louis Cardinals, he made a catch while running up Tal's Hill in Minute Maid Park's deep center field to end the 8th inning and preserve a 2-1 lead. He scored the winning run as a pinch-runner the inning before on a short sacrifice fly to center field.\n\nAfter the season, Taveras was voted National League Rookie of the Year by the players (Ryan Howard of the Philadelphia Phillies won the actual Rookie of the Year Award).\n\nIn , Taveras' batting average regressed to .278, though he again led the majors in bunt hits (21) and had 33 stolen bases (10th in the NL), but just 30 RBI. Taveras had a 30-game hitting streak that ended August 29, 2006, during a game in which he was hit twice by Milwaukee Brewers pitcher Tomo Ohka. His streak is a franchise record, breaking the record of 25 previously held by Jeff Kent. He is the 42nd player in MLB history with a hit streak of 30-or-more games.\n\nOn December 12, 2006, Taveras was traded along with Taylor Buchholz and Jason Hirsh by the Astros to the Colorado Rockies for Rockies pitchers Jason Jennings and Miguel Asencio.\n\nIn 2007, Taveras hit .320, including an MLB leading 27 bunt singles, 2 home runs, 24 RBIs, 33 stolen bases, and caught stealing 9 times.

The Rockies were swept by the Red Sox.\n\nIn a 22-inning game played between April 17–18, , at Petco Park, Taveras set a Rockies' club record with 10 at-bats in the game.\n\nHe led MLB with 68 stolen bases during the 2008 season, and led the NL with 24 bunt hits. At the same time, his .296 slugging percentage was the lowest in the majors. Defensively, however, he had the lowest fielding percentage of all major league center fielders, .976. \n\nOn December 12, 2008, the Rockies non-tendered Taveras, making him a free agent.\n\nOn December 27, 2008, Taveras signed a two-year deal worth $6.25 million with the Cincinnati Reds.\nIn his debut with the Reds, he hit a pinch-hit triple in the 8th inning after being down with the flu for over a week.\n\nIn 2009, Taveras had the lowest slugging percentage, .285, and the lowest on-base percentage, .275, of all National League players with at least 350 plate appearances. On February 1, 2010, Taveras was traded along with Adam Rosales to the Oakland Athletics for Aaron Miles and a player to be named later. He was later designated for assignment by Oakland. Taveras declined a Triple-A assignment and was granted free agency.\n\nOn February 15, 2010, Taveras signed a minor league contract with the Washington Nationals with an invite to spring training. He played 27 games, and on May 21, 2010 he was granted his unconditional release.\n\nOn June 3, 2010, he signed a minor league contract with the Philadelphia Phillies. He was assigned to Triple-A Lehigh Valley.\n\nOn June 29, 2010, he was released after playing 23 games for the IronPigs, batting .208 in 96 AB's, with nine stolen bases.\n\nOn August 15, 2010, Taveras signed a minor league deal with the Texas Rangers.\n\nOn January 25, 2011, Taveras signed a minor league contract with the Colorado Rockies.

Due to problems with the sports agency that formerly represented him Taveras was out of American baseball for the entire 2012 season.\n\nOn December 11, 2012, Taveras was signed to a minor league contract by the Kansas City Royals with an invitation to spring training. At the time of the signing Taveras was playing baseball in the Mexican Pacific League with the Yaquis de Obregón.\n\nTaveras signed with the Sugar Land Skeeters of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball for the 2015 season. This was Taveras first year in Independent Baseball.\n\nOn April 11, 2016, Taveras signed with the Pericos de Puebla of the Mexican Baseball League.\n\nOn February 21, 2017, Taveras, along with Chad Gaudin, Daric Barton, Nyjer Morgan, Manny Rodriguez, and Rodolfo Amador, were traded to the Acereros de Monclova in exchange for RHP Joaquín Lara. He became a free agent following the 2017 season.\n\nOn May 13, 2019, after spending all of 2018 out of professional baseball, Taveras signed with the Sugar Land Skeeters of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. He was released on July 22, 2019. \n\nTaveras has good skills for slap-hitting; however, he strikes out frequently (103 times in 2005) and rarely walks. His career-high in walks is 36, resulting in a low on-base percentage. In addition, Taveras is an exceptionally poor power hitter, producing the lowest slugging percentage among all regular major league outfielders for both the 2005 and 2006 seasons. He has great speed and has been clocked at 3.57 seconds from home to first as a right-handed hitter. Taveras has also led the league in infield singles, and his BABIP (batting average on balls in play) was .374 in 2007.\n\n\n"}

At Ruston High School in Ruston, Louisiana, he was given the nickname, \"The Ruston Rifle.\" Jones played college football at Louisiana State University (LSU). He is the son of former NFL running back Dub Jones of the Cleveland Browns. He was named the NFL Most Valuable Player in 1976 with the Colts. In 2016, Jones was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.\n\nJones attended LSU in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where he played for the LSU Tigers football team. While at LSU, Jones only started two games prior to the end of his junior year, but he started every game thereafter, leading LSU to a 12–2–1 record.\n\nIn 1971, Jones threw for 945 yards with nine touchdowns and four interceptions while splitting time with Paul Lyons. Against the wishes of LSU fans, Jones was forced to share quarterback duties with Lyons because of Jones' bickering with head coach Charlie McClendon over signal calling. Lyons himself threw for over 800 yards and 11 touchdowns that year.\n\nIn 1972 after taking over at quarterback, Jones threw for 1,446 yards with 14 touchdowns and seven interceptions on 199 pass attempts. Except for one week, LSU spent the entire season ranked in the AP Top 10. One of Jones' most famous moments came in the 1972 LSU vs. Ole Miss game, when he led LSU to a 17–16 last-second victory by hitting running back Brad Davis in the end zone for a touchdown as time expired. To this day, many believe that a clock malfunction on the previous play gave four seconds for Jones to complete the game-winning touchdown pass for LSU. After the season, Jones became the first quarterback in LSU history to be awarded consensus All-America honors. Jones also finished fourth in the vote for the Heisman Trophy and was named the national collegiate Player of the Year by \"The Sporting News\".\n\nDuring his 17 games at LSU, Jones completed 52.6 percent of his passes for 3,225 yards and 28 touchdowns, which at the time was the most career passing yards and touchdowns of any quarterback in school history.\n\nIn 2016, Jones was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.\n\nJones was projected by NFL scouts to be the first quarterback drafted in 1973. He was chosen second overall by the Baltimore Colts to be the Colts' heir apparent to Johnny Unitas, who was later traded to San Diego. His debut came on September 16, 1973 in a loss to the Cleveland Browns. During his eight-year tenure as the Colts' starting quarterback, Jones and his teammates enjoyed three consecutive AFC East division titles (1975–77). But in each of those years, the Colts lost in the first round of the playoffs. The 1977 playoff game (known as Ghost to the Post) is famous as the fourth longest game in NFL history; the Colts fell to the Oakland Raiders, 37–31. Jones missed most of 1978 and 1979 with a shoulder injury, and the Colts fell to last place in the AFC East those two seasons.\n\nThe 1976 regular season was Jones' finest as a professional; he threw for 3,104 yards and a career-high 24 touchdowns, compiling a passer rating of 102.5. He was one of only three quarterbacks to achieve a 100+ passer rating during the entire decade of the 1970s, joining Dallas' Roger Staubach (1971) and Oakland's Ken Stabler (1976). Jones was honored by the Associated Press as 1976's NFL Most Valuable Player and NFL Offensive Player of the Year, selected first-team All-Pro, and named to the Pro Bowl team. He was also selected second-team All-Pro following the 1977 season.\n\nDuring an October 26, 1980 game against the St. Louis Cardinals, Jones made NFL history when he was sacked a record 12 times. This broke the record at the time held by many quarterbacks, including Jones' then back-up, Greg Landry, who had been sacked 11 times while he was a member of the Detroit Lions in a game against the Dallas Cowboys on October 6, 1975.\n\nIn 1982, his final season, Jones played in four games for the Los Angeles Rams before a neck injury forced him to retire.\n\nIn 1990, Jones participated in the first NFL Quarterback Challenge. He finished first in the retiree category and third in the regular competition (The regular competition taking the top three finishers from the alumni competition and adding them to the regular field of current quarterbacks). Given his strong performance, Bobby Beathard, then the general manager of the Chargers, wanted Jones to come out of retirement, but Jones was 38 at the time and chose not to try a comeback.\n\nThe widely respected scout Ernie Accorsi is quoted as saying that if Bert Jones had played under different circumstances, he probably would have been the greatest player ever. John Riggins has been quoted as saying Jones was the toughest competitor he has ever witnessed. On the eve of Super Bowl XLII, New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick, in discussing his choices for the greatest quarterbacks of all time, described Jones as the best \"pure passer\" he had ever seen.\n"}
{"id": "2002104", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2002104", "title": "Halloween II (1981 film)", "text": "Halloween II (1981 film)\n\nHalloween II is a 1981 American slasher film directed by Rick Rosenthal in his directorial debut, written and produced by John Carpenter and Debra Hill, and starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence who reprise their respective roles as Laurie Strode and Dr. Sam Loomis. It is the second installment in the \"Halloween\" film series and originally served as a direct sequel to \"Halloween\" (1978), until it was retconned by the 2018 film serving as a direct sequel to the 1978 film. \nThe plot picks up directly after the first film, with Michael Myers following survivor Laurie Strode to the local hospital, while his psychiatrist Dr. Loomis continues his pursuit of him.\n\nThough Carpenter and Hill co-wrote the screenplay to the sequel, Carpenter was reluctant to extend his involvement and refused to direct, instead appointing the direction to Rosenthal. Stylistically, \"Halloween II\" reproduces certain key elements that made the original \"Halloween\" a success, such as first-person camera perspectives, and the film picks up right at the end of the cliffhanger ending of the original film and was intended to finish the story of Michael Myers and Laurie Strode. It also introduces the plot twist of Laurie Strode being the sister of Michael Myers, a feature that would inform the narrative arc of the series in every subsequent film, including Rob Zombie's remake and its sequel, but was dropped from the 2018 film trilogy. \nFilming took place in the spring of 1981, primarily at Morningside Hospital in Los Angeles, California, on a budget of $2.5 million.\n\n\"Halloween II\" was distributed by Universal Pictures, and premiered in the United States on October 30, 1981. The film was a box office success, grossing over $25 million domestically, though it received mixed reviews, with praise for its performances and atmosphere, but drew significant attention from film critics who criticized its overt violence and gore comparative to the original film. Years later, it has been considered one of the series' best films, usually only behind the 1978 original film. Originally, \"Halloween II\" was intended to be the last chapter of the \"Halloween\" series to revolve around Michael Myers and the town of Haddonfield, but after the lackluster reaction to \"\" (1982), Michael Myers was brought back six years later in \"\" (1988).\n\nOn October 31, 1978, Michael Myers is shot and falls off a balcony. Taking shelter to recover from his injuries, Michael steals a kitchen knife from the home of an elderly couple, and kills a teenage girl living next door. Laurie Strode, who narrowly avoided being killed by Michael earlier in the night, is taken to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital, while Michael's psychiatrist, Dr. Sam Loomis, continues his pursuit of his patient. Accompanied by Sheriff Leigh Brackett, Loomis mistakes teenager Ben Tramer for Michael, when Ben gets hit by a squad car which pins him to another vehicle that bursts into flames, killing him. Upon learning his daughter Annie was killed by Michael, Sheriff Brackett goes off duty to inform his wife, leaving Deputy Gary Hunt in charge to help Loomis.\n\nAt the hospital, paramedic Jimmy becomes attracted to Laurie. Michael discovers Laurie's location after overhearing a news broadcast and makes his way to the hospital. Upon arrival, he cuts the phone lines and disables the cars. He wanders the halls in search of Laurie, killing security guards, doctors, and nurses that get in his way. Jimmy and nurse Jill Franco search the hospital for Laurie, who is trying to evade Michael. Jimmy finds the corpse of head nurse Virginia Alves and slips in a pool of blood on the floor, hitting his head and passing out. While Laurie wanders the hospital, she has a few dreams in which she recalls learning that she was adopted and had been with a pre-teen Michael. Meanwhile, Loomis is informed that Michael had broken into the local elementary school. As he investigates, he discovers clues connecting Michael to Samhain and the occult which might explain his apparent indestructibility, but his colleague, Marion Chambers, arrives to escort him back to Smith's Grove on the governor's orders under the enforcement of a US Marshal. Along the way, Marion tells Loomis that Laurie is Michael's sister; Laurie was put up for adoption after the death of Michael's parents, with the records sealed to protect the family. With the realization that Michael is after Laurie and being told that she was taken to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital, Loomis forces the Marshal to drive back to Haddonfield.\n\nAfter killing Jill, Michael finds and pursues Laurie through the hospital. She flees to the parking lot, and hides in Jimmy's car. Jimmy has awakened and he exits the hospital. He gets in his car with Laurie and attempts to drive away but he passes out again on the steering wheel horn, which alerts Michael of Laurie's location. Loomis, Marion, and the Marshal reach the hospital just in time to save Laurie, and Loomis shoots Michael six times. While Marion attempts to call the police, Michael awakens and kills the Marshal. \n\nMichael chases Loomis and Laurie into an operating theatre and stabs Loomis in the stomach with a scalpel. Laurie blinds Michael by shooting him in the eyes. As Michael staggers around trying to find them, Loomis and Laurie fill the room with nitrous oxide gas. Loomis orders Laurie to run and proceeds to ignite the gas, immolating Michael and himself in an explosion. Michael, engulfed in flames, follows Laurie out of the room before finally collapsing. The next morning, Laurie is transferred to another hospital.\n\nIn a deleted ending, Laurie finds Jimmy alive in the back of the ambulance.\n\n\nCarpenter and Hill, the writers of the first \"Halloween\", had originally considered setting the sequel a few years after the events of \"Halloween\". They planned to have Myers track Laurie Strode to her new home in a high-rise apartment building. However, the setting was later changed to Haddonfield Hospital in script meetings. Tommy Lee Wallace, who served on the crew of the original film, stated that \"no one was all that excited\" over the prospect of a sequel, but producer Irwin Yablans was eager to make a second film. When Yablans approached him about the project, Carpenter was in the midst of developing \"The Fog\" (1980). According to Yablans, he had planned to produce \"The Fog\" for Carpenter, but that Robert Rehme intervened and acquired production rights with his company, Embassy Pictures. A lawsuit between Yablans and Rehme ensued, after which it was determined that Embassy would retain rights to \"The Fog\", while Yablans's Compass International Pictures would be guaranteed production rights for \"Halloween II\".\n\nThe sequel was intended to conclude the story of Michael Myers and Laurie Strode. The third film, \"\", released a year later, contained a plot that deviated wholly from that of the first two films. Wallace, who went on to direct \"Halloween III\", stated, \"It is our intention to create an anthology out of the series, sort of along the lines of \"Night Gallery\", or \"The Twilight Zone\", only on a much larger scale, of course.\" When asked, in a 1982 interview, what happened to Myers and Loomis, Carpenter flatly answered, \"The Shape is dead. Pleasence's character is dead, too, unfortunately.\" This would later be retconned and both Michael and Loomis would return for multiple later installments.\n\nThe screenplay of \"Halloween II\" was written by Carpenter and Hill. Carpenter described that his writing of the screenplay \"mainly dealt with a lot of beer, sitting in front of a typewriter saying 'What the fuck am I doing? I don't know.'\" In a 1981 interview with \"Fangoria\" magazine, Hill mentions the finished film differs somewhat from initial drafts of the screenplay. Upon receiving the script, Yablans was disappointed as he felt it was \"pedestrian and predictable.\" The plot twist of Laurie being Michael's sister was initially never planned by Carpenter or Hill, but was conceived, according to Carpenter, \"purely as a function of having decided to become involved in the sequel to the movie where I didn't think there was really much of a story left.\" He would later refer to this plotline as \"silly\" and \"foolish,\" though it would go on to shape the narrative arc of the series in the subsequent films.\n\nFilm critic Roger Ebert, who praised the first film, notes that the plot of the sequel was rather simple: \"The plot of \"Halloween II\" absolutely depends, of course, on our old friend the Idiot Plot, which requires that everyone in the movie behave at all times like an idiot. That's necessary because if anyone were to use common sense, the problem would be solved and the movie would be over.\" Hill rebuffed such critiques by arguing that \"in a thriller film, what a character says is often irrelevant, especially in those sequences where the objective is to build up suspense.\"\n\nHistorian Nicholas Rogers suggests that a portion of the film seems to have drawn inspiration from the \"contemporary controversies surrounding the holiday itself.\" He points specifically to the scene in the film when a young boy in a pirate costume arrives at Haddonfield Memorial Hospital with a razor blade lodged in his mouth, a reference to the urban legend of tainted Halloween candy. According to Rogers, \"The \"Halloween\" films opened in the wake of the billowing stories about Halloween sadism and clearly traded on the uncertainties surrounding trick-or-treating and the general safety of the festival.\"\n\nThe main cast of \"Halloween\" reprised their roles in the sequel with the exception of Nick Castle, who had played the adult Michael Myers in the original. Veteran English actor Donald Pleasence continued the role of Dr. Sam Loomis, who had been Myers' psychiatrist for the past 15 years while Myers was institutionalized at Smith's Grove Sanitarium. Curtis (then 22), again played the teenage babysitter Laurie Strode, revealed in this film as the younger sister of Myers. Curtis required a wig for the role of long-haired Laurie Strode, as she had her own hair cut shorter at the time. Charles Cyphers reprised the role of Sheriff Leigh Brackett, though his character disappears from the film when the corpse of his daughter Annie (Nancy Loomis) is discovered. Nancy Loomis appears as Annie in a cameo role as her father, Sheriff Brackett, closes her eyes as her corpse is being taken out of the house in a stretcher. Actor Hunter von Leer heads the manhunt for Myers in the role of Deputy Gary Hunt. He admitted in an interview that he had never watched \"Halloween\" before being cast in the part. He stated, \"I did not see the original first but being from a small town, I wanted the Deputy to have compassion.\" Nancy Stephens, who played Loomis's nurse colleague Marion Chambers in the original, also reprised the character and was given a more important role, revealing to Loomis the family connection between Laurie and Michael.\n\nStunt performer Dick Warlock played Michael Myers (as in \"Halloween\", listed as \"The Shape\" in the credits), replacing Castle who was beginning a career as a director. Warlock's previous experience in film was as a stunt double in films, such as \"The Green Berets\" (1968) and \"Jaws\" (1975), and the 1974 television series \"\". In an interview, Warlock explained how he prepared for the role since Myers received far more screen time in the sequel than the original. Warlock said:\n\nWarlock also claims that the mask he wore was the same one Nick Castle used in the first film. Hill confirmed this in an interview.\n\nThe supporting cast consisted of relatively unknown actors and actresses, except for Jeffrey Kramer and Ford Rainey. Most of the cast previously or later appeared in films or television series by Universal Studios (the distributor for this film). Kramer was previously cast in a supporting role as Deputy Jeff Hendricks in \"Jaws\" and \"Jaws 2\" (1978). In \"Halloween II\", Kramer played Dr. Graham, a dentist who examines the charred remains of Ben Tramer. Rainey was chosen to play Haddonfield Memorial Hospital's drunk resident doctor, Frederick Mixter. A host of character actors were cast as the hospital's staff. Many were acquaintances of director Rosenthal. He told an interviewer, \"I'd been studying acting with Milton Katselas at the Beverly Hills Playhouse and I brought many people from the Playhouse into \"Halloween 2\".\" These included Pamela Susan Shoop, Leo Rossi, Ana Alicia and Gloria Gifford. Rossi played the part of Budd Scarlotti, a hypersexual EMS driver; Rossi as well as several others, such as Stephens, had been members of an acting class with Rosenthal.\n\nShoop played Nurse Karen Bailey, who is scalded to death by Myers in the hospital therapy tub. Featured in the only nude scene in the film, Shoop discussed filming the scene, and recalled getting an ear infection: \"[The water] was cold and dirty. They were playing it off like the water was boiling, but it was absolutely freezing! Leo [Rossi] and I were so cold, our teeth were chattering.!\" Gifford and Alicia played minor supporting roles as head nurse Mrs. Virginia Alves and orderly Janet Marshall. Actor Lance Guest played an EMS driver, Jimmy. \"The Last Starfighter\" director Nick Castle stated in an interview, \"When I was assigned to the film, Lance Guest was the first name I wrote down on my list for Alex after seeing him in \"Halloween II\".\" Castle adds, \"He possessed all the qualities I wanted the character to express on the screen, a kind of innocence, shyness, yet determination.\" Future \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"Wayne's World\" star Dana Carvey also appears briefly in a non-speaking role, wearing a blue baseball cap and receiving instructions from the TV reporter. Carvey originally had a bit of a bigger role, including some speaking scenes, before his scenes ultimately got mostly cut.\n\n\"Halloween\" executive producers Irwin Yablans and Moustapha Akkad invested heavily in the sequel, boasting a much larger budget than its predecessor: $2.5 million (compared to only $320,000 for the original). Italian film producer Dino De Laurentiis assisted in financing the production. There was discussion of filming \"Halloween II\" in 3-D; Hill said, \"We investigated a number of 3-D processes ... but they were far too expensive for this particular project. Also, most of the projects we do involve a lot of night shooting—evil lurks at night. It's hard to do that in 3-D.\" Dean Cundey, the director of photography on the first film, reprised his role as cinematographer, opting out of shooting Tobe Hooper's \"Poltergeist\" (1982) as he felt a loyalty to Carpenter and Hill.\n\nMost of the film was shot at Morningside Hospital in Los Angeles, California, and Pasadena Community Hospital in Pasadena. Rosenthal recalled filming at Pasadena Community Hospital as being extraordinarily difficult due to its proximity to an airport, which disrupted shooting frequently due to incoming airplanes.\n\nReluctant to extend his involvement in the film, Carpenter refused to direct and originally approached Tommy Lee Wallace, the art director from the original \"Halloween\", to take the helm. Carpenter told one interviewer: \"I had made that film once and I really didn't want to do it again.\" After Wallace declined, Carpenter chose Rosenthal, a relatively unknown and inexperienced director whose previous credits included episodes of the television series \"Secrets of Midland Heights\" (1980–1981). Rosenthal was chosen to direct based on a short film he had made, \"The Toyer\", while a student at the American Film Institute. Debra Hill had also considered directing at one point, but did not want to appear as \"just a protégé\" of Carpenter.\nStylistically, Rosenthal attempted to recreate the elements and themes of the original film, stating: \"conceptually, it's not at all my film. It's a continuation of a John Carpenter and Debra Hill ...  film. But in execution, it's my vision.\" \"Halloween II\" opens with a title sequence zooming in on a jack-o'-lantern that splits in half to reveal a human skull, a reference to the original film's title sequence, which featured a similar zoom into the eye of a jack-o'-lantern. The first scene of the film is presented through a first-person camera format in which a voyeuristic Michael Myers enters an elderly couple's home and steals a knife from the kitchen. Rosenthal attempts to reproduce the \"jump\" scenes present in \"Halloween\", but does not film Myers on the periphery, which is where he appeared in many of the scenes of the original. Under Rosenthal's direction, Myers is the central feature of a majority of the scenes. Rosenthal also stated that he attempted to replicate the visual elements of the previous film \"until we [the audience] get to the hospital ...  Once we're in there, I got a certain freedom: long corridors, moody dark lighting, all of that.\" In an interview with Luke Ford, Rosenthal explains:\n\nThe decision to include more gore and nudity in the sequel was not made by Rosenthal, who contends that it was Carpenter who chose to make the film much bloodier than the original. Wallace explains: \"Since the release of \"Halloween\", horror movies had changed. There was inflation involved in terms of violence and gore and what you saw onscreen, to the point that John [Carpenter] felt like he was in a boxhe could not do the same thing that \"Halloween\" had been doing.\" According to the film's official website, \"Carpenter came in and directed a few sequences to clean up some of Rosenthal's work.\" One reviewer of the film notes that \"Carpenter, concerned that the picture would be deemed too 'tame' by the slasher audience, re-filmed several death scenes with more gore.\" When asked about his role in the directing process, Carpenter told an interviewer:\n\nRosenthal was not pleased with Carpenter's changes. He reportedly complained that Carpenter \"ruined [my] carefully paced film.\" Regardless, many of the graphic scenes contained elements not seen before in film. Roger Ebert claims, \"This movie has the first close-up I can remember of a hypodermic needle being inserted into an eyeball.\" The film is often categorized as a splatter film rather than a slasher film due to the elevated level of gore.\n\nCarpenter composed and performed the score with Alan Howarth, who had previously been involved in \"\" (1979), and worked with Carpenter on several projects including \"Escape from New York\" (1981), \"\" (1982), \"Christine\" (1983), and \"Prince of Darkness\" (1987). The film's score was a variation of Carpenter compositions from \"Halloween\", particularly the main theme's familiar piano melody played in a compound 5/4 time rhythm. The score was performed on a synthesizer organ rather than a piano. One reviewer for the BBC described the revised score as having \"a more gothic feel.\" The reviewer asserted that it \"doesn't sound quite as good as the original piece\", but \"it still remains a classic piece of music.\"\n\nThe film featured the song \"Mr. Sandman\" performed by The Chordettes, which would later be featured in the opening scenes of \"\". Reviewers commented on the decision to include this song in the film, calling the selection \"interesting\" and \"not a song you would associate with a film like this.\" The song worked well to \"mimic Laurie's situation (sleeping a lot), [making] the once innocent sounding lyrics seem threatening in a horror film.\" Another critic saw the inclusion of the song as \"inappropriate\" and asked, \"What was \"that\" about?\"\n\nThe film was principally edited by Mark Goldblatt. Skip Schoolnik, an editor who had simultaneously been commissioned to edit the television cut for the original \"Halloween\", was invited by Carpenter and Hill to view the cut of \"Halloween II\" at the time. Schoolnik and Carpenter spent a weekend editing Goldblatt's cut of the film, ultimately excising around 14 minutes. During this editing process, Carpenter realized that an unresolved plot hole was present: It was unclear as to how Michael Myers was able to track Laurie to the hospital. To resolve this, Carpenter shot a sequence featuring a young boy walking on the street with a portable radio playing a news broadcast concerning the murders and Laurie's whereabouts; as the boy walks along, he accidentally bumps into Michael, and resumes walking. According to Warlock, Carpenter also shot the close-up footage of Michaels' burning body shown at the film's conclusion, as well as the murder sequence of Anne Bruner, a teenage girl who is killed by Michael early in the film.\n\nTo advertise \"Halloween II\", Universal printed a poster that featured a skull superimposed onto a pumpkin. This imagery is described by film historian and sociologist Robert E. Kapsis as \"an unmistakable horror motif.\" Kapsis points out that by 1981 horror had \"become a \"genre non grata\"\" with critics. The effect of this can be seen in the distributor's promotion of the film as horror while at the same time stressing that the sequel, like its predecessor, \"was more a quality suspense film than a 'slice and dice' horror film.\" Use of the tagline \"More Of The Night HE Came Home\"—a modified version of the original \"Halloween\" tagline—hoped to accomplish the same task.\n\nThe theatrical distribution rights to \"Halloween II\" were sold to Universal Pictures. Universal released the film on October 30, 1981 in the United States. The film grossed $7,446,508 on its opening weekend. While the gross earnings of the sequel paled in comparison to the original's $47 million, it was a success in its own right, exceeding the earnings of other films of the same genre released in 1981: \"Friday the 13th Part 2\" ($21.7 million), \"\" ($20.4 million) and \"The Howling\" ($18 million). \"Halloween II\" was a box office success, becoming the second-highest grossing horror film of 1981 behind \"An American Werewolf in London\". Internationally, \"Halloween II\" was released throughout Europe, but it was banned in West Germany and Iceland due to the graphic violence and nudity; a later 1986 release on home video was banned in Norway. The film was shown in Canada, Australia, the Philippines and Japan.\n\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 30% based on , with a weighted average rating of 4.66/10. The sites critical consensus states that \"\"Halloween II\" picks up where its predecessor left off - and quickly wanders into a dead end that the franchise would spend decades struggling to find its way out of.\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 40 out of 100, based on 11 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nSeveral critics were unwelcoming to the film's ramped-up violence, including Kevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\", who lambasted the film for its \"reprehensible content,\" summarizing that \"\"Halloween II\", as a reprise, simply piles up a greater number of corpses.\" Roman Cooney of the \"Calgary Herald\" noted that while the film is \"not the bloodbath other movies of its ilk have been, several of the murder scenes are so painfully gruesome as to be tasteless and more than merely distressing,\" and added that the plot is \"convenient rather than complex, relying on a cast of characterless individuals like so many dominoes waiting to be toppled.\" Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" echoed similar sentiments, writing that \"Halloween II\" represented \"a fall from greatness\" that \"doesn't even attempt to do justice to the original.\" He also commented, \"Instead, it tries to outdo all the other violent \"Halloween\" rip-offs of the last several years.\" \"The Arizona Republic\"s Michael Maza assessed the film as continuing part of the prominent slasher trend, noting that Carpenter and Hill appear to be \"picking up a few tricks from their imitators (most notably \"Friday the 13th\").\"\n\nJanet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" instead compared the film to other horror sequels and recently released slasher films of the period rather than to its predecessor: \"By the standards of most recent horror films, this—like its predecessor—is a class act.\" She notes that there \"is some variety to the crimes, as there is to the characters, and an audience is more likely to do more screaming at suspenseful moments than at scary ones.\" Maslin applauded the performance of the cast and Rosenthal and concluded, \"That may not be much to ask of a horror film, but it's more than many of them offer.\"\n\nDavid Pirie's review in \"Time Out\" magazine gave Rosenthal's film positive marks, stating, \"Rosenthal is no Carpenter, but he makes a fair job of emulating the latter's visual style in this sequel.\" He wrote that the Myers character had evolved since the first film to become \"an agent of Absolute Evil.\" Film historian Jim Harper suggests, \"Time has been a little fairer to the film\" than original critics. In retrospect, \"many critics have come to recognise that it's considerably better than the slew of imitation slashers that swamped the genre in the eighties.\"\n\nLike the original \"Halloween\", this and other slasher films have come under fire from feminist critics. According to historian Nicholas Rogers, academic critics \"have seen the slasher movies since \"Halloween\" as debasing women in as decisive a manner as hardcore pornography.\" Critics such as John Kenneth Muir point out that female characters such as Laurie Strode survive not because of \"any good planning\" or their own resourcefulness, but sheer luck. Although she manages to repel the killer several times, in the end, Strode is rescued in \"Halloween\" only when Dr. Loomis arrives to shoot Myers.\n\nIn 1982, the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films, USA, nominated the film for two Saturn Awards: Best Horror Film and Best Actor for Pleasence. The film lost to \"An American Werewolf in London\" (1981) and Harrison Ford was chosen over Pleasence for his role in \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" (1981).\n\nAn alternate version of \"Halloween II\" (sometimes referred to as 'The Television Cut') has aired on network television since the early 1980s, with most of the graphic violence and blood edited out and many minor additional scenes added, while others are removed. This cut of the film was released in 2012 by Scream Factory on their Collector's Edition Blu-ray disc, and again in 2014 as a standalone DVD accompanying the \"Complete Collection\" Deluxe Edition Blu-ray set, which features entire series.\n\nThe television cut runs approximately 92 minutes, roughly one minute less than the theatrical version. There are many edits such as the murders of Alice, Dr. Mixter, Janet, and Mrs. Alves—all presumed to still happen, but some are off camera. Jimmy's discovery of Mrs. Alves dead and his subsequent slipping in the pool of blood has been significantly shortened (or removed altogether in some prints) and moved just prior to the explosion which kills Myers and Loomis. Also added are scenes of Michael cutting the power (this explains the dark setting throughout the latter half of the film) and a power generator kicking in. There is also extra dialogue between Laurie and Jimmy, Laurie and Mrs. Alves, Janet and Karen, Karen and Mr. Garrett, Bud and Karen, Jill and Jimmy, etc. Another notable difference is the killing of the Marshall. In the theatrical version his throat is slit, while in the TV version it is softened, with Michael grabbing him and stabbing him from behind (with no detail shown). While the theatrical version ends with the deaths of Michael Myers and Dr. Loomis and leaves the audience in a gray area as to whether Jimmy survives, the television cut features an extended ending showing Jimmy alive (with a bandaged head wound from his slip) in the ambulance with Laurie Strode. They hold hands and Laurie says, \"We made it.\"\n\n\"Halloween II\" was first released on VHS, Capacitance Electronic Disc, and LaserDisc in 1982 by MCA/Universal Home Video and later by Goodtimes Home Video. In 1998, Goodtimes released the film on DVD in a non-anamorphic version. Three years later, on September 18, 2001, Universal Home Video released an anamorphic widescreen DVD.\n\nThe film received its first North American Blu-ray released on September 13, 2011 through Universal, packaged as a 30th Anniversary Edition. This release sparked controversy immediately due to the fact that Universal removed the credit \"Moustapha Akkad Presents\" and replaced it with \"Universal, An MCA Company, Presents\"... in a font that did not match the rest of the opening credits. Akkad's son, Malek, called the stunt \"disgusting. It's a disgrace ...  objectively, any horror fan would find this as an insult to the man who has done so much to the series. And to come after his tragic death, he's not even around to defend himself. It's classless. I'm talking to Universal now and they're 'looking into it.'\" However, Akkad was still credited on the packaging. Fans immediately called for a boycott of the disc and set up a Facebook page. On November 28, Universal began sending out emails announcing that the revised Blu-ray was now available and for owners of the previous disc to provide the studio with their \"address and daytime phone number\" to receive replacements.\n\nScream Factory, a subsidiary of Shout! Factory, re-released the film in a 2-disc Collector's Edition Blu-ray on September 18, 2012 with new special features, including two audio commentaries, two \"behind-the-scenes\" featurettes, deleted scenes, an alternate ending, the theatrical trailer, TV and radio spots, and a still gallery. The Collector's Edition also contains the television cut, along with a downloadable script of the film. This Blu-ray release restores the Akkad credit. The Scream Factory Blu-ray was repackaged and re-released in 2014 as part of the company's \"Complete Collection,\" which features the entire film series.\n\nTrick or Treat Studios has released a series of officially licensed \"Halloween II\" masks, costumes, and props from Universal Studios, beginning in October 2012. Some of these include the \"Halloween II\" Michael Myers mask, \"Halloween II\" Michael Myers mask with blood tears, Michael Myers props, and Michael Myers' coveralls.\n\nAn adaptation of the screenplay was printed as a mass market paperback in 1981 by horror and science-fiction writer Dennis Etchison under the pseudonym Jack Martin. Etchison's novelization was distributed by Kensington Books and became a bestseller. It also features captioned black and white stills from the film at the beginning of each chapter.\n\nAn incident with minor connections to the film heightened attitudes about the potent effects of media violence on young people. On December 7, 1982, Richard Delmer Boyer of El Monte, California, murdered Francis and Eileen Harbitz, an elderly couple in Fullerton, California, leading to the trial \"People v. Boyer\" (1989). The couple were stabbed 43 times by Boyer. According to the trial transcript, Boyer's defense was that he suffered from hallucinations in the Harbitz residence brought on by \"the movie \"Halloween II\", which defendant had seen under the influence of PCP, marijuana, and alcohol.\" The film was played for the jury, and a psychopharmacologist \"pointed out various similarities between its scenes and the visions defendant described.\"\nBoyer was found guilty and sentenced to death. The incident became known as the \"\"Halloween II\" Murders\" and was featured in a short segment on TNT's \"Monstervision\", hosted by film critic Joe Bob Briggs. Following the trial, moral critics came to the defense of horror films and rejected calls to ban them. Thomas M. Sipos, for instance, stated,\n\nIt would be silly, after all, to ban horror films just because Boyer claims to have thought that he was reenacting \"Halloween II\", or to ban cars because Texas housewife Clara Harris intentionally ran down and killed her husband. Nor does it make sense to ban otherwise useful items such as drugs or guns just because some individuals misuse them.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2002106", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2002106", "title": "KXOL-FM", "text": "KXOL-FM\n\nKXOL-FM (96.3 MHz \"Mega 96.3\") is a commercial FM radio station in Los Angeles. It is owned by the Spanish Broadcasting System and airs a Spanish CHR radio format. KXOL-FM's studios and offices are on West Pico Boulevard. The transmitter is located in the Verdugo Mountains, near Burbank, California. KXOL-FM is also heard on a 14-watt booster station in Santa Clarita, KXOL-FM-1 at 96.3 MHz.\n\nThe station first signed on as KRKD-FM, owned by Radio Broadcasters, Incorporated. It was the FM sister station to AM 1150 KRKD (now KEIB). Continental Telecasting Corporation bought the station in 1955, followed by Trans American Broadcasting Corporation in 1959. Two years later, Trans American sold the station to the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel as part of the consolidation of KRKD and its time share partner, KFSG, which both took turns broadcasting on 1150 kHz. Both the AM and FM stations aired a Christian radio format.\n\nIn the late 1960s, KRKD AM and FM were partially simulcast, but KRKD-FM broke occasionally for theatrical performances and opera. In 1970, Foursquare sold off the AM station and moved the KFSG call sign (meaning \"FourSquare Gospel\") to the FM station on June 8 of that year. KFSG aired Southern Gospel music along with religious programming produced by the church along with syndicated staples like \"Focus on the Family,\" \"Joni and Friends,\" \"Insight for Living\" and \"In Touch Ministries.\" The station's schedule was about 50% music and 50% teaching programs.\n\nFor years, the station played traditional Christian music with Christian contemporary music heard for only a few hours a week on Saturday. But by 1981, KFSG began to mix in softer contemporary Christian songs into the format. By 1987 KFSG was a Christian adult contemporary station playing such artists as Twila Paris, Steven Curtis Chapman, Amy Grant, David Meece, Randy Stonehill, PFR and White Heart.\n\nAfter fifty years of owning KFSG, the Foursquare Church sold the station in 2003 to the Spanish Broadcasting System. It was a $250 million sale. On April 30, 2001, KFSG moved its programming and call sign to FM 93.5 in Redondo Beach (now KDAY), but dropped the music and went with all-religious talk programming full-time. SBS owned the station at 93.5 and leased it to Foursquare as part of its purchase of the more powerful 96.3 frequency. (93.5 operated at 6,000 watts while 96.3 ran 54,000 watts.) In 2003, the 93.5 lease ended and SBS regained control of the station, ending Foursquare's run in Southern California radio.\n\nOn May 9, 2001, SBS flipped 96.3 a Spanish AC format, changing the call letters to KXOL. The station became \"El Sol 96.3\" (\"The Sun 96.3\") with Sylvia Villagran as the first woman to host a morning radio show in Los Angeles. According to Arbitron between 2001 and 2004, the show garnered high ratings, consistently placing it among the top three morning shows in Los Angeles. '\"El Sol\" was one of two Spanish AC radio stations in Los Angeles until May 2005, when its format change left KLVE as the only station in L.A. airing a softer adult Latin format.\n\nIn 2005, SBS decided to drop KXOL's Spanish adult contemporary format for hurban (Spanish urban contemporary). The abrupt switch violated a transmitter lease agreement that SBS, had with Emmis Communications, the owner of KXOL's transmitter site. The agreement required formal notification to Emmis of any change in KXOL's format and expressly prohibited the station from programming to directly compete with Emmis' English-language Rhythmic outlet KPWR. SBS switched formats anyway, and Emmis filed a lawsuit to force SBS to either drop the format or find a new transmitter. SBS announced that KXOL would move to another transmitter site a month later, and both parties settled the dispute.\n\nKXOL had success as a Latin Urban outlet, partly due to KXOL snatching some of (the now-defunct) KKBT and KPWR's Hispanic listeners. Around 2010, it had begun to tilt its direction towards Latin Hip-Hop as \"Latino 96.3,\" but still remain within the urban arena. By May 2012, KXOL dropped the \"Latino 96.3\" moniker and replaced it with the newer but shortened \"LA 96.3.\" KXOL began using the slogan \"L.A.'s Party Station.\" The playlist has also shifted further towards a conventional Rhythmic direction except for a handful of urban tracks. By late 2012, the station rebranded back to \"Latino 96.3\" with a blend of Spanish and English rhythmic hits.\n\nOn May 16, 2014, at 2 p.m., KXOL changed formats to Spanish AC as \"Mega 96.3\" to compete with KLVE \"K-Love 107.5\". By November 2014, KXOL switched to a Spanish CHR format, still calling itself \"Mega 96.3\" while returning to the slogan \"LA's Party Station.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "2002109", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2002109", "title": "Joe Cribbs", "text": "Joe Cribbs\n\nJoe Stanier Cribbs (born January 5, 1958) is a retired National Football League and United States Football League football running back. He played collegiately at Auburn University along with future NFL backs William Andrews and James Brooks. He began his professional career in 1980 with the Buffalo Bills.\n\nAfter being drafted in the second round of the 1980 NFL Draft, Cribbs went on to start all 16 games of his rookie year with Buffalo, finishing with 1185 rushing yards and 11 touchdowns. His performance earned him consensus UPI AFC Rookie of the Year honors and a spot in the Pro Bowl, the only rookie chosen as a starter that year. In five seasons with the team, split around a detour with the USFL, Cribbs had 13 100-yard games and ran for 1,000 yards in a season three times.\n\nIn the spring of 1984, Cribbs left the Bills in a contract dispute and signed on as a member of the Birmingham Stallions of the United States Football League (USFL).\n\nCribbs was to serve as the president of Team Alabama of the AAFL, which suspended operations shortly before it was slated to play its first games. Almost immediately, Cribbs was named commissioner of the United National Gridiron League, which likewise failed ever to play a game.\n\nJoe Cribbs played college football at Auburn. He played his first college football game in 1976, and when the season was over, he had 171 yards on 43 rushing attempts. He got more playing time in 1977, with 872 yards on 161 rushing attempts. He scored four touchdowns as a rusher. He also caught six passes for 51 yards. \n\n1978 was the breakout year. Cribbs rushed for 1,205 yards in 253 attempts, scoring 16 touchdowns, and averaging well over hundred yards a game. He was a threat out of the backfield as well, catching right passes. He was also used on gadget plays as well. Cribbs passed the ball four times, completing three passes for 74 yards.\n\nIn 1979, Cribbs final season at Auburn, Cribbs had 200 rushing attempts for 1,120 yards, and scored 14 touchdowns rushing\n\nCribbs was an immediate success playing for the NFL team which drafted him, the Buffalo Bills, and was named the American Football Conference Rookie of the Year for the 1980 season and as a starter in the Pro Bowl. He also played very well in each of the two subsequent seasons and was named to the Pro Bowl again following each. When the NFL played an abbreviated 9 game schedule due to the strike-shortened season in 1982, Cribbs was only able to play in 7 games but nonetheless led the league with 90.4 rushing yards per game. Cribbs was not exactly happy in Buffalo, however, as he especially disliked playing in their infamous cold-weather home games. With one year left on his contract with the Bills, Cribbs signed a contract with the Birmingham Stallions of the USFL. In the summer of 1983, Cribbs officially inked a contract with Birmingham worth $3.5 million. \n\nHowever, the Bills challenged the contract, citing that they had first right of refusal. This clause had been in Cribbs' original contract with the Buffalo Bills. This was placed in the contract in order to protect Buffalo in case there was no collective bargaining agreement and to prevent another NFL team from signing Cribbs in that event. However, obviously there was no mention of a prohibition of any team from the USFL signing Cribbs, as that league was yet to be formed when Cribbs signed his contract with the Bills.\n\nThe trial was held in Buffalo, and one of the people testifying for the Bills was head coach Kay Stephenson, who stated that Joe Cribbs was irreplaceable in the Bills lineup. Federal Judge John T. Elfvin heard the case. While the trial was going on, Cribbs continued to work out with the Stallions. When the verdict came down, Judge Elfvin ruled in favor of Cribbs, allowing him to play for the Birmingham Stallions.\n\nHerschel Walker made the jump from college football to the USFL, becoming the league's highest paid player at $6 million over four years. This played a factor in Joe Cribbs walking out of his contract with the Birmingham Stallions. Cribbs had signed a deal in 1983 worth $2.6 million dollars to play for Birmingham, and still five years left on the contract. At the time of his walkout, Cribbs was leading the USFL in rushing.\n\nCribbs was a fairly major star with the Stallions; however, the USFL folded after its 1985 season and Cribbs then returned to play in the NFL. Cribbs played for the San Francisco 49ers in the 1986 and 1987 seasons. He then divided the 1988 season between the Indianapolis Colts and the Miami Dolphins prior to his retirement. During this return stint in the NFL, Cribbs never came truly close to the level of consistency which had put him into three consecutive Pro Bowls early in the decade.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2002110", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2002110", "title": "Darkstars", "text": "Darkstars\n\nThe first Darkstars were a group of fictional intergalactic policemen that appeared in comic books published by DC Comics. They were introduced in \"Darkstars\" #1 (October 1992), and were created by Michael Jan Friedman and Mike Collins. The series lasted a total of 39 issues, ending with issue #38 (Jan. 1996), with an issue #0 (Oct. 1994) published between issues #24 and 25 during the \"Zero Hour\" crossover event storyline.\n\nThe Darkstars were created and run by the Controllers, an offshoot of the Guardians of the Universe. Though their goal was to establish order in the universe, the ancient Maltusian race known as the Controllers were isolationists by nature.\n\nThe Controllers created NEMO, the Network for the Establishment and Maintenance of Order, for the purpose of isolating the troubles of the galaxy away from the Controllers' domain. Over the millennia, the Controllers realized they would have to take a more active stance by attacking chaos at its roots. Despite all the good they did, there were too many NEMO operatives in too many different places. NEMO and the Controllers devised a new plan to ensure order, which resulted in the creation of the Darkstars. The first of these new protectors was named Druu, one of a thousand to carry the name Darkstar.\n\nThe first Darkstar to arrive on Earth was named Ferrin Colos. He arrived on Earth while tracking the supervillain Evil Star. He was authorised to appoint two humans as his deputies, giving them less powerful versions of the Darkstar uniform.\n\nThe Controllers expanded the Darkstar project after the collapse of the Green Lantern Corps Central Power Battery on Oa. The Darkstars would fill the void left by the failure of the Guardians' legions. After the Corps' collapse, many former Green Lanterns served in the Darkstar organization. Former Lantern John Stewart was appointed field leader. Donna Troy also joined their ranks.\n\nAs time went on, the Controllers expressed concerns about the effectiveness of the Darkstars. More specifically, they were troubled that Darkstar agents were mostly looking after their own agendas rather than those of the Controllers.\n\nThey withdrew their support from the Darkstars. This made many of the early Darkstar uniforms useless, as they relied on energy transmitted from the Controllers. The later, self-contained suits were unaffected. Many Darkstars were killed or lost their battlesuits in combat against Grayven, son of Darkseid, on the planet Rann. Grayven also crippled John Stewart, paralyzing him from the waist down. Green Lantern Kyle Rayner ended the battle, but the Darkstars were shattered by the losses. In the end, only four Darkstars remained to help rebuild Ranagar.\n\nLater, the last of the Darkstars (Ferrin Colos, Chaser Bron & Munchuk) gave their lives saving the universe from the energy vampire called Starbreaker. They siphoned off a considerable amount of power from him, which helped save the day, but their suits ruptured and all of them were disintegrated.\n\nIn the 2006 \"Omega Men\" and \"Mystery in Space\" miniseries, an organization called the Darkstars is active in the Vega system, serving as clergy and missionaries for Lady Styx. It is implied that Styx merely appropriated the old Darkstars' uniforms and equipment and gave them to her minions.\n\nAmong the equipment stolen by prosecutor Kate Spencer when she becomes the eighth Manhunter is an exo-mantle which formerly belonged to an unnamed Darkstar. As seen in \"Manhunter\" #32 (September 2008), the exo-mantle reacts adversely to a Reach scarab bonded to Blue Beetle Jaime Reyes. It appears as if the Controllers programmed an instinctive hatred of the Reach into all exo-mantles, just like the Guardians of the Universe did with the Power Rings worn by the Green Lantern Corps.\n\nThe Controllers reveal themselves to be on the brink of extinction, and started kidnapping the Guardians of the Universe in order to use their DNA to create new conditions. By trapping them in a machine, the Controllers mined the Guardians' ancient Maltusian genes and twisted them into their own image, transforming them into Controllers. They are able to add three Guardians of the Universe to their number before being defeated by the Green Lantern Corps. It is also revealed that they possess a new set of Darkstars' exo-mantles which they plan to launch into the universe in order to match the power of the Guardians of the Universe.\n\nIts later revealed that when Batman, Wonder Woman, Hal Jordan, Aquaman and Superman used the tenth metal, which as the ability to create or destroy matter based on its wielders' desires, to defeat Barbatos and rebuilt all the destruction made by him and his Dark Nights, they inadvertently added sublimated desires into the Universe, being the new set of Darkstars' exo-mantles one of the new things forged from their own dark desires.\n\nAccording to the Controllers, the new set of Darkstars' mantles took decades to perfect, are far more lethal than the previous generation and possess tactical capabilities that surpass those of the Green Lanterns; however, to the Controllers' dismay, they soon discover that the Darkstars' mantles are beyond their control when one activated itself and began searching for a suitable volunteer all the while ignoring the Controllers' orders. Tomar-Tu later reveals to Hal Jordan that the mantles gained consciousness of their own and, after bonding with a suitable volunteer, it trapped all the Controllers in order to use their psionic powers to link all Darkstars' thoughts and use the cosmic energy inside their bodies to fuel their foundry. During the last stand against the Darkstars, Hal Jordan with help from Hammond is able to break the connection between the Controllers and the Darkstars and after using his own willpower, Hal is able to make all Darkstars' mantles malfunction, ending their apparent threat.\n\n\n"}

Its titles were mainly action/adventure, western, and horror. Its most notable character was Johnny Dynamite, created by Pete Morisi. The main artist across its titles was Don Heck, who in 1955 would be recruited by Stan Lee to Atlas Comics; what would become Marvel Comics. Don went on to be one of the architects of what became known as \"The Marvel Age of Comics,\" along with the legendary Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, and Dick Ayers. While there Don co-created Iron Man, Hawkeye, and Black Widow.\n\nWhen Comic Media became defunct, the company sold its titles and characters to Charlton Comics. Charlton then continued \"Dynamite\" as \"Johnny Dynamite\", with work by Morisi, who continued to work for the company for many years. Johnny Dynamite would later be purchased by Max Allan Collins and Terry Beatty and reprinted in their Ms. Tree title and a miniseries they created.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2002133", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2002133", "title": "Psyence Fiction", "text": "Psyence Fiction\n\nPsyence Fiction is the debut studio album by British-American electronic music group Unkle, released on 24 August 1998 by Mo' Wax. The creation of the album was helmed by the duo of James Lavelle and DJ Shadow, with the former overseeing the album's themes and the latter handling musical composition. \"Psyence Fiction\" also features contributions from a varied cast of guest musicians recruited by Lavelle.\n\n\"Psyence Fiction\" reached number 4 on the UK Albums Chart and number 107 on the US \"Billboard\" 200.\n\n\"Unreal\" is an instrumental version of the song \"Be There\" (featuring Ian Brown), which was released a year later as a single. On some early pressings of the album, instrumental versions of \"Guns Blazing\" and \"The Knock\" were added as tracks 13 and 14. On some re-releases of the album, \"Be There\" was added as track 13. Some versions (mainly the Japanese release, but also the US promotional copy) contain the hidden track \"Intro (optional)\" as \"track zero\", which is actually the pre-gap (index 0) of track 1. This can be accessed by \"rewinding\" the first track on some CD players.\n\n\"Psyence Fiction\" was widely anticipated due to its high-profile cast of collaborators, with Shadow's involvement in particular leading to expectations that the album \"would be a sort of \"Endtroducing...\" Part II\". It was ultimately released to mixed reviews, with many critics finding that the album failed to live up to pre-release hype. John Mulvey of \"NME\" wrote that Shadow's music \"rarely gels with Lavelle's chosen singers or even comes to terms with the song (as opposed to groove) format of much of the material\". \"Guardian\" writer Caroline Sullivan said that the album successfully sustains its \"foreboding\" mood, but added that \"its strength is also its weakness: somewhere amid the sprawl of bad dreams it turns into nothing more than meandering tunes with spooky keyboards attached\". \"The A.V. Club\"s Joshua Klein criticised Unkle's decision to eschew hip hop in favour of a \"more conventional alt-rock outline\", concluding that \"\"Psyence Fiction\" can be chalked up as an ambitious failure; its principals can put it on their résumés, but cultural historians needn't put in their books.\" Critic Robert Christgau gave the album a one-star honorable mention, deeming it \"Not beautiful (or weird) enough for its own beats\".\n\nAmong positive reviews, Barry Walters of \"Spin\" wrote that DJ Shadow \"frames suitably eloquent voices with chaotic but never overwhelming aural bricolage\", calling \"Psyence Fiction\" \"the illest soundclash since the last time a B-boy crashed a George Romero film festival and refused to turn off his boom-box\". Writing in \"Rolling Stone\", Lorraine Ali found the album to be \"neither a lofty concept album nor the sonic equivalent of cinema\", but concluded that \"it is Shadow and Lavelle's striving for such greatness that makes UNKLE a compelling work in progress\". \"Entertainment Weekly\"s David Browne wrote that despite the presence of filler, \"the best bits... are like a soundtrack for a surreal, melancholy art film that exists in Shadow's and Lavelle's heads.\" Gareth Grundy of \"Select\" wrote that Shadow's production provides the album with coherence, and that when he and Lavelle \"click... it hums with \"joie de vivre\" – the sound of a vision thrillingly realised\".\n\nDisillusioned with the project, DJ Shadow departed Unkle following \"Psyence Fiction\"s release and distanced himself from the album. Years later, James Lavelle opined that the album's hype ended up overshadowing its musical content, adding that he felt it was released at a time \"when people wanted [him] to fail\". Shadow would later soften his stance on \"Psyence Fiction\", remarking in a 2010 interview that he viewed the album fondly despite it being \"somehow flawed\".\n\nIn June 2013, Unkle launched a Kickstarter campaign titled \"URBAN ARCHAEOLOGY: 21 YEARS OF MO'WAX,\" part of which included a deluxe re-release compact disc of Psyence Fiction. The campaign raised over $51,000. As of September 2019, the Psyence Fiction album has not been released to the Kickstarter campaign contributors.\n\nIn the years following the release of \"Psyence Fiction\", the album's reputation has steadily improved. In a review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine found that \"Psyence Fiction\", despite its musical flaws, \"gains momentum on repeated listens\" due to \"Shadow's imagination and unpredictable highlights\", which make for \"a superstar project that doesn't play it safe and actually has its share of rich, rewarding music.\" Writing in \"The Vinyl Factory\", Elliot Wilder expressed similar sentiments and noted that the album had \"gained cult status for its chaotic collages and maverick collaborations\", adding that it \"feels today like the kind of crazy, alt-star-strewn mash fest that it is\". Chris DeVille of \"Stereogum\" wrote that \"Psyence Fiction\" presaged \"likeminded ecumenical collectives like Gorillaz and Handsome Boy Modeling School\", and that \"In terms of quality alone, it's worthy of remembering as one of the best albums of its era.\" In 2015, \"Fact\" named it the 45th best trip hop album of all time.\n\n\nCredits for \"Psyence Fiction\" adapted from album liner notes.\n\nUnkle\n\nAdditional musicians\nProduction\n\nArtwork and design\n\"All other mixing and recording took place in London, England.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "2002158", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2002158", "title": "Jörg Demus", "text": "Jörg Demus\n\nJörg Demus (2 December 1928 – 16 April 2019) was an Austrian classical pianist who appeared internationally and made many recordings. He was also a composer and a lecturer at music academies. In composition and playing, he focused on chamber music and \"lieder\". He played with singers such as Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, as a piano duo with Paul Badura-Skoda, and with string players such as Josef Suk and Antonio Janigro. Demus was instrumental in bringing the historic fortepiano to concert podiums. He was a member of the Legion of Honour, among many awards. He is regarded as one of the leading Austrian pianists of the immediate post-World War II era.\n\nDemus was born in St. Pölten; his father was an art historian and his mother a concert violinist. At the age of six, Demus received his first piano lessons. Five years later, at the age of 11, he entered the Vienna Academy of Music, studying piano, composition and conducting. He made his debut as a pianist when he was still a student: at the age of 15, he played in the Brahms-Saal of the prestigious Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde Bach's \"Das wohltemperierte Klavier\". He graduated in 1945, then 17 years old, after which he continued to study conducting with Josef Krips and Hans Swarowsky. Demus studied in Paris with Yves Nat from 1951 to 1953. In 1953 he further studied interpretation with Wilhelm Kempff, Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli, and Edwin Fischer, and attended master classes with Walter Gieseking.\n\nIn 1951, Demus made his first tour to South America and then appeared internationally in concert halls. He appeared in England and France. In 1972 he toured Southern Africa in all the major cities. In 1974, Demus performed for the Peabody Mason Concert series in Boston.\n\nDemus was active as a lied accompanist and a chamber music partner, appearing with singers such as Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Elly Ameling and Peter Schreier, and with string players such as Josef Suk and Antonio Janigro. He performed widely as a soloist on both modern and historical instruments, returning the fortepiano to concert podiums. Demus collaborated with Paul Badura-Skoda on the concert platform and on a book concerning the interpretation of Beethoven's piano sonatas.\n\nHis playing of Bach's works showed their structure as well as melodic lines. He favoured Schumann's music, revealing a high degree of playful levity besides romantic expressiveness. His playing of Debussy's music stands out in \"Klangsinn\", a sense for a colourful impressionist sound world. He collected historic keyboard instruments and presented them to a museum. He lectured at the music academies of Vienna and Stuttgart. \n\nDemus continued playing until shortly before his death, performing with Badura-Skoda at the 2018 Linz Brucknerfest. He died in Vienna on 16 April 2019, aged 90, after a short illness.\n\nDemus was also a composer, chiefly of music for the piano, chamber music and lied, composing in a generally conservative style. Music for cello and piano takes its inspiration from the poems of Paul Verlaine and the late music by Schumann.\n\nIn 1956 Demus won first prize at the Ferruccio Busoni International Piano Competition. Demus received the Mozart Medal of the Mozartgemeinde Wien in 1979. He was awarded the Österreichisches Ehrenkreuz in 2006, the Beethoven Ring of the Beethoven Society Vienna in 1977, the Robert Schumann Prize of the City of Zwickau and the Order of the Legion of Honour.\n\nAmong the hundreds of recordings by Demus are sets of the complete piano works by both Robert Schumann and Claude Debussy. He also recorded Schubert's \"Impromptus\" on the Deutsche Grammophon label. He made recordings on historical keyboard instruments, including, for example, the earliest such recording of Beethoven's \"Waldstein\" sonata in 1970, on a Broadwood dating from 1802.\n\nHe recorded several of his own compositions with cellist Maria Kliegel, including \"Poetische Sonate\" (\"Poetic Sonata\") in G minor, Op. 8, \"Liebe\" (\"Love\"), Op. 21, after Verlaine's \"Crimen Amoris\", the Cello Sonata in C minor, \"Il Tramonto\", Op. 35, and \"Nacht der Sterne\" (\"Starry Night\"), Op. 14.\n\n"}

It was built during World War II by Italian prisoners of war, who were housed on the previously uninhabited island while they constructed the Churchill Barriers to the east of Scapa Flow. Only the concrete foundations of the other buildings of the prisoner-of-war camp survive. The chapel was not completed until after the end of the war, and was restored in the 1960s and again in the 1990s. It is a popular tourist attraction, and a category A listed building.\n\nIt is in the Roman Catholic Parish of Our Lady & St Joseph in Orkney, part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Aberdeen. Mass is held in the chapel on the first Sunday of the summer months (April–September).\n\n550 Italian prisoners of war, captured in North Africa during World War II, were brought to Orkney in 1942. They worked on the construction of the Churchill Barriers, four causeways created to block access to Scapa Flow. 200 were based at Camp 60 on Lamb Holm. In 1943, Major Thomas Pyres Buckland, Camp 60's new commandant, and Father Gioacchino Giacobazzi, the camp's Catholic priest, agreed that a place of worship was required.\n\nThe chapel was constructed from limited materials by the prisoners. Two Nissen huts were joined end-to-end. The corrugated interior was then covered with plasterboard and the altar and altar rail were constructed from concrete left over from work on the barriers. Most of the interior decoration was done by Domenico Chiocchetti, a prisoner from Moena. He painted the sanctuary end of the chapel and fellow-prisoners decorated the entire interior. They created a facade out of concrete, concealing the shape of the hut and making the building look like a church. The light holders were made out of corned beef tins. The baptismal font was made from the inside of a car exhaust covered in a layer of concrete.\n\nWhen his fellow prisoners were released shortly before the end of the war, Chiocchetti remained on the island to finish decorating the newly consecrated chapel.\n\nIn 1958, the Chapel Preservation Committee was set up by a group of Orcadians. In 1960, Chiocchetti returned to assist in the restoration. He returned again in 1964, with Mrs Maria Chiocchetti, but he was too ill to travel when some of the other prisoners returned in 1992 to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of their arrival on the island. He died in 1999. In 1996, a declaration was jointly signed by officials in Orkney and Chiocchetti's hometown of Moena, reinforcing the ties between the two places.\n\nToday, the tin tabernacle is still used as a chapel and remains a popular tourist attraction, receiving over 100,000 visitors every year. It has become one of the best-known symbols of reconciliation in the British Isles.\n\nPhilip Paris wrote two books, one fiction and one non-fiction, about the building of the chapel. The novel \"The Chapel at the Edge of the World\" by Kirsten Mckenzie covers the chapel's building.\n\nIn 2014, a special Mass was held at the chapel to mark its 70th anniversary. During the Mass, Angela Chiocchetti, the daughter of Domenico Chiocchetti, sang Panis angelicus.\n\nIn 2015, professional art restorer Antonella Papa offered and had her services accepted to restore the chapel's frescoes, spending a month on the work. She continued this work with the help of local volunteers at the end of October 2017.\n\n\n"}

He went on to win the general election with 67.78% of the vote.\n\nA resident of the Mount Lookout section of Cincinnati, Brinkman graduated from St. Xavier High School and received a B.A. (in history and political science) from George Washington University in 1979. In 1976, he worked for the Ronald Reagan campaign to win the Republican nomination for President, and for the Gerald Ford campaign following Ford's nomination at the Republican National Convention in Kansas City. While a student at GWU, he worked in the office of Senator Bob Dole of Kansas from 1977 to 1979. In 1980 he supported Congressman John B. Anderson's presidential bid, but switched his support to Reagan following the Republican National Convention. From his graduation to 1999, he was Midwest Sales Manager for the Metroweb printing company in Erlanger, Kentucky. From 2001, he has worked in the sales department of the Curry Printing Company of Evendale, Ohio.\n\nHe and his wife, Cathy, have six children: Will, Stephen, Daniel, Kelley, Kevin, and Michael.\n\nBrinkman worked for several Republicans' successful campaigns for Cincinnati City Council: Phil Heimlich, Steve Chabot, Charles Winburn, and Pat DeWine. He also worked for John Kruse's unsuccessful bid.\n\nIn 1999, he founded the Coalition Opposed to Additional Spending and Taxes (COAST), which actively opposes tax levies in southwestern Ohio. Brinkman actively worked against many tax levies and bond issues. In his Congressional campaign he declared:\n\nBrinkman defeated the candidate endorsed by the Republican party in the GOP primary in 2000 for the 37th District seat in the Ohio House, which was Anderson Township, the Hyde Park and Mount Lookout sections of Cincinnati, and the city of Norwood . A Brinkman supporter was upset by the party's endorsement process: \"All we wanted was a free, open process of endorsement, and we didn't get that,\" said Christopher Finney . In the primary, Steve Adams, the endorsed candidate, received 9,344 votes and Brinkman 11,127. In the November general election, he faced Democrat Les Mann, a security guard at General Electric's aircraft engine plant in Evendale who previously had run for Congress against Rob Portman, and Natural Law candidate Jim Donaldson. The vote was 35,245 for Brinkman (66.7%), 2,029 for Donaldson (3.8%), and 15,531 for Mann (29.4%).\n\nBrinkman ran for reelection in 2002 to what redistricting had made the 34th District, which included the Mount Washington, Hyde Park, and Mount Lookout sections of Cincinnati, part of Columbia Township, all of Anderson Township, and the municipalities of Fairfax, Newtown and Terrace Park . He faced no opposition in the May 7 primary and was opposed in the November 5 general election by Democrat David Schaff, a twenty-four-year-old assistant to Hamilton County commissioner Todd Portune. Schaff said his opponent was \"someone who's spent more time saying what he's against than working for what he's for.\" Schaff was endorsed by \"The Cincinnati Post\", which wrote\nTom Brinkman's opposition to almost everything undercuts his credibility, and does a disservice to both the district and the region. His reflexive opposition to much government spending, his willingness to tolerate a tattered social services safety net, his advocacy of an entirely unregulated concealed carry gun permit system, we submit, are out of step even with such a thoroughly Republican constituency.\n\nThat year Brinkman called on Republican voters to cast their ballots for Democrat Tim Hagan over Republican Governor Bob Taft in his reelection bid because of Taft's selection of Jennette Bradley as his running mate; many conservatives felt she was too liberal for the party. \"The Cincinnati Enquirer\"'s Peter Bronson labeled Brinkman \"Kamikaze Tom\" for this action, but nevertheless, Brinkman was easily reelected over Schaff by a vote of 23,748 to 13,896.\n\nWhen University of Cincinnati law students in 2003 persuaded the General Assembly to ratify the Fourteenth Amendment, which a post-Civil War-era legislature had rejected, only one member voted against ratification: Brinkman. Brinkman told \"The Enquirer\" his vote was because of how the amendment has been misused:\nIt's misapplied constantly by the country to get states to do things they don't want to do. Most importantly to me, 45 million babies have been murdered since judges forced \"Roe v. Wade\" down the throats of citizens.\n\nFollowing the repeal of Article XII of the Cincinnati city charter, which forbade the city from passing an ordinance protecting homosexuals from discrimination, the Cincinnati city council approved a hate crime ordinance that included sexual orientation. Brinkman said the ordinance \"send[s] the message that you openly approve of homosexuality,\" citing the Catechism of the Catholic Church\n. Brinkman had previously served as treasurer of the committee which opposed repeal of Article XII .\n\nBrinkman prided himself on his perfect attendance and for coming home to Cincinnati every night from Columbus, but when \"Columbus Monthly\" in late 2003 did a survey of legislators, lobbyists, and others working in the State House asking them to rate the members of the Ohio General Assembly, Brinkman was rated the single worst legislator in the 132-member General Assembly. The magazine said Brinkman was \"an uncompromisingly principled man. But he's a terrible, terrible legislator.\" Those surveyed ranked him as least knowledgeable, least hardworking, least likeable, least compassionate, and least savvy. Brinkman, for his part, points to his principled stance on the issues as the reason lobbyists don't like him.\n\nIn 2007, Representative Brinkman was named the chairman of the House Commerce and Labor Committee.\n\nIn 2004, he faced a challenger in the primary, attorney Greg Delev of Anderson Township. Brinkman told the \"Enquirer\", \"I ran for office when the party wanted to dictate who my state representative was going to be. I couldn't stand for that, so I ran, and I'm proud I did. It's been a frustrating three years as I've watched Governor Taft drive the state off a cliff. But I've been fighting back.\" Delev said he agreed with Brinkman on most of the issues, but that Brinkman's actions in Columbus had made the district \"the laughingstock of the state.\" \"The Cincinnati Enquirer\" said both candidates were \"rock-ribbed conservatives who agree on most fiscal and social issues,\" but endorsed Delev. \"The issue here is Brinkman's lack of effectiveness,\" said the newspaper, echoing the \"Columbus Monthly\" article:\nFew lawmakers are as honest, principled and consistent as Brinkman. But he exhibits those qualities to a fault, coming off as stubborn, ideologically rigid and unwilling to compromise. He's made many enemies in Columbus by refusing to see anyone else's side of things. This has limited his ability to work with others and get things done. Brinkman won the March 2 primary: 7,113 (63.00%) to 4,178 (37.00%).\n\nIn the general election on November 2 he faced Democrat Glenn Miller of Anderson Township, a former history teacher who worked in job training. \"I think the biggest issue of this race is Tom Brinkman—how he votes and how he's against everything,\" Miller said. \"The Enquirer\", again citing his stubbornness, endorsed Miller . Despite the criticism, Brinkman once again won the Republican district by a comfortable margin: 35,229 (60.04%) for Brinkman to 23,451 (39.96%) for Miller.\n\nBrinkman strongly supported concealed carry legislation. \"We have a constitutional right to bear arms. Larry Flynt has a right to put out smut and some people may not like that, but it's a right whether we like it or not,\" he said . Brinkman sponsored legislation to allow ex-cons the right to cut hair. He called \"stupid\" the policy of the state regulators to deny prisoners who had taken prison-administered barber classes a license upon their release. \"I'm for personal responsibility, but people do make mistakes and we should give them a second chance,\" Brinkman said .\n\nBrinkman also worked to limit state spending just as he had opposed local projects. In 2003, he opposed Taft's \"Third Frontier\" project and the bond issue on the November ballot as Issue One which would have permitted the state to borrow money to subsidize business's research and development. \"Who would have thought a Republican governor would run on this?\" Brinkman said (Issue One was soundly defeated by voters). When Taft proposed in 2004 the question once more be submitted to the voters, Brinkman renewed his criticism. \"Corporate welfare is corporate welfare. Just because you buy off the manufacturers with more money for them, and you buy off the farmers, doesn't change what it is.\" He said he would join Democrats in voting against its placement on the November 2005 ballot.\nBrinkman in 2004 criticized state spending for Cincinnati's bid to win the 2012 Olympic Games and against legislation in 2004 to give hospitals more money for breast cancer examinations . Later that year, he spearheaded a campaign to repeal the City of Cincinnati property tax. While it did make it to the November ballot, it was rejected by the voters . He was also a supporter of Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell's proposed amendment to the Ohio Constitution to limit state spending . In 2005, he was one of only eight Republicans in the Ohio House to vote against the state budget, which raised taxes and increased spending. Previously, he had opposed Governor Taft's proposed personal income tax cut because it would mean higher local property taxes. He also called for funding for public libraries to be maintained.\n\nOn April 28, 2005, he introduced a bill, House Bill 228, that would ban all abortions. Brinkman acknowledged that the bill was unconstitutional under \"Roe v. Wade\", but wanted to use it as a test case to overturn the \"Roe\" decision. \"We’re just positioning the state for the future,\" he told the Cleveland \"Plain Dealer\". He re-introduced the ban on July 2007, despite the additional burden of Gov. Strickland's veto threat. Six months before, he passed legislation for Ohio to conduct a study of how the death penalty has been administered in the state. \"I'd like to abolish it or have a moratorium, but you've got to start somewhere.\" \n\nBrinkman ran for Congress in 2005 to replace Portman, announcing his candidacy outside the post office in Anderson Township on April 14 . Brinkman told the press \"When I first went to Columbus, I promised my constituents that I would fight for lower taxes, limited government, and to end abortion. I will do the same in Washington.\" An early poll found Pat DeWine, a member of the Hamilton County Commission and the son of U.S. Sen. Mike DeWine, with a significant lead: 42 percent for DeWine, 6 percent for Brinkman.\n\nBrinkman had a strong anti-abortion stance that was criticized by rival candidate Pat DeWine because he also opposed the death penalty - despite such opposition being seemingly \"more\" anti-abortion, as it is in accordance with the Consistent Life Ethic. One mailing from DeWine had a large, ominous photograph of a man in a ski mask pointing a gun directly at the viewer. The caption was \"Tom Brinkman opposes the death penalty, even for child murderers, cop killers and terrorists who kill Americans.\" The mailing also stated \"Tom Brinkman says he's a conservative but when it comes to the safety of our families, he doesn't stand with us\" and that murderers \"will get off easy if he casts the deciding vote.\" DeWine did not note that Brinkman's opposition to the death penalty was rooted in his pro-life beliefs. Automated calls were made by DeWine's campaign featuring Joe Deters, Hamilton County prosecutor. Deters in the recording stated:\n\nIn my career when I prosecute the worst of the worst like people who kill children, I believe the only appropriate punishment is the death penalty. Tom Brinkman is against the death penalty even for those vicious killers who prey on our kids, and he's even against the death penalty for terrorists who kill Americans. Our next congressman must go to Washington and fight to remove these murderers from society. Tom Brinkman will work to stop the death penalty just as he's done in Columbus. Pat DeWine believes these people should go. And that's one more reason I support Pat DeWine for Congress.\n\nOne of Brinkman's mailings said \"Tom Brinkman believes all life is precious and must be protected. He has a 100% pro-life voting record.\" Brinkman's position was that he was \"100% pro-life from conception to natural death.\" While DeWine also stated his pro-life position, Brinkman noted on his web site \"Because of [my] unwavering support of the Right to Life, from conception to natural death, Ohio Right to Life, Cincinnati Right to Life and Family First have again exclusively endorsed my election this year.\" In an Associated Press article, Brinkman was quoted as putting it more simply, saying he was \"pro-life all the way\" .\n\nBrinkman also complained about DeWine taking advantage of his father's name in raising money, but publicly distancing himself from his father's positions, such as Senator DeWine's role in the \"Gang of 14\" judicial filibuster compromise in May 2005 with six other mostly center-leaning Republicans and seven mostly center-leaning Democrats. \"He seems to have no problems riding his father's coattails when it comes to raising money and getting name recognition; he's willing to take all the good from it and none of the bad.\" \n\nIn one mailing to voters Brinkman did not mince words:\nI am sick and tired of watching politicians promise to cut taxes in October—then raise them in March.\nI have had it with candidates who campaign against big government and later give in to the money hungry bureaucrats.\nI will not tolerate ideologically bent liberals trying to shift our educational focus from English and math to \" 'safe sex' and homosexual acceptance\". [His emphasis] \n\nIn another mailing, he declared \"He meant what he promised. He promised what he meant. Brinkman is faithful 100% ... 100% Against Higher Taxes ... 100% Committed to Limited Government ... 100% Pro-life ... 100% Pro-Second Amendment ... 100% Attendance Record,\" the latter referring to his never missing a roll call vote in the Ohio House.\n\nBrinkman was endorsed by the Ohio Taxpayers Association, the Gun Owners of America Political Victory Fund, and was the National Right to Work Committee's 2005 state legislator of the year. The Anderson Township Republican Club ranked him \"highly qualified\". \"The Cincinnati Enquirer\" endorsed Jean Schmidt, praising her record in the Ohio House, writing of her substantial record. Schmidt, said the \"Enquirer\", the measures \"successfully sponsored were remarkable in number and quality for a neophyte lawmaker\". The paper contrasted her to Brinkman, who \n\nBrinkman ran well in the June 14 primary but finished third behind former state representative Schmidt with 9,211 (20.3%) of the vote.\n\nBrinkman had considered a challenge to Schmidt in the May 2006 primary but chose instead to run for re-election to the Ohio House.\n\nIn 2008, Brinkman declared his candidacy for Ohio's 2nd Congressional District, challenging incumbent Schmidt. He lost in a landslide defeat to Congresswoman Schmidt.\n\nIn 2014, Brinkman decided to run again for his former seat in the Ohio House of Representatives. However, incumbent Peter Stautberg did not want to give up his seat, so Brinkman opted to challenge him in the primary. He would defeat Stautberg to take the seat. He won the general election easily to take the seat.\n\n\n\n"}

Its main bases' were London Southend Airport.\n\nThe company held a United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority Type A Operating Licence, and was permitted to carry passengers, cargo and mail on aircraft with 20 or more seats.\n\nFlightline operated up to 14 flights a day between Aberdeen (ABZ) and Scatsta in the Shetland Isles (SCS) on behalf of Royal Dutch Shell and other members of the IAC (Integrated Aviation Consortium). Offshore workers were flown to Scatsta Airport and then transferred onto helicopters to several oil platforms, however this contract was due to end in February 2009.\n\nFlightline also had a maintenance facility at its Southend base which provided base maintenance for the BAe-146 fleet as well as a small number of 3rd party aircraft.

{"id": "2002199", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2002199", "title": "Monique Haas", "text": "Monique Haas\n\nMonique Haas (20 October 1909 – 9 June 1987) was a French pianist.\n\nBorn in Paris, she studied at the Conservatoire de Paris there with Joseph Morpain and Lazare Lévy, taking a \"Premier Prix\" in 1927. She went on to study with Rudolf Serkin and Robert Casadesus. As a performer she toured all over the world, winning much praise for her performances of 20th-century music. The composer Francis Poulenc, himself an accomplished pianist, praised her as \"\"the adorable Monique Haas who plays the piano ravishingly\"\", and Henri Dutilleux described her as \"\"a celebrated interpreter of the music of Ravel\"\"\n\nLike many of the French pianists who grew up in the aftermath of the First World War, Monique Haas's repertoire was characterised by an avoidance of Romantic composers and a significant representation of French music. Pieces by François Couperin and Jean-Philippe Rameau appeared regularly on her programmes, as well as that of Mozart and Haydn. The music of Schumann was the significant exception to her neglect of romanticism, though she also included Chopin's studies in her repertoire.\n\nHowever, it was as a performer of twentieth-century French music that Haas is best remembered. Her recordings of Debussy include the comparatively neglected \"Douze Études\", which won a Grand Prix du Disque, and the \"Préludes\". She also recorded both of the Ravel concertos, the G major twice, as well as his complete solo piano music.\n\nShe was a noted interpreter of Bartók's music, and performed his third piano concerto only a few days after its world premiere by György Sándor. Another non-French composer whose works appealed to her was Hindemith; she made a valuable recording of his Suite for Piano and Strings \"The Four Temperaments\". She also recorded his Konzertmusik For Piano, Brass & Harp with Hindemith himself conducting.\n\nFrench piano players of Haas's generation were moving away from the facile and often brittle technique associated with Marguerite Long (frequently referred to as the \"diggy-diggy-dee\" style). Haas combined the cleanness and precision associated with the older school with a warmth of tone colour that reflected the influence of Alfred Cortot. Her unsentimental readings, especially of Debussy and Ravel, give a different view of their music, presenting them as both modern and as inheritors of the tradition of Couperin and the \"clavecinistes\" of the 18th century.\n\nFascinating contrasts can be found between her two recordings of the Ravel Concerto in G. The earlier one, made in 1948, makes much of the work's connections with the jazz idiom of the 1920s. The later recording, made in 1965, on the other hand, is far more \"Mozartean\", reflecting Ravel's self-confessed debt to Mozart when he wrote the concerto.\n\n\nMonique Haas was married to the French-Romanian composer Marcel Mihalovici.\n"}

First held in 1887, the Cup celebrated its 120th anniversary in 2007.\n\nSchools Senior Cup Rugby is divided into 4 tiers in two sections and each cup competition bears a name as follows: Section A Leinster Schools Rugby Senior Development Cup (effectively division 4), Section A Leinster Schools Rugby McMullen Cup (effectively division 3), Section B Leinster Schools Vinnie Murray Cup (effectively division 2), Section B Leinster Schools Senior Challenge Cup (effectively division 1).\n\nAttendances are high for a schoolboy competition, with up to 25,000 present at the final. This match traditionally takes place on Saint Patrick's Day at Lansdowne Road (now known as the Aviva Stadium). In 2008, the final was played at the Royal Dublin Society Grounds (RDS) after Donnybrook proved to be too small for the 2007 final, (Lansdowne Road was closed for redevelopment) and has been the home since. Since the move to the RDS, the attendance has decreased and is now typically 10,000–14,000.\n\nThe competition has been subject to criticism from various quarters as being \"elitist\" (as most of the competing schools are fee-paying; in fact only one non fee-paying school has won the cup, De La Salle Churchtown) and for putting undue pressure on its participants. It is also the subject of satire through the Ross O'Carroll Kelly newspaper column and novels. The competition and schools rugby in the four provinces has also been praised with \"Irish (rugby) game in debt to schools rugby\".\n\nBlackrock College are the most successful school in the Cup's history, having won 69 times, an accumulative total larger than all other teams combined.\n\nThree schools have won the Cup at their first attempt; Blackrock College in the competition's maiden year in 1887, Castleknock College who won the first of their eight Leinster titles at the first time of asking when they defeated Blackrock in the 1913 final and Clongowes Wood College who first won the cup in 1926. St. Fintan's High School are the most recent 'new' school to the competition, making their debut in 2016/17 season and are coached by Belvedere College 2008 Senior Cup winning captain Thomas Sexton and vice-captain Peter Synnott.\n\nTo date, only six schools have achieved the Senior and Junior Cup \"double\". These are Blackrock, who have achieved this feat 27 times (1910, 1912, 1927, 1933, 1935–36, 1942–43, 1945, 1948, 1953–54, 1956–57, 1962, 1964, 1981–82, 1986–87, 1995, 2004, 2006, 2013–14, 2018), St Michaels twice (2012 & 2019), Newbridge (2020), Belvedere (2005), Terenure (1958) and Castleknock College (1920).\n\nEven more rare is to lose both the Senior and Junior Cup Finals in the same year. This depressing feat has been achieved by seven schools on 12 occasions. Terenure College leads with 4 (1957, 1964, 1969 & 1987), followed by Belvedere College with 3 (1930, 1944 & 1962), next St Michaels College (2010), St Mary's College (1943), Newbridge College (1939), Cistercian College Roscrea (1910) and Blackrock College (2017) with 1 each. This happened to Blackrock College for the first time in 2017.\n\nBlackrock College have only been defeated in successive finals on two occasions. In the 1920s they were runners up three times in a row, defeated by St Andrews in 1921 & 1922 followed by Belvedere in 1923. The second occasion was in 1979 & 1980 when they were defeated in successive finals by Terenure College.\n\nThe 91st Leinster Senior Schools Cup Final in 1977 between Blackrock College and St Mary's College finished level at 12 points each at the end of normal time. Having played 70 minutes the two sides now faced an additional 15 minutes extra time. Six minutes into extra time Blackrock got a try from fullback Patrick Hinkson. Hugo MacNeill kicked the sideline conversion. Two further MacNeill penalties in the second half of extra time sealed victory for Blackrock. Among the future Irish senior internationals playing that day were Hugo MacNeill and Paul Dean. The 1977 Leinster Senior Schools Cup Final was played on Sunday 20 March 1977 and not the normal St Patrick's Day. This decision was made to protect the Lansdowne Road pitch following poor weather prior to the Ireland v France Five Nations fixture on 19 March. Grainy video footage is available on archives on www.rte.ie. The edition of Sports Club was broadcast 31 March 1977. The commentator is Fred Cogley.\n\nIn September 1967, the then Minister for Education Donogh O'Malley introduced free secondary school education. Only very few Rugby Playing secondary schools opted to join the \"Free Education\" scheme. To date, only one of these non-fee paying schools has managed to win the Senior Cup. In 1983 and 1985, De La Salle Churchtown beat Castleknock College and Blackrock College.\n\nFour captains have gained the distinction of lifting the cup twice, Larry McMahon (Blackrock College, 1929 and 1930), Garret Gill (Blackrock College,1962 and 1963), Jonny Mion (Blackrock College) in 1989 and 1990, Barry Gibney (Blackrock College) in 1995 and 1996.\n\nThe Cup, and the Schools who play for it, have a history of producing fine rugby players, many of whom go on to play for Ireland. Players such as Denis Hickie, who captained his St. Mary's College team to win the cup in 1994, and Gordon D'Arcy have impressive senior cup records. The most international players produced have come from Blackrock College, with players such as Hugo MacNeill, Brendan Mullin, Brian O'Driscoll, Victor Costello, Shane Byrne, Bob Casey, Leo Cullen and more recently Luke Fitzgerald, Ian Madigan, Jordi Murphy, Garry Ringrose and Joey Carbery. Terenure College has also produced many Irish international players including Mick Hipwell (also Lion's 1971), Kevin Flynn, Paul Haycock, Niall Hogan (Irish Captain 1995), Conor O'Shea (former head coach Italian national team), Ciaran Clarke, and Girvan Dempsey. De La Salle Churchtown produced the following Internationals - Des Fitzgerald (34 caps) played in 2 RWCs. Named to Lions Team to mark centenary of IRB\nTom Clancy (9 caps), Brian Glennon (1 cap), Niyi Adeolokun (1 cap), Lar Hudson (7 caps) and Austin Quirke (6 caps for France).\n\nThe 2020 season has not been completed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n¹ Corrig School moved premises to Monkstown Park in 1950 and was renamed C.B.C.

In this table, the result of the replay is given below the result of the drawn game.\n\nThe point values of scores in rugby union have changed many times in its history. This table summarises them.\n\n\nThe competition was known for several years as the \"Coca-Cola Leinster Schools Senior Cup\" and in more recent years the \"Powerade Leinster Schools Senior Cup\" (Powerade is also owned by the Coca-Cola Company). In September 2013, Beauchamps Solicitors became the new title sponsor for the Leinster Schools Senior Cup. For the duration of this partnership with Beauchamps, the Senior Cup will be known as the \"Beauchamps Leinster Schools Senior Cup\".\n\nThe competition receives extensive coverage in Ireland's broadsheets, in particular the \"Irish Independent\" and \"The Irish Times\". Both publish previews of each year's competition and provide match reports for each game played.\n\nIn years gone by the competition's final on St Patrick's Day would sometimes be broadcast on TG4, however, this was discontinued in the early 2000s. From 2005 onwards, however, Setanta Sports began extensive coverage of school's rugby. This included the finals of all provincial finals and coverage of the Leinster Schools Junior Cup. The Leinster Senior Cup was most prominent, however, with coverage from every game played at Donnybrook and every round of the competition.\n\nFreeSports replaced Eir Sport as the competition broadcaster ahead of the 2019 competition where they will broadcast eight games live.\n\nIn 2008, Leinster Rugby instituted a new award for overall performance of a school at every level of schools rugby. The award, Powerade Leinster Rugby School of the Year is given at the annual Leinster awards ceremony.\n\nThe inaugural winners were C.B.C. Monkstown. They were followed in by Terenure College (2009), St Gerard's School (2010), Clongowes Wood College (2011), St. Michael's College (2012), (2019) and Blackrock College (2013), (2018).

Guided by manager Ivo Ištuk, Bosna won the Bosnian Cup, Bosnian Supercup and made great results in the First League of Bosnia and Herzegovina, even almost winning it in the 1997–98 season.\n\nNK Bosna was founded in 1953 in the city of Visoko with the merging of local sides \"NK Jadran\" (1923) and \"NK Radnički\" (1934) into a single club. After spending a decade in the third-tier, the club got promoted to the Yugoslav Second League in 1963, which was the club's biggest achievement in the former Yugoslavia. Bosna again got promoted to the second league in 1978 after winning the Bosnia and Herzegovina Republic League. The club stayed in the league for three years, before being relegated in the 1980–81 season.\n\nIn the 1995–96 (north) Second League of Bosnia and Herzegovina season, Bosna finished on 1st place and got promoted to the First League of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nThe club had its biggest success in the late 1990s under the guidance of current manager Ivo Ištuk. In the 1997–98 First League of Bosnia and Herzegovina season, the club finished the first round on 1st place, but did not win the whole league as it succumbed in the group stage play-offs. The next season, Bosna had great success, as it won the 1998–99 Bosnia and Herzegovina Football Cup, the first trophy in the club's history and the next season, won the Bosnian Supercup in 1999.\n\nAfter years of playing in the First League of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in the 1999–00 league season, Bosna got relegated to the First League of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nIn the 2000–01 season, alongside HNK Grude, Bosna got promoted back to the Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina. After two seasons of Premier League football, in the 2002–03 season, Bosna finished on last place and got relegated once again to the First League of FBiH.\n\nSince getting relegated from the top tier of Bosnian football again in May 2003, Bosna mostly played in the First League of FBiH, with three seasons of them also playing in the Second League of FBiH (center) (2011–12, 2013–14 and 2014–15) and the fourth (2019–20) season to be played.\n\nFor a short period, from January to May 2013, 17 years after leaving Bosna, Ivo Ištuk, the club's most successful manager in history came back to the club and managed the club in that period.\n\nOn 5 August 2014, Bosna and FK Sarajevo signed a cooperation agreement by which Sarajevo will loan its talented youngsters to the Visoko-based side and will have first-buy rights on all NK Bosna players. By signing this agreement, Bosna \"de facto\" became Sarajevo's farm team. The agreement was signed by Adis Hajlovac and Mirza Laletović on behalf of Bosna, and Abdulah Ibraković on behalf of Sarajevo.\n\nIn the 2016–17 First League of FBiH season, Bosna throughout the whole season held 1st place and were really close to coming back to the Bosnian Premier League, but at the end of the season they failed to finish 1st as bad results costed them the promotion. At the end they finished 2nd, six points off champions NK GOŠK Gabela and only two points more than 3rd place FK Tuzla City, at that time still known as \"FK Sloga Simin Han\".\n\nOn 5 April 2017, almost four years after leaving the club, Ivo Ištuk once again came back to Bosna and became the new manager. In July 2019, he left the club after over two years as its manager.\n\nIn the 2018–19 First League of FBiH season, Bosna for a third time in the club's history got relegated to the Second League of FBiH (center).\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n"}

He was the eldest son of Samuel Parkes (died 1 April 1811, aged 76), a grocer, by his first wife, Hannah, daughter of William Mence of Stourbridge. He was at a dame's school in Stourbridge with Sarah Kemble, and in 1771 went to a boarding-school at Market Harborough, Leicestershire, under Stephen Addington.\n\nParkes began his career in his father's business. In 1790 he was one of the founders, and for some years president, of a public library at Stourbridge. Around 1793 he moved to Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire. A Unitarian, he conducted public worship in his own house at Stoke. In 1803 he settled in Goswell Street, London, as a manufacturing chemist.\n\nHe joined Sir Thomas Bernard in agitating (1817) against salt duties, which were repealed in 1825. In 1820 he was prominent, as a chemical expert, in a notable case between Messrs. Severn, King, & Co. and some insurance offices. He was a numismatist, and made a collection of Greek and Roman coins; he was a collector also of prints and autographs, and brought together a set of the works of Joseph Priestley. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1823.\n\nParkes was a member of 21 learned societies, British and foreign. During a visit to Edinburgh, in June 1825, he went down a painful disorder, which proved fatal. He died at his residence in Mecklenburgh Square, London, on 23 December 1825, and was buried in the graveyard of the New Gravel Pit Chapel, Hackney. His funeral sermon was preached by William Johnson Fox.\n\nHis portrait, from a drawing by Abraham Wivell, and engraved by Ambrose William Warren, was prefixed to the twelfth and thirteenth editions of the \"Chemical Catechism\".\n\nThe first editions of Parkes's manuals of chemistry were issued between 1806 and 1815, and brought him a reputation, and honours from learned societies. The \"Chemical Catechism\" was written for the education of his daughter, and lent in manuscript to others. After it was translated into Russian, the Emperor of Russia sent him a valuable ring. In 1817 the Highland Society voted him a silver inkstand for an essay on kelp and barilla. He received a silver cup from the Horticultural Society of Scotland for a paper on the uses of salt in gardening.\n\nParkes published:\n\n\nParkes wrote papers \"On Nitric Acid\" (\"Philosophical Magazine\", 1815), \"Reply to Dr. Henry ... respecting ... Bleaching by Oxymuriatic Acid\" (Thomson's \"Annals of Philosophy\", 1816), and \"On the Analysis of some Roman Coins\" (\"Quarterly Journal of Science\", 1826).\n\nThe \"Chemical Catechism\" includes poetical descriptions of chemical processes. Here is his description of plant respiration:\n\nParkes married, on 23 September 1794, Sarah (born 25 February 1766; died 14 December 1813), eldest daughter of Samuel Twamley of Bromsgrove, Worcestershire.

Agents. JC Comics was owned by John Carbonaro (Sept. 30, 1951 – Feb. 25, 2009).\n\nCarbonaro acquired the rights to the T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents from the defunct Tower Comics, and tried to relaunch them with his own comic book company.\n\nShortly after acquiring the T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents rights, Carbonaro made an arrangement with Archie Comics to print and distribute JC Comics' titles, in conjunction with Archie's own attempted relaunch of their old superhero imprint Red Circle Comics. This resulted in cross-advertisements between the two companies and appearances of the companies' characters in each other's titles. Although Carbonaro was hired as an editor at Archie, Archie never owned the T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents characters; nor was JC Comics an Archie imprint.\n\nFrom 1981 to 1984, JC Comics published three T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents titles: \"JCP Features\", a single issue featuring early work by the artist Mark Texeira (which also contained an Archie \"Black Hood\" reprint); \"Hall of Fame Featuring the T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents\", a three-issue series reprinting stories from the titular superhero team's original 1960s Tower Comics series, with new covers by artists including Steve Ditko and Bob Layton; and the two-issue series \"T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents\", featuring new stories. Ultimately, the wrap-up story of the latter series appeared in Red Circle's \"Blue Ribbon Comics\" anthology title.\n\nDuring this period, JC Comics also published a single issue of \"Basically Strange\", a black-and-white horror comics magazine featuring artist Rick Bryant and writer-artist Bruce Jones.\n\nAlso in 1983, Carbonaro arranged for the T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents to appear in a crossover adventure with Justice Machine, then being published by Texas Comics.\n\nIn 1984, a former associate of Carbonaro named David M. Singer claimed that the T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agent characters were in the public domain. He founded Deluxe Comics and began publishing a new series, \"Wally Wood's T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents\", featuring top artists including George Pérez, Dave Cockrum, Keith Giffen, Murphy Anderson, and Jerry Ordway. A lawsuit by Carbonaro asserting his copyright and trademark rights was heard in the federal district court for the Southern District of New York (John Carbonaro, et. al. v. David Singer, et. al., 84 Civ. 8737 (S.D.N.Y.), and via summary judgment, the judge ruled from the bench that the T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents were indeed Carbonaro's property. Under the settlement, Carbonaro received an assignment of all rights to \"Wally Woods T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents\", and an undisclosed sum of money.\n\nOver the years, JC Comics tried many times to launch new T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents material. A 1995 deal with Penthouse Comix resulted in a single story in \"Omni Comix\".\n\nIn the early 2000s another attempt to revive the characters was planned with DC Comics, but the \"T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents Archive\" and some statutettes are all that came of it.\n\nFollowing Carbonaro's 2009 death, DC briefly licensed the rights to the T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents from owners Radiant Assets, and they have since been licensed by IDW Publishing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was commissioned to do mural paintings at the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco for the World's Fair in 1915.\n\nHis vivid use of colors and graphics won him recognition in Hollywood, where he worked on 33 films—29 times as art director and twice as set director. In 1925 he was the architecture and set director for the original film based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's \"The Lost World\". This film received accolades for its innovative art direction and special effects. To quote one review in the NewTimes: \"And while Harry O. Hoyt is credited as director, a host of fellow auteurs must take credit for Lost World's still impressive thrills, especially the effects work of Willis O'Brien (who would later animate \"King Kong\" in 1933) and the wild set design from Milton Menasco.\" A complete list of Menasco's film credits is given here.\n\nIn 1925 Menasco went to New York City as art director for a film making company and turned to advertising. He also painted portraits and water colors of horses and ships during this time which he sold in the City's galleries. During World War II, \"Life magazine\" commissioned him to draw air and sea battles to chronicle the war in Europe and in the Pacific Theater.\n\nAfter the war, Menasco moved to Kentucky to devote himself entirely to his real love, horse portraiture. Here he painted the equine racing greats of the nation and helped with art direction at the \"Thoroughbred Record\" and \"Sporting News\". He and his wife purchased a farm where an old brick house built in the 18th century served for many years as his studio.\n\nHorsemen admired the richness and feeling reflected in Menasco's paintings, and his clients included John Hay Whitney, Isabel Dodge Sloane, President Ronald Reagan and Allaire du Pont. One of his first large paintings was for Lucille Markey depicting nine of her horses at Calumet Farm, including Citation, Coaltown and others grouped in the track with exercise boys up. Menasco also painted Secretariat for owner Penny Chenery.\n\nIn 1953 Menasco painted the famous broodmare La Troienne in a work entitled \"La Troienne and Her Foals: Eighteen Vignettes and One Painting Together in One Frame\" for John Whitney. The painting was exhibited at the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art and the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in Saratoga Springs, New York. In 1999 it sold from the estate of Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney through Sotheby's auction house for £74,000 (c. US$120,000).\n\nIn 1957, Menasco painted Doubledogdare and Delta for Arthur B. Hancock, Jr. The artist explained that although the actual painting had taken him about three months to complete, \"behind it goes all the training, study and experience of my life.\"\n\nA distinguishing mark of Menasco's paintings is the detail to sky and landscape backgrounds. A perfect example of this detail is apparent in Nashua, with Eddie Arcaro up, painted by Menasco at Hialeah Park for Leslie Combs II. The background shows the track and a ring of palm trees.\n\nMilton Menasco died in 1974 of a heart attack at his farm in Versailles, Kentucky.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2002248", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2002248", "title": "Dal Lake", "text": "Dal Lake\n\nDal is a lake in Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir, India. It is an urban lake, which is the second largest in the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir. It is integral to tourism and recreation in Kashmir and is named the \"Lake of Flowers\", \"Jewel in the crown of Kashmir\" or \"Srinagar's Jewel\". The lake is also an important source for commercial operations in fishing and water plant harvesting.\n\nThe shore line of the lake, about , is encompassed by a boulevard lined with Mughal era gardens, parks, houseboats and hotels. Scenic views of the lake can be witnessed from the shore line Mughal gardens, such as Shalimar Bagh and Nishat Bagh built during the reign of Mughal Emperor Jahangir and from houseboats cruising along the lake in the colourful shikaras. During the winter season, the temperature sometimes reaches , freezing the lake.\n\nThe lake covers an area of and is part of a natural wetland which covers , including its floating gardens. The floating gardens, known as \"Rad\" in Kashmiri, blossom with lotus flowers during July and August. The wetland is divided by causeways into four basins; \"Gagribal\", \"Lokut Dal\", \"Bod Dal\" and \"Nigeen\" (although Nigeen is also considered as an independent lake). Lokut-dal and Bod-dal each have an island in the centre, known as \"Rup Lank\" (or \"Char Chinari\") and \"Sona Lank\" respectively.\n\nAt present, the Dal and its Mughal gardens, Shalimar Bagh and the Nishat Bagh on its periphery are undergoing intensive restoration measures to fully address the serious eutrophication problems experienced by the lake. Massive investments of approximately US$275 million ( 11 billion) are being made by the Government of India to restore the lake to its original splendour.\nDal is mentioned as Mahasarit (Sanskrti-महासरित्) in ancient Sanskrit texts. Ancient history records mention that a village named Isabar to the east of Dal was the residence of goddess Durga.\nThis place was known as Sureshwari on the bank of the lake, which was sourced by a spring called the Satadhara.\n\nDuring the Mughal period, the Mughal rulers of India designated Kashmir, Srinagar in particular, as their summer resort. They developed the precincts of the Dal in Srinagar with sprawling Mughal-type gardens and pavilions as pleasure resorts to enjoy the salubrious cool climate. After the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, which led to the disintegration of the Mughal Empire, Pashtun tribes in the area around the lake and city increased, and the Afghan Durrani Empire ruled the city for several decades. In 1814 a significant part of the Kashmir valley, including Srinagar, was annexed from the Afghans by Raja Ranjit Singh to his kingdom, and the Sikhs grew in influence in the region for 27 years.\n\nDuring the Dogra Raj, Srinagar became the capital of Dogra territory, attracted by the cool climate of the Kashmir valley, amidst the back drop of the majestic snow covered Himalayan ranges. The lake precincts experience temperatures in the range of during winter and during the summer season. The lake freezes when temperatures drop to about during severe winter. Although the Dogra Maharaja of Kashmir restricted the building of houses in the valley, the British circumvented this rule by commissioning lavish houseboats to be built on the Dal. The houseboats have been referred to as, \"each one a little piece of England afloat on Dal.\"\n\nAfter the independence of India, the Kashmiri Hanji people have built, owned and maintained these houseboats, cultivating floating gardens and producing commodities for the market, making them the centre of their livelihoods. The houseboats, closely associated with Dal also provide accommodation in Srinagar. Following the Mughal, Afghan, Sikh and Dogra rule, the place has earned the epithet, \"Jewel in the crown of Kashmir\".\n\nThe lake is located within a catchment area covering in the Zabarwan mountain valley, in the foothills of the Shankracharya hills, which surrounds it on three sides. The lake, which lies to the east and north of Srinagar city covers an area of , although including the floating gardens of lotus blooms, it is (an estimated figure of is also mentioned). The main basin draining the lake is a complex of five interconnected basins with causeways; the Nehru Park basin, the Nishat basin, the Hazratbal basin, the Nigeen basin and the Barari Nambal basin. Navigational channels provide the transportation links to all the five basins.\n\nThe average elevation of the lake is . The depth of water varies from at its deepest in Nigeen lake to , the shallowest at Gagribal. The depth ratio between the maximum and minimum depths varies with the season between 0.29 and 0.25, which is interpreted as flat bed slope. The length of the lake is with a width of . The lake has e basin hava shore length of and roads run all along the periphery. Irreversible changes through urban developments have placed further restrictions on the flow of the lake and as a result, marshy lands have emerged on the peripheral zones, notably in the foothill areas of the Shankaracharya and Zaharbwan hills. These marshy lands have since been reclaimed and converted into large residential complexes.\n\nMultiple theories explaining the origin of this lake have been formulated. One version is that it is the remnants of a post-glacial lake, which has undergone drastic changes in size over the years and the other theory is that it is of fluvial origin from an old flood spill channel or ox-bows of the Jhelum River. The dendritic drainage pattern of the catchment signifies that its rock strata have low levels of porosity. Lithologically, a variety of rock types have been discerned namely, igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary. The Dachigam Telbal Nallah system is conjectured to follow two major lineaments. Discontinuous surfaces seen in the terrain are attributed to the angular and parallel drainage pattern. The water table cuts the hill slopes, which is evidenced by the occurrence of numerous springs in the valley. Seismic activity in the valley is recorded under Zone V of the Seismic Zoning Map of India, the most severe zone where frequent damaging earthquakes of intensity IX could be expected. In the year 2005, Kashmir valley experienced one of the severe earthquakes measured at 7.6 on the Richter's scale, which resulted in deaths and the destruction of many properties, leaving many homeless.\n\nThe shallow, open-drainage lake is fed by Dachigam-Telbal Nallah (with perennial flow), Dara Nallah ('Nallah' means \"stream\") and many other small streams. The lake is classified as 'warm monomictic' under the sub-tropical lake category. Spring sources also contribute to the flow, although no specific data is available to quantify their contribution.\nTo address this, water balance studies to analyse and assess the characteristics of flow have been conducted in order to approximate the discharge contributed by the springs in the lake bed. The complex land use pattern of the valley is reflected in the urbanised Srinagar in its north, with rice fields, orchards and gardens in the lower slopes, and barren hills beyond steep sloping hills. The flat topography also affects drainage conditions. It receives an average annual rainfall of in the catchment, but during the summer, snow melt from the higher ranges of the catchment results in large inflows into the lake.\nThe maximum flood discharge of Telbal Nallah has been assessed as 141.5 metres/s for a one in hundred return period; the 1973 observed flood in Telbal Nallah has been estimated as 113 metres/s. The average annual flow, according to discharge measurements, has been estimated as 291.9 million cubic metres, with Telbal Nalah accounting for 80% of the total and 20% contributed by other sources. The silt load has been estimated at 80,000 tonnes per year with 70% contribution from the Telabal Nallah, with 36,000 tonnes recorded as settling in the lake.\n\nThere are two outlets from the lake, namely the Dalgate and Amir Khan Nallah that connects the lakes of Nigeen and Anchar Lake. Dalgate is controlled by a weir and lock system. The outflow from these two outlets has been estimated as 275.6 million cubic metres.\n\nThe ecosystem of Dal is ecologically rich in macrophytes, submerged macrophytes, floating macrophytes and phytoplankton. Macrophyte flora recorded in the lake's aquatic and marshland environment consists of 117 species, belonging to 69 genera and 42 families. The lake is noted in particular for its \"Nelumbo nucifera\" (lotus flowers) which bloom in July and August. The prolific growth of \"Ceratophyllum demersum\" in the eutrophic zones has been reported, with \"Myriophyllum spicatum\" and \"Potemogetton lucens\" cited as dominant species. Other macrophytes discerned in different zones of the lake include \"Typho angustata\", \"Phragmites australis\", \"Myriophyllum\", \"Sparganium evectum\" and \"Myriophyllum verticillatum\", which contribute to the production of macrophites. The rooted variety of the floating leaf type consists of \"Nelumbo nucifera\", \"Nymphaea alba\", \"N. tetragonia\", \"N. candida\", \"Nymphoides peltata\", \"Salvinia natans\", \"Hydrocharis dubia\", \"Nymphaea sp.\" and \"Potamogeton natans\", all of which occupy 29.2% of the lake. Phytoplanktons include \"Navicula radiosa\", \"Nitzschia accicularis\", \"Fragilaria crotonensis\", \"Diatoma elongatum\", \"Scenedesmus bijuga\", \"Pediastrum duplex\", \"Tetraedron minimum\", \"Microcystis aeruginosa\" and \"Merismopedia elegans.\"\n\nSince 1934, some important changes have been observed in the lake's biota, including a reduction in the number of \"Chara\" species, and an increase in the area covered by \"Salvinia\" since 1937. Analysis of the lake has also revealed the tendency for it to develop monospecific communities of submerged macrophytes such as \"Ceratophyllum\" and \"Myriophyllum\".\nOne of the Char Chinars\nWoody vegetation in the catchment of the lake consists of \"Melia\", \"Ailanthus\", \"Robinia\", \"Daphne\", \"Celtis\", \"Rose\", \"Ephedra\", \"Pinus roxburghii\", \"Pinus halepensis\", \"Pinus gerardiana\", \"Cupressus torulosa\" and \"Cupressus arizonica\". The valley also has a rich cultivation of crops such as paddy, wheat and fodder.\n\nFloating gardens, labelled the 'Rad' in tye Kashmiri language are a special feature of the lake. They basically constitute of matted vegetation and earth, but are floating. These are detached from the bottom of the lake and drawn to a suitable place (generally to the north west of the houseboats' location) and anchored. Given its rich nutrient properties, tomatoes, cucumbers and melons are grown with noteworthy results.\n\nThe faunal distribution consists of Zooplanktons, Benthos and Fish. Zooplankton found in the lake include \"Keratella cochlearis\", \"K. serrulata\", \"Polyactis vulgaris\", \"Brachionus plicatilis\", \"Monostyla bulla\", \"Alona monocantha\", \"Cyclops ladakanus\" and \"Mesocyclops leukarti\". Benthos\ninclude \"Chironomus sp.\" and \"Tubifex sp.\" and fish include \"Cyprinus carpio specularis\" (economically important), \"C. carpio communis\", \"Schizothorax niger\", \"S. esocinus\", \"S. curviformis\" and \"Crossochelius latius\". It is also reported that \"Cyprinus\", introduced during early sixties, is dominant and that the indigenous species \"Schizothorax\" is showing a declining trend.\n\nThe fishing industry on Dal is the second largest industry in the region and is central to many of the people's livelihoods who reside on the lake's periphery. Dal's commercial fisheries are particularly reliant on carp fish species, which were introduced into the lake in 1957. As a result, carp constitutes 70% of all the fish caught in the lake while the schizothonax constitutes 20% and other species account for 10%. Fishermen use a locally manufactured cast net which comprises six parts with a diameter of 6 metres. It is operated from a wooden fishing boat made out of deodar, typically 20ftx4ft in size. The gradual decline in quality of the lake water through pollution has resulted in lower fish stocks and the extinction of endemic varieties of fish. The causes for such deterioration have been identified and remedial actions have been initiated.The various fishing nets being used in Dal are cast net (Zaal/Duph), Long line (Walruz), Gill net (Pachi, Shaitan zaal), Rod and line (Bislai), Scoop net (Attha zaal) (Bhat et al., 2008)\n\nThe lake is warm monomictic (mixing type) and the pH value recorded has varied from a minimum of 7.2 to a maximum of 8.8 on the surface over a yearly period. The Dissolved oxygen [mg l] value has varied from a minimum of 1.4 to a maximum of 12.3 on the surface within a year. The Recorded maximum nitrogen concentration (NH-N [micro l] has been recorded as 1315 on the surface and 22 at the bottom of the lake. Phosphorus concentration expressed in Total-P [micro l] has varied from a high of 577 to a low of 35 during the 12 months of the year. The lake water temperature has varied from a minimum of in January to in June at the surface. Transparency, expressed as depth in metres, has varied from a maximum of in July to a minimum of in March, over the 12 months period.\n\nStudies of the water quality of the lake in 1983–84 indicate a decline in quality since the 1965–66 analysis. Scientific research over the years also reveal that Telbal, Botkal, and sewage drains are responsible for a substantial influx of nitrogen and phosphorus into the lake. Quantitatively, fifteen drains and several other sources have released a total of 156.62 tonnes (56.36 tonnes by drains alone) of phosphorus, and 241.18 tonnes of inorganic nitrogen into the lake from a discharge of 11.701 million cubic metres /year. Non-point sources, such as seepage and diffused runoff, also add to this pollution and have been recorded as further adding 4.5 tonnes of total phosphates and 18.14 tonnes of nitrogen (NO–N and NH–N) to the lake. Based on the values mentioned above, it has been inferred that the water quality of the lake has deteriorated.\nThe major environmental problem facing the lake is eutrophication, which has required immediate remedial measures to combat it. Alarmingly, the size of the lake has shrunk from its original area of to the present area of , and there is a concerning rate of sediment deposition due to catchment area degradation.\nThe water quality has also deteriorated due to intense pollution caused by the untreated sewage and solid waste that is fed into the lake from the peripheral areas and from the settlements and houseboats. Besides, some experts like Dr. A.A. Kazmi (Associate Professor, IIT Roorkee and in charge of the Environmental Engineering Lab) believe that deforestation in the catchment of Dal and Telbal stream may have led to more nitrogen and phosphorus-rich run-off, further aiding eutrophication. Encroachments of water channels and consequent clogging has diminished the circulation and inflows into the lake, so with the building up of phosphates and nitrogen, this has led to extensive weed growth and consequences on the biodiversity of the lake.\n\nIdentifying the above major issues as causes for the deterioration of the lake, a multidisciplinary team of experts have prepared a Detailed Project Report (DPR), which has the objective of achieving environment and sustainability, ecological improvement with minimum interventions and displacement and balancing the conflicts of interest. This plan is now under implementation with the financial assistance of the Government of India.\n\nThe serious nature of the environmental problems the lake has been experienced has been widely publicised and has been brought to the attention of the Supreme Court of India. Public Interest Litigations (PILs) have been filed in court demonstrating the environmental dangers posed to the lake by sewage, wastes and effluents. The PILs have sought injunctions of the court for setting up of an integrated ring sewage system encircling the Lake; release of funds by the Government of India to undertake measures to check pollution and to inaugurate a High Powered Committee to monitor proper utilisation of the allotted funds. The committee is under obligation to post feedback of progression developments from time to time, directly to the Supreme Court. The PIL, filed in 2001, has resulted in a number of directives from the court to the funding and implementing agencies and the case is continuing. Consequently, under the National Lake Conservation Plan of the Ministry of Environment and Forests of the Government of India, funds to the extent Rs 2987.6 million were sanctioned in September 2005 for the conservation of the lake. The restoration and rehabilitation measures envisaged under the \"Conservation and Management of Dal\" are under various stages of implementation with the funds allocated by the Government of India for the purpose. Some of the measures undertaken for rehabilitating the lake to bring it to its original eutrophication free status involved measures such as construction of siltation tanks, mechanical deweeding, regrouping of houseboats, deepening of outflow channel and removal of bunds and barricades, including some floating gardens. In addition, a moratorium has been imposed on new construction works close to the lakefront, including the building of new house boats. Resettlement plans for migrating the population from the lakefront have also evolved. The long-term development plans also deal with the reafforestation of catchment area to reduce erosion movement and movement of silt and to regulate grazing by livestock. Recent reports indicate that, as of 2010, 40% of the measures have been implemented.\n\nThe lake is popular as a visitor attraction and a summer resort. Fisheries and the harvesting of food and fodder plants are also important on Dal. Weeds from the lake are extracted and converted into compost for the gardens. It also serves as a flood lung of the Jhelum River. Swimming, boating, snow skiing (particularly when the lake is frozen during the severe winter), and canoeing are amongst some of the water sports activities practised on the lake.\n\nThe lake has numerous sites and places of interest, many of which are important to the cultural heritage of Srinagar. Aside from the Shalimar Bagh and Nishat Bagh, some of the other places frequented by tourists are the Shankaracharya temple, the Hari Parbat, the Nigeen Lake, the Chashme Shahi, the Hazratbal Shrine, and the Mazar-e-Shura cemetery containing the graves of famous Mughal-era poets. Visitors and native alike also enjoy relaxing on the water in a houseboat or a shikara boat, often called \"the Gondola of Kashmir\".\n\nA famous landmark in Srinagar is an island on Dal where four Chinar (\"Platanus orientalis\") trees stand, named \"Char Chinar\". Char in Hindi and Urdu means four.\n\nNigeen Lake, though sometimes referred to as a separate lake, is actually part of Dal, being linked through a causeway which permits only bikers and walkers to enter the lake precincts. The caseway carries the water supply pipeline to the Srinagar city in the east. The lake is bounded by the Shankaracharya hill (Takht-e-Suleiman) on the south and Hari Parbat on the west and is located at the foot of the Zabarwan hills. Willow and poplar trees flank the edges of the lake.\n\nChashme Shahi, meaning \"Royal Spring\", is a fresh water spring and garden known for its medicinal properties. Its source located above the Nehru Memorial Park. It is the smallest of all the Mughal gardens in Srinagar, measuring x and it has three terraces, an aqueduct, waterfalls and fountains. Ali Mardan Khan built the garden in 1632, and is built in such a way that the spring water is the source of fountains. From the fountains, water flows along the floor of the pavilion and cascades to a lower terrace over a drop of along a polished black stone chute. A small shrine, known as the Chasma Sahibi, is located in the vicinity of the gardens and has a fresh water spring.\n\nThe Shankaracharya Temple is also known as the Jyeshteshwara Temple. It is on top of the Shankaracharya Hill on the Zabarwan Range in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, India. It is dedicated to Lord Shiva. The temple is at a height of 1,000 feet (300 m) above the valley floor and overlooks the city of Srinagar.\n\nThe temple dates to 200 BC, although the present structure probably dates to the 9th century AD. It was visited by Adi Shankaraand has ever since been associated with him; this is how the temple got the name Shankaracharya. It is also regarded as sacred by Buddhists. Some historians report that the temple was actually a Buddhist temple during the Buddhist era which was then changed into Hindu site of worship by Adi Shankaracharya.\n\nHari Parbat, also known as the Mughal fort, is a hill fort on Sharika hill that provides panoramic views of the Srinagar city and the Dal. It was first established by Mughal Emperor Akbar in 1590. However, he only erected the outer wall of the fort and his plans to build a new capital called Naga Nagor within it did not materialise. The fort in its current state was built much later in 1808 under the reign of Shuja Shah Durrani. Within the fort's precincts are temples, Muslim shrines, and a Sikh Gurudwara. The hill is the subject of many legends in Hindu mythology, and was said to have once been a large sea, inhabited by a demon known as Jalobhava and that the hill grew from a pebble.\n\nThe Hazratbal Shrine (, literally: \"Majestic Place\"), also named Hazratbal, Assar-e-Sharief, or simply Dargah Sharif, is a Muslim shrine situated on the left bank of the Dal and is considered to be Kashmir's holiest Muslim shrine. It contains a relic believed by many Kashmiri Muslims to be the \"Moi-e-Muqqadas\", a hair from the head of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. According to legend, the relic was first brought to India by Syed Abdullah, a descendant of Muhammad who left Medina and settled in Bijapur, near Hyderabad in 1635. When Syed Abdullah died, his son, Syed Hamid, inherited the relic. Following the Mughal conquest of the region, Syed Hamid was stripped of his family estates. Finding himself unable to care for the relic, he gave it as the most precious gift to his close \"Mureed\" and a wealthy Kashmiri businessman, Khwaja Nur-ud-Din Ishbari.\n\nMazar-e-Shura (, ; transliteration: \"Mazār-i Shuʿārā\", translation: \"The Cemetery of Poets\") is a cemetery on a small hill by the main road in Dalgate, an area of Srinagar, Jammu & Kashmir in India. Founded in the reign of the Mughul emperor Akbar the Great, it was built in a scenic location on the banks of the Dal as a cemetery for eminent poets. Historical records show that there were at least five poets and men of letters buried in the cemetery: Shah Abu'l-Fatah, Haji Jan Muhammad Qudsi, Abu Talib Kalim Kashani, Muhammad Quli Salim Tehrani, and Tughra-yi Mashhadi, all natives of Iran who emigrated to India and were associated with the Mughal court. Due to neglect, only three tombstones are currently visible, one of which bears an inscription that is only partially legible.\n\nHouseboats and the Dal are widely associated with Srinagar and are nicknamed \"floating palaces\", built according to British customs. The houseboats are generally made from local cedar-wood and measure in length and in width and are graded in a similar fashion to hotels according to level of comfort. Many of them have lavishly furnished rooms, with verandas and a terrace to serve as a sun-deck or to serve evening cocktails. They are mainly moored along the western periphery of the lake, close to the lakeside boulevard in the vicinity of the Dal gate and on small islands in the lake. They are anchored individually, with interconnecting bridges providing access from one boat to the other. The kitchen-boat is annexed to the main houseboat, which also serves as residence of the boatkeeper and his family.\nEach houseboat has an exclusive shikara for ferrying guests to the shore. A shikara is small paddled taxi boat, often about long) and made of wood with a canopy and a spade shaped bottom. It is the cultural symbol of Kashmir and is used not only for ferrying visitors but is also used for the vending of fruits, vegetables and flowers and for the fishing and harvesting of aquatic vegetation. All gardens in the lake periphery and houseboats anchored in the lake are approachable through shikaras. The boats are often navigated by two boatmen dressed in \"Phiron\" (traditional dress) and carry 'Kangris' or portable heaters on the boat. A shikara can seat about six people and have heavily cushioned seats and backrests to provide comfort in Mughul style. All houseboat owners provide shikara transport to their house guests free of charge. The shikara is also used to provide for other sightseeing locations in the valley, notably a cruise along the Jhelum River, offering scenic views of the Pir Panjal mountains and passing through the famous seven bridges and the backwaters en route.\n\nDal lies in heart of the Srinagar city and is well connected by road and air links. The nearest airport, which connects with other major cities in the country, is about away at Badgam. The nearest railway station is Srinagar railway station which is from Dal Lake. The National Highway NH1A connects the Kashmir valley with rest of the country. Shikaras provide a water taxi service available to see the sights in the Dal and to approach the houseboats moored on the lake periphery.\n\n"}

The Reich was represented there by the German Residents: Gustav Denhardt (1856–1917; in office 8 April 1885 – 1 July 1890) and his deputy Clemens Andreas Denhardt (1852–1928). \nGerman rule was relatively mild, and the territory continued being a haven for escaped slaves. \n\nIn 1889, Wituland issued a number of postage stamps although their postal usage has not been verified.\n\nIn accord with the 1890 Heligoland–Zanzibar Treaty, on 18 June 1890 a British protectorate was declared, and on 1 July 1890 imperial Germany renounced its protectorate, ceding the Wituland to Great Britain to become part of British East Africa. There were widespread protests from the inhabitants of the territory, who wished to remain under Germany's protection.\n\nShortly afterwards several German merchants were murdered, and a mixed British & Zanzibari punitive expedition was sent out. The troops landed and descended on Witu on October 26, 1890. After a series of shoot-outs, Sultan \"Fumo Bakari ibn Ahmad\" fled from the town, with roughly 3,000 of his remaining gunmen. He was deposed by the British and died soon afterwards.\n\nAfter a short reign by \"Bwana Shaykh ibn Ahmad\", the rulership (now reduced to a shaykhdom and made a vassal of the Zanzibar Sultanate) was given to \"Fumo `Umar (or `Umari) ibn Ahamd\". Slavery was also formally abolished in Witu, in March 1891, and Indian police were brought in to enforce the new agreement.\n\nA brother of Fumo Bakari, by the name of Fumo Oman, resisted the new regime and began leading increasingly violent raids on villages and farms around the nearby town of Jongeni, northeast of Witu. A brief attempt at diplomacy failed, and the British and Zanzibari governments prepared a second naval expedition to sail to Witu.\n\nA small expeditionary force landed at Witu in July and a second request to negotiate was sent to Fumo Oman. It was rejected and the marines marched on the principal towns under rebel control. Thick forest and camouflaged pits with sharpened stakes surrounded the strongly fortified towns, and the rebel gunmen had prepared defensive positions that allowed for heavy fire. However, after prolonged and intense shoot-outs, the naval marines fought their way into each town, and destroyed the fortifications. Fumo Oman fled and Fumo 'Umari bin Hamid was reinstated.\n\nFumo 'Umari moved the capital to Jongeni, but the growth of British power and of the regional importance of Zanzibar saw Witu's position and independence gradually decline.\n\nIn 1905 oversight for Witu was moved from the Foreign Office to the Colonial Office. From then Witu was administrated as a part of Tana District of the Kenya Coast Protectorate. Since the 1923 death of Umari bin Hamid the question of Witu as an entity of its own was finally closed.\n\nThe known ruling Sultans (styled \"mfalume\" in Swahili) are: \n\n"}

It feeds almost exclusively on fish and frequents streams, rivers and larger bodies of water.\n\nThe half-collared kingfisher was described by the English ornithologist William John Swainson in 1823 and given its current binomial name \"Alcedo semitorquata\". The word \"Alcedo\" is the Latin for a \"kingfisher\". The specific epithet \"semitorquata\" is from the Latin \"semi-\" for \"half\" or \"small\" and \"torquatus\" for \"collared\".

Little, written by Alan B. McElroy, and starring Donald Pleasence, Ellie Cornell, and Danielle Harris. The fourth installment in the \"Halloween\" franchise, it follows Michael Myers returning to Haddonfield to kill his niece Jamie Lloyd, the daughter of Laurie Strode, with his former psychiatrist Dr. Sam Loomis again pursuing him.\n\nAs its title suggests, the film marks the return of Michael Myers after his absence in the , however, despite being the fourth film of the series, it is a direct sequel to the second installment due to the previous installment taking place on a completely different storyline. Initially, John Carpenter and co-producer Debra Hill intended to create an anthology series, of which \"Halloween III\" would be the first. \"Halloween 4\" was originally intended to be a ghost story but, due to the disappointing reception of \"Halloween III\", it reintroduced Michael Myers, and he has remained the main antagonist of the series since.\n\nReleased in the United States on October 21, 1988, \"Halloween 4\" grossed $17.8 million domestically on a budget of $5 million, and received mostly negative reviews from critics. However, the film, much like the series in general, has obtained a strong cult following since its release. A direct sequel, \"\", was released one year later.\n\nOn October 30, 1988, nearly ten years after his escape from Smith's Grove Sanitarium and initial massacre in his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois, Michael Myers, having survived the explosion at Haddonfield Memorial Hospital albeit severely burned and left in a coma since that night, is being transferred from Ridgemont Federal Sanitarium back to Smith's Grove in an ambulance. Along the way, two of the paramedics escorting Michael begin to discuss his living relatives and one notes that the only family member he has left is a niece living in Haddonfield. Upon hearing this Michael comes out of his coma, kills all four occupants of the ambulance before escaping and begins to make his way back to Haddonfield.\n\nJamie Lloyd, Michael's niece, and the daughter of Laurie Strode, who was killed nearly a year prior along with Jamie's father in a car crash, has been adopted by the Carruthers family including Richard, Darlene, and their daughter Rachel. At the same time of Michael's escape Jamie, who is having trouble sleeping, begins having a hallucination of the ambulance he is being driven in. After being comforted by Rachel she returns to her room where she privately grieves over the loss of her mother and is then attacked by Michael though this turns out to be a vivid nightmare she is having.\n\nOn Halloween, Dr. Samuel Loomis, Michael's psychiatrist, who also survived the explosion but was left badly burned and scarred over most of his body, learns of Michael's escape and, after seeing firsthand the remains of the ambulance and its occupants, immediately leaves to find him. He arrives at a gas station in the middle of nowhere minutes after Michael, who had arrived before him, has killed a mechanic, taking his coveralls, and a waitress. Loomis sees Michael and pleads with him not to go to Haddonfield. Knowing that his pleas are falling on deaf ears, Loomis shoots at Michael who manages to avoid being shot and makes his way back into the garage where he steals a tow truck. He hits a gas pump that causes the entire station to explode, destroying Loomis' car provided by Ridgemont, and burning the phone lines. Loomis barely survives and continues towards Haddonfield on foot.\n\nMeanwhile, Rachel's mother and father ask her to take Jamie out trick or treating that night. She gets into an argument with them because she has a date with her boyfriend, Brady, which upsets Jamie who overhears the conversation though the two reconcile shortly thereafter when Rachel promises to take Jamie for ice cream later that day.\n\nAt school Jamie is tormented by her classmates about her mother being dead and her relation to Michael Myers. Rachel and her friend, Lindsay, pick Jamie up after school and take her to the drugstore where Brady and Kelly Meeker, the sheriff's daughter, work. While Rachel and Brady argue over the fact that they cannot go out that night, Jamie wanders the aisles and finds a clown costume similar to the one her uncle wore the night he killed his sister Judith. Unbeknownst to anyone, Michael is also in the store as well and steals a mask. While Jamie is about to try on her costume she has another hallucination of Michael as a young boy while looking in the mirror. The real Michael then appears and goes to grab her. She screams and backs into the mirror which alerts Rachel and the others. They find Jamie unharmed and help her back to the front while Michael slips away unnoticed.\n\nLoomis continues walking towards Haddonfield when he is picked up by Reverend Jackson P. Sayer, a preacher who claims to be hunting evil and Armageddon, who gives him a ride. After arriving in town, Loomis goes to the police station looking for Sheriff Brackett, but is told that he retired in 1981 and moved to Florida. The new sheriff, Ben Meeker, Kelly's father, is initially hesitant to believe that Michael has returned to Haddonfield but decides to take the warnings seriously. The two leave to go find Jamie who Loomis believes is Michael's intended target.\n\nAfter Rachel and Jamie leave to go trick or treating, Michael enters the Carruthers house and finds Jamie's shoe box filled with pictures of himself as a child as well as his sister Laurie confirming that Jamie is indeed his niece.\n\nDuring their visits to one of the houses in the neighborhood with a group of children, Kelly answers the door and Rachel sees Brady coming down the stairs. She tries to leave but he catches up to her and tries to explain why he is there. While they are arguing again, Jamie continues trick or treating with the other children and becomes separated from Rachel. Loomis and Meeker arrive at the Carruthers house and find evidence of Michael's presence including the family dog Sundae dead in Jamie's closet, another of Michael's victims and confirming Loomis' worst fears to Meeker. While all of this is going on, Michael arrives at the electrical substation and kills an electrician named Bucky by throwing him into the transformers which causes a blackout in the entire town.\n\nWhile searching for Jamie, Rachel has an encounter with Michael and flees as he approaches her. She eventually finds her before they are then found and taken away by Loomis and Meeker in Meeker's patrol car. They return to the station to find that Michael has already been there as well and has killed most of the officers. A lynch mob is formed by the leader of the town's truckers and owner of a local bar, Earl, after they arrive and are informed by Loomis that Michael has returned home to kill again. Meeker is initially furious at him for inciting the men but relents when he realizes that with most of his department dead they are the only line of defense that the town now has. Deputy Logan, the only other surviving officer, who had been waiting at the Carruthers house and heard about the massacre at the station, is radioed by Meeker to meet at his house where they are taking Rachel and Jamie to protect them. He leaves but is unaware that Michael is in the backseat of his squad car.\n\nMeeker, Loomis, Rachel, and Jamie arrive at Meeker's house where Kelly and Brady are barely able to cover up their attempt to have sex. The group decide to barricade all the windows and doors aside from the main entrance. Loomis leaves shortly thereafter to look for Michael. Meeker then leaves as well following a radio message indicating that the truckers have accidentally killed a man, mistaking him for Myers, leaving Deputy Logan as the group's only protection. Unbeknownst to any of them, Michael is already in the house. Kelly, who was preparing coffee, mistakes Michael for the deputy, who has already been killed. When she discovers this he gets up and uses Logan's shotgun to impale her through a door before disappearing into the house again.\n\nRachel, who was in the basement waiting for a message from the state police about their arrival time, heads upstairs to inform the deputy only to discover his and Kelly's corpses. Rachel also finds that Jamie is missing before running into Brady who insists that Jamie is dead and that they must escape before they are killed too. The front door is locked with a deadbolt and Brady attempts to shoot the lock out only to discover that the door is made of metal which means without the key they are trapped. Jamie emerges from hiding as does Michael. Brady tells Rachel and Jamie to run to the attic while he tries to hold Michael off. He reloads his gun too late and fires but misses Michael. He then tries using it as a melee weapon to no avail and is easily disarmed. His last attempt to fight ends with Michael breaking Brady's hand before lifting him off the ground by his neck which is then crushed in his grasp.\n\nThe girls escape the attic through a window onto the roof, and Jamie is lowered down safely, but Michael attacks Rachel and knocks her off the roof. Jamie tries to wake Rachel up, refusing to believe that she is dead from the fall, but is forced to leave her behind. She encounters Loomis down the street and they take shelter in Jamie's school. Michael appears and throws Loomis through a classroom door before continuing his pursuit of Jamie who falls down a flight of steps near the exit. Before Michael can kill her Rachel appears, having survived the fall, and sprays Michael with an extinguisher which blinds him long enough for the two to escape. They are met outside by the truckers where Earl at first wants to enter the school to kill Myers but is convinced the best thing to do is leave.\n\nThe truck carrying Rachel and Jamie drive out of Haddonfield for the next town over to meet with the Illinois State Police. A lone trooper stops and gives them directions to a nearby station. As they continue driving Michael climbs into the bed of the truck, having been underneath it the entire time. He kills all three men in the back before smashing his hand through the drivers window and ripping Earl's face and neck open from the roof. Rachel takes the wheel after getting Earl's body out of the truck and does her best to keep Michael from getting to Jamie. She stops short causing Michael to fall from the truck and then hits him, sending him flying into a ditch. Loomis and Meeker then arrives with the rest of the truckers and the state police. Meanwhile, Jamie has gotten out of the truck and approaches Michael, touching his hand before being beckoned away by Meeker and Rachel. Michael is still alive and gets back up, only to be greeted by a hail of gunfire which culminates with him falling down an abandoned mine-shaft to his apparent death.\n\nFollowing the nights events, Loomis and Meeker take both girls home where they are met and consoled by Richard and Darlene. Meeker asks if it is over to which Loomis assures him it is and that Michael is buried in hell where he belongs. Darlene takes Jamie upstairs and runs her a bath. Jamie dons her clown mask and approaches her step-mother from behind; a scream is heard from upstairs. Loomis rushes to the staircase and is horrified to see that Jamie is standing top the landing holding a pair of bloody scissors, having stabbed Darlene. Loomis attempts to shoot her but is disarmed by Meeker who, along with Rachel and Richard, look upon Jamie in horror. Loomis continues to cry hysterically as Jamie again holds the scissors up, having become possessed by the same evil as Michael.\n\nAfter \"\", executive producer Moustapha Akkad wanted to move further with the series, and bring back Michael Myers. Producer Paul Freeman, a friend of Akkad with a long list of credits to his name, explained to \"Fangoria\" magazine in 1988 that everybody came out of \"Halloween III\" saying, \"Where's Michael?\" John Carpenter was approached by Cannon Films, who had just finished 1986's release of \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2\", to write and direct \"Halloween 4\". Debra Hill planned to produce the film, while Carpenter teamed up with Dennis Etchison who, under the pseudonym Jack Martin, had written novelizations of both \"Halloween II\" (1981) and \"Halloween III: Season of the Witch\" (1982) to write a script to \"Halloween 4\". Originally, Joe Dante was Carpenter's choice in mind of director for the project.\n\nHowever, Akkad rejected the Etchison script, calling it \"too cerebral\" and insisting that any new \"Halloween\" sequel must feature Myers as a flesh and blood killer. In an interview, Etchison explained how he received the phone call informing him of the rejection of his script. Etchison said, \"I received a call from Debra Hill and she said, 'Dennis, I just wanted you to know that John and I have sold our interest in the title 'Halloween' and unfortunately, your script was not part of the deal.\"\n\nCarpenter and Hill had signed all of their rights away to Akkad, who gained ownership. Akkad said, \"I just went back to the basics of \"Halloween\" on \"Halloween 4\" and it was the most \nsuccessful.\" As Carpenter refused to continue his involvement with the series, a new director was sought out. Dwight H. Little, a native of Ohio, replaced Carpenter. Little had previously directed episodes for \"Freddy's Nightmares\" and the film \"Bloodstone\".\n\nThe ending of \"Halloween II\" is retconned in the film and both Michael and Loomis would return for the film.\n\nOn February 25, 1988, writer Alan B. McElroy, a Cleveland, Ohio native, was brought in to the write the script for \"Halloween 4\". The writer's strike was to begin on March 7 that year. This forced McElroy to develop a concept, pitch the story, and send in the final draft in under eleven days. McElroy came up with the idea of Brittany \"Britti\" Lloyd, Laurie Strode's daughter, to be chased by her uncle, who has escaped from Ridgemont after being in a coma for ten years. Dr. Samuel Loomis goes looking for Michael with Sheriff Meeker. The setting of the place was once again Haddonfield, Illinois. The character of Laurie Strode was revealed to have died in a car accident, leaving Britti with the Carruthers family, which included Rachel, the family's seventeen-year-old daughter. Britti's name was later changed to Jamie, a homage to Laurie Strode actress Jamie Lee Curtis.\n\nMcElroy told \"Fangoria\":\nIn the original draft, Sheriff Ben Meeker was to be killed during the Shape's attack on the Meeker house. A fire would have started in the basement and burnt down the entire house. The scene on top of the roof with the Shape, Rachel, and Jamie was supposed to be engulfed in flames. This idea was scrapped due to budget issues. Instead, a more \"soap opera\" feel was incorporated , which included a love triangle subplot between Rachel, Brady, and Kelly Meeker, the sheriff's daughter.\n\nDirector Dwight H. Little stated in 2006 that his interpretation of McElroy's screenplay had the Michael Myers character played as a literal escaped mental patient, not a supernatural figure. Little approached the screenplay as though Myers was pursuing Jamie as a means of \"connecting with her,\" but that he had no social capacity to interact with her, and thus resorted to violence. The screenplay references the events of \"Halloween II\" (1981), in which a fire breaks out in Haddonfield Hospital, by having both Myers and Loomis display burn scars on their respective hands and faces.\n\nThe cast of \"Halloween 4\" included only one actor from the first two films, Donald Pleasence, who reprised his role as Samuel Loomis, Michael Myers' psychiatrist. According to Little, Pleasance was \"committed conceptually\" to the role, but did not sign on to the project until having read a finished screenplay. Before McElroy's script was chosen, the producers asked Jamie Lee Curtis to reprise her role as Laurie Strode, the original's heroine. Curtis had become a success in the film industry and had established a career with her roles in films like \"Trading Places\" (1983) and \"A Fish Called Wanda\" (1988). Curtis declined and did not want to continue her participation in the film, although she did return for the . As a result, her character was written out and died in a car accident, which is briefly explained in the film.\n\nThe script introduced Laurie Strode's seven-year-old daughter, Jamie Lloyd. Melissa Joan Hart had auditioned for the role, among various other girls. Up against her was Danielle Harris, who had previously starred in \"One Life to Live\" as Samantha Garretson; Harris was ultimately cast in the role after auditioning in New York. Rebecca Schaeffer had auditioned for the role of Rachel Carruthers, but had to drop out due to scheduling conflicts. Twenty-three-year-old Ellie Cornell had also auditioned. Cornell had chosen to audition for \"Halloween 4\" and \"\" (1988) as the role of Kristen Parker, after Patricia Arquette had declined to return as Kristen. Cornell chose \"Halloween 4\" and successfully landed the role of Rachel. Beau Starr was cast as the new Sheriff, Ben Meeker, replacing Sheriff Lee Brackett (Charles Cyphers), and Kathleen Kinmont was cast as the Sheriff's daughter, Kelly. George P. Wilbur was cast to play Michael Myers.\n\nPrincipal photography began on April 11, 1988. Instead of filming in Pasadena, California (the original filming location and stand in for Haddonfield) due to high-rising costs, filming took place in and around Salt Lake City, Utah. As filming was taking place in March, during springtime, the producers were forced to import leaves and big squash, which they would use to create pumpkins by painting them orange. \"One of the obvious challenges in making a part four of anything is to interest a contemporary audience in old characters and themes,\" said director Dwight H. Little. \"What I'm trying to do is capture the mood of the original \"Halloween\" and yet take a lot of new chances. What we're attempting to do is walk a fine line between horror and mystery. \"Halloween 4\" will not be an ax-in-the-forehead kind of movie.\" Paul Freeman agreed. \"This film does contain some humorous moments, but it's not of the spoof or send-up variety. It's humor that rises out of the film's situations and quickly turns back into terror.\"\n\nGeorge P. Wilbur, who was cast as Michael Myers, wore hockey pads under the costume to make himself look more physically imposing, and he was often filmed in mirror reflections or off-center so that the audience could witness him \"in pieces\" rather than have an encompassing view. During filming, the cast and crew made it a point to take it easy on Danielle Harris, as she was only a young child at the time, and made sure that she was not scared too badly and knew that none of it was real; to this end, Wilbur regularly removed the mask in front of her in order to remind her that it was just a movie and he was not going to hurt her.\n\nThe late night scenes caused issues with the cast. Garlan Wilde, a gaffer for the film, was injured during the scene between Brady and the Shape when he dropped a light and accidentally slit his wrists. He was rushed to the hospital. In addition, while filming the rooftop scene, Ellie Cornell cut her stomach open on a large nail while sliding down the roof, though she continued filming the scene despite losing a sizable amount of blood. During most of the night scenes, Donald Pleasence became so cold that he wore a hat for most of the scenes, unbeknownst to the crew. This caused over six hours of footage to be re-shot. The shoot lasted about 41 days and Ellie Cornell and Danielle Harris were required to be on set for 36 of those days.\n\nDuring filming, it was considered that the customized 1975 Captain Kirk mask be reused for this film. However, the mask was long gone and a new one was purchased from a local costume shop. The producers wanted to test and see what it would look like without the edits. The school scene was filmed and when reviewing the producers did not like how the mask turned out. It was allegedly customized again but did not live up to the original, and the producers felt it was too old and went for a new mask. Some scenes had to be re-shot with the new mask. The only scene left in is when Loomis is thrown through a glass door; as Michael comes up behind him, the unaltered face and blonde hair is visible.\n\nAfter viewing the film's rough cut, director Dwight H. Little and producer Moustapha Akkad decided that the film's violence was too soft, and so an extra day of \"blood filming\" commenced. Special effects make-up artist John Carl Buechler (director of \"\") was brought in to create the thumb in the forehead kill and neck-twisting of the redneck seen in the film's final cut.\n\nThe score was performed by Alan Howarth, who had assisted John Carpenter on \"Halloween II\" and \"Halloween III\". Howarth gained approval from Dwight H. Little before he could accept the offer, creating a new score that referenced the original's but with a synthesizer twist. Howarth also included new tracks such as \"Jamie's Nightmare\", \"Return of the Shape\", and \"Police Station\". The soundtrack was released to Compact Disc on September 28, 1988.\n\n\"Halloween 4\" opened in 1,679 theaters on October 21, 1988 and grossed $6,831,250 in its opening weekend, ranking number one at the box office. It held the top spot in its second weekend, and achieved a total domestic gross of $17,768,757 in the United States, becoming the sixth best performing film in the \"Halloween\" series.\n\nThe film received negative critical reception. It currently has a 29% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 28 reviews, with an average rating of 3.89 out of 10. The site's critics consensus reads, \"\"Halloween 4: The Return Of Michaels Myers\" may bring the series' masked killer back into the fold, but fails to offer the visceral scares and inventiveness of the original.\" On Metacritic it has a score of 34 out of 100 based on reviews from 10 critics, which indicates \"generally unfavorable reviews\".\n\nCaryn James of \"The New York Times\" criticized the film for abandoning the original film's strengths saying \"suspense and psychological horror have given way to superhuman strength and resilience.\" \"Variety\" found the film to be \"a no-frills, workmanlike picture.\" Richard Harrington of \"The Washington Post\" declared the film \"very much the cheap knockoff of its prototype, but not half as visceral.\" Kim Newman for \"Empire\" said \"It's incredible that a film could be so closely patterned on Carpenter's still-thrilling original movie and yet be so stupid, unscary and plodding as \"Halloween 4\" is.\"\n\nTime has been relatively kind to the film with many modern reviews being more positive. \"JoBlo.com\" said, \"The movie is tight, has good murders and a kicked my butt ending. The Shape is back and in good form; this is my favorite \"Halloween\" next to the first one.\" \"IGN\" declared \"\"Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers\" stands out as the second best film in the entire series.\" \"Dread Central\" said, \"\"Halloween 4\" is a strong sequel, horror film and \"Halloween\" movie.\" \"DVD Talk\" said \"Despite its flaws, \"Halloween 4\" is one of the best slashers from the late 1980s, standing out in an era when the subgenre was in steep decline.\"\n\nThe film was first released on VHS in May 1989 as a rental title by CBS/FOX home entertainment. It was made available for sell-through in October 1989 to coincide with the theatrical release of \"\". In 2006, Anchor Bay Entertainment released special editions of this film and its sequel for DVD. Supplements include the \"Halloween 4\"/\"5\" panel at the Return to Haddonfield convention, theatrical trailer, \"Halloween 4\" Final Cut – a \"behind-the-scenes\" documentary, a commentary with Danielle Harris and Ellie Cornell, and another commentary by Alan B.

The film was released on Blu-ray in Germany on May 4, 2012, in the US on August 21, 2012.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Halloween 4\" was originally released on VHS format, where distribution rights were initially held by Braveworld in the early 1990s, and then, Legend distribution. On June 17, 2002, Digital Entertainment released the film on VHS, while a second version from the company containing a \"Widescreen Presentation\" on September 5, 2002. Anchor Bay Entertainment released the film for the first time on DVD in \"Special Edition\" on January 28, 2002, while Digital Entertainment did release the film to DVD several months later on September 5, 2002 to coincide with their newest VHS release, and an additional release via distribution company, Hollywood on October 27, 2003, which also released a set containing Ulli Lommel's \"The Boogeyman\" and \"Boogeyman II\", and \"Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers\", and another set containing the film alongside Mario Bava's \"A Bay of Blood\". After which, Anchor Bay acquired rights to all subsequent home video releases, and again released \"Halloween 4\" with the 1986 film \"House\" in a \"Double Disc Box Set\" on February 6, 2006. A re-issued DVD was made available once again courtesy of Anchor Bay on October 11, 2010 which features the theatrical trailer and the featurette, \"Inside Halloween 4\". Anchor Bay released the film as part of a DVD set, \"Halloween Collection\" on October 15, 2012, which contained the first five \"Halloween\" films. \"Halloween 4\" was released on Blu-ray on October 15, 2012, which contains new Dolby TrueHD 5.1 audio and special features consisting of audio commentary with actors Ellie Cornell and Danielle Harris, audio commentary with director Dwight H.

The novel closely follows the film's events, with a few alterations. In 2003, the novel was re-issued with new material and cover art, titled \"Halloween IV: The Special Limited Edition\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2002268", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2002268", "title": "Alexander Jackson Davis", "text": "Alexander Jackson Davis\n\nAlexander Jackson Davis, or A. J. Davis (July 24, 1803 – January 14, 1892), was an American architect, known particularly for his association with the Gothic Revival style.\n\nDavis was born in New York City and studied at the American Academy of Fine Arts, the New-York Drawing Association, and from the Antique casts of the National Academy of Design. Dropping out of school, he became a respectable lithographer and from 1826 he worked as a draftsman for Josiah R. Brady, a New York architect who was an early exponent of the Gothic revival style: Brady's Gothic 1824 St. Luke's Episcopal Church is the oldest surviving structure in Rochester, New York.\n\nDavis made a first independent career as an architectural illustrator in the 1820s, but his friends, especially painter John Trumbull, convinced him to turn his hand to designing buildings. Picturesque siting, massing and contrasts remained essential to his work, even when he was building in a Classical style. In 1826, Davis went to work in the office of Ithiel Town and Martin E. Thompson, the most prestigious architectural firm of the Greek Revival; in the office Davis had access to the best architectural library in the country, in a congenial atmosphere where he gained a thorough grounding.\n\nFrom 1829, in partnership with Town, Davis formed the first recognizably modern architectural office and designed many late Classical buildings, including some of public prominence. In Washington, Davis designed the Executive Department offices and with Robert Mills the first Patent Office building (1834–36). He also designed the Custom House of New York City (1833–42). Bridgeport City Hall, constructed in 1853 and 1854, is a later government building Davis designed in the Classical style.\n\nA series of consultations over state capitols followed, none apparently built entirely as Davis planned: the Indiana State House, Indianapolis (1831 – 35), elicited calls for his advice and designs in building other state capitols in the 1830s: North Carolina's (1833 – 40, with local architect David Paton), the Illinois State Capitol, often attributed entirely to the Springfield, Illinois architect John F. Rague, who was at work on the Iowa State Capitol at the same time, and in 1839, the committee responsible for commissioning a design for the Ohio Statehouse asked his advice. The resulting capitol in Columbus, Ohio, often attributed to the Hudson River School painter Thomas Cole consulting with Davis and Ithiel Town, has a stark Greek Doric order colonnade across a recessed entrance, flanked by recessed window bays that continue the rhythm of the central portico, all under a unique drum capped by a low saucer dome. With Town's partner James Dakin, he designed the noble colossal Corinthian order of the Greek Revival \"Colonnade Row\" on New York's Lafayette Street, the very first apartments designed for the prosperous American middle class (1833, half still standing). He continued in partnership with Town until shortly before Town's death in 1844.\n\nIn 1831, he was elected an associate member of the National Academy. From 1835, Davis began work on his own on \"Rural Residences\", his only publication, the first pattern book for picturesque residences in a domesticated Gothic Revival taste, which could be executed in carpentry, and also containing the first of the Italianate style \"Tuscan\" villas, flat-roofed with wide overhanging eaves and picturesque corner towers. Unfortunately the Panic of 1837 cut short his plans for a series of like volumes, but Davis soon formed a partnership with Andrew Jackson Downing, illustrating his widely read books. Additions to Vesper Cliff were built in 1834.\nThe 1840s and 1850s were Davis's two most fruitful decades as a designer of country houses. His villa \"Lyndhurst\" at Tarrytown, New York, is his single most famous house. Many of his villas were built in the scenic Hudson River Valley— where his style informed the vernacular \"Hudson River Bracketed\" that gave Edith Wharton a title for a novel —but Davis sent plans and specifications to clients as far afield as Indiana. He designed Blandwood, the 1846 home of Governor John Motley Morehead that stands as America's earliest Italianate Tuscan Villa. Innovative interior features, including his designs for mantels and sideboards, were also widely imitated in the trade. Other influential interior details include pocket shutters at windows, bay windows, and mirrored surfaces to reflect natural light. The Greek Revival style William Walsh House was built at Albany, New York, and Gothic Revival style Belmead was built near Powhatan, Virginia, in 1845.\n\nTwo smaller but well known structures designed by Davis include one built for John Cox Stevens in 1845; Stevens was the first Commodore of New York Yacht Club and the small Carpenter Gothic building on his property near Hoboken was given to NYYC to be used as its first clubhouse. This building, fondly called \"Station 10\", still exists and can be found in Newport. Davis built a similar pavilion for his colleague and fellow NYYC founder, John Clarkson Jay, on Jay's Long Island Sound waterfront property in Rye, New York, in 1849. Although this building was taken down in the 1950s, the original setting and garden where it was once located is part of a National Historic Landmark site and open to the public.\n\nInspired in part by friend Andrew Jackson Downing, Davis constructed several Gothic Revival cottage-style homes in Central New York, including the 1852-completed Reuel E. Smith House, which is included in the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nIn 1851, Davis completed Winyah Park, one of approximately eighteen or more Italianate houses he designed in the 1850s. Winyah was built for Richard Lathers, who had studied architecture with Davis in New York in the 1830s. It was situated on Lathers's estate in the town of New Rochelle in Westchester County, New York. For this design Davis won the first architectural prize at the New York World's Fair of 1853–54. He used its most striking feature, two adjacent yet contrasting towers, in a much larger house named Grace Hill, built in Brooklyn between 1853 and 1854. In both Winyah and Grace Hill, broad octagonal towers serve as visual anchors for the taller square towers. Lathers later employed Davis to design four additional \"investment houses\" on his property which became known as \"Lathers's Hill\". The homes included two Gothic cottages and \"Tudor Villa\" constructed in 1858, and \"Pointed Villa\" constructed in 1859. In 1890, the artist Frederic Remington purchased one of these cottages from which he created his estate \"Endion\", which served as the studio for most of his artistic career. The success of \"Winyah Park\" and \"Lathers's Hill\" generated other important commissions for Davis in New Rochelle, including two cottage-villas, Wildcliff and Sans Souci, which he designed for members of a prominent Davenport family. Both homes feature Davis's signature central gable. Another extant Gothic Revival commission is Whitby Castle, designed in 1852 for Davis' lifelong friend William Chapman. The building is part of the Boston Post Road Historic District (Rye, New York) and retains many original features.\n\nDavis was invited to become a member of the American Institute of Architects shortly after its founding in 1857. In the late 1850s, Davis worked with the entrepreneur Llewellyn S. Haskell to create Llewellyn Park in West Orange, New Jersey, a garden suburb that was one of the first planned residential communities in the United States.\n\nDavis designed buildings for the University of Michigan in 1838, and in the 1840s he designed buildings for the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.\n\nAt Virginia Military Institute, Jackson's designs from 1848 through the 1850s created the first entirely Gothic revival college campus, built in brick and stuccoed to imitate stone. Davis's plan for the Barracks quadrangle was interrupted by the Civil War; it was sympathetically completed to designs of Bertram Goodhue in the early 20th century.\nHe married Margaret Beale in 1853 and had two children.\n\nWith the onset of Civil War in 1861, patronage in house building dried up, and after the war, new styles unsympathetic to Davis's nature were in vogue. In 1867, he designed the Hurst-Pierrepont Estate. In 1878, Davis closed his office. He built little in the last thirty years of his life, but spent his easy retirement in West Orange drawing plans for grandiose schemes that he never expected to build, and selecting and ordering his designs and papers, by which he determined to be remembered. They are shared by four New York institutions: the Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library at Columbia University, the New York Public Library, the New-York Historical Society, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. A further collection of Davis material has been assembled at the Henry Francis DuPont Winterthur Museum library. Davis is interred in Bloomfield Cemetery in Bloomfield, New Jersey.\n\n\n"}

The facility soon established itself as one of the premiere race tracks in eastern Canada.\n\nThe track is an oval dirt surface standardbred race course. Its original judge's stand built in 1889 still stands on the inner field, having been restored in 1999. The starting gate, dating to 1948 and the first of its kind in Canada, was also restored to operational use in 1999.\n\nDuring the third week of August, the CDP hosts \"Old Home Week\", Prince Edward Island's annual provincial agricultural exhibition running 15 racing programs over 9 days. A newer tradition since 1960, \"Old Home Week\" culminates in the running of the \"Gold Cup and Saucer\" finale at the end of the exhibition - a race which has drawn celebrities and royalty and locals alike.\n\nThe CDP grandstand originally housed a restaurant and enclosed and open viewing areas for both winter and temperate season racing.\n\nIn 1990, the adjacent Charlottetown Civic Centre was built onto the CDP complex. A fire in the early 1990s among the wood-constructed horse stables led to the building of many new concrete stables, although urban development pressures around the CDP site may lead to horse owners being forced to practice their animals at another site on the outskirts of Charlottetown, leaving the CDP as primarily a race facility.\n\nThe roof of the CDP grandstand was heavily damaged by Hurricane Juan on September 29, 2003. This development is believed to have spurred the CDP's redevelopment by the provincial government into a so-called racino.\n\nFaced with declining revenues for race betting, the provincial government looked at options for redeveloping the CDP. Following damage to the facility by Hurricane Juan, the government entered into an agreement with the Atlantic Lottery Corporation and have been redeveloping the CDP with an improved track, lighting and a gaming facility containing Electronic Gaming Devices (EGD); such facilities are commonly termed racinos.\n\nThe gaming area is referred to as an Entertainment Centre, the name of the entire facility was referred to as the Charlottetown Driving Park Entertainment Centre (CDPEC) but in mid 2009 the names of the Charlottetown and Summerside facilities were rebranded as Red Shores Racetrack and Casino. The gaming floor in Charlottetown has 208 slot machines; including 40 stand-alone progressive slots, four linked progressives, a self-serve simulcast betting area and five Texas Hold 'Em Poker tables featuring a Royal Flush Progressive Jackpot and two blackjack tables. Summerside has 40 slot machines and two Texas Hold 'Em poker tables.\n\nThe CDPEC held the two biggest outdoor concerts ever on PEI. In 2006, hosting the Black Eyed Peas, Pussycat Dolls and others. Aerosmith and Cheap Trick, among others, then played the venue in the summer of 2007.\n\nToday Red Shores racetrack and Casino calls itself \"Atlantic Canada's Fastest Racetrack\" and is the centerpiece of Prince Edward Island's harness racing industry.\n\n"}

Their name comes from the cardamom spice grown in much of the hills' cool elevation, which also supports pepper and coffee. The Western Ghats and Periyar Sub-Cluster including the Cardamom Hills, are UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\n\nThe Cardamom Hills central point is about . They cover about 2,800 km of mountainous terrain with deep valleys, and includes the drainages of the west flowing Periyar, Mullayar and Pamba rivers. It includes Idukki Dam and Mullaperiyar Dam. They conjoin the Anaimalai Hills to the northwest, the Palani Hills to the northeast and the Pothigai to the south as far as the Aryankavu pass (at c. 9° N). The crest of the hills form the boundary between Kerala and Tamil Nadu.

On the western side, two-thirds of the precipitation is received during the southwest monsoon from June to September. The areas also receive rainfall from the northeast monsoon (October–December) and from pre-monsoon showers (April–May).\n\nThese hills are made up largely of several contiguous protected areas intended to restrict human access, protect specific endangered species and preserve some of the still undeveloped forest biomes. The central part of the hills comprise the Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary covering an area of 777 km. The 350 km core zone of the sanctuary is the Periyar National Park and Tiger Reserve. Periyar is a major ecotourism destination.\n\nTo the south of the Periyar Tiger Reserve are the reserve forests of the Ranni, Konni and Achankovil Forest Divisions. The Srivilliputtur Wildlife Sanctuary and reserved forests of the Tirunelveli Forest Division are contiguous with Periyar on the eastern side of the hills in Tamil Nadu in the rain-shadow area with mostly drier forests. The Meghamalai reserve forest, also contiguous with Periyar, is proposed to be the 600 km Meghamalai Wildlife Sanctuary to protect several threatened species including: Bengal tiger, Indian elephant, Nilgiri tahr, lion-tailed macaque, slender loris, grizzled giant squirrel, Salim Ali's fruit bat, great Indian hornbill, Hutton's pitviper and Vindhyan bob butterfly.\n\nThe Cardamom Hill was an administrative area under two revenue officers (Tahasildar) created by the royal proclamation of Kingdom of Travancore in April 1822 to promote cardamom cultivation and to give facilities and protection to cardamom farmers. The Cardamom Hill Reserve (CHR) is within the Cardamom Hills Idukki District. It comprises about as per 1897 royal proclamation of the Kingdom of Travancore. But the extent of land in accordance with the boundaries of the notification is about 334 Sq miles (2,13,720 acres). It is bordered by the Tamil Nadu border to the east, Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary on the south, the Periyar River on the west, and Bodimettu, Chokkanad and Muthirapuzha to the north. The rain forests of CHR are a natural wildlife corridor to Periyar National Park from the Anaimalai Hills and Palani hills of Tamil Nadu and is the catchment area of six major hydro-electric projects in Idukki District. Now it is situated in the Idukki District of Kerala.\n\nAccording to the Chief Secretary of the Government of Kerala, Cardamom Hill land is Government land under the control of the Revenue Department for more than a century. The total extent of the Cardamom Hill area was 1071.9746 km (264,885 acres) of which 568.6 km (140,500 acres) was assigned under various Land Assignment Rules. The balance of \n503.38 km (124,386 acres) is leased to farmers for cardamom cultivation The CHR accounts for about 70 percent of the cardamom production of India. CHR contains the Cardamom Research Station, situated in the Pampadumpara village of Udumbanchola taluk. It is located on the eastern side of Kumily-Munnar road. See:map.\n\nCHR is the centre of a controversy between the Forest Department and the Revenue Department over control of the cardamom plantations in the reserve. Non-cardamom cultivation, illegal land conversion and large scale destruction of trees in the CHR have been blamed for flash-floods and landslips in Idukki and siltation problems in the Idukki dam.\n\nAccording to the report dated 7 September 2005 of the Central Empowered Committee, appointed by the Supreme Court of India, the status of the Cardamom Hill Reserve is forest, and the extent is about 334 sq miles. The CEC concludes that in the Cardamom Hill Reserve, which still holds dense forest, illegal assignment of lands or grant of patta, illegal sales of land, large scale encroachments, transfer and sale of land and consequent deforestation, by the rich, the powerful and the influential, continue unabated in gross violation of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 and this Honourable Court’s order dated 12 December 1996. This is causing irretrievable and immense loss to the dense evergreen forest holding rich bio-diversity on steep slopes and destroying the water sheds, water catchments and streams and rivers which flow through these forests.\n\n"}

The main goals of the HSP BiH are changes to the Treaty of Dayton, abolition of entities and subdivision of Bosnia and Herzegovina into territorial units.\n\nAustrian-Hungarian authorities considered the foundation of the Ante Starčević's Party of Rights (\"Stranka prava\") in the Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina undesirable. The group of Croat intellectuals thus founded the Croat People's Union (\"Hrvatski narodni savez\", HNZ) with the goal of establishing Starčević's party ideology. HNZ was mostly supported by peasantry, tradesmen and Franciscans. The party's leader was Nikola Mandić, while other prominent members of the party were Ivo Pilar, Safvet-beg Bašagić, Hamid Ekrem Sahinović and Jozo Sunarić.\nAnother party which used elements of Starčević's policy was the Croat Catholic Association (\"Hrvatska katolička udruga\", HKU), which was not a secular party as HNZ was. Its leader was Roman Catholic bishop Josip Stadler. HKU established good relations with the Pure Party of Rights in the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia and especially in the Kingdom of Dalmatia and also the Catholic-Social Party in the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia. The party advocated political Catholicism and unification of Bosnia and Herzegovina with Croat lands.\n\nPilar and his associates stopped cooperating with the Catholic Association because of their political ideology, even though before that, they had good relations with Stadler. A second reason for the freezing of relations was the effort of HKU to unite Bosnia and Herzegovina with Croat lands, which Bosnian Muslims and Serbs didn't approve of. Since both HNZ and HKU were part of the Pan-\"Pravaštvo\" organization, both parties continued to cooperate in 1911 until the end of World War I.\nIn the election for Bosnian legislature in 1910, HNZ won 12 out of 16 Catholic seats, while HKU won the other four. Safvet-beg Bašagić of HNZ was also a president of the Bosnian council in 1910.\n\nHSP BiH was founded in 1991 as branch of the Croatian Party of Rights. One of the most notable early members of the party was Blaž Kraljević, a general of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and founder of the Croatian Defence Forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina. His unit made significant efforts in defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The party's activities during the Bosnian War (1992–95) was marked by efforts to keep unity and friendship of Croats and Bosniaks, its resistance against the partition of Bosnia and Herzegovina between Republic of Croatia and FR Yugoslavia and devotion to unification of Bosnian Croats and the Bosniak state. The Party's earlier political orientation was more nationalist and radical. After the Croatian Democratic Union eliminated Kraljević and had a political monopoly over Herzeg-Bosnia, HSP BiH was dissolved. However, the party's activity was once again established in 1996.\n\nIn 2004, HSP BiH changed its name to \"Croatian Party of Rights of Bosnia and Herzegovina Đapić - dr. Jurišić\", but in 2010, the party took its earlier name.\n\nIn February 2010 it was announced that presidents of three parties, Zvonko Jurišić of HSP BiH, Milenko Brkić of Croatian People's Union (HNZ) and Petar Milić of Croatian Union of Herzeg-Bosnia (HZHB), had signed a treaty for unification of those three parties in one party under the name \"Croatian Party of Rights of Bosnia and Herzegovina\" in Mostar.\n\nThe following is a summary of the party's results in legislative elections for the House of Representatives of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The \"Total votes\" and \"Percentage\" columns include sums of votes won by pre-election coalitions HSP had been part of and the \"Total seats\" column includes sums of seats won by HSP in election constituencies plus representatives of ethnic minorities affiliated with HSP.\n\nThe following is a list of presidential candidates who ran as HSP members.\n\n"}

{"id": "2002292", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2002292", "title": "Gomti River", "text": "Gomti River\n\nThe Gomti, Gumti or Gomati River is a tributary of the Ganges. \nAccording to Hindu history, the river is the daughter of the Hindu sage Vashist; bathing in the Gomti on Ekadashi (the eleventh day of the two lunar phases of the Hindu calendar month) can wash away sins. According to \"Bhagavata Purana\" one of Hinduism's major religious works, the Gomti is one of India's transcendental rivers. The rare Gomti Chakra is found there.\n\nThe Gomti, a monsoon- and groundwater-fed river, originates from Gomat Taal (formally known as Fulhaar jheel) near Madho Tanda, Pilibhit, India. It extends through Uttar Pradesh and meets the Ganges near Saidpur, Kaithi, from Varanasi district.\n\nIt meets a small river, the Gaihaaee, from its origin. The Gomti is a narrow stream until it reaches Mohammadi Kheri, a tehsil of Lakhimpur Kheri district (about 100 km from its origin), where it is joined by tributaries such as the Sukheta, Choha and Andhra Choha. The river is then well-defined, with the Kathina tributary joining it at Mailani and Sarayan joining it at a village in Sitapur district. A major tributary is the Sai River, which joins the Gomti near Jaunpur. The Markandey Mahadeo temple is at the confluence of the Gomti and the Ganges.\n\nAfter the Gomti enters Lucknow, meandering through the city for about and supplying its water. In the Lucknow area, 25 city drains pour untreated sewage into the river. At the downstream end, the Gomti barrage converts the river into a lake.\n\nIn addition to Lucknow, Lakhimpur Kheri, Sultanpur Kerakat and Jaunpur are the most prominent of the 15 towns in the river's catchment basin. The river cuts the Sultanpur district and Jaunpur in half, becoming wider in the city.\n\nThe Gomti River is polluted at several points of its course through the stretch of alluvial plains in Uttar Pradesh. The major sources of pollution are industrial waste and effluent from sugar factories and distilleries and residential wastewater and sewage.\n\nThe river and its tributaries, such as Kukrail Drainage, collect large amounts of human and industrial pollutants as they flow through an area of about 18 million people. High pollution levels threaten the Gomti's aquatic life. On 25 July 2008, the foundation stone of a -capacity sewage treatment plant was laid.\n\nThe plant, promoted as Asia's largest, failed; in 2014 it was reportedly running at 10 percent of capacity, and beyond the plant (near Bharwara) untreated sewage and solid waste entered the river. The plant was intended to intercept the 23 major natural drains entering the Gomti.\n\nThe Gomti has been stressed, particularly in and around Lucknow, for decades. There are three major issues: \n\nAlthough government agencies planned major projects, such as the Bharwara sewage treatment plant and mechanical dredging, most were unsuccessful. The Gomti rises by 10–12 meters during the monsoon, and in 2008 a major flood was reported.\n\nAround 2012, the newly-elected government and the Lucknow Development Authority began a feasibility study with the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee to build a river-front similar to Sabarmati Riverfront in Ahmedabad. The LDA submitted the report, warning about the negative consequences of reducing the Gomti to less than 250 meters wide. At 250 meters wide (with walls on both sides), the river's velocity would increase by 20 percent and its bed-shear stress by 30 percent. Current embankments would have to be raised by 1.5 meters, and the high flood level (HFL) would increase by 1.25 meters. Two bridges would be threatened with collapse under flood conditions.\nThe plan was given to the irrigation department, which signed a memorandum of understanding with IIT Roorkee in December 2015 to conduct a similar study on the project.\n\nThe riverfront-development project is seen as a political showdown between the state government and the ruling party, whose similar construction in Ahmedabad over the Sabarmati River has been projected as a showcase of development in the state of Gujarat. Many noted environmentalists and river-system experts vehemently opposed that project as well.\nBoth projects are seen as a template for similar interference with river systems across India, including the Yamuna, the Hindon and the Varuna.\n\nMonsoon flooding leads to several problems when the water recedes, including the danger posed by drying potholes and pits (which host disease causing mosquitoes such as malaria and dengue).\n\n\n"}

The companies split in 1939, when Wood T. Brookshire took control of the Tyler-area stores in exchange for his share in the Brookshire Brothers partnership. The companies are no longer related except by name.\n\nIn the 1940s, the company expanded to other neighboring communities and opened its first shopping center location. Brookshire’s first warehouse opened in Tyler in 1953.\n\nThe 1960s saw the company's expansion into Louisiana and the construction of a distribution center in Tyler.\n\nIn 1984, the company opened the first of several Super 1 Foods stores in Alexandria, LA. Super 1 Foods was originally a no-frills, warehouse format. Initially, stores were opened in recycled buildings to cut down on cost, but later the company began building stores on their own. In several cases (#608 in Shreveport and #612 in Longview), existing Brookshire's stores were closed and demolished to build a Super 1 Foods store. In Marshall and Longview, existing Brookshire's stores were converted to the Super 1 format.\n\nThe company opened several Super 1 Foods stores in the Dallas/Fort Worth area in the late 1990s and early 2000s, some of which were replacements for nearby Brookshire's locations. The company sold all metro area stores to (now defunct) Fleming, which re-branded them as Rainbow Foods. All Rainbow stores were closed when Fleming went out of business.\n\nIn 2012, a new format Super 1 Foods store was built in Carencro, LA., with a new floorplan and decor package that would be rolled out to all the other stores. A similar store was built to replace #610 in Tyler.\n\nThe Brookshire Grocery Company also opened FRESH by Brookshire's in Tyler, TX on March 10, 2011. The store was designed to give an upscale shopping experience and features a bakery and many organic items. The first annual FRESH 15 Road Race was held on March 1, 2014 and continues yearly.\n\nAlong with the FRESH 15, Brookshire’s and Super 1 Foods host a half marathon, 5K and Kids 1K named Heroes Run, benefiting local first responders and military heroes. This event takes place in Shreveport, LA with 1,500 participants in 2016 raising $40,000 for charity. \n\nIn June 2016 Brookshire's purchased 25 stores formerly owned by Wal-Mart (formerly their Wal-Mart Express brand). The stores, located in Texas (20 stores) and Louisiana (five stores) were re-branded as Spring Market (the name taken from Brookshire's first location on Spring Avenue in Tyler).\n\nToday the company has more than 14,000 employee/partners at over 150 locations.\n\nBGC has four banners: Brookshire's, Super 1 Foods, FRESH by Brookshire's, and Spring Market. \n\nThe company also operates three distribution facilities — two based in Tyler, TX, and one in Monroe, LA. — with more than 2 million total square feet and a company fleet of 72 tractors and more than 300 trailers. BGC’s internal manufacturing facilities include bakery, dairy, ice cream, yogurt, fresh-cut, ice and water/drink plants, all in the Tyler area.\n\nIn 2002, Brookshire's bought four Albertsons stores in Mississippi These stores were located at 5841 Ridgewood Road in North Jackson, 2861 Terry Road in South Jackson, 7045 Old Canton Road in Ridgeland and 143 Albertsons Drive in Flowood. The North Jackson store was the newest of the four locations, having opened in 2001, while the other area stores in South Jackson, Flowood, and Ridgeland having opened in 1997.\n\nOn February 11, 2010; after a decline in market grocery shares against Kroger and Walmart, Brookshire's exited Mississippi with a sale of the Flowood and Ridgeland stores to Kroger and the closure of the two Jackson stores. In late 2011, Brookshire's sold their South Jackson store to Kosciusko, MS based supermarket chain FOOD DEPOT, operated by Potter and Sims Foods. The North Jackson location was converted into a Virginia College location. But then Virginia College closed in December 2018.

It is the fifth installment in the \"Halloween\" series, and stars Donald Pleasence, and Danielle Harris. The film follows Michael Myers returning to Haddonfield to murder his niece, Jamie, one year after the events of \"\".\n\nThe film's on-screen titles do not display \"\"The Revenge of Michael Myers\"\", which was used in all of the promotional material, TV spots, trailers, and merchandising; it simply says \"\"Halloween 5\"\".\n\n\"Halloween 5\" was theatrically released on October 13, 1989, and grossed $11.6 million at the domestic box office on a budget of $6 million, making it the poorest-performing film in the series to date. It received negative reviews from critics upon release, and was followed by \"\" (1995).\n\nOn October 31, 1988, Michael Myers is shot and falls down a mine shaft. Sheriff Ben Meeker, the lynch mob of Haddonfield's truckers, and state police toss down dynamite to finish him off. Escaping into a nearby creek before the dynamite explodes, Michael stumbles upon a local hermit and falls into a coma, placing himself in the hermit's care, and being nursed back to health. One year later, on October 30, 1989, Michael awakens, stabs the hermit to death with his knife, and returns to Haddonfield to find his niece Jamie Lloyd again, who narrowly avoided being killed by him the year before.\n\nJamie has been admitted to a children's hospital, having been rendered mute due to psychological trauma, suffering from nightmares and seizures and being treated for stabbing her foster mother with a pair of scissors under Michael's influence, though her foster mother survived. Jamie exhibits signs of a telepathic link with her uncle. Dr. Sam Loomis becomes aware of Jamie's psychic link with Michael, and tries to convince Meeker that Michael is still alive. Meanwhile, Michael stabs Jamie's foster sister Rachel to death with a pair of scissors, and begins stalking their friend Tina, also killing Tina's boyfriend Mike by stabbing him with a rake. Tina never finds out about Mike's death.\n\nLater that night, Tina and her friends Sam and Spitz go to a Halloween party at a farm. Sensing that Tina is in danger, Jamie, having regained her ability to speak, goes to warn her. While Sam and Spitz are having sex in the barn, Michael impales Spitz with a rake and decapitates Sam with a scythe. Tina finds the bodies, and goes to warn nearby police deputies, Nick Ross and Tom Ferriah, but finds Michael has killed them. Tina flees, but Michael chases her with Mike's car. After Michael crashes into a tree, Jamie and her friend Billy Hill from the clinic arrive. Michael gets out of the car, and Tina sacrifices herself by letting Michael stab her to death to allow Jamie and Billy time to escape. Loomis arrives, and Jamie finally agrees to help him stop Michael for good.\n\nWith Jamie's help, Loomis lures Michael back to his abandoned childhood home. There, Loomis creates a set-up with the police. However, Meeker and most of the police are called away when they find Michael has broken into the clinic and killed Nurse Patsie and Dr. Max Hart, leaving Trooper Charlie Bloch in charge to help Loomis. When Michael arrives, Loomis tries to reason with him, but Michael slashes him and throws him over the stair banister. Michael goes after Jamie, and Bloch attempts to escape with her out of a window using a rope, but Michael ties the rope around Bloch's neck and hangs him from the window, choking him to death.\n\nJamie races upstairs to the attic where she finds the bodies of Rachel and Mike. Michael finds Jamie, but before he can kill her, she tries to appeal to her uncle's humanity. At Jamie's request, Michael takes off his mask and he sheds a tear. However, when Jamie touches Michael's face, he goes into a fit of rage. Loomis appears, using Jamie as bait, and lures Michael into a trap to weaken him with a tranquilizer gun. After beating Michael unconscious with a wooden plank, Loomis collapses from a stroke. \n\nThe police arrive and take Michael into custody, with Meeker later showing Jamie her uncle chained in a cell. After Jamie steps outside of the police station, a mysterious man in black enters the building and shoots Meeker and a few other cops, before approaching Michael's cell. Jamie then returns inside and finds the dead police officers as well as the door to Michael's cell forced open with him gone. Realizing he is free once again, she breaks down in tears.\n\nThe success of \"\" had revived Michael Myers' fame as the 1980s slasher movie craze had begun to subside, leaving film series like \"Friday the 13th\" and \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" as its most prominent examples. While the previous film was still in theaters, Moustapha Akkad had already laid out plans for \"Halloween 5\". The producers wanted to screen the film in October 1989, just one year after the previous sequel.\n\nThe first draft of the script was written by Shem Bitterman. Bitterman's idea was that Jamie Lloyd would become evil after stabbing her stepmother while The Shape was after her. This idea was rejected by the studio and Akkad, who brought in Michael Jacobs to write the script. After reviewing the script, director Dominique Othenin-Girard added some new aspects like Jamie's inability to speak and her visions.\n\nVeteran actor Donald Pleasence had disagreements with Akkad and Othenin-Girard, citing that Jamie should have been portrayed as \"all-evil\" after stabbing her stepmother. Akkad disagreed, thinking that fans wanted to see more of The Shape. In an interview, Danielle Harris explained what she thought of the idea. Harris said,\n\nThe Hermit, who was shown in the beginning of the film as living in a quiet shack outside of the river with his parrot, was originally supposed to be a young man who tried to bring The Shape back to life after finding him. His shack was supposed to be filled with ancient runes, tablets, and other items for resurrection. This scene was filmed, but was re-shot with an old man, instead of a younger man.\n\nThe script included \"bumbling\" cops, Deputies Nick and Tom, with their own \"clown theme\" to pay homage to Wes Craven's \"The Last House on the Left\".\"\n\nDominique Othenin-Girard attempted to have audiences \"relate to 'Evil', to Michael Myers' 'ill' side\". Girard wanted Michael to appear \"more human [...] even vulnerable, with contradicting feelings inside of him\". He illustrated these feelings with a scene where Michael removes his mask and sheds a tear. Girard explains, \"Again, to humanize him, to give him a tear. If Evil or in this case our boogeyman knows pain, or love or demonstrate a feeling of regrets; he becomes even more scary to me if he pursues his malefic action. He shows an evil determination beyond his feelings. Dr. Loomis tries to reach his emotional side several times in [\"Halloween 5\"]. He thinks he could cure Michael through his feelings.\"\n\nReturning from \"Halloween 4\" was veteran actor Donald Pleasence as Dr. Sam Loomis, along with Danielle Harris, Ellie Cornell, and Beau Starr, as Jamie Lloyd, Rachel Carruthers, and Sheriff Ben Meeker, respectively. Starr would later appear in an un-aired \"Halloween 5\" television spot.\n\nEllie Cornell was keen on returning as Rachel in \"Halloween 5\", although she became disappointed to learn that her character would be killed off early in the film. Originally, Michael was to shove the pair of scissors down her throat, but Cornell felt that this would be too gruesome, and requested that the writers change it; as a result, she is instead stabbed in the chest.\n\nKaren Alston, who portrayed Darlene Carruthers in the previous film, reprised her role in the beginning of the film showing the anonymous person in the mask stabbing her as she falls into the bathtub of water. Her voice-over was recorded by Wendy Kaplan. Kaplan won the role of Tina Williams, the loud and wily friend of Rachel's. After Rachel's demise, Tina inherits the role of Jamie's protector.\n\nGeorge P. Wilbur, who had portrayed The Shape in the previous film, did not express interest in returning to play the role (although he did work as a stunt player on the film). Don Shanks was cast to play the speech-less, white-masked murderer. Shanks had already played a similar character in the first two \"Silent Night, Deadly Night\" films. Shanks also played the Man in Black. Wilbur, who had to wear hockey pads to appear to have a bigger build, would later portray the Shape again in the next installment, \"\". Shanks did not have to wear the hockey pads because he already had a larger build.\n\nMax Robinson would play Maxwell Hart, the doctor who assists Jamie when she is having one of her nightmares in the beginning of the film. Betty Carvalho appears as his assistant, Nurse Patsey, who has a \"motherly\" feel to Jamie. Jeffrey Landman portrayed Billy Hill, Jamie's best friend, who has a stuttering problem. Landman worked with a coach who taught him about stuttering to help him prepare for the role.\n\nNewcomers such as Tamara Glynn, Matthew Walker, and Jonathan Chapin appear as Samantha Thomas, Spitz, and Mike, who are friends of Tina and Rachel. Walker would later appear in another slasher film, \"Child's Play 3\" (1991).\n\nDebra Hill, who had written and produced the first two films, had sold her and John Carpenter's rights to the series before \"Halloween 4\". She had met director Dominique Othenin-Girard at the Sundance Film Festival and liked his style.\n\nShe arranged a meeting with Othenin-Girard and Moustapha Akkad. Akkad liked Othenin-Girard and he became the director. This was Debra Hill's last involvement in the franchise. Othenin-Girard wanted to bring the franchise closer to the original, but wanted more blood in the film. The original uncut version of the film featured more explicit blood and violence. Akkad did not like this decision, as he felt that the original and \"Halloween 4\" had worked better without showing as much detail.\n\nAfter filming for two weeks, Donald Pleasence gave his much bigger trailer to Danielle Harris once he left set. Harris' mother had been complaining about the small size of her daughter's trailer and Pleasence decided that she should have his.\n\nDanielle Harris and Don Shanks became good friends over the course of filming, reportedly spending a lot of time together while off set.\n\nThe film began production on May 1, 1989, and was filmed in and around Salt Lake City, Utah, just like its predecessor. The bus that the Man in Black gets off of stops outside exactly the same store where Jamie and Rachel went to get a Halloween costume in \"\".\n\nUnable to find a small Victorian house like the Myers house in \"Halloween\", the filmmakers chose a bigger, more mansion-like house because they needed a house that could provide wide rooms, hallways, an attic, a basement, and a laundry chute.\n\nDonald Pleasence accidentally broke Don Shanks' nose on the set when they were filming the scene where Dr. Loomis beats The Shape with a 2×4 block of wood.\n\nDon Shanks was also injured when he was filming the scene where The Shape crashes Mike's Camaro into the tree. Othenin-Girard had forgotten to yell \"Cut!\" and fire was beginning to emerge from the car (Shanks put this down to Othenin-Girard being sidetracked by seeing stunts take place during his first major directing job). Finally, stunt coordinator Don Hunt told Othenin-Girard to finally yell \"cut\". Wendy Kaplan was also injured in this scene, as the car almost ran over the top of her.\n\nThe film had been fighting an X rating due to its violence, blood, and gore. Some scenes were trimmed down to keep it rated R. The scene in which Jamie climbs up the laundry chute was originally more graphic. Originally, Michael stabbed her in the leg. But due to the request of the Motion Picture Association of America, the scene was cut down.\n\nAn alternative opening was filmed with the Hermit replaced by a younger man with all kinds of ritualistic items in his cabin.\n\nIn April 2019, film reels were discovered which possibly contain the original lost opening.\n\nThe film received mostly negative reviews from critics. Stephen Holden of \"The New York Times\" wrote that the film was \"rather like taking another swing through the same all-too-familiar funhouse\", but thought it was \"a bit more refined in its details than the conventional horror movie\". \"Variety\" called the film \"pretty stupid and boring fare\" and noted that the series had become \"practically indistinguishable from the 'Friday the 13th' pics\". Richard Harrington of the \"Los Angeles Times\" criticised the film as being \"a prime example of the principle of diminishing reruns\" and criticized Donald Pleasence for \"a flat two-note performance\", though he thought Danielle Harris was \"actually pretty good\" in her role.\n\nBased on 24 reviews, it currently has a 13% 'Rotten' score on Rotten Tomatoes and an average rating of 3.59/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \"\"Halloween 5: The Revenge Of Michael Myers\" finds the series embracing crude slasher conventions with pedestrian scares, disposable characters, and aimless plotting.\n\nAt the US box office the film took in $11.6 million on a budget of $5–6 million, making it the poorest performing film in the series to date.\n\nThe film has been released on VHS, LaserDisc and DVD. The original VHS was released by CBS/FOX. It has been released, along with \"Halloween 4\", the \"Halloween: 25 Years of Terror\" documentary and the Blu-ray, DVD and Extended Edition releases of \"Halloween\" (1978) for the commemorative \"Halloween\" 30th Anniversary box set in 2008. A Blu-ray edition was released in the United States on August 21, 2012. The film was released on DVD/Blu-ray on October 2, 2013 in Australia, and the DVD/Blu-ray extras are commentary, on the set footage and trailer.\n\n"}

She served as regent during the minority of her son from 1660 until 1672, and during the minority of her grandson Charles XII in 1697. She also represented Charles XII during his absence in the Great Northern War from 1700 until the regency of her granddaughter Ulrika Eleonora in 1713. Hedwig Eleonora was described as a dominant personality, and was regarded as the \"de facto\" first lady of the royal court for 61 years, from 1654 until her death.\n\nHedwig Eleonora was born on 23 October 1636 to Duke Frederick III of Holstein-Gottorp and Marie Elisabeth of Saxony. She was the sixth of the couple's sixteen children. One day after her eighteenth birthday, she was married to King Charles X Gustav of Sweden on 24 October 1654. Charles Gustav was the second cousin of Hedwig Eleonora's mother. He and Hedwig Eleonora were also third cousins twice.The marriage was arranged as an alliance between Sweden and Holstein-Gottorp against their mutual enemy Denmark. Queen Christina of Sweden met Hedwig Eleonora in Holstein-Gottorp on her way to Rome after her abdication. Christina was concerned that Charles Gustav was unmarried, and so she suggested the match. The suggestion was immediately accepted by Holstein-Gottorp, who agreed to all demands from Sweden, which made the negotiations quick. Hedwig Eleonora was at the time engaged to Gustav Adolph, Duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow, and Queen Christina recommended Hedwig Eleonora's elder sister, Magdalene Sibylle of Holstein-Gottorp. After having seen portraits of both sisters, however, Charles Gustav chose Hedwig Eleonora because of her beauty, and her current fiancé was instead married to Magdalena Sibylle. In the marriage contract, Hedwig Eleonora was granted a dowry of 20.000 riksdaler, 32.000 riksdaler as a dower, and the incomes of the fiefs of Gripsholm, Eskilstuna and Strömsholm. \n\nHedwig Eleonora was welcomed by King Charles X Gustav at Dalarö in Sweden 5 October 1654, and stayed at Karlberg Palace before her official arrival at Stockholm for the wedding 24 October. She was greeted, dressed in silver brocade, by queen dowager Maria Eleonora of Brandenburg at the Stockholm Royal Palace, where the wedding was celebrated the same day. She was crowned queen at Storkyrkan 27 October. Shortly after, her husband left for Poland to participate in the Deluge (history). Hedwig Eleonora remained in Sweden for the birth of the future Charles XI the 24 November 1655 and the following Christmas. The spring of 1656, she left Sweden and followed Charles Gustav during his campaign, during which she displayed both physical and mental strength. She was present during the Battle of Warsaw (1656), during which she received the official praise from the Swedish army alongside her spouse. She returned to Sweden in the autumn of 1656. In Sweden, she took control over her dower lands, which she strictly controlled during her life. After the Dano-Swedish War (1657–1658)), she was called to join her husband at Gothenburg, then she followed him to Gottorp and Wismar. During the Dano-Swedish War (1658-1660), she and her sister-in-law Maria Eufrosyne of Pfalz lived at Kronborg in Denmark after it had been taken by the Swedish general Carl Gustaf Wrangel. At Kronborg, Hedwig Eleonora was visited by her husband and entertained the foreign ambassadors. She visited Frederiksborgs Palace and hunted in the woods with the English ambassador. During the Falster campaign, she entertained the ambassadors at Nyköbing Falster. Hedwig Eleonora left for Gothenburg in December 1659, where the Swedish parliament was to assemble in January 1660.\n\nAfter the death of her consort Charles X Gustav 13 February 1660, Hedwig Eleonora became regent of Sweden and chair of the Regency Council of her son Charles XI during his minority. According to the will and testament of Charles Gustav, Hedwig Eleonora was to be the chair and regent with two votes and a final say over the rest of the council: the power over the government was shared with five high officials, including Per Brahe, but her vote was to be the preferred one. The will was immediately contested by the council, especially because her former brother-in-law Adolph John I, Count Palatine of Kleeburg, had been given power over the army. The day after the death of her husband, Hedwig Eleonora sent a message to the council that she knew that they contested the will, and she demanded that it should be respected. The council answered that the will must first be discussed with the parliament. At the following council in Stockholm 13 May, the council tried to keep her from attending. They questioned whether it would be good for her health or suitable for a widow to attend council, and that if not, it would be hard to keep sending a messenger to her quarters. Her reply that the council would be allowed to meet without her and only inform her when they considered it necessary was met with satisfaction from the council. Hedwig Eleonora's ostensible indifference to politics came as a great relief to the lords of the guardian government.\n\nDespite her initial message, Hedwig Eleonora was in fact present at all council meetings except when she was away to administrate her dower lands. She used her position as regent foremost to protect her son's interests and rights toward the council, and thereby saw it as her duty to be informed and present in the decisions, although she did not take part in them. Adolph John of Kleeburg had lost command of the army and his status as a prince of Sweden, and her only support in the council came from Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie. Aware of the fact that she did not have enough support in the council to manage her own policy, she did not wish to risk being maneuvered from her position by challenging the council. She concurred with the anti-Danish and pro-French foreign policy during the regency years. She did, however, dislike war and gave her support to the peace party in the council: she gave her support to the Peace of Oliva, unsuccessfully opposed the war against Bremen, but successfully prevented a suggested war toward Russia, which is described as the only time when she forced her will upon the council.\nHedwig Eleonora herself described how she disliked politics and diplomacy, and she did not participate much in politics during her regency. Her minor part in politics during her time as regent resulted in the fact that her son exempted her when he later accused the guardian government for power abuse during their regency. During her son's first appearances in Parliament, he talked only to the members of the government through her; he would whisper the questions he had to the Parliament to her, and she would ask them loud and clear.\n\nAfter the death of her son on 5 April 1697, Hedwig Eleonora again became the regent of Sweden, as the chair of the Regency Council during the minority of her grandson Charles XII. This time, her regency only lasted until the declaration of her grandson's majority in December the same year. During her second regency, she supported the marriage alliance between Sweden and Holstein-Gottorp through the wedding of her granddaughter Hedvig Sophia of Sweden to the Duke of Holstein-Gottorp. She opposed the early declaration of majority of Charles XII, but was forced to concede. She also unsuccessfully protested against to the fact that her grandson was not asked to make any oath at his coronation.\n\nDuring her regency, she kept thorough records of her contracts and accounts. She spent significant sums to restore the grandeur of the court, since Queen Christina had taken many of the treasures on her abdication. She was able to cover these costs from the significant income from her personal lands. She oversaw the construction of multiple manors and palaces, including Drottningholm Palace.\n\nHedwig Eleonora enjoyed great respect as \"Riksänkedrottningen\", which means \"Queen Dowager of the Realm\".\nDuring her reign, Hedwig Eleonora focused more on the administration of her dower lands and the upbringing of her son rather than to politics. In her upbringing of her son Charles XI, she focused on religion and moral and physical training and athletics rather than on academic studies, and she has been criticized for having spoiled him by not having forced him to attend to his studies.\n\nAlthough she herself was interested in culture and the sciences, she put no demands on him and allowed him to skip his studies: as he had a frail health during childhood, she found it more important for him to strengthen his body, and to discipline his moral by studies of religion.\n\nIn 1661, Hedwig Eleonora was considered a possible consort for King Charles II of England. Nothing came of it, however, as she refused the proposal: the official ground for her refusal was that she claimed that she wished to remain faithful to her dead husband. \nIn 1667, the young nobleman Count Carl Gyllenstierna (1649–1723), was made Chamberlain to Hedwig Eleonora. He became the favourite of Hedwig Eleonora, served as her courier during the Scanian War, was promoted General-Governor of her dower lands in 1679 and was given the title of count in 1687. Carl Gyllenstierna was the favourite of Hedwig Eleonora and has been pointed out as her lover, and although this is not confirmed, he his swift career at court was attributed to his good looks. There is a legend that the residence of Gyllenstierna, Steninge Palace, was built with a secret passage from his bedroom to the bedroom in the so-called Queen's Wing, which was used by Hedwig Eleonora during her frequents visits. During her later years, Hedwig Eleonora was criticized for her favourite, Anna Catharina von Bärfelt, whose influence led to an open conflict with Gyllenstierna. Bärfelt was known for taking bribes from supplicants to the Queen Dowager and rumoured to steal from Hedwig Eleonora. Gyllenstierna made an ultimatum and asked Hedwig Eleonora to choose between him and Bärfelt, which eventually led to Bärfelt being banished from court after Gyllenstierna had formed an alliance with Christina Piper, Beata Sparre, the Mistress of the Robes Märta Berendes, Arvid Horn and the court chaplain Molin. The night before her departure, Gyllenstierna had to door to Hedwig Eleonora's bedroom locked to prevent Bärfelt from contacting the queen dowager.\n\nHedwig Eleonora corresponded with her German relatives and often entertained them as guests: she raised her niece Magdalena Sibylla of Hesse-Darmstadt as her foster child, as well as her late husband's niece, Juliana of Hesse-Eschwege. The latter was long unofficially understood to be the future queen by marriage to Charles XI when he became an adult, but the plan was abandoned when Juliana gave birth to a child outside of marriage (1672). Hedwig Eleonora had Juliana sent to the country side, but when she had a second child, she was forcibly married to the father and expelled.\n\nHedwig Eleonora had a very close relationship with her son, Charles XI, who “kept himself to her completely and unreservedly”.\nShe accompanied him during his trips around the country, and during the Scanian war, she often stayed in Vadstena, where he visited her from the war front, to be closer to him.\nEven after her son's marriage to Ulrike Eleonora of Denmark, she essentially kept her position as the first lady of the court. \nCharles XI referred to his mother as “The Queen” or “Her Majesty the Queen My Dear Lady Mother” and to Ulrike Eleonora simply as \"My Wife\". Foreign ambassadors, mindful of this, always paid their respects to Hedwig Eleonora first, and then to Ulrike Eleonora. The hostility between and Holstein-Gottorp and Denmark also made the relationship between Hedwig Eleonora and her Danish daughter-in-law tense. Charles XI regularly discussed the affairs of state with his mother, and while it does not appear that she purposely influenced him, he respected her opinions and usually followed them.\n\nCharles XI is believed to have been affected by his mother when he judged the Catechism of the Bishops Terseri, Spegel and Emporagi as heresy: it is known that Hedwig Eleonora especially disliked the catechism of Bishop Emporagi, because it defined women as property. Also Charles XI decisions in the area of rank and art is believed to be influenced by her.\n\nHer grandson Charles XII had great respect for her. There is a well-known episode from the so-called Gottorp Fury, when Charles XII spent his time drinking and partying with his brother-in-law and her nephew Frederick IV, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp. At one occasion, Charles XII encountered his grandmother in a state of drunkenness, upon which she gave him a long look and then turned her back to him. He reacted by emptying his cup and saying: “My Gracious Lady Grandmother is pleased to forgive me. From hereafter I will never more drink wine”, a promise he kept. \nDuring the Great Northern War, she represented her absent grandson and received the foreign ambassadors in his place. According to their reports, she treated them with silence or could laugh at them.\n\nHedwig Eleonora was closest to her elder granddaughter, Hedwig Sophia, and after the death of Hedwig Sophia, she supported Hedwig Sophia's son, Charles Frederick, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, as heir to the throne after Charles XII before her younger granddaughter, Ulrika Eleonora.\nThe supporters of Charles Frederick also wished to have Hedwig Eleonora appointed regent during the minority of Charles Frederick, should he succeed. In 1713, however, she was forced to persuade Ulrika Eleonora to accept the position of regent during the absence of Charles XII. She supported the marriage of Ulrika Eleonora to Frederick of Hesse with the thought that Ulrika Eleonora would then move to Hesse, which would make it easier for Charles Frederick to succeed to the Swedish throne.\n\nHedwig Eleonora has been described as firm and dominant; she was popular at court for her humour and because of her fondness of parties, and was regarded as strict but fair by her employees. Among Hedwig Eleonora's interests were architecture and painting, as well as playing cards; her appetite for gambling was great, and she is reported to have continued playing well into the night. When her mourning period officially ended in 1663, the court was overwhelmed with parties hosted by the queen dowager. As part of the festivities, she opened the theatres Bollhuset and Lejonkulan. She also acquired the first spa in Sweden, Medevi (1688). She sponsored artists, such as Nicodemus Tessin the Younger and David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl.\n\n"}
{"id": "2002341", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2002341", "title": "Vocal register", "text": "Vocal register\n\nA vocal register is a range of tones in the human voice produced by a particular vibratory pattern of the vocal folds. These registers include modal voice (or normal voice), vocal fry, falsetto, and the whistle register.\nRegisters originate in laryngeal function. They occur because the vocal folds are capable of producing several different vibratory patterns. Each of these vibratory patterns appears within a particular range of pitches and produces certain characteristic sounds.\n\nIn speech pathology, the vocal register has three components: a certain vibratory pattern of the vocal folds, a certain series of pitches, and a certain type of sound. Although this view is also adopted by many vocal pedagogists, others define vocal registration more loosely than in the sciences, using the term to denote various theories of how the human voice changes, both subjectively and objectively, as it moves through its pitch range. There are many divergent theories on vocal registers within vocal pedagogy, making the term somewhat confusing and at times controversial within the field of singing. Vocal pedagogists may use the term vocal register to refer to any of the following:\n\n\nManuel Garcia II in the late nineteenth century was one of the first to develop a scientific definition of registers, a definition that is still used by pedagogues and vocal teachers today.\nAnother definition is from Clifton Ware in the 1990s.\nA register consists of the homogeneous tone qualities produced by the same mechanical system whereas registration is the process of using and combining the registers to achieve artistic singing. For example: a skilled singer moves through their range and dynamics smoothly, so that you are unaware of register changes. This process could be described as good or clean registration.\nThe term \"register\" originated in the sixteenth century. Before then it was recognized that there were different \"voices\". As teachers started to notice how different the ranges on either side of the passaggios or breaks in the voice were, they were compared to different sets of pipes in an organ. These clusters of pipes were called registers, so the same term was adopted for voices.\n\nVocal registers arise from different vibratory patterns produced by the vocal cords. Research by speech pathologists and some vocal pedagogists has revealed that the vocal cords are capable of producing at least four distinct vibratory forms, although not all persons can produce all of them. The first of these vibratory forms is known as natural or normal voice; another name for it is modal voice, which is widely used in both speech pathology and vocal pedagogy publications. In this usage, modal refers to the natural disposition or manner of action of the vocal cords. The other three vibratory forms are known as vocal fry, falsetto, and whistle. Each of these four registers has its own vibratory pattern, its own pitch range (although there is some overlap), and its own characteristic sound. Arranged by the pitch ranges covered, vocal fry is the lowest register, modal voice is next, then falsetto, and finally the whistle register.\n\nWhile speech pathologists and scholars of phonetics recognize four registers, vocal pedagogists are divided. Indiscriminate use of the word register has led to confusion and controversy about the number of registers in the human voice within vocal pedagogical circles. This controversy does not exist within speech pathology and the other sciences, because vocal registers are viewed from a purely physiological standpoint concerned with laryngeal function. Writers concerned with the art of singing state that there are anywhere from one to seven registers present. The diversity of opinion is wide with no consensus.\n\nThe prevailing practice within vocal pedagogy is to divide both men and women's voices into three registers. Men's voices are designated \"chest\", \"head\", and \"falsetto\" and women's voices are \"chest\", \"middle\", and \"head\". This way of classifying registers, however, is not universally accepted. Many vocal pedagogists blame this confusion on the incorrect use of the terms \"chest register\" and \"head register\". These professionals argue that, since all registers originate in laryngeal function, it is meaningless to speak of registers being produced in the chest or head. The vibratory sensations which are felt in these areas are resonance phenomena and should be described in terms related to resonance, not to registers. These vocal pedagogists prefer the terms \"chest voice\" and \"head voice\" over the term register. Many of the problems described as register problems are actually problems of resonance adjustment. This helps to explain the multiplicity of registers which some vocal pedagogists advocate. For more information on resonance, see Vocal resonation.\n\nThe confusion which exists concerning the definition and number of registers is due in part to what takes place in the modal register when a person sings from the lowest pitches of that register to the highest pitches. The frequency of vibration of the vocal folds is determined by their length, tension, and mass. As pitch rises, the vocal folds are lengthened, tension increases, and their thickness decreases. In other words, all three of these factors are in a state of flux in the transition from the lowest to the highest tones.\n\nIf a singer holds any of these factors constant and interferes with their progressive state of change, her laryngeal function tends to become static and eventually breaks occur, with obvious changes of tone quality. These breaks are often identified as register boundaries or as transition areas between registers. The distinct change or break between registers is called a passaggio or a ponticello. Vocal pedagogists teach that, with study, a singer can move effortlessly from one register to another with ease and consistent tone. Registers can even overlap while singing. Teachers who prefer the theory of \"blending registers\" usually help students through the \"passage\" from one register to another by hiding their \"lift\" (where the voice changes).\n\nHowever, many pedagogists disagree with this distinction of boundaries blaming such breaks on vocal problems which have been created by a static laryngeal adjustment that does not permit the necessary changes to take place. This difference of opinion has affected the different views on vocal registration.\n\nThe vocal fry register is the lowest vocal register and is produced through a loose glottal closure which will permit air to bubble through with a popping or rattling sound of a very low frequency. The chief use of vocal fry in singing is to obtain pitches of very low frequency which are not available in modal voice. This register may be used therapeutically to improve the lower part of the modal register. This register is not used often in singing, but male quartet pieces, and certain styles of folk music for both men and women have been known to do so.\n\nThe modal voice is the usual register for speaking and singing, and the vast majority of both are done in this register. As pitch rises in this register, the vocal folds are lengthened, tension increases, and their edges become thinner. A well-trained singer or speaker can phonate two octaves or more in the modal register with consistent production, beauty of tone, dynamic variety, and vocal freedom. This is possible only if the singer or speaker avoids static laryngeal adjustments and allows the progression from the bottom to the top of the register to be a carefully graduated continuum of readjustments.\n\nThe falsetto register lies above the modal voice register and overlaps the modal register by approximately one octave. The characteristic sound of falsetto is flute-like with few overtones present. Male singers can phonate in the falsetto register. The essential difference between the modal and falsetto registers lies in the amount and type of vocal cord involvement. The falsetto voice is produced by the vibration of the ligamentous edges of the vocal cords, in whole or in part, and the main body of the fold is more or less relaxed. In contrast, the modal voice involves the whole vocal cord with the glottis opening at the bottom first and then at the top. The falsetto voice is also more limited in dynamic variation and tone quality than the modal voice.\n\nThe whistle register is the highest register of the human voice. The whistle register is so called because the timbre of the notes that are produced from this register are similar to that of a whistle or the upper notes of a flute, whereas the modal register tends to have a warmer, less shrill timbre.\n\n"}

{"id": "2002371", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2002371", "title": "The Tale of Tsar Saltan (opera)", "text": "The Tale of Tsar Saltan (opera)\n\nThe Tale of Tsar Saltan (, \"Skazka o Tsare Saltane\") is an opera in four acts with a prologue (a total of seven scenes) by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. The libretto was written by Vladimir Belsky, and is based on the 1831 poem of the same name by Aleksandr Pushkin. The opera was composed in 1899–1900 to coincide with Pushkin's centenary, and was first performed in 1900 in Moscow, Russia.\n\nThe lengthy full title of both the opera and the poem is \"The Tale of Tsar Saltan, of his Son the Renowned and Mighty Bogatyr Prince Gvidon Saltanovich and of the Beautiful Princess-Swan\" ( \"Skazka o tsare Saltane, o syne yego slavnom i moguchem bogatyre knyaze Gvidone Saltanoviche i o prekrasnoy tsarevne Lebedi\").\n\nThe plot of the opera generally follows that of Pushkin's fairy-tale poem, with the addition of some characters, some expansion (particularly for Act 1), and some compression (mostly by reducing Gvidon's three separate trips to one). The libretto by Belsky borrows many lines from and largely emulates the style of Pushkin's poem, which is written in couplets of trochaic tetrameter. The music is composed in the manner of Rimsky-Korsakov's operas after \"Snowmaiden\", i.e., having a more or less continuous musical texture throughout a tableau system, broken up here and there by song-like passages.\n\nThe première was held in Moscow on 3 November (O.S. 21 October) 1900 at the Solodovnikov Theatre conducted by Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov with scenic design by Mikhail Vrubel.\n\nThe St. Petersburg premiere took place in 1902 at the St. Petersburg Conservatory, conducted by Zelyonïy.\n\nOther notable performances included those in 1906 at the Zimin Opera, Moscow, conducted by Ippolitov-Ivanov; 1913 at the Bolshoy Theatre in Moscow, conducted by Emil Cooper, with scenic design by Konstantin Korovin; and 1915 at the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg, conducted by Albert Coates, with scenic design by Korovin and Aleksandr Golovin.\n\nOn , while he was attending a performance of the opera at the Kiev Opera House in the presence of the Tsar and his family, the Russian Prime Minister Pyotr Stolypin was shot twice, once in the arm and once in the chest, dying two days later; his assassin, Dmitri Bogrov, was both a leftist radical and an agent of the Okhrana.\n\nThe UK premiere took place in London on 11 October 1933 at Sadler's Wells Theatre and the US premiere was presented on 27 December 1937 under the title of \"The Bumble-Bee Prince\".\n\nOn a wintry evening three sisters are sitting at spinning wheels. As Tsar Saltan overhears from outside the door, the oldest sister boasts that, if she were Tsaritsa (the bride of the Tsar), she would prepare a sumptuous feast; the middle sister would weave a grand linen; the youngest promises to bear, as son for the Tsar, a bogatyr (warrior-knight). Saltan enters, chooses the third sister to be his bride (\"Zdravstvuy, krasnaya devitsa!\" = \"Greetings, beautiful girl!\"), and takes her away. The old woman Babarikha devises a revenge for the two jealous older sisters (\"Nu, tak slushat, ne meshat\" = \"Then listen well and don’t interrupt\"): when the Tsar is away at war, a message will be sent to him that the child born to his Tsaritsa is not human, but a monster.\n\n\"Introduction — Saltan’s Departure\"\n\n\"Scene\"\n\nThe Tsar has gone off to war. In his palace in Tmutarakan, the Tsaritsa has given birth to a son, to whom a chorus of nannies sings a lullaby (\"Bayushki, bayushki!\"). She is despondent: there is no reply from her husband to the news of the birth of their child. Her sisters are (with Babarikha) now part of the court: the older sister as Cook, and the middle sister as Weaver. (They have secretly replaced the message of the Tsaritsa to her husband with news of her son's birth with another message: it said that she has borne neither a daughter nor a son, neither a mouse nor a frog, but a kind of monster.) They try to entertain her, as does the skomorokh (jester) and the old man (\"Gosudarynya, tsaritsa, matushka\" = \"Your highness, queen, mother\"). But all this is to no avail. The young Tsarevich baby, who has been lulled to sleep during this scene, awakens and runs about, accompanied by his nurses, and the people wish God's blessings upon him. Then a messenger stumbles in, having been waylaid with drink by Babarikha. He sings \"Gosudarynya moya, ne veli kaznit menya\" (\"Your highness, don’t punish me\"), and his message from the Tsar is read by the scribes: the Tsaritsa and her progeny must be placed in a barrel and thrown into the sea. Reluctantly the people carry out the Tsar's command.\n\n\"Introduction — Militrisa and Gvidon Afloat In the Barrel\"\n\n\"Scene\"\n\nThe Tsaritsa and her son Gvidon have landed on the island of Buyan, and broken out of the barrel in which they were trapped. Gvidon, who has grown remarkably rapidly into a young man, is searching for sustenance. While doing this, he rescues a swan from being killed by a kite. in gratitude, the Swan-Bird sings to him (\"Ty, tsarevich, moy spasitel\" = \"You, Prince, my Saviour\"). The Tsaritsa explains Gvidon's early history to her son, and the Swan-Bird causes the city of Ledenets (, \"lollipop\") to arise magically on the island. Gvidon is hailed by its inhabitants as its Prince.\n\n\"Scene 1\"\n\nBy the shore of Buyan, the merchant ships have left, and Gvidon laments having being separated from his father (\"Veter po moryu gulyayet\" = \"The wind blows over the sea\"). The Swan-Bird will help him by changing him into a bumblebee. He will be able to fly over the sea, as a stowaway on Saltan's ship, to visit him (incognito) in Tmutarakan.\n\n\"Interlude — Flight of the Bumblebee\"\n\n\"Scene 2\"\n\nThe sailors arrive at Tmutarakan from their visit to Buyan. The sailors tell Tsar Saltan of the wonders of Gvidon's island (the magically appearing city itself, a magic squirrel, and the thirty-three bogatyrs from the sea). The two older sisters are concerned that the Tsar will become interested in visiting the island, and they try to dissuade him. In retaliation the bumble-bee Gvidon stings each of them in the brow. Babarikha then tries to trump the sailors, by speaking of a fabulous Princess on the sea, at which point Gvidon stings her in the eye and blinds her. Saltan decides to visit the island, but, in view of the havoc caused by the bumblebee, forbids that breed of insect from ever entering the palace again.\n\n\"Scene 1\"\n\nGvidon, again by the seashore of Buyan, longs for a bride (\"V sinem more zvyozdy bleshchut\" = \"Over the blue sea stars shine\"). The Swan-Bird appears, and Gvidon tells her of the Princess that he heard about at Tmutarakan. The Swan-Bird transforms herself into that very Princess. His mother and a chorus of maidens enter, and bless the prospect of their wedding.\n\n\"Orchestral interlude — Three Wonders\"\n\n\"Scene 2\"\n\nGvidon, with his mother hidden, awaits the arrival of Saltan. When the ship arrives with the Tsar and his retinue, Gvidon greets him, and questions him as to whether or not he will have a son to carry on his work. The Saltan does not yet know that Gvidon is his son (\"Akh, moguchiy knyaz Gvidon\" = \"Ah, mighty Prince Gvidon\"), and expresses regret for his rash treatment of his wife many years earlier. Although Gvidon tries to cheer him up with the three wonders, it becomes clear that only the presence of Militrisa can assuage Saltan's guilt. The Princess-Swan (Lyebyed) appears and reveals the Tsar's long-lost wife. The older sisters beg forgiveness, which in his happiness Saltan grants. Everyone then joins in a celebration of the upcoming wedding of Gvidon and the Princess-Swan.\n\nA link to the Russian-English libretto with transliteration: http://aquarius-classic.ru/album?aid=188&tid=7&ver=eng\n\nAct 1<br>\nAct 2<br>\n\nAct 3<br>\nAct 4<br>\nSuite from the Opera \"The Tale of Tsar Saltan\", Op. 57 (1903)\n\nThe \"Flight of the Bumblebee\" is also performed in various arrangements at concerts and recitals, but is not part of the Suite.\n\nIvan Bilibin made the following illustrations for Pushkin's tale in 1905.

Payne trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London and was identified, in the late 1980s, with the \"Brit Pack\" of rising young British actors. Payne is best known for portraying villains, such as Charles Rane in \"Passenger 57\", Jacob Kell in \"\", and Damodar in \"Dungeons & Dragons\" and \"\".\n\nPayne developed an interest for acting at an early age. In an interview with Impact magazine in 2001, Payne claimed that a crocodile from the play Peter Pan shouted that it would eat his brother and then proceeded to run up stage.\n\nAt the age of 14, he was diagnosed with a slight form of spina bifida, which by age 16 required surgery to rectify. Payne was hospitalised for 6 months following the operation.\nPayne continued school studies, despite a contact with a talent scout during that time. After his graduation, he enrolled in the National Youth Theatre for two seasons. Payne has described this experience as \"Four hundred kids thrown together to work on 7 plays.\" In addition, he was occupied with the Edinburgh Festival Fringe for one season. He then auditioned for several fringe acting companies, but was told he was too young and lacked experience. However, in 1979, he was admitted to the \"prestigious\" RADA acting programme. Before being accepted at RADA, Payne worked as a joiner, a salesman, and a landscape gardener. Payne graduated from RADA in 1981 with seven major prizes for acting, comedy (Payne won the Fabia Drake Prize for Comedy) and physical presence.\n\nPayne was part of a 'new wave' of actors to emerge from the academy. Others included Jonathan Pryce, Juliet Stevenson, Alan Rickman, Anton Lesser, Kenneth Branagh, and Fiona Shaw. In 1980 the Principal of RADA, Hugh Cruttwell, selected a scene from an adaptation of William Shakespeare's \"Macbeth\", which Payne co-wrote with Paul McGann, to be performed in front of Queen Elizabeth II, in one of her rare visits to the academy. Payne directed the scene in which he and McGann acted. Payne played Macbeth and wielded a baseball bat on stage instead of a sword. Kenneth Branagh performed a soliloquy from \"Hamlet\" at the same event.\n\nPayne's first television role was in the \"Tales Out of School\" series. Payne played a PE teacher who 'comes across as more head bully than responsible adult during his classes'. His first major film role came in \"Privates on Parade\" in which he played the singing and dancing Flight Sergeant Kevin Cartwright (whom he had already played in the stage version).\n\nIn 1983, he appeared in Michael Mann's horror film \"The Keep\" as an unnamed border guard. That same year, Steven Berkoff cast him in his production of \"West\" at the Donmar Warehouse. Payne played Les, a member of an East End London gang intent on gaining revenge against the rival Hoxton Mob for the slaying of one of their number. Richard Corliss of \"TIME\" stated that Payne bestowed \"a frighteningly dynamic performance\" in the play.\n\nIn 1985, Payne was cast as a \"committed\", \"butch snooker manager\" known as \"The One\" (also known as \"T.O.\") in director Alan Clarke's snooker musical \"Billy the Kid and the Green Baize Vampire\". Michael Brooke stated that Payne gave the \"stand-out performance\" in the film. and \"MS London\" stated that Payne 'is a charismatic presence, with a capable voice, who is perfectly cast as The One'.\n\nIn 1986, both Payne and Berkoff appeared in Julien Temple's musical \"Absolute Beginners\" . Payne played a psychotic \"pompous and pathetic racist\" named Flikker, who participated in the 1958 Notting Hill race riots. One reviewer argued that Payne was \"the only actor to walk off \"Absolute Beginners\" with his reputation not only intact but enhanced\" and that his portrayal of Flikker \"was a headbutt of reality in a fantasmagoria of overkill.\" One critic stated that Payne gave a \"meaty, saving-grace performance\" in the film. The film journalist and editor, Ann Lloyd, selected Payne as the most promising newcomer of 1987 for his role in the film. In the same year Payne appeared in the film \"Solarbabies\", along with fellow British performer Alexei Sayle, as filthy bounty hunters named Dogger and Malice. Payne said of his and Sayle's performances in \"Vogue\" that \"the old image of an English arch-villain – Boris Karloff, that sort of thing\" is turned \"upside down. We're just a couple of soaks\".\n\nIn 1988, Payne appeared as Eddy in the Steven Berkoff-directed play, \"Greek\" (a retelling of Sophocles' \"Oedipus Rex\"), at the Wyndham's Theatre. Martin Hoyle, writing for \"The Independent\", stated that Payne's \"Eddy is vital, intelligent and physically disciplined in the best Berkoff style\". Charles Osbourne, writing for \"The Daily Telegraph\", stated that Payne brought \"a cheerful zest to the role of Eddy\".\n\nA reviewer for \"The Listener\" stated that Payne \"impresses throughout\" the play. Another reviewer stated that \"Payne gives a powerful performance as Eddy, the crusader out to defeat the horror of society\" only \"to find that he is part of the horror\".\n\nIn 1989, he was cast in \"For Queen and Country\" as a 'drug kingpin' named Colin.\n\nPayne and other young British actors who were becoming established film actors, such as Tim Roth, Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, and Paul McGann, were dubbed the 'Brit Pack'. Payne's performances endeared him to Warner Bros., who considered \"Bruce Payne as Bruce Wayne\" on their \"one liner\" press marketing PR campaign for the first of Tim Burton's \"Batman\" films. Ultimately, Michael Keaton got the role. Payne has commented, \"Warner were fascinated by the similarity\" between his name and that of Bruce Wayne. Payne has said that \"they drew up a very short shortlist and there I was on it. Obviously, I lost out in the end to Michael Keaton\".<ref name=\"http://www.agwlbp.com/sunday.html\"></ref>\n\nIn the same year Payne appeared as Doctor Burton in the dramatic film \"Zwei Frauen\" The film was nominated for Outstanding Feature Film at the German Film Awards.\n\nIn 1990 Payne appeared in the music video for Neil Young's song \"Over and Over\", directed by Julien Temple, as a Stanley Kowalski (played by Marlon Brando in \"A Streetcar Named Desire\", a film based on Tennessee Williams' play of the same name) esque character.\n\nIn 1991, Payne was cast as the Devil in \"Switch\". Payne was described as a \"delightfully wicked Satan\" by \"Film Review\". \"The Providence Journal\" described him as a \"slick devil\".\n\nIn 1992, Payne was cast in his best-known role, opposite Wesley Snipes, as a \"notorious terrorist and hijacker\", with a steely, demonic nerve, named Charles Rane, in \"Passenger 57\". Marcus Trower of \"Empire\" stated that Payne was \"a brilliantly disconcerting madman. With his flowing blond Jesus locks, armour-piercing stare and casual sadism, he makes Hannibal Lecter look like a social worker – and like Anthony Hopkins' serial killer, part of the man's menace is in the apparent contradiction between his articulate, well-spoken English and his off-hand brutality.\" The \"Radio Times\" stated that Payne and Snipes both gave \"charismatic turns\" in the film. \"The New York Times\" stated that Payne brought a 'tongue-in-cheek humor to the psychopathic fiend'. A reviewer for \"People\" magazine stated that \"Bruce Payne steals the plane—and the movie\". In an article for the \"Waterloo Region Record\", Jamie Portman described Payne as a \"suave and cultivated English actor\" playing \"a suave and cultivated killer named Charles Rane\" and suggested that a \"key reason director Kevin Hooks chose him for the role was that he wanted a villain with as much magnetism as the hero\". Payne was described as \"icily perfect as the villainous Rane\" in the Worcester \"Telegram & Gazette\". Julius Marshall stated that Payne was \"ideal for his role: charming, dangerous – the kind of evil genius you love to hate\". The \"Star Tribune\" stated that 'Bruce Payne makes a splendid psychopath, consistently stealing scenes from the likes of Wesley Snipes and Elizabeth Hurley throughout \"Passenger 57\"'.\n\nIn 1993, Payne played a \"charismatic\" werewolf named Adam Garou in \"Full Eclipse\". Joseph Savitski, who reviewed the film for Beyond Hollywood, stated, \"Payne is masterful as Detective Garou, a seductive and evil villain with arrogance and confidence to spare. When he's on screen, Payne demands the attention of the audience, and you're hard pressed to resist his performance. Payne is also the perfect adversary, the kind you're supposed to hate, but who has the charisma to draw you in nonetheless\".\n\nIn 1995, Payne played a \"rogue FBI agent\" named Karl Savak in director Kurt Wimmer's \"One Tough Bastard\". One reviewer described Savak as one of the most 'entertaining movie villains in low budget action flick history' and noted that 'so awesome is Karl Savak that some lunatic has created a Facebook page in his honor'. Another reviewer stated that 'Bruce Payne, with his Whitesnake hair and nose ring is slimeball perfection as the villain'.\nIn 1998, he played Jurgen, a first-class and charismatic operative in season two of \"La Femme Nikita\".\n\nIn 2000, Payne portrayed the villain Jacob Kell in \"\" (2000), the third sequel to the original \"Highlander\" film. One reviewer said of \"Highlander: Endgame\", \"the one in the cast that seems to be having the most fun is Bruce Payne. Traditionally, \"Highlander\" villains give performances that go completely over-the-top and well into the stratosphere. Payne contrarily gives a performance where he enunciates every syllable with relish and dramatic weight, resulting in a performance that is entirely captivating whenever he is on screen.\"\n\nSalon.com's reviewer wrote that \"[Payne] playing Kell as a cockney thug with triple crucifixes embedded in the heels of his Doc Martens, Payne is more fun than either of the stars\". A reviewer for \"Trash City\" stated that \"\"Endgame\" is pretty good, largely thanks to Bruce Payne's efforts as the bad guy, who is right up there with Clancy Brown's original decapitator\", the Kurgan. Marke Andrews, writing for \"The Vancouver Sun\", stated that Payne provided the \"focal point\" in the film and that he dived \"into his role with gusto\". Andrews also stated that Payne's 'facial expressions rival Jim Carrey's in \"The Mask\"'. Cherriece Wright, who reviewed the film for \"The Dispatch\", stated that it contained \"brilliant performances by Christopher Lambert and Bruce Payne\". Wright stated that Payne \"delivers a great performance as Jacob Kell blending smoothly the malicious vindictiveness of the embittered immortal with a sarcastic wit that provides needed humor\".\n\nIn the same year, Payne played Damodar in \"Dungeons & Dragons\", henchman of the malevolent Profion (played by Jeremy Irons). Although the film was critically panned, Payne's performance was reviewed favourably. One reviewer said that \"Bruce Payne (Damodar) as Profion's nefarious assistant in his power-hungry schemes was the stand-out performance of all the actors in the film. Payne has a true lock on how to play a character that is menacing even without any show of power. His portrayal of Damodar calls to mind Doug Bradley's portrayal of Pinhead in the \"Hellraiser\" films, so coldly, coolly arrogant and confident is his character. Above and beyond the grade I give to this film, Payne has earned himself an A+ in my gradebook.\" Another reviewer stated that Payne's performance proved that he is \"one of Hollywood's more reliable villains\".\n\nBranden Chowen, who reviewed the film for \"Indie Pulse\", stated that \"the standout in the film is the man who returns for the sequel: Bruce Payne. His character is written to be one-note throughout, but Payne still manages to create an excellent villain. Once the audience gets past his blue lipstick, which is no small feat, Payne is a formidable and passionate force\". \"The Charlotte Observer\" stated that \"menacing Bruce Payne gives the film's one potent performance\". Abbie Bernstein for \"Audio Video Revolution\" declared that Payne was \"enjoyably evil as the secondary baddie in charge of capturing the rebels\"\n\nIn 2004, Payne appeared as the \"snarling\" Neighbour, who \"dabbles\" in producing kinky virtual games in the dystopian horror mystery \"Paranoia 1.0\". The film was nominated in the best film category at the Sitges - Catalan International Film Festival and at the Sundance Film Festival, and won the best film award at the Malaga International Week of Fantastic Cinema. John Fallon stated that as the Neighbour, Payne \"laid on the charisma and the macho-ness thick\".\n\nIn 2005, Payne returned to the role of Damodar in \"\". Payne was the only member of the original cast in the sequel.\n\nIn 2006, he helped to launch the National Youth Theatre's 50th-anniversary programme along with Sir Ian McKellen, Timothy Spall, Diana Quick, Paula Wilcox, Jonathan Wrather, newsreader Krishnan Guru-Murthy, and \"Little Britain\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Matt Lucas and David Walliams.\n\nIn 2011, Payne appeared in the horror film \"Prowl\" as a \"blatantly untrustworthy\" \"hillbilly truck driver\" named Bernard in the film. Matt Withers, who reviewed the film for JoBlo.com, stated that \"Bruce Payne shows up as a trucker in a throwaway role that he makes anything but\". Payne also appeared in \"Carmen's Kiss\" (an adaptation of the Georges Bizet opera \"Carmen\").\n\nIn 2012, Payne voiced a demon in the found-footage horror film \"Greystone Park\" (also known as \"The Asylum Tapes\").\n\nIn 2013, Payne appeared in the Warner Bros. action film \"Getaway\". Payne also appeared in the action film \"Vendetta\" as a sinister Whitehall Mandarin named Mr. Rooker. One reviewer of the film gave it eight out of ten and stated that Payne 'nearly steals the movie with a plum role as the icy head of British black ops'. In addition, Payne portrayed Auschwitz camp Commandant Rudolf Hoess, in a 'superciliously evil' manner, in the French film \"Victor Young Perez\", which concerns the life of the Tunisian Jew flyweight boxer Victor Perez.\n\nIn 2015, Payne played Winston, a religious fanatic, in the horror film \"Re-Kill\".\n\nIn 2018 Payne appeared in the Anthology film \"London Unplugged\", which premiered at the East End Film Festival.\n\nPayne played the main antagonist in \"\" (which he also produced and acted as assistant director for), which is due to be released in 2020. Payne has also been cast as Frank Warren in \"Michael-The Michael Watson Story\", a biopic of boxer Michael Watson.\n\nMusic Videos\n\n\nTelevision Advertisements\n\n\n"}

KLAX-FM airs a regional Mexican music format branded as \"La Raza\". The station has studios in Los Angeles, and its transmitter is based in Glendale.\n\nThe station began broadcasting on April 22, 1949, holding the call sign KNOB. It originally broadcast at 103.1 MHz and was licensed to Long Beach, California.\n\nOn August 18, 1957, the station switched to an all jazz format, becoming the world's first all-jazz station. It was branded \"The Jazz Knob\". Its owner was Sleepy Stein, who was able to get permission from the Federal Communications Commission for a power increase by switching the frequency to 97.9 in 1958. It broadcast from a studio at their transmitter site atop Signal Hill, near Long Beach Airport. The building and tower remain to this day, though the station has moved away to Flint Peak near Glendale. The station's original high-power transmitter was a Western Electric 10kW that had previously been installed at KNX-FM.\n\nIn 1966, the station was sold to Jeanette Pennino Banoczi and husband Jack Banoczi, owners of the Pennino Music Company, for $262,850. KNOB's studios were moved to Anaheim, California. Later that year, the station switched to an all-request middle of the road (MOR) format, with ethnic programming on Sundays.\n\nKNOB would later air a beautiful music format. In the early 1980s, the station began airing a syndicated MOR format. In September 1985, it adopted a soft adult contemporary \"love songs\" format branded \"For Lovers Only\".\n\nIn 1988, KNOB was sold to Spanish Broadcasting System for $15 million and its call sign was changed to KSKQ-FM.

{"id": "2002393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2002393", "title": "Tayport", "text": "Tayport\n\nTayport, also known as Ferry-Port on Craig, is a town and burgh, and parish, in the county of Fife, Scotland, acting as a commuter town for Dundee. The motto of the Burgh is \"Te oportet alte ferri\" (\"It is incumbent on you to carry yourself high\"), a pun on \"Tayport at auld Tay Ferry\".\n\nTayport lies close to the north east tip of Fife. To the north it looks across the River Tay to Broughty Ferry and Broughty Castle. To the east is the vast Tentsmuir Nature Reserve, an area of forested dunes measuring some 3 km from east to west and 6 km from north to south and edged by wide sands that continue all the way round to the mouth of the River Eden.\n\nThe civil parish of Ferry-Port on Craig has a population of 3,815 (in 2011).\n\nThe settlement was originally called Partan Craig, Gaelic for \"Crab Rock\". Over the following two hundred years English usage eroded many Gaelic place names in eastern Scotland and Partan Craig had become known as Portincragge by 1415 and as Port-in-Craige by the end of the 15th century. In 1598 the settlement received its burgh charter in the name of Ferry-Port on Craig.\n\nIn the 1850s, the Edinburgh, Perth and Dundee Railway Company established a railway service running from Edinburgh to Aberdeen that passed through Ferry-Port on Craig. They used the simpler name of \"Tayport\" for the town. This less cumbersome name soon caught on and over time, Tayport replaced Ferry-Port on Craig as the more common name.\n\nA ferry service across the Tay was already well established when these lands were granted to the newly formed Arbroath Abbey about 1180. The abbey constructed shelter and lodgings for pilgrims making the trip between St Andrews and Arbroath via the ferry and this formed the core of a settlement that steadily grew over the centuries.\n\nAt the time a chapel was built in the early 13th century, Possibly more of an abbey than chapel. The site was excavated in the 1930s or earlier.\n\nFerry-Port on Craig saw a dramatic increase in population at the end of the 18th century when tenants displaced by agricultural improvement and clearances, came to take advantage of jobs in the town's textile and shipbuilding industries. Leisure opportunities also increased. Golf came early to Ferry-Port on Craig, with a course laid out in 1817, despite the efforts of a local farmer, who twice ploughed up the course.\n\nA road to Newport-on-Tay, three miles to the west, with its less weather-prone and better used ferry service to Dundee meant that Ferry-Port on Craig was intermittently without a ferry during the first half of the 19th century. By the 1840s a steam ferry service had resumed between the community and Broughty Ferry. This was acquired, in 1851, by the Edinburgh, Perth and Dundee Railway which used the route for a railway ferry service from Edinburgh to Aberdeen.\n\nThe rail ferry ceased operation in 1878 with the opening of the Tay Rail Bridge, only to resume operations the following year when the bridge collapsed. With the opening of the replacement bridge in 1887 Tayport returned to a passenger-only ferry, which continued to run from the town to Broughty Ferry until 1920.\n\nThe opening of the Tay Road Bridge in 1966 put Tayport within a few minutes' drive of the centre of Dundee, and it has since evolved into a pleasant dormitory town for that city. Some industry remains, but the harbour is now given over almost wholly to leisure craft, and attractive new housing has been built where once railway carriages were manoeuvered onto ferries.\n\nReminders of Tayport's earlier life and identity remain. In the centre of the town is Ferry-Port on Craig Church, established in 1607 and rebuilt in 1794 and again 1825, though Protestant worship now takes place in Tayport Parish Church, built in 1843 as Ferry-Port on Craig Free Church. There is also a Catholic church (part of the Diocese of Dunkeld), appropriately named Our Lady, Star of the Sea in the community.\n\nAmenities include several cafes and pubs, shops, a caravan park, tennis club, bowling club, an 18-hole golf course (Scotscraig Golf Club) and large areas of parkland, namely the East and West Common.\n\nCar boot sales are held every second Sunday from April to September at The Canniepairt\n\nBottlenosed dolphins visit the Tay from March to September, and can be observed at very close quarters from Tayport harbour. Tayport harbour is also a good place for fishing although swimming is dangerous due to currents.\n\nTentsmuir is a popular, extensive pine forest planted on the sand dunes at the mouth of the River Tay; there is a wide variety of plants, wildlife and architectural heritage.\n\nThe area of 3,700 acres (15 km²), was acquired by the Forestry Commission in the 1920s and planted predominantly with Scots and Corsican pine. In addition to commercial forestry, careful management has created an interesting mixture of open spaces, ponds, trees, and sand dunes that are rich in wildlife including three species of roosting bat.\n\nSeveral forest walks begin at the Kinshaldy car park and picnic site, and of special interest is the 19th-century ice house and pond built to keep locally-caught salmon fresh. The Kinshaldy beach area includes a former icehouse and World War II fortifications. Extensive views over sand dunes to the North Sea and St. Andrews. The beach area, known as Tentsmuir Sands, was included in the Marine Conservation Society's Good Beach Guide 2003, which means that it is included in the list of Scotland's 32 cleanest beaches.\n\nThe area of Tentsmuir Point is included amongst the 73 National Nature Reserves in Scotland, which are areas of land set aside where the main purpose of management is the conservation of habitats and species of national and international significance.\n\nThis large area of sand dunes and beach at the mouth of the Tay Estuary forms an important roosting and feeding area for huge congregations of seaduck, waders and wildfowl, as well as a haul-out area for over 2,000 both common and grey seals. The reserve's grassland and dunes are especially favoured by a wide variety of colourful butterflies.\n\nIn prehistoric times, the district around Tayport was inhabited by Neolithic settlers, whose clay pottery and finely-wrought stone arrowheads have been found in considerable quantities on Tentsmuir, (once an area of heath and moorland, and now owned by the Forestry Commission). These settlers had not learned how to use metals and did not practise agriculture, but lived by hunting and fishing. The sites of some of the early settlements have been located by large collections of shells and, although nothing remains of their homes (probably primitive turf huts) one of their boats, a hollowed-out tree trunk, was found in a sandbank near Newburgh, further up the Tay, and is on display in Dundee Museum, which keeps a good collection of Neolithic artefacts.\n\nTentsmuir has also been the site of dozens of exiting Bronze Age finds; implements and ornaments made by the Celts who moved into the district, have been discovered near the remains of iron-smelting sites.\n\nFor over a century the game of football has been a major influence in most communities in Scotland; Tayport is no exception.\n\nFrom Victorian times, through to the Second World War, the town had at least one football club. We know that Tayport had a Junior club pre-First World War, winning the East of Fife Cup in 1905, for example. The Great War in 1914 effectively signalled the demise of junior level football in the town for seventy five years.\n\nThroughout the 1920s and 1930s, there were various amateur clubs, but success was fleeting and there are few records. After the Second World War the town's football club was called Tayport Violet. In 1947 a new club emerged when Tayport Amateurs was formed by locals who had been playing friendlies as a senior boy scouts team; this was the birth of the club we know today.\n\nThe Amateurs team joined the Midlands Amateurs’ Alliance League, which was essentially for clubs’ reserve XIs, whilst Violet played in the Midlands’ top division. In 1950, the Midlands Amateur Football Association reorganised and both teams found themselves in division two. They finished the season in 1st and 2nd spots respectively. After promotion, 1952-53 saw Violet and the Amateurs finish 2nd and 3rd in the first division; however, Violet was disbanded after this season.\n\nAt the invitation of Tayport Town Council, in 1975, the Amateurs moved to the Canniepairt. Clubrooms were constructed which, over the years (like the ground) were improved in order to provide the accommodation which both the club and wider community now enjoy.\n\nIn 1980, the club which, since 1953 had run an Alliance, or Reserve XI, started a third team – the Fife XI - which was to enjoy eleven successful seasons in the East Fife Amateur Association and for one season, in the Kingdom Caledonian League.\n\nIn 1990, the club's junior team was launched and the name of the club became ‘Tayport Football Club’, a name which could embrace both amateur and junior grades. The 2000-2001 season was the club's last in the Amateurs Leagues.\n\nTayport FC have enjoyed great success since 1990 including being OVD Scottish Junior Cup Winners in 1995/96, 2002/03 and 2004/05 (website www.tayportfc.org)\n\n Scotscraig Golf Club is the 13th oldest golf club in the world.\n\nTowards the end of the Napoleonic Wars (1799–1815) some of the members of the St Andrews Society of Golfers – later to become the Royal and Ancient Golf Club – began to play golf more regularly than the Society's infrequent meetings afforded.\n\nAmongst them was Mr. William Dalgleish of Scotscraig, whose lands included an area known as the Garpit, around part of which ran a racecourse (although there is no record of any racing, the course is carefully marked out on early ordnance survey maps). In the centre of this area, golf was played over six holes, before the club was created in August 1817.\n\nThe original rules, adopted at the first annual meeting in Scotscraig House in October 1818, dictated that a uniform would be worn: a red coat with a green velvet collar and a badge on the left breast. This was not merely fashion but a requirement; those appearing without uniform did so under a penalty of two bottles of port!\n\nAn annual competition for gold and silver medals was held until 1854, when the club was closed, as disaster struck when the course was ploughed by the farmer who had come to own the land. Around 1886 the Scotscraig Estate, on which the club had been situated, passed into the hands of Vice Admiral William Heriot-Maitland-Dougall who was keen on golf. In 1887 he instigated the club's revival, restored the trophies and helped secure a course; it was re-opened for play in 1888, and by 1890 had been laid out as a nine-hole course. The club house was erected in 1896.\n\nIn 1904 more land was acquired, and an 18-hole course was laid out, incorporating the original nine holes. It is considered a particular advantage that the ninth hole is hear the clubhouse, so that elderly players and those who cannot spare the time for the full round of 18 holes can play on either half.\n\nThe grounds were acquired by the club in 1923.\n\nAt the foot of Nelson Street there is a factory which was erected by Messrs Scott & Fyfe about the same time as the spinning mill (). The cloth woven was chiefly of jute, but at one time linen goods were also made. This factory was extended many times and gave a considerable amount of work to the women of the town.\n\nThe machinery consisted of 140 looms of various breadths, with complete equipment for winding, preparing, dressing, and cropping operations.\n\nThe Donaldson Group, which comprises Donaldson Timber Engineering Ltd, James Donaldson Timber Ltd, MGM Timber Ltd and Parker Kislingbury Ltd, began in 1860, when James Donaldson started selling timber from Tayport in Fife.\nIn the last 150 years, James Donaldson & Sons Ltd has grown to become one of the UK’s leading independent processors, manufacturers and distributors of timber and engineered timber products. From one small branch in Fife, Donaldson’s has become a nationwide group with 21 operating branches across the UK.\n\nIn the early part of the 19th Century, there were four small schools in Tayport: two were for boys and two for girls. When the provisions of the Education Act 1870 were extended to Scotland, a school was built which could accommodate all the children of the community; the present building was opened in 1875, and was extended as the population increased.\n\nInitially the school ran both a primary and secondary programme, although the infants were accommodated at the building which is now Ferryport Nursery on William Street.\n\nIn 1967, when junior secondary schools were closed, Tayport became a primary school and the older pupils were sent to Madras College in St. Andrews or Bell Baxter High School in Cupar.\n\nOn 7 May 1975 the school held an open evening to celebrate its centenary. An exhibition called ‘Grandfather's School Days’ was borrowed from the Albert Institute in Dundee, and many old photographs and mementos loaned by former pupils were put on display.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2002403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2002403", "title": "Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers", "text": "Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers\n\nHalloween: The Curse of Michael Myers (also known as Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers, Halloween 666: The Curse of Michael Myers, Halloween 666, or simply Halloween 6) is a 1995 American slasher film directed by Joe Chappelle and written by Daniel Farrands. The film stars Donald Pleasence in his final film appearance, Paul Rudd, and Marianne Hagan. It is the sixth installment in the \"Halloween\" film series. The film follows Michael Myers as he stalks the Strode family, cousins of Laurie Strode, while Dr. Sam Loomis pursues Michael Myers once more. The film reveals the source of Michael Myers's immortality and his drive to kill.\n\nShot in Salt Lake City in the winter of 1994–95, it underwent a series of reshoots after it performed poorly with test audiences. The film was distributed by Dimension Films. It was released on September 29, 1995, grossed $15.1 million at the domestic box office on a budget of $5 million, and received largely negative reviews from critics. Donald Pleasence died on February 2, 1995, nearly eight months before the film was released. The film was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAfter the film's home media release, the original workprint of the film, which featured 45 minutes of alternative footage and a different ending, was discovered by fans of the series. This version, dubbed The \"Producer's Cut\", developed a cult following, with bootleg DVD copies sold on eBay and online petitions targeting for an official release of it. In 2014, the \"Producer's Cut\" was officially released on Blu-ray. It was followed by \"\" (1998), three years later.\n\nOn October 31, 1989, Michael Myers and his niece Jamie Lloyd are abducted from the Haddonfield Police Station. Six years later, on October 30, 1995, Jamie has been impregnated and her infant is born, being taken away by the \"Man in Black\", the leader of a Druid-like cult. Later, a midwife helps Jamie escape with her baby, but she is killed by Michael. Jamie and her baby flee in a stolen pick-up truck, with Michael in pursuit. Meanwhile, Dr. Sam Loomis has retired and moved to a cabin on the outskirts of Haddonfield, where he lives as a hermit. He is visited by his friend Dr. Terence Wynn, the chief administrator of Smith's Grove Sanitarium, where Michael had been incarcerated as a boy; Wynn asks Loomis to return to Smith's Grove. They overhear Jamie's plea for help on a local radio station, when she makes a call to Loomis, only to be ignored by the radio D.J. Barry Simms. Michael catches up with Jamie, and she crashes the truck into an old barn. He kills Jamie, but finds that her baby is not in the truck.\n\nIn Haddonfield, Tommy Doyle, whom Laurie Strode babysat in 1978, now lives in a boarding house run by Mrs. Blankenship. Tommy is a reclusive individual who has become obsessed with finding the truth behind Michael's motives. The dysfunctional family living in the Myers house across the street are relatives of the Strode family: Kara Strode, her six-year-old son Danny, her teenage brother Tim, caring mother Debra, and abusive father John. Tommy finds Jamie's baby at the bus station, takes him into his care, and names him Steven. Tommy runs into Loomis and tells him about the Strode family living in the Myers house. Meanwhile, Michael returns to Haddonfield, where he stalks Kara, before killing Debra.\n\nLater, Tommy, Kara, and Danny go to the boarding house, where Tommy reveals that he believes Michael has been inflicted with \"Thorn\", an ancient Druid curse. Long ago, one child from each tribe, chosen to bear the curse of Thorn, must sacrifice its next of kin on the night of Samhain, or Halloween. Tommy believes that Steven will be Michael's final sacrifice. Later that night, while Tommy goes out to look for Loomis, Mrs. Blankenship reveals to Kara that she was babysitting Michael the night he killed his sister, and that Danny is hearing a voice telling him to kill just like Michael did, indicating Danny also possesses the power of Thorn. Meanwhile, Michael kills John, Tim, Tim's girlfriend Beth, and Barry Simms. Danny and Kara manage to escape back to the boarding house where Tommy and Loomis are waiting.\n\nThe cult arrives at the boarding house, where it is revealed that Mrs. Blankenship is a cult member and the Man in Black is Dr. Wynn. The cult drugs Loomis and Tommy and take Kara, Danny, and Steven to Smith's Grove. Kara is locked in a maximum security ward while the boys are kept in an operating room. Loomis confronts Wynn, who reveals that the staff at Smith's Grove have been working with the Thorn cult to study the power of Thorn and learn how to control it. Steven is implied to be the successful result of experiments to clone Michael's pure evil, and the cult plans to use Danny and Kara to create another one. Wynn wants Loomis to join in on his conspiracy, as he was the first one to see the evil inside Michael. Loomis refuses and is knocked out by a cult member.\n\nTommy frees Kara as Michael pursues them through the sanitarium. They find Wynn and his team, who are about to perform a medical procedure on Danny and Steven. Michael suddenly appears and turns against Wynn and the doctors, killing them all. Tommy and Kara rescue the kids and Michael chases them into a laboratory, where Kara notices fetuses from Wynn's failed experiments. Tommy injects Michael with corrosives and beats him unconscious with a lead pipe. Tommy, Kara, and the children leave Smith's Grove while Loomis stays behind to take care of business. Inside, Michael's mask lies alone on the lab floor, and Loomis screams in the background, leaving their fates unknown.\n\nBoth Danielle Harris and Don Shanks reappear as Jaime Lloyd and Michael Myers / Man in Black, respectively, in a flashback portrayed by an unused scene from the previous installment where it shows how exactly Jamie was held captive; it's revealed that the Man in Black kidnapped Jamie while she witnesses Michael being supposedly taken away by a police force. A scene at the beginning was filmed where Michael rapes Jamie and impregnates her. In the scene where Michael kills Jamie, a scene was shot where she survives the attack, but is later killed in hospital by Wynn.\n\nAfter the less than enthusiastic response to \"\" which came out only a year after \"\", producer Moustapha Akkad put the series on hold to re-evaluate its potential. Akkad felt \"Halloween 5\" had strayed too far from \"Halloween 4\" and the box office response was much lower than expected. In 1990, screenwriter and long-time \"Halloween\" fan Daniel Farrands set out to write the sixth entry in the \"Halloween\" series. Farrands gave his horror film scripts to the producer of \"Halloween 5\", Ramsey Thomas; impressed by his writing, Thomas set a meeting for Farrands with executive producer Moustapha Akkad. Farrands described the meeting:\n\nAlthough the producers at the time had already sought to make a sixth \"Halloween\" film, a series of complicated legal battles ensued which delayed plans for a sequel; eventually Miramax Films (via its Dimension Films division) bought the rights to the \"Halloween\" series.\n\nIn June 1994, after several screenplays from different writers had been deemed insufficient by Akkad (including one by Scott Spiegel), Farrands was hired to write a new screenplay, as the film had an impending shooting date scheduled for October in Salt Lake City, Utah. Farrands has said his initial intent for the film was to \"bridge the later films (4–5) in the series to the earlier films (1–2) while at the same time taking the story into new territory so that the series could expand for future installments.\" This in part meant expanding on the presence of the \"Man in Black\" as well as the appearance of the Thorn symbol, both of which appear without explanation at the end of \"Halloween 5\". In beginning the script, Farrands contacted the writers of \"Halloween 4\" and \"5\" for additional information, but they were unable to provide clear answers, leaving him to \"pick up the pieces.\"\n\nFarrands expanded the \"Curse of Thorn\" plot line, in which Jamie Lloyd is kidnapped by a covert cult who has cursed Michael Myers via the Runic symbol of Thorn, which compels him to kill and also affords him immortality. Farrands had in part based the idea on dialogue present in \"Halloween II\" (1981) about the night of Samhain, during which the \"veil between the living and the dead is thinnest,\" the one time of the year during which Myers became \"active, and seeks out his bloodline.\" References to Druidism as well as Myers's grandfather \"hearing voices\" had also appeared in the 1978 novelization of \"Halloween\" by Curtis Richards. While the character of Jamie Lloyd dies early in the film, the initial versions of Farrands' script had her character surviving until the final act, at which point she was ultimately killed by Michael. Other elements of Farrands' working script that ultimately had to be trimmed down included an extension of the Curse of Thorn subplot, which had the entire town of Haddonfield in collusion with the cult, an idea Akkad wanted to use for the series' seventh installment. However, this idea was scrapped in favor of the \"\" script in 1997.\n\nAccording to Farrands, there were around ten different drafts of his script between June 1994 and the October 1994 film shoot, and much of the finale that appears in the theatrical version (including the events at the hospital, as well as the references to the cult using Myers's power as a means of scientific investigation), was not written by him, and had been written and shot in post-production under the supervision of Dimension Films.\n\nFarrands compares Tommy's arc in that film to Laurie Strode's in \"Halloween H20\": that of a traumatized victim who must stop running and face their worst fear. He claims that this was supposed to be more obvious, with flashbacks to the original film, but the development of the film resulted in many of those scenes being lost. Farrands says that he brought Tommy back as a way of bridging the gap between the sequels and the first film. His intent was for Tommy to be the successor to Dr. Loomis, to act as a \"voice of sanity...a kind of modern Van Helsing, the fearless Michael hunter!\", a role he believed was missing from \"H20\" and \"\".\n\nOriginally, Kara's fate varied in various script drafts. In the first draft, Kara is murdered by her son Danny in the Haddonfield Bus Depot, while the near final draft had the film ending with Tommy and Kara driving away. The film as released ends with Kara and Tommy driving off with the children, Danny and Stephen.\n\nFarrands describes Michael as a \"sexual deviant\". According to him, the way Michael follows girls around and watches them contains a subtext of repressed sexuality. Farrands theorizes that, as a child, Michael became fixated on the murder of his sister Judith, and for his own twisted reasons felt the need to repeat that action over and over again, finding a sister-like figure in Laurie who excited him sexually. He also believes that by making Laurie Michael's literal sister, the sequels took away from the simplicity and relatability of the original \"Halloween\". Nevertheless, when writing \"Curse\", Farrands was tasked with creating a mythology for Michael which defined his motives and why he could not be killed. He says, \"He can't just be a man anymore, he's gone beyond that. He's mythical. He's supernatural. So, I took it from that standpoint that there's something else driving him. A force that goes beyond that five senses that has infected this boy's soul and now is driving him.\" As the script developed and more people became involved, Farrands admits that the film went too far in explaining Michael Myers and that he himself was not completely satisfied with the finished product.\n\nFarrands, a long-time fan of the series, sought to incorporate various references and allusions to the previous \"Halloween\" films, particularly the original, to play with the \"\"Halloween\" mythology.\" These range from situational allusions, such as Tommy Doyle living across the street from the Strode house (a play on the events in the original \"Halloween\", which take place between the Wallace and Doyle residences, which are across the street from one another) to minor references, such as the naming of an address from \"Halloween II\" (1981), and the character of Mrs. Blankenship, a name referred to in passing in \"\" (1982). Other references outside the narrative diegeses of the series include the names of characters, such as John and Debra Strode (referencing John Carpenter and Debra Hill), as well as the naming of Danny Strode, a character Farrands has said was modeled after Danny Torrance in \"The Shining\" (1980).\n\nFarrands also referenced Carpenter's \"The Fog\" (1980) with the line referring to a \"stomach pounder\" (a protein milkshake Tim drinks early in the film), and Beth's murder scene was modeled after a scene from Fred Walton's \"When a Stranger Calls\" (1979) (Farrands wrote the scene upon hearing that Walton had been attached to direct the project, though Walton would eventually drop out of the production). Additionally, extended scenes of Kara walking on the college campus and en route to her home were intended to allude to scenes featuring Laurie Strode in the first film, while Danny dropping his pumpkin while walking home alludes to a scene in the first film in which a group of bullies force Tommy to drop his pumpkin outside the elementary school.\n\nDonald Pleasence returned to play Dr. Loomis, in what would be one of his final film performances; according to Farrands, Pleasence was fond of the script. Danielle Harris, who was seventeen at the time, contacted producer Paul Freeman about reprising her role as Jamie Lloyd, and went so far as completing paperwork to become legally emancipated in order to shoot the film. She was officially cast in the role, but Dimension Films could not come to an agreement over her salary; Harris alleges that Dimension offered her a scaled $1,000 to shoot the part over the course of a week, which was less than the amount of money she had paid for her emancipation. Farrands and Freeman both had wanted Harris for the part, but at that point \"had their hands tied.\"\n\nAccording to Harris, the head of the casting department refused to negotiate her salary, stating that she was a \"scale character who dies in the first twenty minutes.\" This ultimately led to her dropping out of the project. \"People automatically assume I wanted some crazy amount of money, or something,\" Harris commented in 2014, \"[but] it's not like I [was] demanding of anything, really ... When you've been asked to do something and then they insult you by saying, \"You're a piece of shit, you die in the first act—I don't give a fuck that you were in two other \"Halloween\" movies, who cares?\"... I was in shock.\" Actress J. C. Brandy was cast as Harris's replacement.\n\nThe producers initially wanted Brian Andrews to reprise his role as Tommy Doyle. However, with Andrews not having an agent, they were unable to contact him. Paul Rudd was cast in the part of Tommy, which marked his first starring role before he appeared in \"Clueless\" (1995). The leading female role, Kara, was given to Marianne Hagan; however, Hagan has since stated that Miramax executives Bob and Harvey Weinstein did not favor her for the part, and made aesthetic criticisms about her being \"too thin\" and her chin being \"too pointy\". Farrands, however, had wanted Hagan for the part because he felt she possessed an \"every-girl\" quality of having \"lived a little, and had a hard time,\" and likened her screen presence to that of Jamie Lee Curtis.\n\nFor the role of Dr. Terence Wynn, Mitchell Ryan was cast, based on his performance in \"Lethal Weapon\" (1987); Farrands originally urged the producers to cast Christopher Lee, having had the veteran horror actor in mind when writing the character. This is a reference on Carpenter's initial choice for role of Dr. Loomis during film making of Halloween from 1978 where he was offered that role, but declined due to low pay, only later to regret in later years. Denise Richards also auditioned for the part of Beth, but the studio passed on her, giving the role to Mariah O'Brien. Stunt performer George P. Wilbur, who portrayed Michael in the , reprised his role as Michael Myers. However, once reshoots took place, Wilbur was replaced by A. Michael Lerner as director Joe Chapelle found Wilbur to be \"too bulky.\"\n\nFred Walton (director of \"When a Stranger Calls\" and \"April Fool's Day\") was originally attached to direct the film but dropped out. Special effects artist John Carl Buechler created the mask for the film, which was based heavily on the mask featured in the poster for \"Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers\". Buechler hand-crafted the mask over actor George P. Wilbur's face.\n\nFilming began in late October 1994 in Salt Lake City, Utah. Within the first week of shooting, however, the city experienced an early winter snowstorm, which complicated the production. As a result, several scenes which were supposed to take place on exterior locations had to be transferred to interiors. The original hospital scenes were shot at the abandoned Old Primary Children's Hospital in The Avenues section of Salt Lake City.\n\nProducer Paul Freeman and director Chappelle reportedly rewrote the ending on-set, even from shot-to-shot as production deadlines loomed. Freeman also sent the crew home when crucial scenes needed to be shot; deleted scripted scenes indiscriminately; rewrote dialogue and action sequences; and assumed the responsibility of directing second-unit shots and the supervision of post-production of the original cut. These complications resulted in Dimension Films' parent company (and the film's co-production company) Miramax, taking over the film's production, and ordering many of the reworked sequences to be reshot.\n\nAssociated producer Malek Akkad explained the film's lack of a cohesive \"vision\" being the result of director Chappelle \"answering\" to the visions of the distributor, Dimension Films; Moustapha Akkad's production company, Nightfall Productions; and writer Daniel Farrands. Tensions between what Dimension, Nightfall, and Farrands envisioned for the film resulted in a finished product that had needed \"more forethought,\" according to Akkad.\n\nIn early 1995, after filming and editing was completed, \"Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers\" was given a test screening in New York City which, as described by actress Marianne Hagan, \"consisted primarily of fourteen-year-old boys.\" During the Q&A afterward, one of the audience members expressed great displeasure at the ending of the film, which entailed a Celtic ritual and the passing on of the \"Curse of Thorn\" to the Dr. Loomis character. As a result of the audience's disapproval toward the film's finale, the movie was rushed back into production, this time without Donald Pleasence, who died on February 2, 1995. Pleasence had been in ill health during the shooting of the film.\n\nReshoots took place in Los Angeles, California in the summer of 1995. A. Michael Lerner replaced George P. Wilbur in the role of Michael Myers, as the studio executives wanted him to appear less bulky. This resulted in continuity error as the last third of the film features a slimmer Myers. However, Wilbur makes a cameo appearance as a doctor who is killed by Myers in the finale. Some of the additional footage incorporated into the finale of the film was shot at Queen of Angels Hospital in Los Angeles.\n\nIn addition to the re-shoots prompted by the poor test screening, the film also underwent significant editing in post-production, resulting in brisker pacing and a \"flashier\" cinematic style that favored \"blood and guts,\" but, according to Farrands, ultimately resulted in a \"more confusing\" movie. According to writer Farrands, the stylized flash cuts prominent in the final theatrical cut of \"Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers\" were not originally intended, and he likened the style of the final product to an \"MTV video rather than a \"Halloween\" film.\" Composer Alan Howarth similarly called the final product a \"fix job,\" with numerous elements of the production being in flux both during and after principal photography. In addition to Howarth's score being redone, the film's sound design was also significantly altered from Howarth's original \"minimalist\" design.\n\nThe original music score is composed by long-time \"Halloween\" contributor Alan Howarth, his work in the series dating back to his collaboration with John Carpenter on \"Halloween II\". However, Howarth's score was redone by music editor Paul Rabjohns when the film went through reshoots. A soundtrack album was released by Varèse Sarabande, and is an unusual combination of the music featured in the original cut of the film, as well as that of the final theatrical cut. According to Howarth, he helped re-score the revised cut of the film, incorporating the use of guitar and drums in addition to the original score, which had been more synthesizer and piano-based. Howarth's official score for the film was released on CD October 24, 1995.\n\nThe music of Alabama-based rock band Brother Cane was featured throughout the movie. The music came from their 1995 release \"Seeds\" on Virgin Records. The album's hit single \"And Fools Shine On\" can be heard when Kara, Tim and Beth arrive at school in their car. The song is also heard during the closing credits. Three other Brother Cane songs (all from the \"Seeds\" album) are featured in the film: \"Hung on a Rope\", \"20/20 Faith\", and \"Horses & Needles\". \"Disconnected\" by the group I Found God is also featured in the film.\n\nTrack listing\nThe film's troubled production resulted in two cuts of the film, which prompted a legal battle between the film's production company, Nightfall, who wanted to release the original cut, and its distributor, Dimension Films, who had incorporated reshoots and additional material. Ultimately, Dimension Films won the dispute, and their cut of the film was officiated for theatrical release.\n\nAn earlier teaser trailer of the film employed the title Halloween 666: The Origin of Michael Myers, which according to Daniel Farrands, came before an official title had been decided, and that the trailer title was a combination of an earlier script titled \"The Origin of Michael Myers\" by another writer, and Farrands' original script titled \"Halloween 666\". At one point, executive producer Moustapha Akkad asked Farrands for a title, who suggested \"The Curse of Michael Myers\" due to the troubled production. Although Farrands's comment was in jest, Akkad took the name to heart and decided upon it. Farrands also added that this coincidentally made the subtitles similar to those in \"The Pink Panther\" films, which also used \"Return\", \"Revenge\", and \"Curse\" subtitles as \"Halloween\"s fourth, fifth and sixth films, respectively.\n\n\"Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers\" was released on September 29, 1995 in the United States, and brought in a $7,308,529 opening weekend gross, coming in second to serial killer thriller \"Seven\", being the first film in the series to be on par with \"Halloween II\"s opening weekend gross (both \"Halloween 4\" and \"5\" had earned under $7 million). The film went on to gross a total of $15,116,634 at the U.S. box office, from an estimated $5 million budget.\n\nThe film was not screened by critics. It has a 6% approval rating and an average rating of 2.71/10, based on 34 reviews, on the internet review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. The sites critical consensus states \"\"Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers\" trades the simple, brutal effectiveness of the original for convoluted mysticism, with disastrously dull results.\" On Metacritic, the film holds a 10/100 based on 13 reviews, signifying as \"overwhelming dislike\".\n\nDaniel Kimmel of \"Variety\" called the film \"tired\" and \"run-of-the-mill\", while Mick LaSalle of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" said the film lacked suspense and said that \"not even the presence of the late, gloriously histrionic Donald Pleasence can liven things up,\" deeming it \"bland\", \"deadening\", and \"by far the worst in the series.\"\n\nStephen Holden of \"The New York Times\" called the film's script \"impossibly convoluted\", and wrote that \"shock effects are applied with such hamfisted regularity that they quickly backfire.\" Josh Hartl of \"The Seattle Times\" criticized the film's conventionality, writing: \"instead of sending up the current glut of serial-killer movies, the filmmakers trot out the old slasher tactics.\" Jack Mathews of the \"Los Angeles Times\" similarly criticized the film's lack of originality, comparing it negatively to its predecessors.\n\nRichard Harrington of \"The Washington Post\" also criticized the script, writing: \"While director Joe Chapelle and writer Daniel Farrands took advantage of a clearance sale at the Horror Cliche Emporium, they forgot to stop in at Plots R Us.\" The \"Time Out London\" film guide deemed the film \"A series of competently engineered shock moments jollied along by a jazzed-up version of John Carpenter's original electronic score: slicker than crude oil and just as unattractive.\"\n\nThe film was first released for home media on VHS on October 7, 1996 from Buena Vista Home Entertainment. A DVD followed on October 10, 2000. In January 2010, the film was released for the first time on Blu-ray in Canada from Alliance Films alongside \"\" and \"\" with no bonus material. The film was released on Blu-ray and again on DVD in the United States on May 10, 2011 by Echo Bridge Home Entertainment, once again with no bonus features.\n\nAnchor Bay Entertainment and Shout! Factory once again released the film on Blu-ray on September 23, 2014 as a part of their 15-disc box set containing the entire series. This release also contained extensive bonus features, such as a commentary from writer Daniel Farrands and composer Alan Howarth, interviews with producers Malek Akkad and Paul Freeman, actresses Marian O'Brien, J. C. Brandy, and Danielle Harris, George P. Wilbur, makeup artists John Carl Buechler and Brad Hardin, as well as Howarth, in addition to deleted scenes and archival behind-the-scenes footage and interviews, and a tribute to Donald Pleasence. Lionsgate released yet another standalone Blu-ray on September 15, 2015 containing \"The Producer's Cut\", but without any of the bonus features featured on the 15-disc release.\n\nWhile the film was initially released on VHS in Australia with a rating of MA15+, the DVD was not released until October 8, 2014, with no extras.\n\n\"Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers\" is notorious among \"Halloween\" fans for having multiple versions. The \"Producer's Cut\" is the best known; however, a Director's Cut also exists with footage cut by the MPAA. The theatrical version was the only version commercially available—with the Director and \"Producer\"s cuts existing as low-quality bootlegs—until the \"Producer's Cut\" was included in the official \"Complete Collection\" box set released by Scream Factory and Anchor Bay Entertainment in 2014.\n\nThe original cut of the film that screened for test audiences prior to the reshoots became known colloquially as \"The Producer's Cut\", and bootlegged copies of it surfaced among film collectors. This cut of \"Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers\" features numerous differences, ranging from different scores and musical cues to substantial shifts in plot, particularly regarding the film's conclusion. In a retrospective interview, Farrands noted that the finale in this cut of the film was sufficiently \"creepy\" and \"Gothic,\" but conceded that it lacked intensity, which is largely what prompted Dimension Films to begin reshoots. \"The Producer's Cut\" of the film garnered a cult following, according to writer Farrands: \"It's amazing the life that [\"Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers\"] has continued to have because there is this alternate version that has been, kind of in-the-vault all these years.\"\n\nIn the finale of \"The Producer's Cut\", Kara awakens at Smith's Grove Sanitarium on a concrete slab, surrounded by the cult's members, including Mrs. Blankenship, Wynn's secretary Dawn, the bus depot man, and Sheriff Holdt. Wynn conducts a ceremony in which Michael will kill Steven as a final sacrifice of innocent blood, after which the curse will pass on to Danny with Kara as his first sacrifice. Kara realizes that Steven is a product of incest between Jamie and Michael, and uses this to try to convince Michael not to kill the baby. Tommy holds Wynn hostage, forcing the cult to free Kara, and they run with the children through the sanitarium until they reach a locked gate. Tommy uses the power of the ancient runes to stop Michael in his tracks, and Loomis helps the group escape. Later, after telling the others he has unfinished business, Loomis walks back into the sanitarium to find Michael lying on the floor of the main hallway. Upon removing the mask, Loomis finds Dr. Wynn, with whom Michael switched clothes and then escaped. Wynn dies, but not before passing on the Thorn symbol, which appears Loomis' wrist; realizing now that he himself is now to act as the leader of the cult, Loomis screams in despair (this is heard as ambient noise in the final frame of the theatrical cut).\n\nAnother substantial difference in \"The Producer's Cut\" is the death of Jamie Lloyd: she does not die at the beginning of the film, but survives being stabbed by Michael in the barn. She remains in a coma and is taken to the hospital, where Loomis and Wynn visit her. Midway through the film, a \"Gothic\" montage occurs, which reveals in fragmented detail the conception of Jamie's child among the cult. After the sequence, an unseen person, later revealed to be Wynn, shoots the unconscious Jamie in the head with a silenced pistol. Additionally, John's death scene in \"The Producer's Cut\" was shorter; in the theatrical cut, an additional shot (completed during the reshoots) was incorporated of his head graphically exploding from an electrical power surge. Other various transitional shots throughout \"The Producer's Cut\" version were extracted or truncated in the theatrical cut.\n\n\"The Producer's Cut\" remained officially unreleased for nearly 20 years. It had its first public exhibition on October 27, 2013 at the New Beverly Cinema in Los Angeles. Screenwriter Farrands was present for a short Q&A, in which he stressed that there was still a major push in the works to get this version a proper release. He also said that the studio allowing this version to be screened in public for the first time, and the overwhelmingly positive response, were both huge steps in the right direction. Anchor Bay Media and Scream Factory gave the producers cut an official release on Blu-ray in September 2014.\n\nA few select scenes from the Producer's Cut can be seen in the television version of the film. The scenes were re-inserted to increase the running time of the film.\n\n\n"}

It is a small and perfect example of Neo-Classical architecture, situated in the gardens of Marino House. Although proud of the design, Chambers was never able to visit the completed building, as he was constantly employed in England.\n\nThe name 'Casino' is the diminutive form of the 18th-century Italian word 'Casa' meaning 'House', thus 'Little House', and is not used in the modern sense of \"gambling establishment\". After his 9-year Grand Tour of Italy and Greece, Caulfield was taken with all things Italian, and decided to add a 'little house' to his estate, which he had already named after the town of Marino in Lazio.\n\nWidely regarded as the most important Neo-Classical building in Ireland, the Casino is actually quite small, measuring only fifty feet square to the outer columns. In plan, it takes the form of a Greek Cross with a pair of columns framing each projecting elevation. Seen from the outside, the building has the appearance of a single roomed structure, with a large panelled door on the north elevation and a single large window on each of the other elevations. This is all illusion, however, as it actually contains 16 rooms on three floors. Only two of the panels in the door open to allow entrance, and the panes of glass in the windows are subtly curved, disguising the partitioning which allows what looks like a single window to serve several separate rooms.\n\nMany other tricks are used throughout the construction to preserve the apparent simplicity of the design. Four of the columns which surround the building are hollow and, with a length of chain dangling in each, allow rainwater to drain down. The Roman funerary urns on the roof (designed by James Gandon) are used as chimneys. The interior, by Simon Vierpyl, includes a basement level with a kitchen and associated rooms, a main floor with reception rooms and a top storey with servants' rooms and a State Bedroom. One of the rooms includes the Blue Salon. It includes a wooden parquet floor, with the Star of David in the centre, stucco work on the ceiling and a white marble fireplace. It contains some very fine plasterwork ceilings and some elaborate hardwood parquet floors. Originally the Casino was linked to Marino House by a tunnel, although this has been blocked off due to building works in the area.\n\nThe Casino is all that remains of the eighteenth-century garden demesne at Marino with the original Marino House demolished in the 1920s. Described by Charles T. Bowden in his Travel Guide of 1791 as a 'terrestrial paradise', the design of the landscape was inspired by Lord Charlemont's extensive Grand Tour.\n\nThe tunnel at the Casino was used as a shooting range by Irish revolutionaries including Michael Collins in the 1920s.\n"}

Catel deferred the matter and suggested the father write directly to Hitler for permission. Hitler subsequently sent Dr. Karl Brandt to confer with Catel and decide on a course of action. On July 25, 1939 the child was killed. \n\nThe T4 program was influenced by a popular book, \"Allowing the destruction of life unworthy of living\", written in 1920 by Alfred Hoche and Karl Binding. Catel as part of this programme was probably influenced by it too. In his 1962 publication, \"Grenzsituation des Lebens\" (Border situations of life), Catel argued for the reintroduction of euthanasia. As had Binding and Hoche, Catel identified three possible types of euthanasia.\n\n\"Real\" euthanasia was seen as the killing of a person who was suffering from so much pain, that an ever-increasing amount of pain reducing drugs had to be administered. This consequently lead to the person's death.\n\nThe killing of a patient whose illness \"according to medical experience\" is so bad \"that there is no hope of recovery\", but whose death is also not to be expected in the near future. (See terminal sedation)\n\nThe \"extermination of the life of an \"idiot child\" or an adult in a similar condition. Catel defined \"idiot children\" as being \"such monsters ... which are nothing but a massa carnis\".\n\nAfter the war Catel took charge of the \"Mammolshöhe Children's Mental Home\" near Kronberg, where he continued to rally for the euthanasia of children deemed beyond hope. In 1949 he was found to have committed no grave crimes by a denazification board in Hamburg, and became attached to the University of Kiel in 1954. There was serious discussion after his death in 1981 of establishing a \"Werner Catel Foundation\" with $200,000 from his estate, but the idea was finally dismissed in 1984.\n\n\n\n\n"}

When the \"Freikorps\" units were dissolved in 1921, hIs life became erratic; working as a locksmith and mechanic at varying places. Back in Berlin from 1928, he was an early Nazi supporter, who helped organize Nazi radio listeners and handled the technical details at many of Hitler's mass rallies. Hadamovsky joined the Nazi Party (NSDAP) in 1930; the party's propaganda leader Joseph Goebbels commissioned him to build up the right-wing \"Reichsverband Deutscher Rundfunkteilnehmer\" (\"Reich association of German broadcasting participants\").\n\nShortly after the Nazi seizure of power in January 1933, Hadamovsky served as the National Programming Director for the German \"Deutschlandsender\" broadcaster. A few months later, he was appointed Reich production director and head of the nationalized \"Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft\", whereby he played a vital role in the Nazi \"Gleichschaltung\" of the incorporated regional broadcasters. In 1935 he initiated the launch of the \"Fernsehsender Paul Nipkow\" TV station. Hadamovsky also served as vice-president of the broadcasting department in the \"Reichskulturkammer\" organization and in a variety of other posts during World War II. He was head of the radio department in the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda from 1940, however, Minister Goebbels was not entirely pleased with him, as is evident by many references in Goebbels' diaries. In 1942 Hadamovsky was replaced and took over the position as chief of staff in the Nazi Party's Central Propaganda Office (\"Reichspropagandaleitung\") in Berlin.\n\nHadamovsky authored seven propaganda books, the most significant of which was \"Propaganda and National Power\" (1933), the only book treating the general principles of propaganda published during the Third Reich. Other books include \"World History on the March\", which was published just before the 1939 Invasion of Poland, and applauded Nazi Germany in general and the return of the Memel Territory, Adolf Hitler's last negotiated territorial gain, previously lost to Lithuania after World War I. Hadamovsky was also author of \"Blitzmarsch nach Warschau: Frontberichte eines politischen Soldaten\" (Lightning March to Warsaw: Front Reports of a Political Soldier), an eyewitness account of the Invasion of Poland (1939).\n\nIn 1943, Hadamovsky volunteered for the Wehrmacht armed forces. Toward the end of World War II, he joined the 4th SS Polizei Panzergrenadier Division and died in combat, shot through the heart, in the rank of an \"Obersturmführer\" (first lieutenant), fighting at the head of his company on the Eastern Front early in March 1945 at Hölkewiese near Rummelsburg in Pomerania. After his death, Goebbels wrote of him as one of the best comrades, an energetic and loyal companion and an old friend. Hadamovsky is buried in Endgrablage: Block 3 Reihe 31 Grab 1533 - 1548, German military cemetery Neumark / Stare Czarnowo, Poland.\n"}

From its founding in 1877 until October 2009, the company was headquartered in Moss, Norway.\n\nHelly Juell Hansen had been at sea since the age of 14 and in 1877, at the age of 35, he and his wife Maren Margarethe began producing oilskin jackets, trousers, sou'westers and tarpaulins, made from coarse linen soaked in linseed oil. Over the first five years they sold around 10,000 pieces.\n\nIn 1878 the company won a diploma for excellence at the Paris Expo, and began exporting its products.\n\nAfter Helly Juell Hansen's death in 1914, company leadership passed on to his son Helly Hansen, an experienced merchant.\nIn the 1920s a new fabric, which Helly Hansen called Linox, was developed. Over the next 30 years the name Linox would transfer to a PVC (polyvinyl chloride) application.\n\nA change for the brand came in 1949 when Helox was developed. The sheet of translucent PVC plastic sewn into waterproof coats and hats became a popular item. About 30,000 Helox coats were produced each month. Plarex, a heavier-duty version of Helox, backed by fabric, was developed for workwear.\n\nA product developed for the outdoor and workwear markets was Fibrepile which is an insulation layer for wearing under waterproofs. It was used by Swedish lumbermen, who discovered that it offered insulation against the cold, and ventilated well during hard, physical work in the forest.\n\nThe layering story was completed in the 1970s, with the development of LIFA. The polypropylene fibre used in LIFA kept the skin dry and warm by pushing moisture away from the body, making it the ideal base-layer fabric for outdoor and workwear use. It was the birth of the three-layer systems of dress with LIFA close to the body, Fibrepile as an insulation layer, and rainwear for protection.\n\nDuring the 1970s the company developed survival suits for offshore oil workers in the North Sea. In 1980 the company's breathable, waterproof fabric system, called Helly Tech, was launched. Helly Tech garments use both hydrophilic and microporous technology. Hydrophilic garments have water-loving molecular chains which pass water vapor to the outside. Microporous garments have tiny pores that allow water vapor to pass out of the fabric without letting rain droplets in.\n\nHelly Hansen clothing developed a following among urban youth in the late 1990s, particularly in North England and with the hip hop culture in the US. The brand developed a mass appeal and is now sold in sports shops, not only the hiking and specialized clothing shops of before.\n\nIn 2012, Helly Hansen introduced their H2 Flow Technology with the H2 Flow Jacket. The H2 Flow Jacket allows the wearer to regulate their body temperature.\n\nBy 1995, the company was owned by Norwegian conglomerate Orkla. That year, Orkla sold a 50% stake in Helly Hansen to Resource Group International, which merged with Aker in 1996.\n\nIn 1997, Investcorp bought Aker's stake and most of Orkla's stake, giving it 70% ownership. The company was valued at $160 million.\n\nIn October 2006, Investcorp sold its interest in Helly Hansen to Altor Equity Partners, \"\"a private equity firm focusing on investments in companies based in the Nordic region.\"\"\n\nIn 2012, Altor sold a 75% stake in Helly Hansen to the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan.\n\nIn 2015 the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan increased its position, acquiring Altor's remaining stock in the business.\n\nIn May 2018, the pension plan sold the company to Canadian Tire, a retailer, for 985 million.\n\nIn February 2011, a three-year partnership with guiding company Mountain Madness was announced. The agreement between the companies meant that Helly Hansen would be outfitting all of Mountain Madness operations guides \"with technical apparel from head to toe\" beginning the 2011 season and extending through 2013.\n\nIn November 2012, Helly Hansen partnered with the US Ski and Snowboard Association to be their official baselayer provider. The US Alpine Ski Team wore Helly Hansen baselayer while competing in Sochi.\n\nHelly Hansen is the official apparel sponsor of the NOOD Regatta Races for sailing.\n\nIn July 2015, Helly Hansen became the apparel partner for Canada’s alpine and para-alpine ski teams.\n\n"}

It often describes the presence of immature cells such as myeloblasts or red blood cells with nuclei in the peripheral blood.\n\nIt may be lymphoid or myeloid.\n\nAs noted above, a leukemoid reaction is typically a response to an underlying medical issue. Causes of leukemoid reactions include:\n\nConventionally, a leukocytosis exceeding 50,000 WBC/mm with a significant increase in early neutrophil precursors is referred to as a leukemoid reaction. The peripheral blood smear may show myelocytes, metamyelocytes, promyelocytes, and rarely myeloblasts; however, there is a mixture of early mature neutrophil precursors, in contrast to the immature forms typically seen in acute leukemia. Serum leukocyte alkaline phosphatase is normal or elevated in leukemoid reaction, but is depressed in chronic myelogenous leukemia. The bone marrow in a leukemoid reaction, if examined, may be hypercellular but is otherwise typically unremarkable.\n\nLeukemoid reactions are generally benign and are not dangerous in and of themselves, although they are often a response to a significant disease state (see \"Causes\" above). However, leukemoid reactions can resemble more serious conditions such as chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), which can present with identical findings on the peripheral blood smear.\n\nHistorically, various clues including the leukocyte alkaline phosphatase score and the presence of basophilia were used to distinguish CML from a leukemoid reaction. However, at present the test of choice in adults to distinguish CML is an assay for the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome, either via cytogenetics and FISH, or via PCR for the BCR/ABL fusion gene. The LAP (Leukocyte Alkaline Phosphatase) score is high in reactive states but is low in CML.

{"id": "2002473", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2002473", "title": "Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance", "text": "Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance\n\nSolid-state NMR (ssNMR) spectroscopy is a special type of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, characterized by the presence of anisotropic (directionally dependent) interactions. Compared to the more common solution NMR spectroscopy, ssNMR usually requires additional hardware for high-power radio-frequency irradiation and magic-angle spinning. \n\nThe resonance frequency of a nuclear spin depends on the strength of the magnetic field at the nucleus, which can be modified by the electron cloud or the proximity of another spin. In general, these local fields are orientation dependent. In media with no or little mobility (e.g. crystalline powders, glasses, large membrane vesicles, molecular aggregates), anisotropic local fields or interactions have substantial influence on the behaviour of nuclear spins. In contrast, in a classical liquid-state NMR experiment, Brownian motion averages anisotropic interactions to zero and they are therefore not reflected in the NMR spectrum.\n\nTwo directionally dependent interactions commonly found in solid-state NMR are the \"chemical shift anisotropy\" (CSA) induced by the electron cloud around the nucleus and the \"dipolar coupling\" to other nuclear spins. More such interactions exist, in particular the quadrupolar coupling of nuclei with spin quantum number >1/2 and dipolar couplings to electron spins. The anisotropic J-coupling is usually too small to be detected. The \"g\"-tensor is an anisotropic interaction in electron spin resonance. In mathematical terms, all these interactions can be described using the same formalism.\n\nAnisotropic interactions modify the local fields and nuclear spin energy levels (and hence the resonance frequency) of nuclei in a molecule, and often contribute to line broadening in NMR spectra. Nevertheless, there is a range of situations when their presence either cannot be avoided, or is even particularly desired, as they encode structural parameters, such as orientation information, on chemical bonds of interest.\nHigh-resolution conditions in solids (in a wider sense) can be established using magic angle spinning (MAS), macroscopic sample orientation, combinations of both of these techniques, and a variety of radio frequency (RF) irradiation patterns. While the latter allows decoupling of interactions in spin space, the others facilitate averaging of interactions in real space. In addition, line-broadening effects from microscopic inhomogeneities can be reduced by appropriate methods of sample preparation.\n\nUnder magic-angle spinning conditions, isotropic interactions can report on the local structure, e.g. by the isotropic chemical shift. In addition, decoupled interactions can be selectively re-introduced (\"recoupling\"), and used, for example, for controlled de-phasing or transfer of polarization to derive a number of structural parameters such as internuclear distances.\n\nThe residual line width (full width at half maximum) of C nuclei under MAS conditions at 5–15 kHz spinning frequency and strong H decoupling by radio-frequency irradiation is typically on the order of 0.3–2 ppm. Even at MAS rates of 20 kHz and above, however, nonlinear groups of the same nuclei (i.e. not on a straight line) linked via homonuclear dipolar interactions can only be suppressed partially, leading to H NMR line widths of 0.5 ppm and above, which is considerably more than in optimal solution state NMR conditions. Other interactions such as the quadrupolar interaction can lead to line widths of thousands of ppm due to the strength of the interaction. The first-order quadrupolar broadening is largely suppressed by sufficiently fast MAS, but the second-order quadrupolar broadening has a different angular dependence and cannot be removed by spinning at one angle alone. Ways to achieve line shapes without anisotropy-induced broadening for quadrupolar nuclei include spinning at two angles simultaneously (DOR, DOuble angle Rotation), sequentially (DAS), or through refocusing the second-order quadrupolar interaction with a two-dimensional experiment such as MQMAS or STMAS.\n\nFrom the perspective of solution-state NMR, it can be desirable to limit motional averaging of dipolar interactions by alignment media. The resulting residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) are typically only a few Hz in magnitude, but do not destroy high-resolution conditions and provide a wealth of information, in particular on the orientation of molecular domains with respect to each other.\n\nThe dipolar coupling between two nuclei is inversely proportional to the cube of their distance. The fairly slow polarization transfer mediated by the dipolar interaction between two distant spins of the same kind, e.g. C, is dramatically slowed down by a strong coupling to a third such nucleus nearby. This usually undesirable effect is commonly referred to as dipolar truncation. It has been one of the major obstacles in efficient extraction of internuclear distances, which are crucial in the structural analysis of biomolecular structure. By means of isotope labeling schemes or radio-frequency pulse sequences, however, it has become possible to circumvent this problem in a number of ways. Another way of circumventing dipolar truncation is to study rare nuclei like C at their low natural isotopic abundance utilising DNP-assisted MAS NMR, where the probability of an interfering third spin nearby is almost 100 times lower.\n\nThe chemical shielding is a local property of each nuclear site in a molecule or compound, and is proportional to the applied external magnetic field.\n\nSpecifically, the external magnetic field induces currents of the electrons in molecular orbitals. These induced currents create local magnetic fields that lead to characteristic changes in nuclear resonance frequency. These changes can be predicted from molecular structure using empirical rules or quantum-chemical calculations.\n\nUnder sufficiently fast magic angle spinning, or in solution-state NMR, the directionally dependent character of the chemical shielding is time-averaged to zero, leaving only the isotropic chemical shift.\n\nThe J-coupling or indirect nuclear spin-spin coupling (sometimes also called \"scalar\" coupling despite the fact that J is a tensor quantity) describes the interaction of nuclear spins through chemical bonds.\n\nNuclear spins exhibit a magnetic dipole moment, which generates a magnetic field that interacts with the dipole moments of other nuclei (dipolar coupling). The magnitude of the interaction is dependent on the spin species, the internuclear distance \"r\", and the orientation, with respect to the external magnetic field \"B\", of the vector connecting the two nuclear spins (see figure). The maximum dipolar coupling is given by the dipolar coupling constant \"d\",\n\nwhere γ and γ are the gyromagnetic ratios of the nuclei. In a strong magnetic field, the dipolar coupling depends on the angle \"θ\" between the internuclear vector and the external magnetic field \"B\" (see the figure) according to\n\n\"D\" becomes zero for \"formula_3\" = 54.7°. Consequently, two nuclei with a dipolar coupling vector at an angle of \"θ\" = 54.7° to a strong external magnetic field have zero dipolar coupling. \"θ\" is called the magic angle. One technique for removing dipolar couplings, at least relatively weak ones, is magic angle spinning.\n\nNuclei with a spin quantum number >1/2 have a non-spherical charge distribution. This is known as a quadrupolar nucleus. A non spherical charge distribution can interact with an electric field gradient caused by some form of non-symmetry (e.g. in a trigonal bonding atom there are electrons around it in a plane, but not above or below it) to produce a change in the energy level in addition to the Zeeman effect. The quadrupolar interaction is the largest interaction in NMR apart from the Zeeman interaction, and they can even become comparable in size.\nThe quadrupole coupling is so large that, unlike most other interactions, it cannot be treated to just the first order. This means you have a first and second order interaction, which can be treated separately. The first order interaction has an angular dependency with respect to the magnetic field of formula_4 (the P Legendre polynomial), this means that spinning the sample around an axis making an angle of 54.7° with the external field averages out the first-order interaction over one rotation period (other local interactions, including chemical shift, paramagnetic coupling, and J-coupling, also have this angular dependency). However, the second-order quadrupolar interaction depends on the P Legendre polynomial, which has zero points at 30.6° and 70.1°. These can be taken advantage of by either using DOR (DOuble angle Rotation) where you spin at two angles at the same time, or DAS (Double Angle Spinning) where you switch quickly between the two angles. Specialized hardware (probe) has been developed for such experiments. A revolutionary advance is Lucio Frydman's multiple quantum magic angle spinning (MQMAS) NMR in 1995 and it has become a routine method for obtaining high resolution solid-state NMR spectra of quadrupolar nuclei. A similar method to MQMAS is satellite transisition magic angle spinning (STMAS) NMR proposed by Zhehong Gan in 2000.\n\nParamagnetic substances are subject to the Knight shift.\n\n\"See also:\" nuclear magnetic resonance or NMR spectroscopy articles for an account on discoveries in NMR and NMR spectroscopy in general.\n\n\"History of discoveries of NMR phenomena, and the development of solid-state NMR spectroscopy:\"\n\nPurcell, Torrey and Pound: \"nuclear induction\" on H in paraffin 1945, at about the same time Bloch \"et al.\" on H in water.\n\n\"Methods and techniques\"\n\nA fundamental RF pulse sequence and a building-block in many solid-state NMR experiments starts with cross-polarization (CP) . It can be used to enhance the signal of nuclei with a low gyromagnetic ratio (e.g. C, N) by magnetization transfer from nuclei with a high gyromagnetic ratio (e.g. H), or as a spectral editing method (e.g. directed N→C CP in protein spectroscopy). To establish magnetization transfer, the RF pulses applied on the two frequency channels must fulfill the Hartmann–Hahn condition , that is, the nutation frequencies in both rf fields must be identical. Experimental optimization of this condition is one of the routine tasks in performing a (solid-state) NMR experiment.\n\nCP is a basic building block of most pulse sequences in solid-state NMR spectroscopy. Given its importance, a pulse sequence employing direct excitation of H spin polarization, followed by CP transfer to and signal detection of C, N or similar nuclei, is itself often referred to as \"CP experiment\", or, in conjunction with MAS, as \"CP-MAS\" . It is the typical starting point of an investigation using solid-state NMR spectroscopy.\n\nSpin interactions must be removed (decoupled) to increase the resolution of NMR spectra and isolate spin systems.\n\nA technique that can substantially reduce or remove the chemical shift anisotropy and relatively weak dipolar couplings is \"sample rotation\" (most commonly magic angle spinning, but also off-magic angle spinning).\n\n\"Heteronuclear decoupling\" by radio-frequency irradiation decouples spin interactions of the observed nuclei with other types of nuclei, primarily H. \"Homonuclear decoupling\" by specially designed radio-frequency pulse sequences or fast MAS decouples spin interactions of nuclei that are the same as those being detected. \n\nAlthough the broadened lines are often not desired, dipolar couplings between atoms in the crystal lattice can also provide very useful information. Dipolar coupling are distance dependent, and so they may be used to calculate interatomic distances in isotopically labeled molecules.\n\nBecause most dipolar interactions are averaged to zero by sample spinning, recoupling experiments with rotation-synchronized radio-frequency irradiation are needed to re-introduce desired dipolar couplings so they can be measured. A classical example of recoupling is the Rotational Echo DOuble Resonance (REDOR) experiment\nwhich also can be the basis of an NMR crystallographic study.\n\nIn contrast to traditional approaches particular in protein NMR, in which the broad lines associated with protons effectively relegate this nucleus to mixing of magnetization, recent developments of hardware (very fast MAS) and reduction of dipolar interactions by deuteration have made protons as versatile as they are in solution NMR. This includes spectral dispersion in multi-dimensional experiments as well as structurally valuable restraints and parameters important for studying the materials' dynamics.\n\nStudies of solids by NMR relaxation experiments are affected by the following general observations. The experimental decay of longitudinal magnetization follows the exponential law if the spin-diffusion mechanism is completely dominant; then a single relaxation time characterizes all of the nuclei, even those that are not chemically or structurally equivalent. The spin-diffusion mechanism is typical of systems with nuclei experiencing strong dipolar interactions (protons, fluorine or phosphorus nuclei at relatively small concentrations of paramagnetic centers) under relatively slow MAS. For other nuclei with weak dipolar coupling at a high concentration of paramagnetic centers, relaxation can be non-exponential following a stretched exponential function, exp(–(τ/T1)) or exp(–(τ/T2)). For paramagnetic solids, the β value of 0.5 corresponds to relaxation via direct electron–nucleus dipolar interactions without spin diffusion, while intermediate values between 0.5 and 1.0 can be attributed to a diffusion-limited mechanism.\n\nMembrane proteins and amyloid fibrils, the latter related to Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, are two examples of applications where solid-state NMR spectroscopy complements solution-state NMR spectroscopy and beam diffraction methods (e.g. X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy). Solid-state NMR structure elucidation of proteins has traditionally been based on secondary chemical shifts and spatial contacts between heteronuclei. Currently, paramagnetic contact shifts and specific proton-proton distances are also used for higher resolution and longer-range distance restraints.\n\nSolid-state NMR spectroscopy serves as an analysis tool in organic and inorganic chemistry, where is used as a valuable tool to characterize chemical composition, supramolecular structure, local motions, kinetics, and thermodynamics, with the special ability to assign the observed behavior to specific sites in a molecule.\n\nObjects of ssNMR studies in materials science are inorganic/organic aggregates in crystalline and amorphous states, composite materials, heterogeneous systems including liquid or gas components, suspensions, and molecular aggregates with dimensions on the nanoscale.\n\nIn many cases, NMR is the uniquely applicable method for measurement of porosity, particularly for porous systems containing partially filled pores or for dual-phase systems. ssNMR is one of the most effective technique for molecular-level investigation of interfaces.\n\nNMR can also be applied to art conservation. Different salts and moisture levels can be detected through the use of solid state NMR. However, sampling sizes retrieved from works of art in order to run through these large conducting magnets typically exceed levels deemed acceptable. Unilateral NMR techniques use portable magnets that are applied to the object of interest, bypassing the need for sampling. As such, unilateral NMR techniques prove to be useful in the art conservation world.\n\n\n\"Books and major review articles\"\n\n\n\"References to books and research articles\"\n\n"}

Written circa 1564 and first printed in 1571, the play chronicles the Greek friendship story of Damon and Pythias. It was originally performed by the Children of the Chapell for Queen Elizabeth, possibly during the Christmas season between 1564 and 1565.\nOn September 10, 1996, an all-female cast gave a single performance at the Globe Theatre in London.\n\n\n\nThe play begins with the philosopher Aristippus musing on his newfound position as a courtier in King Dionyusius's court in Syracuse. Carisophus enters, looking to join with Aristippus in friendship. Aristippus pretends to agree, though he knows that Carisophus is dissembling and the bond is false. \n\nDamon, Pythias and Stephano then arrive in Syracuse as part of their travels. The two have been traveling from Greece, and their arrival does not go unnoticed. Carisophus plots to use them in order to advance his own position in court. Damon and Pythias learn about the paranoia and tyranny of King Dionysius and his willingness to kill his subjects. Their servant Stephano begs them to leave before anything terrible can befall them, but the two decide to stay in Syracuse. Carisophus soon meets Damon on the street and has him arrested on suspicion of spying.\n\nAgainst the advice of his trusty counselor Eubulus, King Dionysius condemns Damon to die. Pythias protests his friend's innocence and declares their bond of true friendship. Dionysius agrees that he will keep Pythias prisoner for the next two months while Damon settles his affairs in Greece. If Damon returns before the two months are up, then Pythias will be cleared of suspicion. If he does not return, then Pythias will be executed in his stead.\n\nThe two months pass with no sign of Damon, and preparations are made for Pythias's execution. Meanwhile, Carisophus meets with Aristippus in order to ask his friend to defend him should Damon return. Aristippus refuses and breaks their bond of friendship, saying that it is not like the true friendship between honest men like Damon and Pythias and that he will not protect Carisophus. The scene shifts back to the gallows, where Pythias and Groano await the king's final judgement. Pythias still trusts that Damon will return, but does not fear death, telling Groano the hangman \"O thou minister of justice, do thine office by and by, / Let not thy hand tremble, for I tremble not to die.\" Dionysius orders him to die, but Damon rushes in to stop the execution. Dionysius's heart is so moved by their display of perfect friendship that he stays Pythias's execution. The king goes so far as to ask to become a third friend to them, and Damon and Pythias agree. Dionysius joins with them in amity and resolves to cease acting as a tyrant and listening to flatterers.\n\nThe play ends with Eubulus throwing Carisophus from the court and delivering a speech on the virtues of true friendship. Eubulus notes that true friendship is a \"true defence for kings...a shield to defend the enemy's cruel hand\" and closes the play by wishing that God grant Queen Elizabeth such friends.\n\nThe notion of male friendship at work in \"Damon and Pythias\" harkens back to an idea elaborated by Pythagoras and later Cicero called \"amicitia perfecta\", or ideal and perfect friendship between two men. This notion is seen as the pinnacle of human affection, and occurred between two men of similar social stature who love each other for the sake of that virtue. It is described as altruistic, spiritual and self-sufficient with little mention of marriage or wives but a focus on two men becoming \"second selves.\" Cicero writes that the perfect male friendship is \"above all other things in human life.\"\n\n\n"}

In medieval cuisine, sops were very common; they were served with broth, soup or wine, salt water and then picked apart into smaller pieces to soak in the liquid. At elaborate feasts, bread was often pre-cut into finger-sized pieces rather than broken off by the diners themselves. The bread or croutons traditionally served with French onion soup, which took its current form in the 18th century, can be considered modern-day sops.\n\nThe word \"soup\" is a cognate of \"sop\", both stemming ultimately from the same Germanic source. The word is mentioned prominently in the Bible, King James Version (emphasis added):\nIn 19th century Australia, \"sop\" referred to a dish consisting of stale damper, soaked in cold tea and served with a dollop of jam on top for taste. This was mainly used in prisons and poor-houses, as well as institutions such as asylums.\n\nIn Portuguese, the word \"sopa\", among other meanings, can generally refer to soup or, particularly in Alentejo, to a piece of dry or even stale bread that is part of the traditional fish broth. The \"sopa\" is soaked in the broth and eaten.\n\nThe expression \"milksop\" describes a person as weak and indecisive. Its connotation is similar to that of \"milquetoast\".\n\nThe term \"supper\" derives from \"sop\", and the expression \"toast of the town\" derives from the practices of dipping spiced toasted bread into liquid, and of honoring a dinner guest by referring to him or her by that term, which implies he or she adds spice to the dinner party.\n\n"}

The Late Period existed from 664 BC until 332 BC, following a period of foreign rule by the Nubian 25th dynasty and beginning with a short period of Neo-Assyrian suzerainty, with Psamtik I initially ruling as their vassal. The period ended with the conquests of the Persian Empire by Alexander the Great and establishment of the Ptolemaic dynasty by his general Ptolemy I Soter, one of the Hellenistic diadochi from Macedon in northern Greece. With the Macedonian Greek conquest in the latter half of the 4th century BC, the age of Hellenistic Egypt began.\n\nLibyans and Persians alternated rule with native Egyptians, but traditional conventions continued in the arts.\n\nThe Twenty-Sixth Dynasty, also known as the Saite Dynasty after its seat of power the city of Sais, reigned from 672 to 525 BC, and consisted of six pharaohs. It started with the unification of Egypt under Psamtik I c. 656 BC, itself a direct consequence of the Sack of Thebes by the Assyrians in 663 BC. Canal construction from the Nile to the Red Sea began.\n\nOne major contribution from the Late Period of ancient Egypt was the Brooklyn Papyrus. This was a medical papyrus with a collection of medical and magical remedies for victims of snakebites based on snake type or symptoms.\n\nArtwork during this time was representative of animal cults and animal mummies. This image shows the god Pataikos wearing a scarab beetle on his head, supporting two human-headed birds on his shoulders, holding a snake in each hand, and standing atop crocodiles.\n\nAccording to Jeremiah, during this time many Jews came to Egypt, fleeing after the destruction of the First Temple in Jerusalem by the Babylonians (586 BC). Jeremiah and other Jewish refugees arrived in Lower Egypt, notably in Migdol, Tahpanhes and Memphis. Some refugees also settled at Elephantine and other settlements in Upper Egypt. Jeremiah mentions pharaoh Apries as \"Hophra\", whose reign came to a violent end in 570 BC. Historians have disputed the accuracy of these events.\n\nThe First Achaemenid Period (525–404 BC) began with the Battle of Pelusium, which saw Egypt ( \"Mudrāya\") conquered by the expansive Achaemenid Empire under Cambyses, and Egypt become a satrapy. The Twenty-seventh Dynasty of Egypt consists of the Persian emperors - including Cambyses, Xerxes I, and Darius the Great - who ruled Egypt as Pharaohs and governed through their satraps, as well as the Egyptian Petubastis III (522-520 BC) (and possibly the disputed Psammetichus IV), who rebelled in defiance of the Persian authorities. The unsuccessful revolt of Inaros II (460-454), aided by the Athenians as part of the Wars of the Delian League, aspired to the same object. The Persian satraps were Aryandes (525–522 BC; 518–c.496 BC) - whose rule was interrupted by the rebel Pharaoah Petubastis III, Pherendates (c.496–c.486 BC), Achaemenes (c.486–459 BC) - a brother of the emperor Xerxes I, and Arsames (c.454–c.406 BC).\n\nThe Twenty-Eighth Dynasty consisted of a single king, Amyrtaeus, prince of Sais, who rebelled against the Persians. He left no monuments with his name. This dynasty reigned for six years, from 404 BC–398 BC.\n\nThe Twenty-Ninth Dynasty ruled from Mendes, for the period from 398 to 380 BC.\n\nThe Thirtieth Dynasty took their art style from the Twenty-Sixth Dynasty. A series of three pharaohs ruled from 380 BC until their final defeat in 343 BC led to the re-occupation by the Persians. The final ruler of this dynasty, and the final native ruler of Egypt until nearly 2,300 years later, was Nectanebo II.\n\nThe Second Achaemenid Period saw the re-inclusion of Egypt as a satrapy of the Persian Empire under the rule of the Thirty-First Dynasty, (343–332 BC) which consisted of three Persian emperors who ruled as Pharaoh - Artaxerxes III (343–338 BC), Artaxerxes IV (338–336 BC), and Darius III (336–332 BC) - interrupted by the revolt of the non-Achaemenid Khababash (338–335 BC). Persian rule in Egypt ended with the defeat of the Achaemenid Empire by Alexander the Great, who accepted the surrender of the Persian satrap of Egypt Mazaces in 332BC, and marking the beginning of Hellenistic rule in Egypt, which stabilized after Alexander's death into the Ptolemaic Kingdom.\n\n"}

{"id": "2002497", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2002497", "title": "Critical race theory", "text": "Critical race theory\n\nCritical race theory (CRT) is a theoretical framework in the social sciences, developed out of epistemic philosophy, that uses critical theory to examine society and culture as they relate to categorizations of race, law, and power. It began as a theoretical movement within American law schools in the mid- to late 1980s as a reworking of critical legal studies on race issues, and is loosely unified by two common themes: First, CRT proposes that white supremacy and racial power are maintained over time, and in particular, that the law may play a role in this process. Second, CRT work has investigated the possibility of transforming the relationship between law and racial power, and more broadly, pursues a project of achieving racial emancipation and anti-subordination. Scholars important to the theory include Derrick Bell, Patricia Williams, Richard Delgado, Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw, Camara Phyllis Jones, and Mari Matsuda. By 2002, over 20 American law schools and at least three law schools in other countries offered critical race theory courses or classes which covered the issue centrally. Critical race theory is taught and innovated in the fields of education, law, political science, women's studies, ethnic studies, communication, and American studies. Many people believe the critical race theory to be a very important view to race and racism in America.\n\nCritics of CRT, including Richard Posner and Alex Kozinski, take issue with its foundations in postmodernism and reliance on moral relativism, social constructionism, and other tenets contrary to classical liberalism.\n\nAccording to the UCLA School of Public Affairs:\nLegal scholar Roy L. Brooks has defined CRT as \"a collection of critical stances against the existing legal order from a race-based point of view\", and says:\n\nIn the early 1980s, students of color at Harvard Law School organized protests in various forms to problematize the lack of racial diversity in the curriculum and among students and faculty. These students supported Professor Derrick Bell, who left Harvard Law in 1980 to become the dean at University of Oregon School of Law. During his time at Harvard, Bell had developed new courses which used a racial lens to study American law that students of color wanted faculty of color to teach in his absence. However, the university ignored student requests and hired two white civil rights attorneys instead. In response, numerous students boycotted, including Kimberlé Crenshaw and Mari Matsuda, and organized to develop an \"Alternative Course\" which used Bell's \"Race, Racism, and American Law\" (1973, 1st edition) as a core text and included guest speakers Richard Delgado and Neil Gotanda. \n\nThe repeated refusals of Harvard Law to acknowledge the requests of students of color led to the self-declaration of critical race theory as an offshoot of critical legal studies in 1987. Kimberlé Crenshaw sent out a call to attend a retreat entitled \"New Developments in Critical Race Theory\" that effectively created the field under the name CRT. As Crenshaw states, only herself, Mari Matsuda, Neil Gotanda, Chuck Lawrence, and a handful of others knew \"that there were no \"new\" developments in critical race theory, because CRT hadn't had any old ones–it didn't exist, it was made up as a name. Sometimes you gotta fake it until you make it.\" Crenshaw states that critical race theorists had \"discovered ourselves to be critical theorists who did race and racial justice advocates who did critical theory.\" Crenshaw writes, \"one might say that CRT was the offspring of a post-civil rights institutional activism that was generated and informed by an oppositionalist orientation toward racial power.\" \n\nCritical race theory draws on the priorities and perspectives of both critical legal studies and conventional civil rights scholarship, while sharply contesting both of these fields. Angela P. Harris describes CRT as sharing \"a commitment to a vision of liberation from racism through right reason\" with the civil rights tradition. It deconstructs some premises and arguments of legal theory and simultaneously holds that legally constructed rights are incredibly important. In Angela P. Harris' view, as described by Derrick Bell, critical race theory is committed to \"radical critique of the law (which is normatively deconstructionist) and ... radical emancipation by the law (which is normatively reconstructionist).\"\n\nCRT's theoretical elements are provided by a variety of sources.\n\nRichard Delgado and Jean Stefancic have documented the following major themes as characteristic of work in critical race theory:\n\nCheryl I. Harris and Gloria Ladson-Billings add the theoretical element of whiteness as property. They describe whiteness as the ultimate property which whites alone can possess. It is valuable and is property. The 'property functions of whiteness'—rights to disposition, rights to use and enjoyment, reputation and status property, and the absolute right to exclude—make the American dream a more likely and attainable reality for whites as citizens. For a CRT critic, the white skin color that some Americans possess is like owning a piece of property. It grants privileges to the owner that a renter (or a person of color) would not be afforded.\n\nKaren Pyke documents the theoretical element of internalized racism or internalized racial oppression. The victims of racism begin to believe the ideology that they are inferior and white people and white culture are superior. The internalizing of racism is not due to any weakness, ignorance, inferiority, psychological defect, gullibility, or other shortcomings of the oppressed. Instead, it is how authority and power in all aspects of society contributes to feelings of inequality.\n\nCamara Phyllis Jones defines institutionalized racism as the structures, policies, practices, and norms resulting in differential access to the goods, services, and opportunities of society by race. Institutionalized racism is normative, sometimes legalized and often manifests as inherited disadvantage. It is structural, having been absorbed into our institutions of custom, practice and law, so there need not be an identifiable offender. Indeed, institutionalized racism is often evident as inaction in the face of need. Institutionalized racism manifests itself both in material conditions and in access to power. With regard to material conditions, examples include differential access to quality education, sound housing, gainful employment, appropriate medical facilities and a clean environment.\n\nSolid Ground, an organization that works to combat poverty, describes institutionalized racism as the systematic dissemination of opportunities, power, and resources. Institutional racism dates back to slavery, segregation, internment camps, and Indian reservations. Institutional racism can be present in institutions mainly designed to benefit and cater to the lives of white people. Bank lending policies and different housing contracts are both examples of institutional racism that denies people of color from living in certain neighborhoods or areas. Many people of color are also racially profiled by law enforcement and many groups are misrepresented when it comes to the media and different news sources. There are also restrictions to certain types of employment or even advancements in the workplace which is based strictly on one's race.\n\nAs a movement that draws heavily from critical theory, critical race theory shares many intellectual commitments with critical legal studies, critical theory, feminist jurisprudence and postcolonial theory. Though some authors like Tommy J. Curry have pointed out that such epistemic convergences with critical legal studies, critical theory, etc. are emphasized because of the idealist turn in critical race theory which is interested in discourse (how we speak about race) and the theories of white Continental philosophers, over and against the structural and institutional accounts of white supremacy which were at the heart of the realist analysis of racism introduced in Derrick Bell's early works articulated through Black thinkers like W. E. B. Du Bois, Paul Robeson, and Judge Robert L. Carter.\nWill Oremus wrote in \"Slate\"that CRT was radical \"in the sense that it questions fundamental assumptions... And unlike some strands of academic and legal thought, critical race theory has an open and activist agenda, with an emphasis on storytelling and personal experience. It's about righting wrongs, not just questing after knowledge\" and that CRT is not \"radical today in the sense of being outside the mainstream: Critical race theory is widely taught and studied.\"\n\nRecent developments in critical race theory include work relying on updated social psychology research on unconscious bias to justify affirmative action and work relying on law and economics methodology to examine structural inequality and discrimination in the workplace.\n\nThe framework of Latino critical race theory (LatCRT) suggests that the social construction of race is central to how people of color are constrained in society. Tara J. Yosso discusses constraint of people of color can be defined in \"Critical Race Counterstories along the Chicana/Chicano Educational Pipeline\". These tenets are what make LatCRT different because it looks at the differences between Chicano/a students. These tenets are: The \"inter\"centricity of race and racism; the challenge of dominant Ideology; the commitment to social justice; the centrality of experience knowledge; and the interdisciplinary perspective.\n\nRace scholars developed the LatCRT as a critical response to the \"problem of the color line\" first explained by W. E. B. Du Bois. CRT focused on the Black–White paradigm, but LatCRT has moved to consider other racial groups, mainly Chicana/Chicanos. These groups include Latinos/as, Asians, Native Americans/First Nations, and women of color.\n\nLatCRTs main focus is to advocate for social justice for people who live in marginalized communities, specifically Chicana/Chicano individuals. These marginalized communities are guided by structural arrangements that disadvantage people of color. Social institutions function as dispossessions, disenfranchisement, and discrimination over minority groups, but the LatCRT seeks to give voice to those who are victimized. In order to give voice to those that are disenfranchised, LatCRT has created two common themes.\n\nFirst, CRT proposes that white supremacy and racial power are maintained over time and that the law plays a central role in this process. Different racial groups lack the voice to speak in this civil society. For this reason, the CRT has introduced a new critical form of expressions, called the \"voice of color\". The \"voice of color\" is narratives and storytelling monologues used as devices for conveying personal racial experiences. The \"voices of color\" are also used to counter metanarratives that continue to maintain racial inequality. Thus, the experiences of the oppressed are important aspects for developing a LatCRT analytical approach. Not since the rise of slavery have we seen an institution that so fundamentally shapes the life opportunities of those who bear the label of criminal.\n\nSecond, LatCRT work has investigated the possibility of transforming the relationship between law enforcement and racial power, and more broadly, pursues a project of achieving racial emancipation and anti-subordination. The CRT finds the experiential knowledge of people of color and draws explicitly from these lived experiences as data. The CRT presents research findings through storytelling, chronicles, scenarios, narratives, and parables.\n\nScholars in critical race theory have focused with some particularity on the issues of hate crime and hate speech. In response to the US Supreme Court's opinion in the hate speech case of \"R. A. V. v. City of St. Paul\" (1992), in which the Court struck down an anti-bias ordinance as applied to a teenager who had burned a cross, Mari Matsuda and Charles Lawrence argued that the Court had paid insufficient attention to the history of racist speech and the actual injury produced by such speech.\n\nCritical race theorists have also paid particular attention to the issue of affirmative action. Scholars have argued in favor of affirmative action on the argument that so-called merit standards for hiring and educational admissions are not race-neutral for a variety of reasons, and that such standards are part of the rhetoric of neutrality through which whites justify their disproportionate share of resources and social benefits.\n\nSome legal scholars have criticized CRT on a number of grounds, such as CRT scholars' reliance on narrative and storytelling, or CRT's critique of objectivity. Judge Richard Posner of the United States Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals has \"label[ed] critical race theorists and postmodernists the 'lunatic core' of 'radical legal egalitarianism.'\" He wrote:\nJudge Alex Kozinski of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals wrote that critical race theorists have constructed a philosophy which makes a valid exchange of ideas between the various disciplines unattainable:\nDaniel Farber and Suzanna Sherry have argued that critical race theory, along with critical feminism and critical legal studies, has anti-Semitic and anti-Asian implications, has worked to undermine notions of democratic community, and has impeded dialogue.\n\nHenry Louis Gates Jr. has written a critical evaluation of CRT. Gates emphasizes how campus speech codes and anti-hate speech laws have been applied to anti-white speech, contrary to the intentions of CRT theorists: \"During the year in which Michigan's speech code was enforced, more than twenty blacks were charged – by whites – with racist speech. As Trossen notes, not a single instance of white racist speech was punished.\"\n\nJeffrey J. Pyle wrote in the \"Boston College Law Review\":\nPeter Wood considers CRT a \"grievance ideology\" and an \"absurdity\". He sees the central tenet of \"white racism in the American legal system\" to be shown false because of items such as the 14th Amendment, the Voting Rights Acts, and \"Brown v. Board of Education\". Critics including George Will saw resonances between critical race theory's use of storytelling and insistence that race poses challenges to objective judgments in the US and the acquittal of O. J. Simpson.\n\nWithin critical race theory, various sub-groupings have emerged to focus on issues that fall outside the black-white paradigm of race relations as well as issues that relate to the intersection of race with issues of gender, sexuality, class and other social structures. See for example, critical race feminism (CRF), Latino critical race studies (LatCrit), Asian American critical race studies (AsianCrit), South Asian American critical race studies (DesiCrit), and American Indian critical race studies (sometimes called TribalCrit). CRT methodology and analytical framework have also been applied to the study of white immigrant groups. CRT has spurred some scholars to call for a second wave of whiteness studies, which is now a small offshoot that is called Second Wave Whiteness (SWW).\n\nAnother offshoot field is Disability critical race studies (DisCrit), which combines Disability Studies and Critical Race Theory to focus on the intersection of disability and race (for more, see Disability studies#Race).\n\nCritical race theory has also begun to spawn research that looks at understandings of race outside the United States.\n\nCritical race theory has stirred controversy since the 1980s over such issues as its deviation from the ideal of color blindness, promotion of the use of narrative in legal studies, advocacy of \"legal instrumentalism\" as opposed to ideal-driven uses of the law, analysis of the Constitution and existing law as constructed according to and perpetuating racial power, and encouraging legal scholars to be partial on the side of ending racial subordination.\n\nIn 2010, the Mexican American Studies Department Programs in Tucson, Arizona were effectively banned because of their connection to CRT, which was seen to be in violation of a recently passed state law that \"prohibits schools from offering courses that 'advocate ethnic solidarity instead of the treatment of pupils as individuals'.\" The ban included the confiscation of books, in some cases in front of students, by the Tucson Unified School District. Matt de la Peña's young adult novel \"Mexican WhiteBoy\" was banned for containing CRT. However, this ban was later deemed unconstitutional on the grounds that the state showed discriminatory intent. \"Both enactment and enforcement were motivated by racial animus,\" federal Judge A. Wallace Tashima said in the ruling. \n"}

It stars Leif Erickson and Cameron Mitchell. The series was made by Xanadu Productions in association with NBC Productions, and was created by David Dortort, who had previously created \"Bonanza\" for the network. The theme song was written and conducted by \"Bonanza\" scorer David Rose, who also scored the two-hour pilot.\n\nThe show is set in the 1870s, and revolves around \"Big John\" Cannon (Erickson), a rancher living in the dry desert of the southern Arizona Territory, near the Mexican border, in Apache Indian country. John runs a ranch, called \"The High Chaparral\" (named for a local plant/brush), with his brother Buck (Mitchell) and his own son Billy Blue (known as \"Blue Boy\") (Mark Slade). Blue Boy's mother, Anna-lee Cannon (Joan Caulfield), is killed in the first episode by an attacking Apache Indian arrow. John then marries a beautiful Mexican woman named Victoria (Linda Cristal), 30 years his junior, the daughter of powerful neighboring Mexican rancher Don Sebastián Montoya (Frank Silvera). In what is initially a marriage of convenience, she soon appreciates his strength and character, falls in love with him and becomes very supportive. John's marriage to Victoria also brings her brother Manolito (Henry Darrow) to live with the American \"gringo\" family on the extensive ranch.\n\nAmong the many frequent guest stars were Rico Alaniz, Richard Bradford, Scott Brady, Rory Calhoun. Anthony Caruso, Chief Dan George, Roberto Contreras, Dennis Cross, Jim Davis, John Dehner, Bruce Dern, Charles Durning, Paul Fix, Steve Forrest, Ron Foster, Frank Gorshin, Ron Hagerthy, Ron Hayes, Myron Healey, Barbara Hershey, Don Keefer, Dan Kemp, Robert Loggia, Jack Lord, Tyler McVey, Ricardo Montalbán, Joanna Moore, Robert Pine, Nehemiah Persoff, Stuart Randall, Gilbert Roland, Ned Romero, Kurt Russell, Frank Silvera, Barry Sullivan, William Sylvester, William Tannen, Dub Taylor, Denver Pyle, Paul Winfield, and Morgan Woodward.\n\nThe two-hour opening episode establishes the background to the action, bringing \"Big John\" Cannon and his family and brother Buck to the frontier high desert scrubland in the southern Arizona Territory near the border with Mexico, where they buy a run-down \"hacienda\" and establish a cattle ranch on it. The Apaches, under the leadership of Cochise, are hostile; John's wife Anna-Lee is killed in an early attack, and to survive, the Cannons are compelled to enter into an alliance with a rich and powerful neighboring rancher, Don Sebastian Montoya, who owns a huge estate on the Mexican side of the border adjoining the \"High Chaparral\".\n\nPart of the price for the alliance is the sealing of the pact by the marriage of John Cannon to Montoya's beautiful, dark-haired, sophisticated daughter, Victoria, 30 years younger. Montoya's reckless son, Manolito, whose relationship with his father is strained, accompanies his sister to get away from Don Sebastian. John's son, Blue, is also vehemently opposed to the strange \"mixed marriage\", coming so soon after Anna-Lee's death.\n\nReinforced by Montoya's men, the Cannons are able to fight off the Indian attacks, and with the services of Manolito as interpreter, manage to negotiate a truce, albeit a fragile one, with the Apache leader. The main reason for its fragility is that the U.S. Cavalry refuses to recognize Cannon's right to negotiate a private peace with the Apaches, and continued Army interference constantly threatens the unofficial treaty. Problems also frequently occur between the Cannons and the arrogant, resentful Don Sebastian, usually concerning the terms of their alliance.\n\nBig John's brother, Buck, notionally the ranch's head cowhand, was a hard-bitten former soldier, who fought in the American Civil War, 10 years previously, on the side of the Confederacy. From time to time, Buck's past comes back to haunt him, usually in the person of other Confederate soldiers drifting through the territory, forever unable to return to their homes in the defeated South. Occasionally, friction occurred because foreman Buck's brother Big John had also fought in the war, but on the other side, as a Captain in the Union Army.\n\nThe series gradually evolved to make Manolito and Buck the most prominent characters, as they were the ones who tended to get into trouble; both were somewhat irresponsible, particularly under the influence of drink. For what was generally regarded as a serious Western tv series, their scenes provided what is popularly known as comedy- or \"comic relief\" to the show. The other characters were gradually marginalized. Cattle ranching almost never featured in the storylines, which, whenever Mexican bandit or Indian troubles were not imminent, were much more likely to revolve around personal issues of drama with Manolito or Buck and some form of hell-raising – gambling, fighting, women, or whiskey (or a combination of them).\n\nMark Slade (Blue Boy) did not appear in the final season, and Frank Silvera (Don Sebastian Montoya) had died while the series was still in production (but he did appear in a few episodes). Blue Boy was replaced by Wind (played by Rudy Ramos), a passing, mysterious cowhand who was half-Pawnee and of a similar age to Blue, and who sometimes acted as a go-between for the ranchers and the Indians. Gilbert Roland guest starred as Don Sebastian's younger brother, Don Domingo, who inherits Rancho Montoya near the end of the series. This final season had new opening titles and a rearranged version of the popular theme music.\n\nThe name was explained by the following dialog in episode one:\n\nIn the true sense of the word, \"chaparral\" is not a single species of shrub, but a bionomic community of desert flora located near a coast, especially that in coastal southern California. The name comes from the Spanish word for scrub oak, \"chaparro\", which is seldom found further east in Arizona as native flora. Some colloquial use of the term in Arizona describes the low-growing sage, mesquite, and palo verde, which are native to the area, especially in the higher desert, but the high Sonoran Desert in southern Arizona plant community is more properly called a \"xeric\" shrublands biome.\n\n\"The High Chaparral\" was producer Dortort's new brainchild, and he left the day-to-day running of his earlier success \"Bonanza\" (1959-1973) in the spring of 1967 so he could focus all of his energies on \"The High Chaparral\". After the show's cancellation in 1971 after only four years, Dortort chose not to return to \"Bonanza\" and retired. \n\nAll the exterior filming was done at the famous Old Tucson Studios near Tucson, Arizona (site of frequent movie-making for several decades), and in the nearby Saguaro National Park, although in a few later episodes some filming was done in California, and (in season three) in the Coronado National Forest south of Tucson. The interiors were generally filmed at the NBC television studios in Burbank.\n\nThe series has appeared on CBN, Family Channel, Hallmark Channel, INSP, and as of August 28, 2017, on Heroes & Icons.\n\nOn May 20, 2010 the first worldwide release of season one on DVD occurred in Germany (Kinowelt, now Studiocanal), with subtitles in English and dubbed into German. Season two was released on December 9, 2010. Season three was released June 9, 2011. The final season was released in February 16, 2012.\nOn disc one, episode one starts with some scenes shown on German TV that were not in the original, thus dubbed German instead of English for a few minutes.\n\nArt-S Home Entertainment (www.art-s.nl) in the Netherlands released the first box with season one (28 episodes) on May 2, 2012. Season two released on January 28, 2013. Season three released on September 3, 2013, and the final season released January 26, 2014.\n\"The High Chaparral\" is also released in Sweden with each season in two boxes. In Australia, they have also released \"The High Chaparral\" in four boxes. \nThe first and second seasons has been released by Shout! Factory in the US.

As one of the smallest local newspapers, in terms of circulation, it was based in Rockville from its first print in 1855 until its closure in 2020.\n\nThe \"Montgomery County Sentinel\" was first published as a weekly newspaper on August 11, 1855 by Matthew Fields in Rockville, Maryland.\n\nThe early focus of the paper was on advertising and politics, with relatively little space devoted to local news. News articles were usually brief and to the point without elaboration. On two occasions, once before and once during the Civil War, the paper suffered brief interruptions while Union military forces detained Matthew Fields, a Southern sympathizer. \n\nThroughout the war, the \"Sentinel\" wrote on the issue of slavery and when Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, Fields published the document's text in full on September 26, 1862. In addition to discussing the various political issues, war reports informed readers on the progress of the war.\n\nAfter rioting killed Union soldiers in Baltimore, the institution of martial law in Maryland allowed the Union Army to imprison Confederate sympathizers for disloyalty. On October 6, 1862, Union soldiers arrested Matthew Fields on the suspicion of 'southern sympathies.' Court documents indicate Fields was to be released as soon as he was willing to take an oath not to publish material favoring the South. He was released on November 25, 1862, during Lincoln's Thanksgiving Amnesty.\n\nFields died in 1871 and his wife, Rebecca, took over publication, often handling production entirely on her own until 1910 when Matthew Fields' son Henry Clay Fields became the editor. Rebecca Fields maintained a limited role until her death in 1930 at age 100.\n\nThe Fields family maintained ownership of the \"Sentinel\" until 1932 before selling it to Paul Griffith Stromberg. Stromberg expanded the newspaper, hired numerous reporters and a newsboy to handle deliveries. His ownership period focused a great deal on roads as roads were essential to moving products from the mills. Stromberg’s ownership also included the period through World War II and the need to rally support for the war, including coverage of the death of his son as well as the use of German prisoners of war to help on farms in Gaithersburg, Maryland.\n\nIn its centennial year, the Stromberg family sold the \"Sentinel\" to Louis Linebach and Cy Campbell. During their ownership, Linebach and Campbell had significant disagreements, with Campbell eventually selling his stake in the publication. One of the key events during their ownership period was the Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education.\n\nIn 1962, Leonard and Bernard Kapiloff purchased the newspaper from Linebach. During the 1960s, the \"Sentinel\"’s reporting on \"The Giles Case,\" often referred to as the \"'To Kill a Mockingbird' case of Montgomery County,\" led to freeing African Americans charged and wrongly convicted of rape. \n\nAfter failing a two-week trial hiring at The Washington Post in 1970, Bob Woodward spent a year at the \"Sentinel\" as a reporter. The \"Post\" rehired Woodward and within 12 months he partnered with Carl Bernstein to investigate the Watergate break-in.\n\nIn June 2015, the \"Sentinel\" removed over 80 editorial cartoons it had plagiarized from a variety of other artists.\n\nOn January 30, 2020, the \"Sentinel\" ceased publication.\n"}

{"id": "2002540", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2002540", "title": "Null (SQL)", "text": "Null (SQL)\n\nNull (or NULL) is a special marker used in Structured Query Language to indicate that a data value does not exist in the database. Introduced by the creator of the relational database model, E. F. Codd, SQL Null serves to fulfil the requirement that all \"true relational database management systems (RDBMS)\" support a representation of \"missing information and inapplicable information\". Codd also introduced the use of the lowercase Greek omega (ω) symbol to represent Null in database theory. In SQL, codice_1 is a reserved word used to identify this marker.\n\nA null should not be confused with a value of 0. A null value indicates a lack of a value — a lack of a value is not the same thing as a value of zero in the same way that a lack of an answer is not the same thing as an answer of \"no\". For example, consider the question \"How many books does Adam own?\" The answer may be \"zero\" (we \"know\" that he owns \"none\") or \"null\" (we \"do not know\" how many he owns). In a database table, the column reporting this answer would start out with no value (marked by Null), and it would not be updated with the value \"zero\" until we have ascertained that Adam owns no books.\n\nSQL null is a state, not a value. This usage is quite different from most programming languages, where null value of a reference means it is not pointing to any object.\n\nE. F. Codd mentioned nulls as a method of representing missing data in the relational model in a 1975 paper in the \"FDT Bulletin of ACM-SIGMOD\". Codd's paper that is most commonly cited in relation with the semantics of Null (as adopted in SQL) is his 1979 paper in the \"ACM Transactions on Database Systems\", in which he also introduced his Relational Model/Tasmania, although much of the other proposals from the latter paper have remained obscure. Section 2.3 of his 1979 paper details the semantics of Null propagation in arithmetic operations as well as comparisons employing a ternary (three-valued) logic when comparing to nulls; it also details the treatment of Nulls on other set operations (the latter issue still controversial today). In database theory circles, the original proposal of Codd (1975, 1979) is now referred to as \"Codd tables\". Codd later reinforced his requirement that all RDBMSs support Null to indicate missing data in a 1985 two-part article published in \"ComputerWorld\" magazine.\n\nThe 1986 SQL standard basically adopted Codd's proposal after an implementation prototype in IBM System R. Although Don Chamberlin recognized nulls (alongside duplicate rows) as one of the most controversial features of SQL, he defended the design of Nulls in SQL invoking the pragmatic arguments that it was the least expensive form of system support for missing information, saving the programmer from many duplicative application-level checks (see semipredicate problem) while at the same time providing the database designer with the option not to use Nulls if they so desire; for example, in order to avoid well known anomalies (discussed in the semantics section of this article). Chamberlin also argued that besides providing some missing-value functionality, practical experience with Nulls also led to other language features which rely on Nulls, like certain grouping constructs and outer joins. Finally, he argued that in practice Nulls also end up being used as a quick way to patch an existing schema when it needs to evolve beyond its original intent, coding not for missing but rather for inapplicable information; for example, a database that quickly needs to support electric cars while having a miles-per-gallon column.\n\nCodd indicated in his 1990 book \"The Relational Model for Database Management, Version 2\" that the single Null mandated by the SQL standard was inadequate, and should be replaced by two separate Null-type markers to indicate the reason why data is missing. In Codd's book, these two Null-type markers are referred to as 'A-Values' and 'I-Values', representing 'Missing But Applicable' and 'Missing But Inapplicable', respectively. Codd's recommendation would have required SQL's logic system be expanded to accommodate a four-valued logic system. Because of this additional complexity, the idea of multiple Nulls with different definitions has not gained widespread acceptance in the database practitioners' domain. It remains an active field of research though, with numerous papers still being published.\n\nNull has been the focus of controversy and a source of debate because of its associated three-valued logic (3VL), special requirements for its use in SQL joins, and the special handling required by aggregate functions and SQL grouping operators. Computer science professor Ron van der Meyden summarized the various issues as: \"The inconsistencies in the SQL standard mean that it is not possible to ascribe any intuitive logical semantics to the treatment of nulls in SQL.\" Although various proposals have been made for resolving these issues, the complexity of the alternatives has prevented their widespread adoption.\n\nBecause Null is not a data value, but a marker for an absent value, using mathematical operators on Null gives an unknown result, which is represented by Null. In the following example, multiplying 10 by Null results in Null:\n10 * NULL -- Result is NULL\nThis can lead to unanticipated results. For instance, when an attempt is made to divide Null by zero, platforms may return Null instead of throwing an expected \"data exception — division by zero\". Though this behavior is not defined by the ISO SQL standard many DBMS vendors treat this operation similarly. For instance, the Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL Server, and Microsoft SQL Server platforms all return a Null result for the following:\nNULL / 0\nString concatenation operations, which are common in SQL, also result in Null when one of the operands is Null. The following example demonstrates the Null result returned by using Null with the SQL codice_2 string concatenation operator.\n'Fish ' || NULL || 'Chips' -- Result is NULL\n\nThis is not true for all database implementations. In an Oracle RDBMS for example NULL and the empty string are considered the same thing and therefore 'Fish ' || NULL || 'Chips' results in 'Fish Chips'.\n\nSince Null is not a member of any data domain, it is not considered a \"value\", but rather a marker (or placeholder) indicating the undefined value. Because of this, comparisons with Null can never result in either True or False, but always in a third logical result, Unknown. The logical result of the expression below, which compares the value 10 to Null, is Unknown:\nSELECT 10 = NULL -- Results in Unknown\nHowever, certain operations on Null can return values if the absent value is not relevant to the outcome of the operation. Consider the following example:\nSELECT NULL OR TRUE -- Results in True\nIn this case, the fact that the value on the left of OR is unknowable is irrelevant, because the outcome of the OR operation would be True regardless of the value on the left.\n\nSQL implements three logical results, so SQL implementations must provide for a specialized three-valued logic (3VL). The rules governing SQL three-valued logic are shown in the tables below (p and q represent logical states)\" The truth tables SQL uses for AND, OR, and NOT correspond to a common fragment of the Kleene and Łukasiewicz three-valued logic (which differ in their definition of implication, however SQL defines no such operation).\n\nSQL three-valued logic is encountered in Data Manipulation Language (DML) in comparison predicates of DML statements and queries. The codice_3 clause causes the DML statement to act on only those rows for which the predicate evaluates to True. Rows for which the predicate evaluates to either False or Unknown are not acted on by codice_4, codice_5, or codice_6 DML statements, and are discarded by codice_7 queries. Interpreting Unknown and False as the same logical result is a common error encountered while dealing with Nulls. The following simple example demonstrates this fallacy:\nSELECT *\nFROM t\nWHERE i = NULL;\nThe example query above logically always returns zero rows because the comparison of the \"i\" column with Null always returns Unknown, even for those rows where \"i\" is Null. The Unknown result causes the codice_7 statement to summarily discard each and every row. (However, in practice, some SQL tools will retrieve rows using a comparison with Null.)\n\nBasic SQL comparison operators always return Unknown when comparing anything with Null, so the SQL standard provides for two special Null-specific comparison predicates. The codice_9 and codice_10 predicates (which use a postfix syntax) test whether data is, or is not, Null.\n\nThe SQL standard contains the optional feature F571 \"Truth value tests\" that introduces three additional logical unary operators (six in fact, if we count their negation, which is part of their syntax), also using postfix notation. They have the following truth tables:\n\nThe F571 feature is orthogonal to the presence of the boolean datatype in SQL (discussed later in this article) and, despite syntactic similarities, F571 does not introduce boolean or three-valued literals in the language. The F571 feature was actually present in SQL92, well before the boolean datatype was introduced to the standard in 1999. The F571 feature is implemented by few systems however; PostgreSQL is one of those implementing it.\n\nThe addition of IS UNKNOWN to the other operators of SQL's three-valued logic makes the SQL three-valued logic functionally complete, meaning its logical operators can express (in combination) any conceivable three-valued logical function.\n\nOn systems which don't support the F571 feature, it is possible to emulate IS UNKNOWN \"p\" by going over every argument that could make the expression \"p\" Unknown and test those arguments with IS NULL or other NULL-specific functions, although this may be more cumbersome.\n\nIn SQL's three-valued logic the law of the excluded middle, \"p\" OR NOT \"p\", no longer evaluates to true for all \"p\". More precisely, in SQL's three-valued logic \"p\" OR NOT \"p\" is unknown precisely when \"p\" is unknown and true otherwise. Because direct comparisons with Null result in the unknown logical value, the following query\nSELECT * FROM stuff WHERE ( x = 10 ) OR NOT ( x = 10 );\nis not equivalent in SQL with\nSELECT * FROM stuff;\nif the column x contains any Nulls; in that case the second query would return some rows the first one does not return, namely all those in which x is Null. In classical two-valued logic, the law of the excluded middle would allow the simplification of the WHERE clause predicate, in fact its elimination. Attempting to apply the law of the excluded middle to SQL's 3VL is effectively a false dichotomy. The second query is actually equivalent with:\nSELECT * FROM stuff;\n-- is (because of 3VL) equivalent to:\nSELECT * FROM stuff WHERE ( x = 10 ) OR NOT ( x = 10 ) OR x IS NULL;\nThus, to correctly simplify the first statement in SQL requires that we return all rows in which x is not null.\nSELECT * FROM stuff WHERE x IS NOT NULL;\nIn view of the above, observe that for SQL's WHERE clause a tautology similar to the law of excluded middle can be written. Assuming the IS UNKNOWN operator is present, \"p\" OR (NOT \"p\") OR (\"p\" IS UNKNOWN) is true for every predicate \"p\". Among logicians, this is called law of excluded fourth.\n\nThere are some SQL expressions in which it is less obvious where the false dilemma occurs, for example:\n\nSELECT 'ok' WHERE 1 NOT IN (SELECT CAST (NULL AS INTEGER))\nUNION\nSELECT 'ok' WHERE 1 IN (SELECT CAST (NULL AS INTEGER));\n\nproduces no rows because codice_11 translates to an iterated version of equality over the argument set and 1<>NULL is Unknown, just as a 1=NULL is Unknown. (The CAST in this example is needed only in some SQL implementations like PostgreSQL, which would reject it with a type checking error otherwise. In many systems plain SELECT NULL works in the subquery.) The missing case above is of course:\nSELECT 'ok' WHERE (1 IN (SELECT CAST (NULL AS INTEGER))) IS UNKNOWN;\n\nJoins evaluate using the same comparison rules as for WHERE clauses. Therefore, care must be taken when using nullable columns in SQL join criteria. In particular a table containing any nulls is \"not equal\" with a natural self-join of itself, meaning that whereas formula_1 is true for any relation \"R\" in relational algebra, a SQL self-join will exclude all rows having a Null anywhere. An example of this behavior is given in the section analyzing the missing-value semantics of Nulls.\n\nThe SQL codice_12 function or codice_13 expressions can be used to \"simulate\" Null equality in join criteria, and the codice_9 and codice_10 predicates can be used in the join criteria as well. The following predicate tests for equality of the values A and B and treats Nulls as being equal.\nSQL provides two flavours of conditional expressions. One is called \"simple CASE\" and operates like a switch statement. The other is called a \"searched CASE\" in the standard, and operates like an if...elseif.\n\nThe simple codice_13 expressions use implicit equality comparisons which operate under the same rules as the DML codice_3 clause rules for Null. Thus, a \"simple codice_13 expression\" cannot check for the existence of Null directly. A check for Null in a simple codice_13 expression always results in Unknown, as in the following:\nSELECT CASE i WHEN NULL THEN 'Is Null' -- This will never be returned\nFROM t;\nBecause the expression codice_20 evaluates to Unknown no matter what value column \"i\" contains (even if it contains Null), the string codice_21 will never be returned.\n\nOn the other hand, a \"searched\" codice_13 expression can use predicates like codice_9 and codice_10 in its conditions. The following example shows how to use a searched codice_13 expression to properly check for Null:\nSELECT CASE WHEN i IS NULL THEN 'Null Result' -- This will be returned when i is NULL\nFROM t;\nIn the searched codice_13 expression, the string codice_27 is returned for all rows in which \"i\" is Null.\n\nOracle's dialect of SQL provides a built-in function codice_28 which can be used instead of the simple CASE expressions and considers two nulls equal.\nSELECT DECODE(i, NULL, 'Null Result', 0, 'Zero', 1, 'One') FROM t;\nFinally, all these constructs return a NULL if no match is found; they have a default codice_29 clause.\n\nSQL/PSM (SQL Persistent Stored Modules) defines procedural extensions for SQL, such as the codice_30 statement. However, the major SQL vendors have historically included their own proprietary procedural extensions. Procedural extensions for looping and comparisons operate under Null comparison rules similar to those for DML statements and queries. The following code fragment, in ISO SQL standard format, demonstrates the use of Null 3VL in an codice_30 statement.\nIF i = NULL THEN\nELSEIF NOT(i = NULL) THEN\nELSE\nThe codice_30 statement performs actions only for those comparisons that evaluate to True. For statements that evaluate to False or Unknown, the codice_30 statement passes control to the codice_34 clause, and finally to the codice_35 clause. The result of the code above will always be the message codice_36 since the comparisons with Null always evaluate to Unknown.\n\nThe groundbreaking work of T. Imieliński and W. Lipski Jr. (1984) provided a framework in which to evaluate the intended semantics of various proposals to implement missing-value semantics, that is referred to as Imieliński-Lipski Algebras. This section roughly follows chapter 19 of the \"Alice\" textbook. A similar presentation appears in the review of Ron van der Meyden, §10.4.\n\nConstructs representing missing information, such as Codd tables, are actually intended to represent a set of relations, one for each possible instantiation of their parameters; in the case of Codd tables, this means replacement of Nulls with some concrete value. For example,\n\nA construct (such as a Codd table) is said to be a \"strong representation\" system (of missing information) if any answer to a query made on the construct can be particularized to obtain an answer for \"any\" corresponding query on the relations it represents, which are seen as models of the construct. More precisely, if formula_2 is a query formula in the relational algebra (of \"pure\" relations) and if formula_3 is its lifting to a construct intended to represent missing information, a strong representation has the property that for any query \"q\" and (table) construct \"T\", formula_3 lifts \"all\" the answers to the construct, i.e.:\n\n(The above has to hold for queries taking any number of tables as arguments, but the restriction to one table suffices for this discussion.) Clearly Codd tables do not have this strong property if selections and projections are considered as part of the query language. For example, \"all\" the answers to\nSELECT * FROM Emp WHERE Age = 22;\nshould include the possibility that a relation like EmpH22 may exist. However Codd tables cannot represent the disjunction \"result with possibly 0 or 1 rows\". A device, mostly of theoretical interest, called conditional table (or c-table) can however represent such an answer:\n\nwhere the condition column is interpreted as the row doesn't exist if the condition is false. It turns out that because the formulas in the condition column of a c-table can be arbitrary propositional logic formulas, an algorithm for the problem whether a c-table represents some concrete relation has a co-NP-complete complexity, thus is of little practical worth.\n\nA weaker notion of representation is therefore desirable. Imielinski and Lipski introduced the notion of \"weak representation\", which essentially allows (lifted) queries over a construct to return a representation only for \"sure\" information, i.e. if it's valid for all \"possible world\" instantiations (models) of the construct. Concretely, a construct is a weak representation system if\n\nThe right-hand side of the above equation is the \"sure\" information, i.e. information which can be certainly extracted from the database regardless of what values are used to replace Nulls in the database. In the example we considered above, it's easy to see that the intersection of all possible models (i.e. the sure information) of the query selecting WHERE Age = 22 is actually empty because, for instance, the (unlifted) query returns no rows for the relation EmpH37. More generally, it was shown by Imielinski and Lipski that Codd tables are a weak representation system if the query language is restricted to projections, selections (and renaming of columns). However, as soon as we add either joins or unions to the query language, even this weak property is lost, as evidenced in the next section.\n\nConsider the following query over the same Codd table Emp from the previous section:\nSELECT Name FROM Emp WHERE Age = 22\nUNION\nSELECT Name FROM Emp WHERE Age <> 22;\nWhatever concrete value one would choose for the NULL age of Harriet, the above query will return the full column of names of any model of Emp, but when the (lifted) query is run on Emp itself, Harriet will always be missing, i.e. we have:\n\nThus when unions are added to the query language, Codd tables are not even a weak representation system of missing information, meaning that queries over them don't even report all \"sure\" information. It's important to note here that semantics of UNION on Nulls, which are discussed in a later section, did not even come into play in this query. The \"forgetful\" nature of the two sub-queries was all that it took to guarantee that some sure information went unreported when the above query was run on the Codd table Emp.\n\nFor natural joins, the example needed to show that sure information may be unreported by some query is slightly more complicated. Consider the table\n\nand the query\nSELECT F1, F3 FROM\n\nThe intuition for what happens above is that the Codd tables representing the projections in the subqueries lose track of the fact that the Nulls in the columns F12.F2 and F23.F2 are actually copies of the originals in the table J. This observation suggests that a relatively simple improvement of Codd tables (which works correctly for this example) would be to use \"Skolem constants\" (meaning Skolem functions which are also constant functions), say ω and ω instead of a single NULL symbol. Such an approach, called v-tables or Naive tables, is computationally less expensive that the c-tables discussed above. However it is still not a complete solution for incomplete information in the sense that v-tables are only a weak representation for queries not using any negations in selection (and not using any set difference either). The first example considered in this section is using a negative selection clause, WHERE Age <> 22, so it is also an example where v-tables queries would not report sure information.\n\nThe primary place in which SQL three-valued logic intersects with SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) is in the form of check constraints. A check constraint placed on a column operates under a slightly different set of rules than those for the DML codice_3 clause. While a DML codice_3 clause must evaluate to True for a row, a check constraint must not evaluate to False. (From a logic perspective, the designated values are True and Unknown.) This means that a check constraint will succeed if the result of the check is either True or Unknown. The following example table with a check constraint will prohibit any integer values from being inserted into column \"i\", but will allow Null to be inserted since the result of the check will always evaluate to Unknown for Nulls.\nCREATE TABLE t (\nBecause of the change in designated values relative to the WHERE clause, from a logic perspective the law of excluded middle is a tautology for CHECK constraints, meaning CHECK (\"p\" OR NOT \"p\") always succeeds. Furthermore, assuming Nulls are to be interpreted as existing but unknown values, some pathological CHECKs like the one above allow insertion of Nulls that could never be replaced by any non-null value.\n\nIn order to constrain a column to reject Nulls, the codice_39 constraint can be applied, as shown in the example below. The codice_39 constraint is semantically equivalent to a check constraint with an codice_10 predicate.\nCREATE TABLE t ( i INTEGER NOT NULL );\nBy default check constraints against foreign keys succeed if any of the fields in such keys are Null. For example, the table\nCREATE TABLE Books\n( title VARCHAR(100),\nFOREIGN KEY (author_last, author_first)\nwould allow insertion of rows where author_last or author_first are NULL irrespective of how the table Authors is defined or what it contains. More precisely, a null in any of these fields would allow any value in the other one, even on that is not found in Authors table. For example, if Authors contained only ('Doe', 'John'), then ('Smith', NULL) would satisfy the foreign key constraint. SQL-92 added two extra options for narrowing down the matches in such cases. If codice_42 is added after the codice_43 declaration then any non-null must match the foreign key, e. g. ('Doe', NULL) would still match, but ('Smith', NULL) would not. Finally, if codice_44 is added then ('Smith', NULL) would not match the constraint either, but (NULL, NULL) would still match it.\n\nSQL outer joins, including left outer joins, right outer joins, and full outer joins, automatically produce Nulls as placeholders for missing values in related tables. For left outer joins, for instance, Nulls are produced in place of rows missing from the table appearing on the right-hand side of the codice_45 operator. The following simple example uses two tables to demonstrate Null placeholder production in a left outer join.\n\nThe first table (Employee) contains employee ID numbers and names, while the second table (PhoneNumber) contains related employee ID numbers and phone numbers, as shown below.\n\nThe following sample SQL query performs a left outer join on these two tables.\nSELECT e.ID, e.LastName, e.FirstName, pn.Number\nFROM Employee e\nLEFT OUTER JOIN PhoneNumber pn\nON e.ID = pn.ID;\nThe result set generated by this query demonstrates how SQL uses Null as a placeholder for values missing from the right-hand (PhoneNumber) table, as shown below.\n\nSQL defines aggregate functions to simplify server-side aggregate calculations on data. Except for the codice_46 function, all aggregate functions perform a Null-elimination step, so that Nulls are not included in the final result of the calculation.\n\nNote that the elimination of Null is not equivalent to replacing Null with zero. For example, in the following table, codice_47 (the average of the values of codice_48) will give a different result from that of codice_49:\n\nHere codice_47 is 200 (the average of 150, 200, and 250), while codice_49 is 150 (the average of 150, 200, 250, and 0). A well-known side effect of this is that in SQL codice_52 is equivalent with not codice_53 but codice_54.\n\nThe output of an aggregate function can also be Null. Here is an example:\nSELECT COUNT(*), MIN(e.Wage), MAX(e.Wage)\nFROM Employee e\nWHERE e.LastName LIKE '%Jones%';\nThis query will always output exactly one row, counting of the number of employees whose last name contains \"Jones\", and giving the minimum and maximum wage found for those employees. However, what happens if none of the employees fit the given criteria? Calculating the minimum or maximum value of an empty set is impossible, so those results must be NULL, indicating there is no answer. This is not an Unknown value, it is a Null representing the absence of a value. The result would be:\n\nBecause defines all Null markers as being unequal to one another, a special definition was required in order to group Nulls together when performing certain operations. SQL defines \"any two values that are equal to one another, or any two Nulls\", as \"not distinct\". This definition of \"not distinct\" allows SQL to group and sort Nulls when the codice_55 clause (and other keywords that perform grouping) are used.\n\nOther SQL operations, clauses, and keywords use \"not distinct\" in their treatment of Nulls. These include the following:\n\n\nThe principle that Nulls aren't equal to each other (but rather that the result is Unknown) is effectively violated in the SQL specification for the codice_58 operator, which does identify nulls with each other. Consequently, some set operations in SQL, like union or difference, may produce results not representing sure information, unlike operations involving explicit comparisons with NULL (e.g. those in a codice_3 clause discussed above). In Codd's 1979 proposal (which was basically adopted by SQL92) this semantic inconsistency is rationalized by arguing that removal of duplicates in set operations happens \"at a lower level of detail than equality testing in the evaluation of retrieval operations.\"\n\nThe SQL standard does not explicitly define a default sort order for Nulls. Instead, on conforming systems, Nulls can be sorted before or after all data values by using the codice_65 or codice_66 clauses of the codice_67 list, respectively. Not all DBMS vendors implement this functionality, however. Vendors who do not implement this functionality may specify different treatments for Null sorting in the DBMS.\n\nSome SQL products do not index keys containing NULLs. For instance, PostgreSQL versions prior to 8.3 did not, with the documentation for a B-tree index stating that\nIn cases where the index enforces uniqueness, NULLs are excluded from the index and uniqueness is not enforced between NULLs. Again, quoting from the PostgreSQL documentation:\nThis is consistent with the -defined behavior of scalar Null comparisons.\n\nAnother method of indexing Nulls involves handling them as \"not distinct\" in accordance with the SQL:2003-defined behavior. For example, Microsoft SQL Server documentation states the following:\nBoth of these indexing strategies are consistent with the SQL:2003-defined behavior of Nulls. Because indexing methodologies are not explicitly defined by the SQL:2003 standard, indexing strategies for Nulls are left entirely to the vendors to design and implement.\n\nSQL defines two functions to explicitly handle Nulls: codice_68 and codice_12. Both functions are abbreviations for searched codice_13 expressions.\n\nThe codice_68 function accepts two parameters. If the first parameter is equal to the second parameter, codice_68 returns Null. Otherwise, the value of the first parameter is returned.\nNULLIF(value1, value2)\nThus, codice_68 is an abbreviation for the following codice_13 expression:\nCASE WHEN value1 = value2 THEN NULL ELSE value1 END\nThe codice_12 function accepts a list of parameters, returning the first non-Null value from the list:\nCOALESCE(value1, value2, value3, ...)\ncodice_12 is defined as shorthand for the following SQL codice_13 expression:\nCASE WHEN value1 IS NOT NULL THEN value1\nSome SQL DBMSs implement vendor-specific functions similar to codice_12. Some systems (e.g. Transact-SQL) implement an codice_79 function, or other similar functions that are functionally similar to codice_12. (See codice_81 functions for more on the codice_82 functions in Transact-SQL.)\n\nThe Oracle codice_83 function accepts two parameters. It returns the first non-NULL parameter or NULL if all parameters are NULL.\n\nA codice_12 expression can be converted into an equivalent codice_83 expression thus:\n\nCOALESCE ( val1, ... , val{n} )\nturns into:\nNVL( val1 , NVL( val2 , NVL( val3 , … , NVL ( val{n-1} , val{n} ) … )))\nA use case of this function is to replace in an expression a NULL by a value like in codice_86 which says, 'if codice_87 is NULL, replace it with the value 0'.\n\nThere is, however, one notable exception. In most implementations, codice_12 evaluates its parameters until it reaches the first non-NULL one, while codice_83 evaluates all of its parameters. This is important for several reasons. A parameter \"after\" the first non-NULL parameter could be a function, which could either be computationally expensive, invalid, or could create unexpected side effects.\n\nThe codice_1 literal is untyped in SQL, meaning that it is not designated as an integer, character, or any other specific data type. Because of this, it is sometimes mandatory (or desirable) to explicitly convert Nulls to a specific data type. For instance, if overloaded functions are supported by the RDBMS, SQL might not be able to automatically resolve to the correct function without knowing the data types of all parameters, including those for which Null is passed.\n\nConversion from the codice_1 literal to a Null of a specific type is possible using the codice_92 introduced in SQL-92. For example:\nCAST (NULL AS INTEGER)\nrepresents an absent value of type INTEGER.\n\nThe actual typing of Unknown (distinct or not from NULL itself) varies between SQL implementations. For example, the following\nSELECT 'ok' WHERE (NULL <> 1) IS NULL;\nparses and executes successfully in some environments (e.g. SQLite or PostgreSQL) which unify a NULL boolean with Unknown but fails to parse in others (e.g. in SQL Server Compact). MySQL behaves similarly to PostgreSQL in this regard (with the minor exception that MySQL regards TRUE and FALSE as no different from the ordinary integers 1 and 0). PostgreSQL additionally implements a codice_93 predicate, which can be used to test whether a three-value logical outcome is Unknown, although this is merely syntactic sugar.\n\nThe ISO standard introduced the BOOLEAN data type to SQL, however it's still just an optional, non-core feature, coded T031.\n\nWhen restricted by a codice_39 constraint, the SQL BOOLEAN works like the Boolean type from other languages. Unrestricted however, the BOOLEAN datatype, despite its name, can hold the truth values TRUE, FALSE, and UNKNOWN, all of which are defined as boolean literals according to the standard. The standard also asserts that NULL and UNKNOWN \"may be used\ninterchangeably to mean exactly the same thing\".\n\nThe Boolean type has been subject of criticism, particularly because of the mandated behavior of the UNKNOWN literal, which is never equal to itself because of the identification with NULL.\n\nAs discussed above, in the PostgreSQL implementation of SQL, Null is used to represent all UNKNOWN results, including the UNKNOWN BOOLEAN. PostgreSQL does not implement the UNKNOWN literal (although it does implement the IS UNKNOWN operator, which is an orthogonal feature.) Most other major vendors do not support the Boolean type (as defined in T031) as of 2012. The procedural part of Oracle's PL/SQL supports BOOLEAN however variables; these can also be assigned NULL and the value is considered the same as UNKNOWN.\n\nMisunderstanding of how Null works is the cause of a great number of errors in SQL code, both in ISO standard SQL statements and in the specific SQL dialects supported by real-world database management systems. These mistakes are usually the result of confusion between Null and either 0 (zero) or an empty string (a string value with a length of zero, represented in SQL as codice_95). Null is defined by the SQL standard as different from both an empty string and the numerical value codice_96, however. While Null indicates the absence of any value, the empty string and numerical zero both represent actual values.\n\nA classic error is the attempt to use the equals operator codice_97 in combination with the keyword codice_1 to find rows with Nulls. According to the SQL standard this is an invalid syntax and shall lead to an error message or an exception. But most implementations accept the syntax and evaluate such expressions to codice_99. The consequence is that no rows are found - regardless of whether rows with Nulls exist or not. The proposed way to retrieve rows with Nulls is the use of the predicate codice_9 instead of codice_101.\nSELECT *\nFROM sometable\nWHERE num = NULL; -- Should be \"WHERE num IS NULL\"\nIn a related, but more subtle example, a codice_3 clause or conditional statement might compare a column's value with a constant. It is often incorrectly assumed that a missing value would be \"less than\" or \"not equal to\" a constant if that field contains Null, but, in fact, such expressions return Unknown. An example is below:\nSELECT *\nFROM sometable\nWHERE num <> 1; -- Rows where num is NULL will not be returned,\nThese confusions arise because the Law of Identity is restricted in SQL's logic. When dealing with equality comparisons using the codice_1 literal or the codice_99 truth-value, SQL will always return codice_99 as the result of the expression. This is a partial equivalence relation and makes SQL an example of a \"Non-Reflexive logic\".\n\nSimilarly, Nulls are often confused with empty strings. Consider the codice_106 function, which returns the number of characters in a string. When a Null is passed into this function, the function returns Null. This can lead to unexpected results, if users are not well versed in 3-value logic. An example is below:\nSELECT *\nFROM sometable\nWHERE LENGTH(string) < 20; -- Rows where string is NULL will not be returned.\nThis is complicated by the fact that in some database interface programs (or even database implementations like Oracle's), NULL is reported as an empty string, and empty strings may be incorrectly stored as NULL.\n\nThe ISO SQL implementation of Null is the subject of criticism, debate and calls for change. In \"The Relational Model for Database Management: Version 2\", Codd suggested that the SQL implementation of Null was flawed and should be replaced by two distinct Null-type markers. The markers he proposed were to stand for \"\"Missing but Applicable\"\" and \"\"Missing but Inapplicable\"\", known as \"A-values\" and \"I-values\", respectively. Codd's recommendation, if accepted, would have required the implementation of a four-valued logic in SQL. Others have suggested adding additional Null-type markers to Codd's recommendation to indicate even more reasons that a data value might be \"Missing\", increasing the complexity of SQL's logic system. At various times, proposals have also been put forth to implement multiple user-defined Null markers in SQL. Because of the complexity of the Null-handling and logic systems required to support multiple Null markers, none of these proposals have gained widespread acceptance.\n\nChris Date and Hugh Darwen, authors of \"The Third Manifesto\", have suggested that the SQL Null implementation is inherently flawed and should be eliminated altogether, pointing to inconsistencies and flaws in the implementation of SQL Null-handling (particularly in aggregate functions) as proof that the entire concept of Null is flawed and should be removed from the relational model. Others, like author Fabian Pascal, have stated a belief that \"how the function calculation should treat missing values is not governed by the relational model.\"\n\nAnother point of conflict concerning Nulls is that they violate the closed-world assumption model of relational databases by introducing an open-world assumption into it. The closed world assumption, as it pertains to databases, states that \"Everything stated by the database, either explicitly or implicitly, is true; everything else is false.\" This view assumes that the knowledge of the world stored within a database is complete. Nulls, however, operate under the open world assumption, in which some items stored in the database are considered unknown, making the database's stored knowledge of the world incomplete.\n\n\n\n"}

It was due to be introduced in 2009, but was repeatedly delayed. The Russian government terminated its involvement in the project in May 2010 and withdrew all funding.\n\nMost information about this tank was speculative. The design was presumably a significant departure from the Soviet-era tanks currently in service. In particular, it was expected to have a new hydropneumatic suspension with adaptive features, and the entire crew was apparently going to be placed in a sealed compartment inside the hull, isolated from other tank components.\n\nT-95 was a name given to the tank by media; it was not an official name. According to published sources, development of a new tank called \"Object 195\" began at the Uralvagonzavod design bureau in the early 1990s.\n\nThe prototype tank was announced by the Russian Minister of Defense Igor Sergeyev in 2000. On July 10, 2008 the Russian government announced that the Russian armed forces would start receiving new-generation tanks superior to the T-90 main battle tank after 2010. \"The T-90 MBT will be the backbone of the armored units until 2025. T-72's and T-80's will not be modernized and will be eventually replaced by new-generation tanks, which will start entering service after 2010\", a news conference with Sergei Mayev, head of the Federal Service for Defence Contracts.\n\nOn the first day of Russian Defence Expo 2010 in Nizhny Tagil, The Director of the Federal Service for Military-Technical Cooperation of the Russian Federation, Konstantin Biryulin, announced to the press that the Russian state monopoly Federal Service for Defense Contracts was unveiling the prototype of new battle tank called \"Object 195\" (T-95) in a private showing to selected VIP guests, though the tank has yet to be seen by journalists or confirmed publicly by any of the participants.\n\nHowever, in May 2010, deputy defense minister and chief of armaments Vladimir Popovkin announced that a number of programs for development of new armor and artillery weapons would be canceled. The main victim is the Object 195 program. Popovkin said the military will focus on modernization of the T-90 instead. The reason given for this was the fact that the T-95 was already obsolete, as it had been in development for almost two decades, but some sources speculated it had more to do with the recent reduction in Russia's military budget, requiring substantial cuts across the board.\n\nPopovkin confirmed this decision in a June 2010 Interview, stating that Russia would no longer fund and was not going to buy the T-95, but that Uralvagonzavod might continue to work on the tank without government support. In early July 2010, as reported by \"Ural Information Bureau\" : the Minister of Industry and Science, Sverdlovsk region, Alexander Petrov said that Uralvagonzavod would soon finalize a T-95 prototype, entirely independently. However without state funding or export permits, the company would be unable to proceed to production.\n\n"}

Cabela's was founded by Richard N. Cabela in 1961.\n\nCabela's mail-order catalogs are shipped to 50 states and 120 countries. More than 120 million catalogs were mailed in its first year as a public company. It also has \"Trophy Properties LLC\" (a real estate market), the \"Gun Library\" (for buying and selling new, used, and collectible firearms), and World's Foremost Bank (the issuer of Cabela's Club Visa credit cards).\n\nThe company that would become a sporting goods reseller and chain was started in 1961. Richard (Dick) N. Cabela purchased $45 worth of fishing flies at a furniture expo in Chicago which he then advertised for sale in a local newspaper advertisement. When his first effort produced only one response, he placed an ad in a national magazine, \"Sports Afield\", which was more successful. Included with each order was a catalog of other products for sale by Cabela.\n\nAs the business grew, Cabela and his wife Mary moved their operation to Sidney, Nebraska in 1963. Dick's brother Jim also joined the business. From those beginnings, the company has since grown to a publicly traded corporation with over $3 billion in annual sales.\n\nOn February 17, 2014, founder Dick Cabela died at his home in Sidney, Nebraska, at the age of 77.\n\nAbout half of Cabela's sales come from hunting-related merchandise with about a third derived from the sale of firearms, ammunition and accessories in 2012. Additionally, in 2012 30% of revenue came from direct sales (through catalog and online orders), and 59% from physical retail stores. The remaining 11% of revenue came from its financial subsidiary and credit card business.\n\nIn 1996 Gander Mountain, prior to declaring bankruptcy, sold its mail order business to Cabela's with a non-compete clause. In 2007, Cabelas brought suit against them to prevent their re-entry into the mail-order business. Gander Mountain won the lawsuit and began selling online as well.\n\nIn February 2013, Cabela's sued Gander Mountain for patent infringement over a fold-up cot that Gander was selling. In December 2013, Gander sued Cabela's for cybersquatting.\n\nIn March 2014, Cabela's sold their recreational real estate division, Cabela's Trophy Properties, to \"Sports Afield\".\n\nIn December 2015, Cabela's sold their Outdoor Adventures & T.A.G.S. divisions to Worldwide Trophy Adventures.\n\nOn October 3, 2016, Bass Pro Shops announced an agreement to acquire Cabela's for $5.5 billion.\n\nCurrently, the largest Cabela's retail facility is in Hamburg, Pennsylvania, with more than of floor space.\n\nIn 2007, Cabela's purchased family-owned S.I.R. Warehouse Sports Store in Winnipeg. In 2010, the Canadian Head Office and Distribution Centre moved across the city, leaving the original location as only a retail store. The company had intended to be a part of the Lac-Mirabel project near Montreal, which was to include of retail space, and was planned to open in 2008. But instead, rival chain Bass Pro Shops became one of the mall anchors. In 2011 Cabela's opened a store in Edmonton, Alberta and a store opened in Saskatoon in 2012 another store in Calgary, Alberta opened in 2015. \n\nIn early 2012, Cabela's unveiled a new retail initiative called Cabela's Outpost Stores. The first outpost store opened in Union Gap in the fall of 2012.\n\nCabela's stores have been a target of gun thieves over the years. One store alone in South Carolina lost around 100 guns within a one year range. \n\nOn July 5, 2017, the Federal Trade Commission approved the acquisition of Cabela's by Bass Pro Shops. The acquisition was complete on September 25, 2017.”\n\nFounded on March 23, 2001 (FDIC Certificate #57079), Cabela's financial subsidiary is named World's Foremost Bank (WFB, a play on Cabela's marketing moniker, World's Foremost Outfitter). The bank's primary activity is as a credit card issuer for the Cabela's Club Visa card, a branded rewards card. With 11% of total sales attributed to the subsidiary, in 2013 it ranked as the 13th largest issuer of credit cards in the US. Around a third of Cabela's customers have this Visa card.\n\nThe subsidiary consists of a single-branch bank with a deposit market share in the state of Nebraska of just under 1.2 percent, with $505 million in deposits as of 2011. As of the end of 2012, the bank claimed to have $3,731,567,000 in assets.\n\nSean Baker was appointed president of World's Foremost Bank and chief executive officer on January 1, 2013. Baker replaced Joseph M. Friebe, whose planned retirement was announced in June 2012.\n\nIn its annual report, Cabela's announced that it has reached a settlement with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) regarding its credit card policies and practices. It was ordered to repay wronged cardholders $10 million plus a $250,000 penalty. The subsidiary did not admit to or deny the FDIC's finding, but agreed to do the following:\nAdditionally, the FDIC required WFB to make certain changes in their management policy to increase oversight of their credit card business and to prevent further unfair practices.\n\nThe Bank entered into a $411.7 million commitment with the Royal Bank of Canada under a series of variable funding notes issued by Cabela's Credit Card Master Note Trust. The loan is for three years and accrues interest at a variable rate of commercial paper plus a spread.\n\nCabela's has produced several series of video games for a variety of gaming platforms, including \"Cabela's Legendary Adventures\", \"Cabela's Big Game Hunter\" series, \"Cabela's Dangerous Hunts\" series, and \"Cabela's Outdoor Adventures\" series.\n\nCabela's Legendary Adventures sponsors Richard Childress Racing driver Daniel Hemric in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series in partnership with Bass Pro Shops.

{"id": "2002586", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2002586", "title": "Týr (band)", "text": "Týr (band)\n\nTýr () is a Faroese folk metal band. They have been characterised as one of \"the islands' two most successful metal bands\". Their subject matter revolves almost entirely around Viking lore, mythology, and history, taking their name from Týr, the god of war in Norse religion.\n\nBefore \"Týr\", Heri Joensen and Gunnar H. Thomsen formed their first band, Cruiser, at the age of seventeen. Streymoy also played with them for a short while. They later changed their name to Wolfgang. Although neither band released any albums, Wolfgang, who are still active, recorded an undisclosed number of songs that, according to Joensen, are \"pretty much ready to release.\"\n\n\"Týr\" formed in Copenhagen in 1998. Heri Joensen met his old bandmate, Kári Streymoy, at a party in January in Copenhagen. Joensen suggested to Streymoy that they should meet up and jam. Streymoy initially declined, but later took him up on his offer. They were soon joined by another former bandmate, bassist Gunnar H. Thomsen, expanding the duo into a trio. In 2001, guitarist Terji Skibenæs joined the band.\n\nThey signed a worldwide deal with Austria's Napalm Records in early 2006, while signed to the Faroese record label Tutl. In September 2012, they signed a three-album deal with Metal Blade Records.\n\nThey began making music which was heavily inspired by Norse mythology, kvæði (Faroese traditional music), and heavy metal music in general. According to the band's frontman Heri Joensen:\n\nAccordingly, scholarship has found that the band's lyrics and imagery promote pan-Nordic ideologies, and draw on well established, transnational genre conventions from metal music; but has also suggested that the band's insistence on their Faroese identity, which has been fetishised by international audiences, could 'be regarded as a form of self-exoticisation'. The band's handling of traditional songs is characterised by fidelity to traditional melodies, but more complex and innovative handling of associated chord progressions and harmonies.\n\nThe band has been accused of promoting Nazi ideologies through their use of runes and other imagery appropriated by Nazis. The band responded to these accusations with the song \"Shadow of the Swastika\" on the album \"Lay of Thrym\" (2011), which in the assessment of Karl Spracklen, 'attacks the far-right for appropriating...heathen symbols and images associated with pre-Christian northern Europe'. Even so, scholars have, in the words of Catherine Hoad and Samuel Whiting, suggested that 'through imagining the Viking as an ancestral, genetic category, the “common past” of the Nordic people is constructed as a self-identity apart from other people' in the work of Týr. Likewise, Spracklen finds that 'the themes in Týr’s songs celebrate pagan identity, Viking identity and the hegemonic masculinity of the Viking warrior combined with the modern-day heavy metal anthem of being an individual'.\n\nThey performed at the Ragnarök Festival in 2007 and 2009.\n\n\"Týr\" was a part of the Paganfest tour in Europe and the U.S. in 2008, with Ensiferum headlining. Other bands on the tour included Eluveitie, Turisas in the United States, and Moonsorrow and Korpiklaani joined them on the European part of the tour.\n\nIn 2009, the band also took part in the \"Black Sails over Europe\" tour, supporting Alestorm, who were promoting their album \"Black Sails at Midnight\".\n\nLater, in 2010, the band would support Amon Amarth and Holy Grail on Amon Amarth's North American tour for select dates.\n\nIn January 2011 and 2013, \"Týr\" played on the \"70,000 Tons of Metal\" cruise ship event with 40 other bands.\n\nIn 2012, the band supported Korpiklaani on their \"Manala\" tour in the US and Canada along with Metsatöll and Moonsorrow.\n\nDuring April 2013, \"Týr\" joined Ensiferum, Heidevolk, and others for the North American leg of the Paganfest tour.\n\nThey took part in a European tour between 6 September - 14 October 2013 with Finnish folk metal band Finntroll and Icelandic band Skálmöld. The tour is called \"Blodsvept over Europe\".\n\nSinger Pól Arni Holm and guitarist Jón Joensen (Heri Joensen's brother) were part of the band while they recorded \"How Far to Asgaard\" but left soon after its release.\n\nTerji Skibenæs joined after Jón Joensen had left the band. Allan Streymoy (Kári Streymoy's brother) took over singing duties for a brief time during which they released the single \"Ólavur Riddararós\". After Allan left, Heri Joensen took over the vocals. It was this line up which recorded \"Eric the Red\".\n\nSkibenæs left the band for a while after the release of \"Eric the Red\". The band played as a trio for some time. In the summer of 2004 they were joined by Icelandic guitarist Ottó P. Arnarson for a very brief time. When Arnarson left, Skibenæs came back.\n\nKári Streymoy had a back injury in January 2008, which made him unable to tour until October the same year. Amon Djurhuus, a Faeroese drummer and student of Kári Streymoy, played the drums on the European part of the Paganfest, Merlin Sutter from Eluveitie filled for him on the US part and Daniel Ryan from Gigan on the Canadian part. After that for the festival tour in Europe Amon Djurhuus filled for Kári again. In October 2008 Kári Streymoy was ready to go again for the Ragnarök's Aaskereia Festival Tour.\n\n\"Týr\" announced on 12 May 2013 via their official website as well as their Facebook, Twitter and Myspace pages that they had parted ways with long-time drummer Kári Streymoy, owing to the back injury he had received in 2008 which had affected his drumming. On May 15, 2013, they announced that renowned metal drummer George Kollias will record drums for their seventh album Valkyrja. Amon Djurhuus enters temporarily in the band, once again, for the tour with Finntroll between September and October 2013.\n\nIn August 2018, after 17 years with the band Terji Skibenæs announced his departure, stating \"There's no drama or anything going on between me and the others. It's just me not having any joy to play the music in the style of TÝR anymore. I want to thank Heri Joensen and Gunnar Thomsen for the all the time we had and I wish TÝR all the best in the future.\" The opening left by Skibenæs' exit was filled by former Nevermore and Satyricon guitarist Attila Vörös.\n\nCurrent \"Týr\" lead singer, Heri Joensen, is working on a side project with the band Heljareyga. They released their self-titled debut album in 2010. All lyrics on the album are in Faroese. It was released first as a download on February 12, 2010 at digital retailers, but CD copies came later available at Tutl Records.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He “arrived in Philadelphia in 1717 with nearly no money; at the time of his death in 1752, his wealth outstripped that of the contemporary elite more than threefold...an immigrant’s path to achieving the American Dream.\"\n\nHe was the father of Richard Wistar, Sr. (1727-1781), glassmaker and landowner in Pennsylvania and the grandfather of Caspar Wistar (1761-1818), the physician and anatomist after whom the genus \"Wisteria\" is named.\n\nCaspar Wistar, the son of forester Hans Caspar Wüster, spent his first 21 years in Waldhilsbach, a village in the Palatinate near Heidelberg under the reign of the Elector of the Palatinate Prince Philipp Wilhelm (1658-1716). According to family tradition, he was born in the village's Foresthaus (Forester’s house).\n\nHe grew up during the tumultuous Nine Years' War (1688-1697) and the War of the Spanish Succession (1702-1713) which caused hardships and instability for the people of the Palatinate due to invasions by the French and British. \n\nWistar served as a foresters' apprentice, but government reforms limited his professional opportunities, so he decided to emigrate to the United States. \n\nHe left the Palatinate in 1717, forgoing his father’s hereditary title and position to seek out a new life across the Atlantic Ocean. \n\nHe arrived in Pennsylvania in 1717 (according to his memoir, with only nine pennies to his name). Upon his arrival, he was registered under the surname \"Wistar\". He worked at various manual trades, including soapmaking and the manufacture of brass buttons.\n\nHe became a British subject in 1724 and joined the Religious Society of Friends (the Quakers) in 1726. He married Catherine Jansen in 1727; they had seven children. With the support of Quaker merchants and political leaders, he set up a glass factory and began buying land and selling it to new immigrants from Germany. His land deals made him one of the richest men in Pennsylvania.\n\nHis brother, John (born Johannes Wüster) (1708–1789) emigrated to Philadelphia in 1727. His brother Johannes WÜSTER) (John WISTER (1708–1789)) settled in the Germantown district, and was registered under a variant of the surname, “Wister.” To this day there exists two spellings of the family name. While Caspar anglicized his name to \"Wistar\", John spelled his \"Wister\". The two each founded prominent Philadelphia-area families, and the difference in spelling persisted.\n\n"}

He won the world amateur sprint title in 1947, two Olympic silver medals in 1948, and the professional title in 1949, 1950, 1951 and 1954. His ferocious will to win made him a household name in the 1950s, but he also surprised many with a comeback more than 20 years later, winning a British title in 1974 at the age of 54.\n\nHarris was born as Reginald Hargreaves at 7 Garden Street, Birtle, Bury, Lancashire. His mother, Elsie Hargreaves, a cotton weaver, remarried and Reginald took the name of his stepfather, an engineer and businessman called Joseph Harris.\n\nReg Harris left school without qualifications and his first job was as an apprentice motor mechanic in Bury, soon moving from the workshop to the salesroom. During this period, at the age of 14, he bought his first bicycle, and entered a roller-racing competition organised by the Hercules bicycle manufacturing company.\n\nHis ability attracted the attention of other cyclists and Harris joined the Bury section of the Cyclists' Touring Club and then its racing offshoot, the Lancashire Road Club. In 1935, he won his first race, a half-mile handicap event held on a grass track in Bury, and also started competing in individual time trials.\n\nHarris moved from the motor mechanics job to a slipper factory, then, in early 1936, to a paper mill which he felt would pay him enough in the winter to spend the summer training and competing. During 1936, he raced on grass tracks in Lincolnshire, then competed in and won his first events in conventional competition at Fallowfield Stadium in Fallowfield, Manchester.\n\nIn early 1937, he was confident he could support himself as an athlete, selling the prizes he won as an amateur, and left the paper mill to focus on the summer cycle racing season, returning to the mill the following winter (repeating the process the following year). He continued to win races and attract attention, and by the summer of 1938 was able to beat the existing British sprint champion. At the end of that season, he joined Manchester Wheelers' Club, and in 1939 won a major race in Coventry, leading to his selection for the world championship in Milan, Italy. He travelled to Milan and had familiarised himself with the Velodromo Vigorelli when World War II broke out and the British team was recalled to the UK.\n\nHarris joined the 10th Hussars in the North Africa Campaign as a tank driver but was wounded, transferred to the Royal Army Service Corps, and later invalided out of the services as medically unfit in 1943. He liked to joke that he was one of the few men to leave the army less fit than when he joined. Despite the judgment of the army medics, in 1944, he won the , quarter-mile and five-mile (8 km) national cycling championships. He retained the two shorter titles in 1945 and added the half-mile on grass. He was invited to race in Paris in 1945 and again impressed the crowds, and he was expected to do well in the 1946 world championships in Zurich, Switzerland, only to have his chances ruined by an over-enthusiastic pre-race massage. Harris's amateur world championship achievements were celebrated in 1947 when \"Cycling Weekly\" awarded him his own page in the \"Golden Book of Cycling\".\nBy the time Harris won the world amateur sprint title in Paris in 1947, he was already employed and equipped by bicycle manufacturer Claud Butler and was testing the boundaries of amateurism. The cycling world expected that Harris would take three titles in the 1948 Summer Olympics: the sprint, the tandem sprint and the kilometre time trial, but three months before the London Games, he broke two ribs in a road accident. After hospital, with a few weeks remaining to the games, training, competing and winning, he fell in a ten-mile (16 km) race at Fallowfield and fractured an elbow. Completing the rest of his preparation in a plaster cast, he had to be satisfied with two silvers, being beaten by Italy's Mario Ghella in the final of the sprint, and partnering Alan Bannister to second place in the tandem sprint (timetable constraints meant Harris's place in the kilometre was taken by another rider, Tommy Godwin, who won a bronze medal). Two weeks later, he claimed a bronze medal in the 1948 world championships sprint in Amsterdam. He was named sportsman of the year by a poll in 1949, winning by 7,000 votes over the football player, Billy Liddell.\n\nOn his return from Amsterdam, Harris turned professional under sponsorship of the Raleigh bicycle company. He was paid £1 000 a year with a bonus of £100 if he won a world championship, £50 for every grand prix and £25 for every British record. Harris was aware of his commercial attraction to race promoters and even as an amateur drove a Jaguar Mark IV. His earnings in the 1950s have been put at £12 000 a year. He dominated Raleigh's advertising for a decade and, despite coming from a sport with no great following in Britain, he was as familiar as Stanley Matthews and Stirling Moss.\n\nIn 1949 he won the world professional sprint championship in Copenhagen – a victory he repeated the following two years in Belgium and Milan. He then won a fourth and final world professional title in Cologne in 1954. He won the Sports Journalists' Association's accolade of \"Sportsman of the Year\" in 1950, and was runner-up in 1949 and 1951.\n\nHe retired in 1957 to devote himself to business interests, none of which suited his tastes or abilities. He managed Fallowfield Stadium, renamed the \"Harris Stadium\"; he was involved in various abortive ventures associated with Raleigh; and he started a 'Reg Harris' bicycle manufacturing business in Macclesfield which lasted three years before folding. He then worked in sales promotion for the 'Gannex' raincoat company, before working for two plastic foam producers.\nIn the 1960s he owned and managed the Reg Harris Petrol & Motor Service Station on Wilmslow Road in Didsbury, Manchester, which is now the site of the Shell Petrol Station on the corner of Grange Road.\n\nIn 1971, he returned to racing, winning a bronze medal in the British championship in Birmingham after little preparation. With more training behind him, he approached the British championship in Leicester in 1974 in more confident mood, and beat Trevor Bull to win the title at the age of 54. In 1975, he returned to Leicester, but was narrowly beaten by Bull in the final and had to settle for the silver medal. He continued to cycle almost to his death.\n\nA memorial to his achievements can be found in the National Cycling Centre in Manchester.\n\nHarris's achievements are marked annually with the Reg Harris Sportive, organised by his family and friends. The inaugural event on 25 August 2013 raised money for charities.\n\nIn popular culture, Harris is referenced in the \"Hancock's Half Hour\" episode 'The Junkman'.\n\nHe was married three times. The first two marriages (in 1944 to Florence Stage (daughter of the former Bury F.C. captain Billy Stage), then to Dorothy Hadfield) ended in divorce. He married Jennifer Anne Geary in 1970. He died in Macclesfield, Cheshire, of a stroke, survived by his third wife, and was buried at St John's Church in the north Cheshire village of Chelford.\n\nSource:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrand Prix Paris 1946, 1951, 1956\n\nGrand Prix Copenhagen 1949 und 1954 bis 1957,\n\nGrand Prix Aarhus 1956,\n\nGrand Prix Antwerp 1950,\n\nGrand Prix Brussels 1954 und 1955,\n\nGrand Prix London 1955 und 1957,\nGrand Prix Amsterdam 1950, 1952 und 1956,\n\nSource:\n\n\n\n"}

His properties included the towns of Frontignan and Mireval. He was the only son of William of Aumelas and of Tiburge, daughter of Raimbaut, count of Orange. After the early death of Raimbaut's father, his guardians were his uncle William VII of Montpellier and his elder sister Tibors.\n\nHe was a major troubadour, having contributed to the creation of \"trobar ric\", or articulate style, in troubadour poetry. About forty of his works survive, displaying a gusto for rare rhymes and intricate poetic form.\n\nHis death in 1173 is mourned in a \"planh\" (lament) by Giraut de Bornelh, and also in the only surviving poem of the trobairitz Azalais de Porcairagues, who was the lover of Raimbaut's cousin Gui Guerrejat. It seems possible that Azalais's poem was composed in an earlier form while Raimbaut was still alive, because in his poem \"A mon vers dirai chanso\" he appears to contribute to the poetical debate begun by Guilhem de Saint-Leidier and taken up by Azalais as to whether a lady is dishonoured by taking a lover who is richer than herself. Aimo Sakari argues that Azalais is the mysterious \"joglar\" (\"jongleur\") addressed in several poems by Raimbaut.\n\n\n"}

It is named for William Pope Duval, the first territorial governor of Florida.\n\nDuval Street was designated a “Great Street” in 2012 by the American Planning Association. The beautiful Bahamian and Spanish influenced Victorian Mansions of Duval Street have been well preserved through local preservation efforts starting in the 1960s. On the Atlantic Ocean end of Duval Street there is a mix of early Key West Victorian mansions and bungalows dotting the neighborhood. Art galleries, boutiques, inns and Bodega’s line the wide sidewalks. Although this end of Duval is more residential and less filled with tourists, the sidewalks still bustle with activity.\n\nOne block west of the southern terminus of Duval Street is the buoy marker for the southernmost point in the United States; it is close to the southernmost house, a Victorian mansion built in 1896. A favorite of both Harry S. Truman and author Ernest Hemingway, the building was restored to its formal beauty and opulence with a $3 million renovation in 1996.\n\nDuval Street well represents the cultural influence of Key West’s proximity and cultural ties to Cuba. Many Cubans immigrated to the area beginning in the late 1860s. At one time, the many cigar stores on Duval gave the city the moniker “Cigar City USA.” There are many pleasant outdoor cafes to enjoy another Cubano influenced product, “Cuban Coffee”, which is espresso made from roasted Cuban Coffee beans with a heavy dose of sugar.\n\nAt the north end, tourists from the cruise ships that dock at the Margaritaville Resort & Marina, Mole pier or Mallory Square are often seen traversing Duval Street's many shops [1] in the afternoon looking for souvenir trinkets and cheap T-shirts. BEWARE the streets are congested with Pedi cabs, trollies, bikes, mopeds, cars, and the Conch Train all adding to the touristy feel of this heavily visited end of Duval.\n\nNear the northern end of the street is Mallory Square. Historic Mallory Square is the center of Key West’s waterfront. The City of Key West and Duval Street share their beginning along this deep harbor waterfront.\n\nOn certain nights, the gulf shores of Duval Street often vibrate with a carnival like atmosphere that lasts until dawn and beyond. In fact, the ritual has a name known to tourists and residents as the “Duval Pub Crawl.” Duval is the location of many famous restaurants and bars, including Sloppy Joe's, Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville, which is the original, Fogarty's Restaurant, Bar and Bakery, \"The Flying Monkeys Bar\", The Bull and Whistle, Rick's Cafe and Irish Kevin's bar, Bourbon Street Pub and Aqua. Tour outlets book the “Duval Pub Crawl” activity and provide knowledgeable guidance for the tourist wishing to visit and imbibe at the famous drinking establishments, for a fee.\n\nA 1967 National Park Service survey of Historic American Buildings designated 18 buildings as historic. A full six blocks were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. Further protection for this historically significant street has been created through the City’s, “Historic Architecture Guidelines,” approved in 2000, which sets standards for construction on Duval Street.\n\nDuval Street is also a neighborhood within the City of Key West.\n\nIt is the area on either side of Duval Street, and includes the area to the north of Front Street, containing Wall Street, Mallory Square and the Port of Key West.\n"}
{"id": "2002674", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2002674", "title": "The Misunderstood", "text": "The Misunderstood\n\nThe Misunderstood were an American psychedelic rock band originating from Riverside, California, United States in the mid-1960s. The band moved to London early in their career, and although they recorded only a handful of songs before being forced to disband, they are considered highly influential in the then-emerging genre.\n\n\"Creem\", in their September 2004 review, wrote, \"The saga of the Misunderstood is one of the most unbelievable, heartbreaking, and unlikely stories in the entire history of rock.\"\n\n\"Classic Rock\"s June 2010 issue stated, \"The truth is that this band (the Misunderstood) were so far out on their own, so individual and innovative that you can only wonder at the set of circumstances that conspired to prevent them from becoming the iconic name that was surely their destiny.\"\n\nThe band began in 1963 as one of many garage bands formed in the US in the wake of the British Invasion. They moved to London in 1966, with the assistance of their manager, John Peel, who would later gain fame as an influential BBC Radio DJ. In the UK, they recruited Englishman Tony Hill on rhythm guitar. Hill and singer Rick Brown formed a songwriting team. Bass player Steve Whiting was also involved in developing material for the band.\n\nThe band was influenced by and often compared to the Yardbirds, and in 2004 were called \"the American Yardbirds\" by \"Rolling Stone\". Distinctive features of the band's sound included the steel guitar of Glenn Ross Campbell and the innovative style of Whiting, known for his use of slide, fuzz tone and distortion.\n\nFontana Records introduced the band with a four-song live performance in London's Philips Studios. British media response was positive, but at this juncture it was decided that Campbell, Whiting, and Moe should go to Europe to sort out their British visas and work permits, while Brown returned to California for his draft.\n\nIn London they released their second single, \"I Can Take You to the Sun\", before being forced to disband. They had only recorded six tracks in London.\n\nIn spite of their relatively small output, many musicians consider them to be influential pioneers of the acid style of rock music. \"Head Heritage\" in a 2006 review wrote, \"The Misunderstood's material extended far beyond the reach of the period in which it was conceived. The extraordinarily advanced tracks on side one from 1966 reveal them as one of the earliest and most original probes into psychedelic rock.\"\n\nBritish DJ John Peel championed the Misunderstood's music throughout his entire career. Shortly before his death, in an interview with \"Index Magazine\", Peel stated, \"If I had to list the ten greatest performances I've seen in my life, one would be the Misunderstood at Pandora's Box, Hollywood, 1966. My god, they were a great band!\"\n\nThe Misunderstood are known for having pioneered the live light show. Campbell initially soldered a guitar jack to a car light bulb and plugged this into the extension output behind each amp. This simple idea produced visual music, as the response between the guitars and the lights plugged into the amps was identical. They first showed this feature at the Hi Ho Club in Riverside in early 1966. They also played with lights at the Marquee Club in London in mid 1966. An advanced, multicolored, large scale version of this \"light show\" or \"visual sound\" system was being planned in London when the band were forced to retire. Another feature of their visuals was getting all three guitars feeding back using different tremolo settings, thereby leaving the stage flashing with musical lights.\n\nGlenn Ross Campbell went on to Juicy Lucy, while Tony Hill formed High Tide and recorded a solo album titled \"Inexactness\".\n\nIn 1982, Glenn Ross Campbell and Rick Brown reunited as \"Influence\", and in 1983 recorded two self-penned tracks, \"No Survivors\" and \"Queen of Madness\", for UK's Rough Trade Records. They disbanded in 1985 when Campbell moved to New Zealand and Brown moved to Thailand.\n\nCherry Red Records (UK) released three albums of the Misunderstood's music, viz., \"Before the Dream Faded\" (BRED 32) in 1982, \"The Legendary Goldstar Album\" (CDM RED 142) in 1997, and a full album of the Misunderstood's later material under the name of \"The Misunderstood: Broken Road\" (CDM RED 147) in 1998.\n\nIn 2004, Ugly Things Records (USA) issued another full album of previously unreleased tracks named \"The Lost Acetates 1965–1966\", that received international media coverage.\n\nA motion picture screen play (\"The Misunderstood\": WGA 977444) about the band and Brown's adventures was written by rock historian Mike Stax (editor of \"Ugly Things\") in 2002, and is under revision.\n\nA novel: \"Like, Misunderstood\" – based on the script was published in October 2007.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2002696", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2002696", "title": "Deutsches Patent- und Markenamt", "text": "Deutsches Patent- und Markenamt\n\nThe German Patent and Trade Mark Office (; abbreviation: DPMA) is the German national patent office, with headquarters in Munich, and offices in Berlin and Jena. In 2006 it employed 2556 people, of which about 700 were patent examiners.\n\nThe DPMA is the central authority in the field of intellectual property protection in Germany. Its responsibilities include the granting of patents for the registration of industrial designs, trademarks and designs, as well as for informing the public about existing industrial property rights. Recognised partner of the DPMA is the \"Patentinformationszentrum\" (Patent Information Centre), united in the \"Deutscher Patentinformationszentren e.V\" (German Patent Information Centres Association).\n\nThe legal basis of the German Patent and Trademark Office is § 26 of the \"Patentgesetz\" (German Patents Act).\n\nThe first unified \"Patentgesetz\" (German Patent Act) was adopted on 25 May 1877, which mandated the establishment of an authority tasked with reviewing and awarding patents. On this basis, on 1 July 1877, the \"Kaiserliche Patentamt\" (Imperial Patent Office) was founded in Berlin.\n\nThe Chairman of the newly established office was Karl Rudolf Jacobi. The first German patent was granted on 1 July 1877 for a \"method for producing a red ultramarine colour\", invented by Johannes Zeltner. The first trademark registration was on 16 October 1894 for a Berlin lamp producer.\n\nIn 1905, the Patent Office moved into premised designed by the architects Solf and Wichards on the corner of Gitschiner Straße and Lindenstraße in Kreuzberg, with a characteristic 243-metre front on the elevated highway.\n\nIn 1919, the Patent Office was renamed the \"Reichspatentamt\" (State Patent Office).\n\nThe Nazi anti-Semitic and anti-foreigner laws strangled scientific output and patent applications. Almost as soon as they came into power, the Nazis moved to throw the Jews out of the German Patent Offices, with only a few exceptions for those who had served at the front during World War I or who had lost a parent or son in fighting. “Law Relating to the Admission to the Profession of Patent-agent and Lawyer of 22 April 1933. The Government of the Reich has resolved the following law which is promulgated herewith: Section 1. Patent-agents which are of non-Aryan descent pursuant to the law relating to the reestablishment of the Professional Civil Service of 7 April 1933 may be taken off the roster of patent-agents kept by the Reich Patent Office up to 30 September 1933…”\n\nIn 1938, the “Aryanization” of patents was mandated, in that new patents could only be proposed and submitted if sponsored by an Aryan and German citizens, and not by dissidents, foreigners or Jews. Existing patents held by Jews must also be turned over to a German citizen. As one author stated, “Jewish commercial firms and the associated property, as well as wholesale operations and industry that are Jewish because of the degree to which they are under Jewish ownership, can be de-Jewdified [sic]. Important patents and commercial secrets must be transferred to non-Jewish control.”\n\nThe Reich Patent Office came under Nazi political party pressure as well. One of Adolf Hitler’s chauffeurs, Anton Loibl, invented the idea of attaching small pieces of glass to the pedals of bicycles, that would reflect the lights of approaching cars. In 1936, word of this invention came to the SS, and they decided to form a partnership with Loibl to market his idea. However, the idea was not all that novel, and a similar safety device had already been applied for as a patent. “But this competitor lacked something very important- the SS as a business partner. His patent application was buried. Loibl’s sailed through, and in 1938 Heinrich Himmler used his supreme authority as head of the German police to pass a new traffic law. This required all German bicycles to be equipped with Loibl’s reflective pedal… in 1938 alone, the SS received a tidy 77,740 reichmarks from the bicycle pedal proceeds.”\n\nIn the last months of the war, many of the technical records of the German Patent Office were widely dispersed throughout Germany to preserve them from the Allied firebombing of Berlin. “One set of copies of the pending 180,000 patent applications were taken into eastern Germany where they were later lost by fire. The technical library of 300,000 volumes and the records of the secret patents were moved to Heringen, near Kassel, and 3,000 valuable reference books were sent through Czechoslovakia to Bavaria. Part of the Trademark records were moved to another building in Berlin where they were lost also by fire. Some of the technical personnel remained at the Patent Office in Berlin, some went to Heringen and others were scattered throughout Germany. The Patent Office building in Berlin was about one-third destroyed by a heavy bombing attack on February 5, 1945. US and British representatives reached Heringen in May 1945 and found some 50 former patent employees at work restoring and re-classifying the patent indexes and examination material. The library and the register of secret patents were located in a potash mine in Heringen. However, the files of the secret applications and patents had been burned upon orders of the German government shortly before the arrival of the US troops… The technical library has been moved from the potash mine in Heringen and is again available to the public. The library is equipped with 12 miles of new metal shelves which provide space for about 500,000 volumes.”\n\nOther attempts to preserve German patents was the re-registration of the patents in other countries. In 1945, it was noted that: “Patents Transferred. That Germany is preparing in other ways to salve what she can is indicated by reports that the flight of capital on a large scale is taking place from Germany to Sweden through the transfer of German patents. The Swedish Patent Office is said to be inundated with registrations of patents on behalf of German individuals, commercial corporations and research organizations. Last year, it is said, 60 per cent of the record total of 10,000 patent registrations were German and the proportion has increased this year. Among those who registered were I.G. Farben, the Steyr-Daimler-Benz automobile manufacturers, the Siemens and A.E.G. Combines. The patents, of course, represent substantial assets.\"\n\nAfter the Second World War, the patent office property was seized by the Allied Control Council, including patents, trademarks, and emblems, under Articles II and X of the Allied Control Council Law No. 5, 30 October 1945. Article II of this Act on 31 August 1951 set aside all Allied Control Council Law but in fact this occurred only on 12 September 1990 with the \"Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany\". Until 1951 the seized patents were used by the Allies technologically and economically.\n\nOn 1 October 1949, the \"Deutsches Patentamt\" (German Patent Office) moved to premises in the Deutsches Museum in Munich. In 1951 a branch office was opening in the old \"Reichspatentamt\" in Berlin. 1959, the Patent Office moved into its own building in Munich.\n\nIn 1990, the Office for \"Amt für Erfindungs- und Patentwesen der DDR\" (Inventions and Patent Office of the GDR) merged with the Patent Office.\n\nIn 1998, an office in Jena was built and the bulk of the Berlin office moved there. The Office has thus now has three locations, Munich, Jena and Berlin. In the same year was a renaming of \"Deutsche Patentamt\" to \"Deutsches Patent- und Markenamt\" (DPMA), in order to take the importance of brands as a working area of the office into account.\n\nOriginally appeals against decisions of the Office were conducted by the internally, however, since 1961 this is done in the \"Bundespatentgericht\" (Federal Patent Court).\n\nSince 1978 and the entry into force of the European Patent Convention, the European Patent Office also issues patents effective in Germany, as part of a European patent's \"bundle\" of national patents.\n\nIn 2006, the leaders in terms of numbers of patents at the DPMA were Siemens, with 2501 patents, Bosch, with 2202 patents, DaimlerChrysler with 1626 patents.\n\nIn 1984, the DPMA opened an \"inventor's gallery\", as \"an incentive for all innovative forces to express themselves more, and a signal to the insurance companies to promote them long term.\" It was enlarged in 1987 and again in 1999 and now covers 17 German inventors:\nBéla Barényi,\nGerd Binnig,\nLudwig Bölkow,\nWalter Bruch,\nJürgen Dethloff,\nArtur Fischer,\nRudolf Hell,\nHeinz Lindenmeier,\nHermann Oberth,\nHans Joachim Pabst von Ohain,\nOskar-Erich Peter,\nHans-Jürgen Quadbeck-Seeger,\nErnst Ruska,\nHans Sauer,\nFelix Wankel,\nErnst-Ludwig Winnacker,\nKonrad Zuse\n\n\n"}

Arrested by Allied authorities after the war, he committed suicide in prison in 1948.\n\nOtto von Stülpnagel was born on 16 June 1878 in Berlin. He was a member of the Stülpnagel family. He pursued a military career in keeping with his family’s long tradition of military service. Commissioned in 1898 and accepted as a member of the Imperial General Staff, he received several decorations for distinguished service on the western front during World War I. Nominated for the \"Pour le Mérite\", Stülpnagel survived personnel cuts mandated by the Treaty of Versailles. Dismayed by accusations of German atrocities, he published an angry defence of German military conduct in a popular book entitled \"Die Wahrheit über die deutschen Kriegsverbrechen\" (The Truth about German War Crimes) (1921). Promoted to the rank Generalleutnant (lieutenant general) in 1931, Stülpnagel played a leading role in the Reichswehr in conjunction with Kurt von Schleicher and Erich Freiherr von dem Bussche-Ippenburg during the Weimar era. Transferred to the fledgling Luftwaffe in 1934, Stülpnagel eventually took charge of the air force academy before falling from favour and retiring in March 1939.\n\nDays before the German invasion of Poland, Hitler recalled Stülpnagel to active service and placed him in charge of a military district in Austria (Wehrkreise XVII), and he held the latter post for fourteen months.\n\nOn 25 October 1940, German army high command transferred Stülpnagel to France and placed him in charge of a military government with the title of \"Militärbefehlshaber in Frankreich\" (MBF; \"Military Commander in France\"). Not without controversy, this last assignment defined Stülpnagel’s career.\n\nOrders from Hitler placed the army and the MBF in charge of \"security\" but allowed other state and Nazi party agencies to exercise a degree of influence in Occupied France. The German ambassador in Paris, Otto Abetz, first supervised and later controlled diplomatic relations between France and Germany, but that power amounted to little in practice. Hitler would not allow his ambassador to trade concessions for French cooperation, and formal negotiations between the Third Reich and Vichy France came to nought. With control of the flow of vital raw materials, food, and people across the demarcation line that separated occupied from unoccupied France, Stülpnagel could reward French cooperation by allowing people and goods to cross military checkpoints, or he could seal the borders and bring the French economy to a grinding halt. Control over both the demarcation line inside France and borders with Germany and Belgium gave the MBF considerable influence over German policy and French affairs. Thus Stülpnagel played a major role in Franco-German relations between October 1940 and January 1942.\n\nDetermined to support the Nazi war effort by placing French industrial resources at the disposal of the German war economy, Stülpnagel discouraged all activities that did not advance the German war effort. The latter goal placed him at loggerheads with Nazi party stalwarts who viewed World War II as a struggle against Jews and their alleged Communist allies. Days after German troops occupied Paris, agents of the Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce and German embassy staff began to confiscate the art collections of prominent French Jews. Upset by the apparent seizure of France's artistic patrimony, the French government complained to German diplomats and the MBF. Eager to maintain cordial relations with the Vichy regime, Stülpnagel and his staff condemned the confiscations through a series of protests that eventually reached Hitler's desk, but to no avail. Hitler eventually exempted the \"Einsatzstab\" from military control and sanctioned the wholesale theft of Jewish art collections.\n\nConflict with the SS followed a similar pattern. Forced to accept an advisory role at the start of the Occupation, the SS complained of the alleged danger of the so-called 'Jewish menace' and pressed MBF to launch an active campaign against \"racial opponents\" in France, but lacked the authority to act independently. After French Resistance groups shot Colonel Karl Friedrich Hotz in Nantes on 20 October and Hans-Gottfried Reimers in Bordeaux on 21 October 1941, Hitler ordered Stülpnagel to execute 100-150 French hostages for each attack. The MBF immediately condemned Hitler's policy through official channels, treated both attacks as a single incident, and shot a total of 98 hostages. Determined to preserve French cooperation, Stülpnagel condemned large-scale executions. In contrast, the SS demonstrated its enthusiasm for Hitler's war against the so-called Jewish conspiracy by bombing seven synagogues in Paris on the night of 2/3 October 1941. Embarrassed by the attacks, Stülpnagel complained to superiors in Berlin, but his repeated protests only reiterated tepid support for Nazi racial policy.\n\nSuspecting the MBF of Francophilia, Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, the head of Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW; Armed Forces High Command) grew tired of Stülpnagel's complaints. On 2 February 1942, he directed the MBF to answer all acts of resistance with \"sharp deterrents, including the execution of a large number of imprisoned Communists, Jews, or people who carried out previous attacks, and the arrest of at least 1,000 Jews or Communists for later evacuation.\"\n\nStülpnagel, who had executed 95 hostages on 15 December 1941, refused to go any further in the implementation of the retaliation policy. He promptly submitted a bitter letter of resignation. Succeeded by his cousin Carl-Heinrich von Stülpnagel, Stülpnagel may have suffered a nervous breakdown. He spent the remainder of the war with his wife in Berlin.\n\nArrested by Allied authorities after Germany’s surrender, Stülpnagel was moved to a French military prison. Charged with war crimes by French authorities, Stülpnagel committed suicide in Cherche-Midi Prison on 6 February 1948. He is buried in the Champigny-Saint-André German war cemetery.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2002708", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2002708", "title": "Oil Storm", "text": "Oil Storm\n\nOil Storm is a 2005 television mockumentary portraying a future oil-shortage crisis in the United States, precipitated by a hurricane destroying key parts of the United States' oil infrastructure. The program was an attempt to depict what would happen if the highly oil-dependent country was suddenly faced with gasoline costing upwards of $7 to $8 per gallon (as opposed to the national average of around $2 per gallon when the show first aired). Directed by James Erskine and written by Erskine and Caroline Levy, it originally aired on FX Networks on 5 June 2005, at 8 p.m. ET.\n\nThe crisis arises from a hurricane destroying an important pipeline at Port Fourchon in Louisiana, a tanker collision closing a busy port, terrorist attacks and tension with Saudi Arabia over the oil trade, and other fictional events. The program followed the lives of several people - the owners of a mom-and-pop convenience store, a paramedic, stock market and oil analysts, government officials, and others - and includes a substantial amount of human drama.\n\nHurricane Julia, a Category 4 hurricane, strikes the Gulf of Mexico, making a direct hit on New Orleans, Louisiana, killing thousands of people and causing severe damage. Large numbers of offshore oil rigs in the Gulf, and a major pipeline and the primary nerve center of the Gulf Coast petroleum industry at Port Fourchon, Louisiana are destroyed. It shows how the effects of that disaster could have significant consequences throughout the United States, even in areas far removed from landfall.\n\nWhile the loss of life and property in the storm is staggering (with the death toll in the thousands and the damage in the billions), the greater impact is on the crippled energy industry. Due to the destruction at Port Fourchon and in the Gulf, oil prices skyrocket from $55 to $77 per barrel, and the United States government is forced to take immediate action to rebuild the Gulf's energy infrastructure. Once the storm passes, the government starts to rebuild the infrastructure at Port Fourchon (requiring a minimum of eight months) and repair or replace damaged offshore rigs (requiring a similar amount of time). Also, shipping that normally goes through Port Fourchon is rerouted to the Port of Houston; Houston's port facilities are open around-the-clock with higher-than-usual throughput, with attendant higher risk of accident.\n\nWith widespread gas lines and prices over $3.00 per gallon, the U.S. persuades Saudi Arabia to increase its oil production by 1m barrels a day. The Saudi decision to aid America causes a backlash among a restive Muslim population already energized because of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Local terrorists stage an attack on an upscale shopping mall in Riyadh which (after intervention by Saudi special forces) kills about 300 Americans associated with multinational oil companies. This attack leads the U.S. to send troops to Saudi Arabia. In the meantime, the oil crisis escalates when two large tankers collide in the narrow Houston Ship Channel, shutting down the Channel.\n\nOnce winter sets in, gas lines take a back seat to critical shortages of heating oil during a bitterly cold winter, with thousands dying in the cold. Some good news comes after the Houston Ship Channel is reopened, but on Christmas Day, the same Saudi terrorists blow up sections of the mammoth Ras Tanura refinery complex, killing 142 U.S. soldiers who were protecting the Saudi oil infrastructure; among the casualties is the eldest son of the convenience store owners. Oil prices reach $153 per barrel, and gas prices top $8 per gallon.\n\nMeanwhile, with a government budget crisis due to military and economic pressures, farm spending is cut dramatically, leading to a subplot in which the social and political effects of this are explored. A well-renowned agricultural leader organizes a 750,000-farmer march on Washington, leading to clashes with police and the leader being taken into custody.\n\nIn the spring, the U.S. makes a deal with Russia to send of oil by tanker, but the oil companies involved subsequently make a deal with China, which, equally hungry for oil and with greater financial reserves, outbids the U.S. This leaves America in a state of chaos, as well leading to soul-searching on whether China has now become the world's economic superpower. The country considers fast-tracking development of alternative energy sources, but there is little that can be done in the short-term to alter an economy structurally dependent on cheap foreign oil. Later, the U.S. government, showing unexpected diplomatic skill, resurrects the Russian oil deal by agreeing to a $16 billion long-term investment in its oil industry, and the China-bound tankers change course to the United States.\n\nThe crisis finally eases a year after Hurricane Julia, with Port Fourchon back at 80-percent capacity, the strategic petroleum reserve being replenished and tensions in Saudi Arabia stabilized. Oil prices drop from their highs at the height of the crisis to $73 per barrel, and gas prices nearing the $4 per gallon mark and dropping. However, the country has been through a stress as great as the Stock Market Crash of 1929, and now knowing that relying on OPEC for most of its foreign oil imports makes the United States vulnerable, Americans will never take cheap oil for granted again.\n\nThe events of Hurricane Katrina, its economic impact and the ensuing price increases nearly parallel some of the events in the movie. However, the damage to US oil infrastructure was less severe than in the film, and the lack of the compounding events (shutdown of Port of Houston, loss of some of Saudi Arabia's supply) means the consequences of Katrina are much less than of the fictional Julia. However, especially given the coincidence of dates (in the film, Julia strikes in early September 2005), the similarity of the early impact of the two storms has been noted.\n\nOn 28 August 2005, Hurricane Katrina was on a direct path to hit Port Fourchon and New Orleans. Many of the initial scenes of Hurricane Julia were playing out in real life with Hurricane Katrina, such as the mandatory evacuation of New Orleans, the opening of the Superdome as shelter, and the changing of traffic to contraflow. On 29 August 2005, Hurricane Katrina did not directly hit Port Fourchon but across Barataria Bay at Buras, but nonetheless some oil rigs were damaged. Saudi Arabia agreed to increase oil production to help. \n\nOn 30 August 2005, many gas stations raised prices by a considerable amount putting most of America over $3.00/gallon, as shown in the movie. On 1 September 2005, gas stations throughout the country began to run out of fuel due to worries of mass shortages. Some stations in Atlanta, Georgia sold gas at nearly $6/gallon. Most of this was due to panic buying, as noted in the film, rather than physical shortage. Subsequently, as the extent of the damage became clearer, prices eased.\n\nThe casualty numbers shown for New Orleans is also startlingly close to the casualties of Katrina. The Movies shows a little more than 1700 while the official number for Katrina is 1833.\n\nBoth Ford and GM announced layoffs and plant closings in late 2005 and early 2006. However, while one reason for the layoffs was increased gasoline prices, it was not the sole reason for the layoffs. In addition, the layoffs were on a much smaller scale than the ones shown in the film.\n\nThere was also the 2009 GM crisis in which General Motors requested and received Federal assistance. Unlike the mocumentary, GM did not die, it seemed \"too big to fail\" because maintaining automotive competition and the status quo seemed more important.\n\nIn the film, al-Qaeda makes a terrorist attack on the oil facilities at Ras Tanura. On 24 February 2006 al-Qaeda attacked the nearby facility at Abqaiq, though no damage was inflicted on the facilities themselves.\n"}

{"id": "2002715", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2002715", "title": "Anti-Protestantism", "text": "Anti-Protestantism\n\nAnti-Protestantism is bias, hatred or distrust against some or all branches of Protestantism and its followers.\n\nAnti-protestantism dates back to before the Protestant Reformation itself, as various pre-Protestant groups such as Arnoldists, Waldensians, Hussites and Lollards were persecuted in Roman Catholic Europe. Protestants were not tolerated throughout most of Europe until the Peace of Augsburg of 1555 approved Lutheranism as an alternative for Roman Catholicism as a state religion of various states within the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. Calvinism was not recognized until the Peace of Westphalia of 1648. Other states, such as France, made similar agreements in the early stages of the Reformation. Poland–Lithuania had a long history of religious tolerance. However, the tolerance stopped after the Thirty Years' War in Germany, the persecution of Huguenots and the French Wars of Religion in France, the change in power between Protestant and Roman Catholic rulers after the death of Henry VIII of England in England, and the launch of the Counter-Reformation in Italy, Spain, Habsburg Austria and Poland-Lithuania. Anabaptism arose as a part of the Radical Reformation, lacking support of the state Lutheranism and Calvinism enjoyed, and thus was persecuted. Theological disagreement initially led to a Lutheran-Reformed rivalry in the Reformation.\n\nProtestants in Latin America were largely ostracized until the abolition of certain restrictions in the 20th century. Protestantism spread with Evangelicalism and Pentecostalism gaining the majority of followers. North America became a shelter for Protestants who were fleeing Europe after the persecution increased.\n\nPersecution of Protestants in Asia can be put under a common shield of the persecution Christians face in the Middle East and northern Africa, where Islam is the dominant religion.\n\nAnti-Protestantism originated in a reaction by militant societies connected to the Roman Catholic Church alarmed at the spread of Protestantism following the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century. Martin Luther's Proclamation occurred in 1517. By 1540, Pope Paul III had sanctioned the first society pledged to extinguish Protestantism. Christian Protestantism was denounced as heresy, and those supporting these doctrines were excommunicated as heretics. Thus by canon law and the practice and policies of the Holy Roman Empire of the time, Protestants were subject to persecution in those territories, such as Spain, Italy and the Netherlands, in which the Catholic rulers were then the dominant power. This movement was started by the reigning Pope and various political rulers with a more political stake in the controversy then a religious one. These princes instituted policies as part of the Spanish Inquisition, abuses of that crusade originally authorized for other reasons such as the Reconquista, and Morisco conversions, which ultimately led to the Counter Reformation and the edicts of the Council of Trent. Therefore, the political repercussions of various European rulers supporting Roman Catholicism for their own political reasons over the new Protestant groups, only subsequently branded as heretical after rejection by the adherents of these doctrines of the Edicts of the Council of Trent, resulted in religious wars and outbreaks of sectarian violence.\nEastern Orthodoxy had comparatively little contact with Protestantism for geographic, linguistic and historical reasons. Protestant attempts to ally with Eastern Orthodoxy proved problematic. In general, most Orthodox had the impression that Protestantism was a new heresy that arose from various previous heresies.\n\nIn 1771, Bishop Charles Walmesley published his \"General History of the Christian Church from her birth to her Final Triumphant States in Heaven chiefly deduced from the Apocalypse of St. John the Apostle\", written under the pseudonym of Signor Pastorini. The book forecast the end of Protestantism by 1825 and was published in at least 15 editions and several languages.\n\nBy the 19th century and later, some Eastern Orthodox thinkers, such as Berdyaev, Seraphim Rose, and John Romanides believed that Northern Europe had become secular or virtually atheist due to its having been Protestant earlier. In recent eras Orthodox anti-Protestantism has grown due to aggressive Protestant proselytization in predominantly Orthodox countries.\n\n \nThe Protestant Reformation led to a long period of warfare and communal violence between Catholic and Protestant factions, sometimes leading to massacres and forced suppression of the alternative views by the dominant faction in much of Europe.\n\nAnti-Protestantism originated in a reaction by the Catholic Church against the Reformation of the 16th century. Protestants were denounced as heretics and subject to persecution in those territories, such as Spain, Italy and the Netherlands in which the Catholics were the dominant power. This movement was orchestrated by popes and princes as the Counter Reformation. There were religious wars and eruptions of sectarian hatred such as the St Bartholomew's Day Massacre of 1572, part of the French Wars of Religion in some countries, though not in others.\n\nIn 1870 the newly formed Kingdom of Italy annexed the remaining Papal States, depriving the Pope of his temporal power. However, Papal rule over Italy was later restored by the Italian Fascist régime (albeit on a greatly diminished scale) in 1929 as head of the Vatican City state; under Mussolini's dictatorship, Catholicism became the State religion of Fascist Italy.\n\nIn 1938, the Italian Racial Laws and \"Manifesto of Race\" were promulgated by the Fascist régime to both outlaw and persecute Italian Jews and Protestants, especially Evangelicals and Pentecostals. Thousands of Italian Jews and a small number of Protestants died in the Nazi concentration camps.\n\nIn Franco's authoritarian Spanish State (1936–1975), Protestantism was deliberately marginalized and persecuted. During the Civil War, Franco's regime persecuted the country's 30,000 Protestants, and forced many Protestant pastors to leave the country and various protestant leaders were executed. Once authoritarian rule was established, non-Catholic Bibles were confiscated by police and Protestant schools were closed. Although the 1945 Spanish Bill of Rights granted freedom of \"private\" worship, Protestants suffered legal discrimination and non-Catholic religious services were not permitted publicly, to the extent that they could not be in buildings which had exterior signs indicating it was a house of worship and that public activities were prohibited.\n\nAmong theologically conservative Christians (including Catholics and Orthodox Christians, as well as Evangelicals and Protestant fundamentalists), mainline Protestant denominations are often characterized as being theologically liberal to the point where they are no longer true to the Bible or the historic Christian tradition. These perceptions are often linked to highly publicized events, such as the decision to endorse same-sex marriage by the United Church of Christ. While theological liberalism is clearly present within most mainline denominations, surveys show that many within the mainline denominations consider themselves moderate or conservative and holding traditional Christian theological views.\n\nIn the United States, critics of the policies adopted by the Religious Right, such as opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion, often equate evangelicalism as a movement with the Religious Right. Many evangelicals belong to this political movement, although it is a diverse movement that draws support from other Protestants, Jews, Mormons, Catholics, and Eastern Orthodox, among other non-evangelical groups. Some critics have even suggested that evangelicals are a kind of \"fifth column\" aimed at turning the United States or other nations into Christian theocracies. Cultural progressive activists have indicated fear of a potential Christian theocracy as one of the reasons for their opposition to the Christian Right.\n\nSome evangelical groups that hold to a Dispensationalist interpretation of Biblical prophecy have been accused of supporting Zionism and providing material support for Jewish settlers who build communities within Palestinian territories. Critics contend that these evangelicals support Israel in order to expedite the building of the Third Temple in Jerusalem, which Dispensationalists see as a requirement for the return of Jesus Christ. Many evangelicals reject Dispensationalism and support peace efforts in the Middle East, however.\n\nSome Christian groups focused on the Bible have been derided as \"Bible thumpers\". Depictions of evangelicals as uneducated rubes or hypocrites are common in Hollywood movies and television shows, such as \"Saved!\", \"Shawshank Redemption\", \"There Will Be Blood\" and \"Inherit the Wind\".\n\nIn Northern Ireland or pre-Catholic Emancipation Ireland, there is a hostility to Protestantism as a whole that has more to do with communal or nationalist sentiments than theological issues. During the Tudor conquest of Ireland by the Protestant state of England in the course of the 16th century, the Elizabethan state failed to convert Irish Catholics to Protestantism and thus followed a vigorous policy of confiscation, deportation, and resettlement. By dispossessing Catholics of their lands, and resettling Protestants on them, the official Government policy was to encourage a widespread campaign of proselytizing by Protestant settlers and establishment of English law in these areas. This led to a counter effort of the Counter Reformation by mostly Jesuit Catholic clergy to maintain the \"old religion\" of the people as the dominant religion in these regions. The result was that Catholicism came to be identified with a sense of nativism and Protestantism came to be identified with the State, as most Protestant communities were established by state policy, and Catholicism was viewed as treason to the state after this time. While Elizabeth I had initially tolerated private Catholic worship, this ended after Pope Pius V, in his 1570 papal bull \"Regnans in Excelsis\", pronounced her to be illegitimate and unworthy of her subjects' allegiance.\n\nThe Penal Laws, first introduced in the early 17th century, were initially designed to force the native elite to conform to the state church by excluding non-Conformists and Roman Catholics from public office, and restricting land ownership, but were later, starting under Queen Elizabeth, also used to confiscate virtually all Catholic owned land and grant it to Protestant settlers from England and Scotland. The Penal Laws had a lasting effect on the population, due to their severity (celebrating Catholicism in any form was punishable by death or enslavement under the laws), and the favouritism granted Irish Anglicans served to polarise the community in terms of religion. Anti-Protestantism in Early Modern Ireland 1536–1691 thus was also largely a form of hostility to the colonisation of Ireland. Irish poetry of this era shows a marked antipathy to Protestantism, one such poem reading, \"The faith of Christ [Catholicism] with the faith of Luther is like ashes in the snow\". The mixture of resistance to colonization and religious disagreements led to widespread massacres of Protestant settlers in the Irish Rebellion of 1641. Subsequent religious or sectarian antipathy was fueled by the atrocities committed by both sides in the Irish Confederate Wars, especially the repression of Catholicism during and after the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, when Irish Catholic land was confiscated en masse, clergy were executed and discriminatory legislation was passed against Catholics.\n\nThe Penal Laws against Catholics (and also Presbyterians) were renewed in the late 17th and early 18th centuries due to fear of Catholic support for Jacobitism after the Williamite War in Ireland and were slowly repealed in 1771–1829. Penal Laws against Presbyterians were relaxed by the Toleration Act of 1719, due to their siding with the Jacobites in a 1715 rebellion. At the time the Penal Laws were in effect, Presbyterians and other non-Conformist Protestants left Ireland and settled in other countries. Some 250,000 left for the New World alone between the years 1717 and 1774, most of them arriving there from Ulster.\n\nSectarian conflict was continued in the late 18th century in the form of communal violence between rival Catholic and Protestant factions over land and trading rights (see Defenders (Ireland), Peep O'Day Boys and Orange Institution). The 1820s and 1830s in Ireland saw a major attempt by Protestant evangelists to convert Catholics, a campaign which caused great resentment among Catholics.\n\nIn modern Irish nationalism, anti-Protestantism is usually more nationalist than religious in tone. The main reason for this is the identification of Protestants with unionism – i.e. the support for the maintenance of the union with the United Kingdom, and opposition to Home Rule or Irish independence. In Northern Ireland, since the foundation of the Free State in 1921, Catholics, who were mainly nationalists, suffered systematic discrimination from the Protestant unionist majority. The same happened to Protestants in the Catholic-dominated South.\n\nThe mixture of religious and national identities on both sides reinforces both anti-Catholic and anti-Protestant sectarian prejudice in the province.\n\nMore specifically religious anti-Protestantism in Ireland was evidenced by the acceptance of the Ne Temere decrees in the early 20th century, whereby the Catholic Church decreed that all children born into mixed Catholic-Protestant marriages had to be brought up as Catholics. Protestants in Northern Ireland had long held that their religious liberty would be threatened under a 32-county Republic of Ireland, due to that country's Constitutional support of a \"special place\" for the Roman Catholic Church.

He is sometimes referred to as Caspar Wistar the Younger, to distinguish him from his grandfather of the same name.\n\nHe was born at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of Richard Wistar (1727–1781) and Sarah Wyatt (1733–1771). He was the grandson of Caspar Wistar (1696–1752), a German immigrant, Quaker and glassmaker.\n\nHe was educated at the Friends' school in his native city, where he received a thorough classical training. His interest in medicine began while he was aiding in the care of the wounded after the battle of Germantown, and he made his first studies under the direction of Dr. John Redman. He studied medicine, first at the University of Pennsylvania (receiving his Bachelor of Medicine degree in 1782), and then at the University of Edinburgh (receiving his Doctor of Medicine degree in 1786). While in Scotland he was, for two successive years, president of the Royal Medical Society of Edinburgh, and also president of a society for the further investigation of natural history.\n\nUpon his return to the U.S. in January 1787, he entered on the practice of his profession in Philadelphia, where he was at once appointed one of the physicians to the Philadelphia Dispensary. He was professor of chemistry and the institutes of medicine in the College of Philadelphia from 1789 till 1792, when the faculty of that institution united with the medical department of the University of Pennsylvania, of which he was adjunct professor of anatomy, midwifery, and surgery until 1808. In that year, on the death of his associate, Dr. William Shippen Jr., he was given the chair of anatomy, which he retained until his death. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1803.\nFor his teaching at the University of Pennsylvania, he developed a set of anatomical models—human remains preserved by injecting them with wax—to assist with the teaching of anatomy. He published \"A System of Anatomy\" in two volumes from 1811 to 1814. His fame attracted students to his lectures, and he was largely the means of establishing the reputation of the school. Meanwhile, he was chosen physician to the Pennsylvania Hospital, where he remained until 1810. His reputation as an anatomist was increased by his description of the posterior portion of the ethmoid bone with the triangular bones attached, which received universal recognition as an original treatment of the subject.\n\nHe was an early promoter of vaccination. During the yellow fever epidemic of 1793, he suffered an attack of the disease contracted while caring for his patients.\n\nIt was his habit to throw open his house once every week in the winter, and at these gatherings students, citizens, scientists, and travelers met and discussed subjects of interest. These assemblies, celebrated in the annals of Philadelphia under the title of Wistar parties, were continued long after his death by other residents of that city.\n\nThe American College of Physicians elected him a fellow in 1787, and he was appointed one of its censors in 1794, which place he retained until his death. In 1787 he was elected to membership of the American Philosophical Society, was chosen its vice-president in 1795, and on the resignation of Thomas Jefferson, in 1815, served as president until his death. He also served as president of the Society for the Abolition of Slavery, succeeding Benjamin Rush.\n\nThe botanist Thomas Nuttall named the genus \"Wisteria\" in his honour (some call it \"Wistaria\" but the misspelling is conserved under the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature). The \"Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology\" at the University of Pennsylvania, founded in 1892 by his great-nephew, Isaac Jones Wistar, is also named for Caspar Wistar.\n\nWistar was a friend of Thomas Jefferson, with whom he worked to identify bones of the megalonyx and through whom he sent Meriwether Lewis some recommendations for scientific inquiry on the Lewis and Clark expedition.\n\nIn 1788 he married Isabella Marshall, who died in 1790. He married Elizabeth Mifflin in 1798.\n\nHis brother Richard (20 July 1756 – 6 June 1821) was a Philadelphia merchant who built a large four-story store in 1790 where he conducted an iron and hardware business. With the profits, he purchased lands and houses in the vicinity of Philadelphia. During the Revolutionary War, Richard advocated the defense of his property by arms, which resulted in his being disowned by the Society of Friends. Richard was an inspector of prisons, and was one of the early friends and supporters of the Library Company of Philadelphia and the Pennsylvania Hospital.\n\nCaspar was a cousin of Revolutionary diarist Sally Wister and nephew of Samuel Morris.\n\n\n\n"}

The name comes from the observation by early American settlers that it was very sensitive to frost, the fronds dying quickly when first touched by it. It is sometimes treated as the only species in \"Onoclea\", but some authors do not consider the genus monotypic.\n\nThe sterile and fertile fronds of \"Onoclea sensibilis\" are quite different from other ferns. The bright, yellow-green sterile fronds are deeply pinnatifid and are typically borne at intervals along a creeping rhizome. They grow to about long, with a long, smooth stipe.\n\nThe fertile fronds are much smaller, non-green, and have very narrow pinnae. The sori are clustered like beads or grapes on the upright fertile fronds, hence the common name Bead fern. The fiddleheads are a pale red color.\n\n\"Onoclea sensibilis\" is native to the Russian Far East, China and Eastern Asia, and has a wide native distribution in Northern America.\n\n\"Onoclea sensibilis\" dwells in a variety of wet swamp and wood habitats: wet meadows, thickets and bogs, as well as stream and riverbanks and roadside ditches. It ranges from Newfoundland south to Florida and west to Texas, the Rocky Mountains, North Dakota, Quebec, and Manitoba. It is also native to East Asia, and has become naturalized in western Europe.\n\nIt grows best in a shaded or partially shaded area in a moist soil. The plant can tolerate dryer conditions in shade, and will tolerate wet soils and so occurs in soggy ground or at the very edge of water in shade or sun. Sensitive ferns spread to form colonies and are often the first species to inhabit disturbed areas. They can become weedy if not sited properly.\n\n\"Onoclea sensibilis\" is a facultative wetland indicator, toxic, and a host to the pathogen which causes bacterial wilt in rice.\n\n\"Onoclea sensibilis\" is cultivated as an ornamental plant, in traditional and native plant gardens, and in natural landscaping and habitat restoration projects. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. \n\nIn shade it can tolerate drier conditions, but in full sun it requires wet soil. Winter survival will be enhanced if the dried fronds are left on the plant through the winter.\n\n"}
{"id": "2002728", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2002728", "title": "Abraham in History and Tradition", "text": "Abraham in History and Tradition\n\nAbraham in History and Tradition is a book by biblical scholar John Van Seters.\n\nThe book is divided into two parts, \"Abraham in History\" and \"Abraham in Tradition\". In Part I, Van Seters argues that there is no unambiguous evidence pointing to an origin for the stories in the 2nd millennium BC. \"Arguments based on reconstructing the patriarch's nomadic way of life, the personal names in Genesis, the social customs reflected in the stories, and correlation of the traditions of Genesis with the archaeological data of the Middle Bronze Age have all been found, in Part One above, to be quite defective in demonstrating an origin for the Abraham tradition in the second millennium B.C.\". This finding has implications for certain then-current strands in Biblical criticism: \"Consequently, without any such effective historical controls on the tradition one cannot use any part of it in an attempt to reconstruct the primitive period of Israelite history. Furthermore, a vague presupposition about the antiquity of the tradition based upon a consensus approval of such arguments should no longer be used as a warrant for proposing a history of the tradition related to early premonarchic times.\"\n\nPart II forms a critique of \"tradition-history\" or \"tradition-analysis\", the theory current at the time that Genesis retained traces of oral traditions dating from the 2nd millennium. \"There is virtually no way of deciding when oral narrative forms or motifs became associated with a particular person such as Abraham, and it could well have happened in every case when the story was first put in written form. The results of the literary examination of the Abraham tradition, in Part Two, would suggest that oral forms and motifs are confined to a rather small part of the tradition.\"\n\nThe book was a landmark in Near Eastern Studies and Biblical archaeology, since it challenged the dominant view, popularised by William Foxwell Albright, that the patriarchal narratives of Genesis can be identified on archaeological grounds with the Mesopotamian world of 2nd millennium BC. Van Seters noted that many of Albright's parallels were vague, and fit other regions than Mesopotamia and other times than 2nd millennium. Specially severe was his analysis of Genesis 14, where he pointed out that the political situation described in Genesis 14 - a Near East dominated by a coalition led by Elam and including Hatti, Assyria and Babylonia - is not confirmed by any monuments, king lists, or other historical and archaeological sources. Van Seters also pointed out that the ten kings mentioned in Genesis 14 cannot be found in any ancient documents outside the Bible.\n\nThe book was also a criticism of the school of Tradition history advanced most notably by Hermann Gunkel and Martin Noth: Van Seters \"argues that Noth's (1948) idea of a \"pentateuchal oral tradition\" is flawed both historically (with respect to the history of Israel) and analogically (given Noth's comparisons with the development of Icelandic saga) [and] contends that traces of folkloric structure do not make it inevitable 'that the tradition as a whole, or even [certain] parts of it, derive from a pre-literate period'\". Van Seters instead proposed that Genesis was an essentially literary work, but one based on a process of supplementation by successive authors rather on a redactorial process (i.e., on the combination of separate documents by an editor or editors). This in turn amounted to a major challenge to the Documentary Hypothesis, the dominant theory concerning the origins of the Pentateuch.\n\nAt the time Van Seters published \"Abraham in History and Tradition\" the dominant scholarly theory regarding the composition of the Pentateuch was the Documentary Hypothesis. This held that the books of the Torah, including the Genesis accounts of Abraham and the Patriarchs, were based on four independent sources. Each of these was originally a complete document in itself, dating from between the 10th and 7th centuries BC and combined into the final work by a Redactor (editor) in the Persian period, c.450 BC. Van Seters retained the idea of source documents but dropped the idea of a redactor, which meant dropping the documentary model itself. In its place he adopted a supplemental model, \"a successive supplementation of one source or author by another,\" in which a Yahwist (not identical with Wellhausen's Yahwist) working in the period of the Babylonian exile was the major but not the final author of Genesis. Van Seter's schema is as follows:\n\nA celebrated scholarly argument ensued between Van Seters and Rolf Rendtorff over the role and existence of the redactors, Van Seters arguing that they did not exist, Rendtorff and his followers arguing that they were essential. Van Seters stated his position as follows: \n\n\n"}

In his legal career, he served as a prosecutor and California Court of Appeal judge, and is most notable as having been the lead prosecutor in Sirhan Sirhan's trial for the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy. Previously, he served with the Los Angeles Police Department. During World War II, he was a commissioned officer with E Company, 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, in the 101st Airborne Division of the United States Army. Compton was portrayed in the HBO miniseries \"Band of Brothers\" by Neal McDonough.\n\nCompton was born in Los Angeles, California. He was an athlete at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), being named an all-conference catcher and All-American selection in 1942. Among his baseball teammates was Jackie Robinson. Compton was later inducted into the UCLA Baseball Hall of Fame. He majored in physical education, with a minor in education. He joined the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity in 1940. He also played with the UCLA football team in the 1943 Rose Bowl game on January 1, 1943; the Georgia Bulldogs beat the UCLA Bruins by a score of 9-0.\n\nAt UCLA, Compton participated in ROTC under Cadet Commander John Singlaub. In December 1943, he joined the Army and was assigned to E Company, 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment in the 101st Airborne Division before Operation Overlord. During the company's action at Brécourt Manor, Compton and others, under the leadership of Lieutenant Richard Winters, assaulted a German battery of four 105 mm howitzers firing on Utah Beach, disabling the guns and routing the enemy. Compton was awarded the Silver Star for his action in disabling the guns. Episode two (\"Day of Days\") of the HBO miniseries \"Band of Brothers\" depicts this assault. During the battle, he threw a grenade that was said to have no arc and hit the German soldier on the back of the helmet.\n\nLater in 1944, Compton was shot through the buttocks while participating in Operation Market Garden, the Allies' ill-fated attempt to seize a number of bridges in the Netherlands and cross the Rhine River into Germany. The bullet traveled sideways, through one side of the buttocks and out the other side. After a partial recovery, he returned to E Company in time for the siege in the frozen Ardennes that became known as the Battle of the Bulge.\n\nCompton was evacuated for severe trench foot; Stephen E. Ambrose concluded that Compton had been \"unnerved\" by witnessing the carnage involving two of his closest friends, Joe Toye and William Guarnere. Compton wrote in his autobiography, \"...although I was affected by the horrors of Bastogne, I do not believe I was clinically shell shocked, as the series portrays me. In real life, while I was hollering for the medic, trying to figure out what to do, I remember two distinct thoughts: How are we going to help the wounded guys?...Maybe this is the time the Germans are really going to get us all.\"\n\nIn January 1945, Compton left E Company with an honorable discharge. He returned on VE Day for the company's annual baseball game.\n\nIn 1947, he joined the Air Force Reserve, serving in the Office of Special Investigations and eventually Judge Advocate General Corps before retiring as a lieutenant colonel in 1970.\n\nIn 1946 he turned down an offer to play minor league baseball, choosing instead to concentrate on a career in law. Compton married Donna Newman in October 1947 and the couple adopted two children. He attended Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, joined the Los Angeles Police Department in 1946 and became a detective in the Central Burglary Division. He left the LAPD for the District Attorney's office in 1951 as a deputy district attorney, and was promoted in 1964 to chief deputy district attorney.\n\nDuring his time with the District Attorney's office, he successfully prosecuted Sirhan Sirhan for the murder of Robert F. Kennedy. In 1970, Governor Ronald Reagan appointed him an Associate Justice of the California Court of Appeal. He retired from the bench in 1990 and resided in the state of Washington until his death.\n\nCompton's memoirs, entitled \"Call of Duty: My Life before, during and after the Band of Brothers\" and written with Marcus Brotherton, were published by Berkeley Publishing on May 6, 2008. A celebration of Compton's 90th birthday was held in January 2012 with nearly 200 in attendance including \"Band of Brothers\" actors Michael Cudlitz, James Madio, Neal McDonough, and Richard Speight, Jr. McDonough developed a friendship with Compton while making the miniseries and kept in touch afterwards. McDonough's son Morgan is nicknamed \"Little Buck\" in honor of Compton.\n\nIn January 2012 Compton suffered a heart attack. On February 25, 2012, he died at a daughter's home in Burlington, Washington. His wife Donna having died previously in 1994, Compton was survived by two daughters and four grandchildren.\n\n\n"}

When it was originally erected as the Diocese of Vincennes on May 6, 1834, it encompassed all of Indiana as well as the eastern third of Illinois. It was renamed the Diocese of Indianapolis on March 28, 1898. Bishop Francis Silas Chatard, who had been living in Indianapolis since 1878 when he was appointed Bishop of Vincennes, became the first Bishop of Indianapolis. It was elevated from a diocese to a metropolitan archdiocese on October 21, 1944.\n\nPer the 2000 census, the archdiocese contained 2,430,606 people, 233,273 of whom were Catholic. The archdiocese covers 39 counties in central and southern Indiana, with a total area of 13,757 square miles. Charles Thompson has been the Archbishop of Indianapolis since 2017.\n\n\n(John T. McNicholas, O.P. was appointed in 1925; did not take effect.)\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore the Archdiocese of Indianapolis was erected in 1944, the episcopal see passed through three other ecclesiastical jurisdictions: the Diocese of Quebec, Canada, until 1789; the Diocese of Baltimore, Maryland, from 1789 to 1808; and the Diocese of Bardstown, Kentucky, from 1808 to 1834. The archdiocese was the Diocese of Vincennes from 1834 to 1898, and the Diocese of Indianapolis from 1898 to 1944.\n\nThe origins of the Catholic mission churches in the area that is now Indiana date to the late seventeenth century, when the Catholic parishes in the area were under the authority of the Diocese of Quebec. It is believed that French Jesuit missionaries first arrived in the area that included present-day Vincennes, Indiana, around 1675. Vincennes was the first seat for the episcopal see. The earliest Catholic church at Vincennes was established around 1732 as Saint Francis Xavier, and served as the cathedral church for the Diocese of Vincennes from 1834 to 1898. Father Sebastian Louis Meurin, Saint Francis Xavier's first resident priest, arrived in May 1748. The parish's earliest records date from April 21, 1749. Following Father Meurin's departure from Vincennes in 1753, several itinerant priests visited the Catholic parish, including Father Pierre Gibault, who served as resident priest at Saint Francis Xavier from 1785 to 1789. In these early years, the Catholic communities in the area experienced hardships during the American Revolution, conflicts with Native Americans, and suffered from epidemics that swept through the frontier. They also lacked financial resources and sufficient priests.\n\nOn November 6, 1789, Pope Pius VI erected the Diocese of Baltimore, the first Catholic diocese in the United States, and the area that became Indiana fell under the authority of John Carroll, Bishop of Baltimore. In 1791 Bishop Carroll sent Father Benedict Joseph Flaget to succeed Father Gibault at the fledgling Saint Francis Xavier Parish. Father Flaget, who arrived at Vincennes in 1792, opened a school and held classes at Saint Francis Xavier before he was recalled to Baltimore in 1795. John Francis Rivet, who came to Vincennes in 1796 as Father Flaget's successor, received an annual teacher's salary of $200 from the U.S. Congress, making him the first public school teacher in the Northwest Territory.\n\nIn 1808, Pope Pius VII divided the Catholic churches in the United States and its territories into five dioceses. the Catholic parishes in the northwest territories came under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Bardstown, with Benedict Flaget appointed as its first bishop. In 1832, Bishop Flaget and Bishop Joseph Rosati, the first bishop of the Diocese of Saint Louis, Missouri, petitioned the Holy See to name Father Simon Bruté de Rémur as the first Bishop of Vincennes.\n\nOn May 6, 1834, Pope Gregory XVI issued a Papal Bull to erect the Diocese of Vincennes, the first episcopal see in Indiana. Father Bruté was consecrated as the first Bishop of Vincennes on October 28, 1834, at Saint Louis. At the time of his installation there were only three priests in his diocese, which covered all of Indiana and the eastern third of Illinois.\n\nBishop Bruté made a point to visit each Catholic family in the new diocese, regardless of the distance from his rectory at Vincennes. In 1837, he founded a college at Vincennes, and connected it to a local theological seminary that had been established under the Eudists. Bishop Bruté's devotion to the diocese also contributed to his demise. He became ill while attending a provincial council in Baltimore, Maryland. The illness weakened the bishop's immune system, but he continued his duties until his death at Vincennes on June 26, 1839.\n\nFather Célestine Guynemer de la Hailandière, Bishop Bruté's vicar general, was consecrated as Bishop of Vincennes on August 18, 1839. Among the new bishop's most significant achievements were completing Saint Francis Xavier Cathedral, which he consecrated on August 8, 1841, and construction of a library at Vincennes to house Bishop Bruté's collection of more than 5,000 books and religious documents. Under Bishop Hailandière's leadership the diocese also expanded its services. The Sisters of Providence established its order within the diocese and the Brothers of the Holy Cross to established schools for boys. Father Edward Sorin, founder of the University of Notre Dame, and Mother Théodore Guérin, founder of Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, also joined Bishop Hailandière in Indiana. Despite Bishop Hailandière's efforts, Indiana's population grew slowly and the institutions he helped to establish experienced many problems. In 1843 the diocese was divided and the Illinois portion became the Diocese of Chicago. Bishop Hailandière resigned in 1847.\n\nJohn Stephen Bazin, Bishop Hailandière's successor, was appointed Bishop of Vincennes on September 3, 1847. Bishop Bazin's consecration took place at Saint Francis Xavier Cathedral on October 24, 1847, making him the first bishop to be ordained in Indiana. Poor health shortened his service to the diocese. The new bishop quickly appointed Jacques Maurice de St. Palais, his vicar general, as the diocesan administrator. Bishop Bazin died at Vincennes on April 23, 1848, having served the diocese for six months.\n\nBishop Bazin's successor, Jacques Maurice de St. Palais, was consecrated as Bishop of Vincennes on January 14, 1849, at Vincennes. During his tenure as bishop, St. Palais had to contend with unresolved monetary issues from Hailandière's episcopacy, a cholera epidemic, and expanding the educational and ministerial opportunities within the diocese. In 1849, Mother Theodore Guerin established an orphanage in Vincennes, and in 1853, monks from Einsiedeln, Switzerland, founded Saint Meinrad abbey and seminary in southern Indiana, but plans to open a school for African Americans were never carried out. In 1857, the Holy See established the Diocese of Fort Wayne, a suffragan diocese in the northern half of Indiana at Fort Wayne.\n\nDuring the American Civil War, Bishop St. Palais had to contend with the call for soldiers, and several priests from the diocese served as chaplains. In 1864, one priest from the diocese, Father Ernest Audran, was drafted as a soldier. Bishop St. Palais did not address the topic of the Emancipation Proclamation because he feared that doing so would venture too far into politics.\n\nAlthough Bishop St. Palais recognized that Indianapolis had become a major city (the eighth largest in the United States by 1870), he deferred the decision to move the seat of the diocese to his successor, Silas Chatard. At the time of the bishop's death in 1877, the diocese had grown to include 151 churches, 117 priests, and 90,000 parishioners.\n\nSilas Chatard, Indiana's first American-born bishop, was consecrated as Bishop of Vincennes in Rome, Italy, on May 12, 1878. Bishop Chatard also obtained permission from Pope Leo XIII to move the bishop's residence and diocesan chancery to Indianapolis in 1878, but the episcopal see remained at Vincennes. Anticipating the eventual relocation of the episcopal see to Indianapolis, Bishop Chatard established Saints Peter and Paul Parish as a new parish on the city's near north side, where he planned to construct a new cathedral. Chatard's tenure as bishop was also marked by his poor health.\n\nOn March 28, 1898, Pope Leo XIII transferred the episcopal see from Vincennes to Indianapolis, and it became the Diocese of Indianapolis. Bishop Chatard was the first Bishop of Indianapolis. Saint John the Evangelist Church in Indianapolis served as the pro-cathedral of the diocese until Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral was completed in 1907. Bishop Chatard, who was paralyzed by a stroke in 1900, died on September 7, 1918, at Indianapolis.\n\nBishop Chatard's successor, Joseph Chartrand, expanded the educational opportunities for young children in the diocese, which opened more than 25 elementary and secondary schools in Chartrand's first 14 years as bishop. When Bishop Chartrand died in 1933, the diocese had 126 parochial schools and 19 secondary schools.\nHe also faced much adversity, such as the outbreak of World War I and the rise of Communism. Bishop Chartrand dealt with threats from the Ku Klux Klan by publishing a list of Klan members in the \"Indianapolis Times\" newspaper. During the Great Depression he exempted the entire diocese from fasting, with the exception of Fridays during Lent.\n\nJoseph Elmer Ritter, who served as auxiliary bishop and vicar general for the diocese, succeeded Chartrand as Bishop of Indianapolis in March 1934. In 1937, seventeen years before \"Brown v. Board of Education\" (1954), the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision that declared segregation in public schools unconstitutional, Bishop Ritter ordered the integration of three girls' schools in the diocese to allow enrollment for students of all races. In 1942, he integrated the Catholic high school in Evansville, Indiana.\n\nIn October 1944, Pope Pius XII elevated the Diocese of Indianapolis to a metropolitan archdiocese. Bishop Ritter was named the first Archbishop of Indianapolis. The Pope also founded the Diocese of Evansville and the Diocese of Lafayette, two suffragan sees in Indiana. In 1946, Archbishop Ritter left Indianapolis to become Archbishop of Saint Louis; he became a Cardinal Priest in 1961.\n\nArchbishop Paul Clarance Schulte led the archdiocese from 1946 until 1970, and was called to Rome for the Second Vatican Council. He was known for his humility, for building three high schools in the Indianapolis area and seventeen churches in the archdiocese, and for his leadership during the tumultuous 1960s. On December 17, 1956, during Schulte's tenure as Archbishop of Indianapolis, the Diocese of Gary was erected in northwestern Indiana. Archbishop Schulte resigned from the post in Indianapolis in 1970. Upon his retirement in 1984, he was the oldest and longest-serving bishop in the United States. George Joseph Biskup, who became Archbishop of Indianapolis in 1970, established the first Priests Senate in order to expedite decisions and encourage communications between the archbishop and the priests within the archdiocese.\n\nEdward T. O'Meara, who was installed as the Archbishop of Indianapolis in 1980, reorganized the archdiocesan offices and consolidated many of them into one location at the former Cathedral High School, across the street from Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral in Indianapolis. The renovated school was renamed the Catholic Center. Archbishop O'Meara was also concerned about the shortage of priests within the archdiocese. Although the archbishop did not believe that ordination female clergy was a solution to the problem, he appointed women to key roles. Archbishop O'Meara also supported pro-life issues and the needs of the poor. The archdiocese celebrated its 150th anniversary in 1984.\nArchbishop O'Meara's successor, Daniel M. Buechlein, became Archbishop of Indianapolis in September 1992. He continued his ministry of devotion to pro-life issues, Catholic education, and poor relief. Because of his focus on education, the news media designated him the \"education bishop.\" Pope Benedict XVI appointed Christopher Coyne to assist the ailing Buechlein with his duties in March 2011, and on September 21, 2011, the Holy See granted Archbishop Buechlein an early retirement at the age of 73, due to health issues. Auxiliary Bishop Coyne served as Apostolic Administrator until October 2012, when Joseph Tobin was appointed Archbishop of Indianapolis.\n\nArchbishop-designate Charles C. Thompson was appointed Archbishop of Indianapolis by Pope Francis on June 13, 2017. His Installation Mass was on Friday, 28 July 2017, when he also received the Pallium, the insignia of his role as Metropolitan of the Indiana Province. A Catholic high school teacher in a same-sex marriage was fired and afterward sued the Archdiocese of Indianapolis on July 10, 2019, for discrimination and interfering with his teaching contract. They had reached a settlement in which the school will help with future employment opportunities. Meanwhile, the archdiocese said Brebeuf Jesuit Preparatory School in Indianapolis is no longer recognized as a Catholic institution due to its refusal to fire a teacher in a same-sex marriage.\n\nThe patron saints of the Archdiocese of Indianapolis are Saints Francis Xavier and Theodora Guerin. Saint Francis Xavier was the patron of the first cathedral of the diocese, and therefore also of the diocese. Saint Theodora Guerin was the first saint canonized from the archdiocese and was recognized as patroness of the archdiocese in 2006.\n\nSince 1834 three parish churches have served as diocesan cathedrals or as pro-cathedrals. Saint Francis Xavier in Vincennes was the cathedral for the diocese from 1834 to 1898. Saint John the Evangelist Church in Indianapolis served as the pro-cathedral for the diocese from 1878 to 1906. Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral in Indianapolis began its service as the cathedral church in 1906.\n\nSaint Francis Xavier Basilica, a Greek Revival-style church, dates to 1826, making it the oldest Catholic church in Indiana. It is similar in design to the Bardstown Cathedral in Kentucky. Pope Paul VI elevated the historic cathedral to the status of a minor basilica in 1970.\n\nThe cornerstone for Saint Francis Xavier Church was laid on March 30, 1826. The first services were held in the new church during the summer of 1827, although the interior was not yet complete. A bell tower designed by the architect Jean-Marie Marsile was added in the 1830s.\n\nOn May 6, 1834, when Pope Gregory XVI issued a Papal Bull to erect the Diocese of Vincennes, Saint Francis Xavier became the cathedral church for the new diocese. The church was still unfinished when Bishop Bruté, the first Bishop of Vincennes, arrived in 1834. Bishop Hailandière continued work to complete the cathedral, which he consecrated on August 8, 1841. Saint Francis Xavier served as the diocesan cathedral until 1898, when the episcopal see was transferred to Indianapolis. The remains of the first four Bishops of Vincennes (Bruté, Hailandière, Bazin, and St. Palais) are buried in Saint Francis Xavier's crypt.\n\nThe cathedral's interior features three large murals painted in 1870 by Wilhelm Lamprecht, a German artist. These include a Crucifixion scene, the Virgin Mary with the patron saints of the first four bishops of Vincennes (Saints Simon, Celestine, Stephen, and Maurice), and Saint Francis Xavier, the parish's patron saint. Fourteen oil paintings from France were procured for the Stations of the Cross.\n\nIn the early 1870s, when Bishop St. Palais visited Indianapolis, he resided at Saint John the Evangelist Church's rectory and used the parish church as the pro-cathedral for the diocese. His successor, Bishop Silas Chatard, formally obtained permission from Pope Leo XIII to establish the bishop's residence and chancery at Indianapolis in 1878. When Bishop Chatard moved to Indianapolis, many considered Saint John as a diocesan cathedral, but it was never officially named as such. Saint Francis Xavier Cathedral remained the official cathedral and Vincennes as the see city for the diocese until March 28, 1898, when Pope Leo XIII officially transferred the episcopal see to Indianapolis and it became the Diocese of Indianapolis.\n\nThe rectory at Saint John served as the bishop's residence from August 1878 until April 18, 1892, when Bishop Chatard moved into the new rectory at Fourteenth and Meridian Streets in Indianapolis. The rectory at Saint John continued to house the diocesan chancery until 1968, and it served as the metropolitan tribunal for the diocese until 1982.\n\nSaint John Church is the main structure in a cluster of parish buildings on the southwest corner of Georgia Street and Capitol Avenue in Indianapolis. Diedrich A. Bohlen, principal and founder of the architectural firm of D. A. Bohlen and Son, designed the rectory (1863), the present-day Saint Johns Church (1867–71) and the rectory addition (1878). Construction on Saint John Church, which includes a mix of American Romanesque Revival and French Gothic Revival architectural styles,\nbegan in April 1867. Bishop St. Palais laid its cornerstone on July 21, 1867, and John B. Purcell, Archbishop of Cincinnati, dedicated the new church on July 2, 1871. Bohlen's son, Oscar, designed the twin spires on the towers that flank the main facade and supervised their construction. Due to the expense, the spires were not added until 1893, more than twenty years after the church's dedication.\n\nGuy Leber, an Italian-Swiss painter from Louisville, Kentucky, painted the ceiling of the apse at Saint John with \"The Angels of Glory\" (white-robed angels and halo-crowned seraphs). L. Chovet of Paris, France, provided paintings for the Stations of the Cross. In 1971, on the centennial anniversary of its dedication, the interior of the church was refurbished with the generosity of Monsignor Charles P. Koster. In the confusion following the Second Vatican Council, the communion rail was removed, the altar was repositioned to allow the priest to face the congregation, and the baptismal font was moved to the left transept.\n\nSaints Peter and Paul Cathedral Parish serves as the seat of the archdiocese. The parish originated in 1892, when Bishop Chatard formally established it in a residential neighborhood north of downtown Indianapolis. Construction for a chapel and rectory at Fourteenth and Meridian Streets began in 1891. The chapel was dedicated on March 25, 1892, and Bishop Chatard moved into the rectory on April 18, 1892. Anticipating the episcopal see's relocation from Vincennes to Indianapolis, Bishop Chatard purchased additional lots at Fourteenth and Meridian Streets in July 1894 to allow for additional space to build a cathedral. Saints Peter and Paul became the cathedral parish for the diocese on March 28, 1898, when Pope Leo XIII officially transferred the seat of the diocese to Indianapolis. At that time Bishop Chatard proceeded with plans to raise fund to build a new cathedral.\n\nSaints Peter and Paul Cathedral was built between 1905 and 1907 with a temporary facade. James Renwick Jr.'s architectural firm of Renwick, Aspinwall and Russell, W. L. Coulter of New York designed the Classical Revival-style cathedral, rectory, and adjacent chapel. It is believed the design for the cathedral is modeled after Saint John Lateran in Rome, Italy. William Whetten Renwick, nephew of American architect James Renwick Jr., assumed sole responsibility for the completion of the cathedral around 1900, a few years after James's death, and simplified its design. The Indianapolis architectural firm of D. A. Bohlen and Son served as local supervisors for the construction project. The high altar of the unfinished Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral was consecrated on December 21, 1906, and the first Pontifical High Mass at the new cathedral took place on December 25, 1906. Construction of the permanent facade and twin spires was postponed due to a shortage of funds. Bishop Ritter arranged for the completion of the cathedral in 1936, when Indianapolis architect August Bohlen, son of Oscar and grandson of Diedrich Bohlen, supervised construction of the permanent facade, which was designed by Layton (Dick) DeMilt of the Bohlen architectural firm. The permanent facade was also modeled after Saint John Lateran in Rome.\n\nThe original interior of cathedral was ornately decorated. Major renovations and additions made in 1915, 1936, and 1985 have altered its appearance. William Renwick designed the cathedral's original interior decorations, including three altars, doorway and arch decoration, metal ceiling, and frames for the Stations of the Cross. D. A. Bohlen and Son designed the original baptismal fonts and dark oak furnishings. In 1936 the original murals by Edgar S. Cameron of Chicago were covered with glass mosaics that depicted an enthroned Christ in Majesty flanked by Saints Peter and Paul. Bishop Chatard commissioned Cesare Aureli, a Roman sculptor, to carve the cathedral's Blessed Mother and Child statue and the Saint Joseph statue in white Carrara marble. They were installed around 1909. Aureli's statue of Saint Frances de Sales (Bishop Chatard's patron saint) was delivered in 1911 and installed on the high altar. A life-size Crucifixion was installed above the main altar in 1915. The sanctuary also includes a copy of Antonio Montauti's Pietà. Renovations begun in 1985 were based on liturgical changes made following the Second Vatican Council. The refurbished cathedral was rededicated on May 14, 1986.\n\nBishop Joseph Chartrand was ordained a priest in the Saints Peter and Paul chapel on September 24, 1892, and consecrated as Bishop of Indianapolis at the cathedral on September 15, 1910. Joseph Ritter, Chartrand's successor and the first Archbishop of Indianapolis, was consecrated auxiliary bishop at the cathedral in 1933. Bishops Chatard and Chartrand were initially buried in the cathedral's crypt, but their remains were removed and interred at Calvary Cemetery in Indianapolis in 1976.\n\nThe archdiocese contains two Catholic colleges, two seminaries, seven Catholic high schools, and 60 Catholic elementary schools.\n\nCirca 2008 the system had about 24,000 students. The archdiocese established the Cristo Rey Project with the Sisters of Providence, for low income students, in fall 2006.\n\nThe following schools are operated under the auspices of the archdiocese:\n\nThe following schools are operated under the auspices of religious institutes:\n\n\nSt. Meinrad Archabbey, a Benedictine Monastery; serves the archdiocese as a seminary and lay graduate school of theology.

{"id": "2002807", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2002807", "title": "Roman Catholic Diocese of Bardstown", "text": "Roman Catholic Diocese of Bardstown\n\nThe Roman Catholic Diocese of Bardstown (Kentucky) was established on April 8, 1808, along with the dioceses of Boston, New York, and Philadelphia, out of the territory of the Baltimore Diocese, the first Catholic diocese in the United States. When founded, the Bardstown Diocese included most of Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Michigan. The geographical area was large, and today there are 44 dioceses in the area comprising the original diocese.\n\nThe first Catholic immigrants to the area came from Maryland in the year 1785. By 1796 it is estimated that there were 300 Catholic families in Kentucky. Among the early missionaries were Fathers Stephen Badin and Michel Barriere who set out on foot for Kentucky on September 3, 1793, sent by Bishop John Carroll of Baltimore. In April, 1794 Barriere left Bardstown, for New Orleans but Fr. Badin established the home base for his missionary journeys on Pottinger's Creek. For the next 14 years Fr. Badin travelled on foot, horseback and boat between widely scattered Catholic settlements in Kentucky and the Northwest Territory. After the departure of Father Barriêres, for three years Father Badin was the only priest in the whole of Kentucky. In 1797 the Rev. M.J.C. Fournier and, in 1799, the Rev. Anthony Salmon joined Father Badin, but the latter was killed by a fall from a horse nine months after his arrival, and Father Fournier died in 1803. In 1805 he received permanent help with the arrival of Rev. Charles Nerinckx. \n\nA French colony arrived at Louisville in the year 1806 and settled near the Falls of the Ohio, to engage in the milling business, utilizing the falls for power. Their first church was built in 1811; Father Badin was the first pastor, and continued as such until 1817. In 1808, Bardstown became a diocese in its own right, with Benedict Joseph Flaget as the first bishop, although he did not arrive at that post for another three years and the following year returned to Baltimore with Fr. Badin to discuss land title and other problems. J.B. David was ordained a bishop and named Flaget's co-adjutor in 1817, but he tried to refuse the difficult position. \n\nBenedict Joseph Flaget was appointed by the Holy See as the first Bishop of the newly established Diocese of Bardstown on April 8, 1808. This was the largest diocese ever formed in the United States and comprised an area now covering 10 modern states, including Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee, Michigan, Indiana and others. Flaget, opposed the appointment and traveled to France in an effort to have it reversed. He was unsuccessful in this effort. \n\nOn his return trip to the United States, Flaget brought other early Sulpician missionaries to America: Simon Bruté, Guy Ignatius Chabrat, Anthony Deydier, and James Derigaud. The first two also became bishops in America. Upon his arrival, Flaget was consecrated a bishop by now-Archbishop Carroll on November 4, 1810 in a ceremony at the Baltimore Cathedral, now a basilica. \n\nUpon taking office the following year, Flaget found himself charged with the pastoral care of the western frontier of the United States, having the assistance of seven priests. Saint Thomas Seminary was established in 1811, and Saint Joseph College in Bardstown in 1820. The college was closed during the American Civil War and the building briefly served as a hospital for Union soldiers. Saint Mary College was founded in 1821. Before it was closed in 1976, it was the third oldest Catholic college for boys in the country.\n\nThe Diocese of Bardstown established its first church, Saint Thomas Parish, within four years of its founding. The diocese eventually increased the number of parishes to 23, and the number of priests from six to 36 within the first 25 years of its founding. The cornerstone of historic Basilica of Saint Joseph Proto-Cathedral was laid on July 16, 1816. Many of the paintings and interior decorations were donated by Pope Leo XII, King Louis-Philippe of France and others. The former cathedral of the Diocese of Bardstown, it is now a parish church. Flaget was responsible for a growing network of congregations such as Saint Louis in Louisville (1805), (1818), Holy Name in Henderson (1824)\n\nThe Dominicans arrived in Springfield in 1805. The Sisters of Loretto were founded in Marion County in 1812, that same year, Sisters of Charity of Nazareth were founded near Bardstown. \n\nFlaget was briefly succeeded in 1832 by John Baptist Mary David who resigned less than a year later, when Flaget was again appointed to head the diocese. \n\nIn 1841, the Diocese was transferred from Bardstown to Louisville and was renamed the Diocese of Louisville with its Cathedral of the Assumption. Later it was raised to Archdiocese of Louisville. The Diocese of Bardstown, no longer a residential bishopric, is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.\n\nPope Benedict XVI's visit to the United States in April 2008 celebrated the 200th anniversary of the 1808 creation of the new dioceses and the elevation of Baltimore to an archdiocese.\n\n\n"}

Lillington has grown from a village which existed before the time of the \"Domesday Book\" (1086), and was incorporated into the borough of Leamington in 1890.\n\nLillington itself has two main areas - the new centre based around Crown Way which contains shops, dry cleaners and a post office. The area was predominantly built as a council house estate from 1950 onwards, and contains three tower blocks. The tallest of these, the fifteen-storey \"Eden Court,\" standing at the highest point of the estate, dominates the skyline and can be seen from south Leamington Spa, Radford Semele and for miles outside Leamington.\nThe second, and older area, contains the former village with the parish church of St. Mary Magdalene, the manor house, some Victorian terraced houses as well as estates of predominantly semi-detached houses built since 1930.\n\nThe \"Campion Hills\" are the highest area of Leamington, rising to an altitude of 97m above OD. Situated to the north of, and above Newbold Comyn park, they offer a view over the whole town. Sited here is Leamington's transmission tower which relays TV signals from Sutton Coldfield and broadcasts local commercial radio station, Free Coventry & Warwickshire. Its Severn Trent water treatment plant serves the whole Leamington area. Warwick District Council runs a BMX track on the hills.\n\nThe Bins Brook is a mainly culverted watercourse that runs south into Leamington. Just inside Lillington, on the Leamington town centre side adjacent to the Midland Oak, is a fenced area of meadow plants in a man-made depression. This excavated area is normally dry, but fills from the Bins Brook if it overflows during flash floods, to reduce the risk of local flooding to property.\n\nThe Midland Oak by the junction of Lillington Avenue and Lillington Road marks the supposed very centre of England. The original oak is thought to have dated form the 16th century. Having died, it was removed in 1967, which allowed the Lillington Road to be straightened. The successor was planted in the 1980s, from an acorn collected from the original.\n\nIn the 1930s pre-historic elephant and woolly rhinoceros remains were found in sand and gravel pits in Cubbington Road, near the site of the present Lillington Free Church. Some of these are displayed in Warwick Market Hall Museum. Stone Age remains have also been found there. Roman artefacts and burials have been discovered in the area of Highland Road and Braemar Road.\n\nLillington was once well known as a centre for horse-breeding at the stud farm owned by Sydney McGregor (1889 - 1970). McGregor's best known horse was probably April the Fifth, which won the Epsom Derby in 1932. The farm buildings and house stood at the end of Epsom Road. After 1970, the area was developed for housing, with many of the new roads having racing-related names.\n\nThe local schools are Lillington Nursery and Primary School, Telford Infant and Telford Junior Schools. The nearest secondary school is North Leamington School. A Sure Start Children’s Centre opened in late 2006, adjacent to the 1950s built community centre, and Lillington Library on Mason Avenue.\n\nThe Church of England parish church of St. Mary Magdalene in Vicarage Road retains some Saxon work, but was largely rebuilt between 1847 and 1884. The late Perpendicular tower also remains, with a contemporary bell cast around 1480. With two seventeenth-century bells and five more dating from 1927, the present ring of eight bells was formed. They were re-hung by Nicholsons' of Bridport in 2007.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady, in Valley Road next to the Public Library, was consecrated in 1963. It has notable stained glass in the 'Dalle de verre' style, created by Dom Charles Norris of Prinknash.\n\nLillington Free Church is on the north side of Cubbington Road, close to The Holt.\nLillington adjoins Cubbington to the north.\n\n"}
{"id": "2002835", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2002835", "title": "Vital capacity", "text": "Vital capacity\n\nVital capacity (VC) is the maximum amount of air a person can expel from the lungs after a maximum inhalation. It is equal to the sum of inspiratory reserve volume, tidal volume, and expiratory reserve volume. It is approximately equal to Forced Vital Capacity (FVC).\n\nA person's vital capacity can be measured by a wet or regular spirometer. In combination with other physiological measurements, the vital capacity can help make a diagnosis of underlying lung disease. Furthermore, the vital capacity is used to determine the severity of respiratory muscle involvement in neuromuscular disease, and can guide treatment decisions in Guillain–Barré syndrome and myasthenic crisis.\n\nA normal adult has a vital capacity between 3 and 5 litres. A human's vital capacity depends on age, sex, height, mass, and possibly ethnicity. However, the dependence on ethnicity is poorly understood or defined, as it was first established by studying black slaves in the 19th century and may be the result of conflation with environmental factors.\n\nLung volumes and lung capacities refer to the volume of air associated with different phases of the respiratory cycle. Lung volumes are directly measured, whereas lung capacities are inferred from volumes.\n\nThe vital capacity can be used to help differentiate causes of lung disease. In restrictive lung disease the vital capacity is decreased. In obstructive lung disease it is usually normal or only slightly decreased.\n\nVital capacity increases with height and decreases with age. Formulas to estimate vital capacity are:\nformula_1\nwhere formula_2 is approximate vital capacity in cm, formula_3 is age in years, and formula_4 is height in cm.\n\nSeveral studies have been made to measure and predict vital capacity. An online calculator exists that will compute the predicted vital capacity based on these references given a patient's, age, height and sex.\n"}
