The organisation was formed in 1978 and came to prominence under the inspiration and time of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale in 1981. They claim that their primary aim of Dal Khalsa is to achieve the independence of the Punjabi-speaking Sikh majority region of North West India through peaceful and democratic means in order to establish a sovereign Sikh state, Khalistan.\n\nDal Khalsa state their aims and objectives as follows:\n\nThere is a controversy on the foundation of Dal Khalsa. Noted journalist Mark Tully in his book claimed that Sanjay Gandhi and Giani Zail Singh were instrumental in its formation in order to promote Bhinderawale and to harass Akalis. Another version is that it was founded by Gurbachan Singh Manochahal on 6 August 1978, at a convention held at Gurdwara Akal-Garh, Sector 35, Chandigarh, with the objective of establishing an independent Sikh state outside the Union of India. A number of Sikh Youth organisations had participated in the convention to discuss affairs of the Sikh Panth. The formation of the Dal Khalsa occurred shortly after an infamous clash between Sikhs belonging to the Akhand Kirtani Jatha and the followers of a Sikh sect known as the Nirankaris (whom other Sikhs regard as heretics). This clash had occurred at a Nirankari event at the Harmandir Sahib in Amritsar on 13 April 1978, in which 3 Nirankaris and 13 Sikhs were killed.\n\nAt its first annual conference held in Gurdaspur during December, 1979, the Dal Khalsa passed a resolution demanding that Amritsar be officially declared a \"holy city\". A demand that was supported by other Sikh organisations such as the Sikh Students Federation and one which was later taken up with the Indian government by the SGPC in 1980. However, the Indian government made no decision on the demand to declare Amritsar a \"holy city\" which prompted the Dal Khalsa and the Sikh Students Federation to organise a procession on 31 May 1981. The Hindu community was opposed to the demand of declaring Amritsar a \"holy city\" and held their own parallel procession in Amritsar on 29 May 1981.\n\nFor the first time the flag of Khalistan was hoisted on 1 August 1980, by activists of the Dal Khalsa at the spot in Amritsar where 13 Sikhs had been killed during a clash with the Nirankaris on 13 April 1978. Shortly after activists of the Dal Khalsa again raised the flag of Khalistan at various places in the Punjab state during India's Independence day on 15 August 1980.\n\nDuring 1981 the Dal Khalsa along with other Sikh organisations such as the Sikh Students Federation, SGPC and Shiromani Akali Dal demanded associate membership in the United Nations for the 'Sikh Nation'. Owing largely to the Dal Khalsa a resolution to this effect was passed at the \"Sikh Educational Conference\" held in Chandigarh on 15 March 1981, which had been organised by the Chief Khalsa Diwan. During this event American based Khalistan protagonist, Ganga Singh Dhillon, delivered a speech on why the Sikhs are a nation and slogans of \"Khalistan Zindabad\" (Long live Khalistan) were raised at the event.\n\nA 10-year ban was put on the Dal Khalsa by the Indian government in 1982 following militant activities carried out by the organization. These included several plane hijackings such as the 1981 hijacking of an Indian Airlines Jetliner (Boeing 737). The plane was hijacked on 29 September 1981, by five members of the Dal Khalsa as a form of protest against the arrest of Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale who had been accused of being involved in the murder of Jalandhar based Hindu newspaper owner Jagat Narain later on Ranjit Singh confessed to murdered Jagat Narain. Ranjit Singh was from Akhand Kirtani Jatha and did not belong to Bhindranwale. The hijackers were under the leadership of Gajinder Singh who a few years later was nominated as Chairman of the organization while on asylum in Pakistan. The Dal Khalsa activists forced the plane to land in Lahore, Pakistan and demanded the release of Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale in addition to demanding the release of all persons who had been detained in connection with the Khalistan movement, a ransom of 500,000 dollars and compensation of 100,000 Indian Rupees (Rs.) for the families of each Sikhs that had been killed on 20 September 1981, at Chowk Mehta after the arrest of Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. A day after the hijacking Pakistani commandos arrested the Dal Khalsa activists. The hijackers were identified as Gajinder Singh, Satnam Singh of Paonta Sahib, Jasbir Singh of Ropar, Tejinderpal Singh of Jalandhar and Karam Singh of Jammu. Though Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale had never openly or officially associated with the Dal Khalsa the organization was largely seen have had close links with him.\n\nIn January 1982, Harsimran Singh, chief organizer of the Dal Khalsa was arrested from Mohali near Chandigarh. The Dal Khalsa leaders believed that his arrest was possible due to a conspiracy by some member of the organization. Harsimran Singh was allegedly tortured by the police and was told that they had the permission of the Government to kill him in a fake encounter near the Indo-Pakistan border. Harsimran Singh was forced to read out a written statement if he wanted to save his life.\n\nSometime during April 1982, two cow heads were severed and placed outside two Hindu temples in Amritsar by unknown culprits though the police later blamed it on the Dal Khalsa. The incident sparked off a small riot in which a large Hindu crowd gathered at the Harmandir Sahib and began pelting stones at the most sacred place of the Sikhs. Jaswant Singh Thekedar, who at the time was an activist of the Dal Khalsa, was accused of being involved in the incident and was declared a 'Proclaimed Offender' carrying a reward of Rs. 50,000 on him. He fled to the UK via Nepal in 1983 and was expelled from the Dal Khalsa in 1986 for what were said to be 'anti-party' activities by him.\n\nThe Dal Khalsa and National Council of Khalistan were banned by the Indian government in May, 1982 after which the Dal Khalsa went underground. Two years later, the Dal Khalsa announced its \"Government in Exile\" in June, 1984.\n\nGajinder Singh, one of the plane hijackers of the Indian Airlines Jetliner (Boeing 737) in 1981, accepted the post of Chairman of the Dal Khalsa in 1986.\n\nAfter remaining largely dormant and underground for over a decade the Dal Khalsa was revived in 1998 after the ban on the organisation had lapsed. The revived Dal Khalsa continues to commit to its original objective of establishing an independent Khalistan. The main office of the Dal Khalsa is presently based in Amritsar at \"Freedom House\", Sarhadi Complex, Railway Road. The Dal Khalsa has since also established units in the United States and the Dal Khalsa UK in addition to branches across the Punjab state, India. The revived Dal Khalsa has pledged to put aside armed resistance and further the cause of Khalistan by peaceful and democratic means.\n\nOn 30 September 2005, the co-founder of the Dal Khalsa, Gajinder Singh stepped down as Chairman of the organisation. Satnam Singh Paonta, himself one of the original Dal Khalsa founders, was chosen as the new President on 2 October (2005) at a convention held in Chandigarh. In addition to Satnam Singh Paonta being chosen as the new leader of the Dal Khalsa, the organization welcomed Jaspal Singh Dhillon, head of the Human Rights and Democracy Forum into the party fold as its new vice President.\n\nThe new senior leadership of the Dal Khalsa had pledged that it will continue to deploy peaceful methods to achieve an independent Khalistan but will also take up other socio-political issues faced by the people of Punjab such as education for rural children and tackling the menace of drug abuse. However, the primary objective of the Dal Khalsa would remain the same and that it will not divert from its original and main goal of establishing an independent and sovereign Khalistan.\n\nIn June 2005, the Dal Khalsa became a constituent member of the Punjab Rights Forum.\n\nCurrently H.S. Dhami is the president of Dal Khalsa, and Kanwarpal Singh is the secretary general. Mr Dhami, 58 who hails from Hoshiarpur is industrialist by profession. He did M.S.C in 1975 from DAV College, Jalandhar and it was the writings and revolutionary poetry of Gajinder Singh that inspired him to join the organization in 2003.\n\nIn May 2006 the Vice-President of the Dal Khalsa, Jaspal Singh Dhillon, paid a visit to London, UK where he had been invited to attend and deliver a speech on Self-determination for Khalistan at the inaugural launch and conference of a new lobby group called Parliamentarians for National Self-Determination (PNSD) which was held on 11 May at the British Parliament in Westminster. The Dal Khalsa has sought to work closely with Parliamentarians for National Self-Determination in which the Sikh Nation is one of the founder members.\n\nIn February 2007 the Dal Khalsa broke from its earlier stance regarding the Punjab state legislature by supporting two candidates in the Punjab polls, most notably SGPC member Karnail Singh Panjoli. During the Punjab legislative assembly elections the Dal Khalsa also supported candidates from the Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar) led by Simranjit Singh Mann.\n\nIn September, 2008, Dal Khalsa named the expatriate Sikh leader Manmohan Singh vice president. Singh had already been placed on an Indian government blacklist for past militant activities.\n\nOn 3 November 2009, marking 25 years of the anti-Sikh massacre following the assassination of then PM Indira Gandhi, Dal Khalsa called for Punjab Bandh. In showing solidarity to the cause, the people of Punjab, regardless of their religion or race, observed complete shutdown in the state to protest against the denial of justice to the aggrieved Sikhs. The bandh was largely peaceful, and the shutdown call had a full backing of other factions like Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee, Shiromani Akali Dal (Panch Pardani), Sikh Youth of Punjab and various factions of Sikh Students Federation. In November 2009, Kanwarpal Singh and other noted Sikh representatives from various organizations, under the leadership of Justice (retd) Ajit Singh Bains met Ms Shalini Dewan, Director, United Nations Information Centre at New Delhi on 11 November 2009 and urged the UN to intervene in getting justice for victims of November 1984 anti-Sikh carnage. The meet was cordial and Ms Dewan assured the delegation that UN will certainly take up the matter with the Indian government so that justice is delivered to aggrieved Sikhs. She took exception on the killings of thousands of innocent Sikhs and expressed regret that justice has not been delivered even after 25 years.\n\nOn 26 January 2010, Dal Khalsa wrote a letter to Indian PM highlighting constitutional and legal discriminations faced by Sikhs in India. It demanded that Indian state should immediately abrogate Article 25 (2) (b) of the Indian constitution as it violates the fundamental recognition of Sikhs as a separate religion\"\n\nOn 12 May 2010, to commemorate first rule established by Sikh leader Baba Banda Singh Bahadur, Dal Khalsa held a big Sikh parade in India starting from Chaparchiri to Fatehgarh Sahib where flag of Khalistan was unfurled and saluted and pictures of Sikh militants (who died fighting for Khalistan) were openly displayed. In 2015, Dal Khalsa demanded opening of Cow-Slaughterhouses in Punjab and also questioned Beef-Ban in Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nIn September 2015, Dal Khalsa and Shiromani Akali Dal (Panch Pardani) merged into a single entity by signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the main aim to achieve a separate Sikh home land.\n\nOn 14 March 2010 Dal Khalsa commemorated 227th anniversary of the historic event when Sikh warrior Baba Baghel Singh, unfurled Nishan Sahib atop the historic Red Fort in 1783. At a well-attended convention at a village gurdwara built in memory of Baba Baghel Singh, Dal Khalsa rejected the amended version of the SGPC Nanakshahi Calendar which went back to the original Sikh calendar with Bikrami dates (moon dates). They released the Nanakshahi calendar (Mool Nanakshahi Calendar)created by SGPC sponsored Sikh scholar Pal Singh Purewal. The calendar has been dedicated to the great Sikh warrior Baba Baghel Singh.. \n\nDal Khalsa spokesperson Kanwarpal Singh rued that the SGPC has killed the letter and spirit of Nanakshahi calendar by mixing it with Bikrami calendar, which had its roots in Hinduism. \"We had mentioned dates of Gurpurabs [Sikh religious days] according to original calendar adopted in April 2003 as we believe that the amended version has an imprint of RSS ideology,\" Singh said. \"Dal Khalsa fully recognises the conspiracy behind this which is led by Hindutva Fanatics and the RSS. In principle, we are totally against the changes as per Bikrami calendar made by the SGPC on the dictates of SAD (Badal) to appease Sant Samaj,\" he alleged. On 3 January 2010, SGPC executive members had given approval to bring amendments in Nanak Shahi Calendar, following the green signal from Akal Takht. However, several Sikh organisations have condemned the changes brought in the calendar.\n\nIn order to press upon the SGPC and SAD leadership to build memorial of June 1984 martyrs, Dal Khalsa party activists held 72 hours sit-in protest at outside the main entrance gate of Darbar Sahib Complex from 3 June to 6,2010.\n\nA jatha of 100 activists led by party head H S Dhami began their silent protest outside the SGPC offices on 3 June at 11 AM. Addressing the media over there, party head urged Jathedar Avtar Singh Makkar to break the silence and take the lead as it was high time to lay the foundation stone of the memorial as the Sikh Nation is observing the 26th anniversary of Darbar Sahib on 6 June.\n\nStressing on the need to build memorial, he said by raising the memorial in memory of 'martyrs of the faith', the SGPC would not only deliver a sense of pride and fraternity to their families but also goads the Sikhs to relive those times. Also it will be a rebuttal to those, who have been trying to erase this period from public memory.\n\nActivists mostly youngsters from Hoshiarpur, Ludhiana, Amritsar, Jalandhar, Nawanshahr and Moga participated in the sit-in to show their steadfastness towards the cause and also to pay homage to martyrs.\n\nOn the concluding day (6 June) of its 72 hours sit-in protest, the organization vowed to take the June 84 memorial issue to its logical conclusion. H S Dhami said it's a beginning of the struggle. Our aim was to pay tribute to the 'martyrs of faith' and bring the issue of memorial into limelight, which we had succeeded. He said the silence of Akali leadership about memorial to 1984 martyrs even after 26 years of the deadly attack was disgusting and disappointing.\n\nParty's senior most leader Satnam Singh Paonta Sahib ended his 72 hours fast after performing Ardas at Akal Takht by eating karah parshad.\n\n"}
{"id": "2253642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2253642", "title": "And I Love Her", "text": "And I Love Her\n\n\"And I Love Her\" is a song recorded by English rock band the Beatles, written primarily by Paul McCartney and credited to the Lennon–McCartney partnership. It is the fifth track of their third UK album \"A Hard Day's Night\" and was released 20 July 1964, along with \"If I Fell\", as a single release by Capitol Records in the United States, reaching No. 12 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n\nThe Beatles performed \"And I Love Her\" just once outside EMI Studios; on 14 July 1964 they played it for an edition of the BBC's \"Top Gear\" radio show, which was broadcast two days later.\n\nA majority of the composition shifts back and forth between the key of E and its relative minor C#m. It also changes keys altogether just before the solo, to Gm. The final chord is a D major. This technique of ending is known as Picardy third resolution.\n\nThe song was written mainly by McCartney, though John Lennon claimed in an interview with \"Playboy\" that his major contribution was the middle eight section (\"A love like ours/Could never die/As long as I/Have you near me\").\n\nBeatles publisher Dick James lends support to this claim, saying that the middle eight was added during recording at the suggestion of producer George Martin (an early take of the song was released on \"Anthology 1\" in 1995, and the middle eight had not yet been added). According to James, Lennon called for a break and \"within half an hour [Lennon and McCartney] wrote ... a very constructive middle to a very commercial song.\" McCartney, on the other hand, maintains that \"the middle eight is mine ... I wrote this on my own. I would say that John probably helped with the middle eight, but he can't say 'It's mine'.\"\n\n\"The 'And' in the title was an important thing – 'And I Love Her,' it came right out of left field, you were right up to speed the minute you heard it,\" McCartney said. \"The title comes in the second verse and it doesn't repeat. You would often go to town on the title, but this was almost an aside: 'Oh ... and I love you.'\"\n\nMcCartney has credited George Harrison with composing the signature guitar riff, saying it \"made a stunning difference to the song\". He also said that Harrison should probably have been listed as a co-writer.\n\nMcCartney called \"And I Love Her\" \"the first ballad I impressed myself with\". Lennon called it McCartney's \"first 'Yesterday'\".\n\nAn instrumental version of \"And I Love Her\", orchestrated by George Martin, was released as a single with \"Ringo's Theme (This Boy)\" as the B-side on 18 July 1964. It failed to chart on the US Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 105, while \"Ringo's Theme (This Boy)\" peaked at number 53 later that year. \"And I Love Her\" was included on Martin's Parlophone album \"Off the Beatle Track\" and the EP \"Music From A Hard Day's Night\" by the George Martin Orchestra, released on 19 February 1965. It was also included on the American \"A Hard Day's Night\" soundtrack album.\n\nRecorded by the Beatles over three days, in Abbey Road Studio Two, the sessions were produced by George Martin and engineered by Norman Smith. The second engineer was Richard Langham.\n\nWork began at 2:30pm on Tuesday 25 February 1964 for the first day of the sessions for the \"Hard Day's Night\" soundtrack and the accompanying album. Two takes were recorded. Take 1 was incomplete, but Take 2 was complete. However, the Beatles decided a lighter touch was required. Take 2 was eventually released on \"Anthology 1\" in 1995. This version was missing the middle-eight.\n\nInstrumentation on this session was\n\nThe following day, Wednesday 26 February, a further 17 takes (Takes 3–19) were made in a session lasting from 7:00–10:00pm. Although Starr swapped his drums for bongos and claves halfway through the session, they were still not happy. It was during this session that they stopped for a tea break and to write the middle eight. A brief fragment of Take 11 can be heard in the closing credits of Episode 8 of \"\", where Paul sings \"And if you saw my love, \"I'd\" love her [too]...\" before the take breaks down.\n\nInstrumentation on both this session and Day 3 was\n\nAn additional two takes (Takes 20 and 21) were recorded on the morning of Thursday 27 February, beginning at 10:00am. Take 20 saw the basic track laid down, while Take 21 was an overdub of McCartney's double-tracked lead vocal and Starr's claves.\n\nAll mixes were prepared from Take 21.\n\nThis initial mono mix was made in the Abbey Road Studio One control room on Tuesday 3 March. As for the recording session, Martin and Smith were producer and engineer. The second engineer was A.B. Lincoln.\n\nThe mix features McCartney's single-tracked vocal, with only selected phrases (for example, the title) highlighted by double tracking.\n\nThis mix was sent to Capitol and United Artists on Tuesday 9 June, and released on the US mono version of the \"Hard Day's Night\" soundtrack album on Friday 26 June 1964. The stereo version of the album used a fake stereo version of this mono mix.\n\nThis mix was also used on the mono version of the Capitol album \"Something New\", released on Monday 20 July 1964.\n\nThis mix was also used on the film print of \"A Hard Day's Night\" except the speed was slower in a low pitch.\n\nIt can currently be found as part of the \"Capitol Albums Volume 1\" box set.\n\nThis second mono mix was made in the Abbey Road Studio One control room on Monday 22 June. Martin and Smith were again producer and engineer. The second engineer was Geoff Emerick.\n\nIn this mix, McCartney's vocal is double-tracked throughout, except for the first two lines of the third verse.\n\nThis mix was released on the UK mono version of \"A Hard Day's Night\" on Friday 10 July 1964.\n\nIt can currently be found on \"The Beatles in Mono\" box set.\n\nA stereo mix of \"And I Love Her\" was made on Monday 22 June immediately after Mono Remix 2. As with Mono Remix 2, McCartney's vocal is double-tracked throughout, except for the first two lines of the third verse.\n\nThis mix was released on the UK stereo version of \"A Hard Day's Night\" on Friday 10 July 1964.\n\nThis mix was also used on the stereo version of the Capitol album \"Something New\", released on Monday 20 July 1964.\n\nIt can currently be found on the \"A Hard Day's Night\" CD, and as part of the \"Capitol Albums Volume 1\" box set.\n\nThe German version of \"Something New\" contained an edited version of the 22 June stereo mix, repeating the closing guitar riff six times instead of three. This version also appeared on the American \"Rarities\" album in 1980. It is not known when this edit was made. It has not yet been released on CD.\n\n\nAs with many Beatles songs, this has been covered by many artists of varying style from R&B, crooner, pop, easy listening and even grunge. Notably, Esther Phillips reversed the gender of the song in 1965; her \"And I Love Him\" reached No. 54 that year on the \"Billboard\" charts. Diana Krall also recorded \"And I Love Him\". That adaptation appears on \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\", released in 1998.\n\nAn instrumental cover by Santo & Johnny topped the Mexican charts in 1965. Jazz pianist Brad Mehldau included an extended instrumental trio version on his 2016 album \"Blues and Ballads\", which an AllMusic review describes as \"transfiguring the minor/major-key centers into something sweeping and operatic.\" •. The Seminal Jamaican Band The Wailers Covered the song in 1965, it was recorded at Studio One at the Brentford Road Premises, Bob Marley sang the Lead Vocals with Peter Tosh and Bunny wailer aka (Neville Livingstone) doing Harmonies, it was released on the Coxsone Imprint in Jamaica, and the Ska Beat Label in the UK in 1966 -(JB 230A).\n\nPatty Pravo covered the song on his 1970 album in Italian as La tua voce, text by Don Backy and Mogol.\n\nBobby Womack covered the song on his 1972 album Understanding.\n\nMcCartney has played the song live on various tours. There have been two official releases of live versions, one by McCartney solo on 1991's \"Unplugged (The Official Bootleg)\" and another by the Beatles on \"On Air – Live at the BBC Volume 2\".\n\nAn outtake from the original studio sessions, Take 2 recorded Feb. 25, 1964, was released on the 1995 issue of \"Anthology 1\".\n\nIn 2015, a solo version by Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain was discovered, and subsequently used in his biopic, \"\". It was also released on the soundtrack album \"\" as well as a 7-inch vinyl single.\n\nCobain's chart positions\n"}

In North America, it was released on both the American version of \"A Hard Day's Night\" and the album \"Something New\". Credited to Lennon–McCartney, it was written by John Lennon in either Paris or New York City and recorded in eight takes on 27 February 1964.\n\nPaul McCartney said: \nLennon described the song as resembling \"a black New York girl-group song\". Its basic structure of simple doo-wop chord changes and block harmonies over a walking bass line \"creates an illusion of sincerity through its sheer attack.\"\n\nThe song is in the key of D major. John, Paul, and George sing a three-part harmony. On the chorus, John's lead vocal part sits higher than George's, and more unusual in this case, Paul's harmonies.\n\n\"Tell Me Why\" was performed in the Beatles' debut feature film, \"A Hard Day's Night\". The song was part of the 'studio performance' sequence, which was filmed at the Scala Theatre, London, on 31 March 1964.

{"id": "2253647", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2253647", "title": "Ashover", "text": "Ashover\n\nAshover is a village and civil parish in the English county of Derbyshire. It is in the North East Derbyshire district of the county. The population of the civil parish taken at the 2011 Census was 1,905. It sits in a valley, not far from the town of Matlock and the Peak District national park.\n\nThe centre of the village is a conservation area. The River Amber flows through the village. Although Ashover is a small settlement, the actual ward boundaries of the village extend for many miles, including the nearby settlements of Alicehead, Alton, Ashover Hay, Farhill, Kelstedge, Littlemoor, Milltown, Spitewinter, Stone Edge and Uppertown. The two major roads, running through the parish, are the A632 from Matlock to Chesterfield, and the A615 from Matlock to Alfreton. The area along that part of the A615 is named Doehole. Slack is a small hamlet, within the parish, which is south west of Kelstedge on the A632; nearby to there, on Robridding Road (off Wirestone Lane), is the Eddlestow Lot Picnic Site, which has been developed in the former Wirestone Quarry: it is surrounded by heathland vegetation. The picnic site provides a good base to explore the local Public Rights of Way. Circular walks are waymarked from the car park, a leaflet is available by contacting the County Council. There is public access into many of the adjacent Forestry Commission owned woodlands. The site has plants including heather and bilberry. The other numbered roads in the parish are the B5057 from near North Brittain to Stone Edge, the B6036 between Kelstedge and Dalebank running past Ashover itself, and the B6014 from near Butterley to just past Ashover Hay. Fallgate is a hamlet beside the River Amber, in the south-east corner of the parish, off the B6036 to Woolley Moor and Handley.\n\nKnown in Saxon times as \"Essovre\" (possibly 'beyond the ash trees' or 'ash tree slope'), Ashover was probably in existence during the first taxation survey of England by King Alfred in 893. However, the first written reference to the village occurs in the Domesday Book of 1086, in which Ashover is owned by Ralph fitzHubert and is credited with a church, a priest, several ploughs, a mill. It had previously had a taxable value of four pounds, but it was revalued at thirty shillings.\n\nAshover was the scene of a confrontation between the Royalists and the Roundheads during the English Civil War in the 17th century. The Roundheads, short of ammunition, demolished the windows of the church and used the lead to make bullets. They also reduced nearby Eastwood Hall to ruins; all that can be seen today are the ivy-clad remains. Royalists slaughtered livestock and drank all the wine and ale in the cellars of Eddlestow Hall while the owner Sir John Pershall was away. Job Wall, the landlord of the Crispin Inn public house, refused entry to the army, telling them they had had too much to drink. But they threw him out and drank the ale, pouring what was left down the street. Outside, affixed to the front wall of the pub is a signboard with a history of the inn.\n\nAshover's industrial history is linked with lead mining and quarrying, both of which date back to Roman times. Butt's Quarry is a large disused example, previously excavated by the Clay Cross Company for its works away. During the Second World War, prisoners of war held at Clay Cross were taken daily to the quarry to make concrete blocks. It is now home to a wide range of different species, including jackdaws which nest on the quarry face. Part of the village was home to the stocking frame knitting industry, which once rivalled lead mining in importance. The area is called Rattle, which is believed to be a reference to the noise made by the machinery.\n\nElectricity came to the valley in the 1920s, but the village was not connected to the National Grid until a decade later. Some outlying settlements were not connected until after the Second World War. It was not until 1967 that gas street lights were replaced by electric lighting.\n\nUntil 1963, there was a hydro in the village, sourcing its own private water supply from a tank on a hillside. Ashover had two such institutions, which were popular in the 19th century due to the belief in 'healing water'. Subsequently, purchased by the electricity board, the building is today divided into private apartments, with further expensive new houses built in the grounds.\n\nAshover Golf Club (now defunct) was founded in 1905. The club disappeared in the late 1920s.\n\nTo the east of the village is a gritstone boulder and viewpoint locally known as 'The Fabrick' or 'Ashover Rock'. The Fabrick sits on an area of heathland 299 metres above sea level. It is the highest viewpoint for a considerable distance, and the majority of the landscape east of this point to the coast is lower. Consequently, on a clear day, views can be seen of nearby Chesterfield with its Crooked Spire, Bolsover Castle, Hardwick Hall, some suburbs of the South Yorkshire city of Sheffield, the surrounding counties of Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, Staffordshire.\n\nNext to The Fabrick is a disused Royal Observer Corps monitoring station, which was abandoned in 1991. However, it is opened up occasionally by enthusiasts. For many years, The Fabrick was privately owned by the \"Bassett\" sisters who were descendants of the family known for creating \"Bassetts Liquorice Allsorts\", but in 2006 was donated to Derbyshire County Council. In the Victorian period, there was a stone folly on the top of the Fabrick, no trace of which remains.\n\nOn certain days in the pagan calendar, morris dancers gather.\n\nThe village is known for the Ashover Light Railway, which was owned and operated by the Clay Cross Company from 1925 to 1950. Along with Crich and Matlock, the village was used for a time as a location for the ITV drama series \"Peak Practice\".\nAshover won the Calor Village of the Year competition in 2005.\n\n\n\n"}

It first appeared on the Beatles' \"A Hard Day's Night\" album.\n\nIn his 1980 interview with \"Playboy\", Lennon described the song as \"An effort at writing 'It Won't Be Long'. Same ilk: C to A minor, C to A minor—with me shouting.\"\n\nLennon's handwritten lyrics for \"Any Time at All\" were sold for £6,000 to an unidentified individual at an auction held at Sotheby's in London, on 8 April 1988.\n\nIncomplete when first brought into EMI Studios on Tuesday 2 June 1964, Paul McCartney suggested an idea for the middle eight section based solely on chords, which was recorded with the intention of adding lyrics later. But by the time it was needed to be mixed, the middle eight was still without words and that is how it appears on the LP. McCartney sings the second \"Anytime at all\" in each chorus because Lennon couldn't reach the notes. \"Any Time at All\" reprises a George Martin trick from \"A Hard Day's Night\" by using a piano solo echoed lightly note-for-note on guitar by George Harrison.\n\nIn addition to \"A Hard Day's Night\", \"Any Time at All\" was included on:\n\n\n\n"}

The song was released as a single in the US and later appeared on the album \"Something New\" in the US.\n\nLennon wrote the song for the \"break-out\" sequence in the film. The song was recorded on 1 June 1964 in two sections, A and B, which could then be spliced together at a later date to achieve the required length to fit the film. However, director Richard Lester eventually decided he preferred the livelier \"Can't Buy Me Love\" with its upbeat lyric, and that was used instead. When Walter Shenson re-released the film in 1981, \"I'll Cry Instead\" was included in an opening sequence as a tribute to Lennon, consisting of a \"Swingin'\" early to mid-1960s-style collage of photos of the Beatles in 1964, around the time they were shooting the film.\n\nAlthough the song was not part of the original movie, the label of the American 45 lists the song as being \"From the United Artists Picture, 'A Hard Day's Night'\".\n\n\"I'll Cry Instead\" was described by Cynthia Lennon as a cry for help, saying, \"It reflects the frustration he [John Lennon] felt at that time. He was the idol of millions, but the freedom and fun of the early days had gone.\" John Lennon later said the line \"A chip on my shoulder that's bigger than my feet\" was an accurate indication of his feelings at the time.\n\n\"I'll Cry Instead\" is rooted in country & western, a genre that the Beatles, and especially Ringo Starr, enjoyed playing.\n\n\nThe full version (2:09) was released in the US on the United Artists soundtrack album \"A Hard Day's Night\" UAL-3366 (mono) and UAS-6366 (rechannelled stereo). This same version also appears on the US single and the mono version of Capitol's \"Something New\" T-2108 (mono). This full version appeared on \"The Capitol Albums, Volume 1\", but was not included in the Beatles' remastered albums, making it exclusive to the \"Capitol Albums\" set. According to Mark Lewisohn, this is the only true mono mix.\n\nAn edited short version (1:49—the third verse deleted) appeared in the UK on Parlophone PMC 1230 (mono) & PCS 3058 (stereo) \"A Hard Day's Night\" (album), the British EP \"Extracts from the Album A Hard Day's Night\" Parlophone GEP 8920 (mono) and on the Capitol stereo version of \"Something New\" ST-2018. The stereo was folded down to mono for the mono album release.\n\n\"I'll Cry Instead\" reached No. 25 in the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, and spent seven weeks in the chart, including two in the Top 30.\n\nMost copies of the United Artists album list the title as \"I Cry Instead\" by mistake.\n\n\n\n"}

Trained in theology, he combined his theoretical and practical work in apiculture with his duties as a Roman Catholic priest, before being compulsorily retired by the Church and eventually excommunicated.\n\nHis discoveries and innovations made him world-famous in scientific and bee-keeping circles, and he has been described as the \"father of modern apiculture\".\n\nDzierzon came from Upper Silesia. Born into a family of ethnic Polish background which did not speak German but a Silesian dialect of the Polish language, he has been variously described as having been of Polish, German, or Silesian nationality. Dzierzon himself wrote: \"As for my nationality, I am, as my name indicates, a Pole by birth, as Polish is spoken in Upper Silesia. But as I came to Breslau as a 10-year-old and pursued my studies there, I became German by education. But science knows no borders or nationality.\"\n\nIt was at \"gymnasium\" and at the theological faculty that he became acquainted with German scientific and literary language, which he subsequently used in his scientific writings, rather than his native Polish-Silesian dialect. He used Silesian-Polish in some press publications, in his private life, and in pastoral work, alongside literary Polish.\nDr. Jan Dzierzon considered himself a member of the Polish nation.\n\nDzierzon's manuscripts, letters, diplomas and original copies of his works were given to a Polish museum by his nephew, Franciszek Dzierżoń. Following the 1939 German invasion of Poland, many objects connected with Dzierzon were destroyed by German gendarmes on 1 December 1939 in an effort to conceal his Polish roots. The Nazis made strenuous efforts to enforce a view of Dzierżoń as a German.\n\nDzierzon was born on 16 January 1811 in the village of Lowkowitz (Polish: \"Łowkowice\"), near Kreuzburg (Kluczbork), where his parents owned a farm. He completed Polish elementary school before he was sent to a Protestant school located a mile from his village. In 1822 he moved to Breslau (Wrocław), where he attended middle school (\"gymnasium\"). In 1833 he graduated from the Breslau University Faculty of Catholic Theology. In 1834 he became chaplain in Schalkowitz (Siołkowice). In 1835, as an ordained Roman Catholic priest, he took over a parish in Karlsmarkt (Karłowice), where he lived for 49 years.\n\nIn his apiary, Dzierzon studied the social life of honeybees and constructed several experimental beehives. In 1838 he devised the first practical movable-comb beehive, which allowed manipulation of individual honeycombs without destroying the structure of the hive. The correct distance between combs had been described as 1½ inches from the center of one top bar to the center of the next one. In 1848 Dzierzon introduced grooves into the hive's side walls, replacing the strips of wood for moving top bars. The grooves were 8 × 8 mm—the exact average between ¼ and ⅜ inch, which is the range called the \"bee space.\" His design quickly gained popularity in Europe and North America. On the basis of the aforementioned measurements, (May 1852) in Thuringia and L.L. Langstroth (October 1852) in the United States designed their frame-movable hives.\n\nIn 1835 Dzierzon discovered that drones are produced from unfertilized eggs. Dzierzon's paper, published in 1845, proposed that while queen bees and female worker bees were products of fertilization, drones were not, and that the diets of immature bees contributed to their subsequent roles. His results caused a revolution in bee crossbreeding and may have influenced Gregor Mendel's pioneering genetic research. The theory remained controversial until 1906, the year of Dzierzon's death, when it was finally accepted by scientists at a conference in Marburg. In 1853 he acquired a colony of Italian bees to use as genetic markers in his research, and sent their progeny \"to all the countries of Europe, and even to America.\" In 1854 he discovered the mechanism of secretion of royal jelly and its role in the development of queen bees.\n\nWith his discoveries and innovations, Dzierzon became world-famous in his lifetime. He received some hundred honorary memberships and awards from societies and organizations. In 1872 he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Munich. Other honors included the Austrian Order of Franz Joseph, the Bavarian Merit Order of St. Michael, the Hessian Ludwigsorden, the Russian Order of St. Anna, the Swedish Order of Vasa, the Prussian Order of the Crown, 4th Class, on his 90th birthday, and many more. He was an honorary member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina. He also received an honorary diploma at Graz, presented by Archduke Johann of Austria. In 1903 Dzierzon was presented to Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria. In 1904 he became an honorary member of the \"Schlesische Gesellschaft für vaterländische Kultur\" (\"Silesian Society for Fatherland Culture\").\n\nDzierzon's questioning of papal infallibility caused him to be retired him from the priesthood in 1869. This disagreement, along with his public engagement in local politics, led to his 1873 excommunication. In 1884 he moved back to Lowkowitz, settling in the hamlet \"An der Grenze\", (\"Granice Łowkowskie\"). Of his new home, he wrote:In every direction, one has a broad and pleasant view, and I am pretty happy here, despite the isolation, as I am always close to my beloved bees — which, if one's soul be receptive to the works of the Almighty and the wonders of nature, can transform even a desert into a paradise. From 1873 to 1902 Dzierzon was in contact with the Old Catholic Church, but in April 1905 he was reconciled with the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nHe died in Lowkowitz on 26 October 1906 and is buried in the local graveyard.\n\nJohann Dzierzon is considered the father of modern apiology and apiculture. Most modern beehives derive from his design. Due to language barriers, Dzierzon was unaware of the achievements of his contemporary, L.L. Langstroth, the American \"father of modern beekeeping\", though Langstroth had access to translations of Dzierzon's works. Dzierzon's manuscripts, letters, diplomas and original copies of his works were given to a Polish museum by his nephew, Franciszek Dzierżoń.\n\nIn 1936 the Germans renamed Dzierzon's birthplace, Lowkowitz, \"Bienendorf\" (\"Bee Village\") in recognition of his work with apiculture. At the time, the Nazi government was changing many Slavic-derived place names such as Lowkowitz. After the region came under Polish control following World War II, the village would be renamed \"Łowkowice\".\n\nFollowing the 1939 German invasion of Poland, many objects connected with Dzierzon were destroyed by German gendarmes on 1 December 1939 in an effort to conceal his Polish roots. The Nazis made strenuous efforts to enforce a view of Dzierżoń as a German.\n\nAfter World War II, when the Polish government assigned Polish names to most places in former German territories which had become part of Poland, the Silesian town of \"Reichenbach im Eulengebirge\" (traditionally known in Polish as \"Rychbach\") was renamed \"Dzierżoniów\" in the man's honor.\n\nIn 1962 a Jan Dzierżon Museum of Apiculture was established at Kluczbork. Dzierzon's house in Granice Łowkowskie (now part of Maciejów village) was also turned into a museum chamber, and since 1974 his estates have been used for breeding Krain bees. The museum at Kluczbork houses 5 thousand volumes of works and publications regarding bee keeping, focusing on work by Dzierzon, and presents a permanent exhibition regarding his life presenting pieces from collections from National Ethnographic Museum in Wrocław, and Museum of Silesian Piasts in Brzeg\n\nIn 1966 a Polish-language plate was added to his German-language tombstone.\n\nDzierzon's works include over 800 articles, most published in \"Bienenzeitung\" but also in several other scientific periodicals, and 26 books. They appeared between 1844 and 1904, in German and Polish. The most important include:\n\n\nMagazines published by Dzierzon:\n\nArticles published by Dzierzon since 1844 in \"Frauendörfer Blätter, herausgegeben von der prakt.

She was a member of the United States national team from 1997 to 2000, and competed on the University of California, Los Angeles intercollegiate gymnastics team from 2001 to 2003. She was an alternate for the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games.\n\nBeckerman began training in gymnastics in 1986, when she was five years old.\n\nIn 1996, Beckerman placed twenty-fifth in the all-around junior division at the Coca-Cola National Championships. In 1997, Beckerman became a senior competitor and a member of the United States national team. She competed at the 1997 US Classic and placed ninth in the all-around. She also competed at the 1997 John Hancock US Gymnastics Championships, placing twentieth in the all-around.\n\nIn 1998, Beckerman moved from New Jersey to Ohio to train with coach Mary Lee Tracy at Cincinnati Gymnastics Academy. Tracy trained Beckerman for up to ten hours per day, and kept Beckerman on a restrictive diet of under 1100 calories per day. According to Beckerman, Tracy \"controlled every element, in and out of the gym\" creating a competitive culture of anxiety and silence.\n\nBeckerman was a silver medalist on bars at the 1998 US National Championships and placed second in the all-around at the 1998 Ecoair Gymnastics Cup. Beckerman was third on bars and fourth in the all-around at the 1999 US National Championships. She was third in the all around at the 1999 American Classic and a team silver medalist at the 1999 Pan American Games. She took third in the all-around at the 1999 World Championships trials and was named to the 1999 US World Championships team but was unable to compete due to a broken wrist. Beckerman won the all-around and team competition at the 2000 Spieth Sogipa. She was first on balance beam, second on bars and fifth in the all-around at the 2000 US National Championships. She was named an alternate member of the 2000 US Olympic team, but did not compete because fellow alternate Tasha Schwikert was selected instead to replace injured team member Morgan White.\n\nBy the end of Beckerman's elite career, she had suffered nine broken bones, undergone two surgeries, and developed bleeding ulcers from overuse of anti-inflammatory drugs. During her career, she also suffered from disordered eating. During her elite career, her favorite event was uneven bars.\n\nBeckerman competed on the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) intercollegiate gymnastics team from 2001 to 2003 while pursuing a degree in sociology. In 2001, Beckerman was limited to three competitions due to a wrist injury. She placed second and recorded a score of 9.875 on balance beam at Arizona State, as well as placing fifth on balance beam with a score of 9.8 at the UCLA Invitational. She earned NACGC Scholastic All-America honors that year. During the 2002 season, Beckerman was UCLA's anchor on balance beam, averaging 9.77 over the year and winning individually six times. She was NCAA South Central Regional balance beam champion and Pac-10 balance beam champion, as well as earning a Pac-10 All-Academic honorable mention. On September 11, 2003, at the beginning of her senior year, Beckerman was dismissed from the UCLA team by coach Valorie Kondos Field. Kondos Field claimed that the dismissal was due to Beckerman's performance in training and unenthusiastic attitude, although Beckerman disputed those allegations. Beckerman was stripped of her athletic scholarship and housing, but completed her degree.\n\nAs of 2018, Beckerman owns a music school and works as an emergency medical technician in New Jersey. In a 2018 interview after the USA gymnastics abuse scandal became public, Beckerman expressed that she was \"leaning toward\" favoring the dissolution of USA Gymnastics because \"the structure needs to be changed completely so obedience isn't the desired outcome.\" She said:\"When [a coach] has so much control, it puts a young person in a mindset that the coach has more authority than anyone else in their life - that they should put all their faith in them...There's a fine line between...where the culture is healthy, to a culture of silence...[In elite gymnastics, gymnasts] were not allowed to speak...That does a lot to you, psychologically. You try to be as meek and as serious as possible. 'Stoic' was this huge compliment at [national training] camp. We all strived for that. Being someone who never complained was a compliment. So, you don't speak out, because it's ingrained in you that if you do, you have poor integrity, that you're a bad gymnast, a bad teammate. Asking questions [in elite gymnastics] is very taboo.\"\n\nBeckerman was born in Long Branch, New Jersey to Howard and Melanie Beckerman. She has two brothers and is the middle sibling.

Although credited to Lennon–McCartney, it was primarily a John Lennon composition, with Paul McCartney assisting with the lyrics and arrangement.\n\nJohn Lennon claimed this song in 1971 and 1980. In about 1995 Paul McCartney described the song as dominated by John, but written in collaboration. “John mainly sang it so I expect that it was his original idea but we both sat down and wrote it together.\" The chorus is a play on the words \"be long\" and \"belong\". The song features early Beatles trademarks such as call-and-response yeah-yeahs and scaling guitar riffs. Typical also of this phase of Beatles songwriting is the melodramatic ending (similar to \"She Loves You\", which had just been recorded and was about to be released) where the music stops, allowing Lennon a brief solo vocal improvisation before the song finishes on a \"barber shop\" major seventh (\"She Loves You\" ends on a major sixth). The middle eight uses chromatically descending chords over which Lennon, McCartney and Harrison sing in counterpoint.\n\nJohn Lennon, in his last interview, told \"Playboy\" magazine that the song was the beginning of a wider audience for Beatles music than the youthful throngs that had fervently followed them from their Liverpool clubbing days. \"It was only after a critic for the \"[London] Times\" said we put 'Aeolian cadences' in 'It Won't Be Long' that the middle classes started listening to us. ... To this day, I have no idea what 'Aeolian cadences' are. They sound like exotic birds.\" In fact, the critic, William Mann, had written this about the song \"Not a Second Time.\" \"Rolling Stone\" stated that \"It Won't Be Long\" was \"the kind of song Bob Dylan had in mind when he wrote that Beatles chords were 'outrageous, just outrageous.'\" With its composers not being versed in musical theory, the song incorporates chords it \"shouldn't\", being in the key of E but veering off into D, C and F#, and \"a hybrid of D and Bm\".\n\nThe Beatles recorded this song on 30 July 1963 in two sessions. The first session was in the morning, where they recorded 10 takes. The second session was in the afternoon, where they recorded seven takes, misnumbered as takes 17–23. The final product was a combination of takes 17 and 21, put together on 21 August.\n\nThe original release in the UK was on \"With the Beatles\", 22 November 1963. In the US, \"It Won't Be Long\" first appeared on \"Meet the Beatles!\", released 20 January 1964.\n\nThe song was never performed live or at any of the group's BBC sessions, although they did lip-synch to the track on an edition of \"Ready Steady Go!\" in March 1964.\n\n\n\n"}

In the United States, \"All I've Got to Do\" originally appeared on \"Meet the Beatles!\" (1964). According to Dennis Alstrand, the song is the first time in rock and roll or rock music where the bass player plays chords as a vital part of the song.\n\nLennon said he was \"trying to do Smokey Robinson again,\" and Ian MacDonald compared it to \"You Can Depend on Me\" by the Miracles, both musically and lyrically. Richie Unterberger of Allmusic said it sounds like Robinson but also Arthur Alexander. Beatles biographer Bob Spitz said the song is \"restlessly dark and moody\", and compared it to the Shirelles' \"Baby It's You\" (a song the Beatles previously covered) and early Drifters recordings.\n\nIt was one of three songs Lennon was the principal writer for on \"With the Beatles\", with \"It Won't Be Long\" and \"Not a Second Time\". Lennon said that it was written specifically for the American market; the idea of calling a girl on the telephone was unthinkable to a British youth in the early 1960s. For instance, Lennon said in an interview regarding \"No Reply\": \"I had the image of walking down the street and seeing her silhouetted in the window and not answering the 'phone, although I have never called a girl on the 'phone in my life! Because 'phones weren't part of the English child's life.\"\n\nThe band recorded the song in a single recording session on 11 September 1963 in 14 takes with one overdub, take 15. The master take was take 15. It was mixed for mono on 30 September and for stereo on 29 October.\n\nAlthough music journalist Steve Turner claims the song was written in 1961, MacDonald said the song was never in the Beatles' live repertoire, and that explains why 8 of the 14 takes were incomplete: the band was unfamiliar with the song.\n\nIn the UK, \"All I've Got to Do\" was released on \"With the Beatles\" which also includes the Beatles' cover of \"You Really Got a Hold on Me\" by the Miracles, the most direct connection between the album and Robinson's music. In the US, Capitol Records pulled \"You've Really Got a Hold on Me\" off \"Meet the Beatles!\", releasing it later on \"The Beatles' Second Album\".\n\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1512 as an autonomous theological college of the University of St Andrews, it merged with St Salvator's College in 1747 to form the United College. In 1972 it was re-instituted as a postgraduate institute.\n\nSt Leonard's College of the University of St Andrews was founded as 'The College of Poor Clerks of the Church of St Andrews' in 1512 by Alexander Stewart, Archbishop of St Andrews and John Hepburn, Prior of St Andrews (receiving Papal recognition by proxy in 1545), on the site of St Leonard's Hospital and Church. Its creation was a result of the poverty and declining status of St John's College/Pedagogy and Arts Faculty of St Andrews.\n\nThe first Provost was the Dominican, John Annand (a pupil of Jan Standonck) and a determined reformer of the clergy. St Leonard's was consequently extremely monastic in nature, with members of the college being subjected to a far more rigorous and formal code of conduct than was in practice at St Salvator's.\n\nBecause of financial considerations and the general decline of the university, St Salvator's and St Leonard's Colleges were amalgamated to form the United College of St Salvator and St Leonard in 1747. The buildings of St Leonard's College on South Street were sold and teaching limited to the St Salvator's College site on North Street.\n\nThe old college site was visited by Samuel Johnston and James Boswell in August 1773. The old college site has, since the late 19th century, been occupied by St Leonards School. The college chapel remains the property of the university.\n\nFamous alumni of St Leonard's College include Alexander Ales (Alesius), John Knox, George Buchanan, Patrick Adamson and James Melville.\n\nSt Leonard's College was re-established in 1972 as a non-statutory college exclusively for postgraduates, postdoctoral fellows and research staff.

{"id": "2253707", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2253707", "title": "All My Loving", "text": "All My Loving\n\n\"All My Loving\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles, from their second UK album \"With the Beatles\" (1963). It was written by Paul McCartney (credited to Lennon–McCartney), and produced by George Martin. Though not officially released as a single in the United Kingdom or the United States, the song drew considerable radio airplay, prompting EMI to issue it as the title track of an EP. The song was released as a single in Canada, where it became a number one hit. The Canadian single was imported into the US in enough quantities to peak at number 45 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in April 1964.\n\nAccording to journalist Bill Harry, McCartney thought of the lyrics whilst shaving: \"I wrote 'All My Loving' like a piece of poetry and then, I think, I put a song to it later\". However, McCartney later told biographer Barry Miles that he wrote the lyrics while on a tour bus and after arriving at the venue he then wrote the music on a piano backstage. He also said \"It was the first song [where] I'd ever written the words first. I never wrote words first, it was always some kind of accompaniment. I've hardly ever done it since either.\"\n\nThe lyrics follow the \"letter song\" model as used on \"P.S. I Love You\", the B-side of their first single. McCartney originally envisioned it as a country & western song, and George Harrison added a Nashville-style guitar solo. John Lennon's rhythm guitar playing uses quickly strummed triplets similar to \"Da Doo Ron Ron\" by The Crystals, a song that was popular at the time, and McCartney plays a walking bass line.\n\nLennon expressed his esteem for the song in his 1980 \"Playboy\" interview, saying, \"[I]t's a damn good piece of work... But I play a pretty mean guitar in back.\"\n\nIt has been hypothesized that the piece draws inspiration from the Dave Brubeck Quartet's 1959 song \"Kathy's Waltz\".\n\nThe Beatles recorded the song on 30 July 1963 in eleven takes with three overdubs. The master take was take fourteen overdubbed on take eleven. It was remixed on 21 August (mono) and 29 October (stereo).\n\nA slightly longer stereo edition of the song, featuring a hi-hat percussion introduction not found on the common stereo or mono mixes was released in Germany and the Netherlands in 1965 on a compilation album entitled \"Beatles' Greatest\". This version was later released in the UK, but only as part of \"The Beatles Box\" (1980). It also turned up on a European CD bootleg release of the US \"Rarities\" with other bonus tracks not included on the original LP.\n\n\n\"All My Loving\" was the Beatles' opening number on their debut performance on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" on 9 February 1964; the recording was included on \"Anthology 1\" (1995). The group also performed \"All My Loving\" three times for BBC radio, once in 1963 and twice in 1964. The final version, which was recorded on 28 February 1964, was included on \"Live at the BBC\".\n\nThe song was used twice in films by the group—it plays in the background at the end of the nightclub scene in \"A Hard Day's Night\" (1964), though without the drum opening and the coda; while an instrumental version appears in the film \"Magical Mystery Tour\" (1967).\n\nAccording to Alan Weiss, a TV producer who happened to be there, \"All My Loving\" was playing on the sound system at Roosevelt Hospital emergency room when Lennon was pronounced dead after being shot on 8 December 1980.\n\n\"All My Loving\" has been praised by several critics. Ian MacDonald said, \"The innocence of early Sixties British pop is perfectly distilled in the eloquent simplicity of this number\" and described the song as helping McCartney be seen as more of an equal to Lennon. Richie Unterberger of AllMusic said it \"was arguably the best LP-only track the Beatles did before 1964\" and that if it had been released as a single in America it would have been a huge hit.\n\nThe guitar work for \"All My Loving\" has also been lauded by later critics. Harrison's concise solo has been described as reminiscent of Chet Atkins, and Lennon's complex rhythm work (relying on the unusual use of constant triplets) was referred to as \"the most recognizable feature\" of the song; Lennon himself later described his performance as \"a superb piece of guitar.\"\n\nPersonnel per Ian MacDonald:\n\n"}

The pass is named for the nearby Red Mountain on the northeast side of the pass. The name is derived from the iron oxide laden rock that forms their slopes. \n\nThe pass separates the Uncompahgre and Las Animas River watersheds, and also serves as a dividing point between the Uncompahgre and San Juan National Forests. The pass is traversed by the Million Dollar Highway, U.S. Highway 550 between Ouray and Silverton, which is part of the San Juan Skyway Scenic Byway.\n\nThe pass is known for being treacherous in the wintertime due to the steep 8% grade and switchbacks on the north side facing Ouray, though the entire road is paved. Avalanches are frequent, and can block the highway for some time. The lower part of the pass towards Ouray is blasted into near-vertical cliffs of quartzite hundreds of feet above Red Mountain Creek and the Uncompahgre River. This section of road is winding, narrow and has no shoulder.\n\nThe Red Mountain Mining District lies from the divide northward to Ironton Park, halfway down towards Ouray. It was the site of a historic silver boom from 1882 until 1893, including the Yankee Girl, National Belle and Guston mines and the towns of Red Mountain and Ironton. Head frames of the old workings are still visible from the highway. The Idarado Mine (Treasury Tunnel) continued until the 1970s, and reclamation of tailings is ongoing. \n"}
{"id": "2253717", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2253717", "title": "Don't Bother Me", "text": "Don't Bother Me\n\n\"Don't Bother Me\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1963 UK album \"With the Beatles\". It was the first song written by George Harrison, the group's lead guitarist, to appear on one of their albums. An uptempo rock and roll song, it was originally released in the United States on the 1964 album \"Meet the Beatles!\"\n\nIn 2018, the music staff of \"Time Out London\" ranked \"Don't Bother Me\" at number 47 on their list of the best Beatles songs.\n\nHarrison wrote the song while ill in bed at a hotel room in Bournemouth, England, where the Beatles were playing some shows during the summer of 1963. He considered it an exercise in whether he could write a song, later saying, \"at least it showed me that all I needed to do was keep on writing, and then maybe eventually I would write something good.\" Harrison received a writing credit for two earlier songs, \"In Spite of All the Danger\" (McCartney/Harrison) and \"Cry for a Shadow\" (Harrison/Lennon). Both were recorded by The Beatles but neither was released officially by the band until 1995's \"Anthology 1\" compilation. Because the former was largely a McCartney composition (Harrison received a credit simply for playing the guitar solo) and the latter was an instrumental pastiche of the Shadows, \"Don't Bother Me\" is considered Harrison's first song by most (including the composer himself). Harrison did not think highly of the song, not mentioning it in an otherwise comprehensive overview of his Beatles compositions in his autobiography \"I, Me, Mine\". The Beatles never performed it live or at any of their BBC sessions. The song is about a man who is depressed because his girlfriend has left him; and, as a result, he does not want to associate with others.\n\nAfter \"Don't Bother Me\", it was not until 1965's \"Help!\" album that any more Harrison-penned songs (“I Need You” and \"You Like Me Too Much\") would appear on record. \"You Know What to Do\" was recorded in 1964, but was not released at the time.\n\nThe sullen mood and desolate lyrics—\"So go away, leave me alone, don't bother me\"—were unusual for the Beatles at the time but would become characteristic for Harrison. The song mostly stays in a minor key (Em), with a i-IV-i Dorian alternation during the chorus: the Em of \"since she's been gone\" shifting to a v (Bm chord) on \"gone\" then an iv (Am chord) on \"no-one\" makes the verse an Aeolian (or natural minor) mode. The chords of the chorus (Em-A-Em) also create the Dorian progression i-IV-i. The song achieves a thick sound through its double-tracked vocal, reverbed guitars, and busy drumming. The elaborate percussion lends the song a Latin rhythm accentuated by its stop-time structure.\n\nOn some late-1970s Canadian stereo pressings of \"Meet the Beatles!\", an alternate version of the song with an extra ‘don't’ sung at 2:08 is included in place of the standard stereo version.\n\nThey recorded the song on 11 and 12 September 1963. They were not satisfied with the version recorded on the eleventh which was recorded in seven takes and did a remake on the twelfth in nine takes from 10–19. Just a few days after the recording was completed, Harrison became the first member of the Beatles to travel to the US when he visited his sister in Benton, Illinois.\n\n\"Don't Bother Me\" is one of several songs featured in \"A Hard Day's Night\", during a scene where the Beatles dance at a nightclub while McCartney's grandfather gambles elsewhere. At the end of the film, it is erroneously noted as a Lennon–McCartney composition rather than a Harrison composition.\n\nThe song is performed in the 1979 biopic motion picture \"Birth of the Beatles\", showing it was performed in Hamburg but this was not the case.\n\nBritish actor Gregory Phillips released a version of \"Don't Bother Me\" as his third single. Though unsuccessful, this was the first cover version of a Harrison composition.\n\nArgentinian musician Luis Alberto Spinetta released a version of \"Don't Bother Me\" on his live album \"Obras En Vivo\" (2002).\n\nBritish singer/songwriter Kamila Thompson released a version of \"Don't Bother Me\" as the last track on her debut album \"Love Lies\" (2011).\n\n\n"}

It was written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney for Ringo Starr, but Starr was instead given \"I Wanna Be Your Man\" as his album song.\n\nMcCartney describes \"Little Child\" as being a \"work song\", or an \"album filler\". He admits to taking the melody of the line \"I'm so sad and lonely\" from the song \"Whistle My Love\" by British balladeer and actor Elton Hayes. The phrase \"sad and lonely\" also appears in the Lennon-McCartney number \"Bad To Me\" originally recorded by Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas as well as \"Act Naturally\", which the Beatles covered (with Starr singing) for the album \"Help!\".\n\nThe song was recorded in three different sessions, with the first on 11 September 1963, where the Beatles recorded two takes. They later came back to it the next day, where they recorded 16 takes, including overdubs of piano from McCartney, and harmonica from Lennon which he plays nonstop throughout the song. They later returned to it on 3 October, where they recorded three more takes. In the stereo mix, the harmonica pans from left to right for the solo. Then it pans back from right to left after the solo. The song's solo follows a \"twelve-bar blues format that does not appear in the rest of the [song].\"\n\nMusic critic Richie Unterberger of Allmusic said of the song: \"It might have been one of the less sophisticated and impressive tracks on the record, but it was still pretty good\", and \"'Little Child' might not be a work of genius, but it's sheer rock 'n' roll fun\".\n\n\nMacDonald said that the vocals were \"credited to Lennon and McCartney, but more like the former double-tracked\", though it is possible that McCartney sings a lower harmony to Lennon's lead during the verses, plus McCartney can be heard at the end singing \"oh yeah\" on his own, so the original credit is probably correct.\n\nWreckless Eric covered the song with James Nicholls for Mojo's CD \"We're With The Beatles\" in 2013.\nThe song was also covered by the fictional band, Snow Pink, on a 1982 episode of CHiPs, titled Battle Of The Bands.\n"}

It is sung by librarian Marian Paroo (performed by Barbara Cook on Broadway, and by Shirley Jones in the film) to \"Professor\" Harold Hill (portrayed on Broadway and in the film by Robert Preston) toward the end of Act Two.\n\nIn 1959, the song became the first of four US Top 40 hits for Anita Bryant. \"Till There Was You\" was covered by the Beatles in 1963.\n\nThe first recording of the song to be released was produced by Nelson Riddle, featuring his orchestra and 17-year-old vocalist Sue Raney. Promotional copies of the 45 rpm single, Capitol P3847, were released on November 26, 1957, even before the Broadway production had premiered on December 19, 1957, and a month ahead of the original cast album. \n\nAn earlier version of this song, \"Till I Met You\", was first recorded by Eileen Wilson in 1950 and later appeared on the January 14, 1951 edition of \"The Big Show\", performed by Fran Warren.\n\nIn 1959, American singer Anita Bryant recorded the song \"Till There Was You\" and released it as a single. Her version reached number 30 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart and number 14 on the \"Cashbox\" Top 100.\n\n\"Till There Was You\" was recorded by the Beatles in 1963 and released on their second album \"With the Beatles\" (1963) (United Kingdom) and \"Meet the Beatles!\" (1964) (United States). It was the only song from a Broadway show released by the band.\n\nThe Beatles' version is sung by Paul McCartney, who is accompanied by George Harrison and John Lennon on dueling acoustic, classical guitars played in a Spanish style over a bossa nova bongo beat played by Ringo Starr. The song was produced by George Martin. Its guitar solo is by George Harrison.\nThe widow of Meredith Willson, the composer of \"The Music Man\", has stated that her husband's estate eventually received more income from the royalties of the Beatles recordings of \"Till There Was You\", than it originally received from the actual play. \n\nPaul McCartney was introduced to Peggy Lee's cover of the song through his older cousin Bett Robbins, who would occasionally babysit the two McCartney brothers. McCartney said that he \"had no idea until much later\" that it was from \"The Music Man\". The song was part of their pre-recording repertoire in 1962, and they performed it at the Star Club in Hamburg. It became illustrative of the Beatles' versatility, proving that they could appeal to all sections of an audience, moving easily from softer ballads to harder rock and roll, as in their appearance on November 4, 1963 at the Royal Variety Performance when they followed this song with \"Twist and Shout\".\n\nThe band had included \"'Till There Was You\" as part of their unsuccessful audition for Decca Records in London on January 1, 1962. It was the second of five songs that they performed during their first appearance on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" on February 9, 1964.\n\nLive versions of the song were released on \"Live at the BBC\" (1994) and \"Anthology 1\" (1995). \nA live performance by McCartney appears on his DVD \"The Space Within US\" (2006). In 2016, the BBC announced that a \"holy grail\" Beatles record would be auctioned in March of that year, a private pressing which features \"Hello Little Girl\" and \"Till There Was You\" and was valued at over £10,000. It was said to be one of the \"rarest and most collectable of all Beatles records\" by Mark Lewisohn, one of the foremost authorities on the Beatles. The disc eventually sold for £77,500.\n\n\n"}

It is the debut single by the Marvelettes for the Tamla (Motown) label, notable as the first Motown song to reach the number-one position on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 pop singles chart. The single achieved this position in late 1961; it hit number one on the R&B chart as well. \"Please Mr. Postman\" became a number-one hit again in early 1975 when the Carpenters' cover of the song reached the top position of the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. \"Please Mr. Postman\" has been covered several times, including by the British rock group The Beatles in 1963.\n\nIn April 1961, the Marvelettes (then known as \"The Marvels\") arranged an audition for Berry Gordy's Tamla label. Marvels original lead singer Georgia Dobbins needed an original song for their audition, and got a blues song from her friend William Garrett, which she then reworked for the group. Dobbins left the group after the audition and was replaced, Gordy renamed the group and hired \"Brianbert\"—Brian Holland and Robert Bateman's songwriting partnership—to rework the song yet again. Freddie Gorman, himself a Detroit postman and another songwriting partner of Holland (before Holland became part of the Holland–Dozier–Holland team) was also involved in the final reworking.\n\nThe Marvelettes recording features lead singer Gladys Horton hoping that the postman has brought her a letter from her boyfriend. Accompaniment is provided by the Funk Brothers, including Marvin Gaye on drums. The Marvelettes' version later appeared in a bar fight scene in the film \"Mean Streets\" (1973), directed by Martin Scorsese.\n\nSongwriting credits for \"Please Mr. Postman\" seem to have changed over the years. The original Tamla 45 single for the Marvelettes' version credits \"Dobbins/Garett/Brianbert\" as the songwriters, and credits \"Brianbert\" as producer. The original \"With the Beatles\" album cover credited it to just Brian Holland (the 1987 CD release credits it to \"Dobbin-Garrett-Garman-Brianbert\"). The 1976 Beatles discography book \"All Together Now\" credits the songwriting to Holland, Bateman, and Berry Gordy. The 1992 Motown boxed set \"Hitsville USA: The Motown Singles Collection\" credits Dobbins, Garrett, Holland, Bateman, and Gorman as the composers.

Sung by John Lennon, their version reverses the genders. The song was produced by George Martin.\n\nThe Beatles included \"Please Mr. Postman\" as part of their live act in 1962, performing it regularly at the Cavern Club. They also performed the song three separate times during live performances on the BBC. By the time it was recorded for their second album, \"With the Beatles\", it had been dropped from their set, and required some work in the studio to bring it up to an acceptable standard. Ian MacDonald criticised their version for having a \"wall of sound\" and for a \"general airlessness.\" It was released by Capitol in Canada with \"Roll Over Beethoven\" as the A-side. This release reached number 68 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and number 30 on the \"Cash Box\" Singles chart. In Sweden, it peaked at number 11 on the Kvällstoppen Chart.\n\n\nA hit cover of \"Please Mr. Postman\" was recorded by the Carpenters, whose version took the song again to number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart in early 1975. The Carpenters' version resembles an old 1950s rock & roll song. The single was released in late 1974, reached number one on both the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and Easy Listening charts in January 1975, and was the duo's 10th and final million-selling single.

{"id": "2253753", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2253753", "title": "Roll Over Beethoven", "text": "Roll Over Beethoven\n\n\"Roll Over Beethoven\" is a 1956 hit single written by Chuck Berry, originally released on Chess Records, with \"Drifting Heart\" as the B-side. The lyrics of the song mention rock and roll and the desire for rhythm and blues to replace classical music. The title of the song is an imperative directed at the composer Ludwig van Beethoven to roll over in his grave in reaction to the new genre of music that Berry was promoting. The song has been covered by many other artists, including the Beatles and the Electric Light Orchestra. \"Rolling Stone\" magazine ranked it number 97 on its list of the \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\".\n\nAccording to \"Rolling Stone\" and Cub Koda of AllMusic, Berry wrote the song in response to his sister Lucy always using the family piano to play classical music when Berry wanted to play popular music. It was, as biographer Bruce Pegg says, \"inspired in part by the rivalry between his sister Lucy's classical music training and Berry's own self-taught, rough-and-ready music preference\". The lyric \"roll over Beethoven and tell Tchaikovsky the news\" refers to how classical composers would roll over in their graves upon hearing that classical music had given way to rock and roll.\n\nIn addition to the classical composers Ludwig van Beethoven and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, the lyrics mention or allude to several popular artists: \"Early in the Mornin'\" is the title of a Louis Jordan song; \"Blue Suede Shoes\" refers to the Carl Perkins song; and \"hey diddle diddle\", from the nursery rhyme \"The Cat and the Fiddle\", is an indirect reference to the Chess recording artist Bo Diddley, who was an accomplished violin player. Although the lyrics mention \"rocking\" and \"rolling\", the music that the classics are supposed to step aside for is referred to as \"rhythm and blues\". The lyric \"a shot of rhythm and blues\" was appropriated as the title of a song recorded by Arthur Alexander and others.\n\nThe song was recorded on April 16, 1956 in Chicago, Illinois.\nThe session was produced by the Chess brothers, Leonard and Phil. The song was released as Chess single 1626.\n\nBerry's version was originally released as a single by Chess Records in May 1956, with \"Drifting Heart\" as the B-side.\nIt peaked at number two on the \"Billboard \"R&B chart and number 29 on the pop chart. \"Roll Over Beethoven\" and three other Berry songs were included on the album \"Rock, Rock, Rock\", promoted as the soundtrack of the film of the same name, but only four of the 12 songs on the album were used in the film.\n\n\"Roll Over Beethoven\" has been released numerous times on compilation albums, including \"Chuck Berry Twist\" and \"The Chess Box\".\n\nBerry's single was one of 50 recordings chosen in 2003 by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry. In 2004, \"Roll Over Beethoven\" was ranked number 97 on \"Rolling Stone\"s list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\". The accompanying review stated that it \"became the ultimate rock & roll call to arms, declaring a new era\".\n\nThe opening guitar solo sounds similar to Berry's most famous hit, \"Johnny B. Goode\". The sheet music for the two songs is very similar. Koda calls it a \"masterpiece\" that helped to define rock and roll.\n\n\"Roll Over Beethoven\" is one of the most widely covered songs in popular music – \"a staple of rock and roll bands\", according to Koda – with notable versions by Jerry Lee Lewis, the Beatles, and Electric Light Orchestra.\n\n\"Roll Over Beethoven\" was a favourite of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and George Harrison even before they chose \"the Beatles\" as their name, and they continued to perform it right into their American tours of 1964. Their version of \"Roll Over Beethoven\" was recorded on July 30, 1963, for their second British LP, \"With the Beatles\", and features Harrison on vocals and guitar. In the United States, it was released April 10, 1964, as the opening track of \"The Beatles' Second Album\". and May 11, 1964, as the opening track of the second Capitol EP, \"Four by the Beatles\". It was released by Capitol in Canada with \"Please Mister Postman\" as the B-side. This release reached number 68 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and number 30 on the \"Cash Box\" Singles chart. In Sweden, it peaked at number 11 on the Kvällstoppen Chart.\n\nIn 1994, the Beatles released a live version of \"Roll Over Beethoven\" on \"Live at the BBC\". This version had been recorded on February 28, 1964, and broadcast on March 30, 1964, as part of a BBC series starring the Beatles called \"From Us to You\". This version of \"Roll Over Beethoven\" was used in the film \"Superman III\", directed by Richard Lester, who also directed the Beatles' first two films, \"A Hard Day's Night\" and \"Help!\". The following year, a live version from an October 1963 performance at the Karlaplansstudion in Stockholm was released on \"Anthology 1\".\n\nThe Rutles' song \"Blue Suede Schubert\" is a nod to The Beatles' cover of this song.\n\n\nElectric Light Orchestra's (ELO) elaborate eight-minute reworking of \"Roll Over Beethoven\", on the album \"ELO 2\" in 1973, included an opening musical quote from Beethoven's Fifth Symphony and clever interpolations of material from the symphony's first movement into Berry's song. This became one of ELO's signature songs and has been used to close the majority of their concerts. \"Roll Over Beethoven\" was the second single released by the band, in January 1973, and became their second consecutive top ten hit in the UK. An edited version of the track from \"ELO 2\" was a #42 hit in the United States.\n\nChicago radio superstation WLS, which gave the song much airplay, ranked \"Roll Over Beethoven\" as the 89th most popular hit of 1973.\nIt reached as high as number 8 (for two weeks) on their surveys of September 1 and 8, 1973. The song reached number six on the competing station WCFL.\n\nIron Maiden recorded \"Roll Over Vic Vella\", an adaptation of the Berry song, with new lyrics (written by Steve Harris) about Vella, the band's longtime tour manager. It was released as the B-side of their single \"From Here to Eternity\".\n\nNarvel Felts covered the song in 1982. His version went to number 64 on the Hot Country Singles chart in 1982.\n\nIn 1961, the Flairs (not to be confused with the doo-wop group) recorded a version unsuccessfully. Later that year, they changed their name to the Velaires and signed with Jamie Records, and released it again. It quickly reached number one in Los Angeles. They had also been given the opportunity to perform it on the television program \"American Bandstand\".\n\nA 1964 version by Pat Wayne and the Beachcombers is noteworthy because of the involvement of the guitarist Jimmy Page, later of The Yardbirds and Led Zeppelin. It was re-released in 1989 as part of the compilation \"\".\n\nIn 1992 Paul Shaffer and The World's Most Dangerous Band recorded a version of the song as the main theme for the feature film \"Beethoven\".\n\n"}

It was first recorded during the \"Please Please Me\" album session, but not selected for inclusion and re-recorded for their second album.\n\n\"Hold Me Tight\" was composed principally by Paul McCartney in 1961, and was part of the Beatles' stage act until 1963. They attempted to record it for their debut \"Please Please Me\" but the 13 takes recorded were deemed unsatisfactory, and the tape was destroyed. Seven months later, they recorded a further nine takes, and the final version is an edit of the sixth and ninth takes from the second attempt, varispeeded up a semitone to F major.\n\nBoth McCartney and John Lennon, at one time or another, shared their low opinion of the song. In a 1980s interview with Mark Lewisohn, McCartney says, \"I can't remember much about that one. Certain songs were just 'work' songs, you haven't got much memory of them. That's one of them.\" In Barry Miles' \"Paul McCartney: Many Years from Now\", the songwriter calls it \"a failed attempt at a single which then became an acceptable album filler\". Lennon in 1980 said \"That was Paul's ... It was a pretty poor song and I was never really interested in it.\"\n\n\"Hold Me Tight\" has similarly been held in low regard by music critics. In their book \"\", Roy Carr and Tony Tyler call it the album's poorest track, saying it \"fails because McCartney's vision of the complete tune obviously sagged somewhat\". They also claim that McCartney's singing was \"out of tune\". Ian MacDonald, in his book \"Revolution in the Head\", says that the song's bad reputation in partly undeserved, adding: \"Play it loud with the bass boosted, and you have an overwhelming motoric rocker strongly redolent of the band's live sound.\" Writing for \"Rolling Stone\", Rob Sheffield describes \"Hold Me Tight\" as \"horrifying\" and says that it saves the band's cover of \"Till There Was You\", also released on \"With the Beatles\", from being their \"all-time ghastliest moment\".<ref name=\"Sheffield/RSAlbumGuide\"></ref>\n\nMcCartney wrote a different song called \"Hold Me Tight\" for a medley included on the 1973 Wings album \"Red Rose Speedway\".\n\n\nAt least four cover versions of this song have been recorded. The Treasures, a Phil Spector-produced vocal group, recorded the song in 1963, as a single (Shirley 500) released on Spector's Philles Records. British band Stackridge included a cover version on their 1976 album, \"Mr. Mick\". Another cover version was featured near the beginning of the 2007 Beatles-themed film, \"Across the Universe\" with vocals by Evan Rachel Wood; an American independent band, The Northern Crowns, recorded a version on their EP. Les Baronets, a Yé-yé band who was known for performing French versions of songs from the band, scored their biggest hit with a French version of this song called \"C'est fou mais c'est tout\". The band featured René Angélil, who later became Celine Dion's manager and husband. Furthermore, Al Stewart mentions the song in the title song of his album \"Modern Times\".\n\n\n"}

One of the Miracles' most covered tunes, this million-selling song received a 1998 Grammy Hall of Fame Award. It has also been selected as one of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. It was covered by English rock group the Beatles on their second album, \"With the Beatles\". Many other musicians also recorded versions.\n\n\"You've Really Got a Hold On Me\" was written by Smokey Robinson while in New York in 1962 on business for Motown; he heard Sam Cooke's \"Bring It On Home to Me\", which was in the charts at the time, and — influenced by it — wrote the song in his hotel room.\n\nThe song was recorded in Motown's Studio A on October 16, 1962 with Robinson on lead vocals, and Miracles' second tenor Bobby Rogers on harmony co-lead. Robinson was the producer, and he had Eddie Willis and Miracle Marv Tarplin share the guitar parts.\n\nThe song was released on the Tamla label on November 9, 1962 as the B side to \"Happy Landing\". \"Happy Landing\" charted regionally; however, the nation's Dee-Jays flipped the record over, because they liked \"Hold On Me\" better. With \"You've Really Got a Hold on Me\" as the A side, the single reached the Top 10 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 Pop chart, peaking at number eight, and was a number one smash on the Billboard R&B singles chart during the winter of 1962-63. The Miracles' original version is a 1998 Grammy Hall of Fame inductee. It was also the group's second single to sell over a million copies, after \"Shop Around\". It was included on the album \"The Fabulous Miracles\" over three months after its release.\n\nThe Miracles can be seen performing the song live on stage at the Apollo Theatre in New York (1963) on the Motown/Universal DVD release: \"Smokey Robinson & The Miracles: The Definitive Performances 1963-1987\". This filmed performance, according to the DVD's liner notes, is the only known recorded live footage of the group with original Miracles member Claudette (Mrs. Smokey) Robinson. They also performed it live at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium the following year (1964) for the American International Pictures concert film, \"T.A.M.I. Show\". It was also chosen for the soundtrack of the award-winning 1964 Ivan Dixon film, \"Nothing But a Man\", and many others (see below). Smokey Robinson himself also performed a rewritten version of it on \"Sesame Street\" - alongside a graspy, feminine-looking Muppet letter \"U\", who wouldn't stop trying to grab Smokey - with lyrics such as \"U stands for uptight/That's how I'm feelin'/Bein' grabbed by a letter is/Unappealin'\". The Miracles performed the song on a 1964 telecast of the ABC television series \"Shindig!\", and in 1983, the group also performed it, 21 years after they originally recorded it, on the Emmy-winning NBC Television special, \"\".\n\nReference: IMDb\n\nThe Miracles\n\n\"You Really Got a Hold on Me\" was the first track recorded for the Beatles' second United Kingdom LP, \"With the Beatles\" and was included on their third US album, \"The Beatles' Second Album\", and features John Lennon and George Harrison on lead vocals with Paul McCartney on harmony vocals. The Beatles acquired an imported copy by the Miracles and included it in their repertoire early in 1963. In a 1968 interview, Smokey Robinson reported that he liked their cover.\n\nThe Beatles recorded the song on July 18, 1963. This session took place while \"Please Please Me\" was still at number one in the album charts four months after its release, and in the midst of a rigorous touring schedule that also had to include BBC sessions for radio and television. It was completed in seven takes, four of which were complete. The group then recorded four edit pieces. The final version was an edit of takes 7, 10 and 11.\n\nThe Beatles also recorded \"You Really Got a Hold on Me\" on four occasions for BBC radio in 1963. One of these, from July 30, 1963 was included on the \"Live at the BBC\" collection. A live version recorded in Stockholm, Sweden in October 1963 was released in 1995 on \"Anthology 1\". \nThe song was performed once again in 1969, during the \"Let It Be\" recording sessions, and featured in the 1970 documentary film, \"Let It Be\".\n\n\n\"You've Really Got a Hold on Me\" has been covered extensively since its release.

The song was primarily written by Paul McCartney, and finished by Lennon and McCartney in the corner of a room while Mick Jagger and Keith Richards were talking.\n\nReleased as their second single on 1 November 1963, the Stones' version was an early hit, peaking at number 12 on the British chart. Their rendition features Brian Jones' distinctive slide guitar and Bill Wyman's driving bass playing. It is one of the few Rolling Stones songs to feature only Brian Jones on backing vocals. In the US, the song was initially released as London 45-LON 9641 (with \"Stoned\" on the B side)* without any success and was soon after re-released on 6 March 1964 as the B-side to \"Not Fade Away\".\n\n\"*\" Title changed to \"Stones\" on some copies of U.K. release; also the title \"Stones\" appears on foreign E.P.s, for example French Decca 457.031.\n\nAccording to various accounts, either the Rolling Stones' manager/producer Andrew Loog Oldham or the Rolling Stones themselves ran into Lennon and McCartney on the street as the two were returning from an awards luncheon. Hearing that the band were in need of material for a single, Lennon and McCartney went to their session at De Lane Lea Studio and finished off the song – whose verse they had already been working on – in the corner of the room while the impressed Rolling Stones watched.\n\nMick Jagger recalled the song in 1968:\n\nMcCartney stated in 2016:\nBill Wyman noted how the Rolling Stones adapted the song to their style:\nReleased only as a single, the Rolling Stones' rendition did not appear on a studio album. The song was reissued in the UK on the Decca compilation albums \"Milestones\" (1972) and \"\" (1975). In 1989, it was issued on the US compilation album \"\". It is included on the four CD version of the 2012 \"GRRR!\" compilation.\n\nThe B-side of the second single was \"Stoned\", a \"Green Onions\"–influenced instrumental composed by Nanker/Phelge, the early collective pseudonym for the group. Additionally, it included the 'Sixth Stone' pianist Ian Stewart, making it the first released self-penned composition, with added spoken asides by Mick Jagger. Some original 1963 copies were issued with the misprinted title as \"Stones\", making it doubly collectable as a rarity.\n\nOn 1 January 1964, the Stones’ “I Wanna Be Your Man“ was the first song ever performed on the BBC’s \"Top of the Pops\". A performance of the song on \"The Arthur Haynes Show\" recorded on 7 February 1964 appears as part of the bonus material on the 2012 documentary film \"Crossfire Hurricane\".\n\n\nThe Beatles' version was sung by Ringo Starr and appeared on the group's second UK album, \"With the Beatles\", released 22 November 1963 and on the US release \"Meet the Beatles!\", released on 20 January 1964. It was driven by a heavily tremoloed, open E-chord on a guitar played through a Vox AC30 amplifier. John Lennon was dismissive of the song in 1980, saying:\n\nThe Beatles also recorded two versions of the song for the BBC. One version was for the \"Saturday Club\", recorded on 7 January 1964 and first broadcast on 15 February. The second version was released on the \"Live at the BBC\" collection from the \"From Us to You\" show. It was recorded on 28 February and broadcast on 30 March. The Beatles also recorded a version for the \"Around The Beatles\" TV show, recorded on 19 April 1964. This version was released on the \"Anthology 1\" collection in 1995.\n\nBob Dylan recorded a song for \"Blonde on Blonde\" (1966) called \"I Wanna Be Your Lover\" as a \"tip of the hat\" to the Lennon/McCartney song. It was left off the final album, but was eventually released on the compilation boxed set \"Biograph\" (1985).\n\nThe song features a heavy Bo Diddley beat. Bo Diddley himself acknowledged this in the song \"London Stomp\" (album \"Hey Good Lookin'\"). He sings \"Hey, Liverpool, we got the London Stomp\" over a \"I Wanna Be Your Man\" background.\n\nPersonnel per Ian MacDonald.\n\n\nRingo Starr & His All-Starr Band have performed the song as a concert staple during their 1989 through 2012–2013 All-Starr Band concerts. The song was on the setlist for the first line-up in 1989. The 1992 line-up did not perform the song. Every All-Starr Band line-up from 1995 to 2012–2013 has included the song on their setlist. The song has appeared on the following compilation albums: \"Ringo Starr and His Third All-Starr Band-Volume 1\", \"King Biscuit Flower Hour Presents Ringo & His New All-Starr Band\", \"The Anthology... So Far\", \"Ringo Starr and Friends\", \"\", \"Ringo Starr & His All Starr Band Live 2006\", and \"Live at the Greek Theatre 2008\".\n\nKeith Richards performed the song live with his group the X-Pensive Winos during their 1988 Talk is Cheap tour of the US. They performed the song at the Orpheum Theatre in Boston, at the Universal Amphitheater in Los Angeles, the Brendan Byrne Arena in East Rutherford, New Jersey, and at the Hollywood Palladium.\n\nThe Rolling Stones performed the song live during their 2012 50th anniversary concerts, the 50 & Counting Tour.

Set in Folsom State Prison in California, the film was seen both in the United States and Europe.\n\nCountry singer Johnny Cash saw this movie while serving in the United States Air Force in West Germany in October of 1951, and used it as an inspiration for his hit song \"Folsom Prison Blues,\" which he recorded numerous times between 1955 and his death in 2003.\n\nThe film was featured in the 2005 biographical film \"Walk the Line\", in which Cash (played by Joaquin Phoenix) and other Air Force personnel are depicted seeing the film.\n\nDuring the 1920s, before the 1944 California prison reform, Warden Ben Rickey (Ted De Corsia) rules Folsom Prison with a ruthless hand. He believes that prisons should be used for punishment, rather than rehabilitation to reduce the incidence of repeated returns to jail (recidivism). His methods are violent, torturous, and intended to beat the prisoners into submission.\n\nChuck Daniels (Steve Cochran), one of the toughest inmates, and his group of followers are intent on escaping. However, after an attempt which is thwarted by Rickey, a riot ensues resulting in the deaths of two officers and a few prisoners. Rickey, with his iron fist, doles out severe and cruel punishments to all prisoners connected to the incident.\n\nIn response to increasing violence, and the warden's inhumane treatment, the prison's board of directors hire an assistant, Mark Benson (David Brian), as captain of the guards. He believes that the inmates, despite their serious crimes, deserve to be treated better and given an opportunity to change by being educated on how to live on the outside, prior to release, in order to increase their chances of becoming productive members of society. Benson makes many changes to the regimen including serving meat, allowing inmates to talk during meal times, and promoting rehabilitation programs such as employment help. He also changes the way the guards do their jobs as well, by expecting them to come to work clean, behave in a professional way, and discontinue the senseless beatings that cause trouble.\n\nThese changes go against the wishes of the warden and Benson eventually leaves his post as captain of the guards. With Benson gone, Warden Rickey reverts all of the reforms and the inmates retaliate with yet another escape attempt. A riot erupts in which many are fatally wounded.\n\n"}

Bellah\n\nRobert Neelly Bellah (1927–2013) was an American sociologist and the Elliott Professor of Sociology at the University of California, Berkeley. He was internationally known for his work related to the sociology of religion.\n\nBellah graduated \"summa cum laude\" from Harvard College in 1950, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in social relations with a concentration in social anthropology. His undergraduate honors thesis won the Phi Beta Kappa Prize and was later published in 1952 with the title \"Apache Kinship Systems\".\n\nBellah graduated from Harvard in a joint sociology and Far East languages program, with Talcott Parsons and John Pelzel as his advisors, respectively. Bellah first encountered the work of Talcott Parsons as an undergraduate when his senior honors thesis advisor was David Aberle, a former student of Parsons. Parsons was specially interested in Bellah's concept of religious evolution and the concept of \"civil religion\". They remained intellectual friends until Parsons' death in 1979. He received his Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1955. His doctoral dissertation was titled \"Religion and Society in Tokugawa Japan\" and was an extension of Max Weber's Protestant ethic thesis to Japan. It was published as \"Tokugawa Religion\" in 1957.\n\nWhile an undergraduate at Harvard, Bellah was a member of the Communist Party USA from 1947 to 1949 and a chairman of the John Reed Club, \"a recognized student organization concerned with the study of Marxism\". During the summer of 1954, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard McGeorge Bundy, who later served as a national security adviser to John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, threatened to withdraw Bellah's graduate student fellowship if he did not provide the names of his former club associates. Bellah was also interrogated by the Boston office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation with the same purpose. As a result, Bellah and his family spent two years in Canada, where he was awarded a post-doctoral fellowship at the Islamic Institute in McGill University in Montreal. He returned to Harvard after McCarthyism declined due to the death of its main instigator senator Joseph McCarthy. Bellah afterwards wrote,\n\nBellah's \"magnum opus\", \"Religion in Human Evolution\" (2011), traces the biological and cultural origins of religion and the interplay between the two. The sociologist and philosopher Jürgen Habermas wrote of the work: \"This great book is the intellectual harvest of the rich academic life of a leading social theorist who has assimilated a vast range of biological, anthropological, and historical literature in the pursuit of a breathtaking project ... In this field I do not know of an equally ambitious and comprehensive study.\" The book won the Distinguished Book Award of the American Sociological Association's Section on Sociology of Religion.\n\nBellah is best known for his 1985 book \"Habits of the Heart\", which discusses how religion contributes to and detracts from America's common good, and for his studies of religious and moral issues and their connection to society. Bellah was perhaps best known for his work related to American civil religion, a term which he coined in a 1967 article that has since gained widespread attention among scholars.\n\nHe served in various positions at Harvard from 1955 to 1967 when he took the position of Ford Professor of Sociology at the University of California at Berkeley. He spent the remainder of his career at Berkeley. His views are often classified as communitarian. An academic biography of Robert Bellah, \"the world's most widely read sociologist of religion\", is currently under way.\n\nIn 1972 Carl Kaysen and Clifford Geertz nominated Robert Bellah as a candidate for a permanent faculty position at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS). (Bellah was at the IAS as a temporary member for the academic year 1972–1973.) On January 15, 1973, at an IAS faculty meeting, the IAS faculty voted against Bellah by thirteen to eight with three abstentions. All of the mathematicians and half of the historians voted against the nomination. All of the physicists voted in favor of the nomination. After the vote, Kaysen said that he intended to recommend Bellah's nomination to the IAS's trustees despite the vote. The faculty members who voted against Bellah were outraged. The dispute became extremely acrimonious, but in April 1973 Bellah's eldest daughter died and he, in grief, withdrew from consideration.\n\nBellah was born in Altus, Oklahoma, on February 23, 1927. His father was a newspaper editor and publisher and died when he was two years old. His mother Lillian moved the family to Los Angeles, where she had relatives. Bellah grew up in Los Angeles and attended Los Angeles High School, where he and his future wife, Melanie Hyman, were editors of the student newspaper. They got married in 1948 after she graduated from Stanford University, and he began studying at Harvard University after a service in the US Army. Bellah's wife died in 2010.\n\nBellah was briefly a communist during his student years at Harvard, as he recalled in 1977 in a letter to the \"New York Review of Books\" regarding McCarthyism at the university:\n\nHarvard's capitulation to McCarthyism is still being defended as a form of resistance to McCarthyism. An account of my experiences will, I believe, support [Sigmund] Diamond's and not [McGeorge] Bundy's interpretation of those years.\nI was a member of the Communist Party as a Harvard undergraduate from 1947 to 1949. During that period I was mainly involved in the John Reed Club, a recognized student organization concerned with the study of Marxism. In that connection I might recount an incident that indicates that a difference between a public policy and a private policy at Harvard such as Diamond has suggested may already have begun in 1949. According to [Seymour Martin] Lipset:\n\nIn 1949, the John Reed Club sponsored a talk by a well-known Communist, Gerhart Eisler, who was on his way to a job in East Germany after having been convicted for contempt of Congress. When the University was attacked for allowing students to be corrupted, Wilbur Bender, then Dean of Harvard College, defended the students' right to hear, stating: \"If Harvard students can be corrupted by an Eisler, Harvard College had better shut down as an educational institution ... [p. 182]\"\n\nI was, I believe, chairman of the John Reed Club at the time and was informed shortly after we announced that Eisler would speak that the university was considering forbidding the meeting and that the chairman and executive committee of the Club were asked to meet with an administrative officer. The administrator told us in the strongest terms that the invitation was extremely embarrassing for Harvard and asked us for the good of the school to withdraw the invitation. When we stood fast he told us that quite probably none of us would ever get jobs if we persisted in our course of action. The Harvard administration was attempting to do privately and indirectly what it would not do publicly and brazenly, namely suppress freedom of speech, which was precisely the aim of [Joseph] McCarthy.\n\nBellah was fluent in Japanese and literate in Chinese, French, and German, and later studied Arabic at McGill University in Montreal.\n\nBellah died July 30, 2013, at an Oakland, California, hospital from complications after heart surgery. He was 86 and is survived by his daughters Jennifer Bellah Maguire and Hally Bellah-Guther; a sister, Hallie Reynolds; and five grandchildren. Robert and Melanie Bellah's eldest daughter committed suicide in 1973. Their third daughter died at age 17 in an automobile accident. Raised as a Presbyterian, he converted to Episcopalianism in the Anglo-Catholic tradition.\n\nRobert Bellah is the author, editor, co-author, or co-editor of the following books:\n\nBellah was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1967. He received the National Humanities Medal in 2000 from President Bill Clinton, in part for \"his efforts to illuminate the importance of community in American society.\" In 2007, he received the American Academy of Religion Martin E. Marty Award for the Public Understanding of Religion.\n\n\n"}

Lennon said he was \"trying to write a Smokey Robinson or something at the time.\" The song was recorded in nine takes on 11 September 1963 at EMI Studios.\n\nThis song inspired a musical analysis from William Mann of \"The Times\", citing the \"Aeolian cadence\" (Aeolian harmony) of Lennon's vocals as the song draws to a close, and noting that the same chord progression appears at the end of the final movement of Mahler's \"Das Lied von der Erde.\" Lennon, years later, remarked: \"To this day, I have no idea what [Aeolian cadences] are. They sound like exotic birds.\" The actual meaning of the term \"Aeolian cadence\" is when a major key song resolves on the vi chord, which is the tonic chord of the relative minor key. The term derives from the fact that the Aeolian mode is rooted on the sixth step of the major scale.\n\nDominic Pedler considers the \"Aeolian cadence\" moment to occur at the end of this line: (Am) \"You hurt me then. You're back again. No/(Bm) no no/(D7) not a second time\"/(Em). Pedler writes: \"We are expecting the D7 chord, the dominant in the key of G, to return to the G major tonic\". However, in replacing it with an Em chord supporting an isolated E note on \"time\", we have an interrupted cadence or dominant-to-relative sub-minor (V7 to vi) shift. The major key of the song is G, but it appears to resolve on the Em (vi) chord. As Allan Moore puts it, \"Mann would argue that it is not the same thing as a 'V-vi' Interrupted or Deceptive cadence because—at that precise point in the song—the role of the E minor as a 'vi' is being questioned and is veering towards tonic status.\"\n\nPedler notes that another interesting moment in the song is that George Martin's piano part alternates not between G and E minor, but G and E major, the presence of the piano's extra G# (the major 3rd of the E chord) creating a \"grating, tense colouring\" in comparison to a G natural of the guitar's Em chord. Pedler's discussion with musical experts about the comparison between this Beatles song and Mahler's \"Song of the Earth\" revealed that none found anything relevant, except perhaps that Mahler's \"Farewell\" movement involves various shades of a C major chord and ends after a flute B-A drop (the A chord being a VI in the chord of C) with the \"final sonority\" of a C6 (where the C, E and G notes are from the trombones and lower strings and the A from oboe and flute, this final C6 chord seeming to be \"printed on the atmosphere\", as Benjamin Britten terms it).\n\n\n\nStephen King makes reference to this song in \"Doctor Sleep\", his 2013 sequel to \"The Shining\". It is played mysteriously on the piano by a baby in another room.\n\n"}

It bisects the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) just north of the equator at the narrowest part of the Atlantic between Brazil and West Africa, extending from 2°N to 2°S and from 16°W to 20°W. The trench has been formed by the actions of the Romanche Fracture Zone, a portion of which is an active transform boundary offsetting sections of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.\n\nIt was named after the French navy ship \"La Romanche\", commanded by captain Louis-Ferdinand Martial which on 11 October 1883 made soundings that revealed the trench. The boat was coming to France after a few months scientific mission near Cape Horn, part of the first International Polar Year.\n\nThe trench has a depth of , is long and has an average width of and allows for a major circulation of deep ocean basin water from the west Atlantic to the east Atlantic basins. Deep water flow through the trench is from west to east with a rate of 3.6 Sverdrups (million m³/s) of water.\n\nLower North Atlantic Deep Water (LNADW) is found around below sea level and flows from the Greenland and Norwegian seas; it brings high salinity, oxygen, and freon concentrations towards the equator.\nAntarctic Bottom Water (AABW) flows below the LNADW and reaches down to the seafloor. Formed around Antarctica, the AABW is cold, has low salinity, and high silicate concentration. As it flows north, it is constrained by numerous obstacles on the seafloor. In the basin on the eastern side of the MAR the Walvis Ridge blocks the northward passage.\nFor LNADW and AABW, the Romanche and Chain Fracture Zones (just south of the equator) are the only deep passages in the MAR where interbasin exchange is possible. As AABW flows through the Romanche Fracture Zone, salinity and temperature increase significantly.\nThe Romanche Fracture Zone offsets the Mid-Atlantic ridge by , making it the largest equatorial fracture zone in the Atlantic. According to the normal scenario for the opening of the South Atlantic, it is spreading at a rate of and began forming about . North of and parallel to the fracture zone is a transverse ridge which is particularly prominent over hundreds of kilometres east and west of the MAB of the South Atlantic. The western part of the transverse ridge consists of fragments of uplifted oceanic crust and upper mantle. The summit of the transverse ridge is capped by Miocene shallow water limestones that reached above sea level 20 Ma before subsiding abnormally fast. The eastern part of the transverse ridge, however, consists of a thick sequence of stratified material called the Romanche Sedimentary Sequence (RSS). The RSS includes pelagic material from the early Cretaceous (140 Ma) which, coupled with the thickness of the sequence, does not fit with the normal scenario for the opening of the South Atlantic around the Aptian-Albian (125–100 Ma).\nThe transverse ridge separates the present trench from an -long aseismic valley where the Romanche transform was located until about 10–8 Ma. This transform migration was preceded by a process 25–17 Ma during which the Miocene shallow-water platform mentioned above reached sea level as the transverse ridge was first uplifted, then deformed, and finally buried under the sea.\n\nThe hydrothermal vents of the MAR support many life forms. The Romanche and Chain Fracture Zones creates a huge gap in the MAR and can act as a \"Subsea Berlin Wall\" segregating the North Atlantic communities from those in other oceans.\nSwarms of hydrothermal shrimps reminiscent of those found from northern MAR vent-sites have been found on the northern part of the southern MAR. Bivalve communities have been reported around vents further south. These species await a formal description and it is not known whether or not they represent communities distinct from those on the northern MAR.\nThe flow of NADW through the Romanche and Chain Fracture Zones may serve as a conduit for larval transport from the western North Atlantic to the eastern South Atlantic. For example, the caridean shrimp \"Alvinocaris muricola\" inhabits cold seeps in both the Gulf of Mexico and the Gulf of Guinea, which clearly suggests a gene flow across the Atlantic, but the amount of data is very limited and dispersal pathways are not fully understood.\n\n"}

It is in Merrion Street, close to Leinster House, the former city residence of the Dukes of Leinster, where the Irish parliament now sits.\n\nArthur Wellesley, the fourth son of the Earl of Mornington, later a Field Marshal(1813), then 1st Duke of Wellington(1814) and British prime minister, is said to have been born there, though other sources suggest he was born in the family's country seat, Dangan Castle, near Summerhill, County Meath. His mother gave 1 May as his birthday, and he himself so kept it, but the nurse affirmed that he was born on 6 March at Dangan Castle, Co. Meath. The registry of St. Peter's Church, Dublin, shows that he was christened there on 30 April 1769, and the May number of \"Exshaw's Gentleman's Magazine\" has \"April 29. The Countess of Mornington of a son.\" The \"Dublin Gazette\" of 2–4 May dates the event \"a few days ago, in Merrion Street\".\n\nThe house was later sold and for most of the twentieth century was the headquarters of the Irish Land Commission. For some years it was considered as a possible residence for the Taoiseach (Prime Minister) of Ireland. It was, however, sold in the 1990s and is now a popular international hotel. The Merrion Hotel comprises a block of four houses in a terrace on Upper Merrion Street, of which Mornington House is the leftmost when viewed from the front. The houses were built in the 1760s by Charles Monck, 1st Viscount Monck for wealthy Irish merchants and nobility. He lived in No. 22, which became known as Monck House. The hotel also incorporates, as a separate business, Dublin's only 2-star Michelin restaurant, Restaurant Patrick Guilbaud.\n\nThe four houses forming the Main House of the hotel are typical of domestic Georgian architecture in Ireland. The plain exteriors rely for effect on the carefully worked out classical proportions of the timber sash windows and their relation to the whole façade. The doorcases, with their varied treatment and intricate beautiful fanlights, were where the builder could impose some individuality on the building. In most other areas, the normal lease laid down strict requirements.\n\nInternally, there were no such restrictions. This explains the wealth of varied plasterwork and woodwork contained in the houses. The architectural detail of the houses clearly indicates the progression of their construction. No. 21 has intricate rococo plasterwork and a particularly heavy staircase. The detail lightens as one progresses along the terrace, although No. 22, the first to be built, is an exception. Here the main stair hall and the principal reception rooms have much lighter detailing, in the neo-classical, Adam style. In the midst of this lighter decoration, there are examples of heavier detail, such as the intricate Corinthian cornice in the stairwell, and the superb third floor room with coved ceilings and dramatic rococo plasterwork. Monck House was \"modernised\" in the late 18th century or the beginning of the 19th century.\n\nAnother house called Mornington House in the Multyfarnham area of County Westmeath has no connection to the Earls of Mornington or their Dublin townhouse. It is in the townland of Monintown, a name which became corrupted.\n\n"}

Storm\n\nJeffrey Warner (born September 9, 1965) is a retired American professional wrestler and boxer best known by the ring name J. W. Storm.\n\nStorm worked for World Championship Wrestling most notably, as a member of the tag team Maximum Overdrive with Tim Hunt. He also had stints in Pacific Northwest Wrestling and Pro Wrestling America, winning the tag team championships in both promotions.\n\nWarner started wrestling in 1989 in the NWA's Pacific Northwest territory. He formed a tag team with Art Barr who was using a \"Beetlejuice\" gimmick called \"The Juice Patrol\" with Warner becoming \"Big Juice\". They feuded with Ricky Santana and Curtis Thompson, who formed the tag team of \"U.S. Male\", until Warner was forced to leave the promotion in a \"loser leaves town\" match on June 30, 1990.\n\nHe also wrestled in Pro Wrestling America during the late-80s and early-90s and won the tag team titles as one half of Maximum Overdrive with Tim Hunt defeating Matt Derringer and Bret Derringer on June 24, 1989. Holding the titles for nearly a year, they finally lost them to the Steiner Brothers in Atlanta, Georgia on September 17, 1990. Warner, who had previously won the PWA Iron Horse Television title on April 5, 1990, would continue defending the title before jumping to the National Wrestling Alliance in June.\n\nOn April 15, 1989 Warner and Hunt received a tryout with World Championship Wrestling, defeating The Tokyo Bullets in Chicago, IL.\n\nOn the August 24th, 1990 episode of WCW's Power Hour, an announcement was made about the forthcoming Clash of the Champions XII that stated that the then NWA/WCW U.S. Tag Team Champions Steiner Brothers would be facing one of three new tag-teams set to debut on that event, the duo known as Maximum Overdrive (the other newcomers being The Nasty Boys and The Master Blasters. The duo would be Tim Hunt (known as Hunter) and Warner, who was dubbed Silencer. Overdrive were defeated by the Steiners at the Clash on September 5, but that proved to be the only match for the tandem.\n\nTwelve days later Warner was repackaged as singles wrestler J.W. Storm, with a look modeled after Steven Seagal from the movie Hard to Kill which had released earlier in the year. Storm defeated Brett Holliday in his debut at the taping for World Championship Wrestling in Macon, GA. Storm began a win streak, defeating Allen Iron Eagle and Tommy Rich before sustaining his first pinfall loss to Brad Armstrong, losing to him at Halloween Havoc '90 in a victory that announcer Jim Ross considered an \"upset\". This began a losing streak for Storm, who would sustain losses to Tom Zenk, Brad Armstrong, and fellow Portland wrestler The Juicer. Storm would go on to face Mike Rotundo, Terry Taylor, and Dave Taylor. His final match came on November 18 against Tommy Rich.\n\nOf the three new teams that were brought into WCW for the September Clash of the Champions XII, neither the Nasty Boys or Maximum Overdrive appeared to have been on long-term deals. On December 11, 1990 the Nasty Boys made their World Wrestling Federation debut at a WWF Superstars taping in Tampa, FL; at the same show J.W. Storm received a trout match and defeated Ricky T. A day later he had another tryout at a Wrestling Challenge taping and was defeated by Shane Douglas. In February 1991 he received a second round of tryouts; on February 18 Storm was defeated by Jim Powers during a WWF Superstars taping. A day later in Ft Myers, FL he pinned Scott Allen at a Wrestling Challenge taping in Fort Myers, FL. Storm received another set of tryouts in December 1991, when he returned on Dec 3rd at San Antonio, TX house show and was defeated by Chris Chavis (Tatanka). He again wrestled Chavis the following night at a Superstars taping.\n\nOn February 14, 1992 Warner joined the WWF roster full-time. Substituting for Kerry Von Erich, Storm was defeated by The Undertaker in St Louis, MO. He saw extensive action in February and March, wrestling \"The Model\" Rick Martel, The Warlord and Hercules. Storm would gain several victories, pinning Steve Lombardi, Doug Summers, Jim Brunzell, and Kato of The Orient Express during the early part of 1992. Storm gained the services of Jimmy Hart at a Wrestling Challenge TV taping in Portland, ME on July 21 as he faced the Dublin Destroyer (Brian Donahue), but this would be his final match of the year.\n\nWarner credits his wife Jennifer with saving his life from drug and alcohol abuse. He became a born again Christian and, in 2002, an ordained minister through the International Ministerial Fellowship. He now tours the United States with his Ultimate Strength show that combines preaching with feats of strength, such as breaking through a stack of concrete blocks. Warner and his wife have four sons, one of which is Hunter Warner.\n\n\nBetween 1989 and 2000, Warner went 22-2 in boxing, all by knockout.\n\n"}
{"id": "2253826", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2253826", "title": "I Saw Her Standing There", "text": "I Saw Her Standing There\n\n\"I Saw Her Standing There\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles credited to Paul McCartney and John Lennon, but written primarily by McCartney. It is the opening track on the band's 1963 debut album \"Please Please Me\".\n\nIn December 1963, Capitol Records released the song in the United States as the B-side on the label's first single by the Beatles, \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\". While the A-side topped the US \"Billboard\" chart for seven weeks starting 1 February 1964, \"I Saw Her Standing There\" entered the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 on 8 February 1964, remaining there for 11 weeks, peaking at No. 14. The song placed on the \"Cashbox\" chart for only one week at No. 100 on the same week of its \"Billboard\" debut. In 2004, \"I Saw Her Standing There\" was ranked No. 139 on \"Rolling Stone\"s list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\nOriginally titled \"Seventeen\", the song was conceived by McCartney when driving home from a Beatles' concert in Southport, Lancashire as a modern take on the traditional song \"As I Roved Out\", a version of \"Seventeen Come Sunday\" that he had heard in Liverpool in 1960. According to Beatles biographer Mark Lewisohn, McCartney first worked out the chords and arrangement on an acoustic guitar at the family home of his Liverpool friend and fellow musician Rory Storm on the evening of 22 October 1962. Two days later, McCartney was writing lines for the song during a visit to London with his then-girlfriend Celia Mortimer, who was seventeen at the time herself. The song was completed about a month later at McCartney's Forthlin Road home in collaboration with Lennon and performed as part of their set in December 1962 in the Star Club in Hamburg.\n\nMcCartney later described in \"Beat Instrumental\" how he went about the song's composition: \"Here’s one example of a bit I pinched from someone: I used the bass riff from 'Talkin' About You' by Chuck Berry in 'I Saw Her Standing There'. I played exactly the same notes as he did and it fitted our number perfectly. Even now, when I tell people, I find few of them believe me; therefore, I maintain that a bass riff hasn’t got to be original\". Berry's \"I'm Talking About You\" was performed by The Beatles and the song appears on their albums \"Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962\" and \"On Air – Live at the BBC Volume 2\".\n\nThe lyrics were written in a Liverpool Institute exercise book. \"Remember:The Recollections and Photographs of the Beatles\", a book by McCartney's brother Mike McCartney, includes a photograph taken in the front room of his home of Lennon and McCartney writing the song while strumming their acoustic guitars and reading the exercise book. It typified how Lennon and McCartney would later work in partnership, as McCartney subsequently reflected: \"I had 'She was just seventeen,' and then 'never been a beauty queen'. When I showed it to John, he screamed with laughter, and said 'You're joking about that line, aren't you?'\" \"We came up with, 'You know what I mean.' Which was good, because you don't know what I mean.\" \"It was one of the first times he ever went 'What? Must change that ...'\" Lennon said: \"That's Paul doing his usual good job of producing what George Martin used to call a 'potboiler'. I helped with a couple of the lyrics.\" The songwriting credit on the \"Please Please Me\" liner notes is \"McCartney–Lennon\" which differs from the more familiar \"Lennon–McCartney\" that appears on subsequent releases.\n\nThe first live recording (a slow version of the song) was made at the Cavern Club at the end of 1962. Lennon did not play rhythm guitar; he played harmonica in the introduction and during the verses. Lennon and McCartney laughed when they sing \"Well we danced all night/And I held her tight/And I held her hand in mine\" the second time.\n\nThe song was recorded at EMI Studios on 11 February 1963 and engineered by Norman Smith, as part of the marathon recording session that produced 10 of the 14 songs on \"Please Please Me\". The Beatles were not present for the mixing session on 25 February 1963. It was not common practice for bands to be present at such sessions at that time.\n\nOn the album, the song starts with a rousing \"One, two, three, \"four\"!\" count-in by McCartney. Usually count-ins are edited off the final audio mix; however, record producer George Martin wanted to create the effect that the album was a live performance: \"I had been up to the Cavern and I'd seen what they could do, I knew their repertoire, and I said 'Let's record every song you've got, come down to the studios and we'll just whistle through them in a day'\". Martin took the count-in from take 9, which was considered 'especially spirited' and spliced it onto take 1. Music journalist Richard Williams suggested that this dramatic introduction to their debut album was just as stirring as Elvis Presley's \"Well, it's one for the money, two for the show ...\" on his opening track, \"Blue Suede Shoes\", for his debut album seven years earlier. It also made the point that the Beatles were a live band as, at that time, they opened their set with this song. On the first American release of the song, issued on Vee Jay Records, the count was edited out—but the \"Four!\" is still audible.\n\nThe full take 9 version of the song appears on the \"Free as a Bird\" CD single as a B side, released for the first time.\n\nTake 2 of the song was released on \"The Beatles Bootleg Recordings 1963\", which was an album released exclusively to iTunes in 2013.\n\n\n\nA live version was recorded at Madison Square Garden on 28 November 1974 by the Elton John Band with John Lennon, and released as the B-side to the former's \"Philadelphia Freedom\" single. The song is available on the \"Lennon\" box set, and on Elton John's \"To Be Continued...\" box set as well as the expanded CD edition of his 1976 live album \"Here and There\" and Elton John's \"Rare Masters\". Lennon's introduction:\n\nThis was the last major live performance by John Lennon. After Lennon's death, the track was released as a single and reached #40 on the UK Singles Chart in March 1981, making it the first time that any version of the song had entered the UK charts.\n\nMcCartney included \"I Saw Her Standing There\" on his live albums \"Tripping the Live Fantastic\" (1990), \"Back in the US\" (2002) and \"Back in the World\" (2003). In 1987, he recorded a new version for his album \"CHOBA B CCCP\", but left it to outtakes. The song has become a mainstay of McCartney's live sets, and a special version was played when McCartney and his band returned to Liverpool in June 2008. It featured special guest drummer Dave Grohl, the lead singer of the Foo Fighters and ex-drummer of Nirvana. In 2007, McCartney performed a secret gig at Amoeba Music in Hollywood - this performance appeared on the EP \"Amoeba's Secret\" and earned him a Grammy Award for Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance nomination in 2009.\n\nMcCartney performed \"I Saw Her Standing There\" at the 1986 Prince's Trust Rock Gala, as part of the 10th anniversary celebration of HRH Prince Charles' charity. He was supported by an all-star band featuring Elton John, Eric Clapton, Phil Collins, Mark Knopfler, and Ray King. Interviewed at the time, McCartney said: \"It is a good thrill playing with musicians of this calibre ... since it was a birthday thing, they wanted to do something silly at the end, and that's me\". Paul McCartney also performed a duet of this song with Billy Joel during the inaugural concert at Citi Field in Flushing, New York.\n\nGeorge Harrison and Ringo Starr also performed the song with Bruce Springsteen, Billy Joel, Mick Jagger, and Bob Dylan, amongst others, at the Beatles' induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. This makes it the only song by the Beatles that all 4 members performed on stage during their respective solo careers to any extent.\n\n\"I Saw Him Standing There\" was recorded and released by Tiffany. It appeared on her debut self-titled album, changing the lyrics to \"him\" instead of \"her\". The track was re-recorded and remixed for single release.\n\nIn Japan, one of Tiffany's most well loved songs, \"Can't Stop a Heartbeat\" was the B-side. She and the song were featured in TV commercials for Meiji's \"Marble Chocolate\". \"Can't Stop a Heartbeat\" was released in Japan before the rest of the world on the B-side on the Japanese release of \"I Saw Him Standing There\" because it was made for a TV commercial for Meiji \"Lucky\" chocolate.\n\nThe music video was a live performance of the song in front of thousands of screaming fans. Like her previous videos, it received considerable airplay on MTV and VH1.\n\nCassette single and 7-inch single\n\n\nUK 7-inch single\n\nJapanese 3-inch CD single\n\nJapanese CD EP\n\nTiffany version\n\nBibliography\n\n"}

This may be contrasted with service fraternities and sororities, whose primary purpose is community service, and general or social fraternities and sororities, whose primary purposes are generally aimed towards some other aspect, such as the development of character, friendship, leadership, or literary ability.\n\nProfessional fraternities are often confused with honor societies because of their focus on a specific discipline. Professional fraternities are actually significantly different from honor societies in that honor societies are associations designed to provide recognition of the past achievement of those who are invited to membership. Honor society membership, in most cases, requires no period of pledging, and new candidates may be immediately inducted into membership after meeting predetermined academic criteria and paying a one-time membership fee. Because of their purpose of recognition, most honor societies will have much higher academic achievement requirements for membership.\n\nProfessional fraternities, on the other hand, work to build brotherhood among members and cultivate the strengths of members in order to promote their profession and to provide assistance to one another in their mutual areas of professional study. Membership in a professional fraternity may be the result of a pledge process, much like a social fraternity, and members are expected to remain loyal and active in the organization for life. Within their professional field of study, their membership is exclusive; however, they may initiate members who belong to other types of fraternities.\n\nThe first professional fraternity was founded at Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky in 1819: the Kappa Lambda Society of Aesculapius, established for the purpose of bringing together students of the medical profession. The fraternity lasted until about 1858.\n\nOf the professional fraternities still in existence, the oldest is Phi Delta Phi founded at the University of Michigan in 1869; however, Phi Delta Phi changed its mission in 2012 to become an honor society for law school students.\n\nProfessional fraternities, in the United States fraternity system, are usually co-educational in accord with Federal Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (commonly referred to as \"Title IX\"). This federal law discourages discrimination on the basis of sex in any college or university receiving federal financial assistance. However, the membership practices of social fraternities and sororities are exempt from Title IX in section (A)(6)(a). The U.S. Department of Education (DOE) regulations adopted pursuant to Title IX also allow such an exception for \"the membership practices of social fraternities and sororities.\" (34 C.F.R. Sec. 106.14(a)).\n\nPrior to Title IX, many professional fraternities were all male and most professional sororities/women’s fraternities were all female. Several of these professional fraternities and sororities even considered themselves both professional and social organizations because they often emphasized the social aspects of their activities. During the ensuing years since the enactment of Title IX, single-sex professional fraternities and sororities became coeducational to conform to Title IX. Several organizations simply opened their membership both men and women. For example, Phi Chi (medicine) opened membership to women in 1973; Phi Beta (music and speech) opened membership to men in 1976; and Delta Omicron (music) opened membership to men in 1979. A few single-sex groups merged with other organizations, such as Phi Delta Delta, a women’s professional law fraternity, merged with Phi Alpha Delta (law) in 1972.\n\nDespite the fact that Title IX was enacted in 1972, there continues to be professional fraternities and sororities or their chapters that have not become coeducational and therefore, do not conform to Title IX. Generally, these groups still claim to be both professional and social organizations, for instance, Alpha Gamma Rho (men in agriculture), Alpha Omega Epsilon (women in engineering), and Sigma Phi Delta (men in engineering).\n\nSeveral social fraternities and sororities have membership practices of selecting their members primarily from students enrolled in particular majors or areas of study, including Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, Phi Sigma Rho, and Triangle. Nevertheless, these groups are social, rather than professional, organizations. Although they select members from students in a particular field of study, like a professional fraternity, they are single-sex social organizations because their purposes focus only on the social development of their members. Examples of groups that have been officially granted exemption from Title IX by the DOE to remain single-sex include Sigma Alpha Iota in 1981 and Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia in 1983.\n\nMany professional fraternities, particularly those of the highest esteem and reputation, are members of the Professional Fraternity Association (PFA). This group resulted in 1978 from a merger of the Professional Interfraternity Conference (PIC) (for men's groups) and the Professional Panhellenic Association (PPA) (for women's groups). In 2013, faced with an increase in campus policies that require student organizations to take all students, the PFA adopted a resolution against All Comers policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Her artist and repertoire manager, Norrie Paramor, was looking for new material for a country and western album she planned to record in Nashville, Tennessee and suggested that the Beatles compose a song especially for her. \"Misery\" was started backstage before The Beatles' performance at the King's Hall, Stoke-on-Trent, on 26 January 1963, and later completed at Paul McCartney's Forthlin Road home. At the time, McCartney commented: \"We've called it 'Misery', but it isn't as slow as it sounds, it moves along at quite a pace, and we think Helen will make a pretty good job of it.\" But Paramor considered it unsuitable, and so British singer and entertainer Kenny Lynch, who was on the same tour, recorded it instead (HMV Pop 1136), thus becoming the first artist to cover a Lennon–McCartney composition although he failed to enter the charts with it. In 1973, Lynch appeared in the cover photograph for McCartney's album, \"Band on the Run\".\n\nWhen the Beatles needed original material for their \"Please Please Me\" LP they recorded it themselves, giving its treatment, according to writer Ian MacDonald, \"a droll portrait of adolescent self-pity\". It was credited to McCartney and Lennon in that order, as were all other Lennon & McCartney originals on the \"Please Please Me\" album. The songwriting credit was changed to what would become the more familiar \"Lennon–McCartney\" for their second album, \"With the Beatles\". McCartney: \"It was our first stab at a ballad and had a little spoken preface. It was co-written. I don't think either of us dominated on that one, it was just a job, you could have called us hacks, hacking out a song for someone.\" (Barry Miles. Paul McCartney: Many Years From Now).\n\nThe Beatles recorded \"Misery\" on 11 February 1963 (marathon session) in 11 takes. Norman Smith was the engineer.\n\nNormal studio multi-track tape speed at the time was 15 ips (inches per second), but “Misery” was recorded at 30 ips, as George Martin intended to personally add piano at a later date, and preferred playing this at half-tempo an octave below.\n\nHelen Shapiro had starred in her own film called \"It's Trad, Dad!\" (released UK 16 April 1962) which was directed by Richard Lester, who later directed The Beatles' films \"A Hard Day's Night\" and \"Help!.\"\n\n\n\n"}

He praises the \"gently swinging rhythm,\" the tough, syncopated drumming, and Alexander's vocal, particularly at the beginning of the refrain, suggesting that John Lennon may have learned to sing ballads like \"In My Life\" by listening to Alexander's performance.\n\nDespite the title, throughout the song the lyric is \"go \"with\" him\" rather than \"go \"to\" him\". The song plays a prominent role in the \"Married...with Children\" episode \"Oldies But Young 'Uns\". In the episode, the song becomes an earworm for Al, who desperately wants to know the title.\n\nA personal favorite of John Lennon, it became part of the Beatles' early repertoire and was consequently recorded by them for their 1963 debut album, \"Please Please Me\". \n\nIn the U.S., Vee Jay Records released it on \"Introducing... The Beatles\" (January 10, 1964) and Capitol Records re-released it on \"The Early Beatles\" (March 22, 1965). Vee Jay also released \"Anna (Go to Him)\" on the EP \"Souvenir of Their Visit: The Beatles\" in the US.\n\nThe band recorded the song on February 11, 1963, in three takes; Take 3 was the master.

They recorded it once again on August 1, 1963, for the show broadcast on August 27.\n\nUnterberger praised the Beatles' version in his review:\nMusic critic Ian MacDonald had a different view of Lennon's vocal delivery, saying it sounded like \"a passionate youth grappling with a man's song\". As noted in many references including Mark Lewisohn's \"The Beatles Recording Sessions\", Lennon had a bad cold on the day of recording which had an adverse effect on his voice.\n\nFrom Ian MacDonald:\nEngineered by Norman Smith\n"}

They recorded it on February 11, 1963 in four takes (the first having proven to be the best) for inclusion on their British debut, \"Please Please Me\". Lennon played the introduction on harmonica. Music critic Ian MacDonald criticized the Beatles' performance, writing that it was \"slightly out-of-tune\" and \"lacked spontaneity.\" George Harrison sings the lead vocal on the Beatles' version; and, as the fourth track from the group's first album, it represents the first time many fans heard Harrison singing lead on a commercially released song.\n\nThey played the song live on a number of BBC radio shows, including \"Side by Side\", \"Here We Go\" and \"Pop Go the Beatles\" (though none of these performances were included on the 1994 compilation \"Live at the BBC\", it was eventually released on the 2013 compilation \"On Air – Live at the BBC Volume 2\").\n\nThe song was reworked into French under the title \"Chance\".

It was written primarily by John Lennon and credited to the Lennon–McCartney partnership.\n\nWritten in early 1962, \"Ask Me Why\" is principally a John Lennon composition, but was credited to Paul McCartney and John Lennon, as were all other Lennon–McCartney originals on the first pressings of \"Please Please Me\" album. Paul McCartney said, \"It was John's original idea and we both sat down and wrote it together, just did a job on it. It was mostly John's.\" It was part of their live act prior to their recording contract, and was one of the songs performed at their first Parlophone recording session in EMI's Abbey Road studio two on 6 June 1962. The song emulates the style of Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, by whom Lennon was influenced, and draws its opening guitar phrase from the Miracles' \"What's So Good About Goodbye\" (1961).\n\nThe song is in the key of E major, with some leaning to its relative minor of C#, and is in 4/4 time. Structurally, the song is complex and, as Alan Pollack states, contains three different variants of the verse. The song also contains \"jazzy parallel sevenths\" in most of the chords, and has a live ending.\n\n\"Ask Me Why\" was originally recorded at Abbey Road studios on 6 June 1962 with drummer Pete Best. As the session was a 'commercial test', none of the performances recorded that day were deemed suitable for release, and the two quarter-inch tape reels from that session were thought to be destroyed by EMI. However two songs survived. 'Besame Mucho' and 'Love Me Do' were later discovered on acetate discs.\n\nIt was recorded again, along with \"Please Please Me\", on 26 November 1962 with Ringo Starr on drums. The Beatles also rehearsed \"Tip of My Tongue\", another Lennon and McCartney song which was also being considered for the B-side of the \"Please Please Me\" single. However, George Martin felt that \"Tip of My Tongue\" still needed some work, and it was eventually given to Tommy Quickly to record.\n\n\nThe song was covered by the Smithereens on their 2008 album \"B-Sides The Beatles\".\n\nEngineered by Norman Smith \n\n"}

The song was released in the UK on 5 October 1962 as the B-side of their debut single \"Love Me Do\" and is also included on their debut album \"Please Please Me\" (1963). It was later included on the American release \"Introducing The Beatles\" (1964), its reissue \"The Early Beatles\" (1965), and the Beatles compilation album \"Love Songs\" (1977).\n\nThe version featured on the single and album was recorded in ten takes on 11 September 1962 at EMI's Abbey Road Studios, London. Producer George Martin had booked session drummer Andy White as a replacement for Pete Best, whom he considered not technically good enough for recording purposes; Martin had been unaware that the other Beatles had already replaced Pete Best with Ringo Starr, who attended the session and plays maracas on the song. White was a freelance show band and session drummer, and gave the recording a lightweight cha cha treatment.\n\nMartin was not present at the session; in his absence, it was run by Ron Richards. Richards told the group that the song could not be the A-side of their single because of an earlier song with the same title: \"I was originally a music publishing man, a plugger, so I knew someone had done a record with that title. I said to Paul, 'You can have it as B-side, but not an A-side.'\"\n\nWith Starr playing drums, the Beatles recorded the song at the BBC on 25 October 1962, 27 November 1962 and 17 June 1963 for subsequent broadcast on the BBC radio programmes \"Here We Go\", \"Talent Spot\" and \"Pop Go the Beatles\", respectively. The 17 June 1963 recording was officially published on the \"On Air – Live at the BBC Volume 2\" album (2013).\n\nWritten in spring 1962, while Paul McCartney was in Hamburg, this song is sometimes considered to be a dedication to his then-girlfriend Dot Rhone. However, McCartney denies this; he described \"P.S.

I love \"you\"\" which Ian MacDonald described as \"a dark sidestep\". Lennon contributes a single note harmony emphasising the beginning of each stanza. Lyrically constructed with their female audience in mind, the Beatles included it as part of their Cavern Club song set.\n\nNo original master tapes of the 11 September version of \"P.S. I Love You\" are known to exist. Standard procedure at Abbey Road Studios at the time was to erase the original two-track session tape for \"singles\" once they had been \"mixed down\" to the (usually monaural) master tape used to press records. This was the fate of two Beatles singles (four songs): \"Love Me Do\", \"P.S. I Love You\", \"She Loves You\", and \"I'll Get You\".\n\nOn its 20th anniversary, Parlophone re-issued \"P.S.

The 1963 version by Billy J. Kramer with the Dakotas (a UK No. 2) credited the composition to \"McCartney–Lennon\". The song was inspired by \"I'm Wishing\", a tune from Walt Disney’s 1937 animated film \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" which Lennon's mother, Julia Lennon, would sing to him as a child. The first two lines of the song in Disney's movie (\"Want to know a secret? Promise not to tell?\") come right after the opening lyrics (\"You'll never know how much I really love you... You'll never know how much I really care...\"). McCartney has said it was a \"50–50 collaboration written to order\", i.e., for Harrison to sing, but Lennon, who always claimed the song as his own, explained in a 1980 interview that he had realized as soon as he had finished writing the song that it best suited Harrison.\n\nIn 1980, Lennon said that he gave \"Do You Want to Know a Secret\" to Harrison to sing because \"it only had three notes and he wasn't the best singer in the world\", but added \"he has improved a lot since then.\" The song was recorded as part of their marathon ten-hour recording session on 11 February 1963 along with nine other songs for \"Please Please Me\". Harrison sang two songs on \"Please Please Me\"—this song by Lennon–McCartney and \"Chains\" by Goffin/King. \"Don't Bother Me\" would be Harrison's debut composition and appeared on the Beatles' next UK album \"With the Beatles\".\n\nHarrison and Lennon both played acoustic guitars on the recording in different channels – Harrison's guitar was panned to the right channel while Lennon's was panned to the left.\n\n\"Do You Want to Know a Secret\" was released a year later as a single by Vee-Jay in the United States on 23 March 1964, reaching the number two spot behind another Beatles song, \"Can't Buy Me Love\" in \"Billboard\", reaching number three on the \"Cash Box\" chart, but reaching number one for two weeks in the chart published by the Teletheatre Research Institute.

The group formed in 1996 and have released five albums to date.\n\nCamera Obscura were formed in 1996 by Tracyanne Campbell, John Henderson and Gavin Dunbar. Several other members performed with the band before David Skirving joined as a permanent guitarist. Their first releases were the singles \"Park and Ride\" and \"Your Sound\" in 1998. The band's line-up changed in 2000 and 2001 when Lee Thompson joined as its permanent drummer, Lindsay Boyd joined as a keyboard player, and Skirving left and was replaced by Kenny McKeeve.\n\nCamera Obscura's first album, \"Biggest Bluest Hi Fi\", was released in 2001. The album was produced by Stuart Murdoch of Belle & Sebastian and was supported by John Peel. The first single from the album, \"Eighties Fan\", came in at number eight in the Festive Fifty in 2001, and charted in several independent music charts. Nigel Baillie joined the band as a trumpeter and percussionist in 2002 and Carey Lander replaced Boyd. In the summer of 2002, Peel asked the band to do their first Peel session.\nThe band's second album, \"Underachievers Please Try Harder\", was released in 2003 and was followed by Camera Obscura's first full tour of Great Britain and Ireland and the band's first tour of the United States. Founding member John Henderson left Camera Obscura following this tour. In early 2004 the band recorded the songs \"I Love My Jean\" and \"Red, Red Rose\" following their third Peel session, in which Peel had asked them to put these poems by Robert Burns to music.\n\nCamera Obscura recorded their third album, \"Let's Get Out of This Country\", in Sweden over the course of two weeks with producer Jari Haapalainen. The album was released on 6 June 2006. The first single, \"Lloyd, I'm Ready to Be Heartbroken\", is an answer song to Lloyd Cole and the Commotions' song \"Are You Ready to Be Heartbroken?\"; it appears during the opening credits of the 2007 film, \"P.S. I Love You\". The title song was featured in episode 5 of \"Friday Night Lights\".\n\nIn November 2008, the band announced that they had completed recording the follow-up to \"Let's Get Out of This Country\", and in February 2009, they announced they had signed with 4AD. The new album, \"My Maudlin Career\", was released in April 2009, and preceded by the first single \"French Navy\". London-based jewellery brand Tatty Devine created brooches and necklaces to coincide with the launch. The album was the band's first UK Top 40 success, and it also reached the top 40 in Ireland and the US Billboard Top 100. Around this time, the band announced that \"due to family commitments (including being a proud dad) Nigel will no longer be a full time member of Camera Obscura\".\n\nOn 18 April 2009, Camera Obscura released a special edition Record Store Day 7\" called \"French Navy\" for independent record stores. \"French Navy\" was also used by Echo Falls, who are the sponsors of \"Come Dine With Me\", at the start of each episode and during commercial breaks. Their album \"Desire Lines\" was produced by Tucker Martine and released by 4AD on 3 June 2013. The album was the band's second UK Top 40 entry and narrowly missed the US Top 100.\n\nIn 2015, the band announced the cancellation of planned gigs in North America due to the illness of Carey Lander. She was first diagnosed with osteosarcoma in 2011. She announced in 2015 that it had returned. Lander set up a JustGiving page for Sarcoma UK in order to raise awareness to the illness and lack of funding for research and treatment, and as of November 2015, the sum of donations is over £73,000. Carey Lander died on 11 October 2015.\n\nIn May 2018, while Campbell was promoting the self-titled debut album of Tracyanne & Danny, her new project with Danny Coughlan, she noted that she still kept in touch with the other members of Camera Obscura in the wake of Lander's passing, but the future of the band remained undiscussed. The song \"Alabama\" from the \"Tracyanne & Danny\" album is Campbell's tribute to Lander.\n\nOn 5 September 2018, Camera Obscura announced their live return as part of the Boaty Weekender, a cruise festival curated by Belle & Sebastian sailing from Barcelona to Cagliari on 8-12 August 2019.\n\nPrior to participating in the Boaty Weekender, the band announced a warm-up show at Saint Luke's & The Winged Ox in Glasgow on 5 August with proceeds donated to the Prince and Princess of Wales Hospice in memory of Carey Lander. After tickets for the show were sold out, the band added a second date with proceeds also being donated.\n\nFor these shows and the Boaty Weekender, the band brought in Donna Maciocia, formerly of Amplifico, on keyboards and backing vocals.\n\nOn 5 August 2019, Camera Obscura hinted at the possibility of releasing new music when responding to a tweet referring to \"Desire Lines\" as their \"5th and final album,\" to which the band replied \"It's definitely our fifth album...\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The station is owned by the Bell Media subsidiary of BCE Inc. CJCH-DT's studios are located on Robie and Russell Streets in Halifax, and its transmitter is located on Washmill Lake Drive on the city's west side.\n\nCJCH-DT is the flagship of the CTV Atlantic regional system, producing all of the system's programming except for some commercials and local news inserts on the other stations. On cable, CJCH is available on Eastlink TV channel 9 (some systems carry the station on channel 5, 8 or 12) and Bell Aliant channel 6. On Shaw Direct, it is carried in high-definition on channels 052 (Classic) and 552 (Advanced). There is also a high definition feed offered on Eastlink TV digital channel 603 and Bell Aliant TV channel 402.\n\nCJCH-TV first went on the air on January 1, 1961 as an independent station, and it became one of the original CTV stations when the network began operations on October 1, 1961. CHUM Limited sold CJCH-TV along with ATV and the Atlantic Satellite Network (ASN) to Baton Broadcasting (CTV) on February 26, 1997 (with CRTC approval given on August 28, 1997), but kept CJCH radio. CTVglobemedia's acquisition of CHUM Limited on June 22, 2007 brought CJCH-TV and CJCH radio back under common ownership.\n\n\n\nAs of May 12, 2011, the HD signal of CJCH is available on Eastlink. It became available on Bell TV via channel 1011 as of September 12, 2011, Bell Aliant TV in early 2012, and Shaw Direct on May 29, 2013.\n\nThe station ceased broadcasting in analogue on August 31, 2011 and began broadcasting in digital on the same date.\n\n The Bridgetown transmitter was among a long list of CTV rebroadcasters nationwide to shut down on or before August 31, 2009, as part of a political dispute with Canadian authorities on paid fee-for-carriage requirements for cable television operators. A subsequent change in ownership assigned full control of CTVglobemedia to Bell Canada; as of 2011, these transmitters remain in normal licensed broadcast operation.\n\nOn February 11, 2016, Bell Media applied for its regular license renewals, which included applications to delete a long list of transmitters, including CJCH-TV-2 and CJCH-TV-8. Bell Media's rationale for deleting these analog repeaters is below:\n\"We are electing to delete these analog transmitters from the main licence with which they are associated. These analog transmitters generate no incremental revenue, attract little to no viewership given the growth of BDU or DTH subscriptions and are costly to maintain, repair or replace. In addition, none of the highlighted transmitters offer any programming that differs from the main channels. The Commission has determined that broadcasters may elect to shut down transmitters but will lose certain regulatory privileges (distribution on the basic service, the ability to request simultaneous substitution) as noted in Broadcasting Regulatory Policy CRTC 2015–24, Over-the-air transmission of television signals and local programming. We are fully aware of the loss of these regulatory privileges as a result of any transmitter shutdown.\"\nAt the same time, Bell Media applied to convert the licenses of CTV 2 Atlantic (formerly ASN) and CTV 2 Alberta (formerly ACCESS) from satellite-to-cable undertakings into television stations without transmitters (similar to cable-only network affiliates in the United States), and to reduce the level of educational content on CTV 2 Alberta.\n\nOn July 30, 2019, Bell Media was granted permission to close down two additional transmitters as part of Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2019-268. The transmitters for CJCH-TV-3 and CJCH-TV-4 will be shut down by December 3, 2021.\n\n"}

Lennon and McCartney share lead vocals, with George Harrison providing backing vocals. In the US it was released on \"Introducing... The Beatles\" (Vee-Jay Records) and as the B-side of \"Twist and Shout\", and was finally released by Capitol Records on \"Rarities\" in 1980.\n\nThe title was inspired by Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim's \"Somewhere\" from \"West Side Story\", which contained the line: \"There's a place for us.\" McCartney admits owning the album of the film's soundtrack at the time of writing \"There's a Place\" and acknowledges its influence. The song's subject matter was pitched on higher intellectual plane than most pop songs of that period, as Lennon explained: There's a Place' was my attempt at a sort of Motown, black thing. It says: 'In my mind there's no sorrow...' It's all in your mind.\" McCartney is quoted as saying: \"In our case the place was in the mind, rather than round the back of the stairs for a kiss and a cuddle. This was the difference with what we were writing: we were getting a bit more cerebral. We both sang it. I took the high harmony, John took the lower harmony or melody. This was a nice thing because we didn't actually have to decide where the melody was till later when they boringly had to write it down for sheet music.\" Composed at McCartney's Forthlin Road home, it was part of the group's stage repertoire in 1963. With its major seventh harmonica intro (later reprised) and searing two-part vocal harmonies, it stands out as an early Beatles milestone track. The song was recorded on 11 February 1963 in 10 takes during the first of three sessions for \"Please Please Me\". It was later overdubbed with a harmonica in 3 takes.\n\nThe song was officially credited to \"McCartney–Lennon\", as were all other Lennon–McCartney compositions on the original UK release of \"Please Please Me\".\n\n\nEngineered by Norman Smith\n\n\nIt was used at the start of Daniel Farson's Associated-Rediffusion documentary \"Beat City\", a portrait of Liverpool which was shown at Christmas 1963.\n\n\n"}

It does not offer, recommend, or refer for abortions. Heartbeat International teaches its affiliated members to make their advertising look as though they are full-service clinics that provide referrals for birth control or abortion. Staff are also trained on how to discourage pregnant women from accessing abortion, and how to discourage young women from using emergency contraception, birth control pills, or IUDs. Heartbeat staff are also encouraged to create two websites, one that has an explicitly Christian message, and one that looks like Planned Parenthood. Many pregnancy centers have the ultimate goal of converting women through a born-again experience to \"save the mother, save the baby.\"\n\nHeartbeat International started in 1971 under the name Alternatives to Abortion, in response to increased liberalization of abortion laws in several states, which would eventually culminate in \"Roe v. Wade\", making abortion legal across the United States. Its founders believed that legalizing abortion would result in more, not fewer, abortions, as women would be pressured into choosing abortion. Therefore, Alternatives to Abortion started as a humanitarian organization to provide a \"safety net\" of emergency pregnancy support as a counter to the pressure to abort. The centers provide material relief to women once they have decided pregnancies to term, primarily baby & maternity items. Items they cannot provide they often will refer women to secondhand retail shops as well as nonprofits in their area for assistance with clothing & assorted baby items. The organization adopted its current name in 1993.\n\nHeartbeat International is headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, United States.\n\nIn February 2020, openDemocracy revealed that Heartbeat International had been targeting vulnerable women in 18 countries with disinformation about abortions.\n\nThere have been a number of lawsuits against clinics associated with Heartbeat International for misrepresenting what they provide to people.\n"}

{"id": "2253915", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2253915", "title": "Silver John", "text": "Silver John\n\nSilver John is a fictional character from a series of fantasy stories (1963–84) by American author Manly Wade Wellman (1903–1986). Though fans refer to him as \"Silver John\" or as \"John the Balladeer\", the stories call him simply John. He is an example of the loner hero. The stories are set in the Appalachian mountains of North Carolina. The historical period is never explicitly indicated, but appears to be the middle 20th century.\n\nJohn, whose last name is never revealed, is a wandering singer who carries a guitar strung with strings of pure silver. He is a veteran of the Korean War and served in the U.S. Army as a sharpshooter (in the novel \"After Dark\", he mentions that his highest rank was PFC). In his travels, he frequently encounters creatures and superstitions from the folk tales and superstitions of the mountain people. Though John has no formal education, he is self-taught, highly intelligent and widely read; it is implied that his knowledge of occult and folk legendarium is of PhD level (in the novel \"The Hanging Stones\", he receives word that Flornoy College is awarding him an honorary doctorate for contributions to folklore and folk music). This knowledge has granted him competent use of white magic, which he has used on occasion to overcome enemies or obstacles, but it is primarily his courage, wit and essential goodness that always enables him to triumph over supernatural evils (although the silver strings of his guitar and his possession of a copy of \"The Long Lost Friend\" are also powerful tools in fighting evil magic), while basic Army training allows him to physically deal with human foes. He has an implied mystic link of some sort to John the Baptist, and much of his personal philosophy can be traced to a \"primitive\" Gospel-based Christianity. On one occasion, he is \"employed\" by the State Department to investigate on their behalf a possible instance of Satanism (see the novel \"The Lost and Lurking\" for full details).\n\nIn the short story \"Nine Yards of Other Cloth\", John rescues a girl named Evadare from the unwanted attentions of the evil Shull Cobart: \"Small-made, yet you saw she was grown and you saw she was proud ... Her bright sun-colored hair was tied behind her neck with a blue ribbon ... I saw by the glow how pinky-soft her skin was, how young and pretty, and bigger, bluer eyes than Evadare's you couldn't call for.\"\n\nAfter Shull Cobart is destroyed, Evadare asks to join John on his travels, but he refuses to make her a wanderer like himself; when he can't dissuade her, he flees from her but she follows him. When after following without complaint she reaches the end of her strength and endurance, he realizes that he loves her. In the following story \"Trill Coster's Burden\", after Evadare shows her faith and courage by taking a dead wicked woman's sins upon herself according to mountain custom (called \"sin-eating\": \"Somebody dies after a bad life, and a friend or paid person agrees the sins will be his, not the dead one's\") and watching out the night, she and John are married by Preacher Frank Ricks. Evadare is mentioned in the subsequent \"Silver John\" novels, but only actually appears in the novel \"The Hanging Stones\".\n\nThe stories are rich in the customs and lore of the region and many of the folk songs John sings are authentic as well. Wellman did introduce some original songs and legends but his creations blend seamlessly with the traditional material. Whereas Tolkien integrated Northern mythology into his mythos, and C.S. Lewis the European Fairy Tales of yore, Wellman's stories are drenched in the folktales and songs of old Americana; the haunting stories of the slaves and the tall tales of the Revolution, strange beasts, witch-women, and dark apparitions. As famed author Karl Edward Wagner wrote: \"These stories are chilling and enchanting, magical and down-to-earth, full of wonder and humanity. They are fun. They are like nothing else you’ve read before.\"\n\nThe short stories of John have been collected four times, as \"Who Fears the Devil?\" (1963), \"John the Balladeer\" (1988), \"Owls Hoot in Daytime and Other Omens\" (2003), and \"Who Fears the Devil?\" (2010). In addition, there are five novels about John. Wellman was planning an additional novel, to be titled \"The Valley So Low\", but died before writing it. The title would be used for a collection of his stories, instead.\n\n\nThere are also a group of mini-stories or vignettes, consisting of about half a page, that were originally used as transitions from one major story to another in the collection \"Who Fears the Devil\". These were later collected and made into two chapters in the later collections: \"Wonder As I Wander\" and \"Further Down the Trail\":\n\nThe Silver John stories and vignettes are available in audio-book format through Audible in the collection \"Owls Hoot in the Daytime and Other Omens\" read by Brian Troxell.\n\n\nThe novel \"The Old Gods Waken\" is available in audio-book format from Blackstone Audio read by Stefan Rudnicki on CD and via download through Audible.\n\n\n"}

He is best known for his tenures in World Championship Wrestling under the ring name Van Hammer or simply Hammer.\n\nBefore becoming a wrestler, Hildreth joined the United States Navy after graduating from high school and traveled around the world while on tour.\n\nAfter being trained by Boris Malenko and Dan Spivey, Hildreth made his debut on July 19, 1991 as \"The Hammer\", teaming with \"Iceman\" King Parsons to defeat Billy Travis and Khris Germany in a tag team match for the North Georgia Wrestling Alliance. The referee for this match was Hildreth's brother, Dwayne Hildreth. Hildreth had expected to wrestle on the independent circuit for at least a few years. However the promotion was being booked by Dusty Rhodes, who also served as the booker for World Championship Wrestling. Despite having wrestled just one match, Hildreth was invited to be the opponent for fellow Malenko trainee Marc Mero for the latter's tryout match for WCW.\n\nMarc Mero was brought in for a tryout match in 1991, and Hildreth was his opponent. Then booker Dusty Rhodes liked both and signed each of them to contracts, with Hammer inked to a $156,000 deal. In September 1991, Hildreth joined World Championship Wrestling as \"Heavy Metal\" Van Hammer, a rock star gimmick. He made his debut for the promotion at \"Clash of the Champions XVI\", where he squashed Terrance Taylor in 39 seconds. \nHe immediately was thrust unto the house show circuit, defeating Taylor in multiple rematches as well as defeating Oz and Cactus Jack. He made his WCW television debut on the October 15 episode of \"Saturday Night\", defeating Paul Lee. Twelve days later, he made his pay-per-view debut at Halloween Havoc, defeating Doug Somers. On November 3, he gained a non-title victory over WCW TV Champion Arn Anderson at a house show in Charleston, West Virginia. Hammer would go on to amass a 42-0 record competing on both house shows and television before finally having his streak ended when he lost a match to Cactus Jack at \"Clash of the Champions XVII\". At Starrcade, Hammer teamed with Big Josh in a losing effort to Steve Austin and Rick Rude.\n\nAfter briefly continuing his tag team with Big Josh, Hammer returned to singles competition and faced Steve Austin for the World Television Championship on the January 12 episode of \"Main Event\", but was unable to win the title. After the loss, Hammer competed sporadically throughout the rest of the spring (including a brief feud with JT Southern) before returning full-time in August 1992. Hammer would fall to Greg Valentine and Nikita Koloff before his push began to accelerate. In September he went on a ten match winning streak, defeating Dallas Page, Vinnie Vegas (Kevin Nash), and Super Invader (Hercules Hernandez). He received a US title shot against Rick Rude on the November 21st episode of \"WCW Power Hour\" but came up short. Hammer teamed with Erik Watts at Halloween Havoc and was victorious against The Vegas Connection. For the remainder of October and November he was strongly pushed, going 19-2 in a streak that included victories over Tony Atlas, The Barbarian, and Mustafa Saed. He would also team with Brad Armstrong in a brief feud with Page and Vegas.\n\nOn the November 21 episode of \"WCW Worldwide\", Hammer was entered into the Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura Strongest Arm Tournament and defeated Vinnie Vegas. On the December 12th episode, Hammer upset Big Van Vader to advance to the finals against WCW World Heavyweight Champion Ron Simmons. The following week Hammer defeated Simmons to win the arm wrestling challenge.\n\nHammer teamed with Sting and was victorious in a tag-team match on the November 21 episode of \"WCW Saturday Night\", defeating Rick Rude & Cactus Jack via disqualification. On a November 26 house show at the Omni in Atlanta, Georgia, Hammer was given a broken nose by Rick Rude during an eight-man tag-team main event match held in a thunderdome cage match. Rather than take time off he instead took a Sharpie, inserted it into his nose, and straightened it out. Despite the injury he missed no dates and continued to be victorious on the house show circuit. Hammer made his second Starrcade appearance, where he and his trainer Dan Spivey defeated Cactus Jack and Johnny B. Badd to qualify for the Battlebowl. In the main event, The Great Muta defeated both Hammer, Spivey and five other wrestlers to win the Battlebowl.\n\nOn January 2, 1993, Van Hammer lost to Tony Atlas in the quarterfinals of a tournament for the vacant WCW United States Heavyweight Championship on \"Saturday Night\". A day later he lost to World Heavyweight Champion Big Van Vader on a house show in Bristol, TN, after which he took time off to have surgery to repair the broken nose that he had been wrestling with, causing him to miss the Thunderdome match at the Clash of the Champions XXII on January 13. He would be out for a month before returning on the February 9th taping of WCW Power Hour. Hammer continued to be a mainstay on \"Saturday Night\", winning the majority of his matches. At the first-ever Slamboree pay-per-view, Van Hammer lost his match with Sid Vicious in only 35 seconds.\n\nDespite the quick loss Hammer continued to be pushed, defeating Vinnie Vegas on a house show in Louisville, Kentucky on June 3. He was victorious as well against Tommy Angel and Vladimir Koloff as well that month, although he sustained a defeat to Rick Rude. On July 3, Hammer defeated Lord Steven Regal at a house show in Spartanburg, South Carolina. His final WCW match came on July 11 in Tower City, Pennsylvania when he pinned Wrecking Crew Fury. However due to WCW's lengthy tapings that began that month, he continued to appear much later in the year. On the September 11 episode of \"WCW Worldwide\" (taped July 7 in Orlando, Florida) he teamed with 2 Cold Scorpio and Marcus Alexander Bagwell in a losing effort against Sid Vicious & Harlem Heat. His final television appearance came on the November 6 episode of \"WCW Worldwide\" (taped July 10 in Orlando, Florida), Hammer attempted to defend his Jesse Ventura's Strongest Arm championship but was defeated by The Equalizer in the first round.\n\nOn July 26, 1993 Hildreth received a tryout match at a \"WWF Superstars\" taping in Utica, New York. Wrestling as Van Hammer, he worked as a heel but was defeated. The following day at a \"Wrestling Challenge\" taping in Plattsburgh, New York he was defeated by Damien Demento in another dark match.\n\nIn addition to making a television appearance in November 1993 (due to the pre-taping in July) in the Jesse Ventura arm-wrestling challenge, Hammer's name was also mentioned on the January 4 episode of \"WCW Main Event\" in a segment with Diamond Dallas Page. The heel randomly drew names out a fishbowl, and Hammer's name was one of the selections. However Hildreth would not make his actual return until November 29, 1994, when he was defeated by Dick Slater in a television taping.\n\nOn the January 21, 1995 episode of \"WCW Pro\" (taped on December 4, 1994 in Dalton, Georgia) another challenge was made by Diamond Dallas Page, this time a call to defend his arm wrestling title. Van Hammer made a surprise appearance to accept the challenge and Page faked an arm injury and called it off. One month later, on the February 25 episode of \"WCW Pro\", Page defeated Hammer in an arm wrestling match after Max Muscle interfered.\n\nHildreth returned to WCW in November 1997 under the shortened ring name Hammer, where he was placed in Raven's stable The Flock. Despite being an undercarder, much like the rest of The Flock's members, he was granted a title match against the United States Heavyweight Champion Diamond Dallas Page on the February 23, 1998, episode of \"Monday Nitro\", but was unsuccessful in winning the title. On the March 2, 1998, episode of \"Nitro\", Hammer lost to Page via disqualification in a title rematch.\n\nHammer began jobbing to several top stars before winning a Loser Leaves The Flock match against fellow Flock member Perry Saturn on a special Friday episode of \"Nitro\" on May 4. Despite the win, The Flock attacked Hammer after the match and he was thrown out of the group. In his first match following his expulsion from The Flock, Hammer faced the new United States Heavyweight Champion Goldberg for the title the following night on \"Saturday Night\", but lost. He then abandoned the grunge-related attire he had while with The Flock and became a face by adopting a hippie gimmick. After spending the rest of 1998 and January 1999 jobbing, he became a heel again and changed his gimmick to that an anti-pacifist and returned to using his full Van Hammer name. Following this, he began a short winning streak over the next few weeks before losing to Bam Bam Bigelow on the February 22, 1999 episode of \"Nitro\". Van Hammer quickly rebounded and began another winning streak over the following weeks on \"Nitro\", \"Thunder\", \"Saturday Night\" and even on pay-per-view at The Great American Bash on June 13 by defeating Mikey Whipwreck. Hammer's winning streak was ended a few weeks later as he lost to Rick Steiner in a title match for Steiner's World Television Championship on July 11 at Bash at the Beach. On the October 11 episode of \"Nitro\", Hammer lost to Sid Vicious in a match for the United States Heavyweight Championship.\n\nOn the May 2, 2000 episode of \"Thunder\", Hammer participated in a 41-man battle royal to determine the number one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship, which was ultimately won by Ric Flair. Soon afterwards, Hammer joined the Misfits In Action and was renamed Major Stash so as to fit in with the stable's military gimmick. He was originally to be named Private Stash, as an inside joke to marijuana, but balked at being given the lowest rank in the stable, leading him to being \"promoted\" to \"Major\". However, Stash's tenure with the Misfits was short-lived, as he wrestled what turned out to be his final match in WCW, a losing effort to The Demon on the July 12, 2000 episode of \"Thunder\", as he was released from his contract shortly after.\n\nAfter leaving WCW, Hildreth took a brief hiatus from wrestling. On March 16, 2001, under his Van Hammer ring name and rock star gimmick, he lost to Thrasher in a match for Maryland Championship Wrestling. He returned to MCW on June 9, and defeated Dino Devine. On December 16, he teamed with Cowboy to defeat Devine and Chad Bowman. On February 16, 2002, Hammer teamed with Cowboy in a rematch against Devine and Bowman, which he and Cowboy lost. After a year long hiatus, Van Hammer returned to MCW on July 16, 2003 at MCW's annual Shane Shamrock Memorial Cup, where he won an eight-man tag team match alongside Gillberg, Thrasher and Kelly Bell against Brock Singleton, Genesis and The Holy Rollers (Earl the Pearl and Rich Meyes).\n\nIn 2009, Hildreth attended an MCW show where wrestler Champ Pain performed a promo calling Hildreth \"washed up\" and comparing him to Randy \"The Ram\" Robinson, the character played by Mickey Rourke in the film \"The Wrestler\". In response, Hildreth entered the ring, but Champ Pain fled before a fight could break out. On April 11, 2009, at MCW's event Xtreme Measures, Hildreth - wrestling as \"Van Hammer\" - came out of retirement for one night to defeat Champ Pain.\n\nOn January 26, 2020, Hildreth was arrested in Palm Beach County, Florida and charged with DUI and first degree felony hit and run. Hildreth was reported to be driving at 58 mph in a 35 mph zone when he hit a 5-year-old child who was riding a bicycle. The child reportedly flew on to the hood of Hildreth's car and suffered internal injuries but ultimately survived. Hildreth is currently being held on $125,000 bond with the option of house arrest however he currently remains in custody at the Palm Beach County jail.\n\n"}

His major work was in the fields of political sociology, trade union organization, social stratification, public opinion, and the sociology of intellectual life. He also wrote extensively about the conditions for democracy in comparative perspective. A socialist in his early life, Lipset later moved to the right, and was often considered a neoconservative.\n\nAt his death in 2006, \"The Guardian\" called him \"the leading theorist of democracy and American exceptionalism\"; \"The New York Times\" said he was \"a pre-eminent sociologist, political scientist and incisive theorist of American uniqueness\"; and the \"Washington Post\" said he was \"one of the most influential social scientists of the past half century.\"\n\nLipset was born in Harlem, New York City, the son of Russian Jewish immigrants. His family urged him to become a dentist.\n\nHe grew up in the Bronx among Irish, Italian and Jewish youth. \"I was in that atmosphere where there was a lot of political talk,\" Lipset recalled, \"but you never heard of Democrats or Republicans; the question was communists, socialists, Trotskyists, or anarchists. It was all sorts of different left wing groups.\" Seymour was active in the Young People's Socialist League, an organization of young Trotskyists. He graduated from City College of New York, where he was an anti-Stalinist leftist, and later became National Chairman of the Young People's Socialist League. He received a PhD in sociology from Columbia University in 1949. Before that he taught at the University of Toronto.\n\nLipset was the Caroline S.G. Munro Professor of Political Science and Sociology and a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University and then became the George D. Markham Professor of Government and Sociology at Harvard University. He also taught at Columbia University, the University of California, Berkeley, the University of Toronto, and George Mason University where he was the Hazel Professor of Public Policy.\n\nLipset was a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He was the only person to have been President of both the American Political Science Association (1979–1980) and the American Sociological Association (1992–1993). He also served as the President of the International Society of Political Psychology, the Sociological Research Association, the World Association for Public Opinion Research, the Society for Comparative Research, and the Paul F. Lazarsfeld Society in Vienna.\n\nBesides making substantial contributions to cleavage theory, with his partner Stein Rokkan, Lipset was one of the first proponents of the \"theory of modernization\", which states that democracy is the direct result of economic growth, and that “[t]he more well-to-do a nation, the greater the chances that it will sustain democracy.” Lipset's modernization theory has continued to be a significant factor in academic discussions and research relating to democratic transitions. It has been referred to as the \"Lipset hypothesis\" and the \"Lipset thesis\".\n\nLipset received the MacIver Prize for \"Political Man\" (1960) and, in 1970, the Gunnar Myrdal Prize for \"The Politics of Unreason\".\n\nIn 2001, Lipset was named among the top 100 American intellectuals, as measured by academic citations, in Richard Posner's book, \"Public Intellectuals: A Study of Decline.\"\n\nLipset left the Socialist Party in 1960 and later described himself as a centrist, deeply influenced by Alexis de Tocqueville, George Washington, Aristotle, and Max Weber. He became active within the Democratic Party's conservative wing, and associated with neoconservatives, without calling himself one.\n\nLipset was vice-chair of the board of directors of the United States Institute of Peace, a board member of the Albert Shanker Institute, a member of the US Board of Foreign Scholarships, co-chair of the Committee for Labor Law Reform, co-chair of the Committee for an Effective UNESCO, and consultant to the National Endowment for the Humanities, the National Humanities Institute, the National Endowment for Democracy, and the American Jewish Committee.\n\nLipset was a strong supporter of the state of Israel, and was President of the American Professors for Peace in the Middle East, chair of the National B'nai B'rith Hillel Commission and the Faculty Advisory Cabinet of the United Jewish Appeal, and co-chair of the Executive Committee of the International Center for Peace in the Middle East. He worked for years on seeking solution for the Israeli–Palestinian conflict as part of his larger project of research on the factors that allow societies to sustain stable and peaceful democracies. His work focused on the way in which high levels of socioeconomic development created the preconditions for democracy (see also Amartya Sen's work), and the consequences of democracy for peace.\n\nLipset's book \"The First New Nation\" was a finalist for the National Book Award. He was also awarded the Townsend Harris and Margaret Byrd Dawson Medals for significant achievement, the Northern Telecom-International Council for Canadian Studies Gold Medal, and the Leon Epstein Prize in Comparative Politics by the American Political Science Association. He received the Marshall Sklare Award for distinction in Jewish studies and, in 1997, he was awarded the Helen Dinnerman Prize by the World Association for Public Opinion Research.\n\nLipset's first wife, Elsie, died in 1987. She was the mother of his three children, David, Daniel, and Carola (\"Cici\"). David Lipset is a Professor of Anthropology at the University of Minnesota. He had six grandchildren. Lipset was survived by his second wife, Sydnee Guyer (a director of the JCRC), whom he married in 1990.\n\nAt age 84, Lipset died as a result of complications following a stroke.\n\n\n\n\n"}

One of the owners in the early days was Aaron Ross. Over the next fifty years Snowbasin grew, and after a large investment in lifts and snowmaking by owner Earl Holding, Snowbasin hosted the 2002 Winter Olympic alpine skiing races for downhill, combined, and super-G.\nThe movie \"Frozen\" was filmed there in 2009.\nSnowbasin is located on Mount Ogden at the west end of State Route 226, which is connected to I-84 and SR-39 via SR-167 (New Trappers Loop Road).\n\nSnowbasin is one of the oldest continuously operating ski areas in the United States. Following the end of World War I and the Great Depression numerous small ski resorts were developed in Utah's snow-packed mountains, and Weber County wanted one of their own. They decided to redevelop the area in and around Wheeler Basin, a deteriorated watershed area that had been overgrazed and subjected to aggressive timber-harvesting.\n\nLands were restored and turned over to the U.S. Forest Service, and by 1938 the Forest Service and Alf Engen had committed to turning the area into a recreational site. In 1939 the first ski tow was built and in service at the new \"Snow Basin ski park\". In 1940, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) crew built the first access road to the new resort, allowing easy access for the general public.\n\nIn the 50's Sam Huntington, from Berthoud Pass. Colorado, purchased the ski area from the City of Ogden and proceeded to expand the up-hill capacity beyond the Wildcat single seat wooden tower lift and the old rope tow. Overall, Sam installed a twin chair in place of the rope tow, and a platter-pull tow, later replaced by a twin chair, was installed at Porcupine to the left of the steep rocky face of Mt Ogden. \n\nIn 1957 the NCAA Skiing Championships was held at Snowbasin and the downhill race coarse was set on the right side, of the steep face of Mt Ogden, on the slope called \"John Paul Jones\" named after an early Snowbasin skier. The John Paul Jones' run was only accessible if one engaged in a 45 minute hike from the top of the Porcupine lift.\n\nAnderl Molterer, of the Austrian National Ski Team competing there that weekend, approached Sam Huntington and told him if a lift was built directly to the top of the John Paul Jones run he would bring his world famous Austrian National Ski Team to Snowbasin to train on it. Molterer said John Paul was the best downhill run in the world. \n\nHuntington said no he had other things to do. A lift to the top of John Paul was not to be built until Snowbasin received the rights to hold the Olympic Alpine Downhill Ski Races in 2002\n\nSam Huntington was killed a few years later as he was replacing an electrical fuse at the Porcupine lift. Several Ogden businessmen purchased Snowbasin from the Huntington family. \n\nOne other major personality to come out of Snowbasin was M. Earl Miller who ran the Snowbasin Ski School from the mid 50's until 1987. Earl Miller played a key role in drafting the Professional Ski Instructors of America (PSIA) American Ski Technique in 1961.\nPete Seibert, founder of Vail, led a partnership which bought \"Snow Basin\" in 1978, but ran into financial difficulty in 1984. The area was sold that October to Earl Holding, owner of Sun Valley in Idaho.\n\nBecause it was to serve as an Olympic venue site, the U.S. Congress passed the Snowbasin Land Exchange Act in 1996 as part of the Omnibus Lands Bill. The act transferred of National Forest System lands near the resort to the private ownership of Snowbasin, and identified a set of projects that were necessary for the resort to host the Olympic events.\n\nDuring the 2002 games Snowbasin hosted the downhill, combined (downhill and slalom), and super-G events. The spectator viewing areas consisted of a stadium at the foot of the run, with two sections of snow terraces for standing along both sides of the run. The spectator capacity was 22,500 per event; 99.1 percent of tickets were sold, and 124,373 spectators were able to view events at the Snowbasin Olympic venue. During the 2002 Winter Paralympics, Snowbasin hosted the Alpine Skiing events, including downhill, super-G, slalom, and giant slalom.\n\n\n\n\nGrizzly Center Retail and Rentals: 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2253942", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2253942", "title": "Tenpole Tudor", "text": "Tenpole Tudor\n\nTenpole Tudor are an English punk band fronted by Edward Tudor-Pole. The band first came to prominence when Tudor-Pole appeared in the Sex Pistols' film \"The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle\" and on three of the singles released from the soundtrack. The band then went on to have hits in their own right with songs like \"Swords of a Thousand Men\" and \"Wünderbar\". The band has been active intermittently since 1977.\n\nTenpole Tudor formed in 1977 when Tudor-Pole (vocals/saxophone) met guitarist Bob Kingston, bassist Dick Crippen, and drummer Gary Long. They played regularly for several years until Tudor-Pole himself (under the moniker of Eddie Tenpole) came to prominence by appearing in the 1980 film, \"The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle\" (filmed in 1978). He was originally billed as a replacement for Sex Pistols singer Johnny Rotten — performing the songs \"Who Killed Bambi?\", \"The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle\" and a cover version of \"Rock Around The Clock\" for the film and subsequent soundtrack — however, manager Malcolm McLaren and the remaining Sex Pistols instead decided to abandon the group and go their own ways.\n\nTenpole Tudor recorded a single on WEA Records with the A-side being \"Real Fun\" and the B-side \"What's In A Word\". \"Real Fun\" is available in live form on two different CDs, but the single was never released on CD. Tenpole Tudor returned in 1980 and signed a recording contract with Stiff Records, with whom they released the single \"3 Bells in a Row\" (which is a slightly different version of the one later found on the album \"Eddie, Old Bob, Dick, and Gary\") and was produced by Dick Crippen.\n\nThe band released their début album, \"Eddie, Old Bob, Dick and Gary\", in 1981. It sold well, and in addition to the popular \"3 Bells in a Row\", launched two additional hit singles \"Wünderbar\" and \"Swords of a Thousand Men\". In the same year, the group released their second album, \"Let the Four Winds Blow\", which also performed well. They further distinguished themselves with their oddball live performances, which had band members often dressing in medieval garb, and Tudor-Pole himself in a full suit of chain mail armour. They also added Munch Universe, as he was named, to their line-up.\n\nStiff Canada released a Canada only album entitled \"Swords of a Thousand Men\" in 1981. This album was pressed by Attic Records in Toronto. This was a compilation of their other two albums, and included Eddie Tudorpole, Gary Long, Bob Kingston, Dick Crippen and Munch Universe. The album cover was of high quality, showing a photo taken by Kim Aldis of the band in suits of armour, standing in front of the relics of a castle. The videos for \"Swords of a Thousand Men\" and \"Wünderbar\" received regular airplay on Canadian TV. \n\nIn 1982, the original Tenpole Tudor broke up. While Tudor-Pole led a cajun-inspired version of Tenpole Tudor, the rest of the band released a single under the name The Tudors, minus Munch Universe. After the non-original incarnation of Tenpole Tudor failed, Tudor-Pole left Stiff Records and began performing in jazz and swing bands, eventually returning to acting. Tudor-Pole formed a new line-up of the band in 1985 featuring Mick (guitar), Matt (bass), Sean (saxophone/guitar), and Paul (drums).\n\nToday, Tudor-Pole concentrates partly on acting, but focuses mainly upon his new one-man-show, performing live shows described as a 'One Man Stadium Show'. He has re-formed Tenpole Tudor from time to time, notably in 2001, with Darrell Bath on guitar, Donagh O'Leary on bass and Ben Standage on drums. He currently performs his one-man live show throughout Britain and, in 2009, released a Tenpole Tudor album titled \"Made It This Far\".\n\nEd-Tudor Pole and Dick Crippen appeared onstage together for the first time in over 35 years in September 2016 in support of charities Rhythmix and Heads On . Bob Kingston is the brother of the former The Mo-dettes drummer June Miles-Kingston. Since 1988 Dick Crippen has owned and operated the Panther Recording Studio in Surrey, producing many rock, punk and garage bands such as Chelsea and Johnny Moped. He also plays guitar in The Weird Things.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

At the beginning of the twentieth century, Biescas highlighted in the region for its wool traditional textile industry, specialized in blankets and equipment for horses.\n\nSince the beginning of the nineties of the twentieth century, tourism has replaced the traditional economy of the town. Residents have been gradually leaving farming and agriculture to engage in construction and services. Currently Biescas constitutes an important touristic point in the central Pyrenees, both in summer and winter.\n\nThe oldest pieces of evidence from human presence in the Biescas municipality are Neolithic cists from the plain of Santa Engracia, which are estimated to be from the III millennium BC. One of them has been restored.\n\nBiescas began to form as a village in the Middle Ages, given its strategic location as a crossroads. The first document of its existence is a citation in the Cartulary of San Juan de la Peña, between 1020 and 1030 AC. In a document of 1391 it appears cited with the name of Biescas Sobirón.\nBiescas has always been a town endowed with royal privileges and had two ecclesiastical parishes: San Salvador and San Pedro. Although in the old ages it also had two other temples, the San Torcuato and St. Stephen churches. It is also documented that the hermitage of Santa Elena was reconstructed by King James I in 1253 and endowed with privileges by King Ferdinand in 1484 and King Charles V in 1525.\n\nIn the sixteenth century, King Philip II ordered to fortify the Santa Elena canyon to protect his kingdoms of possible threats from beyond the Pyrenees. To this end, The Castle of San Pedro was built in neighboring Jaca\nDuring the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) Biescas was almost razed. At the beginning of the conflict the town was quickly conquered by the rebel side and was involved in the Battle of Sabiñánigo, between September and November 1937. In this battle the 43rd and 27th divisions of the army of the Spanish Second Republic launched an offensive against the rebels, specifically against the I brigade of the 51st National Division and local volunteers such as the Valley Tena Panthers. Biescas was recovered by Republican troops at the beginning of the offensive. It is estimated that during the course of the Battle of Sabiñánigo, the total number of deaths (soldiers and civilians) was around 6,000 people.\n\nIn August 1996, 86 people died due to a flood in \"Las Nieves\" camping.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is known for his role as Phil Mitchell in the BBC soap opera \"EastEnders\", which he has played since 1990. He was also the presenter of fighting series \"Britain's Hardest\".\n\nMcFadden was born in Maida Vale, London on 20 March 1959, the only child of Barbara (née Mallet) and Robert Reid. His parents separated soon afterwards and his mother later married a man called John McFadden, from whom Steve took his surname.\n\nHe left school in 1975 and over the next few years had short stints in jobs including labouring, carrot picking, plumbing and working at a builder's merchant. None of these occupations gave him much satisfaction, so he decided to sell his motorbike and hitch-hike around Europe. He spent several months camping out in Montpellier, France, on land earmarked for development as a football stadium. He then returned to London and felt that the city was too repressive for his liking, so he went to a job centre and asked for a job \"with a meaning\".\n\nMcFadden's first job after his return to London was on the \"Acorn Project\", a scheme for blind people which involved attending college. He gained 'O' and 'A' Level passes in sociology and politics before enrolling at the Polytechnic of North London on an economics course. Just seven weeks after starting, he decided that the course was not for him, and withdrew himself from university. He decided that he wanted to become an actor and was accepted into the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in 1984, and in his first year there won a prize for creating his own drama piece called \"Best Fight\" - which included many characters who were based on his own friends from school.\n\nAfter graduating from RADA in 1987, he made his acting debut playing a small role in the 1988 television film \"The Firm\". That same year, he had an uncredited brief appearance in the film \"Buster\" as a gang member. This was followed by appearances in the television series \"The Bill\", \"Minder\" and \"Bergerac\".\n\nMcFadden then rose to fame for portraying the role of Phil Mitchell in the BBC soap opera \"EastEnders\". He joined \"EastEnders\" at the beginning of 1990, at the same time as Ross Kemp, who played Phil's younger brother Grant Mitchell. During that time, his character was involved in numerous storylines, such as Sharongate (where it was revealed that he had an affair with his brother's wife Sharon) in 1994, and the Who Shot Phil? storyline in March 2001; where his character was shot and wounded by a mystery attacker.

He left \"EastEnders\" in late 2003 for a one-year break to concentrate on pantomimes. His character was written out of the series after being framed for an armed robbery by Den Watts (played by Leslie Grantham), and going on the run after breaking out of prison. During his break from \"EastEnders\", he presented the reality fighting series \"Britain's Hardest\" which was an underground competition broadcast on Sky One. He returned to \"EastEnders\" for two episodes in April 2005. In the story, Phil returned to Walford in need of financial help, only to be arrested and returned to prison. In October 2005, he returned on a permanent basis, after his character was cleared of armed robbery.\n\nIn 2007, he appeared in the film \"Provoked\". He has also appeared as Captain Hook in a pantomime production of \"Peter Pan\" from 2010 to 2011 at The Swan. From 2012 to 2013, he appeared in \"Aladdin\", playing Abanazar, at the Orchard Theatre.\n\nMcFadden has five children. His son Matt McFadden's mother is Sue Marshall, and Angela Bostock is the mother of his daughters Teona and Mollie Jane. Rachel Sidwell gave birth to his daughter Amelie Tinkerbell on 29 June 2009. At the time she was his partner, but the couple split two months later. A fifth child, a daughter named Frankie, was born to his girlfriend Karen Cairns in June 2016.\n\nMcFadden supports Manchester United. He is an active sailor, and took part in the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant in his motorboat 'Barbara'.\n\nIn 2014, he successfully sued the Metropolitan Police and \"News of the World\" after a police officer sold details about him to the newspaper. He sued \"News of the World\" after one of their journalists admitted trying to intercept his voicemail messages. McFadden stated \"I am particularly concerned that a police officer sold my privacy to a tabloid newspaper for profit. I consider the payment of damages and public apology will go some way to ensuring respect for my and others' privacy in future. I am glad to have been vindicated and to be able to put this matter behind me.\"\n"}

Initially held at Texas Christian University, the competition has been held at the Bass Performance Hall since 2001. The competition is named in honour of Van Cliburn, who won the first International Tchaikovsky Competition, in 1958.\n\nThe Van Cliburn Competition is held once every four years, in the year following the United States presidential elections. The winners and runners-up receive substantial cash prizes, plus concert tours at world-famous venues where they are able to perform pieces of their choice. While Cliburn was alive, he did not serve as a judge in the competition, provide financial support, or work in its operations. However, he attended performances by competitors regularly and greeted them afterwards on occasion.\n\nContestants draw lots for their performing place in the competition. The competition began on-line audio streaming of the performances in 1997. In 2009, the competition webcast all of the performances live for the first time in its history.\n\nThe competition consists up to three full recital programs, new work performance, chamber music, and two concertos for each competitor.\n\nWinners of the top prize awarded in the given year (linking to the article about the given competition):\n\nIn 1999, the competition added an amateur edition, which allows high-performing pianists aged 35 or above to participate, provided that they do not earn their main source of income through piano pedagogy or performance. Amateur competitions have been held in 2000, 2002, 2004, 2007, 2011, and 2016. Originally, the 2016 Amateur Competition was to be held in 2015, but was canceled, due to the inauguration of a junior version of the Cliburn Competition, which attracts top-performing teenage piano students from around the globe. Like the regular Cliburn Competition, the amateur and junior competitions consist of solo rounds, followed by concerto performances with the Fort Worth Symphony Orchestra in the finals.\n\n\n"}

He is also well-read in occult matters and has access to several weapons that are especially potent against vampires, werewolves and other supernatural creatures.\n\nThunstone has a sword-cane with a silver blade said to have been forged by Saint Dunstan, patron saint of silversmiths and a noted opponent of the Devil. The blade is inscribed with a text from Judges chapter 5 in the Vulgate, \"Sic pereant omnes inimici tui\" — \"thus perish all your enemies\". The sword-cane had also been used by Wellman's earlier character, Judge Pursuivant, who passed it on to Thunstone when his advanced age made him too weak to effectively wield it.\n\nIn addition to the ghosts and other traditional supernatural beings, several of Thunstone's enemies are Wellman's unique creations. These include the \"shonokins\", a race of human-like creatures who claim to have ruled North America before the coming of humans. Thunstone's most persistent foe is a sorcerer named Rowley Thorne, who appears in a number of the stories.\n\nThunstone originally appeared in short stories published in the pulp magazines.

{"id": "2253990", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2253990", "title": "Renard series", "text": "Renard series\n\nRenard series are a system of preferred numbers dividing an interval from 1 to 10 into 5, 10, 20, or 40 steps. This set of preferred numbers was proposed in 1877 by French army engineer Colonel Charles Renard. His system was adopted by the ISO in 1949 to form the ISO Recommendation R3, first published in 1953 or 1954, which evolved into the international standard ISO 3.\nThe factor between two consecutive numbers in a Renard series is approximately constant (before rounding), namely the 5th, 10th, 20th, or 40th root of 10 (approximately 1.58, 1.26, 1.12, and 1.06, respectively), which leads to a geometric sequence. This way, the maximum relative error is minimized if an arbitrary number is replaced by the nearest Renard number multiplied by the appropriate power of 10. One application of the Renard series of numbers is to current rating of electric fuses. Another common use is the voltage rating of capacitors (e.g. 100 V, 160 V, 250 V, 400 V, 630 V).\n\nThe most basic R5 series consists of these five rounded numbers, which are powers of the fifth root of 10, rounded to two digits. The Renard numbers are not always rounded to the closest three-digit number to the theoretical geometric sequence:\n\n\nIf a finer resolution is needed, another five numbers are added to the series, one after each of the original R5 numbers, and one ends up with the R10 series. These are rounded to a multiple of 0.05. Where an even finer grading is needed, the R20, R40, and R80 series can be applied. The R20 series is usually rounded to a multiple of 0.05, and the R40 and R80 values interpolate between the R20 values, rather than being powers of the 80th root of 10 rounded correctly. In the table below, the additional R80 values are written to the right of the R40 values in the column named \"R80 add'l\". The R40 numbers 3.00 and 6.00 are higher than they \"should\" be by interpolation, in order to give rounder numbers.\n\nIn some applications more rounded values are desirable, either because the numbers from the normal series would imply an unrealistically high accuracy, or because an integer value is needed (e.g., the number of teeth in a gear). For these needs, more rounded versions of the Renard series have been defined in ISO 3. In the table below, rounded values that differ from their less rounded counterparts are shown in bold.\n\nAs the Renard numbers repeat after every 10-fold change of the scale, they are particularly well-suited for use with SI units. It makes no difference whether the Renard numbers are used with metres or millimetres. But one would need to use an appropriate number base to avoid ending up with two incompatible sets of nicely spaced dimensions, if for instance they were applied with both inches and feet. In the case of inches and feet a root of 12 would be desirable, that is, where \"n\" is the desired number of divisions within the major step size of twelve. Similarly, a base of two, eight, or sixteen would fit nicely with the binary units commonly found in computer science.\n\nEach of the Renard sequences can be reduced to a subset by taking every \"n\"th value in a series, which is designated by adding the number \"n\" after a slash. For example, \"R10″/3 (1…1000)\" designates a series consisting of every third value in the R″10 series from 1 to 1000, that is, 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, 30, 60, 120, 250, 500, 1000.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2253993", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2253993", "title": "Bad Boys Blue", "text": "Bad Boys Blue\n\nBad Boys Blue are a multinational pop group that was formed in Cologne, Germany. The group performed many international hits including \"You're a Woman\", \"Pretty Young Girl\", \"I Wanna Hear Your Heartbeat\", and \"Come Back and Stay\".\n\nBad Boys Blue was formed in the summer of 1984 by German producer Tony Hendrik and his lyricist wife Karin van Haaren. The original trio consisted of Jamaican Trevor \"Supa T\" Taylor (the original lead vocalist), Briton John McInerney, and American Andrew Thomas. Their debut single \"L.O.V.E. In My Car\" failed to make an impression in the pop charts but the follow-up \"You're a Woman\" was a success, reaching the top 10 in many European countries.\n\nThe group became massively popular in Eastern Europe and South Africa, with the band performing to sell-out crowds in Russia and Ukraine. In contrast, the group never charted in the UK, and their only charting U.S. singles were \"Save Your Love\" (1993) and \"Luv 4 U\" (1994) which became successful chart hits. Those singles were from two of their albums that were released stateside: \"Bad Boys Blue\" (1993) and \"To Blue Horizons\" (1994).\n\nThe group has experienced numerous line-up changes. In 1988, Trevor Taylor left the group a year after being gradually demoted from his role of the lead singer. He was asked to rejoin the group the following year just for recording sessions for the \"Hungry for Love\" single that was to be featured on the group's first compilation album \"Bad Boys Best\". Trevor Taylor's departure permanently secured John McInerney's position as the band's new lead vocalist. Trevor Taylor was replaced by Trevor Bannister (born August 5, 1965 in Grimsby, England), whose function in the group was mainly to perform Trevor Taylor's hits in live gigs. It is during Bannister's tenure with the band that Bad Boys Blue began touring in Eastern Europe thus gaining much popularity there. Trevor Bannister left in 1993 and the remaining two members performed as a duo. During its entire South African tour, the duo was briefly joined by Owen Standing, who left the group shortly thereafter, and therefore was not considered to be a permanent band member. Multi-talented Irmo Russel (born March 15, 1956 in Aruba, Caribbean Sea) joined the group in 1995, who in addition to stepping into Bannister's shoes was instrumental in revitalizing the group's creative potential, by becoming a composer, video director, and occasionally assuming the role of lead singer on some of the tracks. At the end of 1999, Kevin McCoy (stage name JoJo Max) replaced Irmo Russel by joining Bad Boys Blue full-time after being the group's rapper since 1998, but left in early 2003 leaving Bad Boys Blue as a duo again. However, in 2005, Kevin McCoy rejoined Andrew Thomas' Bad Boys Blue line-up.\n\nIn 2005, McInerney and Thomas split under less than amicable circumstances. Andrew Thomas went on to form an all-American version of Bad Boys Blue with former member Kevin McCoy and new lead singer (no relation), and they were said to be working on a new release, with Kevin McCoy being the trio's producer. Andrew Thomas' formation of the band was named \"The Real Bad Boys Blue\". Their shows were based on the full playback including original music produced by original producers, lead vocals by John McInerney and backing vocals by studio session singers.\n\nJohn McInerney kept performing as Bad Boys Blue; at first he performed solo with a live group and backing singers but in the following year he was joined by Carlos Ferreira (born April 11, 1969 in Mozambique), and this presently UK-based, duo set out to work on a new album, with the French producers MS Project.\n\nTrevor Taylor, the original lead singer of Bad Boys Blue, died of a heart attack in his home in Cologne on January 19, 2008 at the age of 50.\n\nBad Boys Blue, in May 2008, released a brand new album called \"Heart & Soul\" with 13 new original songs. The album was supported by the release of two maxi-singles: \"Still in Love\" and \"Queen of my Dreams\". In May 2009 this formation resumed cooperation with its original label, Coconut Music, in addition to working with its current production team.\n\nThe Real Bad Boys Blue, in June 2008, experienced significant changes in personnel. This formation was essentially split in two when Herb McCoy left the group to continue performing solo, but under his own name, using his own versions of some Bad Boys Blue songs. At the same time, Kevin McCoy became the new lead singer of the remaining duo, and a new member, Jeremy Cummins, was added to this group's line-up. This version of the group completed recording of several brand new tracks, all penned and sung by Kevin McCoy.\n\nOn June 19, 2009, Coconut Music/Sony Music released a special remix album titled \"Rarities Remixed\". The album contained modern remixes of some hit singles and album tracks.\n\nOn July 21, 2009, Andrew Thomas died in Cologne at the age of 63. John McInerney is now the only member alive from the original line-up of Bad Boys Blue.\n\nOn October 30, 2009, Coconut Music/Sony BMG released a special compilation titled \"Unforgettable\". The item was dedicated to both original members of Bad Boys Blue who died, Trevor Taylor and Andrew Thomas.\n\nOn August 13, 2010, Coconut Music/Modern Romantics Productions/Sony Music released the anniversary single titled \"Come Back And Stay Re-Recorded 2010\" including remixes produced by MS Project, Alex Twister, Spinnin Elements & Almighty. On August 27, 2010, the said labels released the anniversary album titled “25” including 25 Re-Recorded hits, 7 brand new remixes plus bonus DVD.\n\nIn September 2011, John has made the decision to finish working with Carlos.\n\nIn October 2011, the group was joined by Kenny \"Krayzee\" Lewis, known from collaboration with C.C.Catch, Touché, and Mark 'Oh.\n\nLate in the year 2011, John has made the decision to finish working with \"Krayzee\".\n\nOn September 21 (2012) Coconut Music released a DVD titled \"Live On TV\".\n\nIn December 2013, Bad Boys Blue announced on their Facebook page that they are working on a new album. Some of the songs are already completed and the remainder will be complete by January/February 2014. Some of the songwriters will be: Pawel Marciniak, Mattias Canerstam and Johann Perrier.\n\nIn June 2015, Bad Boys Blue released a new album titled \"30.\" It contains four new and four unreleased songs, along with some remixes of older songs.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It operated briefly in 1987, but was shut down after only a few months of operation and its non-commercial educational broadcast license ultimately revoked.\n\nIt replaced KVST-TV, a television broadcaster which broadcast on channel 68 for less than two years.\n\nChannel 68 was used originally by the Viewer Sponsored Television Foundation as KVST-TV: a television station in Los Angeles which broadcast from May 5, 1974 through December 23, 1975.\n\nAfter KCET originally went on the air in 1964 its owners, Community Television of Southern California, had sought Los Angeles' second non-commercial television allocation on UHF channel 58. The Los Angeles Unified School District and the Viewer Sponsored Television Foundation had also filed applications for the channel. Eventually, the FCC gave the construction permit for channel 58 to the School District to build KLCS, a secondary PBS member station launched in 1973.\n\nThe FCC, however, was impressed with the public television concept of the Viewer Sponsored Television Foundation and allocated a third non-commercial channel (UHF 68) to Los Angeles so that a construction permit could be awarded to build and launch KVST.\n\nKVST signed on in 1974. Billed as a significant experiment in using television to promote social change, KVST-TV operated by checking out portable video recorders (the only type which existed then was the Sony Portapak, a 1/2\" reel-to-reel machine with a separate camera) to community organizations which were \"on the cutting edge of social change\". Members of these organizations would document their meetings and proactive solutions to various issues within the communities which they served. This material would then be edited into viewable TV programs for broadcast.\n\nThe aim was to \"put television in the hands of the people\" inside a major TV market, in what was a forerunner of today's public-access television. Traditionally, such programming could be found mainly on local cable TV.\n\nOne of KVST's notable programs included the first television appearance of the new wave rock group Oingo Boingo in 1975.\n\nDue to technical problems (such as transmitting the audio channel too high from the video channel), underfunding and constant internal political strife (the station went through three managements in its short lifespan), KVST signed-off after only 19 months on the air. The channel would remain dark for over a decade.\n\nIn 1983, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) authorized the Black Television Workshop to construct a non-commercial TV station on channel 68 in the Los Angeles area. The station, which was oriented to black and Hispanic viewers, went on the air in May 1987 as KDDE, changed its call letters to KEEF-TV on June 15, and was shut down on August 8 by the FCC's Mass Media Bureau. Most viewers were unaware of KDDE/KEEF, as the station was never listed in \"TV Guide\" or the \"Los Angeles Times\" TV listings.\n\nThe Bureau alleged that the station had used different antennas and antenna height than what was authorized by the FCC. Later, other questions about the broadcaster arose (including a dispute over control of the station), and on June 23, 1993 Black Television Workshop's permit was revoked.\n\nAccording to an article appearing in the \"Los Angeles Times\" Calendar section, unsuccessful efforts were made in the early 1990s to restart Channel 68 as a Hispanic Christian TV station.\n\nChannel 68 was last used in Southern California by KRCA-DT, a digital simulcast of KRCA (channel 62) in Riverside, California. As of the end of the 2009 digital television transition, channel 68 was outside the authorized band for television broadcasting in the United States; KRCA now transmits on channel 35. Plans for the digital transition did not include a digital replacement channel for the former channel 68 allocation in Los Angeles.\n\n"}

One of the reasons that the country was founded was to address Lennon's then-ongoing immigration problems (the previous week he received a deportation order) through satirical means.\n\nThere is no leadership and not all citizenships have been recorded. As a result, the population is unknown.\n\nNutopia is a portmanteau of \"new\" and \"utopia\" which suggests Nutopia is a new, utopian society.\n\nOn 2 April 1973 (next day after April Fool's Day), Lennon and Ono introduced the conceptual country of Nutopia at a press conference in New York City.\n\nThe Lennons were ambassadors of the country and sought (creatively, though unsuccessfully) diplomatic immunity to end Lennon's ongoing immigration troubles, as he and Ono tried to remain in the United States. (Ono already had a Resident Alien \"green card\" through her previous husband, Tony Cox. Lennon had been denied permanent residence status). Lennon talked about the imaginary country, which would live up to the ideals of his song \"Imagine\", saying this in the \"official\" declaration (signed the day before):\nWe announce the birth of a conceptual country, NUTOPIA. Citizenship of the country can be obtained by declaration of your awareness of NUTOPIA. NUTOPIA has no land, no boundaries, no passports, only people. NUTOPIA has no laws other than cosmic. All people of NUTOPIA are ambassadors of the country. As two ambassadors of NUTOPIA, we ask for diplomatic immunity and recognition in the United Nations of our country and its people.\nIn 2006, a Nutopia website was created that forwarded to a site about the documentary \"The U.S. vs. John Lennon\", distributed by Lions Gate Entertainment.\n\nThe flag of Nutopia has only one colour: white. At the press conference Lennon, waving a white tissue, stated, \"This is the flag of Nutopia—we surrender, to peace and to love\". According to a reporter for \"The New York Times\", Lennon blew his nose on the tissue. Some criticised this association with surrender, but Lennon and Ono defended the association, saying that only through surrender and compromise could peace be achieved.\n\nLennon's album \"Mind Games\" (1973) features the \"Nutopian International Anthem\", which is four seconds of silence. \n\nThe hand-drawn Great Seal of Nutopia features a picture of a seal balancing a yin-yang globe on its nose.\n\nA plaque engraved with the words \"NUTOPIAN EMBASSY\" was installed at the back (kitchen) entrance to the Dakota apartment where Lennon and Ono lived. Ono remarked decades later that guests preferred walking into her home through that door instead of the front entrance.\n\nFinnish singer-songwriter Kari Peitsamo, fan of Lennon's work, released a song called \"Nutopia\" on his album \"\".\n\nIn 2009 a exhibit in New York displayed the letter that established Nutopia.\n\n"}

They currently play in the Serie A, the top-flight football league in the country, and is one of two clubs from Cuenca to have played in the top-flight (the other being LDU Cuenca).\n\nHistorically an undistinguished club in Ecuador, they have had a recent string of success in the Serie A. They are one of two clubs outside Quito and Guayaquil to have a national championship, which they won in 2004. Since then, they have been a near consistent top club in the country, including numerous Copa Libertadores participations.\n\nDeportivo Cuenca was founded on March 4, 1971 and is the second oldest club in the city after Tecni Club. Their home stadium is Estadio Alejandro Serrano Aguilar, which was named after former club president and mayor of Cuenca. Because of the limited number of clubs from the Province of Azuay that have played in the Serie A, Deportivo Cuenca has no major local rivals.\n\nIn 1970 desire was born to form a professional soccer team in the city of Cuenca. This desire was shaped through Dr Alejandro Serrano Aguilar (mayor of the city then) and the gentlemen Polivio Vázquez and Alfredo Pena. The citizen's endorsement was immediate before the initiative headed by the mayor, therefore the Commission of Sports was satisfied to the gentlemen Gilbert Sotomayor, Ricardo Ordóñez and Bolívar Lupercio, whose first management was to obtain the acceptance of the Ecuadorian Federation of Soccer so that the professional team of the city could participate in the professional level. By means of the session celebrated in February 1971 in the \"Salón de la Ciudad\" of the Very Illustrious Municipality of Cuenca, the project became a reality, and it was then that Deportivo Cuenca was born. A month later, the Association of Soccer funded the Asociación de Fútbol no Amateur del Azuay (AFA) (Association of Soccer non-Amateur of Azuay). As club the first decisions were taken: the uniform would be red and yellow with a T-shirt to vertical rays, the first Technical Director was Carlos Alberto Raffo, the first contracted foreign soccer players were Rodolfo Piazza, the Paraguayan Luis Martínez who achieved the first team's goal, and Gerald Laterza. In its start the team was known as the \"Franela Roja\" (Red Bandana).\n\nOriginally, and throughout most of its existence, the team was never a contender to the title, and never received much attention internationally, such as in the prestigious Copa Libertadores. Deportivo Cuenca had a brief successful period during the 1970s, becoming runner-up twice in 1975 & 1976. The favorable finishes allowed them to participate the next years Copa Libertadores. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the club was in-and-out of the second tier Serie B. They returned to the Serie A in 2003, and in 2004, they became the second club outside Quito or Guayaquil to win the national championship. Since then, they have finished in the top three in three of four seasons, allowing them to participate in five of the past six Copa Libertadores.\n\nDeportivo Cuenca's historical kit has been red shirts with black shorts. Alternate kits, like most teams in Ecuador, varied from year to year. The badge of the team includes elements of the seal of the city of Cuenca.\n\nIn 2004, Deportivo Cuenca would win its first championship in its history. The process began with Argentine coach Daniel Córdoba, who joined the club's Javier Klimowicz, Marcelo Velazco, and national Giancarlos Ramos. After a successful first stage, halfway through the league, coach Cordoba abandoned Cuenca already qualified for the playoffs, and contracted its replacement Julio \"Turco\" Asad.\nThe title was secured on December 8 of 2004, with two games left in the tournament, when Deportivo Cuenca with 19.5 points, was unreachable for Barcelona and Olmedo who were runner up. That day Cuenca won 3–2 to Aucas in Quito, but the celebration began after the end of the game between El Nacional, and LDU Quito. The tie produced between those competitors allowed the \"Morlacos\" to be unreachable. Fans took to the streets to celebrate, thousands of vehicles blew their horns, with explosions of rockets and fireworks in the sky. The conquest had caused such a joy in the fans that it forced the opening of the stadium where thousands of fans cheered the team. Prior to that there was a motorcade from the airport to the Alejandro Serrano Aguilar Stadium.\n\nThe club has several nicknames, the best known is \"\"Morlacos\"\", and \"\"Expresso Austral\"\" (Southern Express), the first is because people belonging to the city of Cuenca are commonly called so, the second was placed by the national press in the 1970s due to the campaigns being undertaken by the team, calling the team the southern train, a southern Express, as a visual depiction of overpassing its opponents.\n\nIt is also popularly called \"Red\" because of its kit shirt. The club was well known in its infancy, as \"Red Flannel\" because of the fabric and the color of their clothing. It is less commonly recognized as the \"\"lion\"\" because this is also the symbol of the city and is present in the emblem of the institution.\n\n\nIn Serie A:\n\n\nDeportivo Cuenca has had two players become the top scorer of the Serie A, with one player repeating the feat. The club's all-time top goalscorer is Ángel Luis Liciardi with 132 goals.\n\n\nArgentine Julio Asad is the only manager to win a title with Deportivo Cuenca, who led them to the Serie A title in 2004.\n\n"}

Afterwards the band toured Europe and opened for bands including Heaven Shall Burn and Caliban.\n\nIn November 2001, Maroon entered Rape of Harmonies Studios to record their debut full-length, \"Antagonist\", released on US vegan straight edge hardcore label Catalyst Records.\n\nAfter some line-up changes Maroon switched labels to Alveran Records in 2003, who then re-released \"Antagonist\". February 2004 saw the band at Denmark's Antfarm Studio recording a new full-length album entitled \"Endorsed by Hate\". Following the recording, original guitarist Marc Zech left the band, and was replaced by Sebastian Rieche. The album was released in Europe in June, and between June and December 2004 Maroon played 60 shows across Europe, including major festivals such as With Full Force and Pressure Fest. In October, the band switched labels again, signing to Century Media Records. In early 2005, Century Media/Abacus released \"Endorsed by Hate\" in North America.\n\nIn March 2006, Century Media released Maroon's fourth full-length album \"When Worlds Collide\". October 2007 saw the release of their second album for Century Media titled \"The Cold Heart of the Sun\", and their latest, \"Order\", was released on April 20, 2009.\n\nAfter Sebastian Rieche and Nick Wachsmuth left in April 2011, the band was on a hold. Despite announcing a new album, they split up after a final tour in 2014.\n\nTheir songs \"Wake up in Hell\", \"The Omega Suite Pt. II\" and \"At the Gates of Demise\" were featured in the movie Zombie Strippers.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2254018", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2254018", "title": "Ghost in the Shell (video game)", "text": "Ghost in the Shell (video game)\n\nThe game's story and art design were written and illustrated by Masamune Shirow, the author of the original manga. \"Ghost in the Shell\"s plot revolves around a recruit of Public Security Section 9 as he investigates and combats the Human Liberation Front. The player controls a Fuchikoma, a robotic fighting vehicle capable of traversing walls and ceilings.\n\nThe game received mainly positive reviews. It was praised for its graphics, animation, music and unusual wall-climbing mechanics. However, it received criticism for its tedious and repetitive gameplay and low difficulty. Fifteen years after its release, \"Game Informer\" listed \"Ghost in the Shell\" as one of the best manga and anime-based games.\n\nThe player controls a spider-shaped think tank robot, known as Fuchikoma, that is able to jump, thrust forward, strafe to the side, climb walls, and hang upside-down from ceilings. The camera auto-adjusts its position when scaling walls and ceilings for easy maneuvering, and automatically switches between first and third-person perspectives depending on the environment, although the player can stay in first-person view at will.\n\nThe Fuchikoma is equipped with twin machine guns and guided missiles. Both weapons have unlimited ammunition, however up to six missiles can be launched at once after a charge time. Grenades can be found throughout missions and a maximum of three can be carried at a time. Enemies vary from humanoid robots to helicopters and sport an array of firearms and explosives. Some stages of the game are governed by a time limit. Seventeen cutscenes can be unlocked throughout the missions and depending on the player's score in training mode. Once unlocked, the cutscenes can be reviewed on the options menu.\n\nThe training mode contains six stages to learn the basic game elements. The first five stages introduce the player to targets in various settings and using the controls effectively, with the sixth being a battle against another Fuchikoma. The twelve missions that compose the story take place in different environments, including a warehouse complex, a sewer, the city highways, and the enemy base inside of a skyscraper. The missions display a variety of gameplay objectives: the first mission is a raid; the third level is an Explosive Ordnance Disposal mission that involves the elimination of bombs attached to red barrels; the fourth level is a sea chase on a boat; the fifth level is a game of hide-and-seek with the player having to locate a boss wearing thermoptical camouflage; and the game's final boss fight ends with a free fall battle down the skyscraper under a timer. \n\nThe plot follows the members of Public Security Section 9, mainly consisting of Major Motoko Kusanagi, Chief Aramaki, Batou, Togusa, Ishikawa, Saito, and a nameless male, the Rookie, controlled by the player. The game's story is told using mission briefings and animated cutscenes.\n\nAfter the terrorist organization known as the Human Liberation Front claims responsibility for blowing up the Megatech Body Corporation building, Section 9 is sent to resolve the situation. Section 9 is able to trace the terrorists' communications and find their location in the bay area; however, it is a trap. Chief Aramaki later announces that the leader of the Human Liberation Front is a mercenary known as Zebra 27. Ishikawa then reports that the Energy Ministry is interested in files relating to Zebra; Aramaki orders further investigation.\n\nThe Rookie's skill is put to the test, leading chase missions and surviving an ambush. Eventually, the Human Liberation Front's secret base is discovered in Aeropolis II tower by following the enemy supply line, along with the terrorists' intentions of using a nuclear reactor. Ishikawa informs Aramaki that an official of the Energy Ministry named Sawamura has been in contact with Zebra and is connected to Megatech Body Corporation. While conducting the raid on the enemy's base, the reactor begins to overload. In order to shut it down, squad leader Motoko Kusanagi attempts to remove the protective barrier from an access point nearby, as the rest of the team search for the other building's control room. After disarming the reactor, Kusanagi locates the leader on top of the tower. Batou and Togusa encounter obstacles that prevent them from moving to the top, leaving the Rookie as the only available member. Once he reaches the top, he engages the leader in combat and defeats him in a free fall battle off of the tower.\n\nAfter the mission, it is revealed that Sawamura planned to collect bribes from Megatech in exchange for covering up a defect in the nuclear reactor, which was going to explode, and presenting it as a terrorist attack; however, Zebra seized the reactor to take it over and wanted to extort money from Sawamura. Kusanagi declares the entire experience as at least good training for the Rookie and acknowledges the Rookie's cleverness, but criticizes the overdependence on the Fuchikoma.\n\nThe concept for the Fuchikoma came from one climactic scene of the film: the battle between Motoko Kusanagi and the big spider-like tank in the museum of paleontology. Based on this tank design, mecha creators Shōji Kawamori and Atsushi Takeuchi made a smaller version, designed for one person, that would be used by the police. Thus, the player becomes the pilot of one of these combat machines.\n\nThe game was in development for one and a half years, and involved the work of several divisions, being Kenji Sawaguchi and Tetsuji Yamamoto the total director and producer respectively. The programming was done by Exact, known for the \"Jumping Flash!\" series. \"Ghost in the Shell\" was designed and targeted to a mature audience; developers did not make Motoko playable to prevent the game appearing to be a character-based game for children. The original manga's creator Masamune Shirow was the main designer of the characters and mecha for the game.\n\nAt Production I.G, Hiroyuki Kitakubo directed the animation scenes, wrote the screenplay and did the storyboards; Toshihiro Kawamoto was animation supervisor and a character designer. The scenes are noticeably different when compared to the film namesake directed by Mamoru Oshii, because the game is colored using a full digital technique. The scenes are a combination of cel animation and backgrounds that were rendered in three dimensions to ensure smooth transitions for the camera movement. Adobe Photoshop was used to add the finishing details to the scenes.\n\nThe Japanese voicing of the game was done by a different cast than the film's: Motoko Kusanagi was played by Hiromi Tsuru, Batou by Shinji Ogawa, Chief Aramaki by Soichi Ito, Ishikawa by Kiyoshi Kobayashi, Togusa by Hirotaka Suzuoki, Saito by Nobuyuki Hiyama, and the Fuchikoma were voiced by Katsue Miwa. The English localization was dubbed by the same cast used for the original movie, although the game does not specify the respective roles in the credits. Motoko was voiced by Mimi Woods, Batou by Richard Epcar, Aramaki by William Frederick, and Togusa by Christopher Joyce; the roles of Bob Papenbrook, Wendee Lee, Jimmy Krakor and Julie Maddalena are not reliably known. \n\nThe game was originally released in Japan by Sony Computer Entertainment on July 17, 1997. The following day, a launch party was held at the Yebisu Garden Hall: the Megatech Body Night. The event featured the game's music artists Takkyu Ishino, Joey Beltram and Mijk van Dijk performing live, and a Fuchikoma robot appeared. All who bought tickets received a papercraft kit of the Fuchikoma and ten posters of the game were raffled. A Japanese demo disc was also released with the first mission playable.\n\nThe first edition of \"Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine\" was published in October 1997 and featured the game on its cover. Having acquired the North American license to publish \"Ghost in the Shell\" video games in mid-1996, THQ released the game in North America on October 31, 1997. It was released in Europe by Sony Computer Entertainment on July 1, 1998. THQ's producer Don Nauert said that aside from dubbing and changing the button configuration, the English localization of the game was not modified nor censored.\n\nThe soundtrack albums for the game were titled , named after the cybernetic body manufacturer in the \"Ghost in the Shell\" series. The albums were produced by Takkyu Ishino and feature techno tracks by other composers including Mijk van Dijk. Two versions of the albums were released by Sony Music Entertainment Japan on July 17, 1997: \"Megatech Body CD.\", a standard single disc; and \"Megatech Body CD., Ltd.\", a limited two-disc edition. \"Megatech Vinyl. Ltd.\" was a limited two LP record set scheduled to be released.\n\nKodansha released three books and one video about the game. was published on July 4, 1997; the artbook contains concept designs, scenes and commentary. Two guidebooks were published: on July 17, 1997, and on August 29, 1997. The video, , features interviews with the animation staff; it was released on VHS on April 22, 1998. A LaserDisc was also released in 1998 that included interviews on side A and the in-game cutscenes on side B.\n\n\"Ghost in the Shell\" gained an aggregate rating of 78.50% at GameRankings based on six reviews. \"AllGame\" praised the graphics, sound and gameplay; the review stated, \"Even with plenty of eye candy and strong audio, a game is nothing without actually being fun to play and as you've probably guessed, Ghost in the Shell supplies the fun, whether you're familiar with the license or not.\" GameSpot rated the game as good, eulogizing the controls as \"simple... most people will take to them like a fish to water\" and praising the animation sequences. \"GameFan\" reviewers cited the game's unique wall-scaling mechanics and stated that it lives up to the name of the \"Ghost in the Shell\" series. IGN said that the game was great, faithful to its manga counterpart, stating that \"the techno music, including tracks from artists like Derrick May and Hardfloor, is superb,\" but adding that \"the levels aren't incredibly difficult, and don't really encourage replay.\" \"Super GamePower\" reviewed the game short after the movie was released in Brazil, stating that the opening animation was better than the drawing of the film. In Russia, \"Velikij Drakon\" lauded the orientation system, the game graphics and the overall design, highlighting the unlockable animation scenes. \"NowGamer\" praised the gameplay mechanics but criticized the option to unlock, stating, \"The tremendous feeling of agility you get from Ghost In The Shell and the slick weapons is where the fun comes from. But it's a tough game and playing for more scenes of new footage will not be compelling enough for a country in which anime is a cult industry and not a national fixation.\"\n\n\"GamePro\" did not find the game worthy of its name, although the cutscenes were praised, stating, \"The cinemas at the opening of the game and between each level are stunning; however, the game graphics, particularly buildings and enemies, are lackluster at best. The sound effects are bland, and there are no weapon power-ups to be found. Put that all together and you get a very generic game.\" \"Next Generation\" said it is an enjoyable game but eventually begins to feel tedious. \"Computer and Video Games\" offered similar criticism, declaring that \"it was too repetitive to become anything more than a good game.\" \"Edge\" criticized the gameplay features such as camera control and boss difficulty. \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" reviewers criticized the game for its easy bosses and its repetitive and short gameplay value. \"Famitsu\" liked the battles but complained about the Fuchikoma attaching to walls when not intended.\n\n\"The Herald-News\" praised the game for being original and worth playing, unlike other movie adaptations. In 2013, \"Game Informer\" listed \"Ghost in the Shell\" as one of the best anime and manga-based games released in English, and the best of the franchise's titles; the other seven games in the list were released more than six years after \"Ghost in the Shell\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2254028", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2254028", "title": "Leather carving", "text": "Leather carving\n\nLeather carving is the process of giving a three-dimensional appearance to leather craft objects or works of art by cutting and stamping the surface.\n\nThe only type of leather suitable for carving is vegetable tanned, full grain leather. This is because the vegetable tanning process allows the leather to absorb water, which is used to soften the leather before the carving process, and the grain of the leather is necessary to allow the leather to hold the shape after the carving process is complete. Other leathers lack these two essential qualities.\nWhile the process of cutting into the leather and pushing the edges of the cuts in is relatively modern, marking wet leather has been around since the Roman period. There are some beautiful examples of Roman leather at Vindolanda near Hadrian's wall and the book \"Purses in Pieces\" is very informative with some lovely examples of medieval carved leather work. \nHistorically, tools for stamping leather would probably have been made out of bone, but would not have been too different from what we use today.\n\nThree main tools are used in leather carving:\n\n\nThis tool, which creates an impression similar to that of a sea shell, is used to add emphasis to areas of a carving, often in the stem or down the centre of a leaf in a floral design. It is used in a similar way to other stamping tools, by holding it vertically over the leather and striking with the rawhide mallet. When using the Camouflage tool, the impressions created should be equally spaced, starting from the centre of the design and working out towards the tips of the stems or leaves in the design. The impressions should get progressively lighter.\n\nThe Pear shader is used to press down areas of the design that need to appear curved. The action of the pear shader causes the leather tooled by it to appear slightly darker. The pear shader is slightly unusual in that it may be tilted during use to provide the desired effect. It should be moved only slightly between each tap with the mallet so that it creates a consistent shading of the leather.\n\nThis tool is used to create an indention on one side of a cut so that one side is raised. This tool, when used correctly, can produce very realistic results. There are many variations of this tool that include a variety of shapes, such as diamonds or ovals. There is also a variety of faces that include striped, checked, rounded, smoothed, and crosshatched\n\nThese tools create a curved impression of a series of short, closely spaced lines. They may be used interchangeably, the only difference being that the veiner creates a simple curved line, while the shell tool has a pattern resembling the edge of a scallop along the inside edge. They are used to continue to create the impression of depth created by the beveler, and to create the impression of a curved surface. These tools are used in the usual way, but like the pear shader, may also be tilted to help create the impression of depth where they are used beside a cut.\n\nThe seeder creates a small circular impression, that is used to represent seeds. As the face of this tool is so small, care must be taken when striking that you do not cut right through the leather. If stamping an area using this tool, stamp around the outside first, then fill in the centre.\n\nThis step in producing a carved leather article is used to emphasise the design, and is not even necessary in some cases. It consists of the pushing down of any areas of leather that have not been already carved. The background tool has a crosshatched pattern on its head, which has the effect of significantly darkening the leather it is used on. As with the seeder, the face of this tool is often small, so care must be taken not to strike it too hard.\n\nWhen using this tool, take care that the impressions created by it do not overlap, and also take care not to stamp into the design or over the border. When the entire face of the tool is not needed, or to create tidy corners, the tool can be tilted so only part of the face creates an impression.\n\nAll leather needs to be prepared a certain way for leather carvers to carve the leather. The leather carver will \"case\" the leather by soaking it in water, then letting it dry to the proper dampness, thus making the leather easier to tool. If the leather is too dry, impressions will fade over time, or will not be made to a consistent depth. Too wet, it will not hold a sharply defined carving. Properly cased leather feels cool to the touch, and has the feel, of firm, wet clay. A damp sponge can be used to maintain the dampness while tooling but should never be used to replace proper casing.\n\nWhen the leather has been properly cased, the swivel knife is used to make the bold cuts that form the backbone of the carved image. These cuts are made to a depth of up to approximately half the thickness of the leather being used, depending on the effect desired by the leather worker. Care must be taken during this step to keep the swivel knife vertical at all times, as any tilt is detrimental to the ability of the leather to be properly stamped later in the carving process.\n\nAfter shading is completed with the Pear Shader, the Beveler is used to compress one side of the cut. This creates the impression of depth by pressing down parts of the image relative to the foreground. The Beveler is used by holding it vertically, with the foot of the tool in contact with the leather, and striking it lightly with the rawhide mallet. The tool is then moved forward along the cut about half its width, and struck again with the mallet. This process is completed until the entire length of the cut has been appropriately beveled.\n\nAs a general rule, the outside of curves and the outside edge of anything overlapping another part of the design is beveled. The exception to this rule is leather that will later be stamped with another tool, and, if the background is to be treated with the background tool, the background itself.\n\nThis is the final step in creating a carved design. The swivel knife is again used to create small, decorative cuts in the design to enhance its appearance. These cuts may be made in parts of the design that have already been stamped, which is why it is necessary to leave this step until last.\n\n"}

It is studied as part of astrophysics and is commonly observed in space. The accepted view of scientists is that much of the baryonic matter in the universe exists in this state.\n\nWhen matter becomes sufficiently hot and energetic, it becomes ionized and forms a plasma. This process breaks matter into its constituent particles which includes negatively-charged electrons and positively-charged ions. These electrically-charged particles are susceptible to influences by local electromagnetic fields. This includes strong fields generated by stars, and weak fields which exist in star forming regions, in interstellar space, and in intergalactic space. Similarly, electric fields are observed in some stellar astrophysical phenomena, but they are inconsequential in very low-density gaseous mediums.\n\nAstrophysical plasma is often differentiated from space plasma, which typically refers to the plasma of the Sun, the solar wind, and the ionospheres and magnetospheres of the Earth and other planets.\n\nPlasmas in stars can both generate and interact with magnetic fields, resulting in a variety of dynamic astrophysical phenomena. These phenomena are sometimes observed in spectra due to the Zeeman effect. Other forms of astrophysical plasmas can be influenced by preexisting weak magnetic fields, whose interactions may only be determined directly by polarimetry or other indirect methods. In particular, the intergalactic medium, the interstellar medium, the interplanetary medium and solar winds consist of diffuse plasmas.\n\nAstrophysical plasma may also be studied in a variety of ways as they emit electromagnetic radiation across a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Because astrophysical plasmas are generally hot, electrons in the plasmas are continually emitting X-rays through the process called bremsstrahlung. This radiation may be detected with X-ray telescopes located in the upper atmosphere or in space. Astrophysical plasmas also emit radio waves and gamma rays.\n\nScientists are interested in active galactic nuclei because such astrophysical plasmas could be directly related to the plasmas studied in laboratories. Many of these phenomena seemingly exhibit an array of complex magnetohydrodynamic behaviors, such as turbulence and instabilities. Although these phenomena may occur on astronomical scales as large as the galactic core, many astrophysicists suggest that they do not significantly involve plasma effects but are caused by matter consumed by super massive black holes.\n\nIn Big Bang cosmology, the entire universe was in a plasma state prior to recombination. Afterwards, much of the universe reionized after the first quasars formed.\n\nStudying astrophysical plasmas is part of mainstream academic astrophysics. Though plasma processes are part of the standard cosmological model, current theories indicate that they might have only a minor role to play in forming the very largest structures, such as voids, galaxy clusters and superclusters.\n\nNorwegian explorer and physicist Kristian Birkeland predicted that space is filled with plasma. He wrote in 1913: Birkeland assumed that most of the mass in the universe should be found in \"empty\" space.\n\nIn 1937, plasma physicist Hannes Alfvén argued that if plasma pervaded the universe, then it could generate a galactic magnetic field. During the 1940s and 1950s, Alfvén developed magnetohydrodynamics which enables plasmas to be modeled as waves in a fluid. Alfvén received the 1970 Nobel Prize in Physics for this development. Alfvén later proposed this as the possible basis of plasma cosmology, although this theory has faced scrutiny.\n\n"}

The area was known as \"Nordic Valley\" until June 29, 2005, when it was acquired by the nearby Wolf Creek Golf Resort.\n\nThe resort is known for its inexpensive tickets and as a good place to take children for their first introduction to skiing or snowboarding. Wolf Mountain has been described as having \"the least expensive skiing and riding in Utah\".\n\nWolf Mountain consists of a large beginner slope on the skiers left and several steeper and longer runs on the skiers right, with a terrain park cutting between the two. The short double chairlift \"Wolfdeedo Chair\" and the newly installed longer \"Wolf's Lair Triple Chair\" access the beginner slope and the Wolf's Lair Terrain Park. \"Howling Wolf Chair\", a longer double chairlift with a midway unloading station, provides the only access to most of the resort's terrain as it runs up the center of the hill; it also accesses the beginner slope and terrain park. A short surface lift, the \"Magic Carpet\", is also available for beginners.\n\nThe creation of the Wolf's Lair Triple Chair expanded the beginner slope several hundred feet up the hill, and allowed the doubling in size of the Wolf's Lair Terrain Park. The triple chair also allows easier access to the forested area to the north of the terrain park.\n\nThe entire mountain is lit for night skiing, and snowmaking covers most runs. The resort's snowmaking system was revamped in the summer of 2006, one year after its acquisition by Wolf Creek golf resort. The new system has dramatically improved the reliability of the resort's snow. Though its low elevation makes for a shorter ski season than most ski areas in Utah, the snowmaking provides a stable base for at least a few months each year.\n\nDespite the ski resort's name change, many locals continue to refer to the surrounding community as \"Nordic Valley.\" See Nordic Valley, Utah.\n\n"}

{"id": "2254048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2254048", "title": "Ali Imran", "text": "Ali Imran\n\nAli Imran () is a fictional character in various Urdu language detective novels written by Asrar Ahmed under the pseudonym of Ibn-e-Safi. He serves as the titular protagonist in the \"Imran Series\" novels. He is usually referred to only by his last name in the context of the novels.\n\nImran is written out as a bright and young Oxford graduate, holding both a master's degree and a doctorate in chemistry. Although being highly inquisitive and trained in the matters of criminology, Imran is portrayed rather as showing clumsiness at times to hide the fact that he is a spymaster for a special branch of secret service spy operatives, working for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Like Inspector Clouseau in \"The Pink Panther\", this facet of his personality serves also as comic relief throughout the novel series and teems the extreme morbidity and ruthlessness espionage with decent humour.\n\nAli Imran is an ageless character. He is described to be in his late twenties in earlier novels, and in some later books, early thirties.\n\nImran's childhood was briefly described by Ibn-e-Safi in one of the novels, \"Dr. Duago\", when he was stating the reasons for Imran's paradoxical personality. Imran's mother was a pious Muslim lady, who wanted to see her son following the religion as well. However, Imran's father, Mr. Fazal Rahman (who was also the director general of the Intelligence Bureau's detective unit), chose an American missionary school for his early education. The contradictory teachings of his mother and his school transformed Imran's personality in such a twisted manner that after getting initially confused, he started ridiculing almost everything. Also, due to the strict and dictatorial personality of Fazal Rahman, Imran started living a dual personality from his childhood, acting differently at home and in the outside world.\n\nIt is often told in the novels that Imran's family is Pashtun and descendant of Genghis Khan. See also: Family of Ali Imran\"\n\nAfter completing high school, Imran was sent to London to live with one of Mr. Rahman's English friends, who was a police officer. That friend urged Imran to study criminology, and even provided him with some cases for practical experience. It was during this time that Imran first met the Chinese criminal mastermind, \"Tsung Hi\", and defeated a gangster named McLawrence, who had terrorised London.The entire story is mentioned in Imran Series novel Lashon ka Bazaar.\n\nImran returned to his homeland after earning MSc and D.Sc. degrees in chemistry.\n\nMr. Rahman wanted Imran to join a local university as a professor after his return from London, but Imran flatly refused. After some time, he became friends with Captain Fayyaz, who was a subordinate of Mr. Rahman. Imran started helping Fayyaz in some of his cases, which boosted Fayyaz's profile, and also made some higher officials notice Imran's skills. This led to Imran's appointment as \"Officer On Special Duties\" in his own father's department. Mr. Rahman was infuriated at first, but couldn't object because Imran was being recommended by the Ministry of Internal Affairs.\n\nIn \"Bhayanak Aadmi\" (Imran Series no. 4), Imran dealt with a mysterious smuggler of Shadab Nagar in his own style, which was dismissed by Mr. Rahman as a \"non-detective, scoundrelly approach\". Imran had also brought with him an Anglo-Burmese girl, Roshi, from Shadab Nagar. This annoyed Mr. Rahman so much that he forced Imran to resign and ordered him to leave the house.\n\nImran moved into a flat (which was previously illegally confiscated by Captain Fayyaz), and together with Roshi, opened a private detective agency, disguised as a \"Divorce Bureau\", since the law didn't allow any private detectives.\n\nSir Sultan, who was a secretary in Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and a friend of Mr. Rahman, used to highly acknowledge Imran's abilities, and once requested for his aid in getting rid of a blackmailer. After Imran successfully helped him out, he offered to Imran the position of chief officer (X-2) in the ministry's secret service, which Imran accepted.\n\nImran's role as X-2 is in complete contrast to his apparent personality. As Ali Imran, he acts as an opportunist, becoming either a police informer or a blackmailer according to the situation's needs. He also works as an informant and a mere \"outside agent\" for the Secret Service, and is almost always made fun of by other Secret Service members. However, as X-2, he is feared by the same Secret Service members, who do not know the identity of their chief officer, and have only heard his voice over the telephone or a transmitting device. The voice of X-2 is different from the voice of Ali Imran. The members of Secret Service follow X-2's orders almost religiously, scared of any punishment that he may give if they disobey him. Only three other people know Imran's position as X-2, and those include Sir Sultan, Roshi, and Tahir/Black Zero (a Secret Service member whose duty was to pose as X-2 in Imran's absence).\n\nImran's adventures as X-2 included (among others) the thwarting of many espionage attempts, discovering of spies within national institutions, stopping a civil war conspiracy, and encounters with Zeroland (an international, mysterious, and highly resourceful \"nation\" of criminals). He was considered a \"specialist\" of Zeroland, having obtained high knowledge of its hierarchy, operations, and scientific advancements. Imran also had to deal with double crossing foreign agents, who conspired to reveal the identity of X-2.\n\nAs X-2, Imran reports directly to Sir Sultan, or to the Head of the State.\n\nIn the books, Ali Imran has frequently been described as young, good looking and having a strong, athletic body, but also with a perpetual demeanor of foolishness showing constantly on his face. Sometimes, the words \"gorgeous moron\" have been used to state his presence. He also dresses in an eccentric manner, referred to by Ibn-e-Safi as his \"technicolor\" outfit. For example, Imran may wear a pink coat, with a light green shirt, a yellow necktie, white pants, and a purple flat hat with a red rose in it. However, at times when the need arises, he wears proper and expensive suits. Imran's foolish acts have often described by Ibn-e-Safi to be his second nature and completely without any fabrication. In Imran's own words, he is a \"fool of 1st degree\" in times of peace.\n\nImran lives in a modest flat that he obtained through Captain Fayyaz. However, in later books, Mr. Rahman referred to that flat as his own property.\n\nImran's household staff include his cook, Sulaiman, and Joseph Mugonda, Imran's black bodyguard. In later novels, Sulaiman marries a girl named Gul-Rukh and they both live with Imran.\n\nImran possesses a sharp wit, which when combined with his intelligence and foolish sense of humour, often leads to interesting conversations. He rarely shuts up, annoying all others around him, even in the face of grave circumstances. He is sometimes stated to be an expert in enraging even the most serene of people.\n\nImran has often shown a certain disregard towards rules, and does break them if doing so is to his own advantage. It was due to his non-conformity to rules that Mr. Rahman demanded his resignation after he dealt with the smuggler of Shadab Nagar. However, Imran does not override the law and respects its authority, showing yet another side of his paradoxical personality.\n\nDue to Imran's apparently vulnerable nature and handsome looks, women quickly develop a crush on him, but most of the time, Imran uses them to achieve his own goals and offers nothing but a cold shoulder. He is mostly unmoved by the charms of the fairer sex (just like Colonel Faridi), but has been shown to develop some affectionate feelings of friendship towards some of the women he had encountered, notably, Roshi and Mariana (during the \"Ad Lava\" series). Juliana Fitzwater, the only female member of Secret Service, has shown romantic feelings towards Imran on numerous occasions. Theresia Bumble Bee of Bohemia (T3B), who is one of the main antagonists of Imran Series and chief of the Zeroland, also has a huge crush on Imran, and Imran often flirts with her. However, being an extremely beautiful woman, Theresia once made Imran \"aware of the existence of the most delicate portions of his mind\" when she appeared before him without any disguise and makeup.\n\nImran is fiercely patriotic and protecting his country from foreign spies and threats is his top priority. It is his this personality trait that makes him highly ruthless in the line of his duty. At times, Imran had also dropped his comical nature and acted in a cold and serious manner, intimidating other Secret Service members to an extent that they followed his lead silently without any objection. This was specially evident during Secret Service's adventure in the tribal area of Shikral.\n\nMostly, Imran likes working alone, though he keeps in contact with his subordinates, either as X-2 or as Imran.\n\nDespite his foolish exterior, Imran is a quick thinker and a demon planner. He often comes up with clever and prompt solutions to different problems, and concludes correctly about various aspects of a case. He is also an expert con-artist, and uses his sharp tongue and comical personality to squeeze the required information out of other people.\n\nImran can handle himself in hand-to-hand combat easily and has never really lost a fight. His style of fighting is often described as playful, with his face calm and his actions and movements smooth and under his control. In some novels, it is revealed that he has become a master of all martial arts and has created his own fighting style. Sometimes, he acted in a cowardly manner during a fight to give his opponent a false sense of superiority and then used it to his advantage.\n\nImran can also handle a great array of weapons competently. He once used a wooden stick to defend himself against opponents armed with spears. He also judged at another time that a gun was not loaded by feeling its weight.\n\nImran is also proficient in the \"Sing Art\", the technique of literally dodging bullets by judging the hand movements of the attacker, and moving sharply. The Sing Art was devised by Sing Hee, who performed it in front of Imran during his student years in London. Imran asked Sing to perform it again five times, and being a quick learner, was able to grasp the technique. Sing, initially stunned at Imran's brilliance, then declared Imran to be his nephew in the cunning arts, while Imran started calling Sing his \"uncle\". The Sing Art, however, works only if the attacker is single and is firing a single shot at a time.\n\nImran is a fluent speaker in many languages, including Urdu, Hindi, Tamil and almost all the regional ones. Foreign languages that he is shown to be fluent in include English, Arabic, Persian, Swahili, Shakrali (a fictional language in the series), French, Russian, Greek, Italian, Spanish, and German. He is also capable of assuming native accents. It is not stated when or how he learnt all of them, but it can be assumed that most of these were learnt by him during his time in London.\n\n\n"}

The book lists some of Italy's noble families and their cadet branches.\n\nIn 1896 the \"Golden Book of Italian nobility\", was founded, in which members were families who had obtained decrees granting, renewal or confirmation of a title of nobility by the king or royal decrees or ministerial recognition of his noble title. It was intended to avoid abuses and usurpations in the maintenance of existing titles in the pre-unification states and was responsible for keeping a \"record of noble titles\" in which membership was compulsory for the public use the titles. In 1889 a list of families who had obtained decrees granting or recognition of titles of nobility after the unification of Italy was drawn up, as were 14 regional lists, where families were already recorded in the official lists of states pre-unification.\n\nIt was initially an official register kept in the State Central State in Rome compiled by the heraldry consultants of the Kingdom of Italy, a government body established in 1869 at the Ministry of the Interior.\n\nFirst published in its current form in 1910, it includes some 2,500 families, and may not be considered exhaustive. Included are those listed in the earlier register of the \"Libro d’Oro della Consulta Araldica del Regno d’Italia\" and the later \"Elenchi Ufficiali Nobiliari\" of 1921 and of 1933.\n\nIn 1921 it was approved '\"Official list of noble and titled families of the Kingdom of Italy\": the list included all family members already in the regional registers, but it marked with an asterisk those who had obtained title by royal or ministerial decree. In 1933 it was approved a second '\"Official List of the Italian nobility\", to which was attached a list of requirements to establish nobility. Those enrolled in the Italian Official lists of nobility (1921–1933 and SUPL. 1934-36) had three years to provide documentation for inclusion in the Golden Book of 1933, so this is much shorter than the 1921 edition.\n\nFollowing the Second World War and the decision by a referendum to abolish its monarchy, democratic Italy officially ended its recognition of titles and hereditary honours in its new constitution, so ceased to maintain the Consulta Araldica, an official government body regulating the nobility which had been a department of the Ministry of the Interior. All titles are now not recognized. Only those families bearing titles before 28 October 1922 (i.e. before the rise to power of Fascism) were permitted to use predicates of such titles as a part of their names. These laws did not apply to the nobility of Rome, insofar as their titles had been created by the pope, when he was a sovereign head of state (i.e. until the Capture of Rome on 20 September 1870). After a period of uncertainty, the Italian aristocracy continued to use their titles in the same way as they had in previous centuries. This behaviour was cemented by the continued publication of \"Il Libro d'Oro della Nobiltà Italiana\", published as much to prevent self-styled aristocrats from social climbing as to list the established nobility.\n\nThe \"Libro d'Oro della Nobiltà Italiana\" (\"Golden Book of the Italian Nobility\") is regularly published by the Collegio Araldico of Rome. It should not be confused with a social register - wealth, status and social contacts are of no consideration on the decision as to whether a person may be included in the book, the only consideration is the blood or marital relationship to the head of a noble family. Nor is it a peerage reference such as those published in Great Britain (e.g., Debrett's Peerage & Baronetage, Burke's Peerage). The currently published \"Libro d'Oro\" is not an official publication of the Italian state, which currently does not have a civic office to recognise titles of nobility or personal coats of arms. The most recent (25th) edition of \"Libro d'Oro della Nobiltà Italiana\" was published in 2014 http://www.collegioaraldicoromano.it/libro-d-oro\n\nIt is structured in volumes divided into two series:\n\nIn addition to the \"Libro d'oro\" of Venice, such books had existed in many of the Italian states and cities before the unification of Italy. For example, the \"Libro d'Oro\" of Murano, the glass-making island in the Venetian Lagoon, was instituted in 1602, and from 1605 the heads of the Council of Ten granted the title \"cittadino di Murano\" to those heads of families born on the island or resident there for at least twenty-five years. A \"Libro d'Oro\" was also compiled on each of the Ionian Islands as a nobiliary of the members of local Community Councils (Zante 1542, Corfu 1572 and Cephalonia 1593). After the Ionian Islands were conquered and annexed by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1797, the Libro d'Oro was ceremoniously burned.\n\nIn the reformed Republic of Genoa of 1576 the Genoese \"Libro d'Oro\", which had been closed in 1528, was reopened to admit new blood.\n\nBy extension, a \"Libro d'Oro\" is a by-name for any nobiliary directory, as when Al. N. Oikonomides refers to \"the recently published 'libro d'oro' of the wealthy ancient Athenians (J.K. Davies, \"Athenian Propertied Families 600-200 B.C.\" (Oxford 1971)\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2254056", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2254056", "title": "C-element", "text": "C-element\n\nThe Muller C-element (C-gate, hysteresis flip-flop, or sometimes coincident flip-flop, two-hand safety circuit) is a small digital block widely used in design of asynchronous circuits and systems. It has been specified formally in 1955 by David E. Muller and first used in ILLIAC II computer. In terms of the theory of lattices, the C-element is a semimodular distributive circuit, whose operation in time is described by a Hasse diagram. The C-element is closely related to the \"rendezvous\" and \"join\" elements, where an input is not allowed to change twice in succession. In some cases, when relations between delays are known, the C-element can be realized as a sum-of-product (SOP) circuit . Earlier techniques for implementing the C-element include Schmidt trigger, Eccles-Jordan flip-flop and last moving point flip-flop.\n\nFor two input signals the C-element is defined by the equation formula_1, which corresponds to the following truth table:\n\nThis table can be turned into a circuit using the Karnaugh map. However, the obtained implementation is naive, since nothing is said about delay assumptions. To understand under what conditions the obtained circuit is workable, it is necessary to do additional analysis, which reveals that\nThus, the naive implementation is correct \"only\" for slow environment.\nThe definition of C-element can be easily generalized for multiple-valued logic or even for continuous signals:\n\nFor example, the truth table for a balanced ternary C-element with two inputs is\nDepending on the requirements to the switching speed and power consumption, the C-element can be realized as a coarse- or fine-grain circuit. Also, one should distinguish between single-output and differential realizations of C-element. Differential realization is possible using only NANDs (only NORs). A single-output realization is workable if and only if:\n\nThere is a number of different single-output circuits of C-element built on logic gates. In particular, the so-called Maevsky's implementation is a non-distributive circuit loosely based on. Non-distributivity is introduced sometimes to increase concurrency. The 3NAND gate in this circuit can be replaced by two 2NAND gates. The C-element using only two-input gates has been proposed by Tsirlin and then synthesized by Starodoubtsev et al. using Taxogram language This circuit coincides with that attributed (without reference) to Bartky and can operate without the input latch. Yet another version of the C-element built on two RS latches has been synthesized by Murphy using Petrify tool. However, this circuit includes inverter connected to one if the inputs. This inverter should have small delay. However, there are realizations of RS latches that already have one inverted input, for example . Some speed-independent approaches assume that zero-delay input inverters are available on all gates, which is a violation of true speed-independence but is fairly safe in practice. Other examples of using this assumption also exist.\n\nIn his report Muller proposed to realize C-element as a majority gate with feedback. However, to avoid hazards linked with skews of internal delays, the majority gate must have as small number of transistors as possible. Generally, C-elements with different timing assumptions can be built on AND-OR-Invert (AOI) or its dual, OR-AND-Invert (OAI) gate and inverter. Yet another option patented by Varshavsky et al.\n\nSemistatic C-element stores its previous state using two cross-coupled inverters, similar to an SRAM cell. One of the inverters is weaker than the rest of the circuit, so it can be overpowered by the pull-up and pull-down networks. If both inputs are 0, then the pull-up network changes the latch's state, and the C-element outputs a 0. If both inputs are 1, then the pull-down network changes the latch's state, making the C-element output a 1. Otherwise, the input of the latch is not connected to either formula_4 or ground, and so the weak inverter dominates and the latch outputs its previous state. There are also versions of semistatic C-element built on devices with negative differential resistance (NDR). NDR is usually defined for small signal, so it is difficult to expect that such a C-element will operate in full range of voltages or currents.\n\nSince the majority gate is a particular case of threshold gate, any of known realizations of threshold gate can in principle be used for building a C-element. In the multiple-valued case, however, connecting the output of majority gate to one or several inputs may have no desirable effect. For example, using the ternary majority function defined as\n\ndoes not lead to the ternary C-element specified by the truth table, if the sum formula_6 is not split into pairs. However, even without such a splitting two ternary majority functions are suitable for building a ternary inclusive OR gate.\nBoth the Maevsky and Tsirlin circuits are based actually on so-called David cell. Its fast transistor-level implementation is used in the semistatic C-element proposed. Yet another semistatic circuit using pass transistors (actually MUX 2:1) has been proposed.\nOther technologies suitable for realizing asynchronous primitives including C-element, are: carbon nanotubes, single-electron tunneling devices, quantum dots, and molecular nanotechnology.\n\n"}
{"id": "2254058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2254058", "title": "Marshall Law (Tekken)", "text": "Marshall Law (Tekken)\n\n, or just Law, is a player character from the \"Tekken\" fighting game franchise by Bandai Namco Entertainment. He makes his series debut in the original \"Tekken\", in which he is a Chinese-American restaurateur who wants to open a martial arts school that he hopes to fund with the prize money from the \"Tekken\" series' King of Iron Fist fighting tournaments. He has a son named Forest Law who becomes playable later in the series, and is close friends with fellow contestant Paul Phoenix. Law has made limited appearances in alternate \"Tekken\" media such as the 2009 feature film, and is often described as a tribute to martial artist Bruce Lee, with whom Law shares many characteristics and for which he has received mixed critical and public reception.\n\nMarshall Law is a martial artist who owns a restaurant in San Francisco's Chinatown, and like his close friend Paul Phoenix, financial difficulty becomes his primary motive for entering the King of Iron Fist fighting tournaments held throughout the \"Tekken\" series. Sometimes known as \"The Fighting Chef\", Law is the father of Forest Law. He enters the first King of Iron Fist Tournament in the original game in hopes of opening his own dojo with the winnings, which he accomplishes despite not winning the tournament. However, in \"Tekken 2\", his students are soon attacked and his dojo destroyed by Baek Doo San, provoking Law into entering the second tournament to seek revenge. Law is not playable in \"Tekken 3\", but is included in the game's storyline as having rebuilt his dojo while running a successful restaurant chain called \"Marshall China\" in the United States. Meanwhile, Paul convinces Marshall's son Forest Law to enter the third tournament, which causes friction between Law and Paul.\n\nSimilar to Paul's storyline in \"Tekken 4\", Law's restaurant business goes under and he is consequently bankrupt. He attempts to use the fourth tournament as a crutch to ease his money troubles, but is unable to do so and he is afterwards relegated to taking a dishwashing job in Japan, where the tournaments are held. While participating in the fifth tournament in \"Tekken 5\" in hopes of being able to cover medical bills stemming from Forest being hurt in a motorcycle accident, Law is deported to the United States upon discovery that he was employed illegally in Japan. Paul approaches Law with the proposition of forming a team for the upcoming sixth tournament, believing that the odds of victory (and winning the prize money) would be better as a group than individually, and Law accepts. They later add boxer Steve Fox to their ranks.\n\nMarshall also appears in the noncanonical \"Tekken\" games \"Tekken Tag Tournament 2\", \"Tekken Revolution\", \"Street Fighter X Tekken\", and the 2005 Namco beat 'em up \"Urban Reign\".\n\nMarshall Law is widely accepted as an homage to famed martial artist and actor Bruce Lee in his design and fighting style. Though this has never been publicly confirmed by \"Tekken\" series producer Katsuhiro Harada, he expressed regret in a 2015 interview for modeling many series characters such as Law after real-life personalities: \"They may have been unique, but they didn’t really have any meaning.\" Harada voiced both Marshall and Forest for the first five installments of the main series over a sixteen-year span, then quit after he considered himself incapable of duplicating the voices for \"Tekken 6\" and onward. Kevin Wong of \"Complex\" noted in 2013, \"Law has every single one of Bruce Lee's iconic moves—his flip kick, his one-inch punch, and his flying kick, not to mention his costumes from \"Enter the Dragon\" and \"Game of Death\".\" For his character model in \"Tekken 4\", which takes place 21 years after the events of \"Tekken 2\", Law was given an aged look with a mustache and unkempt hair, while going shirtless with black pants and a red sash; JP Hurh of \"Game Revolution\" described the design as \"hav[ing] a crack-addict look\" to it, \"which one might expect after years of severe physical abuse.\" An alternate \"Tekken 5\" costume was designed by manga artist and character designer Ryōji Minagawa.\n\nLike many \"Tekken\" characters, Law's fighting style is simply described as \"Martial Arts\". \"GameSpy\" wrote that Law in \"Tekken 5\" had \"great combo ability and low attacks\", but his \"combos are less damaging than other characters.\" According to IGN, Law has a lot of juggling options, great counterattacks and easy wall combos in \"Tekken 6\". Tyler Nagata of \"GamesRadar\" described Law's style as \"filled with hard-to-block attacks and unpredictable strikes that [are] easy to work into accidental combos.\"\n\nMarshall has a brief appearance in the 1998 OVA \"\", seen escaping the exploding Mishima resort with the other surviving fighters at the conclusion. in the 2009 live-action \"Tekken\" film, Marshall was played by Vietnamese-American martial artist and actor Cung Le, and has a fight scene with Jin Kazama. Le complained in a 2012 interview about Marshall's backflip-kick special move having been given to Jin for the fight: \"If you’re not going to have Marshall Law do it, you shouldn’t have someone else do it to Marshall Law ... they [the filmmakers] kind of diluted the action a little bit which was kind of B.S.\"\n\nMatt Swider of \"Gaming Target\" rated Marshall the eighth-best \"Tekken\" character out of eleven in 2006: \"Marshall Law, the practitioner of 'Marshall Arts,' has always entered the Tournament with one thing on his mind: money.\" \"GamesRadar\" rated him among gaming's \"kickass Bruce Lee clones\" in 2008: \"\"Tekken\" fans understand the threat that Law posed—even if he was controlled by a mere button masher.\" Michael Grimm of \"GamesRadar\" compared Marshall and \"Street Fighter\" character Fei Long in a 2010 feature on \"Street Fighter X Tekken\": \"There are lots of nice words to describe Fei Long and Marshall Law’s origins: tribute, homage, memorial, but we’re going to settle with 'shameless rip off'.\" Elton Jones of \"Complex\" ranked him the eighth-\"Most Dominant Fighting Game Character\" in 2012, calling him \"the best\" of \"all the fighting game Bruce Lee copycats\", while his \"screams, somersault kicks and lean physique evoke memories of Hollywood's favorite 'Dragon.'\" Jack Pooley of WhatCulture ranked Law the seventeenth-greatest \"beat 'em up video game character\" in 2014, citing his resemblance to Lee as \"a large part of why he's so much damn fun to play. ... I love everything about his combat style, from his blindsiding array of kicks and flips, to the high-pitched screams he lets out as he attacks.\" Kurt Kalata of \"Hardcore Gaming 101\" categorized Marshall, along with Fei Long and \"Mortal Kombat\" character Liu Kang, under \"Fighting game cliché #1: the Bruce Lee ripoff.\" Though Marshall was included in \"Street Fighter X Tekken\", he was only the 33rd-most requested out of 54 \"Tekken\" characters for the game in an official fan poll held by Namco in 2012, in which he received 4.57% (4,038) of 88,280 votes.\n\nAJ Glasser of Kotaku included Marshall in his feature \"The Best and Worst Fathers in Video Games\" in 2009: \"Law sees more of the insides of restaurants than he does of his own son, but he stops at nothing to pay the hospital bills when Forest wrecks his motorcycle.\" In his 2012 preview of \"Street Fighter X Tekken\", Nate Ming of \"Crunchyroll\" described Marshall and Paul Phoenix as \"get-rich-quick schemers\". Sam Loveridge of \"Digital Spy\" ranked Marshall eighth in his 2016 selection of the nineteen \"absolute worst\" character names in video gaming, despite describing him as \"badass\". In a 2014 interview, \"\" actor Joey Ansah singled out Law in his criticism of the evolution of the \"Tekken\" series' storytelling: \"All these things started off as kind of \"Fist of the North Star\" sensibilities and they've ended up as this kind of comedy-slapstick almost pastiche of itself ... Law is now more concerned about his goddamn restaurant and it's like, what the hell happened to kind of this dark anime?\"\n"}

{"id": "2254073", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2254073", "title": "Ibn-e-Safi", "text": "Ibn-e-Safi\n\nIbn-e-Safi (also spelled as Ibne Safi) () was the pen name of Asrar Ahmad (), a best-selling and prolific fiction writer, novelist and poet of Urdu from Pakistan. The word Ibn-e-Safi is an Arabic expression which literally means \"Son of Safi\", where the word Safi means \"chaste\" or \"righteous\". He wrote from the 1940s in India, and later Pakistan after the independence of British India in 1947.\n\nHis main works were the 125-book series \"Jasoosi Dunya\" (\"The Spy World\") and the 120-book \"Imran Series\", with a small canon of satirical works and poetry. His novels were characterised by a blend of mystery, adventure, suspense, violence, romance and comedy, achieving massive popularity across a broad readership in South Asia.\n\nIbne Safi was born on 26 July 1928 in the town 'Nara' of district Allahabad, India. His father's name was Safiullah and mother's \nname was Naziran Bibi.\n\nHe received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Agra University. In 1948, he started his first job at 'Nikhat Publications' as an Editor in the poetry department. His initial works date back to the early 1940s, when he wrote from India. He also studied at Allahabad University where he was class fellow of Prof. Dr. Mohammad Uzair and one year senior to Mustafa Zaidi . After the independence of Indian and Pakistan in 1947, he began writing novels in the early 1950s while working as a secondary school teacher and continuing part-time studies. After completing the latter, having attracted official attention as being subversive in the independence and post-independence period, he migrated to Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan in August 1952. He started his own company by the name 'Israr Publications'.\n\nHe married to Ume Salma Khatoon in 1953. Between 1960 – 1963 he suffered an episode of severe depression, but recovered, and returned with a best-selling \"Imran Series\" novel, \"Dairrh Matwaalay\" (\"One and a half amused\"). In fact, he wrote 36 novels of 'Jasoosi Duniya' and 79 novels of 'Imran Series' after his recovery from depression. In the 1970s, he informally advised the Inter-Services Intelligence of Pakistan on methods of detection. He died of Pancreatic cancer on 26 July 1980 in Karachi, which was coincidentally his 52nd birthday. He was buried in Paposhnagar Graveyard in Nazimabad Karachi.\n\nAt the time of his demise, Ibn-e-Safi had left four sons and three daughters. The sons include Dr. Isar Ahmed Safi, Doctor of Medicine, an ophthalmologist, who died on 3 July 2005 after suffering from a high grade fever; Abrar Ahmad Safi, a mechanical engineer with a marine engineering background, who lives in US; Dr. Ahmad Safi, a mechanical engineer holding a PhD, who lives in Karachi, Pakistan; and Iftikhar Ahmed Safi, an electrical engineer, who lives in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Nuzhat Afroz, Sarwat Asrar and Mohsina Safi are the three daughters.\n\nAll these sons and daughters belong to his first marriage that was held in Rawalpindi, Pakistan in 1954. Later, he also married a young woman named Farhat Ara who lived in North Nazimabad. Karachi. She remained under consistent oblivion till her death in 2011.\n\nIbne Safi's prose work can be classified into two categories:\n\n\nIbn-e-Safi started writing poetry in his childhood and soon earned critical acclaim in whole South-Asian community. After completing his Bachelor of Arts, he started writing short stories, humour and satire under various names such as \"Siniki (Cynic) Soldier\" and \"Tughral Farghan.\" In the \"Nakhat\" magazines, he published several satirical articles which commented on various topics ranging from politics to literature to journalism. His early works in the 1940s included short stories, humour and satire.\n\nAccording to one of his autobiographical essays, someone in a literary meeting claimed that Urdu literature had little scope for anything but sexual themes. To challenge this notion, Ibn-e-Safi began writing detective stories in January 1952 in the monthly \"Nikhat\", naming the series Jasoosi Dunya.\n\nIn 1955, Ibn-e-Safi started the Imran Series, which gained as much fame and success as Jasoosi Dunya. Ibne Safi's novels – characterized by a blend of adventure, suspense, violence, romance, and comedy – achieved massive popularity by a broad readership.\n\nSo strong was Ibne Safi's impact on the Urdu literary scene that his novels were translated into several regional languages. It was not unusual for Safi's books to be sold at black market prices in Pakistan and India, where they were originally published every month.\n\nThe settings in Ibne Safi's novels are such that the reader is never told the national origin of the heroes. Since Jasoosi Duniya was created before the independence of the subcontinent, the names of the characters and their locales suggest that the novel takes place in India. The advent of the Imran Series came post-independence, and the reader is set up to assume that the narrative is situated in Pakistan. Besides their native countries, the main characters of both Jasoosi Duniya and Imran Series have had adventures around the world – Spain, Italy, England, Scotland, Pacific Islands, Zanzibar, South Africa, the United States, and various other places. Considering that Ibne Safi never left the Indian Subcontinent, the detailed descriptions he provides of the diverse localities are surprisingly accurate.\n\nMany a time, Ibne Safi created fictitious settings for his stories. The magical web of his writing is so captivating that these fantasy lands have become real in the minds of readers. Avid fans of the author are experts on the people and cultures of Shakraal, Karaghaal, Maqlaaq, Zeroland, and many other imaginary domains. In cities around India and Pakistan, one can find discothèques, bars, nightclubs, and hotels named after venues found in Ibne Safi's novels. Some places worth mentioning are Dilkusha, Figaro, Niagara, Tip Top, High Circle, etc.\n\nBesides humor and satire, he also wrote some short adventures, namely \"Baldraan Ki Malika\" (The Queen of Baldraan), \"Ab Tak Thee Kahaan?\" (Where had you been?), \"Shumal Ka Fitna\" (The Trouble from North), \"Gultarang\", and \"Moaziz Khopri\". In these adventures, Ibne Safi takes the reader to various fictitious, exotic lands of his own imagination.\n\nIbne Safi wrote the story and screenplay for a film 'Dhamaka' based on his novel 'Bebakon ki talash'. The film did not get the publicity and fame which it deserved and remains mostly forgotten.\n\nIn 1959, Ibne Safi started writing \"Aadmi Ki Jarain\", a book based on human psychology. However, it remained incomplete due to his illness.\n\nThe first English translations of Ibne Safi's mystery novels began appearing in 2010, with \"The House of Fear\" from the Imraan Series, translated by Bilal Tanweer and published by Random House India. In 2011, Blaft Publications in association with Tranquebar released four more novels, this time from the \"Jasusi Duniya\" series, translated by the highly acclaimed Urdu critic Shamsur Rahman Faruqi.\n\nList of his non-series work\n\nNovels\n\n\nIn Urdu script:\nآدمی سنجیدہ ہو کر کیا کرے جب کہ وہ جانتا ہے کہ ایک دن اسے اپنی سنجیدگی سمیت دفن ہوجانا پڑے گا۔\n\"Translation:\" Why should man ever become serious when he knows full well that one day he will be buried along with his seriousness?

Actor Javaid Sheikh (then Javaid Iqbal) was introduced as Zafarul Mulk, the main character. Muhammad Hussain Talpur (film producer) played the role of Jameson and actress Shabnam played the role of Sabiha. Imran and X-2's team was not shown in the movie. The voice of X-2 was recorded by Ibne Safi himself. Actor Rahman played the role of a Villain for the first time. The film featured a rendition of a ghazal by Habib Wali Muhammad, \"Rah-e-talab mein kaun kisi ka\", which was written by Ibn-e-Safi.

He wrote in various genres of Urdu poetry, such as Hamd, Na`at, Manqabat, Marsia, Ghazal, and Nazm.

Funeral was attended by a large number of citizens, admirers, journalists etc. The details of his last moments is mentioned in an article named Bayad Ibne Safi.\n\nThe Bollywood screenwriter and lyricist Javed Akhtar was greatly inspired by Ibn-e-Safi's Urdu novels, which he grew up reading as a child. Akhtar was particularly influenced by the \"Jasoosi Dunya\" and \"Imran\" series of detective novels, such as \"The House of Fear\" (1955). He was influenced by the fast action, tight plots and economies of expression in the \"Jasoosi Dunya\" detective thrillers. He also remembered Ibn-e-Safi's novels for their fascinating characters with catchy memorable names, which left a lasting impression on Akhtar, whose Bollywood scripts later employed some of Ibn-e-Safi's narrative techniques, such as giving catchy names to the characters, his sense of plot, and speaking styles. Akhtar said that Ibn-e-Safi's novels taught him the importance of larger-than-life characters, inspiring famous Bollywood characters such as Gabbar Singh in \"Sholay\" (1975) and Mogambo in \"Mr. India\" (1987).\n\n\n"}

The subfamily was established by Pierre André Latreille in 1809.\n\nWith over 2,000 described species, this is the largest skipper butterfly subfamily and occurs worldwide except in New Zealand. About 50 percent of grass skippers live in the Neotropics. 137 species are native to North America. Around 38 species are native to Australia. Genera \"Ochlodes\" and \"Hesperia\" exist exclusively in the Holarctic.\n\nThey are usually orange, rust, or brown in colour and have pointed forewings. Many species have dark markings or black stigmas on their forewings. Most members of this subfamily have an oval antenna club with an apiculus on the tip, although \"Carterocephalus\" and \"Piruna\" do not. The antennae generally has a sharp bend.\n\nHesperiinae larvae feed on many different types of grasses and sedges and palms, though some species are limited. \n\nAdults typically visit flowers and hold their wings together while feeding. Hesperiinae are unique in that they hold their wings partially open while resting, with the forewings and hindwings held at different angles. This is known as the \"jet-plane position\". Most male grass skippers perch to await females.\n\nAdults are strong fliers; they move quickly and usually in a linear direction. Some of the species, however, do flutter and these species patrol for females rather than perch.\n\nThese grass skipper genera have not yet been assigned to tribes:\n\nThe following grass skippers are considered at risk.\n\n"}

{"id": "2254088", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2254088", "title": "Turkish folk music", "text": "Turkish folk music\n\nTurkish folk music (\"Türk Halk Müziği\") combines the distinct cultural values of all civilisations that have lived in Turkey and its former territories in Europe and Asia. Its unique structure includes regional differences under one umbrella. It was the most popular music genre in the Ottoman Empire era. After the foundation of the Turkish Republic, Atatürk asked to make a wide-scale classification and archiving of samples of Turkish folk music from around the country, which was launched in 1924 and continued until 1953 to collect around 10,000 folk songs. In the 1960s, Turkish folk music met with radio and folk musicians like Aşık Veysel, Neşet Ertaş, Bedia Akartürk became the most popular names of the Turkish folk music. In the 1970s and 1980s, with the rising popularity of arabesque and Turkish light western, Turkish folk music has lost some ground, but singers like Belkıs Akkale, İzzet Altınmeşe, Selda Bağcan, Güler Duman and Arif Sağ made successful hit songs and became important representatives of the genre.\n\n\"Türkü\", literally \"of the Turk\", is a name given to Turkish folk songs as opposed to şarkı, literally \"of the east\". In contemporary usage, the meanings of the words türkü and şarkı have shifted: Türkü refers to folk songs originated from music traditions within Turkey whereas şarkı refers to all other songs, including foreign music.\n\nClassically, Türküs can be grouped into two categories according to their melodies:\n\nMusic accompanied by words can be classified under the following headings: \"Türkü\" (folksongs), \"Koşma\" (free-form folk songs about love or nature), \"Semai\" (folk song in Semai poetic form), \"Mani\" (a traditional Turkish quatrain form), \"Dastan\" (epic), \"Deyiş\" (speech), \"Uzun Hava\" (long melody), \"Bozlak\" (a folk song form), \"Ağıt\" (a lament), \"Hoyrat\", \"Maya\" (a variety of Turkish folksong), \"Boğaz Havası\" (throat tune), \"Teke Zorlatması\", \"Ninni\" (lullaby), \"Tekerleme\" (a playful form in folk narrative), etc. These are divided into free-forms or improvisations with no obligatory metrical or rhythmic form, known as \"Uzun Hava\", and those that have a set metrical or rhythmic structure, known as \"Kırık Havalar\" (broken melodies). Both can also be employed at the same time.\n\nMusic generally played without words, and dance tunes, go by the names \"Halay\", \"Bengi\", \"Karsilamas\", \"Zeybek\", \"Horon\", \"Bar\", etc. \nEach region in Turkey has its own special folk dances and costumes.\n\nHere are some of the most popular:\n\nAlthough some of the scales ('ayak' - foot) employed in Turkish folk music melodies are similar to some of the 'makam' scales of traditional Ottoman/Turkish Classical Music, not all of the folk music scales have Classical music counterparts, and there are important differences between the two concepts. The 'makam' of Turkish Classical Music is not just a scale, but has certain rules of progression, which in some cases are quite detailed, and in the course of the development the whole scale of the makam is used. Though sometimes referred to as makams by exponents of Turkish Classical Music, the scales of Turkish Folk Music are more properly called 'ayak' (foot) and are simply scales, with no rules of progression, thus bearing closer comparison with the concept of medieval church modes than do makams. Furthermore, in many Turkish folk songs only part of the scale is used. Both forms of music are diatonic, but use notes that are additional to the 12 semitones of western music. In Turkish folk music, for example, some scales include a note roughly halfway between B and B flat.\n\nThe scales of Turkish folk music are associated with different regions, and can be known by different names depending on the region, such as: Beşiri, Garip, Kerem, Misket, and Müstezad.\n\nA wide variety of time signatures are used in Turkish folk music. In addition to simple ones such as 2/4, 4/4 and 3/4, others such as 5/8, 7/8, 9/8, 7/4, and 5/4 are common. Combinations of several basic rhythms often results in longer, complex rhythms that fit into time signatures such as 8/8, 10/8, and 12/8.\n\nPlucked stringed instruments include the lute-like bağlama, and cümbüş, and the dulcimer-like kanun. Bowed stringed instruments include the kabak kemane and the kemenche or Pontian Lyra.\n\nWoodwind instruments include the double-reed, shawm-like zurna, Mey (Duduk), the single reed, clarinet-like sipsi, the single-reed twin-piped çifte, the end-blown flutes kaval and ney, and the droneless bagpipe, the tulum. An old shepherd's instrument, made from an eagle's wing bone, was the çığırtma.\n\nPercussion instruments include drumsdavul and nağarathe tambourine-like tef, a mini drum darbuka and the spoons-like kaşık.\n\nMelodies of differing types and styles have been created by the people in various spheres and stages of life, joyful or sad, from birth to death. Minstrels, accompanying themselves on the saz, played the most important role in the development and spread of Turkish folk music. Musicias did not use accompaniment with saz, because Turkish Traditional Music was monophonic. Musicians played the same melody of a song but, when musicians hit the middle and upper strings(These strings must be played without touching keyboard of saz) polyphony was used.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2254098", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2254098", "title": "Bell Bottom Blues (Derek and the Dominos song)", "text": "Bell Bottom Blues (Derek and the Dominos song)\n\n\"Bell Bottom Blues\" is a song written by Eric Clapton and Bobby Whitlock and performed by the band Derek and the Dominos. It deals with Clapton's unrequited love for Pattie Boyd, the wife of his friend George Harrison, and appears on the 1970 double album \"Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs\". Issued as a single, backed with \"Keep on Growing\", the song reached number 91 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in 1971. A re-release backed with \"Little Wing\" peaked at number 78 on the same chart.\n\n\"Bell Bottom Blues\" was recorded before Duane Allman joined the recording sessions for the \"Layla\" album, so Clapton is the only guitarist on the song. Clapton compensates for this by playing multiple guitar parts, including a sensitive, George Harrison-style guitar solo and chime-like harmonics. The other musicians on the recording are Bobby Whitlock on Hammond organ, Carl Radle on bass and percussion, and Jim Gordon on drums, including tabla and backwards snare. Whitlock also sings occasional harmony vocals.\n\nBell-bottoms are a style of trousers that were popular at the time. According to Clapton, the song was written for Pattie Boyd after she asked him to get her a pair of bell-bottom blue jeans from the United States. Clapton wrote the song for her, along with many others on the album such as \"I Looked Away\" and \"Layla\". The lyrics describe a lovers' quarrel. Bill Janovitz of AllMusic notes the raw anguish in Clapton's voice in the pre-chorus and chorus:\n\ncontrasted with the somber longing expressed in Clapton's voice in the verses:\n\nAuthor Jan Reid also praises Clapton's singing on the song, noting that his phrasing manages to suggest that despite the pain he is feeling, the woman's antics remind him of the \"joy of just being alive\".\n\nThe writing of the song was originally credited to Eric Clapton alone, but is now jointly credited to Clapton and Bobby Whitlock. Whitlock stated in an interview in 2011 that \"Eric started the song ... He played me the first two verses at his house and I helped with the last verse\", and that it was credited to Clapton alone by a \"clerical error\". In 2015, in an interview by Mike Rossi for Fabio Create, Whitlock stated that Clapton had now formally accepted that Whitlock had contributed, and in future the song would be jointly credited. The BMI website now credits both writers.\n\nIn a review upon the album's release, \"Rolling Stone\" writer Ed Leimacher called \"Bell Bottom Blues\" (as well as \"Have You Ever Loved a Woman\") filler. A retrospective of the album in \"Rolling Stone\" praised the song as an epic that \"feels as if it's going to shatter from the heat of its romantic agony\". AllMusic critic Bill Janovitz admires both Clapton's guitar playing and his anguished vocal performance. In \"The New Rolling Stone Album Guide\", J. D. Considine cites the track as an example of how \"Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs\" is \"about the transformation of the blues, a process Clapton and his band mates manage through a variety of means\", adding that the song \"distills the pop-blues approach of Blind Faith and Cream into a memorable chorus and exquisite metaphor\".\n\nCher recorded \"Bell Bottom Blues\" on her 1975 album \"Stars\". Matthew Sweet and Susanna Hoffs covered the song on their 2009 album \"Under the Covers, Vol. 2\". Bruce Springsteen borrowed the line \"I don't wanna fade away\" for his 1980 song \"Fade Away\" from \"Bell Bottom Blues\". Lady Gaga referenced the title in her song \"Dope\", where she sings \"I'm sorry and I love you, sing with me, 'Bell Bottom Blue'.\"\n"}

It was released on November 24, 2003 by Maverick Records and Warner Bros. Records. The album contains four songs, in remixed form, from her 2003 ninth studio album \"American Life\" and a previously unreleased song, \"Your Honesty\", originally written and recorded for her 1994 sixth studio album \"Bedtime Stories\". The other tracks included are the live performance of \"Like a Virgin\" and \"Hollywood\" on the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards—which ended with Madonna kissing co-performers Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera—and a remix of 1985 single \"Into the Groove\". The release peaked at number 115 on the \"Billboard\" 200 in the United States. It received mixed reviews from critics; \"Your Honesty\" was generally the only song to receive praise. The remix album also marked the closing release under her contract with Maverick Records.\n\nIn 2003, Madonna planned to release a special commemorative box set to celebrate her twentieth anniversary in the music business and the release of her first studio album, \"Madonna\", in 1983. The plan for the box set was eventually cancelled and \"Remixed & Revisited\" was conceived in its place. The compilation contains remixed versions of four songs from \"American Life\" and a previously unreleased song called \"Your Honesty\"; co-written and co-produced by Dallas Austin, the track is from Madonna's sixth studio album \"Bedtime Stories\" era (1994). \"Nobody Knows Me\" was remixed by performance artist Mount Sims, Headcleanr mixed \"American Life\" and \"Love Profusion\". DJ Jason Nevins remixed \"Nothing Fails\", while \"Into the Hollywood Groove\" was created by The Passengerz. On December 9, 2003, Warner Music France released a box set version containing both the remix collection and the original album \"American Life\" in a cardboard sleeve entitled \"Édition Spéciale 2CDs: American Life + Remixed & Revisited\".\n\nThe medley track \"Like a Virgin/Hollywood\" was performed during the opening of the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards on August 27, 2003, where Madonna was joined by Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, and Missy Elliott. The performance started with Spears appearing on stage on top of a giant wedding cake while wearing a wedding gown and veil; she sang the first few lines of \"Like a Virgin\" before Aguilera appeared from behind the cake and joined her. Madonna then emerged from the cake wearing a black coat and a hat and started singing \"Hollywood\" before proceeding to kiss Spears and Aguilera on the lips. Missy Elliott came out from a wedding chapel to sing her song \"Work It\" halfway through the performance. The kiss generated strong reaction from the media. Feminist author Camille Paglia described the moment as great; she noted that the kiss was like Madonna saying to Spears, \"I'm passing the torch to you.\" However, according to her, Spears could not take advantage of the kiss as later her career and lifestyle came under immense media scrutiny and criticism. Paglia said that \"literally from that kiss, from that moment onward, Britney has spiraled out of control. It's like Madonna gave her the kiss of death!\" Madonna commented on the kiss; \"I am the mommy pop star and she is the baby pop star. And I am kissing her to pass my energy on to her.\" This performance was listed by \"Blender\" magazine as one of the twenty-five sexiest music moments on television history. MTV listed the performance as the number-one opening moments in the history of MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nStephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic felt that the presence of a \"strong hook and a strong sense of fun\" was missing from the compilation, except for the song \"Your Honesty\", which he declared as the best track despite feeling its beats to be a little outdated. He compared the work of the remixers as \"as subtle as a jackhammer, whether it's on the metallic-flaked \"American Life\" by Headcleanr or the '90s-retro Nevins mix of \"Nothing Fails\". On all these mixes, Madonna sounds as if she's out of step with the music of 2003\". Erlewine also compared Spears' vocals with that of Madonna's during her early days and Aguilera's with that of Cher's. Nathan Brackett of \"Rolling Stone\" commented that the release \"improves upon \"American Life\"s standout single \"Love Profusion\", but the rest botches an opportunity to revive interest on its parent album\". Fabian from \"Daily Breeze\" commented that \"Remixed & Revisited\" \"is an amusing collection of novelties.\" Sarah Crompton from \"Boston Herald\" proclaimed the album to be \"more fun than her full-length 2003 offering \"American Life.\"\" \"The Malay Mail\" said that the remixes from the album are for \"true blue Madonna fans.\"\n\nA writer for \"The Miami Herald\" was negative towards the release saying that \"Madonna's latest misstep is this pointless \"Remixed & Revisited\" seven-track EP in which she tries to resell five songs from her recent \"American Life\" CD to an audience who deserve far better efforts from the queen, than this.\" Ricardo Baca from \"The Denver Post\" compared Madonna to actress Drew Barrymore on the cover of the EP, feeling that the singer looked foolish and that the tracks were weal attempts at \"spicing up\" the already non-commercial songs from \"American Life\". Kevin C. Johnson from \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" said that with the remixes, Madonna \"put some life\" back into the songs of \"American Life\", complementing \"Your Honesty\" and wondering why it was left from the \"Bedtime Stories\" sessions. Keith Caulfield of \"Billboard\" was impressed with \"Your Honesty\" and the remixes of \"Love Profusion\" and \"Nobody Knows Me\". He said, \"Die-hard fans, even those unenamored of \"American Life\" will dig this EP.\" In his book \"The Essential Rock Discography\", Martin Charles Strong called the release as \"equally dispensable as its parent album\".\n\nIn the United States, \"Remixed & Revisited\" debuted at number 115 on the \"Billboard\" 200, selling 22,000 copies in its first week. It also debuted and peaked at number 128 on the Top Comprehensive Albums chart. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the EP has sold 114,000 copies as of August 2005 in the United States. The Nevins' mix of \"Nothing Fails\" charted on the Canadian Singles Chart at seven and topped the Hot Dance Club Play chart. It also debuted on the album charts of Belgium, in Flanders and Wallonia, and Switzerland. The album charted in Italy as a song, reaching a peak of number two. It also charted in Finland and Denmark as an EP on the singles charts.\n\nNotes\n\nAdapted from the \"Remixed & Revisited\" AllMusic credits\n\n\n"}

When transitioning from zero to one, the C-element will take into account the common and the asymmetric plus inputs. All these inputs must be high for the up transition to take place.

{"id": "2254113", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2254113", "title": "Korg DW-8000", "text": "Korg DW-8000\n\nThe Korg DW-8000 synthesizer was an eight-voice polyphonic hybrid digital-analog synthesizer 61-note keyboard instrument released in 1985. By the time of its launch Korg had already begun a common trend in 1980s synthesizer design: using numerical codes to access or change parameters (synth \"voice\", tone, etc) with the Korg Poly-61, which was widely regarded as the company's first 'knobless' synthesizer. This was a move away from the heavily laden, complex control panels of earlier designs.\n\nA more unusual feature of the instrument for the time was the use of single-cycle digital waveforms as the basic building block of sound synthesis, and the inclusion of a digital delay effect. This latter feature was one significant factor in the relative success of the DW-8000 compared to the DW-6000 released the same year. It was released after the cheaper model, the Korg DW-6000 synthesizer.\n\nPhysically, the instrument used a 61-note synthesizer action keyboard. \"Synthesizer action\" means that it did not have weighted or semi-weighted keys, a common feature on stage pianos marketed at pianists. The DW-8000 keys were velocity sensitive. As such, a light press triggered a quieter sound and a hard press triggered a louder sound. As well, its keys could sense channel-pressure aftertouch as well. Aftertouch is the placing of pressure on keys after the initial striking or pressing of the keys. On a digital keyboard with aftertouch sensitivity, when the performer continues to press the keys, the aftertouch sensors send a message to the synth module; depending on the programming of the synth patch and/or the settings selected by the performer, aftertouch can trigger a digital effect (e.g., vibrato) or a change in the timbre (tone colour). The keyboard sends aftertouch messages via MIDI if required. \n\nA four-way joystick was provided to control low-frequency oscillation (LFO) modulation as well as pitch bending. Pulling the joystick bender towards you also allowed control over voltage-controlled filter (VCF) as well. Around the back panel are jacks for headphones, stereo line out (to plug into a keyboard amplifier, PA system, mixing board, etc.), pedal inputs for damper, portamento and \"program up\" are provided. Also available are two sockets for tape recorder interface to facilitate offline patch backup and storage of sounds and other data. Electrical power was supplied via a two-pin IEC C9-type connection cable rather than the rather more ubiquitous C13 type, which can potentially be a source of frustration if lost.\n\nThe instrument had 64 memories which could be backed up to cassette tape in similar fashion to that used for home computers of the time. This system could be prone to error or mishap as the availability of the “verify” feature for the tape backup system can attest to. The instrument did, however, possess the capability in MIDI to allow sys-ex transfer provided you have a computer with suitable software that can send the MIDI dump request message to it. A more reliable alternative to the cassette tape interface is a portable CD, sound player or computer with WAVE files saved on disc (although, in this last case, using sys-ex files is faster and saves space). An optional accessory was the MEX-8000, a hardware device which could provide extra storage to the user.\n\nAs basic material, sixteen digital wave cycle waveforms were available to the user through a system Korg called DWGS for Digital Waveform Generator System. The system can be thought of as an early sample playback system where only extremely short, single cycle waveforms are stored on four 256 Kilobit ROM chips, played back through the two digital oscillators and processed by relatively familiar subtractive synthesis facilities. The waveforms themselves were the usual staple sine, sawtooth, and pulse waveforms, but more unusually featured waveforms such as emulations (imitations) of acoustic piano and saxophone. To aid the user in appropriate selection, each of the sixteen wave samples are printed on the right-hand end of the operating panel along with the parameter reference below. Any two of the digitised waveforms could be used by the two digital oscillators provided. A noise source could be added separately to add further timbre or tone colour.\n\nThe synthesizer makes use of two polyphonic modes and two monophonic modes. Each of the two monophonic modes arranged the oscillators into a single note stack of slightly detuned oscillators. Use of these two monophonic modes changes the character of any given patch quite considerably, generally imbuing it with what could best be described as a powerful or \"fat\" sound.\n\nWhilst the source sounds were digital, the subsequent major sound shaping stages consisted of an analog variable-gain amplifier (VGA) enveloper using six stages and similar arrangement also for the analogue filter. The filter is unmistakably analog and can be pushed into self-oscillation using the filter-resonance parameter. Further modulation of the sound could be applied using the single LFO which could either modulate oscillators to produce vibrato effect, the filter, or even both at the same time should such be desired. A significant creative limitation of the DW-8000 architecture was that the user could not control the LFO depth with respect to each oscillator, as they were both modulated in common.\n\nThe final key part of the architecture was the digital delay section, which provided an effect unit that could be applied to the sound. As the rest of the synthesizer architecture up to this point in the sound chain was analogue, the signal had to be converted back to a digital signal so that it could have the effect applied. This fact is evident in the increased noise when using the delay effect. Despite this, it was a flexible digital delay that gave times ranging from 2 to 512 milliseconds in length. Delay effects are similar to reverb. Added to this was a modulation depth parameter so the user could create chorus and flanging effects as well as delay.\n\nWhile contemporary synthesizers with built-in sequencing facilities were quite rare in 1985, the DW-8000 included a 64-note arpeggiator with an optional latch function and an “assignable” mode which allowed the user to cumulatively add up to 64 notes to the arpeggiator's input. The arpeggiator also includes options to span multiple octaves and an adjustable tempocontrol slider.\n\nWhile DW-8000 may not have represented a great leap in synthesis, the hybrid architecture of digital waveforms through analog filters was to become an important approach used in Korg keyboards during the second half of the 1980s. Other manufacturers were developing instruments using similar ingredients of samples and effects, though still using traditional subtractive synthesis with better technology. The Korg DW-8000 was monotimbral and had trouble competing with the Roland D-50 and MT-32 introduced two years later, which used samples of real attack transients to synthesize increasingly realistic acoustic instrument sounds. The MT32 also introduced multitimbral capabilities, with relatively high quality onboard effects. Korg took longer to develop a competitive synthesizer, but by the end of the decade achieved considerable success with their M1 workstation keyboard which included 14 of the 16 DWGS waves from the DW-8000.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2254123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2254123", "title": "Tears in Heaven", "text": "Tears in Heaven\n\n\"Tears in Heaven\" is a song by Eric Clapton and Will Jennings, written about the death of Clapton's four-year-old son, Conor. It appeared on the 1991 \"Rush\" film soundtrack. In January 1992, Clapton performed the song in front of an audience at Bray Studios, Berkshire, England for \"MTV Unplugged\", with the recording appearing on his \"Unplugged\" album.\n\nThe song was Clapton's best-selling single in the United States and reached number two on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. In his home country the United Kingdom it reached number five on the UK Singles Chart, and also charted in the top 10 in more than twenty nations around the world. It won three Grammy Awards for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance, Song of the Year, and Record of the Year. In 2004, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked \"Tears in Heaven\" 362nd on its list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\".\n\nIn August 1990, Clapton's manager, two of his roadies and his friend and fellow musician Stevie Ray Vaughan were killed in a helicopter accident. On 20 March 1991, Clapton's 4-year-old son Conor died after falling from the 53rd-floor window of a New York City apartment belonging to Conor's mother's friend.\n\nAfter isolating himself for a period, Clapton began working again, writing music for the film \"Rush\" (1991). He dealt with the grief of his son's death by cowriting \"Tears in Heaven\" for the soundtrack with Will Jennings. In an interview in 1992, Clapton said of the song, \"It was in the back of my head but it didn’t really have a reason for being until I was scoring this movie ... then it sort of had a reason to be. And it is a little ambiguous because it could be taken to be about Conor but it also is meant to be part of the film.\"\n\nIn an interview with Daphne Barak, Clapton said: \"I almost subconsciously used music for myself as a healing agent, and lo and behold, it worked... I have got a great deal of happiness and a great deal of healing from music.\" Jennings said:\n[Clapton] said to me, \"I want to write a song about my boy.\" Eric had the first verse of the song written, which, to me, is all the song, but he wanted me to write the rest of the verse lines and the release (\"Time can bring you down, time can bend your knees...\"), even though I told him that it was so personal he should write everything himself. He told me that he had admired the work I did with Steve Winwood and finally there was nothing else but to do as he requested, despite the sensitivity of the subject. This is a song so personal and so sad that it is unique in my experience of writing songs.\nShortly after the single was released, Clapton recorded the song in front of an audience at Bray Studios, Berkshire, England as part of a set for \"MTV Unplugged,\" released as \"Unplugged.\" The album topped numerous charts, including the US, Japan and Australia, reached number two in the UK, and was nominated for nine Grammy Awards the year it was released.\n\n\"Tears in Heaven\" is Clapton's best-selling single in the United States. With more than 2,800,000 copies sold – both physical and digital – it remains one of the best-selling pop singles of the 1990s and one of the best-selling singles released by any non-American artist. The Reprise Records single reached number two on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 singles charts, where it charted for 26 weeks. It was kept from the number one spot by \"Save the Best for Last\" by Vanessa Williams. It is also Clapton's highest charting single on the Hot 100 after \"I Shot the Sheriff\", which is Clapton's only Hot 100 number one single to date. While charting on Americas most important single chart, Clapton received several sales awards by the \"Billboard\" magazine, including a \"Hot Shot Debut\" and a \"Power Pick/Sales\" certificate. After the physical single release was certified with a Gold disc by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on March 18, 1992, the single was still selling about 150,000 copies every week. On April 15, 1992, \"Tears in Heaven\" was certified with a Platinum certification award for sales of more than 1,000,000 copies in the United States. It topped the Top Single Sales chart, compiled by the \"Billboard\" magazine in 1992. The release also topped \"Billboard\" magazines Adult Contemporary chart, on which \"Tears in Heaven\" charted for a total of 30 weeks, and also became a number one single on the Top 100 \"Cashbox\" charts. By the end of 1992, \"Tears in Heaven\" sold more than 2,300,000 copies in the United States alone. The pop single also received a lot of airplay, charting 20 weeks on the Top Radio Songs chart, peaking at number three, and reaching position nine on the Mainstream Rock Songs chart, where \"Tears in Heaven\" stayed for a total of 18 weeks. Also, it was later the fourth-favourite recurrent airplay single, as the \"Billboard\" magazine reported in summer of 1992. The 1992 single release was the 6th-best-selling single recording in the United States that year, reaching number six on the \"Billboard\" year-end Hot 100 chart as well as the 5th-most successful Adult Contemporary release. It also ranked at number five on the Top Single Sales chart, compiled by the \"Billboard\" magazine and reached position 25 on the Top Radio Songs year-end chart in 1992.\n\nIn Canada, the Reprise Records single release topped all of the three pop single sales chart in the country and is therefore Clapton's most successful single in Canada to date. The song reached the number one top position on both the Canadian Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks and Top 100 Singles chart, compiled by the \"RPM\" magazine. In addition to the already rare success, reaching number one on both of the charts, \"Tears in Heaven\" was \"The Record\" magazine's top retail selling single release. Shortly after the single was released in Canada and topped all of these three record charts, it was certified with a double Platinum sales certification for physical sales exceeding 200,000 copies. In 1992, \"Tears in Heaven\" was the 17th-best-selling single on \"RPM\" magazine's Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart.\n\nThe pop single release was especially successful in Europe, reaching the Top 10 in 12 countries and the Top 20 in 15 of them. The single charted at number three on the European Hot 100 Singles chart in 1992, and was Europes 21st best-selling single of 1992. In Austria, the physical single peaked at number 25 on the Ö3 Austria Top 40 singles chart, and eventually charted at number ten in week four, reaching its highest charting position in the country. In total, the single of \"Tears in Heaven\" spent 12 weeks on the nations single sales chart. It was eventually certified with a Gold disc by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) in Austria and reached number 61 on the country's year-end chart in 1992. In Flanders (Belgium), the single reached three singles charts. In 1992, it peaked at position 44 on Ultratops Top 50 single chart, and reached its peak position, 16, in week four and five, while on chart for a total of ten weeks. At that time, the single also peaked at number ten on the Belgian VRT Top 30 singles chart, where \"Tears in Heaven\" spent eight weeks on chart.\n\nIn 2010, when a remastered physical edition of the single was released in Belgium, it reached number 16 on the Back Catalogue chart. The song was Belgiums 159th best-selling single in 1992, and certified with a Platinum disc for sales over 50,000 copies by the Belgian Entertainment Association. In Denmark, \"Tears in Heaven\" topped the single sales chart and was certified Platinum for sales exceeding 10,000 copies by IFPI Denmark, as it spent a total of 29 weeks on chart. In France, the single peaked at number two on the French singles chart, where it charted for 34 weeks. On chart week 28, it was certified with a Platinum award by the Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique (SNEP) for sales of more than 500,000 copies in the country. In Germany, the single placed itself on its lowest charting position, number 42. In total, the single charted for eleven weeks on the German singles chart, and sold more than 170,000 both digital and physical copies to date. \"Tears in Heaven\" topped the single charts in Ireland and was certified with a Platinum disc by the Irish Recorded Music Association (IRMA), selling more than 50,000 copies in 1992, as it reached both of the year-end charts in 1992 and 1993 with positions five and 47. In Italy, the single reached Top five positions as both a physical as well as a digital download single. In 1992, the single peaked at number four on the Italian single chart, compiled by Musica e dischi. Later, the single re-entered the nations single chart as a digital download and streaming single, reaching number five on the charts, now compiled by the Federazione Industria Musicale Italiana (FIMI).\n\nIn addition, the digital single was certified with a Platinum disc, for sales and streams exceeding 30,000 units. The single was a medium successful hit in the Netherlands. It reached position 17 on the Dutch Top 40 singles weekly chart, where it stayed for ten weeks, and reached number 131 on the charts year-end compilation in 1992. It also reached the Single Top 100 charts, peaking at number 13 and staying for 21 weeks on chart, before placing itself on position 87 on the year-end Single 100 chart. In Norway, the single topped the VG-lista singles chart in 1992, exactly like it did in Poland, reaching the top spot on the Lista Przebojów Programu Trzeciego (LP3), where it stayed for 16 weeks. In Spain, the single charted at number seven on the nations single charts, and was eventually certified with a Gold disc, commemorating the sale of more than 25,000 copies in the country by the Productores de Música de España (PROMUSICAE). In Sweden, \"Tears in Heaven\" reached number four on the Sverigetopplistan singles chart, where it spent a total of 30 weeks on chart.\n\nIn October 1992, it was presented with a Platinum sales award by the Swedish Recording Industry Association (GLF), when it exceeded 50,000 sold units in the country. It reached number 86 on the 1992 Swedish year-end chart. In Switzerland, the single was also a Top ten hit, peaking at number seven on the Schweizer Hitparade, where \"Tears in Heaven\" stayed for 15 weeks. Here too, the single was presented with a Gold certification by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, for sales exceeding 25,000 copies in Switzerland. It was the 38th most-bought single in Switzerland in 1992. \"Tears in Heaven\" was also a major success for Clapton in his home country, the United Kingdom. The single reached number five on the charts, compiled by the Official Charts Company and spent a total of 14 weeks on the British charts, selling 140,000 copies in the first five weeks. Shortly after, the single was certified with a Silver disc by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), for sales more than 200,000 copies in the country. With total sales of more than 300,000 copies by the end of 1992, \"Tears in Heaven\" reached number 39 on Great Britain's 1992 year-end chart.\n\nIn Australia, \"Tears in Heaven\" was a hit record despite charting in the lower positions of the ARIA Singles Chart. In 1992, the pop Reprise Records single placed itself at number 102 on Australias year-end chart. However, in 1993, it would generate far more single sales, become Australia's 28th best-selling single alongside \"Layla\". In 1993, the single release was also certified with a Platinum record sales certification by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for sales figures exceeding 70,000 physical units. In New Zealand, the single topped the country's single chart for the first five weeks on chart, and spent a total of 18 weeks on the country's single sales chart. On May 31, 1992 – just four weeks on chart in New Zealand – \"Tears in Heaven\" was certified with a Gold disc by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ), commemorating the sale of more than 7,500 copies in the country.\n\nIn Asia, \"Tears in Heaven\" was mostly successful in Japan and Macao. In Japan, the Reprise Records single stayed for a total of thirty-seven weeks on the nation's Hot 100 single sales chart, compiled by \"Oricon\". Because \"Tears in Heaven\" was not released as a maxi single or part of a double A-side by Reprise or Warner Bros. Records in Japan, it was not eligible to chart on any other charts. While charting in Japan in 1992, the pop single release was certified with a triple Platinum disc by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ), for sales overstepping the 300,000 sales mark. By the end of 1992, \"Tears in Heaven\" sold more than 389,000 units in Japan, however, not more than 400,000 copies, quelling the quelling four a quadruple Platinum certification award. For the year-end closing of \"Oricon\", it was revealed, the 1992 single release was the fortieth best-selling release on the Hot 100 Singles chart. On the summary of 1992's most-purchased international singles in Japan, \"Tears in Heaven\" reached number sixty-three. In Taiwan, the Recording Industry of Taiwan (RIT) awarded the single release with a Gold disc, for digital download sales exceeding more than 175,000 units in the country. On Taiwan's year-end chart of 2007, \"Tears in Heaven\" ranked at position seventy-seven. In the special administrative region of Macao, the single was certified with a Gold disc by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry of Macao for single sales of more than 15,000 physical copies.\n\n\"Tears in Heaven\" is Clapton's commercially most successful single release in South America to date, as it reached the single sales charts of three countries. In Argentina, the Reprise Records release topped the country's single charts, compiled by the Cámara Argentina de Productores de Fonogramas y Videogramas (CAPIF). Also, the pop tune topped the singles chart in Brazil, and reached the 1992 year-end charts, placing itself on number fourteen. In Brazil, the single release was certified with a Platinum disc for physical sales of more than 250,000 copies. It is Clapton's highest-selling single in Brazil, as \"Change the World\" was certified with a Gold disc, and a rare certification for any physical single, as the world's best-selling single \"Candle in the Wind 1997\" achieved similar sales figures. At last, \"Tears in Heaven\" peaked at number eight on Asociación Colombiana de Productores de Fonogramas (ASINCOL)'s physical format singles chart in Colombia. It also reached number thirty-eight on the country's year-end chart of 1992, compiled by ASINCOL, and is Clapton's only charting single in the country.\n\nClapton made numerous public service announcements to raise awareness for childproofing windows and staircases. Clapton stopped performing \"Tears in Heaven\" in 2004, as well as the song \"My Father's Eyes\", stating: \"I didn't feel the loss any more, which is so much a part of performing those songs. I really have to connect with the feelings that were there when I wrote them. They're kind of gone and I really don't want them to come back, particularly. My life is different now. They probably just need a rest and maybe I'll introduce them for a much more detached point of view.\" Tears in Heaven was parodied on HBO's Mr. Show.\n\n!scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\"|Digital sales\n\nIn January 2005, Ozzy Osbourne and Sharon Osbourne assembled an all-star cast to collaborate on \"Tears in Heaven\". Sales from the recording benefited the Disasters Emergency Committee's Tsunami Earthquake appeal and the tsunami victims in Southeast Asia. The line up included Gwen Stefani, Mary J. Blige, Pink, Slash, Duff \"Rose\" McKagan, Steven Tyler, Elton John, Phil Collins, Ringo Starr, Andrea Bocelli, Katie Melua, Josh Groban, Scott Weiland, Paul Santo, Robbie Williams, and Rod Stewart. Ozzy Osbourne and Kelly Osbourne also sang on the song.\n\nLoona also recorded a version of the song. In 2017, Beau Dermott recorded a cover of the song for her debut album, \"Brave\".\n\nStevie Wonder performed the song at the Celebration of Life Ceremony honoring the life of the American rapper Nipsey Hussle in April 2019.\n\n"}

It is bounded on the east by Santa Barbara and Hope Ranch, on the west by Goleta, on the north by the Santa Ynez Mountains and on the south by the Pacific Ocean, and largely includes the zip codes 93105, 93110, and 93111. Approximately 30,000 people live in the area.\n\nThe area is called Noleta because of its history of voting \"no\" on incorporation with the City of Goleta (i.e. \"no\" to \"Goleta\"), and as a pun on the more famous neighborhood \"North of Little Italy\" in New York City. As it is unincorporated, the area is under county government administration. While Noleta has a history of voting \"no\" on incorporation, neither the City of Santa Barbara nor Goleta have attempted to annex the Noleta area. Both communities are reluctant to absorb the community because the area's tax base does not generate enough revenue to pay for the services it requires. Nevertheless, both cities compete to influence the community.\n\nThe reluctance of \"Noleta-ers\" to incorporate is largely based on a variety of reasons including:\n\nAs an unincorporated area of Santa Barbara County, residents are addressed by the US Postal Service as Santa Barbara.\n\nThe struggle between Goleta and Santa Barbara to include the area within their sphere of influence, usually the first step towards eventual annexation, took a new twist in May 2005, when residents of the area presented a petition to Santa Barbara City Hall with 4,150 signatures, requesting inclusion in Santa Barbara's sphere of influence. Goleta officials declared in June that they had no intention of serving people outside their official city boundaries, as opposed to Santa Barbara, which did. On September 1, 2005, the issue of the future sphere of influence over the \"Noleta\" area was discussed by the Santa Barbara City Council at City Hall in Santa Barbara.\n\nOn August 24, 2005, the Santa Barbara City Council unanimously backed a proposal to put the area officially under the city's sphere of influence. The only opposition to the proposal came from residents of mobile homes in the area, who worry that they could lose their rent protection, which they have under Santa Barbara County rules, but would potentially disappear under Santa Barbara City rules.\n\nThe petition drive to get Noleta included in the Santa Barbara sphere of influence was led by two committees, the \"West Santa Barbara Committee\" and the \"Committee of One.\"\n\nPrior to the 2008 recession, pressure to build new housing in the area had been intense, due to two reasons: the area contained the largest number of undeveloped parcels on the South Coast, and there was a general lack of affordable housing in the Santa Barbara area, as the median home price in 2005 had reached approximately 1.3 million dollars. In mid-October 2005, the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors authorized $43,000 to fund a growth outline for the area. Several large-scale housing projects were proposed by the county in the Noleta area, which were opposed by many local residents due to traffic and quality-of-life concerns.\n\n"}

Victor Young contributed the lively musical score, including a fast-paced variation of the \"William Tell Overture\" for the opening scenes. Typical of a Sturges film, the pacing and dialogue of \"The Palm Beach Story\" are very fast.\n\nTom and Gerry Jeffers (Joel McCrea and Claudette Colbert) are a married couple in New York City who are down on their luck financially, which is pushing the marriage to an end. But there is a deeper problem with their relationship, just hinted at under the opening credits in the prologue, and only disclosed at the end.\n\nThe couple remain married from 1937 until 1942, when this story begins. Gerry decides that Tom would be better off if they split up. She packs her bags; takes some money offered to her by the Wienie King (Robert Dudley), a strange but rich little man who is thinking of renting the Jeffers' apartment; and boards a train for Palm Beach, Florida. There she plans to get a divorce and meet a wealthy second husband who can help Tom. On the train, she meets the eccentric John D. Hackensacker III (Rudy Vallée), one of the richest men in the world.\nBecause of an encounter with the wild and drunken millionaire members of the Ale and Quail hunting club, Gerry loses all her luggage; after making do with clothing scrounged from other passengers, she is forced to accept Hackensacker's extravagant charity. They leave the train and go on a shopping spree for everything from lingerie to jewelry – Hackensacker minutely noting the cost of everything in a little notebook, which he never bothers to add up – and make the remainder of the trip to Palm Beach on Hackensacker's yacht named \"The Erl King\" (a Sturges joke on the Hackensacker family business, oil).\n\nTom follows Gerry to Palm Beach by air, also with the impromptu financial assistance of the Wienie King. When Tom meets Hackensacker, Gerry introduces him as her brother, Captain McGlue. Soon, Hackensacker falls for Gerry, while his often-married, man-hungry sister, Princess Centimillia (Mary Astor), chases Tom, although her last lover, Toto (Sig Arno), is still following her around. To help further his suit with Gerry, Hackensacker agrees to invest in Tom's scheme to build an airport suspended over a city by wires.\n\nTom finally persuades Gerry to give their marriage another chance, and they confess their masquerade to their disappointed suitors. Even though he is disappointed, Hackensacker intends to go through with his investment in the suspended airport, since he thinks it is a good business deal and he never lets anything get in the way of business. Then, when Tom and Gerry reveal that they met because they are both identical twins – a fact which explains the opening sequence of the film – Hackensacker and his sister are elated. The final scene shows Hackensacker and Gerry's twin sister, and the Princess and Tom's twin brother, getting married, with Gerry and Tom standing as Maid of Honor and Best Man for both.\n\nThe film ends where it began after the prologue, with the words \"And they lived happily ever after...or did they?\" on title cards.\n\n\nThe Ale and Quail Club:\n\nAt least part of the initial inspiration for \"The Palm Beach Story\" may have come to Preston Sturges from close to home, since his ex-wife, Eleanor Hutton, was an heiress who moved among the European aristocracy, and was once wooed by Prince Jerome Rospigliosi-Gioeni, among others, and Sturges himself had shuttled back and forth between Europe and America as a young man. Indeed, one incident in the film is based on something which happened to Sturges and his mother while traveling by train to Paris, when the car with their compartment was uncoupled while they ate dinner two cars away.\n\nThe story Sturges came up with had the title \"Is Marriage Necessary?\", and this, along with an alternative, \"Is That Bad?\", became a working title for the film. \"Is Marriage Necessary?\" was rejected by the censors of the Hays Office, who also rejected the script that Paramount submitted to them because of its \"sex suggestive situations...and dialogue.\" Changes were made, but the Hays Office continued to reject the script because of its \"light treatment of marriage and divorce\" and because of similarities between the John D. Hackensacker III character and John D. Rockefeller. More changes were made, including reducing the number of Princess Centimillia's previous marriages from eight to three (plus two annulments), before the script finally was approved.\n\nClaudette Colbert received $150,000 for her role, and Joel McCrea was paid $60,000.\n\nThe second unit did background shooting at Penn Station in Manhattan. The film went into general release on 1 January 1943. The film was released on video in the U.S. on 12 July 1990 and re-released on 30 June 1993.\n\nIn 1998, Jonathan Rosenbaum of the \"Chicago Reader\" included the film in his unranked list of the best American films not included on the AFI Top 100.\n\nIn 2000, American Film Institute included the film in AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs (#77).\n\n\n"}

The subfamily was established by Hermann Burmeister in 1878. Their delimitation and internal systematics has changed considerably in recent years, but as of 2009 the uncertainties surrounding the evolutionary relationships of many genera in this subfamily are widely resolved.\n\nIt still is the second-largest subfamily of skipper butterflies, although of its over 1,000 species a considerable number are no longer in that classification.\n\nSpread-winged skippers bask with their wings held wide open. The wings are held closed when they are at rest. They are usually brown, black, or checkered, but some are brilliantly coloured. Some have long tailed hind wings.\n\nMales maintain territories and frequently perch on overhanging branches and tree trunks. They do not visit flowers for sustenance, but rather drink fluids from dung, carrion, and rotting fruit.\n\nA large and successful subfamily, the spread-winged skippers are found essentially worldwide, except in very cold or desert regions. They probably originated in the tropics and subsequently extended their range into more temperate regions. Perhaps, their place of origin is western Africa: most of the Celaenorrhini – one of the two basalmost tribes – are found in Africa, while the Carcharodini – the other very basal tribe – occurs throughout the tropics.\n\nMost of the more advanced tribes, on the other hand, are very diverse in the Neotropics, which their ancestors would have found most easy to reach by crossing the central Atlantic, rather than taking the longer route via Europe and North America or the Pacific. It is also possible that the group originated in the Neotropics and subsequently dispersed eastwards to Africa via the Intertropical Convergence Zone.\n\nThe formerly few tribes of Pyrginae have almost doubled in number. However, in its old delimitation the supposed \"subfamily\" was not monophyletic, and the former tribe Eudamini is now recognized as a distinct subfamily Eudaminae. The regent skipper (\"Euschemon rafflesia\"), at one time included in the pyrgine tribe Tagiadini, is actually the single most distinct living species of skipper butterflies, and warrants recognition in a subfamily of its own. On the other hand, the firetips – earlier treated as a subfamily of their own – have been found to be very close relatives of the Tagiadini and are now included in the Pyrginae as tribe Pyrrhopygini.\n\nThe 7 tribes of the Pyrginae in their modern circumscription are, in phylogenetic sequence:\n\n\n\n"}

It is located on the Una river in the Sisak-Moslavina County, south of Petrinja and Sisak and across the river from Kostajnica in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nKostajnica was first mentioned in the document by knights templar from 1240. This year is used as official birth year of this historic town.\n\nTime of the first settlement is unknown, but town lies on very important Roman roads that were used for transporting salt and cotton. Since Roman roads were merged in the vicinity of the city it is believed that settlement dates much earlier than the first written document known today. Position of town is very similar to the town from old Roman documents known as “Oeneum”. Five Roman milestones were located in the city dating back to the 3rd century A.D.\n\nDuring 13th and 14th century, Kostajnica became a fortification (kaštel) that was built as a protection against invading Turks. The owners of the fortification were members of the noble families Lipovečki, Tot, Frankopan, Benvenjud and finally Zrinski, so the castle is today also known as Zrinski castle (\"Stari grad Zrinski\" in Croatian). Other forts existing during that period were in the surrounding villages of Komogovina, Svinica, and Prevršac. After, Commander of the Hrvatska Kostajnica was Prince and Duke Luke Novosel of Transleithania (House of Novosel) (Croatia and Slavonia part). The Turks invaded Kostajnica in 1556 and it wasn't until 1687 that the town was liberated.\n\nDuring the early 18th century two schools are opened in the city. One school was operated by Catholic Missionary Church of “St. Antun Padovinski”, while the second schools was run as a Serbian Public School.\nKostajnica is known for its natural springs such as; Varoški Bunar, Mrzlenac, Tekija, Pekinac, Paunovac, Angelovac, and Tutulovac. The most popular spring Tekija has engraved sign (drink brother, potion was given to you by the god's mercy) “Pi brate iz Božje milosti dat ti je napitak.”\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, Kostajnica was a district capital in the Zagreb County of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia.\n\nDuring World War II, the town was occupied by Axis troops and was included into the Pavelić's Independent State of Croatia (NDH). The fascist Ustashe regime committed the Genocide of the Serbs and the Holocaust. Between 29 and 37 July 1941, 280 Serbs were killed and thrown into pits near Kostajnica. The town was bombed by American forces on May 30, 1944.\nKostajnica suffered greatly during the Croatian War of Independence. A large part of the Croatian population were expelled or killed by rebel Serbs in 1991 and the city was incorporated into the Republic of Serbian Krajina. Houses and buildings belonging to Croats were burned and looted, including the baroque church, the medieval apothecary, and the eighteenth-century Franciscan monastery. The only piece of the city's cultural heritage left was the castle by the river built by the Frankopans. Kostajnica was put back in Croatian control following military victories by the army in August 1995, and the Croat population expelled slowly began returning.\n\nThe municipality population of 2,756 is composed of the following settlements:\n\nIn the 2011 population census, Croats made up 69.34% of the municipal population and Serbs were 25.04%.\n\nPopulation of Hrvatska Kostajnica town by ethnicity\n\nToday, chief occupations are farming, leather (footwear), textiles plant, printing, and wood processing mill. Fishing and hunting are very important tourist attractions in the city with some of the best natural habitats found in this part of Europe. Hrvatska Kostajnica is underdeveloped municipality which is statistically classified as the First Category Area of Special State Concern by the Government of Croatia.\n\n\n"}

After its original failure to be enacted, the bill was revised and re-introduced to Congress, where it was finally accepted. The basis for the action was the constitutional clause giving Congress the task of regulating interstate commerce. \nThe Act specified that the U.S. Attorney General, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Agriculture would convene a caucus to publish from time to time uniform rules and regulations to comply with the Act. To enforce the Act, the Secretary of Labor would assign inspectors to perform inspections of workplaces that produce goods for commerce. The inspectors would have the authority to make unannounced visits and would be given full access to the facility in question.

Linguistically the term means \"innovation, novelty, heretical doctrine, heresy\".\n\nIn classical Arabic literature (adab), it has been used as a form of praise for outstanding compositions of prose and poetry.\n\nIn early Islamic history, bidah referred primarily to heterodox doctrines. In Islamic law, when used without qualification, bidah denotes any newly invented matter that is without precedent and is in opposition to the Quran and Sunnah.\n\nScholars generally have divided bidah into two types: innovations in worldly matters and innovations in religious matters. Some have additionally divided bidah into lawful and unlawful innovations, the details of which are discussed below.\n\nIntroducing and acting upon a bidah in religious matters is a sin and considered one of the in Islam that is obligatory to immediately desist and repent from.\n\nSunni Muslim scholars have divided bidah in worldly matters into two types:\n\nThere are a number of different definitions of \"bidah\".\n\nThe Quranic verse: \"This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed my favor upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion.\"(), is considered by at least some Muslim to be against bidah in religion. The Sunnah has many more prohibitions against innovation in religion.\n\nAli ibn Abu Talib, of the \"Rashidun\" (rightly guided Caliphs), said; \"He who innovates or gives protection to an innovator, there is a curse of Allah and that of His angels and that of the whole humanity upon him.\" Abdullah ibn Umar said: \"Every innovation is misguidance, even if the people see it as something good.\"\n\nAbd Allah ibn Abbas, a companion of the Prophet and early Islamic scholar also said: \"Indeed the most detestable of things to Allah are the innovations.\" Sufyan al-Thawri, a \"tabi'i\" Islamic scholar, Hafiz and jurist, mentions: \"Innovation is more beloved to Iblees than sin, since a sin may be repented for but innovation is not repented for.\" He also said, \"Whoever listens to an innovator has left the protection of Allāh and is entrusted with the innovation.\"\n\nA person once sent salaam to Abdullah ibn Umar who replied: \"I do not accept his salaam, as this person has innovated by becoming Qadariyah (A sect which does not believe in destiny.\")\n\nAl-Fuḍayl ibn Iyāḍ is reputed to have said: \"I met the best of people, all of them Salafi and they used to forbid from accompanying the people of innovation.\" Hasan al-Basri mentions: \"Do not sit with the people of innovation and desires, nor argue with them, nor listen to them\". Ibraaheem ibn Maysarah mentions: \"Whoever honours an innovator has aided in the destruction of Islam.\"\n\nAl-Hasan ibn 'Ali al-Barbahari mentions: \"The innovators are like scorpions. They bury their heads and bodies in the sand and leave their tails out. When they get the chance they sting; the same with the innovators who conceal themselves amongst the people, when they are able, they do what they desire.\" Abu Haatim said: \"A sign of the people of innovation is their battling against the people of Narrations.\" Abu 'Uthmaan as-Saaboonee said: \"The signs of the people of innovation are clear and obvious. The most apparent of their signs is their severe enmity for those who carry the reports of the Prophet.\"\n\nJabir ibn Abd Allah narrated \"...The Prophet said: He who introduced some good (precedent) practice in Islam which was followed after him (by people) he would be assured of reward like one who followed it, without their rewards being diminished in any respect. And he who introduced some evil practice in Islam which had been followed subsequently (by others), he would be required to bear the burden like that of one who followed this (evil practice) without their's being diminished in any respect.\n\nAnas ibn Malik said \"I heard the Prophet say: 'My nation will not unite on misguidance, so if you see them differing, follow the great majority.'\"\n\nAbu Hurairah narrated that the Prophet said, \"Whoever prayed at night the whole month of Ramadan out of sincere Faith and hoping for a reward from Allah, then all his previous sins will be forgiven.\" After the Prophet's death the people continued observing that (i.e. Nawafil offered individually, not in congregation), and it remained as it was during the Caliphate of Abu Bakr and in the early days of Umar ibn Al-Khattab's Caliphate. During Ramadan upon seeing people praying in different groups, Umar ordered Ubay ibn Ka'b to lead the people in congregational prayer. On this Umar said: 'What an excellent Bida (i.e. innovation in religion at that time from an earlier time) this is; but the prayer which they do not perform, but sleep at its time is better than the one they are offering.'\n\nSalman al-Farsi narrated that the Prophet was asked, by some of the companions, about the permissibility and prohibition of certain items, he states \"Halal is that which Allah has made Halal in His book, Haram is that which Allah has made Haram in His book and about which he has remained silent is all forgiven.\"\n\nAbu Hurairah narrated at the time of the Fajr prayer the Prophet asked Bilal ibn al-Harith, \"Tell me of the best deed you did after embracing Islam, for I heard your footsteps in front of me in Paradise.\" Bilal replied, \"I did not do anything worth mentioning except that whenever I performed ablution during the day or night, I prayed after that ablution as much as was written for me.\" Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani says in \"Fath al-Bari\" that \"the hadith shows it is permissible to use personal reasoning (ijtihad) in choosing times for acts of worship, for Bilal reached the conclusion he mentioned by his own inference and the Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace) confirmed him therein.\" Similar to this, Khubyab bin Adi asked to pray two rakas before being executed by idolators in Mecca, and was hence the first to establish the \"sunna\" of two rak'as for those who are steadfast in going to their death.\n\nRifaa ibn Rafi narrated: When we were praying behind the Prophet and he raised his head from bowing and said, \"Allah hears whoever praises Him,\" a man behind him said, \"Our Lord, Yours is the praise, abundandly, wholesomely, and blessedly.\"When he rose to leave, the Prophet asked who said it, and when the man replied that it was he, the Prophet said, \"I saw thirty-odd angel each striving to be the one to write it.\" Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani comments in \"Fath al-Bari\" that the hadith \"indicates the permissibility of initiation new expression of \"dhikr\" in the prayer other than the ones related through hadith texts (even though this is still reported in the hadiths), as long as they do not contradict those conveyed by the hadith. It is clear that this is since the above were a mere enhancement and addendum to the know, \"sunna dhikr\".\"\n\nImam Shafi'i gave the following advice, \"An innovation which contradicts the Qurʼan, Sunnah, an Athar or Ijma is a heretical bida: if however something new is introduced which is not evil in itself and does not contradict the above mentioned authorities of religious life, then it is a praiseworthy, unobjectional bida.\" This can infer worldly bida or technology.\n\nThe criterion that qualifies a particular action as a bidah in the religion is a debate amongst Sunni scholars. Scholars affiliated to the Salafi and Wahhabi sects argue for an exclusive, literal definition that entails anything not specifically performed or confirmed by the Prophet.\n\nPractitioners of Sufism, in contrast, argue for an inclusive, holistic definition. Umar Faruq Abd-Allah writes:\nAccording to Shia Islam the definition of bidah is anything that is introduced to Islam as either being fard (mandatory), mustahabb (recommended), halal (neutral), makruh (reprehensible) or haram (forbidden) that contradicts the Quran or hadith. Any new good practice introduced that does not contradict the Quran or hadith is permissible. However, it is not permissible to say that a new good practice (that does not contradict the Quran or hadith) is obligatory, highly recommended or \"sunnah\" proper. Hence, the Shia stance mirrors the body of Sunni scholars who proffer the idea of \"bidah hasana\". As a general rule in Shia jurisprudence, anything is permissible except whatever is prohibited through divine revelation (i.e. the Quran or hadith).\n\nDespite the general understanding of standing scholarly disagreements (ikhtilaf), the notion of lawful innovation is a polarizing issue in the Islamic world. A practical example of this is the debate over the permissibility of the mawlid or commemoration of Muhammad's birthday. All scholars agree that such celebrations did not exist in the early period of Islamic history, and yet \"mawalid\" commemorations are a common element in Muslim societies around the world. Even so, Sunnis' scholars are divided between emphatic unconditional condemnation and conditional acceptance of the celebration with the former insisting it is a bidah and thus automatically unlawful, while the latter argues it nonetheless is contextually permissible.\n\nBritish historian Sadakat Kadri has noted the change over time in what is considered bidah.\n\nHadith were not written down until the 9th century, at least in part because \"traditionialists such as Ibn Hanbal considered human literature to be an unholy innovation.\" This interpretation changed even for very conservative jurists such as Ibn Taymiyyah who wrote dozens of books. Ibn Taymiyyah however considered mathematics, a bidah, a false form of knowledge that \"does not bring perfection to the human soul, nor save man from castigation of God, nor lead him to a happy life\", and forbade its use in determining the beginning of lunar months. Very conservative Wahhabis allow the broadcast of television but Indian Deobandi forbid their followers from watching it, but make use of the more recent invention the internet to issue fatwas.\n\nTraditionally who died of plague and who did not was explained as simply the will of God based on al-Bukhari's al-Sahih hadith, but studying the progress of the Black Death (bubonic plague) in the 14th century, scholar Ibn al-Khatib noted those who died had the plague transmitted to them from \"garments, vessels, ear-rings; ... persons ... by infection of a healthy sea-port by an arrival from an infected land\" where as isolated individuals were immune. In the Muqaddimah, Ibn Khaldun defends the science of medicine from suggestions that it is an innovation going against the Sunna. \"The medicine mentioned in religious tradition ... is in no way part of the divine revelation.\" It was simply part of \"Arab custom and happened to be mentioned in connection with the circumstances of the Prophet, like other things that were customary in his generation.\" But was \"not mentioned in order to imply that [it] is stipulated by the religious law.\"\n\nIn his \"Book of Knowledge\" Al-Ghazali observed that many phenomena once thought bidah had come to be though legally unobjectionable. \n[A]mong the accepted practices of our time are decorating and furnishing the mosques, and expending great sums of money on their ornate construction and fine rugs which were then considered innovations. These were introduced by the pilgrims, since the early Muslims seldom placed anything on the ground during prayer. Similarly disputation and debate are among the most honoured disciples of the day and are numbered among the best meritorious works (qarubat): nevertheless they were among the taboos at the time of the Companions. The same is true of the chanting (talhiri) of the Quran and the call for prayer, going to excess in matters of cleanliness and being over fastidious in matters of ceremonial purity, ruling clothes unclean on petty and far-fetched grounds, and, at the same time, being lax in ruling foods lawful and unlawful as well as many other like things.\nHe quoted Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman approvingly: \"Strange as it may seem, accepted practices of today are the taboos of a day gone by. ... And the taboos of today are the accepted practices of a day yet to come.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

It also acquired WSBS-TV in Miami, Florida and WTCV in San Juan, Puerto Rico, the group of owned and operated TV stations for its Mega TV network.\n\nSBS targets the U.S. Hispanic audience in six geographic regions: the Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Miami, and San Francisco metropolitan areas, and Puerto Rico.\n\nSpanish Broadcasting System was founded by Pablo Raúl Alarcón Sr., who started in Spanish-language radio broadcasting in the early 1950s when he started his first radio station in Camagüey, Cuba, and his son, Raúl Alarcón Jr. Alarcón Sr. had acquired 14 radio stations by the time he fled Cuba with his family to the United States in 1960. In the U.S. he continued his career as an on-air personality at a New York radio station after arriving in the United States before being promoted to programming director. He subsequently owned a recording studio and advertising agency before borrowing $3.5 million USD to purchase the first SBS radio station, WSKQ-AM (La Super 1380) in 1983 with his son, Raúl Alarcón Jr. Alarcón Sr. would serve as SBS Chairman of the board of directors, while his son would serve as an account executive in the sales department.\n\nSBS generated sales of about $20 million in its first year, confirming the influence of the growing Spanish-speaking audience. Raúl Alarcón Jr. became President of SBS and a director in October 1985. In 1988 SBS purchased its first FM station, regional Mexican KLAX 97.9 FM in Los Angeles. The company went public in the fall of 1991, raising $435.8 million by selling 21.8 million shares at $20 per share. SBS bought its third station, New York's WSKQ-FM, in 1989 and reformatted it as Mega 97.9, La Mega, surpassing the market's longtime leader, the light rock station WLTW-FM, by 1998. A major turning point for Spanish radio occurred that year when media researchers at Arbitron rated La Mega's morning show number one over that of the radio personality Howard Stern. \n\nIn 2002 the company created SBS Entertainment, a concert production arm. It also diversified by purchasing 80 percent of JuJu Media, the operator of the Spanish-English Web site LaMusica.com, which offered Latin music, entertainment, news, and culture. Later that year, at the insistence of Alarcón Jr., SBS launched KZAB-FM (La Sabrosa 93.5), targeting the Central American population in Los Angeles. In 2003, WSKQ was the most listened-to Spanish-language radio station in the United States. That year Alarcón Jr. told \"Billboard\" magazine, \"My opinion is that radio programming continues to be an art. It is not a science. I will not argue with the fact that research gives you a good indication, a good road map.\"\n\nRaúl Alarcón Jr. is the current Chief Executive Officer of SBS, a position he has held since June 1994. He also succeeded his father as Chairman of the board of directors on November 2, 1999. Alarcón Sr. would continue to serve as Chairman Emeritus.

The musical is based on Biblical tales from the Books of Samuel and 1 Chronicles, as well as text from David's Psalms.\n\n\"King David\" is mostly sung-through with little dialogue, and the music swings from pop to jazz to grand choral arrangements. It uses a large orchestra and a large choir.\n\nThe work was conceived as an outdoor piece to commemorate the 3,000th anniversary of the city of Jerusalem. However, according to Rice, \"When it proved logistically and financially impossible to do it and Disney took an interest, we changed gears... We felt we'd been commissioned to write it as an oratorio, and still hoped it would be performed as such in Israel. ... we should have emphasized that more to avoid being judged primarily as a Broadway show.\"\n\nSamuel \nSaul \nGoliath\nJonathan\nExile\n\nDavid the King\nBathsheba\nAbsalom \nDavid's Final Days\nA concert version, produced by Disney Theatrical Productions and André Djaoui and directed by Mike Ockrent, was presented as the inaugural production at Disney's newly renovated New Amsterdam Theatre (the former home of the \"Ziegfeld Follies\"), playing for a nine-performance limited run in May 1997.

Ben Brantley wrote: \"...the show is sober, respectful, packed with enough information for a month of Bible-study classes and, on its own terms, most carefully thought out, with pop equivalents of operatic motifs and exotic folkloric touches a la Borodin. Yet while the well-sung cast, under Mike Ockrent's direction, and the orchestra (Michael Kosarin is the music director and Douglas Besterman the orchestrator) have been painstakingly polished, the show, at two hours and 45 minutes, just can't help being a Goliath of a yawn.\"\n\n\"Variety\" called it \"Unrelentingly serious-minded and devoid of the wit that Menken brought to previous projects\".\n\nThe cast album, however, which cuts several musical numbers and reprises, has been praised.\n\n"}

{"id": "2254241", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2254241", "title": "(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais", "text": "(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais\n\n\"(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais\" is a song by the English punk rock band the Clash. It was originally released as a 7-inch single, with the b-side \"The Prisoner\", on 16 June 1978 through CBS Records.\n\nProduced by The Clash and engineered by Simon Humphries, the song was recorded for (but not included on) the group's second studio album \"Give 'Em Enough Rope\"; it was later featured on the American version of their debut studio album \"The Clash\" between the single version of \"White Riot\" and \"London's Burning\".\n\nThe song showed considerable musical and lyrical maturity for the band at the time. Compared with their other early singles, it is stylistically more in line with their version of Junior Murvin's \"Police and Thieves\" as the powerful guitar intro of \"(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais\" descends into a slower ska rhythm, and was disorienting to a lot of the fans who had grown used to their earlier work. \"We were a big fat riff group\", Joe Strummer noted in the Clash's film \"Westway to the World\". \"We weren't supposed to do something like that.\"\n\n\"(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais\" starts by recounting an all-night reggae \"showcase\" night at the Hammersmith Palais in Shepherd's Bush Road, London, that was attended by Joe Strummer, Don Letts and roadie Roadent, and was headlined by Dillinger, Leroy Smart and Delroy Wilson. Strummer was disappointed and disillusioned that these performances had been more \"pop\" and \"lightweight\" similar to Ken Boothe's brand of reggae, using Four Tops-like dance routines, and that the acts had been \"performances\" rather than the \"roots rock rebel[lion]\" that he had been hoping for.\n\nThe song then moves away from the disappointing concert to address various other themes, nearly all relating to the state of the United Kingdom at the time. The song first gives an anti-violence message, then addresses the state of \"wealth distribution\" in the UK, promotes unity between black and white youths of the country before moving on to address the state of the British punk rock scene in 1978 which was becoming more mainstream.\n\nIncluded is a jibe at unnamed groups who wear Burton suits. In an \"NME\" article at the time, Strummer said this was targeted at the power pop fad hyped by journalists as the next big thing in 1978. The lyric concludes that the new groups are in it only for money and fame.\n\nThe final lines fret over the social decline of Britain, noting sardonically that things were getting to the point where even Adolf Hitler could expect to be sent a limousine in the unlikely event of flying into London.\n\nThe single was issued in June 1978 with four different colour sleeves – blue, green, yellow and pink.\n\nThis song was one of Joe Strummer's favourites. He continued to play it live with his new band The Mescaleros and it was played at his funeral.\n\nThe song is used in the 2017 film \"T2 Trainspotting\".\n\nThe rhyme scheme is not consistent throughout. In order by verse, it is as follows (along with line-end words): \n\n\n\n\"(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais\" helped the Clash assert themselves as a more versatile band musically and politically than many of their peers, and it broke the exciting but limiting punk mould that had been established by the Sex Pistols; from now on the Clash would be \"the thinking man's yobs\".\n\nRobert Christgau recommended the single in his Consumer Guide published by \"The Village Voice\" on 4 September 1978, and described the song as \"a must\". Denise Sullivan of AllMusic wrote that \"(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais\" \"may have actually been the first song to merge punk and reggae.\" Consequence of Sound described it as \"one of Strummer’s greatest lyrical compositions\".\n\nThe song was ranked at No. 8 among the top \"Tracks of the Year\" for 1978 by \"NME\". In 2004, \"Rolling Stone\" rated the song as No. 430 in its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In December 2003, the British music magazine Uncut ranked the song No. 1 on their \"The Clash's 30 best songs\" list. The list was chosen by a panel including former band members Terry Chimes, Mick Jones, and Paul Simonon In 2015, the Guardian ranked it No. 2 on Dave Simpson's \"The Clash: 10 of the best\" list, and in 2020 it appeared in the number one position in Simpson's list of \"The Clash's 40 greatest songs – ranked!\" Stereogum ranked it No. 4 on their \"The 10 Best Clash Songs\" list.\n\nFighting Gravity covered the song on their 1999 live double album \"Hello Cleveland\".

Some plants in the Asclepiadoideae, now a subfamily of the Apocynaceae, but until recently regarded as the separate family Asclepiadaceae, were also called dogbane even before the two families were united. It is not clear how much earlier the name had been in use in the English language, which originated about 1000 years earlier in mediaeval times. However, centuries before the appearance of the English language, Pedanius Dioscorides, in his \"De Materia Medica\" had already described members of the Apocynaceae, such as \"Apocynum\" and \"Cynanchum\" by names equivalent to \"dogbane\"; \"Apocynum\" literally means \"dog killer\" or \"dog remover\", and \"Cynanchum\" means \"dog strangler\". In modern times some species of \"Nerium\", \"Periploca\" and \"Trachelospermum\", also in the Apocynaceae, are called dogbane or variants such as \"climbing dogbane\".\n\nSome modern sources restrict \"dogbane\" in its strict sense to the genus \"Apocynum\", but it is doubtful that any such narrow definition could be justified even if it were enforceable. More widely, when authors refer to the \"dogbane family\" without qualification, they almost always mean Apocynaceae.\n\nCommon names, either informal or vernacular, are seldom definitive, let alone stable. Some poisonous or offensive plants in practically unrelated families had similar common names in the vernacular and writings of various times; for example an edition \"De Materia Medica\", apparently of the early sixteenth century, mentions that species of \"Aconitum\" (family Ranunculaceae) were known as either \"dog killer\" (or murderer) or \"wolf killer\" (\"\"...Sunt qui Cynoctonon: qui Lycoctonon... uocent\"\") Again, in modern times Isocoma menziesii in the family Asteraceae is known in some regions as dogbane\n\nThe term \"dogbane\", either in genuine confusion or as a deliberate sales ploy, has been applied without obvious justification to various groups of plants, such as some species of \"Plectranthus\", a genus in the catnip subfamily Nepetoideae of the mint family Lamiaceae. None have been reported to be especially harmful to dogs or cats, but some have been said to emit repellent essential oils when bruised, discouraging pets from visiting garden beds.\n"}

Traditionally the term refers to visions of Christ after his ascension, such as the bright light of the Damascus Christophany.\n\nAlso, following the example of Justin Martyr who identified the Angel of the Lord with the Logos, some appearances of angels in the Hebrew Bible are also identified by some Christians as preincarnate appearances of Christ.\n\nThe etymology is from the Greek Χριστός (\"Christos\") and the Greek ending \"phany\", coming from the verb \"φαίνομαι\" (fénome), which means \"to appear, to make oneself visible, to be revealed, to come into light\". This noun is derived by direct comparison with the term theophany (\"theo-phaneia\").\n\nGeorge Balderston Kidd (1852) popularised the term in relation to the identification of angels in the Old Testament as Christ.\n\nThe term was used by Albert Joseph Edmunds (1857–1941) in relation to the revealing of Christ in Christianity and Buddhism.\n\nSince the work of James Borland (1978) usage of the term in conservative Christian publications related to Old Testament appearances of Christ has multiplied exponentially.\n\nA New Testament Christophany is Paul's vision of Christ on the road to Damascus, and the subsequent one of Ananias. Another New Testament example is John's vision of the Son of Man, recounted in -.\n\n was regarded by most Church Fathers and medieval commentators as an appearance by the Logos, or pre-existent Christ, and in art God was always given the features of Jesus until about 1400.\n\nA popular Christian understanding of the relationship between Melchizedek and Jesus is that Melchizedek is an Old Testament Christophany. Romanos the Melodist interpreted the figure with whom Abraham spoke in Genesis 18:1–8 as being Christ himself.\n\nJ. Douglas MacMillan suggests that angel with whom Jacob wrestles is a \"pre-incarnation appearance of Christ in the form of a man.\"\n\nSome church fathers such as Origen and later theologians such as Martin Luther believed another example is the \"Man\" who appears to Joshua, and identifies himself as \"the commander of the army of the LORD.\" (Joshua ). The standard argument that this was in fact Christ is that he accepted Joshua's prostrate worship, whereas angels refuse such worship ; see Revelation . Additionally, he declared the ground to be holy; elsewhere in the Bible, only things or places set aside for God or claimed by him are called holy; see . Jewish commentators reading the same text do not accept that this figure was Christ (or even Adonai), but rather the Archangel Michael.\n\nJonathan Edwards identified an example in Daniel , when the fourth man in the furnace is described as “… and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God\" or \"like a son of the gods.\" The \"Suffering servant\", from the Book of Isaiah is believed by many Christians to be Jesus. The vision of Isaiah (Isaiah 6) may be regarded as a Christophany. It appears to have been seen as such by John the evangelist, who, following a quote from this chapter, adds 'Isaiah said this because he saw His glory and spoke of Him' ()..\n\nA vision is not usually described as a Christophany.\n\n"}

The player can move in any direction, jump, crawl, climb, and shoot. The player must solve puzzles by disabling electronic weapons or through skillful maneuvering.\n\nHowever, when battling a monster (called a \"biological weapon\" in \"Hybrid Heaven\"), the game switches to a completely different mode. The player is constrained to a small room and can no longer jump, crawl, or climb. The monster and the player move around for strategic position in the room. When they are close enough, and have built up enough energy, one or the other will decide to attack. At that point time freezes and a single round similar to a role-playing video game turn ensues: the attacker picks an attack from a list, the defender picks a defense, and the results are displayed. After the attack, both monster and player return to jockeying for position in real-time.\n\nThe Vs. Battle Mode plays like a regular 3D fighting game but with some unique RPG elements. In addition to regular punching, kicking, and grappling attacks, energy can be saved up to five times to allow for combos, achieved by either the player editing their own during a fight (one move at a time), or by choosing preset or saved combos. The battle system of \"Hybrid Heaven\" has a strong emphasis on leveling up. Experience using an offense or a defense directly correlates with the player's statistical abilities when performing that move in the future, with separate statistics for each limb, the torso, and the head. A body part can become injured, which makes it harder to battle a monster.\n\nThe game includes Rumble Pak and Expansion Pak support.\n\nPlayers assume the role of Mr. Diaz, a synthetic human hybrid created by aliens. In the game's introduction, he turns on his masters when he kills a synthetic human intended to replace the President's bodyguard, Johnny Slater. Diaz finds himself in a massive underground installation created by the aliens under Manhattan. As the game progresses, it is revealed that the player is actually assuming the role of Slater, who was disguised as Diaz by the Gargatuans. The Gargatuans are an alien race around three feet tall who, after being betrayed by a member of their species who awoke from hypersleep and piloted the ship to Earth, are forced to help said traitor with his genetic experiments. The alien creates clones and hybrids (a genetic mix of human and Gargatuan DNA, resulting in extra-powerful creatures) and intends to conquer the earth through a replacement of its leaders, beginning with the United States. A few Gargatuans have escaped the traitor, and conduct an underground resistance in the woodwork. They found Johnny after he had been cloned and disguised him as Diaz, who they incapacitated and kept unconscious. Johnny regains his memories, which were blocked while he was disguised. The player then must travel even further down the bunker in the hopes of stopping the aliens from replacing the president with a clone and by request of the Gargatuans to defeat the traitor. Johnny's personal motive to help him stay focused is that he must make it back in time to meet his girlfriend under the Christmas tree on the White House lawn.\n\nEnemies included clones (unremarkable creations, created mainly for menial labor), agents (resemble the public perception of the secret service, men in black suits with sunglasses), mutants (genetic experiments that resulted in vicious creatures, presumably for military), robots (mostly humanoid, but some were straight-out mechs), and hybrids. One hybrid, created to replace the Secretary of Defense (or possibly State), is Johnny's antagonist for much of the game, before a final showdown wherein the alien creature explains much of the plot.\n\nAs games of this genre were seldom seen on the Nintendo 64, the game carried a certain amount of hype to it. For instance, \"N64 Magazine\" gave \"Hybrid Heaven\" many multipage previews and devoted two covers to it. The game was met with mixed reviews ranging from decent scores, such as the 7/10 it received from IGN, to low scores such as the 4.1 it received from GameSpot.\n\nIn Japan, \"Famitsu\" magazine scored the game a 30 out of 40.\n\n\"Next Generation\" reviewed the Nintendo 64 version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \"Had Konami thrown in some variety, such as a city scene, the game could have been so much more than just an interesting hybrid with great graphics and sound. As it is, it's certainly fun, but not quite excellent.\"\n"}

{"id": "2254309", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2254309", "title": "Chenille fabric", "text": "Chenille fabric\n\nChenille may refer to either a type of yarn or fabric made from it. Chenille is the French word for caterpillar whose fur the yarn is supposed to resemble.\n\nAccording to textile historians, chenille-type yarn is a recent invention, dating to the 18th century and believed to have originated in France. The original technique involved weaving a \"leno\" fabric and then cutting the fabric into strips to make the chenille yarn.\n\nAlexander Buchanan, a foreman in a Paisley fabric mill, is credited with introducing chenille fabric to Scotland in the 1830s. Here he developed a way to weave fuzzy shawls. Tufts of coloured wool were woven together into a blanket that was then cut into strips. They were treated by heating rollers in order to create the frizz. This resulted in a very soft, fuzzy fabric named chenille. Another Paisley shawl manufacturer went on to further develop the technique. James Templeton and William Quiglay worked to refine this process while working on imitation oriental rugs. The intricate patterns used to be difficult to reproduce by automation, but this technique solved that issue. These men patented the process but Quiglay soon sold out his interest. Templeton then went on to open a successful carpet company (James Templeton & Co) that became a leading carpet manufacturer throughout the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, Dalton in Northwest Georgia became the tufted bedspread capital of the US thanks to Catherine Evans (later adding Whitener) who initially revived the handcraft technique in the 1890s. Hand-tufted bedspreads with an embroidered appearance became increasingly popular and were referred to as \"chenille\" a term which stuck. With effective marketing, chenille bedspreads appeared in city department stores and tufting subsequently became important to the economic development of North Georgia, maintaining families even through the Depression era. Merchants organised \"spread houses\" where products tufted on farms were finished using heat washing to shrink and \"set\" the fabric. Trucks delivered pattern-stamped sheets and dyed chenille yarns to families for tufting before returning to pay the tufters and collect the spreads for finishing. By this time, tufters all over the state were creating not only bedspreads but pillow shams and mats and selling them by the highway. The first to make a million dollars in the bedspread business, was Dalton County native, B. J. Bandy with the help of his wife, Dicksie Bradley Bandy, by the late 1930s, to be followed by many others.\n\nIn the 1930s, usage for the tufted fabric became widely desirable for throws, mats, bedspreads, and carpets, but not as yet, apparel. Companies shifted handwork from the farms into factories for greater control and productivity, encouraged as they were to pursue centralized production by the wage and hour provisions of the National Recovery Administration's tufted bedspread code. With the trend towards mechanization, adapted sewing machines were used to insert raised yarn tufts.\n\nChenille became popularized for apparel again with commercial production in the 1970s.\n\nStandards of industrial production were not introduced until the 1990s, when the Chenille International Manufacturers Association (CIMA) was formed with the mission to improve and develop the manufacturing processes. From the 1970s each machine head made two chenille yarns straight onto bobbins, a machine could have over 100 spindles (50 heads). Giesse was one of the first major machine manufacturers. Giesse acquired Iteco company in 2010 integrating the chenille yarn electronic quality control directly on their machine. Chenille fabrics are also often used in Letterman jackets also known as \"varsity jackets\", for the letter patches.\n\nThe chenille yarn is manufactured by placing short lengths of yarn, called the \"pile\", between two \"core yarns\" and then twisting the yarn together. The edges of these piles then stand at right angles to the yarn's core, giving chenille both its softness and its characteristic look. Chenille will look different in one direction compared to another, as the fibers catch the light differently. Chenille can appear iridescent without actually using iridescent fibers. The yarn is commonly manufactured from cotton, but can also be made using acrylic, rayon and olefin.\n\nOne of the problems with chenille yarns is that the tufts can work loose and create bare fabric. This was resolved by using a low melt nylon in the core of the yarn and then autoclaving (steaming) the hanks of yarn to set the pile in place.\n\nSince the late 1990s, chenille appeared in quilting in a number of yarns, yards or finishes. As a yarn, it is a soft, feathery synthetic that when stitched onto a backing fabric, gives a velvety appearance, also known as imitation or \"faux chenille\". Real chenille quilts are made using patches of chenille fabric in various patterns and colors, with or without \"ragging\" the seams.\n\nThe chenille effect by ragging the seams, has been adapted by quilters for a casual country look. A quilt with a so-called \"chenille finish\" is known as a \"rag quilt\" or, a \"slash quilt\" due to the frayed exposed seams of the patches and the method of achieving this. Layers of soft cotton are batted together in patches or blocks and sewn with wide, raw edges to the front. These edges are then cut, or slashed, to create a worn, soft, \"chenille\" effect.\n\nMany chenille fabrics should be dry cleaned. If hand or machine-washed, they should be machine-dried using low heat, or as a heavy textile, dried flat to avoid stretching, never hung.\n\n"}

{"id": "2254318", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2254318", "title": "Ezekiel Hart", "text": "Ezekiel Hart\n\nEzekiel Hart (May 15, 1770 – September 16, 1843) was an entrepreneur and politician in British North America. He is often said to be the first Jew to be elected to public office in the British Empire, though this assertion is discredited by the election of Francis Salvador to the South Carolina General Assembly in 1774.\n\nHe was elected three times by the voters of Trois-Rivières to the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada. Some members consistently prevented him from taking his seat by observing that as a Jew, he could not take the oath of office, which included the phrase \"on the true faith of a Christian\".\n\nHart was born May 15, 1767 at Trois-Rivières, Quebec, to Aaron Hart and Dorothea Judah. His father was member of the British forces, and a well-known and successful businessman in Lower Canada.\n\nHart obtained part of his education in the United States. In 1792 his father involved him in his fur trade activities. On January 29, 1794 he married Frances Lazarus, niece of Ephraim Hart. He, along with his brother Benjamin, served as a colonel in the militia during the American War of Independence.\n\nHart and his brothers Moses and Benjamin established a brewery in Trois-Rivières, the \"M. and E. Hart Company\", in 1796. He remained a partner for only a few years. He then went into the import and export trade, owned a general store, and acquired property. Ezekiel Hart inherited the seigneury of Bécancour and bought land at Trois-Rivières and Cap-de-la-Madeleine.\n\nOn April 11, 1807, Ezekiel Hart was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada over three other candidates, obtaining 59 out of the 116 votes cast. (This was not the first time a Jew had run for election: Moses Hart, Ezekiel's older brother, had run unsuccessfully for a seat in William-Henry in 1796). The election having taken place on Shabbat, Hart refused to take his oath of allegiance at that time. He would await the opening of the session of the legislature in Quebec the following January.\n\nHart caused controversy when, being Jewish he swore his oath on a Hebrew Bible, instead of on the Christian Bible, and with his head covered in preparation for taking up his seat on January 29, 1808. (At the time, Jews were accustomed to swearing in courts of law in this manner.) The next day an objection was raised by the attorney general, Jonathan Sewell, seconded by Justice Pierre-Amable de Bonne, that the oath was not taken in the manner required for sitting in the assembly — an oath of abjuration, which would have required Hart to swear \"on the true faith of a Christian\". Sewell moved that the assembly pass a resolution to this effect, and that Hart be provided with a copy of the resolution, \"to the end that he may thereupon pursue such further course in the premises as the law of Parliament may be found to require\".\n\nShortly after, Thomas Coffin, the runner-up in the election in Trois-Rivières, petitioned the assembly, calling for the removal of Hart because, as a Jew, he was \"not capable of being elected to serve in the House of Assembly, or of taking the oaths requires, or sitting or voting in the Assembly,\" and asking that the election be considered null and void and that Coffin be given the seat for Trois-Rivières in his place.\n\nOn April 18, \"Le Canadien\", the mouthpiece of the Canadian Party, published a poem decrying the choice of a Jew for a seat as even more foolish than Caligula's appointment of his horse as a Roman consul and priest. In the same issue, a more ideologically explicit attack was launched. Many antisemitic letters to the editor were published, one of which argued that the electors of Trois-Rivières should be reprimanded for electing a Jew to office.\n\nHart was a personal friend of many Quebec authorities, notably Sir James Henry Craig, Governor-General and Lieutenant Governor of Lower Canada, insomuch that he was godfather to one of his children, Ira James. Craig tried to protect Hart, but the legislature dismissed him.\n\nHart petitioned the legislature, saying that, while he believed that he was justified in the law in taking a seat by means of the oath used by Jews in the courts, he was willing to swear the oaths used for those elected to the assembly. After some deliberation, however, on February 20, 1808, the assembly resolved by a vote of 35 to 5 that \"Ezekiel Hart, Esquire, professing the Jewish religion cannot take a seat, nor sit, nor vote, in this House.\"\n\nIn 1808, new elections were held, and once again Trois-Rivières returned Hart as one of its two representatives. This time, to avoid controversy, Hart took the oath in the same fashion as a Christian.\n\nIn his presentation to the assembly, Pierre-Stanislas Bédard, the leader of \"Le Canadien\", argued against granting a seat to Hart in the assembly. He claimed that\n\nno Christian nation had granted Jews the rights of citizens, not for unjust reasons, but because they themselves do not wish to be part of any country. They may make a country their residence to pursue their business dealings, but never their home. This state of affairs is a result of the Jewish tradition, which requires Jews to wait for the messiah, their prince; while waiting, they cannot pledge allegiance to any other prince.\n\nWhen the assembly finally reconvened in 1809, Hart sat as a member for Trois-Rivières for a few days. After ascertaining that Hart had been expelled the previous year, the assembly voted to expel him again.\n\nThe events of 1807–1809 are known to many as \"the Hart Affair\" (French: \"L'Affaire Hart\"). Some historians explain these events as the result of the rivalry between the contemporary English and French factions in Lower Canada rather than antisemitism. Some have interpreted this affair as proof of ongoing hostility toward Jews among French Canadians. Ezekiel Hart stated that, with only one exception, his opponents were Catholics, and he assumed they were encouraged in voting against him by their priests.\n\nHart did not run for public office again. He continued to live in Trois-Rivières where he was a successful businessman and well-respected member of the community. He served in the militia during the War of 1812, serving as a lieutenant under Lieutenant Colonel Charles-Michel d'Irumberry de Salaberry in the 8th Battalion of Trois-Rivières militia. He was later promoted colonel in 1830.\n\nHis wife died on April 21, 1821, at Trois-Rivières.\n\nOn June 5, 1832, mainly because of Hart's activism, the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada, under the influence and authority of Louis-Joseph Papineau, passed a bill (the 1832 Emancipation Act) that ultimately guaranteed full rights to people practising the Jewish faith, 27 years before anywhere else in the British Empire. Papineau, who became speaker of the Assembly in 1815, earlier had supported Hart's expulsion in 1809. Samuel Becancour Hart, Ezekiel's son, had a strong influence on the legislation, as he, along with several other important Jewish figures, had sent a letter to King William, submitting a petition to the Legislative Assembly demanding that Jews be allowed to hold public office.\n\nMany of Hart's family members were also important people in the community. His brother Benjamin was an important businessman at Montreal. Because of his work, the Legislative Assembly granted Jews the right to erect a new synagogue and to keep registers of births, marriages and deaths within their community. His cousin Henry Judah was later elected to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada for Champlain.\n\nEzekiel Hart died on September 16, 1843 at Trois-Rivières, at the age of 76. A prominent member of the community, he was accorded an impressive funeral in which all the stores in Trois-Rivières closed, and the 81st Foot paid him final honours. He was buried in the second Jewish cemetery in Trois-Rivières.\n\nHart had dictated his last will on June 20, 1839. At the time of his death, he lived in an enormous well-furnished house with 16 rooms. He was survived by his ten children: Samuel Becancour, Harriet, Aaron Ezekiel, Esther Elizabeth, Miriam, Carolina Athalia, Henry, Julia, Abraham Kitzinger, and Adolphus Mordecai.\n\nIn October 1909, the remains of Ezekiel Hart and others buried in the Jewish cemetery on Prison Street in Trois-Rivières were moved to Montreal's Mount Royal Cemetery of the Congregation of Spanish and Portuguese Jews.\n\n\n\n"}

The first Venona transcript referencing the Perlo group gives the names of all the members in clear text, as code names had not yet been assigned.\n\nBentley advised that Jacob Golos informed her he had made contact with a group in Washington, D.C. through Earl Browder. After the death of Golos in 1943, two meetings were arranged with this group in 1944. The first meeting was arranged by Browder and was held in early 1944. The meetings were held in the apartment of John Abt in New York City and Bentley was introduced to four individuals identified as Victor Perlo, Charles Kramer, Harry Magdoff and Edward Fitzgerald.\n\nOn August 3, 1948, Whittaker Chambers testified before HUAC: In his memoir (1952), Chambers recalled: \nThe Perlo group fits into the Venona project information when transcript # 687 of 13 May 1944 is examined. Iskhak Akhmerov in New York City personally prepared a report to MGB headquarters in Moscow advising that some unspecified action had been taken regarding Elizabeth Bentley in accordance with instructions of Earl Browder. Akhmerov then made reference to winter and also to Harry Magdoff. This latter reference was then followed by a statement that in Bentley's opinion \"they\" are reliable. It was also mentioned that no one had interested himself in their possibilities.\n\nThe name Golovin was mentioned, and it was then reported that Victor Perlo, Charles Kramer, Edward Fitzgerald and Harry Magdoff would take turns coming to New York every two weeks. Akhmerov said Kramer and Fitzgerald knew Nathan Gregory Silvermaster, whose cover name was later changed to \"Robert\".\n\nAllen Weinstein and Alexander Vassiliev in \"Haunted Wood\", a book written from an examination of KGB Archives in Moscow, report the KGB credits the Perlo group members with having sent, among other items, the following 1945 U.S. Government documents to Moscow:\n\"February\"\n\"March\"\n\"April\"\n\"June\"\nData concerning plans for a 1945–1946 aircraft production from the WPB;\n\"August\"\n\"October\"\n\nVictor Perlo headed the Perlo group. Perlo was originally allegedly a member of the Ware group before World War II. After receiving a master's degree in mathematics from Columbia University in 1933, Perlo worked at a number of New Deal government agencies among a group of economists known as \"Harry Hopkins' bright young men.\" The group worked, among other things, for creation and implementation of the WPA jobs program, and helped push through unemployment compensation, the Wagner National Labor Relations Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, and Social Security. During World War II, Perlo served in several capacities, working first as chief of the Aviation Section of the War Production Board, then in the Office of Price Administration, and later for the Treasury Department. Perlo left the government in 1947. Perlo also worked for the Brookings Institution and wrote \"American Imperialism\". Perlo's code name in Soviet intelligence was \"Eck\" and \"Raid\" appearing in Venona project as \"Raider\".\n\n\n\n"}

The State House is currently managed by the Office of Legislative Management of the Connecticut General Assembly.\nThe exterior building and the Senate have been restored to its original Federal style; the Representative's chamber is Victorian, and the halls and courtroom are Colonial Revival.\n\nThe Hartford State House is, in appearance, very similar to the Town Hall of Liverpool, England, built in the mid-18th century and perhaps depicted in one of Bulfinch's architecture books. However, all materials came from the United States. Its first story is 20 feet high and constructed from Portland, Connecticut brownstone. The second and third stories are brick patterned in Flemish bond. The cornice is wooden.\n\nThe State House has been modified somewhat since it was first built. As originally constructed, the building had neither balustrade or cupola, but the balustrade was added in the early 19th century for the protection of firemen, and the cupola was constructed in 1827 with its bell and John Stanwood's statue of Justice. An original (1796) stone spiral staircase behind the northern arch, designed by Asher Benjamin, led to the second and third floors; it no longer exists. In 1814, the Hartford Convention was held there. In 1839, the start of the \"Amistad\" trial was held there.\n\nThe building had been in danger of closing in 2008 due to financial constraints. State and Hartford officials have recently signed a 99-year lease placing Connecticut's Old State House under new management. The lease puts the city-owned historic building under the control of the state Office of Legislative Management.\n\nIt was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1960.\n\nExhibits focus on the history of Hartford and important events in Connecticut history. Visitors can also tour the original legislative rooms.\n\nThe Museum of Natural and Other Curiosities is located on the third floor of the Old State House. The museum features a recreation of Joseph Steward's original 1798 collection of natural history displays and curiosities.\n\nOver the years, several eyewitnesses (mostly staff members) have claimed to experience paranormal activity inside the building. In 2009, the Old State House was investigated by the investigators of TAPS on episode 524 of the Sci Fi Channel program \"Ghost Hunters\". The episode aired on December 9, 2009. Following the investigation, TAPS announced that they captured audio of strange sounds inside the building. Something that sounded like a doorknob being opened was recorded in the Senate Room while no one was in it, and audio of what sounded like a woman sighing was captured in the Steward Museum room when no female team members were present in the building. Before giving a final verdict of \"haunted or not\", the team plans to head back to the Old State House for a more in depth investigation. So until then, this case remains open.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2254385", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2254385", "title": "SK Gaming", "text": "SK Gaming\n\nSK Gaming is a professional esports organization based in Germany that has teams across the world competing in different titles. SK is particularly known for their success in \"Counter-Strike\" (CS) tournaments. SK's Brazilian \"CS\" team won the ESL One Cologne 2016 Major. SK currently has players and teams competing in \"League of Legends\" and \"Hearthstone\". SK Gaming was founded in 1997 by a small group of \"Quake\" players in Oberhausen.\n\nSchroet Kommando was founded in 1997 as a German \"Quake\" clan by four brothers and three accomplices in Oberhausen. The original line-up of Schroet Kommando consisted of Ralf \"Griff\" Reichert, Daniel \"Godlike\" Beames, Tim \"Burke\" Reichert, Benjamin \"Kane\" Reichert, Kristof \"Speed\" Salwiczek, Carsten \"Storch\" Kramer and Sven \"Ramses\" Tümmers. According to Ralf Reichert, the original naming of the organization originated from one of the members repeatedly shouting \"Schröt!\" This was a common occurrence from whenever a double-barreled shotgun would be handled, due to the translation meaning \"\"shrapnel\"\". Eventually, the team adopted this into their name, thus becoming \"Schroet Kommando\". Since then, the organization began using their abbreviation more often, until it eventually became SK Gaming.\n\nInitially, the Beames family home operated as the Schroet Kommando headquarters, concentrating primarily upon the \"Quake series\". Early on, Schroet Kommando became one of the first clans to feature an all-female team; the most notable of which was Annemarie \"XS\" Warnkross, who is a notable current television host on German TV. The organization expanded into \"Counter-Strike\", where it became known as one of the most-successful squads in all of Germany. In September 2001, Andreas \"bds\" Thorstensson merged his \"Geekboys\" team and news syndicate with that of SK Gaming, with a long-term prospect of emphasizing the success of his own organization. Thorstensson revolutionized electronic sports by having SK act as the first organization to have payable premium services (\"\"SK Insider\"\", a virtual marketplace in which subscribers could download demos (replays), mods and add-ons better and earlier than others, talk directly to SK gamers etc.). The organization's international Counter-Strike success came when they signed on the players of the successful Swedish \"Counter-Strike\" clan Ninjas in Pyjamas. In 2003, SK Gaming became the first electronic sports organization to contract players, beginning with the SK Sweden \"Counter-Strike\" squad.\n\nThe 2006 season brought no successes to the \"Counter-Strike\" team, the most notable of which, the team failed to qualify for the Electronic Sports World Cup, in which Sweden was represented by rivals Ninjas in Pyjamas and the developing Fnatic team. Thereafter, the team managed to qualify for the KODE5 finals, where they won two matches and lost to the Brazilians from Made in Brazil during the group stages. They then lost to Wisdom Nerve Victory in the single elimination round, placing fifth to eighth overall. Success did come for the \"Quake 4\" squad however, as the Swedish star player Johan \"Toxic\" Quick managed to win eight out of the ten major tournaments during that year, including four out of five World Championships. Meanwhile, the \"FIFA 06\" squad had a successful year, as the team managed to win the prestigious Electronic Sports League Pro Series twice, and the German player Daniel \"hero\" Schellhase won the World Cyber Games championship.\n\nIn 2008, SK Gaming began to invest in \"World of Warcraft\" and shortly before the release of the Sunwell Plateau, the final and most challenging raid encounter of \"\", the organization sponsored Curse, one of the highest-ranked guilds at the time. SK Gaming's German competitor, Mousesports, had significantly commanded the recognition with maintaining Nihilum, the most-successful guild in the world, achieving a strong majority of world first raid kills. The newly recruited SK.PvE squad, however, had a strong winning streak during the Sunwell Plateau and completed most of the instance's boss kills first. Due to differences in interests, the PvE team was dismissed, with a stronger emphasis upon the PvP aspect. Near the end of 2008, SK Gaming entered the competitive console scene, with acquisition of a German Xbox team.\n\nBeginning in the fall of 2009, the \"Counter-Strike\" squad would encounter long-term stability issues, as long-time member Kristoffer \"Tentpole\" Nordlund and Marcus \"zet\" Sundström were removed from the roster for disagreements and misrepresentation issues. The roster began refocusing with the acquisition of H2k Gaming players Johan \"face\" Klasson and Frej \"kHRYSTAL\" Sjöström, which gained its best respective victory two weeks after the change with a gold medal victory against Fnatic. 2009 marked the conclusion of managing director and partial owner Andreas Thorstensson's tenure, as he stepped down from SK Gaming to further pursue his web development career, giving full executive authority to Alexander T. Müller-Rodic, thereby making SK Gaming a singular German organization. Alongside Thorstensson's departure, the highly successful \"Warcraft III\" departed, as well, in order to make way for SK Gaming to operate as a more conservative business. To accommodate for the \"Counter-Strike\" stability issues, SK Gaming announced the replacement of Frej \"kHRYSTAL\" Sjöström with the former Fnatic player Rasmus \"GuX\" Ståhl. In one of the greatest controversies in electronic sports history, the organization Fnatic arranged for Rasmus \"GuX\" Ståhl to rejoin their \"Counter-Strike\" team, after a series of failed performances. Ståhl did not technically sign his contract with SK after five months, while still receiving months of payment and was intended to attend Arbalet Dallas with his team, after his plane ticket was purchased. However, it was revealed through Ståhl's message logs that Fnatic had paid him not to use SK's ticket to Dallas Despite the closure of SK's investment into the Action RTS scene with the departure of its \"Defense of the Ancients\" team in 2009, SK Gaming took in a squad for the relatively unknown title \"Avalon Heroes\" in 2010, as well as an American \"Heroes of Newerth\" squad and a European \"League of Legends\" squad. In August 2010, welcomed back \"Warcraft III\" veteran Fredrik \"MaDFroG\" Johansson, with the creation of the organization's \"StarCraft II\" division. 2010 marked the final year in which SK Gaming would support \"World of Warcraft\", with the removal of its European, American and Asian squads, as well as the unannounced closure of its Sansibar squad. On 3 December, it was announced that the German \"FIFA\" duo of Daniel \"hero\" Schellhase and Dennis \"styla\" Schellhase would be retiring from eSports, following a joint brotherly career as the most-successful virtual sports players of all time. In a massive \"Counter-Strike\" roster overhaul on 7 December, SK Gaming signed on the departing Fnatic players Patrik \"f0rest\" Lindberg and Christopher \"GeT_RiGhT\" Alesund, (the latter of whom played for the organization previously), while also seeing the departure of Dennis \"walle\" Wallenberg. On 21 December, it was announced that SK Gaming would be closing its \"Counter-Strike\" female team, as well as its short-lived \"Counter-Strike: Source\" team, in order to retain a more conservative roster for 2011.\n\nThe first development of 2011 constituted the trimming of the Xbox 360 sports roster and the addition of a competitive \"\" team, as well as the addition of newcomers Hun \"inuh\" Park and Jimmy \"jimpo\" Wölfinger to the \"StarCraft II\" team. These new \"StarCraft II\" players would, however, become the entirety of the division, as it was soon announced afterwards that Fredrik \"MaDFroG\" Johansson would not be given a contract for 2011. On 16 January, it was announced that SK Gaming would be adding another United States \"Counter-Strike\" division, which would include former SK Gaming female member Alice \"ali\" Lew. On 28 February, SK Gaming announced that Toshiba would be taking the reins of main sponsor from Acer Inc., which had served as the primary sponsor since 2009. On 12 March, SK Gaming announced the additions of the up and rising \"StarCraft II\" Dane Johannes Sabroe \"Joe\" Witt, as well as a \"Bloodline Champions\" squad. On 4 April, five-year \"Counter-Strike\" player, Jimmy \"allen\" Allén, announced his inactivity, due to considerable health ailments, setting the stage for the trial replacement, Dennis \"dennis\" Edman. However, on 23 May, SK Gaming declared that Edman would no longer be playing for the organization and that Allén would participate in the WCG Swedish Qualifier the following weekend. On 29 May, however, a permanent replacement was made with the still-contracted Fnatic player and former SK stand-in, Marcus \"Delpan\" Larsson. On 23 June, following a disappointing Dreamhack appearance, SK Gaming's \"League of Legends\" team underwent a massive overhaul, removing the vast majority of the squad, but bringing in recently dismissed players from other professional organizations. On 1 July, it was announced that the SK Gaming's \"Heroes of Newerth\" team would be replaced by the former squad of Evil Geniuses. On Independence Day of 2011, SK Gaming released its European \"StarCraft II\" roster consisting of Hun \"inuh\" Park, Jimmy \"jimpo\" Wölfinger and Johannes Sabroe \"Joe\" Witt, citing unsatisfactory performances. The squad was remade, however, on 15 July, with the partnership with the South Korean pro-gamer house Old Generations, for SK Gaming to sponsor Min Chul \"MC\" Jang and Yoon-Yeol \"NaDa\" Lee for international events. Due to long-term prospective differences, the \"Heroes of Newerth\" once again parted ways with the organization, during SK's attendance at Gamescom. SK Gaming would invest in a different sector of the action RTS scene, however, with the acquisition of an all-Danish \"Dota 2\" squad previously known as Next Evolution ESC, in November 2011, but dismissed the team for the unpredictability of the relatively young scene for the game.\n\nIn early 2012, the partnership between SK Gaming and Old Generations ended, with Min Chul \"MC\" Jang joining the organization, while Yoon-Yeol \"NaDa\" Lee remained with oGs. In a surprising move, SK Gaming announced that the \"Counter-Strike\" team would be removing the player with the shortest tenure, Marcus \"Delpan\" Larsson, in favor of their first permanent Danish member and former mTw ace, Martin Alexander \"trace\" Bang Heldt at the end of January. On 13 April, however, Larsson once more returned to the team, replacing Heldt. On 27 July 2012, it was announced that SK Gaming's \"Counter-Strike\" division would lose Robert \"RobbaN\" Dahlström, Patrik \"f0rest\" Lindberg and Christopher \"GeT_RiGhT\" Alesund, as well as team captain Anton Budak, due to SK's decision to not send the team to GameGune 2012. On 30 July, SK Gaming announced the final closing of the \"Counter-Strike\" division.\n\nOn 15 January 2013, it was determined that SteelSeries has ended their ten-year sponsorship of SK Gaming, in addition to Evil Geniuses. In an annual wrap-up, SK's CEO Alexander T. Müller-Rodic announced the departures of \"League of Legends\" players Carlos \"ocelote\" Rodríguez Santiago, Patrick \"Nyph\" Funke, as well as the sole \"StarCraft II\" player Min Chul \"MC\" Jang and sports player Bruce \"Spank\" Grannec.\n\nIn January 2017 it was announced that Visa would be a sponsor of SK Gaming.\n\nSK Gaming is a Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung (GmbH), with the owners being Alexander Müller-Rodic, Andreas Thorstensson and Ralf Reichert, the former who still operates full-time as the managing director of the company. SK Gaming operates largely due to its sponsorships, most-notably by Toshiba, Kingston Technology and Bigben. The company also finances itself by the \"SK Insider\" subscription service. However, according to Rodic, the vast majority of the company's funds originates from sponsorships.\n\nRiot Games announced on 20 November 2018 that SK Gaming would be one of ten franchise partners participating in the newly rebranded League of Legends European Championship (LEC). On 20 December 2018, the organisation announced it had signed top laner Jorge \"Werlyb\" Casanovas Moreno-Torres, jungler Oskar \"Selfmade\" Boderek, mid laner Choi \"Pirean\" Jun-sik, bot laner Jus \"Crownshot\" Marusic and support Han \"Dreams\" Min-kook for their starting roster in the 2019 LEC Spring Split.\n\n\n\"Bold denotes a \"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"World Championships\"\n\n\n\n\"World Championships\"\n\n\n"}

Most plants are made up of stems, roots, leaves, flowers, and produce fruits containing seeds. Humans most commonly eat the seeds (e.g. maize, wheat), fruit (e.g. tomato, avocado, banana), flowers (e.g. broccoli), leaves (e.g. lettuce, spinach, and cabbage), roots (e.g. carrots, beets), and stems (e.g. asparagus, ginger) of many plants. There are also a few edible petioles (also known as leaf stems) such as celery or rhubarb.\n\nPlant stems have a variety of functions. Stems support the entire plant and have buds, leaves, flowers, and fruits. Stems are also a vital connection between leaves and roots. They conduct water and mineral nutrients through xylem tissue from roots upward, and organic compounds and some mineral nutrients through phloem tissue in any direction within the plant. Apical meristems, located at the shoot tip and axillary buds on the stem, allow plants to increase in length, surface, and mass. In some plants, such as cactus, stems are specialized for photosynthesis and water storage.\n\nTypical stems are located above ground, but there are modified stems that can be found either above or below ground. Modified stems located above ground are phylloids, stolons, runners, or spurs. Modified stems located below ground are corms, rhizomes, and tubers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are also many wild edible plant stems. In North America, these include the shoots of woodsorrel (usually eaten along with the leaves), chickweeds, galinsoga, common purslane, Japanese knotweed, winter cress and other wild mustards, thistles (de-thorned), stinging nettles (cooked), bellworts, violets, amaranth and slippery elm, among many others. Also, some wild plants with edible rhizomes (underground, horizontal stems) can be found, such as arrowhead or cattail. Wild edible stems, like their domestic relatives, are usually only good when young and growing. Many of these also require preparation (as do many domestic plants, such as the potato), so it is wise to read up on the plant before experimenting with eating it.\n\n"}

His later career included command of the liner RMS \"Empress of Britain\" and the management of the London office of a major transatlantic shipping company. Following his retirement in 1951, Stuart moved into his sister's cottage in Kent and died three years later. A sometimes irascible man, he was reportedly embarrassed by any fuss surrounding his celebrity and was known to exclaim \"Mush!\" at any demonstration of strong emotion.\n\nRonald Niel Stuart was born in 1886 in Liverpool to Neil Stuart and Mary Harrison, both from experienced seafaring families. Neil Sr. had been born on Prince Edward Island in Canada and had met and married Mary in Montreal. She was the daughter of a master mariner from Australia. In the 1880s the family moved to Liverpool, where Stuart was born as the youngest of six children. Neil worked in the city as a dock superintendent and owner of a wholesale tea shop before dying suddenly while preparing for a return to the Merchant Navy.\n\nStuart was by this time a stocky, blonde, blue-eyed man described as \"powerful\" but \"very bleak and penetrating\". He was initially educated at Shaw Street College, but following his father's death was forced to leave and take a job as a clerk in an office. Stuart's son commented that \"He hated it [the job]. He hated Liverpool\". In 1902, Stuart decided to leave the city and find work in a different environment. He took an apprenticeship with the shipping company Steele & Co and was sent to learn his trade on the sailing barque \"Kirkhill\".\n\nIn 1905 the \"Kirkhill\" was wrecked on a rock near the Falkland Islands. Stuart survived the sinking and returned to England to continue his training. He was posted to a new ship upon his return but she too was wrecked by a cyclone off the Florida coast. Eventually, after several years service he achieved his mariner's qualifications and gained a job with the Allan Line as a junior officer. He then served in a variety of sailing and steam ships traveling across most of the world. In 1910, the Allan Line was taken over by the Canadian Pacific Line and he continued working with the company's new owners as a junior ship's officer.\n\nAt the outbreak of World War I Stuart was called up to service, as an officer in the Royal Naval Reserve. He was originally posted as a junior officer on board the old and obsolete destroyer HMS \"Opossum\" in Plymouth. This ship was used for harbour patrols and intercepting neutral merchant ships and other work Stuart considered tedious. He became increasingly impatient with the life and repeatedly applied to his senior officers with requests for transfer; at one point he even requested that he be commissioned into the army. All of these were turned down, with increasing levels of hostility from his commanders, one of whom was reported to have told him to \"Go to hell! And shut the door behind you!\"\n\nIn the spring of 1916 he was transferred as first lieutenant to a Q-ship under Gordon Campbell. A Q-ship was a merchant ship with hidden weaponry, commanded secretly by the navy and manned by a Royal Navy crew. When attacked by a submarine, the Q-ship would feign damage until the enemy was close enough to engage and then reveal its weapons to counter-attack. Campbell, a major proponent of Q-ship strategy, was impressed with Stuart's stubborn refusal to accept the two years of rejection and brought him in to replace an officer whose nerves had cracked under the strain of Q-ship operations.\n\nStuart's experience in merchant shipping proved invaluable to his work and he soon had the crew of Q5 (also known as HMS \"Farnborough\") disciplined and the ship well maintained and run. Campbell himself was very pleased with his executive officer, declaring him \"on the top line\". Stuart and Campbell would later fall out over Stuart's belief that Campbell was exaggerating the danger of Q-ship service, Stuart comparing his own life favourably with service in the trenches.\n\nHis first year of Q-ship service was frustrating for Stuart and the crew. Although, prior to his attachment to the ship, \"Farnborough\" had succeeded in sinking an enemy submarine (the \"U-68\" in March 1916), there had been no successes since. In February 1917, Campbell decided that in order to properly invite an attack, the \"Farnborough\" would have to actually be torpedoed before combat and then engage the submarine as she closed to finish the job with shellfire. On 17 February this theory was proven correct off Southern Ireland when the lone \"Farnborough\" was struck by a torpedo fired at extreme range. Campbell intentionally failed to evade the missile and the ship took the blow in the hold, causing some minor injuries to the crew but serious damage to the ship. The crew were well rehearsed and the \"panic party\" took to their boats with a great show of alarm and disorder while the gun crews manned positions on their hidden weapons. When four lifeboats had been released and the ship had settled in the water and was clearly sinking, the submarine \"U-83\" pulled up just ten yards (9m) from the wreck. A hail of shot was then unleashed by the \"Farnborough's\" remaining crew from their six-pounder gun and several machine guns into the stationary submarine. The very first shot decapitated the German captain Bruno Hoppe and the U-boat was rapidly reduced to a battered wreck. Eight German sailors escaped the submarine before it sank but only two could be pulled from the water, one of whom subsequently died from his wounds.\n\nThe \"Farnborough\" too was sinking from her torpedo damage. Realising this, Campbell left the men in the boats, destroyed all confidential papers and radioed for help. His unorthodox message read: \"Q5 slowly sinking respectfully wishes you goodbye\". This message reached nearby naval shipping, and within an hour the destroyers HMS \"Narwhal\" and HMS \"Buttercup\" arrived and began to tow the stricken ship back to land. During the night a depth charge accidentally exploded on board \"Farnborough\" and the tow was dropped. Campbell ordered the twelve men remaining aboard into a lifeboat and attempted to take a final survey of his vessel, only to be driven back by another exploding depth charge. On returning to the rail he discovered that Stuart had disobeyed his order and remained on board, to make sure his captain disembarked safely. The tow was later reattached and the battered \"Farnborough\" beached at Mill Cove, in no fit state to return to sea. Campbell was awarded the Victoria Cross in recognition of his service in the action and £1,000 of prize money was shared among the crew. Stuart and Engineer-Lieutenant Len Loveless were both presented with the Distinguished Service Order.\n\nFollowing the action Stuart remained with Campbell and Loveless as Inspectors of Shipping, choosing those vessels they believed to be best suited to Q-ship work for naval service. After some time ashore all three returned to sea in a vessel they had personally chosen, an old, battered tramp steamer named SS \"Vittoria\". Renaming it , they armed their vessel with a gun, two twelve pounders, two machine guns, torpedo tubes and depth charges. Thus armed the \"Pargust\" departed on her first patrol to the same grounds where \"U-83\" had been sunk, in the waters south of Ireland. For the first few days her duties consisted only of rescuing survivors from sunken cargo ships but with increasing German activity, an attack was expected at any moment. On 7 June 1917, \"Pargust\" was suddenly struck by a torpedo fired at very close range from an unseen German submarine. Unlike the \"Farnborough\" action, the damage done to the \"Pargust\" was immense. The ship was holed close to the waterline, and its cover was almost blown when one of the twelve pounder gun ports was blasted free from its mounting; it was only the quick thinking of sailor William Williams, who took the full weight of the gun port on himself, that prevented the gun being exposed. One petty officer was killed and a number wounded.\n\nBy this stage in the war, the German submarine authorities had become aware of the existence of Q-ships and Captain Ernst Rosenow of was taking no risks with his target, remaining at distance watching the staged panicked evacuation of the ship. While the hidden gun crews watched the enemy approach the lifeboats, the officer in charge of the boats, Lieutenant Francis Hereford, realised that the submarine would follow his movements, as its commander assumed him to be the captain. Hereford therefore ordered his men to row back towards the ship, thus luring the enemy into range. This made the submarine commander believe that the ship's crew were planning to regain their vessel and he immediately closed to just , surfaced and began angrily semaphoring to the \"survivors\" in the boats. This was exactly what the gun crews had been waiting for and a volley of fire was directed at the U-boat. Numerous holes were blown in the conning tower and the submarine desperately attempted to flee on the surface before slowing down and heeling over, trailing oil. The gun crews then stopped firing only for the submarine to suddenly restart its engines and attempt to escape. In a final barrage of fire the submarine was hit fatally, a large explosion blowing the vessel in two. Rosenow and 22 of his crew were killed, while two survivors were rescued by the panic party.\n\nThe wrecked \"Pargust\" was taken in tow by HMS \"Crocus\", and HMS \"Zinnia\" and reached Queenstown barely afloat nearly two days later. The port's admiral congratulated the crew personally on their arrival. As before, the crew were awarded £1,000 prize money and several awards were promised. Unusually, the Admiralty were unable to decide who among the ship's crew should receive the Victoria Cross as all were deemed to have participated in the action with equal valour. It was thus decided for the first time, under article 13 of the Victoria Cross's royal warrant, that one officer and one enlisted man would be granted the award following a ballot by the ship's company. After the vote, from which Campbell abstained, the Victoria Crosses were awarded to Stuart and William Williams. Fourteen other crew members were awarded medals, including DSOs for Campbell and Hereford. In addition, every sailor had his participation in the action and subsequent ballot noted on his service records.\n\nDue to the official secrecy surrounding the activities of the Q-ships, Stuart's and Williams's Victoria Crosses were announced without fanfare or explanation of their actions; even the \"Pargust\"s name was omitted from the citation. The full account of the action was not published until after the armistice in November 1918. Stuart was noted as the first Anglo-Canadian to receive the Victoria Cross and his obituary later stated that in the action, \"his gallantry stood out\". The medal was presented to him in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace by King George V on 23 July 1917.\n\nIn addition to receiving the Victoria Cross, Stuart was promoted to lieutenant commander and given his own command, HMS \"Tamarisk\". \"Tamarisk\" was a small sloop built in 1916 that was capable of being disguised as a merchant vessel and used as a Q-ship, designated Q11.\n\nA few months after assuming command, on 15 October 1917, Stuart was on hand to rescue the United States Navy destroyer USS \"Cassin\" after she was torpedoed by \"U-61\" in heavy weather. Along with one crewmember killed and nine wounded, the \"Cassin\" had lost her entire stern including the rudder and was in danger of sinking. The dead crew member was Osmond Ingram, who had died throwing burning munitions overboard and was later posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. Twenty miles from the Irish coast and in total darkness, the \"Tamarisk\" not only found the crippled ship but was able to come alongside in high seas and a strong gale and pass across a tow line. Twice during the night the tow broke and twice it was reconnected as the battle to save the ship continued. The next morning several trawlers came to the aid of the Q-ship and together they enabled the \"Cassin\" to make port, saving the ship and her crew. Ten years after the \"Cassin's\" rescue the US Navy awarded Stuart the Navy Cross in recognition of his part in the operation; it was a rare presentation to a sailor of a foreign navy and the only occasion in which the recipient also possessed the Victoria Cross.\nThe remainder of the war was quiet for Stuart, achieving no further successes against submarines. Upon the armistice the full details of his Victoria Cross action were revealed and, in 1919, he was mentioned in despatches in recognition of the service he had performed during the Q-ship operations. As further recognition of his overall efforts against the German submarine campaign, the French government presented him with the Croix de Guerre.\n\nIn 1919, Stuart returned to Canadian Pacific, his maritime reputation on both sides of the Atlantic greatly enhanced by his war record. In the same year he met and married his wife Evelyn, with whom he would have three sons and two daughters.\n\nAfter post-war service on a succession of merchant ships, Stuart was provided with his first merchant command, the steam freighter SS \"Brandon\", in 1927. After a short period in charge, he was again promoted and transferred, taking up the role of staff captain on the liner RMS \"Empress of Australia\".\n\nJust a year later he again moved, becoming full captain on the 15,000-ton liner SS \"Minnedosa\" – an older ship that transported immigrants to Canada. Stuart was one of a number of Royal Naval Reserve officers employed by Canadian Pacific, part of a deliberate recruitment policy by the company. In 1929, he was given his biggest command yet as he took over the newly completed 20,000-ton ocean liner SS \"Duchess of York\". He commanded her for five years along her route from Liverpool to Saint John, New Brunswick stopping at Belfast and Greenock. He also briefly commanded her on the New York City to Bermuda route. It was during this period, in 1929, that he was awarded the Decoration for Officers of the Royal Naval Reserve (RD) in honour of his long service and in 1935 he was made a full Naval Reserve Captain. He maintained his connection with the RNR throughout his life, becoming Honorary President of the RNR Officer's Club and a part-time naval \"aide-de-camp\" to King George VI in 1941 – a position he held part-time throughout World War II. A special warrant was written in 1927 that allowed him to fly the Blue Ensign from any ship, mercantile or military, which he commanded.\n\nIn 1931, while he was in command of the \"Duchess of York\", his wife suddenly died in Toxteth. This event is said to have changed Stuart's demeanour and plunged him into a depression. He never again took time off work and left his children to the sole care and maintenance of his four maiden sisters in England. In 1934 he took over his last and most important seagoing role as Commodore of the CPS fleet and was placed in command of the 42,000-ton liner RMS \"Empress of Britain\" on her transatlantic route.\n\nAfter three years in command of this giant ship on her England to Quebec route, Stuart was given a desk job managing the company's assets in Montreal. In 1937, he was promoted to company superintendent, a role followed by the job of general manager at Canadian Pacific's London office. He retained this job for 13 years, including through the difficult experiences of World War II when London's dockyards were badly damaged by the London Blitz. Two of his sons served in the war; one in the Royal Navy and the other in the Royal Canadian Navy. Both were decorated for bravery while fighting in the Battle of the Atlantic against the resurgent German submarine fleet. One was presented with the Distinguished Service Cross, while the other was Mentioned in Despatches.\n\nRetiring in 1951, Stuart retreated to his sisters' cottage in Charing, Kent, and spent his days reading, walking, observing nature and visiting the cinema, where he was reportedly notorious for \"jeering embarrassingly loudly at falsely heroic, sentimental or emotional passages\" and shouting \"Mush!\" at parts of movies he did not approve. He died aged 67 at the cottage on 8 February 1954 and was buried in local Charing Cemetery. For many years his gravestone was in a poor state of repair, but successful attempts have been made by memorial organisations to replace it with a standard white Commonwealth War Grave headstone. Following his death, 'Stuart Close' in Lee-on-Solent was named for him and his medals were collected and donated on permanent loan to the National Maritime Museum, where they are on display.\n\n\n"}

Many of his foreign assignments were to Latin American countries experiencing domestic strife. For example, Gillespie served as the interim Chargé d'Affaires during the 1983 United States Invasion of Grenada as well as in Colombia from 1985 until 1988, when the government sought to crack down on the Illegal drug trade in Colombia and the Colombian drug cartels.

{"id": "2254442", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2254442", "title": "Arthur Cravan", "text": "Arthur Cravan\n\nArthur Cravan (born Fabian Avenarius Lloyd on 22 May 1887, Lausanne, Switzerland – disappeared 1918) was a Swiss writer, poet, artist and boxer. He was the second son of Otho Holland Lloyd and Hélène Clara St. Clair. His brother Otho Lloyd was a painter and photographer married to the Russian émigré artist Olga Sacharoff. His father's sister, Constance Mary Lloyd, was married to Irish poet Oscar Wilde. He changed his name to Cravan in 1912 in honour of his fiancée Renée Bouchet, who was born in the small village of Cravans in the department of Charente-Maritime in western France.\n\nCravan was last seen at Salina Cruz, Mexico in 1918 and most likely drowned in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Mexico in November 1918.\n\nCravan was born and educated in Lausanne, Switzerland, then at an English military academy; he was expelled under mysterious circumstances, but some sources suggest that it was for spanking a teacher. After his schooling, during World War I, he travelled throughout Europe and America using a variety of passports and documents, most of them forged. He declared no single nationality and claimed instead to be \"a citizen of 20 countries\".\n\nCravan set out to promote himself as an eccentric poet and art critic, but his interest in art and literature was that of the provocateur which is typified by his claim in \"Maintenant\" (March – April 1914) that art is \"situated more in the guts than in the brain\" and that he wanted to \"break the face\" of the modern art movement. He staged public spectacles with himself at the centre, once acting on the front of a line of carts where he paraded his skills as a boxer and singer. His proclivity for shock was what endeared him to the New York Dadaist movement, who adopted him as a poster boy after his death despite the fact Cravan never self-identified with the movement.\n\nFrom 1911 to 1915, Cravan published and edited a critical literary magazine, \"Maintenant!\" (\"Now!\"), which appeared in five issues and which he notoriously distributed around Paris with a wheelbarrow. It was gathered together and reprinted by Eric Losfeld in 1971 as \"J'étais Cigare\" in the Dadaist collection \"Le Désordre\". The magazine was designed to cause sensation; in a piece about the 1914 arts salon, Cravan viciously criticised a self-portrait by Marie Laurencin. His remarks drove Laurencin's lover and influential modernist critic and poet Guillaume Apollinaire into a fury that resulted in a bid for a duel. It is not known whether the duel ever happened, though Apollinaire was depicted more than once with a sling on his arm around that time. Cravan's rough vibrant poetry and provocative, anarchistic lectures and public appearances (often degenerating into drunken brawls) earned him the admiration of Marcel Duchamp, Francis Picabia, André Breton, and other young artists and intellectuals.\n\nCarolyn Burke notes that Amelia von Ende, writing in \"The Dial\" in 1914, argued that Cravan \"had not only put the idea of \"pluralisme\" into poetic form but also invented the term 'machinisme', which very appropriately characterises the mechanical and industrial side of our life. [...] [von Ende] observed that Cravan's 'machinisme' had not found favour because it was less euphonious than 'dynamism', the critical term in vogue.\"\n\nAfter the First World War began, Cravan left Paris to avoid being drafted into military service. On a stopover in the Canary Islands a boxing match was arranged in Barcelona between Cravan and the former world champion Jack Johnson to raise money for Cravan's passage to the United States. Posters for the match touted Cravan as \"European champion\". Johnson, who didn't know who the man was, knocked Cravan out cold after six rounds. In his autobiography, \"My Life and Battles\", Johnson noted that Cravan must have been out of training.\n\nCravan's pride in being the nephew of Oscar Wilde produced hoax documents and poems which Cravan wrote and then signed \"Oscar Wilde\". In 1913 he published an article (\"Oscar Wilde is Alive!\") in \"Maintenant\" claiming that his uncle was still alive and had visited him in Paris. \"The New York Times\" published the rumour, even though Cravan and Wilde never met. In 1915 Cravan held an exhibition of his paintings at the gallery Bernheim Jeune in Paris under the pseudonym Èdouard Archinard.\n\nOn 13 January 1916 Cravan arrived in New York on the same ship as Leon Trotsky, Carolyn Burke notes, \"just a few weeks before the Kaiser announced the resumption of attacks on steamships\". On the journey Trotsky and Cravan actually became acquainted and, although Cravan reportedly liked Trotsky, he felt that \"It was useless telling him the result of his revolution would be the founding of a red army to protect the red liberty\". While Cravan's practices may have aligned with certain anarchist and socialist principles, he was staunchly unaffiliated, mocked all notions of progress and subscribed to no single ideology or movement.\n\nIn 1917, Cravan met the poet Mina Loy at a war benefit ball where the dress code was modern art movements. That night Cravan had to deliver an address on \"The Independent Artists of France and America\" but he was pranked by Picabia and Duchamp who got him so drunk that he ended up swaying and slurring his speech on the platform, shouting obscenities and removing his coat, vest, collar and suspenders. This led to his arrest by four private detectives at the event but, after being taken to the local police station, Cravan was soon bailed out by friend Walter Conrad Arensberg who took him back to his home at West Sixty-Seventh Street.\n\nLoy was to describe him, for the rest of her life, as the love of her life.\n\nCravan left New York for Mexico on 1 September with a friend called Frost. Around this time in his letters to Loy, who remained in New York, he wrote that \"I am only at my best when travelling\" and that \"[w]hen I have to stay too long in the same place, I become almost imbecilic.\" Together Cravan and Frost hitchhiked north through Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Maine to Canada. After many failed attempts to sail from Nova Scotia to Newfoundland due to the Canadian authorities refusing their lack of papers, Frost became ill and Cravan boarded a schooner bound for Mexico alone.\n\nBy December, Cravan had reached Mexico City and sent Loy a multitude of letters pleading with her to join him, insisting that his life depended upon it. In one such letter he begged for a lock of her hair and begged, \"Better yet, come with all of your hair.\" He finished this letter with: \"La vie est atroce.\" Soon after this Loy purchased a one-way ticket to Mexico City involving a 5-day train journey.\n\nLoy, in one of the extracts from her autobiography \"Colossus\" (the title taking after her name for Cravan), recalls their time in Mexico City:\"Our life together consisted entirely in wandering arm in arm through the streets. It never made any difference what we were doing – making love or respectfully eyeing canned foods in groceries, eating our tamales at street corners or walking among weeds. Somehow we had tapped the source of enchantment.\" Not too long after Loy's arrival the pair decided to get married and, as they were unable to afford a luxurious wedding in a Mexican chapel, the pair eventually got married on 25 January 1918 at the major's office with two passersby as witnesses.\n\nThe couple lived on very humble means and Cravan eventually got seriously ill with amoebic dysentery, fever, stomach issues. During this time there was increasing pressure for the couple to leave Mexico city as Cravan, being a draft-dodger, was being pursued by American secret police. After Loy nursed him back to health, the couple decided to leave Mexico City separately – Loy leaving first, in order to research escape routes to Argentina, and Cravan remaining in order to raise some money. In his desperation Cravan took up a fight against Jim Smith in which he was humiliatingly beaten.\n\nAfter reuniting it was clear that Loy was pregnant. With very little money, and Cravan's passport documents still not in order, it was agreed that Loy would travel on a passenger ship to protect her health and Cravan, as well as his friends Winchester, Cattell, and their Swedish friend (none of whom had the necessary papers) would sail to Chile. After purchasing and repairing an old, small, craft cheaply in Salina Cruz, Cravan sailed alone to Puerto Angel, a few days up the coast, with the intention of selling or trading it for a larger vessel which he would then return to Salina Cruz in so as to accommodate all his friends in their journey to Chile.\n\nCravan never arrived or returned and it is presumed that he capsized and drowned in a storm raging at sea in the following days.\n\nLoy gave birth to Fabienne Cravan Lloyd, named after her father, on 5 April 1919 in London.\n\nIn the Bob Brown novel \"You Gotta Live\" (1932) the character Rex takes after Cravan and Rita to Loy.\n\n\"Song Without Any End\", a track on Brian Ritchie's album \"I See a Noise\" (1990), features Arthur Cravan as its subject.\n\n\"Shadow-Box\" (1999), a novel by Irish author Antonia Logue, is a fictional version of the interweaving of the lives of Cravan, Mina Loy and Jack Johnson, the first black heavyweight champion of the world.\n\n\"Cravan vs. Cravan\" (2002), a documentary film by Catalan Spanish director Isaki Lacuesta, traces Cravan's history through re-enactments featuring French boxer and filmmaker Frank Nicotra.\n\n\"Cravan\" (2005), a biographical graphic novel on the life of Arthur Cravan, was written by Mike Richardson and illustrated by Rick Geary.

The name originates from the Czech (Bohemian), and originally Old Slavonic word \"kolo\" meaning \"circle\", \"wheel\". A klobásník, which contains sausage or other meat, is often thought to be a variation of the kolach (koláče); however, most Czechs hold the distinction that kolache are only filled with non-meat fillings. Unlike kolache, which came to the United States with Czech immigrants, klobásníky were first made by Czechs who settled in Texas.\n\nKolaches are often associated with Cedar Rapids and Pocahontas in Iowa where they were introduced by Czech immigrants in the 1870s. They are served at church suppers and on holidays but also as an everyday comfort food. Recipes are usually passed down with some including spices like mace or nutmeg. They can be filled with a combination of prune, apricot, cream cheese, poppy seed or assorted other fillings.\n\nSeveral cities, including Tabor, South Dakota;Verdigre, Nebraska; Wilber, Nebraska; Prague, Nebraska; Caldwell, Texas; East Bernard, Texas; Crosby, Texas; Hallettsville, Texas; Prague, Oklahoma; St. Ludmila's Catholic Church in Cedar Rapids, Iowa; and Kewaunee, Wisconsin hold annual Kolache Festival celebrations.\n\nMontgomery, Minnesota, is the \"Kolacky capital of the world\" and holds an annual festival known as Kolacky Days. Verdigre, Nebraska, stakes the same claim with their Kolach Days. Prague, Nebraska, claims to be known as the home of the world's largest kolache. Both Caldwell and West, Texas, claim the title of \"Kolache Capital\" of the state and kolaches, in general, are extremely popular in Central and Eastern Texas. There is even a Texas Czech Belt which grew in the 1880s and is full of kolache bakeries.\n\nHaugen, Wisconsin is the Kolache Capital of Wisconsin. The village is a Bohemian settlement that celebrates its Czech Heritage during an annual festival (Haugen Fun Days). Kolaches are a staple of the village's festival with Kolache sales, bake-offs, and tastings. Kolache may be found at Czech-American festivals in other communities in the United States.\n\nIt was the sweet chosen to represent the Czech Republic in the Café Europe initiative of the Austrian presidency of the European Union, on Europe Day 2007.\n\nMany people in the United States refer to the sausage filled Czech pastries as kolaches, but these are klobasniky which were invented by Texas families.\n\nA related dish is a klobasnek, which is popular in central and southeast Texas, specifically Houston. It often uses similar bread but is filled with a link of sausage or ground sausage. Some people also refer to these as kolache, but they are more closely related to a \"pig in a blanket\". They may also contain ham, cheese, jalapeño, eggs and bacon/sausage, potato, etc., and resemble a \"pig in a blanket\". Czech settlers created klobasniky after they immigrated to Texas.\n\n\n"}

Abroad, he has made appearances in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and Ring Ka King, among others. Figueroa has also been signed to WWE and held an administrative role in World Warriors Wrestling (WWW).\n\nFigueroa was originally a professional basketball player, and represented Puerto Rico in a game against the United States basketball team in Madison Square Garden in 1991. His career in basketball was cut short when he was forced to return home and begin working in order to support his wealthy family that spent money too excessively and begged him for money. Figueroa first became involved with professional wrestling by performing in the local independent circuit, performing as \"Peter el Stripper\". He subsequently migrated to Mexico, adopting the masked persona of \"Power Man\", wrestling along veteran luchador Silver Star.\n\nAfter deciding to become a professional wrestler, Figueroa trained under Hector Soto, Savio Vega, Miguel Pérez, Jr. and others and debuted in the Puerto Rican International Wrestling Association in 1999 as Nuevo Gran Apolo (\"New Great Apolo\"), facing Andy Anderson. He quickly ascended the ranks of the promotion, at first forming a tag team with Ricky Banderas known as the Nueva Generación (\"New Generation\"). They first won the IWA Tag Team Championships on May 7, 2000 in Moca, defeating the Starr Corporation. They held the titles twice more that year, but on August 6, a day after their third reign began, Banderas turned on Figueroa and named Miguelito Pérez as his new partner. In 2001 Figueroa and Pérez formed a tag team, and on February 24 they won the IWA Tag Team Championships, making Figueroa a four-time tag team champion. On March 23, however, Pérez no-showed a scheduled title defence, and Figueroa fell to the Starr Corporation in a de facto handicap match.\n\nHaving been betrayed by two tag team partners, Figueroa decided to focus on the richest prize in the IWA; the IWA Heavyweight Championship. His goal was swiftly realized; on June 16, 2001 in Bayamón Figueroa defeating reigning champion Ricky Banderas and Tiger Ali Singh in a Three Way match to become IWA World Champion. He lost the title to Pain on September 29, who in turn lost to Glamour Boy Shane. Figueroa began feuding with Shane over the title, winning the title for a second time on October 27. Shane was, however, unwilling to relinquish the title, and two months later the title was held-up after a TLC Match ended in controversial fashion. Figueroa immediately went after the vacant title, but lost a crowning match to Primo Carnero when IWA President Victor Quiñones threw in a towel on his behalf. Figueroa soon returned to the title pictures, however, and won the IWA Heavyweight Championship three more times in 2002, and one in 2003 and 2004 respectively. In April 2003 he was sidelined for eight months with a serious neck injury.\n\nFigueroa shortened his name to Gran Apolo, then simply Apolo. He later added the prefix \"El León\".\n\nFigueroa left the IWA in 2006, returning on September 23, 2007 at the \"Golpe de Estado\" event.\n\nFigueroa joined Total Nonstop Action Wrestling in July 2002 as Apolo. He made several appearances for the promotion, with his last match being a loss to Jeff Jarrett on August 7 in a match with Ricky Steamboat as the special guest referee.\n\nOn January 14, 2004, Figueroa returned to TNA under a mask as El León (\"The Lion\"), attacking Jarrett. The following week he faced Jarrett in a street fight that ended in a no-contest. Figueroa unmasked on March 31, and formed a tag team with D'Lo Brown. That same night, Figueroa and Brown defeated three other teams to become number one contenders to the vacant tag team championships. On April 14, 2004 Figueroa and Brown defeated Kid Kash and Dallas for the NWA World Tag Team Championships, winning by disqualification (in TNA, title can change hands on countouts or disqualifications) when Dallas brought a pipe into the ring. The following week, Kash and Dallas claimed their rematch. In the course of the match, Kash attempted to hit Figueroa with a pipe, but Figueroa was able to wrestle it from him and use it on Kash and Dallas. Referee Rudy Charles saw Figueroa with the weapon and disqualified him as a result, thereby returning the titles to Kash and Dallas. The two teams faced one another for a third time on April 28 in a Nightstick on a Pole Match to determine the undisputed NWA World Tag Team Champions, and Figueroa and Brown were defeated. Figueroa then left the promotion once more.\n\nFigueroa returned to TNA for a third run on March 4, 2005, with Director of Authority Dusty Rhodes welcoming him as part of his \"open door policy\". After defeating Sonny Siaki on the March 25 episode of \"TNA Impact!\", Figueroa earned the respect of his Samoan opponent, and the duo formed a tag-team. On June 19 at Slammiversary they were defeated by Simon Diamond and Trytan. The team was split when Siaki's contract expired in December 2005.\n\nOn the December 31 episode of \"Impact!\", Figueroa helped Konnan and the debuting Homicide to ambush Bob Armstrong. The trio were later identified as \"The Latin American Xchange\".\n\nAfter Figueroa no-showed TNA Final Resolution 2006, he was removed from TNA television. At TNA Against All Odds 2006 on February 12, 2006, he was replaced with Machete. He was released from the promotion that same month.\n\nFigueroa was a participant in a TNA event that took place on June 3, 2007 in San Juan, Puerto Rico. He was booked to wrestle in a tag team match with Jeff Jarrett against Scott Steiner and James Storm, Figueroa's team won the match.\n\nAfter entering into a backstage conflict with the IWA's management, Figueroa no-showed a scheduled appearance on June 24, 2006, going on to debut in the New Wrestling Stars (NWS), then a large independent promotion with a talent exchange and cooperation arrangement with WWC, the following night. His first appearance in the NWS was a spot where his characteristic music was played and he made the save by interfering in an assault on the face faction. He was recruited by Rico Casanova. However, since Figueroa was still under contract with the IWA until March 2007 and had taken the case to the courts of Puerto Rico seeking a release, WWC decided not to air this segment in their television program, \"Superestrellas de la Lucha Libre\". The NWS had been experiencing talent losses and economic difficulty prior to this angle, relying heavily on it to recover and its ownership was infurriated over the segment being skiped, which led to the end of the NWS-WWC agreement. Still unable to wrestle under his character while it was under legal litigation, Figueroa adopted a masked persona known as \"El Rey Romano\", though his actual identity was not denied or ignored. This was a strategy that the promotion had previously used with Shane Sewell, known as the masked \"Mr.GPR\", and initially used by the IWA when Ray González entered it as \"Rey Fénix\" while challenging his contract with WWC. Figueroa entered an angle against manager Ángel \"El Profe\" Pantojas, who brought in Rein Stein, whom he defeated by disqualification.\n\nWhile working in NWS, Figueroa made appearances in another independent promotion the Puerto Rico Wrestling Association, debuting on July 19, 2006, in a non-wrestling role. On September 3, 2006, he won a disqualification over Brutus \"El Carnicero\" when the heel stable interfered. At PRWA's Purgatorio event, he defeated a wrestler known as \"Tonka\". On September 13, 2006, Figueroa defeated \"Voodo Man\" by pinfall. The entrance of Figueroa to NWS had considerable impact due to the fact that he had remained exclusive to the IWA throughout his career, a distinction only shared by the other half of the Dream Team tag team, Ricky Banderas. However, the lack of a licensed promoter following the end of the company's relationship with WWC propelled it into immediate economic problems due to the cost of the roster's established figures. The NWS aired the last edition of its television program, \"A Puro Fuego\", on September 10, 2006, and in less than three months its personnel had been salvaged by IWA and WWC. After this, Figueroa continued performing in PRWA, wrestling Edgar \"Spectro\" Díaz at Levantando la Dignidad. Figueroa next focused on a new independent company founded in his native Ponce, the World Wrestling Revolutions, where he debuted on September 8, 2006, using the ringname \"El León Apolo\" (fusing his nickname and former ringname) in a tag team match. In his second appearance for the promotion, he won a tag team match. Figueroa was later involved in a visit that the WWR's CEO, Denys Negrón, made to meet with TNA personnel. By November, the promotion decided to change his ring name to \"Rey de Reyes\". Figueroa also made two appearances for independent promotion WOA, losing a singles match and being disqualified in a tag team match.\n\nAfter his contract with IWA expired Figueroa joined Carlos Colón's wrestling promotion the World Wrestling Council under his former IWA gimmick. He was first involved in an angle involving Bronco, in which he was accused of not fulfilling his obligations two years before when he has rumored to debut on WWC. Following this feud he was involved in several confrontations with Eddie Colón; this led to the two of them meeting in two number one contendership matches both of which were won by Apolo. On May 12, 2007 in WWC's annual event \"Summer Madness\", Apolo faced Alofa \"The Samoan tank\" in a match where Colón served as guest referee, Apolo applied his finishing move to Alofa gaining a pinfall victory in the process becoming the WWC Universal Heavyweight Champion. Figueroa would lose the title on May 19, 2007 in a twelve-man Royal Rumble where Eddie Colón would be booked to become the new champion.\n\nOn December 21, 2007, the company announced that Figueroa had signed a contract with World Wrestling Entertainment, in this announcement they informed that Figueroa would wrestle in Florida Championship Wrestling, one of the company's development territories before being promoted to one of the main rosters. On March 4, 2008, it was reported that Figueroa had been released from his contract.\n\nFigueroa returned to the International Wrestling Association after working several months in the World Wrestling Council and wrestled there during the final months of 2007.\n\nAfter being released from his contract Figueroa remained inactive for several months. On June 7, 2008, he returned to action in the Puerto Rico Wrestling Association, winning a three-way match. On November 16, 2008, Figueroa performed in a card presented by the IWA.\n\nSubsequently, Figueroa began competing for NWA On Fire, one of the independent promotions that form part of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). On December 27, 2008, Figueroa was booked to win the NWA On Fire Heavyweight Championship by defeating Danny Inferno. On May 2, 2009, Figueroa defeated Mike DiBiase II to win the NWA North American Heavyweight Championship, becoming a dual-champion within the NWA.\n\nAfter being released, Figueroa returned to wrestling at WWC's Aniversario 2012 event, where he defeated \"The Precious One\" Gilbert Cruz to win his second Universal Heavyweight Championship. While working for WWC, Figueroa was recruited by the World Wrestling League as a member of the interpromotional Team Puerto Rico, joining Banderas and Joe \"Hercules\" Gómez. On June 25, 2013, Figueroa defeated a masked luchador known as Apocalipsis to win the Maximum Heavyweight championship of the Peru-based Leader Wrestling Association. This was the main event of Campeones del Ring: Hacedores de Proezas 2013 and it marked the first instance that a foreign wrestler won the belt. He dropped the belt to Apocalipsis in the final event of this tour. On July 27, 2013, Figueroa teamed with Joe \"Hercules\" Gómez to defeat JT Dunn and Mike Graca for the NWW World Tag Team Championship. The team challenged for the WWL World Tag Team Championship on September 8, 2013, but failed to win due to outside intervention. On November 16, 2013, at Crossfire, he won the WWC Puerto Rico Heavyweight Championship.\n\nOn December 30, 2013, Figueroa filmed a promotional skit for a debuting independent promotion named Latin Wrestling Alliance appearing along his son, Alex Figueroa, in the later's debut appearance in professional wrestling. The company's first show took place on February 1, 2014, where he defeated his opponent after his son intervened on his behalf. On March 7, 2014, Figueroa returned to WWL winning a three-way match over Cien Caras Jr. and X-Fly. Two days later he wrestled Cien Caras, Jr. in a one-on-one rematch, winning by using the ropes for leverage.

In the press release it was reported that he had been training for a year. The fight was scheduled for January 25, 2020, as part of a card to be headlined by Amanda Serrano at the José Miguel Agrelot Coliseum.\n\nFigueroa is married to former professional wrestler Verónica Polera, also known under her ring name Havana.

Considered his magnum opus, it is the most celebrated hadith commentary. It is reported that it took Ibn Hajar 25 years to finish his work.\n\nAbd al-Hayy ibn Abd al-Kabir al-Kattani said: \n“When the author of \"al-Hittah\" quoted Ibn Khaldun as saying that the explanation of \"Sahih al-Bukhari\" is a debt upon the Muslim nation, he said, ‘This debt has been fulfilled by the explanation of al-Hafith Ibn Hajar.’ For that reason, when it was suggested to Muhammad ibn ‘Ali al-Shawkani, that he write an explanation of \"al-Jami’ al-Sahih\" by al-Bukhari just as others have, he responded, ‘There is no migration after \"al-Fath\",’ referring to \"Fath al-Bari\".\"\n\nAbd al-Hakim Murad said of \"Fath al-Bari\" in the introduction to the translation of Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani's commentary on selected hadith (published as a booklet by the Muslim Academic Trust): \"The importance of this literature may be gauged by the fact that at least seventy full commentaries have been written on Imam al-Bukhari’s great Sahih... the most celebrated [of which] is without question the magnificent \"Fath al-Bari\" (\"Victory of the Creator\") by Imam Ibn Hajar al-‘Asqalani, a work which was the crown both of its genre and of the Imam’s academic career. It is appreciated by the ulema for the doctrinal soundness of its author, for its complete coverage of Bukhari’s material, its mastery of the relevant Arabic sciences, the wisdom it shows in drawing lessons (fawa’id) from the hadiths it expounds, and its skill in resolving complex disputes over variant readings.\"\n\nIslamicist Norman Calder described Ibn Hajar's work as \"the most magnificent achievement of exegetical discourse\".\n\nEditions include one from the Egyptian Press of Mustafa Al-Babi Al-Halabi, 1959 (1378 A.H.).\n\n"}

It is one of two facilities operated by the Wayne County Airport Authority, the other being Detroit Metropolitan Airport, which replaced Willow Run as the major commercial airport for the region starting in 1958. Worldwide cargo airlines Kalitta Charters and National Airlines are based at Willow Run Airport.\n\nWillow Run Airport was named for a small stream that meandered through pastureland and woods until the late 1930s. Automobile pioneer Henry Ford bought the property that became the airport's runways and taxiways in 1931, and used it for almost a decade as farmland for a \"social engineering\" experiment that brought inner-city boys to Willow Run Farm to learn about nature, farming tasks, and the rural way of life. The residents at the Willow Run farms planted, tended, and harvested crops as well as running a maple syrup operation, and sold their products at the farm market on the property. In the process, the boys learned self-discipline and the values of hard work, and benefited from the fresh air that they had not been able to experience while growing up in congested cities.\n\n\"See the Willow Run article for further details of manufacturing at the site.\"\n\nThe coming of World War II to Europe and the Fall of France in 1940 alarmed many in the United States, and in spite of an official policy of American neutrality, a number of government officials began preparing for the possibility of United States involvement. Henry Ford, himself an isolationist, was prevailed upon in the spring of 1941 to accept a contract to build B-24 Liberator heavy bombers for the Army Air Forces, under license from the plane's designer Consolidated Aircraft. He chose as the site his Willow Run Farm and commenced building a massive industrial plant that became the Willow Run manufacturing complex. Architect Albert Kahn designed the main structure, which had of factory space, and an aircraft assembly line over long. It was thought to be the largest factory under one roof anywhere in the world.\n\nTo meet projected demand for the B-24, in early 1941 the Federal government established the Liberator Production Pool Program; Ford joined the program shortly thereafter. Although the Ford Trimotor had been a success in the 1920s, the company had since shied away from aviation, and initially, Ford was assigned to provide B-24 components with final assembly performed by Consolidated at its Fort Worth plant, or by fellow licensee Douglas Aircraft at its Tulsa, Oklahoma, plant. However, in October 1941 Ford received permission from Consolidated and the Army to assemble complete Liberators on its own at its new Willow Run facility. Even then it would take nearly a year before finished Liberators left the factory.\n\nThe Willow Run plant was gigantic. It covered and was almost a wide and long . The production line had a 90-degree turn at roughly its two-thirds mark; overhead views suggest this was to avoid encroaching on the airfield's taxiways, while others contend that Ford's construction managers sought to keep the plant and its equipment inside Washtenaw County, where property tax assessments were lower than neighboring Wayne County.\n\nThe first Ford-built Liberators rolled off the Willow Run line in September 1942; these were designated B-24E. Few if any of these saw combat, being used instead in training squadrons.\n\nThe Willow Run bomber plant had many problems at startup, due in part to the mindsets and technical skills of both management and labor, who were each accustomed to the requirements of auto production, finding it difficult at first to adapt to the higher precision required in aircraft production. The plant at Willow Run had labor problems, in particular high absentee rates and rapid employee turnover; the factory was nearly an hour's drive from Detroit, and the imposition of wartime gasoline and tire rationing had made the daily commute difficult. In one month Ford had hired 2900 workers but had lost 3100. Ford officials were as a rule anti-union, and Willow Run experienced one serious strike.\n\nWillow Run transitioned to production of the B-24H in June 1943; these were the first Willow Run Liberators to see combat in numbers. After another year, by which time the factory had begun producing the B-24J (from April 1944), the Army determined that Consolidated's San Diego plant and Willow Run could meet future requirements for Liberators. The Boeing B-29 Superfortress was taking over the long-range bombing mission in the Pacific theater and no new B-24 units were programmed for deployment in the Europe, the Mediterranean or in the CBI, the other theatres of the war.\n\nBy fall 1944 Willow Run had moved from the B-24L to the B-24M, the last Liberator to be built in significant numbers. Willow Run shut down production in May 1945, after the end of the war in Europe; 6,972 Liberators had been built at Ford, and 1,893 sets of knock-down parts were provided to Consolidated and Douglas for assembly, for a total of 8,685 aircraft.\n\nAt the request of the government, Ford began to decentralize operations and many parts were assembled at other Ford plants as well as by the company's sub-contractors, with the Willow Run plant concentrating on final aircraft assembly. Ford's production managers coordinated their activities with an Army Air Forces support unit, the 484th Base Headquarters and Base Squadron. The bugs were eventually worked out of the manufacturing processes, and by 1944, Ford was rolling a Liberator off the Willow Run production line every 63 minutes, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\nAfter their manufacture, the next step in the process was the delivery of the aircraft to the squadrons. This was done at Willow Run by 1st Concentration Command (1st CC). The 1st CC was responsible for completing the organization and equipment of tactical and combat bombardment squadrons prior to their deployment to the overseas combat theaters. It also provided a final inspection of the aircraft and make any appropriate final changes; i.e., install long-range fuel tanks, remove unnecessary equipment, and give it a final flight safety test.\n\nWhile the planes were being serviced and made ready for overseas movement, personnel for these planes were also being processed. Pilots, co-pilots, navigators and crew chiefs were assigned as a crew for each aircraft. Paperwork was handled, necessary specific B-24 life support equipment was issued and some technical training for supporting the aircraft accomplished.\n\nOnce production began, it became difficult to introduce changes dictated by field experience in the various overseas theaters onto the production line in a timely fashion. Consequently, newly constructed Liberators needed modifications for the specific geographic areas they were to be flown in combat. For this reason, a series of Air Technical Service Command modification centers were established for the incorporation of these required theater changes into new Liberators following their manufacture and assignments. There were seven known modification centers: Consolidated/Fort Worth; Oklahoma City Air Materiel Center at Tinker Field, Tucson Modification Center at Davis-Monthan Field; the Birmingham Depot in Alabama; the Northwest Airlines Depot in Minneapolis, Minnesota; the, Martin-Omaha manufacturing plant, and the Hawaiian Air Depot at Hickam Field.\n\nAlthough the airfield itself and the buildings to the east of the runways had been built on Henry Ford's personal property, it is unclear how the parcels across the county line that became the site of the bomber plant were assembled. In any event, Henry Ford (who, although technically retired from Ford Motor operations until Edsel's death from ungulant fever in 1943, still held a say in company affairs) had insisted on building the factory without government financing. Instead, the company built the factory, and sold it to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation's Defense Plant Corporation (RFC-DPC), which then leased it back to Ford for the duration of the war. The land which held the airfield was transferred from Henry Ford's control to that of the company in July 1944, and sold to the RFC-DPC shortly thereafter.\n\n\"See also Willow Run Transmission and Willow Run Assembly.\"\n\nBetween 1946 and 1947, passenger airlines serving Detroit moved from Detroit City Airport on the city's crowded east side, to Willow Run; shortly thereafter, Wayne County officials began expanding Detroit-Wayne Major Airport at Romulus, which was closer to Detroit than Willow Run.\n\nWillow Run's relative isolation encouraged new approaches to passenger transportation to and from airports; at Willow Run in 1946, Warren Avis founded Avis Airlines Rent a Car Systems, the first rental car operation at an airport.\n\nThe RFC sold the airport to the University of Michigan in 1947 for $1.00. The terms of the sale required that the university operate the airport as a research facility, and the Michigan Aeronautical Research Center (later renamed Willow Run Research Center) took over some of the airport's buildings that were not needed for commercial aviation operations. For a time, the university housed some of its students in the apartments previously used by plant workers. Many of the buildings at the airport were used by University of Michigan physicists and engineers in research for national defense, including early work in antiballistic missile defense and remote sensing, at a facility which would become the Environmental Research Institute of Michigan (ERIM) after separating from the university in 1972.\n\nAt about the same time it sold the airfield, the RFC leased (and later sold) the bomber plant to the Kaiser-Frazer automobile company; the factory eventually became owned by General Motors. The last GM operations at Willow Run ended in 2010, and that property is planned for redevelopment after 2013 by its owner the RACER Trust. Since April 2013, there is an effort underway by preservationists to save a small portion of the original bomber plant facility, adjacent to the airport, as a new home for nearby Yankee Air Museum. The campaign is called SaveTheBomberPlant.org and is centered on a website of the same name.\n\nAlmost all of Detroit's scheduled airline flights used Willow Run until 1958, when the coming of the Jet Age drove traffic to the Romulus airfield, which that year had been renamed Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport (the name it still bears). It offered carriers a new terminal designed for the new aircraft, a newly expanded runway layout, and approach controls that made it the first inland airport in the country certified for jet airliners.\n\nIn 1956 there were seven passenger airlines at Willow Run. The April 1957 Official Airline Guide shows 68 weekday departures on Capital, 45 on American, 23 on Eastern, 17 on Northwest Orient, 14 on United, 13 on North Central, 13 on TWA, 8 on Delta, 5 on Allegheny and 3 on Mohawk. American's only westward non-stops were to Chicago; United had a nonstop DC-7 to Los Angeles; come summer TWA would resume its weekly two-stop Constellation flight to Paris, via Gander in Newfoundland and Shannon in Ireland. Only BOAC and Pan Am flew out of Detroit-Wayne Major.\n\nAirline flights ended in 1966 when United, TWA, Eastern, North Central, Mohawk and Lake Central moved to Metro Airport. In 1968, upon hearing that Detroit Tigers fans had overwhelmed Metro Airport in order to greet the newly crowned World Champions, the jet carrying the team diverted to Willow Run instead.\n\nUSA Jet, a charter airline, has brought flights back to Willow-Run, on DC-9s and MD-82s.\n\nIn 1951, the United States Air Force exercised a right of return to Willow Run and established Willow Run Air Force Station to the east of the airport runway. Willow Run AFS closed in 1959.\n\nIn 1977, the University of Michigan sold the airport to Wayne County for $1.00. The county transferred its airport operations, encompassing both Willow Run and Detroit Metro, in 2004 to the Wayne County Airport Authority, which manages both airports to this day.\n\nAn all-cargo airline known as Kalitta Charters now uses Ypsilanti Willow Run Airport as its home base; Conrad \"Connie\" Kalitta is the owner, and lives locally.\n\nThe Yankee Air Museum opened on the airport grounds in 1981. A fire in October 2004 destroyed the museum's building and most of its artifacts. The static display aircraft, including a B-52 Stratofortress and other aircraft too large for display inside the hangar, were undamaged. In 2005 the museum moved to the other side of the airport, where they began to rebuild their displays and gather more World War II memorabilia. In 2013, reports emerged of negotiations between the museum and the RACER Trust that would see the museum into a section of the former bomber plant.\n\nThe Yankee Air Museum hosts semi-annual airshows over Willow Run, featuring the Blue Angels.\n\nBetween July and September 2009, what was Runway 9R/27L along the southern edge of the airfield was converted to Taxiway H. This allowed the redesign of the southwest end of Runway 5R to reduce the possibility of encroachment by taxiing aircraft.\n\nIn 2011, Michigan State University planted of canola and mustard seed on airport property to generate biofuels for aircraft use. The airport has available for future crop production.\n\nUntil 2015, the airport was home to the sole aircraft of Baltia Airlines, an airline that has been attempting to commence operations to St Petersburg since 1991. The aircraft was a Boeing 747-200 with registration N706BL (msn 21705).\n\nOn March 8, 2017, a plane carrying the Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team to the Big Ten Conference men's basketball Tournament abandoned takeoff and skidded off the runway in high winds. The plane suffered extensive damage and some of the players suffered minor injuries but no serious injuries or fatalities were reported; while the team arrived late and initially had to play in practice gear (their regular uniforms, like all other luggage, had to remain on the plane as part of the NTSB investigation). They would go on to win the tournament.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2254499", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2254499", "title": "WTOG", "text": "WTOG\n\nWTOG, virtual and UHF digital channel 44, is a CW owned-and-operated television station licensed to St. Petersburg, Florida, United States and also serving Tampa. The station is owned by the CBS Television Stations subsidiary of ViacomCBS. WTOG's studios are located on Northeast 105th Terrace in St. Petersburg, near the west end of the Gandy Bridge; its transmitter is located in Riverview, Florida.\n\nWTOG's signal is relayed through two translators: W23CN-D (channel 23) in Sebring and W26DP-D (channel 26) in Inverness. On cable, WTOG is available on Charter Spectrum and Verizon FiOS channel 4 throughout the Tampa Bay area, and on Comcast Xfinity channel 9 in Sarasota and Venice.\n\nWTOG first signed on the air on November 4, 1968, operating as an independent station. The station was founded by Saint Paul, Minnesota-based Hubbard Broadcasting, who also owned radio station WGTO (540 AM, now WFLF) in nearby Cypress Gardens; Hubbard originally wanted to name the station WGTO-TV, but the request was denied by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC); in those days, the FCC did not allow television and radio stations to share the same base callsign if they were licensed in different cities. This led to Hubbard using a slightly modified form of the callsign. \n\nThe station began with a limited test schedule airing two hours per day, but expanded to broadcasting eight hours per day on January 27, 1969, initially airing from 3 p.m. to 11 p.m. daily.\n\nInitially, WTOG ran a lineup of older movies, some low-budget syndicated programs, a few off-network westerns and sitcoms, and some cartoons. In the station's early days, its slogan was \"WTOG... As Far as the Eye Can See\", which was made famous by its mid-1970s station identification package. WTOG caught on with viewers immediately; so much so, in fact, that it forced competitor WSUN-TV (channel 38, frequency now occupied by WTTA) off the air in 1970. For the rest of the 1970s into the early 1980s, WTOG was the only independent station in the Tampa Bay area. During the 1970s, WTOG gradually expanded its programming hours: by 1972, the station signed on at 10:30 a.m. on weekdays and around 1 p.m. on weekends. By 1976, WTOG signed on the air daily by 7 a.m. Gradually, WTOG added better sitcoms, more cartoons, off-network dramas, and better movies. While the station was profitable all along, its programming improved significantly in the late 1970s.\n\nChannel 44 finally gained competition in 1981, when Family Group Broadcasting signed on WFTS-TV (channel 28) as a family-oriented independent station. However, WTOG remained the clear leader in the market for the next two decades. During the 1970s and 1980s, the station was carried on many cable providers in central and southwestern Florida. In the 1980s, WTOG also maintained a network of low-powered repeaters, located in Sebring, Inverness, Arcadia (in the Fort Myers market; that translator has since shut down), Ocala (part of the Orlando market; that translator, W29AB, has since become a translator for Orlando's WKMG-TV) and Okeechobee (part of the West Palm Beach market). It billed itself as \"Florida's Super Station\", which \"Covered Florida Like The Sun\".\n\nThere was also some consideration to put WTOG on cable in Tallahassee, but that never came to fruition. WTOG was one of the most profitable independent stations in the country. In fact, during the late 1970s, Ted Turner called the station to ask how WTOG made itself so profitable. \n\nOn October 6, 1986, WTOG became a charter affiliate of the fledgling Fox network. The station, however, was still effectively programmed as an independent during its time as a Fox affiliate as the network's programming only comprised two hours of its primetime lineup on Saturday and Sunday evenings early on (they would not expand their programming to seven days a week until 1993). However, over time, channel 44 became one of several Fox affiliates nationwide that were disappointed with the network's weak programming offerings, particularly on Saturday nights, which were bogging down WTOG's otherwise successful lineup. WTOG dropped its Fox affiliation in 1988, sending it to WFTS (which was acquired by the E. W. Scripps Company in 1986). Through the early 1990s, WTOG was still running mostly cartoons (both classic and recent), classic and recent sitcoms, drama series and older movies. As part of deal with United Television, WTOG was an affiliate of the Prime Time Entertainment Network syndication programming service from 1993 to 1995.\n\nWTOG was largely unaffected by the affiliation swaps of 1994, which saw longtime CBS affiliate WTVT (channel 13) switch to Fox (as a result of the network's affiliation deal with then-owners, New World Communications); WFTS becoming an ABC affiliate; and longtime ABC outlet WTSP (channel 10) assuming the market's CBS affiliation. However, channel 44 did regain a network relationship when it became a charter affiliate of the United Paramount Network (UPN) at its launch on January 16, 1995. As with its days as a Fox affiliate, WTOG continued to program itself as an independent, programming a traditional general entertainment format during the day, with UPN programming being shown during the primetime hours.\n\nParamount Stations Group, a subsidiary of Viacom (which jointly owned the All News Channel cable network with Hubbard) purchased the station in the spring of 1996; at the time, Paramount Stations Group was in the process of selling stations it owned that were not UPN owned-and-operated stations, and traded NBC affiliates WNYT in Albany, New York and WHEC-TV in Rochester, New York to Hubbard. The purchase by Viacom made WTOG a UPN owned-and-operated station, becoming the first network-owned station in the Tampa Bay market. Soon after taking control, Paramount changed WTOG's on-air branding to \"UPN44\", which remained in use for the remainder of the network's run. By the late 1990s, older sitcoms (such as \"All in the Family\") and older cartoons made way for talk shows, court shows and reality programs (such as \"People's Court\" and \"Judge Mills Lane\") during the daytime. Recent cartoons (such as \"Pokémon\", \"Sailor Moon\", \"Garfield and Friends\" and \"Disney's Hercules\") and recent sitcoms (such as \"Charles in Charge\", \"Step by Step\", \"Family Matters\", \"Sister, Sister\", \"Roseanne\", \"The Simpsons\", \"Seinfeld\" (now on WTTA) and \"Friends\") continued to air but movies also were eliminated almost completely. Viacom purchased CBS in 2000 and merged that network's owned-and-operated stations into Paramount Stations Group.\n\nFor one day in May 1999, WTOG housed the operations for WFLA-TV (channel 8), after a power outage occurred at that station's main studios in Downtown Tampa.\n\nOn January 24, 2006, CBS Corporation (which split from Viacom, one month earlier) and the Warner Bros. Entertainment unit of Time Warner announced that the two companies would shut down The WB and UPN and combine the networks' respective programming to create a new \"fifth\" network called The CW. The CW signed a 10-year affiliation agreement with 11 of CBS' UPN stations, including WTOG; channel 44 became a CW owned-and-operated station when the network launched on September 18, 2006. Under current ownership, WTOG is one of two network-owned stations in the Tampa Bay market, alongside Fox-owned WTVT. Gradually, cartoons would disappear from WTOG's schedule, as with every broadcast station in the early 2000s. More reality and court shows would begin airing in place of that programming, while sitcoms continue to run during the evening hours.\n\nFor years, WTOG had handled master control operations for its sister station, KEYE-TV in Austin, Texas. However, in November 2006, WTOG's master control facilities, along with that of Atlanta's WUPA, were moved to sister CW affiliate WGNT in Norfolk, Virginia; 20 WTOG employees were laid off, even though CBS had previously denied that such terminations would happen. KEYE was later sold to Cerberus Capital Management, through its Four Points Media Group (which in turn was sold to the Sinclair Broadcast Group, then-owner of MyNetworkTV affiliate WTTA). WGNT was sold to Local TV, the owner of that market's CBS affiliate WTKR, in August 2010 (Local TV was merged with Tribune Broadcasting three years later, in August 2013; both WGNT and WTKR are now sister stations of WFTS under Scripps ownership). When CBS wound down operations at the Norfolk hub, WTOG and WUPA began handling their own master control operations once again.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nWTOG shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 44, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 59, which was among the high band UHF channels (52–69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition, to its analog-era frequency, UHF channel 44.\n\nSyndicated programming seen on WTOG includes \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\", \"Hot Bench\", \"2 Broke Girls\", and \"Mike & Molly\", among others. WTOG formerly produced a Saturday afternoon horror movie showcase, \"Creature Feature\", which ran on the station from 1971 to 1995.\n\nFrom its sign-on through 1976, WTOG carried Atlanta Braves baseball games through a syndication package that aired regionally on stations across the Southern United States before the cable/satellite launch of Superstation TBS the same year effectively ended the Braves regional network. From 1977 until 1989, it aired a variety of Major League Baseball games from various team networks on a daily basis (with the exception of Saturdays, Mondays and Wednesdays). These included games from the Boston Red Sox, Chicago White Sox, Cincinnati Reds, Detroit Tigers, Houston Astros, Kansas City Royals, Minnesota Twins, New York Yankees, Philadelphia Phillies, Pittsburgh Pirates, St. Louis Cardinals and the Toronto Blue Jays, as those teams were mainly in the Grapefruit League for spring training in the Tampa Bay, Orlando, Fort Myers and Sarasota areas. WTOG discontinued the baseball broadcasts when ESPN became the cable partner for Major League Baseball in 1990.\n\nWTOG aired numerous Tampa Bay Rowdies professional NASL soccer road games in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Additionally, many home and away indoor matches were shown.\n\nThe station also aired NHL games televised by NBC that were preempted by WFLA-TV in the 1970s. It later aired games from the NHL Network syndication package in the late 1970s and early 1980s. From 1992 until 2003, the station was the flagship of the Tampa Bay Lightning television network; the Lightning has been cable-exclusive since the 2003–04 season.\n\nFrom its sign-on through 1982, WTOG ran daily news capsules, mainly at sign-on and sign-off, with an announcer reading the day's headlines over a slide. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the station featured an on-camera newsreader providing a news summary during its morning discussion program, \"Florida Daybreak\". WTOG started using the \"Eyewitness News\" brand in the late 1970s, though its news was still a rather staid, low-key affair.\n\nIn 1982, Hubbard Broadcasting established a full-fledged news department for WTOG, and debuted a nightly 10 p.m. newscast. At first, WTOG continued to use the \"Eyewitness News\" name, with Barbara Callahan (former co-host of WTOG's edition of \"PM Magazine\") and John Nicholson (formerly an anchor at WTVT) as co-anchors. During the mid-1980s, the station's newscast was renamed \"Tampa Bay Tonight\", subsequently changing in 1988 to \"44 News at Ten\" and then \"WTOG 44 News at Ten\" in 1992. Between 1985 and 1995, John Summer served as primary anchor with various co-anchors, including Callahan. In 1996, following Viacom's acquisition of WTOG, the 10 p.m. broadcast was retitled as the \"UPN44 10 O'Clock News\", co-anchored by Callahan and Patrick Emory. WTOG also had a 11 a.m. newscast from 1995 to 1996.\n\nWTOG's news department was shut down in 1998, as a result of cost-cutting measures mandated by then-parent company Viacom and competition from Fox station WTVT's own 10 p.m. newscast. From that point until 2020, WTOG did not air any newscasts, which made it one of seven CBS-owned stations that did not air any local news programming (the other six were KSTW in Seattle and WUPA in Atlanta—both of which last aired outsourced newscasts in 2005, KTXA in Dallas–Fort Worth and WBFS-TV in Miami—both of which canceled newscasts produced by a sister station in 2011, though KTXA retains a sports show, and the Detroit duopoly of WWJ-TV and WKBD-TV—which canceled their morning newscast in 2012, although, WWJ-TV still airs weather updates; WUPA and WKBD has since begun airing newscasts produced by sister stations in other markets). WTOG had aired the syndicated morning show \"The Daily Buzz\" from 2004 until its sudden cancellation in 2015. It replaced its former time slot with paid programming and children's shows.\n\nOn January 17, 2020, CBS Television Stations announced that they will be introducing nightly 10 p.m. newscasts for WTOG, which debuted on March 9; the newscast for WTOG is produced by CBS' Miami sister station WFOR-TV. It also marked WTOG's return to airing local news programming since its own in-house news department shut down 22 years earlier.\n\n\n"}

Its primary focus is on pharmaceuticals, electronics, housewares and cosmetics, with a limited selection of grocery items. As of September 2019, the chain had 82 stores in the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba.\n\nLondon Drugs was founded in 1945 as a small drugstore in Vancouver, British Columbia by Sam Bass. The first location at 800 Main Street, Vancouver, was named after London, England, the home of Canada's King, George VI.\n\nIn 1968, London Drugs was sold to Daylin Corporation. The next year, Daylin ran into financial difficulties in the US branch of its business, and decided to put London Drugs up for sale. In 1976, the business was acquired by the H.Y. Louie Group under the direction of President Tong Louie.\n\nTong Louie expanded the company within BC and, for the first time, beyond the provincial border into Alberta with the first Edmonton location in 1976. In the next ten years, London Drugs tripled its number of stores.\n\nDuring this growth, the company also began increasing the types of products available in stores. Small kitchen appliances, high end cosmetics and high quality photo equipment quickly became staple items lining the shelves.\n\nIn 1981, London Drugs expanded into another non-traditional drugstore category by installing its first One-Hour Photofinishing labs. The introduction of photofinishing labs into the store and the one-hour-photo revolution paved the way for London Drugs’ introduction of a computer department in 1983. \n\nIn 2004, the St. Vital Shopping Centre in Winnipeg became the new home to London Drugs’ first (and still only) Manitoba store.\n\nToday, London Drugs has stores in more than 35 major markets throughout British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. According to their website, as of September 2019, they operate 82 stores. In addition to pharmacy, other major goods offered include cosmetics, small appliances, electronics, cameras and photo finishing, toys and food. London Drugs serves more than 45 million customers each year.\n\nIn January 2019, London Drugs acquired the Edmonton-based photography chain, McBain Camera.\n\nLondon Drugs markets its own brand of products and services under the following labels:\n\nOf the chain's 82 stores, 53 are located in British Columbia, many of them in Greater Vancouver.

{"id": "2254513", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2254513", "title": "Viola Concerto (Walton)", "text": "Viola Concerto (Walton)\n\nThe Viola Concerto by William Walton was written in 1929 for the violist Lionel Tertis at the suggestion of the conductor Sir Thomas Beecham. The concerto carries the dedication \"To Christabel\" (Christabel McLaren, Lady Aberconway). But Tertis rejected the manuscript, and composer and violist Paul Hindemith gave the first performance. The work was greeted with enthusiasm. It brought Walton to the forefront of British classical music. In \"The Manchester Guardian\", Eric Blom wrote, \"This young composer is a born genius\" and said that it was tempting to call the concerto the best thing in recent music of any nationality. Tertis soon changed his mind and took the work up.\n\nWalton and Hindemith's collaboration on the concerto engendered a close friendship that lasted until the latter's death in 1963. A performance by Tertis at a Three Choirs Festival concert in Worcester in 1932 was the only occasion on which Walton met Edward Elgar, whom he greatly admired. Elgar, however, did not share the general enthusiasm for Walton's concerto.\n\nSuperficially, the work follows the standard three-movement format for a concerto. However, the tempo marks hint at some important differences:\n\n\nOrdinarily, the first and third movements of a concerto are in fast tempi, while the second movement is slow. Here, the first movement is on the slow side, and the second movement is unequivocally fast. In terms of character, the second movement is scherzo-like. Few concerti include a scherzo, but Walton's Viola Concerto seems to have been modeled on Prokofiev's First Violin Concerto, which Walton admired. Prokofiev's concerto also has a scherzo for its second movement as well as a relatively slow-moving first movement.\n\nWalton composed his Viola Concerto at the suggestion of conductor Sir Thomas Beecham for violist Lionel Tertis. Tertis had served as principal violist in Beecham's orchestra. Beecham, however, had not heard any of Walton's music. Walton wrote in December 1928 that he was \"working hard\" on the piece and in February 1929 that he had finished the second movement. He wrote that he considered the concerto potentially his finest work to date; whether this assessment would hold true, he added, depended on how the third movement turned out. He completed the work by the middle of 1929.\n\nWhen Tertis received the manuscript for the concerto, he rejected the work as too modernistic for his taste. As he later wrote in this autobiography,\n\nThe composer was so disappointed by Tertis' refusal that he considered recasting the concerto for violin and orchestra. Conductor and BBC programme planner Edward Clark suggested German composer and violist Paul Hindemith as a substitute for Tertis. (Tertis also claimed to have suggested Hindemith when he declined the premiere, but Walton confirmed it was Clark's idea.) Trained in the German school of string playing, Hindemith did not possess an immaculate technique. However, he played with strong character, a full tone and great emotion. The composer later wrote that Hindemith's \"technique was marvelous, but he was rough—no nonsense about it. He just stood up and played.\"\n\nWalton was initially somewhat reluctant to invite Hindemith, as he felt he had modelled the concerto too closely after the latter's style, which he would quickly recognise; but thanks to Edward Clark, the invitation was sent and accepted, the premiere was successful. This was the only time Hindemith performed Walton's work. When he returned to Great Britain in 1930, he performed his own viola concerto. The premiere was given on 3 October 1929 with the composer conducting. The occasion was a Prom Concert at the Queen's Hall, with the Henry Wood Symphony Orchestra, a scratch orchestra consisting mainly of women. Tertis, who attended the premiere, realized that he had made a mistake in rejecting the concerto and soon took up the work.\n\nThe first recording was made on 6 December 1937 by Frederick Riddle, with the composer conducting. Riddle was recommended for this recording by Tertis. He also made some revisions to the concerto, with Walton's approval. Although Walton conducted the work many times with leading soloists such as Tertis and William Primrose, the interpretation he liked above all others was that of Frederick Riddle; he asked Riddle to submit his edited manuscript to Oxford University Press, and this became the officially published version between 1938 and 1961.\n\nWilliam Primrose first played the concerto on 27 February 1936, in a concert under Sir Thomas Beecham. For this, Primrose rewrote some passages in all three movements, apparently with Walton's approval; he always played this version in concert and in both of his recordings. Walton published a revised version in 1964, but it contained none of Primrose's changes. Walton later confirmed he preferred his original conception rather than the one with Primrose's emendations.\n\nNumerous other recordings have been made of the piece, by such violists as Yuri Bashmet, Nobuko Imai, Paul Neubauer and William Primrose. Many soloists better known for their violin playing have also recorded the concerto, including Nigel Kennedy, Maxim Vengerov, and Yehudi Menuhin.\n\nThe orchestration of the concerto was revised in 1961 by Walton, with the premiere of the revised version being performed by John Coulling accompanied by the London Philharmonic Orchestra under Sir Malcolm Sargent on 18 January 1962.\n\nThe revised orchestration features 2 flutes (second doubling piccolo), oboe, cor anglais, 2 clarinets (second doubling bass clarinet), 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, timpani, harp and strings, compared to the original of 2 flutes, piccolo, 2 oboes, cor anglais, 2 clarinets, bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani and strings.\n\nWalton did not withdraw the earlier version, but did express a preference for the revised orchestration. Consequently, it is this version that is typically performed. However, the original version has been recorded by Lawrence Power.\n\nWalton's work with Hindemith in preparing the Viola Concerto for its premiere began a close friendship between the two men that lasted until Hindemith's death in 1963. Just before Hindemith's death, Walton composed a set of variations on a theme from Hindemith's Cello Concerto. This work also included references to Hindemith's opera \"Mathis der Maler\". Both the music and the recognition from which it had been inspired greatly pleased Hindemith.\n\n\n"}

From December 2019 to January 2020 he served as the Minister of the Elderly and Public Health. He also serves as the party’s second deputy leader since 2019, a post he previously held from 1999 to 2001. \n\nSøviknes was the first politician of his party to become mayor of a Norwegian municipality, namely Os, Hordaland in 1999, and one of the longest-serving, retaining the position for five consecutive elections until his 2016 government appointment.\n\nSøviknes was born in Os, Norway to metalworker and fisherman Eirik Søviknes (born 1939) and store clerk Gunn Drange (born 1942). He grew up on Søvikneset in Lysefjorden. He attended Os Senior high school from 1985 to 1988. He earned a degree in marine engineering from Bergen College of Engineering in 1992, and later studied at the Norwegian School of Economics.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2001, Søviknes was the vice chairman of the Progress Party together with Siv Jensen, and was considered as a possible successor to Carl I. Hagen as chairman of the party. He however became controversial after an incident at a party congress in 2001 where he had sexually abused a 16-year-old intoxicated member of the Youth of the Progress Party. Søviknes retained his position as mayor of Os (since 1999) and did not lose his local support after the incident.\n\nAfter first being elected mayor following the 1999 local elections, his local party's support subsequently surged from 36.6 to 45.7% (the highest share of votes for the party in a municipality for the election) in the 2003 local elections. The success was repeated in the 2007 local elections when he was reelected by a landslide. The candidate from the Conservative Party who came in second, jokingly commented that \"You don't challenge Terje Søviknes in Os.\" \nHe was yet again reelected in the 2011 local elections, this time however by a far lesser margin. This led to speculation that he could be ousted from power by a coalition of the other parties. Søviknes remained in power with the support of the Conservative party.\n\nOs has since by himself and the media been seen as a showcase municipality for the Progress Party. This is as he in his first term as mayor achieved full kindergarten coverage, full nursing home coverage and started a program of well-being and health journeys to Spain and related locations. It was also established a \"full\" stop of immigration and a local Vinmonopol store. Successful in being consecutively elected as mayor from 2003 to 2007, in this term the main issues was development of the city centre, better drug addiction recovery programs, development of schools and construction of a waterpark. While the municipality was struggling with large deficits before Søviknes became mayor, this has since been turned into a significant surplus as of 2004. His successful career as mayor of Os has gained him the nickname the \"Wizard of Os\" by the media.\n\nOn 20 December 2016 Søviknes was appointed Minister of Petroleum and Energy in the Solberg Cabinet, succeeding fellow party member Tord Lien.\n\nSøviknes married his first wife, Janniche Askeland in 1998 and they have two children together. In October 2011 they announced that they were separating. Søviknes is an avid bridge enthusiast and former president of the Os Bridge Club.\n\n"}

A violent sociopath, he brutalizes and murders people, even his own henchmen, without remorse, and is incapable of feeling love or taking pleasure in life.\n\nBrown is depicted as severely neurotic. He regards everyone he meets with hatred and contempt, and yet envies them for feeling emotions he cannot experience. He abhors sex; as a child, he spied on his parents making love, and was both aroused and disgusted by it. He is obsessed with the concept of sin, his idea of which is shaped by his Roman Catholic upbringing, and believes himself to be pure evil. He has no friends, and dismisses women as weak and inferior. He is not without normal desires, however—he wonders what it would feel like to love someone, and his phobia of sex does not prevent him from being as preoccupied with losing his virginity as any other teenage boy.\n\nAlthough clearly named by the other characters, within the narrative Pinkie is never referred to as such; he is only ever called \"the Boy\".\n\nIn the beginning of the novel, Brown kills Charles \"Fred\" Hale, a chronic gambler who helped the mob dispatch his predecessor, Kite. Soon afterward, he kills one of his henchmen, Spicer, when his alcoholism becomes a liability. He dodges the police, but makes an enemy in Ida Arnold, a friend of Hale's.\n\nAt about the same time, he meets Rose, a 16-year-old waitress at Snow's Cafe who saw him with Hale. He takes her out to intimidate her into keeping quiet, and develops a love-hate relationship with her: he is infatuated with her, even as he resents her dependence on him and looks down on her as his inferior. He eventually conducts a civil marriage with her to make sure she doesn't go to the police. The only common ground they have is their religion; they are both Roman Catholics, and therefore feel superior to the irreligious Arnold. While Arnold talks of \"right\" and \"wrong\", Pinkie and Rose discuss \"good\" and \"evil\", which they both feel is much more significant. Arnold appeals to Rose to end the marriage, but Rose refuses, even though she knows deep down that her husband is a monster. Rose believes the abuse she suffers at Brown's hands is divine retribution for \"living in sin\", and fantasises about going to Hell with him.\n\nBy the novel's conclusion, Brown decides to get rid of Rose. He tells her it is only a matter of time before he is arrested, and entreats her to commit suicide with him in the nearby moors; he plans to dispose of her body after she kills herself. Arnold arrives with a police officer just in time to save Rose, however. Brown attacks Arnold with a vial of vitriol, which he accidentally splashes in his own face. As he reels from the pain, he loses his footing and falls to his death from a cliff side.\n\nBrown was portrayed by Richard Attenborough in John Boulting's 1947 adaptation of \"Brighton Rock\" and by Sam Riley in Rowan Joffé's 2010 adaptation.\n\n"}

It is the administrative headquarters of Dholpur District and was formerly seat of the Dholpur princely state. Dholpur State or Dhaulpur State was a kingdom of India, which was founded in AD 1806 by a Hindu Jat Maharana Kirat Singh of Dhaulpur.\n\nDhaulpur became a separate district in 1982 comprising Dholpur, Rajakhera, Saramathura, Bari and Baseri Tehsils. Dholpur district is a part of Bharatpur Division/Commissionerate. It is bordered by Bharatpur district of Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh to the north, Madhya Pradesh to the south, Karauli district to the west and Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh to the east.\n\nThe geographical coordinates of Dholpur (Dhaulpur) which is at the boarder of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh are 26° 42' 0\" North, 77° 54' 0\" East. Total area of Dholpur district is 3,034 sq. km\n\nDholpur or Dhawalpuri was established in 500 AD by Dholya nagas and most likely the name of city was changed to Dholpur after him. Its ancient name was Dhavalapuri (धवलपुरी). Probably Dholpur was founded by one of the ancestors of Tejaji named Dhawalpāl (धवलपाल) in about middle of 7th century. It was one of the princely states in India located in the present-day state of Rajasthan ruled by Bamraulia Rana Jats.\n\nAfter the battle of Panipat, Babar became the first Mughal ruler of Hindustan. His rule was not a bed of roses in the early years of his reign. \nDhaulpur was taken by Sikandar Lodhi in 1501, who handed it to a Muslim governor in 1504. After the death of Ibrahim Lodi, many states declared themselves independent. Talai Khan became the ruler of Gwalior. Similarly, Mohammed Jaifoon declared himself the ruler of Dholpur.\n\nIn 1527, Dhaulpur fort fell to Babur and continued to be ruled by the Mughals until 1707. After the death of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, Raja Kalyan Singh Bhadauria obtained possession of Dhaulpur, and his family retained it until 1761. After that, Dholpur was taken successively by the Jat ruler Maharaja Suraj Mal of Bharatpur; by Mirza Najaf Khan in 1775; by the Scindia ruler of Gwalior in 1782; and finally, by the British East India Company in 1803. It was restored by the British to the Scindias under the Treaty of Sarji Anjangaon, briefly, and was soon reoccupied by the British. In 1805, Dhaulpur came under the Jat ruler, Maharana Kirat Singh of Gohad, a princely state, a vassal of the British during the Raj.\n\nAccording to the Babur Nama, Babur had a baori built in Dholpur on his last trip to Gwalior, to add to the \"charghar\" (\"four-gardens\") he had already had built there.\n\nAfter Mughals Rana vansh of Jats become ruler of Dhaulpur, during British Raj, it was part of the Rajputana Agency, till the Independence of India. The former mansion of the ruler of the erstwhile Dholpur State, Kesarbagh palace, now houses the Dholpur Military School, while its official residence in New Delhi, Dholpur House, is used by the Union Public Service Commission.\n\nTo liberate the country, many people sacrificed their lives. The important event in the history of Dholpur was on 11 April 1947 when the workers of the society gathered at Tasimo village gathering place. Then there was a ban on hoisting the flag, but the neem tree had a tricolor wave and the meeting was going on. At the same time, the Samajwadi police station Shamsher Singh, the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Gurudatt Singh, and the Thanedar Aliazam reached the meeting with the police at the meeting and when they came forward to bring the flag of the Tricolor, Thakur Chhattar Singh, who was present in the assembly, stood in front of the soldiers and Tricolor said in the condition of not releasing the flag. In that very same, the police shot Thakur Chhattar Singh. Then Pancham Singh Kushwaha came forward and the police shot him too. As soon as the two martyrs fell on the ground, the people present in the gathering surrounded the neem tree that had become a tricolor and said that the shoot shot is ready for us to die for Bharat Maata. And the shouting of the name of Bharat Maata, the police retreated, seeing the situation deteriorating. Due to this martyrdom of freedom fighters, Tasimo village was recorded not only in Rajasthan but in the entire history of India, which is known in history as 'Tasimo Goli Kand'. Pandit Roshanlal, 83, who witnessed the incident, points out that the marks of bullets run by the police at the behest of the monarchy have not even blurred on their hands. The same witness, 86-year-old Jamunadas Mittal, said that for the shame of the Tricolor, two of his sons They are curious on martyrdom.\n\n 2011 census, Dhaulpur municipality had a population of 126,142 and the urban agglomeration had a population of 133,229. The municipality had a sex ratio of 862 females per 1,000 males and 13.6% of the population were under six years old. Effective literacy was 76.56%; male literacy was 84.22% and female literacy was 67.74%.\nThe notable Dholpur Military School is housed in Kesarbagh Palace, a magnificent mansion of the former ruler of the erstwhile Dholpur State. It is 10.5 kilometres away from Dholpur City and on Dholpur-Bari Road.\n\nGovt PG College is located two kilometers away from the city towards railway station.

Mackey was a corrupt and brutal detective in the Los Angeles Police Department; he stole from drug dealers, routinely beat suspects and committed murder on at least three occasions. While two of the victims were violent gangsters, one was a fellow cop who was secretly working to expose Vic and his unit. Mackey saw his tactics as a means to an end. He is a devoted father and also saw himself as a family man.\n\nLittle is known about Mackey's early life, although his surname is probably of Irish origin (he occasionally wears a shamrock T-shirt). He also once mentioned that his father was a bricklayer (however, this may have been a joke). In season 5, he told Lt. Jon Kavanaugh that he had been a police officer for at least 14 years. In one of the DVD commentaries for season 4, Michael Chiklis mentions that the main characters on the show are from the same areas as the actors who play them, which would imply that Mackey is a native of the Boston, Massachusetts area. In support of this theory, during the season 1 episode \"Cherrypoppers\", Vic approaches a suspect outside of an underage sex show and, as a ruse, asks if the man remembers him from Boston.\n\nVic Mackey's morality is a classic example of selfish consequentialism. Mackey feels that his actions are justified if they produce the best consequences for himself and those close to him. While he had a solid status as a family man, he committed adultery with several women, including his fellow officer Danielle \"Danny\" Sofer. Mackey's personality is often viewed as narcissistic or machiavellian (in fact his surname, Mackey, sounds like the beginning syllables of \"Machiavelli\", which may or may not be coincidence), believing that the ends justify the means. However, this ultimately led to his downfall, which he narrowly avoided until the very end of the series.\n\nHis brutality is usually directed toward criminals whom he considered deserving of their harsh treatment at his hands, (e.g., rapists, drug dealers, pedophiles and mass murderers). Even when he has broken these laws himself, he has often justified it to himself by doing so in order to solve what he regards as more serious crimes. For example, in the first-season finale, Vic cornered a teenaged murder witness and demanded to know who murdered two police officers. Instead, the teenager refused to violate the neighborhood code of silence. Enraged, Vic pulled out a bag of crack cocaine and snarled, \"Fine! You're not a witness, then you're an arrest! And this is just about enough to make you a trafficker!\" Horrified, the teenager said, 'You can't do that, man!\" Vic grinned sadistically and said, \"What, arrest drug dealers? You just made my quota for the week!\" The teenager immediately revealed what he knew about the cop killing he had witnessed, provided that Vic removed the drugs from his pocket.\n\nDetective Shane Vendrell was Vic's best friend since before the formation of The Barn and the creation of the Strike Team. The second series prequel 'Co-Pilot' shows them working together as partners on a murder investigation. The strength of their friendship was evident in how they went to great lengths to save each other from trouble and how Vic kept Shane in the loop while leaving Lem and Ronnie out of some of his darker schemes. However, their relationship eventually became strained when Shane entered into a serious relationship with Mara, who was very demanding of his time.\n\nThe Strike Team robbed the Armenian Mob of millions of dollars, only to have it burnt by Lem, who feared that the money would tear them apart and cost them their freedom. Then, Vic and Shane's issues came to a head with Shane accusing Vic of taking other people's side against him when they are supposed to be best friends, and Vic calling Mara a bitch who has got Shane so twisted that he cannot think straight anymore. The two fell out, and the strike team was disbanded.\n\nShane and Vic reconciled after Shane got involved with the drug lord and gang leader Antwon Mitchell, who killed a young girl using Shane's gun. He offered to hand her body over to Shane in return for the body of Vic Mackey. Shane contacted Vic to meet him alone. After convincing Vic of his innocence, the two men worked together, along with Ronnie and Lem, to save Shane's career and put Antwon behind bars. Once this was done, the Strike Team was reunited and became close friends again.\n\nWhen Jon Kavanaugh launched an investigation into the Strike Team after arresting Lem for stealing drugs, Vic went to great lengths to try to save him, even trying to strike up a deal with Antwon to get Lem protection in prison. When the deal went sour, Lem was forced to go into hiding. Vic, Shane and Ronnie planned to escort Lem to a ranch in the mountains of Mexico where he would be safe from the law and any enemies who may want to kill him but the plan went awry when Aceveda told Vic that Lem was talking about the Armenian Money Train robbery. Vic confided in Shane that Lem may also talk about the murder of detective Terry Crowley.\n\nShane and Lem met, and when Lem refused to go into hiding in Mexico, Shane blew him up with a grenade. When Vic learned the truth, he confronted Shane, and he told Shane that if he ever saw him again, he would kill him. Shane drove off, calling Vic a hypocrite.\n\nAt the end of season six, Shane kidnapped Vic's family and locked them in a cargo container. Although Shane did this to protect them from Armenian mob boss Diro Kesakhian, Vic was enraged. At the beginning of season seven, after he learned the reasons behind it, Vic grudgingly allied himself with Shane in order to protect his family from both the Armenian Mafia and Mexican drug lord Cruz Pezuela. As time passed, however, Vic and Ronnie decided that the time had come for Shane to pay with his life for murdering Lem. They arranged for him to be assassinated by Pezuela's Mexican drug cartel. At the last second, Vic tried to call off the hit on Shane, but was unable to reach Shane on his cell phone. Although Shane's Armenian employers were all murdered, Shane escaped and pocketed the payoff money.\n\nShane decided to retaliate by blackmailing a small-time pimp into murdering Ronnie and preparing to murder Vic himself. When the pimp revealed the truth to Dutch Wagenbach, Shane fled the Barn and went on the run with his wife and son. The series came to its climax as Vic resigned from the police force and set out to insulate himself from prosecution by hunting down and murdering Shane and Mara Vendrell.\n\nHowever, Shane began blackmailing Vic by threatening to surrender and testify against him unless he was kept ahead of the manhunt. Ultimately, Shane was horrified to learn of Vic's immunity deal during a cell phone conversation. As a result of Vic's taunts, Shane murdered his pregnant wife, Mara, and his son Jackson by poison. As his fellow officers kicked down the door, Shane shot himself in the head.\n\nIn the series finale, Vic placed a picture of himself and Lem on his new desk at ICE headquarters. Though originally, the picture was of all four members of the Strike Team, Vic seemed to have cropped Shane and Ronnie out of the frame, unable to reconcile himself with Shane's betrayal of Lem and subsequent suicide.\n\nThe loyalty of Detective Ronnie Gardocki to Vic and the Strike Team was tested several times, such as when crime lord Armadillo Quintero burned Ronnie's face and threatened to file an excessive force complaint unless Mackey forced Gardocki to recant his statement. When the Strike Team temporarily disbanded at the end of season three, Ronnie was the only one to stay by Vic's side when Shane and Lem went their separate ways.\n\nGardocki's loyalty is exhibited the best when Shane revealed his and Vic's murder of Terry Crowley years earlier, in order to drive a wedge between the remaining two members of the Strike Team. Ronnie revealed to Vic that he had long suspected the latter's involvement and that he understood why Vic did what he did. Furthermore, Ronnie added that he could have provided Mackey with emotional support after the murder, citing that he would have \"looked out for [Mackey] better\" than Vendrell did.\n\nRonnie often played Devil's Advocate to Vic, forcing him to address truths which Vic would rather ignore. In particular, in the wake of Shane's confession to Lem's murder, Ronnie pressed Vic to kill Shane even when Vic had second thoughts and tried to halt their first assassination attempt. Gardocki felt justified when Shane tried to murder them a few days later. Captain Wyms disbanded the Strike Team after Ronnie's assailant fingered Shane. As a result, Vic resigned from the Department, and Ronnie returned to regular detective duty.\n\nRonnie felt panic at the thought of Shane, by then a fugitive, being arrested and confessing to the many crimes committed by the Strike Team and even considering running to Mexico. However, Vic dissuaded him and tried to arrange ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) jobs for the both of them.\n\nWhen ICE offered Vic immunity but not Ronnie, Vic refused to accept unless Ronnie received a similar deal too. However, after witnessing the staged arrest of his ex-wife, Corinne, Vic took the deal and confessed to everything. After a disgusted Agent Murray informed him that he had implicated Ronnie in \"enough shit to send him to prison for the rest of his life,\" Vic promised to \"string him along\" until after the arrest of Mexican drug lord Guillermo Beltran.\n\nAfter Beltran's arrest and the largest drug seizure in ICE history, Vic and Ronnie were summoned back to The Barn. Believing that they were both safe forever, Ronnie was shocked when Dutch Wagenbach arrested him for \"the last three years.\" Enraged and devastated by Vic's betrayal, Ronnie shouted profanity at his former mentor and demanded to know whatever happened to protecting the Team, pointing out Vic's hypocrisy. Vic was noticeably crushed by seeing his last remaining friend arrested and denounced him from his mind to spare himself the grief. In the series finale, Vic is seen placing a picture of himself and Lem on his new desk at ICE headquarters. Though originally the picture was of all four members of the Strike Team at a celebration, Vic cropped Shane and Ronnie out of the frame, unable to reconcile himself with his own betrayal of Ronnie.\n\nA running theme in the last few seasons of the series was Vic's regret towards what happened to Lem. As a result of the Money Train robbery which the team had convinced a reluctant Lem to participate in, he developed great fear and health problems from having to live with the aftermath of the robbery, which included innocent lives in the crosshairs of the Armenian Mob, Captain Aceveda, Detective Wagenbach and the Department of Treasury all looking for the culprits. His burning of the money to elude capture ignited antagonism between him and Shane Vendrell, which ultimately brought the entire team's existence to an end.\n\nWhen the Strike Team eventually returned, Vic had Lem get collateral from a drug dealer to ensure a tip regarding the whereabouts of a body that could implicate Shane was corrupt. The brick of heroin was soon seized by IAD and Lem became a means with which Lieutenant Jon Kavanaugh could take down the entire Strike Team. Lem's loyalty was tested when he found out Vic killed Terry, but he remained loyal to the team. After an arrest caused by Vic and Lem's viewing of a personal moment between Kavanaugh and his ex-wife, Lem decided to plead guilty to the charges. But with Vic unable to fulfill a deal with Antwon Mitchell to ensure Lem's safety, Vic made Lem go fugitive. Before Vic and Ronnie could meet up with him, Shane killed Lem with a grenade. In the aftermath, Vic undertook several actions to avenge Lem's death, including torturing and killing suspect Guardo Lima and trying to murder real killer Shane Vendrell on multiple occasions after he learned of Shane's role in Lem's death. Lem, the only one Vic still had an untainted friendship with, remained the one Strike Team member in the Strike Team photo in Vic's cubicle at ICE.\n\nIn the early days of the Strike Team, Mackey was nearly taken down when rookie Officer Julien Lowe caught Vic and the Strike Team stealing cocaine from a crime scene. Although Julien approached Captain Aceveda and promised to testify against Vic and the Team, Mackey swiftly obtained leverage against his fellow cop. While arresting a wanted fugitive, Vic noted that the latter was having homosexual relations with Julien. Holding the upper hand at last, Vic threatened to denounce Julien to the entire precinct. However, he offered to falsify the arrest report in exchange for Julien recanting his allegations against the Strike Team.\n\nA terrified Julien caved in to Vic's demands. After this, Vic repeatedly attempted to be friendly to Julien, with varying degrees of reception. However, when Julien was offered a position in the Strike Team, he at first refused, saying that he did not wish to work alongside Mackey. He only accepted the promotion after being told that Vic would soon be fired from the department.\n\nAlthough Julien continued to serve alongside the Team, the corrupt activities of Shane, Vic, and Ronnie were carefully concealed from him. After Shane was caught in a botched attempt to murder Vic and Ronnie, a horrified Captain Wyms disbanded the Strike Team permanently. Julien was returned to uniformed patrol, but was promised a swift promotion to Detective. When Wyms and Detective Wagenbach confronted him about the possibility of having to arrest his former teammates, Lowe unequivocally stated his loyalty was to the precinct and not to the Strike Team.\n\nThe tension between Mackey and David Aceveda evolved in different ways since the birth of \"The Shield\". Although Aceveda privately detested Mackey, he was not above breaking the law himself. He also frequently blurred the lines between investigating Mackey and protecting him.\n\nIn the first season, Aceveda was heavily bent on proving Mackey's guilt, putting all his effort into taking him down. While Mackey detested Aceveda's political ambitions, Aceveda continued to label Mackey as \"Al Capone with a badge.\"\n\nAt the start of the second season, Aceveda, not wanting a scandal in the midst of his political career, agreed to watch Mackey's back if he could make the Strike Team appear to clean up their act and exhibit professionalism at all times. This created a very subtle, bumpy friendship between the two. This \"friendship,\" however, ended when Aceveda left for his City Council position, but not before writing a scathing letter which accused Mackey of the Crowley murder and irreparably damaged his career.\n\nAt the end of the sixth season, Aceveda continued to push for progress on the San Marcos killings, a massacre of several Mexican immigrants by unknown assailants, mostly at the behest of Mexican real estate developer Cruz Pezuela, who was also financing his investigation committee into a possible run for mayor. Aceveda also used his political influence to ensure that Mackey was forced into early retirement at a Review Board Hearing. However, events took a wild turn, as a graphic photo taken by Juan Lozano of Aceveda's rape suddenly reappeared in the hands of Pezuela, who gave it to Vic as a way to save his job.\n\nVic attempted to use the photo against Aceveda, only to have it denounced as a fake and to have Aceveda's lawyer threaten him with a lawsuit for slander and blackmail. Mackey later returned with the memory card, the background story of the photo, and all the existing copies. Aceveda was stunned to hear about Cruz Pezuela's involvement in the photo, and after listening to Mackey's theory, agreed to help him in his investigation into Pezuela's activities. The scope of the operation stunned both of them; Pezuela was helping the Mexican drug cartels buy into Farmington, and planned on using various businesses as fronts for money laundering, drug trafficking, and prostitution. Aceveda received the memory card as a symbol of trust between him and Mackey, and the two decided to investigate Pezuela, in hopes of shutting his operation down.\n\nLater, Aceveda met with Vic, who had walked out on a Department Review Board hearing and stolen a car full of blackmail material from one of Pezuela's couriers. Aceveda was shocked to learn the dirty secrets of many of the most influential people in Southern California, including public officials, mayoral aides, and the heads of special interest groups.\n\nAs the series wound to a close, Aceveda and Vic continued to collaborate in order to destroy Pezuela's drug cartel. Their friendship ended, however, when Vic destroyed Aceveda's attempts to blackmail ICE Agent Olivia Murray with information from Pezuela's box.\n\nAfter Vic arranged an immunity deal with ICE, Aceveda was enraged that Vic could never be prosecuted for any of his crimes. The two collaborated one last time, however, in order to arrange the arrest of drug lord Guillermo Beltran. While speaking over the phone, Aceveda expressed satisfaction that ICE had realized that, \"they have a reptile working for them.\" Uninterested in Aceveda's views on his character, Vic coldly reminded Aceveda about \"respecting each others' endgames\", marking the final communication between the two men.\n\nMackey's training officer and first partner was Joe Clark, who taught him how to deal with violent street criminals and how to bend the laws to his advantage. Clark was eventually dismissed from the force for beating a suspect. Clark's legacy to Vic was the justification that they always \"did more good than bad\". He rededicated himself to support his friends and family in light of the crimes and trouble he had caused them. In season 6, Mackey re-encounters Clark, who has become a for-hire enforcer who uses his intimidation skills from his days as a cop to earn an income. Mackey participates in one raid, and realizes this type of occupation is both dangerous and unnecessarily cruel.\n\nMackey also had a close friendship with a prostitute, Connie Reisler, whom in an unseen story he found \"lying in a bathroom in a pool of bloody crystals\", trying to end her pregnancy with drain cleaner and a plunger. He told her if she ever needed any help she could call him, and they developed a deep bond. However, Connie was killed in season 2, by a murderer on a criminal informant assignment for Mackey. Since her death, Mackey occasionally checks in on her son, Brian, who is in foster care.\n\nFor many years, Vic had an on-off sexual relationship with Sergeant Danny Sofer and fathered her illegitimate son Lee. In season 6, Vic's daughter Cassidy angrily confronted Mackey after listening to her mother discussing the baby's paternity over the telephone.\n\nMackey was married for a little over 12 years to his wife, Corinne. They had a great marriage up until the point when the Strike Team was formed. However, problems between the two resulted in the marriage disintegrating. Though he had often cheated on his wife, he was devastated when she left him. He loves his three children very much and would do anything for them. At the end of season six, he refused to parade his autistic children in front of a department review board, despite the fact that Aceveda told him that it could save his job.\n\nIn season one, his son Matthew was diagnosed with autism. Later, his youngest daughter was diagnosed with autism as well. These family problems, and the necessary financial support, are the overriding factors as to why Mackey continues to pursue money illegally.\n\nArguably, Vic's worst crime was the murder of the fifth and then-newest member of his team, Detective Terry Crowley. Crowley had been sent by Captain David Aceveda and the Justice Department to build a Federal case against the Strike Team for colluding with drug lord Rondell Robinson. Vic was secretly warned of this by his friend, Assistant Chief Ben Gilroy.\n\nLater, while Vic and Strike Team members Shane Vendrell and Crowley were raiding the home of a rival drug lord (named \"Two Time\"), the dealer stepped out of the bathroom with a pistol and was promptly gunned down by Vic and Shane. However, as Detective Crowley walked into the room, Vic picked up Two Time's gun and shot him in the head. Vic and Shane then rigged the crime scene evidence, claiming that \"Two Time\" stepped out of the bathroom, shot Terry, and was slain by their return fire. Shane expressed extreme remorse and guilt in the aftermath of the murder, but Vic remained stoic and told him to never mention or talk about it again, though he would later express his own feelings of regret about it.\n\nFellow Strike Team members Curtis \"Lem\" Lemansky and Ronald \"Ronnie\" Gardocki were not informed on Terry's secret undercover status and Vic and Shane's murder plot, and were not involved in the eventual murder due to various reasons. Lem was notably closer with Terry as shown by his reaction to the news of his death, and was acknowledged by Vic and Shane as being the most conscientious of the team, both facts which would prove problematic. Ronnie was generally left out of the most questionable of the Team's illegal activities due to his less active role within the team, though this would eventually change as he became closer to Vic.\n\nRegardless, both men would later individually find out the truth behind Terry's death years later; Lem through Jon Kavanaugh, and Ronnie through Shane. Both had varying reactions to the revelation. Lem seemed visibly shocked and soon doubtful that Vic was innocent, but Vic ultimately convinced Lem that Kavanaugh was lying about the murder to split up the team, with Vic's ulterior motive to stop Lem from testifying against him. Ronnie was ultimately unmoved when Shane told him of Crowley's murder by Vic's hand in order to turn him against Vic, as he long suspected as much. He later told Vic he wished he had involved him and that he probably could have helped Vic deal with it better than Shane. Captain Aceveda was certain that Mackey was behind Terry's murder and set out to send him and the Strike Team to prison for it, but he never succeeded.\n\nIn season 5, Lieutenant Jon Kavanaugh of internal affairs made it his personal mission to send Vic to prison for Terry's murder. He commandeered the Captain's office in \"The Barn\" and plastered it with grisly photographs of the Crowley murder scene. He even tried to guilt a confession from Vic and Shane by ordering them to revisit the crime scene and describe what happened in front of Terry's weeping brother. Vic and Shane, however, calmly stuck to their original story and Kavanaugh's crusade ultimately changed into a personal vendetta which destroyed his career.\n\nAs the series moved toward a close, Vic finagled a Federal deal for full immunity from prosecution for every crime he admitted to. Using Shane's memoirs as a guide, he spoke in detail about everything the Strike Team had done, including the murder of Terry. Being the last team-member left other than Vic, Ronnie was arrested for \"covering up Detective Terry Crowley's murder\". As a confessed cop-killer, Vic was regarded as scum by his former colleagues at the Barn and was trapped in a cubicle by his new employers at I.C.E.\n\nMackey and his team committed numerous crimes like extortion, money laundering, smuggling, drug trafficking and obstruction of justice that would likely earn them long prison sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the fifth season, Vic attempted to throw Internal Affairs Lieutenant Jon Kavanaugh from his game by sleeping with Kavanaugh's mentally-ill ex-wife.\n\nIn response, Kavanaugh's hatred of Mackey consumed and completely overwhelmed his conscience, leading him to begin breaking the law himself in destroy the man he regarded as \"pissing all over\" the entire police department.\n\nAfter a failed attempt to seek revenge against Vic Mackey by attempting to assault Corrine Mackey and (supposedly) allying with Antwon Mitchell to send Lem to a prison under Mitchell's control, Kavanaugh planted evidence in Vic's home, implicating Vic in the murder of Lemansky. Subsequently, Kavanaugh used a CI that had turned against Mackey to make up a story of how Vic utilized the Salvadorans to kill Lem by threatening to kill her son. However, Dutch Wagenbach did not believe the CI's story and was suspicious of the convenient presence of evidence in Vic's house considering the hate held by Kavanaugh in addition to the lies that the Lieutenant made up regarding the CI's whereabouts. Kavanaugh's story fell apart when Claudette managed to get the CI alone in interrogation, causing the Lieutenant to break down and confess to the fabrication. When Dutch Wagenbach and Claudette Wyms exposed his actions, Kavanaugh was stripped of his badge and imprisoned. Soon after, Vic visited Kavanaugh in prison and gloated over his victory, but the disgraced Lieutenant remained unfazed.\n\nAfter Cruz Pezuela persuaded the drug lord Guillermo Beltran to visit from Mexico, it became apparent that Beltran was the major focus of an ongoing ICE investigation. In exchange for developing a Federal case against Beltran, Vic, in order to protect his ex-wife Corrine, decided to arrange for full immunity by admitting to all the crimes he has committed, including the slayings of Detective Terry Crowley, Margos Dezerian, Guardo Lima, and many others. After he had detailed all of his crimes, a horrified Agent Olivia Murray told Vic that he had, \"implicated Detective Gardocki in enough shit to send him to prison for the rest of his life.\" Vic responded that he needed Ronnie's help to bust Beltran and that he would, \"string him along,\" until then.\n\nAgent Murray then asked Vic, \"Do you have any idea what you've just done to me?\" Vic's response: \"I've done worse.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of Beltran's arrest, Captain Wyms summoned Vic and Ronnie back to their former precinct. She then brought Vic into the interrogation room and read Shane's suicide letter aloud, while showing him photographs of the Vendrell bodies. Although Vic was devastated, he restrained himself from reacting emotionally to the material when he noticed the surveillance cameras that Wyms was watching him on. He then tore the camera off the wall and smashed it on the floor, telling Wyms angrily to bill him for it. Claudette icily responded, \"Fine, your first payment is due right now.\"\n\nAs Vic then watched in horror, Ronnie Gardocki, his last remaining friend, was placed under arrest by Detective Dutch Wagenbach inside the Strike Team's former Club House. Enraged and devastated, Ronnie was handcuffed and led away while screaming profanity at Vic, and demanding to know whatever happened to protecting the Strike Team. As his former colleagues eyed him with frigid loathing, Vic left the precinct for the last time.\n\nFrightened by what actions Vic may take for her attempts to send him to prison, Vic's ex-wife Corinne pleaded with Claudette and Dutch for protection from him. In response, they approached I.C.E. Agent Olivia Murray and advised her that taking Vic's children away was the best means of hurting him. Corinne and the children disappeared into the Witness Protection Program.\n\nIn the aftermath, Vic begged for the opportunity to say goodbye to his children. Unmoved, Agent Murray responded, \"You said goodbye to them the moment you shot another cop in the face.\"\n\nRealizing that the deal didn't stipulate they were required to employ him, Murray further vowed to make Vic's three years at I.C.E time as unpleasant as possible by severely curtailing his duties: taking him off of the streets, forbidding that he carry a weapon, and demanding that he do a ten-page report every day and one weekly drug test on demand. She made it clear to Vic that if he deviated from the rules set for him it would be a violation of his immunity deal. Forced to wear a suit and tie, Vic was trapped in a cubicle, completely alone. He scattered his desk with pictures of his three children from his marriage with Corinne, and a photo of himself drinking beer with Lem. There were no photos of Shane, Ronnie, Corinne, or Lee, the illegitimate child he had fathered with Sergeant Danny Sofer.\n\nHearing police sirens, Mackey looked out the office window. Returning to his desk, Vic's eyes filled with tears as he stared at the photographs of his children. Suddenly his face contorted into a snarl. Vic removed a .357 Desert Eagle pistol from his drawer, holstered it beneath his shirt and walked off into the night.\n\nOn the FX original series \"Sons of Anarchy\", a semi truck driver named Milo (played by Chiklis) appears in the penultimate episode of the 7th (final) season. Milo mentions that he has four kids last time he counted, loosely hinting that he is Vic Mackey.\n\nOn Bravo TV's countdown of the 100 Greatest Television Characters, Michael Chiklis described Mackey as \"a cross between Hannibal Lecter and Dirty Harry.\" Vic Mackey was seen as a pattern of more violent anti-heroes on television.\n"}

{"id": "2254600", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2254600", "title": "Peak programme meter", "text": "Peak programme meter\n\nA peak programme meter (PPM) is an instrument used in professional audio that indicates the level of an audio signal.\n\nDifferent kinds of PPM fall into broad categories:\n\nIn professional use, which requires consistent level measurements across an industry, audio level meters often comply with a formal standard. This ensures that all compliant meters indicate the same level for a given audio signal. The principal standard for PPMs is IEC 60268-10. It describes two different quasi-PPM designs that have roots in meters originally developed in the 1930s for the AM radio broadcasting networks of Germany (Type I) and the United Kingdom (Type II). The term Peak Programme Meter usually refers to these IEC-specified types and similar designs. Though originally designed for monitoring analogue audio signals, these PPMs are now also used with digital audio.\n\nPPMs do not provide effective loudness monitoring. Newer types of meter do, and there is now a push within the broadcasting industry to move away from the traditional level meters in this article to two new types: loudness meters based on EBU Tech. 3341 and oversampling true PPMs. The former would be used to standardise broadcast loudness to −23 LUFS and the latter to prevent digital clipping.\n\nIn common with many other types of audio level meter, PPMs originally used electro-mechanical displays. These took the form of moving-coil panel meters or mirror galvanometers with demanding 'ballistics': the key requirement being that the indicated level should rise as quickly as possible with negligible overshoot. These displays require active driver electronics.\n\nNowadays PPMs are often implemented as 'bargraph' incremental displays using solid-state illuminated segments in a vertical or horizontal array. For these, IEC 60268-10 requires a minimum of 100 segments and a resolution better than 0.5 dB at the higher levels.\n\nMany operators prefer the moving-coil meter type of display, in which a needle moves in an arc, because they feel the angular movement is easier for the human eye to monitor than the linear movement of a bargraph.\n\nPPMs can also be implemented in software—in a general-purpose computer or by a dedicated device that inserts a PPM image into a picture signal for display on a picture monitor.\n\nA variety of terms such as 'line-up level' and 'operating level' exist, and their meaning may vary from place to place. In an attempt bring clarity to level definitions in the context of programme transmission from one country to another, where different technical practices may apply, ITU-R Rec. BS.645 defined three reference levels: Measurement Level (ML), Alignment Level (AL) and Permitted Maximum Level (PML). This document shows the reading corresponding to these levels for several types of meter. Alignment Level is the level of a steady sine-wave alignment tone. Permitted Maximum Level refers to the permitted maximum \"meter indication\" that operators should aim for on speech, music etc., not tone.\n\nPPMs often use white-on-black displays, to minimise eyestrain especially with extended periods of use.\n\nPPMs are usually calibrated in one of these ways:\n\nWhichever scheme is used, usually there is a scale mark corresponding to Alignment Level.\n\nMost PPMs have an approximately logarithmic scale, i.e., roughly linear in decibels, to provide useful indications over a wide dynamic range.\n\nQuasi-PPMs use a short integration time so they can register peaks longer than a few milliseconds in duration. In the original context of AM radio broadcasting in the 1930s, overloads due to shorter peaks were considered unimportant on the grounds that the human ear could not detect distortion due to momentary clipping. Ignoring momentary clipping made it possible to increase average modulation levels. In modern digital audio practice, where quality standards are hopefully much higher than AM radio in the 1930s, clipping of even short peaks is usually regarded as something to avoid.\n\nOn typical, real-world audio signals, a quasi-PPM under-reads the true peak by 6 to 8 dB. Nevertheless, quasi-PPMs are still widely used in the digital age because of their usefulness in achieving programme balance. Overloads are avoided by allowing, typically, 9 dB of headroom when controlling digital levels with a quasi-PPM.\n\nThe extent to which quasi-PPMs show less than the true amplitude of momentary peaks is determined by the 'integration time'. This is defined by IEC 60268-10 as, \"...the duration of a burst of sinusoidal voltage of 5000 Hz at reference level that results in an indication 2 dB below reference indication.\" This standard also contains tables showing the difference between indicated and true peaks for tone bursts of other durations. The longer the integration time, the greater the difference between the true and indicated peaks.\n\nIn earlier standards, different methods of measurement and criteria were used, such as 0.2 Neper or 80% voltage instead of 2 dB, but the practical difference between them was small.\n\nA Type I PPM has an integration time of 5 milliseconds and a Type II PPM has an integration time of 10 milliseconds.\n\nAll PPMs have a return time much longer than the integration time, to give the operator more time to see the peaks and reduce eye strain. Type I PPMs fall back 20 dB in 1.7 seconds. Type II PPMs fall back 24 dB in 2.8 seconds.\n\nThe PPM was originally developed, independently in both Germany and the United Kingdom, for use in AM radio broadcasting networks in the 1930s. These were quasi-peak meters with some features in common but otherwise substantially different. They are superior to earlier types of meter that were not good for monitoring peak audio levels.\n\nIn about 1936 and 1937, German broadcasters developed a peak programme meter with a mirror galvanometer known as a \"Lichtzeigerinstrument\" (light pointer) for the display. The system consisted of a drive amplifier (e.g., ARD types U21 and U71) and a separate display unit (e.g., ARD types J47 and J48). A stereo version, known as a \"Doppel-Lichtzeigerinstrument\" contained two mirror galvanometer displays in a single housing. Such displays were still used until the 1970s, when solid-state bargraph displays became the norm.\n\nThe design became standardised as DIN 45406. It evolved into the Type I meter in IEC 60268-10 and it is still known colloquially as a DIN PPM. Compared to the Type II designs it has faster integration and return times, a much wider dynamic range and a semi-logarithmic scale, and is calibrated in dB relative to Permitted Maximum Level. It remains in use in much of northern Europe.\n\nIn German broadcasting, the nominal analogue signal corresponding to Permitted Maximum Level was standardised by ARD at 1.55 volts (+6 dBu), and this is the usual sensitivity of a DIN-type PPM for an indication of 0 dB. Alignment Level (−3 dBu) is shown on the meter by a scale mark at −9.\n\nIn Scandinavia a variant of the DIN PPM known as 'Nordic' is used. It has the same integration and return times but a different scale, with 'TEST' corresponding to Alignment Level (0 dBu) and +9 corresponding to Permitted Maximum Level (+9 dBu). Compared to the DIN scale, the Nordic scale is more logarithmic and covers a somewhat smaller dynamic range.\n\nThe BBC used a number of methods of measuring programme volume in its early years, including the 'volume indicator' and 'slide-back voltmeter'.\n\nBy 1932, when the BBC moved to purpose-built facilities in Broadcasting House, the first audio meter called a 'programme meter' was introduced. It was developed by Charles Holt-Smith of the Research Department and became known as the 'Smith meter'. This was the first meter with white markings on a black background. It was driven by a circuit that gave a roughly logarithmic transfer characteristic, so it could be calibrated in decibels. The overall characteristics were the product of the driver circuit and the movement's ballistics.\n\nThe first of the PPMs was designed by C. G. Mayo, also of the BBC's Research Department. It came into service in 1938. It kept the Smith meter's logarithmic, white-on-black display, and included all the key design features that are still used to this day with only slight modification: full-wave rectification, fast integration and slow return times, and a simple scale calibrated from 1 to 7.\n\nMayo and others determined the integration and return times by a series of experiments. At first, they intended to create a true peak meter to prevent transmitters from exceeding 100% modulation. They created a prototype meter with an integration time of about 1 ms. They found that the ear tolerates distortion of only a few ms, and that a 'registration time' of 4 ms is sufficient. They made the return time a compromise between a rapid return, which was tiring to the eye—and a slow return, which made control difficult. Engineers decided that the meter should take between 2s and 3s to drop back 26 dB.\n\nThe BBC PPM became the subject of several formal standards: BS 4297:1968 (superseded); BS5428:Part 9:1981 (superseded) and then BS 6840-10:1991. The text of the latter is identical to the Type IIa PPM in IEC 60268-10:1991.\n\nAlignment level (0 dBu) and Permitted Maximum Level (+8 dBu) correspond to scale marks '4' and '6' respectively.\n\nThe BBC PPM was adopted by commercial broadcasters in the UK. Other organisations around the world, including the EBU, CBC and ABC used the same dynamics but with slightly different scales.\n\nModern British PPMs have a 4 dB spacing between the scale marks. Older designs had a 6 dB spacing between '1' and '2'. This discrepancy can sometimes also be found at the equivalent position on the derived CBC and ABC scales.\n\nFrom its inception in 1939 until 2009, the PPM display was available in the form of an electro-mechanical, moving-coil meter movement with a demanding ballistic specification. For many years these were manufactured by Ernest Turner and Company, and in later years by Sifam, based in Torquay. In 2009, Sifam announced it was ending production of the Type 74 dual-needle meter movement. In 2010, Sifam ended all PPM meter movement manufacturing. Three major users—Bryant Unlimited, Canford Audio, and TSL—placed final orders with Sifam for large stocks of the meters to supply manufacturing and maintenance activities for several years.\n\nIn the UK, twin-needle PPMs are sometimes used for stereo. Red and green needles are used for left and right. This colour convention comes from port and starboard navigation lights, in accordance with an ancient BBC in-joke about Broadcasting House resembling a battleship. White and yellow needles are used for sum and difference (M and S). A more recent variation is to use a black needle with a dayglo orange tip for S instead of yellow.\n\nThe sensitivity of the S indication can be increased on some meter installations by 20 dB; this is to aid line-up procedures, e.g., of stereo mic pairs, or the azimuth of analogue tape machine heads, which rely on cancellation of the S signal.\n\nM and S meters are normally aligned to the 'M6' standard in which M = (L + R) − 6 dB and S = (L − R) − 6 dB. In other words, the sum and difference signals are each attenuated by 6 dB before being displayed on the meter. As a result, signals of identical amplitude and phase in the left and right channels make the M meter show exactly the same deflection as for the individual L and R meters. This is because summing two identical signals produces a result 6 dB louder than either source, but the M and S meters show summed signals attenuated by 6 dB to compensate. The M6 standard means that dual mono sources (e.g. a presenter panned to the centre of a stereo sound stage) can be peaked to 6 in both channels, with the M meter also showing 6.\n\nThe M6 format has largely replaced the earlier 'M3' standard in which the sum and difference attenuation is only 3 dB. This M3 format is designed to give a more accurate indication of the level of the summed mono signal when working with conventional stereo material. The premise is that in summing two signals of similar level but carrying non-phase-coherent sounds (i.e. typical stereo material), the result averages 3 dB more than either source channel (rather than 6 dB more). The M3 standard means that true stereo material can be peaked to 6 in both channels, with the M meter also showing 6. However, dual-mono sources can only be peaked to 5.25 in each channel to keep the M meter at 6.\n\nNote: the chosen M6/M3 metering standard does not affect the relative audible balance of sounds panned to one side versus the centre – that is determined solely by the panning law of the mixing console's pan-pot.\n\nThe M6 standard is deemed a simpler form of metering for untrained broadcasters to use as it keeps the M meter at '4' for Alignment Level and '6' for peaks, without the operator having to remember to subtract 3 dB.\n\nCommercial broadcasting in the UK initially used M3 but had switched to M6 by 1980. This was mandated by the IBA's Engineering Code of Practice. BBC installations used M3 until 1999. The BBC now uses M6 in both radio and TV, although much legacy equipment is still configured for the 'traditional' M3 standard.\n\nThe EBU PPM is a variant of the British PPM designed for the control of programme levels in international programme exchange. It is formalised as the Type IIb PPM in IEC 60268-10. It is identical to the British PPM except for the scale plate, which is calibrated in dB relative to Alignment Level, which is marked 'TEST'. There are also ticks at 2 dB intervals and at +9 dB, corresponding to Permitted Maximum Level.\n\nIn the late 1930s PPMs were considered for use in the US, but rejected in favour of a 'Standard Volume Indicator' (VU meter) on grounds of cost. Joint research by CBS, NBC and Bell Labs found that using an experimental design of PPM (with a relatively long integration time of 25 ms) in the control of programme levels gave only a 1 dB advantage over the VU meter, in terms of average output level for a given amount of distortion. It was felt that this was too small to justify the much greater expense. It was also found that VU meters gave more consistent readings than PPMs when comparing programme levels at the sending and receiving end of long lines subject to group delay, which altered the waveform. This finding has been disputed by others.\n\nA widely believed myth is that the PPM was developed as a superior alternative to the VU meter. In fact, the PPM came first, and if anything the VU meter was developed as an economical alternative to the PPM.\n\nBy 1980, ABC had about 100 PPMs in use in control rooms in New York and its Washington News Bureau, and was ordering new consoles with PPMs fitted. These were Type II PPMs with the seven marks labelled −22, −16, −12, −8, −4, 0 and +4. ABC found that a modified version of the EBU meter based on the VU-meter 'A scale' was best, since it let operators use their usual jargon such as 'zero level' etc. The appearance is similar to an EBU scale except that the numbers are 8 dB lower.\n\nTo aid alignment on both VU meters and PPMS, ABC in New York used a special test signal known as ATS. A 440 Hz tone alternated between steady tone at +8 dBu (indicated at 0 VU and −8 PPM) and tone bursts at +16 dBu (indicated at 0 VU and 0 PPM).\n\nBy 1978 PPMs were in use at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's Vancouver plant. Some 30 or 40 PPMs were in use, with just one or two VU meters retained for settling telco disputes. These are Type II PPMs with the seven marks labelled −6, 0, +4, +8, +12, +16 and +20: this scaling shows absolute levels in dBu (or dBm into 600 Ω). The appearance is similar to the ABC PPM except that all the numbers are 16 dB higher.\n\nThe South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) uses a Type II PPM modified with a black-on-white scale plate calibrated in percentage and dB relative to Permitted Maximum Level, which is +6 dBu. Alignment Level is 0 dBu or 50%.\n\nIEC 60268-18 is a partial standard for a PPM designed for use with digital audio in both professional and consumer use, using \"incremental dot or bar type displays or numerical displays\". Such a display shows level relative to 0 dBFS. The integration time can have any value less than 5 ms − thus both true-peak and quasi-peak meters can comply, and different meters may indicate very different levels despite compliance with the standard. The return time has the same value as a Type I meter: 1.7±0.3 seconds for a 20 dB fall.\n\nIEC 60268-10 specifies three variants: Types I, IIa and IIb, known colloquially as the DIN, British and EBU types respectively. Types IIa and IIb differ only in the scale marks.\n\nThe Nordic, ABC, CBC and SABC variants are not specified in IEC 60268-10. The Nordic PPM uses Type I ballistics with a different scale. The ABC, CBC and SABC variants use Type II ballistics with different scales.\n\nParameters for the VU meter and Nagra modulometer are included in the table below for comparison. Some information has been obtained from ITU-T Rec. J.15.\n\n The 'modulometer' is a proprietary type of quasi-PPM found on Nagra products. It has an integration time (−2 dB) of 7.5 ms, and a semi-logarithmic scale with an appearance between that of a VU meter and a DIN-type PPM. A stereo version (\"double modulometer\") uses a meter movement with two coaxial needles.\n\nIn typical practice for Nagra analogue tape recorders, Alignment Level is regarded as −8 and maximum level 0. Thus sound recordists using location mixers would typically send a tone at 0 VU or PPM 4 (British) and adjust the Nagra recorder's gain to read −8 on the modulometer.\n\nSome newer digital recorders, e.g., the Nagra VI, have modulometers displayed as bargraphs calibrated in dBFS. For these, Alignment Level is as for any other digital PPM, i.e., −18 dBFS (EBU) or −20 dBFS (SMPTE).\n\nTo use PPMs effectively to control sound levels it is necessary to understand design rationale and limitations.\n\nMany engineers prefer the PPM to the much slower VU meter used in the US—but it does require some interpretation in use. Though it gives a useful overload warning, it does not represent either true peak level or subjective loudness. The BBC have tables showing recommended settings for different types of programme, such as speech, classical music etc., which attempt to take account of the latter.\n\nRegardless of the kind of programme, there is usually a nominal Permitted Maximum Level, as indicated on a PPM. Operators are expected to keep levels below it, within reason. Practices vary between countries and organisations. In the UK, the Permitted Maximum Level is 8 dB above Alignment Level, corresponding to '6' on the British PPM scale. ITU-T standards for international sound programme circuits specify a Permitted Maximum Level of 9 dB above Alignment Level. Accordingly, +9 dB is represented by a mark on the EBU PPM scale.\n\nBecause quasi-peak PPMs indicate neither loudness nor true peaks but something between the two, it is important to allow sufficient headroom when using them in the control of digital audio levels. The EBU convention (R68) provides for this by defining Alignment Level as −18 dBFS. Thus a peak to the Permitted Maximum Level \"as indicated on a quasi-PPM\" corresponds to −9 or −10 dBFS. This 9-10 dB margin allows for operator error, the true peak typically being several dB higher than the PPM indication, and that subsequent signal processing (e.g., sample rate conversion) may increase the amplitude.\n\nSMPTE RP 0155 recommends a different alignment level, corresponding to 0 VU, of −20 dBFS. The two conventions result in line-up tone levels that differ by 2 dB, but in practice the level of programme modulation tends to be similar.\n\nThe SMPTE and the EBU agree that regardless of whether −18 or −20 dBFS is used as the Alignment Level, that level should be declared and that in both cases programme should peak to a Permitted Maximum Level of −9 dBFS when measured on an IEC 60268-10 quasi-PPM with an integration time of 10 milliseconds.\n\nIEC 60268-10 is concerned mainly with the highly specified Type I and Type II PPMs used in broadcasting. It does however also contain a brief section on PPMs for 'secondary and consumer' applications. The requirements include a minimum of a 12-segment bargraph type display covering a range of −42 dB to +6 dB relative to nominal maximum level, and the same integration and return times as a Type I PPM.\n"}

It is the eighth episode of the .\n\nSet in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures on Deep Space Nine, a space station located near a stable wormhole between the Alpha and Gamma quadrants of the Milky Way Galaxy, in orbit of the planet Bajor. In this episode, an attack on Quark in his bar leads Odo to re-open an investigation into an unsolved murder dating back to the days of the Cardassian Occupation, and the episode features flashbacks to that time period, including the first time Odo met Kira and Quark, as well as Kira creating the title \"Constable\" for Odo.\n\nWhen \"Necessary Evil\" was broadcast in November 1993, it received a Nielsen rating of 9.3 points and 5th place in its time slot.\n\nA Bajoran woman, Vaatrick Pallra, hires Quark to retrieve a strongbox from her late husband's shop on Deep Space Nine. Quark opens it to find a list of Bajoran names. A stranger, Trazko, sneaks up, shoots Quark and steals the list. As Dr. Bashir tries to revive Quark, Rom tells Odo about the list of names, and that the box was hidden in the shop during the Cardassian Occupation. \n\nIn a flashback, five years earlier, Odo is solicited by Gul Dukat to investigate a murder on behalf of the Cardassian regime. Odo interrogates Vaatrick Pallra, the deceased's widow. She claims her husband had been having an affair with Kira Nerys. When he interviews Kira, she says that there was no intimate relationship between her and Vaatrick, and that she was interviewing for a job at Quark's at the time of the murder.\n\nIn the present, Rom tells Odo that one name on the list resembled \"Ches'so\". Odo interviews Pallra, who claims ignorance of the list of names and the name \"Ches'so\". She also refuses to divulge who loaned her the money to pay her past-due electricity bill. Kira identifies \"Ches'so\": a philanthropist named \"Ches'sarro\", who has just died.\nFive years earlier, Quark admits that Kira bribed him to provide a false alibi. When Odo confronts her about it, Kira reveals that she was committing a terrorist attack on the station. Odo tells Dukat that Kira is not the culprit in the murder.\n\nIn the present, Odo deduces that the names on the list are Bajorans who collaborated during the occupation, whom Pallra has been blackmailing. At the infirmary, Trazko attempts again to kill Quark; Rom saves Quark's life by screaming, gaining the attention of security forces. Brought to DS9, Pallra denies knowing Trazko, but Odo has confirmed that she had transferred a large sum of money into his bank account. When she declares her innocence in the murder of her husband, Odo replies, \"I know.\" \n\nOdo has realized that it is Kira who killed Vaatrick five years earlier. He tells Kira that he began to suspect her when she was able to identify Ches'saro so quickly. When he deduced that the list consisted of Bajoran collaborators, Odo realized that Vaatrick was a collaborator too, and now understands that Dukat chose him to investigate so as to keep distance from his collaborators. Kira, a member of the resistance, killed Vaatrick when he discovered her trying to steal the list of names. She never told Odo because she was afraid it would affect their friendship. Kira asks him if he will be able to trust her again, and he is unable to answer.\n\nIn 2016, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" ranked \"Necessary Evil\" the 19th best episode in \"Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\". They note this as an episode that differentiated this series from its predecessor, \"\", and place the episode in the murder mystery genre.\n\nIn 2017, \"ScreenRant\" ranked this episode the 11th darkest episode of the \"Star Trek\" franchise.\n\nIn 2018, SyFy recommend this episode for its abbreviated watch guide for the Bajoran character Kira Nerys, noting that the episode explores the character's past during the Cardassian occupation. In the episode, an attack on Quark leads to deep trek into the past of the character Kira and Odo, and the dark days of the Cardassian occupation.\n\nIn 2019, Tor.com noted this as an \"essential\" for the character of Odo, remarking that helps establish the character and what it was like for him when he worked for the Cardassians. In the show's back story, the Deep Space Nine space station was previously operated by the Cardassian aliens of the Star Trek franchise.\n\n\n"}

It is one of his earliest works, realized in 1978 on the occasion of his [[Munich]] exhibition.\n\n[[File:Back of Sovereign Hotel with mural and OHS plaza 2014.jpg|thumb|right|One of four Haas murals painted in 1989 on the [[Sovereign Hotel (Portland, Oregon)|Sovereign Hotel]], in Portland, Oregon (\"[[Oregon History (mural)|Oregon History]]\")]]\nHaas is ranked by the [[Artists Trade Union of Russia]] amongst the world-best artists of the last four centuries.\n\nIn addition to a unique and quaint downtown area, Homewood (IL) now boasts the largest collection of Richard Haas murals anywhere in the world. Haas was first invited to Homewood in the early 1980s. Since that time, he has finished 11 murals and was scheduled to complete the 12th mural in late spring 2013. The Village has a time-lapse video that shows one of his recent murals being created.\n\n\"Homewood has a special place in my 35 years of doing public work,\" said Haas. \"This project has allowed me to expand my work in many ways. In Homewood, I was given the freedom to design and execute a new series of works that tells an even larger story, not only about Homewood's history but about the region in general. Homewood now has the largest concentration of my works in one area and I hope people will discover and enjoy these works for a long time to come.\"\n\nIn the downtown area, there are 9 original murals which capture the history of Homewood from the movie theater and 1950s diner to paying homage to the prairie. The expanded murals continue down historic Dixie Highway including a mural on the history of the bicycle.\n\n\"Homewood is a great home for the arts,\" said Homewood Mayor Richard Hofeld. \"We sought Richard out specifically for his realistic style as well as his artistic and historic vision. Residents have given us very positive feedback about seeing the blank canvas of the side of a building become transformed into a work of art.\"\nOriginally from Wisconsin, Haas began large-scale outdoor murals in the 1970s in New York City. His murals can be seen in Boston, Chicago, Ft. Worth, Madison, Milwaukee, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, Portland (Oregon), and St. Louis as well as a variety of smaller cities.\n\nHaas' work has received awards from the American Institute of Architects Medal of Honor, 1977, Guggenheim Fellowship 1983, National Endowment of Arts award 1987, Distinguished Alumnus Award University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee 1991, Jimmy Ernst award, American Academy of Arts and Letters, New York 2005. He was elected into the [[National Academy of Design]] in 1993 as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1994. He served as President of the Academy from 2009 to 2011.\n\nIn Homewood, as well as other locations, Haas works with Thomas Melvin Painting Studio. Haas provides a to-scale painting for Melvin to use and entrusts him with adding details as needed. Melvin has worked on all the murals in Homewood as well as provided touch ups through the years as needed.\n\n\"Homewood is to be commended in engaging such an important artist,\" Melvin said. \"Richard Haas has taken a European tradition and translated it into an American expression given his own unique sensibility. He loves architecture and he brings a sense of humor and his own style to his work. I have enjoyed working in Homewood. Thanks to all the residents for the thumbs up and car honks of appreciation.\"\n\n\n[[Category:American muralists]]\n[[Category:20th-century American painters]]\n[[Category:American male painters]]\n[[Category:21st-century American painters]]\n[[Category:1936 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Trompe-l'œil artists]]\n[[Category:National Academy of Design members]]\n[[Category:People from Spring Green, Wisconsin]]\n[[Category:Artists from Wisconsin]]\n[[Category:20th-century American printmakers]]"}

His most successful stints came early in his career with Darlington and Walsall, playing in over 100 league games for each club. He also spent over 15 years as goalkeeping coach at Bolton Wanderers.\n\nBorn in Ferryhill, County Durham, Barber began his career at Darlington in 1981, where he served his apprenticeship. Barber was notable for donning a mask on entering the field for most matches during his career. He made 135 Football League appearances for the club before a £50,000 move to First Division champions Everton in April 1986.\n\nSigned as understudy to Neville Southall, but after six months and no first-team appearances for Everton, Barber was sold to Walsall for £100,000. In his second season with the club, Walsall were promoted to the Second Division, but then suffered successive relegations. Barber was loaned out to Peterborough United during the 1989–90 season, where he made six appearances. He was again loaned out during the 1990–91 season to Chester City on two occasions, in October 1990 and March 1991, accumulating eight appearances, and to Blackpool in November 1990 where he made two appearances. He also made appearances for Walsall during the same campaign, but moved to Peterborough on a permanent basis in the summer of 1991 for a £25,000 fee. Barber totalled 153 games for Walsall between 1986 and 1991.\n\nBarber made his second debut for Peterborough on 17 August 1991, keeping a clean sheet against Preston North End in a 1–0 victory. He helped the club to promotion to the Second Division with a 1992 play-off final victory over Stockport County, but the club struggled in the second tier. Barber found himself out on loan once again at Chesterfield in February 1993, but didn't make an appearance for the club. He was then sent on loan to Colhester United, making his debut on 20 March 1993 in a 2–0 victory for the U's at Brunton Park. He made 10 appearances for Colchester before returning to Peterborough. In the following season, despite Peterborough finishing bottom of the Second Division, Luton Town made a £25,000 offer for Barber, and he transferred in August 1994, ending his Posh stay with 63 appearances in three years.\n\nJust four months had passed before Barber found himself back at London Road with Peterborough. Having made no first-team appearances for Luton, he was sent on loan where he played five league games. After this loan stint, he played one league game first at Ipswich Town in November 1995, and one league game in a return to Blackpool in December 1995. Barber finished his Football League career by joining Birmingham City in 1996, again making just a single appearance. His last club he actively played for was Kidderminster Harriers, where he made 21 Conference appearances before stepping into coaching.\n\nBarber joined the coaching staff at Bolton Wanderers in 1996, serving as part-time goalkeeping coach under Colin Todd before becoming a full-time employee under Todd's successor Sam Allerdyce. Barber had also been working at West Bromwich Albion as a coach until this point alongside Bryan Robson, but fully committed himself to Wanderers in 2004.\n\nBarber was instrumental in the development of Finland goalkeeper Jussi Jääskeläinen, who joined the club in 1997, making his international debut in 1998. Barber turned Jääskeläinen into one of the Premier League's most consistent goalkeepers, then helping progress Hungary goalkeeper Ádám Bogdán who would later replace Jääskeläinen upon his exit from Bolton.\n\nIn 2007, Barber joined Nigel Worthington as a coach for the Northern Ireland national football team alongside his role at Bolton, where he would spend five years.\n\nWhen Owen Coyle was appointed Bolton manager in 2010, Barber was forced to leave the club as Coyle sought to replace the back-room staff, bringing in former Burnley goalkeeping coach Phil Hughes. However, Barber's protégé Jääskeläinen took exception to Hughes, calling a halt to his training session after just 30 minutes and told Coyle that he wanted Barber to be reinstated. Having already left Bolton, Coyle was forced to ask Barber to return to the club, which he accepted, becoming joint-goalkeeping coach, where Barber took charge of the day-to-day goalkeepers training regime.\n\nFollowing Bolton's relegation to the Championship in 2012, after 16 years coaching, Barber left the club. This also followed Jääskeläinen's own exit as the club looked to refresh its back-room staff once again. He subsequently joined Bury under Kevin Blackwell on 4 October 2012, before being reunited with Worthington after being appointed assistant manager at League Two club York City on 4 March 2013. He left the club on 5 May 2013, going on to concentrate on his freelance goalkeeper coaching business.\n\nIn addition to Bolton, West Brom, Northern Ireland, Bury and York City, as a freelance coach, Barber has previously worked with Oman, Jamaica, Sunderland, Stoke City, Blackpool, Burnley, Bradford City, Stockport County and Rochdale. He also runs his own goalkeeping academy that has helped discover goalkeepers including Jääskeläinen, Bogdán, Ali Al-Habsi and Tomasz Kuszczak.\n\nIn January 2015 he moved to Crewe Alexandra as the goalkeeping coach, after holding a similar role at Burton Albion.\n\nOn 5 August 2015 he moved from Crewe to Blackpool to replace Bobby Mimms, however 2 days later had a change of heart and returned to Crewe.\n\nInfobox statistics\nSpecific\n"}

It is the 10th show in the Ultra Series, the first Ultraman show to be produced during Japan's Heisei period, the first Australian-produced Ultraman show and the first production in the franchise to be entirely filmed outside of Japan.\n\nDespite being co-produced by an Australian studio and filmed in Australia, \"Ultraman: Towards the Future\" never aired in Australia, and instead was released on home video and LaserDisc; however, the show did air in North America in 1992, and in Japan in 1995.\n\nJack Shindo and Stanley Haggard are members of the first manned expedition to Mars, and on the red planet find a giant sluglike monster, Gudis. Suddenly the alien giant, Ultraman Great, arrives and fights Gudis, but is knocked down for a period. Shindo is pinned by a rockslide and Haggard tries to escape in their ship, but it is blown up by Gudis. It is then that Ultraman Great gets up and when he is on the verge of victory, Gudis metamorphoses into a virus and travels to Earth, where it plans on corrupting all life, mutating other creatures into monsters and awakening existing ones. Needing a human host to survive on Earth, Ultraman Great joins with Jack, allowing him to become the colossal alien when all seems lost. He joins the Universal Multipurpose Agency, or UMA, in order to help them battle the monsters.\n\nHalfway through the series Super Gudis reappears, more powerful than before. It imprisons Ultraman Great, but Jack distracts it by ultimately showing it the futility of its mission. Even if it does manage to corrupt all life, eventually there will be nothing else left to corrupt. The distraction allows Ultraman Great to break free and destroy Super Gudis once and for all. For the rest of the series, the environmental themes are stronger and the monsters usually arise from human pollution.\n\nIn the series finale, a doomsday scenario begins with the appearance of two powerful monsters are Kilazee and Kodalar, which tries to wipe out the human race for abusing it. Ultraman Great is defeated by Kodalar, but Jack survives. Ultimately the humans use an ancient disc to destroy Kodalar by reflecting its own power at it, Ultraman Great defeats Kilazee and carries it into space, separating Jack from him and restoring him on Earth as a normal human. The victory is seen as another chance for the human race.\n\n\n\nPrincipal photography lasted for four months. Terry Larsen provided the environmental and ecological themes for the show. Unlike previous installments, spandex was used for Ultraman instead of a rubber suit. Director Andrew Prowse stated that the decision to employ spandex instead of the traditional rubber suit was made so that the \"actor could move in it\" and \"reduce the risk of heat exhaustion\" however, the suit actor passed out one day in the spandex suit. Steve Apps and Robert Simper performed the Ultraman suitmation sequences. Vicky Kite constructed the suits while Andrew Blaxland oversaw the production design.\n\nThe music was composed by Shinsuke Kazato and performed by The Adelaide Symphony Orchestra. Most of the melodies and motifs are based on very similar music used in the 1987 anime \"\" (a.k.a. \"Ultraman: The Adventure Begins\"), which was also scored by Shinsuke Kazato.\n\nThe Ultraman G soundtrack was first released by Nippon Columbia Co., Ltd in 1992 as stock number COCC-9745. It was re-released in 2007 as part of Nippon Columbia's \"ANIMEX2000\" series of inexpensive album reissues, under stock number COCC-72238. As of 2016, this version is still available for order from Japanese record stores.\n\nThe series also received an equally short-lived toyline from DreamWorks toys. The figures were 10\" tall and included Ultraman, who came with a mini Jack Shindo, as well as his enemies Bogun, Barrangas, Majaba, Gerukadon and Kilazee. Also released was a toy of the Hummer vehicle which included a mini figure of Charlie Morgan. A toy of the Saltop was advertised on the back of all boxes, though it was never released or produced according to a Bandai representative. Despite their unique size, the toys were not without their problems. Jack, Charlie and the Hummer were well out of scale with the other toys, while the Ultraman figure lacked articulation. Also, despite being the main villain for the first story arc, neither version of Gudis was released as a toy in the DreamWorks line (although one did appear in Bandai's Japanese vinyl Ultraman line).\n\nA video game based on the series was released for Super Nintendo Entertainment System/Super Famicom. It is thought to have awkward controls and an unfairly high level of difficulty by many. It was based around the same engine as a Japanese Ultraman game based on the original series. In the game Ultraman fights Gudis, Bogun, Deganja, Barrangas, Super Gudis, Gazebo, Majaba, Kodalar, and Kilazee.\n\nA comic book retelling of/sequel to the series, published in early 1993 by Harvey Comics' short-lived \"Nemesis\" label, was printed in the United States. However, the comic treats Ultraman Great as the same Ultraman from the original 1966 series. The comic has also been known to confuse \"Ultraman: Towards the Future\" with the subsequent American-produced series, \"\" (which was released as \"Ultraman Powered\" in Japan), of which the comic had included plenty of full-color publicity pictures in many issues to generate interest. After four issues (five if the \"Minus-1\" issue is included), the comic series was canceled once Harvey Comics went out of business the next year. Most of the issues had different collectible cover variants.\n\n\nIn Thailand, this series aired on Channel 9 (is currently Channel 9 MCOT HD) in 1993 on Saturdays and Sundays late in the day. Sachs Family Entertainment distributed the show for American television via weekly syndication between 4 January 1992 and 28 March 1992.\n\n"}

It was written primarily by John Lennon, but Paul McCartney also worked on it. It was released in the US on \"The Beatles' Second Album\" on 10 April 1964 and in the UK on the \"Long Tall Sally\" EP on 19 June 1964.\n\nLennon wrote the song prior to the formation of the Beatles. In 1963, he gave it to Billy J. Kramer of The Dakotas, another Liverpool band who were signed to Parlophone by George Martin. Kramer released it as the B-side of the single \"Bad to Me\", another Lennon–McCartney composition.\n\nLennon was reportedly dissatisfied with the Dakotas' arrangement of his song as well as its position as the single's B-side, so the Beatles recorded their own version. The song features George Harrison playing the Rickenbacker 360/12 guitar, offering the distinctive sound of the famous guitar to the world for the first time.\n\nDue to the song being considered for inclusion in the Beatles' 1964 debut film \"A Hard Day's Night\", a rush mono mix for United Artists was attempted on 3 March 1964, but would be ultimately scrapped. The following day, a new mono mix was made for the US Capitol Records release \"The Beatles' Second Album\", while a stereo mix edited from two separate takes would be performed on 10 March 1964 and was also rushed to the US for the stereo version of the album. The edit uses an alternate take of the opening guitar riff and the opening line sung by Lennon. The final UK mono mix was performed on 4 June 1964, intended for the \"A Hard Day's Night\" LP, again scrapped but ultimately appearing on the EP \"Long Tall Sally\". The final UK stereo mix, performed on 22 June 1964, three days after the release of the \"Long Tall Sally\" EP, and also intended for the upcoming stereo version of the UK album, would not appear on a British release until the 1976 \"Rock 'n' Roll Music\" compilation (along with the remaining tracks from the \"Long Tall Sally\" EP). The song was never added to the 1964 film \"A Hard Day's Night\" because director Richard Lester rejected it for sounding too similar to \"You Can't Do That\", which was recorded five days prior and featured on the non-soundtrack side of the album release.\n\nThe mono mixes feature cowbell from the start of the rhythm downbeat. The UK stereo edit features no cowbell and has Lennon's vocal single tracked until edited at the second measure of the opening verse, when the cowbell and double tracked vocal appear. The earlier US stereo mix places the edit on the word \"call\", and the double tracking and cowbell begin. It also features vocals more prominent to the right, with the UK version better centered, plus a significant addition of reverb by the producers of \"The Beatles' Second Album\".\n\nThe song's instrumental bridge is the Beatles' first attempt at ska.\n\n\"I Call Your Name\" was re-released in stereo in 1988 on the compilation album \"Past Masters\".\n\nThe Beatles recorded the song for the BBC radio programme \"Saturday Club\" on 31 March 1964 (transmitted 4 April 1964). However, this performance has not been commercially released.\n\n\n\n"}

Written by John Lennon, and credited to Lennon–McCartney, it was considered for release as a single until Lennon wrote \"I Feel Fine\".\n\nAccording to music critic Richie Unterberger, while the lyrics tell a story of romantic rejection, \"I'm a Loser\" is one of the first Beatles compositions that \"goes beyond young love,\" including \"the hypocrisy of keeping up a happy face when your world's falling down\".\n\nIn 1980, Lennon said the song was \"me in my Dylan period\" and added, \"Part of me suspects I'm a loser and part of me thinks I'm God Almighty. [\"Laughs\"]\" Country music and Bob Dylan were catalysts for the song. The country is in the fingerpicking, guitar twang and downhearted words; in 1964, the Beatles were listening to songs by Buck Owens and George Jones that McCartney said were \"all about sadness.\" Musicologists say the song was \"notable for being perhaps the first Beatles' song to directly reflect the influence of Dylan, thus nudging folk and rock a little closer together toward the folk-rock explosion of the following year.\" Musicologist Alan Pollack said the song contained \"a stronger blend of folk elements than almost anything else The Beatles had done to-date.\" The line \"I'm not what I appear to be\" was Lennon's most introspective to date, the start of the progression that led to \"Help\" and \"Nowhere Man\" the following year.\n\nLennon hits a low G in the verses, a note usually reserved for baritone and/or bass singers. This was atypical of Lennon; he sang the bulk of his Beatles songs in a tenor register. \"I'm a Loser\" does not mark the only occasion on which Lennon sang a low G, he also did so in \"Happiness Is a Warm Gun\".\n\nThe song includes what would be the last of John Lennon's harmonica solos, which had been a prominent feature of the band's early-era records and live shows. The group still occasionally used harmonica in their later recordings, such as \"Rocky Raccoon\".\n\nThe Beatles recorded this song on 14 August 1964, the same day as \"Mr. Moonlight\" and \"Leave My Kitten Alone\". It was recorded in eight takes.\n\nIt was released four months after it was recorded, but beforehand, it was previewed on BBC Radio on 17 November, along with three other songs from \"Beatles for Sale\" and also the \"I Feel Fine\"/\"She's a Woman\" single.\n\nIt was also performed before its 4 December 1964 release date. The Beatles performed and recorded an appearance for a British edition of US music TV show Shindig! at the Granville Studio in London on Saturday, 3 October 1964. The performance was watched by London residents of the Beatles Fan Club. The Beatles performed three songs live: Kansas City/Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey!, I'm A Loser and Boys. The British edition of Shindig! was first broadcast in the US by ABC on Wednesday, 7 October 1964, but was never shown in Britain.\".\n\nOn the original pressings of \"Beatles for Sale\", the title was misprinted as \"I'm a Losser\".\n\n\nMarianne Faithfull covered the song in 1965 on her eponymous album. Vince Guaraldi covered the song on \"Live at El Matador\" in 1966 with Bola Sete. Dennis Tufano and Carl Giammarese covered this song on their first duo album \"Tufano & Giammarese\" in the early 1970s after the breakup of their previous band, the Buckinghams. This song was covered by the Lost Dogs on their 1993 album, \"Little Red Riding Hood\". In 2004 the Punkles did a cover of this song on their third album \"Pistol\". The bands Sum 41 and Eels have also covered it live in concert, the latter releasing it on \"Sixteen Tons (Ten Songs)\". Doug Kershaw covered the song on his 1977 album \"Flip, Flop, and Fly\". The Buckinghams covered the song on their 1997 album \"Places in Five\". Shaun Micallef and the cast of 'Shaun Micallef's MAD AS HELL' also covered this song for the closing credits of the show broadcast on Wednesday 27 March 2013.\n\nIn 2016 James Corden sang a version of this in Beat Bugs as Morgs the Stick Bug.\n"}

The route of the North Shore Line utilized a combination of private rights-of-way and street running as well as trackage rights over the Chicago \"L\" network. In addition to operating passenger and freight trains, the company also provided streetcar and motor bus services throughout its history.\n\nOriginating in 1895 as an electric street railway in the city of Waukegan, the property was gradually transformed into what author and railroad historian William D. Middleton described as a \"super interurban\". After a two-decade period of expansion, the nascent interurban was acquired in 1916 by business magnate Samuel Insull, who proceeded to reorganize the company and invest large amounts of capital into improving rail operations. During the \"Roaring Twenties\" the North Shore Line received industry recognition for its quality of service, and in 1941 the company debuted its streamlined \"Electroliner\" trains. After the Second World War, declines in ridership led to increasing financial losses, and despite protracted legal opposition from the remaining riders, the North Shore Line ceased all rail operations in 1963. Middleton would subsequently opine that this abandonment marked the end of the \"interurban era\" in the United States.\n\nSeveral examples of North Shore Line rolling stock are preserved in railroad museums or private collections, and the former Dempster Street Station is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Since 1964, the Chicago Transit Authority has operated the Yellow Line service over a short segment of the former main line.\n\nThe North Shore Line of 1916 consisted of a main line whose southern terminus was at Church Street in Evanston, Illinois, somewhat north of the Chicago city limits. The line continued north through Chicago's wealthy north shore communities along Lake Michigan – Wilmette, Kenilworth, Winnetka, Glencoe, and Highland Park. The line continued through Highwood, location of the railroad's headquarters and main shops, and continued through Lake Forest, Lake Bluff, North Chicago, and Waukegan. From Waukegan, the line traversed Zion before entering Wisconsin and tapping Kenosha and Racine, finally reaching its northern terminus in Milwaukee. The entire main line in Illinois was double track, but pockets of single track remained in Wisconsin. While some of the line ran through city streets, most was on private right-of-way which, along with the paralleling line of the Chicago and North Western Railway bisected the business districts of the north shore communities as far north as Lake Bluff. There were some stretches of track where the train would reach a speed of 90 mph.\n\nAt Lake Bluff, a branch diverged to the west to serve Libertyville and Area, now Mundelein. At North Chicago Junction, a branch led to downtown Waukegan via city streets.\n\nIn the early 1890s the city of Waukegan granted a franchise to the Waukegan & North Shore Rapid Transit Company for the construction and operation of a local street railway, but this initial effort was thwarted by the Panic of 1893. At this time, the Chicago & North Western Railway was the sole provider of passenger rail service to the North Shore region, but residents reportedly desired the construction of \"a new surface or elevated road\" to provide an alternative to the steam-powered North Western service.\n\nOn July 3, 1894, local businessmen Dewitt L. Jones, S. D. Talcott and Charles Whitney founded the Bluff City Electric Street Railway Company, and on April 15 the following year the Bluff City Electric received a franchise to begin construction. Revenue service began on May 30, 1895, initially provided by two single-truck streetcars. Shortly thereafter, the company began a program of expansion that would continue over the following two decades. On May 12, 1898, Bluff City Electric was acquired by the newly incorporated Chicago & Milwaukee Electric Railway Company, putting it under the control of businessmen George A. Ball and A. C. Frost. The new corporate identity of the railroad reflected its ultimate goals for expansion. The Chicago & Milwaukee Electric upgraded its facilities and purchased new rolling stock. By fall of that year, the railroad's electrification system had been modernized by electrical engineer Bion J. Arnold. In August 1899 the Chicago & Milwaukee Electric had reached the city of Evanston, constructing a southern terminus at Church Street. From Church Street, passengers could transfer to the Chicago & Evanston Line of the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway. With a rudimentary connection from Waukegan to Chicago then complete, the railroad turned its attention to the north.\n\nThe original arrangement at the railroad's southern terminus in Evanston was for Chicago-bound passengers to transfer to the Northwestern Elevated (one \"L\" company) there. Following the railroad's acquisition by Samuel Insull, limited-stop North Shore Line trains began connecting with special \"L\" trains (also controlled by Insull) that ran express to the Chicago Loop. In 1919, the North Shore Line obtained trackage rights over the Northwestern Elevated and modified their cars with third rail equipment, giving them direct access to the Loop. The following year, a new terminal in Milwaukee was dedicated, and in succeeding years, the remaining single-track in Wisconsin was eliminated, with the exception of a one-half-mile stretch of single-track in southern Milwaukee that remained a minor bottleneck until the railroad's end.\n\nDuring the early 1920s, the railroad instituted a number of named, limited-stop trains, some carrying deluxe dining and parlor/observation cars. One of the railroad's most distinctive named trains, inaugurated in 1917, was the \"Gold Coast Limited\". The North Shore also created a network of motor coach (bus) lines to feed on potential traffic from territory not directly served by the company's trains.\n\nThe growth of the north shore communities provided good traffic levels for the railroad, but the increasing congestion of these communities' business districts impeded the railroad's desire to remain competitive with the competing steam railroads for longer-haul passenger business, in particular the Chicago-Milwaukee traffic. The North Shore therefore sought to build a new bypass line through the Skokie Valley – what was then undeveloped rural land approximately four to five miles west of the lake shore route.\n\nThe needed real estate purchases and financing were arranged in 1923 and 1924, and construction of the new line began in April 1924. The new line diverged from the Howard Street \"L\" station located at the boundary between Chicago and Evanston, ran west into the village of Niles Center (now Skokie), continuing to the north-northwest from that point through marshy countryside, paralleling the Skokie branch of the Chicago and North Western Railway. At South Upton, the new route ran eastward along the North Shore's Mundelein branch until just west of Lake Bluff, at which point a new connection diverged to the north onto what had been a freight-only branch which connected to the original main line at North Chicago Junction.\n\nAn arrangement was made with the Chicago Rapid Transit Company, wherein local \"L\" service was begun over the new line to the Dempster Street station in Niles Center in 1925. It had been anticipated that the opening of the new \"L\" line would help launch a real estate boom in the area as it had decades earlier in other parts of the Chicago area. The Great Depression put a damper on the area's growth, and Niles Center (by that time renamed Skokie) didn't really begin to experience a surge of growth until the 1950s.\n\nThough the Niles Center elevated service failed to prosper, the transit operator benefited from the construction of new shop facilities on vacant land along the southern part of the Skokie Valley line. This spacious facility relieved older, more crowded facilities on the \"L\" system and remains to this day as the Chicago Transit Authority's primary maintenance facility for its rail system.\n\nThe remaining portion of the North Shore Line's new Skokie Valley line entered service in 1926. The new route consisted of of new double-track railroad, and the route was a mere longer than the old main line. Because it traversed mostly rural area, higher speeds could be sustained for a longer distance. In conjunction with the completion of the Skokie Valley route, the railroad had improved the Mundelein branch, building a new terminal and double-tracking the branch. Mundelein had previously been served by shuttle service connecting with main line trains at Lake Bluff; with the opening of the new Skokie Valley line on June 5, 1926, North Shore inaugurated an hourly Chicago-Mundelein local suburban service, interspersed with the hourly Chicago-Milwaukee limited-stop trains. Diversion of the Chicago-Milwaukee service onto the Skokie Valley line brought a reduction in travel time of 20 minutes.\n\nThe original main line – now designated by the railroad as the Shore Line – continued to host Chicago-Waukegan service, which consisted of limited-stop Chicago-Waukegan service as well as all-stop local service, each operating at roughly 30-minute headways.\n\nInitially after the stock market crash in 1929, business went on as usual, but as the depression deepened and as the Insull public utility empire began to crumble, the railroad entered receivership in 1932. The dire economic conditions and high unemployment caused ridership (and hence revenue) to plummet. A labor strike in 1938 precipitated by a 15% reduction in wages kept the railroad from operating for seven weeks.\n\nIn spite of the difficult conditions during the 1930s, the North Shore was able to undertake a major grade separation project along the Shore Line. The North Shore had for nearly a quarter century sought to eliminate the hazards and operating costs associated with running a busy railroad through the business districts of one built-up suburb after another. Prior to the Depression, grade separation projects had been funded by the railroads' private capital, and neither the North Shore Line nor the paralleling steam-operated Chicago and North Western Railway were in a financial position to undertake such a venture even before the stock market crash in 1929.\n\nHowever, in 1937 President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his Secretary of the Interior, Harold Ickes (a Winnetka resident), announced a Public Works Administration program to \"prime the pump\" of the American economy. This timely program allowed the railroads and the communities of Winnetka and Glencoe to obtain federal funding for the grade separation of the two railroads through their business districts. The project was complicated by the need for construction work to take place under traffic – the two railroads combined operated more than 200 daily trains. The grade separation was completed in late 1941 – just nine weeks before the United States went to war – and cost $4.3 million.\n\nTo meet the competition of modern streamlined trains operating on the steam railroads connecting Chicago and Milwaukee, the North Shore in 1939 embarked on a program to modernize a portion of its steel coach fleet for both commuter and intercity service. Some 15 coaches dating from 1928 were modernized, practically from the ground up. All-electric heating was installed with a new ventilation system, new flooring, new interior decorations and fittings. The cars' exteriors were painted green with gray and red trim, and were dubbed \"Greenliners\". These cars were regularly assigned to Skokie Valley limited-stop service.\nThe most significant component of the passenger equipment modernization program was the purchase of two articulated streamlined trainsets. The trainsets consisted of four cars semi-permanently attached. The two end units included operating cabs and smoking and non-smoking coach seating. An additional car provided more coach seating, and the tavern/lounge car rounded out the four-car consist. These trains were dubbed \"Electroliners\" and were the railroad's premiere service run as fast as 90 mph between Dempster Street and North Chicago Junction on the North Shore's excellent track and roadbed. Entering service on February 9, 1941, each trainset was scheduled to run five one-way trips in Chicago-Milwaukee service every day. The \"Electroliners\" continued in service until the end of the railroad's operation in 1963. The Electroliners were sold to the Philadelphia Suburban Transportation Company and were renamed Liberty Liners and run between 69th Street Philadelphia and Norristown. The Liberty Liners were retired around 1979.\n\nThe outbreak of World War II caused the railroads of the United States to see a sharp rise in traffic. Even before the imposition of rationing of fuel and rubber made auto travel difficult, the North Shore saw its freight and passenger traffic rise to record levels, in part due to the railroad serving important military facilities: the Army's Fort Sheridan just north of Highwood, and the Navy's Great Lakes Naval Training Station, just south of North Chicago. North Shore saw its traffic increase to the extent that the railroad was forced to borrow equipment from the Chicago Rapid Transit Company and fellow interurban Chicago Aurora and Elgin Railroad, both former Insull properties.\n\nWartime earnings were high enough that the railroad's bankruptcy trustees were able to pay some of the company's outstanding debt and submit a reorganization plan. After the plan was approved, a new corporation (with a different corporate name from before) assumed the property in 1946.\n\nThe failure to resolve a wage dispute taken to the National Mediation Board in 1948 led to a 91-day work stoppage that spring. The dispute was resolved by increasing both fares and wages, though the company's employees continued to earn less than their counterparts at other area railroads. Simultaneously, a decline in rail travel began as initial postwar shortages of automobiles ended. These national trends—coupled with the lost revenue from the three-month strike and the effects of the strike-settling wage increase—created serious passenger revenue losses for the line. In 1949, the railroad sought to curtail some of its more unprofitable services. Dining car service (other than that on the \"Electroliners\") was dropped, service (particularly on the Shore Line) was reduced, and the railroad applied unsuccessfully to drop Shore Line service altogether.\n\nWhen the franchise held by the North Shore subsidiary operating streetcar service in Waukegan expired in 1947, the company felt that a renewal was not justified, the company replaced its city operations there with bus service. Shore Line trains that used the streetcar tracks to reach downtown Waukegan were simultaneously cut back to allow the tracks to be abandoned. The subsidiary city streetcar service in Milwaukee was discontinued in 1951 but the tracks remained, as they was used by main line services to access the North Shore's Milwaukee terminal.\n\nRight-of-way and trackage between Leland Avenue in Chicago and Linden Avenue in Wilmette was sold to the CTA in 1953, though the Shore Line continued to operate. In turn, the railroad received $7 million USD in CTA revenue bonds.\n\nThe railroad repeated its petition to abandon the Shore Line in 1954. Though rush hour traffic levels remained strong, off-peak ridership had declined sharply, leading to further losses. The remaining street running and numerous stops eliminated many of the advantages of rail transportation on this route. Travel time on the Shore Line was roughly twice that of the slightly longer Skokie Valley route. The completion of the Edens Expressway through the Skokie Valley in late 1951 caused mounting ridership losses reflected on the railroad's earnings statements. Though the abandonment proceedings garnered strong opposition in the communities affected, the railroad was successful in proving its case and was authorized to end service on the Shore Line. July 24, 1955 was the final day of service on that route. A short portion of the line was retained to provide access from North Chicago Junction to the railroad's shops in Highwood. The rest of the line north of Linden Avenue in Wilmette was removed, much of the right-of-way becoming automobile parking spaces for commuters who switched to the suburban trains of the parallel C&NW North Line.\n\nWith its transportation holdings proving increasingly unprofitable, the Susquehanna Corporation, a Delaware-based holding corporation formed after a 1953 reorganization, moved to cut its losses; in 1958, the railroad filed with state and federal regulatory authorities for the authority to discontinue all service and abandon the entire property. The Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) examiner handling the case recommended abandonment, but the Illinois regulators recommended the continued operation of the railroad. For the time being, ridership remained fairly stable, but the completion of the Northwest Expressway (now the Kennedy Expressway) in late 1960 provided a link between the Edens Expressway and the Chicago Loop. The North Shore Line's passenger traffic began to hemorrhage at the rate of 46,000 passengers per month.\n\nThe Chicago Transit Authority researched the possibility of continuing truncated rail service between Waukegan and Howard Street in Chicago, with buses assuming operations between Lake Bluff and Mundelein. The report, released that October, revealed that passenger service had dropped to an average of 14,000 daily riders, and that the line was in dire need of modernization. The report recommended that the CTA only assume operations under the conditions that the acquisition of the railroad's property and modernization of the fleet could be achieved without cost to the agency, and an operational subsidy would be provided. In February 1961, an updated study was released, revealing that patronage had become even lighter than it had been when the initial study was conducted. Ultimately, no action was taken as a result of the study, as none of the recommended conditions could be met.\n\nThat February, the railroad requested expedited action by the ICC on its abandonment petition, citing its mounting losses. On May 17, 1962, the request was approved under the condition that no buyer stepped forward within 35 days. Both the Illinois regulators and an association of commuters opposed the action, the association offering to buy the railroad at salvage value but ultimately failing to raise sufficient funds to buy the property. That November, the state of Illinois ruled in favor of the ICC, and prevented the commuters association from having the abandonment postponed any further. The last full day of service came on January 20, 1963, with the final trains reaching their destination in the early hours of the following morning. Sporadic freight movements continued into the next week, as the remaining cars on the line were collected from various points on the system.\n\nMost of the rails were removed in the succeeding two years. The Chicago Transit Authority purchased the southernmost portion of the Skokie Valley line between Howard Street and Dempster Street, Skokie, and in early 1964 obtained federal funding for what turned out to be a successful mass transportation pilot project, dubbing the new non-stop service as the \"Skokie Swift.\" That same year, the Skokie Valley Transportation Council was formed by the towns of Glenview, Northbrook, Northfield and Skokie, with the goal of reviving rail service by funding an extension of the \"Skokie Swift\" further north. This was prevented, however, by the sale of the trackage between Dempster Street and Lake-Cook Road to the Chicago & North Western Railway for use as a freight line. The Union Pacific (into which the North Western was merged in 1995) continued to operate the line until 2001, and it was dismantled in 2004–05. CTA is studying possible extension of the Yellow Line along the North Shore right-of-way as far as Old Orchard Road, opposite the Old Orchard shopping center.\n\nAmtrak's Hiawatha Service currently serves the passenger rail market between Chicago and Milwaukee. Metra Union Pacific / North Line commuter trains serve the market between Chicago and Kenosha, Wisconsin. Also, Metra's Milwaukee District / North Line and North Central Service now serve Libertyville and Mundelein, respectively.\n\nThe former North Shore right-of-way from the Illinois border to Milwaukee was sold off piecemeal to numerous private interests. In Illinois, extension to the Skokie Swift into the now-fully-developed territory in the Skokie Valley is discussed periodically. In other places, parts of the North Shore right of way have been turned into paved and limestone recreational trails, such as the Green Bay Trail, as part of the rails to trails program.\n\nElectroliner trainset 801–802 is preserved at the Illinois Railway Museum in Union, Illinois; the museum's holdings also include 15 other passenger and freight cars from the railroad. Both Electroliners saw use on SEPTA's Norristown High Speed Line in Pennsylvania from 1964 to 1980 before being retired. The other Electroliner set, former 803–804, still painted in SEPTA \"Liberty Liner\" colors, is stored at the Rockhill Trolley Museum in Rockhill Furnace, Pennsylvania. Other museums that have North Shore Line cars preserved include the Fox River Trolley Museum, in South Elgin, Illinois; the East Troy Electric Railroad Museum in East Troy, Wisconsin; the Shore Line Trolley Museum, in East Haven, Connecticut, and the Seashore Trolley Museum, in Kennebunkport, Maine. The Iowa Terminal Railroad, in Mason City, Iowa, also owns former North Shore Line equipment. Unrestored North Shore Line equipment is also in storage at several other museums.\n\nThe Dempster station has been preserved, although moved 150 feet to the east. Both the Briargate and Kenosha stations also survive, currently housing commercial operations.\n\nAbandoned and overgrown sections of track exist between Dempster Street and Lake Cook Road in the former Skokie Valley right of way.\n\n\n"}

It has an estimated mass of around 36 solar masses and an estimated variable luminosity of around two million times that of the Sun. It is highly luminous but is invisible from the Solar System at visual wavelengths because less than one billionth of its visible light reaches us.\n\nWhen first discovered, LBV 1806-20 was considered both the most luminous and most massive star known, challenging our understanding of the formation of massive stars. Recent estimates place it somewhat nearer to Earth, which when combined with its binary nature mean that it is now well within the expected range of parameters for extremely luminous stars in the galaxy. It is estimated at 2 million times as luminous as the sun which makes it one of the most luminous stars in the galaxy.\nLBV 1806-20 lies at the core of radio nebula G10.0–0.3, which is believed to be primarily powered by its stellar wind. It is a member of the 1806-20 open cluster, itself a component of W31, one of the largest H II regions in the Milky Way. Cluster 1806-20 is made up of some highly unusual stars, including four Wolf–Rayet stars, several OB stars, and a magnetar (SGR 1806-20).\n\nThe spectral type of LBV 1806-20 is uncertain and possibly variable. It has been constrained to between O9 and B2 on the basis of an infrared He line equivalent width. The spectrum shows strong emission in the Paschen and Brackett series of hydrogen, but also emission lines of helium, Fe, Mg, and Na. The lines are broad and have uneven profiles, some showing P Cygni profiles. High resolution spectra show that some He absorption lines are doubled.\n\nAlthough the star is 8th magnitude at the near infrared wavelength of 2 micrometers, it is calculated to be about 35th magnitude at visible wavelengths, which is undetectable with current equipment. Intervening dust in the direction of the galactic centre absorb an estimated 29 magnitudes at visual wavelengths, and so most observations are conducted using infrared telescopes. On the basis of its luminosity and spectral type it is suspected of being an LBV, but despite the name the characteristic photometric and spectroscopic variations have not yet been observed so it remains just a candidate.\n\nTo account for the doubled He lines in its spectrum and the inconsistent mass, luminosity and age estimates, LBV 1806-20 has been proposed to be a binary. The emission lines are single, so only one star appears to have a dense stellar wind as might be expected from an LBV.\n"}

The name Περίοικοι roughly means \"those dwelling around/nearby\", deriving from περί, \"peri\", \"around\", and , \"oîkos\", \"dwelling, house\". \n\nThey had a central role in the Spartan economy, controlling commerce and business, as well as being responsible for crafts and manufacturing, including producing the weapons and armour of the Spartan Army (the Spartans considered all commercial and money-making activities to be unworthy of them). The Perioeci were also the only people allowed to freely travel outside the Spartan state's borders, which the Spartans were not, unless given permission.\n\nThe polis or city-state of Sparta was formed during the Greek Dark Ages, controlling the plains around the Eurotas river. Those communities already existing in the area which could not be assimilated into the Spartan state, or subjugated as helots, became the perioeci. Whether they were Dorians like the Spartans, or descended from pre-Dorian populations in the Peloponnese, is unknown.\n\nThe Perioeci were free, unlike the helots, but were not full Spartan citizens. They lived in their own settlements in the \"perioecis\", which were described by ancient authors as \"poleis\". These settlements were largely under the control of the Spartan state, but were self-governing on domestic issues.\n\nThe perioeci were obliged to follow Spartan foreign policy, and supplied men to fight in the Spartan army. Like the \"hómoioi\" (, full Spartan citizens), the perioeci fought in the army as hoplites, probably in the same units. The perioeci had the right to own land, which would have been necessary to support those in the army.\n\nIn the Classical period, the Spartans were not permitted to engage in any economically productive activities, and so the perioeci were responsible for Spartan manufacturing, including producing weapons and armour, as well as conducting the trade that the Spartan state needed. For instance, the large number of masks and figurines dedicated at the site of the Sanctuary of Artemis Orthia were probably produced by perioecic craftsmen.\n\nThe perioeci are mentioned in Aristotle's \"Politics\" but in a much more general sense than merely as those within the Spartan state. In describing the ideal state, Aristotle believed that the actual citizens and members of the state should be the rulers, the warriors (those who are allowed to bear arms), the statesmen and the priests but that those who perform trades, such as mechanics, craftsmen, husbandmen and farmers should be either slaves or perioeci, because such professions are ignoble and do not produce virtue, according to him. In that sense, the perioeci are meant to be common to all ideal Hellenic states, as a sort of middle class whose ranks the slaves may aspire to join, below the citizens but above slavery. They are free men, but they do not own property and are not allowed to vote, to hold office or to influence the state or the laws by any other means. When Aristotle mentions them, he sometimes refers to them as \"barbarian\" and implies that such non-citizen free men would be non-Hellenic foreigners.\n\n\n"}

The authority is responsible for the creation and granting of new coats of arms (armorial bearings), flags, and badges for Canadian citizens, government agencies, municipal, civic and other corporate bodies. The authority also registers existing armorial bearings granted by other recognized heraldic authorities, approves military badges, flags, and other insignia of the Canadian Forces, and provides information on heraldic practices.\n\nThe CHA is the Canadian counterpart of the College of Arms in London, the Court of the Lord Lyon in Scotland, and the Office of the Chief Herald of Ireland in the Republic of Ireland, and is well known for its innovative designs, many incorporating First Nations symbolism.\n\nPrior to the creation of the Canadian Heraldic Authority, Canadians wishing to obtain a legally granted coat of arms had to apply to one of the two heraldic offices in the United Kingdom: either the College of Arms in London or the Court of the Lord Lyon in Edinburgh. This process was quite lengthy—and costly. In addition, the heralds of the College of Arms and the Court of the Lord Lyon could sometimes be unfamiliar with Canadian history and symbols. In time, many Canadians with an interest in heraldry began calling for an office which would offer armorial bearings designed by and for Canadians.\n\nAs early as 1967, plans were reportedly in the works to transfer overview of heraldry from the College of Arms in the UK to Canada. The push for a wholly Canadian heraldic system came largely from the Heraldry Society of Canada (now the Royal Heraldry Society of Canada) almost from its inception, though it was not seen as a priority by successive national governments. In 1986, Vicki Huntington, a politician from British Columbia, forwarded a brief written by the RHSC calling for the creation of the Canadian Heraldic Authority to a staff member in then-Secretary of State David Crombie's office. Mr. Crombie had his department organise a meeting in Ottawa the following year, to which many national and international heraldic experts were invited. The meeting concluded with \"a strong recommendation to\ngovernment that an Authority be created.\"\n\nTwo years later, Queen Elizabeth II issued the 1988 letters patent authorising the governor general \"to exercise or provide for the exercise of all powers and authorities lawfully belonging to Us as Queen of Canada in respect of the granting of armorial bearings in Canada\". These letters patent were presented by Prince Edward to the governor general on behalf of the Crown. Subsequently, the Governor General, Jeanne Sauvé, authorised the creation of the Canadian Heraldic Authority on June 4, 1988. As a result, Canada became the first Commonwealth realm outside the United Kingdom to have its own heraldic authority. Canada also provides full equality to women in terms of inheriting and transmitting arms. Additionally, all armigers within Canada may file for trademark protection of their grant of arms under the Trade-Marks Act.\n\nThe authority is located at Rideau Hall in Ottawa, the official residence of the monarch and the governor general. The governor general, as the personal representative of the Canadian monarch, is the highest authority in Canadian heraldry. Below the governor general is the Herald Chancellor, a position held by the Secretary to the Governor General. The CHA is currently organized in an office called the Chancellery of Honours, which is the same office that issues Canadian orders and decorations, such as the Order of Canada. The deputy secretary that administers the Chancellery of Honours is also the Deputy Herald Chancellor.\n\nThe Chief Herald of Canada, whose job is to oversee and direct all operations of the CHA, bears the main responsibility of granting arms, though the governor general has the authority to grant arms directly. The position of chief herald was inaugurated by Robert Watt at the inception of the CHA in 1988 and held by him until his retirement in 2007. Since May 20, 2020, the office of chief herald has been held by Samy Khalid. \nBelow the chief herald are the Heralds of Arms, full-time workers at the CHA and considered part of the Public Service of Canada. The names of the various offices were taken from significant Canadian rivers. Though the titles are territorial designations, as per heraldic tradition, each herald serves the entire country. Each is assigned a badge of office. The Heralds of Arms are:\nThe authority also allows for two types of honorary positions: \"Heralds Emeritus\" and \"Heralds Extraordinary\". The emeritus title is reserved for Canadian heralds who have retired; the title of extraordinary is an honorary position for those who have made notable contributions to heraldry. Honorary heralds can be enlisted by the CHA to perform work for them. Each honorary position grants the individual a badge and a title also based on a Canadian river.\n\nAny Canadian citizen or corporate body can petition for a grant of new arms or registration of existing arms. In general, eligibility for a grant of arms is based on an individual's contributions to the community, although the exact criteria for grants or registrations have not been published. A number of grants have been made to people who have already been recognized with state honours for their notable achievements, such as through admission to the Order of Canada, and who are accordingly entitled to a grant of arms. Those who are Companions of the order may also request the chief herald to grant them supporters.\n\nIn order to request either a coat of arms, flag, and/or badges, a letter must be addressed to the Chief Herald of Canada. The letter must clearly ask \"to receive armorial bearings from the Canadian Crown under the powers exercised by the Governor General\" and include proof of Canadian citizenship or permanent residence as well as a biography or curriculum vitae of the petitioner. Corporate petitions must include a brief history of the company, proof of incorporation in Canada, financial reports, and a copy of the corporation's governing body resolution seeking a grant of arms.\n\nThe Chief Herald of Canada can approve or reject the petition. If the petition is approved, the authority to make the grant is given through a warrant signed by the Herald Chancellor or the Deputy Herald Chancellor. The authorisation is then sent to one of the heralds, and the process begins. The granting of arms is regarded as an honour from the monarch, via the governor general, and thus are bestowed only on those whom the Chief Herald has deemed individuals worthy of receiving a grant of arms.\n\nFirst, the assigned herald develops a written description based on consultation with the petitioner. The petitioner then signs a contract with an artist at the authority to create the design. The Fraser Herald, serving as the CHA's principal artist, must review the design. At all stages the documents must be approved by both the petitioner and the Chief Herald. The final step is to prepare the letters patent, the official notice of an award of arms, which includes a drawing of the armorial bearings and the accompanying legal text and explanation of the symbolism of the bearings. Under Canadian bilingualism laws, letters patent are written in both English and French, though the petitioner may choose which language will be placed in the left column of the document.\n\nCompleted grant documents are recorded in the Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges of Canada and the notice of the grant is published in the \"Canada Gazette\", Part I, under the section \"Government House\".\n\nThe Government of Canada requires that the above processes be financed by the petitioner; that is the person requesting the grant or registration of arms, who pays the fees associated with the request and grant/registration. The processing fee for all petitioners is CAD$435 (plus GST), with the cost of one preliminary design ranging from $200 to $1,000. The cost of the final design, as illustrated on the letters patent, ranges from $900 to $3,500. In Canada, the petitioner does not \"buy\" a coat of arms, the arms themselves are freely given to qualified individuals, but fees must be paid to the heralds and artists for the services rendered. The average time needed to complete a grant is about 12 to 14 months, though it can take longer for particularly detailed or intricate arms.\n\nThose individuals and institutions who already possess legitimate awards of arms may apply to the Canadian Heraldic Authority to have their arms registered. There is no cost associated with application for registration and it takes less time, approximately three months, than application for a new award of arms.\n\nThe \"blazon\", or technical description in heraldic language, of the full armorial bearings is below, along with its plain English description:\n\nThe current arms of the authority were confirmed in a warrant by the Governor General on 15 January 1994, in honour of the authority's fifth anniversary, which was celebrated the previous year. The full armorial bearings of the Canadian Heraldic Authority incorporate aboriginal symbolism, as seen in the mythical raven-bears, as well as the national symbol of the maple leaf and the traditional Canadian colours of red and white, which were made official by King George V in 1921.\n\nThe crest is a modification of the Royal Crest of Canada: a lion wearing a crown and bearing a maple leaf. The crest of the authority features the same lion, instead holding a white shield containing a red maple leaf, symbolising the governor general's authority under the Crown to grant armorial bearings to Canadians.\n\nThe shield itself is white with a red maple leaf, similar to the middle portion of the Canadian flag. The white shield upon the leaf represents \"a sign of heraldry to be created and recorded for Canadians.\"\n\nThe raven-bears, a new heraldic beast which combined several creatures that are important to aboriginal symbolism, were proposed by the heralds in honour of the United Nations' International Year of the World's Indigenous Peoples, also occurring in 1993. The raven-bears are standing on an outcrop of what is known as the Canadian Shield, a geological formation which the authority foundation is based on. The Canadian Shield is formed by rocks, which are covered in red coloured maple leaves and by golden maple seeds. The motto that was chosen is Latin for \"Let us honour those who honour our country\".\n\nThe shield and crest alone comprise the heraldic badge of the CHA, which is used on the seal of the Authority and on the letters patent that grant and register armorial bearings. A wreath around the shield is composed of red maple leaves bound with gold straps.\n\n\n"}

Credited to Lennon–McCartney, but written primarily by John Lennon, it was finished in the recording studio by Lennon and McCartney. The song was recorded during the filming of the \"Lady Madonna\" promotional film, and, like \"Lady Madonna\", is one of the few Beatles songs based on a piano riff. \n\nIt had a working title of \"She Can Talk To Me\". For many years, \"Hey Bulldog\" was a relatively obscure and overlooked song in the Beatles' catalogue; it has since been reappraised by fans and a number of critics and musicians as one of the band's best rockers.\n\nA few days before the recording session in 11 February 1968, Paul McCartney played drums on a Paul Jones rocker called \"The Dog Presides\", which had barking sound effects. During the Beatles recording, McCartney started to bark without warning. The next lines, initially written as \"Hey Bullfrog\" by Lennon, were changed mid-song to \"Hey Bulldog\", which became the song's title.\n\nGeoff Emerick, the Beatles' engineer, praised the Beatles' performance on the song. In his book \"Here, There and Everywhere\", he writes: \"Paul's bass line was probably the most inventive of any he'd done since \"Pepper\", and it was really well played. Harrison's solo was sparkling, tooone of the few times that he nailed it right away. His amp was turned up really loud, and he used one of his new fuzz boxes, which made his guitar absolutely scream.\"\n\nDuring these sessions, a film crew photographed the Beatles recording the song at EMI's Abbey Road studios for a promotional film to be released during their scheduled four-month retreat to India (which was later edited together as a promotional film for the single \"Lady Madonna\").\n\nThe song was used in a segment of the animated film \"Yellow Submarine\". Initially, it appeared only in some European theatrical prints. It was cut from the American version by the movie's producer Al Brodax as he and the group felt the film was too long. It was restored for the film's 1999 re-release. To promote the reissue, Apple went back to the original footage shot for the \"Lady Madonna\" promo film and restructured it for use as a promotional clip for \"Hey Bulldog\" (as it is possible to identify what they were playing, and therefore possible to synchronise the music with the original footage). The 1999 clip was included in the three-disc versions (titled \"1+\") of the Beatles' 2015 video compilation \"1\".\n\nMcCartney spoke fondly of \"Hey Bulldog\" in 1994:\n\nIn 2018, the music staff of \"Time Out London\" ranked \"Hey Bulldog\" at number 27 on their list of the best Beatles songs.\n"}

They are made of stacks of chromophorylated proteins, the phycobiliproteins, and their associated linker polypeptides. Each phycobilisome consists of a core made of allophycocyanin, from which several outwardly oriented rods made of stacked disks of phycocyanin and (if present) phycoerythrin(s) or phycoerythrocyanin. The spectral property of phycobiliproteins are mainly dictated by their prosthetic groups, which are linear tetrapyrroles known as phycobilins including phycocyanobilin, phycoerythrobilin, phycourobilin and phycobiliviolin. The spectral properties of a given phycobilin is influenced by its protein environment.\n\nEach phycobiliprotein has a specific absorption and fluorescence emission maximum in the visible range of light. Therefore, their presence and the particular arrangement within the phycobilisomes allow absorption and unidirectional transfer of light energy to chlorophyll \"a\" of the photosystem II. In this way, the cells take advantage of the available wavelengths of light (in the 500-650 nm range), which are inaccessible to chlorophyll, and utilize their energy for photosynthesis. This is particularly advantageous deeper in the water column, where light with longer wavelengths is less transmitted and therefore less available directly to chlorophyll.\n\nThe geometrical arrangement of a phycobilisome is very elegant in a antenna-like assembly. It results in 95% efficiency of energy transfer.\n\nThere are many variations to the general phycobilisomes structure. Their shape can be hemidiscoidal (in cyanobacteria) or hemiellipsoidal (in red algae). Species lacking phycoerythrin have at least two disks of phycocyanin per rod, which is sufficient for maximum photosynthesis.\n\nThe phycobiliproteins themselves show little sequence evolution due to their highly constrained function (absorption and transfer of specific wavelengths). \nIn some species of cyanobacteria, when both phycocyanin and phycoerythrin is present, the phycobilisome can undergo significant restructuring as response to light color. In green light the distal portions of the rods are made of red colored phycoerythrin, which absorbs green light better. In red light, this is replaced by blue colored phycocyanin, which absorbs red light better. This reversible process is known as complementary chromatic adaptation. It is the component of photosynthetic system of cyanobacteria, as a particle with which various structures are linked (i.e. thylakoid membrane, etc).\n\nPhycobilisomes can be used in prompt fluorescence, flow cytometry, Western blotting and protein microarrays. Some phycobilisomes have an absorption and emission profile similar to Cy5, they can be used in many of the same applications, however, they can be up to 200 times brighter, with a large Stokes shift, providing a larger signal per binding event. This property allows the detection of low-level target molecules]\\ or rare events.\n"}

This colourless liquid, a ketone, is used as a solvent for gums, resins, paints, varnishes, lacquers, and nitrocellulose.\n\nMethyl isobutyl ketone is made from acetone via a three-step process. Firstly acetone undergoes an aldol reaction to give diacetone alcohol, which readily dehydrates to give mesityl oxide. Mesityl oxide can then be hydrogenated to give MIBK:\n\nIndustrially, these three steps are combined. Acetone is treated with a strong acidic, palladium-doped cation exchange resin under medium pressure of hydrogen. Several million kilograms are produced annually. In 2003, the industrial production capacity for MIBK in the United States was 88,000 tons.\n\nMIBK is used as a solvent for nitrocellulose, lacquers, and certain polymers and resins.\n\nAnother major use is as a precursor to \"N\"-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-\"N\"'-phenyl-\"p\"-phenylene diamine (6PPD), an antiozonant used in tires. 6PPD is prepared by reductive coupling of MIBK with 4-aminodiphenylamine.\n\nUnlike the other common ketone solvents, acetone and MEK, MIBK has quite low solubility in water, making it useful for liquid-liquid extraction. It has a similar polarity to ethyl acetate, but greater stability towards aqueous acid and base. It can be used to extract gold, silver and other precious metals from cyanide solutions, such as those found at gold mines, to determine the levels of those dissolved metals. Diisobutyl ketone (DIBK), a related lipophilic ketone, is also used for this purpose. Methyl isobutyl ketone is also used as a denaturing agent for denatured alcohol. When mixed with water or isopropyl alcohol MIBK serves as a developer for PMMA electron beam lithography resist. MIBK is used as a solvent for CS in the preparation of the CS spray used currently by British police forces.\n\n"}
{"id": "2254797", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2254797", "title": "Baby, You're a Rich Man", "text": "Baby, You're a Rich Man\n\n\"Baby, You're a Rich Man\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles that was released as the B-side of their \"All You Need Is Love\" single in July 1967. It originated from an unfinished song by John Lennon, titled \"One of the Beautiful People\", to which Paul McCartney added a chorus. It is one of the best-known pop songs to feature a clavioline, a monophonic keyboard instrument that was a forerunner to the synthesizer. Lennon played the clavioline on its oboe setting, creating a sound that suggests an Indian shehnai. The song was recorded and mixed at Olympic Sound Studios in London, making it the first of the Beatles' EMI recordings to be entirely created outside EMI Studios.\n\nLennon wrote his portion of the song after attending the 14 Hour Technicolor Dream, an all-night festival held at London's Alexandra Palace that served as a key event in the emergence of the counterculture in the UK. His lyrics address the \"beautiful people\" of the 1960s hippie movement and combine with the chorus to present a statement on the universality of non-material wealth. The lyrics have also invited interpretation as a message to the Beatles' manager, Brian Epstein, and alternatively as a comment on fame. George Harrison performed the song during his visit to San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury district in August 1967, at the height of the Summer of Love. The track later appeared on the Beatles' \"Magical Mystery Tour\" album and in a sequence in their 1968 animated film \"Yellow Submarine\".\n\n\"Baby, You're a Rich Man\" peaked at number 34 on America's \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart. Among reviewers' varied comments on the song, \"Billboard\" admired it as \"an Eastern-flavored rocker with an infectious beat and an intricate lyric\", while \"Pitchfork\" has dismissed it as \"a second-rate take on John Lennon's money-isn't-everything theme\". In 2010, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked \"Baby, You're a Rich Man\" at number 68 on its list of the \"100 Greatest Beatles Songs\". The Fat Boys, Kula Shaker and the Presidents of the United States of America are among the artists who have covered the song. The Beatles recording was used at the end of the 2010 film \"The Social Network\", about the rise of Facebook.\n\n\"Baby, You're a Rich Man\" was the result of combining two unfinished songs written by Lennon and McCartney, in a similar fashion to \"A Day in the Life\" and \"I've Got a Feeling\". The working title, based on Lennon's verses, was \"One of the Beautiful People\", to which McCartney added the \"Baby, you're a rich man\" chorus. In a 1980 interview, Lennon described it as \"two separate pieces ... forced into one song\". The two songwriters worked on the composition at McCartney's London home, on Cavendish Avenue in St John's Wood.\n\nDuring the 1960s, \"beautiful people\" was the term adopted by Californian hippies to refer to themselves. According to author Barry Miles, who was among the leading figures in the UK underground in 1967, Lennon drew inspiration for the song from newspaper articles on the emerging hippie phenomenon. It is thought that McCartney wrote his section about the band's manager, Brian Epstein. Lennon's lyrics are in the form of a question-and-answer exchange, similar to that used by him and McCartney in \"With a Little Help from My Friends\". Musicologist Walter Everett writes that the song \"asks an unnamed Brian Epstein what it's like to be one of the 'beautiful people'\"; Everett adds: \"This appellation was used of both communal hippies and those who mingle with the most celebrated entertainers.\" Lennon claimed that the meaning of the song was that everybody is a rich man, saying, \"The point was stop moaning. You're a rich man and we're all rich men.\" George Harrison said the message was that all individuals are wealthy within themselves, regardless of material concerns.\n\nAccording to author and critic Ian MacDonald, Lennon was most likely inspired to write the verses after attending the 14 Hour Technicolor Dream, an all-night festival held at Alexandra Palace in north London on 29 April 1967. Attended by 10,000 people,<ref name=\"Cushley/Dream\">Cushley, Joe. \"Dream On!\". In: .</ref> this musical and performance art event was a fundraiser for the proprietors of the underground newspaper \"International Times\", after a police raid had forced the closure of their offices; in MacDonald's description, it marked the first large-scale coming together of Britain's \"beautiful people\". Writing in 1981 on the musical and societal developments of 1967, sociomusicologist Simon Frith said that this event was one of the \"multi-media happenings\" that reflected the new aesthetic represented by English psychedelia, whereby \"Dancing became less important than listening\" and fashion embraced vivid colours while retaining \"the mod concern for looking smart\". Frith added: \"Psychedelia was essentially elitist but the joy of psychedelic pop was that it made everyone part of the elite.\"\n\nThe song's principal key is G major in Mixolydian mode, and the time signature throughout is 4/4. Its structure comprises an intro, two verses and a chorus, followed by a third verse and repeated choruses. From its opening chord of G major, the verses introduce a VII/I (F/G), a chord change that constitutes a pedal point on G (sustained harmonic tone) and so recalls some of the Beatles' Indian-inspired melodies from \"Revolver\". Among musicologists, Everett says that from the seventh bar of the verse, C major is revealed as the true key, whereas Alan Pollack writes that the emphasis given to C major at the end of the musical phrases instead suggests \"a perilously high center of gravity with respect to G being the home key\". The Indian influence is heightened on the band's recording of the song through the use of gamak melodies in the accompaniment. Pollack considers a notable feature in the chorus to be the bass move from C to G via a III (B). According to MacDonald, the song's loose, swinging rhythm, which he describes as \"chugging pseudo-march\", suggests the influence of the Four Tops' 1966 hit single \"Reach Out I'll Be There\".\n\nAuthor and critic Kenneth Womack comments that the lyrics appear to \"address issues of wealth and celebrity\" for listeners unfamiliar with the countercultural concept of \"beautiful people\". The song reflects the Beatles' disdain for consumerism and materialism, a theme that, inspired by the band members' use of the hallucinogenic drug LSD, they introduced in the lyrics to \"Revolver\" tracks such as \"And Your Bird Can Sing\". Authors Russell Reising and Jim LeBlanc highlight the lines \"You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside a zoo / What a thing to do\" as particularly dismissive of the acquisition and hoarding of material wealth. The same authors recognise an element of ridicule towards some of the \"beautiful people\", specifically those that, in Lennon's words, travel no further than \"As far as the eye can see\" and, even then, see \"Nothing that doesn't show\". Music critic Tim Riley identifies a droll quality in the answers that Lennon provides to his own questions. With regard to the song's message, he writes: \"It's clear that they understand their position: if the Beatles are beautiful people, by extension their listeners become beautiful people ('Baby, you're a rich man, too').\"\n\nThe recording of \"Baby, You're a Rich Man\" took place during a period when, free of deadlines following the completion of their album \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" in April 1967, the Beatles worked on songs for the United Artists animated film \"Yellow Submarine\" and for what became the band's television film \"Magical Mystery Tour\". They recorded \"Baby, You're a Rich Man\" in a six-hour session, starting at 9 pm on 11 May, at Olympic Sound Studios in Barnes, south-west London. The session marked a rare example of the Beatles recording outside of EMI's facility at Abbey Road, after the band had briefly used Regent Sound in central London during the sessions for \"Sgt. Pepper\". The engineers assisting George Martin, the Beatles' producer, were Olympic manager Keith Grant and Eddie Kramer. Mick Jagger, whose band the Rolling Stones regularly used the same studio, also attended the session.\n\nThe song was mixed, in mono only, that same day. The music features an unusual oboe-like sound reminiscent of an Indian shehnai, which was created with a clavioline, an early, three-octave forerunner of the synthesizer. Being a monophonic keyboard, it was capable of sounding only one note at a time; according to music journalist Gordon Reid, citing a report from the session, Lennon created the trill sound \"by rolling an orange up and down the keyboard\" of the clavioline.<ref name=\"Reid/SoS\"></ref> Musicologist William Echard cites the clavioline part as an example of a psychedelic feature he calls a \"garble line\" – a musical part that \"often meanders widely through pitch space, following a rhythmic profile that does not adhere strongly to the prevailing harmonic or melodic logic\" – with \"Orientalist connotations\". A feed back delay effect known as spin-echo was used to fill from the end of one line of the verse to the start of the next. After Lennon had played piano on the basic track, McCartney overdubbed a second part, which enters at 1:45 and is heard in reverse over the third verse. In its doubling of the vocal line, Harrison's lead guitar mirrors the role of a sarangi in an Indian khyal vocal piece, an effect that Harrison first used on Lennon's song \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\".\n\nFollowing the completion of \"Sgt. Pepper\" in late April 1967, the Beatles' recording sessions for the remainder of that year have been dismissed as uninspired by the majority of commentators. Kramer contests this view, however; he says of the Beatles' collaboration on \"Baby, You're a Rich Man\": \"The energy level was so intense … that you were riding wave upon wave of amazing creativity. It was like watching a well-oiled machine. Just \"incredible\".\"<ref name=\"Harris/Mojo\"></ref> According to another Olympic staff engineer, Grant and Kramer were highly complimentary of Lennon as a vocalist and \"couldn't believe anyone could sing that well\". Aside from the clavioline part, overdubs on the track included maracas and tambourine, and vibraphone played by Kramer. Only a single note of the vibraphone is clearly audible throughout the track, at the 0:53 mark. McCartney recalled the six-hour session as an energetic one and \"rather exciting\", adding: \"Keith Grant mixed it, instantly, right there. He stood up at the console as he mixed it, so it was a very exciting mix, we were really quite buzzed.\"\n\nDuring the session, Lennon changed a line in the chorus to \"Baby, you're a rich fag jew\". According to author Bob Spitz, this was either a joke at the expense of Epstein or a provocation in reaction to the band's former moptop image. Spitz writes that the session tapes also reveal Lennon improvising similarly \"wicked\" remarks about McCartney, Ringo Starr and Jagger. Partly as a result of these disruptions, the Beatles required twelve takes before they achieved a satisfactory rhythm track. The group enjoyed working at Olympic Sound, which was an independent facility, free of record company control. They returned to Barnes on 14 June to record the basic track for \"All You Need Is Love\".\n\"Baby, You're a Rich Man\" was initially submitted for inclusion in \"Yellow Submarine\". While the song was used in the film (albeit briefly), its initial release was as the B-side of \"All You Need Is Love\", which the Beatles performed on the \"Our World\" satellite broadcast on 25 June 1967 and then rush-released as a single.<ref name=\"Edwards/RS\"></ref> The release took place on 7 July in the United Kingdom and on 17 July in the United States. \"All You Need Is Love\" topped singles charts in many countries around the world. In the United States, the B-side also charted in its own right, peaking at number 34 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and number 60 on the \"Cash Box\" Top 100. In Australia, it was listed with \"All You Need Is Love\", as a double A-side, when the single topped the \"Go-Set\" national chart.\nThe single followed soon after \"Sgt. Pepper\", which historian David Simonelli describes as \"the most important cultural moment of 1967\" through its resonance \"across every boundary of class, age, gender, race and geography\". Both records provided a soundtrack to that year's Summer of Love, a phenomenon that marked the full emergence of the 1960s counterculture. The Beatles were viewed as leaders of the counterculture and, during July and August, pursued interests related to the same utopian-based ideology. In a 1970 interview, when asked about Haight-Ashbury, the district of San Francisco that represented \"the city of the beautiful people\" in 1967, Lennon recalled that he was \"all for going and living\" there, but \"George went over in the end.\" During this visit, on 7 August, Harrison was handed an acoustic guitar in Golden Gate Park<ref name=\"Unterberger/Mojo\"> Available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required).</ref> and briefly performed \"Baby, You're a Rich Man\", leading a crowd around in a manner that press reports likened to the Pied Piper of Hamelin.\n\nAlthough the visit was viewed as the Beatles' endorsement of a youth movement that they helped inspire, Harrison was disappointed at how Haight-Ashbury represented a haven for dropouts and drug addicts, rather than a community looking to explore the possibility of enlightenment that LSD presented. On his return to London, he shared this disillusionment with Lennon. The pair subsequently became avid supporters of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's Transcendental Meditation technique, after the Beatles had attended a seminar by the Maharishi in Bangor, Wales, where they publicly disavowed LSD on 26 August. In light of this development, author Nicholas Schaffner wrote that \"Baby, You're a Rich Man\", like \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", revealed the \"redundant\" aspect of repeated LSD \"trips\" after the initial sense of spiritual euphoria awakened by the drug, in that the songs \"tend[ed] to provide more riddles than solutions\".\n\nAgainst the Beatles' wishes, Capitol Records, EMI's North American affiliate, included \"Baby You're a Rich Man\" and other tracks from the band's 1967 singles on the US album \"Magical Mystery Tour\", released in November that year. In the company's rush to prepare the album, a duophonic (or \"mock stereo\") mix of the song was used for the stereo version of the LP. While the song was featured in the 1968 film \"Yellow Submarine\", it was not included on the accompanying soundtrack album. The sequence for \"Baby, You're a Rich Man\" appears towards the end of the film, when Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band have been released from the paralysis initiated by the Blue Meanies' hatred of music. Later editions of the US single include a voice saying the end of the word \"Seven\" or \"Eleven\" before the track starts.\n\nWriting in the \"NME\" in July 1967, Derek Johnson commented on the song's \"modern\" qualities relative to the sing-along style of the A-side. He highlighted Lennon's falsetto singing, the recording's \"Oriental instrumentation and … unusual shuffle beat, emphasised by handclaps\", and concluded: \"The whole effect is startling and packed with interest from the word go.\" \"Billboard\"s reviewer described it as \"an Eastern-flavored rocker with an infectious beat and an intricate lyric\". In one of the first cultural essays to acknowledge the Beatles' impact on American culture in a meaningful way, for the journal \"Partisan Review\", Richard Poirier cited both sides of the single as a \"particularly brilliant example\" of how contemporary British rock bands had \"restor[ed] to good standing ... the simplicities that have frightened us into irony and the search for irony\". He described the musical backing on \"Baby, You're a Rich Man\" as \"bursts of sitar music and the clip-clopping of Indian song\", which combined to \"operate in the manner of classical allusion in Pope\", and he admired the lyrics' satirical quality, saying that they were superior to Lennon's Edward Lear-inspired poetry writing.\nIn his feature article on the clavioline for \"Sound on Sound\" magazine, Gordon Reid pairs the song with the Tornados' 1962 hit \"Telstar\" as the two seminal pop recordings made with the instrument. In his assessment of \"Baby, You're a Rich Man\", Ian MacDonald welcomes the use of clavioline, saying that it evokes \"a beguiling joss-stick exoticism\", and he praises Starr's drumming as the equal of his performance on the song \"Rain\". MacDonald bemoans the lack of focus evident in this and other Beatles recordings from the immediate post-\"Sgt. Pepper\" period, however; he says that, while \"Baby, You're a Rich Man\" demonstrates the band's command of musical \"feel\" and \"black-white acid-dance fusion\" a year ahead of the Rolling Stones, McCartney's choruses are weak and, overall, the song is devoid of \"well-crafted music\". Tim Riley says that the July 1967 single offers two pieces that are \"Not such bad notions in themselves, except that they sound spent.\" Riley criticises the song's lyrics as \"lacking in purpose\" and says that, although the \"snake-charming Clavioline\" provides a degree of interest, \"There's no center to this music … 'Help!' and 'Drive My Car' addressed the fallacies of fame from cynical impulses; 'Baby, You're a Rich Man' flounders in privileged emptiness.\"\n\nWriting for \"Mojo\" in 2003, Martin O'Gorman paired \"Baby, You're a Rich Man\" with Harrison \"It's All Too Much\" as two of the Beatles' \"most sonically intriguing, but unfocused tracks\". In a 2009 review of \"Magical Mystery Tour\", Scott Plagenhoef of Pitchfork Media dismissed the song as \"a second-rate take on John Lennon's money-isn't-everything theme from the considerably stronger 'And Your Bird Can Sing'\". He added that it was \"the one lesser moment on an otherwise massively rewarding [album]\".<ref name=\"Plagenhoef/PM\"></ref> Dan Caffrey of Consequence of Sound writes that, while it lacks the wholly universal scope of other songs by the band, \"it's a nice little Lennon morality ditty on the perils of materialism with some innovative work with the clavioline from Lennon.\" Music critic Jim DeRogatis considers the track to be one of the Beatles' best psychedelic rock songs and an effective comment on Britain's first major countercultural happening. In 2010, \"Baby, You're a Rich Man\" was ranked at number 68 in \"Rolling Stone\"'s list of the 100 greatest Beatles songs. The magazine's editors wrote: \"Lennon's deeply stoned delivery and abstract questions about 'the beautiful people' captured the playfully spaced-out mood of the summer of 1967 – a spirit the Beatles were more tapped into than anyone.\"\nGeorge Martin and recording engineer Geoff Emerick created the first true stereo mix of the song when preparing a 1971 German release of the \"Magical Mystery Tour\" album. Unable to recreate the spin-echo effect that had been introduced at the mixing stage of the original recording, they simply omitted it. The mix was completed on 22 October 1971. It was first made available in Britain in December 1981, when \"Baby, You're a Rich Man\" was included on a bonus EP containing previously unissued stereo mixes in the box set \"The Beatles EP Collection\".\n\n\"Baby, You're a Rich Man\" was mixed in stereo for a second time for the 1999 DVD release of the \"Yellow Submarine\" film and the accompanying \"Yellow Submarine Songtrack\" album. Portions of Lennon's clavioline part appear in the \"Love\" version of \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\", released in 2006. Elements of \"Baby, You're a Rich Man\" also appear in the remix of \"All You Need Is Love\", which closes the \"Love\" album. In 2009, remastered stereo and mono \"Magical Mystery Tour\" CDs were released.\n\nThe Beatles' recording plays at the end of \"The Social Network\", a 2010 film directed by David Fincher about the rise of Facebook and its co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg (played by Jesse Eisenberg). Noel Murray and Matt Singer of \"The Dissolve\" include this appearance among the five most effective uses of a Beatles song in a feature film, describing it as the \"perfect musical summation for \"The Social Network\"\". According to Inkoo Kang of \"Slate\" magazine, the Beatles \"sing-taunt\" Zuckerberg with the song's chorus;<ref name=\"Kang/Slate\"></ref> in Murray and Singer's description, \"Baby, You're a Rich Man\" appears to \"ask Zuckerberg all of our questions about what he's done\", after he has developed Facebook into a billion-dollar company and, in the final scene, \"sits triumphant – and totally alone\".\n\nAmerican rappers the Fat Boys covered \"Baby, You're a Rich Man\" and performed it in the 1987 comedy film \"Disorderlies\". Hip-hop duo P.M. Dawn incorporated the \"How does it feel to be one of the beautiful people?\" line into their song \"The Beautiful\", from the 1991 album \"\". They also replicated part of the music from \"Baby, You're a Rich Man\" in their track, having been denied permission to sample the Beatles' version. The song has also been covered by Kula Shaker, the Presidents of the United States of America and Umphrey's McGee.\n\nAccording to Mark Lewisohn and Ian MacDonald:\n\nThe Beatles\n\nAdditional musicians\n\n"}
{"id": "2254799", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2254799", "title": "Smiths Group", "text": "Smiths Group\n\nSmiths Group plc () is a British multinational diversified engineering business headquartered in London, United Kingdom. It has operations in over 50 countries and employs around 23,550 staff. Smiths Group is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.\n\nSmiths Group has its origins in a jewellery shop, \"S Smith & Sons\", which was founded by the watchmaker and businessman Samuel Smith. Supplying its precision watches to various clients, including the Admiralty, the business quickly grew and expanded into a major provider of timepieces, diamonds and automotive instrumentation. On 21 July 1914, the business became a public limited company, holding onto this status for over a hundred years. Throughout much of the twentieth century, Smiths Group was the principal supplier of instruments to the British motorcar and motorcycle industries, organising itself as \"Smiths Industries\" Ltd in 1960. During the 1980s and 1990s, the company restructured itself, disposing of its automotive division to focus on three divisions: Smiths Industrial, Smiths Medical Systems, and Smiths Aerospace and Defence. On 30 November 2000, its name was changed to \"Smiths Group\"; it merged with specialised engineering firm TI Group that same year.\n\nPresently, Smiths Group has five divisions. Smiths Detection is the world's largest manufacturer of sensors for the detection of explosives, weapons, chemical agents, biohazards, narcotics and contraband. John Crane is a manufacturer of seals and associated products for the process industries. Smiths Medical is a manufacturer and supplier of specialty medical devices and equipment. Smiths Interconnect is a manufacturer of electronic and radio frequency components. Flex-Tek is a supplier of components to heat and move fluids and gases.\n\nThe watch chronometer and instrument retailer's business was established by Samuel Smith as a jewellery shop at 12 Newington Causeway in south east London in 1851. In 1875, Samuel Smith died at the age of 49; during his time in control of the firm, it had experienced a rapid rate of growth. During 1872, it relocated the centre of its operations to 85 The Strand, next door to the premises of Charles Frodsham. In 1885, a large business operating as diamond merchants emerged, based at 6 Grand Hotel Buildings, Trafalgar Square, and from 1895 at 68 Piccadilly.\n\nThe companies produced a range of high quality precision watches; perhaps the most major customer for these was the Admiralty. Its precision watches were typically manufactured by Nicole Nielsen of Soho Square. During 1904, retailing and wholesaling of Smiths-branded motor accessories was launched; Nicole Nielsen produced Smiths' initial speedometer, the Perfect Speed Indicator; the first of which was delivered to Edward VII, the reigning British monarch, for the Royal Mercedes.\n\nDuring 1907, in order to satisfy the high demands for its products, Nicole Nielsen had to open a new factory in Watford. Around this time, Smiths also began to manufacture some of their own motor products, particularly speedometers. Starting in 1913, all motor accessories activities were carried out from handsome purpose-built premises at Speedometer House, 179-185 Great Portland Street (\"Motor Row\"). The premises in the Strand became a Lyons tearoom, but the jewellers' establishments were retained at Trafalgar Square and 68 Piccadilly. By this time, motor accessories production included Smiths multiple-jet carburettors (designed by Trier & Martin), lighting sets, headlamps, sidelights, tail lights, dynamo and electric starters, generators and the Smith's Auto-Clear mechanical horn.\n\nOn 21 July 1914, Smiths Group was floated on the London Stock Exchange; the organisation has been present on the exchange for over one hundred years.\n\nThe outbreak of the First World War in 1914 contributed to Smiths Group making gains in multiple markets around the world that had been previously held by the German competition. By 1915, new contracts issued by the British War Office for aeroplane accessories, lighting sets, and munitions required the speedy erection of a new freehold factory. This new factory, known as Cricklewood Works, was built at Cricklewood, north London. In 1921, the firm's Great Portland Street activities were moved to Cricklewood following the purchase of the former Metallurgique works alongside their Cricklewood Works. During the Interwar period, the company's accessories became standard fittings in new cars all provided by the manufacturer.\n\nAt the start of the 20th century, the age of the early automobiles, Smith & Sons retailed one of the first British odometers (\"mileometer\") and speedometer. In the 1930s, Smiths agreed a trading deal with British rival manufacturer Lucas whereby the two would not compete in certain areas, while Lucas took on part of Smiths non-instrumentation assets.\n\nSmiths became the dominant supplier of instruments to British motorcar and motorcycle firms. These later 20th century instruments carried a distinctive logo, the word \"SMITHS\" centred above the middle of the dial and silk screened onto it in a unique house font familiar to generations of drivers.\n\nDuring 1919, the distribution rights for the KLG Sparking Plug were purchased from Kenelm Lee Guinness. Smiths purchased 75 per cent of Ed. Jaeger (London) Ltd in 1927 (which became British Jaeger Instrument Company in 1932). Also in 1927, Smiths purchased the KLG Sparking Plug Company (Robinhood Engineering). The Jackall hydraulic jacking system was manufactured from 1935 by Smith's Jacking Systems and immediately became standard equipment in many popular cars. In 1937, a separate aircraft and marine department was created in the parent company and named Smiths Aircraft Instruments. It operated with Smiths subsidiary Henry Hughes and Son, who manufactured various instruments for the aviation and marine markets.\n\nIn 1946, Smiths and the Ingersoll Watch Company founded the Anglo-Celtic Watch Co. Ltd., which produced watches in Wales. At one point, this venture was one of the largest producers of watches in Europe and employed as many as 1,420 employees at its height; however, the Anglo-Celtic Watch Co. Ltd. was closed down in 1980.\n\nThe 1950s was a period of significant restructuring for Smiths Group; in 1958, Smiths Aviation and Smiths Marine were organised as separate divisions. During that same year, the business acquired a majority stake in Portland Plastics; the firm would become the foundations of Smiths Medical Systems division. \n\nIn 1960, the company formed a new Industrial division, the principal focus of which was the development and production of industrial instrumentation. As a measure to reflect its increasing diversification and international operations, the name \"Smiths Industries Ltd\" was adopted for the company in 1967. At the time of this name change, the company's advertised product range comprised: automotive — aerospace — marine — building — medical — clocks — watches — appliance controls — industrial instruments — ceramics — electronics.\n\nBy the late 1970s, the markets for clocks, watches, and automotive instruments had progressively decreased to the point where little of Smith's revenue came from these sources. The importance of the UK market was also diminishing for the company; by the early 1980s, 40 per cent of Smith Industry's profits were attributed to its overseas markets. In line with these business trends, the company embarked on a further round of restructuring during this period, leading to the adoption of a decentralised structure and looser management style.\n\nDuring 1983, Smiths Industries decided to cease its involvement as a direct supplier of Europe's automotive industry, selling on its automotive instrument division; the division was initially acquired by Lucas and subsequently by the factory employees themselves. They formed a new company, Caerbont Automotive Instruments, which has continued to produce classic Smiths-branded instruments for decades with the blessing of Smiths Group plc.\n\nIn 1984, Smiths Industries was reorganised into three principal operating divisions: Industrial, Medical Systems, and Aerospace and Defence. To strengthen and grow these division, the company proceeded with multiple acquisitions throughout the late 1980s and 1990s. In 1987, Smiths Industries purchased Lear Siegler Holdings Corp, an American avionics specialist; during 1994, Deltec, an American medical devices business, was also acquired by the firm.\n\nOn 30 November 2000, the company's name was changed to \"Smiths Group plc\". On 4 December 2000, it was announced that Smiths had completed a merger with TI Group, which held interests in aerospace, industrial seals and automotive parts. During the following year, Smiths Group transferred its newly-acquired automotive business into a separate corporate entity, creating TI Automotive, ahead of plans to dispose of. In July 2002, Smiths Group established a fourth division, Smiths Detection, which specialised in producing sensors and other equipment for the detection of weapons, explosives, contraband, and various hazardous substances.\n\nAt the start of the 2000s, Smith's aerospace subsidiary, Smiths Aerospace, was a growing sector of the group; it supplied both military and civilian aerospace markets, having deliberately aimed for a 50/50 split between the two sectors. By 2002, roughly half of the division's revenue was reportedly being sourced from the North American market. Historically, Smiths Group was positioned as a first-tier aerospace supplier, frequently seeking out relevant acquisition opportunities to further its presence in the field. In October 2004, Smiths Aerospace purchased Integrated Aerospace, an American equipment supplier. In early 2007, GE Aviation, a division of American conglomerate General Electric, announced that it was acquiring Smiths Aerospace for US$4.8 billion. Smiths Group stated that it chose to sell its aerospace division, which was profitable at the time, in order to invest in other areas of the business. This transference of ownership required approval from anti-trust regulators in both Europe and the US.\n\nIn September 2011, Smiths Group acquired the American-based power technology enterprise, Power Holdings Inc., for £145 million. On 21 April 2016, it was announced that Smiths Group was in the process of acquiring Morpho Detection LLC, a US-based subsidiary of Safran; it was integrated into the Smiths Detection division.\n\nDuring the 2010s, Smiths Group substantially ramped up investment in its research and development programmes. As a part of these efforts, it has established a Digital Forge in California. By 2018, the company was reportedly deriving 15 per cent of its income from its new product development efforts; management has stated their intention for 40 per cent of future revenue to be gained through such sources.\n\nFollowing an enterprise-wide restructuring programme in mid-2008, Smiths Group is organised into five separate divisions, namely:\n\nSmiths Detection designs and manufactures sensors that detect and identify explosives, weapons, chemical agents, biohazards, nuclear and radioactive material, narcotics and contraband. These sensors are widely used in airports, cargo screening at ports and borders, in government buildings and other critical infrastructure, as well as by the military and emergency responder services. The business uses a wide range of technologies including x-ray, computed tomography, trace detection, millimetre-wave, infra-red, biological detection and diagnostics. The business also carries out research to develop advanced technologies and introduce new products to combat terrorism and the illegal passage of goods.\n\nSmiths Medical makes specialty medical devices for infusion therapy, vascular access and vital care and other specialty products and services. Their devices are found in hospital, emergency, home and specialty care environments and are used during critical and intensive care, surgery, post-operative care and for support in managing chronic illness.\n\nJohn Crane provides products and services for the major process industries, including the oil and gas, power generation, chemical, pharmaceutical, pulp and paper and mining sectors. Products include wet seals, gas seals, couplings, seal support systems, specialist filtration systems, hydrodynamic bearings, and equipment for upstream applications.\n\nSmiths Interconnect designs and manufacture products that connect, protect and control critical systems for the various markets.\n\nFlex-Tek supplies engineered components that heat and move fluids and gases for various markets.\n\nIn 2015, Smiths appointed Andrew Reynolds Smith its CEO. Smith replaced Philip Bowman. Immediately before joining Smiths, Smith was CEO of GKN Automotive. He started work at GKN in 2002. He has worked in senior management at Ingersoll Rand, Siebe and Delphi Automotive Systems.\n\n"}
{"id": "2254828", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2254828", "title": "Only a Northern Song", "text": "Only a Northern Song\n\n\"Only a Northern Song\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1969 soundtrack album \"Yellow Submarine\". Written by George Harrison, it was the first of four songs the band provided for the 1968 animated film \"Yellow Submarine\", to meet their contractual obligations to United Artists. The song was recorded mainly in February 1967, during the sessions for \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\", but the Beatles chose not to include it on that album. The group completed the recording two months later, straight after finishing work on \"Sgt. Pepper\".\n\nHarrison wrote \"Only a Northern Song\" out of dissatisfaction with his status as a junior songwriter with the Beatles' publishing company, Northern Songs. The lyrics and music convey his disenchantment at how the company retained the copyright for the songs it published, and at how, following its public listing in 1965, the major shareholders profited more from his compositions than he did. The recording features Hammond organ, played by Harrison, and an overdubbed montage of assorted sounds including trumpet blasts and spoken voices, anticipating John Lennon's 1968 sound collage \"Revolution 9\". Due to the difficulty in assembling the completed track from two tape sources, \"Only a Northern Song\" remained a rare song from the Beatles' post-1963 catalogue that was unavailable in true stereo until 1999. That year, it was remixed for inclusion on the album \"Yellow Submarine Songtrack\".\n\nThe song has received a varied response from reviewers; while Ian MacDonald dismisses the track as a \"self-indulgent dirge\", the website Ultimate Classic Rock identifies it as one of the Beatles' best works in the psychedelic genre. A version of the song with a different vocal part, and omitting the sound collage overdubs, was issued on the Beatles' 1996 outtakes compilation \"Anthology 2\". Gravenhurst and Yonder Mountain String Band are among the artists who have covered \"Only a Northern Song\".\n\nGeorge Harrison said that the subject matter for \"Only a Northern Song\" related to both his city of birth, Liverpool, in Merseyside, and the fact that the copyright for the composition belonged to the Beatles' publishing company, Northern Songs. Author Brian Southall describes the song as Harrison's \"personal denunciation of the Beatles' music publishing business\", given his disadvantageous position with Northern Songs. The company was floated on the London Stock Exchange in February 1965, as a means of saving John Lennon and Paul McCartney, the Beatles' principal songwriters, the tax liability generated through the international success of their catalogue. Harrison had formed his own publishing company, Harrisongs, in late 1964; despite the financial advantages offered by his 80 per cent stake in that company, he agreed to remain with Northern Songs, to aid the flotation scheme. Among the four Beatles, Lennon and McCartney were major shareholders in Northern Songs, each owning 15 per cent of the public company's shares, and the pair earned considerable wealth over the first year of the flotation. Harrison and Ringo Starr, as contracted songwriters, owned 0.8 per cent each. This arrangement ensured that, in addition to the company retaining the copyright of all its published songs, Lennon and McCartney profited more from Harrison's compositions than he did.\n\nWhen discussing the song in two late 1990s interviews with \"Billboard\" editor-in-chief Timothy White, Harrison commented that the main target of his complaints was Dick James, the managing director of Northern Songs. Having been signed by James in 1963, at the age of twenty, Harrison said that the publisher had failed to explain that by signing the contract, he was also signing away the ownership of his compositions. Harrison added that he only understood the consequences after the 1965 flotation, when the major shareholders were \"making all this money out of this catalog\". With reference to the Rutles' 1978 parody of the Beatles' history, \"All You Need Is Cash\", he also told White: \"I think [the message behind 'Only a Northern Song'] was put better in the make-believe TV documentary … where it said, 'Dick Jaws, an out-of-work music publisher of no fixed ability' signed them up for the rest of their lives.\"\n\nIn author Ian MacDonald's estimation, \"Only a Northern Song\" suggests that Harrison \"had yet to recover his enthusiasm for being a Beatle\" after he had threatened to leave the group following their final concert tour, in August 1966. Before the band regrouped in November that year to begin recording their album \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\", Harrison spent six weeks in India with his sitar teacher, Ravi Shankar, a visit that heightened his lack of interest in the Beatles' project. MacDonald considers that Harrison's link with northern England in \"Only a Northern Song\" was influenced by the Beatles working on songs about growing up in Liverpool, which was the concept under consideration at the start of the \"Sgt. Pepper\" sessions.\n\nHarrison wrote \"Only a Northern Song\" on a Hammond organ, which became his preferred instrument for songwriting during 1967, replacing the guitar. The song is in the key of A major,<ref name=\"Pollack/Notes\"></ref> although MacDonald gives B minor as a secondary key. The opening organ part ends with a preview of the melody over which the song title appears in the song proper. After this short introduction, the composition is structured into two portions, each consisting of two verses and a chorus, which are followed by a single verse, a final chorus and an outro, with some of these sections rendered as instrumental passages.\nThe composition is a meta-song,<ref name=\"Runtagh/RS\"></ref> in that its subject is the work itself. While commenting on the pointlessness of writing for Northern Songs, Harrison employs musical dissonance to express his dissatisfaction with the company. In musicologist Walter Everett's description, this is achieved through the use of \"ill-behaved tones\" and \"wrong-mode\" chords.\n\nFrom the verse's opening A major chord, the melody moves to a ii minor voicing, rendered as B minor 7/11 through the inclusion of a low-register E note. In his lyrics, Harrison acknowledges the apparent awkwardness of such a change, singing \"You may think the chords are going wrong\" and, in the final verse, that the harmony \"might be a little dark and out of key\". Musicologist Alan Pollack considers the song's music and lyrical message to be \"uncannily in tune\" with one another, and that this effect is accentuated by surprising and irregular phrase-lengths in the verses.\n\nIn contrast to the minimal chord changes over the verses, the choruses present a fast progression of chords – specifically, E major, B minor 7, G major, C7 and F7. In the first chorus, Harrison comments that, given the inadequacy of his publishing arrangement, \"It doesn't really matter what chords I play\". Author Ian Inglis interprets this line as mirroring the singer's complaint to Beatles biographer Hunter Davies in the late 1960s, regarding the futility of the band's live performances when their screaming fans never listened to the music the Beatles were playing. Harrison biographer Simon Leng describes \"Only a Northern Song\" as the first example of its composer \"pushing back at the Beatles as an organization he found wanting\", a theme Harrison returned to in 1968 with \"Not Guilty\", with his comments on the group's internal discord.\n\nThe Beatles taped the basic track for \"Only a Northern Song\" at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) on 13 February 1967, during the sessions for \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\". As was typical with his new compositions, Harrison had yet to give the song a title, so it was referred to as \"Not Known\". The line-up on the track comprised Harrison on organ, Lennon on tambourine, McCartney on bass and Starr on drums. The band recorded nine takes of the song before selecting take 3 for further work. The following day, the studio engineers carried out three reduction mixes of this performance onto fresh 4-track tapes. On what was now called take 12 (the third of the reduction mixes), Harrison filled the two available tracks with his lead vocals.\n\nThe song was disliked by the Beatles' producer, George Martin, who later said it was his least favourite song of Harrison's. The band were similarly unenthusiastic and it was decided to omit the song from the album. As his sole writing contribution to \"Sgt. Pepper\", Harrison instead offered the Indian-styled \"Within You Without You\", which, in Martin's recollection, was welcomed with \"a bit of a relief all round\". \"Only a Northern Song\" then became the first track the group supplied for the soundtrack to the \"Yellow Submarine\" animated film, in line with their contractual obligation to United Artists to provide four new songs. Described by Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn as a \"myth\", a story later circulated that Harrison had rush-written the composition for United Artists in early 1968, after Al Brodax, the film's producer, approached the band for a final song.\n\nThe group returned to take 3 of \"Only a Northern Song\" on 20 April, a day when members of the \"Yellow Submarine\" production team visited them in the studio. The band started working on the song less than 45 minutes after completing the final mixing on \"Sgt. Pepper\", demonstrating what Lewisohn terms a \"tremendous appetite\" to continue recording.\n\nRetaining the organ and drum tracks, they overdubbed a new bass guitar part and, on a separate track, trumpet, glockenspiel and vocalised sounds. A second 4-track tape recorder was used, so allowing the various instrumental parts and studio effects to be spread across eight available channels. On this machine, the band worked on the second reduction-mix tape from 14 February, known as take 11, from which they wiped all the previously recorded tracks except the Hammond organ part. Harrison then recorded two tracks of vocal, one of which included more trumpet from McCartney and further vocalised sounds, while the final track was filled with timpani, Mellotron, piano and more organ. The presence of Harrison's original Hammond part on both of the tapes ensured that the instrument had a more substantial sound in the mix.\n\nThe Beatles performed many of the overdubs in a haphazard manner. Tom Maginnis of AllMusic describes the completed track as \"heavily steeped in the psychedelic sounds of the period, using liberal amounts of loose instrumentation\", particularly \"chaotic bursts of trumpet\".<ref name=\"Maginnis/AM\"></ref> According to Pollack, these additions constitute a \"noise track\", which further heightens the theme of discordance, and is used to fill the song's instrumental sections, becoming especially prominent during the outro. With its inclusion of random sounds and spoken voices, Inglis cites the sound collage effect as a precedent for Lennon's 1968 avant-garde track \"Revolution 9\" and an early example of electronic music.\n\nOn 21 April, the Beatles completed a mono mix of the song for its inclusion in \"Yellow Submarine\". Due to the difficulty in getting the two 4-track machines to play at exactly the same time, attempts at creating a stereo equivalent were abandoned.\n\nIn October 1968, while preparing the \"Yellow Submarine\" soundtrack album for release, EMI's engineers created a duophonic (or mock-stereo) mix of \"Only a Northern Song\" from the mono mix. The monaural version of the album, which was originally available only in the UK, similarly used a suboptimal version of the recording. In this case, as with the three other new songs presented to United Artists, the engineers combined the two channels from the duophonic mix, rather than use the true mono mix from April 1967.\n\nThe Beatles had minimal involvement in the making of \"Yellow Submarine\", leaving the production to Brodax's company King Features Syndicate. The film-makers drew heavily on the \"Sgt. Pepper\" concept,<ref name=\"Bamber/Senses\"></ref> the Beatles' association with Liverpool, and other aspects of their public image. While the project's art design was carried out by a team led by Heinz Edelmann, sequences such as \"Eleanor Rigby\" and \"Only a Northern Song\" were created by outside animators, ensuring stylistic variation across the film.\n\n\"Only a Northern Song\" plays over a scene when the yellow submarine travels through the Sea of Science, during the Beatles' quest to free Pepperland and the imprisoned Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band from the music-hating Blue Meanies. The recording was slowed down by a semitone for inclusion in the film. Referring to the psychedelic imagery in the animation, author Stephen Glynn says that this segment \"only 'makes sense' when read as attempting an audio-visual recreation of the hallucinogenic state\". Jeremiah Massengale, an academic in the field of visual communication, highlights the sequence as one of many technical innovations introduced by the 1968 film, saying: \"accompanying multi-colored, square portrait paintings of the Beatles during 'Only a Northern Song', there's a creative use of an oscillator picking out the sound waves of the track.\" Glynn cites the drug-inspired imagery of this and two other song sequences as the true reason that Rank pulled \"Yellow Submarine\" from its UK cinema run, rather than the company's official reasoning that the film had performed poorly at the box office.\n\nThe \"Only a Northern Song\" segment was among the clips shown in a feature about \"Yellow Submarine\" on the television show \"How It Is\". Produced by Tony Palmer and including portions of the stage play based on Lennon's book \"In His Own Write\", the show was broadcast on BBC1 two days after the film's world premiere in London, on 19 July 1968. By the early 21st century, \"Only a Northern Song\" was the only music clip from \"How It Is\" circulating among collectors.\nThe film soundtrack was viewed as a secondary work by the Beatles, who delayed its release to allow for their 1968 self-titled double album (also known as \"the White Album\"). On 13 January 1969, \"Only a Northern Song\" was issued as the second track on side one of the \"Yellow Submarine\" LP, with George Martin's orchestral score for the film occupying the whole of side two. Although Harrison's contract with James had expired in March 1968, the copyright for \"Only a Northern Song\" and his second contribution to the film, \"It's All Too Much\", remained with Northern Songs rather than being assigned to Harrisongs as his four White Album compositions had been. The song's release coincided with a period of acrimony between Dick James and the Beatles, particularly Lennon and McCartney, about whom Lewisohn writes: \"If John and Paul still thought they owned their songs [following the flotation of Northern Songs] they were deluding themselves.\" In March 1969, having become wary of the disharmony within the band and the problems affecting their Apple Corps business empire, James sold his majority shareholding in Northern Songs to Lew Grade's ATV Music, thereby selling on the ownership of the Beatles catalogue.\n\nIn a contemporary review of \"Yellow Submarine\", \"Beat Instrumental\" lamented that it offered little new material by the band, but described \"Only a Northern Song\" and \"It's All Too Much\" as \"superb pieces\" that \"redeem\" side one. \"Record Mirror\"s reviewer said that whereas most of the songs were \"simple Beatles stuff\", \"Only a Northern Song\" appeared to be a \"technical experiment in how many off-key variations on a solid background tune one can get in, [while] still maintaining a reasonable amount of finesse – and it comes off very well\". Recalling the release in his 1977 book \"The Beatles Forever\", however, Nicholas Schaffner dismissed the track as one of the \"trifling baubles\" the Beatles provided for the film. While adhering to Brodax's account of the song's creation, \"NME\" critic Bob Woffinden found \"considerable merit\" in \"Only a Northern Song\", and said that Harrison's divergence from his usual, methodical approach to songwriting was one he should pursue more often.\n\nIn January 1996, the song was issued as the B-side to \"It's All Too Much\" on a blue-vinyl jukebox single, as part of a series of Beatles releases by Capitol Records' CEMA Special Markets division. By 1999, \"Only a Northern Song\" remained one of only two post-1963 Beatles songs not to have been made available in true stereo (the other being \"You Know My Name (Look Up the Number)\"). That year, a stereo version became available when the track was remixed for inclusion on the album \"Yellow Submarine Songtrack\", which accompanied the re-release of the animated film.<ref name=\"Fontenot/About\"></ref> Harrison was the most active of the former Beatles in promoting the 1999 reissue, which he said was timely, given that the Blue Meanies \"have got a bigger stranglehold on the planet right now than they ever had back in 1967!\" He added that \"even the music industry has turned grey and is dominated by Blue Meanies.\"\n\nAmong more recent reviews of the \"Yellow Submarine\" album, David Gassman of PopMatters admires the song for its \"mordant humor\" and interprets the lyrics as a possible \"dig\" at Lennon and McCartney. Gassman adds, with reference to the superior \"It's All Too Much\": \"as long as songs like this were being relegated to throwaway projects, George could be excused for sniping at John and Paul in 'Only a Northern Song'.\" Discussing the same two tracks, Pitchfork Media's Mark Richardson writes that they offer little of interest aside from their \"swirling\" psychedelic effects, although he considers that \"Only a Northern Song\" \"at least has a good joke going for it, simultaneously alluding to the North of England and the Beatles' Lennon-McCartney-dominated publishing company\". Mark Kemp of \"Paste\" dismisses the song as a \"meandering bore\".\n\nAs with most of the Beatles' post-\"Sgt. Pepper\" 1967 recordings, their contributions to \"Yellow Submarine\" have traditionally been held in low regard by the band's biographers.<ref name=\"Harris/Mojo\"></ref> Mark Lewisohn describes the group's 20 April overdubs on \"Only a Northern Song\" as \"a curious session\" and writes that their work over this period \"display[s] a startling lack of cohesion and enthusiasm\". Mark Hertsgaard considers that \"Only a Northern Song\" was \"understandably … rejected as not good enough for \"Sgt Pepper\"\", while Ian MacDonald views it as \"dismal\" and a \"self-indulgent dirge\".\n\nMore impressed, Alex Young of Consequence of Sound identifies the song as \"lyrically the [album's] quintessential track, as it perfectly defines \"Yellow Submarine\" in two verses alone, while coming out sonically like a Pink Floyd b-side from the \"Obscured By Clouds\" sessions\". In a 2003 review, in \"Mojo\", Peter Doggett said that Harrison's two contributions \"did much to rescue the album from oblivion\", and he described \"Only a Northern Song\" as \"gloriously ironic\". Writing for Ultimate Classic Rock in 2013, Dave Swanson ranked the track third on his list of the \"Top 10 Beatles Psychedelic Songs\" (following \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" and \"I Am the Walrus\") and concluded: \"Would 'Sgt. Pepper' have been even greater had this mind-melter been included in favor of, say, 'When I'm Sixty Four?' All signs point to a positive affirmation.\" In 2006, \"Only a Northern Song\" was ranked 75th in \"Mojo\"s list \"The 101 Greatest Beatles Songs\", where Glenn Tilbrook described it as \"a wonderfully unexpected tune\" and suggested that Harrison's \"lovely and sardonic lyric … could be the inspiration for a thousand Rutles songs\".\n\nWhile commenting on \"Yellow Submarine\"s status as the Beatles' only \"inessential\" album, Richie Unterberger of AllMusic describes \"Only a Northern Song\" as \"an odd piece of psychedelic ersatz, mixing trippiness and some personal comments\". Referring to the revelations offered in the song, Unterberger adds: \"they present Harrison's vision of how music and recording sounded, from the inside-out and the outside-in, during the psychedelic era – the song thus provided a rare glimpse inside the doors of perception of being a Beatle (or, at least, one aspect of being this particular Beatle) circa 1967.\" Writing for \"Billboard\" in 2001, Bill Holland grouped \"Only a Northern Song\" with the Byrds' \"So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star\" and early-1970s releases by the Kinks and Joni Mitchell, as songs that constitute the first wave of musical statements in which artists \"accuse or indict their industry's business policies\". Ian Inglis views \"Only a Northern Song\" as the Beatles' \"first 'postmodern' song\", due to the \"deliberate ironic intent\" evident in the subject matter and in the use of tape effects and scattered conversation.\n\nAn alternative edit of the song was included on the Beatles' \"Anthology 2\" out-takes compilation in 1996. Slightly sped up, and mixed in stereo, this version comprises the basic track without most of the April 1967 overdubs, and with a vocal take that contains some changes to the lyrics. According to Unterberger, aside from the lyrics, the \"Anthology 2\" version demonstrates that \"Only a Northern Song\" was \"much more like a standard rock song\" before \"the fanciful overdubs of trumpet and other strained far-outisms\".\n\nCoinciding with the popularity of \"It's All Too Much\" among acid-rock bands of the early 1990s, Sun Dial released a cover of \"Only a Northern Song\" as the B-side of their 1991 single \"Fireball\". In 2009, Greg Davis and jazz singer-songwriter Chris Weisman named their psychedelic folk partnership, Northern Songs, after the Beatles track. The pair's 2010 album \"Northern Songs\" similarly honoured the song and included a cover version of \"It's All Too Much\".\n\nWhen \"Mojo\" released the CD \"Yellow Submarine Resurfaces\" in July 2012, \"Only a Northern Song\" was covered by Gravenhurst. Yonder Mountain String Band included the song in their live performances during 2013 and 2015.\n\nAccording to Ian MacDonald:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2254838", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2254838", "title": "Førde Airport, Bringeland", "text": "Førde Airport, Bringeland\n\nFørde Airport, Bringeland (; ) is a regional airport located at Bringelandsåsen in the municipality of Sunnfjord, about south of the town of Førde in Vestland county, Norway. Owned and operated by the state-owned Avinor, the airport has a single runway numbered 07–25. It is served by Widerøe, which operates Dash 8-100 aircraft to the cities of Bergen, Florø and Oslo.\n\nStarting in 1970, the town of Førde was served by Førde Airport, Øyrane, located in an industrial site in town and with poor operational conditions. Bringeland was opened in 1986 and the old airport was closed. Bringeland originally consisted of a runway, but that was lengthened in 2010. Since 1988, the helicopter operator Airlift has also been based at the airport. The airport was originally municipal, but nationalized in 1996. Bringeland served 82,356 passengers in 2011.\n\nThe first plans for an airport serving the Sunnfjord region was in the town of Florø; construction started in 1956, but was halted. A government commission recommended in 1964 that a primary airport be built in Florø serve the entire county. These plans were changed in 1965, following Håkon Kyllingmark being appointed Ministry of Transport and Communications (Norway). He instead insisted on a network of short take-off and landing airports for smaller communities. Førde Airport, Øyrane was built with such specifications, but was located in the middle of the industrial area Øyrane, just outside the town center. From 1971 it became part of the regional aviation network in Western Norway.\n\nFrom before the airport was built it was evident that the location was not well suited, and planning of an alternative location began in 1968. The main concern was that the airport lacked an instrument landing system and could thus only be used during daylight hours. The first alternative location proposal was for Langelandsåsen, but the site was discarded by the Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) because of poor weather conditions. Late proposals were Espelandsmyrene and then Alværa on the Sognefjord. By 1972, the CAA had concluded that there probably was not a suitable location for an airport near Førde and recommended that the town instead by served by Florø Airport, located away.\n\nBringelandsåsen was proposed by the CAA in 1974. Plans were developed and in 1983 the Ministry of Transport and Communications recommended that Øyrane be closed and replaced with an all-new airport at Bringeland. Construction started in 1985 and the new airport opened on 31 August 1986, taking over all scheduled traffic from Øyrane. Widerøe started scheduled services to Oslo and Bergen, originally using de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter and DHC-7 Dash 7 aircraft, of which the latter which was used to Oslo.\nAirlift was established in 1986 and was based at Øyrane until 1988, when it also moved to Bringeland. Dash 8 aircraft were phased in from 1993.\n\nThe airport was originally owned as an inter-municipal enterprise by Gaular and Førde. Operating deficits were covered through various subsidies from the state, often with unclear responsibilities and little financial risk for the owners. Most regional airports, including Førde, were nationalized in 1996 and transferred to the CAA, later renamed Avinor. Widerøe lost the public service obligation contract to fly to Florø Airport in 2000, and therefore moved its technical base for Western Norway to Førde, which included a new hangar.\n\nFørde Airport had a café until 2006 and originally runway. In 2009 and 2010, it was expanded with another to the west. SCAT-I was installed in 2011. The following year, Widerøe regained the Florø contract, and moved its technical base back there.\n\nFørde Airport, Bringeland is owned and operated by the state-owned Avinor. The airport has a asphalt runway, aligned 07–25. Instrument flight rules are only allowed for aircraft equipped with SCAT-I. The terminal has a small conference center, and the airport is a seventeen-minute drive from Førde. Firda Billag operates an airport coach to Førda, which takes twenty minutes. Paid parking, taxis and car rental is available at the airport. Airlift has its own hangar, helipad and administration buildings.\n\nWiderøe operates all scheduled services out of Førde, connecting it to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen and Bergen Airport, Flesland with a combined seven daily flights. The flights are operated with Dash 8-100 aircraft and are subsidized as part of a public service obligation contract with the Ministry of Transport and Communications. Førde Airport is the local airport for ten municipalities in Sunnfjord and outer Sogn. The airport had 82,356 passengers, 8,109 aircraft movements and 3 tonnes of cargo in 2014. Less than a fifth of the patronage travels to Bergen, and Førde even experiences some leakage by people driving to Bergen Airport directly.\n\nThe helicopter operator Airlift is based at Bringeland; it is the largest employer in Gaular, with 150 employees in 2002. The company flies air ambulance and various charter services. Also at the airport is an aviation club, Fjordane Flyklubb.\n\nAvinor has started a process to look at the airport structure in Sogn og Fjordane. Early plans have looked at closing down Førde Airport, and possibly also Sandane Airport, Anda, while expanding the runway at Florø Airport to . This would allow for jetliners to operate from Florø to Oslo with significantly lower ticket prices [not likely with less than 80-120'000 citizens within 50–80 km radius] and remove the need for subsidies. Previously, the Ministry of Transport and Communications has proposed closing Sandane Airport and splitting the traffic between Førde and Ørsta-Volda Airport, Hovden. The road distance from Sandane to Bringeland is , from Sandane to Florø Airport 93 km (58 mi) and from Førde to Florø Airport 58 km (36 mi).\n\n"}
{"id": "2254840", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2254840", "title": "Monkland Canal", "text": "Monkland Canal\n\nThe Monkland Canal was a canal designed to bring coal from the mining areas of Monklands to Glasgow in Scotland. In the course of a long and difficult construction process, it was opened progressively as short sections were completed, from 1771. It reached Gartcraig in 1782, and in 1794 it reached its full originally planned extent, from pits at Calderbank to a basin at Townhead in Glasgow; at first this was in two sections with a vertical interval between them at Blackhill; coal was unloaded and carted to the lower section and loaded onto a fresh barge. Locks were later constructed linking the two sections, and the canal was also connected to the Forth and Clyde Canal, giving additional business potential.\n\nMaintaining an adequate water supply was a problem, and later an inclined plane was built at Blackhill, in which barges were let down and hauled up, floating in caissons that ran on rails. Originally intended as a water-saving measure to be used in summer only, the inclined plane was found to pass barges more quickly than through the locks and may have been used all the year.\n\nIn the second and third decades of the nineteenth century, technical advances in iron smelting coupled with fresh discoveries of abundant iron deposits and coal measures encouraged a massive increase in industrial activity in the Coatbridge area, and the Canal was ideally situated to feed the raw materials and take away the products of the industry.\n\nThe development of railways reduced the competitiveness of the canal, and eventually it was abandoned for navigation in 1952, but its culverted remains still supply water to the Forth and Clyde Canal. Much of the route now lies beneath the course of the M8 motorway, but two watered sections remain, and are well stocked with fish.\n\nThe eastern end of the final extent of the canal is at Calderbank, south of Woodside Drive, where there were coal pits; the canal was fed there from the North Calder Water. A reservoir was created at Hillend (east of Caldercruix) to sustain the canal in the dry season, and others were made later.\n\nThe canal ran close to the north side of the North Calder Water, passing more coal pits (and later ironstone pits) at Faskine and Palacecraig, then turning north there. Palacecraig was later the southern extremity of the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway. The canal passed under the road at Sikeside (now called Sykeside Road, Cairnhill), from where it is nowadays in culvert.\n\nTurning west it passed under what is now Locks Street, Coatdyke; the name refers to the original canal lock; there is a small sign there recording the history. There was a lock to the east of the road, and a basin and second lock to the west of it. This location was called Sheepford Locks, and was the eastern extremity of the canal as originally built. A branch canal called Dixon's Cut was later built from the basin southwards to Dixon's Calder Ironworks, south of the present-day Greenend housing area. The canal then continued westward, a little to the south of the Airdrie to Coatbridge main road.\n\nIt passed south of the present-day Main Street area of Coatbridge, from where the short Dundyvan Branch ran southwards. It was built to serve coal pits and then extended to serve the Dundyvan Ironworks with a complex of railway trans-shipment sidings at its termination. The main canal then ran fairly straight from the present-day A725 roundabout at the east end of Coatbridge Main Street to the Sunnyside Street roundabout. At this time Coatbridge had not developed at all, and the canal was simply described as \"passing under the Edinburgh and Glasgow Road, by a wooden bridge, termed Coat Bridge, west of Airdrie.\"\n\nAnother branch diverged northwards here, to the west of Sunnyside Road: called the Gartsherrie, Hornock and Summerlea Branch Canal, it ended at the Gartsherrie Ironworks, just south of the present-day Gartsherrie Road. It was originally planned to serve coal pits, but it was still unfinished in 1830 when the Baird Brothers established their Gartsherrie Ironworks at its termination.\n\nContinuing westward, the main canal originally crossed the Gartsherrie Burn on Cotes Bridge, a low aqueduct long and high. (Gartsherrie Burn ran north to south between the alignment of the two present-day railways that cross Bank Street; it was culverted when the area was later developed.) The aqueduct collapsed and had to be repaired in 1858.\n\nThe canal then ran broadly west between Bank Street and West Canal Street, then turning a little more northerly from Blairhill Street, south of the present King Street, as far as Blair Street. Just east of Blair Bridge the Langloan branch diverged, heading a short distance south on the eastern margin of West End Park (originally called Yeomanry Park) to a basin serving Drumpellier Pit and Langloan Iron Works, founded in 1841, where Langloan Street now joins Bank Street. There was an tunnel under Bank Street and Buchanan Street.\n\nOnwards from Blair Bridge the canal is open again; the route here arcs northward towards and through the Drumpellier estate, passing north of Drumpellier Home Farm. The estate had a bridge connecting the northern area. The canal then heads west again, with a short northerly spur serving coal pits at Drumpellier, continuing under the present-day railway line, and under the Cuilhill Road bridge. A little to the west was Cuilhill Gullet, where an island in the canal was formed to enable the construction of the terminal of the Drumpeller Railway (the old spelling). The Railway is described below. Still continuing west, but culverted nowadays, the canal was crossed by a swing bridge at Netherhouse Road, and then at Rodgerfield Road, from where the course of the canal is covered by the M8 motorway.\n\nEasterhouse Road and Wardie Road (Bartiebeith) crossed the canal by bridges, followed by Milncroft Road (an eastward extension of the present road) and then Gartcraig Road. This was probably the westernmost point the canal reached at first under James Watt, when the money ran out. When the canal was extended westward, it passed under the main Cumbernauld Road. The Blackhill incline and locks were at the point where the present M80 motorway joins the M8 motorway. The arrangements at Blackhill are described more fully below.\n\nThe canal continued on a broadly westerly course, completely obliterated now by the motorway, terminating in Townhead Basin fronting to Castle Street, at a point where Parson Street and Alexandra Parade would intersect, under the motorway junction.\n\nWhen the \"cut of junction\" was formed, a short section of new canal linking the Monkland Canal to the Forth and Clyde branch canal, it was routed north from the basin under Garngad Hill (now Royston Hill). The route then turned west under Castle Street. The grooves worn by the barge towropes can be seen on the iron facing to Castle Street bridge abutment at this point.\n\nA short branch was formed off the cut off junction to serve industrial premises in the area between the present Royston Road and Charles Street. The cut off junction was originally made to the same depth () as the Monkland Canal, but in 1842 it was deepened to accommodate the larger vessels that could use the Forth and Clyde Canal, which could then reach Tennent's chemical works. Opening bridges were provided at Glebe Street and Port Dundas.\n\nThe boats used on the canal were originally flat-bottomed wooden vessels with a low freeboard; they had no living accommodation nor any protection for their crew, and they were horse-drawn. Hutton says that they were habitually known as \"scows\". Steam vessels with screw propellers were introduced from the 1850s.\n\nA iron boat was launched in May 1819 and entered service on the Forth and Clyde Canal as a passenger boat. Named the \"Vulcan\", she is famous for being the first iron boat made in Scotland. Although she operated on another canal, she was made at Thomas Wilson's Faskine boatyard, partly because of the proximity of ironworks and ironfounders. She was scrapped in 1873.\n\nIn 1986 Monklands District Council had a replica constructed. This can now be seen on the canal within Summerlee Museum of Scottish Industrial Life.\n\nPrior to 1743 coal had been mined in Little Govan, close to Glasgow. When that working ceased, the price of coal in Glasgow rose considerably, doubling by 1760 (from between 1/1 and 1/3 per cart of 7 cwt), to between 2/1 and 2/6. (1 cwt = 112 lb or 51 kg). Available coal was mined in Lanarkshire, but, before proper roads were built, the cost of transport by horse and cart was a significant factor. When the Trades House of Glasgow protested, one member cited another cause: that the coal masters had combined to keep prices high; he asserted that the price ought not to exceed 1/6, including 6d for cartage and tolls.\n\nThe inventor and engineer James Watt said later that Monklands was \"a country full of level free coals of good quality, in the hands of many proprietors, who sell them at present at 6d per cart of 7 cwt at the pit\".\n\nBy 1768, the rapid growth of Glasgow had vastly increased the demand for coal, and its price: several bodies expressed concern, and the magistrates of Glasgow took action. The Lord Provost was James Buchanan of Drumpellier, and the rich Monklands coalfield was practically untapped. Canals were being promoted all over the country, and seemed to be the obvious solution here; the magistrates commissioned James Watt to recommend a route.\n\nIn November 1769 he reported back, suggesting two possible routes; one was expensive, at more than £20,000, entering the Clyde at Glasgow Green. Its route involved 25 locks, with a summit above the level of the Clyde. Watt said:\n\nThe Great expense of the above canal and the time that would be consumed in passing the locks ... have made me examine how far it is practicable to bring a canal without any locks ... I find that it can be brought to within a little more than a mile [1.6 km] of the town and that a waggon way or good causeway can be made for the remainder of the way. [This route] ends a little south of Jermiston, there appearing to be no possibility of bringing it near Glasgow on that level.\"\n\nThis proposal seems to ignore completely the major problem of the of vertical interval at Blackhill, an obstacle that was to cause serious problems later.\n\nOn 3 January 1770 the cheaper scheme—at £10,000—was laid before a meeting of business people, and following a second meeting on 11 January a subscription list was opened. The Town Council of Glasgow agreed to subscribe £500, with a complicated precondition designed to prevent the coalowners forming a cartel to keep prices high.\n\nThe subscription list was swiftly filled, and the necessary Act of Parliament was secured on 12 April 1770.\n\nThe Lord Provost was refunded \"£65 as half of his charges in going to and coming from London anent obtaining the Act of Parliament ... the other half of such expense being chargeable on the proprietors of the Monkland Canal\".\n\nThe Act allowed the proprietors to raise £10,000 by issuing shares, and an additional £5,000 if necessary. Water for the canal was to be extracted from Frankfield Loch, Hogganfield Loch, and any other streams or lochs within of the proposed route which were not already supplying the Forth and Clyde Canal. The requirement in the Act to take water only from a narrow geographical area, and the prohibition on taking water from sources that fed the Forth and Clyde Canal resulted in continuing water shortage problems later.\n\nThe construction process was very difficult and protracted. It was supervised by Watt, with work beginning on 26 June 1770 at Sheepford, working westward.\n\nEvidently he let contracts directly and seemingly informally, in sections; he soon found that contractors were incapable of pricing the jobs properly, or even of carrying out the work effectively, and some of them \"had to be dissuaded from trying to carry on\". There was a significant shortage of workmen capable of the work, and poaching between contractors became a serious problem.\n\nWatt preferred engineering design to managing the works: \"Nothing is more contrary to my disposition than bustling and bargaining with mankind:--yet that is the life I now constantly lead. ... I am also in a constant fear that my want of experience may betray me into some scrape, or that I shall be imposed upon by the workmen.\"\n\nHe experienced severe weather and difficult ground, writing in December 1770: \nNotwithstanding the desperate weather I am almost constantly at the canal ... I have a hundred men at work just now, finishing a great hill we have wrought at this twelvemonth. The nastiness of our clay grounds is at present inconceivable; the quantities of rain have been beyond measure.\n\nOur canal has not stopped, but it is likely to do so, from our having expended the subscription of 10,000 l [£10,000] upon of the navigation, and having about yet to make. We have, however, made a canal of four feet water for one of three feet subscribed to, and have also paid most abominably for our land.\n\nIt is clear that he made the canal deep, more than originally specified by the proprietors; this followed a visit by the engineer John Smeaton on 28 July 1770. Smeaton \"pointed out that the depth of the canal could with advantage be increased to four feet ... without any additional excavation, and the General Meeting of the proprietors three days later agreed to this\". Thomson mentions that this has been overlooked by many writers, including Leslie, who erroneously quotes . The depth of the canal was according to Groome but Lewis stated with a width of at the surface, diminishing to at the bottom. The canal was broad, suitable for boats measuring up to .\n\nAs sections of the canal were completed, they were naturally put into use. James Watt kept a journal in which he recorded:\n1771 November 26: Coals brought by water to Langloan.\n1772 June 30: This day Mr Wark brought a boat of coals to Netherhouse.\n1772 October 30: At head of canal. The boat loaded by 12 o'clock with 40 carts coal. ... They came to Mr Dougal's wharf by 3 o'clock having been some time stopped by running aground at the reservoir.\n1773 May 10: Legat and Stewart had brought a boat of coals upon the Saturday of which some had gone into town.\n\nWatt wrote to Dr Small on 24 November 1772, saying:\n\"We have now actually filled with water and in use.\"\n\nJams Watt appears to have severed his connection with the canal from July 1773; at that time there were of canal dug westwards from Sheepford to Gartcraig. Detail of the activity in the next decade and a half are more sketchy. It seems likely that the initial money subscribed had run out without the canal being completed, and the financial climate made it difficult to continue, and that the company terminated Watt's employment.\n\nNot much coal seems to have traversed the part of the canal that was open, so that quite apart from the shortage of capital to continue construction, the Company was making an operating loss and was unable to pay its debts. An extraordinary general meeting was called on 3 May 1780, at which those present decided to make a call of 10% on all shareholders. This was a difficult time to ask for money, as the American War of Independence (1775–83) had ruined many of the Glasgow businesses, dependent on the American tobacco business. Moreover, asking for more money to keep a bankrupt business going was inopportune.\n\nAt this time a remark was made, facetiously suggesting filling the canal in. Miller tells the tale:\n... for many years, the revenue derived was so trifling, compared with the great outlay of capital, that the shareholders almost despaired of its ever proving a profitable investment. It is said that in 1805, when the annual meeting of shareholders took place, presided over by Mr Colt of Gartsherrie, at the conclusion, murmurs of dissatisfaction prevailed among the members at the very cheerless report. Many propositions were made, and, after discussion, abandoned. At last a question was put to the chairman as to what he thought should be done; he replied, \"Conscience, lads! the best thing we can dae, is for ilka ane o' us to fill up the sheugh on his ain lands and let it staun.\"\n\nMiller dates this at 1805, but Thomson is sure this must have been about 1781. Several writers have taken this as a serious proposal, including the engineer James Leslie in a respected journal. Of course filling in the canal would not have retrieved the money expended in digging it.\n\nAs a result of the financial crisis, the funds were not forthcoming and it was decided to sell shares by roup (public auction) on 14 August 1781; presumably these were forfeited shares (i.e. not additional shares). The shares taken up were heavily discounted and not all were taken; the final eleven shares were advertised in the \"Glasgow Journal\" on 21 March 1782.\n\nAt this time extent of the canal was the already described, and the western end was at Gartcraig. (See below for a discussion of this location.)\n\nThe new proprietors met on 15 April 1782 and resolved \"to carry the Monkland Canal from its previous termination to a point nearer the city\" and to put into effect measures to deal with \"such parts of the canal as shall require cleaning so as to give it four feet of depth of water, being the original depth\".\n\nThe extension to the canal basin at Townhead, seems to have been completed remarkably quickly. It extended from Gartcraig to Blackhill, and separately at the lower level from there to Townhead. On 16 April 1783 a notice of meeting stated that a forthcoming meeting would \"consider a plan and estimate for a junction between the upper and lower parts of the canal at Blackhill, and for a road from the present termination at the West End to the River Clyde\".\n\nThe canal then consisted of two sections, from Sheepford to Townhead, interrupted by the inconvenient connection at Blackhill, where coals were moved between the two sections by use of the incline: this seems to have been no more than a slope surfaced either for road wagons or provided with rails. The coal was transhipped from barge to waggon and from waggon to barge.\n\nThomson says that there \"is no means of ascertaining the nature of the proposed junction at Blackhill. Supplies of water were so meagre that locks were certainly out of the question and in all likelihood they used some modification of Watt's scheme for letting waggons down an incline, the descending waggons pulling up the unloaded waggons\".\n\nCleland, writing later, says, \"The communication between these levels was at that time carried on by means of an inclined plane, upon which the coals were let down in boxes, and re-shipped on the lower level.\"\n\nThe original authorising Act had included a causeway (i.e. a hard roadway) from the Townhead Basin to the centre of Glasgow. This detail was not proceeded with.\n\nReturning to 1786, the proprietors of the canal realised that the Blackhill discontinuity had now to be overcome; moreover the best coalfields lay a couple of miles east of Sheepford. An extension east involved locks there with a vertical interval of . The two groups of locks would vastly increase the requirement for water; this was readily available in the River Calder, but the Monkland Canal Act had forbidden the abstraction of any water that might later be claimed by the Forth and Clyde Canal, and that canal was itself considering an extension which would require the water.\n\nAndrew Stirling and John Stirling had between them 46 out of 101 shares in the Company, and \"Only the Stirlings (and particularly Andrew Stirling) were alive to the commercial possibilities\".\n\nA way forward was explored, and it emerged that both canals could benefit, if the Monkland took the Calder water and also made a connection to the Forth and Clyde near Townhead; that canal had a branch from its main line to this point to serve local factories. This was at the highest level on the Forth and Clyde Canal, and therefore the entire Forth and Clyde Canal would be fed by the Monkland Canal. This arrangement was ratified by the Monkland proprietors at a General Meeting on 8 January 1787.\n\nNonetheless the canal's finances were difficult: from 1782 to the end of 1789, the company had a gross income of £853 17s 5d and had expended £29,966 5s 3d: a loss of £28,112 7s 10d, and at the end of that period most of the individual shareholders had sold out, so that Andrew Stirling was the owner (personally or through his company) of over two thirds of the Canal.\n\nIn January 1790 the two canals jointly obtained an Act to make the \"cut of junction\" physically connecting them. The weak finances of the impoverished Monkland company were reflected in that the Forth and Clyde was to build the new feed from the Calder; it was also empowered to take as much water as it required for its own canal, provided that the Monkland Canal received enough water to maintain navigability. The Monkland Company was obliged to keep its canal open as a watercourse, this being a first charge on it; and it was authorised to extend from Sheepford \"to the Calder at or near Faskine or Woodhill Mill and to erect sufficient locks to make it navigable\". The Act authorised the Monkland company to raise an additional £10,000 of capital.\n\nThe extension to the River Calder was to cost £2,857 5s 0d and the locks at Blackhill £3,982. The cut off junction was to be funded by the Forth and Clyde.\n\nThe cut off junction was opened on 17 October 1791; at four feet deep it was the same as the Monkland Canal, although the main line of the Forth and Clyde was deeper. The extension to the Calder was completed in 1792 at a cost of £3,618 16s 3d, a 26% overspend.\n\nThe Blackhill locks took much longer, being completed in August 1793 although Thomson says (1794). There were four double locks, (i.e. two chambers with three pairs of gates,) each double lock having two falls of ; the total vertical interval was .\n\nNow at last the canal had an efficient means of fulfilling its original purpose: conveying coal from the Monkland pits to Glasgow. Talking of East Monkland in 1792, a writer says that \"Twenty years ago coal sold so low as 6d. the cart load; but since the Monkland Canal was opened, it sells at 18d. the cart weighing 12 [long] cwt [610 kg].\" In other words, coal extracted at Monkland now found a lucrative market in Glasgow.\n\nMeanwhile, the principal users of the canal, the owners or tacksmen, necessarily working deposits close to the canal, reduced in number. In 1793 the Statistical Account comments that the canal is unfinished, but adds:\nThe canal trade is at present as follows: \nStirling also brought 3,000 carts of dung and lime in to his agricultural estates.\n\nIn subsequent years, Stirling further expanded his activity and by 1802 he was paying 75% of the tonnage dues on the canal. Meanwhile, a redistribution of shares resulted in all the shares in the canal Company being in the hands of the firm of William Stirling & Sons (52) and Andrew Stirling personally (49). Andrew, John and James Stirling had made themselves the sole members of the Committee of Management and John and James—a majority of two votes out of three—increased the canal tolls to the maximum legally allowed. This led to litigation within the family, and also later from William Dixon, who had coal and iron works near the east end of the canal.\n\nThe full opening of the canal encouraged a huge increase in coal mining in the area, and the rise of the ironworks around Coatbridge both resulted from the existence of the canal, and encouraged further development of coal and ironstone extraction.\n\nThe early coalmining activity was on the Faskine and Palacecraig estates, which were on the eastern extension. In 1820 the city of Glasgow was consuming \"half a million tons of coal a year, almost all of it subject to the high tolls on the Monkland Canal\". In 1828 a rival company claimed that The Monkland Canal had \"for many years yielded a dividend of Cent. per Cent ... arising solely on its Tolls on coal\".\n\nThe iron industry was given a considerable boost when Blackband ironstone was discovered by David Mushet near Coatbridge in 1805 or 1806. The hot blast process of iron ore smelting was invented by James Beaumont Neilson, introduced in 1828. Several large ironworks were established in the Coatbridge area, seven blast furnaces in 1830, rising to 46 by 1840. These developments led to a vast and rapid increase in the industrial development in the Coatbridge area, focused on iron production and iron manufacturing. This led to a huge increase in demand for iron ore and coal from the pits in the area, and the Monkland Canal was able to transport it: coal carried in 1793 had been 50,000 tonnes, rising to a million tonnes by 1850.\n\nIn order to better serve the ironworks, four branches were constructed at the upper end of the canal. The branches to Calder Ironworks and Gartsherrie Ironworks were both about a mile (1.6 km) long, while those to Langloan Ironworks and Dundyvan Ironworks were about long.\n\nFrom 1828, railways started to be built; at first these did not directly compete with the canal, and the canal used the railways, and short tramways, as feeders, encouraging the connection: \"the Canal company were not slow to avail themselves of these iron pathways as feeders to their own trade; and accordingly, wherever it has been practicable, they have formed loading basins and wharves, connecting them by offsets with railways in the vicinity. The additional traffic resulting from this source has been very great.\"\n\nThe Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway opened in 1831 and linking with other railways, it was the first railway that directly competed with the canal. Fearing disaster from this competition, \"the company reduced their dues to about one-third of the rate which had been charged up till that time\". However \"although previously to the opening of the Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway ... the passage-boats rarely carried so many as 20,000 passengers in a year, yet, in the face of that great competition, the number of passengers has been gradually increasing, and [in 1845 or 1846] no fewer than 70,000 persons have been carried by the company's boats.\"\n\nIn 1846, an Act of Parliament authorised the amalgamation of the canal with the Forth and Clyde Canal, with the Forth and Clyde company paying £3,400 per Monkland share. The original shares had a face value of £100, but there had been some subdivision.\n\nIn 1846 Lewis reported: \"An extensive basin was lately formed at Dundyvan, for the shipment of coal and iron by the canal from the Wishaw and Coltness and the Monkland and Kirkintilloch railways; and boats to Glasgow take goods and passengers twice every day. [...] The revenue of the canal is estimated at £15,000 [...] per annum.\"\n\nFullarton, publishing in 1846 says that \"a very large sum has recently been expended by the company in the formation of new works, [which has included] additional reservoirs in the parish of Shotts, all uniting in the river Calder which flows into the canal at Woodhall, near Holytown, thereby insuring an abundant supply of water at all times\".\n\n\"There are three branch-canals from the main water-line, viz. one to Calder iron-works near Airdrie, about a mile [1.6 km] in length; another to Dundyvan iron-works, extending to about a quarter of a mile [400 m]; and a third to Gartsherrie works, about a mile [1.6 km] long.\"\n\nBy the 1850s and 1860s, the canal was transporting over one million tonnes of coal and iron per year.\n\nThe canal had originally been planned to stop short of central Glasgow, to avoid descending to the lower level there; a causeway was authorised, envisaging horse and cart haulage to the city, but it was not built. In 1786 when the completion of the canal was being proposed, the idea was repeated; however it was never carried out.\n\nAlthough the Townhead basin served much heavy industry in that quarter of Glasgow, progressive improvements to the navigability of the River Clyde meant that 100-tonne (110-short-ton) ships, and by the early years of the nineteenth century 400-tonne (440-short-ton) ships, could reach the Broomielaw quays from the sea. The conveyance of coal, iron ore and machinery from the canal down to the quays resulted in a huge and inconvenient cartage traffic through the city streets; this \"added a cost equivalent to carriage on a railway\", and of course involved a trans-shipment. The engineer Rennie designed a canal link from the Monkland Canal to the Clyde in 1797, but it involved vertical interval of lockage and was impossibly expensive; Stevenson prepared a similar scheme later but it too foundered. The Canal Company bought land for a connecting railway for the purpose in 1824, but that scheme also came to nothing.\n\nAlthough the trading position was buoyant in the mid-1840s, as railways developed and improved their own services, the canal lost traffic heavily as the years passed. Thomson says that the Blackhill inclined plane was only used for about 37 years (i.e. until about 1831) but this is completely inconsistent with traffic volumes, and Hutton's statement that it worked until 1887 is more convincing. From that time the declining traffic volume did not require the continued use of the inclined plane, and after standing idle for some years it was finally scrapped.\n\nIn 1867 the Caledonian Railway purchased the Forth and Clyde Canal in order to get possession of the harbour at Grangemouth, and by this purchase they acquired the Monkland Canal as well. The purchase guaranteed 6¼ per cent per annum on the capital of £1.14 million.\n\nTraffic declined steadily, from 1,530 thousand tonnes in 1863 to 586 thousand tonnes in 1888, 108 thousand tonnes in 1903 and 30 thousand tonnes in 1921.\n\nIn August 1942, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway as successors to the Caledonian Railway, applied to the Ministry of War Transport for an order authorising the abandonment the canal. Navigation rights were removed by an Act of Parliament passed in 1952.\n\nThe Sheepford locks were demolished in 1962.\n\nThe canal remained the primary water source for the Forth and Clyde Canal, and so some sections are still in water today, notably the eastern section between Woodhall and eastern Coatbridge, and between the west of that town and Cuilhill. The rest of the waterway to Port Dundas was converted into a culvert to maintain the water flow, and much of it now lies beneath the M8 motorway which was constructed along its path in the early 1970s; the motorway was originally called \"the Monkland Motorway\".\n\nThe culvert remains under the jurisdiction of Scottish Canals (as successor to British Waterways) because of its function as a feeder to the Forth and Clyde Canal.\n\nThe Scottish Development Agency was formed in 1975, and the canal was the subject of the \"Monkland Canal Land Renewal Project\". The line of the non-motorway section was protected by the District Council from 1978, and there has been some progress with creating a linear park and walkway along its route. The route forms an important part of the Summerlee Heritage Park and Drumpellier Country Park.\n\nThroughout its existence, procuring a reliable water supply was a significant issue for the canal. During the first construction phase under James Watt, Airdrie South Burn was used as a source, and \"some sort of lade was carried up the burn for \".\n\nWhen the Drumpellier section of the canal was completed, the section to the east around Muttonhole (at the west end of Coatbridge) was not ready and a temporary reservoir was created with a turf dam at \"the Flatters\", near Drumpellier Moss.\n\nIn the early 1830s, the embankments were raised (to increase the holding capacity) at Hillend reservoir (near Caldercruix) and at the Black Loch (near Limerigg). About 1836 an entirely new reservoir was built at Lily Loch adjoining Hillend.\n\nBetween 1846 and 1849 a new reservoir was made at Roughrigg, (south-east of Airdrie), jointly with the Airdrie and Coatbridge Water Company. The Canal was entitled to draw annually, and the capacity of Hillend, Lily Loch and Black Loch together was about . Nonetheless in the dry season of 1849 this proved insufficient and the canal was closed for several weeks; this led to the installation of the Blackhill incline.\n\nThe canal's interest in the Roughrigg reservoir was bought out by the Water Company in 1874 for £18,000.\n\nCleland says that in 1813, three passage-boats operated: one was between Glasgow and the locks at Sheepford, \"and farmed to a Company for four years\", implying that the Canal Company contracted out the operation.\n\nA Boat starts from the Basin at the head of the Town [Glasgow], every lawful day, at four o'clock, P.M. (except when impeded by ice,) and arrives at Sheepford at half past six o'clock. Cabin fare, 1s. 6d.; Steerage, 1s.\n\nA Boat starts from Sheepford Locks at half-past seven o'clock in the morning, and arrives at the Townhead Basin at ten o'clock. The Boat, which leaves Glasgow at four o'clock, P.M. ... and arrives at Sheepford, , half-past six, fare 1s.6d.\n\nTo perform the passage in the above time, it is necessary for the Passengers to walk about a quarter of a mile [400 m] at Blackhill Locks, where another Boat is provided.\n\nCleland informs readers that \"Sheepford is within of Airdrie. Although not regularly, the Boats go occasionally to Faskine, about further on, and arrive at seven o'clock, P.M.\"\n\nThe number of passengers which went by these boats was 11,470 in 1814, and 12,773 in 1815, bringing a revenue of £556 19s 1d and £648 13s 10d respectively.\n\nThis service seems to have continued for some time: in 1837 \"upwards of 50,000 passengers were conveyed between Airdrie and Glasgow\".\n\nHutton shows a photograph of a boat moored at McSporran's stable at Easterhouse; he says that it \"is believed to be one used for Sunday school outings\", and another photograph of a very crowded boat, \"Jenny\", taking a works outing on a pleasure trip.\n\nWhen the canal was extended from Gartcraig to Townhead, an incline was constructed at Blackhill—nineteenth-century picture postcards refer to the location as \"Riddrie\"—to enable the transfer of goods between the two levels of the canal.\n\nIt is not clear what the mechanical arrangements for this incline were. Leslie, writing much later, says:\nAn inclined plane for railway wagons at Blackhill connected the two reaches of the canal. The coals were unloaded from the boats in the upper reach into the wagons, run down the inclined plane, and again loaded into boats in the lower reach, which was a tedious operation, and hurtful to the coals.\n\nLeslie's comments are not unimpeachable. The reference to an \"inclined plane\" in original sources has led him and some modern writers to assume that this was a rope-worked incline with the wagons on rails, but this is not supported by any contemporary document. The limited financial and technical resources available at this time (Watt had long since departed) suggest that this might have been simply a sloping causeway on which boxes of coals were dragged down loaded, and back up empty. Alternatively it may have had rails—not necessarily metal—with single wagons making the transit. Hutton (page 42) refers to rails at this time.\n\nLeslie continues:\nAbout the year 1788, a set of locks was constructed at Blackhill ... The set of locks at Blackhill consists of four double locks , having each two lifts of , the whole height from reach to reach being generally , but varying a few inches according to the supply of water and to the state of the winds.\n\nAt the same time there were provided two locks to raise the level at Sheepford.\n\nLeslie's date seems to be premature; Martin states August 1793 for the opening of the Blackhill locks, apparently quoting the Glasgow Mercury for 20 August 1793 and the Glasgow Courier for 15 August 1793.\n\nLeslie goes on:\nIn the year 1837 the two uppermost locks were so much out of repair that it became necessary either to rebuild them or to construct two new ones ... It was resolved to proceed immediately with the construction of two new double locks by the side of the old ones.\n\nThese were to replace, and not duplicate, the upper locks only. However:\nBy the time that the new locks were finished, it had become evident, from the great increase in the trade, that either an entire second set of locks must be constructed, or some other means must be devised for passing a greater number of boats than could be accommodated by one set of locks.\n\nThe \"other means\" was some kind of inclined plane in which canal boats could be lowered and raised to accommodate the vertical interval between the two sections of the canal. At that time, systems of this kind had already been installed in the Shropshire Canal in 1788 and 1790, where 5 tonne boats were hauled up inclines dry, on cradles. In 1798 there had been an attempt on the Somerset Coal Canal to use a system in which 20 tonne boats could rise and descend vertically in a float chamber, the boat contained within a timber caisson; this had been unsuccessful. In 1809 a vertical lift had been installed at Tardebigge, Worcestershire, where boats in a wooden caisson were winched up by manpower; it was not successful and was replaced in 1815.\n\nFinally, the Morris Canal was built between 1825 and 1831 in spectacularly hilly country from coal mines down to estuarial rivers in New Jersey, US. Its builders installed 23 inclined planes carrying boats of 18 tons payload: the boats were hauled dry on rail-borne carriages. (Other systems were adopted on the canal later).\n\nHowever, after consideration of the technical alternatives, it was \"resolved to rebuild the two old upper locks and to build two new lower ones, so as to give an entire double set, which was done in 1841\".\n\nWith the lock system duplicated,\nthe trade was amply accommodated until July 1849, when the supply of water ran short, notwithstanding that storage is provided exceeding and the canal was shut in consequence for six weeks. It then became evident that some effectual means must be adopted for preventing any such interruption in future.\n\nThe storage capacity in reservoirs already exceeded the catchment, so that larger reservoirs were no solution; back-pumping water from the lower reach to the upper at Blackhill was considered too expensive, and Leslie and a colleague recommended the construction of an inclined plane, in which the empty boats would be hauled up \"wet\"—floating in a caisson on a rail-borne carriage. The dominant traffic was loaded down to Glasgow and empty back up; the intention was to haul the empty boats up the plane, and to let the loaded boats continue to use the locks. The \"wet\" system was preferred because boats long were in use; \"dry\" haulage required the carriage to traverse a brow, over which the carriage and boat descended into the upper reach, and with a long boat this was impractical. (Hauliers were also said to object to supposed damage to their vessels in this system.)\n\nIn October 1849 the Committee of Management of the Forth and Clyde Canal (which had by now taken over the Monkland Canal) gave instructions to James Leslie to proceed, and the work was completed by July 1850. The caissons for the boats were made of malleable iron; they were 70 feet long by 13 ft 4 in by 2 ft 9 in high (21.3 by 4.1 by 0.84 metres). The caissons were profiled to conform to the hull of the boats, so as to contain as little excess water as possible, to a depth of , and were only to convey empty boats.\n\nThe caissons ran on a railway track of gauge with flat bottom rails on longitudinal timbers, on a gradient of 1 in 10. There were two tracks. They ran on ten pairs of wheels, of diameter except the uppermost pair were and the second pair were , to accommodate the wedge shape of the carriage. A continuous rack was fixed to the longitudinal timbers, and a pawl—Leslie calls it a \"pall\"—attached to the carriage was arranged to engage the rack if the tension was let off the haulage cable.\n\nThe caissons were counterbalanced, the ascending caisson and the descending operating together. At the top of the incline, the caisson was brought close to the end of the upper canal reach; it was then forced close to it by hand-operated screw jacks to obtain a water seal, and two guillotine gates, at the end of the caisson and at the end of the canal respectively, were opened. At the bottom, the caisson simply descended into the lower canal reach and became immersed.\n\nThere were two high pressure steam engines. For most of the ascent, the caissons balanced, but as the lower caisson entered the canal water, it gained buoyancy, and the final closing-up required the engines to operate at full power to bring the upper caisson to the canal. The engines operated two shafts carrying the winding drums, geared to work in opposite directions, so as to achieve the counterbalancing of the caissons. The speed of ascent and descent was about , with a passage time of 5 to 6 minutes.\n\nThe screw jacks for closing the ascending caisson to the canal gate proved unsatisfactory, requiring the engine operator to make too fine a stop, within , and a hydraulical accumulator system was later adopted, which could ram the caisson closed over a longer range: up to .\n\nWhen a descent was about to start, the gates were closed and about of water from the space between was lost; it was pumped back to the upper reach.\n\nThe practice was to bring up empty boats partly grounded in the caisson, and to adjust the water in the descending caisson (containing water only) for balance.\n\nShortly after the incline was put to work, one of the gear wheels in the mechanism fractured. However, it proved possible to operate one side of the incline, of course without the benefit of the counterbalancing, the steam engines taking the whole of the load of the ascending caisson. This was done for the rest of the autumn; even with this serious temporary limitation, 30 boats a day were taken up, a total of 1124 including a few descending, until the beginning of November when the dry season ended.\n\nThe total cost of the incline including the land, amounted to £13,500. It was the only canal incline built in Scotland.\n\nThe section west of Coatbank Street had given difficulty in construction due to the unstable ground. In 1791 the canal burst its banks and flooded Coats Pit, drowning six miners.\n\nContemporary legal sources spell the name \"Drumpeller\", as does the legal scholar James and also contemporary (1858) Ordnance Survey maps; Carter and some other sources spell it \"Drumpellar\"; Thomson, Hutton and Lindsay spell it \"Drumpellier\", which is the modern-day spelling of the place name.\n\nReference has already been made to the numerous feeder tramways to bring minerals to and from the canal where pits and ironworks were close but not immediately adjacent, and the willingness of the Canal Company to form trans-shipment wharfs for railway connections. The tramways were generally made by the pit or ironworks owner on his own land and without requiring Parliamentary authority. There was one exception.\n\nThe Drumpeller Railway Company was incorporated under the Monkland Canal (Drumpeller Railway) Act on 4 July 1843 to construct a railway to connect pits at Bankhead to the canal at Cuilhill Gullet, a distance of just under . The Canal Company had the power to purchase it. It never conveyed passengers: it was \"simply a waggonway with such additional status as may be conferred by parliamentary authorisation\".\n\nJames' quotation of Bankhead as the southern terminus is clear, and it is confirmed by Cobb, who shows \"Bankhead Siding\" at the point where the southern slip road from the A8 road nowadays joins the A752.\n\nOther mapping sources do not show a settlement called at this location. Bankhead farm is about away on the east of the North Calder Water (beyond Waukmill). There is a \"Braehead\" in the appropriate location with several mining and claypit works indicated on the 1898 Ordnance Survey map. The exhaustive mines and minerals website Aditnow does not show a coal pit of either name in this vicinity. The southern terminus of the line must be Braehead. The pit there was considerably extended and the Drumpeller had many additional stub branches at the southern end as well as nearer the canal terminal.\n\nThe railway opened on 3 March 1845, and it had the track gauge of . The canal at Cuilhill Gullet was on an embankment above the local ground level, and the railway approached on a viaduct and crossed to the north side of the canal. The main line of the canal was diverted to the north of the wharf, forming an island. By 1849 the railway was sending 90 boatloads of coal a year to Glasgow. In 1849 an extension to pits at Tannochside opened.\n\nThe land falls considerably from Cuilhill to Braehead – about 100 feet in a mile (20 metres in 1 km) – and Cobb shows two inclined planes in this short section of railway.\n\nIt seems that the originally planned extent of the line was not completed in 1845: Braehead is only from Cuilhill; in 1847 the line was extended to Tannochside, and this may be the originally intended southern terminal.\n\nThe line ran south-south-east from Cuilhill Gullet (just east of where the present-day M73 crosses the line of the canal) along the line now occupied by Langmuir Road, then curving south-south-west to where Aitkenhead Road roundabout is now.\n\nEvidently the Monkland Canal Company exercised the power to acquire the Railway Company, and with the changes of ownership of the canal itself, the Drumpeller Railway became the property of the Caledonian Railway (CR). The CR changed the track gauge to standard gauge during June 1872 in association with making a connection of the hitherto isolated line to its own network. The connection was a west-to-south curve at Bargeddie station on the Rutherglen and Coatbridge line, giving rail access from the pits.\n\nThe pits the line was built to serve were eventually exhausted and the line closed in 1896.\n\nAs described earlier, under James Watt's supervision the canal stopped some distance short of Glasgow. Hutton's description of the exact location is the clearest: \"The terminal reached by Watt in 1773 was near Barlinnie and connected to Glasgow by a cart road.\"\n\nBarlinnie is not noted as a place on the First Edition of the 25-inch Ordnance Survey maps (1858), and the most likely location for the termination seems to be Gartcraig Bridge (sometimes known as Jessie's Bridge), from where access to Glasgow was by way of Carntyne Road. The next possible location would be Smithy Croft bridge, but that is on the Cumbernauld Road; even in 1858 that was not a humble \"cart road\".\n\nHume asserts that the temporary end point was a canal basin opposite Barlinnie Prison on the north side of the canal, between Jessie's Bridge (an alternative name for Gartcraig Bridge) and Smithycroft Bridge; he says the basin \"is clearly visible on the 2nd edition of the OS 6-inch map (Lanarkshire 1896, sheet viNE)\". This is true, but the basin was not shown on the earlier 1858 map, and there was then no road in that vicinity.\n\nThe prison was built in 1880 and the canal was used for bringing in building materials. It is likely that the basin was made for that purpose. There is a track from the basin to the prison shown on the later map\n\nIn the mid-1980s, the canal was stocked with Carp, Roach, Bream, Tench, Perch and some other species. Scottish Canals and North Lanarkshire council maintain the waterway but a permit charge is not currently taken.\n\n"}

Written by George Harrison in 1967, it reflects the ideological themes of that year's Summer of Love. The Beatles recorded the track in May 1967, shortly after completing their album \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\". It was one of four new songs they then supplied for the 1968 animated film \"Yellow Submarine\", to meet their contractual obligations to United Artists.\n\nHarrison wrote \"It's All Too Much\" as a celebration of his experiences with the hallucinogenic drug LSD, although he subsequently found the same realisations in Transcendental Meditation and denounced LSD after visiting Haight-Ashbury in August 1967. The song features a Hammond organ, which gives the track a drone-like quality typical of Indian music, electric guitar feedback, and an overdubbed brass section. Largely self-produced by the band, the recording displays an informal approach that contrasts with the discipline of the Beatles' previous work, particularly \"Sgt. Pepper\". The song's sequence in the \"Yellow Submarine\" film has been recognised for its adventurousness in conveying a hallucinogenic experience.\n\nAlthough several Beatles biographers dismiss the track as aimless, \"It's All Too Much\" has received praise from many other commentators. Peter Doggett considers it \"one of the pinnacles of British acid-rock\", while Rob Sheffield of \"Rolling Stone\" rates it among \"the top five all-time psychedelic freakouts in rock history\". Former Gong guitarist Steve Hillage adopted the song during his early years as a solo artist in the late 1970s. Journey, the House of Love, the Grateful Dead and the Church are among the other artists who have recorded or performed the track.\n\n\"It's All Too Much\" reflects George Harrison's experimentation with the hallucinogenic drug Lysergic acid diethylamide, commonly known as LSD or \"acid\". Author Robert Rodriguez describes the track as \"gloriously celebratory\", with a lyric that conveys \"his acid revelations in a childlike way\". Rather than the song being purely drug-related, Harrison states in his 1980 autobiography, \"I, Me, Mine\", that the \"realisations\" brought about by his LSD experiences were also applicable to meditation.\n\nTogether with his Beatles bandmate John Lennon and their wives, Harrison first took acid in March 1965. He likened the heightened awareness induced by the drug to \"a light-bulb [going] on in my head\" and \"gaining hundreds of years of experience within twelve hours\". In addition, he credited LSD as being the catalyst for his interest in Indian classical music, particularly the work of Ravi Shankar, and Eastern spirituality. By the time Harrison wrote \"It's All Too Much\", in 1967, the Indian sitar had temporarily replaced the guitar as his main musical instrument, as he received tuition from Shankar and one of the latter's protégés, Shambhu Das. As with his other songs from this period, however, such as \"Within You Without You\" and \"Blue Jay Way\", Harrison composed the melody on a keyboard instrument. In the case of \"It's All Too Much\", his use of Hammond organ allowed him to replicate the drone-like sound of the harmonium commonly heard in Indian vocal pieces.\n\nCoinciding with the counterculture's preoccupation with enlightenment, 1967 marked the period when LSD use had become widespread among rock musicians and their audience. In a 1999 interview with \"Billboard\" magazine, Harrison said his aim had been \"to write a rock'n'roll song about the whole psychedelic thing of the time\".\n\nThe song is in the key of G major and the time signature throughout is 4/4. The melody is restricted within a G pedal point, with a simple melodic emphasis on scale notes 2 (A) and 7 (F). As a defining characteristic of Indian classical music, such minimal harmonic movement features in many of Harrison's other Indian-style compositions, including \"Within You Without You\" and \"Blue Jay Way\".\n\nAside from the song's intro and extended ending (or coda), the composition is structured into three patterns of verse and chorus, with the second and third patterns separated by an instrumental section. The song originally contained a fourth verse–chorus combination, but this would be omitted from the officially released recording. Among musicologists discussing \"It's All Too Much\", Walter Everett describes it as a two-chord composition, whereas Alan Pollack contends that the song's sole chord is G major, although he concedes that transcribers may well list fleeting changes to C major over the choruses. In Pollack's opinion, these sections appear to employ IV (C major) and ii (A minor) chords yet, rather than formal changes, \"it all boils down to neighbor tone motion in the inner voices superimposed on to the pedal tone of G in the bass.\"<ref name=\"Pollack/Notes\"></ref>\n\nAllMusic contributor Tom Maginnis writes that the lyrics \"reflect the idealist optimism of the soon-to-be-labeled 'summer of love' and the kind of chemically enhanced mind-expanding euphoria that pervaded the new 'hippie' youth culture\".<ref name=\"Maginnis/AM\"></ref> Author Ian Inglis views Harrison's mention of \"the love that's shining all around here\" and \"Floating down the stream of time\" as especially reflective of the philosophy behind the Summer of Love, while theologian Dale Allison identifies the singer's \"emerging religious worldview\" in the first of those phrases.\n\nThe song quotes a line from the Merseys' 1966 hit \"Sorrow\" – \"With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue\" – a reference that has led some commentators to interpret \"It's All Too Much\" as a love song to Harrison's wife, Pattie Boyd, a blonde-haired former fashion model. At another point on the recording, the trumpets play part of Jeremiah Clarke's \"Prince of Denmark's March\". The Beatles' use of musical and lyrical quotations here pre-dates \"All You Need Is Love\", which was written by Lennon and recorded in June 1967 for the group's appearance on the \"Our World\" television broadcast. While noting the similar ideological theme behind the two compositions, Inglis writes of Harrison and Lennon \"presenting alternative accounts of the same subject\" in the manner of French Impressionists such as Monet, Renoir and Manet, each of whom painted their own interpretations of sites in Paris and Argenteuil.\n\nThe Beatles began recording \"It's All Too Much\" on 25 May 1967 at De Lane Lea Studios, located on Kingsway in central London. With producer George Martin not in attendance that day, nor for the subsequent session, on the 26th, the band produced the recording themselves. The song had the working title of \"Too Much\", a phrase that journalist Robert Fontenot terms \"beatnik vernacular for an experience that was exceptionally mindblowing\". The group taped four takes of the basic track, the final version of which extended to over eight minutes, with Harrison playing Hammond organ, Lennon on lead guitar, Paul McCartney on bass, and Ringo Starr on drums. The following day, they added overdubs, comprising vocals, percussion and handclaps. In addition, according to authors Ian MacDonald and Kenneth Womack, Harrison also played lead guitar on the track.\n\nMacDonald characterises the 25–26 May sessions as \"chaotic\" and typical of the group's drug-inspired efforts after completing their album \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" late the previous month. On the Sunday following the sessions for \"It's All Too Much\", the four Beatles attended a party at their manager Brian Epstein's house in Sussex, where Lennon and Harrison introduced music-industry publicist Derek Taylor to LSD. The band returned to De Lane Lea on 2 June, with Martin now participating. That day, the trumpets and bass clarinet parts, played by four session musicians and conducted by Martin, were added to the track.\n\nMaginnis describes the opening of the song as \"a burst of howling guitar feedback and jubilant, church-like organ\", adding: \"The atmosphere hints at Harrison's fascination with Indian music and Hindu philosophy at the time, having a distinct, Eastern-flavored, droning undercurrent.\" Following the intro to \"I Feel Fine\" in 1964, \"It's All Too Much\" is a rare example of the Beatles' use of feedback on a recording and suggests the influence of Jimi Hendrix. Womack credits this guitar part to Harrison, who played his Epiphone Casino using \"the instrument's Bigsby [tremolo] bar in searing, full vibrato force\". Harrison later rued the prominence of the brass accompaniment, saying: \"To this day I am still annoyed that I let them mess it up with those damn trumpets. Basically, the song's quite good but, you know, messed up with those trumpets.\"\n\nThe Beatles carried out final mixing on \"It's All Too Much\", again at De Lane Lea, on 12 October 1967, while completing work on their \"Magical Mystery Tour\" EP. In the months since recording the song, Harrison had sworn off acid after visiting the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco in August, with Boyd, Taylor and others. He said he found himself disillusioned at how, rather than an enlightened micro-society, Haight-Ashbury seemed to be a haven for dropouts and drug addicts. Harrison and Lennon subsequently became avid supporters of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's Transcendental Meditation technique, after the Beatles had attended a seminar by the Maharishi in Bangor, Wales, in late August. While in Bangor, the group announced that they had given up taking hallucinogenic drugs – an about-turn after McCartney had caused controversy by publicly espousing the benefits of LSD in an interview with \"Life\" magazine, published in June.\n\nThe Beatles considered the song for inclusion in their 1967 TV film \"Magical Mystery Tour\". Instead, they selected it later that year for the soundtrack to the \"Yellow Submarine\" animated film, to meet their contractual obligations to supply United Artists with four new songs for the project. The version used in that 1968 film was a heavily edited version of the track, shortened to 2:22 through the inclusion of two of the original song's four verses and only the start of the long coda.\n\n\"It's All Too Much\" was remixed for inclusion on the \"Yellow Submarine\" album on 16 October 1968. The vocals and handclaps were processed using automatic double tracking, so allowing these parts to be split across the stereo image. For this version, the song was edited down from the original eight minutes to a running time of 6:28, making it the longest officially released Beatles track written by Harrison. The edit was achieved by cutting a 35-second portion from around the three-minute mark, thereby removing the third chorus and the fourth verse (the last of which, beginning with the line \"Time for me to look at you and you to look at me\", had appeared in the film), and by fading out before the final minute of the coda.\n\nDiscussing the various underground influences in \"Yellow Submarine\", author Stephen Glynn identifies the segment featuring \"It's All Too Much\" as being among the film's \"most daring sequences\". Led by art director Heinz Edelmann, the animation for the song reflects the influence of psychedelic artists such as Hapshash and the Coloured Coat, who in turn were inspired by the work of the nineteenth-century illustrator Aubrey Beardsley. Referring to London's UFO Club, for which the Hapshash team designed promotional posters, Glynn considers the scene to be a cinematic version of Unlimited Freak Out – \"a 'happening' that sought to create a totalising mind-expanding environment involving music, light and people\".\n\nMichael Frontani, an associate professor of communications, writes that, although the counterculture's Summer of Love ideology had largely given way to New Left-inspired activism by mid 1968, the \"countercultural ideal\" represented by the Beatles \"remained popular with the general audience\", and he describes \"Yellow Submarine\" as \"the purest, most arresting and most popular statement of that ideal\". \"It's All Too Much\" appears during the climax of the film, following Lennon's defeat of the Chief Blue Meanie's enforcer, the Flying Glove, through the power of the word \"Love\". In Womack's description, in the sequence for the song, the Beatles \"vanquish the evil Blue Meanies and celebrate as the colorful beauty of friendship and music have been restored to Pepperland\". Author George Case describes the same victory scene as \"a psychotropic cartoon dreamscape\" and an example of the Beatles' more overt allusions to the hallucinogenic experience. Speaking in 1999, Starr said of \"It's All Too Much\": \"that's the [track] that really sets the mood of the movie ... that's where the music and the movie really gel.\"\n\nThe film represented the final episode in the Beatles' psychedelic period, although the band had already returned to making more roots-based music at the start of 1968. Referring to the drug-inspired imagery that led Rank to pull \"Yellow Submarine\" from its UK cinema run, Glynn writes: \"Indeed, the imagery accompanying [Harrison's] 'Only a Northern Song' and 'It's All Too Much' only 'makes sense' when read as attempting an audio-visual recreation of the hallucinogenic state ...\"\n\nAn EP containing \"It's All Too Much\" and the three other new soundtrack songs had been scheduled for September 1968, but a full album was created instead. With the addition of the previously issued \"Yellow Submarine\" and \"All You Need Is Love\" to fill out side one of the LP, George Martin's orchestral pieces from the film made up the second side. Viewed as a secondary release beside the band's recently issued double LP, \"The Beatles\", the \"Yellow Submarine\" album appeared in January 1969, six months after the film's London premiere. In January 1996, \"It's All Too Much\" (backed by \"Only a Northern Song\") was issued on a jukebox-only single, pressed on blue vinyl. This release was part of a series of Beatles jukebox singles issued by Capitol Records' CEMA Special Markets division.\n\nRecalling the release of \"Yellow Submarine\" in his 1977 book \"The Beatles Forever\", Nicholas Schaffner described \"It's All Too Much\" as the only one of the new songs that appeared \"to have taken more than a few hours to write\". He added: \"[its] highlights include some searing Velvet Underground feedback and an unusually witty epigram that just about sums up the Spirit of '67: \"Show me that I'm everywhere, and get me home for tea.\"\" Rodriguez recognises the timing of the song's release on its public perception. While he notes that the recording was \"positively anarchic\" in mid-1967, by 1969, when it received widespread release, the song was \"slightly less groundbreaking and a little more reactionary to the psychedelic movement that the band itself had helped popularize\".\n\nAmong the contemporary reviews of the album, \"Beat Instrumental\" described \"It's All Too Much\" and \"Only a Northern Song\" as \"superb pieces\" that \"redeem\" side one. \"Record Mirror\"s reviewer said that it was the best-sounding track on \"Yellow Submarine\", adding: \"Beside the beauty of the organ, the absolute volume of it – even when the [record] player is turned down – is amazing. The song is basically of rock construction, but built around one endless note which trails behind.\" In his lengthy assessment of the track, Barry Miles of \"International Times\" wrote: \"Endless, mantric, a round, interwoven, trellised, tessellated, filigreed, gidouiled, spiralling is It's All Too Much [–] George's Indian-timed, with drums fading-in-and-out, spurts of life to a decaying note, multi-level, handclapping number ... High treble notes flicker like moths around the top register. Happy singalong music.\" In his 1998 book \"The Beatles Diary\", Miles praised it further as \"the most striking piece of psychedelia The Beatles ever recorded\" and concluded: \"Discordant, off-beat and effortlessly brilliant, the song was (alongside 'Taxman') Harrison's finest piece of Western rock music to date.\"\n\nAlthough \"Yellow Submarine\" has attained the status of a classic children's animated film, many Beatles biographers consider the band's post-\"Sgt. Pepper\" 1967 recordings to be substandard work. Among these authors, Mark Hertsgaard cites Martin's view that the soundtrack album was made up of \"bottom of the barrel\" material and dismisses \"It's All Too Much\" as \"little more than formless shrieking\". Ian MacDonald also holds the track in low regard, describing it as a \"protracted exercise in drug-mesmerised G-pedal monotony\". Discussing the lyrics, particularly the line \"Show me that I'm everywhere, and get me home for tea\", MacDonald considers the song to be \"the \"locus classicus\" of English psychedelia\" and he comments that in Britain, unlike in America, \"tradition, nature, and the child's-eye-view were the things which sprang most readily to the LSD-heightened Anglo-Saxon mind.\" Author and journalist Graham Reid highlights the same line as being the British equivalent of \"Tune in, turn on, drop out\", the phrase coined by Timothy Leary that came to define the American psychedelic experience.\n\nWriting for \"Rolling Stone\" in 2002, Greg Kot admired the song, saying: \"once again, a raga-flavored groove brings out Harrison's best in the walloping 'It's All Too Much.'\" That same year, Nigel Williamson of \"Uncut\" described it as \"a psychedelic classic\" that, had it been recorded earlier in 1967, \"would have made \"Sgt Pepper\" an even better album\". In the 2004 edition of \"The Rolling Stone Album Guide\", Rob Sheffield wrote: \"\"Yellow Submarine\" was a flat soundtrack rather than a real album, but here's a question: Why is George's 'It's All Too Much' not heralded as one of the top five all-time psychedelic freakouts in rock history?\" Sheffield features the track in his 2017 book \"Dreaming the Beatles\", where he refers to it as \"the great lost Beatle song – the one that deserves to be infinitely more famous than it is\", adding: \"It's where they really nailed the \"Sgt. Pepper\" sound – that combination of acid-rock momentum and brass-band frippery. 'It's All Too Much' would have been the second or third best song on \"Sgt. Pepper\" ...\" Richie Unterberger of AllMusic similarly considers \"Yellow Submarine\" to be \"inessential\" and describes the track as \"the jewel of the new songs ... resplendent in swirling [organ], larger-than-life percussion, and tidal waves of feedback guitar\" and \"a virtuoso excursion into otherwise hazy psychedelia\".<ref name=\"Unterberger/AM\"></ref>\n\nIn \"Mojo\"s \"The Beatles' Final Years Special Edition\" (2003), Peter Doggett acknowledged the comparative rarity of \"It's All Too Much\" within the Beatles canon and added: \"Yet it's one of the pinnacles of British acid-rock, its sleepwalking rhythm retaining a bizarrely contemporary feel today.\" Having included the track in his 2011 list of Harrison's \"10 Greatest Beatles Songs\", Joe Bosso of MusicRadar commented: \"At times the song seems to drift away with Harrison's dreamy verses, but just as quickly it's chopping down trees with explosive percussion and thunderous handclaps. Wild guitar breaks by both Harrison and John Lennon help to make It's All Too Much a dizzying treat.\"\n\nThe song featured in \"Mojo\"s 1997 list \"Psychedelia: The 100 Greatest Classics\", where Jon Savage described it as an \"aural pleasure\" that included \"mad brass and handclaps so luscious that they sound like the chewing of a thousand cows\". In July 2001, \"Uncut\" placed the song at number 43 on its list of \"The 50 Greatest Beatles Tracks\". Five year later, \"Mojo\" ranked it 85th on the magazine's list of \"The 101 Greatest Beatles Songs\". The editors credited \"It's All Too Much\" with inspiring the Krautrock genre, while Primal Scream singer Bobby Gillespie described it as \"a great piece of music\" that, in departing from the Beatles' more regimented approach, evokes \"the same feeling you get in 'Be-Bop-A-Lula' or a Muddy Waters or John Lee Hooker tune\".<ref name=\"Mojo/101 Greatest\"></ref> Writing for the website Ultimate Classic Rock, Dave Swanson considers \"It's All Too Much\" to be \"one of the band's most captivating works from the psychedelic era, and one of the Beatles' great lost songs\". In 2012, it was included on the iTunes compilation album \"Tomorrow Never Knows\", which the band's website described as a collection of \"the Beatles' most influential rock songs\". In 2018, the music staff of \"Time Out London\" ranked it at number 31 on their list of the best Beatles songs.\n\nFormer Gong guitarist Steve Hillage recorded \"It's All Too Much\" for his 1976 solo album, \"L\"<ref name=\"L/AM\"></ref> – a version that Unterberger highlights as \"a dazzling cover\" and Williamson terms \"stunning\". Produced by Todd Rundgren, the recording was also issued as a single.\n\nIn October 1976, Phil Sutcliffe of \"Sounds\" magazine described Hillage's adoption of both \"It's All Too Much\" and Donovan's \"Hurdy Gurdy Man\" as the \"policy statements\" for his solo career. Speaking to \"Trouser Press\" that same month, Hillage said he was drawn to the Beatles song because of its positive message, but especially its success in conveying joy without resorting to escapism.\n\nHillage included \"It's All Too Much\" in his concert performances; live versions from the late 1970s appear on his albums \"Live Herald\" (1979), \"\" (1992) and \"Rainbow 1977\" (2014). Reviewing \"BBC Radio 1 Live\" for AllMusic, Chris Nickson writes that Hillage's reading \"not only heightens the Eastern-flavored psychedelia, but lets [the guitarist] unleash some of his most scorching axe work yet, tearing into the song like a starving man given a five-course meal\".<ref name=\"Nickson/AM\"></ref>\n\nJourney also issued a recording of the song in 1976, on their album \"Look into the Future\". Besides the late 1970s renditions, according to Miles, the Beatles' \"It's All Too Much\" \"won fresh acclaim from a later wave of acid-rock adventurers\" during the early 1990s. The House of Love released a cover of the song as the B-side to \"Feel\", the first single from their 1992 album \"Babe Rainbow\". The previous year, Loves Young Nightmare recorded it (as \"All Too Much\") for \"Revolution No. 9: A Tribute to The Beatles in Aid of Cambodia\", a multi-artist compilation supplied with \"Revolver\" magazine; the album was reissued in the United States in 1997, following the popularity there of Britpop bands such as Oasis. The Church included the track on their 1999 covers album \"A Box of Birds\".\n\n\"It's All Too Much\" has been performed live by the Grateful Dead, by the latter's associated acts Ratdog and Phil Lesh and Friends, and by Yonder Mountain String Band. Other artists who have recorded the song include All About Eve, Paul Gilbert, the Violet Burning, Yukihiro Takahashi, and Rich Robinson.<ref name=\"Fontenot/About\"></ref> A version by former MC5 guitarist Wayne Kramer appeared on the 2003 Harrison tribute album \"\". My Darling Clementine recorded \"It's All Too Much\" for \"Yellow Submarine Resurfaces\", a multi-artist CD accompanying the July 2012 issue of \"Mojo\".\n\nExperimental musician Greg Davis and jazz singer-songwriter Chris Weisman recorded the track for their 2010 album \"Northern Songs\", a project that \"The Village Voice\" described as blending \"Beatlefolk\" with \"gongs, field recordings, and generally orchestrated nirvana\". The Flaming Lips performed \"It's All Too Much\" at the George Fest tribute concert in September 2014, with special guest Gingger Shankar playing violin. Consequence of Sound's reviewer described it as \"the most sonically pleasing song of the night\".\n\nAccording to Ian MacDonald and Kenneth Womack:\n\nThe Beatles\n\nAdditional musicians\n\n"}
{"id": "2254860", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2254860", "title": "Validus", "text": "Validus\n\nValidus is a fictional DC Comics supervillain, an enemy of the Legion of Super-Heroes and a member of the Fatal Five.\n\nValidus first appeared in \"Adventure Comics\" #352 and was created by Jim Shooter and Mort Weisinger.\n\nIn the latter half of the 30th century, an entity known as the Sun-Eater threatened to consume Earth's sun, thus destroying the solar system. Desperate to stop the Sun-Eater's efforts, Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes recruited the aid of the Fatal Five. They discovered that Validus was among their ranks, but had no idea of his true parental heritage. The Fatal Five reluctantly agreed to help the Legion, and the Sun-Eater's efforts were averted. Validus remained a loyal member of the Fatal Five, always ready to do Tharok's bidding. During one memorable altercation with the Legion, Validus killed Lyle Norg, the original Invisible Kid.\n\nIt was later revealed that Validus' origin supposedly stemmed from a diabolical plot by a powerful Legion foe. As revenge for his defeat in \"The Great Darkness Saga\", Darkseid kidnapped one of the identical twin children of Lightning Lad and Saturn Girl at birth. He then sent the newborn back in time, cursed with a monstrous body and near-mindlessness (that made him easily controlled by the likes of the Emerald Empress) with the idea that either the parent or the child would kill the other.\n\nYears later, Validus fell under Darkseid's influence yet again. He manipulated Validus against Lightning Lad, placing him in a situation where the Legionnaire would be forced to kill him to save the life of his other son, Graym. Thanks to the efforts of Saturn Girl, however, the plot was averted and both parents discovered that Validus was their child. Soon after, Validus reverted to his normal, human condition. His parents soon renamed him Garridan.\n\nDuring the \"Five Years Later\" era chronicled in \"Legion of Super-Heroes\" (vol. 4), it was revealed that Darkseid's tampering with Garridan's body chemistry had spawned a new virus which Brainiac 5 dubbed \"The Validus Plague\". Only natives of Winath and Titan (the homeworlds of Garridan's parents) were susceptible to the disease, but for them it was fatal. As a result, Garridan was forced to wear a containment suit, allowing him mobility yet keeping him in perpetual medical quarantine. His replacement in the reformed Fatal Five was a similar enigmatic behemoth named \"Mordecai\" by Leland McCauley IV.\n\nAfter the events of the \"Zero Hour\" miniseries, Legion continuity was rebooted entirely, and Validus' origin was changed considerably. He was no longer the child of Lightning Lad and Saturn Girl, Darkseid had nothing to do with his creation, and he was also significantly weaker. In the \"Threeboot\" continuity, Validus was the name of a nature spirit in the folklore of the planet of Winath, known as the Lord of Lightning. Mekt Ranzz was a member of a cult that worshipped him. Since the Ranzzes gained their powers and left the planet the cult has grown considerably, seemingly granting everyone on Winath lightning powers. This was later revealed as the product of nanomachines in their blood.\n\nOn the cover of \"Justice League of America\" (vol. 2) #13, it shows Validus as a member of the latest incarnation of the Injustice League. However, in the actual issue, he does not appear.\n\nValidus (alongside the other Fatal Five members) were among the villains in Superboy-Prime's Legion of Super-Villains. However, Garridan Ranzz (along with his twin brother Graym) was recently depicted as a young child living with Saturn Girl and Lightning Lad. Thus, it appears that Validus and Garridan are not the same being in current continuity; or that this Validus is from a different moment in time.\n\nThe classic Validus possessed tremendous superhuman strength, enabling him to easily overpower even the Silver Age Superboy; in fact, on one occasion, it took the combined strength of Kryptonian-level heroes Superboy, Mon-El, and Ultra Boy just to knock him down, and on another, Superboy estimated that Validus possessed twelve times his strength. Validus was shown to be strong enough to tear an entire planet apart with his bare hands. In addition, Validus could fire energy bolts from his brain that were powerful enough to incapacitate a Kryptonian or Daxamite with a single hit. He was extremely resistant to all forms of harm and sometimes seemed \"not even to notice\" super-powered attacks against him by members of the Legion. He was able to fend off even the Sun-Eater in order to rescue Princess Projectra (showing that he was not innately evil). He was also capable of flight through space and was immune to telepathy. His first appearance did define some limitations to his power: He could be held in a cell with thick inertron walls, and it was believed that he could be executed with a bombardment of \"anti-energy\" (although that was not demonstrated). Depictions of Validus' strength and intelligence were not consistent over time.\n\n\n\n"}

The company is best known for the \"Armored Core\" and \"Souls\" series, as well as \"Bloodborne\" and \"\".\n\nFromSoftware was founded as a productivity software developer in Tokyo, Japan, on November 1, 1986. Their first video game did not come until 1994, when they released \"King's Field\" as a launch title for the PlayStation. The game did not see a release in North America, although a 1995 sequel would later be released in North America bearing the same title, which was released as \"King's Field II\" in Japan. After releasing a third title in that series, FromSoftware moved on to release \"Echo Night\" as well as \"Shadow Tower\" in 1998. IGN would later note that the latter was \"effectively a \"King's Field\" follow-up\" as it shared many of the gameplay conventions with it. Also during this time FromSoftware would release \"Armored Core\", the first in a mech game series which would go on to spawn many sequels. The making of \"Armored Core\" solidified the company's development skills, and in July 1999, they released the multiplayer action game \"Frame Gride\" for the Sega Dreamcast.\n\nWhen the PlayStation 2 was launched in 2000, FromSoftware supported the system with two RPGs \"Eternal Ring\", which like the \"King's Field\" series is a first person RPG, and \"Evergrace\", a more conventional action RPG viewed from a third person perspective. In addition to these titles, FromSoftware published \"\", a stealth game that combines action and adventure elements. The company also released a pair of sequels to their PlayStation 1 offerings with \"King's Field IV\" and \"Shadow Tower Abyss\". FromSoftware also released the \"Lost Kingdom\" titles for the Gamecube, a competing sixth generation console. IGN would note however that during this generation FromSoftware's focus would shift from RPGs to mech games due in part to the success of the \"Armored Core\" series. In 2002, FromSoftware released the mech action game \"\" for the Xbox before entering the mobile game market, where they released another \"King's Field\" title. In 2004, they released another Xbox title, \"Metal Wolf Chaos.\" In 2005, FromSoftware would start to produce a series of licensed games based on the various anime properties under the banner \"Another Century's Episode\". In the same year, the company hosted the video game industry's first internship that let students experience game development through a game creation kit, \"Adventure Player\", for the PlayStation Portable. In 2008, FromSoftware underwent a stock split before entering the Nintendo Wii market to release \"\".\n\nIn April 2014, Kadokawa Corporation announced its intention to purchase the company from former shareholder Transcosmos. The deal was finalized on May 21, 2014. In December 2015, FromSoftware was nominated for developer of the year at The Game Awards 2015, but lost to CD Projekt Red. In January 2016, FromSoftware added a new studio in Fukuoka that focuses on creating computer-generated imagery (CGI) assets for their games.\n\nFromSoftware have developed for a wide range of platforms, including the Dreamcast, Nintendo DS, GameCube, PlayStation, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox, Xbox 360, Xbox One, PlayStation Portable, Wii, Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, and various mobile devices.\n\nWith fifteen titles developed, the \"Armored Core\" series is the studio's longest running franchise. The most recent title, \"\", was released worldwide in September 2013 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Earlier, less notable outside Japan, titles include the \"Enchanted Arms\", \"King's Field\", \"Chromehounds\", \"Otogi\", and \"Tenchu\" series, all of which have been met with mostly favorable reviews.\n\nIn 2009, they released \"Demon's Souls\" for the PlayStation 3, which brought them international exposure. Its spiritual successor, \"Dark Souls\", was released in 2011. In March 2014, \"Dark Souls II\", was released, while \"Dark Souls III\" was released in 2016. A title inspired by the \"Souls\" series, \"Bloodborne\", was released in March 2015. The \"Souls series\", along with \"Bloodborne\", received widespread critical acclaim, as well as strong sales domestically and internationally. They have also received a number of awards, primarily those for the role-playing genre, including multiple \"RPG of the Year\" and Game of the Year awards. Since release, \"Dark Souls\" and \"Bloodborne\" have been cited by many publications to be among the greatest games of all time.\n\nIn April 2016, FromSoftware revealed that they were working on a new intellectual property, as well as stating their intent to return to the \"Armored Core\" series. Two games, the PlayStation VR exclusive \"Déraciné\" and the multiplatform \"\", were announced at E3 2018. At E3 2019, an action role-playing game featuring the collaboration of FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki and \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" series author George R. R. Martin was announced, titled \"Elden Ring\".\n\nFromSoftware is known for releasing highly difficult titles, notably the \"Souls series\", \"Bloodborne\", and \"Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice\", that lack difficulty settings. FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki justified the lack of difficulty settings, stating, \"We don't want to include a difficulty selection because we want to bring everyone to the same level of discussion and the same level of enjoyment. So we want everyone...to first face that challenge and to overcome it in some way that suits them as a player. We want everyone to feel that sense of accomplishment. We want everyone to feel elated and to join that discussion on the same level. We feel if there's different difficulties, that's going to segment and fragment the user base. People will have different experiences based on that [differing difficulty level]. This is something we take to heart when we design games. It's been the same way for previous titles and it's very much the same with \"Sekiro\".\"\n"}

It breeds in lowlands from eastern Honduras to northwestern Colombia (from South Chocó to the upper Atrato) at up to altitude.\n\nThe grey-headed chachalaca is an arboreal species, found in thickets with emergent trees. The broad shallow nest is built of twigs and vines up in a tree, often partially screened by vines. The female lays three or four large rough-shelled white eggs and incubates them alone.\n\nThese are medium-sized birds, similar in general appearance to turkeys, with small heads, long strong legs and a long broad tail. They are typically long and weigh . They have fairly dull plumage, dark brown above and paler below. The head is dark grey, and the blackish tail is tipped with pale grey-brown. The primary flight feathers are rufous.\n\nIt can be mistaken for the plain chachalaca, \"O. vetula\", which has an isolated population that overlaps in northern Costa Rica, but it is larger, more rufous below, has a white tail tip, and lacks rufous in the wings.\n\nThe grey-headed chachalaca is less noisy than plain or rufous-vented chachalacas. It has a peeping \"white, white, white\" contact call and a chorus of raucous \"kraaak\" sounds, but does not give the \"chachalaca\" call of its relatives.\n\nThis is a social bird, often seen in family groups of 6–12. It walks along branches seeking the fruit and berries on which it feeds, or flies off with an ani-like flap and glide.\n\n"}
{"id": "2254896", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2254896", "title": "Helen of Troy (film)", "text": "Helen of Troy (film)\n\nHelen of Troy is a 1956 Warner Bros. WarnerColor epic film in CinemaScope, based on Homer's \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\". It was directed by Robert Wise, from a screenplay by Hugh Gray and John Twist, adapted by Hugh Gray and N. Richard Nash. The music score was by Max Steiner and the cinematography by Harry Stradling Sr.\n\nThe film stars Rossana Podestà, Stanley Baker, Sir Cedric Hardwicke and Jacques Sernas, with Niall MacGinnis, Maxwell Reed, Nora Swinburne, Robert Douglas, Torin Thatcher, Harry Andrews, Janette Scott, Ronald Lewis, Eduardo Ciannelli, Esmond Knight and a young Brigitte Bardot as Andraste, Helen's handmaiden, her first film production shot outside France.\n\nThe film retells the story of the Trojan War in 1100 B.C., albeit with some major changes from the Iliad's storyline; Paris of Troy (Jacques Sernas) sails to Sparta to secure a peace treaty between the two powerful city-states. His ship is forced to return to Troy in a storm after he has been swept overboard on the shore of Sparta. Paris is found by Helen, queen of Sparta (Rossana Podestà) with whom he falls in love. He goes to the palace where he finds Helen's husband, king Menelaus (Niall MacGinnis), Agamemnon (Robert Douglas), Odysseus (Torin Thatcher), Achilles (Stanley Baker) and many other Greek kings debating whether to go to war with Troy. Menelaus, who is denied by Helen, sees that his wife and Paris are in love and, pretending friendship, plots Paris' death.\n\nWarned by Helen, Paris flees and, after they are both nearly caught by the Spartans, takes Helen with him to Troy. Under the pretense of helping Menelaus regain his honor, the Greeks unite, and the siege of Troy begins. Much blood is shed in the long ordeal, with the Trojans blaming their plight on Paris and Helen until it turns out that the Greeks are solely after Troy's riches, not Helen. The siege culminates in Greek victory through the ruse of the legendary Trojan Horse. While trying to flee, Helen and Paris are cornered by Menelaus. Paris faces the Spartan king in single combat, but just as he wins the upper hand he is stabbed from behind, denying him a fair trial by arms. Helen is forced to return with Menelaus, but she is serene in the knowledge that in death she will be reunited with Paris in Elysium.\n\nThe film was made in Rome's Cinecittà Studios and in Punta Ala, Grosseto.\n\nThe scene of the Greek initial assault on the walls of Troy features a series of shots that are directly copied from a sequence in the Persian attack on Babylon in D. W. Griffiths' silent film classic \"Intolerance\". Some shots from this sequence would in turn be reused in the introductionary scenes of the 1963 film \"Jason and the Argonauts\".\n\nThis project makes several departures from the original story, including showing Paris as a hero and great leader, and most of the Greek lords as treacherous and opportunistic pirates who are using Helen's flight as an excuse to win the treasures of Troy. The 2003 miniseries sharing its name with this film would later partially re-employ this plot device.\n\nBosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" wrote that some parts were \"well done,\" including the Greek descent from the Trojan horse which \"has the air of great adventure that one expects from this tale,\" but \"the human drama in the legend ... is completely lost or never realized in the utter banalities of the script, in the clumsiness of the English dialogue and in the inexcusable acting cliches.\" \"Variety\" wrote, \"The word 'spectacular' achieves its true meaning when applied to Warner Bros.' 'Helen of Troy.' The retelling of the Homeric legend, filmed in its entirety in Italy, makes lavish use of the Cinemascope screen ... Action sequences alone should stir word-of-mouth.\" Edwin schallert of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote, \"'Helen of Troy' qualifies as a mighty film impression of history and legend ... The Warner film satisfies the demands for beauty, and also attains triumphant effects, which give real life to ancient battles with spear, bow and arrow, fire, sword and javelin. In their magnitude attacks on the walled city of Troy are awe-inspiring.\" Richard L. Coe of \"The Washington Post\" reported, \"The popcorn set and I had a glorious time at this epic ... I don't suppose the genteel set will go much for this one, but, boy, those crowd scenes, warriors falling to destruction, flames flaming, javelins nipping into a chest here and there.\" \"Harrison's Reports\" declared, \"The massiveness and opulence of the settings, the size of the huge cast, and the magnitude of the battle between the Greeks and the Trojans are indeed eye-filling ... Unfortnately, the breathtaking quality of the production values is not matched by the stilted story, which takes considerable dramatic license with the Homer version of the events leading up to the Trojan war, and which are at best only moderately interesting.\" \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" found the film \"uninterestingly dialogued and characterised ... The battle scenes, however, are vigorously and sometimes excitingly staged.\" John McCarten of \"The New Yorker\" wrote that the film \"hasn't enough life to hold your interest consistently. That's too bad, for toward the end there are those battle scenes and a fine impersonation of that wooden horse.\"\n\n\n\n"}

A wing composed mostly of foreigners, the MOI maintained an armed force to oppose the German occupation of France during World War II. The Main-d'œuvre immigrée was the \"Immigrant Movement\" of the FTP.\n\nThe last surviving member of the FTP-MOI's Manouchian Group, resistance fighter Arsène Tchakarian, died in August 2018.\n\nThe FTP-MOI groups were organized in the Paris region in 1941, at the same time as the \"Francs-tireurs et partisans\". Their ranks were filled with foreign communists living in France who were not part of the French Communist Party. Although integrated with the \"FTP\", these groups depended directly on Jacques Duclos, who passed on orders from the Communist International (Comintern). Members also included other immigrants, especially many young Hungarian writers, artists and intellectuals. Among them were the painter Sándor Józsa; sculptor István Hajdú (Étienne Hajdu); journalists László Kőrösi and Imre Gyomra; photographers Andras (André) Steiner, Lucien Hervé, and Ervin Marton; and printer Ladislas Mandel.\n\nThe FTP-MOI were among the most active and determined of the resistance groups; particularly because they were foreigners and mostly Jews, they were under the direct watch of the Vichy regime and the Germans. Without maintaining strict secrecy, they risked internment, deportation and death. Because they depended directly on the Comintern, with Duclos as their intermediary, they were often on the front line when the order to fight came from Moscow. The various French groups were more attentive to the French national political climate.\n\nThe Parisian groups were initially led by Boris Holban, then the poet turned activist Missak Manouchian. After Manouchian was arrested in 1943 and executed in February 1944, Holban took over again.\n\nThe FTP-MOI are particularly well known because of the highly publicized trial of numerous members of the Manouchian Group. Tracked, arrested and interrogated by the French police, the show trial of the 23 members was held in front of a German military tribunal at the Hôtel Continental. It began on 17 February 1944, lasted between two and four days, and after a 30-minute deliberation, the court reached the following verdict: All of the accused were condemned to death, with no possibility of appeal.\n\nAll but two were shot immediately on 21 February at Mont-Valérien. The execution of Olga Bancic was suspended for further enquiry and because French law prohibited executing women by firing squad. In a new sentence passed on her birthday of 10 May 1944 at Stuttgart, she was condemned to death. She was beheaded shortly after the sentencing. One accused, Migratulski, was transferred to French jurisdiction.\n\nFollowing the trial and executions, the Germans created a poster with a red background, featuring ten men of the Manouchian group with their names, photos and alleged crimes; it became known as \"l'Affiche Rouge\". The Germans distributed thousands of copies of the poster around the city to encourage Parisians to think of the partisans as criminal foreigners and \"not French\", and discourage resistance; instead, the Affiches Rouges inspired citizens to more actions. Some marked the posters with phrases such as \"Morts pour la France!\" (They died for France.)\n\nLed by Joseph Epstein and Missak Manouchian, the armed group had the following members:\n\n\nThe armed group \"Carmagnole\" in Lyon and the armed group \"Liberté\" in Grenoble had the following members:\n\n\nHerbert Herz was a member of both groups.\n\nThe 35th Brigade took its name from the thirty-five divisions of gunners of the International Brigades, to which Marcel (Mendel) Langer, head of the regional FTP-MOI, had claimed to belong. In February 1943, Langer was arrested carrying explosives. He was tried by the \"section spéciale\" of the Toulouse appeals court. The \"avocat général\", Lespinasse, demanded his execution and, on 21 March 1943, Langer was sentenced to death. He was executed on 23 July 1943.\n\nThe 35th Brigade then called themselves the Brigade Marcel Langer in his honor. Eighteen members were arrested by the Vichy police and handed over to the Germans. Two died of unknown causes on the train transporting them to be deported. Four were shot.\n\n\n\n\n(*) Former member of the 35 Brigade FTP-MOI \"Marcel Langer\"\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 1293 as a \"Studium Generale\" for the public, and was refounded in 1977. The University of Alcalá is especially renowned in the Spanish-speaking world for its annual presentation of the highly prestigious Cervantes Prize.\nThe University currently enrolls 28,336 students, 17,252 of whom are studying undergraduate degrees which are taught by a teaching staff of 2,608 professors, lecturers and researchers belonging to 24 departments. The University is also proud of its modern and efficient administration, which is carried out by the Administration and Services, comprising approximately 800 people.\n\nOne of the university's campuses, located in the city center, is housed partly in historic buildings which were once used by the Complutense University of Madrid, which was located in Alcalá from its medieval origins until it was moved to Madrid in 1836.\n\nOn May 20 of 1293, the king Sancho IV of Castile granted license to archbishop of Toledo. Gonzalo Pérez Gudiel to create a \"Studium Generale\" (as the university studies were then called through Europe) in Alcalá de Henares, \"with the same frankness for teachers and students, which were granted to General Study of Valladolid\". These studies, although quite modest, survived through time to link with the Cisneros refoundation. On July 17, 1459 Pope Pius II granted a bull, requested by the archbishop Alfonso Carrillo de Acuña, \"for the erection of three Cathedras of Arts and Grammar in this study of Alcalá\". These last chatedras, subsisting of that General Study of the 13th century, were integrated by Cisneros into the \"new\" university.\n\nIn 1499, Cardinal Cisneros founded a university in Alcalá de Henares. This university is known in historiography in different ways: Complutense University, Cisneriana University, University of Alcalá ... and reached, together with the University of Salamanca, a pre-eminent place among the Castilian universities during the Golden Age. However, it later entered a period of decline until in 1836 the government decreed its transfer to Madrid, renamed Central University of Madrid. This, in 1970, adopted the name of Complutense University of Madrid. The Complutense University of Madrid, in accordance with such historical trajectory, shows continuity with the university founded by Cisneros in 1499.\n\nBy a royal order of 29 October 1836, Queen Regent Maria Christina ordered The University to move to Madrid, where they took the name of Literary University and, in 1851, the Central University of Madrid. The University would be known under this name until its original name of \"Complutense\" was restored in the 1970s.\n\nIn 1975, after years of the buildings passing between various businesses, Complutense University opened its Alcalá branch as a means to decongest its growing student population. In 1977, the university was re-founded as \"the University of Alcalá de Henares,\" which later was shortened to \"the University of Alcalá\" in 1996. In 1998 Unesco named it a World Heritage site.\n\nToday's University of Alcalá preserves its traditional humanities faculties, a testimony to the university's special efforts, past and present, to promote and diffuse the Spanish language through both its studies and the Cervantes Prize, which is awarded annually by the King and Queen of Spain in the elegant sixteenth-century Paraninfo (Great Hall). The University has added to its time-honoured education in the humanities and social sciences new degree subjects in scientific fields such as health sciences or engineering, spread out across its different sites (the Alcalá Campus, the Science and Technology Campus and Guadalajara), all of which, together with the Science and Technology Park, are a key factor in its projection abroad, while also acting as a dynamo for activities in its local region.\n\nBecause of its rich tradition in the humanities, the University of Alcalá offers several programs in Spanish language and literature. Alcalingua, a Department of the University of Alcalá, offers Spanish language and culture courses to foreigners and develops materials for teaching Spanish as a foreign language. The University of Alcalá, together with EDUESPAÑA, grants the CEELE, \"Certificado de Calidad en la Enseñanza del Español como Lengua Extranjera\" (Quality Certificate for Teaching Spanish as a Foreign Language).\n\nThe University of Alcalá is a party to various bilateral agreements with institutions in non-European countries, above all with universities in Latin America and the USA. Some of these agreements stipulate exchanges for first and second stage students. Like Erasmus Programme students, foreign students who take advantage of these exchange schemes are exempt of payment of tuition fees to the University of Alcalá, though they must meet their own costs of travel, accommodation and upkeep.\nApplication to take part in these exchanges should be carried out in the university of origin. Once selected, the university of origin will inform the University of Alcalá.\n\nThe University of Alcalá offers degrees in five branches of knowledge: Arts and Humanities, Law and Social Sciences, Sciences, Health Sciences, and Engineering and Architecture. Its approximately 20,000 undergraduate students are spread across its three campuses:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe University of Alcalá has three campuses:\n\nThis campus occupies, among others, the buildings formerly used by the Universidad Complutense de Madrid when it was itself the Universidad de Alcalá. It includes the main administration building, the Faculties of Philosophy and Arts, Law, Economics and Business, and Documentation, as well as the Technical School of Architecture and Geodesy. Also located in the historical campus are Alcalingua (the University's Spanish language school), the Benjamin Franklin North American Studies University Research Institute, the Research Institute of Economic and Social Analysis, the Police Sciences University Research Institute, the Postgraduate School, the Institute of Educational Sciences, the Cisneros International Center for Historical Studies, the Cervantes Research Center, the Foreign Languages Center, the Institute of Business Organization and Management, the International Financial Training Center Foundation and the General Foundation of the University.\n\nThis campus includes the Faculties of Biology, Chemistry, Environmental Sciences, Pharmacy, Medicine, Nursing and Physiotherapy, as well as the School of Computer Engineering and the Polytechnic School. The students’ Residence Halls (the University Residential City and the Giner de los Ríos University Residence) are also located in this campus, as well as sports facilities, the Botanical Garden, Computer Services, numerous research centers and the Science and Technology Park.\n\nThe \"Multidepartamental\" building is home to the Faculties of Tourism and Nursing, and the Schools of Business Studies and Architecture. The Faculty of Education offers degrees in \nAudiovisual Communication and Modern Languages and Translation (the latter can also be studied at the historical campus in Alcalá).\n\n\n\nThe University of Alcalá is spread across three main sites:\n\n\nThe University of Alcalá has a network of 14 libraries spread across its three campuses. They offer extended hours year-round and during exam periods they never close.\n\nThe university also offers a wide range of sporting activities, including aikido, archery, badminton, fencing, rugby and yoga. There are also courses in snorkelling, horseriding and mountaineering, as well as other popular sports such as football.\n\nThe university has a hall for music, dance, theatre or flamenco, as well as the university choir, \"La Tuna\" (a traditional student music group), and the Film Club.\n\nMany buildings on the campus of Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Texas borrow architectural elements from those found at the University of Alcalá.\n\n\n"}

It was released on a non-album single in March 1968, as the B-side to \"Lady Madonna\". The song was the first Harrison composition to be issued on a Beatles single and reflects the band's embrace of Transcendental Meditation, which they were studying in India under Maharishi Mahesh Yogi at the time of the single's release. After \"Love You To\" and \"Within You Without You\", it was the last of Harrison's three songs from the Beatles era that demonstrate an overt Indian classical influence and are styled as Indian pieces. The lyrics are a rendering of a poem from the Taoist \"Tao Te Ching\", which he set to music on the recommendation of Juan Mascaró, a Sanskrit scholar who had translated the passage in his 1958 book \"Lamps of Fire\".\n\nHarrison recorded the instrumental track for \"The Inner Light\" in Bombay in January 1968, during the sessions for his \"Wonderwall Music\" soundtrack album. It is the only Beatles studio recording to be made outside Europe and introduced Indian instruments such as sarod, shehnai and pakhavaj to the band's sound. The musicians on the track include Aashish Khan, Hanuman Jadev and Hariprasad Chaurasia. Aside from Harrison's lead vocal, recorded in London, the Beatles' only contribution came in the form of group backing vocals over the song's final line. In the decade following its release, the song became a comparative rarity among the band's recordings; it has subsequently appeared on compilation albums such as \"Rarities\", \"Past Masters, Volume Two\" and \"Mono Masters\".\n\n\"The Inner Light\" has received praise from several music critics and musicologists for its melodic qualities and its evocation of the meditation experience. Jeff Lynne and Anoushka Shankar performed the song at the Concert for George tribute in November 2002, a year after Harrison's death. An alternative take of the 1968 instrumental track was released in 2014 on the remastered \"Wonderwall Music\" CD. Screenwriter Morgan Gendel named a of the television series \"\" as an homage to the song. In 2020, Harrison's Material World Foundation announced The Inner Light Challenge, an initiative to raise funds for the MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund, Save the Children and Médecins Sans Frontières in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn his autobiography, \"I, Me, Mine\", George Harrison recalls that he was inspired to write \"The Inner Light\" by Juan Mascaró, a Sanskrit scholar at Cambridge University. Mascaró had taken part in a debate, televised on \"The Frost Programme\" on 4 October 1967, during which Harrison and John Lennon discussed the merits of Transcendental Meditation with an audience of academics and religious leaders. In a subsequent letter to Harrison, dated 16 November, Mascaró expressed the hope that they might meet again before the Beatles departed for India, where the group were to study meditation with their guru, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Mascaró enclosed a copy of his book \"Lamps of Fire\", an anthology of religious writings, including from Lao-Tzu's \"Tao Te Ching\". Having stated his admiration for the spiritual message in Harrison's composition \"Within You Without You\", Mascaró enquired: \"might it not be interesting to put into your music a few words of Tao, for example no. 48, page 66 of \"Lamps\"?\"\n\nHarrison wrote the song during a period when he had undertaken his first musical project outside the Beatles, composing the soundtrack to the Joe Massot-directed film \"Wonderwall\", and continued to study the Indian sitar, partly under the tutelage of Ravi Shankar. When writing \"The Inner Light\", he made minimal alterations to the translated Lao-Tzu text and used the same title that Mascaró had used. In \"I, Me, Mine\", Harrison says of the changes required to create his second verse:\nIn the original poem, the verse says \"Without going out of \"my\" door, \"I\" can know the ways of heaven.\" And so to prevent any misinterpretations – and also to make the song a bit longer – I did repeat that as a second verse but made it: \"Without going out of your door / You can know all things on earth / Without looking out of your window / You can know the ways of heaven\" – so that it included everybody.\n\nAfter \"Within You Without You\", \"The Inner Light\" was the second composition to fully reflect Harrison's immersion in Eastern spiritual concepts, particularly meditation, an interest that had spread to his Beatles bandmates and to the group's audience and peers. The lyrics espouse meditation as a means to genuine understanding. Theologian Dale Allison describes the song as a \"hymn\" to quietism and comments that, in their attempt to \"relativize and disparage knowledge of the external world\", the words convey Harrison's enduring worldview. Author John Winn notes that Harrison had presaged the message of \"The Inner Light\" in an August 1967 interview, when he told New York DJ Murray Kaufman: \"The more you learn, the more you know that you don't know anything at all.\" Writing in his study of Harrison's musical career, Ian Inglis similarly identifies a precedent in the song \"It's All Too Much\", where Harrison sings: \"The more I learn, the less I know.\"\n\n\"The Inner Light\" was Harrison's third song in the Indian musical genre, after \"Love You To\" and \"Within You Without You\". While those earlier songs had followed the Hindustani (North Indian) system of Indian classical music, as sitar- and tabla-based compositions, \"The Inner Light\" is closer in style to the Carnatic (or South Indian) temple music tradition. Harrison's progression within the genre reflected his concept for the \"Wonderwall\" soundtrack – namely, that the assignment allowed him to create an \"anthology\" of Indian music and present a diverse range of styles and instrumentation.<ref name=\"White/Musician p 56\"></ref>\n\nThe composition is structured into three instrumental passages separated by two sections of verse. The buoyant mood of the instrumental sections – set to what author Peter Lavezzoli describes as \"a raucous 4/4 rhythm\" – contrasts with the gentle, meditative portions containing the verses. The contrast is reflected in the lead instruments that Harrison would use on the recording: whereas sarod and shehnai, supported by pakhavaj, are prominent during the musical passages, the softer-sounding bansuri (bamboo flute) and harmonium accompany the singing over the verses, as the sarod provides a response to each line of the vocal. In the last instrumental section, Harrison incorporates the conclusion of Lao-Tzu's poem, beginning with the line \"Arrive without travelling\".\n\nThe melody conforms to the pitches of Mixolydian mode, or its Indian equivalent, the Khamaj thaat. Musicologist Dominic Pedler writes that the tune features unusual tritone intervals, which, together with the musical arrangement, ensure that the song is far removed from standard \"pop tunes\". In a further departure from Harrison's previous forays into Indian music, both of which made extensive use of single-chord drone, the melody allows for formal chord changes: over the verses, the dominant E major alternates with F minor, before a move to A over the line \"The farther one travels the less one knows\".\n\nIn the opening words (\"Without going out\"), the melody uses what Pedler terms a \"hauntingly modal\" G-B-D tritone progression as, within the song's tonic key (of E), the 3rd note heads towards the flat 7th. Musicologist Walter Everett likens this ascending arpeggiation of the diminished triad to a melodic feature in \"Within You Without You\" (over that song's recurring phrase \"We were talking\"). \"The Inner Light\" is an example of Harrison creating ambiguity about the tonic key, a technique that Pedler recognises as a characteristic of Harrison's spiritually oriented songwriting.\n\nHaving used London-based Indian musicians from the Asian Music Circle on \"Love You To\" and \"Within You Without You\", Harrison recorded \"The Inner Light\" in India with some of the country's foremost contemporary classical players. In early January 1968, he travelled to HMV Studios in Bombay to record part of the score for \"Wonderwall\", much of which would appear on his debut solo album, \"Wonderwall Music\". The day after completing the soundtrack recordings, on 13 January, Harrison taped additional pieces for possible later use, one of which was the instrumental track for \"The Inner Light\". Five takes of the song were recorded on a two-track recorder.\n\nThe musicians at the sessions were recruited by Shambhu Das, who had assisted in Harrison's sitar tuition on his previous visit to Bombay, in 1966, and Vijay Dubey, the head of A&R for HMV Records in India. The line-up on the track was Aashish Khan (sarod), Mahapurush Misra (pakhavaj), Hanuman Jadev (shehnai), Hariprasad Chaurasia (bansuri) and Rijram Desad (harmonium). In Lavezzoli's estimation, although these instruments are more commonly associated with the Hindustani discipline, the performers play them in a South Indian style, which adds to the Carnatic identity of the song. The recording features tabla tarang over the quiet, vocal interludes. Author Simon Leng refutes the presence of the oboe-like shehnai, however, saying that this part was played on an esraj, a bow-played string instrument. As with the \"Wonderwall\" selections recorded at HMV, Harrison directed the musicians but did not perform on the instrumental track.\n\nHarrison completed the song in London during sessions for a new Beatles single, which was intended to cover their absence while the group were in Rishikesh, India, with the Maharishi. Once the Bombay recording had been transferred to four-track tape, Harrison recorded his vocal part for \"The Inner Light\" on 6 February, at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios). Lacking confidence in his ability to sing in so high a register, he had to be coaxed by Lennon and Paul McCartney into delivering the requisite performance. Two days later, McCartney and Lennon overdubbed backing vocals at the very end of the song, over the words \"Do all without doing\".\n\n\"The Inner Light\" was held in high regard by Harrison's bandmates, particularly McCartney, and was selected as the B-side for the forthcoming single.<ref name=\"Fontenot/About\"></ref> It was the first Harrison composition to appear on a Beatles single, in addition to being the only Beatles studio recording made outside Europe. Everett writes that Lennon's admiration for the track was evident from his subsequent creation of the song \"Julia\" through \"a very parallel process\" – in that instance, by adapting a work by Kahlil Gibran. Although Harrison had served as the producer at the Bombay session, only George Martin received a production credit for \"The Inner Light\".\n\nThe song was issued as the B-side of \"Lady Madonna\" on 15 March 1968 in the UK, with the US release following three days later. While Chris Welch of \"Melody Maker\" expressed doubts about the hit potential of the A-side, \"Billboard\" magazine commented on the aptness of \"The Inner Light\", given the band's concurrent \"meditation spell\". \"Cash Box\"s reviewer wrote: \"Lyrics from the transcendental meditation school and near-Eastern orchestrations on a very interesting coupler that could show sales as strong as ['Lady Madonna'].\" In America, the song charted independently on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for one week, placing at number 96. In Australia, it was listed with \"Lady Madonna\", as a double A-side, when the single topped the \"Go-Set\" national chart.\n\nIn the description of author and critic David Quantick, whereas \"Lady Madonna\" represented a departure from the Beatles' psychedelic productions of the previous year, \"The Inner Light\" was an \"accurate indication\" of the group's mindset in Rishikesh. Paul Saltzman, a Canadian film-maker who had been inspired by the Beatles' adoption of Indian musical and philosophical themes, joined the band at the Maharishi's ashram and recalls hearing the song there for the first time. He said he found Harrison's perspective on meditation profoundly moving,<ref name=\"Kilachand/LiveMint\"></ref> particularly when Harrison told him that, while the Beatles had achieved wealth and fame in abundance, \"It isn't love. It isn't health. It isn't peace inside, is it?\"\n\nThe Beatles' 1968 visit to Rishikesh resulted in a surge of interest in Indian culture and spirituality among Western youth, but it also marked the end of the band's overtly Indian phase. From June that year, Harrison abandoned his efforts to master the sitar and returned to the guitar as his principal instrument. In an interview in September, Harrison discussed his renewed interest in rock music and described \"The Inner Light\" as \"one of my precious things\".\n\nAuthor Nicholas Schaffner wrote in 1977 that \"The Inner Light\" \"proved to be the best – and last\" example of Harrison directly incorporating Indian music into the Beatles' work. Schaffner paired it with \"Within You Without You\" as raga rock songs that \"feature haunting, exquisitely lovely melodies\", and as two pieces that could have been among Harrison's \"greatest achievements\" had they been made with his bandmates' participation. Bruce Eder of AllMusic describes the same tracks as \"a pair of beautiful songs … that were effectively solo recordings\". Ian MacDonald likens the song's \"studied innocence and exotic sweetness\" to recordings by the Incredible String Band and concludes: \"'The Inner Light' is both spirited and charming – one of its author's most attractive pieces.\"\n\nWriting for \"Mojo\" magazine in 2003, John Harris similarly admired it as Harrison's \"loveliest addition of Indian music to The Beatles' repertoire\". In Ian Inglis' view: \"it is the extraordinary synthesis of separate musical and lyrical traditions (in this case, Indian instrumentation, Chinese philosophy, and Western popular music) that distinguishes the song. Harrison's uncharacteristically warm vocal weaves in and around the delicate, almost fragile, melody to deliver a simple testimony to the power of meditation ...\" With regard to the song's influence, Inglis recognises Harrison's espousal of Eastern spirituality as \"a serious and important development that reflected popular music's increasing maturity\", and a statement that prepared rock audiences for later religious pronouncements by Pete Townshend, Carlos Santana, John McLaughlin, Cat Stevens and Bob Dylan.\n\nNick DeRiso of the music website Something Else! considers \"The Inner Light\" to be one of its composer's \"most successful marriages of raga and rock\" and, through Harrison's introduction of instruments such as sarod, shehnai and pakhavaj, a key recording in the evolution of the 1980s world music genre. While admiring the song's transcendent qualities, Everett quotes the ethnomusicologist David Reck, who wrote in 1988: \"Most memorable is the sheer simplicity and straightforwardness of the haunting modal melody, somehow capturing perfectly the mood and truth and aphoristic essence of the lyrics.\"\n\nA stereo mix of \"The Inner Light\" was created at Abbey Road on 27 January 1970 for what Beatles recording historian Mark Lewisohn terms \"some indefinable future use\". On this later mix, the opening instrumental section differs slightly from that on the original, mono version.\n\nFollowing its initial release in 1968, \"The Inner Light\" became one of the rarest Beatles recordings.<ref name=\"Unterberger/AM\"></ref> Although it appeared on \"Por Siempre Beatles\", a 1971 Spanish compilation album, the song was not available on a British or American album until its inclusion on \"Rarities\", which was originally issued as a disc in the 1978 box set \"The Beatles Collection\" before receiving an independent UK release. The 1980 US compilation titled \"Rarities\" also featured \"The Inner Light\", again in its mono form. The stereo mix was first released as the opening track on a bonus EP, titled \"The Beatles\", issued in the UK in December 1981 as part of \"The Beatles EP Collection\". The song was issued on CD in 1988, in stereo, on \"Past Masters, Volume Two\". The mono mix was subsequently included on the Beatles' \"Mono Masters\" compilation.\n\nFor the Beatles' 2006 remix album \"Love\", created for the Cirque du Soleil stage show, the song was segued onto the end of \"Here Comes the Sun\". This mashup begins with Harrison singing \"Here Comes the Sun\" over the tabla part from \"Within You, Without You\" and ends with Indian instrumentation from \"The Inner Light\".\n\nIn 2014, an alternative instrumental take of the song was issued as a bonus track on Harrison's \"Wonderwall Music\" remastered CD. The recording begins with a short studio discussion,<ref name=\"DeRiso/SomethingElse\"></ref> as Harrison instructs the Bombay musicians.\n\nHaving covered \"Within You Without You\" in 1967, the Soulful Strings included \"The Inner Light\" on their album \"Another Exposure\" the following year. Junior Parker recorded the song, releasing a version on his 1971 album with Jimmy McGriff, \"The Dudes Doin' Business\". Later in the 1970s, the song's title was appropriated for one of the first international Beatles fanzines.\n\nJeff Lynne, who worked frequently with Harrison after the Beatles' break-up, sang \"The Inner Light\" at the Concert for George tribute, held at London's Royal Albert Hall on 29 November 2002, a year after the former Beatle's death. In what Simon Leng describes as \"a wonderfully eloquent duet\", Lynne performed the song with Anoushka Shankar, who played the original sarod part on sitar. Lynne and Shankar were accompanied by Harrison's son Dhani (on keyboards and backing vocals) and an ensemble of Indian musicians that included percussionist Tanmoy Bose (on dholak), Rajendra Prasanna (shehnai) and Sunil Gupta (flute).\n\nThe song appeared partway through the concert's opening, Indian music segment, which was performed by Shankar and otherwise composed by her father, Ravi Shankar, who had continued to be Harrison's friend and mentor until his death. Inglis comments that, in its context at the Concert for George, \"['The Inner Light'] does not appear at all out of place among the Indian folk and classical compositions that surround it.\" Reviewing the \"Concert for George\" film for \"The Guardian\", James Griffiths admired Lynne's reading of the song as a \"particularly sublime version\".\n\nIn June 1992, the American television series \"\" aired an episode titled \"\", which went on to win the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. The plot centres around the show's main character, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, temporarily living in a dream-like state on an unfamiliar planet, during which decades elapse relative to a few minutes in reality.<ref name=\"StarTrek/InnerLight\"></ref> An avowed fan of the Beatles, screenwriter Morgan Gendel titled the episode after Harrison's song.\n\nIn an email to the \"Star Trek\" blog site Soul of Star Trek, Nick Sagan, another of the show's screenwriters, suggested that the song's lyrics express the \"ability to experience many things without actually going anywhere – and that's what happens to Picard\". In his subsequent post on the same site, Gendel confirmed this similarity, saying that the Beatles track \"captured the theme of the show: that Picard experienced a lifetime of memories all in his head\". When discussing the episode on the official \"Star Trek\" website in 2013, Gendel concluded: \"If you Google 'Inner Light + song' you’ll get the Beatles tune and an acknowledgment of my \"TNG\" homage to it back-to-back … that might be the best gift my authorship of this episode has given me.\"\n\nIn 2020, Harrison's Material World Foundation announced The Inner Light Challenge, an initiative to raise funds for the MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund, Save the Children and Médecins Sans Frontières in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Foundation pledged to donate up to $100,000 for each \"'Inner Light' moment\" shared on social media, whether a portion or a single line from the song.\n\nDhani Harrison posted a performance of \"The Inner Light\" on Facebook, while Harrison's widow, Olivia, said of the song: \"These lyrics sung by George are a positive reminder to all of us who are isolating, in quarantine or respecting the request to shelter in place. Let's get and stay connected at this difficult time. There are things we can do to help and we invite you to share your Inner Light.\"\n\nAccording to Peter Lavezzoli and Kenneth Womack:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2254928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2254928", "title": "Old Brown Shoe", "text": "Old Brown Shoe\n\n\"Old Brown Shoe\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles. Written by George Harrison, the group's lead guitarist, it was released on a non-album single in May 1969, as the B-side to \"The Ballad of John and Yoko\". The song was subsequently included on the band's compilation albums \"Hey Jude\", \"1967–1970\" and \"Past Masters, Volume Two\". Although it remains a comparative rarity in the band's catalogue, several music critics view it as one of Harrison's best compositions from the Beatles era and especially admire his guitar solo on the track.\n\nThe lyrics to \"Old Brown Shoe\" address the concept of duality while its rhythm is partly in the ska style. The Beatles rehearsed the song during the sessions for their \"Let It Be\" album in January 1969. Harrison subsequently taped a solo demo of the song, along with two other compositions that the band had overlooked: \"Something\" and \"All Things Must Pass\". The group recorded the song formally in April, during the early sessions for \"Abbey Road\".\n\nThe 1969 demo was released on the Beatles' \"Anthology 3\" compilation in 1996. A concert version by Harrison was included on his 1992 album \"Live in Japan\". Gary Brooker performed the song at the Concert for George tribute in November 2002, held at London's Royal Albert Hall a year after Harrison's death.\n\nGeorge Harrison began writing \"Old Brown Shoe\" in late 1968 on a piano rather than guitar, his main instrument.<ref name=\"Williamson/Uncut\"></ref> The song's rhythm suggests the influence of ska. In his 1980 autobiography, \"I, Me, Mine\", Harrison says that the lyrical content started as a study in opposites and addresses \"the duality of things\". This idea was also prevalent in the Beatles' 1967 single \"Hello, Goodbye\", which Paul McCartney had written as an exercise in word association. For Harrison, the concept of duality also appealed on a philosophical level, consistent with his interest in Eastern religion. Neil Aspinall, the Beatles' assistant, later recalled Harrison employing the metaphysical theme of opposites to disperse some Hells Angels who had taken up residence in the Beatles' Apple headquarters over Christmas 1968 and refused to leave.<ref name=\"Scorsese/LITMW\"></ref> According to theologian Dale Allison, \"Old Brown Shoe\" is a further reflection of Harrison's interest in \"dualities and contradictions\", but stated in terms that avoid the religiosity evident in much of his songwriting.\n\nBefore returning to England for Christmas, Harrison spent time with Bob Dylan and the Band in upstate New York. The visit allowed Harrison to experience a musical camaraderie that had been absent in the Beatles over much of 1968, and inspired him as he emerged as a prolific songwriter. Author and critic Ian MacDonald identifies the \"hood-eyed spirit\" of Dylan in the song's \"dusty shuffle-beat\" and ironic lyrics, while recognising the \"surprising and graphic\" chord progression as typical of Harrison's work. Author Alan Clayson also detects a Dylan influence in the rhythm, which he calls a \"'Highway 61 Revisited' chug\".\n\"Old Brown Shoe\" is in the key of C major, although its chords also suggest the latter's relative minor key, A minor. The time signature is 4/4 throughout. Following a four-bar introduction, the song's structure comprises two verses, a bridge, an instrumental verse, followed by a second bridge, a final verse and the outro.\n\nThe verse employs blues-inflected C7 and D7 chords (or I7 and I7 chords in Roman numeral analysis) before an increase in harmonic movement is marked by changes to F, A, F, E augmented and A minor. The verses avoid the expected plagal cadence by resolving with the relative minor chord rather than I7. In achieving this via the augmented chord, a C note resonates through the final changes, a device that musicologist Dominic Pedler cites among the Beatles' most effective uses of augmented chords. The bridge is structured in familiar 1960s rock fashion with its reliance on V and IV (G and F) chords. The section again resolves unusually, however; rather than using the expected D7 chord before exiting with a return to G, a disguised imperfect cadence is achieved through a dissonant iv diminished chord (Fdim7) before the final V chord. Among other musicologists' assessments, Walter Everett considers that the composition's \"A/C duality\" fits well with Harrison's lyrical theme, while Alan Pollack highlights the flat VI (A) chord in the verse and the frequent bluesy flat 3rd and 7th notes alongside the I7 chords.\n\nMusic critic Tim Riley says the lyrics represent \"a witty and oblique look at love, delivered with sardonic flair\", as typified by the opening verse: \"I want a love that's right / Right is only half of what's wrong / I want a short-haired girl / Who sometimes wears it twice as long\". He views the reference to \"wear[ing] rings on every finger\" as a nod to Ringo Starr. The song's title is referred to only as an item that the singer declares he is \"stepping out\" of. According to music journalist Graham Reid, \"Old Brown Shoe\" reflects Harrison's growing confidence as a songwriter. He interprets the message as the guitarist \"straining against the constraints of the Beatles ('the zoo'?)\" during a period when, as the lyrics state, he himself was \"changing faster than the weather\".<ref name=\"Reid/Elsewhere\"></ref>\n\nThe Beatles rehearsed \"Old Brown Shoe\" several times over three days, beginning on 27 January 1969, during the \"Let It Be\" sessions at Apple Studio in London. Harrison still played piano on the song and the lyrics were complete. The run-throughs on 28 January included contributions from guest keyboardist Billy Preston, who supplied fills on Hammond organ. The tapes from that day show John Lennon struggling with the guitar part; in Everett's description, his playing suggests he was \"stymied or disinterested\". At this point, Starr had devised a drum pattern on the off-beat. The band gave considerable time to the song but chose not to record it for the album.\n\nHarrison made a solo demo of the song at EMI Studios (subsequently Abbey Road Studios), featuring piano and vocal, and two overdubbed electric guitar parts. The session took place on 25 February, his 26th birthday, and also included solo recordings of \"Something\" and \"All Things Must Pass\", which were similarly overlooked for inclusion on \"Let It Be\". Harrison played these versions of \"Old Brown Shoe\" and \"Something\" to Joe Cocker, who accepted Harrison's offer to record the latter song. Author Simon Leng describes \"Old Brown Shoe\" as \"the most complete in conception\" of the three demos, with an arrangement that contains several of the main elements present in the Beatles' subsequent recording. The demos were released on the band's 1996 outtakes compilation \"Anthology 3\".\n\nThe Beatles revisited \"Old Brown Shoe\" when they were in need of a B-side for their next single, \"The Ballad of John and Yoko\", Lennon's account of his and Yoko Ono's recent wedding and honeymoon. The song's recording took place on 16 and 18 April 1969, during the early sessions for the band's \"Abbey Road\" album. The 16 April session was the first at EMI Studios for the full group since October the previous year, when they completed recording for their self-titled double album (also known as the \"White Album\"), and was given over entirely to songs written by Harrison. The line-up on the basic track was Harrison on lead guitar, Lennon on rhythm guitar, McCartney on tack piano, and Starr on drums. Four takes were needed to achieve a satisfactory performance. Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn comments on the band's tight ensemble playing, evident from the studio tapes, and how focused each musician sounds in his contribution.\n\nClayson recognises the \"undercurrent of bottleneck\" in Harrison's main guitar riff as anticipating his slide guitar style, a technique he first embraced in December 1969 while on tour with Delaney & Bonnie and Friends. The unusual bass sound over the song's bridges was achieved by tracking the bass with the lead guitar, replicating the bass line that Harrison had played on his demo. Everett states that it was McCartney's Fender Jazz Bass doubled with Harrison's Telecaster, both playing chromatically moving arpeggiations in a similar manner to the bridge guitars in \"And Your Bird Can Sing\". In a 1987 interview for \"Creem\" magazine, however, Harrison recalled that he was the bass guitarist on the track, rather than McCartney. When the interviewer, J. Kordosh, suggested that the bass part \"sounds like McCartney was going nuts again\", Harrison replied: \"That was me going nuts. I’m doing [on the bass] exactly what I do on the guitar.\"<ref name=\"Kordosh/Creem\"></ref>\n\nHarrison recorded his lead vocal in a corner of the studio, to capture a natural reverberation from the room. The backing vocals were sung by Lennon and McCartney. Also present during the vocal overdubs were the Aerovons, an American band who had based their sound and image on the Beatles, and had come to London to record at EMI. Tom Hartman, the Aerovons' singer and guitarist, recalled that the Beatles attempted the line \"Who knows, baby, you may comfort me\" countless times, trying to perfect their performance. According to author Elliot Huntley, after Lennon had made derogatory remarks about Harrison's songwriting in January, he now sounded \"audibly excited\" by \"Old Brown Shoe\" in his \"enthusiastic and energetic backing vocals\" on the song. The Beatles devoted the rest of the session to taping a basic track for \"Something\", although it was later discarded as the band chose to record a new version the following month.\nHarrison completed the \"Old Brown Shoe\" recording alone on 18 April. He first overdubbed a guitar solo that Everett describes as \"stinging\" and \"highly Claptonesque\", played on a Telecaster with the sound coloured through a Leslie speaker and given automatic double tracking (ADT) treatment and \"sent wild to both channels\". Harrison then added a Hammond organ part, replacing Lennon's rhythm guitar contribution from the previous session. Although Chris Thomas supervised the 18 April overdubbing session, George Martin was credited as the song's sole producer.\n\nIn a 1980 interview, Lennon said that he was responsible for the choice of \"Old Brown Shoe\" as the B-side of \"The Ballad of John and Yoko\". The single was released in the United Kingdom (as Apple R 5786) on 30 May 1969 and in the United States (as Apple 2531) on 4 June. It marked the second time that a Harrison composition had been included on a Beatles single in the UK or the US, following \"The Inner Light\" in March 1968, although his song \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" had also been the B-side of \"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\", a single culled from the White Album and issued in most countries other than the UK and the US. In the UK, the song increased the public's recognition of Harrison as a songwriter, after \"Badge\", which he co-wrote with Eric Clapton, had been a hit single for Cream that spring and established him as a composer outside the Beatles.\n\nIn the US, Apple Records issued the record in a picture sleeve featuring shots of the four Beatles and Ono in the garden of McCartney's London home. On the reverse side of the sleeve, the photo included a dark brown shoe placed in a bush in front of the five figures. In the opinion of author Bruce Spizer, this shot, taken by Linda McCartney, shows Harrison, McCartney and Starr in better humour than in the shot used on the front of the sleeve, where the three bandmates appear uncomfortable with having to pose behind Ono and Lennon.\n\nWhile the A-side's chart performance in the US was hindered by a radio ban, due to the song's allegedly blasphemous lyrics, \"Old Brown Shoe\" failed to place on any of the three charts there. It was listed with \"The Ballad of John and Yoko\", as a double A-side, when the single topped Australia's \"Go-Set\" National Top 40. The song's first appearance on an album was in February 1970 when it was included on the North American release \"Hey Jude\".<ref name=\"Unterberger/AM\"></ref> It subsequently appeared on the 1973 compilation \"1967–1970\" and, following the standardisation of the Beatles' catalogue for compact disc in 1987, \"Past Masters, Volume Two\".\n\nIan MacDonald admires \"Old Brown Shoe\" as one of its author's \"most forceful pieces\" and \"an archetypal B-side from an era when B-sides were worth flipping a single for\". Walter Everett says the voice leading and harmony on \"Old Brown Shoe\" are \"far more subtle and interesting\" than such qualities in \"The Ballad of John and Yoko\", and views its dualistic theme as \"more interesting\" than McCartney's lyrics in \"Hello, Goodbye\". Tim Riley deems the song \"at least as good a rocker as 'Savoy Truffle'\" and, like \"The Inner Light\", an example of the Beatles continuing their tradition of offering high-quality and musically diverse B-sides. He describes Harrison's guitar solo as \"daring\" and a performance that \"rises and falls with astonishing fluidity and control\".\n\nDespite its inclusion on some of their compilation albums, \"Old Brown Shoe\" has remained a comparative rarity in the band's catalogue. Writing for \"Rolling Stone\" in 2002, Greg Kot described it as \"dark, droll, rollicking\" and arguably Harrison's \"most underrated Beatles composition\". In his overview of Harrison's career for \"Goldmine\" that same year, Dave Thompson said that \"Old Brown Shoe\" was one of five Harrison-written songs that \"rank among the finest Beatles compositions of the group's final years\". Conversely, Richie Unterberger of AllMusic deems it \"one of the less memorable late-'60s Beatles outings\", citing its obscure lyrics and lack of a catchy riff in the usual Beatles style, although he finds this last quality partly redeemed in the bass playing and guitar solo.\n\nSimon Leng cites the track's appearance as a B-side to the Lennon–McCartney composition as indicative of Harrison's predicament during the last year of the Beatles' career, since:\nIn any other band, this upbeat boogie that matched lyrical sophistication with another outstanding guitar break would have taken precedence over the rough, self-serving travelogue that was \"The Ballad of John and Yoko\". Harrison's song works on any level, in any context, while the Lennon piece could only have relevance within the Beatles' self-referential sphere ... This kind of glaring anomaly forced George Harrison out of the Beatles.\n\nWriting for Rough Guides, Chris Ingham recognises \"Old Brown Shoe\" as \"perhaps the densest, sharpest Harrison song to make it onto a Beatles record\". In his review of \"Anthology 3\" for \"Mojo\" in 1996, Ingham admired Harrison's \"focussed demo work\", adding: \"Fighting harder for album space consideration [than Lennon and McCartney], the spirit on his demos throughout this period is wonderful, the songs shining vividly through. The stripped-down, beautifully sung 'Old Brown Shoe', 'Something' and 'All Things Must Pass' ... nearly steal the show with their simplicity and confidence. The sound of a man quietly getting into his stride.\"\n\nJoe Bosso of \"MusicRadar\" includes \"Old Brown Shoe\" among Harrison's \"10 Greatest Beatles Songs\", describing it as \"An infectious, lively track that tumbles out of the gate (check out Ringo's raucous drumming) and gallops off.\" He also highlights Harrison's \"blazing guitar solo\" and says that, with his guitar, bass and organ contributions, the recording is \"practically all-George\". The editors of \"Guitar World\" rank \"Old Brown Shoe\" at number 28 in their list of \"The Beatles' 50 Greatest Guitar Moments\". They describe the solo as \"stinging\" in the style of Clapton and rate the track among Harrison's best songs yet, one that was \"dishonorably relegated\" to the B-side of \"The Ballad of John and Yoko\".\n\nHarrison performed \"Old Brown Shoe\" throughout his 1991 Japanese tour with Eric Clapton, Harrison's only tour as a solo artist other than his 1974 North American tour. Typically of his approach during the Japanese concerts, the song's arrangement was little changed from the Beatles' recording. A live version was included on Harrison's 1992 album \"Live in Japan\". He also played the song at his only full-length concert in the UK – a benefit for the Natural Law Party held at the Royal Albert Hall in London on 6 April 1992.\n\nGary Brooker performed \"Old Brown Shoe\" at the Concert for George, backed by a large band that included Clapton and Preston. The concert took place at the Royal Albert Hall in November 2002, a year after Harrison's death. Brooker, whose former band the Paramounts supported the Beatles on their December 1965 UK tour, recalled having difficulty mastering the vocal line. Despite being known as a powerful singer, Brooker said: \"It's a very difficult song to sing; it's totally George Harrison, and you have to become a different person to be able to sing it. It took me a long, long time to learn it and I still couldn't sing it like George.\"\n\nLeslie West contributed a recording to the 2003 album \"\". At the George Fest tribute concert in 2014, the song was performed by Conan O'Brien.\nAccording to Mark Lewisohn, Ian MacDonald and John Winn (except where noted):\n\n\nHowever, according to the book included in the \"Abbey Road\" 50th Anniversary Super Deluxe release, which includes take 2 of the song, Starr was away filming \"The Magic Christian\" when the song was recorded. The line-up given in the book for take 2 is as follows:<ref name=\"Howlett/AbbeyRoad50\"></ref>\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2254939", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2254939", "title": "I'll Get You", "text": "I'll Get You\n\n\"I'll Get You\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles, written by Lennon–McCartney, and released by the Beatles as the B-side of their 1963 single \"She Loves You\". The song was initially titled \"Get You in the End\".\n\nTypical of the Beatles' vocal style of that period, John Lennon and Paul McCartney sing in unison for the majority of the track, allowing the few occasions when they do harmonise to stand out. But unlike most Beatles songs of the time there is no lead guitar break; the lead guitar is virtually reduced to a second rhythm guitar. The most prominent instruments in the track are McCartney's \"plumply rounded bass\" and Lennon's harmonica, which was overdubbed in a rush as session time ran out.\n\nBeatles writer Bill Harry credits Lennon as the main composer, although McCartney claims it was a 50 / 50 collaboration. McCartney recalls using Lennon's Menlove Avenue home as the writing base for the song. This was rare as Lennon's Aunt Mimi, whom Lennon still lived with at the time, was disapproving of the Beatles.\n\nThe song's opening line \"Imagine I'm in love with you\" was innovative, drawing the listener immediately into the story. McCartney would cite this as an early example of Lewis Carroll's influence on Lennon's lyrics—a ploy explored again in later compositions such as \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\", \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" and Lennon's solo \"Imagine\". Reiterating its A-side's catchphrase (\"Yeah\"), and assuming the heavy scouse accents conspicuous on their early records, Lennon and McCartney \"drawl their way through a mock-naïve love lyric\". McCartney later singled out the chord change underneath \"It's not like me to \"pretend\"\" as unusual (moving from a D major to A minor), and crediting the Joan Baez rendition of the folk song \"All My Trials\" as inspiration. \"I [also] liked that slightly faggy way we sang: 'Oh yeah, oh yeah', which was very distinctive, very Beatley.\" Looking back in 1967, Lennon said: \"Ever heard anyone from Liverpool singing 'yes'? It’s \"yeah!\"\".\n\nThe song was a B-side on two separate occasions. It was initially released as the B-side of \"She Loves You\" (on 28 August 1963 in the United Kingdom and 16 September in the United States) and was also later released in the US only on 21 May 1964 as the B-side of \"Sie Liebt Dich\", a German language recording of the previous A-side. Both were released on the Swan Records label in the United States—the only Beatles releases on that label (the British release was on Parlophone).\n\nThe song was also released in the US on 10 April 1964 on the Capitol Records album \"The Beatles' Second Album\". It was not released on album in the UK until the \"Rarities\" release as part of the set \"The Beatles Collection\". A live version of the song, recorded at the London Palladium on 13 October 1963, is included on \"Anthology 1\". A version was also recorded at the BBC Paris studios in London on 16 July 1963 for airing on programme nine of the \"Pop Go The Beatles\" radio series, and has currently not been made officially available. Another BBC performance, recorded on 7 September 1963, was officially issued in 2013 on \"On Air – Live at the BBC Volume 2\".\n\nThe song is available on compact disc in the first volume of the two-disc \"Past Masters\" compilation.\n\nNo original master tapes of \"I'll Get You\" are known to exist. Standard procedure at Abbey Road Studios at the time was to erase the original two-track session tape for singles once they had been \"mixed down\" to the (usually monaural) master tape used to press records. This was the fate of two Beatles singles (four songs): \"Love Me Do\"/\"P.S. I Love You\" and \"She Loves You\"/\"I'll Get You\".\n\n\n"}
