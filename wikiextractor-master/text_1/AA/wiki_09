{"id": "1801159", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1801159", "title": "Bellefonte Nuclear Plant", "text": "Bellefonte Nuclear Plant\n\nThe Bellefonte Nuclear Generating Station (BLN) is an unfinished nuclear power plant in Hollywood, Alabama, United States.\n\nA total of four nuclear reactors (two originally; and two of new designs), have been proposed for the site over a 40-year period, with over $4 billion having been spent (constructing the preliminary plant infrastructure and ordering/delivering/installing major equipment items). But no nuclear reactor nor electric generating plant was ever completed; two cores of nuclear fuel were originally delivered however these were returned on plant deferral.\nMeaningful construction progress at the site was halted in 1988. Starting after its termination in 2005, Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) implemented an investment recovery effort to recoup some of the costs associated with Bellefonte. As part of the investment recovery effort, all or parts of some major plant components, including steam generators, feedwater heaters, large pumps and motors, demineralized water and condensate storage tanks, main condenser tubes, and some piping and valves were removed and sold. Additionally, some usable components were transferred from Bellefonte to other TVA facilities as spares.\n\nThe Bellefonte Nuclear Generating Station site is owned by the Tennessee Valley Authority and is located in Hollywood, Alabama. The two partially built 1,256 megawatt (MWe) pressurized water reactors on the site were made by Babcock & Wilcox; they are called a 205 design due to the number of fuel assemblies in the core. These units are of the same design as WNP-1, which is also unfinished, and as the Mülheim-Kärlich A reactor in Germany, which operated for three years and proved the design.\n\nReactor Unit 1 construction was estimated at 88%  complete (mechanical - nuclear island) and Unit 2 construction was estimated 58% complete (mechanical - nuclear island) when TVA's Board suspended the project and the plants' construction in 1988, after a combined $6 billion investment. Subsequent asset recovery activities (i.e., the removal (without ordering or planning for replacement), of usable equipment and systems to other TVA power plant sites), along with more recent (2000s) inspections of the operable state of remaining equipment, resulted in BLN 1&2 now being considered approximately 55 percent and 35 percent complete (mechanical - nuclear island only) respectively.\n\nAlthough the construction permits were terminated on September 15, 2006, TVA investigated the completion of these first two units with operation projected to start Unit 1 in 2017 and Unit 2 in 2021. In August 2008 TVA asked the NRC to reinstate the construction permits as part of the restart evaluation. This request was granted by the NRC on February 9, 2009, albeit as a terminated application, which required significant inspection of all systems to bring the license to the deferred stage. The status was upgraded January 14, 2010 to \"deferred\".\n\nOn September 22, 2005 it was announced that Bellefonte was also selected as the site for one or two AP1000 pressurized water reactors to be called Units 3 and 4. TVA filed the necessary applications in November 2007 to begin the design and construction process. For details, see Nuclear Power 2010 Program.\n\nIn August 2009, the Tennessee Valley Authority, faced with \"falling electric sales and rising costs from cleaning up a massive coal ash spill in Tennessee\", trimmed plans for the potential four-unit Bellefonte nuclear plant to one reactor.\n\nOn August 20, 2010 the TVA Board of Directors authorized $248 million to continue development of the Bellefonte Unit 1. On August 18, 2011, the TVA board of directors voted to proceed with the construction of the unit one reactor at Bellefonte. In 2011, TVA approved a plan to restart construction of the Bellefonte Unit 1 reactor, dependent on work at another reactor TVA completing - Watts Bar 2 in Tennessee. In December 2012, TVA said the Watts Bar 2 project was on schedule to finish in December 2015. TVA again announced staffing cuts at the plant in June 2013, reducing staffing at the plant from 540 to approximately 140. During this time new Steam Generators were purchased and fabricated. Those generators are now stored onsite pending any new construction.\n\nIn October 2013, it was announced that former TVA Chairman Dennis Bottorff and financier Franklin L. Haney had drafted a proposal to finish the Bellefonte Nuclear Plant using private funds and federal tax credits\n\nIn 2015 TVA determined that it would be unlikely to need a large plant such as Bellefonte for the next 20 years, and in May 2016 elected to declare the plant surplus, and sell the 1,600-acre site at auction for a minimum price of $36.4 million.\n\nOn October 14, 2016, TVA directors declared the unfinished nuclear plant to be surplus property and set a November 14, 2016 auction date to sell the unfinished plant and property. Nuclear Development LLC, led by Chattanooga-based developer Franklin L. Haney, won the auction to purchase the Bellefonte Nuclear Plant with a bid of $111 million, three times the minimum bid of $36.4 million. Nuclear Development intended to complete the two units at a projected additional investment of over $13 billion. Haney's bid beat the only other bidder, Jackson Holdings of Alabama LLC, which was hoping to use components from the unfinished plant for a reactor under construction in India. Another prospective bidder, Phoenix Energy of Nevada, was unable to complete financing arrangements in time to place a bid.\n\nAs of November 2017, construction at the facility was expected to start by the end of 2018 and take approximately five years to complete. Nuclear Development LLC made agreements to partner with SNC-Lavalin and Enercon Services, Inc. in the completion of the project.\n\nIn August 2018, it was reported that Haney agreed to pay Michael Cohen (associate of President Donald Trump) $10 million in exchange for help obtaining federal funding for the project. Haney says he hired Cohen to pursue investment from a Qatari sovereign fund and that neither he nor Cohen sought to lobby Trump about DOE loan guarantees.\n\nIn December 2018, TVA pulled out of the sale agreement, citing failure by Haney to obtain regulatory approval for the transfer of the site. A federal judge ruled in May 2019 that the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) must continue to honor an agreement to sell the unfinished Bellefonte Nuclear Power Plant to a real estate developer who has said he would complete construction of the long-idled project. U.S. District Court Judge Liles C. Burke, in a 17-page opinion issued after a hearing in Huntsville, Alabama, declined to dismiss a lawsuit brought by developer Franklin Haney, who sued TVA in November 2018 for breach of contract after TVA said it could not complete the sale of the Bellefonte site and its assets to Haney’s Nuclear Development LLC\n\nThe Bellefonte Generating Station consisted of four cancelled reactors.\n"}

In aqueous solution it acts as a base, forming isocyanic acid, HNCO. The cyanate ion is an ambidentate ligand, forming complexes with a metal ion in which either the nitrogen or oxygen atom may be the electron-pair donor. It can also act as a bridging ligand. Organic cyanates are called isocyanates when there is a C−NCO bond and cyanates when there is a C−OCN bond.\n\nThe three atoms in a cyanate ion lie on a straight line, giving the ion a linear structure. The electronic structure is described most simply as\nwith a single C−O bond and a triple C≡N bond. The infrared spectrum of a cyanate salt has a band at ca. 2096 cm; such a high frequency is characteristic of a triple bond. The cyanate ion is a Lewis base. Both the oxygen and nitrogen atoms carry a lone pair of electrons and either one or the other, or both can be donated to Lewis acid acceptors. It can be described as an ambidentate ligand.\n\nIsocyanic acid, HNCO, is produced when a cyanate salt is acidified. Although the electronic structure according to valence bond theory can be written as HN=C=O, as illustrated, the vibrational spectrum has a band at 2268.8 cm in the gas phase, which clearly requires the C≡N bond to be a triple bond. In valence bond theory the canonical form H≡C−O is the major contributor to the resonance hybrid.\nThe pure compound has a melting point of −86.8 °C and a boiling point of 23.5 °C, so it is volatile at ambient temperatures. In aqueous solution it is a weak acid.\nOn heating isocyanic acid is converted to the trimer cyanuric acid, which itself decomposes on further heating back to isocyanic acid. In the reverse of the famous synthesis of urea by Friedrich Wöhler,\nisocyanic acid is produced and rapidly trimerizes to cyanuric acid.\n\nThe tautomer, known as cyanic acid, HOCN, in which the oxygen atom is protonated, is unstable to decomposition, but in solution it is present in equilibrium with isocyanic acid to the extent of about 3%. The vibrational spectrum is indicative of the presence of a triple bond between the nitrogen and carbon atoms.\n\nSodium cyanate is isostructural with sodium fulminate, confirming the linear structure of the cyanate ion. It is made industrially by heating a mixture of sodium carbonate and urea.\nA similar reaction is used to make potassium cyanate. Cyanates are produced when cyanides are oxidized. Use of this fact is made in cyanide decontamination processes where oxidants such as permanganate and hydrogen peroxide are used to convert toxic cyanide to safer cyanate.\n\nCyanate is an ambidentate ligand which can donate the pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom or the oxygen atom, or both. Structurally the isomers can be distinguished by the geometry of the complex. In \"N\"-bonded cyanate complexes the M−NCO unit has a Guzman structure, but with \"O\"-bonded cyanate the M−O−C unit is bent. Thus, the silver cyanato complex, [Ag(NCO)], has a linear structure, so is \"N\"-bonded.\n\nInfrared spectroscopy has been used extensively to distinguish between isomers. Many complexes of divalent metals are \"N\"-bonded. \"O\"-bonding has been suggested for complexes of the type [M(OCN)], M = Mo(III), Re(IV) and Re(V). The yellow complex Rh(PPh)(NCO) and orange complex Rh(PPh)(OCN) are linkage isomers and show differences in their infrared spectra which can be used for diagnosis (PPh stands for triphenylphosphine).\n\nThe cyanate ion can bridge between two metal atoms by using both its donor atoms. For example, this structure is found in the compound [Ni(NCO)(en)]<nowiki>[</nowiki>BPh<nowiki>]</nowiki>. In this compound both the Ni−N−C unit and Ni−O−C unit are bent, even though in the first case donation is through the nitrogen atom.\n\nOrganic compounds that contain the functional group −N=C=O are known as isocyanates. It is conventional in organic chemistry to write isocyanates with two double bonds, which accords with a simplistic valence bond theory of the bonding. In nucleophilic substitution reactions cyanate usually forms an isocyanate. Isocyanates are widely used in the manufacture of polyurethane products and pesticides; Methyl isocyanate, used to make pesticides, was a major factor in the Bhopal disaster.\n\nCompounds that contain the group −O−C≡N, are known as a cyanates, or cyanate esters. Aryl cyanates such are phenyl cyanate, CHOCN, can be formed by a reaction of phenol with cyanogen chloride, ClCN, in the presence of a base.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1801187", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1801187", "title": "Lithic stage", "text": "Lithic stage\n\nIn the sequence of cultural stages first proposed for the archaeology of the Americas by Gordon Willey and Philip Phillips in 1958, the Lithic stage was the earliest period of human occupation in the Americas, as post-glacial hunters and collectors spread through the Americas. \nThe stage derived its name from the first appearance of Lithic flaked stone tools. The term Paleo-Indian is an alternative, generally indicating much the same period.\n\nThis stage was conceived of as embracing two major categories of stone technology: (1) unspecialized and largely unformulated core and flake industries, with percussion the dominant and perhaps only technique employed, and (2) industries exhibiting more advanced \"blade\" techniques of stoneworking, with specialized fluted or unfluted lanceolate points the most characteristic artifact types. Throughout South America, there are stone tool traditions of the lithic stage, such as the \"fluted fishtail\" that reflect localized adaptations to the diverse habitats of the continent. \n\nThe indications and timing of the end of the Lithic stage vary between regions. The use of textiles, fired pottery and start of the gradual replacement of hunter gatherer lifestyles with the use of agriculture and domesticated animals would all be factors. End dates vary, but are around 5,000 to 3,000 BC in many areas. The Archaic stage is the most widely used term for the succeeding stage, but in the periodization of pre-Columbian Peru the Cotton Pre-Ceramic may be used, as in the Norte Chico civilization cultivated cotton seems to have been very important in economic and power relations, from around 3,200 BC. \n\nOne of the leading figures is Alex Krieger who has documented hundreds of sites that have yielded crude, percussion-flaked tools. The most convincing evidence for a lithic stage is based upon data recovered from sites in South America where such crude tools have been found and dated to more than 20,000 years ago.\n\nIn North America, the time encompasses the Paleo-Indian period that subsequently is divided into more specific time terms such as \"Early Lithic stage\" or \"Early Paleo-Indians\" and \"Middle Paleo-Indians\" or \"Middle Lithic stage\". Examples include the Clovis culture and Folsom tradition groups.\n\nThe Lithic stage was followed by the Archaic stage.\nTimes from the 8000 BCE to about 3000 BCE may be classified as part of the lithic stage or of an archaic stage, depending on authority and on region.\n\n"}
{"id": "1801190", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1801190", "title": "Mayor of San Diego", "text": "Mayor of San Diego\n\nThe mayor of the City of San Diego is the official head and chief executive officer of the U.S. city of San Diego, California. The mayor has the duty to enforce and execute the laws enacted by the San Diego City Council, the legislative branch. The mayor serves a four-year term and is limited to two successive terms.\n\nThere have been 35 individuals who have served as mayor. Joshua Bean, elected in 1850, was the first mayor of the city. Edwin M. Capps, who served as mayor in the late 1800s and early 1900s, is the only person who served two non-consecutive terms. From 1852 to 1888, the city was run by a Board of Trustees and there was no elected mayor. However, the president of the board was called \"mayor\" as a courtesy.\n\nIn 2013, mayor Bob Filner resigned under pressure amid multiple allegations of sexual harassment. In so doing, Filner joined several other recent San Diego mayors who resigned due to scandal, including Roger Hedgecock, Dick Murphy and acting mayor Michael Zucchet. City council president Todd Gloria served as interim mayor until a special election could be held. Kevin Faulconer was elected to serve the remainder of Filner's term and assumed the office on March 3, 2014. Faulconer was re-elected for a second term on June 7, 2016.\n\nThe position of mayor was created when San Diego was first incorporated on March 27, 1850. However, the city went bankrupt in 1852, only two years after incorporation. As a result of the bankruptcy, the State of California dissolved the government and replaced the mayor and city council with a board of trustees. The mayoral position was later re-established with a new charter in 1887. This charter was replaced with a permanent City Charter on May 6, 1889, using the strong mayor form of government.\n\nIn 1931, a new charter was adopted using a council–manager government with a citywide mayor as leader of the city council. In November 2004, voters approved Proposition F, returning San Diego to the strong mayor form of government on a five-year trial basis. This was made permanent in June 2010 with the passage of Proposition D.\n\nThe mayor serves as the official head of the City of San Diego for all ceremonial and civil purposes. The mayor has the authority to approve or veto council actions, subject to a two-thirds vote veto overrule. Under the strong mayor system, the mayor has sole authority to appoint and dismiss the city manager and to direct and control the city manager as permitted by the city charter. The mayor also has the authority to dismiss the chief of police or the chief of the fire department subject to a council overrule. The mayor may recommend measures and ordinance to the city council, but may not vote on these items.\n\nOn or before January 15, the mayor is obligated to communicate a State of the City address to the city council. The mayor must also propose a budget to the city council and for public review no later than April 15.\n\nThe salary of the mayor was set at $100,464 in 2003. In March 2012, the city's Salary Setting Commission proposed that the mayor be paid $235,000, but the city council unanimously rejected the recommendation, instead keeping the salary at the 2003 level. In March 2014, the Salary Setting Commission recommended no pay increase for the mayor or city council. Instead, they recommended exploring future pay increases with additional condition that council members voting for pay increases not be allowed to benefit from the increase. This recommendation was approved by the city council in a 5–3 vote in favor of the changes. In November 2018, voters passed Measure L which ties future mayoral salaries to those of Superior Court judges. In 2020, pay will increase to about $200,000 per year at current rates.\n\nThe mayor is elected in citywide election. Elections follow a two-round system. The first round of the election is called the primary election. The top-two candidates from the primary election advance to a runoff election, called the general election. Write-in candidates are only allowed to contest the primary election and are not allowed in the general election. The mayor is elected to a four-year term, with a limit of two consecutive terms. The mayor is officially non-partisan by state law, although most mayoral candidates identify a party preference.\n\nIf the office of the mayor becomes vacant with one year or less remaining in the term, the city council appoints a person to fill the vacancy. If the vacancy occurs with more than one year remaining, the city council is obligated to call a special election. The candidate with the majority of the votes in the special election is declared mayor. If no candidate receives a majority, a special run-off must be held between the two candidates with the highest number of votes. While the mayor's office is vacant pending a special election, the president of the city council serves as the interim mayor, with limited powers, until a new mayor is elected. If for any reason a Mayor serves a partial term of two years or more, it will count as one full term.\n\nThe most recent general election was held in June 2016, and incumbent Mayor Kevin Faulconer was re-elected for a second term. Faulconer was originally elected in a 2014 special election to fill the vacancy left as a result of the resignation of Mayor Bob Filner.\n\nAs of , 35 individuals have served as mayor. There have been 36 mayoralties because Edwin M. Capps served two non-consecutive terms; he is counted chronologically as both the ninth and sixteenth mayor. The longest term was that of Pete Wilson, who served for eleven years over three terms prior to the establishment of successive term limits. The shortest term, not counting interim or acting mayors, was that of George P. Tebbetts, who served for less than two months before the position of mayor was abolished due to the bankruptcy of the city. Percy J. Benbough is the only mayor to have died in office. Two women have been elected mayor: Maureen O'Connor and Susan Golding consecutively. John F. Forward Sr. and John F. Forward Jr. are the only father and son to have both served as mayor.\n\nThis list includes people who served as acting mayor or interim mayor due to a vacancy in the office of the mayor, but who were not officially elected or appointed as mayor. The acting and interim mayors are not included in the count of mayors.\n\nAfter San Diego's bankruptcy in 1852, the State of California took over city government and ran the city with an appointed Board of Trustees during 1852–1888. The President of the Board was called \"mayor\" by courtesy, although there was no official office of mayor. When the office of president was vacated due to death or resignation, the board of trustees would choose a president pro tempore to preside over meetings until a permanent president could be elected by the board.\n\nThe following is a list of congressional, gubernatorial and other offices held by mayors, before or after their term(s).\n\nAs of August 2013, seven former mayors are alive, the oldest being Pete Wilson (1971–1983; born 1933). The most recent mayor to die is John D. Butler (1951–1955; born 1915), on February 9, 2010.\n\n"}

It was written by Davis and Pete Warner and reached number 24 on the \"Billboard\" Hot R&B chart in 1986. It was later re-recorded in 1998 by Jermaine Dupri and Mariah Carey, from Dupri's debut album \"Life in 1472\" (1998), and from Carey's first compilation album \"#1's\" (1998).\n\nJermaine Dupri and Mariah Carey co-produced their cover of the song for Dupri's debut album \"Life in 1472\", and Carey's compilation album \"#1's\", later appearing on her 2001 greatest hits collection and 2003 remix compilation \"The Remixes\". It was scheduled for release as the second single from \"Life in 1472\" in 1998 and was meant to be given full single treatment, with the manufacturing of commercial CD singles and CD maxi-singles (among other single formats). Sony Music Entertainment retracted the commercial single at the last minute, and it was never commercially released in the United States. Some retail outlets received the commercial singles, and many of them were sold. Most stores gave them away free, or as free extras with the \"Life in 1472\" or \"#1's\" albums. Many were still left, and Amazon controversially sold them for a while from January 2000.\n\n\"Sweetheart\" was only given a commercial release in parts of Europe and Asia, where it garnered minor success and reached the top 40 in most markets. The commercial single was originally scheduled for release in the U.S. before the eligibility rules for the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart were changed to allow album cuts to chart. Following the change of rules for the Hot 100, the rules for the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart were changed as well, to allow airplay-only songs that were bubbling under, or had not yet entered the Hot 100, to chart there. \"Sweetheart\" began to receive radio and music video airplay in early September 1998, and in the first week of the rule change, when the song's run as a promotional single was ending, it entered the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart at 25 and remained on the chart for one week.\n\nThe single's video, directed by Hype Williams, shows Dupri and Carey in various locations ranging from the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain to a secluded beach nearby in Sopelana and an exclusive nightclub. The song's theme of having a \"sweetheart\" runs throughout the video. Carey and Dupri re-recorded their vocals for a remix of the song, known as \"Sweetheart\" (The Story), which features more raps by Dupri and fewer vocals by Carey. Lil Jon, Mark Picchiotti, and Eddie Arroyo also created remixes of the song.\n\nAllmusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine highlighted this track. When the same critic reviewed the same song in Mariah's Number 1's he called it fine but not particularly memorable. Jon Dolan of Citypage music wrote that Dupri is romancing pop queen Mariah Carey in the squeaky clean, radio-gimme \"Sweetheart.\" Entertainment Weekly's David Browne wrote: \"Even Carey contributes, perhaps unwittingly (...) On the mild electro-funk of \"Sweetheart,\" she turns herself into a subservient Barbie, cooing about her need for a \"storybook romance.\" Kris Ex of Vibe wrote that Mariah Carey-belted \"Sweetheart\" updates Rainy Davis's '86 hit of the same name but its \"jams are swollen with riveting bass runs.\"\n\n\n"}

Mary Dann died in 2005. They challenged the federal government over uses of their tribe's traditional land, in a case that reached the United States Supreme Court as \"US v. Dann.\"\n\nIn 1993 the Dann sisters received the Right Livelihood Award for \"exemplary courage and perseverance in asserting the rights of indigenous people to their land.\" \"American Outrage\" (2008) was a documentary film that explored their leadership in the disputes with the federal government over use of the Western Shoshone territory.\n\nIn 1863, two years into the American Civil War, the US made the peace Treaty of Ruby Valley with the Western Shoshone, which was to allow US citizens safe passage through their territory, protect Pony Express and other access, and permit mining for gold on their land and future construction of railroads. The US needed the gold to conduct the war against the Confederacy. It defined the Western Shoshone territory as what is now a large portion of Nevada and four other states, as well as the underlying mineral rights, and said the Shoshone would never have to cede their land. It promised payment of annuities in cash or goods equaling $5000 annually for 20 years, but paid only the first year.\n\nOver the ensuing decades, the US acquired much of the Western Shoshone land, largely by Congressional legislation. Most of the land is now held for resource management by federal agencies such as the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in the Department of Interior and the Department of Energy (DOE). The latter has used some of the land for nuclear testing, and has conducted more than 100 atmospheric tests, \"more than anywhere else in the world.\" DOE has detonated nearly 1000 bombs on this territory.\n\nThe Western Shoshone filed suit decades ago to try to reclaim their land. In 1962 the now defunct Indian Claims Court (which expired in 1978) ruled the Shoshone had lost control of their land due to settler encroachment, and they were not entitled to any claim from the US government. As the case proceeded, in 1979 the Indian Claims Commission awarded a $26 million land claim settlement to the Western Shoshone. Part of the case went to federal courts for litigation. The US Supreme Court ruled in 1985 that the Shoshone land claims were extinguished by this financial settlement. The Shoshone refused to take the money, which is earning interest. Eighty percent of the Shoshone who voted on the issue were against accepting the financial settlement; instead, they asked the US to respect the terms of the 1863 treaty. Some Shoshone have wanted the tribe to take the money, and to distribute and invest it for the welfare of the tribe.\n\nSince 1973, the Dann sisters conducted civil protest by ranching and refusing to pay grazing fees to BLM to run their cattle outside their ranch on what they consider Shoshone land. They contended the US had taken the land illegally and not abided by the terms of its treaty.\n\nIn 1982 some tribal members organized the Western Shoshone National Council as a governmental group; they elected Raymond Yowell as chief. It is an alternative to what they call the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA) governments of the Duckwater Indian Reservation and Yomba Indian Reservations, which are federally recognized tribes with elected governments. Yowell has worked to ensure the tribes do not accept the settlement money (which was valued at up to $100 million in 1998) because that would extinguish their claims to their former territory.\n\nIn 1998 BLM issued trespass notices to the Danns and Raymond Yowell, chief of the Western Shoshone Nation, ordering their removal of hundreds of cows and horses from public lands in Eureka County, Nevada. Carrie and Mary Dann filed a request for urgent action with the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. They had been active in the movement to recover millions of acres of land in Nevada and bordering states that originally belonged to the Western Shoshone tribe.\n\nThe Dann sisters persuaded the UN of their case. It ordered the US government to halt all actions against the Western Shoshone people, a mandate which was mostly ignored.\n\nMary Dann (January 2, 1923 – April 22, 2005) (Western Shoshone) was a Native American activist. She died from an accident on her ranch in Crescent Valley, central Nevada, on April 22, 2005.\n\nCarrie Dann (c. 1932- ) is a Western Shoshone spiritual elder and activist for land and tribal rights.\n\nOn April 1, 2007, Carrie Dann was arrested with 38 other activists for trespassing at the Nevada Test Site at a Nevada Desert Experience event protesting governmental programs at the site. She has continued with activities to try to end nuclear testing and programs at the site.\n\nIn November 2008 Dann, with members of the Western Shoshone Defense Project and four other tribal and public interest groups, sued in federal court against the US and Canadian Barrick Gold, seeking an injunction to stop the \"largest open pit cyanide heap leach gold mines in the United States - the Cortez Hills Expansion Project on Mt. Tenabo,\" Nevada. The Western Shoshone consider this to be sacred land. In addition to spiritual concerns, tribal and other groups are concerned about the proposed project's environmental impact on water, air and ground quality.\n\n\n"}

It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) at least once every five years using the first-past-the-post voting system of voting.\n\nOnce a longtime Conservative seat, the area had been represented by Labour MPs from 1987 until 2015. Patricia Gibson, has held the seat as a SNP member since 2015.\n\nA diverse seat, it contains the affluent towns of Largs, Fairlie and West Kilbride to the north, as well as the more working class towns of Ardrossan, Kilbirnie, the Garnock Valley, Kilwinning, Saltcoats and Stevenston to the south. The Isle of Arran and Great Cumbrae are also within the constituency.\n\nThe constituency is entirely within the North Ayrshire council area. Part of the same council area is covered by the Central Ayrshire constituency.\n\nThe boundaries of North Ayrshire and Arran extend to, and include, Skelmorlie in the north of the council area, Irvine in the south, Beith in the east, and the islands of Arran and Cumbrae in the west.\n\nThe towns of Skelmorlie, Largs, Fairlie and West Kilbride in the north are affluent commuter towns, while Ardrossan, Saltcoats, Irvine, and Stevenston in the south are rather more industrial, However, regeneration is taking place at Ardrossan Harbour and there has been a rapid increase in new build housing in recent years. Inland, the seat takes in the Garnock valley towns of Dalry, Beith and Kilbirnie, once a centre of steel and textile production long since gone. Tourism is the main industry on Arran and Cumbrae, however the number of holiday homes on the latter has begun to squeeze locals out of the housing market. The seat has two nuclear power stations, Hunterston A nuclear power station (currently being decommissioned) and Hunterston B nuclear power station, as well as a windfarm at Ardrossan.\n\nThe constituency of North Ayrshire was created in 1868 and was much larger than the present constituency, as it also included the towns of Irvine and Kilmarnock. It returned various Liberal, Liberal Unionist and Conservative MP's, the most well known of whom being Sir Aylmer Hunter-Weston, a general in the First World War who served as MP from 1916-1935 first for North Ayrshire and then for Bute and Northern Ayrshire which was created in 1918. Another well-known MP was Sir Fitzroy Maclean, a major-general in the Second World War who was rumoured to be one of Ian Fleming's inspirations for James Bond.\n\nIn 1983, the Cunninghame North constituency was created. From 1911 to 1987, the constituencies containing North Ayrshire returned either Conservative Party or Unionist Party MP's until the 1987 general election when the constituency was lost to the Labour Party. In 2015, the seat was won by the SNP. In the 2017 general election the SNP held the seat with a much reduced majority, with the Conservatives more than doubling their vote share.\n\n \n\nThe Conservative Party candidate Philip Lardner was dropped as their official candidate and suspended from his job (but later reinstated) as a Primary School teacher following comments he had made, in which (as a Christian) he described homosexuality as \"not normal behaviour\". As nominations for candidates had closed, however, the Conservatives were unable to replace him. In 2008 he had previously been suspended as a candidate for the same seat by the Conservatives over claims he made racist remarks, but was later reinstated as the candidate for this seat and exonerated by the Party. Lardner is recorded by the BBC as an \"Independent\", due to him being \"disowned\" by the Conservative Party prior to polling day, however, on the actual ballot paper he was still described as a \"Scottish Conservatives & Unionist\".\n\nThe Labour Party chose Katy Clark, the incumbent MP and former trade union official to re-contest the seat. Clark is considered to be quite a left-wing Labour MP as she voted against replacing Trident and is a member of the Scottish Campaign for Socialism.\n\nThe Scottish National Party narrowly won the seat of Cunninghame North during the 2007 Scottish parliamentary election and wished to capitalise on this success during the general election. They chose 41-year-old retired English teacher Cllr Patricia Gibson to contest the seat.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats chose primary teacher Gillian Cole-Hamilton and Louise McDaid of the Socialist Labour Party also contested the seat as she has done for several elections.\n\nPercentage vote change and percentage swing for the 2005 results are based on notional results on how this constituency would have performed in the 2001 UK General Election.\n"}

It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) at least once every five years using the first-past-the-post system of voting.\n\nAs created in 1950, the constituency merged parts of the Bute and Northern Ayrshire and Kilmarnock constituencies. Following the Representation of the People Act 1948, the Central Ayrshire constituency between 1950-55 consisted of Irvine, Kilwinning, Stewarton, Troon, Kilbirnie and part of the district of Kilmarnock. When abolished in 1983, the constituency was largely replaced by Cunninghame South, with Troon and its surrounding areas forming part of the Ayr constituency.\n\nThe constituency was re-established in 2005, centred around the historic burgh of Irvine and stretching north to cover part of Kilwinning and south to cover the coastal resort towns of Prestwick, Troon and their adjacent hinterlands alongside part of Ayr. The constituency covers the 2017 electoral wards of Irvine East, Irvine South, Irvine West and a small section of Kilwinning (between the River Garnock and the B778) from the North Ayrshire Council area and Prestwick, Troon, Kyle and a small section of Ayr North (between Seaforth Road and Lochside Road in Heathfield) from the South Ayrshire Council area. The remainder of the North Ayrshire Council area is represented as part of the North Ayrshire and Arran Parliamentary constituency, with the remainder of South Ayrshire being covered by the Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock Parliamentary constituency alongside parts of East Ayrshire.\n\nA diverse seat, the constituency covers towns such as Irvine and parts of Kilwinning to the north, as well as the more affluent coastal resorts of Troon and Prestwick to the south. The seat also takes in a set of villages in rural South Ayrshire including the former mining communities of Annbank, Mossblown and Tarbolton alongside the villages of Loans, Dundonald and Symington.\n\nIrvine was designated in the 1970s as a Glasgow overspill new town. In recent local council elections, the SNP have performed strongly in the town of Irvine. The coastal towns of Prestwick and Troon join the town as part of the constituency as well as outlying rural areas located south and east of Troon and Prestwick: Prestwick, Troon and their hinterlands have sustained a considerable level of support for Conservative candidates locally and as part of the Ayr constituency in the Scottish Parliament. Heathfield in Ayr North also forms part of the constituency: this area is relatively small and has elected Labour councillors locally.\n\nThe seat has mostly elected Labour Party MPs since the 1950s, with the former MP Brian Donohoe having represented the seat since its creation in 2005, and was MP for the predecessor seat of Cunninghame South since the 1992 general election. He lost his seat at the 2015 general election during an SNP landslide in Scotland, in which the SNP's Philippa Whitford was elected with a majority of 13,589 votes. At the 2017 UK general election the Conservatives were well ahead in Prestwick and Troon in South Ayrshire, with the SNP finishing first in Irvine in North Ayrshire, allowing for Philippa Whitford to return as the Member of Parliament for the Central Ayrshire constituency with a significantly reduced majority of 1,267 votes (2.8%) ahead of Conservative challenger Caroline Hollins-Martin.\n\nThe constituency overlaps the Scottish Parliamentary constituencies of Ayr, Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley and Cunninghame South. The Ayr constituency has been represented by Conservative MSP John Scott since a by-election in 2000, marginally ahead of the SNP in second place. Cunninghame South is currently represented by SNP MSP Ruth Maguire, who sustained a significant majority of 22.1% of the vote at the 2016 Scottish Parliament election ahead of Labour's Joe Cullinane in second place.\n\nAt the most recent local council election in 2017 the composition of Councillors elected in the equivalent area of the Central Ayrshire constituency was as follows:\nThe total number of votes cast by political party in the equivalent area of Central Ayrshire at the local election was as follows: \n"}

It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election and covers the same area as the county of West Dunbartonshire.\n\nThe current constituency was first used in the 2005 general election. There was also an earlier West Dunbartonshire constituency, from 1950 to 1983.\n\nThe current MP is Martin Docherty-Hughes of the Scottish National Party, who was elected at the 2015 general election and was re-elected at the 2017 general election and 2019 general election.\n\nThe historic constituency was created under the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1949 and first used in the 1950 general election.\n\nAs created in 1950, the constituency was one of two covering the county of Dunbarton. The other was East Dunbartonshire. The two new constituencies replaced the earlier constituencies of Dunbartonshire and Dumbarton Burghs.\n\nWest Dunbartonshire covered the Helensburgh, Old Kilpatrick, and Vale of Leven districts of the county and the burghs of Cove and Kilcreggan, Dumbarton and Helensburgh.\n\nFor the 1951 general election the constituency boundaries were adjusted to take account of a change to the boundaries of the Old Kilpatrick district.\n\nThe results of the First Periodical Review of the Boundary Commission were implemented for the 1955 general election, but there was no change to the boundaries of West Dunbartonshire, and the boundaries of 1951 and 1955 were used also in the general elections of 1959, 1964, 1966 and 1970.\n\nThe results of the Second Periodical Review were implemented for the February 1974 general election. The review took account of population growth in the county of Dunbarton, caused by overspill from the city of Glasgow into the new town of Cumbernauld and elsewhere, and West Dunbartonshire became one of three constituencies covering the county. The other two were East Dunbartonshire and Central Dunbartonshire. West Dunbartonshire now covered the Helensburgh and Vale of Leven districts and the burghs of Cove and Kilcreggan, Dumbarton and Helensburgh.\n\nFebruary 1974 boundaries were used also for the general elections of October 1974 and 1979.\n\nIn 1975, under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, Scottish counties were abolished in favour of regions and districts and islands council areas, and the county of Dunbarton was divided between several districts of the new region of Strathclyde. The Third Periodical Review took account of new local government boundaries and the results were implemented for the 1983 general election.\n\nThe existing constituency was created as a result of the Fifth Periodical Review of the Boundary Commission for Scotland, It covers and is entirely within the West Dunbartonshire council area.\n\nThe area of the constituency was previously divided between the Dumbarton and Clydebank and Milngavie constituencies. It includes the population centres of Clydebank, Dumbarton and Alexandria.\n\nThe Fifth Periodical Review did not affect the boundaries of Scottish Parliament constituencies, which retain the boundaries of Westminster constituencies prior to implementation of the results of the review.\n\n Change to majority not meaningful as seat changed hands.\n"}

It is currently represented by David Linden of the Scottish National Party who has been the MP since 2017.\n\nIt was once one of the safest seats for the Labour Party, the areas included in the constituency having returned solely Labour MPs since the 1930s. However, it achieved national prominence when a by-election in 2008 saw the Scottish National Party overturn a majority of over 13,000 votes to gain the seat. Since then, it has been tightly fought by Labour and the SNP. The 2017 general election result in the constituency was that election's tenth-closest result, a winning margin of 75 votes.\n\nIn 2019, Linden was re-elected with an increased majority of 5,566 votes, making the seat a comfortable SNP majority. \nThe seat is entirely within the Glasgow City Council area, taking in the areas of: Baillieston, Carmyle, Easterhouse, Parkhead, Shettleston and Tollcross.\n\nGlasgow East is one of seven constituencies covering the Glasgow City council area. All are entirely within the council area. Glasgow East comprises the pre-2007 Glasgow City wards of Baillieston, Barlanark, Braidfauld, Easterhouse, Garrowhill, Garthamlock, Greenfield, Mount Vernon, Parkhead, Queenslie, Shettleston, and Tollcross Park.\n\nPrior to the 2005 general election, the city area was covered by ten constituencies, of which two straddled boundaries with other council areas. The Glasgow East constituency includes the area of the former Glasgow Baillieston constituency and parts of the former Glasgow Shettleston constituency. Scottish Parliament constituencies retain the names and boundaries of the older Westminster constituencies.\n\nGlasgow Baillieston had always been represented by MPs from the Labour Party until 2008, as was the predecessor Glasgow Provan constituency from its creation in 1955. Glasgow Shettleston was won by the Labour Party at every general election from 1950 onwards (in 1945 it was won by the Independent Labour Party). In 2008, the SNP succeeded in winning the seat from Labour in a by-election on a very large swing. Prior to the by-election, it had been one of the safest Labour seats in the UK. At the 2010 general election, the seat was regained for Labour by Margaret Curran from John Mason of the SNP; with a large majority of more than 11,000 votes.\n\nThe Glasgow East constituency contains part of the M8 motorway and main railway lines into the city centre; Celtic Park, the home ground of Celtic F.C. is located within the constituency.\n\nIt is one of the most deprived constituencies in the UK. Nearly 40% of adults smoke (UK average is 19.2%), and on average there are twenty-five drug-related deaths a year. Average male life expectancy is 68, five years less than the Scottish average, while in the Shettleston area it is 63. A 2008 World Health Organization report gave the average male life expectancy in Calton as 54, which is lower than it was before the Second World War.\n\nOn 28 June 2008, the sitting MP David Marshall announced he would step down because of a stress-related illness; he was appointed Steward of the Manor of Northstead on 30 June 2008, thus effectively resigning from the House of Commons. Although the seat represented Labour's third-largest majority in Scotland, it faced a strong challenge from the Scottish National Party, hot on the heels of Labour's disastrous performance at the 2008 Henley by-election. Nominations for candidates closed at 4pm on 9 July, and the election took place on 24 July.\n\nOn 25 July 2008, and after a recount, the SNP candidate John Mason won the seat with a narrow majority of 365 votes over the Labour Party candidate, Margaret Curran.\n\n\n This reference gives all recent Glasgow City Westminster election results.

The current Member of Parliament (MP) is Anne McLaughlin of the SNP who won the seat back from Labour's Paul Sweeney at the 2019 snap general election, overturning a majority of 242.\n\nFrom the seat's creation until 2009, the constituency was represented by Michael Martin, previously MP for Glasgow Springburn from 1979. Martin was elected Speaker of the House of Commons in October 2000, but in May 2009 he announced that he would be resigning as Speaker on 21 June 2009 because of his perceived role in the MPs' expenses controversy. He was the first Speaker in 300 years to be forced out of office by a motion of no confidence. He also resigned as an MP the following day, resulting in a by-election on 12 November 2009, which was won by Willie Bain of the Labour Party with 59% of the vote; Bain retained the seat the following year at the 2010 UK general election, but was defeated by Anne McLaughlin of the SNP in 2015.\n\nThe constituency contains two Glasgow City Council wards in full: Dennistoun and Springburn & Robroyston; and also partially covers Canal, Calton, East Centre and North East wards.\n\nThe constituency partially overlaps with two Scottish Parliament seats: Glasgow Maryhill and Springburn and Glasgow Provan.\n\nGlasgow North East is one of seven constituencies covering the Glasgow City council area.

It comprises the communities of Ruchill, Hamiltonhill, Possilpark, Port Dundas, Sighthill, Lambhill, Colston, Milton, Springburn, Royston, Balornock, Barmulloch, Blackhill, Dennistoun, Germiston, Haghill, Carntyne, Robroyston, Provanmill, Riddrie, Hogganfield, Millerston and Ruchazie.\n\nOn commonly used measures like unemployment rate, people eligible for free school meals and educational attainment, Glasgow North East is one of the most deprived constituencies in the United Kingdom. In addition, some parts of the constituency have significant gang-related violence and drug-related crime. These issues are significant across the constituency, but some areas have particular problems: heroin addiction in Possilpark, difficult to let and maintain, system-built tower blocks at Sighthill and Red Road, the latter once known as the tallest public housing in Europe, have now been demolished and the areas are undergoing regeneration, a mixture of pre and post-war housing schemes in Springburn and the post-war scheme in Milton, with housing but few amenities and itself the product of earlier attempts at slum clearance. However, the innermost area of Dennistoun retains the original Victorian tenement grid streets. Dennistoun has seen some gentrification, and is becoming popular with students and young professionals, while to the north there have been some new private housing developments on the outskirts of Glasgow at Robroyston and Hogganfield.\n\nGlasgow North East and its predecessor constituencies had been represented by MPs from the Labour Party with large majorities from the 1935 general election until 2015, when the seat was gained by the SNP during their landslide victory on the largest swing recorded at the general election that year of 39.3% from Labour to SNP. At the following election held just two years later, the seat was regained on a 12% swing by Labour's Paul Sweeney with a narrow majority of 242 votes (0.7%). However, the SNP regained the constituency in 2019.\n\nAccording to the British Election Study, it is the most left-wing seat in the country.\n\nIt had the lowest turnout of any seat at the 2017 United Kingdom general election.\n\n1 As noted at the top of the article, this was the largest swing in the 2015 SNP Landslide.\n\nA by-election was held in November 2009, caused by the resignation of former Speaker of the House of Commons Michael Martin. Labour won fairly comfortably, compared to the surprising SNP win in the neighbouring constituency of Glasgow East in the previous year. The turnout was the lowest in Scottish history.\n\nAs is conventional, Michael Martin (a member of the Labour Party when first elected Speaker) stood as Speaker of the House of Commons in the general election of 2005. The Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats did not stand against him. Other parties did, including the Scottish National Party (the Constitution of which requires that the party fight every seat in Scotland).\n\nThe most notable feature of the result was the relatively large vote for Arthur Scargill's Socialist Labour Party, in an area where it had very little base. This was considered to be a result of voter confusion (and not the first recorded example of its kind). A large number of traditional Labour Party voters may have voted for the Socialist Labour Party in the absence of a named Labour Party candidate on the ballot paper.\n\n\n This reference gives all recent Glasgow City Westminster election results.

In the 1997 Labour landslide, it was won by Jim Murphy who held the seat until Kirsten Oswald of the Scottish National Party was elected in the 2015 SNP landslide. In 2017, the constituency returned to Conservative control for the first time in 20 years, when it was gained by Conservative candidate Paul Masterton. However in the 2019 election Oswald was re-elected, gaining the seat for the SNP once again.\n\nThe constituency has a mostly middle-class electorate and includes affluent areas.\n\nThe constituency was created by the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 for the 1885 general election. It was abolished for the 1983 general election, when it was partially replaced by the new Eastwood constituency.\n\nThe East Renfrewshire constituency was re-established for the 2005 general election, with the same boundaries as the previous Eastwood constituency. Despite the change of name, it is the only constituency in mainland Scotland whose boundaries were unchanged by the 2005 revision of Scottish constituencies.\n\nAs created in 1885 the constituency was one of four covering the area of the county of Renfrewshire (except the burgh of Renfrew and the burgh of Port Glasgow, which were components of Kilmarnock Burghs until 1918). The four constituencies were: East Renfrewshire, West Renfrewshire, Paisley and Greenock. Greenock was enlarged and renamed Greenock and Port Glasgow in 1974.\n\nFrom 1885 the constituency consisted of the parishes of Eastwood, Cathcart, Mearns and Eaglesham, and part of the parish of Govan.\n\nFrom 1918 the constituency consisted of \"The Upper County District, inclusive of all burghs situated therein, except the burghs of Paisley and Johnstone, together with so much of the burgh of Renfrew as is contained within the parish of Govan in the county of Lanark.\"\n\nThe constituency was abolished for the 1983 general election, eight years after the creation of local government regions and districts in 1975. The new constituency, with revised boundaries, was called Eastwood.\n\nIn 1996 the area of the Eastwood constituency became, also, the East Renfrewshire unitary council area.\n\nIn 1999 a Scottish Parliament constituency was created with the name and boundaries of the Eastwood Westminster constituency.\n\nIn the widespread redistribution of Scottish seats for the 2005 general election, the name of the Eastwood Westminster constituency was changed back to \"East Renfrewshire\".\n\nAn outer suburban part of the Glasgow conurbation and the rural hinterland to the south-west of the city, East Renfrewshire is predominantly an affluent, middle-class commuter area with a high proportion of owner-occupiers and professionals. East Renfrewshire has the largest Jewish population of any seat in Scotland, with almost half of Scotland's Jewish population living in that area. \n\nAt the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, East Renfrewshire returned a significant majority against Scottish independence; with a voter turnout of 90.4%, 41,690 votes were cast for \"No\" (63.2%) and 24,287 for \"Yes\" (36.8%). At the 2016 European Union membership referendum, a substantial majority of votes were cast in favour of the United Kingdom remaining in the European Union in East Renfrewshire, with a turnout of 76.1% there were 39,345 \"Remain\" votes (74.3%) to 13,596 \"Leave\" votes (25.7%).\n\nThe area was looked on as safely Conservative before the Labour Party gained the seat in their 1997 landslide victory. East Renfrewshire was subsequently viewed as a relatively safe Labour seat until the SNP gained the seat in their 2015 landslide. \n\nAt the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, the Eastwood constituency, covering a majority of the East Renfrewshire parliamentary constituency, returned Conservative Jackson Carlaw as its constituency MSP with a majority of 1,611 votes (4.5%). In what would prove to be their best performance at a general election in Scotland for 34 years, the Conservatives subsequently gained the East Renfrewshire seat at the 2017 general election; with Paul Masterton being elected with a majority of 4,712 (8.8%) votes over Kirsten Oswald of the Scottish National Party. However, in the 2019 election Oswald regained the seat for the SNP with a majority of 5,426 or 9.8%, meaning the seat remains a marginal constituency.\n\nAlexander Munro MacRobert was appointed Solicitor General for Scotland on 31 December 1925.\n\n"}

{"id": "1801235", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1801235", "title": "Russians in the Baltic states", "text": "Russians in the Baltic states\n\nRussians in the Baltic states describes self-identifying ethnic Russians and other primary Russian-speaking communities in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, commonly referred to collectively as the Baltic states. In 2017, there were 1 million ethnic Russians in the Baltic States, having declined from 1.7 million in 1989, the year of the last census during the Soviet era.\n\nMost of the present-day Baltic Russians are migrants from the Soviet era and their descendants, though a relatively small fraction of them can trace their ancestry in the area back to previous centuries.\n\nAccording to official statistics, in 1920, ethnic Russians (most of them residing there from the times of the Russian Empire) made up 7.82% of the population in independent Latvia, growing to 10.5% in 1935. The share of ethnic Russians in the population of independent Estonia was about 8.2%, of which about half were indigenous Russians living in the areas in and around Pechory and Izborsk which were added to Estonian territory according to the 1920 Estonian-Soviet Peace Treaty of Tartu, but were transferred to the Russian SFSR by the Soviet authorities in 1945. The remaining Estonian territory was 97.3% ethnically Estonian in 1945. The share of ethnic Russians in independent Lithuania (not including the Vilnius region, then annexed by Poland) was even smaller, about 2.5%.\n\nFollowing the terms of the 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, the Soviet Union invaded and occupied and subsequently annexed Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania as Soviet republics in 1940. Germany invaded and occupied the Baltic states in 1941 a week after the first Soviet-conducted mass deportation. Communist party members who had arrived in the area with the initial annexation in 1940 and the puppet regimes established evacuated to other parts of the Soviet Union; those who fell into German hands were treated harshly or murdered. The Soviet Union reoccupied the Baltic states in 1944–1945 as the war drew to a close.\n\nImmediately after the war, a major influx from other USSR republics primarily of ethnic Russians took place in the Baltic states as part of a \"de facto\" process of Russification. These new migrants supported the industrialization of Latvia's economy. Most were factory and construction workers who settled in major urban areas. The influx included the establishment of military bases and associated personnel with the Baltic states now comprising the USSR's \"de facto\" western frontier bordering the Baltic Sea. Many military chose to remain upon retirement, attracted by higher living standards as compared to the rest of the USSR. This led to bitter disputes with Russia regarding the issue of their military pensions after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.\n\nAfter Stalin's death in 1953, the flow of new migrants to the Lithuanian SSR slowed down, owing to different policies on urbanization, economy and other issues than pursued in the Latvian SSR and the Estonian SSR. However, the flow of immigrants did not stop entirely in Lithuania, and there were further waves of Russian workers who came to work on major construction projects, such as power plants.\n\nIn Latvia and Estonia, less was done to slow down Russian immigration. By the 1980s Russians made up about third of the population in Estonia, while in Latvia, ethnic Latvians made up only about half of the population. In contrast, in 1989 only 9.4% of Lithuania's population were Russians.\n\nScholars in international law have noted that \"in accordance with Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, the settlement of Russians in the Baltic States during the period was illegal under international law\" (\"The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies\"). The convention was adopted in 1949, including by the Soviet Union. However, as the Soviet Union maintained the Baltic States joined the USSR voluntarily, it did not consider the convention applicable to the Baltic states.\n\nContinuing the position of their legations or governments in exile, and based on international law and treaties in effect at the time of initial Soviet occupation, the Baltic states view the Soviet presence in the Baltic states as an illegal occupation for its full duration. This continuity of the Baltic states with their first period of independence has been used to re-adopt pre-World War II laws, constitutions, and treaties and to formulate new policies, including in the areas of citizenship and language.\n\nSome of the Baltic Russians, mainly those who had come to live in the region not long before the three countries regained independence in 1991, remigrated to Russia and other ex-Soviet countries in the early 1990s. Lithuania, which had been influenced by immigration the least, granted citizenship automatically. In Latvia and Estonia, those who had no family ties to Latvia prior to World War II did not receive automatic citizenship. Those that failed to request Russian citizenship during the time window it was offered were granted permanent residency \"\"non-citizen\"\" status. (see \"Citizenship\" section).\n\nLithuanian Russians live mainly in cities. In the Lithuanian capital Vilnius, they make up 12% of the population, in Lithuania's third largest city Klaipėda no more than 19%. Other Lithuanian cities, including the second-largest city Kaunas, have lower percentages of Russians, while in most small towns and villages there are very few Russians (with the exception of Visaginas). In all, 5% of Lithuania's population are ethnic Russians.\n\nRussians make up almost a half of the population of Latvia's capital, Riga. In the second largest city Daugavpils, where already before World War I Russians were the second biggest ethnic group after Jews, Russians now make up the majority. Today about 25% of Latvia's population are ethnic Russians.\n\nIn Estonia, Russians are concentrated in urban areas, particularly in Tallinn and the north-eastern county of Ida-Virumaa. As of 2011, 38.5% of Tallinn's population were ethnic Russians and an even higher number – 46.7% spoke Russian as their mother tongue. In 2011, large proportions of ethnic Russians were found in Narva (82%), Sillamäe (about 82%) and Kohtla-Järve (70%). In the second largest city of Estonia – Tartu – ethnic Russians constitute about 16% of the population. In rural areas the proportion of ethnic Russians is very low (13 of Estonia's 15 counties are over 80% ethnic Estonian). Overall, ethnic Russians make up 24% of Estonia's population (the proportion of Russophones is, however, somewhat higher, because Russian is the mother tongue of many ethnic Ukrainians, Belarusians and Jews who live in the country).\n\nDemand for industrial workers drew Russians to settle in larger cities. In all three countries, the rural settlements are inhabited almost entirely by the main national ethnic groups, except some areas in eastern Estonia and Latvia with a longer history of Russian and mixed villages. The Lithuanian city of Visaginas was built for workers at the Ignalina nuclear power plant and therefore has a Russian majority. A 2014 study found that many Russians identified with the place where they lived.\n\nAfter the accession of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania to the European Union on 1 May 2004, many Baltic Russians moved to other EU countries. In particular, tens of thousands of Baltic Russians (especially those with EU citizenship) moved to the United Kingdom and to Ireland, who were the first 'old' EU countries to open up their labour markets to the new members of the EU. Thousands of Russians from Riga, Tallinn and Vilnius, holding EU passports, now live in London, Dublin and other cities in the UK and Ireland. They make up a substantial part of the Russian-speaking community in London. No reliable statistics on their exact numbers exist, as in the UK they are counted as nationals of the Baltic countries, and not as Russians.\n\nIn 2012, Dimitri Medvedev issued a repatriation program designed to resettle ethnic Russians from abroad. So far 10,000 families have settled in the Russian Federation, mostly to Pskov Oblast.\n\nAfter regaining independence in 1991, Latvia and Estonia restored the pre-1940 citizenship laws on the basis of the legal continuity of their statehood throughout 1940 – 1991, automatically recognising citizenship according to the principle of \"jus sanguinis\" for the persons who held citizenship before 16 June 1940 and their descendants. Most of those who had settled on the territory of these republics after their incorporation by the USSR of these states by the USSR in 1940 and their descendants received the right to obtain citizenship through naturalisation procedure, but were not granted citizenship automatically. This policy affected not only ethnic Russians, but also the descendants of those ethnic Estonians and Latvians who emigrated from these countries before independence was proclaimed in 1918. Dual citizenship is also not allowed, except for those who acquired citizenship by birth.\n\nKnowledge of the respective official language and in some cases the Constitution and/or history and an oath of loyalty to established constitutional order was set as a condition for obtaining citizenship through naturalisation. However, the purported difficulty of the initial language tests became a point of international contention, as the government of Russia, the Council of Europe, and several human rights organizations claiming that they made it impossible for many older Russians who grew up in the Baltic region to gain citizenship. As a result, the tests were altered, but a large percentage of Russians in Latvia and Estonia still have non-citizen or alien status. Those who have not applied for citizenship feel they are regarded with suspicion, under the perception that they are deliberately avoiding naturalisation. For many, an important reason not to apply for citizenship is the fact that Russia gives non-citizens preferential treatment: they are free to work or visit relatives in Russia. The citizens of the Baltic states must apply for visas.\n\nThe language issue is still contentious, particularly in Latvia, where there were protests against plans to require at least 60% of lessons in state-funded Russian-language high schools to be taught in Latvian (in the first version of the Law on education this was 100%).\n\nIn contrast, Lithuania granted citizenship to all its residents at the time of independence redeclaration day willing to have it, without requiring them to learn Lithuanian. Probably the main reason that Lithuania took a less restrictive approach than Latvia and Estonia is that whereas in Latvia ethnic Latvians comprised only a small majority of the total population, and in Estonia ethnic Estonians comprised about 70 percent, in Lithuania ethnic Lithuanians were about 80 percent of the population. Therefore, as a matter of voting in national elections or referendums, the opinions of ethnic Lithuanians would likely carry the day if there were a difference in opinion between Lithuanians and the larger minority groups (Russians and Poles), but this was less certain in the other two Baltic countries, especially in Latvia.\n\nSome representatives of the ethnic Russian communities in Latvia and Estonia have claimed discrimination by the authorities, these calls frequently being supported by Russia. On the other hand, Latvia and Estonia deny discrimination charges and often accuse Russia of using the issue for political purposes. In recent years, as the Russian political leaders have begun to speak about the \"former Soviet space\" as their sphere of influence, such claims are a source of annoyance, if not alarm, in the Baltic countries.\n\nEstonia, Latvia and Lithuania have since 2004 become members of NATO and the European Union (EU) to provide a counterbalance to Russia's claims to speak for the interests of ethnic Russian residents of these countries. Furthermore, to satisfy a precondition for their admission to the EU, both Estonia and Latvia slightly adjusted their citizenship policies in response to EU monitoring and requests. Claims of discrimination in basic rights by Russians and other minorities in the region may have less effect now than they did during the years when the Baltic countries' membership applications were still pending with the EU.\n\nThere are a number of political parties and politicians in the Baltic states who claim to represent the Russian-speaking minority. These parties support Russian language rights, demand citizenship for all long-term residents of Latvia and Estonia and tend to be left-wing on other issues. These forces are particularly strong in Latvia represented by the Latvian Russian Union which has one seat in the European parliament held by Tatjana Ždanoka and the more moderate Harmony party which is currently the largest faction in the Saeima with 24 out of 100 deputies, the party of the former Mayor of Riga Nils Ušakovs and with one representative in the European parliament currently Andrejs Mamikins. In Estonia there is similarly the Estonian United Left Party however that party is not represented in the Riigikogu and the Estonian Centre Party is overwhelmingly the most favoured party among Estonian Russians. This is in part because of its co-operation agreement with United Russia, its advocacy of friendlier ties with the Russian government compared to other mainstream Estonian parties and the prevalence Russians and Russophones among the party's municipal councilors and parliamentarians.\n\nIn 2011 pro-Russian groups in Latvia collected sufficient signatures to initiate the process of amending the Constitution to give Russian the status of an official language. On 18 February 2012, constitutional referendum on whether to adopt Russian as a second official language was held. According to the Central Election Commission, 74.8% voted against, 24.9% voted for and the voter turnout was 71.1%. The non-citizen community (290,660 or 14.1% of Latvia's entire population) was non entitled to vote.\n\nFamous modern Baltic Russians include:\n\n\n\n\n"}

He greatly admired American films and was a fan of actors such as John Wayne and Marlon Brando. He also picked up a liking of Broadway musicals, and travels once a year to New York City to watch them. Nakadai was working as a shop clerk in Tokyo before a chance encounter with director Masaki Kobayashi led to him being cast in the film \"The Thick Walled Room\".

Nakadai's role in Seven Samurai is technically his debut as \"The Thick-Walled Room\"'s release was delayed for three years due to controversial subject matter. His major breakthrough as an actor came when he was given the part of Jo, a young yakuza in \"Black River\", another film directed by Kobayashi.

It is situated close to the coast, and about from the hamlet of Bishopstone after which it is named. Train services from the station are provided by Southern, and the station is on the Seaford Branch of the East Coastway Line, measured from .\n\nBefore this station opened the first Bishopstone station was further west at Tide Mills. That was closed in 1938 when the current station opened, but was subsequently reopened under the name of , and survived as such until 1942.\n\nThe present station was designed by the architect James Robb Scott and opened on 26 September 1938, the same day that the original Bishopstone station at Tide Mills was first closed. The Art Deco design is said to be inspired by that of Arnos Grove tube station, which was designed by Charles Holden, and was intended to be the centrepiece of a proposed residential development that never took place due to the outbreak of the Second World War.\n\nThe main building of the station is symmetrical, with an octagonal central booking hall and two extended wings. One of these wings formerly contained the ticket office and parcels office, and the other contained a waiting room and toilets. As-built, the station had two side platforms in a cutting, accessed by stairs from a footbridge linking to the main station building.\n\nIn 1940 a pair of pillboxes was built on the roof of the main station building, flanking its octagonal tower. Despite the times, considerable effort was made to blend these into the original structure, and they are thus well camouflaged.\n\nThe last member of staff to work at the station was withdrawn in 1988. Today the old booking office and parcel office is occupied by a small newsagent, and the remaining station facilities are disused, but the main access to the trains is still via the octagonal booking hall. The line was singled in 1975 and all trains now use the former up platform.\n\nBishopstone Station is a grade II listed building.

He was trained by his cousin, Shawn Michaels, and he took the name Michael Shane, a play on his cousin's name, originating from Michaels' guest appearance in Pacific Blue (TV series). Additionally, Bentley utilizes Michaels' signature superkick maneuver as his own finisher.\n\nAfter being trained at Shawn Michaels' Texas Wrestling Academy, Bentley competed in Japan for the Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling promotion. He also briefly worked for Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) from October 2000 to the final show of the promotion on January 13, 2001. After ECW closed Bentley returned to Japan, where he wrestled under a mask as Omega Verfian. During this time he also made appearances for both World Wrestling Entertainment and World Championship Wrestling in dark matches. He also worked as a jobber on WWE's programs \"Velocity\" and \"Sunday Night Heat\". He is also a former Ring of Honor (ROH) wrestler, with his breakout match occurring against Paul London at the \"Unscripted\" event in September 2002, that concluded with London hitting the shooting star press off a ladder. ROH later described the match as a \"match of the year candidate\". He was also a member of The Group faction in ROH, with Samoa Joe and C.W. Anderson, but they were forced to disband after losing to The Prophecy at \"Night of Grudges\" on June 14, 2003. He later wrestled for Major League Wrestling, where he was managed by Francine, and returned to Japan to compete for Zero-One Wrestling.\n\nBentley joined TNA in 2003. He competed in the X Division, quickly winning the X Division Championship in the first ever Ultimate X match. Later in 2003, Bentley formed a stable with Shane Douglas and Traci known as \"The New Franchise\". In January 2004 he lost the title to Chris Sabin in Ultimate X2. The New Franchise disbanded in April 2004 when Bentley turned on Douglas. Traci ended up staying with Bentley as a valet. In June, A.J. Styles returned to the X Division and won the championship from Kazarian. In an effort to eliminate Styles from the X Division, Bentley and Traci formed a tag team with Kazarian (informally known by the portmanteau of their last names, Shazarian). On July 28, 2004, Bentley and Kazarian defeated Styles in an Ultimate X match when they both pulled down the championship. Surprisingly, the duo was declared co-champions, a first for the X-Division Championship. They lost the title in a Gauntlet for the Gold match two weeks later. Shazarian split up in early 2005 when Kazarian left TNA and signed with WWE.\n\nTraci quietly left Bentley in 2005 to become an assistant for TNA Director of Authority Dusty Rhodes, and later joined with Chris Sabin. In turn, Trinity became Bentley's valet. At Hard Justice, however, in a match between Bentley and Trinity and Sabin and Traci, Bentley and Traci turned on their partners and reunited. In July 2005, Bentley was forced to refrain from using the \"Michael Shane\" alias, which he had used for his entire career, following threats of legal action from World Wrestling Entertainment, the employers of Mike Shane, who had trademarked his name, something which Bentley had neglected to do. After going simply by the name Michael, Bentley decided to go by his real name. All TNA DVD releases featuring matches with Bentley as \"Michael Shane\" have had the on-screen graphics altered and commentary completely replaced to reflect the name change. One such DVD is the pay-per-view Lockdown (2005), included in the \"TNA Anthology: The Epic Set\" box set, in which you can still see the name \"Michael Shane\" on the entrance video playing in the background when he makes his entrance.\nAfter a disappearance from television due to contract renegotiations and a few matches in the X Division, Bentley and Traci turned into fan favorites, largely because of the crowd, which was doing the \"Bentley Bounce\" at the time. On a February 2006 edition of \"Xplosion\", Bentley and his partner Lance Hoyt had some miscommunication during their tag team against the Diamonds in the Rough. After the match, Bentley snapped and attacked Hoyt, thus turning him into a villain. The next week on \"Impact!\" in an interview Bentley announced he was a \"Maverick\", and thus became \"Maverick Matt\". He continued feuding with Hoyt, and lost to him at Destination X. He would then wrestle a few more matches, most being 6-man tag team matches, losing every time. Bentley did not appear on TNA television for the next four months. He returned on the July 20 edition of \"Impact!\", teaming with former partner Frankie Kazarian, who had returned earlier in the week, in a loss against The Naturals. Traci did not return with Bentley, instead becoming Ms. Brooks, Robert Roode's new valet.\n\nOn the October 26 edition of \"Impact!\", Bentley appeared in the \"Raven's Perch\" section of the Impact Zone bleachers, debuting a goth look. Weeks later, Bentley and Kazarian, along with Johnny Devine, formed the stable Serotonin, with Raven as their leader. As part of the new group Bentley's name was changed to Martyr, who along with Kaz and Havok (Devine) portrayed a strange rocker type look and would not win a lot of matches - as a matter of fact, even if they won, Raven would come out, make them get on their knees and beat them with a Kendo stick (as part of a system dubbed \"torture breeds success\"). In August 2007, Bentley's TNA contract expired and was not renewed.\n\nOn April 4, 2008, Bentley made an appearance on \"Friday Night SmackDown\" in a squash match, losing to the debuting Vladimir Kozlov. Following his WWE appearance, Bentley temporarily left wrestling in order to create a band named \"Lost in Chaos\" with his friends. They are currently located in Orlando and participating in numerous gigs. The band was nominated for Florida's Best Band on a local rock station website in 2009.\n\nOn June 27, 2011, Bentley made a one night return to TNA at the tapings of the June 30 edition of \"Impact Wrestling\", losing an opportunity at earning a TNA contract when Low Ki pinned Jimmy Yang in a three–way first round match of an X-Division tournament, where the winner of the tournament would receive a TNA contract. On January 12, 2013, Bentley took part in the taping of TNA's One Night Only: X-Travaganza special (aired on April 5, 2013), competing in a seven-man Xscape match, which was won by Christian York.\n\nOn September 5, 2015, Bentley made his Global Force Wrestling debut defeating Kevin Matthews and Mark Sterling in a three-Way match as part of the GFW Grand Slam Tour.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1801260", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1801260", "title": "Equity sharing", "text": "Equity sharing\n\nEquity sharing is another name for shared ownership or \"co-ownership\". It takes one property, more than one owner, and blends them to maximize profit and tax deductions. Typically, the parties find a home and buy it together as co-owners, but sometimes they join to co-own a property one of them already owns. At the end of an agreed term, they buy one another out or sell the property and split the equity.\n\nEquity sharing became desirable in the United States when in 1981 Section 280A of the Internal Revenue Code allowed mixed tax use of a single property for the first time permitting the occupier to claim principal residence tax deductions and the investor to claim investment property tax deductions. Since shared ownership is conferred by the federal tax code, this ownership vehicle can be used in any state.\n\nCompanies in the United States include Unison Homeownership Investors, Landed, and OwnHome Mortgage & Finance.\n\nThere are many uses of the term \"Equity Sharing\" in the UK. Often applied to different forms of Low Cost Home Ownership schemes. These include equity loans, sometimes referred to as Equity Sharing Loans and some forms of Shared Ownership (part buy/part let) leasehold schemes being referred to as an Equity Sharing Lease. Some local authorities may also refer to resale price restrictions under planning documentation as being Equity Sharing arrangements.\n\nThe UK government facilitates shared equity chiefly through the Homes and Communities Agency. this was under the banner of HomeBuy. This aims to help households earning up to £60,000 p.a.\n\nNew Build HomeBuy is where purchasers buy at least 25% of a newly built home, and pay rent on the remainder. The HCA generally subsidises housing associations or other providers to hold the remaining share. The rent is capped at 3% of the value of the unsold share, but typically set at 2.75%. Purchasers may buy additional shares whenever they can afford to do so; this is known as \"staircasing\".\n\nHomeBuy Direct was introduced in 2009, under which the government and a housing developer jointly fund an equity loan of 30% of the valuation, so that the purchaser only needs to pay a mortgage on 70% of the value. If the purchaser buys an additional share, all three parties participate in any increase in value. The HCA allocated £300 million to the scheme for 2009—2011, and 10,000 homes are available under the initiative.\n\nOpen Market Homebuy allowed purchasers to buy at least 25% of a property on the open market, with a conventional mortgage on that part, and a low-interest loan on the remainder. This is not currently available as the funding for 2009-10 has already been fully committed.\n\nSocial Homebuy allows tenants of participating Councils and housing associations to buy their rented home on shared ownership terms, with a proportion of the usual Right to Acquire discount.\n\nFirstBuy a scheme for first-time buyers announced in the 2011 Budget. Under it first-time buyers can get help to fund the difference between a 5% deposit and a 75% mortgage. It is only available on selected newbuild schemes. The top-up equity is provided in equal shares by the HCA and the developer.\n\nPrivate sector shared equity or, as it is sometimes known, \"investor shared equity\", operates quite differently in that there is no element of taxpayer subsidy. Instead, third party investors provide the difference between the buyer's deposit and (typically) a 75% mortgage, in return for an equity stake in the property and a rent. These schemes are run over 5 or 10 years (sometimes with a 'hardship' extension), meaning that at the end of the relevant period, the owner has to buy out the equity stake at the relevant percentage of the then market value. There is generally no penalty on early redemption or partial buy-backs. Thus, equity sharing can be seen as a step up to full ownership of a property.\n\nAlthough investor shared equity is, on the face of it, more expensive than public sector schemes, because of the need to pay rent on the non-owned portion, it nevertheless holds significant advantages:\n\n\nIn economic theory, ownership is studied in the field of contract theory. Specifically, Oliver Hart (1995) has argued that ownership matters in the context of incomplete contracts. When some future contingencies cannot be taken care of in a contract today, then negotiations will take place tomorrow. Ownership improves the bargaining position in these negotiations. As a result, today an owner has stronger incentives to make relationship-specific investments (i.e., the hold-up problem is mitigated). In this framework, Schmitz (2017) has shown that shared ownership of an asset can be desirable today, even though tomorrow it is optimal to give the asset to the party who values it most. The reason is that shared ownership yields more balanced investment incentives of the involved parties. The optimal ownership shares depend on whether the investments are embodied in the physical capital (so that the owner can always seize the returns) or in the parties’ human capital.\n\n\n"}

It stars Michael Keaton, Teri Garr, Jeffrey Tambor, Ann Jillian, Christopher Lloyd and Martin Mull.\nThe plot revolves around an unemployed Detroit automotive engineer becoming a stay-at-home dad and taking care of three young children, after his wife returns to a career in the advertising business as an executive at a big agency.\n\nLiving with his wife, Caroline, and their three children, Alex, Kenny, and Megan, in a Detroit suburb during the early 1980s recession, Jack Butler and his friends Larry and Stan lose their engineering jobs at the Ford Motor Company. Caroline, having been a housewife for years, uses her college education and experience working in advertising before she left to raise children to re-enter the workforce, leaving Jack to deal with new and bewildering responsibilities of being a stay-at-home dad.\n\nJack discovers that childcare and house maintenance is a complex juggling act, and his initial struggles in daily errands gains the attention and company of other neighborhood housewives. Eventually, he hits his stride and although somewhat distracted by the flirtatious Joan (a neighbor and friend of Caroline's), he begins to feel confined by suburban domestic life. Simultaneously, he feels threatened by Caroline's responsibilities and work-life as a fast-climbing ad executive.\n\nMeanwhile, Caroline contends with challenges in the workforce: her maternal and housekeeping instincts jeopardize her position as a sophisticated executive, and her boss is intent on having his way with her. During a pitch to a hard-to-please client, Caroline's insight as a budget-conscious housewife proves invaluable. The client's president wants her to fly to Los Angeles to help shoot a commercial and in the meantime, Jack's former employer invites him to interview for his old job, but his former boss, Jinx Latham, betrayed his reputation. He lectures them on dirty practices and storms out. Caroline's boss, Ron Richardson, tries to convince her to leave Jack and marry him, while Joan continues to try and seduce Jack. After a commercial shoot in Los Angeles, Caroline relaxes in her hotel bathtub. Ron sneaks into her room with champagne. Back home, Jack tries calling her so the kids can talk to her, but Ron answers. He hangs up, leading Jack to think she is having an affair with him. Caroline fends off Ron's attempts and quits her job.\n\nThe next day dawns with repair people in the home to fix a broken television and spray for bugs. Caroline arrives home unexpectedly, and she and Jack talk over their misunderstandings, reuniting as a stronger couple. Ron stops by, begging Caroline to come back to his company, as the client thinks that only she can properly handle his account. However, she has missed spending time with her children. Jinx also comes begging for Jack to return to work. He accepts his old job on the condition that Larry and Stan join him. On the newly repaired TV, the national commercial Caroline helped produce is being broadcast.\n\n\nWhile working at Motown Productions, story editor and struggling producer Lauren Shuler read an article in \"National Lampoon\" written by John Hughes, and decided to keep in touch with him. One day Hughes told Shuler about a disastrous experience he had looking after his two children in the absence of his wife, which Shuler found hilarious. After Hughes asked if that could make a good movie, she replied that \"it sure sounds funny to me\". Hughes wrote the film, and flew to Los Angeles to rewrite the script with Shuler. As Hughes had a TV deal with Aaron Spelling, he brought him in as an executive producer. Studio executives at Universal Studios, unhappy that Hughes worked in Chicago and not Los Angeles, fired him, bringing in a group of TV writers to remake his script.\n\nAt this point, the studio decided to turn the project into a feature film instead of a television movie. (Shuler, who remained as a producer, declared that while she liked the final product she thought Hughes' original script was better.) Shuler was told by her friend, agent Laurie Perlman, about \"this guy who is really funny\" whom she represented, Michael Keaton. After meeting Keaton and seeing his screen debut, 1982's \"Night Shift\", Shuler decided to send the actor the \"Mr. Mom\" script. Other actors considered for the lead role included Chevy Chase, Michael Douglas, Steve Martin, and John Travolta. In turn Karen Allen, Jane Curtin, Farrah Fawcett, and Sally Field were considered for the role of Caroline before it ultimately went to Teri Garr.\n\nThe film received positive reviews upon its 1983 release. Leonard Maltin gave it 2.5 stars out of 4, stating \"pleasant enough rehash of age-old sitcom premise\", adding \"likable stars make it palatable, but you've seen it all before\". Roger Ebert of \"The Chicago Sun-Times\" similarly gave the film 2 stars out of 4, describing \"Mr Mom\" as \"a lost opportunity\" for resorting to cliches rather than finding humor in the characters as portrayed by the \"promising\" and talented cast.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 82% based on reviews from 22 critics. On Metacritic, it received a weighted average score of 50% based on reviews from 7 critics.\n\nThe film opened to limited release on July 22, 1983, with $947,197, earning the number 13 spot that weekend. Upon its wide release on August 19, 1983, a month later, it opened at number 3 with $4,279,384 behind \"Easy Money\"s opening weekend and \"Risky Business\" third. \"Mr. Mom\" ended up earning $64 million domestically. Its success led Universal to sign a three-picture deal with Hughes for $30 million. (Those three films he would later release for the studio were \"Sixteen Candles\", \"The Breakfast Club\", and \"Weird Science\".)\n\nOn October 10, 2018, it was announced that MGM and Walmart's streaming service Vudu were developing a television adaptation of the 1983 film, which will serve as a continuation of the film following an adult Megan Butler heading back into the workforce while her husband takes over the parental duties of their two children. The series serves as the first original series for the streaming service and stars Andrea Anders and Hayes MacArthur as Megan and Greg Anderson respectively, and premiered on September 12, 2019.\n\n\n"}

The aim of the bill was to reorganize the Canadian Army, the Royal Canadian Navy and the Royal Canadian Air Force, previously separate and independent services, under one umbrella. Following the debate in the House of Commons and further examination by the Defence Committee, the Bill was given a third and final reading in April 1967, clearing the way for unification. The \"Canadian Forces Reorganization Act\" came into effect on 1 February 1968, creating one organization responsible for the defence of Canada, the Canadian Forces, and amending the \"National Defence Act\".\n\nThe Queen's Regulations and Orders are enabled by the \"National Defence Act\" to govern the Canadian Forces. The \"National Defence Act\" establishes Non-Public Property (NPP) as a special class of Crown property to be used for the benefit of serving and former members of the Canadian Forces and their families.

His career has subsequently been quite closely linked with the more famous Moore – the pair collaborated under pseudonyms (Steve's pseudonym was \"Pedro Henry\", Alan's was \"Curt Vile\") on strips for \"Sounds\" magazine, including one which introduced the character Axel Pressbutton, who was later to feature in the \"Warrior\" anthology comic, as well as a standalone series published by Eclipse Comics.\n\nMoore has long been linked to Alan Moore, who has known him \"since he [Alan] was fourteen\" referring to him as \"a friend... fellow comic writer [and] a fellow occultist\". Moore and Moore have so often been linked together that Alan joked that Steve would have 'no relation' engraved on his tombstone.\n\nMoore was an editor of Bob Rickard's long-running UK-based \"Journal of the Unexplained\" \"Fortean Times\". In later years, he also edited that publication's more academic sister-publication \"Fortean Studies\". He is listed as a 'specialist contributor' to the \"Chambers Dictionary of the Unexplained\", which also notes that he compiled the \"Fortean Times\"' General Index, and several derivative books. He was a freelance writer on diverse topics, and said he \"lives in London [where he] interests himself mainly in ancient and oriental subjects\".\n\nSteve Moore began working for Odhams Press' comics division while still in his teens, and in 1971 he created the UK's first comics fanzine, \"Orpheus\". Moore's comics work has featured in most of the major British comics, particularly in anthologies. He was involved with \"2000 AD\" from its earliest days, writing the second story-arc of their Dan Dare-revival \"Hollow World\" (Progs 12–23), and devising the \"Future Shocks\" format for Prog #25 with his \"King of the World\".\n\nLater work for \"2000 AD\" includes \"Red Fang\" (with artist Steve Yeowell), \"Valkyries\" (with American artist John Lucas) and a series of one-off short fantasy stories collected under the name \"Tales of Telguuth\" (with multiple artists).\n\nHe wrote the earliest adventures of the Doctor for \"Doctor Who Weekly\" (later \"Doctor Who Magazine\"), as well as co-creating the character Abslom Daak (with artist Steve Dillon) for the same publication. Many stories were reprinted by Marvel and Marvel UK, including as back-up features to Jamie Delano's \"Captain Britain\" in \"The Daredevils\". Also for Marvel UK he wrote \"Hulk\" and \"Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.\" stories in \"Hulk Comic\".\n\nHe also wrote several stories in \"Warrior\", including, as Pedro Henry, a revival of his Axel Pressbutton character from \"Sounds\".\n\nHe was featured in the anthology \"A1\" (including a strip with fellow-Fortean Hunt Emerson on \"Fortean Times\" in #2).\n\nHe wrote \"Young Tom Strong\" and \"Jonni Future\" in \"Tom Strong's Terrific Tales\", a 12 issue anthology series from Alan Moore's America's Best Comics line.\n\nHe wrote the novelisation of the film \"V for Vendetta\", based on the comics of the same name, by Alan Moore and David Lloyd.\n\nIn 2006 Alan Moore released a biographical essay on Moore called \"Unearthing\", which in 2010 became an audiobook.\n\nAt the time of his death, he was co-writing \"The Moon and Serpent Bumper Book of Magic\" with Alan Moore, planned to be published by Top Shelf.\n\nSteve Moore had an abiding, and scholarly, interest in the history and mythology of China. Somehow, in the early 1980s this came to the attention of Bob Guccione who commissioned a three-part series on \"Brothels of the Orient\" for his soft-porn magazine \"Penthouse\". Steve objected that he had never even been to the Far East, let alone resorted to its brothels. Guccione's advice was to 'just make it up.' While Moore found the subject matter distasteful, he was promised a very substantial fee. Consequently, Moore accepted the commission on condition that it be published under the pseudonym \"Pedro Henry\". This name was an amalgam of Pedro McGregor (author of \"Brazilian Magic\", a book which he was reading at the time) and O. Henry, the short-story writer. The articles appeared under Moore's own name, causing him no little embarrassment. He claimed that his subsequent use of the 'Pedro Henry' pseudonym was an attempt to distance himself from Steve Moore the lascivious denizen of oriental houses of ill-repute.\n\nMoore was also a dedicated student and practitioner of the I Ching and consulted it every morning, without fail, from 1969 onwards, recording the results in his 'I Ching diary'. In 1988, he published \"The Trigrams of Han: Inner Structures of the I Ching\". This scholarly work led Moore to be inducted into The Royal Asiatic Society as a Fellow.\n\nFrom 1995 until its final issue in 2002, Moore edited \"The Oracle, The Journal of Yijing Studies\".\n\nHe was a co-author of \"I Ching: An Annotated Bibliography\", published in 2002.\n\nHe scripted Marvel Comics' adaptation of the James Bond film \"Octopussy\", published in \"Marvel Comics Super Special\" #26 (1983).\n\nHis work has also been published by Eclipse Comics in the US, much of it reprinted from \"Warrior\". He wrote most of the stories for \"John Bolton's Halls of Horror\", as well as \"Axel Pressbutton\" and \"Laser Eraser and Pressbutton\".\n\nAlan Moore wrote a long biographical essay about Steve Moore, entitled \"Unearthing\" and included in the Iain Sinclair-edited anthology \"\". In early 2008, it was reported that this essay was being adapted into a \"photo-illustrated hardcover novel, with some fumetti elements and visuals by Mitch Jenkins,\" to be published by Top Shelf Comics.\n\nLater work includes \"Hercules: The Thracian Wars\" at Radical Comics which Peter Berg has optioned in conjunction with Universal Studios and Spyglass Entertainment. He is following that with \"Hercules: The Knives of Kush\", a 5-issue limited series set in Egypt. Moore said this was his final comics work for now, although he was still writing in other areas:\n\nIn October 2011, Moore released a novel, \"Somnium: A Fantastic Romance\", published by nthposition press. The story follows a young man who is trying to write a book based on the legendary romance of Endymion and the moon goddess Selene. It is thus, in part, self-referential as Steve was writer who worshiped Selene and who saw himself in the role of Endymion, her mortal lover. The parallels are limited though, as he did not, for instance, have a sister. [Steve's personal communications with Mike Crowley.] The book is set in a real inn, called The Bull, at the summit of Shooters Hill. It was Steve's \"local\", being within five minute's walk of his home. The story is remarkably static as it happens entirely within the confines of this inn but includes excursions into the 16th, 18th and 19th century episodes (also occurring in The Bull) which reflect the obsessions of the central character.\n\nWork for \"2000 AD\" include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is from .\n\nThe station and all trains that call are operated by Southern.\n\nThe line used to continue to and until 1969.\n\nThe first station was opened in 1858 by the Lewes and Uckfield Railway Company and was situated south of the High Street level crossing. It became a through station when the line was extended to Tunbridge Wells West in 1868.\nWith the closure of the line south to Lewes in 1969 the original station found itself stranded on the wrong side of a level crossing on the High Street which created traffic congestion whenever a train was arriving or departing from the station. The decision was therefore made to close the original station and to open a new station on the other side of the High Street level crossing. The present Uckfield station opened in 1991 replacing the original structure which was sited to the south. The original station was demolished on 9 December 2000 after it had been damaged by flooding.\n\nAs part of Network Rail's national stations improvement programme, Uckfield received a new station building to replace the 1991 portakabin-type structure which was deemed \"not fit for purpose\". The new building was built to Network Rail's modular, pre-fabricated design used at and . The components for Uckfield's new station building - consisting of a ticket office, public toilet, staff accommodation, ticket hall and café - were manufactured by Britspace in Yorkshire and installed by contractors Bryen & Langley. The new building, which cost £750,000, was opened for passenger use on 16 March 2010.\n\nThe typical off-peak service is one train per hour to , calling at , , , Ashurst, , , , , and . On Sundays this is reduced to an hourly shuttle to Oxted calling at all stations. Previously, most off peak trains from Uckfield only went as far as Oxted (with an interchange with East Grinstead line services), but since Southern has taken over the service, it has been extended and passenger numbers have risen. In December 2010 a new later evening service from London Bridge (around 11pm) was introduced allowing passengers for the first time in recent years to travel home from London in the late evening.\n\nPlatforms on the Uckfield branch of the Oxted Line were extended in 2016 to hold ten carriage trains to allow longer services to run during peak hours. The extension of services to ten coaches caused Southern to acquire four Class 170 Turbostars from ScotRail, increasing capacity. The Class 170s were converted to Class 171s to allow full compatibility with Southern's existing Class 171 fleet.\n\nWhereas the neighbouring East Grinstead line has 750 V DC electric traction, motive power on Uckfield line is provided by Class 171 diesel multiple units. It has been proposed many times that the line be electrified, but this is considered too expensive for the amount of passenger traffic. Rail usage figures published in March 2010 showed that journeys from the station had increased by 179% in the five years to 2008/09.\n\nSince 1986 there had been a campaign to re-open the line south of Uckfield through to Lewes, known as the Wealden Line, which attracted cross-party support. In 2008 the \"Wealdenlink\" presentation was published which gave new impetus to the campaign for reinstatement. On 23 July 2008 the Central Rail Corridor Board (a joint group of local councils and stakeholders) commissioned study by Network Rail reported that there was not an economic case for reopening, citing a £141 million cost and an low \"benefit-cost ratio\" of 0.64 to 0.79 when a figure of 1.5 is the minimum required by the Department for Transport to make a scheme viable.\n\n"}
{"id": "1801336", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1801336", "title": "Adam Mitchell (Doctor Who)", "text": "Adam Mitchell (Doctor Who)\n\nAdam Mitchell is a fictional character in the British science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\", played by Bruno Langley. Adam is introduced in the first series of the programme's revival as the second television companion of the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston). However, unlike the Ninth Doctor's primary companion, Rose Tyler (Billie Piper), who provided an effective human contrast to the Doctor's centuries-old alien, Adam was created to provide an example of an inept time traveller.\n\nThe character is introduced as a boy genius from the year 2012 who attracts the attention of the Doctor's traveling companion Rose after she and the Doctor meet him in his place of work. Despite Rose's willingness to accept Adam as a fellow traveller, the Doctor is skeptical. After Adam attempts to use information from the future for his own gain, the Doctor throws Adam out of his time machine, the TARDIS. This was the first example of the Doctor forcing a companion to leave because of negative behaviour.\n\nAdam was created during executive producer Russell T Davies original pitch to the BBC as part of his plans to revive \"Doctor Who\" for the channel. Though established early in the series' planning, Adam was always intended to be a short-term character. Though reviewers generally reacted negatively to the character, Adam's role as a foil to the stock companion figure has been praised alongside the moral lessons of his departure.\n\nAdam first appears in the first series episode \"Dalek\" (2005) as a young researcher under the employ of Henry van Statten (Corey Johnson), who is the owner of a museum of extraterrestrial artefacts in an underground bunker in Utah. Adam mentions that he is a genius, having successfully hacked into the United States Department of Defense computers when he was eight years old. He quickly forms a mutual attraction with the Doctor's companion Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) and informs her of his desire to see the stars. When a live Dalek manages to break free and slaughter its way through the base, Adam finds himself fleeing along with Rose. At the end of the episode, when van Statten's museum is closed down, Rose asks the Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) to take Adam along with them in the TARDIS. The Doctor is reluctant, but Rose convinces him to let Adam follow them into the TARDIS.\n\nIn the following episode, \"The Long Game\", the Doctor, Rose, and Adam arrive on a space station in the year 200,000, and Adam is overwhelmed by culture shock. Tempted by the wealth of information and technology available to him, he has an advanced computer interface port, activated by a click of the fingers, installed in his head that allows him to access the future's computer system. He attempts to transmit information back to 21st century Earth using Rose's modified mobile phone, but this backfires when the villains running the station attempt to extract information on the Doctor directly from Adam's brain. As punishment of Adam's breach of trust, the Doctor returns him home, despite his pleading, and destroys his answering machine. When Adam's mother (Judy Holt) returns home, she reacts with shock and horror after inadvertently activating the implant installed in his forehead.\n\nIn the 2013 comic book series \"Prisoners of Time\", released to celebrate the 50th anniversary, Adam is the main antagonist. After his mother dies he acquires a Vortex Manipulator and plans to kidnap the Doctor's companions for revenge due to the Doctor preventing him from acquiring technology that could have saved her, tracking down all eleven Doctors and abducting their companions at various points in their lives. At the end of the story, Adam is revealed to have allied himself with a past version of the Master as the two confront the Eleventh Doctor, Adam offering to spare one companion of the Doctor's choice while killing the others. However, the Doctor turns the tables on Adam by summoning his past selves to aid him, as well as arranging for Frobisher to be captured while posing as Peri, allowing him to escape captivity and sabotage Adam's equipment to release the rest of the companions. When the Master reveals his true goal of channeling chronal energy through the TARDIS to destroy the universe, Adam is given a unique chance at redemption as he sacrifices himself to destroy the Master's equipment. In his last moments, he is reconciled with the Ninth, Tenth and Eleventh Doctors, and Rose, and acknowledged as a \"true companion\" on his gravestone, receiving posthumous validation by the eleven Doctors and his fellow companions.\n\nMitchell appears in \"The Ninth Doctor Chronicles\" which was released in May 2017.\n\nThe character of Adam Mitchell was first conceived, along with Henry van Statten, during Russell T Davies' 2003 pitch to the BBC, in a story heavily based on Robert Shearman's audio play \"Jubilee\", which would later form the base for the episode \"Dalek\". It was always the intention of the production team for Adam to join the TARDIS after Rose developed a liking for him. To play this role Langley was chosen, mostly because of his role on \"Coronation Street\" as Todd Grimshaw. He had auditioned for the role on the same day as doing publicity for his leaving storyline in \"Coronation Street\". Reacting to his casting Langley, remarked that \"I couldn't have asked for a better next role because \"Doctor Who\" is another great institution.\" Langley describes Adam as \"a bit nerdy\" and states of his character's attraction to Rose that \"she's a very pretty girl and Adam hasn't seen any girls for a long time.\"\n\nSince 1963, the perennial companion figure in \"Doctor Who\" generally serves to remind the Doctor of his \"moral duty\". However, Adam was never meant to be a long-term companion. In the behind-the-scenes book \"Doctor Who: The Inside Story\" Davies explains that he \"always wanted to do a show with someone who was a rubbish companion\" and dubs Adam \"the companion that couldn't\". In an episode of \"Doctor Who Confidential\" he characterised Adam as \"a little bit ambitious and \"a little bit too clever for his own good.\" Langley added that the character ends up \"on the wrong side of the tracks\" because he likes \"meddling with things\" and that \"him thinking he's a genius gets him into bother\". Explaining Adam's downfall, Davies states that he \"doesn't realize he's out for his own good until he's put in a situation of temptation, where knowledge, information and power are put in front of him.\" Davies felt that Adam's story provided \"a chance to see someone starting on that path\" before the Doctor cuts his ambitions short.\n\nOriginally, there were several aspects of the character that were cut before appearing on screen: in early drafts, he was the son of Henry van Statten. In the DVD commentary for \"The Long Game\" director Brian Grant and actor Bruno Langley discuss Adam's scripted motive of bringing future medical knowledge back home to cure his father, who was suffering from ill health, though this motive did not remain in the final episode. To promote the character during the week \"The Long Game\" was first broadcast, the in-universe tie-in website \"Who is Doctor Who?\" announced that \"14 year-old Adam Mitchell from Nottingham\" had won a competition arranged by van Statten the previous week. Adam's winning essay on \"Why I Want To Meet An Alien\" mentions a desire to acquire advanced knowledge from them with the explanation \"I don't think it's cheating, really. It's just a shortcut\".\n\nDek Hogan of Digital Spy reacted negatively to Adam's introduction in \"Dalek\" stating he \"didn’t really see the point of Todd Grimshaw out of Corrie popping up.\" He suggested it would have been more entertaining had the episode featured Langley's screen mother from \"Coronation Street\" instead. Ian Hyland of the \"Sunday Mirror\" also disliked Adam's introduction, describing \"the introduction of a puppy-love sequence between Rose and a cute English boy\" as \"very, very irritating\". \"SFX Magazine\" commented on the similarity between Adam's introduction to the future and that of Rose in \"The End of the World\" stating \"it was clearly a deliberate parallel on Russell's part, as part of his scheme to contrast and compare the reactions of Rose and Adam\". Their website reviewer observed that Adam's \"comedy faint\" marked him out as an unsuitable traveller. Marc Edward DiPaulo of the University of Oklahoma notes that Adam's role in \"The Long Game\" is to provide satire on the media and to function as \"a condemnation of those who cannot stop immersing themselves in television, the Internet, iPods, and other nonstop broadcasters of what the Doctor calls 'useless information.'\" Fraser McAlpine, reviewing Adam's appearances as companion for BBC America's Anglophenia blog describes him as a \"craven meddler\" and a \"social climber\". By virtue of his failures, Adam becomes \"the companion that proves the worth of all of the other companions\".\n\nIn their book \"Who is the Doctor\", Graeme Burk and Robert Smith described Adam in \"Dalek\" as \"somewhat annoying\". Burk referred to him in \"The Long Game\" as \"arrogant and narcissistic\", which made Rose appear shallow for insisting he travel with them, but felt that Langley did \"a superb job\" conveying the character's flaws. He stated that it was \"a shame\" that the backstory of Adam's motivations were cut from the script, as it would have made his character more believable. The two found a logical flaw in the Doctor's decision to drop Adam off, as it was a possibility that someone could get their hands on the future technology. \"Radio Times\" reviewer Patrick Mulkern gave a positive overview of Adam, describing the character as \"bumptious yet likeable\" and his departure as \"literary precision\". He commented that Adam \"adds an interesting dynamic, subtly different\" from Mickey Smith and Captain Jack Harkness, who also worked with Rose and the Ninth Doctor. Instead of threatening the Doctor and Rose's relationship, Adam \"serves to strengthen it\". In 2010 Mark Harrison of Den of Geek listed the character's exit from the TARDIS as the tenth greatest companion farewell scene stating that it was \"great to get a glimpse of the Doctor outright booting someone out.\" He felt that the character \"struck out in spectacular fashion\" by attempting to steal future technology and that his eventual fate was an example of poetic justice. Charlie Jane Anders also praised the concept of Adam's story arc positioning his departure as the seventh most depressing exit from a companion in \"Doctor Who\"s history. She felt that to have \"a companion who flunks out\" was one of Davies' \"cleverest ideas\" as executive producer of the series and that Adam's human flaws made him relatable. In 2010 readers of the \"Radio Times\" voted Adam the 45th most popular companion, out of forty-eight viable options.\n\n"}

The cellist and conductor has an unusually broad repertoire from the earliest baroque up to contemporary music. He was the first musician to play in the West works of the Russian and Lithuanian avant garde and many composers dedicated works to him. For his worldwide engagement for Lithuanian music and its composers he was awarded highest distinctions of his country. In October 2006 the President of the Federal Republic of Germany Horst Köhler awarded the \"Verdienstkreuz 1. Klasse des Verdienstordens der Bundesrepublik Deutschland\" (Federal Cross of Merit) to David Geringas for his overall efforts as musician and German Cultural Ambassador to the world music scene.\n\nBorn in Vilnius, Lithuania, David Geringas studied at the Moscow Conservatory from 1963 until 1973 with Mstislav Rostropovich. In 1970 David Geringas won the First Prize and the gold medal at the Tchaikovsky competition. In 2000 he took over a professorship of cello at the Hochschule für Musik \"Hanns Eisler\" in Berlin. Moreover, he is honorary professor at the Moscow Conservatory. David Geringas also heads various master-classes all over the world for the up-and-coming musicians. His students are winners of prizes and awards of international competitions.\n\nRenowned composers of contemporary music dedicated works to David Geringas, thus the Concerto in Do by Anatolijus Šenderovas, being played by David Geringas for the first time in 2002 and being awarded the European Composers Prize in Berlin, the Cello Concerto by Ned Rorem, world premiere 2003 in the USA, the Cello Concertos by Vytautas Laurušas and by Vidmantas Bartulis, world premiere 2004 respective 2005 in Lithuania. A special event was the world premiere of Anatolijus Šenderovas' work \"David's Song for Cello and String Quartet\" in July 2006 in Kronberg which the composer had written on the occasion of David Geringas' 60th birthday.\n\nHe has been teaching at the Accademia Musicale Chigiana in Siena since 2005.\n\nDavid Geringas' concerts with the Symphonieorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks, the Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra, the Moscow State Philharmonic Orchestra, the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande and the Berner Symphonie-Orchester, the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra as well as his first performance with the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra at once being reinvited for 2007, belong among others to the highlights of the concert season 2005/2006. He was also guest at prestigious festivals in Germany, Great Britain and France this summer.\nIn the season 2006/2007 David Geringas will give concerts among others with the Beethoven Orchester Bonn, the Nationaltheater-Orchester Mannheim and the Galicia Symphony Orchestra. On the occasion of D. Shostakovich's 100th Birthday David Geringas is invited by the Tonhalle Düsseldorf to arrange and to head a weekend of several performances dedicated to the composer.\n\nFor about 50 CDs which David Geringas has up to now recorded he received a large number of distinctions, among them the Grand Prix du Disque for the recording of the 12 cello concerti by Luigi Boccherini. His extensive discography also includes many award-winning recordings such as the chamber music by Henri Dutilleux (Diapason d'Or) or the cello concertos by Hans Pfitzner (Jahrespreis der Deutschen Schallplattenkritik).\n\n\nDavid Geringas is also a welcome guest at international chamber music stages. So Tatjana Geringas and Ian Fountain belong to his closest partners on the piano. In the season 2004/2005 David Geringas gave together with Ian Fountain a concert series entitled \"Beethoven plus…\" at the Philharmonie Berlin. He also works closely together with the Artemis Quartett, the Vogler-Quartett and the Bläserquintett of the Staatskapelle Berlin.\n\nTo an ever-growing extent David Geringas has been engaged as conductor. Among others he conducted the Norddeutsche Philharmonie Rostock, the Kammerphilharmonie of the MDR Leipzig, the Jenaer Philharmonie, the chamber orchestra of the Wiener Symphoniker (Concert-Verein), the Danish National Symphony Orchestra/DR, das Iceland Symphony Orchestra, the Kremerata Baltica as well as orchestras in Lithuania, Italy, the Netherlands, Mexico and Costa Rica. In February 2007 David Geringas will conduct for the first time the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra, give his debut as conductor in China in the 2007/2008 season and will be guest again in Japan.\n\nFor his first CD recording as conductor he received the 'Choc de la Musique' of the music magazine \"Le Monde de la musique\".\n\nSince 2005 David Geringas has been Chief Guest Conductor of the Kyushu Symphony Orchestra.\n\nDavid Geringas plays a G. B. Guadagnini cello made in 1761.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1801361", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1801361", "title": "Fire temple", "text": "Fire temple\n\nA fire temple in Zoroastrianism is the place of worship for Zoroastrians, often called \"dar-e mehr\" (Persian) or \"agiyari\" (Gujarati). In the Zoroastrian religion, fire (see \"atar\"), together with clean water (see \"aban\"), are agents of ritual purity. Clean, white \"ash for the purification ceremonies [is] regarded as the basis of ritual life\", which \"are essentially the rites proper to the tending of a domestic fire, for the temple [fire] is that of the hearth fire raised to a new solemnity\". For, one \"who sacrifices unto fire with fuel in his hand ..., is given happiness\".\n\n, there were 167 fire temples in the world, of which 45 were in Mumbai, 105 in the rest of India, and 17 in other countries. There is a religious custom in India of not allowing Zoroastrian women to enter the Fire Temple and the Tower of Silence if they marry a non-Zoroastrian person. This custom has been challenged before the Supreme Court of India after a Zoroastrian woman was denied entry into Zoroastrian institutions.\n\nFirst evident in the 9th century BCE, the Zoroastrian rituals of fire are contemporary with that of Zoroastrianism itself. It appears at approximately the same time as the shrine cult and is roughly contemporaneous with the introduction of \"Atar\" as a divinity. There is no allusion to a temple of fire in the Avesta proper, nor is there any Old Persian language word for one.\n\nThat the rituals of fire was a doctrinal modification and absent from early Zoroastrianism is also evident in the later \"Atash Nyash\". In the oldest passages of that liturgy, it is the hearth fire that speaks to \"all those for whom it cooks the evening and morning meal\", which Boyce observes is not consistent with sanctified fire. The temple is an even later development: from Herodotus it is known that in the mid-5th century BCE the Zoroastrians worshipped to the open sky, ascending mounds to light their fires. Strabo confirms this, noting that in the 6th century, the sanctuary at Zela in Cappadocia was an artificial mound, walled in, but open to the sky, although there is no evidence whatsoever that the Zela-sanctuary was Zoroastrian. Although the \"burning of fire\" was a key element in Zoroastrian worship, the burning of \"eternal\" fire, as well as the presence of \"light\" in worship, was also a key element in many other religions.\n\nBy the Hellenic Parthian era (250 BCE–226 CE), there were two places of worship in Zoroastrianism: one, called \"bagin\" or \"ayazan\", was a sanctuary dedicated to a specific divinity; it was constructed in honor of the patron saint (or angel) of an individual or family and included an icon or effigy of the honored. The second, the \"atroshan\", were the \"places of burning fire\" which became more and more prevalent as the iconoclastic movement gained support. Following the rise of the Sassanid dynasty, the shrines to the Yazatas continued to exist, but with the statues – by law – either abandoned or replaced by fire altars.\n\nAlso, as Schippman observed, there is no evidence even during the Sassanid era (226–650 CE) that the fires were categorized according to their sanctity. \"It seems probable that there were virtually only two, namely the \"Atash-i Vahram\" [literally: \"victorious fire\", later misunderstood to be the Fire of Bahram], and the lesser \"Atash-i Adaran\", or 'Fire of Fires', a parish fire, as it were, serving a village or town quarter\". Apparently, it was only in the \"Atash-i Vahram\" that fire was kept continuously burning, with the \"Adaran\" fires being annually relit. While the fires themselves had special names, the structures did not, and it has been suggested that \"the prosaic nature of the middle Persian names (\"kadag\", \"man\", and \"xanag\" are all words for an ordinary house) perhaps reflect a desire on the part of those who fostered the temple-cult ... to keep it as close as possible in character to the age-old cult of the hearth-fire, and to discourage elaboration\".\n\nThe Battle of al-Qādisiyyah (636 CE) and the Battle of Nihavānd (642 CE) were instrumental to the collapse of the Sassanid Empire and state-sponsored Zoroastrianism; destruction or conversion (mosques) of some fire temples in Greater Iran followed. The faith was practiced largely by the aristocracy but large numbers of fire temples did not exist. Some fire temples continued with their original purpose although many Zoroastrians fled. Legend says that some took fire with them and it most probably served as a reminder of their faith in an increasingly persecuted community since fire originating from a temple was not a tenet of the religious practice.\n\nThe oldest remains of what has been identified as a fire temple are those on Mount Khajeh, near Lake Hamun in Sistan. Only traces of the foundation and ground-plan survive and have been tentatively dated to the 3rd or 4th century BCE. The temple was rebuilt during the Parthian era (250 BCE-226 CE), and enlarged during Sassanid times (226–650 CE).\n\nThe characteristic feature of the Sassanid fire temple was its domed sanctuary where the fire-altar stood. This sanctuary always had a square ground plan with a pillar in each corner that then supported the dome (the \"gombad\"). Archaeological remains and literary evidence from \"Zend\" commentaries on the Avesta suggest that the sanctuary was surrounded by a passageway on all four sides. \"On a number of sites the \"gombad\", made usually of rubble masonry with courses of stone, is all that survives, and so such ruins are popularly called in Fars \"čahār-tāq\" or 'four arches'.\"\n\nRuins of temples of the Sassanid era have been found in various parts of the former empire, mostly in the southwest (Fars, Kerman and Elam), but the biggest and most impressive are those of Adur Gushnasp in Media Minor (see also The Great Fires, below). Many more ruins are popularly identified as the remains of Zoroastrian fire temples even when their purpose is of evidently secular nature, or are the remains of a temple of the shrine cults, or as is the case of a fort-like fire temple and monastery at Surkhany, Azerbaijan, that unambiguously belongs to another religion. The remains of a fire-altar, most likely constructed during the proselytizing campaign of Yazdegerd II (\"r.\" 438-457) against the Christian Armenians, have been found directly beneath the main altar of the Echmiadzin Cathedral, the Mother See of the Armenian Apostolic Church.\n\nApart from relatively minor fire temples, three were said to derive directly from Ahura Mazda, thus making them the most important in Zoroastrian tradition. These were the \"Great Fires\" or \"Royal Fires\" of Adur Burzen-Mihr, Adur Farnbag, and Adur Gushnasp. The legends of the Great Fires are probably of antiquity (see also \"Denkard\" citation, below), for by the 3rd century CE, miracles were said to happen at the sites, and the fires were popularly associated with other legends such as those of the folktale heroes Fereydun, Jamshid and Rustam.\n\nThe \"Bundahishn\", an encyclopaediaic collection of Zoroastrian cosmogony and cosmology written in Book Pahlavi, which was finished in the 11th or 12th century CE, states that the Great Fires had existed since creation and had been brought forth on the back of the ox \"Srishok\" to propagate the faith, dispel doubt, and protect all humankind. Other texts observe that the Great Fires were also vehicles of propaganda and symbols of imperial sovereignty.\n\nThe priests of these respective \"Royal Fires\" are said to have competed with each other to draw pilgrims by promoting the legends and miracles that were purported to have occurred at their respective sites. Each of the three is also said to have mirrored social and feudal divisions: \"The fire which is Farnbag has made its place among the priests; ... the fire which is Gūshnasp has made its place among the warriors; ... the fire which is Būrzīn-Mitrō has made its place among agriculturists\" (\"Denkard\", 6.293). These divisions are archaeologically and sociologically revealing, because they make clear that, since from at least the 1st century BCE onwards, society was divided into four, not three, feudal estates.\nThe Farnbag fire (translated as 'the fire Glory-Given' by Darmesteter) was considered the most venerated of the three because it was seen as the earthly representative of the \"Atar Spenishta\", 'Holiest Fire' of Yasna 17.11, and it is described in a \"Zend\" commentary on that verse as \"the one burning in Paradise in the presence of Ohrmazd.\"\n\nAlthough \"in the eyes of [contemporary] Iranian Zoroastrian priests, the three fires were not 'really existing' temple fires and rather belonged to the mythological realm\", several attempts have been made to identify the locations of the Great Fires. In the early 20th century, A. V. Jackson identified the remains at Takht-i-Suleiman, midway between Urumieh and Hamadan, as the temple of Adur Gushnasp. The location of the Mithra fire, i.e. that of Burzen-Mihr, Jackson \"identified with reasonable certainty\" as being near the village of Mihr half-way between Miandasht and Sabzevar on the Khorasan road to Nishapur. The Indian (lesser) \"Bundahishn\" records the Farnbag fire having been \"on the glory-having mountain which is in Khwarezm\" but later moved \"upon the shining mountain in the district of Kavul just as it there even now remains\" (\"IBd\" 17.6). That the temple once stood in Khwarezm is also supported by the Greater (Iranian) \"Bundahishn\" and by the texts of \"Zadsparam\" (11.9). However, according to the Greater \"Bundahishn\", it was moved \"upon the shining mountain of Kavarvand in the Kar district\" (the rest of the passage is identical to the Indian edition). Darmesteter identified this \"celebrated for its sacred fire which has been transported there from Khvarazm as reported by Masudi\" . If this identification is correct, the temple of the Farnbag fire then lay 10 miles southwest of Juwun, midway between Jahrom and Lar. ()\n\nAccording to Parsi legend, when (over a thousand years ago) one group of refugees from (greater) Khorasan landed in Western Gujarat, they had the ash of such a fire with them. This ash, it is said, served as the bed for the fire today at Udvada.\n\nThis fire temple was not always at Udvada. According to the Qissa-i Sanjan, 'Story of Sanjan', the only existing account of the early years of Zoroastrian refugees in India and composed at least six centuries after their arrival, the immigrants established a \"Atash-Warharan\", 'victorious fire' (see Warharan for etymology) at Sanjan. Under threat of war (probably in 1465), the fire was moved to the Bahrot Caves 20 km south of Sanjan, where it stayed for 12 years. From there, it was moved to Bansdah, where it stayed for another 14 years before being moved yet again to Navsari, where it would remain until the 18th century. It was then moved to Udvada where it burns today.\nAlthough there are numerous eternally burning Zoroastrian fires today, with the exception of the 'Fire of Warharan', none of them are more than 250 years old. The legend that the Indian Zoroastrians invented the \"afrinagan\" (the metal urn in which a sacred fire today resides) when they moved the fire from Sanjan to the Bahrot Caves is unsustainable. Greek historians of the Parthian period reported the use of a metal vase-like urn to transport fire. Sassanid coins of the 3rd-4th century CE likewise reveal a fire in a vase-like container identical in design to the present-day \"afrinagan\"s. The Indian Zoroastrians do however export these and other utensils to their co-religionists the world over.\n\nOne of the more common technical terms – in use – for a Zoroastrian fire temple is \"dar be-mehr\", romanized as \"darb-e mehr\" or dialectically slurred as \"dar-e mehr\". The etymology of this term, meaning 'Mithra's Gate' or 'Mithra's Court' is problematic. It has been proposed that the term is a throwback to the age of the shrine cults, the name being retained because all major Zoroastrian rituals were solemnized between sunrise and noon, the time of day especially under Mithra's protection. Etymological theories see a derivation from \"mithryana\" (so Meillet) or \"*mithradana\" (Gershevitch) or \"mithraion\" (Wilcken). It is moreover not clear whether the term referred to a consecrated inner sanctum or to the ritual precinct.\n\nAmong present-day Iranian Zoroastrians, the term \"darb-e mehr\" includes the entire ritual precinct. It is significantly more common than the older \"atashkada\", a Classical Persian language term that together with its middle Persian predecessors (𐭪𐭲𐭪‎ 𐭠𐭲𐭧𐭱 \"ātaxš-kadag\", \"-man\" and \"-xanag\") literally means 'house of fire'. The older terms have the advantage that they are readily understood even by non-Zoroastrian Iranians. In the early 20th century, the Bombay \"Fasilis\" (see Zoroastrian calendar) revived the term as the name of their first fire temple, and later in that century the Zoroastrians of Tehran revived it for the name of their principal fire temple.\nThe term \"darb-e mehr\" is also common in India, albeit with a slightly different meaning. Until the 17th century the fire (now) at Udvada was the only continuously burning one on the Indian subcontinent. Each of the other settlements had a small building in which rituals were performed, and the fire of which the priests would relight whenever necessary from the embers carried from their own hearth fires. The Parsis called such an unconsecrated building either \"dar-be mehr\" or \"agiary\". The latter is the Gujarati language word for 'house of fire' and thus a literal translation of \"atashkada\". In recent years, the term \"dar-be mehr\" has come to refer to a secondary sacred fire (the \"dadgah\") for daily ritual use that is present at the more prestigious fire temples. Overseas, in particular in North America, Zoroastrians use the term \"dar-be mehr\" for both temples that have an eternally burning fire as well as for sites where the fire is only kindled occasionally. This is largely due to the financial support of such places by one Arbab Rustam Guiv, who preferred the dialectic Iranian form.\n\nFunctionally, the fire temples are built to serve the fire within them, and the fire temples are classified (and named) according to the grade of fire housed within them. There are three grades of fires, the Atash Dadgah, Atash Adaran, and Atash Behram.\n\nThe \"Atash Dadgah\" is the lowest grade of sacred fire, and can be consecrated within the course of a few hours by two priests, who alternatingly recite the 72 verses of the Yasna liturgy. Consecration may occasionally include the recitation of the Vendidad, but this is optional. A lay person may tend the fire when no services are in progress. The term is not necessarily a consecrated fire, and the term is also applied to the hearth fire, or to the oil lamp found in many Zoroastrian homes.\n\nThe next highest grade of fire is the \"Atash Adaran\", the \"Fire of fires\". It requires a gathering of hearth fire from representatives of the four professional groups (that reflect feudal estates): from a hearth fire of the \"asronih\" (the priesthood), the \"(r)atheshtarih\" (soldiers and civil servants), the \"vastaryoshih\" (farmers and herdsmen) and the \"hutokshih\" (artisans and laborers). Eight priests are required to consecrate an \"Adaran\" fire and the procedure takes between two and three weeks.\n\nThe highest grade of fire is the \"Atash Behram\", \"Fire of victory\", and its establishment and consecration is the most elaborate of the three. It involves the gathering of 16 different \"kinds of fire\", that is, fires gathered from 16 different sources, including lightning, fire from a cremation pyre, fire from trades where a furnace is operated, and fires from the hearths as is also the case for the \"Atash Adaran\". Each of the 16 fires is then subject to a purification ritual before it joins the others. Thirty-two priests are required for the consecration ceremony, which can take up to a year to complete.\n\nA temple that maintains an Adaran or Behram fire also maintains at least one Dadgah fire. In contrast to the Adaran and Behram fires, the Dadgah fire is the one at which priests then celebrate the rituals of the faith, and which the public addresses to invoke blessings for a specific individual, a family or an event. Veneration of the greater fires is addressed only to the fire itself – that is, following the consecration of such a fire, only the \"Atash Nyashes\", the litany to the fire in Younger Avestan, is ever recited before it.\n\nA list of the nine Atash Behrams:\n\n\nThe outer façade of a Zoroastrian fire temple is almost always intentionally nondescript and free of embellishment. This may reflect ancient tradition (supported by the prosaic nature of the technical terms for a fire temple) that the principal purpose of a fire temple is to house a sacred fire, and not to glorify what is otherwise simply a building.\n\nThe basic structure of present-day fire temples is always the same. There are no indigenous sources older than the 19th century that describe an Iranian fire temple (the 9th century theologian Manushchir observed that they had a standard floor plan, but what this might have been is unknown), and it is possible that the temples there today have features that are originally of Indian origin. On entry one comes into a large space or hall where congregation (also non-religious) or special ceremonies may take place. Off to the side of this (or sometimes a floor level up or down) the devotee enters an anteroom smaller than the hall he/she has just passed through. Connected to this anteroom, or enclosed within it, but not visible from the hall, is the innermost sanctum (in Zoroastrian terminology, the \"atashgah\", literally 'place of the fire' in which the actual fire-altar stands.\n\nA temple at which a Yasna service (the principal Zoroastrian act of worship that accompanies the recitation of the Yasna liturgy) may be celebrated will always have, attached to it or on the grounds, at least a well or a stream or other source of 'natural' water. This is a critical requirement for the Ab-Zohr, the culminating rite of the Yasna service.\n\nOnly priests attached to a fire temple may enter the innermost sanctum itself, which is closed on at least one side and has a double domed roof. The double dome has vents to allow the smoke to escape, but the vents of the outer dome are offset from those of the inner, so preventing debris or rain from entering the inner sanctum. The sanctum is separated from the anteroom by dividers (or walls with very large openings) and is slightly raised with respect to the space around it. The wall(s) of the inner sanctum are almost always tiled or of marble, but are otherwise undecorated. There are no lights – other than that of the fire itself – in the inner sanctum. In Indian-Zoroastrian (not evident in the modern buildings in Iran) tradition the temples are often designed such that direct sunlight does not enter the sanctuary.\n\nIn one corner hangs a bell, which is rung five times a day at the \"boi\" – literally, '[good] scent' – ceremony, which marks the beginning of each \"gah\", or 'watch'. Tools for maintaining the fire – which is always fed by wood – are simply hung on the wall, or as is sometimes the case, stored in a small room (or rooms) often reachable only through the sanctum.\n\nIn India and in Indian-Zoroastrian communities overseas, non-Zoroastrians are strictly prohibited from entering any space from which one could see the fire(s). While this is not a doctrinal requirement (that is, it is not an injunction specified in the Avesta or in the so-called Pahlavi texts), it has nonetheless developed as a tradition. It is, however, mentioned in a 16th-century \"Rivayat\" epistle (\"R.\" 65). In addition, entry into \"any\" part of the facility is sometimes reserved for Zoroastrians only. This then precludes the use of temple hall for public (also secular) functions. Zoroastrians insist, though, that these restrictions are not meant to offend non-Zoroastrians, and point to similar practices in other religions.\n\nWhen the adherent enters the sanctum he or she will offer bone-dry sandalwood (or other sweet smelling wood) to the fire. This is in accordance with doctrinal statutes expressed in \"Vendidad\" 18.26-27, which in addition to enumerating which fuels are appropriate, also reiterates the injunctions of \"Yasna\" 3.1 and \"Yashts\" 14.55 that describe which fuels are not (in particular, any not of wood).\n\nIn present-day Zoroastrian tradition, the offering is never made directly, but placed in the care of the celebrant priest who, wearing a cloth mask over the nostrils and mouth to prevent pollution from the breath, will then – using a pair of silver tongs – place the offering in the fire. The priest will use a special ladle to proffer the holy ash to the layperson, who in turn daubs it on his or her forehead and eyelids, and may take some home for use after a Kushti ceremony.\n\nA Zoroastrian priest does not preach or hold sermons, but rather just tends to the fire. Fire Temple attendance is particularly high during seasonal celebrations (\"Gahambar\"s), and especially for the New Year (Noruz).\n\nThe priesthood is trigradal. The chief priest of each temple has the title of dastur. Consecration to this rank relieves him of the necessity of purification after the various incidents of life that a lesser priest must expiate. Ordinary priests have the title of mobad, and are able to conduct the congregational worship and such occasional functions as marriages. A mobad must be the son, grandson, or great-grandson of a mobad. The lowest rank is that of herbad, or ervad; these assist at the principal ceremonies.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1801362", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1801362", "title": "Valday, Novgorod Oblast", "text": "Valday, Novgorod Oblast\n\nValday () is a town and the administrative center of Valdaysky District in Novgorod Oblast, Russia, located on the southwestern shore of Lake Valdayskoye, the biggest one in the set of lakes in the highest region of the Valdai Hills, on the M10 Highway connecting Moscow and St. Petersburg, from Moscow and from Veliky Novgorod, the administrative center of the oblast. Population: \n\nIt was first mentioned in a chronicle in 1495. At the time, it was a part of Derevskaya Pyatina of the Novgorod Republic. The growth of Valday was facilitated by construction of a road connecting Novgorod to Central Russia and by the foundation of the Valday Iversky Monastery in 1653, which became a major cultural center. The famous monastery, built under the auspices of Patriarch Nikon in the 1650s, is located on one of the islands of Lake Valdayskoye.\n\nIn the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, the territory was included into Ingermanland Governorate (known since 1710 as St. Petersburg Governorate). In 1727, separate Novgorod Governorate was split off. In 1770, Valday was chartered and became the seat of Valdaysky Uyezd of Novgorod Viceroyalty. In 1796, the viceroyalty was transformed into Novgorod Governorate. Located along the road connecting Moscow and St. Petersburg, Valday developed as a major trade center. The town became the leading center of bell manufacturing in Russia. It also became a major pilgrim destination.\n\nIn August 1927, the uyezds were abolished and, effective October 1, 1927, Valdaysky District was established, with the administrative center in Valday. Novgorod Governorate was abolished as well and the district became a part of Borovichi Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were abolished and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. Valday was close to the eastern front line for Russia during World War II, but was never occupied by German troops. On July 5, 1944, Valdaysky District was transferred to newly established Novgorod Oblast and remained there ever since.\n\nWithin the framework of administrative divisions, Valday serves as the administrative center of Valdaysky District. As an administrative division, it is, together with the \"selo\" of Zimogorye, incorporated within Valdaysky District as the town of district significance of Valday. As a municipal division, the town of district significance of Valday is incorporated within Valdaysky Municipal District as Valdayskoye Urban Settlement.\n\nIn Valday, there are enterprises of timber and food industries, as well as enterprises producing optical devices and pumps.\n\nA railway which connects Bologoye and Pskov via Staraya Russa passes through Valday. The town also has a railway connection with Kresttsy. There is no passenger traffic but the railway is in use for cargo traffic.\n\nValday is located on the M10 Highway which connects Moscow and St. Petersburg. There is a road connection to Okulovka, as well as local roads.\n\nValday is a popular tourist destination, situated in the middle of the Valdaysky National Park, in the northern part of the Valdai Hills. Most tourists visit the lake and the town during the summer. Valday features many recreation facilities and sanatoria, with many camping places available around the lake. The first meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club was also held on the lake.\n\nValday contains forty-three cultural heritage monuments of federal significance and additionally seventy-four objects classified as cultural and historical heritage of local significance. The federal monuments are the ensemble of Valday Iversky Monastery, the Presentation Church, and a park.\n\nThe Valdaysky District Museum, located in Valday, displays two exhibitions. One is devoted to the history of Valday as an uyezd seat in the 19th century. This part of the museum is located in the Mikhaylova House, a 19th-century historical building. The second part, in the former Church of St. Catherine, highlights the history of Valday bell-making. In the end of the 18th and in the 19th century, bell-making was a traditional handicraft in Valday. Big church bells, as well as small bells which were hung to a horse harness, were produced.\n\nVery close to the town on the coast of Lake Valdayskoye there is a residence of the President of Russia.

Balls are formed and then rolled in nib sugar, shredded coconut, or sprinkles. The Oatmeal ball can be eaten immediately, but it is usually first chilled in a refrigerator. \n\nBecause of its simple recipe, it can be quickly made by anyone and is popular at children's parties and as homemade candy.\n\nA similar confectionary, made with Petit Beurre crumbs rather than oatmeal, is popular in Israel where it is called כדור שוקולד \"Kadur Shokolad\", meaning \"chocolate ball\".\n\nThe Oatmeal ball was most likely invented during World War II, in Denmark, where because of the rationing, there was a limited supply of wheat flour, which caused many to look for substitutes. In 1943, Nationaltidende published a small booklet for housewives called \"Ingenuity in a time of crisis\" (), wherein the recipe for \"havregrynskugle\" was found.\n\nOne traditional name for the pastry in Swedish is \"negerboll\" (negro ball). Due to possible racist connotations, this name has fallen out of favor in recent decades, with \"chokladboll\" (chocolate ball) now being the most commonly used name. When made with shredded coconut, it is also known as \"kokosboll\" (coconut ball). The term \"kokosboll\" has been in use longer than the term \"negerboll\".\n\nThe appropriateness of \"negerboll\" as the name of the pastry has been the subject of media debate, intensified by \"neger\" now generally being considered an ethnic slur, having undergone a similar change in tone to English \"negro\". \"Chokladboll\" was first added to the Swedish Academy's glossary Svenska Akademiens ordlista in 2006, with only \"negerboll\" being listed prior. In the 13th (2006) edition, the pastry can be found under both names, with a comment that \"chokladboll\" is the recommended term. In the 14th edition (2015) \"negerboll\" was removed.\n\nIn mid-2003, a bakery owner from Sjöbo was reported to the Swedish Ombudsman against Ethnic Discrimination for using the word \"negerboll\" on a sign in her bakery shop. However, the case was dismissed since the person reporting it did not consider herself personally insulted.\n\nNote that the Danish word \"negerbolle\" is a similarly-dated term for a different confection, namely the flødebolle.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1801364", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1801364", "title": "Samuel Ruiz", "text": "Samuel Ruiz\n\nSamuel Ruiz García (3 November 1924 – 24 January 2011) was a Mexican Roman Catholic prelate who served as bishop of the Diocese of San Cristóbal de las Casas, Chiapas, from 1959 until 1999. Ruiz is best known for his role as mediator during the conflict between the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) and the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), a Mexican political party which had held power for over seventy years, and whose policies were often disadvantageous to the indigenous populations of Chiapas. Inspired by Liberation Theology, which swept through the Roman Catholic Church in Latin America after the 1960s, Ruiz's diocese helped some hundreds of thousands of indigenous Maya people in Chiapas who were among Mexico's poorest marginalized communities.\n\nSamuel Ruiz García was the first of five children, born on 3 November 1924 in Guanajuato, Mexico, to Guadalupe García, who worked as a maid for upper-class families, and Maclovio Ruiz Mejía, an agricultural worker. Ruiz grew up as a Catholic in a modest family during the Cristero War, a time in which the Church was being persecuted and many were killed or assassinated in Mexico by the anti-Catholic ruling government.\n\nAt the age of fifteen, Ruiz completed high school and seminary at León in Guanajuato. He continued his studies at the Jesuit Gregorian University in Rome where he focused on Sacred Scripture, earning his doctorate in 1952. In 1949 he was ordained to the priesthood.\n\nAfter receiving his doctorate in philosophy and theology from Gregorian University, Ruiz returned to Guanajuato where he taught at the León seminary. In 1960, Ruiz was consecrated bishop of the Diocese of San Cristóbal de las Casas of Chiapas Mexico, where he remained until he retired in 2000. San Cristóbal de las Cases is made up mostly of the highlands of Chiapas, comprising largely poor, indigenous communities who speak a variety of Mayan languages.\n\nIn his early years as bishop, Ruiz subscribed to traditional views of the Church and evangelization. Ruiz's first pastoral letter acknowledged the dangers of communism developing in Mexico, reading \"Behind a creed that flaunts a banner of social justice, communism has been sneaking in falsehoods, hypocrisy, deceit, and calumny.” Earlier methods of evangelization within the diocese were largely top-down practices that focused on Western methods of social change. Often catechists communicated messages of passivity to the indigenous communities rather than fostering consciousness-raising, which was consistent with government policy at the time, often in the name of \"development\" and “civilizing” the Indians.\n\nNot long after arriving in San Cristóbal, Ruiz set out on a mule to tour his diocese, visiting every town and village over which he held jurisdiction. During his travels, he discovered the incredible poverty and marginalization that communities in his diocese were inflicted with, realizing what the true reality was for many indigenous communities in Chiapas. His 1993 pastoral letter reflects this experience, in which Ruiz comments on the past actions taken by him and his diocese, admitting that they were culturally destructive and explaining that \"We only had our own ethnocentric criteria to judge customs. Without realizing it, we were on the side of those who oppressed the indigenous\". Ruiz began to slowly identify and challenge the structures of oppression, questioning the structure of the government and military, as well as figures within the church who were furthering these systems. He encouraged indigenous communities to take charge of their own lives, and openly voiced that the poor of Chiapas were victims of structural oppression and institutionalized violence. Gradually, Ruiz underwent a series of conversion experiences, leading him to take up the cause of the Mayan indigenous population in his diocese and to develop an inculturated approach to indigenous Catholicism and evangelization.\n\nRuiz \"learned to speak four Mayan languages.\"\n\nIn 1962, the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965) convened, focusing on the social responsibility of Christians and on opening the Church to theological development and dialogue. Vatican II encouraged that sermons be translated and read to communities in their local languages and that the Church be more involved in addressing social problems, such as those occurring in Central and South America. For Ruiz, his participation in the Second Vatican Council allowed time for reflection on the decisions and actions carried out under his administration, which brought him a long way from the somewhat naïve enthusiasm which he'd had during his first years as bishop. It was Vatican II which inspired Ruiz to translate scripture into local indigenous languages and into practice, with an emphasis on inculturation.\n\nIn 1967, Bishop Ruiz became the president of the Mexican Bishop's Committee on Indigenous Peoples (CEPI), and in 1968 he was named the president of the Department of Missions of The Conference of Latin American Bishops (CELAM), also called the Medellín Conference. This was a position which he held until 1972 when elections for secretary general chose Archbishop Alfonso López Trujillo, who proceeded to replace progressive department heads, such as Ruiz, with his own conservative allies. Out of this conference, held in Medellín, Colombia, in 1968, emerged a consensus that the root of poverty and oppression in Latin America was a systemic problem, one which grew out of the ethic of expansion and development by United States imperialism. Ruiz fond some convergence between the bishops' growing concern for the poor and disenfranchised and Marxist approaches to class analysis, which emphasized that the great conflict between \"capital\" and “labor” had its origins in the exploitation of workers by \"the entrepreneurs following the principle of maximum profit,\" Such analysis also found support in dependency theory, the idea that the economies of certain countries are conditioned by the development or expansion of another economy to which the former is subjected. Many in the Catholic Church condemned these ideas as communism, claiming that they undermined the Church's mission and reduced the Gospel to a purely earthly one. The United States and Latin American governments also responded with threatening hostility. The United States supported Latin American militaries in their methods of assassinating those who subscribed to liberation theology and conducting low-intensity warfare against guerrilla groups.\n\nThe diocese of San Cristóbal de las Casas (Chiapas), under Samuel Ruiz's direction, began to redefine evangelization methods and to abandon the traditional approach of Europeanizing indigenous peoples, instead incarnating the gospel in the local culture of each community. Catechists no longer delivered the Word of God to the communities with which they worked, but incorporated the Gospel within the cultural traditions and day-to-day lives of the indigenous. This meant committing themselves to learning the culture and languages of Chiapas, organizing services and discussions in indigenous languages, and inculturating local customs that could be integrated into the Word of God. By doing so, and by translating the Bible into indigenous languages, this work allowed for the poor of San Cristóbal to begin identifying parallels between their own experiences of oppression with those in Biblical passages, most notably the Exodus. Rather than focusing only on the religious affairs that they had once been restricted to, catechists began fostering discussion of economic and political matters that impacted people's daily lives. Passivity was replaced by these new methods of catechists, and through the development of base communities, which built the framework for reflection and collective action. Indigenous poor no longer accepted the \"low wages they earned on plantations, the lack of security in their land titles, the corruption of government agencies, and the abuses of merchants and landowners\", instead using \"their religious faith and interpretation of the Bible to create concrete solutions to immediate problems\".\nIn 1989, Bishop Ruiz founded the Fray Bartolomé de Las Casas Rights Center to push back against increasing violence against indigenous and campesino activists in his diocese.\n\nThis theology of liberation, however, appeared threatening to government structures and those with political and economic power, and in some cases oppression of rural and urban poor in Mexico and other areas of Latin America grew worse. Areas which practiced these new ways of interpreting the Bible and encouraged the poor to fight for their human rights were labeled Marxists and, often under government orders, para-militaries conducted counter-insurgent campaigns using low-intensity warfare to target civilians who supported these resistance movements. The indigenous started to realize that the cause of their poverty was their lack of freedom and democracy, a repression that grew out of the policies of the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) government.\n\nOn 1 January 1994, the date that NAFTA came into effect, a group of several hundred indigenous guerrillas occupied several transit routes and government offices in San Cristóbal de las Casas and other cities in the highlands. These occupations, a response to increased marginalization of Indians at the hands of their government, were carried out under the name of the previously unheard of Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN), a name inspired by Emiliano Zapata, a leading figure during the Mexican Revolution who stood as a powerful symbol of the equity and social justice that the men and women of Mexico's rural south demanded of their government. The Mexican government, who for years had silenced protests in Chiapas in order to create the political and economic conditions needed to ensure its admission into NAFTA, was outraged and blamed Ruiz's pastoral practices and consciousness-raising techniques as one of the roots of the Zapatista Uprising. The PRI, which had monopolized power for nearly 70 years, attempted to respond to the uprisings with military pressure – implementing strategies of low-intensity warfare to terrorize the civilian population that supported the Zapatistas.\n\nReflecting on these events, Bishop Ruiz later explained that \"It became clear that the diocese could not be absent from the situation. Our job was neither to represent the Zapatistas to the government nor to represent the government to the Zapatistas, but rather to offer a mediation in which there could be mutual confidence in talks\". The Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) attracted national and international attention as negotiations with government authorities were underway, for which Ruiz was elected mediator and during which the guerrillas demanded not only constitutional recognition, but reformation of the state and systemic structures which were the root of their oppression.\n\nOnce Subcomandante Marcos was identified as Rafael Guillén, on 9 February 1995, in a counterproductive turn of events, President Ernesto Zedillo made a series of decisions that completely broke with the strategy and action plan previously defined and the agreements he authorized his Secretary of Interior Lic Esteban Moctezuma to compromise with Marcos just 3 days before in Guadalupe Tepeyac. Zedillo sent the Mexican army to capture or annihilate Marcos without consulting his Secretary of Interior, without knowing exactly who Marcos was, and only with the PGR single presumption that Marcos was a dangerous guerrilla. Despite these circumstances, President Ernesto Zedillo decided to launch a military offensive to capture or annihilate Marcos. Arrest warrants were issued against Marcos, Javier Elorriaga Berdegue, Silvia Fernández Hernández, Jorge Santiago, Fernando Yanez, German Vicente, Jorge Santiago and other Zapatistas. At the Lacandon Jungle, the Zapatista Army of National Liberation was then under the Mexican Army military siege. The PGR was after them. Javier Elorriaga got captured on 9 February 1995, in a military garrison at Gabina Velázquez that is in Las Margaritas, Chiapas, town and later taken to the Cerro Hueco prison in Tuxtla Gutiérrez, Chiapas.\nOn 11 February 1995, the PGR reported that they made an operation in the State of Mexico, where they captured 14 persons presumed to be involved with the Zapatistas, of which 8 had already been turned in to the Judicial Authorities, and they'd seized an important arsenal. The PGR repressive acts got to the extreme of arresting the San Cristóbal de Las Casas, Chiapas, Catholic Bishop, Samuel Ruiz García, for aiding to conceal the Zapatistas guerrilla activity. Yet, this activity was public years before the uprising, reported in \"Proceso\" (magazine), among Mexico's most important magazines, and it was the Mexican Government who was for years trying to disguise it. There was also no consideration of the political consequences of, with no legal reason, hurting the already seriously damaged, recently restored Mexico Vatican Diplomatic relations. hurt by the 24 May 1993, political assassination of a Prince of the Catholic Church, the Guadalajara, Mexico Cardinal Juan Jesús Posadas Ocampo, that precisely that Agency, the PGR, had left it unresolved..\n\nMarcos' resolve was put to the test when the Zapatista Army of National Liberation was under the Mexican Army military siege, in their camp and at the Lacandon Jungle. Marcos' response was immediate, sending Esteban Moctezuma the following message: \"See you in hell\". Conflicting signals got strengthened in favor of a fast military solution. The facts seemed to confirm Manuel Camacho Solis' 16 June 1994, accusations that the reason for his resignation as the Chiapas Peace Commissioner was due to sabotage done by the then presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo.\n\nUnder heavy political pressure of a highly radicalized situation, Mexico Secretary of the Interior Lic. Esteban Moctezuma believed a peaceful solution was possible. He championed to reach a peacefully negotiated solution to the 1995 Zapatista Crisis betting it all on a creative strategy to reestablish the Mexican Government Zapatista Army of National Liberation dialog to search for peace by demonstrating Marcos' natural peace vocation and the terrible consequences of a military solution. Making a strong position against the 9 February actions against peace, Secretary of the Interior Esteban Moctezuma, defender of a political solution to the 1995 Zapatista Crisis, submitted his resignation to President Ernesto Zedillo, who does not accept it but asks the Secretary of the Interior Esteban Moctezuma to try the improbable task of restoring the conditions for dialog and negotiation. For these foregoing reasons the Mexican army eased actions, giving an opportunity that Marcos capitalized on to escape the military site in the Lacandon Jungle. Faced with this situation, Max Appedole and Rafael Guillén, childhood friends and colleagues at the Jesuits College Instituto Cultural Tampico, asked for help from Edén Pastora, the legendary Nicaraguan \"Commander Zero\", to prepare a report for under-Secretary of the Interior Luis Maldonado Venegas, the Secretary of the Interior Esteban Moctezuma, and the President Ernesto Zedillo about Marcos' natural pacifist vocation and the terrible consequences of a tragic outcome. The document concluded that the marginalized groups and the radical left that exist in México have been activated with the Zapatistas movement, while Marcos maintains an open negotiating track. Eliminate Marcos and his social containment work will cease, giving opportunity to the radical groups to take control of the movement. They will respond to violence with violence. They would begin terrorist bombings, kidnappings, and belligerent activities. The country would be in a dangerous spiral, which could lead to very serious situations because there is discomfort not only in Chiapas but in many places in Mexico.\n\nDuring the investigative stage to identify Subcomandante Marcos, the Mexican government speculated that he was a dangerous guerrilla fighter. This theory gained much traction at the end of 1994, after the dissident Zapatista Comandante Salvador Morales Garibay gave away the identity of his former fellow Zapatistas to the Mexican government, among them Marcos identity. They all were indicted for terrorism, warrants were issued, and arrests were made in a military action. The Mexican government alleged some Zapatistas to be terrorists, among them Marcos. There was a storm of political pressure for a fast military solution to the 1995 Zapatista Crisis. On 9 February 1995, in a televised special Presidential broadcast, President Ernesto Zedillo announced Subcomandante Marcos to be one Rafael Sebastián Guillén Vicente, born 19 June 1957, in Tampico, Tamaulipas, to Spanish immigrants, a former professor at Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana School of Sciences and Arts for the Design. After the government revealed Marcos identity in January 1995, as Rafael Guillén, an old friend and classmate with the Jesuits at the Instituto Cultural Tampico, directly intervened in the conflict: Max Appedole played a major role with the Mexican government to avoid a military solution to the 1995 Zapatista Crisis. He demonstrated that contrary to the accusations announced by President Ernesto Zedillo, Rafael Guillén was no terrorist. Max Appedole recognized his literary style in all Marcos' manifestos that were published in the media, and linked them to their forensic debates organized by the Jesuits in which they competed in Mexico. He confirmed that he had no doubt that Marcos was his friend Rafael Guillén, a pacifist.\n\nNational and international support of the Zapatistas' demands increased and in 1996 the San Andrés Accords were signed by the EZLN and the federal government. This committed the parties to basic respect for the diversity of the indigenous population of Chiapas, granted the right to participation in determining their development plans, control over administrative and judicial affairs, and self-government. However, the proposal for the implementation of these conditions was accepted by EZLN, but refused by President Zedillo. Time showed that the effort against a military solution to the conflict and for the strategy to achieve a peaceful solution to the 1995 Zapatista Crisis was legal, politically and honorably correct, and saved many lives in Mexico.\n\nIn 1998, Bishop Samuel Ruiz resigned from his position as peace mediator, accusing the government of “simulating” a peace process, and the committee disbanded. Ruiz continued to act as a protector and supporter of Chiapas and to advocate for human rights for the indigenous until his death in 2011. Following his resignation, he was succeeded by Bishop Felipe Arizmendi Esquivel, a socially progressive supporter.\n\nOn 24 January 2011, at the age of 86, Samuel Ruiz García died at Hospital Ángeles del Pedregal in Mexico City, due to respiratory failure and other complications, including high blood pressure and diabetes. During the Mass in Mexico City which commemorated Don Samuel, other bishops described Ruiz as \"a person whose actions were discussed and condemned by a section of society, but for the poor and for those who worked with him, Don Samuel was a bright light\".\n\nIn 1996, Samuel Ruiz received the Pacem in Terris Peace and Freedom Award for his fight against injustice and institutionalized violence inflicted on the poor and oppressed of his diocese of San Cristóbal de las Casas.\n\nIn 1997, Ruiz received the Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders.\n\nSamuel Ruiz was awarded the Simon Bolivar International Prize by UNESCO in 2000 for his work to defend the indigenous peoples of Chiapas, for his role as mediator between the government and the Zapatista Army of National Liberation, and for his commitment to the promotion of human rights and social justice for Latin America peoples.\n\nSamuel Ruiz was also nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1994, 1995, and 1996 by, among others, Rigoberta Menchú and Adolfo Pérez Esquivel.\n\n"}

He was a member of Adolf Hitler's entourage and brother-in-law to Eva Braun through his marriage to her sister Gretl.\n\nFegelein joined a cavalry regiment of the Reichswehr in 1925 and transferred to the SS on 10 April 1933. He became a leader of an SS equestrian group, and was in charge of preparation for the equestrian events of the Berlin Olympic Games in 1936. He tried out for the Olympic equestrian team himself but was eliminated in the qualifying rounds.\n\nIn September 1939, after the Invasion of Poland, Fegelein commanded the SS \"Totenkopf Reiterstandarte\" (Death's-Head Horse Regiment). They were garrisoned in Warsaw until December. In May and June 1940, he participated in the Battle of Belgium and France as a member of the \"SS-Verfügungstruppe\" (later renamed the \"Waffen-SS\"). For his service in these campaigns he was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class on 15 December 1940. Units under his command on the Eastern Front in 1941 were responsible for the deaths of over 17,000 civilians during the Pripyat swamps punitive operation in the Byelorussian SSR. As commander of the 8th SS Cavalry Division \"Florian Geyer\" in 1943, he was involved in operations against partisans as well as defensive operations against the Red Army, for which he was awarded the Close Combat Clasp in bronze.\n\nAfter being seriously wounded in September 1943, Fegelein was reassigned by Heinrich Himmler to Hitler's headquarters staff as his liaison officer and representative of the SS. Fegelein was present at the failed attempt on Hitler's life on 20 July 1944. He was on duty at Hitler's \"Führerbunker\" in Berlin in the closing months of the war, and was shot for desertion on 28 April 1945, two days before Hitler's suicide. Fegelein was an opportunist who ingratiated himself with Himmler, who granted him the best assignments and rapid promotions. Journalist William L. Shirer and historian Sir Ian Kershaw characterise him as cynical and disreputable. Albert Speer called him \"one of the most disgusting people in Hitler's circle\".\n\nFegelein was born in Ansbach, Bavaria, to the retired \"Oberleutnant\" Hans Fegelein. As a boy working at his father's equestrian school in Munich, he became a proficient rider and participated in jumping events. During this period he met Christian Weber, an original member of the Nazi Party. Weber later sponsored Fegelein's entry into the \"Schutzstaffel\" (SS).\n\nIn 1925, after studying for two terms at Munich University, Fegelein joined the \"Reiter-Regiment\" 17 (Cavalry Regiment 17). On 20 April 1927, he joined the Bavarian State Police in Munich as an officer cadet. In 1929 he left the police service when he was caught stealing examination solutions from a teaching superior's office. The official communication at the time was that he resigned for \"family reasons\". Fegelein later stated that he had left the police on \"his own account\" to better serve the Nazi Party and SS. His father had started the \"Reitinstitut Fegelein\" (Riding Institute Fegelein) in 1926. In Munich, Fegelein came into contact with National Socialism and the SS. His father had made the institute available to the SS as a meeting place, and the training facilities and horses were used by equestrian units of the \"Sturmabteilung\" (SA) and SS.\n\nFegelein joined the Nazi Party (membership number 1,200,158) and the SA in 1930. He transferred to the SS on 10 April 1933, with membership number 66,680. He worked as an instructor at the \"Reitinstitut Fegelein\" and became the leader of the \"SS-Reitersturm\", the SS equestrian group based at the facility. By the mid-1930s he took over administration of the school from his father. He was promoted to the \"Allgemeine-SS\" rank of \"SS-Untersturmführer\" that year and to \"SS-Obersturmführer\" on 20 April 1934 and to \"SS-Hauptsturmführer\" on 9 November 1934. Beginning in November 1935, Fegelein oversaw the preparation of the courses and facilities for the equestrian events of the Berlin Olympic Games. He was promoted to the rank of \"SS-Sturmbannführer\" on 30 January 1936. He tried out for the German equestrian team, but was unable to prevail against the strong competition from the (cavalry school Hanover), who went on to win all the equestrian gold medals.\n\nFegelein won the \"\" international tournament in 1937, as did his brother Waldemar, in 1939. He was promoted to the rank of \"SS-Obersturmbannführer\" on 30 January. On 25 July 1937, \"Reichsführer-SS\" Himmler, by special order of the \"SS-Oberabschnitt Süd\", created the \"Haupt-Reitschule München\" (SS Main Riding School) in Munich. The school was started from his father's stud farm. Fegelein was named its commander and promoted to \"SS-Standartenführer\" the same day. Funding for the very expensive horses came in part from then \"SS-Brigadeführer\" Weber, who supported the school with more than 100,000 Reichsmarks annually. Fegelein won the \"\"\"\" (Brown Ribbon of Germany), an annual horse race which in 1938 was held on the premises of the riding school in Munich. Fegelein at the time had strong ambitions to participate in the 1940 Summer Olympics. With the help of his friend (HSSPF; Higher SS and Police Leader) Karl von Eberstein, he arranged the transfer of all the Bavarian State Police horses to the SS riding school in case of mobilization. His fear was that the horses would be handed to the Wehrmacht.\n\nIn September 1939, Fegelein commanded the SS \"Totenkopf Reiterstandarte\" (Death's-Head Horse Regiment), which arrived in Poland shortly after the end of the Polish Campaign. The unit was placed under the command of the \"Ordnungspolizei\" (Orpo; order police) and was split into small groups assigned to support police activities at posts throughout the Poznan district. On 15 November, Himmler ordered the expansion of the regiment from four to thirteen squadrons and renamed it as \"1. SS-Totenkopf-Reiterstandarte\" (1st Death's Head Cavalry Regiment). Additional men were recruited from ethnic Germans living in the General Government and further afield. As many of the officers, including Fegelein, had never attended officer training school, much of the training provided to new recruits was rudimentary. However, it was rigorous, and the men developed a strong camaraderie. Fegelein's unit was involved alongside the Orpo in the extermination, ordered by Hitler, of members of the Polish elite such as intellectuals, aristocrats, and clergy, in an action called \"Intelligenzaktion\". On 7 December 1939, Fegelein's unit was involved in the mass shooting of 1,700 such people in the Kampinos Forest.\n\nOn 15 December, the unit was split into two \"Standarten\" (regiments), with Fegelein commanding the \"1. Standarte\" under the overall command of \"Höherer SS- und Polizeiführer-Ost\" Friedrich-Wilhelm Krüger. The unit was short of basic supplies such as weapons, food, and uniforms, which led to deteriorating morale and ill health. Incidents of corruption and theft took place, particularly among members of the regimental staff in Warsaw. On 23 April 1941, Fegelein faced court-martial charges for an incident in 1940 where he and his unit had been caught stealing money and luxury goods for transportation back to Germany. Fegelein's court-martial was quashed by direct order of Himmler. The allegations brought forward against Fegelein had included \"murder motivated by greed\". Apparently he had ordered arrests and executions in the Gestapo prison in Warsaw. In addition to this, Fegelein was charged with having had an unlawful sexual relationship with a Polish woman. The woman had become pregnant and Fegelein forced her to have an abortion. Reinhard Heydrich tried several times to investigate the accusations against Fegelein, but each time Himmler quashed the attempt.\n\nFegelein's unit took part in anti-partisan fighting against a group of about 100 former Polish soldiers in the area of Kammienna–Konsky–Kielce in March and April 1940. They killed about half the partisans and the remainder escaped. On 8 April, Fegelein's unit killed 250 Polish men in villages in the area. While in his report he described the behaviour of his troops as \"clean and decent\", there were many incidents in this period where his men behaved in an undisciplined way, killing and robbing civilians without being ordered to do so.\n\nIn May and June 1940, Fegelein, who had been promoted to \"SS-Obersturmbannführer\" of the Reserves in the \"Waffen-SS\" on 1 March 1940, participated in the Battle of Belgium and France as a member of the \"SS-Verfügungstruppe\". For his service in these campaigns, he was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class on 15 December 1940. In March 1941, the SS \"Totenkopf Reiterstandarte\" 1 was renamed to 1st SS Cavalry Regiment.\n\nWith the start of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, which began on 22 June 1941, Fegelein saw active service on the Eastern Front. His unit was assigned on the 87th Infantry Division on 23 June to cover a gap in the lines of the 9th Army near Białystok. The motorized elements of the 1st SS Cavalry reached the right flank of the operational area on 24 June, but the mounted elements were unable to keep up. The exhausted horses had to be left behind and the men transported to the combat zone in lorries, while the horse-drawn artillery pieces were towed using any available vehicles. The first units to arrive crossed the Narew near Wizna and engaged the Soviets but were unable to break through. They were ordered to retreat and move further north. Infantry elements of the 87th Division captured Osowiec Fortress on 26 June, and Fegelein's cavalry was sent on a reconnaissance mission to the south-east. Himmler, unwilling to have his SS units under Wehrmacht control or used in combat other than as reserves, withdrew the SS cavalry from control of the 87th Division on 27 June. The ambitious Fegelein stressed in his reports that he believed his unit was combat ready and exaggerated its contribution to the operation. Ten of his men received the Iron Cross, Second Class for their efforts, and Fegelein was awarded the Iron Cross, First Class.\n\nThe engagement demonstrated the shortcomings of the cavalry units in modern mobile warfare, which requires quick redeployments in ever-changing conditions. Fegelein sought to improve this by asking Himmler to combine the 1st and 2nd SS cavalry regiments into a brigade, with additional support units. As a temporary measure, Himmler assigned Fegelein to be in charge of both regiments. Fegelein's unit was one of several that undertook field training and political indoctrination in the coming weeks. Himmler addressed the 1st Cavalry on 5 July, offering the opportunity for any men unwilling to participate in the upcoming \"special tasks\" to transfer to another unit. Nobody took advantage of this offer, at least partly because Himmler did not say that the upcoming assignment included the mass shooting of unarmed civilians.\n\nOn 19 July 1941, Himmler assigned Fegelein's regiments to the general command of HSSPF Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski for the \"systematic combing\" of the Pripyat swamps, an operation designed to round up and exterminate Jews, partisans and civilians in that area of Byelorussian SSR. Himmler's orders for the operation were passed to Fegelein via \"SS-Brigadefuhrer\" , who met with him and Bach-Zelewski on 28 July in their new quarters at Liakhovichi in Byelorussia. General instructions were given to \"cleanse\" the area of partisans and Jewish collaborators. Jewish women and children were to be driven away. Fegelein interpreted these orders as follows: Enemy soldiers in uniform were to be taken prisoner, and those found out of uniform were to be shot. Jewish males, with the exception of a few skilled workers such as doctors and leather workers, would be shot. Fegelein split the territory to be covered into two sections divided by the Pripyat River, with the 1st Regiment taking the northern half and the 2nd Regiment the south. The regiments worked their way from east to west through their assigned territory, and filed daily reports on the number of people killed and taken prisoner. In a meeting with Bach-Zelewski on 31 July, Himmler announced the amalgamation of the two regiments into the SS Cavalry Brigade. Additional units such as a bicycle reconnaissance detachment were formed and added to the brigade's complement. On 5 August Himmler assigned leadership of the brigade to Fegelein.\n\nHimmler notified Fegelein by telegram on 1 August that the numbers killed were far too low. A few days later, Himmler issued regimental order no. 42, which called for all male Jews over the age of 14 to be killed. The women and children were to be driven into the swamps and drowned. Thus Fegelein's units were among the first in the Holocaust to wipe out entire Jewish communities. As the water in the swamps was too shallow and some areas had no swamps, it proved impractical to drown the women and children, so they were shot. Fegelein's final report on the operation, dated 18 September 1941, states that they killed 14,178 Jews, 1,001 partisans, 699 Red Army soldiers, with 830 prisoners taken and losses of 17 dead, 36 wounded, and 3 missing. The historian Henning Pieper estimates the actual number of Jews killed was closer to 23,700.\n\nFegelein received the Infantry Assault Badge on 2 October. Four days later, he was again brought before a court for of captured goods. Again the prosecution was halted by Himmler. In mid-October 1941, the brigade left Byelorussia and moved first to Toropets and then on to Rogachev by train, where they were subordinated to Army Group Centre. The new operational area had more partisan activity than the Pripyat swamps, with guerrillas who were well organised and difficult to find. Fegelein's report for the period between 18 October and 18 November 1941 shows 3,018 partisans and Red Army soldiers killed and 122 taken prisoner. However, as fewer than 200 weapons were captured, historians Martin Cüppers and Henning Pieper conclude that the majority of those killed must have been unarmed civilians. Brigade losses were seven dead and nine wounded.\n\nArmy Group Centre renewed their offensive on Moscow in mid-November. Fegelein and the SS Cavalry Brigade were held back as an operational reserve in the rearward area of the 9th Army. Massive counter-attacks by the Red Army led to a weakening of the entire German line, and the brigade was called in to fight at the front on 28 December. While Fegelein reported that his forces were the equivalent to one or two divisions, in reality he had only 4,428 men in total at this point, of which 1,800 were ready for action. The brigade was deployed at the south-eastern sector of the XXIII Army Corps, where it defended against attacks in the rearward area of the 206th Infantry Division in the Battles of Rzhev. The SS Cavalry Brigade took serious losses, with casualties of up to 60 per cent in some squadrons.\n\nOn 1 February 1942, Fegelein was promoted to \"SS-Standartenführer\" in the \"Waffen-SS\" and transferred from the reserve force to active service. Four days later, on 5 February, Fegelein on his own initiative led an attack on a strong enemy group northwest of Chertolino. The attack, carried out in difficult weather conditions, secured an important road junction and the railway station at Chertolino. In a nocturnal attack on 9 February, the brigade encircled and destroyed enemy forces at Chertolino, killing 1,800 Red Army soldiers. Yershovo was captured on 14 February, leading to the annihilation of the enemy units in Rzhevsky District. For his leadership in these battles, Fegelein was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 2 March 1942. Fegelein was then granted home leave and was appointed Inspector of Cavalry and Transportation () in the \"SS-Führungshauptamt\" on 1 May 1942. In this position he was awarded the Eastern Front Medal and the War Merit Cross 2nd Class with Swords, both on 1 September 1942. The SS Cavalry Brigade was disbanded in March 1942 and the remaining men and equipment were formed into a battalion-strength unit called \"Kampfgruppe Zehender\", commanded by \"SS-Sturmbannführer\" August Zehender.\n\nFegelein returned to the front line on 1 December 1942 and on the same day promoted to \"SS-Oberführer\". He was given command of \"Kampfgruppe\" \"Fegelein\", based in the great bend of the Don. He was wounded in action by Soviet snipers on 21 December and 22 December 1942.\n\nOn 20 April 1943, he was appointed commander of the 8th SS Cavalry Division Florian Geyer. Fegelein and his division were involved in operations against partisans in May to July 1943, which included Operation Weichsel, Operation Zeithen, and Operation Seydlitz. On 17 May, they annihilated a partisan group south west of Novoselki. He personally blew up a bunker in the attack. A week later, on 24 May, the division attacked another partisan strongpoint, and no prisoners were taken. During \"Weichsel\" (27 May – 10 June 1943) he reported the unit had killed 4,018 persons and deported 18,860, confiscated 21,000 cattle, and destroyed 61 villages southwest of Gomel. During \"Zeithen\" (13–16 June 1943) they destroyed a further 63 villages and (under direct orders from Hitler) killed all suspected partisans. During \"Seydlitz\" (26 June – 27 July 1943) he reported the destruction of 96 additional villages, with 5,016 killed and 9,166 deported and 19,941 cattle confiscated.\n\nThe division was then deployed in defensive operations against massed Soviet attacks. From 26 August to 15 September, the division repulsed five attacks of divisional strength and a further 85 attacks of battalion strength. The heaviest combat occurred on 26 August near Bespalovka and on 28 August, when the division halted a Soviet breakthrough at Bol'shaya Gomol'sha. Fegelein led a counterattack on 8 September, recapturing the height 199,0 at Verkhniy Bishkin. On 11 September 1943, during these defensive battles, he was awarded the Close Combat Clasp in bronze. Fegelein was severely wounded on 30 September 1943 and was hospitalised for a few weeks. He received the German Cross in gold on 1 November 1943. Following his convalescence he was appointed chief of \"Amt\" VI—Office for Rider and Driver Training—in the \"SS-Führungshauptamt\" on 1 January 1944.\n\nAt the same time, Himmler assigned him to Hitler's headquarters staff as his liaison officer and representative of the SS. He was promoted to the rank of \"SS-Gruppenführer und Generalleutnant der Waffen-SS\" on 10 June 1944. On 20 July 1944, Fegelein was present at the failed attempt on Hitler's life at the Wolf's Lair headquarters in Rastenburg, East Prussia and received a minor wound to his left thigh from the bomb blast. Fegelein often showed around the photographs of the hanged men who had been executed as a result of this failed assassination attempt.\n\nFegelein's politically motivated marriage to Gretl Braun, Eva Braun's sister, took place on 3 June 1944 in Salzburg. Historians Kershaw and Shirer believe he courted Braun as a way to advance his career. Hitler, Himmler, and Martin Bormann acted as witnesses at the ceremony. A two-day celebration was then held at Hitler's and Bormann's Obersalzberg mountain homes and the Eagle's Nest. Fegelein was a known playboy and had many extramarital affairs. Hitler's secretaries, Christa Schroeder and Traudl Junge, state Fegelein was popular socially, particularly with women. He could be funny, amusing, and charming. Eva was glad to have someone in the entourage with whom she could dance and flirt, as Hitler was distant in social situations and refrained from publicly showing affection. Fegelein worked hard to develop a friendship with Hitler's powerful private secretary, Martin Bormann. Fegelein consistently attended Bormann's drinking parties and told Junge that the only things that mattered were \"his career and a life full of fun.\"\n\nBy early 1945, Germany's military situation was on the verge of total collapse. Hitler, presiding over a rapidly disintegrating Third Reich, retreated to his \"Führerbunker\" in Berlin on 16 January 1945. To the Nazi leadership, it was clear that the battle for Berlin would be the final battle of the war. Berlin was bombarded by Soviet artillery for the first time on 20 April 1945 (Hitler's birthday). By the evening of 21 April, Red Army tanks reached the outskirts of the city. By 27 April, Berlin was cut off from the rest of Germany.\n\nOn 27 April 1945, \"Reichssicherheitsdienst\" (RSD) deputy commander \"SS-Obersturmbannführer\" Peter Högl was sent out from the Reich Chancellery to find Fegelein, who had abandoned his post at the \"Führerbunker\" after deciding he did not want to \"join a suicide pact\". Fegelein was located by the RSD squad in his Berlin apartment, wearing civilian clothes and preparing to flee to Sweden or Switzerland. He was carrying cash—German and foreign—and jewellery, some of which belonged to Braun. Högl found a briefcase containing documents with evidence of Himmler's attempted peace negotiations with the Western Allies. According to most accounts, Fegelein was intoxicated when arrested and taken back to the \"Führerbunker\". He was kept in a makeshift cell until the evening of 28 April. That night, Hitler was informed of the BBC broadcast of a Reuters news report about Himmler's attempted negotiations with the western Allies via Count Bernadotte. Hitler flew into a rage about this apparent betrayal and ordered Himmler's arrest. Sensing a connection between Fegelein's disappearance and Himmler's betrayal, Hitler ordered \"SS-Gruppenführer\" Heinrich Müller to interrogate Fegelein as to what he knew of Himmler's plans. Thereafter, according to Otto Günsche (Hitler's personal adjutant), Hitler ordered that Fegelein be stripped of all rank and to be transferred to \"Kampfgruppe\" \"Mohnke\" to prove his loyalty in combat. Günsche and Bormann expressed their concern to Hitler that Fegelein would only desert again. Hitler then ordered Fegelein court-martialed.\n\nJournalist James P. O'Donnell, who conducted extensive interviews in the 1970s, provides one account of what happened next. \"SS-Brigadeführer\" Wilhelm Mohnke, who presided over the court martial for desertion, told O'Donnell that Hitler ordered him to set up a tribunal. Mohnke arranged for a court martial panel, which consisted of generals Wilhelm Burgdorf, Hans Krebs, \"SS-Gruppenführer\" Johann Rattenhuber, and himself. Fegelein, still drunk, refused to accept that he had to answer to Hitler, and stated that he was responsible only to Himmler. Fegelein was so drunk that he was crying and vomiting; he was unable to stand up, and even urinated on the floor. Mohnke was in a quandary, as German military and civilian law both require a defendant to be of sound mind and to understand the charges against them. Although Mohnke was certain Fegelein was \"guilty of flagrant desertion\", it was the opinion of the judges that he was in no condition to stand trial, so Mohnke closed the proceedings and turned the defendant over to General Rattenhuber's security squad. Mohnke never saw Fegelein again.\n\nAn alternative scenario of Fegelein's death is based on the 1948/49 Soviet NKVD dossier of Hitler written for Joseph Stalin. The dossier is based on the interrogation reports of Günsche and Heinz Linge (Hitler's valet). This dossier differs in part from the accounts given by Mohnke and Rattenhuber. After the intoxicated Fegelein was arrested and taken back to the \"Führerbunker\", Hitler at first ordered Fegelein to be transferred to \"Kampfgruppe\" \"Mohnke\" to prove his loyalty in combat. Günsche and Bormann expressed their concern to Hitler that Fegelein would desert again. Hitler then ordered Fegelein to be demoted and court-martialed by a court led by Mohnke. At this point the accounts differ, as the NKVD dossier states that Fegelein was court-martialed on the evening of 28 April, by a court headed by Mohnke, \"SS-Obersturmbannführer\" Alfred Krause, and \"SS-Sturmbannführer\" Herbert Kaschula. Mohnke and his fellow officers sentenced Fegelein to death. That same evening, Fegelein was shot from behind by a member of the \"Sicherheitsdienst\". Based on this stated chain of events, author Veit Scherzer concluded that Fegelein, according to German law, was deprived of all honours and honorary signs and must therefore be considered a \"de facto\" but not \"de jure\" recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross.\n\nFegelein's wife was then in the late stages of pregnancy (the baby was born on 5 May). Hitler considered releasing him without punishment or assigning him to Mohnke's troops. Junge—an eye-witness to bunker events—stated that Braun pleaded with Hitler to spare her brother-in-law and tried to justify Fegelein's actions. Junge said Fegelein was taken to the garden of the Reich Chancellery on 28 April, and was \"shot like a dog\". Rochus Misch, who was the last survivor from the \"Führerbunker\", disputed aspects of this account in a 2007 interview with \"Der Spiegel\". According to Misch, Hitler did not order Fegelein's execution, only his demotion. Misch claimed to know the identity of Fegelein's killer, but refused to reveal his name.\n\nHistorians William L. Shirer and Ian Kershaw characterise Fegelein as cynical and disreputable; Albert Speer called him \"one of the most disgusting people in Hitler's circle\". Fegelein was an opportunist who ingratiated himself with Himmler, who in return granted him the best assignments—mostly related to cavalry—and rapid promotion through the ranks. The historian Henning Pieper, who studied the period up until March 1942, notes Fegelein's lack of formal training as an officer led to deficiencies in the way the SS Cavalry Brigade was prepared for active service. Fegelein repeatedly over-stated the combat readiness of his troops and exaggerated their accomplishments, in Pieper's opinion in order to be seen as a leader worthy of promotion and honours. Fegelein's faulty analysis of his brigade's readiness led to their use in December 1941 through March 1942 in combat situations for which they were unsuitable and untrained; however, as the military situation was deteriorating, they would eventually have received front-line assignments regardless of their readiness. By the end of March 1942, the brigade had suffered casualties of 50 per cent, much higher than army units deployed in the same area.\n\nFegelein's parents and his brother Waldemar survived the war. Gretl, who inherited some of Eva's valuable jewellery, also survived the war. She gave birth to a daughter (named Eva Barbara Fegelein, after her late aunt) on 5 May 1945. Eva Fegelein killed herself on 25 April 1971 after her boyfriend died in a car accident. Gretl Braun-Fegelein moved to Munich and remarried in 1954. She died in 1987, aged 72.\n\n\nThe death sentence on 28 April resulted in the loss of all orders, awards, and honorary signs.\n\nFegelein held various ranks in both the \"Allgemeine-SS\" and \"Waffen-SS\". The following table shows that progression was not synchronous.\n\n\n"}

He was primarily known for his Obake Files, a collection of articles and stories regarding native and imported folktales and mythology in Hawaii. Grant was also the author of the Chicken Skin series of ghost story anthologies, as well as host of the long-running radio show of the same name.\n\nGrant was born and raised in the west Los Angeles area near Palms and Culver City. He was the son of Hollywood special effects wizard Cliff Grant, who worked on such films as \"Gone with the Wind\", \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"Forbidden Planet.\" The elder Grant helped create the extraterrestrial robot Gort from \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" and Robby the Robot from \"Forbidden Planet\". \"Robby eventually became a member of the Grant household, where the younger Grant said he would see the robot, stashed in the family garage, on a daily basis. Though the robot ultimately ended up in a museum, Grant was said to have \"often affectionately remembered Robby the Robot as his brother.\"\n\nGlen graduated from Hamilton High School in 1964. Grant received a bachelor's degree in history from the University of California, Los Angeles, and on an invitation from friend and UH professor Dennis M. Ogawa, took a trip to Hawaii in 1970. He made the move permanent the following year, earning a master's degree in education in 1974 and a doctorate in American studies in 1982, both from the University of Hawaii. He taught history, American studies and political science for more than 30 years in the UH school system and Hawaii Tokai International College, where he was a vice chancellor until the time of his death.\n\nGrant was a popular instructor, known for a theatrical, lively style of teaching, in which he would wear historical costumes, use stage settings and deliver several lectures in character. This was especially so when he covered such subjects as American studies or classes on Japanese-American experiences.\n\nAs Grant's time in Hawaii grew, in addition to studying the cultures and geography of Hawaii and its inhabitants, he began to grow interested in the myths and legends both already present and brought in by other cultures. This, combined with a childhood love of ghost stories, led him to create what he would later call the Obake Files (the word \"obake\" being a Japanese word for \"ghost\" absorbed into Hawaiian Pidgin).\n\nGrant's Obake Files work can be divided into two parts: the scholarly Obake Files, and the entertainment-based \"Chicken Skin\" series.\n\nThe Obake Files (documented in his books \"Obake Files\", \"Secret Obake Casebook\", and \"Obake: Ghost Stories in Hawaii\") drew extensively from his interviews with residents and newspaper clippings of events that had been reported in Hawaii. He noted the correlation between some of these legends to ones from other nations, and theorized that as native Hawaiian stories (such as Nightmarchers) interacted more with spirits and legends (such as the Japanese kappa) brought by immigrants to Hawaii, the stories would blend to form a new kind of ghost story.\n\nUnlike the \"Obake Files\", Grant's sense of the theatrical often led him to weave himself (and sometimes friends and colleagues) into the stories directly. For these stories he called them \"The Chickenskin Files\" (named after \"chicken skin\", the Hawaiian Pidgin term for goose bumps). These books often portrayed Grant as a professor somewhere between his normal self and Indiana Jones, setting out to see the mysteries of Hawaii and other places (Japan was the setting of one story) where legends had been imported to the island.\n\nChicken Skin Tales is a collection of Glen Grant's 49 favorite ghost stories that celebrate the supernatural traditions of Hawai'i. Based upon first-hand encounters with spirits, strange beings, poltergeists, fireballs and other \"things which go bump in the night,\"...Glen Grant has been collecting and telling the 'true supernatural tales' of Hawai'i for over twenty-five years. His Chicken Skin series have been shared in books, tapes, television, radio, and walking tours.\n\n\"A Brief Encounter at the Pali - The Japanese Television company had come to Hawai'i to do a special \"obake season\" program for a popular series based in Tokyo. The summer time is usually a period when ghost stories are very popular in Japan.\"\n\n\"I have been on this earth long enough to know that supernatural entities don't particularly jump out of the bushes at you on a regular basis. I know the difference between urban legend, natural reality and supernatural experience.\"\n\nDue to the popularity of his works, he soon earned a two-hour spot on local radio for his storytelling. Though the show had been named after the latter series, it was tailored mostly after the Obake Files in general, with investigations and interviews with residents and other experts on Hawaiian legends, some discussion of legends abroad and in other parts of the U.S., with the last half-hour of the show dedicated to a \"Chicken Skin\"-style story, usually featuring local voice talent or show staff members in roles.\n\nThough the show was mostly scripted, there were moments of spontaneity. In a 1981 broadcast, Grant dismissed as rumor the May 19, 1959 Honolulu Advertiser report of a mujina seen in Hawaii. In that article, \"Advertiser\" reporter Bob Krauss wrote about a woman's encounter with the Japanese mythical creature at the Waialae Drive-In Theatre in Kahala. A caller immediately phoned him on the air, identifying herself as the witness in the article. She then gave more details on the event, including the previously unreported detail that the mujina in question had red hair. As years passed, on the show Grant himself later reported on a number of other mujina sightings in Hawaii, from ‘Ewa Beach to Hilo.\n\nIn addition to his radio work on Chicken Skin radio, he occasionally reported for National Public Radio as a cultural expert on Hawaiian legends.\n\nIn addition to his Obake Files, Grant wrote numerous other books on Hawaii, its geography and its culture, such as his \"From Skies of Paradise\" series on Oahu and the Big Island; \"Waikiki Yesteryear\", a book on the history of the famed Honolulu district; \"McDougal's Honolulu Mysteries\", a collection of detective stories based in 1930s and 40s-era Oahu, all featuring hard-boiled Honolulu private eye Arthur McDougal; and \"Onipa'a: Five Days in the History of the Hawaiian Nation\", a book on the history of the Kingdom of Hawaii.\n\nHe also co-wrote a biography on Hawaiian-born astronaut Ellison Onizuka.\n\nIn 2000, Grant opened a cafe in the Moiliili district of Honolulu called \"The Haunt\". The cafe, an odd collection of B-Film memorabilia, books on folklore and mythology, and various other items from the occult to comics, was created as a home for \"the creative and offbeat.\" The Haunt would later be expanded with the addition of an upstairs séance room, designed in the idea of 19th century-era American rooms of the kind.\n\nIn addition to the Haunt, Grant and volunteers started the Honolulu Ghost Walks, tours of local places in Hawaii tied into ancient mythology and current folklore. He also started \"Obake Night\" at the local Moiliili Festival, in order to continue the tradition of storytelling with groups.\n\nOn June 19, 2003, he died from cancer. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered at Kaena Point on the far western edge of Oahu. Some have said this to be the ideal resting place for Grant, as Hawaiian mythology places Kaena Point as the bridge between the worlds of the living and the dead.\n\nIn 1979 he won the University of Hawaii (UH) Board of Regents Medal for Teaching Excellence for his work in Asian-American and Hawaiian studies. In 1995 the Honolulu City Council honored him as one of Hawaii's Living Treasures of Multiculturalism.\n"}

He served as Prime Minister of the Netherlands from 9 September 1918 until 4 August 1925 and from 10 August 1929 until 26 May 1933.\n\nCharles Joseph Maria Ruijs de Beerenbrouck was born on 1 December 1873 in Roermond, a town with a Bishop's see in the province of Limburg, in the very south of the Netherlands. Born into an aristocratic family, he grew up in a predominantly Roman Catholic community and went to school in Maastricht and in The Hague. He attended the Utrecht University and in 1895 Ruijs de Beerenbrouck obtained his master's degree in law at the Leiden University.\n\nHe was the son of Gustave Ruijs de Beerenbrouck (1842–1926), Minister of Justice in the Mackay cabinet (founder of the labour and social laws first) and later governor of Limburg (1918).\n\nHe started his career in 1896 as a lawyer in Maastricht. In 1899 Ruijs de Beerenbrouck became a member of the Maastricht municipal council and in 1905 he was elected to the House of Representatives. Ruijs de Beerenbrouck remained a councillor and a member of parliament until 16 May 1918, when he became Queen's Commissioner of the province of Limburg (in the province of Limburg usually called \"Gouverneur\", or Governor).\n\nRuijs de Beerenbrouck did not stay in office as Queen's Commissioner for long, as on 9 September 1918 he was appointed as Prime Minister of the Netherlands.\n\nAs Prime Minister he had to deal with the aftermath of World War I. Although the Netherlands had remained neutral during the conflict, Ruijs de Beerenbrouck nevertheless faced several problems, particularly the return of German troops through the province of Limburg and the exile of the German emperor Wilhelm II.\n\nIn November 1918 the leader of the Social Democratic Workers' Party (SDAP), Pieter Jelles Troelstra, inspired by the Russian Revolution and the German Revolution of 1918–19, called for a socialist revolution among the working class. However, the revolution attempt of Troelstra met with little enthusiasm. Despite this, Ruijs de Beerenbrouck enacted several social reforms in order to satisfy the working class.\n\nFrom 1925 to 1929 Ruijs de Beerenbrouck was Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n\nDuring his third cabinet Ruijs de Beerenbrouck had to deal with the worldwide Great Depression of 1929 and the early 1930s, which had crippling effects on the Dutch economy, effects which lasted longer than they did in most European countries. The depression lead to large unemployment and poverty, as well as increasing social unrest. Ruijs de Beerenbrouck was forced to cut down government expenses and to devaluate the national currency, the Guilder, but these measures only worsened the effects of the economic crisis.\n\nIn February 1933 the third cabinet Ruijs de Beerenbrouck ordered the bombing of the navy cruiser \"De Zeven Provinciën\", when sailors aboard the cruiser, cruising near Sumatra, mutinied because of the cutting of their wages. Twenty three mutineers were killed, resulting in a prolonged controversy and recriminations. \n\nIn 1933 Ruijs de Beerenbrouck again became Speaker of the House of Representatives. He remained in office until his death.\n\nOn 15 April 1902, Ruijs de Beerenbrouck married Maria van der Heyden (19 August 1877 – 17 January 1948). Ruijs de Beerenbrouck died on 17 April 1936 in Utrecht.\n\n\n \n"}

{"id": "1801419", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1801419", "title": "London slang", "text": "London slang\n\nLondon slang is a mixture of words and phrases originating in the city and around the globe, commonly spoken in London. It reflects the diverse ethnic and cultural makeup of the city's population.\n\nAs London occupies a dominant social, cultural and economic position within the United Kingdom, slang originally unique to the city has spread across the UK. Conversely, slang from outside London has migrated in along with people seeking work in the capital. Cockney rhyming slang and Multicultural London English are the best known forms of London slang.\n\nSlang can infiltrate almost any element of daily life. For instance, London slang about money is believed to have been imported from India by returning servicemen during the nineteenth century. The terms \"\", meaning £500, and \"\", meaning £25, are believed by some to have come from old Indian rupee banknotes, which it is asserted used to feature images of those animals. Banknotes with such denominations were issued by Bank of Bengal, Bank of Bombay and Bank of Madras and some other private banks between 1810 and 1860.\n\nIt is more likely that the term Pony originates from the Latin \"Legem Pone\" from Psalm 119 which was always sung at Matins on the 25th of the month. 25 March was also the date on which debts were traditionally settled, on which date one would have to \"pony up\" or \"pony out\". It is easy to see how slang for a payment on the 25th could develop into a payment of 25 pounds\n\nThe term \"monkey\" originally meant a mortgage in working class slang across large parts of the UK. A \"monkey on the house\" or simply a \"monkey\" was a mortgage.\n\nAt that time 500 pounds was a huge sum of money to the poor people who predominantly used such slang and the only way to raise that amount of money would have been to mortgage the house. 500 pounds would have been about the average value of a London house at the time the term originated in the early 20th century according to the CPBS mortgage registers 1919–1922. \n\nHowever the true origin of these terms is uncertain. Another money slang word, \"\", which means £1, is thought to be connected to the American \"\". \"\", which describes an unspecified amount of money, may come from the Romany word for coal, \"wanga\".\n\nIn 2005, Professor Sue Fox from Queen Mary, University of London concluded that Cockney rhyming slang was dying out because children in London are greatly exposed to words and phrases from outside cultures. Teenagers especially are incorporating into their vocabularies new words borrowed from outside the UK. This new slang is also influenced by new technologies, especially mobile phone SMS (short message service) or text messages. While \"dat\" and \"dere\" may be of Afro-Caribbean origin along with many other terms, their use in text messages as easier-to-key options to \"that\" and \"there/their\" cement them as slang in common usage.\n\nThe large number of immigrant communities and high level of cross-ethnic integration mean that various pronunciations, words and phrases have been fused from a variety of sources to create modern London slang. The emerging dialect draws influences from diaspora communities present in London, such as Caribbean speech. This form of slang is mainly spoken in Inner London, and most areas of Outer London. Although the slang has been highly influenced by black Caribbean communities, youth of all ethnicities in London have adopted it.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1801428", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1801428", "title": "Planet of Evil", "text": "Planet of Evil\n\nPlanet of Evil is the second serial of the 13th season of the British science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\". It was first broadcast in four weekly parts on BBC1 from 27 September to 18 October 1975.\n\nThe serial is set on and above the planet Zeta Minor, the last planet in the known universe, more than 30,000 years in the future. In the serial, the Morestran geologist Sorenson (Frederick Jaeger) seeks to exploit the antimatter minerals on the planet to use as a power source for his own planet when he and the military mission looking for him are attacked by a creature from a universe of anti-matter.\n\nThe TARDIS picks up a distress call and the Fourth Doctor and Sarah Jane Smith arrive on the planet Zeta Minor. There they discover that a Morestran geological expedition has fallen prey to an unseen killer and only the leader, Professor Sorenson, remains alive.\nA military mission from Morestra has also arrived to investigate. At first they suspect the Doctor and Sarah Jane of responsibility for the deaths of the expedition members, but the culprit is eventually revealed to be a creature from a universe of antimatter, retaliating for the removal by Sorenson of some antimatter samples from around the pit that acts as an interface between the two universes.\nThe Morestrans take off in their ship, but it is slowly dragged back towards the planet due to the antimatter on board. Sorenson himself becomes infected by antimatter and gradually transforms into an 'antiman', a monster capable of draining the life from others.\nThe Morestran commander, the increasingly unhinged Salamar, attacks Sorenson with a radiation source, but this only causes him to produce multiple anti-matter versions of Sorenson which soon overrun the ship. The Doctor finds the original Sorenson, takes him back to the planet in the TARDIS and throws both him and his samples into the pit, fulfilling a bargain he earlier made with the anti-matter creature. Sorenson reappears unharmed, and the Doctor returns him to the Morestran ship, which is now freed of the planet's influence.\n\nThe Doctor quotes from \"Romeo and Juliet\" and \"Hamlet\", and says that he met William Shakespeare once.\n\nThe plot was deliberately conceived by Philip Hinchcliffe, Robert Holmes and Louis Marks as a mixture of the film \"Forbidden Planet\" and the novella \"The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.\" In addition, Marks had been reading science magazine articles about antimatter, and decided to write a story incorporating the subject. Hinchcliffe, in the first season in which he could commission new material, planned to move away from the \"rubber-suited alien\" theme, which he felt was clichéd. For this story he proposed having three separate monstrous elements: Sorenson's transformation, the anti-matter monster and finally the planet itself, claimed by Sorenson in episode 1 to be conscious of his group's motives.\n\nDespite the jungle setting of this serial, the shoot was entirely studio bound, and designer Roger Murray-Leach built an intricately detailed jungle set. The BBC was so impressed with it that they kept photographs of it for several years as an example of excellent set design and producer Philip Hinchcliffe recommended that he be nominated for an award for this work.\n\nThe original script had Sorenson dying after falling into the pit, but Hinchcliffe ordered that this be changed, as he felt it would too grim an ending for \"the little ones\", and because he saw Sorenson as a victim of the planet's influence rather than an evil man in himself. Instead, a scene was added in which Sorenson is released from the pit and cured of his anti-matter contamination.\n\nThe most visible reference to \"Forbidden Planet\" is the anti-matter monster (Mike Lee Lane), which is sometimes invisible and otherwise is seen as red outlines. It bears a close resemblance to the film's \"Creature from the Id\". The monster is invisible in the filmed sections of the serial (where a wind machine was used to show its progress), and as outlines in the video sections (created with Colour Separation Overlay).\n\nThe ship main cabin set was re-used in the Fourth Doctor story \"The Robots of Death\" (1977).\n\nThis is the final appearance by Michael Wisher in \"Doctor Who\". Prentis Hancock made his third appearance, having previously appeared in \"Spearhead from Space\" (1970) and \"Planet of the Daleks\" (1973). He would later appear in \"The Ribos Operation\" (1978). Frederick Jaeger (Professor Sorenson) and Ewen Solon (Vishinsky) both previously appeared in \"The Savages\" (1966), in which they played Jano and Chal, respectively. Louis Mahoney (Ponti) had previously appeared in \"Frontier in Space\" (1973) and would later appear in \"Blink\" (2007). Graham Western (De Haan) had also previously appeared in Patrick Troughton's final serial \"The War Games\" (1969).\n\nThe story was repeated across four consecutive evenings on BBC1 from 5–8 July 1976, with a start time varying between 6:20 pm and 6:35 pm. It was the first story since \"Spearhead from Space\" to be repeated in its entirety on BBC TV and the first ever to be stripped across consecutive evenings. The viewing figures were 5.0, 5.0, 4.3 & 3.9 million viewers, respectively.\n\nPaul Cornell, Martin Day and Keith Topping wrote of the serial in \"The Discontinuity Guide\" (1995), \"For an eight year old, this was the most terrifying slice of \"Who\". Now it seems a little ordinary, a simple reworking of classic themes. It is unfortunate that the detailed jungle set is in such sharp contrast to the (cheap) minimalism of the Morestran spaceship.\" In \"The Television Companion\" (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker described \"Planet of Evil\" as \"a wonderfully creepy story\" with the borrowing of material from \"Jekyll and Hyde\" \"done with such style and panache that the viewer, far from complaining about a lack of originality, delights in spotting all the familiar sources to which the writer and the production team are paying homage.\" They also noted that the antimatter monster, depicted only as a shimmering red outline, was \"in all but name, the Id monster from the 1956 MGM feature film \"Forbidden Planet\".\" Howe and Walker also praised the jungle set and the performances of Frederick Jaeger and Ewen Solon, but criticised Prentis Hancock's \"poor\" portrayal of Salamar.\n\nRay Dexter's assessment of \"Planet of Evil\" also acknowledged the influence of the 1956 film \"Forbidden Planet\", which inspired the writers to include an invisible, murderous monster, as well as elements of \"Jekyll and Hyde\". Reviewing the serial in 1999, literary critic John Kenneth Muir drew attention to similarities between \"Planet of Evil\" and Ridley Scott's 1979 film, \"Alien\", in particular the scenario of a spaceship answering a distress call, the crew being gradually killed by a malevolent alien life form, and corpses being ejected into space in metal coffins. Muir hesitated to suggest that \"Alien\" was directly influenced by this story, but, nevertheless, considered it significant that \"Doctor Who\" dealt with science fiction themes that became popular later in the 1970s.\n\nIn 2010, Patrick Mulkern of \"Radio Times\" wrote that the serial \"feels original\", particularly praising the jungle set and David Maloney's direction, as well as Tom Baker's performance.\n\nA novelisation of this serial, written by Terrance Dicks, was published by Target Books in July 1977 as \"Doctor Who and the Planet of Evil\".\n\n\"Planet of Evil\" was released on VHS in February 1994, and on DVD on 15 October 2007. This serial was also released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files in Issue 94 on 8 August 2012.\n\n"}
{"id": "1801433", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1801433", "title": "Terror of the Zygons", "text": "Terror of the Zygons\n\nTerror of the Zygons is the first serial of the 13th season of the British science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\", which was first broadcast in four weekly parts on BBC1 from 30 August to 20 September 1975. It was the last regular appearance by Ian Marter as companion Harry Sullivan and Nicholas Courtney as Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart.\n\nThe serial is set in and around Loch Ness and in London. In the serial, the alien shapeshifters the Zygons plot to use their cyborg sea monster the Skarasen to take over the Earth after they discover their home planet was destroyed.\n\nThe Fourth Doctor, Sarah Jane Smith and Harry Sullivan arrive via the TARDIS in Scotland near the North Sea where Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart and U.N.I.T. are investigating the destruction of oil rigs. The survivors' assertion that the rigs were destroyed by a huge sea creature is corroborated by giant teeth marks in the wreckage.\nDuring their investigation, Harry is captured by the Zygons, a shape-shifting alien race hiding in their submerged spacecraft. Their leader, Broton, tells Harry that their spaceship had sustained damage and landed on Earth centuries ago to await rescue, but when they discovered that their home planet had been destroyed in a stellar explosion they decided instead to conquer the Earth and terraform it to suit their physiology. To achieve this goal, they have captured several humans to use as \"body prints\" to infiltrate key leadership positions, including the influential Duke of Forgill who serves as head of the Scotland Energy Commission. They had also brought an embryonic sea creature called the Skarasen to Earth and augmented it with cyborg technology until it has reached giant proportions. They are directing it with a signalling device to attack the rigs as part of their larger plan.\n\nWhilst investigating the similarity between the Skarasen and the monster in nearby Loch Ness, Sarah Jane stumbles upon a secret passageway at the Duke of Forgill's mansion. She follows the passage to the Zygons' submerged spacecraft. Whilst searching the ship she locates and frees Harry, who reveals the Zygon stratagem.\n\nWith their presence discovered, Broton accelerates their plan. He takes the Duke's form and leaves for London, while the remaining Zygons fly their ship to a nearby quarry, starting reactors to convert the Earth's atmosphere to one hospitable to Zygons but poisonous to humans. The Doctor sneaks aboard the ship, frees the remaining humans and sets the ship to self-destruct, killing the Zygon crew.\n\nAmong the rescued humans, the Duke warns that he was scheduled to attend the first international energy conference in London that day, which several high-level dignitaries would be in attendance. With the conference to be located in a building near the Thames river, the Doctor fears that Broton will lure the Skarasen to attack the conference. U.N.I.T. races them to London but, before the Doctor can stop him, Broton activates the signalling device. The Brigadier kills Broton, and the Doctor recovers the device just as the Skarasen surfaces. The Doctor throws the device down the Skarasen's throat, and the creature harmlessly submerges and swims out to sea.\n\nThe group returns to Scotland to close up the investigation, with the Brigadier promising the Duke that U.N.I.T. will cover up the incident. The Doctor offers them all a return trip back to London via the TARDIS, but the Brigadier and Harry decline.\n\nInterested in gaining new writers for \"Doctor Who\", script editor Robert Holmes discussed ideas for the programme with Robert Banks Stewart. After their meeting in early 1974, Stewart devised a storyline for a six-part adventure called \"The Secret of Loch Ness\". Stewart felt that Scotland's legendary Loch Ness Monster would make an ideal basis for a story because there were so few details about the mythical creature. Although at first focusing on the Loch Ness Monster itself, Holmes encouraged Stewart to concentrate more on the Zygons, the shape-shifting aliens of the story. As the story evolved, it was known variously as \"The Loch\", \"The Secret of the Loch\", \"The Loch Ness Monster\", \"The Zygons\" and finally \"Terror of the Zygons\".\n\n\"Terror of the Zygons\" was originally intended as the finale for Season 12, ending the TARDIS crew's continuous adventures and delivering Harry Sullivan back to Earth. Instead, due to scheduling concerns, the serial was held back as the first story of Season 13.\n\nDue to budgetary constraints, location filming in Scotland was not possible and outdoor scenes for \"Terror of the Zygons\" were all shot in West Sussex. The North Sea beach scenes were filmed on the beach at Climping; scenes on Tulloch Moor were shot on the common at South Ambersham in the South Downs; and the landing area for the Zygon spaceship was filmed at Hall Aggregates Quarry in Storrington.\n\nJohn Woodnutt had previously appeared as Hibbert in \"Spearhead from Space\" (1970) and the Draconian Emperor in \"Frontier in Space\" (1973), and would go on to play Consul Seron in \"The Keeper of Traken\" (1981). Angus Lennie previously played Storr in \"The Ice Warriors\" (1967).\n\nThis was Nicholas Courtney's last regular appearance in the series. The Brigadier would next be seen in \"Mawdryn Undead\", almost eight years later.\n\nIn \"The Television Companion\" (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker wrote that \"Terror of the Zygons\" gave a stereotypical portrayal of the Scottish and showed how much the show had changed since abandoning its regular UNIT premise. They felt that the story gave the UNIT their \"dignity and believability\" and praised the realisation of the Zygons, though they noted that the shape-shifting concept was not original. Despite the \"major weakness\" of the realisation of the Skarasen, they said \"the story remains a strong one\". In 2010, Mark Braxton of \"Radio Times\" praised the \"exquisitely horrible\" design of the Zygons and the cliffhanger of the first episode where a Zygon attacks Sarah. He also was positive towards guest actor John Woodnutt and the incidental music, calling the whole production \"a class act\", aside from the Loch Ness Monster. DVD Talk's John Sinnott gave the story four and a half out of five stars, praising the cast and the design of the Zygons.\n\nIan Berriman of \"SFX\" felt that it was \"churlish\" to criticise the Loch Ness Monster effect when the story \"gets so much right, including first-class direction, pitch-perfect performances and a hauntingly eerie, folky score\". He also was positive towards the design of the Zygons and their spaceship, though he found their scheme far-fetched. Christopher Bahn, reviewing the story for \"The A.V. Club\", described it as \"fun\" but noted that it could be formulaic instead of trying to be \"groundbreaking\"; he criticised the scene in the second episode in which Broton tells Harry everything about the Zygons, which did not leave much surprise left. Nevertheless, he praised the cast, the action sequences, and the Zygons described as \"wonderfully surreal triumph of Doctor Who visual design\" though otherwise they functioned as typical monster-of-the-week.\n\nReviewing the serial in 1999, literary critic John Kenneth Muir acclaimed \"Terror of the Zygons\" as \"a riveting and horrifying adventure\", singling out the fleshy Zygon costumes for particular praise. He drew parallels with a number of historic \"Doctor Who\" serials, noting that the Zygon story drew on some familiar \"Doctor Who\" ingredients, including alien invasion (\"The Invasion\"), \"body snatchers\" (\"The Faceless Ones\"), an oil rig setting (\"Fury from the Deep\"), biomechanical technology (\"The Claws of Axos\") and the revelation of an ancient Earth legend to be alien in origin (\"The Dæmons\"). However, he was disparaging of the use of a glove puppet to represent the Loch Ness Monster, comparing it to \"the \"Invasion of the Dinosaurs\" debacle\".\n\nA novelisation of this serial, written by Terrance Dicks, was published by Target Books in January 1976 under the title \"Doctor Who and the Loch Ness Monster\". It was later republished under the original title, in 1993, with a cover by Alister Pearson. In the novelisation, the Zygons have a deadly sting, the TARDIS momentarily disappears after landing and the Prime Minister is a man.\n\n\"Terror of the Zygons\" first came out on VHS in November 1988, having been previously available only in Australia; this was in an omnibus format. It was first released in complete and unedited episodic format on Laserdisc in 1997, followed by a new VHS release, also in episodic format, in August 1999 in the United Kingdom, and released in 2000 in the United States and Canada. Music from this serial was released on the CD \"\".\n\nThe story was released on DVD on 30 September 2013. It features a \"director's cut\" version of Part One with a previously unseen and newly restored 1 min 40 second opening scene featuring the Doctor, Sarah and Harry arriving in the TARDIS, which has materialised invisibly due to a faulty fusion plate. The restored scene has been recolourised by Stuart Humphryes. A single disc version (with no extras) of the DVD formed part of the Fourth Doctor Time Capsule released on 29 July 2013.\n\n"}
{"id": "1801436", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1801436", "title": "Revenge of the Cybermen", "text": "Revenge of the Cybermen\n\nRevenge of the Cybermen is the fifth and final serial of the 12th season of the British science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\", which was first broadcast in four weekly parts on BBC1 from 19 April to 10 May 1975. It was the first to feature the Cybermen since 1968's \"The Invasion\".\n\nThe serial is set on Space Station Nerva, now called Nerva Beacon, and the \"planet of gold\" Voga, thousands of years before \"The Ark in Space\". In the serial, the Cybermen plot to destroy Voga, as the gold there is lethal to them.\n\nFollowing on from \"Genesis of the Daleks\", the Fourth Doctor, Harry and Sarah use the Time Ring to return to Space Station Nerva. They land back in the control room, but Sarah notices the TARDIS is not there. The Doctor tells Sarah that it is drifting back in time towards them and they just need to wait for her to catch up. A door slides open, revealing a dead body, and many more beyond in the outer ring of the station.\n\nIn a communications room, crewman Warner warns an approaching spaceship away from the station, which is under quarantine due to a plague. Professor Kellman, a planetary surveyor, asks Commander Stevenson how long they can run a 50-man station with three men, but the other young officer, Lester, thinks they will manage. Nerva is on a 30-year assignment to warn ships away from Voga, the new asteroid it is orbiting, until its presence is updated on all the starcharts of inbound ships.\n\nThe time travellers find a sealed door leading to Section Q. The Doctor surmises that this is the same station they left, but thousands of years in the past, before the solar flares that devastated Earth. As the Doctor tries to get through the door, the trio fail to see a silver, snake-like creature – a cybermat – crawling around the bodies behind them.\n\nSomewhere else, an alien tries to contact Nerva, and barely gets through to Warner before he is shot by two more of his own kind. The only place the signal could have come from is Voga, but Kellman tells Warner that he set up the transmat station there and spent six months cataloguing its rocks. Voga had drifted into the solar system 50 years before and had been captured by Jupiter's gravity. An asteroid of that size drifting between star systems could not support life and he warns against going down to Voga and spreading the plague. Warner logs the call anyway. The Doctor opens the sealed door, activating an alarm warning the Commander, Lester and Warner of the intruders.\n\nOn Voga, Vorus, leader of the Guardians of the mines, orders his men to bury the dead Vogan that was shot earlier. Magrik, his aide, tells him that the Vogan was frightened of Vorus's plan. Vorus tells him that they can trust their agent on Nerva. Gold buys humans, and they have more gold on Voga than in the rest of the galaxy. He also points out that the reason the agent had not contacted them is probably because the Cybermen are monitoring transmissions.\n\nIn the communications room, the cybermat attacks Warner, biting him before it is thrown off. Warner collapses, glowing veins appearing on his face while Kellman enters and pulls the magnetic log tape from the console. The Doctor, Harry and Sarah have reached the forward control room, seconds before Lester and Stevenson enter levelling their weapons at them. The door behind them slides open to reveal the communications room, and Kellman brings Stevenson to Warner's fallen form.\n\nWhen Stevenson sees that Warner has the plague, he prepares to shoot him to stop the infection from spreading, but the Doctor stops him. The Doctor says that they are a medical team sent from Earth, and convinces Stevenson to let Harry examine Warner. They take Warner to the crew quarters as Kellman returns to his own room and spies on the Doctor and Stevenson in the communications room using an assembled camera. Stevenson tells the Doctor about the asteroid, formerly named Neo Phobos, but renamed Voga by Kellman. The Doctor recognises the name: Voga, the Planet of Gold, and realises that Cybermen are involved. Stevenson says the Cybermen died out centuries before, but the Doctor points out they merely vanished after attacking Voga at the end of the last Cyber-War. Hearing all this, Kellman contacts a Cybership nearby, its crew commanded by a Cyber Leader with a black helmet. The ship moves towards Nerva.\n\nAfter Warner dies, the Doctor examines the body and finds two puncture wounds, indicating that Warner was injected with poison and confirming the Doctor's suspicion that there is no plague. The Doctor says that if he had seen Warner earlier he might have been able to use Nerva's transmat to filter out the poison from his system. The Doctor has another suspicion; investigating Kellman's quarters, he finds the communications device as well as some gold. The Doctor hides when Kellman returns, but Kellman realises that someone has been there. He sabotages the room, electrifying the floor and sending gas pouring up from it. Keeping off the floor, the Doctor reaches the door to open it with his sonic screwdriver. Meanwhile, Sarah is attacked by the cybermat.\n\nThe Doctor escapes Kellman's room and hears Sarah screaming. He throws the cybermat to the floor and kills it with some gold dust, but Sarah has already been bitten. The Doctor carries her to the transmat chamber, handing her to Harry, and prepares to beam them down to Voga and back. However, Kellman has taken the transmat's pentalium drive. The Doctor reconfigures the transmat to bypass the sabotaged system while Stevenson and Lester confront Kellman. On Voga, Vorus observes a giant rocket, the Sky Striker. He tells Magrik that his agent has informed them that the Cybermen are heading for the beacon. Vorus wants the Sky Striker fitted with its bomb head in four hours.\n\nThe Doctor jury rigs the transmat, and Harry and Sarah beam down to Voga. With the poison filtered out, Sarah instantly recovers. As Harry notices that the cavern floor is littered with gold, Vogans arrive and capture them. They are brought before Vorus, who wants to know who is still alive on Nerva. However, Harry doesn't respond. They are taken away while Vorus answers a call from Tyrum, chief Councillor of Voga, who arranges for them to meet.\n\nLester and Stevenson capture Kellman. The Doctor explains that the Cybermen fear Voga because gold plates their breathing apparatus and suffocates them. The Doctor cannot get Harry and Sarah back without the pentalium drive, but Kellman feigns ignorance, trying to buy time until the Cybermen arrive. The Doctor uses a control box he found in Kellman's room to activate a cybermat, threatening Kellman with it until he reveals that the drive is around his neck.\n\nHarry and Sarah are chained up in a cave, where Harry notes that the chains are solid gold, a soft metal that perhaps they can file through. Tyrum tells Vorus that he knows that aliens have come to Voga. He also knows that Vorus wants Voga to emerge as a trading power again and not hide from the Cybermen, who disappeared centuries ago. Because of this, Tyrum no longer trusts Vorus or the Guardians, and will send his Militia to take over the mines. Vorus is furious, but Tyrum says his troops have orders to crush any resistance.\n\nFighting breaks out in the mines between the Guardians and the Militia. Vorus tells Magrik to keep Tyrum from finding out about the Sky Striker, and to kill the two humans immediately. Harry and Sarah have managed to free themselves, however, and escape before the execution team arrives. They are pursued by more Guardians, who fire at them. Harry and Sarah are cornered when Militia troops appear in the galleries, forcing the Guardians to stand down.\n\nThe Doctor has repaired the transmat, but is unable to lock on to Harry and Sarah as they have left the receptor circle. Lester detects an incoming ship, but it does not respond to their signals. As the Cybership docks, the Doctor recognises it for what it is, but is unable to lock the hatch. The Cybermen come through, impervious to gunfire, and shoot all three men down. The Cyber Leader tells Kellman that the three men are not dead, merely neutralised, as they are necessary to their plan.\n\nHarry and Sarah meet Tyrum down on Voga and start to talk about their plan to find the TARDIS.\n\nKellman explains that he set the transmat receptors near a shaft that leads into the core of Voga. As the environment is hostile to Cybermen, the three men will carry explosives down to Voga and destroy the asteroid. Kellman insists on going down first to check that the transmat is functioning properly. There, he runs into some Militia. Not realising the distinction between them and the Guardians, he demands to see Vorus and is taken away while trying to warn them that they are all in danger. Meanwhile, when Harry and Sarah mention Cybermats, Tyrum decides to take them to the gold mines to confront Vorus.\n\nThe Doctor wonders what Kellman's reward is, if it is not Voga's gold. He taunts the Cyber Leader, saying that the Cybermen were finished once humans discovered their weakness to gold and ended the Cyber-Wars. The Cyber Leader tells the Doctor that is the reason why Voga must be destroyed before the Cybermen begin their campaign again. The Cyber Leader says that Kellman was promised the rule of the solar system after the Cybermen had conquered it.\n\nWith Cyberbombs strapped to their backs, the Doctor, Lester and Stevenson are briefed. They are to plant the bombs in the planet's core, after which they have 14 minutes to return and escape via transmat. If they try to remove their harnesses before they reach the target zone, a secondary explosion will kill them. Their progress will be followed by radar, so if they go off course the Cybermen can use manual controls to explode the bombs. The three beam down, accompanied by two Cybermen, one of them holding a timer. Militia arrive and start to fire on the Cybermen. The Doctor, Lester and Stevenson run away as the two Cybermen kill two out of three Vogans, the other running away. The two Cybermen climb under a rock and enter a chamber with a staircase going up the side. Vogans who were stationed on the stairs open fire on the Cybermen but their weapons are useless and they are all killed by the Cybermens lasers.\n\nNone of the three men believe that the Cyber Leader will keep his word about letting them escape, but they have to keep moving towards the target zone as they are being monitored. On Nerva, the Cyber Leader declares that Kellman is of no further use to them.\n\nTyrum questions Kellman, who tells him that he and Vorus were working to lure the Cybermen to the beacon, which Vorus has targeted with a rocket. At that moment, a Militia man arrives to tell Tyrum about the arrival of the Cybermen, and how their weapons are useless. Although Kellman urges them to use the rocket, Tyrum orders his men to use every weapon they can while he speaks to Vorus. Harry tells Sarah to get back to Nerva and warn the Doctor while he tries to stop the rocket from being fired.\n\nWhen Tyrum tells Vorus about the Cybermen on Voga, he shows Tyrum the Sky Striker. However, with the Cybermen already on Voga, they have no time to get it ready. Vorus claims his plans were to just free his people from the fear of the Cybermen and bring them back into the light. Tyrum scoffs, seeing as Vorus has allied himself with Kellman, a double agent and murderer, motivated only by the promise of gold. Harry suggests finding another way into the core to stop the bombs.\n\nThe Cybermen continue their slaughter of the Vogans as the bomb timer ticks down. Sarah uses a motor boat and transmats back to Nerva, where she overhears the Cybermen monitoring the three men's progress. However, as they descend, the heavier concentration of gold interferes with the radar. The men continue onward, however to the centre of the asteroid.\n\nMeanwhile, Harry and Kellman are crawling down a cross shaft towards the same location. With the exit blocked, Harry pushes against the rocks, causing a rock slide. Kellman pushes Harry out of the way, but is crushed to death by a boulder, while on the other side, rocks rain down on the Doctor. Harry exits the shaft and finds the Doctor unconscious. Not realising the danger, Harry tries to unbuckle the Doctor's harness.\n\nFortunately, Harry is stopped by Lester. The Doctor awakens and conceives a plan. Stevenson will continue on and create a radar trail, while the rest use the cross shaft to surprise and attack the Cybermen with gold. The Doctor and Harry jump the two Cybermen, trying to push gold dust into their chest plates. However, the Cybermen are too strong, and Harry and the Doctor are forced to retreat. Lester leaps onto the Cybermen and undoes his harness, the explosion killing both himself and the Cybermen in a burst of flames.\n\nWith the loss of contact, the Cyber Leader orders immediate detonation. Sarah tries to stop them but is thrown to the floor. However, when the button is pressed, no explosion follows. The Doctor has managed to disarm the countdown device, which allows him to release his harness safely. With Sarah tied up, the Cyber Leader now plans to send Nerva, loaded with more Cyberbombs, to crash into Voga to destroy it.\n\nMagrik tells Vorus that the Sky Striker is now ready, but before he can launch it, the Doctor asks them to give him 15 minutes to transmat to Nerva and deal with the Cybermen himself, armed with a bag of gold dust. If he does not contact them by that time, then they can launch the rocket.\n\nThe Doctor reaches Nerva and frees Sarah while the Cybermen are loading the bombs. He takes the cybermat and its control box, filling the cybermat with gold dust. The Doctor sends the cybermat to attack a Cyberman, injecting him with the dust and killing him. As Nerva begins to move towards Voga, Vorus sees this and attempts to fire the rocket. Tyrum shoots Vorus, but as the Guardian dies, he triggers the launch.\n\nThe Doctor and Sarah's attack on the remaining Cybermen fails; The Doctor is forced by the Cyberleader to tie himself and Sarah up and they are left to perish in the crash. However, the Sky Striker is approaching just as fast. The Doctor manages to untie them both with a trick learned from Harry Houdini, and contacts Voga, instructing them to steer the rocket towards the Cybership. The Sky Striker veers away from Nerva and destroys the Cybership. However, the beacon is still on a collision course. The Doctor unlocks the gyro controls, skimming Nerva just above Voga's surface until they reach the other side of the asteroid and open space.\n\nThe TARDIS materialises just as Harry arrives via transmat. The Doctor tells his companions to hurry up; he has received a message from Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart through the space-time telegraph the Doctor left him, which means it is a grave emergency. Although Harry asks if they should say good-bye to the Commander, Sarah tells him not to argue. They rush into the TARDIS and it dematerialises.\n\nGerry Davis wrote the initial script \"Return of the Cybermen\". Robert Holmes' rewrite added the Vogan elements to give \"Revenge\". Producer Philip Hinchcliffe was new to the programme so this serial was commissioned by his predecessor Barry Letts. Letts and Holmes felt that with a new Doctor coming in and at that stage little idea of how he would be played, it would be best to play safe by using familiar big-name monsters such as the Daleks and Cybermen in the first season. The script was modified as production developed to incorporate Tom Baker's style, and also had to be rewritten to modify how writer Gerry Davis had envisaged the new Doctor – as a more timid, reserved figure much in the manner of Patrick Troughton, which happened to be rather unlike Baker's portrayal. Rewrites by Robert Holmes made the Cybermen more emotional than writer Gerry Davis was happy with. Davis was also unhappy with the story's title. \nThe story was shot on the same set as \"The Ark in Space\" – representing a substantial cost saving – with location filming in Wookey Hole Caves. It was also shot in the production block immediately after \"Ark\", which explains why the production code is out of broadcast sequence. The location filming at Wookey Hole was plagued by a series of problems which the crew blamed on a curse. The curse apparently was brought about when the production staff found a small rock formation that the locals called \"The Witch\". Despite warnings, they proceeded to put a witch hat and cloak on it. The assistant floor manager suffered a severe attack of claustrophobia, another crew member fell ill, and an electrician suffered a broken leg when a ladder collapsed. During the scene when Sarah Jane rides one of the water skimmers, the boat went wild and Sladen was forced to jump off, treading water despite heavy boots until her rescue by Terry Walsh, the programme's longtime stuntman. Both required precautionary vaccinations at a local hospital but were otherwise unhurt. The boat disappeared and was never seen again.\n\nThe secret radio transmitter disguised as a clothes brush, used by Kellman, is the very same prop that appears in the 1973 James Bond film \"Live and Let Die\". The prop was handed over by none other than Bond star Roger Moore himself when he visited the BBC in 1973. He later told the \"Radio Times\" that the props master, not recognising Moore, had paid him two shillings and sixpence for the item: \"I'd popped into the Beeb [BBC] for a cup of tea and spotted a notice about an upcoming \"Doctor Who\", so I thought the darlings would be so cash-strapped they'd need anything they could get their hands on. It wasn't MGM, after all. But I didn't expect to walk out with two and six!\"\n\nThe masks for the principal actors playing the Vogans were specially moulded to their faces, but for the non-speaking artists the BBC had to cut costs. According to actor David Collings on the DVD commentary, who played Vorus, the masks for the extras were made using a facial mould of the \"Dad's Army\" star Arnold Ridley. Originally, Cyber-costumes from the 1968 serial \"The Invasion\" were to have been used, but only two had survived, and in poor condition. This necessitated entirely new outfits, which included chest panels constructed from the innards of old television sets and trousers which, for the first time since \"The Moonbase\", were not tucked into the Cyber-boots. Director Michael E. Briant opted to put the characters on the Nerva Beacon into contemporary clothing and have them use modern machine guns rather than attempt to depict the future through fashion.\n\nAnother first appearance is the symbol which would eventually be known as the Seal of Rassilon. In this story, however, it is a symbol of the Vogans. Designer Roger Murray-Leach reused the Vogan symbol for the Time Lords in \"The Deadly Assassin\" and it has remained associated with the latter ever since (most recently in 2007's \"The Sound of Drums\"). A Vogan costume was later reused for the \"Blake's 7\" episode \"Warlord\", still sporting the \"Seal of Rassilon\".\n\nCarey Blyton composed the incidental music for this serial, his final work for the series. Producer Philip Hinchcliffe asked the BBC Radiophonic Workshop to enhance the score, which was done by Peter Howell by adding some synthesiser cues to Blyton's score. This was Howell's debut on the series but it was uncredited. Howell would go on to arrange the 1980 Doctor Who theme music and provide incidental music for the series from \"The Leisure Hive\" (1980) to \"The Two Doctors\" (1985).\n\nPaul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping gave the serial a negative review in \"The Discontinuity Guide\" (1995), describing it as \"A contradictory, tedious, and unimaginative mess.\" In \"The Television Companion\" (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker said that the story was neither good nor bad, but was a \"disappointing way to end the season\". They praised the new look of the Cybermen, the direction, and some of the supporting characters, but said that it was \"no exception\" of \"a story with a weak script and a poor plot\". In 2010, Patrick Mulkern of \"Radio Times\" gave \"Revenge of the Cybermen\" a negative review, calling the gold revelation \"a ridiculous development\" and said that the Cybermen returned with \"an overall lapse of scripting, performance, design and direction\". However, Mulkern felt that the location work for Voga allowed the story to \"occasionally gleam with life\". \"SFX\" reviewer Ian Berriman called the story a \"blandly competent, meat-and-potatoes action-adventure fare\". On the other hand, Berriman was positive towards the camp appeal of the Cyber Leader, the Doctor being strapped to a bomb, and the \"reliably brilliant\" main cast. DVD Talk's John Sinnot felt that not all of the story's criticism was warranted, and gave it three and a half out of five stars. Sinnot wrote that the Vogans were interesting and the Cybermen were \"menacing\" if not at their best. He still noted plot holes, and criticised the cybermats and Harry's \"bumbling buffoon\" character.\n\nA novelisation of this serial, written by Terrance Dicks, was published by Target Books in May 1976. A Polish translation was published in 1994. In the USA, a novelisation was printed by Pinnacle Fiction in January 1989.\n\nThis story was the very first Doctor Who serial to be commercially released on VHS in October 1983. It was initially released in an edited omnibus format, with the opening and closing titles of each episode removed. This omnibus was also released on Betamax and Laserdisc. It was one of the very few Doctor Who releases on Video 2000. It was later released in an unedited, episodic format in May 1999 in the United Kingdom only.\n\nThe DVD of this story was released on 9 August 2010 as part of the \"Cybermen\" box set, along with the Seventh Doctor serial \"Silver Nemesis\". It would later be released in the US as a standalone story on DVD in early November 2010. This serial was also released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files in Issue 111 on 3 April 2013.\n"}
{"id": "1801447", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1801447", "title": "Harold Roe Bartle", "text": "Harold Roe Bartle\n\nHarold Roe Bennett Sturdyvant Bartle (June 25, 1901 – May 9, 1974) was an American businessman, philanthropist, executive, and professional public speaker who served two terms as mayor of Kansas City, Missouri. After Bartle helped lure the Dallas Texans American Football League team to Kansas City in 1962, owner Lamar Hunt renamed the franchise the Kansas City Chiefs after Bartle's nickname, \"The Chief\".\n\nBartle was born in Richmond, Virginia, the only child of Samuel Dunn Bartle, a Presbyterian minister and an immigrant from Cornwall, England, and Ada Mae Roe of northern Illinois. The Bartle family was musical, and at age thirteen Harold was playing the piano and organ at his father's church. The same year he also attempted to enlist in the army, but his father produced proof of his age and had him discharged.\n\nBetween 1916 and 1920, Bartle attended Fork Union Military Academy, where his father taught history and military science. There Roe (as he now insisted on being called) became a championship debater. Bartle attended the University of Chattanooga in 1920, where he proved a natural athlete, but he suffered a serious bout of pneumonia. He returned to his family, now in Lebanon, Kentucky, where in 1921, he earned a law degree from Hamilton College of Law, a Chicago correspondence school.\n\nBartle met Margaret Ann Caroline Jarvis in Lebanon, and they were married on September 26, 1923, in St. Joseph, Missouri, where his father had taken another pastorate. The Bartles had one child, Margaret Roe \"Jimmy\" Bartle Taylor. Bartle, who was 6' 4\", weighed well over 200 pounds before his marriage, and he continued to gain until at one point he may have reached 375.\n\nBartle was admitted to the Kentucky bar in 1920 (before completing his correspondence degree) and worked for a Lebanon firm; he was also the Lebanon prosecuting attorney, 1920–22. Nevertheless, Bartle's gifts were as an organizer and promoter, and he was unwilling to spend his life in the law. Bartle had supervised a Boy Scout troop in Lebanon, and in 1923–24, he accepted a position as the executive of the Cheyenne Council of the Boy Scouts of America in Casper, Wyoming, a responsibility that included oversight of the entire state. From 1925 until 1928 he held a similar position in St. Joseph, Missouri; and from 1928 until 1955, he was the Scout Executive at the Kansas City Area Council.\n\nIn 1925 Bartle created the Tribe of Mic-O-Say, an honor camper program, in Saint Joseph, Missouri at Camp Brinton. (In 1930 it moved to Camp Geiger.) In 1929 he brought the Tribe of Mic-O-Say program to a Boy Scout Camp in Osceola, Missouri, at the time known as Camp Osceola but later named the H. Roe Bartle Scout Reservation in his honor. Roe's inspiration for this program dated to his Wyoming years.\n\nWhile a scouting executive, Bartle also engaged in profitable business enterprises and made shrewd investment decisions. He also served on the board of directors of numerous corporations and banks, including largest independent liquor dealer in Missouri. According to his daughter, when his friend, President Harry Truman, asked him to become the regional director of the Economic Stabilization Agency, Bartle had to resign from 57 boards of directors to avoid possible conflicts of interest.\n\nAs a professional public speaker, he regularly addressed political, fraternal, educational, religious, civic, business, and service organizations. (He had a rich, powerful voice, and in Nice, France, he blew out the public address system.) By the time he ran for mayor, he was making 200 speeches a year at fees that ranged upwards from $1,000 each. One service club secretary was so dazzled by Bartle's rhetoric and humor that he announced Bartle had given \"one of the most dynamic speeches ever heard by man.\" A slightly skeptical reporter added that, nevertheless, \"just what he said...was not recorded.\"\n\nThe money Bartle made in the private sector subsidized his public service and allowed him to fund organizations in which he took an interest. For instance, for 30 years he donated his Boy Scout salary to the organization. There were three Bartles, he said, the Bartle \"who makes money, the Bartle who gives it away, and the Bartle who works for free.\"\n\nBartle seemed determined to participate in as many charitable organizations as possible. He accepted thirty appointments to philanthropic boards and commissions and in time became an executive in virtually all of them. During World War II, he served as director of American War Dads, a soldier-welfare group. After the war, from 1945 to 1952, Bartle was president of Missouri Valley College, a small coeducational school associated with the Cumberland Presbyterian Church.\n\nIn 1948, as a college President, Bartle founded and contributed $100,000 toward establishing the American Humanics Foundation, now the Nonprofit Leadership Alliance, a philanthropic organization at Missouri Valley College. Now at seventy-five colleges and universities nationwide, the program prepares students for leadership in nonprofit, public service organizations such as such organizations as the Boy Scouts, Camp Fire Girls, and the YWCA.\n\nBartle was National President of Alpha Phi Omega service fraternity from 1931 until 1946. Alpha Phi Omega grew from 18 chapters when he took office to 109 chapters when he stepped down. It was said that Bartle personally financed the fledgling organization.\n\nBartle was a devout member of Central Presbyterian Church, Kansas City, from 1929 until his death, although he was often not in attendance because he was filling a pulpit somewhere else. (If Bartle was called to substitute for a pastor who was ill, he needed only the time to dress and get to the church. He could work out the sermon on the way.) Bartle served as a member of the general council of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), 1961–68, and was a member of the General Assembly, 1962–66. He was also a charter member of the National Conference of Christians and Jews.\n\nBartle's wife said she believed he \"could do anything on this earth that he sets out to do...and he has more energy than any other five men alive.\" Bartle received numerous honors and awards for his public service, including honorary degrees from at least a dozen colleges and distinguished service medals from a dozen foreign governments.\n\nIn 1955, Bartle, a Democrat, with no previous political experience, was asked to run for mayor of Kansas City on the Citizens' Association ticket. Although the Citizen's Association (of which Bartle had been a founder) had helped sweep the Pendergast political machine out of power in 1940, Bartle chose to run as an independent with Citizen Association support. However, in his reelection campaign of 1959, Bartle also accepted the tacit support of the remnants of the Pendergast machine, leading to unfounded fears about the possible revival of \"boss politics.\" In Kansas City, the mayor was comparatively weak, effectively an at-large city councilman; but Bartle, not surprisingly, was superb at performing the inspirational and ceremonial aspects of his office.\n\nDuring his two terms, Bartle oversaw the desegregation of the city hospitals and removed them from political influence. He also overhauled the city tax structure, organized the mayors and city managers of 67 nearby towns into a planning council, supported the advancement of African-American police officers, and oversaw initial construction of the Kansas City airport and a nearby freeway. Also during his two terms, the Dallas Texans professional football team moved to Kansas City, adopting Bartle's nickname, \"Chief.\" While he was mayor, Bartle went to all two-alarm fires in a fireman's hat, coat and boots; and every weekday morning at 8:00-or when he could actually make it to the station—he broadcast a radio report to the city.\n\nBartle found his first term the more enjoyable. Then he had carried into office virtually the entire Citizens Association ticket. During his second term, a block of councilmen stymied his plans. Although Bartle remained on the 1963 ticket, he asked voters not to reelect him.\n\nBartle was a hail-fellow-well-met, who \"never knew a stranger\" and demonstrated an impressive recall of names. On Christmas, he would regularly spend the day visiting orphanages, the Boy's Home, the city jail, and other places that might be overlooked on such a holiday. For most of his life, Bartle lived simply, becoming more expansive in his personal spending only after being elected mayor. (His greatest extravagance until that point was fine cigars, of which he smoked 25 per day.)\n\nBartle idolized his clergyman father and displayed some guilt for not having followed in his profession. Bartle continued to make major decisions only after deciding what his father would have done in a similar circumstance. But Roe Bartle hated the penury of the clergyman's life. The first time he asked a girl for a date, she rejected him because he was dressed in ill-fitting, second-hand clothes. Crushed, he swore before a mirror, \"hand upraised\", that no child of his would ever know poverty. But once he had the money, he also acquired expensive hand-tailored suits.\n\n\"Kansas City Star\" editor Roy A. Roberts was puzzled by Bartle, \"You can say almost anything you like about Roe Bartle—call him demagogue, opportunist, tycoon or dedicated saint—and you will be correct, but you will speak only half truths. Nobody knows Bartle. He is too complex to be figured out.\"\n\nIn later years, Bartle was plagued by health problems including phlebitis and injuries to his back and legs caused by a 1944 plane crash. Bartle died on May 9, 1974, from complications of diabetes and heart disease. He was buried in Forest Hill Cemetery. The Kansas City Convention Center, opened in 1976, was named Bartle Hall in his honor, and Bartle's wife and friends provided items for exhibit cases that there memorialize his life. Bartle's papers are in the State Historical Society of Missouri.\n\n"}

The hornbook originated in England as long ago as 1450, or earlier. The term has been applied to a few different study materials in different fields. In children's education, in the years before modern educational materials were used, it referred to a leaf or page displaying the alphabet, religious materials, etc., covered with a transparent sheet of horn (or mica) and attached to a frame provided with a handle.\n\nIn United States law, a hornbook is a text that gives an overview of a particular area of law. A law hornbook is a type of treatise, usually one volume, which could be a briefer version of a longer, multi-volume treatise. Students in American law schools often use hornbooks as supplements to casebooks.\n\nIn childhood education from the mid-16th century to the late 19th century, a hornbook was a primer for children consisting of a sheet containing the letters of the alphabet, mounted on wood, bone, leather, or stone and protected by a thin sheet of transparent horn or mica. Sometimes the sheet was simply pasted against the slice of horn. The wooden frame often had a handle, and it was usually hung at the child's girdle. The sheet, which was first of vellum and later of paper, contained first a large cross, from which the horn-book was called the Christ Cross Row, or criss-cross-row. The alphabet in large and small letters followed. The vowels then formed a line, and their combinations with the consonants were given in a tabular form. The usual Trinitarian formula – \"in the name of the Father and of the Sonne and of the Holy Ghost, Amen\" – followed, then the Lord's Prayer, the whole concluding with the Roman numerals.\n\n\n\n\n"}

At an altitude of 800 feet, it isn't the highest fort in the Roman province of Britannia, the highest fort is Epiacum or Whitley Castle, also in Cumbria, at an altitude of 1,050 feet.\n\nThe ruins have been commonly known in recent times as Hardknott Fort or Hardknott Castle, but are identified from the Ravenna Cosmography as the \"Mediobogdum\" fort, situated along the road between the forts of \"Galava\" (Ambleside) and \"Glannoventa\" (Ravenglass).\n\nBuilt between about 120 and 138, the fort was abandoned during the Antonine advance into Scotland during the mid-2nd century. The fort was reoccupied around 200 and continued in use until the last years of the 4th century. During this time, an extensive vicus developed outside the fort. The initial Roman garrison here was a detachment of 500 infantry of the \"Cohors IV Delmatarum\" from the Dalmatian coast.\n\nThe fort is square with rounded corners, 114 metres long externally, or 105 metres internally, the rampart wall being about 1.7 metres thick with ditches adding to the total width of the rampart. The low walls of the fort were \"restored\" some years ago, a slate course showing the height of the walls before their rebuilding.\n\nThe outer wall has four gates, at the centre of each side, and lookout towers at each corner. Within the walls are the remaining outlines of several buildings: two side-by-side granaries, the garrison headquarters building and garrison commander's villa, or Praetorium. In addition to these stone buildings, timber structures would have housed barracks for the mounted auxilia.\nOutside the square of the fort are the remains of the bath house (which has a rare circular \"sudatorium\"), and the levelled parade ground, which is considered to be the finest surviving example in the Western Empire.\nThe parade ground is approximately two hundred yards higher up the slope to the east of the fort. A track led up to it from the East Gate of the fort. A plan of the fort by R. G. Collingwood in 1930 shows the parade ground to have been as big as the fort, with embanked edges to ensure a level surface.\n\nThe fort is on land owned by the National Trust, part of the Trust's Wasdale, Eskdale and Duddon property, and maintained by English Heritage.\n\nLeather objects from Roman occupation have been found at the site. A 1965 excavation found a piece of leather near the granary, thought to be part of soldier's jerkin. Another excavation in 1968 by Dorothy Charlesworth and J. H. Thornton uncovered more leather, including several shoes.\n\n\n\n"}

The serial was the last regular appearance of Elisabeth Sladen in the role of Sarah Jane Smith in \"Doctor Who\".\n\nThe serial is set at an English nuclear power station and on the planet Kastria. In the serial, the alien Kastrian Eldrad (Judith Paris and Stephen Thorne) seeks to regrow his nearly-obliterated body with radiation so he can enact revenge on his people.\n\nMillennia ago on the planet Kastria, a traitor and criminal named Eldrad is sentenced to death for his crimes, including the destruction of the barriers that have kept the solar winds at bay. The pod containing the criminal is obliterated—but his hand survives. In the present day the Doctor and Sarah Jane Smith arrive in the TARDIS at a quarry and are caught up in an explosion. Sarah is rendered unconscious, but in that state, she makes contact with the fossilised hand, its ring placing her under its control. The Doctor takes her to the local hospital, where the mesmeric power of the hand becomes more complete and both Sarah Jane and a pathologist called Dr Carter are brought under its control.\n\nSarah heads for the nearest nuclear generator, the Nunton Complex, where she breaks into the reactor with the hand. It seems to thrive on radiation and begins to regenerate, growing back its missing finger and moving around unaided. The head of the complex, Professor Watson, remains at his post when the reactor goes critical. He offers the Doctor aid and advice in trying to get to Sarah despite Carter attempting to stop the Doctor before falling to his death. Eventually the Doctor reaches Sarah and knocks her down, but not before the hand has absorbed a significant amount of radiation. Retreating, the Doctor takes Sarah to the medical center.\n\nThe hand's ring next takes over a nuclear operative called Driscoll, who is manipulated into bringing the hand into the reactor core while everyone else flees. An RAF bombing raid simply adds to the available radiation and allows Eldrad to regenerate into a fully humanoid form. Finding herself in a female form, she uses her powers to learn from the Doctor why the humans have attempted to destroy her. Eldrad convinces him to take her back to Kastria, explaining that she created the solar barriers that enable her people to thrive, claiming that they were subsequently destroyed when Kastria was caught in the middle of an interstellar war.\n\nThe Doctor, Sarah and Eldrad travel in the TARDIS to Kastria in the present time—150 million years after she left. They find a barren and frozen world, with a few signs of civilisation many floors below ground. Eldrad is seemingly caught and destroyed by one of a series of traps while travelling with the Doctor to a regeneration chamber. Eldrad emerges in his true masculine form, however, and then commences a tirade against King Rokon upon seeing a hologram of him. Admitting that he destroyed the barriers during his attempt to usurp the Kastrian leadership, Eldrad finds the remains of Rokon and learns from a pre-recorded message that the Kastrian race accepted extinction over living a miserable existence underground, destroying their race banks in case Eldrad returned. When Eldrad decides to make his new empire on Earth, the Doctor trips the would-be tyrant into an abyss, keeping the Kastrian's ring to ensure he cannot regenerate.\n\nNot long after departure in the TARDIS, Sarah becomes fed up after everything they have been through together and, after she states her intention to leave, goes off to pack. The Doctor receives a telepathic summons to Gallifrey and declares he cannot take Sarah with him. This news upsets her, despite having already packed. The Doctor returns her to Earth where she tells the Doctor not to forget her. As the TARDIS dematerialises, Sarah realises that the Doctor has not left her in Hillview Road as planned, and probably not even in South Croydon.\n\nWhen the Doctor prepares to hypnotise Sarah, she says \"Oh, no! Not again!\", referring to her earlier hypnosis by Hieronymous in \"The Masque of Mandragora\" (1976) and the Doctor in \"Terror of the Zygons\" (1975).\n\nWhen Sladen announced her intention to leave the series, Sarah was originally supposed to be killed off in a pseudo-historical story involving aliens and the French Foreign Legion. Douglas Camfield, who was supposed to write the scripts, was unavailable to do so, however. This was much to Sladen's relief, as she did not want Sarah to be killed or married off. Sladen also asked that Sarah's departure not be the main focus of the story, as she felt the programme was about the Doctor, not the companion. Baker and Martin intentionally did not write Sarah's departure scene. Instead, the script for that scene was rewritten by Sladen and Tom Baker based upon Robert Holmes' original version.\n\nThe original script for the story featured an aging Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart, who had been moved from UNIT to the Extraterrestrial Xenological Intelligence Taskforce to study UFO activities. He was to be killed when he steered his spaceship into an Omegan kamikaze ship to prevent that ship from crashing into Earth. This was not filmed due to Nicholas Courtney being unavailable. The original script also featured Harry Sullivan. and Miss Jackson was a nameless male. Director Lennie Mayne built up the part, changed the gender, and cast his wife Frances Pidgeon in the role. Eldrad's home was originally identified as the black hole Omega 4.6. When Robert Holmes pointed out to Bob Baker and Dave Martin that the name Omega had already appeared in \"Doctor Who\" (in \"The Three Doctors\"; this story was also written by Baker and Martin), they changed the name to Kastria.\n\nA real-life quarry explosion was filmed for the episode. A rumour persisted for many years that a camera was totally destroyed in the blast. The DVD commentary makes clear that this was a fan myth. The nuclear power station was originally supposed to be the Nuton Power Complex of \"The Claws of Axos\" but was renamed the Nunton Experimental Complex instead. The real-life location was the Oldbury Nuclear Power Station in Gloucestershire. Nearby Thornbury was used for the closing scene.\n\nIn the final scene, Sarah whistles the tune \"Daddy Wouldn't Buy Me a Bow Wow\". Since Sladen was unable to whistle, director Lennie Mayne provided the whistling while Sladen mimed to it.\n\nThe episodes were broadcast on BBC Four on 9 and 10 May 2011 as a tribute to Elisabeth Sladen who had died on 19 April that year. The repeat viewing figures were 1.0, 1.2, 0.9 & 1.3 million respectively.\n\nPaul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping wrote in \"The Discontinuity Guide\" (1995) that the serial was \"engaging and well-acted\", particularly praising Sladen. However, they noted that \"It all goes a bit pear shaped in the final episode, with Stephen Thorne doing his best Brian Blessed impersonation and Eldrad eventually tripping over the Doctor's scarf.\" In \"The Television Companion\" (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker praised Sladen and Judith Paris as the female Eldrad, but criticised Stephen Thorne as the male Eldrad, who seemed too similar to his previous character Omega from \"The Three Doctors\" (1972–73). In 2010, Mark Braxton of \"Radio Times\" was positive towards the location filming and the female Eldrad, but criticised Kastria and felt that the last episode was \"a protracted preamble\" to Sarah's departure. DVD Talk's Stuart Galbraith gave \"The Hand of Fear\" three out of five stars, saying that while the female Eldrad was effective, the story was \"all over the map\" and ran out of steam near the end, with the fourth episode being \"largely a disaster\".\n\nA novelisation of this serial, written by Terrance Dicks, was published by Target Books in January 1979.\n\nThis serial was released on VHS in February 1996. The story was released as a Region 2 DVD on 24 July 2006. It was released in Region 1 on 7 November 2006. It was re-released with new outer packaging on 2 July 2007.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1801473", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1801473", "title": "Edmund P. Gaines", "text": "Edmund P. Gaines\n\nEdmund Pendleton Gaines (March 20, 1777 – June 6, 1849) was a career United States Army officer who served for nearly fifty years, and attained the rank of major general. He was one of the Army's senior commanders during its formative years in the early to mid-1800s, and was a veteran of the War of 1812, Seminole Wars, Black Hawk War, and Mexican–American War.\n\nA native of Culpeper County, Virginia, he was named for his great-uncle Edmund Pendleton. Gaines was educated in Virginia and joined the Army as an ensign in 1799. He served for a year before being discharged, but returned to service in 1801 and remained in uniform until his death. In the early years of his military career, Gaines carried out important tasks including construction of a federal post road from Nashville, Tennessee to Natchez, Mississippi. \n\nAs commander of Fort Stoddert in 1807, he detained Aaron Burr, and Gaines subsequently testified at Burr's trial for treason. During the War of 1812, Gaines advanced through the ranks to colonel as commander of the 25th Infantry Regiment and he fought with distinction at the Battle of Crysler's Farm. Gaines was promoted to brigadier general during the war, and received a brevet promotion to major general.\n\nGaines' post-war service included diplomacy with and military engagements against various tribes of Native Americans, though Gaines later opposed Andrew Jackson's Indian removal policy. One of his infamous post war actions, as a General of the Federal Army, was the destruction of Negro Fort just over the state boundary in then Spanish held Florida. Filled with escaped slaves, the enclave was viewed as a challenge to the authority of nearby states and slavery. Residents included more than 270 people, many African Americans who had escaped slavery by running away. When the fort was taken they were captured, killed, or enslaved. \n\nThe 1828 death of Jacob Brown, the Army's senior officer, touched off a bitter feud between Gaines and Winfield Scott over which had seniority and the best claim to succeed to command. The quarrel became public and President John Quincy Adams decided to bypass both Gaines and Scott to offer the post to Alexander Macomb. When Macomb died in 1841, President John Tyler quickly headed off a rekindling of the Gaines–Scott dispute by appointing Scott as the Army's commanding general. Gaines continued to serve as a district, department and division commander, but became increasingly marginalized as Scott gained influence.\n\nAt the start of the Mexican–American War, Gaines was stationed in Louisiana and issued a public call throughout the southern and southwestern states for volunteers to join Zachary Taylor's army. He faced a court-martial for recruiting without prior authorization, but successfully defended his actions. Gaines died in New Orleans, Louisiana and was buried at Church Street Graveyard in Mobile, Alabama.\n\nEdmund Pendleton Gaines was born in Culpeper County, Virginia on March 20, 1777, the seventh of fourteen children born to James and Elizabeth (Strother) Gaines. He was named after his great-uncle Edmund Pendleton, who was a political leader of Virginia during the Revolution. James Gaines had been a captain during the Revolutionary War and afterwards moved his family to North Carolina, where he was a delegate to the state convention that ratified the United States Constitution and became a member of the North Carolina House of Representatives. The James Gaines family later moved to Kingsport, Tennessee; Edmund Gaines joined the army in 1799, and was commissioned as an ensign. He was discharged in 1800, but returned to service as a second lieutenant in 1801. He was promoted to first lieutenant in 1802, and captain in 1807.\n\nIn the early 19th century, Gaines surveyed routes and boundaries in the Mississippi Territory including parts of the Natchez Trace. In 1800, he commanded ten companies of the 2nd Infantry Regiment in the construction of the federal post road from Nashville to Natchez. His experience led him to become a strong advocate of using the military to construct a national railroad system.\n\nIn 1807, Gaines was the commandant of Fort Stoddert. During this time, he arrested former Vice President Aaron Burr in Wakefield, Alabama after Burr was alleged to be involved in a conspiracy to separate the western states from the rest of the country. Burr was detained by a military guard under Gaines's command and later turned over to federal authorities, who transported him to Richmond, Virginia. Burr was tried later that year, and Gaines testified at his trial, describing the circumstances that led to Burr's identification and arrest. Burr was acquitted on September 1, 1807.\n\nFrom 1807 to 1808, Gaines surveyed the route that the Gaines Trace road between the Tennessee River near the mouth of the Elk River and the town of Cotton Gin Port, Mississippi. Afterwards, he took a leave of absence from the army to practice law.\n\nThe War of 1812 brought Gaines back to military duty and he was appointed major of the 8th Infantry Regiment. In July 1812, became lieutenant colonel in the 24th Infantry Regiment. In 1813, he was promoted to colonel and commanded the 25th Infantry Regiment with distinction at the Battle of Crysler's Farm. He became adjutant of the Army of the Northwest, commanded by General William Henry Harrison, and was with Harrison at the Battle of the Thames. He was promoted to brigadier general on March 9, 1814 and commanded the post at Fort Erie after the U.S. capture. General Jacob Brown was wounded at the Battle of Lundy's Lane and when the Army of the Niagara returned to the fort, command was passed to Gaines. At the Siege of Fort Erie Gaines was in command on the fortifications on 15 August 1814, when a British assault was bloodily repulsed. For this victory – the First Battle of Fort Erie – Gaines was awarded the \"Thanks of Congress\", a Congressional Gold Medal, and a brevet promotion to major general. General Gaines was seriously wounded by artillery fire and General Brown, having recovered, returned to command. Gaines' wound ended his active field for the rest of the war, and he was given command of Military District Number 6.\n\nAt the end of the War of 1812, Gaines was sent as commissioner to deal with the Creek Indians. When the U.S. Army's commanding general, Major General Jacob Brown, died in 1828, Gaines was one of two ranking generals who could have been considered for the post. However, since he and General Winfield Scott had both publicly quarreled with each other over seniority, an annoyed President John Quincy Adams appointed Alexander Macomb; Macomb had also been a brigadier general during the War of 1812, but agreed after the war to accept reduction in rank to colonel so that he could serve as chief of the Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nIn 1830, Gaines opposed President Andrew Jackson's policy of Indian removal.\n\nGaines commanded the Western Military Department during the Black Hawk War. He was still in command of the department during the Second Seminole War in which he personally led an expedition. At the Battle of Ouithlacoochie in 1835, at the beginning of the Second Seminole War, he was wounded in the mouth. On February 20, 1836, Gaines and his men were the first U.S. soldiers to visit the scene of the Dade Massacre in Florida, where they identified and interred the bodies.\n\nIn 1836, he was placed in command of the Southwest Military District. He was given instructions to fortify the border of the Louisiana Territory and Texas in the case that the Mexican army might threaten U.S. territory. He was also given orders to post guards preventing any U.S. soldiers from crossing into Texas and fighting in the rebellion. When Alexander Macomb died in June 1841, he was still serving as the Army's commanding general. John Bell, the Secretary of War recalled the previous Scott-Gaines dispute over seniority; he quickly recommended Scott for the position in order to prevent the dispute from restarting. President John Tyler concurred, and Scott was appointed in July.\n\nGaines was in command of the Army's Western Division at the outbreak of the Mexican–American War. He was reprimanded by the U.S. government for overstepping his authority by calling up Louisiana volunteers for Zachary Taylor's army. He nevertheless called up volunteers from other southwestern states and received a court-martial but was able to successfully defend himself.\n\nIn the years during and following the Mexican-American War, Gaines was in command of a series of military districts. Though Gaines was the Army's senior brigadier general, several individuals were promoted to major general over him during the war, including Zachary Taylor, Gideon Johnson Pillow, and John A. Quitman. He was in command of the Western Division when he died at New Orleans, Louisiana on June 6, 1849. He was interred in the Church Street Graveyard in Mobile, Alabama. He was a Freemason, having been raised in Phoenix Lodge, No. 8, A. F. & A. M, in Fayetteville, North Carolina.\n\nA number of places in the United States were named in his honor, including Gainesvilles in Florida, Texas, Georgia, and New York; Gaines Township in Michigan; and Gainesboro in Tennessee. He was also the namesake of Gaines Streets in Tallahassee, Florida, and Davenport, Iowa; and Fort Gaines, a historic fort on Dauphin Island, Alabama.\n\nGaines was married 3 times. His first marriage was to the daughter of Harry Toulmin, Frances Toulmin (1788–1811), who died giving birth to their only child. His second marriage was to Barbara Blount (1792–1836), daughter of Tennessee statesman William Blount. His last marriage was to Myra Clark (1806–1885), daughter of Louisiana politician Daniel Clark.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1801475", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1801475", "title": "Epiphanes (gnostic)", "text": "Epiphanes (gnostic)\n\nEpiphanes is the author of \"On Righteousness\", a notable early Gnostic Christian literary work that promotes communist principles, that was published and discussed by Clement of Alexandria, in \"Stromaties, III\". Epiphanes was also attributed with founding Monadic Gnosis. G.R.S. Mead however thinks that Epiphanes was a legend and may not have been an actual person, that the real author of \"On Righteousness\" may be the Valentinian, Marcus.\n\nAccording to Clement, Epiphanes was born on Cephalonia in the late 1st Century or early 2nd Century to Carpocrates (his father), and Alexandria of Cephalonia (his mother). Epiphanes died at the age of 17. Clement wrote that Epiphanes was \"worshipped as a god with the most elaborate and lascivious rites by the Cephalonians, in the great temple of Samē, on the day of the new moon.\" Mead discusses that the idea of temple worship is probably a misunderstanding, that Clement may have mistaken the worship of the moon god \"Epiphanes\" with a person of the same name. The Epiphany was a sun-moon festival at the Samē temple. The new moon's life of 17 days (in the lunar cycle) may have been misunderstood as Epiphanes' 17 years of life.\n\nOn the other hand, Vanderbilt Professor Kathy L. Gaca (The Making of Fornication:Eros, Ethics, and Political Reform in Greek Philosophy and Early Christianity, University of California Press, 2003) promotes a view of Epiphanes as one of the voices in early Christianity who held a positive and liberationist view of sexual pleasure, and who was among those like him who were ultimately silenced by the victorious leadership represented by Clement of Alexandria, Tatian, Ambrose, Jerome and Augustine.\nAnother legend that Epiphanes led Monadic Gnosis, may have come from misunderstanding of the Greek word \"eiphanes\" which may have been mistaken as a personal name if in text, when in fact the Greek means \"distinguished\", as in a \"distinguished teacher.\"\n\nA notable belief attributed to Epiphanes and described in \"On Righteousness\" was the idea of communal living or communism, including shared property and spouses. The text begins: \"The righteousness of God is a kind of sharing along with equality.\" The idea of communal living may have come from Plato's ideas in \"The Republic.\" Clement took this very seriously as a sign of libertine promiscuity, but the real followers were likely to be more philosophical and merely observant of the Early Christian practice of Agape, communal feasts and property.\n\n"}

{"id": "1801485", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1801485", "title": "Prey (2006 video game)", "text": "Prey (2006 video game)\n\nPrey is a first-person shooter survival horror video game developed by Human Head Studios, under contract for 3D Realms, and published by 2K Games, while the Xbox 360 version was ported by Venom Games. The game was initially released in North America and Europe on July 11, 2006. \"Prey\" uses a heavily modified version of id Tech 4 to use portals and variable gravity to create the environments the player explores.\n\nThe game's story is focused on Cherokee Domasi \"Tommy\" Tawodi as he, his girlfriend, and grandfather are abducted aboard an alien spaceship known as The Sphere as it consumes material, both inanimate and living, from Earth in order to sustain itself. Tommy's Cherokee heritage allows him to let his spirit roam freely at times and come back to life after dying, which gives Tommy an edge in his battle against the Sphere.\n\n\"Prey\" had been in development in one form or another since 1995, and has had several major revisions. While the general approach to gameplay, including the use of portals, remained in the game, the story and setting changed several times. The game received generally positive reviews and was a commercial success, selling more than one million copies in the first two months of its release and leading to the abortive development of its sequel \"Prey 2\". The rights to \"Prey\" passed on to Bethesda Softworks, who released a reboot of the game in 2017, developed by Arkane Studios.\n\n\"Prey\" is a survival horror first-person shooter with the player in control of the protagonist Tommy as he explores the gigantic extraterrestrial craft Sphere and fights its inhabitants aboard. During the game, the player will collect a number of alien weapons, some comparable to typical first-person shooter archetypes, others more alien in behavior.\n\nThe game's engine introduces two unique aspects to exploration. Portals in the game can transport the player from one area to another instantly; portals can be looked and shot through and can also be traveled in reverse. Unlike the later game \"Portal\", the player cannot create portals directly without the use of mods, and portals remain fixed in space. The game also features variable gravity. Special paths allow the player to walk along them, remaining upright regardless of orientation, though should the player fall or voluntarily jump off the path, gravity will reassert itself. Small planetoids inside The Sphere can also exhibit their own gravity fields, allowing the player to walk completely around the outside of it.\n\nThe player can detach Tommy's spirit from his body, allowing the spirit to roam freely for a short time. The spirit has limited interaction with the environment, though it is able to activate control panels and can use a spirit bow to strike at foes. The spirit force is often used to solve environmental puzzles within the game as well as to locate paths that are not visible to mortal eyes. Although Tommy dies when his health is depleted, he is resurrected after a brief period during which his spirit can increase the health the revived body will have. Two vehicles make an appearance; one is a flying vehicle used frequently for travel and attacking (as well as puzzle solving), and one is only used for a short period near the end of the game.\n\nThe bar that the game begins in is interactive, with usable restroom facilities, a TV with various channels (including a clip from \"Duck and Cover\"), a fully playable \"Pac-Man\"-style game called \"Rune Man\" (referring to a previous game by Human Head entitled \"Rune\"), several video casino machines (including blackjack, draw poker, and a slot machine), and a jukebox that plays a small selection of licensed songs.\n\nDomasi \"Tommy\" Tawodi (voiced by Michael Greyeyes) is a Cherokee mechanic and former United States Army soldier living on a Native American reservation in Oklahoma. The game begins with Tommy in a bar owned by his girlfriend, Jen. Tired of life on the reservation, Tommy tries to convince Jen to leave it with him, but she refuses. After a fight between the two, a fight erupts when two men at the bar will not leave. The building is lifted up by some kind of force into a green light above. Tommy, Jen, Tommy's grandfather Enisi, and other captives are transported to a massive alien starship called the Sphere. Tommy is freed in an explosion set off by a mysterious stranger, who, although he is cybernetic like most of the Sphere's inhabitants, appears to be working against the Sphere.\n\nTommy witnesses Enisi's brutal death in an alien device. While attempting to find Jen, he has a near-death experience and travels to an after-life known as the Land of The Ancients, where his grandfather bestows spiritual powers upon him. Tommy gains the ability to separate from his body to pass through obstacles, come back to life after being killed, and aid from his spirit guide, the ghost of his childhood pet hawk, Talon. Despite being entrusted by his ancestors with the mission to protect Earth from the Sphere, Tommy is only interested in rescuing Jen.\n\nTommy finds Jen, whose torso has been surgically attached to a reptile-like creature that attempts to kill Tommy. Because Jen cannot control the beast she is attached to, Tommy kills it, along with Jen, in the process. Tommy learns that the Sphere is an organic alien ship with the main goal of maintaining itself by preying on various alien races. The Sphere houses many of these alien races, which have become mindless drones in servitude of the Sphere. The Keepers of the Sphere, who appear to be responsible for its creation, plant life on other planets, and periodically return to harvest it. A small band of human rebels on the Sphere named the Hidden have not lost control of themselves. Led by Elhuit, the Hidden hope to destroy the Sphere and return to Earth.\n\nTommy finds that the Keepers and their drones are controlled by the Mother (voiced by Tyne Turner), who communicates telepathically with him throughout the game. She reveals to Tommy that she was once human, too, and fought the previous Mother of the Sphere, who persuaded her to take its place as the new Mother. After Tommy defeats her, the Mother begs Tommy to take her place, acquiring god-like powers in the process, or else the Sphere will perish. While tempted, Enisi's spirit contacts Tommy, reminding him of his humanity and duty. Tommy heeds his grandfather's advice and drives the Sphere into the Sun, and ends up in the Land of the Ancients once more to see Enisi and Jen. Tommy returns to Earth, knowing that he will see them both again when it is his time to live in the Land of the Ancients.\n\nSix months later, Tommy has rebuilt the bar. The official story of the bar's disappearance is that the original building and the people within it at the time of its disappearance vanished due to an unknown natural phenomenon. Elhuit arrives in the bar and explains to Tommy that she and other Hidden escaped through a portal just before Tommy destroyed the Sphere, and tells Tommy that powerful beings elsewhere wish to meet him. Tommy steps through a portal made by Elhuit as the words \"Prey will continue ...\" appear on-screen.\n\n\"Prey\" has a long and storied development history that spans over a decade, starting in 1995. It went through several iterations of the game design and software technology before its eventual release in 2006.\n\nIn 1995, the first incarnation of the game was announced. \"Prey\" was envisioned by 3D Realms as the first of a number of games to be running on unique, cutting edge game engine technology, developed in house. In this sense the project played the same role as \"Unreal\" did for Epic Games, and it would retain this role in the company's strategy throughout its development time in the 3D Realms studios.\n\n\"Prey\" as a game was to go through many different forms during this first development period. A rapid succession of different designs was outlined by Tom Hall (previously of id Software and later of Ion Storm), who was at that time fresh off the \"Rise of the Triad\" team at Apogee Software. After about a year's worth of work, however, Tom Hall abandoned the project and left the company to form Ion Storm with ex-id compatriot John Romero.\n\nAt this point, 3D Realms brought on Paul Schuytema to begin the next phase in the game's development. The new team would go on to create a new game design. The alien abduction theme from Hall's work was retained, but now the game was to be set on a massive, ring-shaped artificial world called \"Trocara\", inhabited by four different alien races, one of them called \"the Keepers\". The player would take the role of a Native American hero, called Talon Brave.\n\nThe game was the first in the genre to make use of moveable portal technology, a feature that allowed rips in space to be created, moved and reshaped in real time. This was to be a core feature of the gameplay, along with heavily destructible environments. It was also thought at the time this engine would be used for \"Duke Nukem 5\" (the game after \"Duke Nukem Forever\"). Demonstrations of these features drew widespread acclaim at the 1997 and 1998 E3 exhibitions – the television program Infinite MHz was able to capture exclusive footage of the game's private behind-closed-doors demo at both of the game's E3 showings. The public perception was very positive, the game looked impressive, and 3D Realms' name, fresh from the success of \"Duke Nukem 3D\" was a mark of quality.\n\nGerman industrial band KMFDM was to create the game's soundtrack. 3D Realms posted on their website in 1997 that they received a sample of the soundtrack from KMFDM and highly praised the music, described as \"ambient industrial\". On December 19, 1997, 3D Realms also released two KMFDM songs in MP3 format (that are not on the \"Prey\" soundtrack), \"Inane\" and \"Megalomaniac\".\n\nSeemingly insurmountable technical problems ground development to a near-halt, and this version of \"Prey\" too fell apart. Later, on an Internet discussion board head engineer William Scarboro would comment that \"in hindsight, portal tricks such as these should be used as tricks, not as an engine paradigm.\"\n\nShortly after the Schuytema variant of \"Prey\" disbanded, 3D Realms attempted again to revive the project by bringing on tech programmer Corrinne Yu in November 1998. Development of the game itself was not part of this effort, Yu was working by herself on the game engine exclusively.\n\nThe title was put on indefinite hold (although never formally canceled, contrary to popular opinion). On March 8, 2000, \"Prey.net\" (an early Prey site with a section about KMFDM) released a RealAudio file of a third KMFDM song: \"Missing Time\", which was going to be part of the \"Prey\" soundtrack but was featured in the film \"Heavy Metal 2000\" instead (under the name MDFMK which is a side project of KMFDM members during their temporary break-up).\n\nIn 2001, 3D Realms began development on a new version of the title. This time, with the advantage of the necessary portal technology already being a stable and functional component of all modern game engines, 3D Realms was able to license the necessary technology instead of having to develop it. 3D Realms chose the id Tech 4 game engine from id Software, and \"Rune\" developer Human Head Studios was commissioned to develop the game using the previous designs as a base.\n\nRumors of this new project leaked out to the public in 2002, through the website Evil Avatar, but were at that time denied in the 3D Realms forums by Joe Siegler. It was not until 2005, when the cryptic clue \"Keep your eyes open for the unveiling of our next game very soon.\" appeared on the 3D Realms website that the previous rumors were confirmed in any way. This was followed by a CNN article by Chris Morris, claiming that \"Prey\" was not only in development, but that it would be shown at E3. Soon afterwards, the official \"Prey\" teaser site was launched, confirming the game's existence, and hinting that more would be revealed in the June issue of \"PC Gamer\", which indeed featured a seven-page article on \"Prey\".\n\n\"Prey\" was officially announced in a press release by 2K Games on April 26, 2005. On April 28, 2006, a July 10 release date was announced (although 3D Realms claims that is not the formal release date since it did not come from them or Human Head). On May 19, 2006, 3D Realms announced that a demo of \"Prey\" would be released on June 22, 2006—the PC demo was released on this date, but the Xbox 360 demo was delayed until June 30. On June 28, it was announced that \"Prey\" had officially gone gold. A playable single and multiplayer demo of the game was released on June 22, 2006, for Microsoft Windows, and a downloadable Xbox 360 demo was released on the Xbox Live Marketplace on June 30, 2006.\n\nThe June 2005 issue of \"PC Gamer\" revealed that the game uses a heavily modified version of id Tech 4 capable of rendering \"huge cavernous spaces as well as more traditional passages\". The game also supports the dynamic portals that were seen in the 1997/1998 video clips, which are used by friends and foes alike. It also has the ability to change gravity in many parts of the game, via small items that need to be shot to become active, which is used to solve many puzzles throughout the game. Various landscapes in the game (large rocks, for example) have their own gravity that overrides the normal gravity in the game.\n\nDomasi (Tommy) Tawodi's background was chosen due to the amount of mythology in Cherokee oral tradition, which 3D Realms had planned to use for a number of games. When it was first revealed that the game's protagonist would be a Native American, the response was mixed due to concerns that he would be a stereotyped caricature, and that players would have difficulty identifying with a Native American character. Tommy is voiced by Michael Greyeyes, and Jen is voiced by Crystle Lightning, who are both Plains Cree. Greyeyes approved of the way that Tommy was depicted in the game, contrasting \"Prey\" to a film production:\n\nThe game went gold on June 28, 2006, and was released in North America on July 11, 2006, and on July 14, 2006, in Europe. \"Prey\" was the only major title to utilize the new Triton distribution system, which went out of business months after the game's launch. Following the demise of Triton, \"Prey\" moved to distribution via Steam.\n\n\"Prey\" shipped in a Limited Collector's Edition for both PC and Xbox 360. It came with an embossed collector's tin, an upgrade to one DVD-ROM (as opposed to three CD-ROMs), two pewter figurines (Hunter and Tommy), \"The Art of Prey\" booklet, and a free soundtrack download from DirectSong. A third (Mutate) pewter figurine was available separately for purchase to complete the collection of three pewter figurines.\n\nOn November 29, 2006, Aspyr Media announced a Mac port, which was shipped on January 15, 2007. On October 24, 2008, a Linux client for the Prey demo was released by Ryan C. Gordon, who had been working on porting the game for several months. Later that year, on December 7, 2008, the Linux client for the full retail version was made available.\n\nThe soundtrack was composed by award-winning composer Jeremy Soule and his brother, Julian Soule. The \"Prey\" soundtrack was released in two volumes (nearly two hours of the game's three-hour score). The end credits feature the song \"Take Me Home\" by After Midnight Project.\n\nThere are several jukeboxes in the game which allow the player to choose from a small selection of licensed songs. In addition, radio host Art Bell lends his voice to several fictional segments of his paranormal-themed radio show, Coast to Coast AM, that play from radios throughout the game. In the segments, he talks with many callers about the various alien phenomena that occur in the game.\n\n\"Prey\" has a Metacritic average of 83 and 79 out of 100 on the PC and Xbox 360, respectively. The game was highly praised for its graphics and gameplay. GameZone called the graphics \"top notch\", while \"Play\" magazine called them \"incredible\". GamerFeed lauded the gameplay system, calling it \"nothing short of amazing\", and concluding that \"\"Prey\" has got everything anyone could want from a sci-fi shooter and more.\" However, there was criticism directed at the multiplayer component, especially the fact that it only had two game modes. GamesRadar opined that the multiplayer \"could have been much better if only there were more than two modes [and] a couple of maps small enough to play with less than five players.\"\n\nIn October 2006, 3D Realms CEO Scott Miller announced that the game was a commercial success on both PC and Xbox 360 with combined 1 million copies sold worldwide to date. \"Prey\" is ranked third on \"Game Informer\" list of The Top 10 Video Game Openings.\n\nThe editors of \"PC Gamer US\" awarded \"Prey\" their 2006 \"Best Action Game\" and \"Best Multiplayer Game\" awards.\n\nShortly after the game's release, 3D Realms' Scott Miller confirmed that a sequel named \"Prey 2\" was in development. On March 17, 2008, Miller's brand-management group Radar Group was launched, along with the announcement that it was managing \"Prey 2\", slated for release for PC and Xbox 360. The game was being developed in cooperation with Human Head Studios.\n\n\"Prey Invasion\" is a first-person shooter video game developed by MachineWorks, and published by Hands-On Mobile in cooperation with 3D Realms for iOS.\n\nIn 2009, the rights to the franchise were acquired by Bethesda Softworks and id Software parent company ZeniMax Media. On October 30, 2014, during PAX Australia, Bethesda Softworks vice-president Pete Hines confirmed that \"Prey 2\" has subsequently been canceled. Pete Hines stated as follows, \"it was a game we believed in, but we never felt that it got to where it needed to be – we never saw a path to success if we finished it. It wasn't up to our quality standard, and we decided to cancel it. It's no longer in development. That wasn't an easy decision, but it's one that won't surprise many folks given that we hadn't been talking about it. Human Head Studios is no longer working on it. It's a franchise we still believe we can do something with — we just need to see what that something is.\"\n\nDuring its 2016 E3 press conference, Bethesda announced \"Prey\" developed by Arkane Studios, for release in 2017 on Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. The new game is a re-imagining of the \"Prey\" intellectual property rather than a sequel or remake.\n\nEventually, the team would come full circle after the 2019 closure of Human Head Studios shortly after the release of \"Rune II\" with most of the staff moving on to Bethesda-managed Roundhouse Studios.\n\n"}

Venice is known for offering many Advanced Placement classes and having an excellent athletics program. The school is also added an instrumental music teacher, marching band, and Mandarin teacher.\n\nDuring the 2011-2012 school year, 69% of Venice High students were Hispanic/Latino, with 12% white/European Americans, 10% African Americans and 8% Asian Americans. According to the Los Angeles Times Mapping L.A. project as well as zip code maps, because the school is just east of Walgrove Avenue it is not located in Venice, but the adjacent neighborhood of Mar Vista. According to the City of Los Angeles's Venice Community Plan map, however, the school is located in Venice.\n\nSeveral neighborhoods, including Venice, Marina Del Rey, Mar Vista, and Del Rey, feed into Venice High School. The unique educational pathways offered by the six small schools draw students from across Los Angeles.\n\nElementary schools in the Venice High district include Beethoven Elementary, Mar Vista Elementary, Playa del Rey Elementary, Broadway Elementary, Braddock Drive Elementary, Stoner Avenue Elementary, Short Avenue Elementary, Westminster Avenue Elementary School and Coeur d'Alene Avenue Elementary School. Marina Del Rey Middle School, Daniel Webster Middle School, Mark Twain Middle School, and Palms Middle School feed into Venice. Until LAUSD established sufficient capacity in the area during the immediate post-World War II period, Culver City-based Betsy Ross Elementary, now closed, had been the largest single feeder to the then 7–12th grade high school.\n\nThe school's student news site, called \"The Oarsman, \"began as a school newspaper. \"Written Voice\", a literary journal started in the spring of 2012, features students' poetry, short stories, and other work. An unofficial newsmagazine, \"The Venice Independent\", was formerly run by Venice students.\n\nThe current principal is Mr. Gabriel Griego.\n\nThe school was established in 1911 (then called \"Venice Union Polytechnic High School\") when classes were held in an old lagoon bathhouse two blocks from the beach. It moved to a new neo-romanesque structure at its present 29-acre campus two miles inland a decade later.\n\nA famous statue, installed in 1922 and for which then-unknown Venice High School student Myrna Loy served as model, stood on the front lawn of Venice High School for over 70 years. An unsightly cage was erected to prevent vandalism, but the statue was ultimately removed and sent to indoor storage in 1998. However, a bronze-cast replacement statue was mounted before 2,000 cheering onlookers in an April 2010 ceremony.\n\nOn March 10, 1933, the school was seriously damaged by the Long Beach earthquake. As a result, classes were held in hastily constructed tents for two years until a replacement school was built. Art Deco earthquake-resistant buildings were built in 1935, and are still used by the school today.\n\nIn fall 2007, some neighborhoods zoned to Hamilton High School were rezoned to Venice High School.\n\nOn May 15, 2009, students staged a walkout in response to LAUSD increasing class sizes and cutting teachers. Students who engaged in the walkout received support from the ACLU and the National Lawyers Guild in clearing their truancies on that particular day. A similar walkout occurred in 1951 when school administration disqualified a candidate for student body office because of a questionable campaign speech. Administration retaliated by focusing on agitators within the heretofore self-selective service clubs, suspending the clubs and then reorganizing them later with a more pliant membership. Small protests (e.g. graffiti, lawn burnings, tree fellings) continued sporadically for a year.\n\nAs of 1998 the school has mathematics and science programs and a magnet program that explores international politics.\n\nAs of 2017, the World Languages and Global Studies Magnet offers courses in Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, Italian, French and Spanish.\n\nVenice High School won back-to-back National Science Bowl championships in 1996 and 1997, and won regional championships in 1993, 1994 and 2005. Venice High School is one of only three schools that have won two National Science Bowl championships.\n\nIn 1998 Richard Lovett, the president of the Creative Artists Agency (CAA), gave self-esteem courses to the students, and Terry Hardy of \"Los Angeles Magazine\" wrote that the CAA \"has adopted Venice High as its very own.\"\n\nAn historically successful sports competitor, Venice High fields 16 sports with most teams competing in the Western League of the CIF LA City Section. The football team has won 9 of the last 10 Western League titles and the baseball team has won five City championships (1967, 1972, 1984, 1985, 1986). The girls' softball team won the CIF LA City Section Division 2 championship in 2013. The basketball team won the City championship in 1948. The boys' swimming team won three consecutive City championships in the 1950s (even before the school had an on-campus pool). The school also captured the City championship in golf in 2011 and 2012. The boys' volleyball team won back-to-back City Championships in 1991 and 1992. Eight graduates have appeared in Major League Baseball and NFL games in the last 20 years\n\nVenice High School was used as the Rydell High School location for the 1978 movie \"Grease\"—in which the opening shot was the Myrna Loy statue. The school was also used in other movies such as \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\", \"American History X\", \"Matchstick Men\", and \"Heathers\", as well as in several music videos, including Britney Spears' international hit \"...Baby One More Time\", Bowling for Soup's \"High School Never Ends\", Cher Lloyd's \"Oath\", and Young MC's \"Principal's Office\". Venice is also in The Faders' \"No Sleep Tonight\". Additionally, aerial photographic images of the school were used to show the location of the high school in the 1987 movie \"Masters of the Universe\". The campus was also used for the TV show \"Glee\" on an episode (\"Yes/No\", aired January 17, 2012) which recreates the classic \"Summer Nights\" scene from \"Grease\", as made famous by John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John (and filmed on the same location). The Australian TV series \"Rake\" also used Venice High School as a filming location. The music video for Alesso's 2014 song \"Cool\" was also shot here.\n\nThree University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) student housing facilities for families are zoned to Venice High School. They include Rose Avenue Apartments, University Village, and Venice-Barry Apartments. Rose Avenue had been rezoned from Hamilton High School to Venice in 2007.\n\nThe Venice High School Hall of Fame was introduced by the Venice High School Alumni Association in 2017. The inaugural inductees were Beau Bridges (class of 1959), John Clayton (1969), Walter Cunningham (1950), Robby Duron (faculty), Skip Engblom, (1967), Bill Fairbanks (faculty), Artie Harris (faculty), Donna Loren (1963), Myrna Loy (1921; posthumous), Abbot Kinney (posthumous), Dana McLemore (1978), Ken Medlock (1967), Audrey O'Brien Griffin (1954), Peggy Oki (1973), Billy E.

It lies north of Keld in the civil parish of Muker, near the borders of County Durham and Cumbria, and close to the northern boundary of the Yorkshire Dales National Park. It is in an isolated location, with the nearest town of Kirkby Stephen being an drive away.\n\nThe Upper Howgate Edge Grit is a coarse-grained sandstone within the Pendleian, the lower subsystem of the Carboniferous structure. Found in the peaks of the highest fells of North Yorkshire, the shale layer containing coal lies above it. The shale under the northwest region is called the Tan Hill seam, and was worked from the 13th century until the early 1930s.\n\nThe first records of coal being produced are from 1384, when locally worked shallow shafts produced coal for Richmond Castle. The poor-quality coal produced a dirty, dusty fuel but when mixed with peat it gave a good glow, and could smoulder overnight until revived in the morning. Before the start of the Industrial Revolution, the easily accessible upper seams were mainly worked out, requiring investment in deeper shafts. By the 17th century the poor-quality coal was locally converted in simple beehive kilns into coke – known locally as \"cinders\" – which was used in lead and iron smelting.\n\nWith modern means of transport having encroached on the valley, the local miners defied the 1926 General Strike. When better coal became more easily available, the local coal became less desirable and the last mine closed in 1929. Locals worked the residual upper seams by hand until the mid-1930s.\n\nThe Tan Hill Inn is the highest inn in the British Isles at above sea level. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, it is at slightly higher elevation than the Cat and Fiddle Inn in the Peak District which is at .\n\nThe building dates to the 17th century, and during the 18th century was used as a hostelry by workers digging coal pits, which is reflected in its earlier name, The Kings Pit. It is unusual for its isolation, but it was previously surrounded by miners' cottages. In addition to miners, farmers and pedlars, frequent visitors at the inn included drovers leading cattle to the coal pits.\n\nAfter the closure of the last mine in 1929, and demolition of the associated cottages in the early 1930s, the pub remained open due to the patronage of local farmers and the development of the motor car.\n\nFrom 1974, boundary changes moved it into County Durham, but this was reviewed in 1987 after much protest, and it reverted to within the Yorkshire boundary. In 1995, the Tan Hill Inn became the first public house in the UK to be granted a licence to hold weddings and civil ceremonies, after new laws were established to allow couples to marry in places other than churches or register offices.\n\nThe pub is a free house and has served a range of beers from the Black Sheep and Theakston breweries. Visiting bands have included Arctic Monkeys, Mark Ronson and British Sea Power.\n\nIn May 2007, Kentucky Fried Chicken threatened legal action against the Tan Hill Inn for trademark infringement over the use of the term \"Family Feast\" on the inn's Christmas Day menu, but on 10 May 2007 KFC confirmed that it would not be pursuing the case.\n\nRevellers celebrating New Year's Eve at the pub on 31 December 2009 were unable to leave the pub for three days as they were snowed in.\n\nIn July 2017 the pub was put up for sale by landlady Louise Peace who had run it for 13 years with her husband Mike. Since mid-2018, the owners have been Andrew Hields and Mike Kenney. They planned to install glass-roofed pods to allow guests to view the Aurora borealis (Northern Lights) from their beds. They were also considering a major restoration: adding more showers and cleaning facilities to the three bunk rooms, as well as charging points and privacy screens; the rooms would be more comfortable and offer more character after the renovations. A report at the time indicated that the owners planned to open the barn as a carvery and to add a second bar. In 2019, the facility was encouraging camper vans and caravans and campers to stay for a moderate nightly fee, and a venue for live music acts was in operation. The guest rooms were refurbished in 2019, and electrical work completed; the other plans for improvements were still in the works. Additional plans for the future included a rustic spa and outdoor pool.\n\nDuring the 1980s the pub appeared in an advert starring Ted Moult for replacement-window company Everest, and it appeared in the first Vodafone advert, broadcast during the 1990s. Everest returned in 2008 to film a new advert with Craig Doyle and installed new windows and solar panels. The inn was visited by James May and Oz Clarke in \"Oz and James Drink to Britain\", first broadcast in 2009.\n\nIn late 2017, the inn again featured in TV coverage, for Waitrose supermarkets' Christmas advertising campaign.\n\nIn May 2019, scenes for ITV show \"Vera\" were filmed, for an episode aired in January 2020. The pub has also featured in \"The Inspector Lindley Mysteries\", \"Murder in Mind\", \"Top Gear\", \"The Fast Show\", \"Wish You Were Here\", \"All Creatures Great and Small\", and \"Jude the Obscure\".\n\n"}

He was the co-founder and guitarist of punk band The Icarus Line, the lead guitarist of industrial rock group Nine Inch Nails, and vocalist/guitarist for Jubilee. North is noted for his chaotic and unconventional guitar approach, his use and command of feedback, and the flailing of his guitar wildly while on stage.\n\nHis reputation for being outspoken both on and off the stage resulted in equal criticism and praise from fans and music journalists, mainly due to his role as co-founder and owner of Buddyhead. More infamously, it also landed him in substantial legal trouble numerous times. The Buddyhead music website was an outlet for his ruthlessly opinionated writing, as well as the many notable interviews he conducted with the likes of Kevin Shields and Greg Ginn.\n\nNorth's creation of Buddyhead Records later extended to his recording and producing many of their bands. Among the groups he signed or issued releases from were At the Drive-In, Ink & Dagger, and The Dillinger Escape Plan.\n\nIn 2008, North suffered a nervous breakdown. During his subsequent hospitalizations due to mental illness and health issues, he determined his disapproval with the directions of Buddyhead and Jubilee were beyond repair. He ceased involvement completely with both soon after, and has not participated in any aspect of music since.\n\nNorth was one of the original members of The Icarus Line, and toured and recorded with the group as a guitarist between 1998 and 2004. During his time with the band they released two critically acclaimed studio albums (\"Mono\" in 2001 and \"Penance Soiree\" in 2004) and three EPs (\"Highlypuncturingnoisetestingyourabilitytohate\" and \"Red And Black Attack\" in 1998 and \"Three Jesus Songs\" in 2003). The band was known for its chaotic live performances, including a notorious incident in 2002 when, during a performance at the Hard Rock Cafe in Austin, Texas, North \"liberated\" a guitar that had belonged to Stevie Ray Vaughan by breaking its protective case with the base of a microphone stand. He tried plugging it into his amplifier, but was then quickly set upon by security. The incident resulted in North receiving numerous death threats from outraged Texans, and legal troubles. North quit the band abruptly in 2004, citing a desire to move into a new direction musically.\n\nNorth joined Nine Inch Nails in 2004 as the lead guitarist in a lineup that featured drummer Jerome Dillon, former A Perfect Circle and Marilyn Manson bass player Jeordie White and keyboard player Alessandro Cortini. He has stated that the invitation resulted from a recommendation to band leader Trent Reznor by producer Alan Moulder, who had worked with both The Icarus Line and Nine Inch Nails. In \"The New Zealand Herald\", Reznor described the first time North jammed with Nine Inch Nails:\n\nNorth was with the band for the \"\" tour (in support of the 2005 release \"With Teeth\") and the \"Performance: 2007\" tour (the latter stages of which were in support of the 2007 release \"Year Zero\"). While touring with NIN in 2005 North performed as a guest guitarist with the band Queens of the Stone Age at various acoustic \"in-store\" performances, and two \"regular\" shows in Los Angeles. In July 2006, North was named (along with Nine Inch Nails) in a lawsuit brought on by Wisconsin security guard Mark LaVoie. This suit alleged that he \"intentionally, and violently\" inflicted injury upon the guard while performing at Alliant Energy Center on Oct. 13, 2005. The lawsuit reportedly settled out of court with LaVoie receiving a substantial amount of money.\n\nNorth is included on the live DVD \"Beside You in Time\" and appeared in the music videos for \"The Hand That Feeds\" and \"Survivalism\". He left the group at the conclusion of the 2007 run.\n\nNorth formed Jubilee in late 2007 with former Icarus Line band-mate, Troy Petrey, on drums, and bassist Michael Shuman (Queens of the Stone Age, Wires On Fire). The band embarked on a brief UK tour in January 2008 with members of Wires On Fire temporarily rounding out the lineup. The band returned to the UK in late 2008 to complete a more extensive tour. Upon their return, they played one show in Los Angeles. This is still the only performance the band has ever played in their native country. Jubilee released two singles in 2008, 'Rebel Hiss' and 'In With The Out Crowd', which were intended to be immediately followed by their debut album.\n\nIn late 2008, North suffered a nervous breakdown while mixing the Jubilee album. After subsequent hospitalizations, he ceased all activity with the band. A \"motorcycle accident\" was used as a public explanation at the time. Months later, attempts to form a new lineup of the band and finish the album were also abandoned by North. It was later learned that North had been diagnosed as being Bipolar I, and having Major Depressive Disorder among other mental illnesses. The still unreleased album includes performances from a vast array of drummers and collaborators including Dave Grohl, Julian Gross, Nick Jago, Joey Castillo, Carla Azar, Josh Freese, Loren Humphrey, Kevin Haskins, Taylor Hawkins, Josh Homme, Trent Reznor and Maynard James Keenan.\n\nNorth co-founded Buddyhead with Travis Keller in 1998. The independent record label and music \"webzine\" was infamous for its gossip section that frequently featured phone numbers of celebrities such as Fred Durst and Courtney Love. The gossip section also frequently slammed Axl Rose of Guns N' Roses. Buddyhead was also known for their infamous antics such as spray-painting \"$uckin' Dick$\" on the tour bus of The Strokes, as well as breaking into the Interscope Records building to steal three of Durst's baseball caps. With no explanation, North ended his association with Buddyhead in 2008.\n\nMany other guitars, effects and amplifiers have been used by North in his various projects, these are only a few of the confirmed pedals that he is currently or has used in the past.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It attaches or suspends the yolk or nucellus within the larger structure.\n\nIn the eggs of most birds (not of the reptiles), the chalazae are two spiral bands of tissue that suspend the yolk in the center of the white (the albumen). The function of the chalazae is to hold the yolk in place. In baking, the chalazae are sometimes removed in order to ensure a uniform texture.\n\nIn plant ovules, the chalaza is located opposite the micropyle opening of the integuments. It is the tissue where the integuments and nucellus are joined. Nutrients from the plant travel through vascular tissue in the funiculus and outer integument through the chalaza into the nucellus. During the development of the embryo sac inside a flowering plant ovule, the three cells at the chalazal end become the antipodal cells.\n\nIn most flowering plants, the pollen tube enters the ovule through the micropyle opening in the integuments for fertilization (porogamy). In chalazogamous fertilization, the pollen tubes penetrate the ovule through the chalaza rather than the micropyle opening.\nChalazogamy was first discovered in monoecious plant species of the family Casuarinaceae by Melchior Treub, but has since then also been observed in others, for example in pistachio and walnut.\n"}

During his time as President of Guyana, the office was that of a ceremonial head of state, with real power in the hands of Prime Minister Forbes Burnham. He was honoured with Guyana's highest national honour, the Order of Excellence (O.E.).\n\nChung was born into Chinese Guyanese family at Windsor Forest, West Coast Demerara in British Guiana; he was the youngest of Joseph and Lucy Chung's eight children. He was educated at Windsor Forest, Blankenburg, and Modern High School. In 1954, Chung married another native of Windsor Forest, Doreen Pamela Ng-See-Quan, with whom he had one daughter and one son.\n\nBefore civic service, Chung was an apprentice surveyor and sworn land surveyor. In the early 1940s, Chung entered the Middle Temple of London, England and qualified as a barrister in 1947. He returned to Guyana and was later appointed an acting magistrate.

Barry Sullivan and Anna Maria Alberghetti were in a 1956 CBS telecast, and John Forsythe played the major in a 1967 Hallmark Hall of Fame broadcast.\n\nThe story concerns Italian-American U.S. Army Major Joppolo (John Hodiak), who is placed in charge of the fictional town of Adano during the invasion of Sicily. The title refers to Major Joppolo's attempts to replace the 700-year-old bell that was taken from the town by the Fascists at the start of the war to be melted down for ammunition. Through his actions, Joppolo also wins the trust and love of the people.\n\nSome of the changes Joppolo brings into the town include:\n\nThe short-tempered American commander, General Marvin, fires Major Joppolo from his position when Joppolo disobeys an order to prohibit mule cart traffic in Adano, which has been disrupting Allied supply trucks, because the mule carts are vital to the survival of the town.\n\nThe character of Joppolo was based on the real life experiences of Frank Toscani, who was military governor of the town of Licata, Sicily after the Allied invasion.\n\n\nIt was in production from early November 1944 to mid-January 1945.

{"id": "1801564", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1801564", "title": "Schönborn family", "text": "Schönborn family\n\nThe Schönborn family is a noble and mediatised formerly sovereign family of the former Holy Roman Empire.\n\nVarious members of the family have held high offices of the Roman Catholic Church and the Holy Roman Empire over the course of centuries, including as bishops, prince bishops, cardinals and prince-electors. In addition to several family members having been elected rulers of ecclesiastical principalities — the Electorate of Mainz, the Princely-Bishopric of Würzburg, the Princely-Bishopric of Worms, the Princely-Bishopric of Speyer, the Electorate of Trier, and the Princely-Bishoprice of Bamberg — the family possessed a fief in Franconia that held imperial immediacy as a county within the Holy Roman Empire, the state of Schönborn.\n\nThe House of Schönborn, especially its ruling prelates of the Roman Catholic Church, were among the most important builders of Southern German baroque architecture. The family gave the name \"Schönbornzeit\" (Age of the Schönborns) to an era (1642–1756), sometimes nostalgically remembered in the popular consciousness as an era of prosperity. Today, the term \"Schönbornzeit\" denotes a particular style of Rhenish and Franconian baroque.\n\nThe Schönborn family first appeared in the Rheingau region with \"H. von Sconenburne\" in 1275. Their original seat was Schönborn in the County of Katzenelnbogen. A secondary source of 1670 mentions an earlier \"Eucharius von Schönborn\" of the mid 12th century, however without documentary proof. The lion in their coat of arms may derive from the Katzenelnbogen as well as from the nearby Diez counts whose vassals they were. By the end of the 14th century, the family had split into three branches one of which extinguished soon. The elder branch resided at Schönborn and held the office of Burgmann at Burgschwalbach, a castle built between 1368 and 1371 by count Eberhard V. of Katzenelnbogen. Gilbrecht of Schönborn was mentioned there in 1373. They were also Burgmanns at Hahnstätten in the County of Nassau. Several of them became abbots, one a grand bailiff of the Knights Hospitaller. The younger branch were vassals in the Westerwald region, in the service of the Barony of Westerburg, the Electorate of Trier, the Electorate of Mainz and the county of Wied. In the 16th century many younger sons of the family became \"Domherren\" (canons), leading to the extinction of both branches, with the exception of a side line of the younger branch that had received the fiefs of Freienfels (near Weinbach) and Eschbach (near Weilmünster).\n\nJohann Philipp von Schönborn of Eschbach, son of a minor nobleman in the employ of the then Lutheran counts of Wied, became a Catholic priest in the impoverished times of the Thirty Years' War. He was admitted as a minor canon by the cathedral chapter of Wurzburg. At the time, the family consisted only of his brother and himself. These two brought the family to power and fame, founding new branches that were to become widely known throughout Europe. Johann Philipp became a priest at Wurzburg Cathedral at the age of 16, changed to Mainz Cathedral in 1625 and to Worms Cathedral in 1630. He became a provost and, in 1642, was elected prince-bishop of Wurzburg. His diplomatic skills made him an important mediator during the Peace of Westphalia negotiations that ended the Thirty Years' War in 1648. As a result, he was elected Archbishop of Mainz in 1647, thus also ruler of the Electorate of Mainz and archchancellor of the Holy Roman empire. In 1663 he also received the princely-bishopric of Worms. He was an effective administrator of his principalities and was able to bring back economic recovery. He fortified the city of Mainz and founded hospitals and high schools. His court was a center of German politics in the post-war era. Johann Philipp was the first of six members of the Schönborn family who, in the course of more than three generations, were to rule over eight of the most prestigious ecclesiastical principalities of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nHe made his brother Philip Erwein (1607-1668) a \"Vogt\" in the Electorate of Mainz where the latter acquired the castles of Gaibach in 1650, of Geisenheim in 1654 and of Heusenstamm (where he built a new castle) in 1661. In 1635 he married Maria Ursula von Greiffenclau-Vollraths, a close relative of the late archbishop and elector of Mainz Georg Friedrich von Greiffenklau; the couple had 12 children. In 1663 Philip Erwein became a baron. The family thus shifted its focus from its regions of origin, which had become predominantly Protestant, to the Catholic ecclesiastical principalities of the empire.\nPhilip Erwein's son, Lothar Franz von Schönborn, also became a prince-bishop of Wurzburg in 1693 and an elector-archbishop of Mainz in 1695. The latter's brother Melchior (1644–1717) acquired the fief of Reichelsburg (near Aub) from the prince-bishop of Wurzburg in 1671, giving him access to the Franconian Circle of the imperial knights.\n\nIn 1701, Melchior's son, Rudolf Franz (1677–1754), married Eleonore von Hatzfeld, widow of the Count von Dernbach, who had left her the \"Herrschaft\" Wiesentheid in Franconia, a small imperial state raised to a county in 1701. Thus, the family obtained imperial immediacy for the first time, and since the counts of Schönborn bear the prefix Illustrious Highness. She had also inherited the Austrian fiefs of Arnfels and Waldenstein in Carinthia from her first husband. Melchior then bought some further estates in Austria in 1710, Göllersdorf with Mühlberg and Aspersdorf in Lower Austria, from the Counts of Buchheim. In 1717, his estate was partitioned into the states of Schönborn-Wiesentheid and Schönborn-Heusenstamm, both retaining immediacy. Heusenstamm was inherited by Schönborn-Wiesentheid in 1801. The state of Schönborn-Wiesentheid was mediatised in 1806.\n\nIn 1726, Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor, granted Palanok Castle with Mukacheve, Chynadiyovo and 200 villages in the Kingdom of Hungary (today part of the Ukraine), to Elector Lothar Franz, after the latter had sent him troops to defeat Francis II Rákóczi, whose property it had been. The estate, one of the largest in Eastern Europe, remained in the family well into the 20th century.\nIn the year 1743, members of the family ruled the following states, all sovereign princely-bishoprics within the Holy Roman Empire: Bamberg, Würzburg, Konstanz, Speyer, Worms and Trier, and the archdiocese and electorate of Mainz (and thus archchancellorship of Germany, a position that two Schönborns had held shortly before) were held by a close relative, Johann Friedrich Karl von Ostein. Not only were important parts of Southern Germany under their control, but also quite wealthy regions. The Schönborns were not restricted to ruling these territories. They followed through, over several generations, with one of the most ambitious building programs of the 18th century, including churches, monasteries, ecclesiastical residences, schools and hospitals. Again, in the 19th and 20th/21st centuries, two Schönborns rose to become archbishops and cardinals. Given that the family started under modest conditions with Johann Philipp in the early 17th century, this success was the result of piety, loyalty to the Catholic church and its strongest supporter in Europe, the House of Habsburg, ambition, diligence, organizational skills, grandiosity in planning, solid finances, advantageous marriages and overall, an iron will in pursuit of their goals through centuries. The House of Schönborn, initially rather impoverished knights, thus managed to surpass many of the more powerful older dynasties and to leave an enormous cultural legacy.\n\nAt the end of the 18th century, three brothers, who were great-grandsons of Rudolf Franz (1677–1754), established the three extant branches of the family:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Schönborn-Heusenstamm was a German statelet ruled by the Schönborn family located in the south of modern Hesse, Germany. Schönborn-Heusenstamm was a partition of Schönborn, and was inherited by Schönborn-Wiesentheid in 1801.\"\n\nSchönborn-Wiesentheid was a County in Lower Franconia, the northwestern Region of modern Bavaria, Germany, comprising various isolated districts spanning from the Regnitz River to the Main River east of Würzburg. Schönborn-Wiesentheid was a partition of Schönborn, and inherited the other line of Schönborn-Heusenstamm in 1801. Schönborn-Wiesentheid was mediatised to Bavaria in 1806. \n\nThis family counts several prelates of the Roman Catholic Church: \n\nThe House of Schönborn, especially its ruling prelates of the Roman Catholic Church, were among the most important builders of Southern German baroque architecture. While the private estates, at a large part still today owned by the family, were of more modest size, sometimes of elder origin, churches, monasteries, ecclesiastical residences and hospitals built by the Schönborn bishops were of immense grandness and splendor. Financing these was only possible with flourishing economies, which the Schönborn bishops did their best to uphold and enhance. Their famous court architect Balthasar Neumann was responsible for many of these buildings, others were Johann Dientzenhofer, Maximilian von Welsch and Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt. The family gave the name \"Schönbornzeit\" (Age of the Schönborns) to an era (1642–1756), sometimes nostalgically remembered in the popular conscience as an era of prosperity. Today, the term \"Schönbornzeit\" denotes a particular style of Rhenish and Franconian baroque.\n\nThe ecclesiastical residences were owned by the church, and continued to be inhabited by successive bishops, while the private estates remained inheritance of the family. They were mostly acquired by the ruling prelates' brothers. Of the grand bishops' palaces, only Weissenstein Palace at Pommersfelden continues to be privately owned by the family, as it was built, from 1711, with an initial amount of 100.000 guilders which were personally granted to elector Lothar Franz by Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor, in reward of his services and his continuous political support. It contains the largest private baroque art collection in Germany.\n\n\n\nMore than 100 churches were built during the rule of Schönborn bishops, many of them by their famous court architect Balthasar Neumann, among them:\n\n\n\n"}

He was one of the leaders of the Saxon Rebellion in 1073-75 and the Great Saxon Revolt of 1077-88 against King Henry IV of Germany.\n\nOtto was born about 1020, the son of Count Bernard of Nordheim (d. about 1040) and his wife Eilika. The rich and influential Saxon comital dynasty of Nordheim was first mentioned about 950, its descendance has not been conclusively established: there is possibly a relationship with the Immedinger family of legendary Duke Widukind, while according to the Magdeburg archbishop Eric of Brandenburg, Otto's grandfather Siegfried I of Nordheim was a son of Count Siegfried of Luxembourg.\n\nThe Nordheim counts held large Saxon estates on the upper Leine and Werra rivers as well as on the Weser and its Diemel and Nethe tributaries and on the lower Elbe river. They also acted as \"Vogts\" (reeves) of the Corvey, Gandersheim, Helmarshausen, Bursfelde, and Amelungsborn. Otto succeeded his father as count of Northeim about 1049, then one of the most influential Saxon nobles along with the Billung duke Bernard II and the Udonid counts of Stade.\n\nAfter the death of the Salian emperor Henry III in 1056, his widow, Dowager Empress Agnes, appointed Otto duke of Bavaria in 1061 in order to gain his support as the mother of, and regent for, the young king Henry IV. The following year (1062), however, when Agnes handed power to her confidant Bishop Henry II of Augsburg, Duke Otto was among those princes who assisted Archbishop Anno II of Cologne in seizing control of Henry IV and the regency, in the so-called Coup of Kaiserswerth.\n\nOtto took a prominent part in the government of the kingdom during Henry's minority. He led a successful expedition into Hungary in 1063 to reinstall King Solomon (betrothed to Henry's sister, Judith of Swabia), who had been driven out by his uncle Béla I. The next year Otto went to Italy to settle a papal schism caused by the appointment of Antipope Honorius II. Otto was also instrumental in securing the banishment from court of the overly powerful Archbishop Adalbert of Hamburg-Bremen. He crossed the Alps in the royal interests on two other occasions and in 1069 shared in two expeditions into the lands of the Polabian Slavs (Wends) east of Germany.\n\nSo far, Otto was on good terms with the young king. However, he neglected his Bavarian duchy and instead added to his Saxon allodial possessions in the southern Harz range, which ultimately led into conflict with Henry IV, who aimed at the consolidation of his royal domains in this region. In 1070 dubious accusations were brought against him by one Egeno I of Konradsburg of being privy to a plot to murder the king, and it was decided Otto should submit to trial by combat with his accuser at Goslar.\n\nFearing for his safety, Otto asked for a safe-conduct to and from the place of meeting. When this was refused he declined to appear and was consequently placed under the imperial ban and deprived of Bavaria, while his Saxon estates were plundered. He obtained no support in Bavaria, but raised an army among the Saxons and carried out a campaign of plunder against Henry until at Pentecost 1071, when he submitted. In the following year he was released from custody and received back his private estates, though not the Bavarian ducal title, which had been granted to his former son-in-law Welf I, the divorced husband of Otto's daughter Ethelinde.\n\nAccording to Bruno, author of \"De bello Saxonico\" (\"On the Saxon War\"), when the Saxon Rebellion broke out in summer 1073, Otto delivered an inspiring speech to the assembled nobles at Wormsleben, after which he took command of the insurgents. By the Peace of Gerstungen on 2 February 1074, the Duchy of Bavaria was formally restored to him, which however met strong opposition by the local nobility, with the result that Otto's former son-in-law Welf I remained \"de facto\" Duke of Bavaria. He also participated in the second rising of 1075 following the demolition of Harzburg Castle. Defeated in the Battle of Langensalza on June 9, he surrendered and was again pardoned by King Henry who made him administrator of the Saxon duchy.\n\nWhen the Investiture Controversy between Henry IV and Pope Gregory VII culminated in the excommunication of the king in 1076, Otto attempted to mediate between Henry and the Saxon nobles convened at Trebur, but when these efforts failed he again joined the insurgents. Otto was not the leader of the Great Saxon Revolt, however. Once he was assured that the duchy of Bavaria would be returned to him, Otto accepted the election of Rudolf of Rheinfelden as antiking of Germany. Through his skill and bravery, Otto still inflicted defeats on Henry's forces at the battles of Mellrichstadt, Flarchheim and Hohenmölsen.\n\nOtto remained in arms against the king until his death on 11 January 1083. He is buried in the Nicolai Chapel in Northeim. His personal estates in Saxony later passed to Lothair of Supplinburg, who about 1100 married Otto's granddaughter Richenza of Northeim. After Richenza, German queen from 1125 and Holy Roman Empress from 1133, died in 1141, the allodial lands were inherited by her daughter Gertrude and her husband, the Welf duke Henry the Proud.\n\nOtto is described as a noble, prudent and warlike man, and he possessed great abilities. His repeated pardons showed that Henry could not afford to neglect such a powerful personality, and his military talents were repeatedly displayed.\n\nAbout 1055 Otto married Richenza, formerly reckoned as a daughter of Duke Otto II of Swabia, but probably a descendant of the Billung dynasty. The couple had four sons and three daughters. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "1801579", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1801579", "title": "The Cockettes", "text": "The Cockettes\n\nThe Cockettes were an avant garde psychedelic hippie theater group founded by Hibiscus (George Edgerly Harris III) in the fall of 1969. The troupe was formed out of a group of hippie artists, men and women, who were living in Kaliflower, one of the many communes in Haight-Ashbury, a neighborhood of San Francisco, California. Hibiscus came to live with them because of their preference for dressing outrageously and proposed the idea of putting their lifestyle on the stage.\n\nTheir brand of theater was influenced by The Living Theater, John Vaccaro's Play House of the Ridiculous, the films of Jack Smith and the LSD ethos of Ken Kesey's Merry Pranksters. The troupe performed all original material, staging musicals with original songs. The first year they parodied American musicals and sang show tunes (or original musical comedies in the same vein). They gained an underground cult following that led to mainstream exposure.\n\nThe Cockettes were the subject of a 2002 documentary titled \"The Cockettes\" and directed by David Weissman and Bill Weber.\n\nAt the Pagoda Palace Theatre in San Francisco's North Beach neighborhood, impresario Sebastian (real name Milton Miron) let the Cockettes perform as part of his Nocturnal Dream Show, a showcase of underground films, in exchange for free admission. The posters for these performances were designed by Todd Trexler. The Futurama Costume Gala, a science-fiction themed New Year's Eve bash held by the Nocturnal Dream Show creators, drew a rowdy audience of around 600 people. The show soon became a \"must-see\" for San Francisco's hip community. Combining LSD-influenced dancing, set design, costumes and their own versions of show tunes (or original tunes in the same vein), the Cockettes took to the stage every month, performing prior to the Saturday midnight Nocturnal Dream Show. Show titles included \"Gone With the Showboat to Oklahoma\", \"Tinsel Tarts In A Hot Coma\", \"Journey to the Center of Uranus\", \"Smacky & Our Gang\", \"Hollywood Babylon\" and \"Pearls Over Shanghai\".\n\nWord of these shows quickly got out, and by September 1971, the Cockettes gained a reputation as pioneers of San Francisco's counterculture. After local press coverage and sightings of celebrities like fashion designer and socialite Gloria Vanderbilt and author Truman Capote, the Cockettes gained attention from culture and lifestyle publications such as Rolling Stone and Esquire and general interest magazines such as Look and Life.\n\nIn 1971, The Cockettes released the short film \"Tricia's Wedding\", lampooning the wedding ceremony of Richard Nixon's daughter, Tricia Nixon; Nixon's chief of staff H. R. Haldeman arranged a secret screening of the film for White House staffers.\n\nThe Cockettes pioneered an eclectic style of dress and costume that had not been seen before. They drew inspiration from various sources such as silent film, Hollywood of the 1930s and 1940s, Broadway musicals and the art forms of surrealism and cubism. Using clothing and accessories from past eras found at flea markets and thrift shops, they incorporated these various disparate elements into a look that was unique and timeless, exploring their own personal fantasies by the use of the assemblage method, creating outfits that are now considered iconic within the Wearable Art movement. The Cockettes costumes were completed with the signature make up artistry, most famously the men having glitter in their beards and exaggerated eye make-up. On the stage their performances were initially ad hoc, unscripted and improvised, preferring an experimental and experiential approach to theatre where the outcome was unknown, reaching for a sense of Magic as a result. By their second year of performing on a monthly basis, scripts began to emerge, loosely based on certain themes with characters based on the personas of the individual players, including original songs and music. Their magnum opus was the three-act play Pearls Over Shanghai with story and lyrics by Link Martin and music by Scrumbly Koldwyn.\n\nDuring their first year the Cockettes were not paid for performances, although tickets to the shows sold for $2.00, the proceeds going to the theatre owner (during the first year the Cockettes sneaked many audience members into the theatre free through the back door). The reason for the lack of interest in payment was that the group, having come out of the Haight Ashbury hippie community, was not then focused on money. Later, when Cockette audiences began to include celebrities such as Truman Capote and members of European royal houses, the group insisted on payment. Even so, the amounts eventually paid were minimal.\n\nOnce Hibiscus had left the group some of the members saw the departure as an opportunity to capitalize on the media attention from articles in \"The Rolling Stone\" and Maureen Orth's pieces in \"The Village Voice\" as well as Rex Reed's nationally syndicated column. Whereas Hibiscus was dedicated to anarchy and breaking down boundaries others in the group saw the potential of the efforts and they even hired a theatre director. Hibiscus was explicitly political and committed to free performances as a part of the hippie ethos. At the same time Sylvester was being noted as a stand out act for his singing. He was getting funding from Gregg Gobel, the son of George Gobel, and had started to grow into an accomplished singer even hiring The Pointer Sisters as his back-up singers. With Hibiscus, the de facto leader of the group now gone, plans for a New York City show that could catapult the group to even greater fame were set into motion and tied to a double bill of the Cockettes and Sylvester's new band. Although rock-promoter Bill Graham passed on the opportunity for a New York show he did connect the group with Harry Zerler, \"a wealthy talent scout for Columbia Records\" and booked Sylvester as the opening act.\n\nNews of the 47 Cockettes boarding the flight was covered by local television and the group took over the plane in full drag. Once in New York they were housed in a dingy hotel where heroin was easily scored but spent most of their time as celebrated guests at dozens of parties where they could eat and drink for free, running a tab at a local diner and getting free taxicab rides. Sylvester knew the Cockettes were not going to do well but he was determined to make his debut as a rock star and practiced with his band every day. The Cockettes were still transitioning from being \"a happening\" to actually doing structured performances. The group had one week to prepare but they had few resources and little energy after all the parties. They were however the talk of town and their show was the hot ticket.\n\nIn November 1971 the Cockettes who had not left to become the Angels of Light, were booked for performances at the Anderson Theater in New York City. The venue had no sound or lighting systems and needed a curtain. The stage was also twice the size of the Cockettess' usual one so all the sets had to be rebuilt from scratch in six days. They opened with \"Tinsel Tarts In a Hot Coma\", a send-up of films about Broadway in the 1930s. According to accounts of the time, \"Everybody who was anybody\" came to the Cockette's New York opening, including such celebrities as John Lennon and Yoko Ono, Liza Minnelli, Truman Capote, Gore Vidal, and Angela Lansbury. Also attending were Andy Warhol and his own infamous gender-bending drag performers Holly Woodlawn and Candy Darling. But with the Cockettes' loose San Francisco magic, the opening night was a disaster (New Yorkers expected a tightly performed show). And in the theatre things went from bad to worse when Angela Lansbury walked out on the show, soon followed by Andy Warhol and most of the rest of the audience. After the show Gore Vidal quipped, \"Having no talent is not enough.\" Apparently the New York professionals did not view the group as talented.\n\nWhat had seemed so fabulous in San Francisco did not translate well in New York City. Also, the group did not have enough time to rehearse, so their performances in New York were not their best. Of course, no one told New Yorkers that the Cockettes were rather anti-rehearsal. For the Cockettes, the idea was to have a blast onstage with the true spirit of Hollywood. For San Francisco, the Cockettes, in the late 1960s, were beautiful, funny, liberating, psychedelic messengers from the gods. For most New Yorkers, it was \"You've got to be kidding!,\" and the celebrities the Cockettes had so wanted to impress were not impressed. Later, the Cockettes tried to explain their New York failure by commenting \"the New York audiences did not understand us,\" (although it appeared perhaps New York had understood them). After a week of disastrous \"Tinsel Tarts...\" playing to empty houses, they performed their original musical \"Pearls Over Shanghai\" for the remaining 2 weeks of their contract, and the Village Voice gave it a rave. But it was too little too late. Sylvester and his band was the lone exception but he disassociated himself after several nights on advice from his business friends.\n\nAfter the New York run at the Anderson Theater, the Cockettes returned to San Francisco and performed Les Etoile Du Minuit, the final version of Pearls Over Shanghai, Journey to the Center of Uranus and their final show, Hot Greeks. Divine, star of films by noted filmmaker John Waters, joined the group in Journey to the Center of Uranus thus making her San Francisco debut. In that show Divine performed the Cockette song \"A Crab On Your Anus Means You're Loved\" while dressed as a big, red lobster.\n\nAfter the group disbanded in the spring of 1972, various Cockettes continued to perform, often as solo performers (John Rothermel, who was often cast in a lead role due to his excellent singing voice and knowledge of 1920s/1930s music, had a successful cabaret career in San Francisco), but more often as a group, although no longer billed as The Cockettes.\n\nIn the fall of 1972 Fayette Hauser, Tomata du Plenty, Link Martin, John Flowers and Sweet Pam moved to New York City to perform in underground theatre. They lived on the Bowery and performed at the Cafe Cino, The Bouwerie Lane Theatre in the Palm Casino Revue, Club 82 and CBGB's with other groups such as the Ramones and Blondie. Later a few Cockettes formed the group Paula Pucker and the Pioneers.\n\nIn 1975 Tomata du Plenty and Fayette Hauser moved to Los Angeles and continued to perform in small theatre venues like the Anti-Club and Al's bar.\n\nIn 1970 Tomata duPlenty, inspired by early Cockette shows, went on to create a spin-off group in Seattle, Washington called Ze Whiz Kidz. He also created the seminal L.A. electropunk band, the Screamers, and he was the lead singer. Du Plenty went on to play a Cockettes-inspired lead role in the punk rock musical \"\".\n\nFayette Hauser was the lead singer in the L.A.-based New Age band Interpol with Jeff McGregor and Chuck Ivey.\n\nSylvester's rendition of torch songs by the likes of Etta James, Shirley Bassey, Bessie Smith, Ethel Waters, Billie Holiday, Dinah Washington, and Lena Horne during his solo spots were always a highlight. After the demise of the Cockettes, Sylvester became one of the most prolific singers of the disco era.\n\nOther core members of the Cockettes were Link (aka Link Martin, aka Luther Cupp), Gary Cherry, Rumi Missabu, John Rothermel, Tahara (whose parents had been rodeo clowns), Goldie Glitters, \"Johnny Cockette\", Sweet Pam (aka Pam Tent), Martin Worman, Scrumbly Koldewyn (who wrote tunes to Link's Martin's lyrics), Fayette Hauser, Daniel Ware, Dusty Dawn, Linden, Brent Jensen, Pristine Condition (aka Keith Blanton), Reggie (aka Anton Dunigan), Miss Harlow (who had been an original Plaster Caster) and Kreemah Ritz (originally known as Big Daryl) and Chris Kilo who produced a few of the early shows after the Angels/Cockette split. Many other people too numerous to mention performed in only one or two shows.\n\nIn its history numerous performers and performing groups have spun off from the Cockettes, including, among others, the Seattle Ze Whiz Kidz (including actors Tomato Du Plenty and Screaming Orchids; the first Whiz Kidz show was a musical based on the life of Yma Súmac), The San Francisco Angels of Light, The New York Angels of Light and The Assorted Nuts. Many Cockettes also continue to perform in the theatre world today.\n\nA 2009 revival of \"Pearls Over Shanghai\" (the libretto was originally written by Link Martin) in San Francisco included the participation of Rumi Missabu and piano accompaniment by composer Scrumbly Koldewyn, with Tahara one of the costume collaborators.\n\nOn December 3, 2009 several members of the Cockettes (Fayette Hauser, Scrumbly Koldewyn, Rumi Missabu, Sweet Pam, Tahara) came together at SFMOMA for a rare screening of the films \"Tricia's Wedding\", \"Palace\", and \"Elevator Girls in Bondage\" followed by discussions and memorable Cockettes moments. There was an afterparty at the Cafe du Nord on Market Street near Noe Street at which the Cockettes-inspired New York drag troupe the Dixie Chicks performed.\n\nThe Cockettes were the subject of a 2002 documentary, \"The Cockettes\", directed by Bill Weber and David Weissman. The film debuted at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival. It went on to a limited theatrical release and to play the film festival circuit. At the premiere at San Francisco's Castro Theatre many of the surviving Cockettes attended in genderfuck drag. \"The Cockettes\" received the LA Film Critics Award as Best Non-Fiction Film of 2002 and the Glitter Award for Best Documentary of 2003.\n\nIn early 1971 a few members of the original group broke away from the Cockettes and formed their own theatre group, The Angels of Light. The Angels became a well-known and highly creative San Francisco theatre group during the 1970s. Angels performances were free, with no admission charge. The Angels lifestyle included communal living in an old three-story Victorian house in San Francisco on the north side of Haight Street just west of Divisadero Street. Within the Angel commune house meetings were held every morning, all personal money was pooled into a communal treasury, meals were bought and eaten communally, and a form of complex marriage where each member was married to each other member evolved (all sexual preferences included). During the early 1970s, Martin Wong involved himself with The Angels of Light by designing sets and painting scenery for their performances.\n\nIn 1972 Hibiscus, the founder of the Cockettes and of the Angels of Light, left the Angels and moved back to New York City. There he formed his own group also known as the Angels of Light. The troupe included his parents and five siblings all actors and musicians as well as performers from all walks of life. In 1978, Hibiscus started doing more organized shows, including the fairly popular off-off-Broadway show, \"Sky High\" (performing under the name of Brian O'Hara). In the early 1980s, Hibiscus formed the glitter rock band \"Hibiscus and the Screaming Violets\" . A five piece band included his brother Fred as an arranger, keyboardist, his mother Ann wrote all of the original lyrics and music collaborating with her son Fred on a few tunes. Hibiscus's sisters Jayne Anne, Eloise and Mary Lou were The Screaming Violets. They played in many of the clubs of the era. Lewis Friedman's SNAFU was their artistic home. On May 6, 1982 Hibiscus died of AIDS in New York City (supposedly the 224th person to die in that epidemic).\n\nJack Coe (aka Angel Jack) was another renowned member of the Angels of Light. He was seen later on as a regular performer at Studio 54 in NYC. In the 1990s, he moved to his mother's home in Gulf Port, Florida. to help care for her. While in Florida, he would make random appearances and do occasional solo performances throughout the club circuit. In his final years, he befriended multi-media performance artist Mikee Plastik, whom he did his final work with (costume design and photo shoot). Coe died of an AIDS related illness in 2001 in St. Petersburg, Florida. at St. Anthony's Hospital (the same hospital where famed beat poet Jack Kerouac died). Several books and documentaries about Studio 54 and its legendary scene have featured and paid homage to Angel Jack.\n\nIn 1977 the Angels of Light San Francisco commune disbanded, although the group continued to perform until 1980. At present many of the male members of the Angels of Light have died of AIDS, while other members, still living, have moved on and currently live all over the world.\n\nIn 1978, John Rothermel (who had had a successful solo cabaret career in San Francisco, after leaving The Cockettes) moved to New York, after a year-long stopover in his home town of Minneapolis, Minnesota. He had always been a junk shop shopper and had become a collector of Art Deco while still in San Francisco. Later in New York, he became an early collector of Mid-Century Modern/post-WWII furniture and decorative arts. After he initially worked in New York as stage manager for Hibiscus' most successful New York off-off Broadway show \"Sky High\", he developed into one of the most knowledgeable collectors of Mid-Century Modern. He worked at the Greenwich Auction Room, and independently bought and sold furniture and decorative arts before dying of AIDS on April 21, 1994. (Among his most important finds was a 20\" high wood and metal model designed by William Lescaze as one of the finalists for the New York Museum of Modern Art building. Certainly worth $10,000.00 or more, John's mother, Della, donated it to the MOMA after John died.)\n\nAnother interesting member was Frank Bourquin, using the name Inez Paloma. Frank was John Rothermel's roommate on Market Street. Frank was deeply into 1920's history and was friends with a bunch of Palo Alto record collectors centered around Ed Linotti, who was director of the Stanford University music archives. Frank was working at the Post Office, but developed an ulcer and left on disability. He was featured in a number of the post-Hibiscus shows; one where he sang \"Happy-Go-Lucky You (and Broken-Hearted Me)\", a tune from 1932. Apparently, he later moved from San Francisco to Petaluma and was driving a cab, and died in the late 1980s.\n\nThe Cockettes inspired a Brazilian drag troupe \"Dzi Croquettes,\" which are the subject of a 2009 documentary film \"Dzi Croquettes\".\n\nhttp://www.the-other.info/2016/the-cockettes-interview-with-fayette-hauser-by-sophie-pinchetti\n\n\n"}

It is from . The station is managed by Southern who operate the majority of train services with a few peak services operated by Thameslink.\n\nA relatively busy interchange station and terminus, all rail services are provided by Southern. The station is the busiest suburban station on the line and is a terminus for some services on the Uckfield branch of the Oxted Line. Trains depart to London Victoria via Clapham Junction, London Bridge via East Croydon station, East Grinstead and Uckfield in East Sussex.\n\nOxted was built as a joint London, Brighton and South Coast Railway/South Eastern Railway station when the South Croydon to East Grinstead line opened on 10 March 1884. The three platforms are connected by a subway which runs under the track. In addition, a lift is provided for entry to Platforms 2/3. There are tunnels at each end of the station:\n\nIn 1951 the station had a train every thirteen minutes of the day, services running to Victoria and London Bridge in the up direction and to Tunbridge Wells, Eastbourne and Brighton in the down. Locomotives using the station on an average weekday would be of the following classes: BR4 2-6-4T (14), C2X 0-6-0 (2), H 0-4-4T (12), L 4-4-0 (1), LM2 2-6-2T (5), LM4 2-6-4T (38), N 2-6-0 (2), Q 0-6-0 (8), U 2-6-0 (1) and U1 2-6-0 (2). In addition, diesel 10800 was a regular visitor to the station four times a day between 1952 and 1954.\n\nThe station was the scene of a bomb attempt by suffragette sympathisers in 1913 – Harold Laski (later a professor at the London School of Economics and chairman of the Labour Party) and a friend placed the device in the men's toilets. Although it did detonate the damage was limited as the fuse failed to ignite the petrol contained in the device. A similar device (containing some pieces of metal and a watch in addition to the explosive charge) was planted at the Bank of England on 13 April 1913, which was successfully defused.\n\nOn the London-bound platform is a manned ticket office (staffed daily till late) and two standard \"quick-pay\" self-service passenger-operated ticket machines in Southern branding are located outside the station on the London-bound side and at the entrance to the underpass on Platforms 2 and 3 side (Uckfield/East Grinstead bound.) The station is staffed 17 hours a day. The station accommodates a cafe, refurbished toilets, two waiting rooms and a line control centre in a large concourse.\n\nAll of the platforms are linked by a subway which also links the two main streets in Oxted together as well as the local supermarket and the town's leisure complex.\n\nThere is an underground car park located under the adjacent supermarket.\n\nThe station acts as a terminus for the Uckfield branch of the Oxted Line and trains use platform three on a regular basis after termination for both train maintenance and cleaning. The present signal box opened in the 1980s and covered control of the Uckfield line in January 1990. It replaced the previous original wooden structure located at the end of platform 2/3\n\nThe station was also the first station and terminus on the Southern network to receive two fully DDA-compliant ticket windows which will move down to accommodate easy use by wheelchair users. The station is also linked to the Southern Control Centre in Croydon, by two help points (one on each platform) where passengers can receive help 24 hours a day externally.\n\nIn 2010 the station was refurbished a new lift installed, followed by a deep clean and internal rezoning.\n\nIn May 2010, Platform 1 and 2 were lengthened by Balfour Beatty to take 12 car trains.\n\nDuring January 2011, Southern installed ticket gates on the main concourse as well as the exit and indoor area in between platforms 2 and 3. Gate-line staff operate at the station also.\n\nSouthern operate all off-peak services at Oxted. The current off-peak service at the station in trains per hour is:\n\nDuring the Monday-Friday peak hours there are also additional Thameslink services to and via London Bridge.\n\nOn Sundays, services on the Uckfield Line start/terminate at Oxted.\n\nLocal bus services are provided by Southdown PSV, Metrobus and occasionally London General on the behalf of Surrey County Council. The nearest bus stops are adjacent to the London Bound Platforms and near to the subway on Station Road East.

It was constructed in 1792 and had several notable owners before being purchased by L. Ron Hubbard and becoming the British headquarters of the Church of Scientology.\n\nSaint Hill Manor was built by Gibbs Crawfurd in 1792, situated on 59 acres (239,000 m²) of landscaped gardens overlooking the hills of the High Weald. A number of archeological artefacts in the immediate area have been attributed to the existence of a small priory or early 17th-century dwelling on the site. The original name, Sinta Hill, is thought to have come from the local Roman occupation and later Medieval iron-workings found throughout the area. \n\nSubsequent owners included Edgar March Crookshank and Mrs. Drexel Biddle, who commissioned the famous Monkey Mural which was painted by John Spencer-Churchill, nephew of Sir Winston Churchill. It was once owned by William Thomas Berger and in the late 1800s served as the headquarters of the China Inland Mission. Hudson Taylor and Berger met there often and it was a centre for training recruits for the mission field.\n\nSaint Hill Manor has been Grade II listed on the National Heritage List for England since August 1972.\n\nL. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology, bought the mansion from Sawai Man Singh, the Maharajah of Jaipur, in 1959 after meeting at a casino in London. The Maharaja needed to settle his gambling debts. Hubbard claimed in a subsequent lecture that he purchased the property for £58,000. He lived there with his family until early 1966 before moving abroad.\n\nUnder Hubbard's ownership, the manor was extensively modified, with a series of extensions and new buildings constructed on the estate during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s to accommodate the training facilities and attendant administration functions. The largest is a mock-Norman castle built adjacent to the main manor house after 1968 to provide a purpose-built training facility for Scientology students. The East Grinstead Urban District Council initially refused planning permission. After a public enquiry, however, the Church of Scientology was granted permission to go ahead with the construction of \"Saint Hill Castle\".\n\nSaint Hill Manor served as Hubbard’s organization’s headquarters until the year 1967 after its acquisition in 1959. It was inaugurated in 1955 and was the site where Hubbard “announced Scientology milestones emerging from his research.” It was also the site of the church’s first Distribution Center, which was operative for the church’s missionary outreach.\n\nThe Church of Scientology’s renovations on the Saint Hill Manor were completed in the summer of 2015 and are reported to have cost a total of US$16 million. The church claims that they are preserving it as a “historic monument.” Chairman of the Board of RTC David Miscavige and Scientologist actor Tom Cruise donated $10,000 to cover the local rugby team’s costs and invited team director Phil Major to an annual gala when their activities were disrupted for six months because of the renovations. Saint Hill Manor is now a museum that features the works and accomplishments of L. Ron Hubbard.\n\nFollowing the completion of the renovations, the Church of Scientology purchased seven brand new 29-seater ADL Enviro200 midibuses to transport the 400 staff members between the manor and the town of Crowborough, fourteen miles away.\n\n"}

The station is managed by Southern.\n\nThe station adjoins Lingfield Park Racecourse.\n\nThe opening of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway's (LBSCR) Oxted Line in 1884 brought the railway to the small agricultural parish of Lingfield which, like its neighbour Dormansland, had been earmarked for residential development. The area was also to be the location of a new racecourse which was to open in 1890. Lingfield originally had only limited facilities to accommodate passengers and freight, and struggled to deal with the crowds which attended the race meetings. A goods shed and loading dock were added in May 1884, and in 1894 the down platform became an island and the loading dock was extended to become a departure platform for race specials. The LBSCR obtained authorisation to construct a line directly to the racecourse in 1898, but these plans never materialised.\n\nGoods traffic was at a peak during the interwar period, when the sidings saw a variety of interesting traffic. Horseboxes and cattle wagons were numerous, and during the war, it was a stabling point for an emergency tank train. A large banana ripening shed was opened in the late 1950s and this received supplies direct from Avonmouth Docks. This closed on 1 October 1971 as bananas were now containerised and transported by road. Race traffic has also decreased and the track layout was progressively simplified, leaving the remaining traffic to be dealt with by strengthening ordinary services. Further modifications were carried out in 1972 when the station was \"modernised\" by demolishing the goods shed and removing the down platform canopy. However, the main buildings, together with the adjoining stationmaster's house, have survived as good examples of an LBSCR country station.\n\nThe typical off-peak service is:\n\n\nAt peak times, there are several Thameslink operated services to Bedford via London Bridge.\n"}

He was a player with home run power and a tendency to strike out. He was nicknamed \"Bye Bye\" because of his home run hitting prowess. He was also known by the nickname \"Bones\", which is a malapropism for Balboni.\n\nBorn in Brockton, Massachusetts, Balboni attended Manchester Memorial High School in Manchester, New Hampshire and Eckerd College in St. Petersburg, Florida. In 1976 and 1977, he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL) for the Falmouth Commodores (1976) and the Yarmouth-Dennis Red Sox (1977). In 1977, he led the CCBL in home runs (13), was named league MVP, and was also the MVP of the league all-star game at Fenway Park. In 2006, he was inducted into the CCBL Hall of Fame.\n\nHe was drafted by the New York Yankees in the second round of the free agent draft in 1978. The Yankees noted that Balboni's tremendous power helped them make the decision to draft him. He was named designated hitter on \"The Sporting News\" college All-America team in 1978.\n\nBalboni played in the minors off and on from to . In a total of nine seasons in the minors, he hit 239 home runs and drove in 772 runs. He also struck out 930 times. His career minor league batting average was .261. He won the Most Valuable Player award in 1979 with the Fort Lauderdale Yankees of the Florida State League and the Southern League MVP Award in 1980 for the Double-A Nashville Sounds.\n\nBalboni led the league in home runs six different seasons, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1992 and 1993. He led the league in Runs Batted In in 4 seasons, 1979, 1980, 1981 and 1992. He led the league in strikeouts in 2 seasons, 1979 and 1981. He homered every 14.6 at bats and struck out every 3.8 at bats in the Minors.\n\nBalboni made it to the New York Yankees in 1981. He went on to play in the big leagues through 1990 with a short comeback in 1993. He played for the Yankees from to and then in and . He was the starting first baseman for the Kansas City Royals from to mid-, when they traded him to the Seattle Mariners. He only played in Seattle until the end of that season.\n\nIn parts of 11 Major League seasons, Steve hit 181 home runs and had 495 RBI. He also struck out 856 times. His batting average was .229 (714-for-3120). In 1985, he led the American League with 166 strikeouts. He also set the single season home run mark for the Royals with 36. That record stood until Mike Moustakas surpassed it in 2017. He homered every 17.2 at bats and struck out every 3.6 at bats in the Major Leagues.\n\nThe year turned out to be his best season for many reasons. He had career highs in games played (160), at bats (600), hits (146), runs (74), doubles (28), triples (2), homers (36) and runs batted in (88-tied in 1986). He led American League first basemen with 1686 total chances and 1573 putouts in 1985. He also was the starting first baseman in the 1985 World Series. Steve batted .320 with 3 RBIs in that Series that the Royals won over the St. Louis Cardinals, four games to three. Balboni contributed a key single in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 6, as the Royals rallied from a 1-0 deficit to win 2-1, and extend the series to seven games. He also demonstrated good glove work in the field, something he was not known for during his career. After retiring, he moved on to another team known as the Royals – The Flor-Mad Royals of Madison, New Jersey.\n\nBalboni has been a resident of Berkeley Heights, New Jersey. He was elected to the International League Hall of Fame in 2011.\n\nThis alleged curse was first proposed by ESPN.com columnist Rany Jazayerli. Ostensibly, it ensured that no team with a player who hit more regular-season home runs than Balboni had in 1985 could win the World Series. In 1985, when Balboni hit a team-record 36 home runs (which stood until September 2017) and the Royals won their first championship, it had been only five years since the feat was last accomplished: Mike Schmidt hit 48 for the 1980 champion Philadelphia Phillies. The feat was not repeated, however, in the 20th century. In 2001, the Arizona Diamondbacks broke the curse, winning the World Series with an outfielder, Luis Gonzalez, who had hit 57 home runs in the regular season. Since then, the feat has been accomplished numerous times:\n\nBalboni was the subject of a running joke on Episode 7 of the web series \"Back on Topps\". In this episode, Ed Helms plays his younger brother.\n\n"}
{"id": "1801631", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1801631", "title": "Esna", "text": "Esna\n\nEsna (  , or ; \"Snē\" from \"tꜣ-snt\"; \"Latópolis\" or (\"Pólis Látōn\") or (\"Lattōn\"); Latin: \"Lato\"), is a city of Egypt. It is located on the west bank of the Nile some 55 km south of Luxor. The town was formerly part of the modern Qena Governorate, but as of 9/12/2009, it was incorporated into the new Luxor Governorate.\n\nThis city of Latopolis (πόλις Λάτων) in the Thebaid of Upper Egypt should not be confused with the more northerly city of Letopolis (Λητοῦς Πόλις), ancient Khem, modern Ausim, in the Nile Delta in Lower Egypt.\n\nThe name \"Latopolis\" is in honor of the Nile perch, \"Lates niloticus\", the largest of the 52 species which inhabit the Nile, which was abundant in these stretches of the river in ancient times, and which appears in sculptures, among the symbols of the goddess Neith, associated by the ancient Greeks as Pallas-Athene, surrounded by the oval shield or ring indicative of royalty or divinity. Held sacred, the \"Lates niloticus\" was buried in a cemetery west of the town.\n\nThe temple of Esna, dedicated to the god Khnum, his consorts Menhit and Nebtu, their son, Heka, and the goddess Neith, was remarkable for the beauty of its site and the magnificence of its architecture. It was built of red sandstone, and its portico consisted of six rows of four columns each, with lotus-leaf capitals, all of which however differ from each other. The temple contains very late hieroglyphic inscription, dating from the reign of Decius (249–251 AD).\n\nAnother temple of the same period has been identified at Kom Mer, about 12 km to the south, but cannot be excavated because a modern village is built over it.\n\nThere was a smaller temple, dedicated to the triad of Latopolis, about two miles and a half north of the city, at a village now called el-Dayr. Here, too, is a small zodiac of the age of Ptolemy III Euergetes (246–221 BC). This latter building was destroyed in the 19th century, as it stood in the way of a new canal. The temple of Esna was cleared of the soil and rubbish which filled its area when Vivant Denon visited it, and served as a cotton warehouse in the mid-19th century.\n\nWith the exception of the jamb of a gateway—now converted into a door-sill—of the reign of Thutmose II (Eighteenth Dynasty), the remains of Latopolis belong to the Ptolemaic or Roman eras. Ptolemy III Euergetes, the restorer of so many temples in Upper Egypt, was a benefactor to Latopolis, and he is depicted upon the walls of its temple followed by a tame lion, and in the act of striking down the chiefs of his enemies. The name of Ptolemy V Epiphanes is found also inscribed upon a doorway. Although the scale of the ruins are impressive, their sculptures and hieroglyphics attest to the decline of Egyptian art. The west wall features reliefs of Ptolemy VI Philometor and Ptolemy VIII Physcon. The pronaos, which alone exists, resembles in style that of Apollonopolis Magna (Edfu), and was begun not earlier than the reign of Claudius (41–54 AD), and completed in that of Vespasian, whose name and titles are carved on the dedicatory inscription over the entrance. On the ceiling of the pronaos is the larger Latopolitan Zodiac. The name of the emperor Geta, the last ruler that can be read in hieroglyphics, although partially erased by his brother and murderer Caracalla (212), is still legible on the walls of Latopolis. Before raising their own edifice, the Romans seem to have destroyed even the basements of the earlier Egyptian temple. The ceremonial way, which probably linked the quay to the temple, has disappeared. The quay bears cartouches of Marcus Aurelius.\n\nThe cemetery west of the town, where the \"Lates niloticus\" was buried, also contains human burials dating of the Middle Kingdom to the Late Period.\n\nThe Temple of Esna conveys a sense of the importance which the Ancient Egyptians placed upon their places of worship. All Egyptians who entered the confines of an Egyptian temple were required \"to comply with the strict rules regarding ritual purity.\" According to inscriptions carved on the walls of the Temple of Esna, those who entered this temple were expected to fastidiously cut their fingernails and toenails, remove other body hair, wash their hands with natron (a natural occurring salt), \"be dressed in linen (they were forbidden from wearing wool), and not to have had sexual intercourse for several days.\"\n\nMedieval Heritage City \n\nEsna enjoys a rich intangible heritage in terms of its unique social structure where the city center is subdivided into spatial domains inhabited by deeply-rooted Esna families, and its traditional crafts – all on the verge of extinction as a life heritage extended since the medieval eras.\nforms of this life heritage is the presence other monuments and buildings of historic significance in Esna from various eras like Wekalet El Geddawy a caravanserai from the ottoman era, was established in the 18th century by the Ottoman Ruler by Hassan El-Geddawy (Ruler of Geddah -KSA) and it was named after him, it represents one of three caravanserais in south of Egypt, and it is the only one that still maintains its unique original design. \nThe Wekala was one of the most important trade centers in South of Egypt in the 18th century with traders from all over Africa coming through the west desert and the red sea, and It now stands as a testament to the strength of trade and the strategic position of Esna as a trade center in the south of Egypt at the time. The building was historically used for the sale of slaves, animals, crops and crafts.\nThe historic market is one of a few still standing markets in the south of Egypt and gets its significance from being a local historic market that portrays Esna’s authentic local life. Products sold in the market include home supplies, local crafts and bridal needs.\nEl-Amry Minaret is the only remaining part of the historic mosque with the same name which was torn down and rebuilt in the 1960s in a modern style. \nThe Mosque was established between the years 474 & 476 AD on the Islamic Calendar by Badr El Deen Gamaly and it was the first to be built in Esna in the Fatimid Era. The oil press has belonged to the family of Bakour for over 200 years and it is the only still standing oil press in Esna. Martyrs’ Monastery It was established in the 6th century. \nThe Monastery is of a great significance for Christians since it was established in the age of Christine persecution in Egypt by Saint Helena after a battle between the romans and Coptic Egyptians which lead to the death of 3600 Martyrs.\nThe monastery is visited by thousands of Egyptians from all over the country every year due to its significant value. \n\nTwo barrage bridges straddle the Nile at this point: one built by the British in 1906, and the \"Electricity Bridge\" built in the 1990s. Navigation, particularly, Nile cruisers ferrying tourists from Luxor to Aswan 155 km further upstream, can be held up for hours while vessels negotiate their way through the lock system.\n\nThe two main points of interest in Esna are its lively tourist-oriented market, which fills a couple of streets leading inland from the corniche. The other is the temple of Esna. The temple, which has only been partially excavated, is about 200 meters from the river and some 9 meters below street level.\n\nAttackers on a patrol killed a policeman and a civilian, and wounded three other victims.\n\nUnder the older name of \"Latopolis,\" the city is now a Roman Catholic Latin titular see.\n\nKöppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as hot desert climate (BWh).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1801647", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1801647", "title": "East Grinstead railway station", "text": "East Grinstead railway station\n\nEast Grinstead railway station is one of the two southern termini of the Oxted line in the south of England and serves East Grinstead in West Sussex. It is from , although off peak trains run to and from . The station is managed by Southern.\n\nThe station was formerly divided into two levels: the higher level platforms serving the Three Bridges to Tunbridge Wells Central Line, whilst the lower level platforms received services from the Oxted line and the East Grinstead to Lewes Line.\n\nOnly the lower level platforms remain open today, the high level having closed in 1967 with the Three Bridges to Ashurst Junction line as part of the closure programme proposed by the Beeching Report. A third low-level platform has been constructed at the south of the station by the Bluebell Railway. Bluebell services began running south to Sheffield Park in 2013.\n\nThe current East Grinstead station is the fourth to have been constructed in the town. Prior to the arrival of the railway, the nearest stations were away at on the South Eastern Railway's Redhill to Tonbridge line and at on the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway's Brighton line.\n\nThe first station to serve East Grinstead was built by the East Grinstead Railway as the terminus of its single-track line from . It was opened on 9 July 1855 in Swan Mead off the London Road, well-situated for the town centre, with the first train out at 12:12 pm. Constructed at a cost of £3,000, the station comprised a sandstone main building which survives to this day, as well as timber goods and engine sheds with slate roofs. The goods facilities were described in a specification as being equal to those at Hailsham railway station. There were probably two platform faces and the goods yard was on the up side. The first stationmaster was a Peter Nesbitt; he remained in post until his death on 10 September 1864. The initial passenger service consisted of six trains each way daily and two on Sundays; trains started and finished at East Grinstead. The service appears to have exceeded expectations as the service increased to nine each way on weekdays, with three on Sundays. So well-patronised were the Sunday services that Reverend Woodington, the curate of East Grinstead, regularly visited the station to distribute religious tracts requesting passengers to \"listen to the church bells instead of the railway bells.\"\n\nThe journey time to Three Bridges was 20 minutes and the first train departed at 6:55 am for arrival in London at 9:15 am after a 43-minute wait at Three Bridges for a connecting service via the Brighton main line. The fastest time to London was 1¼ hours achieved by the 4:00 pm down train which was first-class only. As from September 1855, an additional mid-afternoon train was provided each way. This was increased to nine each way by 1862. The rail fare from East Grinstead to London was 6s first class and 3s third class. The line was operated from its outset by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway for an annual rental of £2,000 until January 1865, when it purchased the East Grinstead Railway.\n\nIn August 1862 parliamentary approval was obtained for the extension of the line to via , with the new line forming an end-on junction with the Three Bridges line at East Grinstead. The extension required East Grinstead station to be relocated a few yards north at a lower level in a cutting immediately to the west of the London Road at in order to allow the line to pass under the highway. It was reached by steps from the road by the bridge. During construction, the Surveyor of Highways of the Parish of East Grinstead complained to the Board of Trade that the station approaches were \"inconvenient and dangerous\" and that the road entrance for carriages was situated on the narrow bridge over the line. Whilst the Board of Trade agreed that the layout was not ideal, it did not order any alterations save for the carriage access to the booking hall which it felt was cramped and should be modified \"as soon as there are any complaints of horses [which brought carriages to the station] being frightened by the steam and smoke of the locomotives which will come through the present opening between the overbridge and the station.\"\n\nThe station building straddled the double track with basements at platform level which contained the stationmaster's office and porter's room. A large brick goods shed replaced the previous timber structure, whilst the site of the old station became a goods yard. The new station was opened for traffic on 1 October 1866, and the old one closed the same day. The initial passenger service was poor, with only six trains each way and the withdrawal of three East Grinstead to Three Bridges services. Journey time to Tunbridge Wells was just under an hour. In 1869 annual season tickets to London were £32 first class and £24 second class, while returns were 9s 6d first, 7s 6d second and 4s 8d third.\n\nA third re-modelling of East Grinstead station was made necessary by the arrival in the town of two lines: the Lewes and East Grinstead Railway (L&EG) from the south on 1 August 1882, followed by the Croydon, Oxted and East Grinstead Railway (CO&EG) from the north on 10 March 1884. The L&EG would approach the Three Bridges line from the south at a right-angle and the CO&EG would make an end-on junction with it. It was not possible to enlarge the 1866 station to accommodate the new lines and arrange the new station in the form of a or as this would have meant purchasing the adjoining timber yard, which the LB&SCR was not prepared to do. It was therefore decided to build a new station around to the west which would be arranged on two levels. The main buildings were on the low level platform.\nThe low level station was set at a right-angle to the high level and it had two platforms to serve the L&EG and CO&EG. From the L&EG's opening on 1 August 1882 until 14 October 1883, services continued to use the 1866 station as the new station was still in construction and because residents found the older station more convenient for the town centre. On 15 October 1883 both high and low level stations opened and the 1866 station was closed. The old station was later demolished in February 1908 and sold for scrap for £15. The bridge over the London Road was demolished in 1978 with the construction of the Inner Relief Road. The CO&EG opened for traffic on 10 March 1884 with a service of four trains each way between and via , plus four South Eastern services each way between London Bridge and Oxted. The new line to London was shorter than the route via Three Bridges but some passengers continued to use the old line for the fast services from Three Bridges.\n\nThe main station building was built in the architectural style of other stations on the L&EG: an upper timber storey with plaster infill which was later covered with hung tiles with impressed flower patterns. The architect was Thomas Myres, the inspiration behind what was termed the Queen Anne School, who prepared the design of the other stations on the L&EG, as well as those on the Chichester to Midhurst and Eridge to Polegate branches. It was a substantial structure with refreshment rooms on both levels, with that on the low level said to house a billiards room for travellers. Only passengers with valid tickets and railway staff had access to the rooms, which were licensed to sell alcohol and managed by the former owner of East Grinstead's Crown Hotel. The East Grinstead Parish Magazine complained of the distance from the new stations to the town and hoped that new roads would be built to connect it and the approaches improved. An 1885 publication about East Grinstead described the station as \"very commodious and convenient\" and \"a pleasing object\" with \"embankments on the outside planted with shrubs and flowers\".\nIt is thought that an engine shed was provided upon the opening of the L&EG, given that as the first train of the day started at East Grinstead and the last train terminated there, there would have been a need to house the engine. However, the exact date of the shed's opening is unknown. Records show that LB&SCR D1 class No. 233 Handcross was allocated to East Grinstead shed when new in March 1883. The shed closed at the end of 1894; there were by now sheds at Three Bridges and Tunbridge Wells West. However, station plans from 1910 show that the water tank, water column and engine pit still remained. The station had north and south signal boxes; the north box was occasionally used to operate a crossover to the north but operation was transferred to the south box in the 1920s which was operational until 17 July 1987. The box has since been demolished and the line is worked from the Oxted signalling panel.\n\nFrom 1955, the low level station fell into virtual disuse with most passengers using the high level station. The L&EG closed on 16 March 1958 and for a short time afterwards a faster service to Brighton via Three Bridges ran which reached the coastal town in 45 minutes after leaving East Grinstead. The last train on the L&EG ran on 16 March 1958 after which very few trains used the down platform and none departed from the up. The Oxted line timetable was revised as from 6 January 1964 so that, with a few exceptions, the regular services from Victoria terminated at the low-level platforms. After the closure of the Three Bridges-Ashurst Junction line on 2 January 1967, all London trains used the low level with the up platform used for services during busy periods, leaving the down platform to deal with both arrivals and departures.\n\nDemolition works on the 1882 building started in February 1970 and were complete by November 1971; the replacement single-storey prefabricated CLASP structure opened in 1972 immediately south of the old building. Contractors for the demolition and reconstruction were J. Longley of Crawley. The smaller modern construction which reflected the station's new status as the terminus of a branch line from Oxted. Several fittings from the old station, including cast-iron pillars and brackets, valancing, gas lamps, nameboards and coloured glass, were sold to a Californian restaurant owner, Robert Freeman. The sidings in the low level goods yard remained until their removal in 1987. Following the closure of the high level station, the \"Low Level\" suffix was no longer used. A concrete footbridge was erected in 1970 to link the two platforms as the demolition of the high level station had removed the means of access to the up platform. The Oxted line was electrified following works between May 1986 and October 1987 and the track layout in the station was modified. The platforms were also lengthened to take eight-car trains.\n\nBy September 2012, a new station building costing £2.1 million had been erected next to the existing structure which was scheduled for demolition in March 2013 once the new building and expanded car park became fully operational. The works, which were completed as part of the Department for Transport’s National Station Improvement Programme, also included new platform waiting shelters, bicycle facilities, a new transport interchange on the site of the old building, platform lengthening to accommodate 12-car trains and the installation of a pre-fabricated single deck on the car park to increase capacity from 236 to 336 spaces. The existing station was considered no longer fit for purpose and in need of replacement. Although a grant had been applied for to cover the cost of installing a lift to Platform 1 for disabled access, this was refused by the Department for Transport on the basis that the cost would be disproportionate given the likely passenger numbers and the fact that only six trains a day would use the platform.\n\nThe station first opened on 17 December 2012, with the official opening taking place on 8 March 2013 in the presence of the East Grinstead Town Mayor, Liz Bennett, and the Mid Sussex MP, Nicholas Soames.\n\nThe station has a booking hall with a ticket office and ticket machine, a kiosk, toilets, car park, bicycle storage and a taxi rank.\n\nThe typical off-peak service is a half-hourly train to London Victoria (including Sundays). Services take around an hour to cover the distance, calling at all stations as far as then and . Additional trains are run during peak periods, including services to London Bridge, which additionally call at South Croydon, and then after calling at East Croydon call at Norwood Junction and then run fast to London Bridge.\n\nAt peak times, there are several direct services to Bedford via London Bridge. These are operated by Thameslink\n\nThroughout its railway history, East Grinstead has been almost exclusively served by local services to London, Brighton, Three Bridges and Tunbridge Wells. In the early days, around five or six trains a day on weekdays and two on Sundays were operated. The number of trains increased gradually as commuting developed from the 1890s, exception made for cutbacks as a result of the First World War. Starting in 1888 until the electrification of the Brighton main line in 1932, coaches for East Grinstead and were attached to the 5:05pm express from London Bridge to via Lewes and were slipped at to be routed via the Three Bridges to Tunbridge Wells line. A handful of through services between London and Brighton called at East Grinstead before running via , and Lewes. These were not fast services, taking 45 minutes to reach the coast in the 1930s. Through workings between East Grinstead, Three Bridges and London ceased upon electrification of the Brighton main line in 1932, leaving the line from Three Bridges to be worked as a separate section with push-pull trains.\n\nBy 1938, eight commuter services departed East Grinstead between 6:30am and 9:30am on weekdays, an increase of three when compared with 1923. Sunday services remained infrequent at no more than four each way on each of the lines serving the town. Electrification of the Oxted line as far as Horsted Keynes was considered by the Southern Railway in 1939 but the outbreak of the Second World War put an end to any plans. Fuel shortages and wartime needs in the early 1940s resulted in services being reduced to their lowest level in the 20th century with only 45 trains scheduled to leave the station on weekdays. Wide gaps developed between services with, for example, only one train in 1942 to Lewes between 9:37am and 3:00pm, one to Three Bridges between 9:23am and 1:52pm and one to Tunbridge Wells from 9:33am and 2:25pm. Services on the Oxted line were also cut back from eight to five daily morning commuter trains and from 20 to 15 trains daily. By 1952, services had still not reached their pre-war frequency with the exception of the London commuter service.\n\nIn 1955, the Oxted line timetable was recast to provide an hourly service outside the peaks, supported by an intricate system of connections between them. After the morning peak which saw eight services to and between 6:30am and 9:37am, a Victoria service ran at 25 minutes past each hour until 9:25pm, with an extra London Bridge service at 5:55pm carrying vans traffic. Sunday services were trebled to nine which ran at two-hourly intervals until 10:25pm. Similar provision was made for services from London with departures at eight minutes past the hour from Victoria, continuing from East Grinstead to Groombridge and Tunbridge Wells West. Services were also increased on the Three Bridges line to 19 on weekdays and 15 on Sundays. These additional services may have contributed to a 40% growth in East Grinstead's population between 1951 and 1961, when it rose to 15,448. One of the popular early morning commuter trains in the 1950s was the 7:08am service from Tunbridge Wells West to London Bridge via East Grinstead, while the 6:30pm London Bridge to Forest Row service, formed of seven coaches, was also well-patronised. After the publication of the Beeching Report in 1963 which saw the Three Bridges line fall into the category of routes with less than 10,000 passengers a week thereby rendering it susceptible to closure, a new timetable was introduced from 6 January 1964 which removed most of the off-peak direct London services in favour of a two-hourly service to Three Bridges.\n\nSmall tank engines were used to haul services until the 1870s when Stroudley D1s supplemented by B1 \"Gladstones\" were used after having been displaced from main-line duties. Heavier and more powerful engines were introduced after the First World War, including Billinton E4 and E5 classes, along with his D3 and B4 classes. Marsh's I3 class was mainly used on Tunbridge Wells-East Grinstead-London services, while his H1 and H2 \"Atlantics\" were seen on London-East Grinstead-Lewes services. The Southern Railway's neglect of its non-electrified secondary lines in the period leading up to the Second World War resulted in weight restrictions being introduced on the Tunbridge Wells and Lewes lines from which I3s were banned in favour of lighter I1X class locomotives to Tunbridge Wells and SECR B1s, F1s and D1s on the Lewes line. The restrictions were removed after the war when I3s returned with SR N and U1 classes, together with certain K classes. Larger express passenger engines began to appear including, in the mid 1950s, Schools class No. 30917 \"Ardingly\" for beginning and end of school term specials.\n\nIn the early 1950s, LMS Fairburn 2-6-4Ts were trialled on London commuter services and LMS Ivatt Class 2 2-6-2Ts for lighter Oxted line trains. In the last days of steam, BR 2-6-4Ts took up duties alongside the Fairburns until these were transferred to the London Midland Region. Dieselisation came in the early 1960s when Class 207 units were introduced on Oxted line services where they remained in operation for the next 43 years. On 18 June 1962, the first public diesel services started on the 7:41am East Grinstead to London Bridge service, with the return at 5:37pm; the formation was a 3-car set combined with a Hastings-type 6-car set. Steam working continued on the London services for a further twelve months, whilst the Three Bridges line was largely operated with M7 push-pull steam services. Push-pull working on the line ceased on 4 January 1964 just prior to the entry into force of a new timetable for the Oxted line from 6 January; the last push-pull service was hauled by H class No. 31263. Electrification reached East Grinstead in 1987 with the first services commencing on Monday 5 October.\n\nThe heritage Bluebell Railway reopened part of the L&EG from to just short of on 7 August 1960. Horsted Keynes was reached the next year and the site of was purchased in November 1975. A planning application for a Light Railway Order to extend services north to East Grinstead led to a public enquiry in June 1983 and the grant of permission by the Secretary of State for the Environment on 2 April 1985, subject to conditions including the removal of waste from Imberhorne cutting. The first section of track of the northern extension was laid on 13 March 1988 by Paul Channon MP, Secretary of State for Transport. On 17 April 1992, the line was further extended through Sharpthorne Tunnel up to New Coombe. On 23 April 1994, the first public service to call at in 39 years ran following the completion of New Coombe Bridge.\n\nIn 1991, British Rail gave the Bluebell Railway an undertaking to sell it Hill Place Viaduct as well as land for a new station at East Grinstead; each would be sold for the sum of £1.00. On 8 September 1992, the viaduct was formally handed over to the Bluebell Extension Company. The proposed station site, which was located just south of the existing station, had been used for carriage storage sidings since closure of the line to Sheffield Park and Lewes. Although not ideal, the site is large enough to accommodate an eight-car platform, basic station facilities and the necessary track and infrastructure.\n\nDespite the understanding reached with British Rail, several attempts were made by neighbouring commercial interests to take over the site following its privatisation and the appearance of Railtrack. In April 1993, it was reported that the former goods yard had been sold by British Rail Property Board for £2.3m and that J Sainsbury plc would be constructing a supermarket on part of the land, with the rest to be used as a replacement car park in front of the station. In October 1995, J Sainsbury plc made a planning application for a petrol station on the season ticket holders' car park in front of the station, with the parking to be relocated to the intended station site. A further application was presented in March 1996 showing Sainsbury's intention to use part of the site itself. The applications were refused by Mid Sussex District Council on the basis that they affected the proposed Bluebell station. The Bluebell had turned down a proposal by consultants engaged by Railtrack for a single-platform terminus relocated nearer Imberhorne Viaduct. In September 2002, Railtrack applied to the Office of the Rail Regulator to sell the land earmarked for the Bluebell Railway to Sainsbury's for an extension of the adjoining supermarket car park. In its application, Railtrack acknowledged that an undertaking had been given to sell the land to the Bluebell Railway, but indicated that in its opinion the extension of the line to East Grinstead would not materialise. Objections to the proposal were made by the Strategic Rail Authority, Southern and the various local authorities; the Bluebell Railway also objected and stated that it would make the East Grinstead extension unviable. Consent to the sale was refused by the Regulator. In 2006, Network Rail sold the station site to the Bluebell Railway.\n\nWork began in May 2008 on clearing the site for the construction of a new platform. This was completed within two days and work started in November to prepare the site for tracklaying. On the night of 13 January 2009, Network Rail connected the track to the main line. A network of ducts was laid to enable the station to be signalled remotely from the Kingscote signalbox. Signalling will be controlled from Kingscote, although the Society will relocate an historic LB&SCR signalbox from .\n\nTo mark an open day on 17 January 2009, former South West Trains 4Vep unit no. 3417 (named \"Gordon Pettit\" after the last Southern Region manager) was moved to the station site. Presented to the Bluebell by South West Trains which had restored the unit to its original blue livery at Wimbledon depot, it became the first train to use the new connection between Network Rail and the Bluebell Railway at East Grinstead. It was shunted over the connection by Class 73 73205. The unit only remained on site for a few days as on 22 January it was moved to secure undercover storage at Eastleigh Works.\n\nBy July 2009, service pipes and a permanent messing facility had been installed on the site. Construction on the back wall of the platform began on 10 August 2009. All utilities and cabling had to be routed under or through the platform due to the long and thin shape of the plot. Tracklaying in the station area was complete by June 2010, following which the first train over the section carrying waste from Imberhorne cutting ran on 6 July. GB Railfreight (GBRf), which had been contracted to run occasional trains, ran the first of its services carrying 1,000 tons of excavated rubbish from Imberhorne Cutting to disposal sites, initially at Calvert. The total to be removed was some 90,981 tons, achieved by December 2011. The waste had been deposited in the and quarter-mile-long (400 m) Hill Place Cutting which was purchased and designated as a landfill tip by East Grinstead Town Council in the late 1960s and used for around 25 years.\n\nThe station's layout is basic to allow trains arriving from the south to arrive directly in the platform so that the locomotive can detach, take water and return to the south end of the train via a run-round loop. Train movements in the station area are subject to a speed restriction in order to reduce noise and smoke.\n\nThe station first opened to the public on 4 September 2010 as part of an open day weekend. Class 73 73208 \"Kirsten\" broke through a ceremonial banner at the station on the day. A shuttle passenger service operated during the weekend for about to the north end of the infilled Hill Place Cutting. The first direct through service as far as the tip face ran on 6 November 2010, with a Class 201 No. 1001 preserved DEMU running a \"Blue Belle\" charter from Hastings through to Imberhorne North. It had been intended that the station should represent an authentic Southern Railway station from the 1930s with an art deco-style main building, with a single platform capable of accommodating eight coach trains complete with a run-round loop and a water tower. This plan was frustrated by Network Rail's need to access the land earmarked for the proposed building and it was therefore decided to use replicated LB&SCR lampposts, benches and signalling with Southern-style enamel signs in a Southern Region colour scheme to reflect how the 1882 East Grinstead station would have looked prior to demolition.\n\nThe Bluebell Railway commenced services to East Grinstead on 23 March 2013. The first service was the 9:45 am \"The Pioneer\" to Sheffield Park hauled by LB&SCR A1X class 55 Stepney. The first through service from London Victoria since September 1963 and the first service through to Sheffield Park since 1958, a 12-coach railtour worked by GBRf Class 66/7 66739, ran on 28 March 2013. Two GBRf Class 73s, 73207 and 73119, provided heating and also operated services between East Grinstead and Sheffield Park using the Bluebell's own rolling stock. In the year following the opening of the extension, the Bluebell's annual passenger figures rose from 60,000 to 250,000 and annual revenue increased by 25% to £4 million.\n\nThe high level station was still in construction when it opened on 1 August 1882, the first day of service on the L&EG, and was initially only used by some Three Bridges to Tunbridge Wells services scheduled to connect with those on the L&EG. The new station was still not complete by March 1883 and a working timetable instruction advised locomotive drivers and guards to take care to ensure that their trains pulled up at the completed part of the high level platform. Until 14 October 1883, these trains called at the 1866 and the unfinished high level station where a temporary ticket box was opened. On 15 October 1883 the new high and low level stations were officially opened and the 1866 station was closed.\n\nThe high level station had two island platforms, curiously numbered 3 and 4 even though each platform had two faces, serving four tracks on the Three Bridges line, while below it a low level station set at a right-angle with two platforms to serve the L&EG and CO&EG. The southern island platform was situated between the two roads of the crossing loop of the Three Bridges line and the northern island platform was between the up and down lines of the St Margaret's Loop spur. Trains from Tunbridge Wells bound for Three Bridges could only be routed via the south face of platform 3, whilst those intended for the Oxted line ran from the south face of platform 4. In the other direction, trains from Three Bridges arrived at the north face of platform 3, whilst those from Oxted were routed via the north face of platform 4. To the east of the station, all running roads converged on the single track to Groombridge. The timber accommodation provided for the high level station was not as comfortable as that in the lower level station. It was, however, equipped with a refreshment room lit by a lantern roof on each platform, as well as two signal cabins on either side—\"East Grinstead West\" and \"East Grinstead East\". The platforms were timber-planked where they passed above the low level tracks. The platforms were connected by western and eastern staircases; the western staircase fell out of use after 1891 when an overbridge linking the low level platforms was built. A private siding also led into the adjoining timber yard. The first train to call at the station was a 05:50 service from Three Bridges to via East Grinstead. In 1922, a water tower from was installed at the eastern end of the station.\n\nFollowing the opening of the CO&EG on 10 March 1884, a sharply curving spur line (later known as \"St. Margaret's Loop\") which entered the high level station from the CO&EG was also opened. This was a double-track connection from the west-end of the station on a tight curve which joined the CO&EG to the north of the town at St Margaret's Junction at , named after a local Anglican convent. To ease the sharpness of the curve, the Three Bridges line was deviated on its western approach to the high level station. The deviation was completed in May 1882 and comprised two underbridges with brick abutments and wrought iron girders which would cross the new line and the new road which had to be built (Station Road). No regular service was booked to use the loop until October 1885. A single-track spur was also laid from the south of the low level station to the east of the high level to be used for shunting trains between the stations and turning engines; no scheduled services ever used it. As there was a shorter route from to Groombridge via , there would have been no need for the spur. It had been proposed to construct a loop to the west of the high level station between St Margaret's Loop and the Three Bridges line to allow through running between the Oxted and Three Bridges lines but this was never realised.\n\nThe closure of the Three Bridges-Ashurst Junction line after the last train on Sunday 1 January 1967 spelt the end for the high level station and St Margaret's Loop which would receive no further traffic. The goods yard had been virtually closed for some time except for coal and all freight facilities were formally withdrawn as from 10 April. Although very nearly redundant, the high level goods sidings could still be accessed via the low to high level connecting spur; both spurs serving the high level station were however closed in 1967. The last train to use the station was in February 1968, a tracklifting train hauled by a Class 33 diesel locomotive. As the footbridge at the low-level platforms had been demolished in Summer 1965, passengers used the high level station as a short-cut between platforms, thereby avoiding the need to go around a local housing estate. The high level's demolition in 1970 led to protests from passengers at the loss of the short-cut, as a result of which British Rail erected a footbridge which today marks the site of the high level station.\n\nThe goods yard area was taken over by the A22 road which runs parallel with Railway Approach. The East Grinstead Society had attempted to save the brick goods shed for reuse as a drama and arts workshop but were unable to secure the necessary funds and so it was demolished in 1976. The site of the high level station is now a car park whose perimeter is marked out with old rails. Beyond the car park to the east, the former railway embankment has been removed to make way for the Inner Relief Road (A22 Beeching Way) which was opened in 1978. In July 1979, much of the trackbed from Three Bridges to East Grinstead became a footpath and cycleway known as the Worth Way.\n\nThe reopening of the line from Tunbridge Wells to Three Bridges has been suggested as a means of relieving the A264 road. However, a number of obstacles would appear to stand in the way of such action, most notably:\n\n\n"}

They released the \"Metal Fix \" demo and video in 1985. The video received extensive airplay on the Canadian cable channel MuchMusic's \"Power Hour.\" This was followed by the 1986 EP \"Attack from Above\" and the 1991 LP \"Open Fire\". The video for \"Reach the Sun\" was featured at the Los Angeles Foundations Forum in 1991 and still airs on both Much Music and Musique Plus.\n\nThey performed in spiked body armor and the drummer's kit included massive, by stainless steel bass drums. Eudoxis are credited as having the longest and loudest bass drums on record.\n\nThe 1991-1992 \"Open Fire\" tour featured the light show of Pierre \"Metal Monk\" Gendron and included songs written for their next album which was never released since Eudoxis disbanded in 1993. Deeply rooted in the philosophy of Socrates, the books of Homer, and the psychology of Freud, Sotiri Papafylis' lyrics dealt with the perils of war, torment, insanity, and triumph. Rick \"Raz\" Raczko explored the full potential of the bass guitar as a melodic lead instrument. This use of his custom-made graphite neck, five-string bass is exemplified on the introduction of the song \"Omnipotent Phantasies\" and on their instrumental epic \"Reflections of a Lost Past\". A new generation of Canadian metal bands regard them as musical influences and their releases have become classics treasured by fans and collectors around the world.\n\nIn 2006, Eudoxis were asked to reunite for a large Canadian heavy metal festival but this long-awaited reunion was not to be. Mars B. Alexander relocated to Toronto and formed Mars Project in 2004. Sotiri Papafylis currently sings and plays blues harmonica with Back Sabbath (a Black Sabbath tribute band).\n\nThe second release by Canadian thrash metal pioneers Eudoxis. Only 1000 copies of this vinyl record are in circulation.\nThis two-song EP, recorded at Lamajeure Studios, Montreal, was released in 1986, one year after their demo and video for the song \"Metal Fix\" which received regular airplay on MuchMusic's \"Power Hour\". A more polished version of \"Metal Fix\" appears on side 2. Side 1 features the title track \"Attack from Above\". Leiv Arnesen drew on his years of service in the United States Air Force as an Aircraft Armaments Systems Technician (462), in writing the title track. It was inspired by those who huddled together in fear in London's many airraid shelters during the Battle of Britain. This record sold out through after show sales and worldwide mail orders. It is frequently seen on want lists and internet auctions.\nRick \"Raz\" Raczko (bass) and Stephane Rioux (drums) founded Eudoxis in 1984 and they appear on this record. Original vocalist Leiv Arnesen (Leiv Armageddon) left the band in 1987 and was replaced in 1989 by singer/songwriter Sotiri Papafylis. Ronnie Theriault (guitars) was also replaced in 1989 by ex-Axewraith guitarist Mars B. Alexander.\n\nThird and final release by Canadian thrash metal pioneers Eudoxis. It was recorded in Montreal at Silent Sound studio in the summer of 1990 by Graeme Scott and Morris Apelbaum. It was mixed at Karisma studio by Bryan \"Rock Pig\" Martin. This full-length LP was released in 1991 accompanied by the video for \"Reach the Sun\" (produced by David Jeidekin) and featured the songs \"Tormented We Fall\" and their theme song \"The Gathering\". The songs were written by Sotiri Papafylis (vocals), Rick \"Raz\" Raczko (bass), Mars B. Alexander (guitar), and J.P. Perrault (drums). Mario Gilles was recruited as a second guitar player to recreate the dual guitar parts live. The album cover illustration is a painting by Jean-Francois Mayer. This album was released under the band's independent Shell Shock label and was distributed in Canada, Germany, Japan, Greece, and the United States. It has since sold out and is frequently seen selling for exorbitant prices on internet auctions. The band ceased to exist in 1993 but through the internet and collectors, this album has spread to the UK, Poland, Croatia, Russia and South America.\n\nMembers included:\n\nOfficial Metal Fix Video\n"}

C. Christensen with the 'J' pronounced as an 'I', was a Danish politician.\n\nChristensen was born into a West Jutland peasant family and starting as a herd boy, he was educated a teacher and joined politics at an early age. He was a member of the Danish Liberal Party until he founded the Venstre Reform Party in 1895. During later years, he successfully and adroitly led the opposition against the last Right cabinets, which resulted in the victory of parliamentarianism 1901. In the first Left cabinet of J. H.

Christensen was Council President of Denmark from 1905 to 1908 as the leader of the Cabinet of J. C. Christensen I and II. During this period he introduced female suffrage in local politics and tried to solve the problem of the defense. Also, he took the first steps towards a re-conciliation with the moderate liberals excluding the radicals. In addition, a law was passed in April 1907 that authorised state contributions for unemployment relief.\n\nThe Alberti scandal in 1908 led to his fall and weakened his position, but he was still the leader of his party participating in the second Carl Theodor Zahle cabinet 1916–1918. In 1920–1922, he was minister for the last time and two years later he left politics. During his last years he supported the cultivation of the moor of Jutland.\n\n"}

It replaced the 6-cylinder engines M180 in the 230 and M130 in the 250 (2.8 liter) versions from the W114 series.\n\nThe M123 was succeeded by the M103, introduced in 1984 with the M124 series.\n\nLike the M123, the M123 only has four crankshaft bearings and its oil pump, fuel pump and distributor are driven by a shaft inclined at the front end of the motor, which in turn is driven through a sprocket and a helical gear pair.\n\nUnlike the M180's paired cylinder spacing, the M123’s is uniform like in the M130. So, instead of cooling ducts cast between the cylinders, slots in the cylinders’ partition walls are traversed by coolant.\n\nThe engine has a single overhead camshaft (SOHC), driven by a chain. The vertical hanging valves are arranged in two rows, operated by rocker levers. As with the M115, inlet and outlet both are on the right side of the engine. Within the cylinder head there is (on the left side of the engine) a recessed combustion chamber (with a flat piston crown), in which the exhaust valve and the spark plug are located while the remaining area (on the right side) forms a squish area that is intended to swirl the fuel-air-mixture in the combustion chamber.\n\nFuel-air mixture was generated by a Solex 4A1 carburetor. It is of the double-register type, as with the previous model W114. That means each of the two sets of mixing systems feeds three cylinders and each of these two sets is composed of a first relatively small mixing system for idling and a second, larger mixing system for higher load and higher speeds. At idle and up to about one-third load only the smaller tube of each set is mechanically operated by the accelerator pedal, while the second tube of each set is enabled by a vacuum cell only at high load and high engine speed. All four (2 x 2) tubes are supplied with fuel by a central float chamber. The engine is equipped with gasoline feed line and gasoline return line (which usually was more typical for fuel injection engines) achieving a cooling effect which protects from vapor locks, that would cause starting problems in hot weather.\n\nThe M123’s relatively quiet operation was marred by high gasoline consumption, although the engine actually reached its most important development goal of being more economical than the carbureted 280 models.\n\nWhile the rest of the 123 series’ engine range was taken over from its predecessor satisfactorily, the M123 did not quite convince customers, although it is the only engine that was newly developed for this series.\n\nIn 1979 the engine was upgraded and power output increased from to . But especially after the launch of the new four-cylinder M102 in the 200 and 230 E models, the customer interest fell sharply since the M102 did almost everything better while its petrol consumption was significantly lower.\n\nIn October 1981, the engine has been further revised to reduce consumption by changing the combustion chambers in the cylinder head.\n\nIn 1982 the estate version was not available with the M123 anymore (250 T). And although the engine was available until 1985 in the sedan (250), it did not play an appreciable role in sales anymore.\n\nThe M123’s direct replacement, the 2.6 liter variant of the M103 (starting 1984), was better in every way: that engine not only was cheaper to produce, lighter and much more fuel-efficient, it was running smoother and also had more power and increased revving vivacity compared with the more sedate M123.\n\nMore than 30 years after its introduction, the M123 is now regarded as a somewhat classic Mercedes-Benz engine.\n\nThe capable but complex Solex 4A1 carburetor is seen as difficult to repair and adjust nowadays. Some specific weakness left aside, any double-register carburetor might be regarded as the most complicated device to generate fuel-air mixture widely used in passenger cars. With prevalence of the three-way catalytic converter (needing specific air fuel ratio) double-register carburetors became obsolete and were replaced temporarily by electronically controlled simpler carburetors and then finally by fuel injection systems that are more reliable in the long term and can be easily maintained.\n\nThe M123.920 was a engine with a bore and stroke of . Power output was at 5,500 rpm, Torque at 3,500 rpm. 1976 - September 1979.\n\nApplications:\n\nThe revised M123.921 was also a engine. Power output was at an unchanged 5,500 rpm, Torque at 3,500 rpm.

{"id": "1801702", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1801702", "title": "Peter Canisius", "text": "Peter Canisius\n\nPeter Canisius (, 8 May 1521 – 21 December 1597) was a renowned Dutch Jesuit Catholic priest. He became known for his strong support for the Catholic faith during the Protestant Reformation in Germany, Austria, Bohemia, Moravia, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The restoration of the Catholic Church in Germany after the Protestant Reformation is largely attributed to the work there of the Society of Jesus, which he led. He is venerated in the Catholic Church as a saint and as a Doctor of the Church.\n\nHe was born in 1521 in Nijmegen in the Duchy of Guelders, which, until 1549, was part of the Habsburg Netherlands within the Holy Roman Empire and is now the Netherlands. His father was a wealthy burgermeister, Jacob Kanis. His mother, Ægidia van Houweningen, died shortly after Peter's birth. He was sent to study at the University of Cologne, where he earned a Master's degree in 1540, at the age of 19.\n\nWhile there, he met Peter Faber, one of the founders of the Society of Jesus. Through him, Canisius became the first Dutchman to join the newly founded Society of Jesus in 1543. Through his preaching and writings, Peter Canisius became one of the most influential Catholics of his time. He supervised the founding and maintenance of the first German-speaking Jesuit colleges, often with little resources at hand. At the same time he preached in the city and vicinity, and debated and taught in the university. Due to his frequent travels between the colleges, a tedious and dangerous occupation at the time, he became known as the Second Apostle of Germany.\n\nCanisius also exerted a strong influence on the Emperor Ferdinand I. The king's eldest son (later Maximilian II) appointed Phauser, a married priest, to the office of court preacher. Canisius warned Ferdinand I, verbally and in writing, and opposed Phauser in public disputations. Maximilian was obliged to dismiss Phauser and, on this account, the rest of his life he harboured a grudge against Canisius.\n\nIn 1547 he attended several sessions of the Council of Trent. Canisius was an influential teacher and preacher, especially through his \"German Catechism\", a book which defined the basic principles of Catholicism in the German language and made them more accessible to readers in German-speaking countries. He was offered the post of Bishop of Vienna in 1554, but declined in order to continue his traveling and teachings. He did, however, serve as administrator of the Diocese of Vienna for one year, until a new bishop was appointed for it.\n\nHe moved to Germany, where he was one of the main Catholic theologians at the Colloquy of Worms in 1557, and later served as the main preacher in the Cathedral of Augsburg from 1559 to 1568, where he strongly witnessed to his faith on three or four occasions each week. Canisius was renowned as a popular preacher. In 1562 he founded what was to become the University of Innsbruck.\n\nIn \"Christ The King- Lord of History\" by Anne W. Carroll, it states:\" Protestantism had made much headway in Germany because many intellectuals had adopted it, making Catholicism appear to be the religion of the ignorant. By his debates, his writing and his teachings, Peter showed that Catholicism was thoroughly rational, that the Protestant arguments were not convincing.\"\n\n\" By his efforts, Peter won Bavaria (southern Germany) and the Rhineland (central Germany) back to the Catholic Church. He also won converts in Austria, Hungary, Bohemia and Poland. Poland had become largely Protestant, but thanks to the efforts of Peter and other Jesuits, it returned to the Church and is still Catholic today despite Communist persecution.\" \n\nBy the time he left Germany, the Society of Jesus in Germany had evolved from a small band of priests into a powerful tool of the Counter-Reformation. Canisius spent the last twenty years of his life in Fribourg, where he founded the Jesuit , which trained generations of young men for careers and future university studies.\n\nIn 1591, at the age of 70, Canisius suffered a stroke which left him partially paralyzed, but he continued to preach and write with the aid of a secretary until his death in Fribourg.\n\nHe was initially buried at the Church of St Nicholas. His remains were later transferred to the church of the Jesuit College, which he had founded and where he had spent the last year of his life, and interred in front of the main altar of the church; the room he occupied during those last months is now a chapel open for the veneration of the faithful.\n\nCanisius lived during the height of the Protestant Reformation and dedicated much of his work to the clarification of the Catholic faith in light of the emergence of the new Protestant doctrines. His lasting contribution is his three catechisms, which he published in Latin and German, which became widespread and popular in Catholic regions. In his fight with German Protestantism, he requested much more flexibility from Rome, arguing:\n\nHe rejected attacks against John Calvin and Melanchthon: \"With words like these, we don’t cure patients, we make them incurable\".\n\nCanisius taught that, while there are many roads leading to Jesus Christ, for him the veneration of the Blessed Virgin Mary is the best. His sermons and letters document a clear preoccupation with Marian veneration. Under the heading \"prayer\" he explains the \"Ave Maria\" (Hail Mary) as the basis for Catholic Marian piety. Less known are his Marian books, in which he published prayers and contemplative texts. He is credited with adding to the Hail Mary the sentence: \"Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners.\" Eleven years later it was included in the Catechism of the Council of Trent of 1566.\n\nCanisius published an applied Mariology for preachers, in which Mary is described in tender and warm words. He actively promoted the sodalities of our Lady and the rosary associations.\n\nTheologically, Canisius defended Catholic Mariology in his 1577 book, \"De Maria Virgine Incomparabili et Dei Genitrice Sacrosancta Libri Quinque\". The book was ordered by Pope Pius V to present a factual presentation of the Catholic Marian teachings in the Bible, the early Christians, the Church Fathers and contemporary theology. Canisius explains and documents Church teachings through the ages regarding the person and character of Mary, her virtues and youth. He traces historical documents about the perpetual virginity of Mary, and her freedom from sin. He explains the dogma of \"Mother of God\" with numerous quotations from the fathers after the Council of Ephesus. He shows that Church teaching has not changed. He answers the \"sola scriptura\" arguments of Protestants by analyzing the biblical basis for mariology. Book five explains the Catholic view of the assumption as living faith for centuries, supported by most prominent Church writers. In addition he justifies the cult of Mary within the Catholic Church.\n\nFrom today's perspective, Canisius clearly erred in some of his sources, but, because of his factual analysis of original sources, it is considered as representing one of the best theological achievements in the 16th century.\n\nCanisius was beatified by Pope Pius IX in the year 1864, and later canonized and declared a Doctor of the Church on 21 May 1925 by Pope Pius XI. His feast day was included in the General Roman Calendar in 1926, for celebration on 27 April. In the liturgical reform of 1969, it was moved to 21 December, the anniversary of his death, the normal day for celebrating a saint's entry into heaven (although it is still kept by the Society of Jesus on 27 April).\n\nIn recognition of Canisius' early work in the establishment of Jesuit education, there are multiple educational institutions named for him. Among them is the Canisius College for seminarians in Vienna, Austria, the first institution named for him, as well as Canisius College, a Jesuit secondary school in his hometown of Nijmegen and the alma mater of Peter Hans Kolvenbach, a recent Superior General of the Society of Jesus. Another Canisius College, a university, and Canisius High School, a secondary school, are located in Buffalo, New York. Furthermore, a Jesuit-run Canisius Kolleg can be found in Berlin, Germany. There are also two secondary schools named after Canisius, Kolese Kanisius (\"Collegium Canisianum\" or \"Canisius College\"), in Jakarta, Indonesia, and Canisianum Roman Catholic HS in the Omusati Region of Namibia, Africa.\n\nIn addition, there is a primary school: Basisschool Petrus Canisius in Puth in Limburg, Netherlands. In 1850 the Canisius Hospital was established on the corner of the Houtmarkt and the Pauwelstraat in Nijmegen. In 1974 it merged with Wilhelmina Hospital located at the Weg door Jonkerbos in Nijmegen, to become Canisius-Wilhemina Hospital.\n\nThe \"Apologetische Vereniging St. Petrus Canisius\" (St. Peter Canisius Association for Apologetics) was founded in the Netherlands in 1904 to defend the Roman Catholic Church against socialism and liberalism.\n\nFrom the middle of the nineteenth century on German churchmen, including Michael Cardinal von Faulhaber (1869–1952), considered Canisius as a new \"Apostle of Germany\", a successor of Saint Boniface, for his importance for German Christianity.\n\nThe longer version (with quotes from authority):\n\n\nIn addition to the listed institutions worldwide, there is Peter Canisius College in Sydney, Australia (suburb of Pymble at 102 Mona Vale Road).\n\n"}

The head may be referred to as a power sensor or mount. Different power sensors can be used for different frequencies or power levels. Historically the means of operation in most power sensor and meter combinations was that the sensor would convert the microwave power into an analogue voltage which would be read by the meter and converted into a power reading. Several modern power sensor heads contain electronics to create a digital output and can be plugged via USB into a PC which acts as the power meter.\n\nMicrowave power meters have a wide bandwidth—they are not frequency-selective. To measure the power of a specific frequency component in the presence of other signals at different frequencies a spectrum analyzer or measuring receiver is needed.\n\nThere are a variety of different technologies which have been used as the power sensing element. Each has advantages and disadvantages.\n\nThermal sensors can generally be divided into two main categories, thermocouple power sensors and thermistor-based power sensors. Thermal sensors depend on the process of absorbing the RF and microwave signal energy, and sense the resulting heat rise. Therefore, they respond to true average power of the signal, whether it is pulsed, CW, AM/FM or any complex modulation. (Agilent 2008).\nThermocouple power sensors make up the majority of the thermal power sensors sold at present. They are generally reasonably linear and have a reasonably fast response time and dynamic range. The microwave power is absorbed in a load whose temperature rise is measured by the thermocouple. Thermocouple sensors often require a reference DC or microwave power source for calibration before measuring; this can be built into the power meter.\nThermistor-based power sensors such as the Agilent 8478B are generally only used in situations where their excellent linearity is important, as they are both much slower and have a smaller dynamic range than either thermocouple or diode-based sensors. Thermistor-based power sensors are still the sensor of choice for power transfer standards because of their DC power substitution capability (Agilent 2006). Other thermal sensing technologies include microwave calorimeters and bolometers,and quasi-optic pulsed microwave sensors.\n\nMany microwave power heads use one or more diode(s) to rectify the incident microwave power, and have extremely fast response. The diode would generally be used in its square-law region and hence give an output voltage proportional to the incident RF power. In order to extend their dynamic range beyond the square-law region, linearity correction circuits or multiple diode stacks are used. With advancement in comprehensive data compensation algorithm and diode stacks topology, diode sensors like the Agilent E9300A is able to respond properly to complex modulated signals over a wide dynamic range (Agilent, 2006). Like thermocouple sensors, they often require a reference source.\n\nOther technologies have been investigated or implemented for use as power sensors but are not widely used today; these include torque-vane, electron-beam, MEMS, Hall effect and atomic fountain based sensors.\n\nThe two main types of microwave power meters are:\n\nPower meters generally report the power in dBm (decibels relative to 1 milliwatt), dBW (decibels relative to 1 watt) or watts. Manufacturers of microwave power meters include: Aeroflex, Keysight, Anritsu, Bird Technologies, Boonton Electronics, Giga-tronics, Rohde and Schwarz, Tektronix and TEGAM Inc..\n\n\n"}

This is done with many older transporter vans and campers like the 207D and 307D models. It is not possible to change only the cylinder head for one with the higher rating, since the higher valve lift of the later versions will interfere with the early pistons.\nIt is possible to change to a more powerful straight-five OM617 but modifications to engine mounts, the hood, and other underhood components (notably the radiator and cooling fan) are necessary.\n\nIn 1982, Bajaj Tempo, now Force Motors, signed a deal with Daimler Benz to manufacture the OM616 Mercedes engine under licence in India for fitting on its line of vehicles.

The homes were maintained by individual religious orders in the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland.\n\nPeter Mullan has remarked that the film was initially made because victims of Magdalene Asylums had received no closure in the form of recognition, compensation or apology, and many remained lifelong devout Catholics. Former Magdalene inmate Mary-Jo McDonagh told Mullan that the reality of the Magdalene Asylums was much worse than depicted in the film.\n\nThough set in Ireland, it was shot entirely on location in Dumfries and Galloway, South-West Scotland.\n\nIn Ireland, 1964, so-called \"fallen\" women are considered sinners who needed to be redeemed. Four young women – Margaret (raped by her cousin), Bernadette (too beautiful and coquettish), Rose (an unmarried mother) and Crispina (an intellectually disabled unmarried mother) – are forced by their families or caretakers into the Magdalene Asylum.\nThe film details the disastrous lives of the four girls whilst they are inmates, portraying their harsh daily regimen and their squalid living conditions at the laundries.\n\nEach woman suffers horrific cruelty and violence from the Mother Superior. Sister Bridget, despite her gentle-faced appearance and outwardly soft-spoken demeanour. She is characterised as sadistic and almost inhuman at times, as conveyed through her merciless beating of Rose in full view of Bernadette, or when she mockingly laughs at Una as she hopelessly clutches at her fallen hair locks.\n\nThe film also criticises the hypocrisy and corruption within the staff of the laundries. Sister Bridget relishes the money the business receives and it is suggested that little of it is distributed appropriately. Those who liken themselves to Mary Magdalene, who deprived herself of all pleasures of the flesh including food and drink, eat hearty breakfasts of buttered toast and bacon while the working women subsist on oatmeal. In one particularly humiliating scene, the women are forced to stand naked in a line after taking a communal shower. The nuns then hold a \"contest\" on who has the most pubic hair, biggest bottom, biggest breasts and smallest breasts. The corruption of the resident priest, Father Fitzroy, is made very clear through his sexual abuse of Crispina. However, as the years pass, automatic washing machines start to appear, a modern household appliance whose growing ubiquity would eventually fatally undermine the economic viability of commercial laundries and make the Magdalene Asylums unsustainable.\n\nThree of the girls are shown, to some extent, to triumph over their situation and their captors. Margaret, although she is allowed to leave by the intervention of her younger brother, does not leave the asylum without leaving her mark. When she deliberately asks Sister Bridget to step aside for her to freely pass and is sharply shot down, Margaret falls to her knees in prayer. The Mother Superior is so surprised, she only moves past her after the Bishop tells her to come along. Bernadette and Rose finally decide to escape together, trashing Sister Bridget's study in search for the key to the asylum door and engaging her in a suspenseful confrontation. The two girls escape her clutches and are helped to return to the real world by a sympathetic relative, their story optimistically ending when Rose boards a coach bound for the ferry to Liverpool and Bernadette becomes an apprentice hairdresser. Crispina's end, however, is not a happy one; she spends the rest of her days in a mental institution (where she was sent to silence her from revealing the sexual abuse she suffered at the hands of Father Fitzroy) and dies of anorexia at age 24.\n\n\nThe film received critical acclaim. As of 25 October 2008, the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 90% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 144 reviews. Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 83 out of 100, based on 38 reviews – indicating \"universal acclaim\". This made it the twentieth best reviewed film of the year. The film appeared on several US critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2003.\n\n\nThe film also received critical acclaim when it was premiered at the Venice Film Festival in 2002. There Mullan was awarded the festival's highest prize, the Golden Lion.\n\n\n"}

He has also appeared in numerous radio series, including the improvised faux drama show, \"The Masterson Inheritance\" and BBC Radio 4's \"Just a Minute\". He made guest appearances in sitcoms \"Kiss Me Kate\" and \"One Foot In The Grave\" (the latter as a computer salesman memorably humiliated by Victor Meldrew).\n\nSince 1985, Sweeney has multiple sclerosis, something which has required use of a walking stick and, from 2005, a wheelchair. Sweeney wrote about his experiences of multiple sclerosis in \"My MS and Me\", a play he performed for BBC Radio 4 after a successful Edinburgh Festival run. In 2008, the disease meant he gave up appearing on stage, although he continues to be listed as a member of the Comedy Store Players.\n\nIn 2007, he made two series of BBC Radio 4's improvised sketch show \"The Lawrence Sweeney Mix\" with Josie Lawrence.\n\nSweeney lives in Wimbledon with his girlfriend and two daughters and now has 24-hour care for his condition. He has an optic nerve condition leading to blurred vision.\n\n"}

He is nicknamed \"The Greaseman\".\n\nTracht was born and grew up in the South Bronx (New York City) with his younger sister, Diana, and parents, Alfred and Gertrude Tracht. His father was a native New Yorker who sold dental supplies; his mother was a Lutheran immigrant from Germany who stayed home to raise her two children until they were in high school, then became a noted educator. Tracht attended DeWitt Clinton High School and graduated in 1968. He majored in broadcasting at Ithaca College and landed a job at the college radio station. \"From the first day I got on the air, I was trying to do comedy bits and tell jokes. After my first year in college, I had this station (WYSL) in Buffalo, New York, offer me a big time job.\" Tracht got a job at WTKO, a low-power top-40 station in Ithaca. The following year, he had moved up to night DJ at a larger station in Binghamton, New York, WENE. Tracht graduated from Ithaca College in 1972\nand married Marie Massara who was the sales secretary at WENE.\n\nThe Greaseman pseudonym originated while he was in college. \"In those days of top 40, everybody who was on the radio was 'cookin'; cookin' with the Temptations, cookin' Four Tops, that kind of thing. Which meant they were really rockin'. One day I said I was cookin' with heavy grease. It was my way of saying I was out-cookin' the other guys. I said it enough times, so one day one of the other deejays referred to me as the Greaseman.\"\nHis radio name had been \"Dougie T\", but when he became \"the Greaseman\", a different personality surfaced. His voice deepened and he projected the image of a middle-aged tattooed truck driver with a beer belly and a cigar. In reality, Tracht was 6 foot 2 and 150 pounds. He used the radio as an alter ego; a guy with a swaggering bravado. At WENE, he was asked to do remote broadcasts from a sponsor's business and listeners were disappointed to see that he looked like a wimp. In later years, Tracht took up bodybuilding to improve his physique.\n\n\"The Greaseman Show\" is a fast-paced array of what he terms \"bits.\" Calls from listeners inevitably lead to a story of a recurring character from his repertoire, and no topic is taboo. He calls his deep voice his \"basso grosso\" or \"basso profundo.\"\nAs The Greaseman, Tracht invented a clever way of getting around limits on indecent language by using slang terms for body parts and functions that he invented. His listeners knew the meanings of the terms. In this way, he managed to directly discuss very explicitly adult topics without alerting censors, or alarming parents who did not understand the private language.\n\nTracht went through a string of stations including WAXC in Rochester, New York, WRC in Washington, D.C., and WPOP in Hartford, Connecticut. He lost his job at WPOP when that station switched its format from pop music to all news in 1975. He lost the job at WRC because program director Gordon Peil wanted Tracht to drop the Greaseman personality. The frequent moves from city to city were a major reason for the end of his first marriage, after less than two years.\n\nTracht found a home at WAPE in Jacksonville, Florida, in August 1975 and became the dominant radio personality not just in northeast Florida, but in the Southeastern United States While in Jacksonville, his true identity was kept confidential because the public was disappointed that the booming, macho voice belonged to a young guy who was skinny and shy. The station turned Tracht's request for privacy into a marketing ploy. Curtains were hung in the window of the broadcast booth, a TV interview showed only his lips, and Tracht wore a gorilla costume at personal appearances. Tracht was named as the top radio personality in the United States for 1977 and 1980. In 1979, he signed a five-year contract worth $1 million.\n\nHe was an early shock jock, but Tracht denies the label: \"I'm telling jokes. The bottom line—it's a comedy show.\" \"I'm creating characters and stories, I'm weaving a tapestry of humor. The others are just saying nasty things.\"\nHowever, his show was outrageous and edgy, which offended some people. Tracht kept his stories from violating FCC obscenity regulations by using \"code words\" for certain anatomical features (\"hydraulics\" for male genitalia, \"fudge packing\" for anal sex, for instance) and sound effects for physical acts.\n\nAllen Moore, WAPE's news director, was also a bodybuilder. Tracht questioned Moore about his hobby, and Moore encouraged Tracht to try it. Tracht began a high protein diet of canned tuna, raw eggs, and milk; took vitamins; and lifted weights for 90 minutes a day. In the first three months, he added 25 pounds of muscle to his thin physique. After a year, he had gained 45 pounds, and people commented that he looked like Arnold Schwarzenegger. Tracht enrolled in an evening law enforcement training program, and after completing it, he volunteered as an auxiliary officer. He occasionally worked the night shift with the Clay County Sheriff's Office, then went directly to the station at 5:30 a.m. for his morning show, still in uniform. One of his most popular bits was stories portraying what it would be like to be a lawman. He would state \"What it must be like to strap on a gun, pin on a badge and become a lawman\" under the theme song to the TV program SWAT.\n\nOn May 25, 1979, Tracht gained national attention when he mocked convicted murderer John Spenkelink, who was due to be executed in \"Old Sparky,\" the Florida State Prison electric chair, that day. Tracht aired a recording of sizzling bacon and dedicated it to Spenkelink, telling him to get used to the sound.\n\nTracht remained in Jacksonville almost seven years, then moved in 1982 to WWDC-FM in Washington, D.C., where he replaced Howard Stern. DC-101 was his first FM station. He purchased a home in nearby Potomac, Maryland, continued working out, and overcame his dislike of public appearances. During that time, he was known for a series of publicity stunts, including his \"presidential campaign\" in 1984.\n\nOne of his audio-skits was a story of himself as an explorer being chased. The story was complete with bongos playing in the background with intermittent screeches of wild jungle birds. The implication was he was being chased by cannibals in the jungle. The bongo drums became louder and louder as the story progressed, implying those chasing him were getting closer and closer and he was getting more and more desperate to escape. The story ended just as he was about to be caught when he \"...jumped on the Red Line and went home!\"\n\nIn January 1986, Tracht created an uproar by telling an on-air joke regarding the new federal holiday, Martin Luther King Day. Tracht said, \"Why don't we shoot four more and get the whole week off?\" followed by, \"Come on, now, you know I don't mean nothin'!\" He was suspended from the station for five days, publicly apologized, and donated money to create a scholarship at Howard University in honor of Dr. King. The \"Washington Post\" noted that he was the highest paid DJ in D.C. during 1987, making $400,000 a year.\n\nHis show was syndicated by Infinity Broadcasting Corporation for five years, from January 1993 until January 1998. Tracht moved to Los Angeles, where his show originated from a private broadcasting studio in LA, and was carried by stations in Atlanta, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., and KLOS in Los Angeles, among others. During 1994 his audience was estimated at 2.5 million listeners each day.\n\nSyndication was not as successful as Infinity had hoped, so the contract was not extended beyond five years. In the last year of his Infinity contract, he was hired by WARW-FM for $1 million per year and returned to Washington, D.C., where he again incorporated music into his show.\n\nOn February 24, 1999, after a year at WARW (now WIAD), Tracht made a comment about James Byrd, who was murdered in 1998 by being dragged behind a pickup truck by three men, two determined to be white supremacists. The day before, jurors had convicted John William King of Byrd's murder. Tracht had been playing a sound bite of Lauryn Hill who had ten nominations at the 41st Grammy Awards. Tracht then stated, \"No wonder people drag them behind trucks.\" After the comment, he immediately stated that he \"didn't mean nothin'.\" This incident proved catastrophic to his radio career, igniting a firestorm of protest from listeners of all races, including Donnie Simpson, who lambasted Tracht on his morning show on sister station WPGC-FM. Not only was Tracht quickly fired from WARW, but he also lost his position as a volunteer deputy sheriff in Falls Church, Virginia.\n\nRock Newman was a black businessman who knew Tracht before the incident. Newman felt that Tracht was truly sorry and accompanied Doug and his wife on a quest to apologize and show that he wasn't a racist. The week following his firing, Tracht held a press conference and made an apology to his listeners, \"Every day you deserve my best, and last Wednesday I gave you my worst. This experience, compiled with my past transgressions upon racial and human decency, have forever taught me the value of respect and restraint.\" They spoke to several black organizations, then appeared on \"BET Tonight\" with Tavis Smiley on Black Entertainment Television where he faced angry questions. After being confronted by one caller, Tracht begged, \"Let me down off this cross, will you?\" Counseling was recommended. The show asked its audience what Tracht could do, but almost 75 percent said \"nothing.\"\n\nA worker at DC Central Kitchen saw Tracht's apology on TV and heard his desire to show he was sorry. She thought that the \"Kitchen\" would be a good place for him to prove himself, and shared the idea with a co-worker who knew Rock Newman; he made a phone call. Soon, Tracht was mopping floors and cleaning bathrooms for four hours a day, several times a week. He volunteered for four months, laboring with unemployed and homeless people. Of the experience, Tracht stated: \"It's the kind of place where you can rediscover yourself. I did things I'd never done in my life. I went in there like an idiot, and now I know how to clean and mop, how to shovel and unload, how to slice and dice.\"\n\nTracht began counseling with a psychologist at Howard University. After the counselor got to know his patient, he stated, \"I saw nothing consistent with what I would expect to find with someone who is a racist.\" Tracht continued to see the therapist weekly for over a year.\n\nIn February 2000, a station owner in Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, offered Tracht a DJ job. Tracht intended to make a new start, but when local residents found out about it, they objected. Local politicians talked to the station owner, who was \"persuaded\" to rescind the offer.\n\nTracht had a part in the Discovery Channel's show \"The FBI Files\" and appeared in an infomercial for an internet dating site in 2000.\n\nBy 2002 Tracht returned to the air from his home studio, broadcasting on WDMV AM 700 (previously WGOP) near Frederick, Maryland, and was soon afterward syndicated to numerous other stations in the region. He then held the morning-show slot on WMET AM 1160 in Gaithersburg, Maryland, until November 2, 2007. \"The Washington Post\" has described this period as \"six years of broadcasting his morning show on tiny, unknown AM stations with signals so weak they dissolve under the static created by a car's ignition system.\"\n\nMarc Fisher, a \"Washington Post\" columnist, wrote a story in November 2007 that questioned why Tracht hadn't been rehabilitated to the public like other broadcasters: Pat O'Brien, Don Imus, Marv Albert, and Opie and Anthony. All were suspended for bad behavior, some of which was criminal, but all returned to the microphone. Fisher called Tracht \"the most talented of the shock jocks, a storyteller so verbally nimble, so fantastically imaginative that his showmanship seemed wasted on an audience of adolescent guys.\"\n\nSelected Greaseman bits were heard during late PM drive on WGRX-FM 104.5 in the Fredericksburg, Virginia, area. On March 31, 2008, WWDC announced that the Greaseman show would be returning on Saturday mornings beginning April 5, 2008, and that the run would go until October 2008, after Clear Channel decided to have more \"music intensive\" weekends on DC101.\n\nIn January 2008 David Israel, the vice president and general manager of Cox Radio in Jacksonville, brought back Bubba the Love Sponge, who was fired in 2004 for indecency. When people asked about Tracht, another former Jacksonville radio personality, Israel tracked him down and they began discussing a job in August 2008. On September 29, 2008, during the Bubba the Love Sponge show, it was announced that Tracht would be returning to Jacksonville to do the afternoon show. This wasn't his first time back since his 1982 departure from WAPE. In the fall of 1996, his show was broadcast via syndication in Jacksonville over WTLK-FM \"Real Radio\" 106.5, where it lasted until January 1998, when the station changed owners and formats. On October 1, 2008, the Greaseman began his 3–7 p.m. show on WFYV-FM. He planned to originate some of the shows from his Maryland home studio, with the Jacksonville station studio hosting most of the time. According to Tracht, \"It's a thrill, frankly, to be back in Jacksonville. This is where the Greaseman bloomed.\"\n\nOn August 10, 2010, the Greaseman didn't host his afternoon show. \"Jake\" from Kansas City was on the air, and there was no explanation on the WFYV website; all references to Tracht were removed, as well as another DJ, Cowhead.\nThis notice was posted on the greaseman.org website:\n\n\"The Grease Show is no longer airing on Rock105 in Jacksonville. Grease has asked that the Branch Doodadians refrain from sending complaints to Rock105 as it won't change anything. He complements [sic] the staff there and said they just decided to go another direction, and there are no hard feelings. His latest ratings were great. Grease vows to find a new place to shriek sooner or later, and is planning to enjoy the rest of his summer and hopes to be back in action soon!\"\nFrom 2010 through 2018, The Greaseman was heard on the internet radio station Web Radio Classics (manned by former WRC jocks) from 6 p.m. until midnight Eastern time, with \"The Greaseman's Ring Dang Doo\" running from 6 to 10 p.m. and \"The Greaseman\" running from 10 p.m. until midnight ET. However, Web Radio Classics shut down on August 31, 2018. \n\nThe phrase \"Who's your daddy?\" may have been given its first widespread airing by Tracht in the late 1980s and 1990s on his syndicated radio program. Tracht used the term comedically but left no doubt about its sexual aspects; Tracht put the phrase in the mouth of his imagined male characters while they were in the middle of \"a zesty session.\" Tracht said he first heard the reference in The Zombies song \"Time of the Season.\" He said, \"I converted it to have a spicy connotation. As men we want validation because we are such inept lovers. [...] It just kind of popped out of the blue.\"\n\nTracht appeared in two television movies produced by his close friend Brian Dennehy: \"Jack Reed: A Search For Justice\" (1994) and \"Jack Reed: Death And Vengeance\" (1996).\n\n"}

It is a direct development from the straight-4 OM616. It was sold in vehicles from 1974 to 1991. The OM617 is considered to be one of the most reliable engines ever produced with engines often reaching over without being rebuilt and is one of the key reasons for Mercedes' popularity in North America in the 1980s, as it was powerful and reliable compared to other automotive diesels of the time. It is also a very popular choice for the use of alternative fuels, mainly straight or waste vegetable oil and biodiesel, although the use of these fuels may cause engine damage over time if not processed properly before use.\n\nEssentially an OM616 with an extra cylinder, it debuted in 1974 with the W115(240 3.0d) chassis. Bore and stroke was . It was originally . Bosch MW inline injection pumps were used, which had flyweight governors and vacuum shutoff. Previous engines had used pneumatic governors, and \"gorilla knob\" to start and shut off the engine. The North American engines had ADA device equipped pumps which limited fuel at high altitudes to prevent smoking with less dense air. New engine blocks after the .910 had rear mounted oil filter housings, with a combined full flow and bypass filter element. In August 1978 the precombustion chamber was updated to be similar to the new OM617A design for more swirl and more efficient combustion. The engine capacity was lowered to to satisfy engine displacement tax laws in Europe by changing the bore to . September 1979 saw a new camshaft with greater valve lift let air and exhaust gases have less resistance. Power output rose to . Torque remained at @ 2400 rpm. In November 1980 the MW style injection pump was replaced with the M type for non-North American engines. Engines were equipped with series wired loop type glow plugs up until 1980 when replaced by the much more reliable pencil type plugs (these had been already used in the OM617A since 1978). Vehicles sold to the North American market had exhaust gas recirculation equipment fitted.\n\nOM617.910\n\nCanister style oil filter at bottom front of engine. Power output was @ 4000 rpm and torque was @ 2400 rpm.\n\nApplications:\n\nOM617.912\n\nThis was introduced with the W123 series. Power originally was @ 4000 rpm, torque @ 2400 rpm. From September 1979 - @ 4400 rpm, torque @ 2400 rpm.\n\nApplications:\n\nOM617.913\n\nThis was an adaption of the .912 to the T1 chassis. It had a downward facing oil filter housing.\n\nOM617.931 and OM617.932\n\nThis engine was adapted from the .912 to fit the G Class, main difference being oil pan changes.\n\nApplications:\nThe year 1976 saw the engine adapted to use a turbocharger. This OM617LA was fitted to the C111-IID test vehicle, and set 16 world land speed and endurance records at the Nardo test facility in Italy. In 1978 the engine was upgraded again to and installed in the C111-IIID and broke 9 further records. Modifications for production engines included oil squirters to cool the underneath of the pistons; pistons with oil passages; stronger connecting rods; sodium filled valve stems and a stronger nitride-hardened crankshaft. Also an uprated oil pump with separate chain drive was fitted as the turbocharger lubrication required higher flow. Bosch MW injection pumps were calibrated for greater fuel output and fitted with an ALDA device which prevented overfueling until the turbocharger had begun to provide boost pressure. Pencil glow plugs were provided on all OM617A engines.\n\nOM617.950\n\nIn 1978, the OM617.950 was mated with the Mercedes-Benz W116 to produce the North American market-only 300SD, the world's first production turbodiesel sedan. These engines pre-dated the introduction of tighter emissions laws, so were not fitted with EGR. Power originally was @ 4200 rpm, torque @ 2400 rpm. From October 1979 - @ 4350 rpm, torque @ 2400 rpm.\n\nApplications:\n\nOM617.951\n\nThe .951 was introduced for 1981 and displaced , using a bore and stroke.

{"id": "1801750", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1801750", "title": "John Aaron Rawlins", "text": "John Aaron Rawlins\n\nJohn Aaron Rawlins (February 13, 1831 September 6, 1869) was a general officer in the Union Army during the American Civil War and a cabinet officer in the Grant administration. A longtime confidant of Ulysses S. Grant, Rawlins served on Grant's staff throughout the war, rising to the rank of brevet major general, and was Grant's chief defender against allegations of insobriety. He was appointed Secretary of War when Grant was elected President of the United States.\n\nRawlins was a self-made man who overcame an impoverished family background, scanty education, and an absentee father who was prone to drink. After studying law, Rawlins passed the bar in 1854 and started a practice in Galena, Illinois. He was a Douglas Democrat at the outbreak of the Civil War; a noted public speaker, he gave a notable pro-Union speech at the start of hostilities, and he soon became close friends with Ulysses S. Grant, a Galena resident, United States Military Academy graduate, and Mexican–American War veteran who had served in the Army for 11 years. Rawlins persuaded Grant to drill and muster a local volunteer militia company and send them to the state capital in Springfield so they could be inducted into federal service. After brief service in the Illinois militia as a mustering officer, Grant was soon recommissioned in the Army to serve under Union General John C. Frémont, commander of Union Army forces in the western United States. Rawlins also joined the Union Army and served primarily as an officer on Grant's staff; his promotions were linked to Grant's success on the battlefields and Grant's advancement in the Union Army under President Abraham Lincoln. Rawlins contracted tuberculosis in 1863, but continued to serve on Grant's staff during Reconstruction.\n\nAfter Grant won the 1868 election and assumed the presidency in March 1869, he named Rawlins as his Secretary of War. His brief tenure was controversial; he supported insurrection against Spanish rule in Cuba, established an anti-Mormon policy for the Utah Territory, and reduced the authority of General William Tecumseh Sherman, Grant's successor as commander of the Army. Rawlins' tuberculosis continued to worsen, and he died in September 1869, five months into his term. Except for a 1916 biography, \"The Life of John A. Rawlins\", by James Harrison Wilson, Rawlins' short life is not well known, while Grant, perhaps protecting his own reputation, rarely mentioned him in his popular \"Memoirs\", published in 1885. With Rawlins' death, strong cabinet-level support for an independent Cuba ended, and did not become a priority until the Spanish–American War in 1898.\n\nJohn Aaron Rawlins was born on February 13, 1831 in East Galena, Illinois, the second of 10 children born to James Dawson and Lovisa Collier Rawlins both of Scotch-Irish descent whose ancestors originally settled in Culpeper County, Virginia. James Rawlins was a descendant of Robert Rawlins, who originally settled in Maryland, and he became a farmer and charcoal maker in Missouri and Illinois.\n\nIn 1849, James Rawlins migrated to California during the Gold Rush, and he stayed for three years. While his father was absent, Rawlins became the primary caretaker of his mother, sister, and six brothers. James did not strike gold, and upon returning home he halfheartedly devoted his time to his family farm and timber lands, while John Rawlins took on increasing responsibility as the head of the family. Rawlins blamed his father James' carefree lifestyle and lack of attention to his family on strong drink. His father's behavior affected Rawlins' own attitudes and fears concerning alcohol, and he became a teetotaler. According to historian Bruce Catton, Rawlins' abstention was caused by his belief that if he took even one drink, he would not be able to stop.\n\nRawlins' early education was scanty; he attended local schools in Illinois and spent a year and a half at Rock River Seminary in Mount Morris, Illinois. Rawlins attracted notice locally as a \"self-made man\" by going through a period of self-directed study to make up for his lack of formal education. He then studied law in the office of Isaac P. Stevens of Galena, and attained admission to the bar in 1854. Rawlins practiced in partnership with Stevens, and later with David Sheean, who had studied under Rawlins. Politically Rawlins aligned himself with the Democratic Party and supported the presidential campaigns of Stephen A. Douglas.\n\nOn June 5, 1856, Rawlins married Emily Smith, daughter of Hiram Smith of Goshen, New York. Their marriage produced three children including son James, and daughters Jennie and Emily. Mrs. Rawlins died of tuberculosis in August, 1861, shortly after Rawlins began his service with the Union Army. According to historian Bruce Catton, her death left Rawlins with the fear he would one day die of the same disease. On December 23, 1863 Rawlins married Mary Emma Hurlburt, the daughter of S. A. Hurlburt of Danbury, Connecticut. During the Winter of 1863 Rawlins developed a persistent cough that was later diagnosed as tuberculosis.\n\nAfter Fort Sumter fell, at the outbreak of the American Civil War, Galena's residents held a town meeting; the featured speakers were U.S. Congressman Elihu B. Washburne and Rawlins. Rawlins made his pro-Union sentiments clear when he stated: \"\"I have been a Democrat all my life; but this is no longer a question of politics; It is simply country or no country; I have favored every honorable compromise; but the day for compromise is passed; only one course is left us. We will stand by the flag of our country, and appeal to the god of battles.\"\"\n\nIn 1861, Rawlins took an active role in the organization of the 45th Illinois Infantry, in response to President Abraham Lincoln's call for 75,000 volunteers, and Grant volunteered to help train the regiment. He was soon appointed commander of the 21st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment, and requested that Rawlins become his aide-de-camp. Rawlins accepted and on August 30 he was appointed a captain in the regular Army and Assistant Adjutant-General of Volunteers. On September 14, Rawlins reported to Grant's headquarters in Cairo. From this time forward, Rawlins remained by Grant's side and became Grant's most influential staff officer, advisor, and closest friend. Like most men at the beginning of the Civil War, Rawlins was not formally military trained, however, he was naturally suited for his position. As Grant rose in rank and responsibility, Rawlins was likewise promoted in roles of increasing responsibility and rank, including Chief of Staff of the Army of the Tennessee and Chief of Staff of the Military Division of the Mississippi. He was known for his great attention to detail, as well as being a stickler for proper protocol. On May 14, 1862 Rawlins was promoted to major, and on November 1 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. Just before joining his staff, he exacted a pledge from Grant, who had a history of alcohol problems, not to drink during the war. He forbade the use of alcohol at headquarters and a year after joining the staff signed a pledge himself not to consume alcohol. During the war, Rawlins frequently scolded Grant for perceived derelictions with an impunity that often surprised onlookers.\n\nRawlins was promoted to brigadier general of Volunteers on August 11, 1863. When Grant was promoted to general in chief of all the Union armies, Rawlins became Chief of Staff of the General Headquarters of the United States Army. He was promoted to brevet major general on February 24, 1865, to brigadier general in the regular army on March 3, and brevet major general in the regular army on April 9.\n\nIn the fall of 1862, Rawlins' law partner David Sheean, an outspoken critic of Lincoln's war policy, was arrested; he was an outspoken Democrat, and because habeas corpus had been suspended by President Abraham Lincoln in 1861, Sheean's Republican political enemies worked to have him detained without charges at Fort Lafayette, New York. Rawlins took a leave of absence to aid Sheean, and petitioned in person to both Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton and Congressman Elihu B. Washburne. Sheean was finally released in December, 1862.\n\nDuring the Vicksburg Campaign, on December 17, 1862, Grant issued General Order No. 11 expelling Jews, as a class, from Grant's military district. Grant was upset over an illegal cotton trade that Grant believed funded the Confederate Army. Grant blamed Jewish traders for breaking Treasury Department regulations. Jewish persons who did not obey the order were to be arrested and forcibly removed as prisoners. Rawlins, Grant's attorney and Asst. Adjt. Gen., strongly warned Grant not to issue the order. Grant refused to take Rawlin's advise concerning the order and told him: \"Well, they can countermand this from Washington if they like, but we will issue it anyhow.\" The controversial order was revoked by President Abraham Lincoln. \n\nDuring the Summer of 1863, Grant sent Rawlins east to Washington D.C. as his emissary. At this time Grant was relatively unknown in political circles, having fought far from Washington D.C. in the Western Theater. Rawlins arrived in Washington D.C. on July 30 and talked with General-In-Chief Henry W. Halleck at the War Department and the Army's assistant adjutant general, Colonel J.C. Kelton. Halleck cordially received Rawlins and told Rawlins he was pleased with Grant's victory and endorsed Grant's Vicksburg surrender terms, including releasing 31,000 Confederate prisoners on parole. Rawlins then went to the White House and met President Abraham Lincoln and his Cabinet. He handed Lincoln a letter from Grant that asked for Rawlins to be given an interview with Lincoln so Rawlins could brief him on the successful results of the Vicksburg Campaign and explain why the Confederate soldiers were paroled. Special observer Charles A. Dana and Secretary of Navy Gideon Welles gave Rawlins high praise for his industrious nature and his intelligence. Dana stated that Rawlins was a \"very industrious, conscientious man.\" Welles stated that he was pleased by Rawlin's \"frank, intelligent, and interesting description of men and of army operations.\"\n\nDuring the Chattanooga Campaign in November 1863, Grant was alleged to have been drinking excessively among other generals and subordinates who had access to bottles of whiskey and a bottle of wine received from Grant's mother Hannah. Rawlins heard of this, and considering himself to be Grant's protector when it came to alcohol, wrote him a letter on November 15 or 16, which was never sent; it demanded that Grant \"immediately desist from further tasting of liquors of any kind.\" Rawlins' concerns were unfounded; According to General David Hunter, who had the opportunity to observe Grant closely during this period, Grant had only two drinks in three weeks during the month of November. On November 14, Grant had actually broken up a drinking party between his subordinate Colonel Clark Lagow and Lagow's friends at four in the morning. Rawlins kept this unsent letter in his records, where it was later found by historians. This unsent letter was one of several items which created the impression that Grant routinely drank to excess.\n\nIn 1867, during Reconstruction, Rawlins accompanied the military escort that traveled with Grenville M. Dodge's expedition to explore the proposed route of the Union Pacific Railroad. Dodge was chief engineer for the Union Pacific, which was responsible for building the railroad from east to west, while the Central Pacific Railroad built from west to east. Rawlins had accompanied Dodge as far as Salt Lake City, Utah in hopes that the dry air of the plains would help cure his tuberculosis. Dodge later named one of the expedition's Wyoming campsites Rawlins; this site was later incorporated as a town. After four months of travel with Dodge, Rawlins returned to Washington D.C., but his health had not substantially improved.\n\nWhen Grant became President, Rawlins' doctors recommended that he go to Arizona, where they believed the dry desert climate would allow him to live longer. To accommodate their medical advice, Grant wanted to appoint Rawlins military commander of the Southwest; Rawlins refused, wishing to stay at Grant's side. Grant acquiesced and appointed Rawlins as Secretary of War. During his five months in office, Rawlins was at odds with Secretary of State Hamilton Fish over whether to recognize and support a revolution against the Spanish government in Cuba; Rawlins favored providing military aid and other assistance; Fish was opposed. Both competed for Grant's support and that of the other cabinet secretaries. Grant finally sided with Fish and the U.S did not intervene. On the question of dealing with the Mormons located primarily in Utah Territory, Rawlins convinced Grant to adopt a confrontational approach to ending their practice of polygamy, including the use of the military if necessary. Rawlins' health continued to deteriorate; he was bedridden before he died in office on September 6, 1869. One of his last acts as Secretary of War was his approval of the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge.\nWhen Grant became President he promoted William T. Sherman his friend and fellow general during the Civil War the top command of General of the Armies in March 1869. During this time General John M. Schofield was Grant's interim Secretary of War, a carry-over from the Andrew Johnson administration. Initially, Grant had given Sherman broad powers over the U.S. Military, including having authority over bureau chiefs, causing Sherman to believe his relationship to Grant during Grant's presidency would be the same as his close relationship to Grant during the Civil War. When Rawlins became Secretary of War his first actions were to significantly reduce General Sherman's authority in the U.S. military. Rawlins had requested to Grant to give him authority over bureau chiefs and Grant complied, knowing Rawlins was in ill health. Sherman hurried to the White House and asked that Grant rescind his orders that reduced Sherman's authority. Knowing that Rawlins was gravely ill Grant told Sherman that he would not rescind his orders. This upset Sherman, and after a disagreement over military and presidential protocol, Sherman stood up and walked out of the meeting saying \"Good day Mister President!\". Grant and Sherman had formerly been on first name familiarity. After this incident, Grant and Sherman were not on the same friendly manner they had been during the Civil War. Rawlins' successor, William W. Belknap, also continued this trend and reduced Sherman's authority in the U.S. military, taking away Sherman's authority to appoint post-trader commissions.\n\nIn 1869, Grant sent Rawlins to Utah Territory in hopes he would recover from his declining health and in part to observe the condition of Mormons there. This was Rawlins second time in Utah, having traveled with Dodge to Salt Lake City, in 1867. Rawlins was very cool to his reception of Mormons in Utah including Mormon leader Brigham Young, whom he met twice, who was surrounded by a Mormon military escort. Inwardly, Rawlins was hostile to Young and the Mormon polygamists. When Rawlins returned to Washington he convinced Grant to develop a harsh policy against the religious sect. Rawlins also convinced Grant to appoint J. Wilson Shaffer Governor of Utah Territory. Shaffer implemented a strict policy that was designed to keep the Mormons from rebelling from the United States. The Mormons, according to Grant, were in a militant state of rebellion over the issue of polygamy. Grant went on to arrest many Mormons, including Young, in a crackdown by federal marshals Grant believed would keep the Mormons from separating from the United States and to disrupt their practice of polygamy.\n\nIn 1868, the Cuban Revolution began when rebels on Cuba tried to overthrow Spanish rule. Many Americans rallied behind the rebellion and began to sell war bonds in support of the recognition of Cuban belligerency. In 1869, President Grant's Secretary of State Hamilton Fish was unwilling to support the Cuban rebels since the United States had recently gone through the Civil War. Also at stake was negotiations for settlement of the Alabama Claims, that included the claim the British had recognized Confederate belligerency during the Civil War. The recognition of Cuban belligerency would have jeopardized negotiations between Britain and the United States. Secretary Rawlins, however, was strongly in favor of the recognition of Cuban belligerency and even advocated war with Spain, if necessary. Rawlins went to the press and stated the reasons why the United States needed to aid the Cuban rebels. Rawlins himself had accepted $28,000 in Cuban War bonds that would have been given face value if the Cuban rebels were recognized by the United States. Political infighting over recognizing Cuban belligerency took place in Grant's Cabinet. Secretary Fish, however, was able to convince Grant over Rawlins' impassioned arguments not to intervene in the Cuban insurrection. At this time Rawlins was becoming increasingly ill and was confined to his bed.\n\nOne of Rawlins' last and most complicated acts as Secretary of War was the approval of the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge, a steel suspension bridge to connect the borough of Manhattan and the then independent city of Brooklyn over the East River. Controversy ensued when shipping interests demanded a high grade of the bridge to allow large ships to pass under, while the bridge construction company demanded a lower bridge span. Although Rawlins was severely ill he took several days minutely and carefully going over the construction plans to settle the matter. The bridge company desired a maximum 130 feet height while the shipping interests wanted a minimal 140 feet height. In front of both shipping and bridge representatives, Rawlins fixed the maximum height of the Brooklyn Bridge at 135 feet above the East's high water mark. The bridge company was prohibited from giving a different order of approval of the bridge's construction. Construction of the Brooklyn Bridge followed several months later, but Rawlins condition was terminal and he did not have long to live. The Brooklyn Bridge was finally completed in 1883 under much celebration and is one of the oldest working bridges in the United States.\n\nBy late August 1869, Rawlins' \"consumption\" had progressed, and while he was staying at his home in Danbury, Connecticut with his wife and children, he hemorrhaged. Called to the capital for a cabinet meeting, his wife and children stayed behind, while Rawlins set off for Washington. In New York, Rawlins hemorrhaged again, but he continued his journey to see the President. Making it to the capital he hemorrhaged again, but he made it to the cabinet meeting and sat at his regular chair. Grant and Secretary Fish were surprised to see him there. The next day Rawlins had a long meeting with Grant at the White House, whereupon Grant said goodbye to his friend, who left Washington for Saratoga to join his wife Julia. Rawlins was left alone without wife or family in Washington, but another close wartime friend and Native American, Ely Parker, cared for him. The following day, Sunday, September 5, Grant was informed of Rawlin's declining health, and he set back to Washington determined to see his friend before he died, but his trip was delayed. Sherman and Grant's Secretary of Interior Jacob D. Cox, stayed with Rawlins at his bedside waiting for Grant to arrive. When Rawlins asked when Grant was going to arrive Sherman gently lied to him and said \"about 10 minutes\". Rawlins, however, persisted on asking his doctor, D. Willard Bliss, when Grant was coming to see him.\n\nThe following day on Monday, September 6, 1869, Secretary of War Rawlins died in office at 4:12 PM. Grant arrived at Rawlins' at 5:15 PM, too late to see his friend. Historian William McFeely said concerning Grant missing Rawlins' death that no one \"could replace John Rawlins. Now in the first year of the frightening business of the presidency, Rawlins was stolen from Grant, and he had not even been on hand to protest the theft.\" Rawlins was initially buried in a friend's vault at Congressional Cemetery; his remains were later relocated to Section 2 Site Lot 1007 of Arlington National Cemetery. Rawlins was survived by his second wife Mary Hurlburt and two children. Rawlins was succeeded as Secretary of War by Sherman on an interim basis, and permanently by William W. Belknap.\n\nA statue, \"General John A. Rawlins\" was erected in Washington, D.C. in 1874.\nRawlins Township, Jo Daviess County, Illinois, the town of Rawlins, county seat of Carbon County, Wyoming, as well as Rawlins County, Kansas are all named after him.\n\nRawlins devoted his efforts to maintaining Grant's public image during the war. Grant was known before the war for trouble with alcoholism, but it was revealed, in a letter from Rawlins to Grant (which Grant never saw), that Grant maintained his sobriety during his command of the Army. In this letter, made public in 1891—several years after Grant's death—Rawlins wrote, \"I find you where the wine bottle has been emptied, in company with those who drink, and urge you not to do likewise.\" Rawlins noted that this advice was \"heeded, and all went well\", thus proving that Grant was not impaired by drink when his decision-making was critical.\n\nThere was speculation that by the time Rawlins died, he and Grant had grown distant and that Grant no longer needed Rawlins's constant fussing over his image. When Rawlins died, only his temporary successor as Secretary of War, General William Tecumseh Sherman, was at his bedside. In his memoirs, written shortly before his death, Grant only mentioned Rawlins a few times, and essentially ignored their professional and personal relationship. Surviving members of Grant's former staff were outraged at the fact that Grant would snub someone who had been so useful and as loyal to him—literally to the death—as Rawlins had been. The most likely explanation for this is given by historian E.B. Long, who wrote, \"It might be that Grant did not wish to praise Rawlins too profusely because of the current reports picturing Rawlins as the protector of Grant from his own bad habits.\"\n\nRawlins's anti-Mormon policy was part of a general latter half of the 19th-century hysteria campaign against Mormons. In 1862, President Abraham Lincoln signed into law the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act that outlawed polygamy. This law was not enforced until Secretary of War Rawlins, appointed by President Ulysses S. Grant in 1869, had convinced Grant to set up an anti-Mormon policy in the Utah Territory. To further prosecution of Mormon polygamy, including the arrest of Mormons, President Grant signed into law the Poland Act (1874) that allowed the federal government to choose juries that could prosecute polygamists. The law put all Mormons in the Utah Territory under control of the U.S. Marshal and U.S. Attorney. Two more anti-Mormon bills were passed including the Edmunds Act (1882), signed into law by President Chester A. Arthur, and the Edmunds–Tucker Act (1887), signed into law by President Grover Cleveland.\n\nAccording to the unofficial Arlington National Cemetery website, Rawlins \"was Grant's alter ego, discharging with objectivity the duties and responsibilities of intimate friend, military and political adviser, editor, and, on perhaps a few occasions, apostle of sobriety, although it would seem that he played this role far less than is popularly believed.\"\n\nAn Endicott Era coast artillery battery at Fort Flagler was named after Rawlins in 1906.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was Council President of Denmark for two months, from 16 August to 28 October 1909. He also served as Defence Minister of Denmark from 18 October to 28 October 1909. \n\nHolstein was the son of Count Christian Edzard Moritz (1809-1895) and Caroline Louise Lefeubre de Marpalu (1810-1903). He was a descendant of Danish Minister of state Johan Ludvig Holstein-Ledreborg (1694–1763). He became a student from Roskilde Cathedral School in 1859 and became a Cand.polit. from the University of Copenhagen in 1866. He took over the Ledreborg estate after his father's death in 1895. He rebuilt the chapel at Ledreborg and also had the buildings and the garden restored.\nFollowing the lack of a majority in the 1909 Folketing election, Klaus Berntsen suggested to Frederick VIII that Holstein may be able to gain the support of the three major liberal parties. The three Liberal groups settled on him as a prime minister, creating the first coalition after the establishment of the parliamentary system in Denmark. As prime minister, he formed a liberal cabinet with Jens Christian Christensen as defence minister, Niels Neergaard as finance minister, and Klaus Berntsen as minister of justice, and managed to form a compromise in the question of defence that satisfied the liberal parties, while still being acceptable to Højre.\n\nAs one of the few members of the Venstre Reform Party, the Danish Liberal party belonging to the nobility, Holstein was isolated by his colleagues and at the same time took a special position within \"Venstre\". He was considered an outstanding and varied speaker and as one of \"the five leaders of Venstre\" but already 1890 he gave up his political life devoting himself to his life as a squire on Zealand.\nAround two months into Holstein's term, conservative members of the Folketing called for a vote of no confidence in him, which failed. Shortly after, the Radical Democrats called for a vote of no confidence for his cabinet. This vote succeeded, marking the first time that a Danish cabinet was ousted by a vote of no confidence from the Folketing. He called upon the Radical Democrats to form a new cabinet because they instigated the vote to oust the old cabinet, and proceeded to resign.\n\nIn 1867 he married Ingeborg de Løvenørn (1842-1915). Holstein converted to Catholicism that same year which made him Denmark's first and, so far, only Roman Catholic Prime Minister.\n"}

Hong Kong literature reflects the area's unique history during the 20th century as a fusion of British colonial, Cantonese, and sea-trading culture. It has mainly been written in Vernacular Chinese (which is based on Mandarin Chinese) and, to a lesser extent, English.\n\nHong Kong fiction and performance (including Cantonese opera, television, plays, and film) are many and varied, though only a few film and theatrical works were widely known internationally until the late 20th and early 21st century. Hong Kong's \"wuxia\" () martial arts fiction is one of Hong Kong's most famous exports, and provided many internationally recognised films and televisions programmes during the latter half of the 20th century, almost single-handedly bringing Hong Kong literature out of relative obscurity towards a global audience.\n\nMany modern vernacular Chinese publications in Hong Kong have their origins in Chinese writers who fled from Communist and Nationalist fighting during the Chinese Civil War. A significant number of Chinese intellectuals and artists moved to Hong Kong between 1927 and 1937. Many of these people viewed themselves as outsiders in the Hong Kong community, and often wrote of the \"barbaric\" and \"strange\" practices of the southern Chinese people (a view evident even in the Tang dynasty). A second wave of writers came to Hong Kong in 1949 after the Communist Party of China's victory in the Chinese Civil War. While some in this second wave expressed the intention to \"Northernise\" Hong Kong, many of them began to recognise the valuable traditions that existed in local Hong Kong culture, and their efforts to preserve these traditions helped shape Hong Kong's literary landscape.\n\nBecause Hong Kong was a British colony for nearly all of the 20th century, it was spared the harsh censorship that the People's Republic of China and Taiwan endured at the hands of their political leaders. Hong Kong's literature and arts developed quite freely throughout the 20th century. After 1950, two general literary trends took form: the first, dubbed the \"Greenback Culture\" () sought to make itself appealing to contemporary American culture and consumers; the second, called the \"Left Wing\" (), opposed the \"Greenback\" style. Hong Kong literature flourished domestically under these two different styles.\n\nUntil 1950, modern literature in Hong Kong was dominated by writers who had fled fighting in northern China, and vestiges of their influence were still present in Hong Kong literature until around 1970. These writers fell into three main categories:\n\nIn addition to Vernacular Chinese writing, there is also a smaller body of literature in English. Notable Hong Kong English language writers include Stewart Sloan, Nury Vittachi, Colin McAdam (novelist), Rebecca Bradley, Larry Feign and Alan Jefferies.\n\n"}

It flows northwest through the Coastal Range to the Pacific Ocean. The main stem of the Navarro River begins less than south of the town of Philo at the confluence of Rancheria Creek and Anderson Creek. The mouth of the Navarro is south of the city of Mendocino. State Route 128 starts from the intersection of State Route 1 at the mouth of the Navarro River, and follows the river valley upstream to Philo. The river is close to the highway through the lower canyon but is some distance south of the highway as the Anderson Valley widens upstream of Wendling.\n\nThe river provides wildlife habitat including cold freshwater habitat for fish migration and spawning. It also provides recreation and navigation including of whitewater suitable for rafting and kayaking upstream of Rancheria Creek. Near Philo the river runs through Hendy Woods State Park, a state park of more than , featuring two virgin redwood stands. Near the coast the river runs through Navarro River Redwoods State Park. The river recharges groundwater for agricultural and industrial water supply for residents living along the western portion of California State Route 128. Its watershed includes the Anderson Valley, a well-known wine-growing region in Mendocino County.\n\nPrior to colonial contact, the Navarro River watershed fed water sources for Northern California Native communities, including the Pomo people, who relied on salmon and riparian vegetation for cultural and subsistence practices. In 1848-1850, the California Gold Rush brought non-native settlers to the valley who forced the Pomo people up the Eel River northward to Round Valley Reservation, in an approximately 40 mile forced march known as Bloody Run, so called because the river ran red with blood.\n\nA sawmill was constructed at the mouth of the river in 1861. The mill was capable of cutting of lumber per day by 1883. A railroad extended upriver to bring logs to the mill. The original mill burned in 1890 and a replacement bandsaw mill burned in 1902. A replacement sawmill was built near Wendling on the North Fork Navarro River and operated until September, 1927. The Wendling sawmill operation included logging railway branches along the North Fork connecting over Keen's Summit to shipping facilities at Albion via an isolated segment of the Northwestern Pacific Railroad. Rail service was discontinued in 1930 and the railway was dismantled for scrap in 1937.\n\n"}

Norton. It is the sequel to the 1973 film \"American Graffiti\". Whereas the first film followed a group of friends during the summer evening before they set off for college, this film shows where they end up a few years later.\n\nMost of the main cast members from the first film returned for the sequel, including Candy Clark, Ron Howard, Paul Le Mat, Cindy Williams, Mackenzie Phillips, Charles Martin Smith, Bo Hopkins, and Harrison Ford. Richard Dreyfuss was the only principal cast member from the original film not to appear in the sequel. It was the final live-action theatrical film in which Ron Howard would play a credited, named character.\n\nThe film, set over the course of four consecutive New Year's Eves from 1964 to 1967, depicts scenes from each of these years, intertwined with one another as though events happen simultaneously. The audience is protected from confusion by the use of a distinct cinematic style for each section. For example, the 1966 sequences echo the movie of Woodstock using split screens and multiple angles of the same event simultaneously on screen, the 1965 sequences (set in Vietnam) shot hand-held on grainy super 16 mm film designed to resemble war reporters' footage. The film attempts to memorialize the 1960s with sequences that recreate the sense and style of those days with references to Haight-Ashbury, the , the beginnings of the modern woman's liberation movement and the accompanying social revolt. One character burns his draft card, showing a younger audience what so many Americans had done on the television news ten years before the movie's release. Other characters are shown frantically disposing of their marijuana before a traffic stop as a police officer pulls them over, and another scene shows the police brutality during an anti-Vietnam protest.\n\nThe fates of the main characters listed at the end of \"American Graffiti\" are updated at the end of this sequel. \n\nWolfman Jack briefly reprised his role, but in voice only. The drag racing scenes were filmed at the Fremont Raceway, later Baylands Raceway Park (now the site of automobile dealerships), in Fremont, California.\n\n\nThe movie was written and directed by Bill L. Norton who was picked by Lucas as being suitable due to his California upbringing and experience with comedy. Lucas was involved in the production by acting as the executive producer, editing both Norton's screenplay and the finished motion picture, and even manning a camera for sequences set in the Vietnam War.\n\nIt was released on VHS and LaserDisc in 1979 or 1980. It was released on DVD in September 2003 and once more as a double feature with \"American Graffiti\" (1973) in January 2004. It was released on Digital in 2011. It was released on Blu-ray for Europe in May 2012 and for North America in June 2018.\n\nThe film also featured a 24-track soundtrack featuring music from the movie along with voice-over tracks of Wolfman Jack. The soundtrack is out of print and has never been released on CD.\n\nA fictional band named Electric Haze featuring Doug Sahm appears in the film, most notably performing the Bo Diddley song \"I'm a Man\".\n\nAn earlier album, also titled \"More American Graffiti,\" was an official album sequel to the first soundtrack to \"American Graffiti\". The album (MCA 8007) was released in 1975, four years before the film sequel of the same name was released. While only one of the songs in this album was actually used in the 1973 motion picture, this collection was compiled and approved by George Lucas for commercial release. In 1976, MCA Records released a third and final Various Artists double album set titled: \"American Graffiti Vol. III\" (MCA 8008). Unlike the first two albums, \"American Graffiti Vol. III\" does not include dialogue with Wolfman Jack.\n\n\"More American Graffiti\" opened on August 3, 1979. The Numbers cites the gross at $8.1 million, and Box Office Mojo at $15 million. Despite its minor box office success, its gross was nowhere near as high as that of \"American Graffiti\", even though Ron Howard, Cindy Williams and Harrison Ford were bigger stars (due to their major roles in the TV hits \"Happy Days\" and \"Laverne & Shirley\" and the film \"Star Wars\") in 1979 than they had been in 1973.\n\nThe film received negative reviews from critics, in contrast to the critical acclaim received by its predecessor. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 20% of critics were positive based on 10 reviews.\n\nJanet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" called it \"grotesquely misconceived, so much so that it nearly eradicates fond memories of the original ... The times — the story is scattered like buckshot from 1964 to 1967 — have grown dangerous, but these people haven't awakened at all. They're still the same fun-loving rock-and-rollers, and there's nothing they can't trivialize. So here is a comic look at campus rioting. Here are the beach party aspects of the Vietnam War.\" Dale Pollock of \"Variety\" stated in his review that \"\"More American Graffiti\" may be one of the most innovative and ambitious films of the last five years, but by no means is it one of the most successful ... without a dramatic glue to hold the disparate story elements together, \"Graffiti\" is too disorganized for its own good, and the cross-cutting between different film styles only accentuates the problem.\" Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" gave the film 2 stars out of 4 and called it \"one long confusing movie\" that is \"really too ambitious for its own good.\" On \"Sneak Previews\", Roger Ebert said he thought it was a \"much better film\" than Siskel did, that he \"had no trouble following it\" and that \"it's a film worth seeing.\"\n\nCharles Champlin of the \"Los Angeles Times\" was also positive, writing that \"the protagonists are affecting as before and 'More American Graffiti' is an uncommonly evocative trip back to our common past—a stirring reminder in both style and substance of what we've been through.\" Gary Arnold of \"The Washington Post\" wrote \"All this fussy, arbitrary switching of scenes, years and aspect ratios may wow them back in film school, but the complicated framework reveals nothing but one inconsequential or misleading vignette after another. Norton doesn't achieve a true dramatic convergence of parallel stories; and his historical vision is confined to cheerleading reaffirmations of all the old counterculture cliches about war, cops, Women's Liberation, you name it.\" Veronica Geng of \"The New Yorker\" called the film \"a mess of time shifts and pointless, confusing split-screen techniques that make the images look dinky instead of multiplying their impact. For as busy a movie I have seen, it is visually one of the most boring. Norton trades in the grammar of moving pictures for a formula that says the sixties equals fragmentation equals split screen—and split screen we get; baby's first jigsaw puzzles of simultaneous action, until we long for a simple cut from a moving car to a closeup of the driver.\" David Ansen of \"Newsweek\" wrote \"This is all very film-school fancy, but what does it mean? Alas, precious little. 'More' in this case is decidedly less. Once you get used to the cross-cutting — which is rather like switching channels between four different TV shows — the realization dawns that none of the segments is particularly interesting.\"\n\nLucas reflected on the experience in 1997 during the production of \"\", remarking to Frank Oz: \"You just never know on these things. I did a \"More American Graffiti\"; it made ten cents. Just failed miserably.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "1801793", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1801793", "title": "Hall's Pictorial Weekly", "text": "Hall's Pictorial Weekly\n\nHall's Pictorial Weekly was an Irish satirical television series broadcast on Raidió Teilifís Éireann from 1971 to 1980. Regarded as RTÉ's flagship comedy show, it featured satirical sketches on current news stories, politics and popular culture, as well as parody songs, comedy sketches, re-edited videos, cartoons and spoof television formats. The show was written, presented and edited by Frank Hall and featured a cast including Frank Kelly and Eamon Morrissey.\n\n\"Hall's Pictorial Weekly\" had its origins in the daily regional news magazine \"Newsbeat\", which ran between 1964 and 1971. The programme was noted for concentrating on colourful characters and off-beat reportage, as well as occasional comedy sketches. According to Hall, it occurred to him one day that he would be much more the master of the situation if he simply sat at home and wrote sketches, instead of looking for stories around the country.\n\nThe first episode of \"Hall's Pictorial Weekly\" aired on 29 September 1971. Set in the offices of a mythical provincial newspaper in the fictional town of Ballymagash, it initially continued to cover offbeat regional news in the manner of \"Newsbeat\", but gradually gave over more time towards comedy sketches and parodies.\n\nIn testament to the show's popularity, the term \"Ballymagash-style politics\" quickly became common parlance as a shorthand way of describing the type of \"parish-pump\" politics which became one of its key satirical targets.\n\n\"Hall's Pictorial Weekly\" was at its strongest during the 1973–1977 term of the Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition government. So sharp and constant was its satirical send up of the government ministers of the time, that it is generally accepted that the programme played an important part in bringing the coalition into disrepute and perhaps even contributed to bringing it down. Ireland at the time had a very volatile economic situation and the show spared no political expense in portraying the then Taoiseach, Liam Cosgrave, as the \"Minister for Hardship,\" while the Minister for Finance, Richie Ryan, was portrayed as \"Richie Ruin\".\n\nThe show also portrayed the former Taoiseach Jack Lynch (played by Frank Kelly) as a rather benign pipe-smoking figure. The political party he led, Fianna Fáil, was also lampooned as being called \"Feel and Fall\". Charles Haughey was parodied as \"Charlie Hawkeye\".\n\nIn April 1980, RTÉ decided not to go ahead with the planned tenth series of \"Hall's Pictorial Weekly\" due for transmission in the following May and June. Effectively the show was axed, although no clear statement about the programme's demise was made by the broadcaster.\n\nIn 2004, a DVD featuring highlights from the series was released under the title, \"The Very Best of Hall's Pictorial Weekly (Vol 1)\". A second volume \"The Very Best of Hall's Pictorial Weekly (Vol 2)\" was released a few years later.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1801795", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1801795", "title": "Catholic Church in Croatia", "text": "Catholic Church in Croatia\n\nThe Catholic Church in Croatia () is part of the worldwide Catholic Church that is under the spiritual leadership of the Pope, Roman Curia and the Croatian Bishops' Conference. Its administration is centered in Zagreb, and it comprises five archdioceses, 13 dioceses and one military ordinariate. Cardinal Josip Bozanić is the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Zagreb.\n\nThere are an estimated 3.7 million baptized Latin Catholics and about 20,000 baptized Greek Catholics in Croatia, comprising 86.3% of the population, according to the 2011 census. Weekly Church attendance is relatively high compared to other Catholic nations in Europe, being around 27%. The national sanctuary of Croatia is in Marija Bistrica, while the country's patron is Saint Joseph since the Croatian Parliament declared him to be in 1687.\n\nThe western part of the Balkan Peninsula was conquered by the Roman Empire by 168 BC after a long drawn out process known as the Illyrian Wars.\n\nFollowing their conquests, the Romans organised the area into the province of Illyricum, which was eventually split up into Dalmatia and Pannonia. Through being part of the Roman Empire, various religious cults were brought into the region. This included the Levantine-originated religion of Christianity.\n\nIndeed, Salona, a Greek-founded city close to modern Split, was one of the earliest places in the region connected with Christianity. It was able to gain influence first among some of the Dalmatian Jews living in the city. St. Titus, a disciple of St. Paul the Apostle and the subject of the \"Epistle to Titus\" in the New Testament, was active in Dalmatia. Indeed, in the \"Epistle to the Romans\", Paul himself speaks of visiting \"Illyricum\", but he may have meant Illyria Graeca.\n\nThe Croats arrived in the area of present-day Croatia during the early part of the 7th century AD. They came in touch with the Christian natives and started to slowly accept Christianity. Byzantine and Frankish missionaries and Benedictines who were bringing Western cultural influences had a significant role in the christening of Croats.\n\nCroats had their first contact with the Holy See in year 641 when the papal envoy Abbot Martin came to them in order to redeem Christian captives and the bones of the martyrs that Croats were keeping. There is little information about the \"Baptism of the Croats\", but it is known that it was peacefully and freely accepted, and that it took place between the 7th and the 9th century.\n\nByzantine emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus wrote in his book De Administrando Imperio that the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius, during whose reign Croats came to the land between Drava river and the Adriatic Sea (present-day Croatia), \"brought priests from Rome who he made into archbishop, bishop, priests and deacons, which then baptized Croats.\"\n\nHistorical sources mention the christening of Croatian rulers Porga, Vojnomir, Višeslava, Borna, Ljudevit Posavski and others.\n\nBy the 9th century, Croats have already been fully included in a large European Christian community. Croatian rulers Mislav (around 839), Trpimir I (852) and many others were building churches and monasteries. In 879, Croatian duke Branimir wrote a letter to Pope John VIII in which he promised him loyalty and obedience. Pope John VIII replied with a letter on 7 June 879, in which he wrote that he celebrated a Mass at the tomb of St Peter on which he invoked God's blessing on Branimir and his people.\n\nIn 925, Croatian King Tomislav was corresponding with Pope John X on the occasion of the first Church Council of Split. The pope's letter to the King Tomislav is the first international document in which a Croatian ruler was called \"rex\" (King); that is why Tomislav is considered to be the first Croatian king.\n\nKing Demetrius Zvonimir was crowned on 8 October 1076 at Solin in the Basilica of Saint Peter and Moses (known today as the Hollow Church) by Gebizon, a representative of Pope Gregory VII.\n\nZvonimir took an oath of allegiance to Pope, by which he promised his support in the implementations of the Church reforms in Croatia. After the Papal legate crowned him, Zvonimir in 1076 gave the Benedictine monastery of Saint Gregory in Vrana to the Pope as a sign of loyalty and as an accommodation for papal legates coming to Croatia.\n\nWhen Croatia lost its own dynasty and entered into a personal union with Hungary in 1102, the Benedictines were slowly dying out, while the mendicant orders, especially Franciscans and Dominicans were becoming more important. Religious and cultural formation of Croats was also strongly influenced by Jesuits. Church writers from northern Croatia and Dubrovnik, which was a free center of the Croatian culture, have done a lot for standardization and expansion of the Croatian literary language.\n\nSince the 9th century there is in Croatia a unique phenomenon in the entire world of Catholicism, liturgy that was held in Church Slavonic language with special Glagolitic script (Pope was allowing serving liturgy only in Latin). Despite the various disputes, Pope Innocent IV approved use of Church Slavonic language and the Glagolitic script to Filip, bishop of Senj, thus making Croats the only Latin Catholics in the world allowed to use a language other than Latin in their liturgy prior to the Second Vatican Council in 1962.\n\nDuring the Croatian–Ottoman Wars that lasted from 15th to 19th century Croats strongly fought against the Turks which resulted in the fact that the westernmost border of the Ottoman Empire and Europe became entrenched on the soil of the Croatian Kingdom. In 1519, Croatia was called the \"Antemurale Christianitatis\" by Pope Leo X.\n\nThe Austrian Empire signed a concordat with the Holy See in 1855 which regulated the Catholic Church within the empire.\n\nIn Yugoslavia, the Croatian bishops were part of the Bishops' Conference of Yugoslavia.\n\nIn 1941, a Nazi puppet state, so-called Independent State of Croatia (NDH), was established by the fascist dictator Ante Pavelić and his Ustaše movement. The Ustaša regime pursued a genocidal policy against the Serbs (who were Eastern Orthodox Christians), Jews and Romani.\n\nHistorian Michael Phayer wrote that the creation of the NDH was initially welcomed by the hierarchy of the Catholic Church and by many Catholic priests. Ante Pavelić was anti-Serb and pro-Catholic, viewing Catholicism as an integral part of Croat culture.\n\nBritish writer Peter Hebblethwaite wrote that Pavelić was anxious to get diplomatic relations and a Vatican blessing for the new 'Catholic state' but that \"neither was forthcoming\".\n\nThe Archbishop of Zagreb, Aloysius Stepinac, wanted Croatia's independence from the Serb dominated Yugoslav state which he considered to be \"\"the jail of the Croatian nation\"\", so he arranged the audience with Pius XII for Pavelić.\n\nVatican under Secretary of State Giovanni Montini (later Pope Paul VI)'s minutes before the meeting noted that no recognition of the new state could come before a peace treaty and that \"The Holy See must be impartial; it must think of all; there are Catholics on all sides to whom the [Holy See] must be respectful.\"\n\nThe Vatican refused formal recognition of NDH but Pius XII sent a Benedictine abbot Giuseppe Ramiro Marcone as his apostolic visitor. Pius was criticized for his reception of Pavelić but he still hoped that Pavelić would defeat communist Partisans and reconvert many of the 200,000 who had left the Catholic Church for the Serbian Orthodox Church since World War I.\n\nMany Croatian nationalist clergy supported the Pavelić's regime push to drive out Serbs, Gypsies and Jews, or force their conversion to Catholicism. Despite that, Pavelić told Nazi Foreign Minister von Ribbentrop that while the lower clergy supported the Ustaše, the bishops, and particularly Archbishop Stepinac, were opposed to the movement because of \"Vatican international policy\".\n\nPhayer wrote that Stepinac came to be known as \"judenfreundlich\" (\"Jew friendly\") to the Nazi-linked Ustaše regime, and suspended a number of priest collaborators in his diocese.\n\nArchbishop Stepinac made many public statements criticizing developments in the NDH. On Sunday, 24 May 1942, to the irritation of Ustaša officials, he used the pulpit and a diocesan letter to condemn genocide in specific terms, although not mentioning Serbs:\n\nHe also wrote a letter directly to Pavelić on 24 February 1943, stating:\n\nThirty-one priests were arrested following Stepinac's July and October 1943 explicit condemnations of race murders being read from pulpits across Croatia. Martin Gilbert wrote that Stepinac, \"\"who in 1941 had welcomed Croat independence, subsequently condemned Croat atrocities against both Serbs and Jews, and himself saved a group of Jews\"\".\n\nThe Yugoslav Partisans executed two priests, Petar Perica and Marijan Blažić, as collaborationists on the island of Daksa on 25 October 1944. The Partisans killed Fra Maksimilijan Jurčić near Vrgorac in late January 1945.\n\nThe National Anti-Fascist Council of the People's Liberation of Croatia (ZAVNOH) originally foresaw a greater degree of religious freedom in the country. In 1944 ZAVNOH still left open the possibility of religious education in schools.\n\nThis idea was scuttled after Yugoslav leader Josip Broz removed secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Croatia Andrija Hebrang and replaced him with hardliner Vladimir Bakarić.\n\nIn 1945, the retired bishop of Dubrovnik, Josip Marija Carević, was murdered by Yugoslav authorities. Bishop Josip Srebrnić was sent to jail for two months. After the war, the number of Catholic publications in Yugoslavia decreased from one hundred to only three.\n\nIn 1946, the Communist regime introduced the \"Law on State Registry Books\" which allowed the confiscation of church registries and other documents. On 31 January 1952, the communist regime officially banned all religious education in public schools.\n\nThat year the regime also expelled the Catholic Faculty of Theology from the University of Zagreb, to which it was not restored until democratic changes in 1991.\n\nIn 1984, the Catholic Church held a National Eucharistic Congress in Marija Bistrica.\n\nThe central mass held on September 9 was attended by 400,000 people, including 1100 priests, 35 bishops and archbishops, as well as five cardinals. The mass was led by cardinal Franz König, a friend of Aloysius Stepinac from their early studies. In 1987 the Bishops' Conference of Yugoslavia issued a statement calling on the government to respect the right of parents to obtain a religious education for their children.\n\nAfter Croatia declared its independence from Yugoslavia, the Catholic Church regained its full freedom and influence.\n\nDuring the Croatian War of Independence Catholicism and Orthodoxy were often cited as a basic division between Croats and Serbs, which led to a massive destruction of churches (some 1,426 were destroyed or damaged).\n\nIn the Republic of Croatia, the Catholic Church has defined its legal position as autonomous in some areas, thus making it able to: provide religious education in state primary and secondary schools to those students who choose it, establish Catholic schools and conduct pastoral care among the Catholics in the armed forces and police.\n\nThrough the ratification of treaties between the Holy See and Croatia on 9 April 1997, treaties that regulate legal issues, cooperation in education and culture, conducting pastoral care among the Catholics in the armed forces and police and financing Church from the state budget came into force. As regards to financing, the Church has received the following amounts of money over the last decade: 2001; 461.3 bln kunas, 2004-2007; 532 bln kunas, 2008-2011;475.5 bln kunas, 2012-2013; 523.5 bln kunas, plus around 200 million kunas per each year for teachers of religious studies in schools, around 60 million kunas for maintenance churches which are considered to be a cultural heritage etc.\n\nCatholic Church in Croatia is very active in social and political life. The church has implemented a number of actions in conservative spirit in order to promote its values such as: non-working Sunday, punishment of the crimes of the communist era, introducing religious education in schools, protection of marriage as the union of a man and a woman (2013 referendum), opposition to abortion (campaign: \"Protecting human life from conception to natural death\"), opposition to euthanasia, opposition to natural methods of family planning and the treatment of infertility, and opposition to artificial birth control methods.\n\nWith Croatian independence, the Croatian Bishops' Conference was formed. The Croatian Bishops' Conference established Croatian Catholic Radio in 1997.\n\nThe published data from the 2011 Croatian census included a crosstab of ethnicity and religion which showed that a total of 3,697,143 Catholic believers (86.28% of the total population) was divided between the following ethnic groups:\n\nWithin Croatia the hierarchy consists of:\n\nThe bishops are organized into the Croatian Conference of Bishops, which is presided by the Archbishop of Zadar Mons. Želimir Puljić.\n\nThere are also historical bishoprics, including:\n\nAs of 2009, there were 1570 Catholic parishes in Croatia.\n\nThere are three Franciscan provinces in the country:\n\n\nAlthough the vast majority of Croatians declare themselves as Catholics, many of them do not follow the Church's teaching on moral and social issues. According to a Pew Research poll from 2017, only 27% of respondents attend mass regularly, 25% support the Church's stance on contraception, 43% support the Church's stance on ordination of women and 38% think abortion should be illegal in most cases. On the other hand, 66% support the Church's stance on same-sex marriage.\n\nThe Catholic Church in Croatia is criticised by some for promoting and tolerating neo-fascism among its ranks:\n\nEach year in December, the Catholic church in Croatia holds the annual memorial mass dedicated to Ustasha fascist dictator Ante Pavelić in Zagreb and Split. These mass are known to attract groups of Pavelić's supporters dressed in clothes with ustasha insignia.\n\nDuring the funeral of convicted ustasha WWII concentration camp commander Dinko Šakić, priest Vjekoslav Lasić said that \"every honest Croat should be proud of Šakić's name\" and that \"court which convicted Šakić, also convicted Croatia its people\". These statements were strongly condemned by Simon Wiesenthal Center and Croatian Helsinki Committee.\n\nCroatian president Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović was criticised live on TV, by Croatian friar Luka Prcela for saying that the Independent State of Croatia was a criminal state and was n't independent. Prcela said that the Independent State of Croatia \"never killed anyone outside its own borders\" and that former two left-wing presidents of Croatia were \"anti-Croatian\".\n\nBishop of city of Sisak, Vlado Košić was one of the signatories of a petition for the introduction of the fascist ustasha movement salute Za dom spremni to the official use in the Croatian Armed Forces.\n\nOn July 1, 2017, don Anđelko Kaćunko held a memorial mass for Ustasha Black Legion commander Jure Francetić on which he described Francetić as \"a patriot who was willing to give his life for the homeland\".\n\nOn July 2, 2017, media published a picture of a Croatian Catholic priest posing for a picture with a group of young boys on a children’s football tournament in Široki Brijeg, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Their team was named \"The Black Legion\" and boys were all wearing black T-shirts, thus alluding to notorious ustasha militia of the same name.\n\nOn September 2, 2017, while holding a mass near the town of Sinj, friar Božo Norac Kljajo equalized \"Za dom spremni\" and \"Praised be Jesus\" by saying that these are \"both good intentioned, human and ancient Christian salutes which don't hold a single drop of hate or vengeance.\"\n\nUpon the death of Slavko Goldstein, a prominent Croatian writer and publisher of Jewish origin, Mili Plenković, pastor of Hvar, published a Facebook post in which he expressed that he was \"happy upon hearing the news that Goldstein died\" because according to him: \"yet another hater of Croatia vanished from this world\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1801805", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1801805", "title": "Stronghold (2001 video game)", "text": "Stronghold (2001 video game)\n\nStronghold is a historic real-time strategy game developed by Firefly Studios in 2001. The game focuses primarily on conquest and expansion through military pursuits but also has prominent economic and infrastructure development elements. There is both an economic and a military campaign to be played and both are discussed in the game manual. In the English version, the game takes place in Medieval Britain around the time of 1066; however, since there is not always a time limit, scenarios can continue hundreds of years beyond that date.\n\nAs well as earning many favourable reviews from reviewers such as \"PC Gamer\" and GameSpy, the game continues to boast a large community, who edit and create various material through the in-game Map Editor/Scenario Creator.\n\n\"Stronghold\" was a commercial success, with global sales above 1.5 million units by 2004. Because of its popularity, the game spawned several sequels: \"\" (2002), \"Stronghold 2\" (2005), \"Stronghold Legends\" (2006), \"\" (2008), \"Stronghold 3\" (2011), \"Stronghold Kingdoms\" (2012) and \"Stronghold Crusader II\" (2014).\n\nIn Stronghold, the player takes the role of a lord in a kingdom. The goal is to create a stable economy and a strong military to defend against invaders, destroy enemy castles and accomplish the mission objectives.\n\nStronghold contains several modes of gameplay, with both combat and economic missions. The main game mode is the military campaign, which is based upon a map of England. The backstory to the campaign explains that the King was captured and held for ransom while invading a neighboring barbarian kingdom. Four Lords take control of the Kingdom, dividing it into their personal territories. The player is represented by a young, inexperienced commander, whose father is killed in an ambush by one of the villains. He is helped by two lords remaining loyal to the king. The player has to regain control of the Kingdom by reconquering counties from rival lords one by one. The player has to defeat each of the four Lords in the campaign, receiving help from the King once he has been successfully ransomed mid-game. An economic campaign is set after the main campaign, where the player re-constructs parts of the Kingdom. The player is set goals to complete against a variety of obstacles, such as bandits and fire.\n\nOther game modes are single mission combat and economic scenarios, where the player has to complete either military or economic goals. A Siege mode is included in the game, where the player may attack or defend several historical castles. Free build mode is another game mode; here the player has the option of building a castle without any objectives. More scenarios can be created for the game using the built-in map editor.\n\n\"Stronghold\" does not use a rock paper scissors system for game balance, instead opting for a \"soft-counter\" system.\n\nCombat in \"Stronghold\" is based on a strength and hit point system. There are a variety of unit types in the game, with each successive unit being stronger, and hence more expensive, than the preceding unit, in general. Even though the expensive units are stronger in combat, all units have abilities that are necessary to defend the castle, both melee units (such as the basic spearman and the stronger swordsman), and ranged units such as archers. The game also contains support troops such as engineers, who provide additional combat options such as constructing siege engines. Unlike some other strategy games there are no counters for units, and units do not take up space, allowing them to overlap each other. Several non-combat characters can fight against enemy units, although most have no ability to fight. Injured soldiers remain injured for the rest of the game—there is no healing system—and since the Lord is the central figurehead of the player's kingdom, despite being a powerful fighter, should he die, the game is automatically lost.\n\nFire plays a main role in the \"Stronghold\" storyline, as in certain missions, igniting pitch is almost necessary for survival. Also, there are certain trigger events that start fires. Fires spread very quickly, and a flaming building can ignite people or other buildings. Fires will only go out if all sources of fuel are consumed, or if the fire itself is extinguished by fire watches. Fires can spread over small boundaries of water.\n\nIn most RTS games, fire appears on buildings as an indicator of damage; for example, if a building is damaged enough it would catch fire, but not necessarily sustain damage from that fire. In some games, such as Starcraft, some buildings damaged to a certain extent will catch fire and continue to take damage from it until they are repaired or the fire destroys them. In \"Stronghold\", buildings that are damaged by siege weapons or are torn down would not catch fire; instead, they lose hit points until they collapse, with the indication of damage being visible signs of cracks and damage throughout the building. However, boiling oil pots, if destroyed, would start a small fire where they were built.\n\nContrary to many RTS titles, where fire plays a secondary, \"eye candy\" role, fire in Stronghold is an actual gameplay element. For instance, the player is subtly encouraged to build wells against enemies that like to use fire attacks.\n\nAn in-game map editor was included with the game. Rather than incorporating a proprietary scripting language, the editor has a WYSIWYG interface designed for use by all users.\n\n\"Stronghold\" was a commercial success, with global sales of 1.5 million units by 2004. It received a \"Silver\" signification from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), for at least 100,000 copies sold in the United Kingdom.\n\nOn Media Control's sales chart for the German market, \"Stronghold\" launched at #1 among computer games for the month of October 2001. The Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD) presented it with a \"Gold\" award in late 2001, indicating sales of at least 100,000 units across Germany, Austria and Switzerland. By the end of the year, the committee upgraded it to a \"Platinum\" status for 200,000 sales. \"Stronghold\" remained in Media Control's top 30 consistently through May 2002, placing 14th that month and 10th in April. After a 19th-place finish in June, it dropped to 27th in July, while its new \"Stronghold Deluxe\" edition debuted that month at #12. \"Deluxe\" proceeded to place seventh and 13th in August and September 2002, respectively.\n\nIn the United States, \"Stronghold\" debuted at #6 on NPD Intelect's computer game sales rankings for the week of October 21. Holding the position in its second week, it placed 15th for the month of October overall. It was absent from NPD's weekly top 10 by its third week of release. \"Stronghold\" ultimately sold 220,000 copies and earned $7.8 million in the United States by August 2006. At the time, this led \"Edge\" to declare it the country's 95th-best-selling computer game released since January 2000.\n\nCarla Harker reviewed the PC version of the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \"Both sim and strategy players will find something to like in \"Stronghold\", whether it's a long military campaign or just creating the largest, most well-run castle ever.\"\n\nThe game received \"favorable\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. The graphics were praised by a number of reviewers; GameSpot said of the graphics, \"The buildings look good, but not great, and the same can be said of the units\", adding that \"The animations are well done.\" IGN disagreed to a degree, saying \"Animations are a bit choppy\", and commented on the overall state of the graphics: \"This isn't the prettiest game ever by a longshot, but it's good enough that your eyes won't burn.\" GameZone gave high praise to the graphics, saying that the environments were \"wonderful\" and commenting on the good animation of the characters.\n\nGameSpot did not say much on sound, but noted that the \"Soundtrack is dramatic.\" GameSpy was neutral on its review of sound, saying that \"...the music is nice, if not especially memorable\", but also commenting on the \"poor voice acting.\"\n\n\"Stronghold\" was a nominee for \"Computer Gaming World\"s 2001 \"Best Strategy Game\" award, which ultimately went to \"\". The editors called \"Stronghold\" \"extraordinarily creative and unique\".\n\nThe initial success of the game led to several standalone sequels.\n\nThe second installment, \"Stronghold: Crusader\", was released in September 2002. The gameplay is similar to the first game, but with enhanced RTS elements and with all maps and missions set entirely in the Middle Ages in the Middle East. The focus was radically influenced by fortification and siege technologies developed during the Crusades. The entire campaign, as well as the 'Conquest Trail' game mode, takes place during the Third Crusade.\n\nUnlike the original Stronghold, however, there are four separate, linear campaigns. The game does take history into effect: Saladin and Richard I of England are present as the game's AI characters for the player to side with or against, together AI personalities. In addition, the player is allowed to play either as an Arabic lord or as a European king with little effect except which units the player begins.\n\nA combination pack of Stronghold and Stronghold: Crusader, called \"Stronghold Warchest\", was later released with all patches applied, new maps, and a new campaign trail and AI characters in Crusader.\n\nThe sequel, and the third game in the series, \"Stronghold 2\" was released in April 2005. The game engine was enhanced to provide fully three-dimensional graphics. Other changes include new military and peace campaigns and the addition of crime and punishment. It also included many new characters and changed the walls and towers that can be added to a castle. However, the series' unique real-time map editor was replaced with a still-life one.\n\nUpon its release, many players were outraged by the game's frequent crashes, lag (even while playing offline on a computer with exceptional hardware) and overall bugs. Firefly Studios paid much attention to the gaming community's complaints, and promised fixes in later patches, the majority of complaints stopping with patch 1.2. Patch 1.3.1, released on Oct. 28, 2005 brought a \"Conquest Trail\" to the game, similar to that of Stronghold: Crusader. Stronghold 2 Deluxe was later released, containing all patches and new content.\n\nCritically, the game has received generally mixed reviews, whether from the bugs present in the initial release or the gameplay. To promote Stronghold 2, a ten-level Flash game was created, called Castle Attack 2. The aim of the game was to balance building a castle and defending it.\n\nThe fourth game, \"Stronghold Legends\", contains 24 missions, spanning three different campaigns: King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table, Count Vlad Dracul, and Siegfried of Germany.\nThis sequel contains a new feature that allows the player to control human and mythical armies. Creatures like dragons and witches can be created in Stronghold Legends.\n\nThe fifth game, \"Stronghold Crusader Extreme\", is largely the same as Stronghold Crusader, but with an expanded unit cap, allowing thousands of units to be on screen at once (instead of hundreds in Stronghold Crusader). It also includes an updated version of the original Stronghold Crusader game with new AI and maps.\n\n\"Stronghold Kingdoms\" is the first MMO-style game developed in the Stronghold series. In this free-to-play game players can anticipate a world filled with elements from the first game of the series.\n\nStronghold 3 is a 2011 real-time strategy game developed by Firefly Studios and published by SouthPeak Games. The game is the seventh in the series after several spin-offs, a remake and an MMORTS. It is the sequel to Stronghold, released in 2001, and Stronghold 2 released in 2005. Unlike previous games in the series which were published by Take-Two Interactive, the game has been published by SouthPeak Games, the new parent company of Gamecock Media Group, publisher of Stronghold Crusader Extreme.\n\nStronghold Crusader II is the latest title in Firefly Studios's \"Stronghold\" franchise of \"Castle Sim\" RTS games, and was released on September 23, 2014.\n\nStronghold: Warlords is an upcoming real-time strategy game in development, and published by Firefly Studios which was revealed during E3 2019. The release date is set in 2020. \n\n"}

Construction was completed on November 15, 1942 and workers from all over the U.S. flocked to Amarillo for jobs.\n\nPantex was abruptly deactivated when the war ended and remained vacant until 1949, when Texas Technological College in Lubbock (now Texas Tech University) purchased the site for $1. \nTexas Tech used the land for experimental cattle-feeding operations.\n\nIn 1951, at the request of the Atomic Energy Commission (now the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA)), the Army exercised a recapture clause in the sale contract and reclaimed the main plant and 10,000 acres (40 km) of surrounding land for use as a nuclear weapons production facility. The Atomic Energy Commission refurbished and expanded the plant at a cost of $25 million. The remaining 6,000 acres (24 km) of the original site were leased from Texas Tech in 1989.\n\nThe Pantex Plant was operated by Procter & Gamble from 1951 to 1956, Mason & Hanger from 1956 to 2001, and Babcock & Wilcox from 2001 to 2014.\n\nThe plant employed about 3,600 people in 2010 and had a budget of $600 million for fiscal year 2010.\n\n\n\nLabor troubles arose in 2007 following the implementation of stricter physical and performance requirements for armed security personnel following the September 11th attacks. The worker's union for the Pantex guards protested that the new standards were unfairly strenuous to middle-aged personnel nearing retirement. In protest 500 guards walked off the job and went on strike in April 2007 and were replaced with a temporary guard force. The strike ended with a negotiated settlement after 34 days. Guards also went on strike in a pay dispute in 1981, and unionized production and maintenance workers struck in 1970 and 2015.\n\nThe plant was put on lockdown in January 2010 when a Pantex lab worker reported seeing two men wearing camouflage and carrying rifles exit a vehicle a \"couple of miles\" from the plant. The men were found to be employees on their day off, goose hunting on private property. No charges were filed. In October 2018, a bomb-sniffing K-9 unit alerted to a suspicious vehicle parked near an administrative building. The plant was put on lock-down and roads leading to the plant were closed until the vehicle was cleared.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1801825", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1801825", "title": "King's Own Band", "text": "King's Own Band\n\nThe King's Own Band is a Maltese philharmonic band based in the country's capital Valletta.\n\nFounded in 1874 as La Stella, the band later was renamed to La Nazionale and La Nazionale Vincitrice. The band was renamed to The Prince of Wales Band in 1885.\n\nIts current name, The King's Own Band, was given by King Edward VII, who chose the name in 1901 upon advancing to the throne of the United Kingdom.\n\nThe first Band Club, or philharmonic society as they were known, to be set up in Valletta was known as La Nazionale due to their location in the capital city of Malta. Colloquially this band was and still is referred to as Ta' l-Istilla. The reason is that the promoters of this society had in mind their participation during the feast day of Saint Dominic in 1874, one of the patron saints who has his feast celebrated in Valletta, and the symbol of the saint is a star, Stilla in Maltese.\n\nThe band's name has changed multiple times due to the historical circumstances. The first name that was given to the band club was that of La Nazionale. This name reflects immediately the aim of the founders, that it would not only be the band club for the feast of St. Dominic, but also a national one as it was born in the capital city of Malta, Valletta to foster more appreciation for this type of music around the island. Its participation in the various localities of Malta was to confirm this commitment. The second name was that of La Nazionale Vincitrice, adding the appellation that it was victorious. This was given to the band club by its own admirers in order to recognise the achievements and successes that had been registered.\n\nAnother change in name occurred in 1885. The Prince of Wales, who had visited Malta three times during the 1860s, was asked to grant a new name to the band club, namely The Prince of Wales Band. This was to be retained till 1901 when the Prince was crowned the King of the British Empire. The Committee made a formal request to have their name changed once more. From a letter dated 4 March 1901 the British Prime Minister communicated the decision to the Governor of Malta, Sir F. Grenfell. The band was to be officially known as King’s Own Bandpa.\n\nThis Royal connection of the band with the British monarchy was continued throughout the years. In 1903 the king paid an official visit to the islands, arriving in Malta on 16 April. The King’s Own Band was invited to play in the Palace Square during that evening when a dinner was held in the Palace on the occasion of the Royal visitor. Later during the same visit, the King presented a banner to the Band Club inside the Palace. Unfortunately that same banner was destroyed during the Second World War when the club premises were hit during one of the aerial attacks. In 1954 the Governor of Malta presented another Royal standard in lieu of the lost one. While in 1967, during her visit to Malta, Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II presented another Royal Banner to the King's Own Band.\n\nIn 1936, The King's Own Band was the first local band club to play the National Anthem of Malta in public to commemorate the National Day, 8 September.\n\nThe King’s Own Band Club served as an important social, political and musical club for many people. Being also situated in Valletta, it has always attracted particular attention from foreign visitors to the islands. Thus, when His Royal Highness Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, visited the club’s premises on 28 November 1952, he stated :\"I hope that this my visit to the King’s Own Band Club will be interpreted as if I had been to all the band clubs of Malta.\"\n\nThe King's Own Band still bears the title of Eccellenza (Excellence), a tribute to the high level that the band had achieved in Algiers (1912) while participating in the Grand Concours International de Musique.\n\nThe band is composed of about 95 musicians. The band performs throughout the year, starting in March in preparation for the feast of St. Joseph in Rabat – Malta, through October/November in a grand finale in the form of the Annual Concert.\n\n"}
{"id": "1801827", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1801827", "title": "J. Donald Cameron", "text": "J. Donald Cameron\n\nJames Donald Cameron (May 14, 1833 – August 30, 1918) was an American politician from Pennsylvania who served as Secretary of War under President Ulysses S. Grant and in the United States Senate for nearly twenty years. In May, 1876 Cameron was part of a Cabinet realignment by President Grant, having been appointed after a brief tenure by Secretary Alphonso Taft, whom Grant appointed U.S. Attorney General. Former Secretary William W. Belknap had resigned from office, was impeached by the House for taking kickbacks from the Fort Sill tradership, put on trial in the Senate and acquitted. Secretary Cameron was one of two father-son combinations that served as Secretary of War. Secretary Simon Cameron was Cameron's father who served under President Abraham Lincoln. The other father-son combination was Secretary Alphonso Taft and his son Secretary William Howard Taft. During Cameron's tenure the U.S. Military was challenged by the Great Sioux War and by the threat of a second Southern secession after the controversial election of President Rutherford B. Hayes that ended Reconstruction. Cameron proved to be an energetic administrator and his appointment as Secretary of War launched his lengthy political career in the Senate.\n\nCameron was raised and educated near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. After graduating from Princeton College, Cameron worked in the banking and railroad industries. In May 1876, Cameron was appointed Secretary of War by President Ulysses S. Grant serving until March 1877. After leaving the Grant Cabinet, Cameron was elected Senator by the Pennsylvania legislature, under the control of Senator Simon Cameron, his father. Cameron served as Pennsylvania's U.S. Senator from 1877 to 1897, and as chairman on two powerful Senate committees. In 1890, Senator Cameron supported the Federal Elections Bill that enforced African American voting rights in the South. After leaving the Senate, Cameron worked in various industrial businesses until his death in 1918. Cameron was the last surviving cabinet member of the Grant Administration. Cameron is admired for his support of African American rights, bucking his own Republican Party. Cameron's almost 20 year senatorial career was mostly undistinguished, voting the party line. Senatorial \"bossism\", practiced by Cameron, who ran the Pennsylvania machine, was significantly curbed by the passage of the 17th Amendment in May 1913, that mandated Senators be elected by the popular vote of the people.\n\nJames Donald Cameron was born on May 14, 1833 in Middletown, Pennsylvania in the family home, the first-born son of Simon Cameron, the 26th Secretary of War under President Abraham Lincoln and a powerful Pennsylvania politician. Cameron's mother was Margaret Brua. Cameron was commonly referred to as \"Don\". Having received his elementary education in Harrisburg, Cameron enrolled in Princeton College (today Princeton University); he graduated with a bachelor of arts in 1852 and received a master of arts degree in 1855.\n\nAfter leaving Princeton, Cameron's father Simon placed Cameron as a clerk at the successful Middleton Bank; whose main investments were in the iron, coal, and lumber businesses of Pennsylvania. Cameron worked his way up to being Cashier and then President of the bank. As an executive of the Northern Central Railway during the American Civil War, Cameron managed the flow of supplies and soldiers from the northeastern states to Washington, D.C. and Virginia, including efforts to keep the railroad open despite Confederate attempt to damage or destroy it. From 1866 to December 1874 Cameron was President of the Northern Central. As bank President, Cameron was able to improve the financial condition of the railroad. After leaving the Railroad, Cameron worked in various industrial enterprises in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 1876, President Ulysses S. Grant appointed Cameron to his cabinet as Secretary of War, a post his father once served in during the Lincoln administration, to succeed Alphonso Taft, who became Attorney General, and served as so until the end of Grant's presidency. Cameron's predecessor, Alphonso Taft, had initially replaced William W. Belknap, who had abruptly resigned over taking profit payments from the Fort Sill tradership. The Secretary of War had been given control over all Indian traderships in 1870. Belknap was impeached by the House, and during the summer of 1876 was tried and acquitted by the Senate. Cameron's appointment as Secretary of War was part of a sensational three move realignment by President Grant. U.S. Attorney General Edwards Pierrepont was appointed Minister to England; Secretary Taft was appointed U.S. Attorney General; and Cameron was appointed Secretary of War, on the advice of his father, Senator Simon Cameron. Cameron had never served political office until appointed Secretary of War. Cameron had to quickly acquaint himself with the War Department that was in the midst of fighting the Great Sioux War. After the controversial 1876 Presidential election, Cameron had to contend with the Southern States who threatened to secede from the United States a second time. According to General of the Army William T. Sherman, the U.S. military during 1876 was as active as it had been since the Civil War.\n\nSecretary Cameron requested legislation from Congress that required war contractors be required to stand by their bids for a definite time period. Secretary Cameron requested funding from Congress through allocations that paid for the War of Rebellion Records, for the preservation Mathew Brady's American Civil War photographs.\n\nThe U.S. Military, including the Army, headed by Cameron, and Navy, headed by Secretary George M. Robeson, were also in a technological transition developing submarine technology; and torpedo mines and ships to protect United States' waterways and harbors.\n\nWithout ever holding political office, Secretary of War Cameron had to immediately contend with the Great Sioux War and quickly become acquainted with the bureaucracy of the War Department. When gold was discovered in the Black Hills, miners began to invade Indian territory given by the federal government to the Sioux tribe under the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868. In addition, the federal government planned to put a route of the Northern Pacific Railroad through the Sioux and Cheyenne buffalo hunting grounds. After negotiation for the sale of Sioux land failed in May 1875, President Grant ordered all non-treaty bands to return to the reservation. When Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse refused to comply, Secretary of Interior Zachariah Chandler handed over the jurisdiction of the hostile Indians to the War Department on January 31, 1876, launching the Great Sioux War. \n\nThree battles took place during summer 1876 while Cameron was in charge of the War Department: including the Battle of Rosebud, the Battle of the Little Big Horn, and the Battle of Slim Buttes. By October 1876, the War Department, under Secretary Cameron, had increased troop levels at Western Indian Agencies to crack down on Indian resistance. This was to prevent another massacre that had taken the lives of Colonel George Armstrong Custer and the 7th Cavalry at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. After all hostile Indians were rounded up a new treaty was signed that ceded the Black Hills to the federal government.\n\nAfter the controversial Presidential election of 1876 the majority of electoral votes for Republican candidate Rutherford B. Hayes and Democratic candidate Samuel J. Tilden were disputed in the Reconstructed states of Louisiana and Florida. Secretary of War Cameron allowed military troops stationed in both contested states to be at the disposal of Republican politicians. Previously in June, 1876 at the Republican National convention Secretary Cameron was instrumental in nominating Hayes as the Republican candidate. In his 1876 \"Annual Report\" Cameron mentioned that General of the Army William T. Sherman, notifying the War Department, said Southern states threatened to secede from the Union if Tilden was not elected. President Ulysses S. Grant responded through the War Department by having troops concentrated in Louisiana under Brigadier General Christopher C. Augur and reinforced in North Carolina under Brigadier General Thomas H. Ruger. These stationed troops and the delicate and prudent actions of both generals, Augur and Ruger, to keep peace, prevented a second Civil War. A Presidential commission set up by Congress and President Grant in 1877 finally chose Hayes to be elected President of the United States. Cameron's father, Senator Simon Cameron, and other Republican politicians lobbied President Hayes that Cameron remain Secretary of War, however President Hayes refused, not wanting to be part of any Cameron political dynasty and having desired to nominate his own Cabinet.\n\nIn March 1877, his father resigned his seat in the United States Senate, after receiving assurance that his son would be elected to succeed him by the state legislature. Later that month Cameron was elected by the Pennsylvania Legislature. He was reelected three more times serving for a total of twenty years. He served as chairman of the Committee on Naval Affairs from 1881 to 1891 and again from 1895 to 1897 and as chairman of the Committee on Revolutionary Claims from 1893 to 1895. Cameron also served as chairman of the Republican National Committee from 1879 to 1880.\n\nCameron was an active politician who, with the initial aid of his father Simon Cameron, and his political ally Matthew Quay, set up a political machine in the Pennsylvania legislature that ensured Cameron would be reelected to office. Senator Cameron rarely gave speeches, and he was viewed as being judicious, unemotional, and reticent. Cameron disapproved of the popular artful oratory methods used by his contemporaries while his own speeches were forceful and direct. Adopting his father's method, Cameron's strength as a politician relied on working inside the antechamber, committees, and caucuses to obtain his goals. Cameron distinguish himself in the Senate in 1890 when he supported the Federal Elections Bill, that ensured African Americans's voting protection rights in the Solid South. However, on the whole, Cameron's nearly twenty years in the Senate remained undistinguished while for the most part he voted on the Republican Party line. Cameron, like his father, protected the interest of the Pennsylvania Railroad \"PRR\", ensuring that Pennsylvania government House Speakers E. Reed Myer and his successor Henry M. Long, remained sympathetic to the \"PRR\".\n\nCameron was re-elected in 1879, 1885, and in 1891 with his last term ending in March 1897. He was succeeded by Boies Penrose. \n\nAfter not being a candidate for reelection in 1896, Cameron engaged in several business enterprises in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.\n\nCameron died on August 30, 1918 at his country home called \"Donegal\" (Cameron Estate) in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. Cameron was interred at Harrisburg Cemetery in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Cameron was the last surviving Cabinet member of the Grant Administration.\n\nCameron was part of a political family dynasty started by his father Simon Cameron carrying on his legacy as Secretary of War and U.S. Senator. Cameron's ascendancy to Secretary of War, was started when a Democratic controlled House launched an investigation in 1876 into Secretary of War William W. Belknap, who abruptly resigned office over bribery charges. Succeeding Alphonso Taft as Secretary of War, Cameron was in charge of the Great Sioux War and the controversial Election of 1876, that almost caused a second civil war. Cameron was part of a transitional period when civilian control was reestablished over the War Department during the end of Reconstruction. As Senator, Cameron was known as a quiet, but powerful, political boss during the Gilded Age, who supported African American voting rights. Cameron followed in his father Simon's footsteps, protecting the railroad interests of the \"PPR\", in control of Pennsylvania Republican Party politics. \n\nAccording to Cameron's biographer Howard Meneely, Cameron \"made politics, not statesmanship, his principle public business.\" Meneely admired Cameron for breaking from his party and supporting the African American 1890 voting rights legislation, \"Force Bill\", saying that Cameron \"showed admirable and courageous independence.\" Meneely concluded that Cameron was \"[t]horoughly honest in personal matters\" and \"held in high regard by his friends\". As a political boss, Cameron \"took over the active management\" of Pennsylvania's political machine created by his father, and \"with the aid of lieutenants like Matthew Quay ran it skillfully and defiantly as long as he remained in public life.\" \n\nOn April 17, 1913 the 17th Amendment was ratified that mandated the popular vote to elect U.S. Senators, rather than being chosen by state legislatures. The Senate by this time was known as a \"Millionaires Club\" and political machines, such as the one Cameron ran in Pennsylvania, controlled who would be elected Senator.\n\nCameron married Mary McCormick on May 20, 1856, and together they had six children: Eliza McCormick Cameron (born 1857), who married William H. Bradley; Virginia Rolette Cameron (born 1861), who married Lt. Alexander Rodgers; James McCormick Cameron (born 1865); Mary Cameron (born 1867); Margaretta Brua Cameron (born 1869), who married John William Clark; and Rachel Burnside Cameron (born 1871).\n\nCameron's second wife, the former Elizabeth Sherman, whom he married in 1878, was the niece of William Tecumseh Sherman and John Sherman and a close friend of Henry Brooks Adams. Their daughter, Martha Cameron (born 1886), married Sir Ronald Charles Lindsay in 1909.\n\nWhen Cameron died in 1918, his estate had been put in trust and was worth $4,000,000 ($41,200,000 - 2011). Cameron had purchased his father Simon Cameron's affectionately known farm estate, \"Donegal\", on the Susquehanna River in Lancaster County. Cameron lived at \"Donegal\" during the summer while during the winter he lived on his house boat off the South Carolina coast.\n\nThe Cameron Estate (\"Donegal\") was originally granted by William Penn to James Stephenson, who was the great-great-great-great-grandfather of William McKinley. Cameron's father, Simon Cameron, had purchased the property from Nathanial Watson. \"Donegal\" was the home of Cameron's daughter Mary Cameron. In 1961, Cameron's granddaughter, Mary Hale Chase, sold the estate to Elizabethtown College. Charles Baugher, president of the college, designated the property for faculty and student housing, while hosting a satellite campus for special education in collaboration with the Downingtown Special School. In 1979, the college sold the Cameron Estate to a private party. \"Donegal\" is currently the \"Cameron Estate Inn & Restaurant\".\n\n\n\n"}

He is currently signed to All Elite Wrestling (AEW) and New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW). Cabana is a former NWA National Champion and has also wrestled as Scotty Goldman in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and as old school masked wrestler Matt Classic in Wrestling Society X and Chikara.\n\nCabana began his professional wrestling career in the Midwest. He competed routinely in St. Paul, Minnesota, for Steel Domain Wrestling in 2000 and 2001, often teaming or facing rival and then-friend CM Punk. Cabana and Punk competed extensively from Michigan to Pennsylvania, and notably for IWA-Midsouth across Indiana and Illinois. Cabana made a name for himself when he joined ROH, where he was placed in a rivalry with Punk before uniting with Punk and Ace Steel to form the Second City Saints alliance. He later formed a tag team with Punk to win the World Tag Team Championship twice. He also had rivalries with Homicide and then-World Champion Bryan Danielson.\n\nCabana has also toured in countries outside of the United States, and he was a part of the short-lived Wrestling Society X on MTV in late 2006, where he portrayed his \"old school\" wrestling persona, the masked \"Matt Classic\". In 2007, he left ROH to wrestle in Ohio Valley Wrestling, a developmental territory of World Wrestling Entertainment, where he won the Television Championship once and the Southern Tag Team Championship once with Charles Evans and once with Shawn Spears. He made several appearances, as Scotty Goldman, with WWE on its SmackDown brand before being released from his contract in February 2009. Cabana is a former two-time NWA World Heavyweight Champion, and former one-time British Heavyweight Champion. He is also a former NWA National Heavyweight Champion and one-time JCW World Heavyweight Champion.\n\nColton was born in Deerfield, Illinois to a Jewish family.

On August 13, 2005 Cabana defeated Punk in a two out of three falls match in their hometown of Chicago in what was supposed to be Punk's last ROH match before going to World Wrestling Entertainment.\n\nBetween August 2005 and April 2006, Cabana was involved in a feud with Homicide, which featured Cabana being strangled with a metal coat hanger, bleeding from numerous chair shots, having Drāno poured down his throat, being piledriven off the ring apron through a table, and getting his head crushed between a ladder. On April 1, 2006 in Chicago, Cabana finally got his revenge and earned the respect of Homicide after a Chicago Street Fight, which saw the feud settled with a handshake and an embrace.\n\nAfter his decisive victory against Homicide, Colt Cabana challenged the ROH World Champion Bryan Danielson for the World Championship at Ring of Honor's 100th show on April 22, 2006 in Philadelphia. Danielson defeated him in less than five minutes. Feeling he lost the match because he had spent the past eight months \"brawling\" as opposed to wrestling, Cabana rededicated himself. He eventually earned a rematch against Danielson at \"Chi-Town Struggle\" on June 24, though he once again lost. Cabana received one last shot against Danielson for the ROH World Championship on August 26. The two fought to a 60-minute time limit draw in a two out of three falls match, with each wrestler earning one fall.\n\nIn October 2006, Cabana was involved in an auto accident with fellow Ring of Honor stars Adam Pearce and Dave Prazak. Cabana was driving from a Ring of Honor event in Dayton, Ohio when he lost control of their car due to the weather conditions. The car was totaled but everyone was wearing seat belts, which saved their lives. It was initially reported that Cabana had to have a toe amputated, though he had only bruised it. Despite the injury, Cabana wrestled the next night in Chicago Ridge, Illinois. Pearce and Prazak also walked away with only bruises.\n\nOn April 3, 2007, it was revealed by the Ring of Honor website that Colton had signed a WWE developmental contract and was to begin working for their developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling.

He competed under the name Matt Classic, who is a throwback to the wrestlers of the 1950s and 1960s. His gimmick used \"old school\" moves such as the skull vice and the abdominal stretch as finishers. To further enhance his gimmick as an old school wrestler, his WSX profile listed him as having won the Heavyweight Championship in 1952 (28 years before he was born).\n\nColton has worked a number of preliminary matches in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), starting out on its \"Heat\" and \"Velocity\" shows.

Originally not chosen to advance into the voting rounds, Day was brought back to replace another contestant who had lied about his age. After being voted through the semi-finals into the top ten, Day became the first finalist in \"American Idol\" history to be eliminated from the competition. Prior to appearing on the Fox reality series, Day helped write the song \"Pure Love\" for Raven-Symoné's album \"Undeniable\" and placed in the top 20 on \"\".\n\nDay went on to participate in the 2002 American Idols LIVE! tour and throughout the following year made several appearances at charity events. He toured again in 2003, as part of a promotional campaign called Coca-Cola's Behind the Scenes With American Idol – a tour in which various \"American Idol\" finalists performed in select shopping malls throughout the country. A recording of Day singing Edwin McCain's \"I'll Be\" is included on \"\". This compilation album of all the first season finalists was released in 2002 and reached #4 on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart.\n\nAlthough Day has never released a full album, he collaborated with his fellow \"American Idol\" first season finalist AJ Gil on a single in 2003. The song, \"Calling All Angels\", was written for and released through the charity organization Give Kids the World. Day and Gil first performed this song in Pasadena, California's New Year's Day Rose Parade. Later that year, Day released his own single, \"Come Into My World\", which attained limited airplay in Atlanta, Georgia. A full album of the same title was set to be released around 2006, but has never been made available.\n\nLeading up to and then following his run on \"American Idol\", Day has had a career performing on cruise ships – most notably ones operated by Royal Caribbean and Holland America. Day has also been cast in several stage productions over the years. His social media accounts contain several original songs that have never been commercially released.\n\nEarl Day Jr., known professionally as EJay Day, originally hails from Lawrenceville, Georgia. The youngest of four children, his parents, Earl Sr. and Gilda, were employed by Corporate Environments at the time of Day's \"American Idol\" appearance. Day took to singing in church at an early age. He would later credit this experience with helping to develop his vocal abilities, saying that it taught him how to \"sing parts and harmonies\". Before long, Day began performing in larger venues. He signed with a talent agency known as Hot Shot Kids/Teens in Atlanta, which also represented Tamyra Gray and Diana DeGarmo, two other local artists who would also go on to become \"American Idol\" finalists. At the age of twelve, Day sang the National Anthem before an Atlanta Braves game. According to the bio on Day's (now-defunct) official website, he had found a large audience by the age of fifteen, performing for several notable officials and celebrity figures, such as President George Bush, former U.S. Ambassador Andrew Young. Rev. Jesse Jackson, Hank Aaron, Andre Agassi, and Muhammad Ali. Day purportedly performed for Ali numerous times, \"at book-signing events and other receptions [held in Ali's] honor.\"\n\nIn 1999, Day graduated from Central Gwinnett High School. The same year, he shared songwriting credit for the track \"Pure Love\" on Raven-Symoné's album \"Undeniable\". At the time of his \"American Idol\" audition, Day was employed as a singer and dancer at Six Flags Over Georgia. He also found work singing on a cruise liner and was cast in multiple musicals. Prior to appearing on the Fox reality series, Day participated in the second season of \"\", placing in the Top 20.\n\nDay auditioned for \"American Idol\" in Atlanta, Georgia, singing \"Get Here\" by Oleta Adams. He was twenty years old at the time. Although initially cut from the competition prior to the voting rounds, he advanced into the semi-finals, after another contestant, Delano Cagnolatti, was disqualified. Anyone over the age of twenty-four was not allowed to audition that season, and it was discovered that Cagnolatti, then twenty-nine, had lied in an attempt to escape the cut-off.\n\nPlaced into Group 3 for the Top 30 semi-finals, Day performed \"I'll Be\", by Edwin McCain. Although he had less time to prepare than the other contestants, he received positive remarks from the judges and was voted through to the top ten. For the first round of the finals, each contestant was instructed to sing a Motown song. Day selected \"My Girl\", by The Temptations. Although he was once again praised by all three judges (and even called best of the night up to that point by Randy Jackson), Day received the lowest number of votes that week and became the first finalist ever eliminated from \"American Idol\".\n\nDay's performances with \"American Idol\" have caused a divergence of opinions among music critics. Following Day's elimination from the competition, Jessica Shaw of \"Entertainment Weekly\" concurred with the contestant's low placement, criticizing his fashion – \"EJay could have been voted off simply for wearing that 'Please, sir, I want some more' Oliver Twist cap\" – and his song choice that week – \"Of all the Motown songs, did he have to pick one that’s been covered to death?\" Day's recorded rendition of \"I'll Be\", on the \"\" album, earned a better reaction however, prompting another writer with the publication, Jon Caramanica, to declare that Day \"got robbed\". Dave Wedge of \"The Boston Herald\" also singled out \"I'll Be\" as a highlight on the album, writing that Day \"show[s] personality along with some polish\". Wedge considered Day's track superior to those included on the album of that season's runner-up contestant, Justin Guarini. In a review for \"The Herald News\", Chuck Campbell was largely critical of the album and wrote that Day \"bumbles along\" on the track. He nonetheless considered Day's vocals to be emotionally well-conveyed.\n\nRanking the sixteen most notable Georgians to ever appear on \"American Idol\", Rodney Ho of the \"Atlanta Journal-Constitution\" placed Day in the twelfth spot. He wrote that Day's live rendition of \"I'll Be\", performed during the semi-finals, had \"some tonal issues\", but was mostly in key. In a 2013 retrospective feature by PopCrush, Cristin Maher wrote that Day displayed \"sweet\" and \"smooth\" vocals while on the series. \"Boston Herald\" writer Amy Amatangelo gained the impression that Day should have gone on further in the competition, after seeing his group medley performance in the first season finale. A year after Day's run on \"American Idol\", Simon Cowell reflected, \"[EJay Day] could outsing Justin Guarini any day of the week, but he had just an average feel about him.\"\n\nDay's involvement with the 2002 American Idols LIVE! tour also elicited varied reactions. Ho concluded that Day gave a better performance on this tour than some of the higher ranked contestants, calling Day's voice \"the best of guys'\". Day's performance in this setting was considered \"barely audible\" by Amatangelo, but she nonetheless complimented it for being \"energetic\". Writing for the \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" and the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" respectively, Kevin C. Johnson and Jim Derogatis were considerably less positive in their reviews. Johnson criticized the \"harshly cut wig and thick makeup\" that Day wore on the tour, while describing Day's performance in the set as \"style over substance\". Derogatis called Day's performance \"completely forgettable\". Offering up his own ranking of the ten finalists, Derogatis readjusted several positions, but still placed Day in last.\n\n\nLess than a month after \"American Idol\"'s first season finale, Day reunited with the top thirty contestants to perform in the two-hour \"American Idol in Las Vegas\" TV special. Day then participated through October and November in the 2002 American Idols LIVE! tour, along with his fellow top ten finalists. Each of this tour's thirty shows was opened by Day singing Janet Jackson's \"Black Cat\". To usher in 2003, Day performed in Pasadena, California's New Year's Day Rose Parade. Paired with eighth place finalist AJ Gil on a float for Give Kids the World, the two sang \"Calling All Angels\", a song which had been specifically written for the charity organization. The band OTown also participated in this float. Day and Gil would subsequently perform \"Calling All Angels\" at an Orlando, Florida fundraising gala in June and release this duet as a single through Give Kids the World. Later that year, Day participated in further fundraising events, such as the Hollywood Knights Season Wrap Party in Los Angeles and NSYNC's Challenge for the Children event in Miami. Throughout the Spring, Day participated in Coca-Cola's Behind the Scenes With American Idol promotional tour, in which he and a selection of other finalists from the first two seasons of the series performed in shopping malls owned by the Simon Property Group. Around this time, Day also performed the National Anthem for a variety of professional Georgia sports teams, such as the Atlanta Hawks and the Atlanta Thrashers. In November, Day performed along with Edwin McCain and \"American Idol\" second season finalist Vanessa Olivarez in a tree lighting ceremony at the World of Coca-Cola.\n\nShortly after appearing on \"American Idol\", Day returned to performing on cruise ships. Between 2005 and 2006, it was reported that he had been performing on two different ships operated by Royal Caribbean – \"Voyager of the Seas\" and \"Explorer of the Seas\". By 2011, Day had established a musical act performing on Holland America's MS \"Veendam\". Day has also performed in Las Vegas and been cast in several low-profile theatrical productions. It has been suggested by PopCrush, that Day may have continued performing for Muhammad Ali, extending his purported pre-\"Idol\" history with the iconic boxer.\n\nThe \"American Idol: Greatest Moments\" album, released October 1, 2002, features a recorded version of Day singing Edwin McCain's \"I'll Be\". The album reached #4 on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart. Although Day has never released a debut album of his own, he remarked during his \"American Idol\" run that he would likely title such an album \"Fire\" or \"Eye Candy\". Following his elimination from the series, Day elaborated to \"Billboard\" that his dream would be to collaborate with The Neptunes on music similar to that of Britney Spears. Five months later, \"People\" magazine reported that Day was recording \"demo tapes\", and the following April, Day told \"Orlando Weekly\" that he had completed a song called \"Come Into My World\". In July 2003, \"Come Into My World\" was released as a single. According to Day's official website, the song found airplay on two radio stations in Atlanta. Currently, \"Come Into My World\" can be heard on Day's StarNow account, along with another original song, \"My Lovin's Too Good Too Wait\". Day's MySpace page included two additional tracks, \"Just Let Go\" and \"One Good Beat\", which can no longer be heard due to MySpace accidentally deleting millions of songs.\n\nIn September 2006, it was reported by \"Gwinnett Daily Post\" that Day had recorded a full album. Evoking Day's single from three years earlier, this album would have been titled \"Come Into My World\". Although unreleased, the album was said to contain original songs, mixing R&B with pop. The publication was told by Day that \"many of the songs were inspired by his experiences performing on cruise ships.\" Day's official website noted that the album's songs were written by Day himself, Charlie Morgan, and Georgi Ivanov.\n\nThe LGBT publication \"Baltimore OUTloud\" reported in 2012 that dance music artists known as the Perry Twins were writing and producing new music for Day, although nothing more was said about Day in this article. Two years later, on September 4, 2014, Day uploaded a song titled \"Need You in My Life\" to his YouTube channel. In the description, Day called this the first song on which he understood the \"meaning [of] songwriting\" and noted that it was inspired by a relationship in which he and the other person had to part ways, in spite of their strong feelings for one another. \"Time was not on our side. It's usually like that for me...[but maybe], just maybe we would meet again\", Day wrote about the song.\n\n"}

The plant, Honeywell Specialty Chemicals in Metropolis, Illinois, has a nominal capacity of 15,000 tU as uranium hexafluoride per year. ConverDyn, a general partnership between affiliates of Honeywell and General Atomics, is the exclusive agent for conversion sales from the Honeywell Uranium Hexafluoride Processing Facility.\n\nBuilt in 1958, the Honeywell Metropolis Works Facility is the only uranium hexafluoride conversion facility in the United States. The plant has an annual conversion capacity of approximately 15,000 tU as UF accounting for approximately 20% of worldwide production capacity. The plant feeds UO yellowcake received from uranium mines and produces uranium hexafluoride gas for enrichment at one of the primary enrichment sites around the world. After being enriched, product is fabricated into nuclear fuel that ends up generating electricity at a nuclear power plant.\n\nOn November 20th 2017, Honeywell announced plans to idle Metropolis plant, reduce workforce by 170 positions due to market conditions and reduced product demand.\n\nHoneywell Metropolis Works deploys a unique technology and process by which it converts yellowcake to uranium hexafluoride gas. The other Western conversion facilities, Areva and Cameco, each utilize a process that requires two different facilities, one to convert yellowcake to either uranium tetrafluoride or uranium trioxide and another to convert to uranium hexafluoride. Honeywell developed a process known as the dry fluoride volatility conversion process that allows for complete yellowcake to UF at a single facility and also yielding a greater level of UF purity at 99.99% or higher.\n\nThe dry fluoride volatility conversion process at Metropolis works goes through five basic steps: feed preparation, reduction, hydrofluorination, fluorination, and distillation.\n\n\nThe aim of this initial step is to ensure that uranium concentrates have the optimum particle size and density necessary to move forward in the process of conversion.\n\nDuring this stage, uranium ore concentrates are converted to uranium dioxide and impurities are removed from the system into a waste gas stream. The sized yellowcake is reacted with hydrogen in a fluidizing medium to form uranium dioxide\n\nThe UO resulting from the previous reduction stage is then converted into uranium tetrafluoride intermediate (Green Salt) and additional impurities are removed from the system.\n\n\nThe Metropolis Works Plant operates the largest gaseous fluorine capacity in the world. Fluorine is produced in this process by the electrolysis of HF in a potassium bifluoride substrate. The fluorine is pulled to the fluorination process under vacuum so as to increase the safety of this step. The result of this step is crude uranium hexafluoride gas.\n\nFinally, uranium hexafluoride from the previous step is purified in a two-stage distillation system. The crude UF is vaporized and transferred through a boiling system into cold traps. After cooling, the final product is filled into cylinders for transport. This stage is proprietary Honeywell technology which allows output of 99.99% or greater UF.\n\nAfter the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011, the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission conducted inspections at all US nuclear facilities for seismic deficiencies and general resistance to natural disasters. Although initial inspections confirmed that the Metropolis Works Facility was in full compliance with its operating license, the NRC shutdown the plant in May 2012 and required a series of upgrades to improve resilience to natural disasters including earthquakes and tornadoes. Honeywell elected to complete required upgrades and the plant restarted production of uranium hexafluoride in July 2013, after more than a year offline.\n\nAt 2:45 CST on 12/22/03, a small release of Uranium hexafluoride occurred lasting approximately 45 minutes. At 3:00 CST the licensee declared a Site Area Emergency, indicating failure of systems design to prevent risk to the public. All personnel were evacuated within a radius. About 25 people offsite were temporarily evacuated and some 75 persons remained sheltered for a time in their homes. Licensee notified State of Illinois. NRC was notified at 0400 CST.\n\nThe licensee terminated the Site Area Emergency at 6:50 CST on 12/22/03.\n\nAt the conclusion of regularly scheduled collective bargaining between Honeywell and United Steelworkers local 7-669, the largest resident union at the Metropolis facility, the company locked out union members when they refused to ratify a new agreement with several concessions. The Union continued to work for seven days without an agreement until the company initiated the lockout on June 28, 2010. The lockout lasted until August 1, 2011, when the union ratified a new three year collective bargaining agreement.\n\nAfter failing to come to an agreement at the expiration of the 2011 collective bargaining agreement, Honeywell locked out the United Steelworkers local 7-669 on August 1, 2014.

Honeywell attributed the accident to an equipment failure and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission began an investigation of the plant to make sure safety procedures were followed.

The Building Bridges program developed partnerships with fellow LGBT organizations around the Bay Area. Berry ran the program and built coalitions as a single-person staff working out of the Pacific Center in Berkeley, California, and by September 1997 she moved into the United Way Bay Area (UWBA) offices in San Francisco.\n\nBy 1998, three LGBT workplace organizations merged in an effort to effectively collaborate on their common mission of creating safe and affirming workplaces for LGBT individuals—called the Pride Collaborative. These organizations included Building Bridges, A Group of Groups (AGOG), and Progress.\n\nIn 1999 The Pride Collaborative merged with COLLEAGUES, a national organization that sponsored the annual Out & Equal Conference aimed at human resource professionals and LGBT employees, to form Out & Equal Workplace Advocates, and the current organizational structure was born. That same year, Progress's Leadership Summit and COLLEAGUES' Out & Equal Conference combined resources to produce the annual Out & Equal Workplace Summit, one of the keystone programs of the organization.\n\nIn January 2004, after years of being supported by the United Way of the Bay Area, Out & Equal Workplace Advocates became an independent 501 [c] 3 organization. Until Dec 2019, Out & Equal was headquartered in the historic City Club building in San Francisco's Financial District, when it moved to Oakland. In 2015, Out & Equal opened a second office in Washington Dc, which it began to expand on its bi-coastal presence.\n\nIn 2018, Founder and CEO Selisse Berry was succeeded by Erin Uritus, who served as an Out & Equal Board member from 2005-2007. Erin Uritus presided over a comprehensive re-positioning of Out & Equal's strategic plan; new service delivery and sponsorship model; expansion and diversification of its major Summit event; launch of new services and programs like the digital Global Hub, Southern Forum; the expansion of global programs in India, China and Brazil; and the launch of a new organizational brand.\n\nOut & Equal annually holds a training and networking event called the Out & Equal Workplace Summit in rotating locations around the United States. The Workplace Summit hosts thousands of LGBT employees, human resource professionals and organizational representatives each year for a few days of training and networking. The Workplace Summit includes an award ceremony aimed at recognizing leaders in LGBT workplace equality called The Outies.\n\nOut & Equal's Workplace Summit is considered to be appropriate for federal training in compliance with 5 U.S.C. Chapter 41. As proclaimed by Human Resources Director John Berry on August 6, 2010, the Out & Equal Workplace Summit is open to all federal employees.\nIn 2012, Out & Equal held their first international Summit in London. This dynamic event brought together people from around the world to consider ways to build greater equality in the workplace for LGBT people and allies. Attendees came together to share best practices, engage with colleagues from around the world, and strengthen the diversity of global workplaces. Tennis champion Martina Navratilova, IBM Europe Chairman Harry van Dorenmalen, and organizational consultant John Amaechi were among the speakers at the Global LGBT Workplace Summit. The conference featured 24 workshops covering a broad range of topics focused on LGBT workplace issues around the world.\n\nThe Executive Forum is an annual meeting of executive leaders in a multi-day conference to \"learn from one another and share best practices.\" The first Executive Forum was held in 2008 in San Francisco but have been held in countries all over the US.\n\nThe Momentum Gala is Out & Equal's annual celebration and gala dinner held in San Francisco which honors prominent activists in the LGBT movement, organizations dedicated to diversity and inclusion in their workplace, and features LGBT entertainers and inspirational speakers.\n\nOut & Equal offers diversity training, educational resources and consulting services to senior management, human resource professionals, employee resource groups and individual employees to promote LGBT workplace equality.

Out & Equal has issued public statements urging constituents to contact their United States House Representatives to proceed with the passage of ENDA. During San Francisco Pride Parades, Out & Equal has provided signage to parade participants displaying support for ENDA.\n\nConsidering the military a workplace, Out & Equal Workplace Advocates took an early stance against Don't Ask, Don't Tell policies. In February 2008, Selisse Berry wrote in an open letter to Congress and Nancy Pelosi stating, \"We believe that in these times of international crisis (and at all times), the military has a duty to recruit and retain the most qualified people, foster genuine teamwork, and set an example that ALL American citizens matter. We believe that Congress has a moral obligation to repeal policies that have prevented the military from achieving these goals.\"\n\nLeading up the 2015 SCOTUS ruling in \"Obergefell v. Hodges\" that state-level bans on same-sex marriage are unconstitutional, Out & Equal Workplace Advocates was one of 379 employer organizations that signed on to an \"amicus curiae\" brief which urged the High Court to consider the burdens imposed on both employers and employees by a fractured legal landscape with no uniform rule on same-sex marriage.\n\nOut & Equal's \"Business Case for Marriage Equality\" was penned in 2010 and remains a critical tenant of the organization's overall work.\n\nIn light of national outcry for immigration reform, Out & Equal joined a coalition of LGBT organizations around the United States in a public statement to support the Uniting American Families Act (UAFA) which protects the rights of same-sex couples during the immigration process into the United States. In a partnership with organizations including The Council for Global Equality and Human Rights Watch, Out & Equal publicly stated that, \"An estimated 17,000 young children are being raised by LGBT parents in binational families and those children face the very real possibility of losing a parent, or leaving the only country they have ever called home.\"\n\nIn response to public backlash to Target Corporation's large political donation to anti-gay Republican politician Tom Emmer, Target Corporation publicly called upon the Corporation's continued financial sponsorship of Out & Equal's Workplace Summit. Target CEO Gregg Steinhafel emphasized Target's relationship with Out & Equal in order to demonstrate the company's commitment to LGBT Workplace equality.\n\nStanford University lists Out & Equal as the leading organization for LGBT graduates to turn to for job placement advice.\n\nIn 2010, Out & Equal launched a series of editorials called \"Communities in Common\" written by diverse members of the LGBT community in order to recognize and celebrate the roles of other communities within the struggle for equality.\n\nOn October 8, 2010 Out & Equal was recognized by GLSEN for outstanding leadership in LGBT rights at the GLSEN Respect Awards in Los Angeles, California.\n\nIn 2016, Selisse Berry, Founder of Out & Equal, was presented the Bonham Centre Award from The Mark S.

{"id": "1801902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1801902", "title": "Samuel Bigger", "text": "Samuel Bigger\n\nSamuel Bigger (March 20, 1802 – September 9, 1846) was the seventh Governor of the U.S. state of Indiana from December 9, 1840 to December 6, 1843. Bigger was nominated to run for governor because he had no connection to the failed public works program. The state had entered a severe financial crisis in his predecessor's term and the government became insolvent during his first year in office. He oversaw the state's bankruptcy negotiations, but the bankruptcy he negotiated was only able to return the state to solvency briefly. By the time of his reelection campaign, the Whig Party had become the target of public blame for the debacle, and Bigger was defeated.\n\nSamuel Bigger was born in Franklin, Ohio, on March 20, 1802, the son of John Bigger, a veteran of the American Revolutionary War and an Ohio House of Representatives Speaker of the House. Because of his father he regularly encountered many of the leading men of the frontier. He attended a log cabin school in Ohio. As a boy, Bigger enjoyed reading books. At age eighteen he contracted a severe cold from which he nearly died. Because of the sickness he was constantly in poor health and his father decided he was unfit for manual labor on the farm and sent him to school where he could learn a profession. Bigger was enrolled as a student at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio, in the 1820s where he studied law.\n\nBigger moved to Liberty, Indiana, in 1829 after completing school and entered a law practice. There he married Ellen Williamson; the couple never had children. He lived only a short time in Liberty before moving to Rushville where he began his public career. He was partnered in his law office with future United States Senator Oliver H. Smith for a period of time, and later with James Whitcomb and Joseph A. Wright.\n\nIn 1833 Bigger was elected to the Indiana House of Representatives. He served three terms until 1835. He was not a great orator, but became known for his simple and straightforward method of speaking. He was narrowly defeated by James Gregory in the election of the house speaker in 1835. The same year he was appointed as a judge on the Indiana Circuit Court where he served until his election as governor.\n\nDuring the time he was on the court, the state passed the Mammoth Internal Improvement Act to build canals, roads, and railroads across the state. Although the act met with celebration at first, the Panic of 1837 devastated the economy just as the government had taken on a $10 million debt. The situation spiraled out of control as Governor David Wallace attempted to delay the collapse of the states finances and continue work on the projects, which led the debt to increase to $12 million. Along with other debts, the government owed more than $15 million. As the election approached, the Whig Party decided to abandon the governor and run a candidate who had no connection to the failure.\n\nIn 1840 Bigger was nominated to become the Whig Party candidate for Governor of Indiana. He was opposed by Democratic candidate Congressman Tilghman Howard. The state's financial status and the failed public works projects were the central debates of the campaign. Bigger claimed to have always opposed the projects and promised to try to get the state out of its dire situation. Howard had been in the assembly and voted for the projects and was branded as a supporter of the failure. Despite the situation of the state, the election was overshadowed by territorial governor William Henry Harrison's campaign for United States President. Years had passed since the state had repudiated his actions as governor, and he had become a popular historical figure and a folk legend in the state. The support he brought to the Whig ticket was enough to return the state Whig Party to their final term of domination of state government. Whigs retained majorities in the General Assembly and Bigger defeated Howard, 62,932 to 54,274.\n\nAs Bigger entered office, the interest on the state debt alone was over $500,000 annually while state income was closer to $250,000. The state's credit maxed out during his first year in office and the state defaulted on its debts in July, leading the debt to grow even more quickly. At first, Bigger recommended reforming the property tax system that provided the majority of the state's income. County boards were created to \"equalize\" property values used to set tax amounts. The result was a massive tax increase of as much as 300% in some areas. The public outcry was so great, and so many people refused to pay their taxes, that the system was repealed in the following year.\n\nThe government's primary hope of escaping the situation was to complete the projects, which they believed would produce income to start to cover their costs. The projects were prioritized and it was decided that the most valuable project, the Wabash and Erie Canal, should receive all the available funds. A negotiator was sent to London to negotiate with the state's creditors. The Whitewater Canal, two other smaller canal projects, and the Madison and Indianapolis Railroad were transferred to the creditors in exchange for a 50% reduction in the debt they held, leaving the state owing a total debt of around $9 million. Despite the progress made, the debt was still more than the state could bear, but gained the state more time to try and deal with the problem.\n\nA commission was created, which Bigger oversaw, to investigate the failure of the internal improvements program. The commission alleged corruption of many of the contractors who worked on the projects, claimed the state was misled in many different areas, and was the victim of \"imposition and fraud.\" In its summary, the state had significantly underestimated the costs of the projects, the time they would take to complete, and its own ability to pay for the debt. To complicate matters, no routes had been surveyed for many of the canal projects, which turned out to be unfeasible in the first place.\n\nIn 1841, at the request of the state legislature, Bigger completely rewrote the state's code of laws with the help of Indiana State Treasurer George H. Dunn. Bigger was well qualified for the job with his background as a lawyer. His new code of laws was passed almost immediately and overwhelmingly by the legislature in 1842.\n\nIn 1834, leaders of the Methodist church requested that Governor Bigger appoint Methodists to the board of Indiana University, which was dominated by Presbyterians. Bigger himself was a Presbyterian and refused their request. During a legislative debate on the matter, Bigger said that there was \"not a Methodist in America with sufficient learning to fill a professor's chair.\" He also said the Methodist Church did not require educated preachers, but rather uneducated preachers better suited its members. The quote was printed in state newspapers, and Bigger became the subject of fiery sermons in Methodist churches across the state. Methodists outnumbered Presbyterians four to one in the state at that time, hurting Bigger's popularity. In his reelection campaign again Methodist James Whitcomb, the church, led mainly by Bishop Ames, campaigned heavily on behalf of Whitcomb. Ames was quoted as saying, \"it is with the amen corner of the Methodist Church that defeated Governor Bigger, and I had a hand in that\". Coupled with the blame the public placed on the Whigs for the state's financial situation, Bigger was overwhelming defeated by Whitcomb.\n\nAfter leaving office, Bigger moved to Fort Wayne where he formed a new law practice with Joseph K. Edgerton. The Whig party attempted to nominate Bigger to run for governor again in the 1846 race for governor, but he declined the offer without giving an explanation. He suddenly became ill and died in his Fort Wayne home on September 9, 1846, aged 43, and was buried in that city's McCulloch Park.\n\nThe U.S. 27 (Lafayette Street) bridge over the St. Marys River in downtown Fort Wayne was renamed the Governor Samuel Bigger Memorial Bridge by a Resolution of the Indiana General Assembly authored by State Representative Mitchell Harper. Historian Gayle Thornbrough noted that Bigger was among the governors who had the least impact on the events of the day, largely because of the state financial situation.\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

He had found a Visitor's Map to Ottawa and was travelling to Syria to get married. This evidence, as well as the post-September 11 fear, led him to be considered a suspected terrorist. In 2001, El-Maati was the subject of a Royal Canadian Mounted Police investigation into what appeared to be a terror plot involving his job as a truck driver.\n\nHe is the brother of suspected Al-Qaeda member Amer el-Maati.\n\nEl-Maati was born in Kuwait to Badr El-Maati, an accountant, auditor and business consultant from Egypt, and Samira Al-Shallash, a teacher from Syria. The family moved to Beirut, and both Ahmad and his brother were enrolled in a Catholic school.\n\nHe immigrated to Montreal with his father and brother Amr in 1981, when he was 17 years old and took a job in a local factory. The family then moved to Toronto, when his mother and sister arrived.\n\nAhmad took college courses in electronics, before enrolling at Concordia University for two years where he studied statistics. He worked as a cab driver in London, Ontario and took lessons towards a pilot's license after a friend suggested there was money to make in air taxis between Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto. He flew a Cessna trainer for five hours, before dropping the program due to his fear of heights. He received his formal Canadian citizenship in 1986.\n\nIn 1988, he traveled to fight with the Mujahideen in repelling the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, but contracted malaria within two weeks of arriving and spent the next four months in a hospital in Peshawar, before returning to Canada. He later worked as a truck driver in Afghanistan, and drove an ambulance and cooked meals for Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's army as it fought against the Taliban in Logar. In 1996, Amer came to Afghanistan looking for his brother, just as Hekmatyar's forces were retreating north through Salang tunnel. In November 1997, Ahmad deserted, meeting up with his mother and sister in Iran, while his brother traveled to Pakistan.\n\nUpon moving back to Canada in 1998, he moved in with his father and had trouble finding work. His father's friend Ibrahym Adam offered a job as a mechanic's assistant in Montreal, but suggested he look towards driving long-haul transport vehicles. Ahmad used his salary, as well as a loan from his father, to graduate with his AZ license from a Scarborough driving school. He celebrated by taking the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in March 1999, and returned to take a job with Leger Trucking, driving lettuce from a farm in Salinas, California to Quebec supermarkets and McDonald's restaurants, earning about $750 for the thirty-hour drive. He decided to drive solo, as he could earn triple the money, and was hired by Motion Supply, who assigned him to drive with Highland Transport.\n\nHe later advised fellow Afghan veteran Mohamad Elzahabi to find similar work as a truck driver, and allowed him to accompany his own haul to the southern United States, where he dropped him off.\n\nEl-Maati was stopped at the Canada–US border on August 16, 2001, where customs officials found a map of Ottawa listing both government and nuclear research facilities, which was later found to be a government-issued visitor's map left by a previous driver.\n\nFollowing the September 11 attacks in the United States in 2001, he was interviewed by Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) agent Adrian White who wanted to question him about the map, and his visit to Syria in April.\n\nClaiming frustration with the ongoing police involvement, Ahmad left to Syria in 2001 to complete the marriage ceremonies with his fiancée. The legal marriage papers would enable him to apply for her to enter Canada. He never met her there, and sometime after his arrest her family annulled the marriage.\n\nHe was jailed upon his arrival in Syria, was tortured into making a confession, which he later retracted, that he had been a part of a terrorism plot involving two fellow Syrian-Canadians, Maher Arar and Abdullah Almalki, who were then arrested.\n\nIn December 2001, CSIS agents Adrian White and Rob Cassolato turned up at the el-Maati home in Toronto, asking Badr to come clean about his sons' locations.\n\nOn January 12, 2004, State Security offered to release Ahmad to his family if they would give up the location of Amer. Their mother protested that she didn't know where Amer was, and Ahmad was released the following day.\n\nOn September 6, 2005, a front-page article in \"The Globe and Mail\" newspaper revealed that the map in question was of the Tunney's Pasture government complex in the west end of Ottawa, Ontario.\nThe map, an old version, showed government buildings including a Health Canada virus lab as well as a nuclear research facility belonging to Atomic Energy of Canada. However, these offices had been relocated prior to El-Maati's detainment at the border. They have since been demolished and transformed into parking lots.\n\nThe Canadian government has ordered a public inquiry into Mr. El-Maati's and two other men who also experienced detention in Syria. On June 18, 2009, the House of Commons of Canada voted in favour of an official apology and compensation to Almalki, el-Maati and Nureddin. , Ahmad is unable to work and lives with his mother.\nIn July 2017, Along with other two Ahmad received $31.25 million in compensation.\n\n"}

He made his preparatory studies in the Petits séminaires of Meximieux (Ain) and Saint-Genis-l'Argentière (Rhône), his studies of philosophy at Alix (Rhône), and of theology in the seminary of Saint-Sulpice, Paris. He was ordained priest 20 December 1823, and soon was appointed vicar in the parish at Ferney, and eventually became its parish priest. He built there a new church and founded a boys' college with funds gathered on a tour through France. At this period, he revived the Catholic faith among parishioners, who had been made indifferent by the proximity of the Protestant cantons of Switzerland. But Crétin longed for a larger field of activity; at one time he thought earnestly of going as a missionary to China. His perplexities in that regard were solved by the advent of his old friend, Bishop Mathias Loras, first bishop of Dubuque, Iowa, who arrived in France in 1838 in search of priests for to evangelize his vast diocese.\n\nCrétin was one of the few who volunteered and on 16 August 1838, he secretly left his parish, embarked at Le Havre with Bishop Loras, and landed in New York in October of the same year. The winter of 1838-39 was spent in St. Louis, Missouri, and on his arrival in Dubuque, 18 April 1839, he was immediately appointed vicar-general of the new diocese. For over eleven years, he exercised his priestly ministry in these new regions, dividing his time between Dubuque, Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, and the Winnebago Indians in the neighborhood of Fort Atkinson, in Winneshiek County, Iowa. Only once, in 1847, did he absent himself, when he made a trip to Europe in the interest of his missions. In 1850 St. Paul, Minnesota became the seat of a new diocese. Crétin was appointed its first bishop, and went to France, to be consecrated, 26 January 1851, at Belley by Bishop Devie, who had ordained him to the priesthood.\nAt that time, the diocese, encompassed all of Minnesota and the Dakotas. After having obtained some donations and several ecclesiastics for his new diocese, he returned to America and arrived in St. Paul, 2 July 1851. That evening he made his first appearance in the log chapel of St. Paul, his first cathedral, and gave his first episcopal blessing to his flock. In less than five months a large brick building was completed, which served as a school, a residence, and a second cathedral. Another structure, begun in 1855, was finished after his death, and served as the cathedral of St. Paul until the present Cathedral was completed in 1915. In 1853 a hospital was built. That year, and again in 1856, he bought land for cemetery purposes. For the instruction of children he introduced, in 1851, a community of the Sisters of St. Joseph, and in 1855, the Brothers of the Holy Family. He also planned the erection of a seminary, and always eagerly fostered vocations for the priesthood, keeping at his residence seminarians in their last period of preparation. He supported likewise the cause of temperance not only by personal example, but also by organizing, in January, 1852, the Catholic Temperance Society of St. Paul, the first of its kind in Minnesota. Another of his works was Catholic colonization. With an eye to the future he endeavored to provide for the growth of his diocese by bringing Catholic immigrants from European countries to the fertile plains of Minnesota. Withal he did not neglect his ministerial and pastoral office. He was often alone in St. Paul without the help of priest, and at times travelled through the vast extent of his diocese bestowing on his people the consolations of religion. \n\nCrétin died at St. Paul, Minnesota, 22 February 1857. Bishop Crétin's memory is held in esteem and veneration, especially by the old settlers of St. Paul.\n"}
{"id": "1801948", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1801948", "title": "John Desborough", "text": "John Desborough\n\nJohn Desborough (1608–1680) was an English soldier and politician who supported the parliamentary cause during the English Civil War.\n\nHe was the son of James Desborough of Eltisley, Cambridgeshire, and of Elizabeth Hatley of Over in the same county. He was baptized on 13 November 1608. He was educated in law. On 23 June 1636 he married Eltisley Jane, daughter of Robert Cromwell of Huntingdon, and sister of Oliver Cromwell, the future Lord Protector.\n\nHe took an active part in the English Civil War, and showed considerable military ability. In 1645, he was present as major in the engagement at Langport on 10 July, at Hambleton Hill on 4 August, and on 10 September he commanded the horse at the storming of Bristol. Later he took part in the operations round Oxford. In 1648, as colonel he commanded the forces at Great Yarmouth.\n\nHe avoided all participation in the trial of Charles I in June 1649, being employed in the settlement of the west of England. He fought at Worcester as major-general and nearly captured Charles II near Salisbury.\n\nAfter the establishment of the Commonwealth of England he was chosen, on 7 January 1652, a member of the committee for legal reforms. In 1653, he became a member of the Protectorate council of state, and a commissioner of the treasury, and was appointed one of the four Generals at Sea and a commissioner for the army and navy. In 1654, he was made constable of St Briavel's Castle in Gloucestershire. During the Rule of the Major-Generals (1655–1656) he was appointed major-general over the south west. He had been nominated a member of the Barebones Parliament in 1653, and he was returned to the First Protectorate Parliament of 1654 for Cambridgeshire, and to the Second Protectorate Parliament in 1656 for Somersetshire. In the Second Parliament, he introduced the \"Militia Bill\" which was voted down by one hundred and twenty four votes to eighty eight. If passed it would have helped to finance the Army by imposing a ten percent \"Decimation Tax\", on known Royalists.\n\nIn July 1657, he became a member of the Protector's Privy Council, and in 1658 he accepted a seat in Cromwell's Other House (House of Lords).\n\nIn spite of his near relationship to the Protectors family, he was one of the most violent opponents of the assumption by Cromwell of the royal title, and after the Protector's death, instead of supporting the interests and government of his nephew Richard Cromwell, he was, with Charles Fleetwood, the chief instigator and organizer of the hostility of the army towards his administration, and forced Richard Cromwell by threats and menaces to dissolve his Third Protectorate Parliament in April 1659. Desborough was chosen a member of the Council of State by the restored Rump Parliament, and made colonel and governor of Plymouth, but presenting with other officers a seditious petition from the Army Council, on 5 October 1659, was about a week later dismissed. After the exclusion of the Rump Parliament from the Palace of Westminster by Fleetwood on 13 October, he was chosen by the officers a member of the new administration and commissary-general of the horse.\n\nThe new military government, however, rested on no solid foundation, and its leaders quickly found themselves without any influence. Desborough himself became an object of ridicule, his regiment even revolted against him, and on the return of the Rump he was ordered to quit London. At the Restoration he was excluded from the 1660 Indemnity and Oblivion Act but not included in the clause of pains and penalties extending to life and goods, being therefore only incapacitated from public employment. Soon afterwards he was arrested on suspicion of conspiring to kill the king and queen, but was quickly liberated. Subsequently he escaped to the Netherlands, where he engaged in republican intrigues. Accordingly, he was ordered home, in April 1666, on pain of incurring the charge of treason, and obeying was imprisoned in the Tower of London until February 1667, when he was examined before the council and set free.\n\nDesborough died in 1680. By his first wife, Cromwell's sister, he had one daughter and seven sons; he married a second wife in April 1658 whose name is unrecorded. Desborough was a good soldier and nothing more; and his only conception of government was by force and by the army. His rough person and manners are the constant theme of ridicule in the royalist ballads, and he is caricatured by Samuel Butler in \"Hudibras\" and in the \"Parable of the Lion and the Fox\".\n\n"}

Ordained as a Gelugpa monk, he was the first American to receive the Geshe degree at Sera Monastery in Tibet. He has started a number of businesses and organizations, written books about Buddhism, and translated Tibetan Buddhist teachings.\n\nRoach has written and lectured that yoga, meditation, and a practice of helping others—even competitors—leads to financial prosperity. He has at times been the center of controversy for his views, teachings, activities, and behavior.\n\nMichael Roach was born in Los Angeles, California in 1952 to Episcopalian parents, and grew up in Phoenix, Arizona. After his high school graduation, he received the Presidential Scholars Medallion from U.S. President Richard Nixon, then attended Princeton University in 1972. He traveled to India in 1973 to seek Buddhist instruction, while still in college. He returned to the United States and received a scholarship to return to study in India in 1974. While in India, Roach learned about a Tibetan Buddhist monastery in New Jersey led by a Mongolian-born lama, Sermey Khensur Lobsang Tharchin. Roach returned to Princeton, living at the monastery from 1975 to 1981. In the year before his graduation in 1975, both of his parents died due to cancer and then his brother committed suicide. In 1983 he was ordained as a Gelugpa Buddhist monk at Sera Monastery in South India, where he would periodically travel and study. In 1995, he became the first American to qualify for the Geshe degree.\n\nBeginning in 1981, Roach helped found and run Andin International, a jewelry manufacturer based in New York. He used proceeds from his work to set up financial endowments to fund various projects, in particular the Sera Mey Food Fund.\n\nRoach used these experiences as the basis for a book, \"The Diamond Cutter\", in which he explains how to apply the lessons of the Diamond Cutter Sutra in the context of business.\n\nIn 1987, Roach founded the Asian Classics Input Project (ACIP). He founded ACIP with the goal of producing a complete and electronically searchable version of the Kangyur and Tengyur, together with related philosophical commentaries and dictionaries. ACIP has input over 8,500 texts—nearly half a million pages—which it has made available for free. ACIP also provides a means of earning income for many Tibetan refugees.\n\nFrom 1993 to 1999, Roach developed and taught 18 courses on Tibetan Buddhism in New York City. These courses were based on the training monks receive in Tibetan monasteries, but organized to be taught in a conventional western setting.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2003, Roach organized and led a three-year silent retreat in the Arizona desert with five other participants including another American Buddhist, Christie McNally, with whom Roach had a complex and controversial relationship. The retreat was run along guidelines modified for modern times from ancient Tibetan traditions.\n\nIn 2004, Roach established Diamond Mountain Center, a Buddhist retreat center and seminary in Arizona.\n\nIn 1981, Khen Rinpoche, the teacher of Michael Roach, instructed him to set up a business in Manhattan to help Tibetan refugees. Since then, Michael Roach has helped to found and develop the corporation Andin International, a jewelry manufacturer based in New York. The activities of Andin International started with a loan of $50,000 and three employees. By the time Michael Roach left the firm in 1999 as vice president, the company's annual turnover was $100 million per year. In 2009 Andin achieved a turnover of more than 200 million dollars, and was acquired by Richline Group Warren Buffett. He used the money from his work to create funds to finance various projects, such as food fund Sera Mey.\n\nIn 1999, the publishing house Doubleday Corporation, which is now part of Penguin Random House, invited Roach to write a book about the style of management for. He used his life experience as the basis for the book \"Diamond Cutter\", in which he explains how to apply the lessons of the Sutra of the Diamond Cutter (Diamond Sutra) in the context of business.\n\nIn 1987, Roach founded the Asian Classics Input Project (ACIP). He founded this project in order to create a complete and accessible version of Kangyur and Tanjur in electronic form along with related philosophical commentaries and dictionaries. ACIP contains more than 8500 texts - almost half a million pages, which he provided for free, and has digitized 15286 books over the course of 31 years.\n\nACIP also provides funds to generate income for many Tibetan refugees. ACIP creates valuable jobs, especially for many women who otherwise would not have a chance to find work or learn to work on the computer.\n\nIn 1996, Christie McNally became Roach's student and they began a \"spiritual partnership\" in which they took vows that included never being more than 15 feet apart, eating from the same plate, reading the same books together. They were married in a Christian ceremony in Rhode Island in 1998. The marriage was kept secret. When news of the marriage emerged in 2003, Roach explained to the \"New York Times\" that they had wished to honor their Christian heritage and that he wanted McNally to be entitled to his possessions if something happened to him.\n\nMarriage is a breach of Gelug monastic vows. Professor Robert Thurman urged Roach to \"renounce his monastic vows and to stop wearing the robes that mark him as a member of a monastic order.\" Lama Surya Das has also questioned the wisdom of the partnership.\n\nWhen Roach proposed to teach in Dharamshala in 2006, the Office of the Dalai Lama rebuffed his plan, stating that Roach's \"unconventional behavior does not accord with His Holiness’s teachings and practices\"; the teaching took place in nearby Palampur instead.\n\nMcNally and Roach separated in the middle of 2009.\n\nIan Thorson was a close student of Roach and McNally and served as their attendant. In 2010, one year after the dissolution of her marriage to Roach, McNally married Thorson. A few weeks later, they entered a three-year retreat at the Diamond Mountain Center; McNally was appointed as the retreat director and guiding teacher. After reports emerged of a series of erratic and even violent episodes between Thorson and McNally, and bizarre behavior by McNally in talks to the community, the Diamond Mountain board of directors asked McNally and her husband to leave the retreat, giving them a few hundred dollars and offering them airfare to any desired destination. Thorson and McNally left the Diamond Mountain property, setting up camp in a cave on Bureau of Land Management property within the retreat boundaries, secretly supplied by a number of retreat participants who felt themselves loyal to the pair. Thorson, aged 38, died in April 2012 of dehydration and exposure while McNally, then 39, would recover from dehydration and exposure. Authorities said that there was no suspected foul play in his death, and that there was no criminal responsibility on behalf of Roach. However, several journalists have noted that Roach's unorthodox teachings through ACI fostered dangerous outcomes.\n\n\n"}

Educated in the United States, he was the chief engineer responsible for construction of the Peking-Kalgan Railway (Beijing to Zhangjiakou), the first railway constructed in China without foreign assistance. For his contributions to railroad engineering in China, Zhan is known as the \"Father of China's Railroad\".\n\nZhan was born in Namhoi (Nanhai) county (now Guangzhou) in Guangdong. His family, which had long participated in business and commerce, came from Wuyuan County in Huizhou, Anhui (now in Jiangxi). In 1872, as a twelve-year-old, he was chosen by Qing imperial officials to be sent to the United States as part of the Chinese Educational Mission. Together with thirty boys of similar age, he arrived in Connecticut, United States. After studying at a primary school in New Haven, he entered the Hillhouse High School there, and in 1878, was admitted to the Sheffield Scientific School of Yale University. His major was Civil Engineering, with an emphasis in railroad construction, and received his Ph.B. degree in 1881. He was considered lucky, because only a few months after his graduation, the Qing government decided to recall all students studying in the United States. Of those who were sent abroad, only he and another student were able to complete their college degrees.\n\nThe Qing government officials found the behavior of the foreign-educated students to be \"un-Chinese\". They had adopted many Western practices such as playing baseball and wearing shirts and pants instead of traditional robes and had their queues cut off. Instead of utilizing their talents to the fullest, the government sent them all, including Zhan, to work as translators or as officers in the newly formed Imperial Navy. Zhan was sent to the Foochow Arsenal. A few years later, in 1884, the Imperial Navy at Fuchow was destroyed during the Sino-French War.\n\nIn 1888, Zhan was finally able to realize his dream of becoming an engineer. Viceroy Li Hongzhang in Peking was constructing a railroad that would link Tientsin to the coal mines in Tangshan. A British engineer, Claude W. Kinder, was hired as the chief engineer of the railroad. Through connections with his old schoolmates working in Peking, Zhan joined Kinder as an intern engineer. He was soon promoted to engineer, and later the district engineer. The railway that he worked on was later extended to become the Peking Mukden Line. He spent 12 years on various sections of this line before his next major assignment.\n\nIn 1902, Yuan Shikai decided to build a special line for Empress Dowager Cixi so she could visit the tombs of her royal ancestors. Kinder was the original candidate for chief engineer, however the French were unhappy that an Englishman was assigned to the position. Eventually, Zhan got the assignment as the chief engineer of the stub line. He managed to construct the railroad within budget and to a very tight schedule. The Empress was pleased and permission was given to construct more railroads in China.\n\nIn 1905, the Imperial Qing government decided to build a railroad that would link the capital of Peking to the important trade city of Kalgan to the north. This railway would be of strategic importance to the government. The decision was therefore made that the railway would be built without foreign assistance. Capital would come from the government, and no foreign engineers were to be hired. Zhan was once again appointed as chief engineer of the railway. In the beginning, some people were skeptical that the government would be able to construct the railroad all by itself in the rugged mountains north of Peking. However, Zhan showed he was an able engineer and completed the work two years ahead of schedule and under budget. He included a zig zag section near the Qinglongqiao (Ching-lung-chiao) railway station to overcome the steep gradient. When excavating the Badaling railway tunnel, he accelerated construction by drilling a vertical shaft into the path of the tunnel. This doubled the number of digging teams that could be employed. He was also said to be a technical advisor for the construction of the Lo Wu Bridge built in 1906 as part of the Kowloon-Canton Railway.\n\nZhan was subsequently elected a member of the North British Academy of Arts in 1909. He was a founding member of the Chinese Institute of Engineers, and was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Hong Kong in 1916. He was elected to the American Society of Civil Engineers in 1909. A notice following his death written by his American peers called him the \"Father of Chinese Railroads.\" \n\nIn 1919, Zhan died in Hankou, Hubei at the age of 57, and was buried at the Qinglongqiao railway station, where the Peking-Kalgan (Beijing-Zhangjiakou) railway crossed the Great Wall and the rugged mountains north of Beijing. A museum was also established nearby to commemorate his achievements.\n\nZhan's descendants range from Eastern China to the Philippines to the United States. His great grandnephew, Carl Cham (), with an alias of \"Jhobert Bakumbakal,\" carries his family's trademark name.\n\n"}
{"id": "1801956", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1801956", "title": "The New York Five", "text": "The New York Five\n\nThe New York Five was a group of architects based in New York City whose work was featured in the 1972 book \"Five Architects\". The architects, Peter Eisenman, Michael Graves, Charles Gwathmey, John Hejduk and Richard Meier, are also often referred to as \"the Whites.\" Other architects and theorists have been associated with the group, including Werner Seligmann, Kenneth Frampton, Colin Rowe, and Gwathmey's partner Robert Siegel.\n\nThe work featured in \"Five Architects\" was originally developed in a series of meetings held by the Committee of Architects for the Study of the Environment (CASE) at the Museum of Modern Art. The director of MOMA's Department of Architecture and Design, Arthur Drexler, invited a group of architects to present photographs of recent built projects to a panel of critics. Another meeting followed in 1971. Drexler edited a volume of work by five of these architects, published in 1972 by Wittenborn & Company and reprinted by Oxford University Press in 1975. \"Five Architects\" featured a preface by Drexler and critical essays by Colin Rowe and Kenneth Frampton. Later editions included a postscript by Philip Johnson.\n\nThe name \"Whites\" was used to refer to the group in the architectural press by 1973. Michael Graves later stated that he did not know who originally coined \"the Whites,\" but Philip Johnson was the first to refer to the group as \"the New York Five.\" \"The Whites\" describes the frequent use of white paint in the built works of the New York Five, as well as the white cardboard models they frequently presented. It also alludes to the group's affinity with the work of Le Corbusier, such as the white exterior surfaces of Villa Savoye. This affinity would later be used by many critics disparagingly, to suggest that the work of the New York Five was excessively uncritical of modernism, or that their work was an unimaginative copy of Le Corbusier's.\n\nIn response to \"Five Architects\", Robert A. M. Stern organized a forum of responses, titled \"Five on Five,\" that was published in the May 1973 issue of \"Architectural Forum\". The five responding architects were Romaldo Giurgola, Allan Greenberg, Charles Moore, Jaquelin T. Robertson, and Stern himself. This group would come to be known as \"the Grays\" and were closely associated with Vincent Scully, Philadelphia architect Robert Venturi and the emerging interest in vernacular architecture, New Classical Architecture and early postmodernism, with three of \"the Grays\" and one of \"the Whites\" eventually winning the prestigious Driehaus Architecture Prize.\n\nThe work of the New York Five has been characterized by architectural historians as an important moment in the history of postmodernism and critiques of modernism.\n\n"}

The New York Asian Film Festival generally features contemporary premieres and classic titles from Eastern Asia and Southeast Asia (particularly Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, China, Philippines, and Thailand), though South Asian cinema has also been represented via films from India and Pakistan. The NYAFF displays many of its films as a first-and-only screening in the country, giving audiences the chance to see these films, although they would not be normally distributed in the United States. The up-and-coming actors and directors of the exhibited films are brought over as special guests of the NYAFF every year. Genres featured in the film festival includes Horror film, Gangster/Crime, Martial Arts, and Action. \nFrom its inception in 2002 through 2018, the festival was programmed and operated by Subway Cinema. The Film Society of Lincoln Center has worked in collaboration with Subway Cinema to operate the annual festival since 2010. In 2019, Subway Cinema and the New York Asian Film Festival became wholly separate legal entities. The New York Asian Film Festival is now owned and operated by the nonprofit organization the New York Asian Film Foundation Inc. Every year the annual film festival is curated by long time executive director Samuel Jamier, and programmers Claire Marty, David Wilentz, Karen Severns, and Koichi Mori. The festival is now attempting to stray away from curation and increase the amount of films that are directly submitted by filmmakers. \n\nUntil 2007, the festival was held annually at the Anthology Film Archives and/or The ImaginAsian, usually around the end of June and early July. In 2007, the festival moved to the IFC Center and Japan Society, and in 2010, the Lincoln Center became the festival's primary home, though select screenings are also held at School of Visual Arts. \n\nStarting in 2008, in addition to the Audience Award, the festival also handed out a Jury Prize.

{"id": "1801973", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1801973", "title": "National Democratic Union (Brazil)", "text": "National Democratic Union (Brazil)\n\nThe National Democratic Union (, UDN) was a political party that existed in Brazil between 1945 and 1965. It was ideologically aligned with conservatism. During most of its existence, it was the country's second-strongest party. Its symbol was an Olympic torch and its motto was \"The price of freedom is eternal vigilance\", a quote falsely attributed to Thomas Jefferson.\n\nAt the end of Getúlio Vargas' Estado Novo regime in 1945, political parties were allowed to reorganize themselves and to run in the general elections of that year. UDN grouped the main leaders of the opposition against the populism of the outgoing president. This constant opposition to Vargas was the party's main characteristic. Therefore, its main opponents were the Social Democratic Party (PSD) and the Brazilian Labour Party (PTB), formed to give support to Vargas among the elite and the working class, respectively.\n\nUDN was defeated in the presidential elections of 1945, 1950 and 1955, but remained the second largest party in the National Congress, second only to PSD, from 1945 until 1962, when it was surpassed by PTB. The main political figure of UDN was Carlos Lacerda, a staunch enemy of Vargas, whose second presidency (1951–1954) was bitterly opposed by UDN. An assassination attempt against Lacerda led to Vargas' suicide. On 1960, UDN preferred not to launch a presidential candidate, supporting the victorious Jânio Quadros instead. Although Quadros was not a UDN member himself, most of the ministers in the Quadros Cabinet were members of UDN. The party was soon dissatisfied with Quadros, who resigned in a clumsy political maneuver. Without UDN's support, Quadros lost the majority of seats in the Congress, and soon found out it was impossible to govern without the backing of the Parliament. On August 21, 1961, just eight months after his inauguration, he resigned, hoping to return to power via popular acclaim.\n\nVice President João Goulart from PTB (at that time, Brazilians would vote for President and Vice President separately) then took office. As soon as 1962, UDN began to conspire with military officers to topple him. A political protégé of Vargas, Goulart launched a Basic Reforms plan, predicting education reform, land reform, urban reform, electoral reform and tax reform. That was labelled by UDN as a Soviet influence on Brazilian politics. The plan also made PSD withdraw its support to the Goulart government in the National Congress, leaving him in a complicated situation. On April 1964, Goulart was deposed by a US-backed military coup d'état, which had the support of most UDN members. Lacerda, then governor of the Guanabara State hoped to win the scheduled presidential election of 1965. However, the military regime cancelled this election and suppressed all the political parties, including UDN. Most of its members subsequently joined the National Renewal Alliance Party (\"Aliança Renovadora Nacional – Arena\"), a new party created to endorse the military regime.\n\nEven before UDN supported the 1964 Brazilian Coup d'état, opponents of UDN characterized it as a \"golpista\" (pro-coups d'état) party. However, the party was not conservative as a whole. Liberal and authoritarian, conservative and progressive theses coexisted in UDN. For instance, it voted in favor of the state monopoly on oil and against the impeachment of Communist members of the Congress. On the other hand, it denounced the \"Communist infiltration\" in public administration, and strongly opposed government intervention in the economy. As a matter of fact, members of the Democratic Left faction, which defected UDN to form the Brazilian Socialist Party (PSB), characterized the party as a free market advocate, citing this as one of the reasons for the defection. Contesting the results whenever losing an election was also a common practice inside UDN.\n\nThe party was marked by binding itself with the Brazilian Army and the aspirations of urban middle classes, all of which became unofficially known as \"udenismo\". An expression of the attitudes of its leaders towards politics, \"udenismo\" was characterized by defending classical liberalism, clinging to higher education and morality, and repulsing populism (as well as characterizing it as bad).\n\n\n"}

On April 19 was baptized, and given his Christian name Daniel Austin. Not long after, his family moved to Newport, Rhode Island. At Newport, he was a student at the Academy of the Sisters of Mercy. Dowling attended Manhattan College in New York City, and graduated with his A.B. degree with high honors in 1887. Dowling made his theological studies at St. John's Seminary in Brighton, Massachusetts.\n\nDowling was ordained to the Roman Catholic priesthood on June 24, 1891 for the Diocese of Providence. Afterwards, he worked on his graduate studies in theology and church history at the Catholic University.\n\nAfter serving as a pastor in Warren, Rhode Island for a year, Dowling went to the Brighton Seminary where, for two and a half years he taught Church History. History was always a passion of Dowling. Marvin O'Connell stated that he was \"a man who was by taste, habit and profession an historian; he could not set about finding solutions to problems facing him until he examined those problems in the light of the past.\" Even his sermons as Bishop of Des Moines and as Archbishop of St. Paul were mainly of an historical character. He was one of the first to welcome the creation of the \"Catholic Historical Review\", and one of the first life members of the American Catholic Historical Association. He also contributed articles to the \"Catholic Encyclopedia\".\n\nLater, in 1896, Dowling spent two years as editor of the \"Providence Visitor\", and became one of the better known Catholic editors in the United States. Afterwards, he was assistant at St. Joseph's, Providence, then pastor of St. Mary's, Warren and then rector of the Providence Cathedral.\n\nIn 1912, the Holy See appointed Dowling as the bishop of the Diocese of Des Moines, Iowa. His peers saw the action as recognition of his talents, while Dowling felt as if he were being sent into \"exile\" in the West.\n\nDowling had a fine intellect and excellent organizational skills. As Bishop of Des Moines, Dowling was appreciated for his courage, simplicity, kindness, and especially his commitment to education. In 1918, Des Moines Catholic College was founded by Dowling; it later became Dowling Catholic High School.\n\nOn January 31, 1919, Dowling was appointed to be Archbishop of Saint Paul, Minnesota. In his address at his installation on March 25, 1919, Dowling described himself as \"the unknown, the unexpected, [and] the undistinguished successor of the great Archbishop Ireland.\"\n\nIn the decade that followed, Dowling had many accomplishments, including: The establishment of the Archbishop Ireland's Education Fund; the improvement of St. Paul Seminary; and being on the board of Education of the Catholic National Welfare Conference (now known as the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops or USCCB). He was known for his contributions to education and love of Church history.\n\nDuring the last years of his life Archbishop Dowling's health was seriously impaired because his heart was not functioning normally, and the resultant circulatory disorders gave rise to complications that were life-threatening on several occasions. During the summer of 1929 he collapsed while on a confirmation tour and a critical illness resulted. For a time he recovered to the point that he was able to walk on his own, but pneumonia developed. Dowling lapsed into unconsciousness four hours before his peaceful death in the late morning of Saturday, November 29, 1930, at his residence on Summit Avenue, directly across from the St. Paul Cathedral.\n\nIn the first decade of the 20th century, immigration jumped from a low of 3.5 million in that decade to a high of 9 million due to the depression of the 1890s. \"After 1914, immigration dropped off because of the war, and later because of immigration restrictions imposed in the 1920s.\" Dowling described the challenge for Catholics in the post-World War I era as follows:\nThe challenge for American Catholics during the 1920s was that immigrants came to America poor and disadvantaged and they \"associated the catholic religion with their old countries\". As immigrants improved their quality of life and became more \"American,\" culture and religion was lost and forgotten. Dowling summarized it best saying, \"as they progress in wealth and station they frequently strive to hide their origins, to change their names and affect manners that do not belong to them. Even when they keep up the practice of their religion, they are frequently ashamed of it.\"\n\nDowling argued that the solution would be to convince people that \"foreignism\" and Catholicism were not intimately linked. World War I provided opportunity for Catholics to prove their patriotism. The National Catholic War Council was established to coordinate programs for Chaplains and refugees, and develop ecumenical and interfaith relations.\n\nThe Council also fostered Catholic unity across the United States, leading to the postwar organization of the National Catholic Welfare Conference in 1919. Five departments were organized: Education, Social Work, Press and Literature, Lay Societies, and Home and Foreign Missions. Dowling was named treasurer and chairman of the Department of Education. He served in those positions for a decade until his condition of health required that he give up the duties. Presently, the Church operates the world's largest non-governmental school system.\n\nAt the first anniversary requiem for his predecessor, Dowling commemorated Archbishop John Ireland's contributions to education and mandated the establishment the Archbishop Ireland Educational Fund. He said that the present needs for education were \"to develop, coordinate and consolidate the education system to provide for greater efficiency.\" To accomplish this he announced a campaign to raise $5,000,000.\n\nAfter 5 years, in September 1925, 45,551 people had pledged a total of $4,392,872.50, but 21,898 had made no payments. Unpaid pledges amounted to $1700,000. Efforts were made to collect delinquent pledges, and before the end of the year the number was reduced, leaving 5,375 delinquent pledges in St. Paul; 6,303 in Minneapolis; and 9,042 in the country. The average individual pledge was around $100.\n\nThe largest allocation of the fund was $1,280,000 for the \"construction and partial endowment of the preparatory seminary known as Nazareth Hall.\" Other major allocations include: $200,000 to the endowment fund of the College of St. Catherine. $150,000 to St. Thomas College.\n\nThe preparatory seminary was built on property on the shore of Lake Johanna, outside the corporate limits of the Twin Cities. Rearden describes Dowling's relationship with the school:\n\nThe establishment of Nazareth Hall had a large impact on the St. Paul Seminary. Thereafter, the majority of the students would be prepared in a cloistered environment, which Dowling believed was more appropriate than a college campus. Dowling believed that the priest of the future \"should be armed before to overcome the temptations of the times,\" and that the best was to do that was to ground them on the firm foundation of interior life and school them in the practice of priestly virtues.\n\nDowling also believed in the rigors of academic challenge, from his years at the Brighton college. To create the strong theological factory he desired, Dowling appointed Humphrey Moynihan as rector of the Saint Paul Seminary. Moynihan emphasized culture and refinement in his teaching.\n\nDowling had a personal interest in the seminarians attending the school. It was said that the Archbishop had \"a keen eye for every candidate for the priesthood.\" In fact, he knew many of the boys at Nazareth Hall as well as their teachers knew them. Many felt that his influence on their lives continued on after their leaving Saint Paul Seminary, to ordination and beyond.\n\nNazareth Hall closed in 1970. The former Nazareth Hall building is now part of the Protestant evangelical University of Northwestern – St. Paul campus and is one of the university's two main administrative buildings. The building retains the name \"Nazareth Hall.\" Much of its original Catholic architecture remains intact, including the main chapel and the Stations of the Cross. Though Northwestern espouses Protestant theology and the student body is overwhelmingly Protestant, the school accepts Catholic student applications, and there is a very small minority of Catholic students on campus.\n\n\n"}

Refusing to cooperate with Roach or the board, the two were asked to leave Diamond Mountain University and its properties for at least one year. Unknown to the board, the couple retreated to a nearby cave on public land, supported secretly by some followers.

{"id": "1802050", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1802050", "title": "Variogram", "text": "Variogram\n\nIn spatial statistics the theoretical variogram formula_1 is a function describing the degree of spatial dependence of a spatial random field or stochastic process formula_2.\n\nIn the case of a concrete example from the field of gold mining, a variogram will give a measure of how much two samples taken from the mining area will vary in gold percentage depending on the distance between those samples. Samples taken far apart will vary more than samples taken close to each other.\n\nThe semivariogram formula_3 was first defined by Matheron (1963) as half the average squared difference between points (formula_4 and formula_5) separated at distance formula_6. Formally\n\nwhere formula_8 is a point in the geometric field formula_9, and formula_10 is the value at that point. For example, suppose we are interested in iron content in soil samples in some region or field formula_9. formula_10 would be the content (e.g., in mg iron per kg soil) of iron at some location formula_8, where formula_8 has coordinates of latitude, longitude, and depth. The triple integral is over 3 dimensions. formula_6 is the separation distance (e.g., in m or km) of interest. To obtain the semivariogram for a given formula_3, all pairs of points at that exact distance would be sampled. In practice it is impossible to sample everywhere, so the empirical variogram is used instead.\n\nThe variogram is defined as the variance of the difference between field values at two locations (formula_4 and formula_5, note change of notation from formula_8 to formula_20 and formula_21 to formula_22) across realizations of the field (Cressie 1993):\n\nor in other words is twice the semivariogram. If the spatial random field has constant mean formula_24, this is equivalent to the expectation for the squared increment of the values between locations formula_4 and formula_26 (Wackernagel 2003) (where formula_4 and formula_5 are points in space and possibly time):\n\nIn the case of a stationary process, the variogram and semivariogram can be represented as a function formula_30 of the difference formula_31 between locations only, by the following relation (Cressie 1993):\n\nIf the process is furthermore isotropic, then the variogram and semivariogram can be represented by a function formula_33 of the distance formula_34 only (Cressie 1993):\n\nThe indexes formula_36 or formula_37 are typically not written. The terms are used for all three forms of the function. Moreover, the term \"variogram\" is sometimes used to denote the semivariogram, and the symbol formula_38 is sometimes used for the variogram, which brings some confusion.\n\nAccording to (Cressie 1993, Chiles and Delfiner 1999, Wackernagel 2003) the theoretical variogram has the following properties:\n\nGenerally an empirical variogram is needed, because sample information formula_22 is not available for every location. The sample information for example could be concentration of iron in soil samples, or pixel intensity on a camera. Each piece of sample information has coordinates formula_57 for a 2D sample space where formula_58 and formula_59 are geographical coordinates. In the case of the iron in soil, the sample space could be 3 dimensional. If there is temporal variability as well (e.g., phosphorus content in a lake) then formula_20 could be a 4 dimensional vector formula_61. For the case where dimensions have different units (e.g., distance and time) then a scaling factor formula_62 can be applied to each to obtain a modified Euclidean distance.\n\nSample observations are denoted formula_63. Samples may be taken at formula_64 total different locations. This would provide as set of samples formula_65 at locations formula_66. Generally plots show the semivariogram values as a function of sample point separation formula_6. In the case of empirical semivariogram, separation distance bins formula_68 are used rather than exact distances, and usually isotropic conditions are assumed (i.e., that formula_38 is only a function of formula_6 and does not depend on other variables such as center position). Then, the empirical semivariogram formula_71 can be calculated for each bin:\n\nformula_72\n\nOr in other words, each pair of points separated by formula_6 (plus or minus some bin width tolerance range formula_74) are found. These form the set of points formula_75. The number of these points in this bin is formula_76. Then for each pair of points formula_77, the square of the difference in the observation (e.g., soil sample content or pixel intensity) is found (formula_78). These squared differences are added together and normalized by the natural number formula_76. By definition the result is divided by 2 for the semivariogram at this separation.\n\nFor computational speed, only the unique pairs of points are needed. For example, for 2 observations pairs [formula_80] taken from locations with separation formula_68 only [formula_80] need to be considered, as the pairs [formula_83] do not provide any additional information.\n\nThe \"empirical variogram\" is used in geostatistics as a first estimate of the (theoretical) variogram needed for spatial interpolation by kriging. \nAccording to (Cressie 1993), for observations formula_84 from a stationary random field formula_2, the empirical variogram with lag tolerance 0 is an unbiased estimator of the theoretical semivariogram, due to:\n\nformula_86\n\nThe following parameters are often used to describe variograms:\n\n\nThe empirical variogram cannot be computed at every lag distance formula_6 and due to variation in the estimation it is not ensured that it is a valid variogram, as defined above. However some Geostatistical methods such as kriging need valid semivariograms. In applied geostatistics the empirical variograms are thus often approximated by model function ensuring validity (Chiles&Delfiner 1999). Some important models are (Chiles&Delfiner 1999, Cressie 1993):\n\n\n\n\nThe parameter formula_94 has different values in different references, due to the ambiguity in the definition of the range. E.g. formula_95 is the value used in (Chiles&Delfiner 1999). The formula_96 function is 1 if formula_97 and 0 otherwise.\n\nThree functions are used in geostatistics for describing the spatial or the temporal correlation of observations: these are the correlogram, the covariance and the semivariogram. The last is also more simply called variogram. The sampling variogram, unlike the semivariogram and the variogram, shows where a significant degree of spatial dependence in the sample space or sampling unit dissipates into randomness when the variance terms of a temporally or \"in-situ\" ordered set are plotted against the variance of the set and the lower limits of its 99% and 95% confidence ranges.\n\nThe variogram is the key function in geostatistics as it will be used to fit a model of the temporal/spatial correlation of the observed phenomenon. One is thus making a distinction between the \"experimental variogram\" that is a visualisation of a possible spatial/temporal correlation and the \"variogram model\" that is further used to define the weights of the kriging function. Note that the experimental variogram is an empirical estimate of the covariance of a Gaussian process. As such, it may not be positive definite and hence not directly usable in kriging, without constraints or further processing. This explains why only a limited number of variogram models are used: most commonly, the linear, the spherical, the Gaussian and the exponential models.\n\nThe squared term in the variogram, for instance formula_98, can be replaced with different powers: A \"madogram\" is defined with the absolute difference, formula_99, and a \"rodogram\" is defined with the square root of the absolute difference, formula_100. Estimators based on these lower powers are said to be more resistant to outliers. They can be generalized as a \"variogram of order \"α\"\",\n\nin which a variogram is of order 2, a madogram is a variogram of order 1, and a rodogram is a variogram of order 0.5.\n\nWhen a variogram is used to describe the correlation of different variables it is called \"cross-variogram\". Cross-variograms are used in co-kriging.\nShould the variable be binary or represent classes of values, one is then talking about \"indicator variograms\". Indicator variogram is used in indicator kriging.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Murray was born in Waterbury, Connecticut, to William and Mary Ellen (née Connor) Murray. His parents were both Irish immigrants; his father was from Carrickmacross, County Monaghan, and his mother was from Maryborough, County Leix. One of his brothers, James, was a prominent lawyer in New York City. He worked as a paperboy in his youth. He received his early education at Waterbury Public Schools and graduated from high school in 1895.\n\nMurray attended Holy Cross College in Worcester, Massachusetts, where he graduated in 1897 with the highest honors ever bestowed upon a student until that time. He continued his studies at the University of Louvain in Belgium.\n\nWhile in Louvain, Murray was ordained to the priesthood on April 14, 1900. His first assignments, following his return to Connecticut, were as chaplain at Hartford County Jail and as professor of Greek and Latin at St. Thomas Preparatory Seminary. He became chancellor of the Diocese of Hartford in 1903.\n\nOn November 15, 1919, Murray was appointed auxiliary bishop of Hartford and titular bishop of \"Flavias\" by Pope Benedict XV. He received his episcopal consecration on April 28, 1920 from Archbishop Giovanni Bonzano, with Bishops John Joseph Nilan and Thomas Joseph Shahan serving as co-consecrators. He selected as his episcopal motto: \"Mea Omnia Tua\" (Latin: \"My Everything is Yours\").\n\nMurray was the first native of Connecticut to become a Catholic bishop, and the first auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Hartford. In addition to his episcopal duties, he was named pastor of St. Patrick's Church in Downtown Hartford in 1922.\n\nFollowing the death of Bishop Louis Sebastian Walsh, Murray was appointed the fifth Bishop of Portland, Maine, by Pope Pius XI on May 29, 1925. His installation took place at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception on October 12 of that year. During his five-year tenure in Portland, Murray established thirty new parishes and dedicated himself to Catholic education. He also founded a diocesan weekly newspaper, \"Church World\", in 1930.\n\nDuring the Great Depression, Murray organized relief committees to raise money for the homeless and unemployed families. He was required to obtain loans and to mortgage church property to continue funding hospitals, orphanages, and other institutions. Consequently, the diocese accumulated millions of dollars in debt.\n\nMurray was appointed the third Archbishop of Saint Paul, Minnesota, on October 29, 1931. He was installed at the Cathedral of Saint Paul on January 27, 1932. To address the continuing effects of the Great Depression, Murray began a crusade of charity to support the poor and unemployed, and made himself available to the public by taking public transit and walking in the downtown areas.\n\nDuring his 24-year tenure, Murray established over 50 new parishes, eliminated debt at the College of St. Thomas, and constructed a science hall, gymnasium, and a new seminary library. He also began a radio show on WCCO called \"Church of the Air,\" established the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine, the Family Guild, and mandated liturgical reform in the archdiocese. In 1941, the national Eucharistic Congress was held at Saint Paul, an event which many considered a testament to Murray's influence. In 1949, he ordered Catholic parents to not allow their children to receive sex education in public or private schools. He also served as a member of the administrative board of the National Catholic Welfare Council.\n\nMurray died of cancer at age 79, and is interred at Resurrection Cemetery.\n\n"}

He is considered by many to be the greatest driver ever to have raced in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, earning the nickname \"Mr Le Mans\". Elsewhere Kristensen also holds the record for most wins at the 12 Hours of Sebring with a total of six.\n\nIn August 2014, Kristensen was appointed Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog by the Queen of Denmark. In January 2018 he was inducted into the Danish Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nKristensen was born in Hobro. His career began in 1984, winning several karting titles. He raced in Japan in the early 1990s, concurrently in Formula 3 and Touring Cars. He was German Formula 3 Champion in 1991, Japanese Formula 3 champion in 1993, and runner-up in the Japanese Touring Car Championship (JTCC) in 1992 and 1994. He was 6th in Formula 3000 in both 1996 and 1997, and test driver for Tyrrell in their final Formula One season in 1998, and for Michelin as they prepared their F1 tyres using an older Williams car in 2000. He was 3rd in the STW Cup in Germany in 1999, 7th in the British Touring Car Championship in 2000, and winner of the 12 Hours of Sebring in both those years.\n\nOn 22 April 2007, Kristensen was involved in an accident while racing on the Hockenheimring race course in Hockenheim, Germany. The crash resulted in a long break from training for Kristensen, and his participation in the 2007 Le Mans race was in jeopardy. However, Kristensen recuperated quickly, and was cleared by the Le Mans doctors to start the race. It was reported that a new type of collar may have prevented him suffering a broken neck in the crash.\n\nIn 2000, 2001, and 2002, he won the 24 Hours at Le Mans race with the Audi R8 along with Frank Biela and Emanuele Pirro, becoming the first three drivers since Jacky Ickx in 1977 to win the race on three straight occasions. In 2003, he won the race with Bentley. In 2004, he equalled Ickx's record of six Le Mans victories in Team Goh's Audi R8. 2005 saw Kristensen win a seventh time with an American R8 entry, making him the most successful driver at the Le Mans 24-hour race (Ickx left a message on Kristensen's answering machine congratulating him on breaking his record). The 2006 race saw Kristensen finishing in third place in the new diesel-powered Audi R10. Kristensen did not finish the 2007 race following Rinaldo Capello's crash while the car was leading the race by four laps. Kristensen returned in 2008 to claim an eighth victory and extend the record for most wins. In 2013, he took his ninth victory at the event, extending his record and legendary status even further. Also he has received nickname \"Mr Le Mans\" because of the record of winning Le Mans 9 times total.\n\nOn 19 November 2014, Kristensen announced at a press conference in Copenhagen that he was retiring from motorsport at the end of the current World Endurance Championship season.\n\n – A non-championship one-off race was held in 2004 at the streets of Shanghai, China.\n"}

His two collections of poems \"Fribytterdrømme\" (1920, \"Freebooter Dreams\") and \"Mirakler\" (1922, \"Miracles\") are classics of Danish expressionism, marked by revolutionary artistic enthusiasm and restlessness. \"Påfuglefjeren\" (1922, \"The Peacock Feather\") which is inspired by a journey to China, is deeper and more sombre, especially the poem \"Henrettelsen\" (\"The Execution\") that is depicting a man's intense powers of observation just before he is beheaded, which can be considered a modernist manifesto. The contemporary novel \"Livets Arabesk\" (1921 – \"The Arabesque of Life\") is a revolutionary futuristic fantasy in expressionist form. He started his career as a literary reviewer and critic in \"Tilskueren\" in May 1923.\n\nIn 1930 he published perhaps his most well-known work, the novel \"Hærværk\" (literally: \"Vandalism\", published in English as \"Havoc\" in 1968). \"Hærværk\" is the story of Danish journalist Ole Jastrau who is driven to self-destruction by drinking himself to death. Apart from its presumed autobiographical character, it probably reflects the intellectual, political and personal crises of many writers and artists between the World Wars. A poem from this novel, \"Angst\" (\"Fear\"), with its fascination with disaster, has become a classic. The book is also considered one of the best literary Danish-language depictions of alcoholism.\n\nDuring the 1930s, Kristensen concentrated on commemorative poems, of which he was a master – many are found in \"Mod den yderste Rand\" (1936, \"Against the furthest Edge\") and \"Digte i Døgnet\" (1940, \"Poems a Day\"). A final collection of poems \"Den sidste Lygte\" (1954, \"The last Lamp\") parades the themes of his writings.\n\nBesides being a writer of fiction, Kristensen was a sharp and outstanding critic, and for thirty years he worked as a reviewer, mostly at the radical-liberal daily Politiken. As a critic he was lauded for his ability to enter into the spirit of his subject. He also wrote many collections of essays and travel books − most famously \"En Kavaler i Spanien\" (1927, \"A Gentleman in Spain\").\n\n\"En kavaler i Spanien\" (\"A Gentleman in Spain\") is a travel account of one of Kristensen's journeys. It is written in an expressionistic style and is thus a very subjective account. The book follows Tom Kristensen on his journey through Spain in the 1920s. He writes about the various sights, and about the people who he meets on the trip. He also describes his impression of bullfighting. The book contains many poems that were written on the journey. He meets fellow travellers, as well as a thief, all the while trying desperately to learn the Spanish language. In the end he longs for his home in Denmark, the books last sentence being \"I have to flee\".\n\nKristensen is one of the most important Danish lyricists of the 20th Century. His restless spirit and fascination with bullfighting has drawn comparisons with Hemingway.\n\nKristensen's final years were spent on the island of Thurø near Svendborg, where he died at the age of 80, and is buried.\n\n\n\n"}

Brady\n\nWilliam Otterwell Ignatius Brady (February 1, 1899 – October 1, 1961) was an American prelate of the Roman Catholic Church. He served as Bishop of Sioux Falls (1939–56) and Archbishop of Saint Paul (1956–61).\n\nWilliam Brady was born in Fall River, Massachusetts, to John J. and Gladys (née Davol) Brady. He had an older brother, Louis, and a younger sister, Leonora. He attended B.M.C. Durfee High School, where he was editor of the yearbook during his senior year. From 1916 to 1918, he attended St. Charles College in Catonsville, Maryland. He continued his studies at St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore (1918–20) and at the Theological College of The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. (1920–23). While at the Sulpician Seminary, Brady accepted an offer from Archbishop Austin Dowling to join the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Paul in Minnesota. He was ordained to the priesthood on December 21, 1923 in Fall River, Massachusetts.\n\nBrady earned a Bachelor of Sacred Theology degree from the Catholic University of America in 1924. In August of that year, he was sent to further his studies in Rome at the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas, better known as the \"Angelicum\". He later earned his Doctor of Sacred Theology \"summa cum laude\" in 1926. Upon his return to Minnesota in 1926, he became a professor of moral and pastoral theology at Saint Paul Seminary. \n\nBrady became rector of the Saint Paul Seminary in 1933 and remained in that position until 1939.\n\nOn June 10, 1939, Pope Pius XII appointed Brady bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Sioux Falls in Sioux Falls, South Dakota and he was ordained a bishop on August 24, 1939 by Archbishop John Gregory Murray at the Cathedral of St. Paul in St. Paul. \n\nOn June 16, 1956, Pope Pius XII appointed Bishop Brady Coadjutor Archbishop of St. Paul. Brady succeeded John Gregory Murray as Archbishop of St. Paul upon Murray's death on October 11, 1956 and served in the office until his own death.\n\nBrady was appointed as a consulter to the Pontifical Commission of Bishops and the Government of Dioceses for the Second Vatican Council. A little more than one year before the first session of Vatican II, Brady, who seemed to be in good health, left Minnesota to travel to the Vatican to attend a preparatory meeting of the Pontifical Commission to which he had been appointed. His journey began September 21, 1961 and included stops in both Chicago and Paris. On a flight from Paris to Rome on September 23 he was stricken with coronary thrombosis. He did not lose consciousness, and even walked into Salvator Mundi Hospital in Rome, where he had been driven. Several times he rallied and spoke of wanting to get back to work, but over eight days he had four heart attacks, the last of which brought about his death on October 1, 1961.\n\nAfter a first funeral Mass at the Church of Santa Susanna in Rome, Brady’s body was flown back to Minnesota on October 4 and was brought to the Cathedral of St. Paul in St. Paul on October 7. A vigil took place over two days as mourners waited in lines that stretched outside the cathedral and down the front steps. The main funeral Mass took place on October 9 at the Cathedral of St. Paul. The principal celebrant was Archbishop Leo Binz of Dubuque, who two months later was named Brady’s successor as Archbishop of St. Paul.\n\nBrady was commemorated in the naming of Archbishop Brady High School in West Saint Paul, Minnesota, which has since closed. Following the thread of other archbishops in the Archdiocese, Brady's namesake was given to two buildings at the University of St. Thomas (Minnesota). The first of these buildings is Brady Hall, which serves as one of the university's male residence halls. The second is Brady Educational Center, which houses the practice spaces for the musical ensembles of St. Thomas along with classroom space for the Saint Paul Seminary School of Divinity. Within the Brady Educational Center is an auditorium commonly used for both musical and dancing performances.\nEfforts to name a new facility after Brady have fallen short, as his relationship with the priests in the Diocese were not on good terms while he served as Archbishop.\n\nBishop Brady was instrumental in building the first two Catholic nursing homes in the State of South Dakota. The facility in Milbank, SD which has been operated under the care of the Daughters of St. Mary of Providence bears his name and from its inception has been known as St. William's (Care Center).\n"}

Sykes spent many years living and working in both Anchorage and Talkeetna.

He homesteaded in the community of Chase, near Talkeetna, and help to found the Chase Community Council. He and his wife currently live near Palmer in a solar-powered straw-bale house.\n\nIn 1990, Sykes became one of the founders of the Green Party of Alaska. As a result, Sykes initiated a lawsuit, \"Sykes v. Alaska\", relying heavily upon case law established in the earlier ballot access lawsuits of Joe Vogler during the 1970s and 1980s. The lawsuit allowed the Green Party onto the ballot in similar fashion to the original ballot access status of the Alaskan Independence Party prior to its becoming a recognized political party. This lawsuit also led to the lessening of the threshold needed to become recognized as a political party in Alaska. In the 1990 gubernatorial election, Sykes ran as the Green Party nominee and garnered 3.3% of the vote. This established Alaska as the first state to obtain ballot access for the Green Party in the United States.\n\nSykes continued to be active in Green Party politics, running for the U.S. Senate in twice in 2002 and 2004.

{"id": "1802079", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1802079", "title": "James Whitcomb", "text": "James Whitcomb\n\nJames Whitcomb (December 1, 1795 – October 4, 1852) was a Democratic United States Senator and the eighth Governor of Indiana. As governor during the Mexican–American War, he oversaw the formation and deployment of the state's levies. He led the movement to replace the state constitution and played an important role at the convention to institute a law that prevented the government from taking loans in response the current fiscal crisis in Indiana. By skillfully guiding the state through its bankruptcy, Whitcomb is usually credited as being one of the most successful of Indiana's governors. He was elected to the United States Senate after his term as governor but died of kidney disease only two years later.\n\nJames Whitcomb was born in Rochester, Vermont on December 1, 1795, the fourth of ten children of John W. and Lydia Parmenter Whitcomb. In 1806 his family moved to Cincinnati, Ohio where they farmed land. Whitcomb loved to read books, but his father would often discourage him from reading, believing that his son needed to take up manual labor to have a successful future. Instead, young Whitcomb taught school and attended Transylvania University in Kentucky, where he studied law and adopted many southern customs. After returning to the north, he became known for his \"fastidious dress and elegant manners\", and was often criticized during his life for being a fop. Whitcomb loved music, and was able to play many different instruments, but his favorite was the violin. He became well known for his talented playing and would often dance, sing, and play for friends throughout his life.\n\nAfter graduating in 1819 he moved to Fayette County, Kentucky, where he was admitted to the bar and, in March 1822, began to practice law. He moved to Bloomington, Indiana in 1824, where he continued to practice law. In Bloomington he quickly became respected in the community. Whitcomb was appointed as prosecuting attorney for Monroe County, Indiana by Governor James B. Ray and served from 1826 to 1829. His position earned him some fame in the area because of several high-profile cases that he successfully prosecuted.\n\nIn 1830, he was elected to serve as a member of the Indiana Senate. Other senators noted Whitcomb's addiction to tobacco, and that he was almost always smoking a cigar. In the Senate Whitcomb was the most outspoken of the anti-internal-improvement men. He was one of only nine men to speak against the Mammoth Internal Improvement Act in the Senate debate, his chief cohorts being Dennis Pennington, Calvin Fletcher and John Durmont. Despite their protests the bill was passed, and he voted for it after a meeting with his own constituents who asked him to \"go for it\".\n\nWhitcomb was appointed by President Andrew Jackson to serve as the Commissioner of the General Land Office in Washington, D.C. from 1836 until 1841. He probably secured the post with the help of Congressman Ratliff Boon. While in office he undertook the study of French and Spanish so that he was able to read the land treaties, and became fluent in both languages. His primary work was overseeing the survey of large tracts of land in Iowa and Wisconsin and dealing with land disputes in the recently purchased Florida Territory. Upon resigning from the Land Office in 1841, Whitcomb moved to Terre Haute, where he eventually launched his campaign as the Democratic gubernatorial candidate.\n\nIn 1843 he authored a pamphlet entitled \"Facts for the People\" in which he made a case against the federal government's adoption of protective tariffs. The pamphlet was popular and widely read in the state. That year he was nominated as the Democratic candidate for governor. The Whigs, who had been the primary backers of the internal improvements, had come under increasing criticism in the term of Samuel Bigger. The program had completely broken down in 1841 and most of the state's investment in the projects was lost. The state had negotiated a partial bankruptcy by the transfer of the project to the state's creditors, in exchange for a reduction in the state's outstanding debt. Despite this progress, the debt was still too large for the state to bear and the situation was still dire. Whitcomb campaigned on the issue and overcame the Whigs, who received most of the public blame for the debacle. Bigger, a Presbyterian, had made disparaging comments against Methodists during the campaign. Whitcomb, who was a Methodist, played up the statements and gained a great deal of support from the large Methodist community, as Bigger became the object of fiery sermons in their churches. Whitcomb won the election and defeated incumbent Governor Samuel Bigger in a close election, 60,784 votes to Bigger's 58,721 with 1,683 going to Elizur Demming, who was fielded by the newly formed anti-slavery Liberty Party. The victory was a swing of 10,000 votes from the last election.\n\nUpon his election, he found the government coffers empty, as the state had exhausted itself in an attempt to recover from overspending on internal improvements during the 1830s. During his term, the government began to recover from the losses of the internal improvements. The Bigger administration had overseen a large reduction in the state's debt, but the government was still unable to make headway on the nine-million dollar debt that still existed. During his first term, he advocated major spending cuts, including large cuts in government employee wages. Those cuts, along with steadily improving state revenues, enabled the government to manage its debt during his first term in office.\n\nWhitcomb advocated the creation of the Indiana School for the Deaf, and an asylum for the mentally insane. Both acts were passed, but funding was delayed until the state's financial crisis could be resolved. As his first term ended, he announced he would seek reelection. Touting the success of current measures to resolve the debt situation, Whitcomb won reelection with 64,104 votes to 60,138 to Whig Joseph G. Marshall, and 2,301 going to Liberty candidate Stephen Stevens.\n\nIn 1845 the state became insolvent again. Charles Butler, a representative of the state's debt-holders, arrived to negotiate a second bankruptcy. In exchange for partial ownership of the Wabash and Erie Canal, the only successful public works project, the debt-holders agreed to an additional reduction of the state's total debt to about $4 million, $3 million of which was from the internal improvement projects. The creditors agreed to refinance the debt, which enabled the state to lower the interest rates that it paid on its bonds. Although the debt still consumed nearly half of the government budget, it had reached a level which the growing state could accommodate. With the passage of the Butler Bill in 1847, the state's financial crisis was finally nearing its end.\n\nWhitcomb married his wife, the wealthy widow Martha Ann Renick Hurts, on March 24, 1846. The couple soon had a baby girl, on July 1, 1847. The pregnancy was difficult for his wife, and she died only sixteen days after giving birth. The death was very troubling to Whitcomb, who shut himself away for several days. His daughter grew up to marry a prominent Terre Haute lawyer, Claude Matthews, who was elected governor of Indiana in 1896.\n\nThe United States declared war on Mexico during Whitcomb's second term, and he was responsible for meeting the military quotas set forth for the state during the Mexican–American War. The state was ill-equipped for the war because of the ongoing financial troubles. The militia system had been abandoned once the threat of Indian raids had ceased, and the state arsenal was nearly devoid of weapons. The militia had come to be derided as the \"cornstalk militia\"; due to a lack of weapons and uniforms, they drilled with cornstalks as rifles and tassels in their caps.\n\nThe conflict had been unforeseen, and no money could be appropriated for the expense. With the state's credit in ruins, the prospect of borrowing money for such purposes from out-of-state lenders was unlikely. With the legislature out of session and the state's coffers empty, Whitcomb had no funds for the enterprise. On May 26, Whitcomb took a personal loan, on his own credit, for $10,000 from the Bank of Indiana's Madison branch, which he used to purchase arms for the state's regiments. The same day he sent letters to other branches of the bank requesting equivalent loans from them, which allowed the state to muster the five regiments that had been requested by the Federal Government. Once the General Assembly convened, they repaid what he had paid from his own pocket and assumed his outstanding debts to the bank. For his role as a war-time governor, a bronze statue of Whitcomb was placed in Monument Circle in Indianapolis.\n\nWhitcomb's most unpopular act as governor was his refusal to reappoint Indiana Supreme Court Justices Sullivan and Dewey. Whitcomb criticized them for allowing the docket to get backed up, and claimed that younger men were required to catch it back up. His refusal to act was one of the leading factors in the change to the method in which justices are appointed in the 1851 constitution. This was because the General Assembly was unhappy with his position, but it had no way of overriding it. In 1848, the Democrats took strong majorities in both houses of the Assembly. In his address to the legislature that year, he called for a constitutional convention to deal with several constitutional issues. In addition to the matter of appointing justices, another issue was the removal of the state's authorization to take loans, and there were other needed governmental reforms, as well.\n\nSpeaking of his profession, Whitcomb once said,\n\"Follow one line of thought and research with your whole mind and soul; take no active part in politics until maturity has brought you settled thought. The life of a politician is not always reputable; it has so many elements of deceit and dishonesty that it is hard to follow it and keep clean one's hands and soul.\"\nWhitcomb was a very active Mason. He became the first person to be knighted as a Masonic Knights Templar in Indiana, on May 20, 1848. He organized a Masonic lodge which for several years met in his home. He was always proud of his relationship with the Masons, and the Raper Commandery No. 1, Knights Templar, was established in his home where it met for several years before building a lodge.\n\nIn 1848, before his second term ended, Whitcomb was elected by the legislature to become a member of the United States Senate. He resigned as governor and served in the Senate from 1849 until his death in 1852, and was a staunch opponent of tariffs. While in Washington, D.C., he served several years as the Vice-President of the American Bible Society, remaining in that position until his death. He became afflicted by kidney stones and sought medical treatment in New York City for kidney disease. He died from the illness in New York City on October 4, 1852. His remains were returned to Indianapolis, to be buried in Greenlawn Cemetery, where the state erected a monument over his grave. In 1898 his daughter had his body exumed and moved to Crown Hill Cemetery next to the grave of Oliver P. Morton. In his will, Whitcomb left his large private library and part of his estate to the Methodist Asbury College (now known as DePauw University). He also left a large donation for the American Bible Association. His library is thought to be haunted by some of its patrons. There is a statue of Whitcomb on Monument Circle in Indianapolis.\n\nJames Whitcomb Riley's father was a close friend of Whitcomb and named his son after the governor. Whitcomb's pamphlet on tariffs became popular again after his death and was circulated nationally during the failed reelection campaign of Benjamin Harrison, who was a proponent of tariffs. Whitcomb was not the most popular of Indiana's politicians and gained many enemies during his time in office, but was well respected and remembered as one of Indiana's most important governors.\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

He served as Archbishop of Dubuque (1954–61) and as Archbishop of St. Paul and Minneapolis (1962–75). A native of Illinois, he became a priest in 1924 and a bishop in 1942.\n\nLeo Binz was born in Stockton, Illinois, the third child of Michael and Thecla (née Reible) Binz. The family lived on a small farm near the Mississippi River, east of Dubuque, Iowa. Following his confirmation, a young Binz declared to Bishop Peter Muldoon, \"I'm going to be a bishop!\" In 1914, he enrolled at Loras College in Dubuque, where he began his preparatory studies for the priesthood. He transferred to St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1918, and there earned a Bachelor of Arts degree (1919) and a Master of Arts degree (1920).\n\nFrom 1920 to 1921, Binz studied at the Sulpician Seminary in Washington, D.C. He was then sent to continue his studies at the Pontifical North American College in Rome. He earned a Doctor of Sacred Theology degree from the Propaganda University (1924) and a Doctor of Philosophy degree from the Pontifical Gregorian University (1926).\n\nOn March 15, 1924, Binz was ordained a priest for the Diocese of Rockford at the Basilica of St. John Lateran. From 1924 to 1926, while pursuing his doctoral studies, he taught at the North American College. He then returned to Illinois, where his first assignment was as a curate at St. Mary's Church in Sterling. He was appointed secretary to Bishop Edward Francis Hoban in 1928, and served as chancellor of the diocese from 1929 to 1932. He then served as a pastor in Cherry Valley, Rockford, and Belvidere.\n\nBinz was named a papal chamberlain in 1934, and raised to the rank of domestic prelate in 1939. From 1936 to 1942, he served as secretary to Archbishop Amleto Giovanni Cicognani, the Apostolic Delegate to the United States.\n\nOn November 21, 1942, Binz was appointed titular bishop of \"Pinara\" and coadjutor bishop of the Diocese of Winona, Minnesota, by Pope Pius XII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following December 21 from Archbishop Amleto Cicognani, with Bishops Henry Rohlman and Edward Hoban serving as co-consecrators, at St. James Pro-Cathedral in Rockford. As coadjutor bishop, he served as apostolic administrator of the diocese under Bishop Francis Martin Kelly, who was in poor health. He also established Immaculate Heart of Mary Seminary, centralized all the offices of the diocese, and started the plans for building the first cathedral in Winona.\n\nOn October 15, 1949, Binz was appointed Titular Archbishop of \"Silyum\" and Coadjutor Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Dubuque. Upon the resignation of Archbishop Henry Rohlman, Binz succeeded him as the sixth Archbishop of Dubuque on December 2, 1954.\n\nDuring his seven years as archbishop, he distinguished himself particularly in his commitment to Catholic education.

He also established the North American Martyrs Retreat House in Cedar Falls, and expanded Catholic Charities in the archdiocese.\n\nOn December 16, 1961 Pope John XXIII named Binz the seventh bishop and fifth archbishop of Saint Paul. He was installed on April 28, 1962.\n\nFrom 1962 to 1965 Binz attended all four sessions of the Second Vatican Council, and faithfully implemented the reforms promulgated by the council in the archdiocese. He was known for his pastoral approach to leadership. He promoted active lay participation and Christian renewal in the Church through fraternal societies. He strengthened Catholic Charities, and he continued the annual May Day rosary processions.\n\nBinz was named to the Pontifical Commission on Birth Control and was one of only seven members of the 72 member commission to vote that artificial birth control was intrinsically evil.\n\nOn July 11, 1966 the Holy See altered the name of the archdiocese to reflect the equal stature of the Twin Cities by naming the Basilica of Saint Mary in Minneapolis as co-cathedral of the archdiocese and adding Minneapolis to the title of the archdiocese. Subsequently, Binz was the first archbishop to hold the title of Archbishop of Saint Paul and Minneapolis.\n\nAs his health began to decline, Binz requested and received a coadjutor. Pope Paul VI named the Coadjutor Bishop of Wichita Leo Christopher Byrne coadjutor archbishop on July 31, 1967. Binz allowed Archbishop Byrne to take greater control of the administration of the archdiocese. Byrne, however, died on October 21, 1974.\n\nPope Paul VI accepted Archbishop Binz's resignation on May 25, 1975. He died four years later on October 9, 1979, in Maywood, Illinois. Archbishop Binz was buried with other archbishops of the archdiocese at Resurrection Cemetery in Mendota Heights, Minnesota.\n\n"}

It was a diameter, free-flying stainless steel disk.\n\nThe WSF was deployed using the Space Shuttle's robotic arm. The WSF then used nitrogen gas thrusters to position itself about behind the Space Shuttle which was at an orbital altitude of over , within the thermosphere, where the atmosphere is exceedingly tenuous. The WSF's orbital speed was at least three to four times faster than the speed of thermospheric gas molecules in the area which resulted in a cone behind the WSF that was entirely free of gas molecules. The WSF thus created an ultrahigh vacuum in its wake. The resulting vacuum was used to study epitaxial film growth. The WSF operated at a distance from the Space Shuttle to avoid contamination from the Shuttle's rocket thrusters plus water dumped overboard from the Shuttle's Waste Collection System. After two days, the Space Shuttle would rendezvous with the WSF and again use its robotic arm to collect the WSF and to store it in the Shuttle's payload bay for return to Earth.\n\nThe WSF was flown into space three times, aboard Shuttle flights STS-60, STS-69 and STS-80. During STS-60, some hardware issues were experienced, and, as a result, the WSF was only deployed at the end of the Shuttle's robotic arm. During the later missions, the WSF was deployed as a free-flying platform in the wake of the Shuttle.\n\nThese flights proved the vacuum wake concept, and realized the space epitaxy concept by growing the first-ever crystalline semiconductor thin films in the vacuum of space. These included gallium arsenide (\"GaAs\") and aluminum gallium arsenide (\"AlGaAs\") depositions. These experiments have been used to develop better photocells and thin films. Among the potential resulting applications are artificial retinas made from tiny ceramic detectors.\n\nPre-flight calculations suggested that the pressure on the wake side could be decreased by some 6 orders of magnitude over the ambient pressure in low Earth orbit (from to Torr). Analysis of the pressure and temperature data gathered from the two flights concluded that the decrease was some 2 orders of magnitude (4 orders of magnitude less than expected).\n\nThe WSF was sponsored by the Space Processing Division in NASA's Office of Life and Microgravity Sciences and Applications. It was designed, built and operated by the Space Vacuum Epitaxy Center (since renamed the Center for Advanced Materials) at the University of Houston—a NASA Commercial Space Center—in conjunction with its industrial partner, Space Industries, Inc., also in Houston.\n\n"}

The other is Tosk on which Standard Albanian is based. The geographic dividing line between the two varieties is the Shkumbin River, which winds its way through central Albania. Gheg is spoken in Northern Albania, Kosovo, northwestern North Macedonia, southeastern Montenegro and southern Serbia, by the Albanian dialectal subgroup known as Ghegs.\n\nGheg does not have any official status as a written language in any country. Publications in Kosovo and North Macedonia are in Standard Albanian, which is based on Tosk. However, some authors continue to write in Gheg.\n\nBefore World War II, there had been no official attempt to enforce a unified Albanian literary language; both literary Gheg and literary Tosk were used. The communist regime in Albania imposed nationwide a standard that was based on the variant of Tosk spoken in and around the city of Korçë. \n\nWith the warming of relations between Albania and Yugoslavia starting in the late 1960s, the Kosovo Albanians—the largest ethnic group in Kosovo—adopted the same standard in a process that began in 1968 and culminated with the appearance of the first unified Albanian orthographic handbook and dictionary in 1972. Although they had until then used Gheg and almost all Albanian writers in Yugoslavia were Ghegs, they chose to write in Tosk for political reasons.\n\nThe change of literary language has had significant political and cultural consequences because the Albanian language is the main criterion for Albanian self identity. The standardization has been criticized, notably by the writer Arshi Pipa, who claimed that the move had deprived Albanian of its richness at the expense of the Ghegs. He referred to literary Albanian as a \"monstrosity\" produced by the Tosk communist leadership, who had conquered anti-communist northern Albania and imposed own dialect on the Ghegs.\n\nIn post-WWII Yugoslavia there was a project to create a Kosovan language, which would have been largely Gheg. This was in line with Josip Broz Tito's reorganization of the country into a federation of ethnolinguistically defined nations, which relied heavily on language policy to create or reinforce separation of these nations from such neighbors as Bulgaria, and it built on efforts by communist Albania to unite with Yugoslavia. The idea of union was dropped though, in the aftermath of the split between Stalin and Tito in 1948, as Albania sided with Moscow. As a result of this rupture and other factors, no such Kosovan language was ever created. Indeed, in 1974 the Tosk-based standard Albanian was adopted as an official language of Kosovo..\n\nThe Gheg dialect is divided by four sub-dialects: Central Gheg, Southern Gheg, Northwestern Gheg (or Western Gheg), and Northeastern Gheg (or Eastern Gheg).\n\nSouthern Gheg is spoken in Albania (Durrës, Elbasan, Tiranë) and western North Macedonia.\n\nA subdialect is Central Gheg, spoken in Tiranë (sometimes included), Krujë, Burrel. The transnational Dibra region speaks Central Gheg dialects as well, and there is one particularly divergent dialect in Upper Reka, the Upper Reka Albanian dialect. Additional included regions include Lura, Tetova, Gostivari, Skopje and Kumanova\n\nThe dialect of parts of Mirdita is also sometimes classified as a subdialect of Southern Gheg.\n\nSouthern Gheg proper is said to include the prominent dialects of Durres, Elbasan and Tirana.\n\n\nThe Italian linguist Carlo Tagliavini puts the Gheg of Kosovo and North Macedonia in Eastern Gheg.\n\nNortheastern Gheg, sometimes known as Eastern Gheg, is a variant or sub-dialect of Gheg Albanian spoken in Northeastern Albania, Kosovo, and Serbia.\n\nThe Northeastern Gheg dialectal area begins roughly down from the eastern Montenegrin-Albanian border, including the Albanian districts (Second-level administrative country subdivisions) of Tropojë, Pukë, Has, Mirditë and Kukës; the whole of Kosovo, and the municipalities of Bujanovac and Preševo in Serbia. The tribes in Albania speaking the dialect include Nikaj-Merturi, Puka, Gashi, and Tropoja.\n\nThe Albanian speech in roughly around Tetovo and Skopska Crna Gora, in North Macedonia, is sometimes regarded part of Northeastern Gheg.\n\nCalques of Serbian origin are evident in the areas of syntax and morphology. The Northeastern Gheg slightly differs from Northwestern Gheg (spoken in Shkodër), as the pronunciation is deeper and more prolonged. Northeastern Gheg is considered to be the autonomous branch of Gheg Albanian in turn, the Northeastern Gheg dialects themselves differ greatly among themselves.\n\nThe dialect is also split in a few other minority dialects, where the phoneme [y] of standard Albanian is pronounced as [i], i.e. \"ylberi\" to \"ilberi\" (both meaning rainbow); \"dy\" to \"di\" (both meaning two). In Northeastern Gheg, the palatal stops of standard Albanian, such as [c] (as in qen\", \"dog\") and [ɟ] (as in gjumë\", \"sleep\"), are realised as palato-alveolar affricates, [t͡ʃ] and [d͡ʒ] respectively.\n\nNorthwestern Gheg, sometimes known as Western Gheg, is a sub-dialect of Gheg Albanian spoken in Northwestern Albania, Southern Montenegro, and Western Kosovo. The inhabitants of the renowned region of Malësia are Northwestern Gheg speakers. The tribes that speak this dialect are the Malësor, Dukagjin and other highlander tribes which include (Malësia): Hoti, Gruda, Triepshi, Kelmendi, Kastrati, Shkreli, Lohja, etc., (Dukagjin) : Shala, Shoshi, Shllaku, Dushmani, etc., etc..(Mirdita, Lezhë)...(\"see Tribes of Albania).\"\n\nThe main contrast between Northwestern Gheg and Northeastern Gheg is the slight difference in the tone and or pronunciation of the respective dialects. Northwestern Gheg does not have the more deeper sounding a's, e's, etc. and is considered by some to sound slightly more soft and clear in tone compared to Northeastern Gheg, yet still spoken with a rough Gheg undertone compared to the Southern Albanian dialects. Other differences include different vocabulary, and the use of words like \"\"kon\"\" (been), and \"\"qysh\"\" (how?) which are used in Northeastern Gheg, and not often used in Northwestern Gheg. Instead Northwestern Gheg speakers say \"\"kjen or ken\"\" (been), and use the adverb \"\"si\"\" to say (how?). For example in Northeastern Gheg to say \"when I was young\", you would say, \"\"kur jam kon i ri\"\", while in Northwestern Gheg you would say \"\"kur kam ken i ri\", \"kur jam ken i ri\".\".\n\nAlthough there is a degree of variance, Northwestern Gheg and Northeastern Gheg are still very much similar, and speakers of both sub-dialects have no problem understanding and having a conversation with one another.\n\nDifferentiations between the Northwestern Gheg dialects themselves are minuscule, unlike the Northeastern Gheg dialects where there is more differentiation.\n\nAssimilations are common in Gheg but are not part of the Albanian literary language, which is a standardized form of Tosk Albanian.\n\n\n\n"}

It was the main army cooperation plane in the Invasion of Poland. Its variant Lublin R-XIV was a military trainer aircraft.\n\nIn 1927, the Polish aviation authorities announced a contest for an army-cooperation plane (in Polish: \"samolot towarzyszący\", literally: \"accompanying plane\"). In Polish doctrine it was a close reconnaissance, observation and liaison aircraft, operating from casual airfields, providing big Army land units with information about the enemy. The PZL state factory proposed the PZL Ł-2, built in a series of 25 aircraft, while private factory Plage i Laśkiewicz in Lublin proposed the Lublin R-X, designed by Jerzy Rudlicki. It was flown on February 1, 1929. Five aircraft were built for the Air Force as R-Xa, and one was built as a long-distance sports plane. The third competitor was the PWS-5t2.\n\nThe contest was won by the R-Xa, having the shortest take-off and landing, and good performance, but the factory was ordered to develop design further. At that time, Rudlicki was working upon an unarmed trainer aircraft R-XIV and an observation aircraft R-XV. Both were new designs, basing upon the R-X construction. Number XIII was initially omitted in designations as \"unlucky\". In February 1930, the Polish Air Force ordered 15 of R-XIV. The first serial plane was built in June 1930, without an earlier prototype, and all were delivered by July 1931. The R-XIV was a two-seater, parasol wing aircraft, with a 220 hp radial engine and fixed landing gear. The crewman sat in open cabs in tandem. The R-XV was not ordered, but the Air Force demanded instead, that two R-XIV should be armed with an observer's machine gun, for testing. Thus armed, the R-XIV, fitted also with other minor modifications, most notably a changed shape of a tail fin, became the first prototype of the army-cooperation plane, that eventually received a designation Lublin R-XIII. One more prototype was newly-built (no. 56.1).\n\nOn July 21, 1931, 50 aircraft R-XIII were ordered. The first couple of aircraft were designated R-XIIIA, and were distinguished by flat fuselage top. They were superseded by improved R-XIIIB variant, with oval fuselage top, newer machine gun ring mounting, and longer ailerons. R-XIIIA were later converted to R-XIIIB standard, and 49 were made in total (numbers 56.2 to 56.50). The first serial R-XIII was built on June 7, 1932. By March 11, 1933, all were given to the Air Force. In older sources, numbers of 30 R-XIIIA and 20 R-XIIIB could be found.\n\nIn 1932, next 170 aircraft were ordered. 48 were built in R-XIIIC variant with minor modifications, then 95 were built in a most numerous R-XIIID variant. It introduced visible changes, like a Townend ring on a radial engine, and a new engine cowling. It also had new type of a machine gun ring mounting. The first R-XIIID was tested in February, 1933. All aircraft were given to the Air Force by March 2, 1935. During repairs, older models A, B and C were modified to R-XIIID standard as well.\n\nIn 1933, Jerzy Rudlicki proposed a new design R-XXI, for a new contest for R-XIII successor, but it was not accepted (the contest was won by the RWD-14 Czapla). However, some of R-XXI features, like higher and rounded in cross-section fuselage and changed shape of a tail fin, were found in latest R-XIII variants. Single prototype of the R-XIIIE was built in 1934, fitted with a stronger 360 hp engine Gnome-Rhone 7K Titan, but it was not produced. Another variant R-XIIIF introduced new, Polish-designed 340 hp engine Skoda G-1620A Mors-I. It had no Townend ring on cylinders of the radial engine. After one prototype (no. 56.101), a series of 50 R-XIIIF were ordered in 1934. After seven aircraft had been delivered, the Polish aviation authorities refused to buy nearly-completed further 18 aircraft, planning to nationalize all aviation industry in Poland. As a result, Plage i Laśkiewicz factory went bankrupt in late 1935, and it was next nationalized under a name LWS (\"Lubelska Wytwórnia Samolotów\" - Lublin Aircraft Works). Then, 18 R-XIIIF, bought by scrap price, were completed, and next series of 32 was built. All R-XIIIF were delivered to the Air Force by 1938. However, only 26 of them were completed with Mors engines (and mostly used for training or staff liaison), while 32 had standard 220 hp Wright engines, lowering their performance to R-XIIID level.\n\nIn 1931, one R-XIV was tested on floats, as a seaplane. Since tests came out well, the Polish Navy designated it R-XIII bis/hydro and ordered the next three (nos. 700-703). In 1933, the Navy ordered 10 R-XIII ter/hydro, which was a seaplane variant of R-XIIID (nos. 704-713). Finally, in 1934 the Navy bought 6 R-XIIIG seaplanes, differing in details from a previous variant - among others, a metal propeller (nos. 714-720). They were delivered by April 1935. All variants could also be easily converted to wheeled landing gear.\n\nIn 1933, one R-XIIIB was converted to a long-distance sport plane R-XIIIDr, named \"Błękitny Ptak\" (the \"Blue Bird\"), meant for a flight to Australia, however it was crashed in 1935 in Siam by Stanisław Karpiński. Several aircraft were converted to civilian sport ones, used in Polish Aero Clubs.\n\n12 R-XIII's were converted to blind flying trainers R-XIIIt in 1934, with higher closed trainee cab. Some were converted to simple liaison aircraft, removig armament and mounting a windscreen in the second cab. Several R-XIII were used to tow gliders, using a special frame with a hook, attached to a fuselage.\n\nThe R-XIII prototype was converted in 1932 to an experimental variant R-XIX, with V-tail of Rudlicki's design, but it was not accepted by the authorities, despite it had better field of machine gun fire.\n\nIn total, 15 R-XIV and 273 R-XIII were built, including 20 seaplanes.\n\nIn the early 1930s the R-XIII was quite a successful plane for its purpose. It had a very short take-off (68 m for R-XIIIA) and landing, enabling it to operate from fields and meadows. However, only some of R-XIIIs were equipped with a radio and a camera, which lowered their usefulness. In 1932-1936 they were used in three-aircraft liaison platoons, being a basic Polish army-cooperation plane. In 1937 they were formed into army-cooperation escadres (\"eskadra towarzysząca\"), in 1939 reformed into observation escadres (\"eskadra obserwacyjna\"). Only in 1939, part of R-XIII were replaced by the RWD-14b Czapla, which was not much more modern. A planned replacement was a modern LWS-3 Mewa, but it was not introduced due to war outbreak.\n\nOn the eve of the Invasion of Poland in 1939, the Polish Air Force had about 150 R-XIII. Of them, 49 were in combat units, 30 in reserve, about 30 in training units and about 40 in repairs. In combat units, R-XIII were used in 7 observation escadres (out of 12): numbers 16, 26, 36, 43, 46, 56 and 66. Each escadre had 7 aircraft. The 16th Escadre was in C-in-C reserve, while the others were distributed among the field Armies. The R-XIII was no match for any of the Luftwaffe fighters, bombers or even reconnaissance aircraft, being much slower, and armed with only one machine gun, but they were actively used for close reconnaissance and liaison tasks.\n\nAbout 40 R-XIII from combat units were destroyed during the campaign, but only part of those were shot down by the German aircraft or flak. During the campaign, 9 aircraft were given to observation escadres as replenishment. Some planes were also used in a wartime improvised units in air bases. About 10 combat aircraft and 7 from other units were withdrawn to Romania. A number of aircraft were bombed by the Germans in air bases or burned by withdrawing Poles. None have survived to today.\n\nIn the Naval Air Squadron, 11 R-XIIIter and R-XIIIG floatplanes were used in 1939. One of them made a night bombing raid on Danzig on September 7, searching in vain for . On September 8 all planes were bombed, while stationed on the sea near Hel on the Hel Peninsula.\n\n\nMixed construction (steel and wood) monoplane, conventional in layout, with braced high wings, canvas and plywood covered (front part of fuselage was metal covered).

In 2005, he was expelled from the Freedom Party for being a harsh critic of Jörg Haider and his faction, but was readmitted after Heinz-Christian Strache took over the party.\nAndreas Mölzer is married and has six children. He lives in Carinthia.\n\nMölzer is a leading figure of the pan-German wing of the Freedom Party. He defines himself as a \"cultural German\" and often publishes articles in the Junge Freiheit.\n\nIn the European Parliament, Mölzer is known for trying to create a network of right-wing-MEPs, including the French Front National, the Italian Fiamma Tricolore and others. The formation of the Identity, Tradition, Sovereignty group was an effect of his efforts. he was Deputy Leader of the group. He sat on its Committee on Constitutional Affairs, and was a substitute for the Committee on Culture and Education and a member of the Delegation to the EU-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee.\n\nIn April 2014, Mölzer pulled out of the European elections over controversy sparked by remarks he made at a party meeting.\n\nMölzer has been publishing in the Die Presse and the Kronen Zeitung, Austria's leading tabloid, since 1998. Since 1997, he is editor-in-chief of the right-wing-weekly Zur Zeit, which is seen as Austrian pendant to Germany's Junge Freiheit, for which Mölzer contributes an article on European Affairs every week. He has also been writing and editing several books on political or history topics.\n\nMölzer has published several lyrical and prosaical works. His lyrics (\"„Earth-brown tides / roll crowding / mightily through the country“\") is interpreted in a political context. However, it is said that the situation depicted in the poem could have been avoided. His novel \"„Der Graue“\" was criticized as it became subject of a public debate in 2014. This novel tells the tale of a survivor of a nuclear war who wanders and rapes through an apocalyptic landscape. The daily newspaper Kurier called the novel as \"\"crazed fantasy of violence\"\" and summarised its ending as follows: \"„From a folkish perspective, everything in the gray finds its happy ending: the aryan finds his female, saves the species - and is allowed to die.“\n\n\n"}

Since it was a Saturday, there was a short crew in the mine. Of the 77 men working that day, only three got out of the mine alive, and one of the rescue workers died soon afterward. The report from the United States Bureau of Mines states that 30 of the men were killed instantly by the explosion, and the remainder died either because of injuries sustained in the explosion, or because of suffocation from the carbon monoxide and methane gas in the mine. The explosion was deep underground, and was not heard at the mouth of the mine, despite having enough power to knock a 20-ton locomotive off its tracks 0.25 mile (0.4 km) from the blast origin.\n\nAll of the bodies were removed from the mine. There is a highway plaque near the mouth of the mine, which was never reopened, and there are memorials in the cemeteries in Bearcreek and nearby Red Lodge, the county seat for Carbon County.\n\nThe explosion was attributed to a build-up of methane gas in the mine. The cause of detonation is unknown, but various reports note that men were allowed to smoke in the mine, and that fuses for blasting were lit with matches.\n\nThe site of the disaster is included in the Smith Mine Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009.\n"}
{"id": "1802140", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1802140", "title": "Vila Viçosa", "text": "Vila Viçosa\n\nVila Viçosa () is a municipality in the District of Évora in Portugal. The population in 2011 was 8,319, in an area of 194.86 km².\n\nThe municipal holiday is August 16.\n\nAdministratively, the municipality is divided into 4 civil parishes (\"freguesias\"):\n\nThe area of Vila Viçosa has been inhabited since Antiquity, and it was the site of a small settlement in Roman times. The region was part of the Visigoth Kingdom and in the eighth century came under Moorish control after the Muslim conquest of Hispania. Moorish domination ended in 1217, when the region was reconquered by the Order of Aviz, a military order of knighthood that reclaimed large parts of Southern Portugal to the Christians. The order promoted the settlement of Christians in the area during the 13th century. In 1270, King Afonso III granted a \"foral\"(letter of feudal rights) to the incipient village of Vila Viçosa. In the early 14th century, King Dinis I built a castle in the village, to protect it from potential Castilian incursions.\n\nIn 1461, Vila Viçosa came to the hands of the House of Braganza, one of the most important houses of nobility of Portugal. This event was crucial in the history of the village, which became the main base of the Dukes of Braganza in the next centuries. The Dukes had considerable wealth and greatly promoted the economic, urban and artistic development of the village.\n\nIn 1502 the building of the Ducal Palace of Vila Viçosa was begun, sponsored by Jaime, fourth Duke of Braganza. Jaime was a skilled military leader who later led the Portuguese to victory against a Moorish army in the Battle of Azamor, in Morocco. The Ducal Palace was greatly remodelled between the 16th and 17th centuries in a sober late Renaissance (Mannerist) style, and was decorated through the centuries by several artists. The Dukes also sponsored artistic campaigns in several churches and monasteries in the village.\n\nWhen Duke John became King John IV, in 1640, the House of Braganza moved to the capital Lisbon, and many of the riches of the Ducal Palace were transferred to the Ribeira Palace. Vila Viçosa became a vacation spot for the members of the Braganza family. This marks the beginning of a period of decay for Vila Viçosa.\n\nIn the 20th century the industries of marble extraction and tourism became the main income sources of the municipality. Agricultural goods are also still important for its economy. Marble extraction and processing are responsible for around 93% of jobs in the municipality. Since the early 2000s,the displacement of material production outside Europe and the decreasing demand for natural stone have weakened local marble industries, starting an inexorable process of urban shrinking and depopulation.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1802156", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1802156", "title": "The Face of Evil", "text": "The Face of Evil\n\nThe Face of Evil is the fourth serial of the 14th season of the British science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\", which was first broadcast in four weekly parts on BBC1 from 1 to 22 January 1977. This serial marked the debut of Louise Jameson as companion Leela. It was also the first story written for the series by Chris Boucher and the first directed by Pennant Roberts, who would both go on to work on the series again a number of times.\n\nIn the serial, the powerful split-personality computer Xoanon (played by Tom Baker, Rob Edwards, Pamela Salem, Anthony Frieze, and Roy Herrick) attempts to create two super races from the descendants of a human expedition with eugenics—the savage Sevateem, and the psychic Tesh. The Fourth Doctor (Baker) seeks to repair this personality fault.\n\nThe serial is generally well-received by reviewers, although fandom consider it to be overshadowed by other stories in Season 14. It did however gain high ratings of over 11 million on first screening.\n\nThe Fourth Doctor, travelling alone in the TARDIS, arrives on a jungle planet and encounters Leela, a savage from the local tribe, who denounces him as the Evil One of fable among her people. She has been exiled from her tribe, the Sevateem, for profaning their god Xoanon who is kept prisoner by the Evil One and his followers, the Tesh, beyond a black wall. He speaks to them through the tribe's shaman, Neeva. The Doctor finds a sophisticated sonic disruptor, which creates the force field that keeps creatures from attacking the village. The Sevateem will launch an attack on the domain of the Tesh to free their god, led by the combative Andor who suspects Neeva of being a false prophet.\n\nIn Neeva's holy tent, the Doctor inspects the ancient tribal relics, artifacts from an Earth survey expedition. He finds a transceiver used by Neeva to hear the commands of Xoanon. It speaks with the Doctor's own voice, conveying exhilaration on hearing the Doctor that \"At least we are here. At last I shall be free of \"us\".\" The Doctor tells some of the tribe the Sevateem are the descendants of a “survey team” which left a Starfall Seven Earth colony ship.\n\nThe Doctor and Leela arrive at a clearing beyond where carved into a mountain nearby is an impression of the Doctor's face, who cannot recall why his face is depicted so. They notice a figure in a space suit in the “mouth” entrance and follow it through a projection of a wall. Beyond is a rocket, which the Doctor recalls as belonging to the Mordee Expedition, his memory of earlier events now returning. Xoanon has detected the Doctor nearby, and when he reaches the ship the god-creature is both ecstatic that \"We are here\" while also manically pledging that \"We must destroy us.\" The Doctor and Leela meet three representatives of the Tesh, who serve and worship Xoanon. The Doctor deduces both Sevateem and Tesh are descendants of the same crew from the Mordee Expedition, with the Tesh (or technicians) involved in the same deadly eugenics exercise as the Sevateem (or survey team). The invisible creatures that attacked the Sevateem are part of the same deranged scheme: Xoanon is a computer, designed to think independently. The Doctor had once repaired Xoanon but forgot to wipe his personality print from the data core, leaving the computer with a split personality. The Doctor, speaking as Xoanon with the communicator, instructs Neeva to tell Calib, who is now tribal leader, to lead the Sevateem survivors through the face in the mountain. With Leela keeping guard and holding the Tesh at bay, the Doctor ventures into the computer room of the ship to confront Xoanon. When Xoanon refuses to shut itself down, it channels a vicious mental assault at the Doctor, causing him to collapse, while Xoanon booms: \"Who am I?\"\n\nThe Tesh come under attack from Calib, Tomas and the survivors of the Sevateem, who now reach the spaceship too. This diverts the Tesh while the Doctor and Leela return to the computer room, where Xoanon briefly takes control of Leela's mind. Most of the Sevateem come under the telepathic control of the computer too. The Tesh and Sevateem soon converge on the computer room too and interrupt the Doctor as he tries to repair Xoanon, realising the computer has now triggered the countdown to an atomic explosion. Elsewhere in the ship Neeva is alone but crazed, his faith in Xoanon shattered. The shaman uses the disruptor gun against one of the images of Xoanon/the Doctor projected through a wall. The ensuing blast kills Neeva but also interrupts Xoanon's control of its subjects, allowing the Doctor to resume and complete his repairs. Xoanon's circuits explode, knocking the Doctor out.\n\nTwo days later the Doctor wakes up to find himself aboard the spaceship in the care of Leela. She explains Xoanon has been quiet and he interprets this as success for his extraction experiment. They visit the computer room and find Xoanon's identity and sanity restored. The computer confirms it was running a eugenics experiment and thanks the Doctor for his repair work. The Doctor then contacts the survivors of the Tesh and Sevateem and tells them Xoanon is now cured and able to support their new society. Leela then jumps aboard the TARDIS despite the protests of the Doctor, initiating take-off.\n\nIn early 1975 writer Chris Boucher submitted a storyline to the \"Doctor Who\" production office. Script editor Robert Holmes rejected the script as too short and unsuitable for the programme but was impressed by the imagination of the piece. He invited Boucher to work on another story, which was to be called \"The Prime Directive\", based on an idea by Holmes and producer Philip Hinchcliffe about the breakdown of a society controlled by a central computer. A few months later in October 1975, Boucher delivered the story, now titled \"The Mentor Conspiracy\". Over the next three months Boucher and Holmes worked on the script, retitling it \"The Tower of Imelo\". Hinchcliffe also had some input coming up with the idea that the Doctor had visited the planet before, but his visit had had a negative impact. The episodic scripts were then officially commissioned on 27 January 1976. As the script for the first episode arrived, the name had now changed to \"The Day God Went Mad\". Hinchcliffe disliked the title, not due to religious connotations but more because it was out of keeping with other titles. Boucher later agreed that it was \"pretentious\".\n\nWith the final script delivered in May 1976, production at Ealing Studios began on 20 September with the closing scene of episode one the first to be filmed. This included a model shot of a mountain side which had the Doctor's face carved into it in the style of Mount Rushmore, an idea from Hinchcliffe. The Ealing filming involved scenes set in the alien jungle, which was originally to be recorded in a real forest, but after the success of the previous season's \"Planet of Evil\", it was decided to create a jungle in the film studios. Another filmed sequence for episode one included a scene where the Doctor threatens one of the tribesmen with a knife. Lead actor Tom Baker refused to threaten someone with a weapon and instead substituted it for a jelly baby, much to Hinchcliffe's annoyance who wasn't present at the day's filming. Episode one also introduced the character of Leela, who wasn't intended to be a new companion, but a one-off character for whom the Doctor would interact. The idea was to introduce the new companion in the final story of the season (which later became \"The Talons of Weng-Chiang\") and feature two short-term \"companions\" in between. Abandoning this plan, the production team decided to make the feisty Leela the new companion instead, thus director Pennant Roberts set about auditioning 26 actresses for the role before finally settling on Louise Jameson. Jameson was surprised at the level of attention she received from the press and the subsequent male interest due to her wearing a skimpy leather costume (designed by John Bloomfield) in the series. The red contact lenses she wore (to turn her blue eyes brown) caused her great discomfort and she was unable to wear them for long periods.\n\nBy the time the story went into the television studios, the title of the serial had changed yet again to \"The Face of Evil\". The set designer for the serial was Austin Ruddy in his only \"Doctor Who\" outing. Hinchcliffe was impressed with the sets and considers him the best designer after Roger Murray-Leach. In episode three, several actors were employed to take on the voice of Xoanon, including Pamela Salem, who had also auditioned for the role of Leela and would then appear as a cast member in the following serial. Also among these voices was a young boy, Anthony Frieze who was a pupil at the school in which Pennant Roberts' wife worked. Recording for the four episodes at BBC Television Centre began in late September and continued until late October. The final work to be completed on the serial was dubbing in early December 1976.\n\nLloyd McGuire later played Generalleutnant Tendexter in the audio play \"The Architects of History\" (2012). David Garfield, who played Neeva, played the alien Von Weich who headed the German troops held in the First World War zone in \"The War Games\" (1969). Leslie Schofield also appeared in \"The War Games\", in the role of Leroy.\n\nThe story was repeated on BBC Four over the Christmas period 2015, with the four episodes shown over two nights, attracting viewing figures of 0.14m, 0.18m, 0.06m and 0.09m respectively.\n\nPaul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping wrote of the serial in \"The Discontinuity Guide\" (1995), \"A little masterpiece, often undeservedly forgotten by the weight of the surrounding stories. A magnificent cast shake every ounce of subtlety and invention from the script.\" In \"The Television Companion\" (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker praised the casting and use of the image of the Doctor's face, calling it \"unsettling\". While it was overall an \"impressive tale that manages to intrigue and delight\", they noted that the Tesh made \"little impression\" and the conclusion to the story was \"somewhat unlikely\". In 2010, Patrick Mulkern of \"Radio Times\" was more negative, calling the episodes \"stagnant at best and for the most part knuckle-gnawingly dull\", with shortcomings in every area of production. He felt that the two \"saving graces\" were the cliffhangers to the first and third episodes and Jameson as Leela. DVD Talk reviewer John Sinnott gave \"The Face of Evil\" four out of five stars, praising Baker, Leela, and the story's social commentary on religion. Dave Golder, writing for \"SFX\", noted its more adult tone and called it \"strong, compelling stuff\". In 2010, Charlie Jane Anders of io9 listed the cliffhanger to the first episode — in which Doctor's face is revealed to be that of the Evil One — as one of the greatest cliffhangers in the history of \"Doctor Who\".\n\nA novelisation of this serial, written by Terrance Dicks, was published by Target Books in January 1978. The novel explains (as the teleplay does not) that the Doctor's earlier intervention took place very shortly after his previous regeneration (the face on the mountain is clearly modeled after the Fourth Doctor.) At that time he was confused and disoriented, which explains both his mistakes and his forgetting having made them until forcibly reminded. \n\nThe story was released on VHS in May 1999 and on DVD on 5 March 2012.\n"}

After the announcement, the new pope is presented to the people and he gives his first \"Urbi et Orbi\" blessing.\n\nThe format for the announcement when a cardinal is elected pope is:\n\n<poem>\nAnnuntio vobis gaudium magnum;\nhabemus Papam:\n\nEminentissimum ac Reverendissimum Dominum,\nDominum [first name]\nSanctae Romanae Ecclesiae Cardinalem [surname]\nqui sibi nomen imposuit [papal name].\n</poem>\n\nIn English, it can be translated as:\n\n<poem>\nI announce to you a great joy;\nwe have a pope:\n\nThe most eminent and most reverend lord,\nLord [first name]\nCardinal of the Holy Roman Church [surname]\nwho has taken the name [papal name].\n</poem>\n\nIn the \"Habemus papam\" announcement given by Cardinal Jorge Arturo Medina Estévez on April 19, 2005, upon the election of Pope Benedict XVI, the announcement was preceded by an identical greeting in several languages, respectively, Italian, Spanish, French, German and English:\n\n<poem>\n\nDear brothers and sisters.\n</poem>\n\nThe text of the announcement is partly inspired by the Gospel of Luke (2:10–11), which records the words of the angel announcing to the shepherds the birth of the Messiah:\n\n\"Fear not; for, behold, I bring thee good tidings of great joy, that shall be to all the people: For unto thee is born, this day, in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.\"\n\nNote that, in the Vulgate (the Latin translation of the Bible by St. Jerome), the words used are \"\"Evangelizo vobis gaudium magnum\"\", while the word \"\"annuntio\"\" was used in previous translations.\n\nThe adoption of this formula is dated from the election of Odo Colonna as Pope Martin V (1417), who was chosen as the new pope by the cardinals and representatives from different countries at the Council of Constance. In this context, prior to Martin V, there were three claimants to the papal throne: Antipope John XXIII (who had called for the council, and appointed most of the cardinal electors), Antipope Benedict XIII (the only one to have been named cardinal before the outbreak of the Western Schism) and Pope Gregory XII. The first two were deposed by the Council itself, and Gregory XII abdicated after formally convoking the already convened council and authorizing its acts including the act of electing his successor. Two years after the first two contenders were deposed and the resignation of the third, the council elected the new pope. The announcement, therefore, could be interpreted as: \"(Finally) we have a pope (and only one!)\".\n\nThe adoption of the \"Habemus papam\" formula took place prior to 1484, the year in which it was used to announce the election of Giovanni Battista Cybo, who took the name of Innocent VIII.\n\nIn announcing the name of the newly elected pontiff, the new pontiff's birth first name is announced in Latin in the accusative case (e.g. \"Carolum\", \"Iosephum\", \"Georgium Marium\"), but the new pontiff's surname is announced in the undeclined form (e.g. \"Wojtyła\", \"Ratzinger\", \"Bergoglio\"). The new papal name has usually been given in the genitive case in Latin, corresponding to the translation \"who takes the name of ...\" (e.g. \"Ioannis vigesimi tertii\", \"Ioannis Pauli primi\"), although it can also be declined in the accusative case, corresponding to the translation \"who takes the name ...\", as was the case in 1963 and in 2013, when Pope Paul VI's and Pope Francis's regnal names were announced as \"Paulum sextum\" and \"Franciscum\", respectively. In the situation where the name is declined in the genitive, the name is considered as a complement of the noun \"\"nomen\"\" while in the instance where the name is declined in the accusative, it is considered as an apposition of the direct object complement \"nomen\" in the accusative. Both forms are equally correct. According to certain Latin grammarians though, like Nicola Fiocchini, Piera Guidotti Bacci and the \"Maiorum Lingua\" Manual, the accusative is the more correct form.\n\nDuring the announcement of Pope Paul VI's election, protodeacon Alfredo Ottaviani used the conjunction \"et\" (which also means \"and\") instead of \"ac\", the word usually used for \"and\" within the formula (he said \"Eminentissimum et reverendissimum\" instead of \"Eminentissimum ac reverendissimum\").\n\nDuring the announcement of Pope Benedict XVI's election, his regnal name was declined by Cardinal Medina in the genitive case (he said \"Benedicti decimi sexti\"), but in the Holy See website, the page announcing his election with a copy of the Habemus Papam formula has Benedict's regnal name declined in the accusative case (i.e., \"Benedictum XVI\")\n\nIf a papal name is used for the first time, the announcement may or may not use the numeral \"the first\". In John Paul I's election, the numeral \"primi\" (the first) was used (Cardinal Pericle Felici announced the papal name as \"Ioannis Pauli primi\") but in Pope Francis' election, no numeral was uttered (Cardinal Jean-Louis Tauran simply gave the papal name as \"Franciscum\").\n\nThe numeral in the papal name if it exists can be omitted if the new regnal name is the same as the one used by the immediate predecessor, as was the case in October 1978, when Pope John Paul II's regnal name was announced simply as \"Ioannis Pauli\" without the numeral, since his immediate predecessor was Pope John Paul I. It also happened in 1939, when Pope Pius XII's regnal name, following his election, was announced simply as \"Pium\" since his immediate predecessor was Pope Pius XI. In the announcement of Pope Pius XII's election, his regnal name was declined in the accusative, like the later announcements for Paul VI's and Francis's elections.\n\nThe following are examples of how the names were announced as noted on existing videos and recordings. The case and inclusion or exclusion of numeral for the papal names are noted.\n\nFrom the beginning, the \"Habemus papam\" did not follow a strict formula, but varied in considerable form for many years. The table shows selected announcements given since the 1484 papal conclave.\n"}

Ferguson played as a left-winger for the Montreal Canadiens from 1963 to 1971. After retiring from active play, he became a coach, and later a general manager. He is the father of John Ferguson Jr..\n\nFerguson was born in Vancouver, British Columbia on September 5, 1938. His father died when he was 9, and he was raised by his mother near the Pacific National Exhibition grounds. Ferguson loved horses and hung around Hastings Park as a child. Aside from his interest in horses and hockey, he also played lacrosse. Ferguson's hockey career began as a stickboy for the Vancouver Canucks, then of the Western Hockey League. He became interested in the role of enforcer when he saw the more talented Canucks players get hit repeatedly, without having their teammates attempt to respond or dissuade their opponents.\n\nFerguson played his junior hockey in Western Canada, with the Melville Millionaires of the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League in 1956–57, and 1958–59.\nIn 1959–60, he was playing professionally with the Fort Wayne Komets of the International Hockey League. In 1960, he moved to the American Hockey League and the Cleveland Barons.\n\nIn 1963–64, he was promoted to the Canadiens as an \"enforcer\" to protect captain Jean Beliveau from aggressive defenders—merely twelve seconds into his first NHL game, he was in a fight with Ted Green of the Boston Bruins; Ferguson won the fight. It was said that his unexpected retirement in 1971 caused problems for the Canadiens, who then started getting roughed up by other teams. Rumours persisted that General Manager Sam Pollock wanted to bring him out of retirement. \n\nFerguson was also a potential offensive threat. Playing on a line with Beliveau, Ferguson led all NHL rookies in scoring in his first season and finished as runner-up for Calder Trophy in 1963–64. The 5-foot-11, 190-pound left-winger also scored the Stanley Cup-winning goal in 1969, during a season that saw him score a career-high 29 goals with a plus-30 rating. In 85 post-season games, he scored 20 goals and added 18 assists. He also earned two selections to the NHL All-Star Game.\n\nDuring his playing career, he won the Stanley Cup five times: in the years 1965, 1966, 1968, 1969, and 1971, and always earned more than 100 penalty minutes in a regular season.\n\nFerguson was coach for the Sorel Titans, one of six semi-professional Quebec Lacrosse League clubs that played in the 1960s. In supporting the league, Ferguson told the Victoria Times Colonist newspaper: \"I hope both ends of the country can bring the game out of the bushes and bring back an interest. Lacrosse needs expansion.\"\n\nIn 1972, he became the assistant coach of Team Canada who defeated the Soviet team in the Summit Series. Ferguson gained some notoriety because he asked Bobby Clarke to take out Soviet star Valeri Kharlamov with a slash to the latter's ankle. Ferguson later justified his orders saying \"that guy is killing us.\"\n\nIn the years to follow, he became the head coach and later general manager of the New York Rangers. He lured Anders Hedberg and Ulf Nilsson away from the Winnipeg Jets of the World Hockey Association (WHA) in 1978 to the Rangers. Both were considered to be the Jets' best players, and among the best in the WHA as a whole. Ferguson stopped coaching in 1977, and was fired as general manager in 1978, at which time he became the general manager of the Jets in the WHA and, starting in 1979, the National Hockey League. \n\nHe worked for the Ottawa Senators in the early 1990s as director of player personnel. He is credited with finding Daniel Alfredsson for the Senators. He was a special consultant to the general manager of the San Jose Sharks.\n\nFerguson lived in Windsor, Ontario in his later years to be close to horses. He served as GM for the Windsor Raceway in 1988.\n\nIn September 2005, Ferguson was diagnosed with prostate cancer. He died on July 14, 2007. Ferguson was survived by his wife Joan and children John Jr. (former general manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs), Catherine, Chris and Joanne.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1802213", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1802213", "title": "State secrets privilege", "text": "State secrets privilege\n\nThe state secrets privilege is an evidentiary rule created by United States legal precedent. Application of the privilege results in exclusion of evidence from a legal case based solely on affidavits submitted by the government stating that court proceedings might disclose sensitive information which might endanger national security. \"United States v. Reynolds\", which involved military secrets, was the first case that saw formal recognition of the privilege.\n\nFollowing a claim of \"state secrets privilege\", the court rarely conducts an \"in camera\" examination of the evidence to evaluate whether there is sufficient cause to support the use of this doctrine. This results in court rulings in which even the judge has not verified the veracity of the assertion. The privileged material is completely removed from the litigation, and the court must determine how the unavailability of the privileged information affects the case.\n\nThe purpose of the state secrets privilege is to prevent courts from revealing state secrets in the course of civil litigation (in criminal cases, the Classified Information Procedures Act serves the same purpose). The government may intervene in any civil suit, including when it is not a party to the litigation, to ask the court to exclude state secrets evidence. While the courts may examine such evidence closely, in practice they generally defer to the Executive Branch. Once the court has agreed that evidence is subject to the state secrets privilege, it is excluded from the litigation. Often, as a practical matter, the plaintiff cannot continue the suit without the privileged information, and drops the case. Recently, courts have been more inclined to dismiss cases outright, if the subject matter of the case is a state secret.\n\nThe state secrets privilege is related to, but distinct from, several other legal doctrines: the principle of non-justiciability in certain cases involving state secrets (the so-called \"Totten Rule\"); certain prohibitions on the publication of classified information (as in \"New York Times Co. v. United States\", the Pentagon Papers case); and the use of classified information in criminal cases (governed by the Classified Information Procedures Act).\n\nThe doctrine was effectively imported from English common law which has the similar public-interest immunity. It is debatable whether the state secrets privilege is based upon the President's powers as commander-in-chief and leader of foreign policy (as suggested in \"United States v. Nixon\") or derived from the idea of separation of powers (as suggested in \"United States v. Reynolds\"). It seems that the US privilege \"has its initial roots in Aaron Burr's trial for treason\". In this case, it was alleged that a letter from General James Wilkinson to President Thomas Jefferson might contain state secrets and could therefore not be divulged without risk to national security.\n\nThe privilege was first officially recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States in \"United States v. Reynolds\", . A military airplane, a B-29 Superfortress bomber, crashed. The widows of three civilian crew members sought accident reports on the crash but were told that to release such details would threaten national security by revealing the bomber's top-secret mission. The court held that only the government can claim or waive the privilege, but that it “is not to be lightly invoked” and that there “must be a formal claim of privilege, lodged by the head of the\ndepartment which has control over the matter, after actual personal\nconsideration by that officer.” The court stressed that the decision to withhold evidence is to be made by the presiding judge and not the executive.\n\nIn 2000, the accident reports were declassified and released, and it was found that the assertion that they contained secret information was fraudulent. The reports did, however, contain information about the poor condition of the aircraft itself, which would have been very compromising to the Air Force's case. Many commentators have alleged government misuse of secrecy in this landmark case.\n\nDespite this ruling, a case might still be subject to judicial review since the privilege was intended to prevent certain, but not all, information to be precluded.\n\nAccording to former White House Counsel, John Dean:\nWhile precise numbers are hard to come by (because not all cases are reported), a recent study reports that the \"Bush administration has invoked the state secrets privilege in 23 cases since 2001.\" By way of comparison, \"between 1953 and 1976, the government invoked the privilege in only four cases.\"\n\nWhile Henry Lanman reports in \"Slate\":\nthe Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press reported that while the government asserted the privilege approximately 55 times in total between 1954 (the privilege was first recognized in 1953) and 2001, it's asserted it 23 times in the four years after Sept. 11.\"\n\nHowever, at least one article has retracted these figures, finding they were based on erroneous information:\n\nCorrection: In this article, we incorrectly reported that the government invoked the state secrets privilege in 23 cases since 2001. The figure came from the 2005 Secrecy Report Card published by OpenTheGovernment.org. The privilege was actually invoked seven times from 2001 to 2005, according to the corrected 2005 report card, which is not an increase from previous decades.\n\nLanman continues to cite two political science professors at the University of Texas-El Paso who concluded that\ncourts have examined the documents' underlying claims of state secrecy fewer than one-third of the times it has been invoked. And ... courts have only actually rejected the assertion of the privilege four times since 1953.\n\nFollowing the September 11, 2001 attacks, the privilege is increasingly used to dismiss entire court cases, instead of only withholding the sensitive information from a case. Also in 2001, George W. Bush issued Executive Order 13233 extending the accessibility of the state secrets privilege to also allow \"former\" presidents, their designated representatives, or representatives designated by their families, to invoke it to bar records from their tenure.\n\nAn article in the \"New York Times\" in August 2007, on a lawsuit involving Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication concluded that the unprecedented frequency with which the Bush administration invoked the principle has made judges more skeptical and willing to ask the government to validate its claims. In the words of Tom Blanton, director of the National Security Archive at George Washington University\nWhat seems clear is that until a year or two ago, the judges rarely even questioned it when the government raised the 'state secrets' claim. It was a neutron bomb – no plaintiffs left standing. But we're now seeing that judges are starting to actually look behind the government's secrecy claims and see what's really there.\n\nSince 2001, there has been mounting criticism of the state secrets privilege. Such criticism generally falls into four categories:\n\nMany commentators have expressed concern that the courts never effectively scrutinize executive claims of privilege. Lacking independent national security expertise, judges frequently defer to the judgment of the executive and never subject executive claims to meaningful scrutiny.\n\nCommentators have suggested that the state secrets privilege might be used as often to prevent disclosure of embarrassing facts as to protect legitimate secrets. Or, in the words of Professors William G. Weaver and Robert M. Pallitto in an article in the Political Science Quarterly:\n[T]he incentive on the part of administrators is to use the privilege to avoid embarrassment, handicap political enemies, and to prevent criminal investigation of administrative action.\n\nIn several prominent cases, the evidence that the government successfully excluded was later revealed to contain no state secrets: \"United States v. Reynolds\", \"Sterling v. Tenet\", \"Edmonds v. Department of Justice\", and the \"Pentagon Papers\".\n\nSome academics and practitioners have criticized the expansion of the state secrets privilege from an evidentiary privilege (designed to exclude certain pieces of evidence) to a justiciability doctrine (designed to exclude entire lawsuits). Under its original formulation, the state secrets privilege was meant only to exclude a very narrow class of evidence whose revelation would harm national security. However, in a large percentage of recent cases, courts have gone a step further, dismissing entire cases in which the government asserts the privilege, in essence converting an evidentiary rule into a justiciability rule. The government response has been that in certain cases, the subject of the case is itself privileged. In these cases, the government argues, there is no plausible way to respond to a complaint without revealing state secrets.\n\nGlenn Greenwald alleges that the Bush administration attempted to expand executive power, as evidenced by the unitary executive theory propagated by John Yoo. The theory suggests that the President, as Commander-in-Chief, cannot be bound by Congress or any law, national or international. By invoking the state secrets privilege in cases involving actions taken in the war on terror (i.e. extraordinary rendition, allegations of torture, allegedly violating the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act), Greenwald opines the administration tried to evade judicial review of these claims of exceptional war powers. In effect, this is preventing a judicial ruling determining whether there is a legal basis for such expansive executive power. With that in mind, applying this privilege makes impeachment the only possible means left for Congress to exercise their duty to uphold the checks and balances constitutionally intended to prevent abuse of power.\n\nIn recent years, a number of commentators have called for legislative reforms to the state secrets privilege. These reforms center around several ideas:\n\n\nOn January 22, 2008, Senators Edward Kennedy and Arlen Specter introduced , the State Secrets Protection Act.\n\nIn \"United States v. Reynolds\" (1953), the widows of three crew members of a B-29 Superfortress bomber that had crashed in 1948 sought accident reports on the crash, but were told the release of such details would threaten national security by revealing the nature of the bomber's top-secret mission. The Supreme Court ruled that the executive branch could bar evidence from the court if it deemed that its release would impair national security. In 1996, the accident reports in question were declassified and released, and when discovered in 2000 were found to contain no secret information. They did, however, contain information about the poor condition of the aircraft itself, which would have been very compromising to the Air Force's case. Many legal experts have alleged government abuse of secrecy in this landmark case.\n\nFormer DEA agent Richard Horn brought a suit against the CIA for bugging his home. The case was dismissed because of the privilege.\n\nRichard Horn's case was reinstated on July 20, 2009, by U.S. District Court Judge Royce C. Lamberth on the basis that the CIA had engaged in fraud on the court.\n\nOn March 30, 2010, as a result of a multimillion-dollar settlement agreement between Horn and the government, Lamberth dismissed the underlying case with prejudice. Subsequently, later that same year, in a September 22 order, Lamberth issued a final order vacating his earlier opinions and orders finding that CIA lawyers, Tenet, and Brown had committed fraud on the court. Lamberth also specifically ordered that a sentence be removed from his March 30, 2010 Memorandum. The removed sentence had stated that \"allegations of wrongdoing by the government attorneys in this case are not only credible, they are admitted\".\n\nIn February 2002, it was invoked in the case of Notra Trulock, who launched a defamation suit against Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee, charged with stealing nuclear secrets; President Bush stated that national security would be compromised if Trulock were allowed to seek damages from Lee; though it resulted in the case being dismissed, another suit was launched directly attacking then-FBI Director Louis Freeh for interfering and falsely invoking the state secrets privilege.\n\nThe privilege was invoked twice against Sibel Edmonds. The first invocation was to prevent her from testifying that the Federal Government had foreknowledge that Al-Qaeda intended to use airliners to attack the United States on September 11, 2001; the case was a $100 trillion action filed in 2002 by six hundred 9/11 victims' families against officials of the Saudi government and prominent Saudi citizens. The second invocation was in an attempt to derail her personal lawsuit regarding her dismissal from the FBI, where she had worked as a post-9/11 translator and had been a whistleblower.\n\nThe privilege was invoked in \"Thomas Burnett vs. Al Barka Investment & Development Corporation\" (Civil No. 04ms203) a motion to quash a subpoena for the testimony of Sibel Edmonds. The government's motion to quash based on state secrets privilege was granted in part.\n\nJeffrey Sterling was an African-American CIA agent who started a racial discrimination suit. It was thrown out on account of this privilege.\n\nThe privilege was invoked in \"Schwartz vs. TRW\" (Civil No. 96-3065, Central District, Cal) a Qui-Tam claim by Schwartz. Intervention and assertion of the state secrets privilege, by the government, resulted in case dismissal.\n\nThe privilege was invoked in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit case of \"Crater Corporation vs. Lucent Technologies Inc.\" and AT&T Company, (\"Crater Corp. v. Lucent Technologies\", September 7, 2005). Crater was prevented from proceeding with discovery in its patent infringement case (U.S. Patent No. 5,286,129) by the United States' assertion that discovery could cause \"extremely grave damage to national security\". The infringement case centered on wet-mate underwater fiber optic coupling devices beneath the sea.\n\nOn May 26, 2006, the U.S. Justice Department filed a motion to dismiss \"ACLU v. NSA\", the ACLU's lawsuit against the NSA by invoking the state secrets privilege. On July 26, 2006, the case was dismissed. In a different case in Michigan, brought by the ACLU against the NSA on behalf of various scholars, journalists, attorneys, and national non-profit organizations, Judge Anna Diggs Taylor ruled on August 17, 2006, that the program was unconstitutional and should be halted. She upheld the doctrine but ruled that the government's public statements concerning the operation were admissible and constituted sufficient proof for the case to continue without any privileged evidence or discovery. On July 6, 2007, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals threw out Taylor's decision, ruling 2-1 that the ACLU could not produce evidence to prove that the ACLU had been wrongfully wiretapped by the NSA and therefore did not have the standing to bring such a case to court, regardless of the legality question. On February 19, 2008, the Supreme Court declined to hear the ACLU's appeal.\n\nOn May 27, 2006, the Justice Department moved to preempt the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) challenge to warrantless domestic surveillance by invoking the state secrets privilege. The Bush Administration is arguing that CCR's case could reveal secrets regarding U.S. national security, and thus the presiding judge must dismiss it without reviewing the evidence.\n\nIn April 2006, the Bush administration took initial steps to use the state secrets rule to block a lawsuit against AT&T and the National Security Agency brought by the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The EFF alleged that the government has secret computer rooms conducting broad, illegal surveillance of American citizens. Testifying at a January 29, 2008, House Judiciary Committee hearing on reform of the state secrets privilege, EFF attorney Kevin Bankston contended that the administration's interpretation of the privilege was overly broad, and failed to properly consider the evidentiary procedures provided for by Section 1806(f) of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. However, the case was dismissed on June 3, 2009, citing retroactive legislation (section 802 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) stating that\nin the case of a covered civil action, the assistance alleged to have been provided by the electronic communication service provider was in connection with an intelligence activity involving communications that was authorized by the President during the period beginning on September 11, 2001, and ending on January 17, 2007; designed to detect or prevent a terrorist attack, or activities in preparation for a terrorist attack, against the United States; and the subject of a written request or directive, or a series of written requests or directives, from the Attorney General or the head of an element of the intelligence community (or the deputy of such person) to the electronic communication service provider indicating that the activity was authorized by the President; and determined to be lawful.\n\nIn May 2006, the illegal detention case of Khalid El-Masri was dismissed based on the privilege, which was invoked by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Khalid El-Masri alleged that he was falsely held by the CIA for several months (which the CIA acknowledges) and was beaten, drugged, and subjected to torture, degrading and inhuman while in United States captivity. He was ultimately released by the CIA with no charge ever being brought against him by the United States government. Judge T. S. Ellis III of the U.S. District Court dismissed the case because, according to the court, the simple fact of holding proceedings would jeopardize state secrets, as claimed by the CIA. On March 2, 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed. On October 9, 2007, the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of the Fourth Circuit's decision, letting the doctrine of state secrets privilege stand.\n\nThe privilege was invoked against a case where Maher Arar, a wrongfully-accused and tortured victim, sought to sue Attorney General John Ashcroft for his role in deporting Arar to Syria to face torture and extract false confessions. It was formally invoked by Deputy Attorney General James B. Comey in legal papers filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The invocation read, \"Litigating [the] plaintiff's complaint would necessitate disclosure of classified information\", which it later stated included disclosure of the basis for detaining him in the first place, the basis for refusing to deport him to Canada as he had requested, and the basis for sending him to Syria.\n\nOn January 4, 2007, District Court Judge Laura Taylor Swain ordered the dismissal of \"Jane Doe et al. v. CIA\", 05 Civ. 7939 based on the state secrets privilege. Jane Doe and her children sued the CIA for money damages after her husband's covert employment with the CIA was \"terminated immediately for unspecified reasons\".\n\nDetails about United Against Nuclear Iran are subject to US state secrets privilege, and according to the US government would do \" harm to national security if the information were disclosed.\"\n\nIn the 2011 General Dynamics case, the court unanimously held that \"when litigation would end up disclosing state secrets, courts may not try the claims and may not award relief to either party.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1802219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1802219", "title": "Escape to Victory", "text": "Escape to Victory\n\nEscape to Victory (stylized on the poster art and related marketing as Victory) is a 1981 American sports war film directed by John Huston and starring Sylvester Stallone, Michael Caine, Max von Sydow and Pelé. The film is about Allied prisoners of war who are interned in a German prison camp during the Second World War who play an exhibition match of football against a German team.\n\nThe film received great attention upon its theatrical release, as it also starred professional footballers Bobby Moore, Osvaldo Ardiles, Kazimierz Deyna, Paul Van Himst, Mike Summerbee, Hallvar Thoresen, Werner Roth and Pelé. Numerous Ipswich Town players were also in the film, including John Wark, Russell Osman, Laurie Sivell, Robin Turner and Kevin O'Callaghan. Further Ipswich Town players stood-in for actors in the football scenes – Kevin Beattie for Michael Caine, and Paul Cooper for Sylvester Stallone. Yabo Yablonsky wrote the script and the film was entered into the 12th Moscow International Film Festival.\n\nA team of Allied prisoners of war (POWs), coached and led by English Captain John Colby (Michael Caine), a professional footballer for West Ham United before the war, agree to play an exhibition match against a German team, only to find themselves involved in a German propaganda stunt.\n\nColby is the captain and essentially the manager of the team and thus chooses his squad of players. Another POW, Robert Hatch (Sylvester Stallone), an American who is serving with the Canadian Army, is not initially chosen, but eventually nags the reluctant Colby into letting him on the team as the team's trainer, as Hatch needs to be with the team to facilitate his upcoming escape attempt.\n\nColby's superior officers repeatedly try to convince Colby to use the match as an opportunity for an escape attempt, but Colby consistently refuses, fearing that such an attempt will only result in getting his players killed. Meanwhile, Hatch has been planning his unrelated escape attempt, and Colby's superiors agree to help him, if he in return agrees to journey to Paris, make contact with the French Resistance, and try to convince them to help the football team escape.\n\nHatch succeeds in escaping the prison camp, travelling to Paris, and finding the Resistance; at first, the Resistance decides that the plan to help the football team escape is too risky, but once they realise the game will be at the Colombes Stadium they plan the escape using a tunnel from the Paris sewer system to the showers in the players' changing room. They convince Hatch to let himself be recaptured, so he can pass information along back to the leading British officers at the prison camp.\n\nHatch is indeed recaptured, and is put in solitary confinement. Because of this, the prisoners do not know whether the intended escape has actually been planned with the underground, so Colby tells the Germans that he needs Hatch on the team because Hatch is the backup goalkeeper and the starting goalkeeper has broken his arm. Colby actually has to break the existing goalkeeper's arm because the Germans want proof of his injury before they will agree to let Hatch onto the team.\n\nIn the end, the POWs can leave the German camp only to play the match; they are to be imprisoned again following the match. The resistance's tunnellers break through to the showers in the dressing room at halftime, in an escape Hatch leads. But the rest of the team (led by Russell Osman saying \"but we can win this\") persuade him to continue the game, despite being behind 4–1 at halftime.\n\nDespite the match officials being heavily biased towards the Germans, and the German team causing several deliberate injuries to the Allied players, a draw is achieved after great performances from Luis Fernandez (portrayed by Pelé), Carlos Rey (portrayed by Osvaldo Ardiles) and Terry Brady (portrayed by Bobby Moore). Hatch plays goalkeeper, and makes excellent saves including one last save from a penalty kick as time expires to deny the Germans the win, drawing the game 4–4. An Allied goal had been blatantly disallowed earlier in the match, so the POW team should have won 5–4.\n\nThe POWs do manage to escape at the end of the game following the original plan, amid the confusion caused by the crowd storming the field (shouting \"\"victoire\"\") after Hatch preserved the draw.\n\n\nThe film is based on the 1962 Hungarian film drama \"Két félidő a pokolban\" (\"Two half-times in Hell\"), which was directed by Zoltán Fábri and won the critics' award at the 1962 Boston Cinema Festival.\n\nThe film was inspired by the now discredited story of the so-called Death Match in which FC Dynamo Kyiv defeated German soldiers while Ukraine was occupied by German troops in World War II. According to myth, as a result of their victory, the Ukrainians were all shot. The true story is considerably more complex, as the team played a series of matches against German teams, emerging victorious in all of them, before any of them were sent to prison camps by the Gestapo. Four players were documented as being killed by the Germans but long after the dates of the matches they had won.\n\n\"Escape to Victory\" featured a great many professional footballers as both the POW team and the German team. Many of the footballers came from the Ipswich Town squad, who were at the time one of the most successful teams in Europe. Despite not appearing on screen, English World Cup-winning goalkeeper Gordon Banks and Alan Thatcher was closely involved in the film, working with Sylvester Stallone on his goalkeeping scenes. \"Sports Illustrated\" magazine said \"the game is marvelously photographed by Gerry Fisher, under second unit director Robert Riger.\"\n\nSince the movie is set in the early years of the German occupation of France (probably 1941 or 1942), Pelé's character, Corporal Luis Fernandez, is identified as being from Trinidad, not Brazil. The Brazilians did not join the war against the Axis powers until 1943, with the Brazilian Expeditionary Force arriving in Italy in 1944. Similarly, Argentinian star Osvaldo Ardiles' character, Carlos Rey, isn't identified as being from any particular country (as Argentina was mostly neutral during the war), though it is generally thought that Rey was from either Mexico or Costa Rica.\n\nNearly all of the film's music score borrows heavily from the first and last movements of Dmitri Shostakovich's \"Leningrad Symphony,\" particularly the march theme of the first movement, which is almost quoted verbatim, a practice which the composer Bill Conti would later employ in \"The Right Stuff\" with Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto. Shostakovich's Symphony No. 7 has always been associated with secondary meanings within the music aimed at the Stalinist regime's overwhelming repression of individualism and freedom of expression, but at the time of its composition during the war was said to represent the oppression of Nazism. At the end of the film, the last part of Shostakovich's Symphony No. 5 is also used to signify the triumphant conclusion of the story. However, while the music may fulfil the final moments of \"Escape to Victory's\" exultant ending explicitly, it is believed Shostakovich wrote the ending to his symphony to imply forced rejoicing under an authoritarian force. More prosaically, the music also pays tribute to Elmer Bernstein’s score for The Great Escape.\n\nIn 2005, the Prometheus Records label issued a limited edition soundtrack album of Conti's score.\n\nThe film holds a 67% \"fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes. On Metacritic, the film is rated 57 out of 100 based on 10 critic reviews.\n\nIn March 2019, it was announced that Jaume Collet-Serra will direct a remake also titled \"Victory\".\n\n"}

His father had agreed in January 1541, as one of the terms of his submission to Henry VIII of England, to send young Gerald to be educated in England. At the accession of Edward VI proposals to this effect were renewed; Gerald was to be the companion of the young king. \n\nThese projects were not carried out. Claims were made on the Desmond estate by the Butlers, the hereditary enemies of the Geraldines. The FitzGeralds and the Butlers were at perpetual war. James Butler, 9th Earl of Ormonde had married Lady Joan Fitzgerald, daughter and heiress-general of James FitzGerald, 10th Earl of Desmond. On Ormonde's death she proposed to marry Gerald FitzGerald, and eventually did so after the death of her second husband, Sir Francis Bryan. The effect of this marriage was a temporary cessation of hostility between the Desmonds and her son, Thomas Butler, 10th Earl of Ormonde. In 1560 her intervention secured a peaceful outcome to a stand-off at Bohermore (known as, \"the battle that never was\").\nGerald succeeded to the earldom in 1558; he was knighted by the lord deputy Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex, and offered homage at Waterford. He soon established close relations with his namesake Gerald FitzGerald, 11th Earl of Kildare (1525–1585), and with Shane O'Neill. In spite of an award made by Sussex in August 1560 regulating the matters in dispute between Ormond and the Fitzgeralds, outlaws from each side continued to plunder the other. For some time, Desmond resisted a summons to appear at Elizabeth's court with the plea that he was at war with his uncle Maurice. When he did appear in London in May 1562, his (according to the English) insolent conduct before the privy council resulted in a short imprisonment in the Tower of London.\n\nDesmond was detained in England until 1564, and soon after his return his wife died. He shortly thereafter remarried to the 20-year-old Eleanor Butler, daughter of the Baron Dunboyne, and then raided Thomond, and in Waterford he sought to enforce his feudal rights on Sir Maurice Fitzgerald of Decies, who invoked the help of Thomas Butler (Gerald's former step-son by his 1st wife and 1st cousin to his new wife), the 10th Earl of Ormonde. This slid into war, which came to an end at the Battle of Affane on the Blackwater river. Here Ormonde's brother, Sir Edmund Butler of Cloughgrenan, hit Desmond in the right hip with a pistol-shot, cracking his thigh-bone and throwing him from his horse. About 300 Geraldines were killed, with many drowning as they were intercepted by armed boats in crossing the river.\n\nAs the badly wounded captive Desmond was being carried shoulder-high from the field, an Ormonde commander rode up and jubilantly inquired, \"Where is now the great Lord Desmond?\" Desmond retorted, \n\nOrmonde took the wounded Desmond in captivity to Clonmel and then to Waterford city, where Lord Justice Nicholas Arnold took custody of him after a legal wrangle with Ormonde.\n\nOrmond and Desmond were bound over in London to keep the peace, being allowed to return to Ireland early in 1566, where a royal commission was appointed to settle the matters in dispute between them. Desmond and his brother Sir John of Desmond were sent over to England, where they surrendered their lands to the queen after imprisonment in the Tower. In the meanwhile Desmond's cousin, James FitzMaurice FitzGerald, caused himself to be acclaimed captain of Desmond in defiance of Henry Sidney, and in the evident expectation of usurping the earldom. He sought to give the movement an ultra-Catholic character, with the idea of gaining foreign assistance, and allied himself with John Burke, son of the Earl of Clanricarde, with Connor O'Brien, 3rd Earl of Thomond, and even secured Ormonde's brother, Sir Edmund Butler, whom Sidney had offended. Edward Butler also joined the rebellion, but the appearance of Sidney and Ormonde in the south-west was rapidly followed by the submission of the Butlers. Most of the Geraldines were subjugated by Humphrey Gilbert, but Fitzmaurice remained in arms, and in 1571 Sir John Perrot undertook to reduce him. Perrot hunted him down, and at last on 23 February 1573 he made formal submission at Kilmallock, lying prostrate on the floor of the church by way of proving his sincerity.\n\nDesmond was allowed to return to Ireland in 1573, despite the protestation of Elizabeth's counsellors. He promised not to exercise palatinate jurisdiction in Kerry until his rights to it were proven. He was detained for six months in Dublin, but in November slipped away. Edward FitzGerald, brother of the Earl of Kildare, and lieutenant of the queen's pensioners in London, was sent to remonstrate with Desmond, but accomplished nothing. \n\nDesmond asserted that none but Brehon law should be observed between Geraldines. Fitzmaurice seized Captain George Bourchier (father of Henry), one of Elizabeth's officers in the west. Essex met the Earl near Waterford in July, and Bourchier was surrendered, but Desmond refused the other demands made in the Queen's name. A document offering £500 for his head, and £1,000 to any one who would take him alive, was drawn up but was vetoed by two members of the council.\n\nOn 18 July 1574 the Geraldine chiefs signed a 'Combination' promising to support the Earl unconditionally; shortly afterwards Ormonde and the lord deputy, William Fitzwilliam, marched on Munster, and put Desmond's garrison at Derrinlaur Castle to the sword. Desmond submitted at Cork on 2 September, handing over his estates to trustees: Sir Henry Sidney visited Munster in 1575, and affairs seemed to promise an early restoration of order. But Fitzmaurice had fled to Brittany in company with other leading Geraldines, John Fitzedmund Fitzgerald, seneschal of Imokilly, who had held Ballymartyr against Sidney in 1567, and Edmund Fitzgibbon, the son of the White Knight who had been attainted in 1571. He intrigued at the French and Spanish courts for a foreign invasion of Ireland, and at Rome met the adventurer Thomas Stucley, with whom he projected an expedition which was to make a nephew of Pope Gregory XIII king of Ireland. In 1579 Fitzmaurice landed at Smerwick bay (\"Cuan Ard na Caithne\"), where he was joined later by some Spanish soldiers at the Dún an Óir. His ships were captured on 29 July 1579 and he himself was slain in a skirmish while on his way to Tipperary.\n\nNicholas Sanders, the papal legate who had accompanied Fitzmaurice, sought to draw Desmond into rebellion. On 1 November 1579 Sir William Pelham proclaimed Desmond a traitor. The sack of Youghal and Kinsale by the Geraldines was speedily followed by attacks by Ormonde and Pelham acting in concert with Admiral William Winter. \n\nIn June 1581 Desmond took to the woods, but he maintained a considerable following for some time. By June 1583, when Ormonde offered a price for his head, he was fleeing with only four followers. Five months later, on 11 November 1583, he was murdered by Moriarty of Castledrum, at Glenagenty, five miles east of Tralee at Bóthar an Iarla. The Moriarty Chieftain was given a substantial reward by Queen Elizabeth.\n\nDesmond's brother, Sir John of Desmond had been killed in December 1581, and the seneschal of Imokilly had surrendered on 14 June 1583. This seneschal's lands excited envy; he was arrested in 1587, and died in Dublin Castle two days later.\n\nBy his second marriage to Eleanor Butler, daughter of the 1st Baron Dunboyne the 15th Earl left two sons, the elder of whom, James FitzGerald, (1570–1601), spent most of his life in prison. After an unsuccessful attempt in 1600–1601 to recover his inheritance he returned to England, where he died, the title becoming extinct.\n\nThe 15th Earl had at least four daughters:\n\n"}

{"id": "1802251", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1802251", "title": "Bill King", "text": "Bill King\n\nWilbur \"Bill\" King (October 6, 1927 – October 18, 2005) was an American sports announcer. In 2016, the National Baseball Hall of Fame named King recipient of the 2017 Ford C. Frick Award, the highest honor for American baseball broadcasters.\n\nKing was the radio voice of the Oakland Athletics baseball team for 25 years (1981–2005), the longest tenure of any A's announcer since the team's games were first broadcast in Philadelphia in 1938, as well as the longtime radio play-by-play announcer for the Oakland/Los Angeles Raiders football team and the San Francisco/Golden State Warriors basketball team. Earlier in his career, he had been a member of the San Francisco Giants' original broadcasting team (together with Russ Hodges and Lon Simmons) when the Giants moved west from New York in 1958, and had called University of California football and basketball games.\n\nKing was widely recognized by his distinctive handlebar moustache and Van Dyke beard, as well as his broadcasting catchphrase, \"Holy Toledo!\"\n\nKing was born in Bloomington, Illinois and was stationed on the island of Guam at the end of World War II when he began his broadcasting career with the Armed Forces Radio Network, converting play-by-play accounts of games as they came in over the wire and broadcasting them in a manner that made it sound as if he were actually at the game. After the war, he began his professional sportscasting career in Pekin, Illinois, broadcasting high school football and basketball games as well as minor league baseball games. He later announced basketball games for Bradley University and basketball and football games for the University of Nebraska. King moved to the Bay Area in , when the San Francisco Giants hired him as an announcer.\n\nA major turning point in King's career came in 1962, when the Philadelphia Warriors of the National Basketball Association moved to San Francisco and hired him as their play-by-play announcer. King announced Warrior games from 1962 to 1983, through the Wilt Chamberlain, Nate Thurmond, and Rick Barry eras and the team's first NBA Championship on the West Coast, in 1974–1975.\n\nFranklin Mieuli, the owner of the Warriors upon their transfer to the Bay Area, had worked with King on Giants baseball on KSFO and the Golden West Radio Network, serving as executive producer for the broadcasts.\n\nKing was not shy about disagreeing with the referee's calls during the course of his play-by-play work, and was a notorious ref-baiter. In his most infamous incident, he used an expletive on the air to describe a referee's call, and the Warriors were charged with a technical foul. He may be the only professional sports announcer ever charged with an infraction during the course of play.\n\nIn 1966, while continuing to call Warrior games, King was hired as the play-by-play announcer for the Oakland Raiders, then of the American Football League, a post he held until after the 1992 season. For a time, he commuted to Los Angeles when the Raiders relocated to Southern California from 1982–1994. He announced the Raiders' three Super Bowl victories, as well as countless other memorable games.\n\nPerhaps King's most famous call came during the Raiders' infamous Holy Roller game against the San Diego Chargers on September 10, 1978. In the final seconds of the game, Raider quarterback Ken Stabler tossed the ball forward, and tight end Dave Casper grabbed it in the end zone for a disputed, game-winning touchdown. King's description:\nAnother famous call came on November 8, 1970, when George Blanda came off the bench in the fourth quarter against the Cleveland Browns, threw for a tying touchdown with less than 2 minutes left, and kicked the winning field goal as time ran out. King reacted by declaring \"George Blanda has just been elected King of the World!\"\n\nThough carrying a substantial workload as the announcer for two professional sports teams, King was persuaded by the new owners of the Oakland Athletics to become their lead announcer in . King continued to call Raider and Warrior games, though he retired as the Warriors' announcer after 1983 and was fired by the Raider owner Al Davis after the 1992 season. For the first 15 years as A's announcer, King was paired with another legendary Bay Area sports announcer, Lon Simmons, with whom King had worked briefly with the Giants in . He was there during the \"Billyball\" and \"Bash Brothers\" eras, as well as the Moneyball era of the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nFormer Athletics announcer Greg Papa, who worked alongside King for 13 years, says of King: \n\nKing was often described as a Renaissance man who was a voracious reader, loved to watch the ballet and opera in his spare time, and studied Russian history. He lived in Sausalito, California, and would often go on long sailing trips in the baseball off-season on his ketch, Varuna.\n\nKing's trademark phrase was \"Holy Toledo\", which he used when a stupendous event occurred for the team he was announcing for. Other well known calls are \"Not in your wildest alcoholic nightmare would you ever imagine such events unfolding!\" which he said during an Oakland Athletics game against the Texas Rangers and \"Crazy...just plain crazy!\" which he voiced when Scott Hatteberg hit his walk-off home run against the Kansas City Royals to push the Athletics’ historic win streak to twenty games. He also referred a grinning John Madden as a \"slit watermelon\" as a complement when Raiders won the Super Bowl in 1977 with Madden as a coach. \n\nKing died of a pulmonary embolus in San Leandro, California, on October 18, 2005 at the age of 78. Although King had long refused to reveal his age, a search of the Social Security Death Index revealed he had been born on October 6, 1927 a year also confirmed by his son, Michael.\n\nOn November 1, 2005, in conjunction with the Oakland A's, Golden State Warriors, and Oakland Raiders, a private ceremony celebrating the life of Bill King was attended by family, friends, and the media at The Arena in Oakland. There were performances by the Smuin Ballet and tributes from Bill's former broadcast partners. Hank Greenwald, who worked with King during his Warriors tenure, was the master of ceremonies.\n\nThe most memorable tributes were from Greenwald, Ken Korach, and Raider owner Al Davis. In his speech, Korach mentioned that King had three rules in his broadcasts. He hated it when an announcer mentioned a \"grand slam home run\", because saying \"home run\" was redundant; he disliked the usage \"early on\", believing that the word \"on\" was unnecessary and grammatically incorrect; and he never liked to be thanked by his broadcast partner when he \"tossed\" to him for his innings. Korach said, \"sorry partner, but thanks for everything.\"\n\nAl Davis gave arguably the most commanding and entertaining eulogy. When he first met him at Raider training camp in 1966, Davis didn't know what to make of the small-statured King with his handlebar mustache and beard, who was sitting shirtless on a blanket and holding a yellow pad making notes of what the players were doing on the field. \"You've got to be kidding me!\" Davis said. \"What could this little fella possibly know about football?\" Noting that it's a rare day when all three Oakland teams are represented in one room, Davis said, \"To think it was Bill King who brought us together. Bill King never played for the Oakland Raiders, nor did he play for the Los Angeles Raiders. Nor did he wear the famed colors of silver and black. If he had worn them, he would have worn them with poise and with pride and with class, because he was a star.\" Davis added that King gets a cloak of immortality, because time never stops for the great ones. He said it was his dream to have a sold-out stadium seating 1 to 2 million Raider fans, all listening to the voice of Bill King.\n\nBruce MacGowan of radio station KNBR also gave a moving speech about how he met King through Lon Simmons and even worked as a Raider statistician in the early 1970s. He once asked King for a ride home and noted how beat-up King's car was. On the drive to Marin County, MacGowan noticed that there was a draft, even though the windows were rolled up. To his dismay, he discovered there was a hole in the floorboard by his feet. MacGowan asked how long King had been driving his car. King replied, \"I just got it a week ago. No sense in paying more than $250 for a car.\"\n\nIn the 2006 Oakland A's season, the A's players on their home white jerseys bore a patch depicting an old-style radio microphone with a yellow sunburst around the microphone and the words \"HOLY TOLEDO\" across the center which was King's signature call on a home run, and at the base of the microphone was the name KING. A sign was placed above the radio booth with the same logo, and was unveiled Opening Night by colleagues Ray Fosse and Ken Korach. Subsequently, the radio booth at the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum is the \"Bill King Radio Booth\". On Opening Night, a video tribute was played on the Diamond Vision screen, and in lieu of the ceremonial first pitch, Bill King's chair, a baseball, and his headset were on the pitcher's mound.\n\nDuring the 2017 season at the Coliseum, a sign was installed in the centerfield wall just to the right of the 400 foot marker depicting the worlds \"Holy Toledo\" in a script font. The sign's lighting effects are controlled by a large button in the home radio booth. When Ken Korach deems a great Oakland A's play Bill King worthy, he presses the button, and the sign flashes. It can also be used for other occasions during the course of the game, as controlled by the A's production crew.\n\nBesides the tributes, there was a Bill King \"uncensored\" segment which really opened up some eyes as the audience heard King's off-air banter with his broadcasters, which included some rather colorful language. The best segment was the actual audio call of the \"Mother's Day\" incident from the Warriors' game at Seattle on December 6, 1968. King was outraged by (ostensibly) poor officiating from official Ed T. Rush in his rookie season. After several calls had gone against the Warriors, King took off his headset, turned off his microphone, cupped his hands and yelled a certain expletive at Rush. Unbeknownst to King, the crowd mic was on and Bill's insult went over the airwaves. The Warriors were assessed a technical foul and owner Franklin Mieuli later had to pay a fine to the Federal Communications Commission for the incident.\n\nKing is one of only two people ever awarded both a World Series ring and a Super Bowl ring. The other was Bob Sheppard, the long-time stadium voice of the New York Football Giants and New York Yankees, and another man famously secretive about his age.\n\nAs noted in the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", \"King was believed to be 78. The lack of knowledge of his exact age was one of the many quirks that made King one of the great characters in Bay Area sports.\"\n\nOn December 7, 2016, he was named the 2017 recipient of the Ford C. Frick Award by the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\nIn September 2013, Wellstone Books released Ken Korach's \"Holy Toledo – Lessons from Bill King: Renaissance Man of the Mic.\" \"San Francisco Chronicle\" columnist Bruce Jenkins wrote that the book \"beautifully captured\" King; Lowell Cohn, of the \"Santa Rosa Press-Democrat\", said it was \"soon to be a legend among sports books\"; and Bay Area News Group columnist Carl Steward called \"Holy Toledo\" a \"fabulous, engaging read.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "1802265", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1802265", "title": "Paavo Väyrynen", "text": "Paavo Väyrynen\n\nPaavo Matti Väyrynen (born 2 September 1946) is a Finnish politician and a member of the Finnish Parliament, representing the Seven Star Movement and formerly the Citizen's Party and Centre Party. Väyrynen has been a member of the Finnish Parliament previously from 1970 to 1995 and again from 2007 to 2011 and has held many ministerial portfolios. He has also been a Member of the European Parliament from 1995 to 2007, and again from 2014 to 2018.\n\nVäyrynen has been the Centre Party candidate for Finnish president three times – finishing second in 1988, third in 1994 and third in 2012. In 2018 he ran as an independent candidate finishing fourth.\n\nPaavo Väyrynen was born in a farmer family in Keminmaa, southwest Lapland. After finishing his gymnasium he graduated in 1970 as a Bachelor of Social Sciences in the University of Helsinki. In Väyrynen's doctoral thesis in 1988, \"Finlands utrikespolitik – den nationella doktrinen och framtidens mänsklighetspolitik\" (\"Foreign politics of Finland - the national doctrine and the politics of the future of mankind\"), he made an assumption that the Soviet Union would prevail — an assumption which has ever since haunted him in the media. In 1996, Väyrynen was granted docentship of International Relations in University of Lapland.\n\nVäyrynen skyrocketed to the top of Finnish politics in his early years. He was elected to the Finnish Parliament in 1970 elections. He was immediately chosen to work as a Secretary of Ahti Karjalainen's cabinet. The 25-year-old Väyrynen was elected as the Vice Chairman of the Finnish Centre Party in 1972 and only three years later he began his long ministerial career as the Minister of Education.\n\nThe new rising star managed to attain the popularity of President Kekkonen. He soon became one of Kekkonen's trustees and a fierce defender of his foreign policies.\n\nPaavo Väyrynen became one of the most influential Finnish politicians in 1980 when he was elected as the Chairman of Finnish Centre Party. The Väyrynen victory in 1980 party congress was remarkable also because his main opponent was a well known ex-Prime Minister of Finland Johannes Virolainen. The vote was tight, 1737 delegates of the Party Congress voted for Väyrynen and 1611 delegates supported Virolainen. President Kekkonen's support in the background was of decisive importance in Väyrynen's victory.\n\nThe \"Jalasmökki scandal\" 1982 shadowed Väyrynen's career later in media. It occurred when only a few square metres' mobile cabin was found in the address in Keminmaa where Väyrynen officially resided. Väyrynen lived at the same time in Helsinki and used the cabin to get extra compensation from public funds. Later the system of expense compansations for the members of the Parliament of Finland was made more favourable for MPs from distant electoral districts.\n\nJust a year before 1983 Finnish parliamentary election the Centre Party merged with the Liberals, but this did not help the party prevent the rise of the populist Finnish Rural Party. Nevertheless, the Centre Party formed a government with the Social Democratic Party of Finland and Väyrynen became the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs.\n\nAfter 1982 Finnish presidential election and the 1983 parliament election the Social Democrats had secured a hegemony in Finnish politics holding both the President and Prime Minister chairs. To destroy the hegemony Väyrynen made a secret agreement with the opposition forces (conservative National Coalition Party, the Christian League and Liberals) and Swedish People's Party of Finland before 1987 Finnish parliamentary election to form a new Centre-Right government after the elections if the coalition would gain a majority. But, at the same time the National Coalition party had played with two cards and made a similar agreement with the Social Democrats. Even though the Social Democrats lost a bit of their support in the elections, they remained the biggest party and formed a new government with the National Coalition Party. Väyrynen was now the main opposition figure in Finnish politics.\n\nIn 1988 Finnish presidential election Väyrynen was an obvious choice to be the presidential candidate of the main opposition party. On the first round he got 20.6% of the votes and challenged the incumbent President Koivisto. Nevertheless, the National Coalition candidate supported Koivisto, who was elected to his second term.\n\nAfter the presidential elections Väyrynen's Centre Party was successful in Finnish municipality elections and gained 21.1% of the votes.\n\nIn 1990 Väyrynen decided to resign after being the party chairman for 10 years. Esko Aho was elected as a successor of Väyrynen. He led the Centre Party into a historic victory with 24.83% of the votes. Väyrynen got more votes than any other candidate in the whole country and was chosen - for the fourth time during his political career - as the Minister for Foreign Affairs.\n\nPaavo Väyrynen was critical to the active support given by the Danish Uffe Ellemann-Jensen and the Icelandic Jon Baldvin Hannibalsson to the Baltic states in their fight to regain independence. In 1992, however, Paavo Väyrynen together with 9 other Ministers of Foreign Affairs from the Baltic Sea area, and an EU commissioner founded the Council of the Baltic Sea States (CBSS) and the EuroFaculty, as Finland actively supported.\n\nLater former Estonian prime minister Edgar Savisaar criticised that Väyrynen as a minister of Foreign Affairs with the Social Democrat president Mauno Koivisto and conservative party leader Harri Holkeri were more of a hindrance than a help in Estonia's independence process.\n\nDuring his ministry Finland submitted its application for EU membership. Nevertheless, the negotiations with the EU were a disappointment to Väyrynen. When the result of the negotiation was ready, Väyrynen declared that he would oppose Finnish EU membership.\n\nWith the new chairman of the party supporting EU membership Väyrynen decided to resign as a Minister. He challenged the new political line of the party by announcing his candidacy to 1994 presidential election. He beat his main opponents Keijo Korhonen and Eeva Kuuskoski in the Centre Party primary. After Väyrynen's victory both Kuuskoski and Korhonen decided to run as independent candidates in the elections.\n\nVäyrynen finished third in the election and did not make it to the second round. He was highly disappointed with the result especially when the results of early voting were announced. The opinion polls released by the media just before the presidential elections' first round had shown low support for Väyrynen, although actually he was the second most popular candidate in early voting. On the official election day Väyrynen received a lot less support and he claimed that the media had manipulated the opinion polls to convince voters to believe that Väyrynen had no chance to advance to the second round. According to Väyrynen there was a \"media game\" against him. Later the phrase (\"media game\", \"mediapeli\" in Finnish) became a popular slogan in Finnish politics.\n\nAfter the presidential elections Finland also held a referendum of the EU membership late 1994. The Centre Party was split in the issue by the party leaders supporting the membership and Väyrynen campaigning fiercely against it. The Party Congress decided to support the membership and Väyrynen became a prominent opposition figure inside his own party.\n\nWhen Finland joined the European Union in 1995 the Finnish Parliament elected Väyrynen to the European Parliament. In the European Parliament election 1996 Väyrynen was the candidate with the most votes - 157,668 - in the entire Finland. In the European Parliament Väyrynen worked as the Vice Chairman of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe group. As an MEP Väyrynen defended the European Union based on supranational principles and opposed the ideas of federal Europe.\n\nIn the European Parliament election 1999 Väyrynen was again the vote-puller of his party but this time with \"only\" 60,000 votes. In the European Parliament election 2004 Väyrynen was elected third time in row.\n\nDuring his career in the European Parliament Väyrynen tried to get a comeback to the Finnish politics several times. His first unsuccessful attempt was in September 1999 when Väyrynen lost the primary election for President against Esko Aho.\n\nThe second attempt in 2002 ended in a painful defeat. Väyrynen was a candidate for the Centre Party chairmanship but received only 100 votes out of a few thousand delegates in the party congress. He had not lost only the support of the party leadership but also the support of ordinary Centre Party members.\n\nNevertheless, the ordinary voters had not forgotten Väyrynen. He participated in Finnish parliamentary election in 2003 and promised not to return to the European Parliament. In 2004 Väyrynen, tired of the lack of support by the Finnish political elite, was re-elected to the European Parliament.\n\nIn 2007 Väyrynen finally returned to the Finnish Parliament. In the election he was elected from Lapland to the Parliament but refused to receive the parliamentary seat without a minister's portfolio. As a surprise Matti Vanhanen, the new Prime Minister, offered him a position as the Minister of Foreign Trade and Development. As a minister Väyrynen found himself often in opposition to other members of the cabinet.\n\nAs a minister, he said that Finland should not have joined the eurozone. In 2008, he labeled the Russia–Georgia War as a \"Georgian attack\" on \"Russian peacekeepers\" and ended his article with the statement that Finland should not discuss NATO membership because \"it could create the impression that Finland is moving from cooperation to confrontation\".\n\nIn 2010 he run, once again, to the chairmanship of the Centre Party. The veteran politician suffered a heavy loss once again finishing only fourth in the vote. Väyrynen again blamed a \"media game\" for his loss.\n\nMany Finns believed that Väyrynen's career was over when he lost his seat as a member of Finnish parliament in 2011 election. Väyrynen had changed from his stronghold electoral district of Lapland to the Uusimaa electoral district. Later he accused Timo Laaninen, the secretary general of the Centre Party for luring him to change the electoral district.\n\nSoon after his loss in the 2011 parliamentary election, Väyrynen announced his willingness to participate in the upcoming presidential election. Väyrynen appeared to be the only one believing in his chances of winning the primary for the Centre Party. Nevertheless, the party suffering from a heavy loss in 2011 parliament election, saw no one else interested in to run in the election, and as a result Väyrynen was again a presidential candidate. In the summer of 2011, the European sovereign debt crisis got worse and Väyrynen's predictions from 1990s looked surprisingly real.\n\nVäyrynen had been polling third or second in opinion polls for the election after Sauli Niinistö. He was also accusing other candidates of hiding their positive attitude of possible Finnish membership in NATO. He has also suggested that Finland ought to readopt the Finnish markka alongside the euro. Väyrynen was eliminated from the second round of the election (5 February), placing third on the first round (22 January) behind the Green League's Pekka Haavisto by a close margin of 1.3 percentage points (37,000 votes).\n\nSoon after the presidential election, Väyrynen announced his candidacy for the chairman's position in the party congress of the summer 2012. He was eliminated from the second round of the election, placing third on the first round behind Juha Sipilä and Tuomo Puumala.\n\nIn 2014 European Parliament election Väyrynen was elected again to the European Parliament with 69,360 votes. He also participated the Finnish parliamentary election in 2015, and was elected with 6,889 votes. After the election, Väyrynen announced that he would continue his work in the European Parliament, but would return to the Finnish Parliament, if he is given a cabinet position.\n\nIn July 2015, Väyrynen launched a citizens' initiative to organize a referendum on whether Finland should remain in the euro zone. Väyrynen argued that the decision to join euro was a mistake.\n\nIn January 2016, Väyrynen announced that he will leave all board positions in the Centre Party. He stated that he was no longer able to affect the decision making within the party and criticized Sipilä cabinet for its liberal politics. Soon after, Väyrynen announced that he was founding a new party called Citizens' Party (Kansalaispuolue) and would represent it for rest of his term in the European Parliament. The party managed to gather enough signatures from supporters and was qualified as a registered party in December 2016. In 2017 Keminmaa Centre party's branch announced that Väyrynen has resigned from the party as he has founded new political party\n\nVäyrynen ran for the City Council of Helsinki during the 2017 municipal elections as an independent on the party list of the Christian Democrats. He gained 1,026 votes and was elected.\n\nOn 15 July 2017, Väyrynen announced that he is planning to run as an independent candidate in the 2018 presidential election, if he manages to gather the needed 20,000 signatures from his supporters in time. At the same time Väyrynen announced, that he had left the chairmanship of the Citizens' Party. On 5 December, Väyrynen announced that he had gathered the needed signatures and his candidacy was soon confirmed by the Ministry of Justice.\n\nIn the election, Väyrynen placed fourth with 6.2 percent of the votes, while Niinistö went on to secure his second term with a majority of votes. After the results were announced, Väyrynen commented that he was \"extremely glad\" for the results and said that he would take the seat in the Finnish Parliament, that he had put on hold after the 2015 election, during following spring. On 1 February 2018, Väyrynen announced that he would challenge the incumbent chairman of the Centre Party Juha Sipilä in the next party convention in June, and that he would return to Parliament after the convention.\n\nOn 3 March 2018, Citizens' Party expelled Väyrynen from the party, due to his alleged misdeeds with the campaign funding during the presidential elections and determination to seek the chairmanship of the Center Party. Väyrynen denied the allegations and instead started a court case against the activities of the board of the Citizens' Party. In April 2018, he left the party willingly to concentrate on the chairmanship election of the Center Party. On 25 April 2018, Väyrynen however announced that he would step back from the chairmanship election and subsequently left the Center Party.\n\nOn 12 June 2018, Väyrynen left the European Parliament in order to take the MP's seat that he had gained in the 2015 parliamentary elections. He went on to found a new parliamentary group for the Citizens' Party, although his status within the party was still unclear due to the ongoing court case. On 28 June 2018, Väyrynen announced that due to the disagreements with the Citizens' Party, he had founded a new political movement called Seven Star Movement. Later, Väyrynen formally changed the affiliation of his parliamentary group from Citizens' Party to the Seven Star Movement.\n\nVäyrynen took part in the 2019 parliamentary election as a candidate of the Seven Star Movement, but was not elected. Weeks after the election, Väyrynen announced that he would leave the Seven Star Movement. He still took part in the 2019 European Parliament election as a candidate of the party, but was not elected.\n\nIn February 2020, Väyrynen rejoined the Centre Party. He has announced his willingness to seek chairman's position, if his nomination gains enough support.\n\nAs an MEP Väyrynen organised Europe education for young people and adults. Later these lectures formed a base for a folk high school Pohjantähti in Lapland. Väyrynen bought with his wife an old retirement home in Keminmaa and renovated it into a school. Nevertheless, the Finnish Ministry of Education did not financially support the project of the ex-Minister of Education.\n\nVäyrynen has opened on the same area also Pohjanranta farm, which hosts a youth home, a dance hall, a vineyard, a hostel and a church.\n\n\n"}

He was the first person charged with illegally accessing a computer system, but was acquitted because there was no such specific criminal offence at the time. Later in life he became a computer security consultant, speaking at many conferences on information security and training banks, large companies and universities in the UK on IT security. In 2014 he began developing the software on which SecuritySmart runs from scratch which reached completion and product launch in June 2016.\n\nThe idea of SecuritySmart.co.uk came to Robert after speaking to many CISOs at conferences and repeatedly hearing that the biggest problem with traditional methods of IT security training was that they lacked any tangible way of measuring success. SecuritySmart is a micro-learning platform which sends an email a week to trainees on one security-related topic, ending in a multiple choice question to test trainee understanding. Managers have access to a dashboard that contains analytics related to trainee response to the training emails, including when they were opened, how long they took to answer the question and how regularly they got the answers right.\n\nHe was arrested in 1985 for hacking into a British Telecom computer and accessing the Telecom Gold emails of Prince Philip. As there was no specific law against hacking at this time, in June 1985 he became (together with his co-defendant, Steve Gold) one of the first two people to be charged under section 1 of the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981 with forgery which deceived a non-human target. When the case came to trial in April 1986, Schifreen was said to have used an unprotected top level account identified as \"2222222222\" with a password of \"1234\"; Schifreen was said to have admitted obtaining user passwords but denied doing so for personal gain and said that his activities prompted Prestel to increase security. On 24 April 1986 Schifreen was convicted on six counts of forgery and fined £750.\n\nSchifreen's appeal to the Court of Appeal was heard by three judges including the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Lane; judgment was given on 21 July 1987, and found that the use of a charge of forgery was inappropriate and that an application that the charges should be dismissed as giving no case to answer should succeed. The judgment expressed the hope that \"the Procrustean attempt to force the facts into the language of an Act not designed to fit them\" would not be repeated.\n\nThe Crown then appealed to the House of Lords (\"R v Gold and Schifreen\" [HL 21 Apr 1988]), but the appeal was turned down in April 1988. The Law Lords agreed that the \"making of a false instrument\", a key part of proving a forgery case, revolved around the production of a \"memory segment\" with false information; as the computer had created this rather than Schifreen himself, the computer had effectively \"forged itself\". This case led to introduction of the Computer Misuse Act 1990.\n\nAfter his acquittal, Schifreen had to take a judicial review action against the police for the return of his computers. For some years, Schifreen was the editor of \".EXE Magazine\", a magazine for programmers. 'hex', his online name (shortened from the punning 'hex maniac'), was an active CIXen from the late 1980s, at a time when online communities were still a rare novelty.\n\nSchifreen now lives in East Sussex working as an IT security trainer and web developer at the University of Brighton and runs an IT security consultancy. He regularly speaks at conferences and writes articles for the computer press and other publications. In 2006, John Wiley & Sons published his book, \"Defeating the Hacker\".\n\n"}

Along with his collaborator D. B. Weiss, he is best-known as co-creator, showrunner, and writer of \"Game of Thrones\" (2011–2019), the HBO adaptation of George R. R. Martin's series of books \"A Song of Ice and Fire\". He is also known for writing \"Troy\" (2004) and co-writing \"\" (2009).\n\nBenioff was born David Friedman in New York City, to a Jewish family who emigrated from Austria, Romania, Germany, Poland and Russia. He is the son of Barbara (Benioff) and Stephen Friedman, who is a former head of Goldman Sachs. He is a distant cousin of Salesforce founder Marc Benioff. As an adult, he uses the last name Benioff, his mother's maiden name, to avoid confusion with other writers named David Friedman. He is the youngest of three children; his sisters are Suzy and Caroline. and grew up in Manhattan, first in Peter Cooper Village, then on 86th Street where he spent most of his childhood, before eventually moving near the U.N. headquarters when he was 16.\n\nBenioff is an alumnus of The Collegiate School and of Dartmouth College. While at Dartmouth he was a member of Phi Delta Alpha Fraternity and the Sphinx Senior Society. After graduating in 1992, he worked in a number of jobs: for a time as a club bouncer in San Francisco, and as a high school English teacher at Poly Prep in Brooklyn, New York City for two years, where he served as the school's wrestling coach.\n\nBenioff became interested in pursuing an academic career and went to Trinity College Dublin in 1995, for a one-year program to study Irish literature. While in Dublin he met D. B. Weiss, who would later become his collaborator. Benioff wrote a thesis on Samuel Beckett while at Trinity College, but decided against a career in academia after writing the thesis. He worked as a radio DJ in Moose, Wyoming for a year—mostly as a side job, which he mainly accepted to take a year in the countryside at a writer's retreat. He then applied to join the Creative Writing Program at the University of California, Irvine after reading \"The Mysteries of Pittsburgh\" by Michael Chabon (an alumnus there), and received a Master of Fine Arts degree in creative writing there in 1999.\n\nIn 2001, \"People\" magazine included Benioff on its list of America's Top 50 Most Eligible Bachelors.\n\nBenioff spent two years writing his first published novel \"The 25th Hour\", originally titled \"Fireman Down\", and completed the book as his thesis for his master's degree at Irvine. He was asked to adapt the book into a screenplay after Tobey Maguire read a preliminary trade copy and became interested in making a film of the book. The film adaptation, titled \"25th Hour\" and starring Edward Norton, was directed by Spike Lee. Benioff then wrote a collection of short stories titled \"When the Nines Roll Over (And Other Stories)\" (2004).\n\nHe drafted a screenplay of the mythological epic \"Troy\" (2004), for which Warner Bros. pictures paid him $2.5 million. He also wrote the script for the psychological thriller \"Stay\" (2005), which was directed by Marc Forster, and stars Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts. His screenplay for \"The Kite Runner\" (2007), adapted from the novel of the same name, marked his second collaboration with director Marc Forster.\n\nBenioff was hired in 2004 to write the screenplay for the \"X-Men\" spin-off \"\" (2009). He based his script on Barry Windsor-Smith's \"Weapon X\" story, Chris Claremont and Frank Miller's 1982 limited series on the character, as well as the 2001 limited series \"Origin\". Hugh Jackman collaborated on the script, which he wanted to be more of a character piece compared with the previous \"X-Men\" films. Skip Woods was later hired by Fox to revise and rewrite Benioff's script. Benioff had aimed for a \"darker and a bit more brutal\" story, writing it with an R rating in mind, although he acknowledged the film's final tone would rest with the producers and director.\n\nIn 2006, Benioff became interested in adapting George R.R. Martin's novel series, \"A Song of Ice and Fire\", and began working with D. B. Weiss on a proposed television series, \"Game of Thrones\". The pilot, \"Winter Is Coming\", was put into development by HBO in 2007 and the series greenlit in 2010. Benioff and Weiss acted as the executive producers, showrunners, and writers of the show, which began airing on HBO in 2011. Benioff and Weiss had previously worked together on a script for a horror film titled \"The Headmaster\", but it was never made.\n\nIn October 2007, Universal Pictures hired Benioff to write an adapted screenplay of the Charles R. Cross biography of Kurt Cobain, but the screenplay was not used. In 2008, Benioff's second novel, \"City of Thieves\", was published.\n\nOn April 10, 2014, Benioff announced he and Weiss had taken on their first feature film project to write, produce, and direct \"Dirty White Boys\", a novel by the Pulitzer prize-winning author Stephen Hunter. On July 19, 2017, Benioff announced that he and Weiss would produce another HBO series, titled \"Confederate\", after the final season of \"Game of Thrones\". Benioff and Weiss said, \"We have discussed \"Confederate\" for years, originally as a concept for a feature film, but our experience on \"Thrones\" has convinced us that no one provides a bigger, better storytelling canvas than HBO.\" The announcement of \"Confederate\" was met with public animosity, and as of August 2019 (when Benioff and Weiss' deal with Netflix deal was announced) would not be moving forward.\n\nOn February 6, 2018, Disney announced that both Benioff and Weiss would write and produce a new series of \"Star Wars\" films after the final season of \"Game of Thrones\" is completed in 2019.\n\nTowards the end of the final season of \"Game of Thrones\", a petition to HBO was started on Change.org. It described showrunners Benioff and Weiss as \"woefully incompetent writers\", and thus demanded \"competent writers\" to remake the eighth season of \"Game of Thrones\" in a manner \"that makes sense\". The petition eventually amassed over 1.5 million signatures. Richard Roeper, writing for the \"Chicago Sun Times\", described that the backlash to the eighth season was so great that in his 25+ years of reviewing movies and television, he doubts that he has \"ever seen the level of fan (and to a lesser degree, critical) vitriol leveled at\" \"Game of Thrones\".\n\nIn early August 2019, Benioff and Weiss negotiated an exclusive multi-year film and television deal with Netflix worth US$200 million. Due to their commitments to Netflix, Benioff and Weiss exited their contract to produce \"Star Wars\" films for Disney and Lucasfilm.\n\nBenioff and Weiss together directed two episodes of \"Game of Thrones\", but used a coin-flip to decide who would get the credit on the show. Benioff was given the credit for season 3 episode 3, \"Walk of Punishment\", while Weiss was credited with season 4 episode 1, \"Two Swords\". Benioff and Weiss co-directed the series finale.\n\nBenioff and Weiss's first project on Netflix were as directors of the stand-up comedy special \"Leslie Jones: Time Machine\".\n\nOn September 30, 2006, Benioff married actress Amanda Peet in New York City. Together they have three children. The family lives in Manhattan and Beverly Hills.\n\n\n"}

It is part of the Region of Central Macedonia. Its capital is the city of Serres. The total population reaches just over 175,000.\n\nThe mountains are Orvelos to the north, Menoikio to the east, Pangaio to the southeast, Kerdylio to the southwest, Vertiskos to the west, parts of Krousi to the west and portions of the Kerkini lies to the northwest. The regional unit borders on Thessaloniki to the southwest, Kilkis to the west, North Macedonia with the Novo Selo Municipality to the northwest, the Blagoevgrad Province of Bulgaria to the north, Drama to the northeast and Kavala to the east. The Strymonian Gulf lies to the south along with the Strymonas delta. Lake Kerkini was a lake located in the southern portion which is now drained. 41% of the regional unit are arable and most of the lands are near the Strymonas river which flows from Bulgaria and empties into the Strymonian Gulf. Another river is the Angitis in the eastern part of the regional unit, with the ravine and caves near Alistrati.\n\nThe regional unit has many archaeological and historical features including Serres, Amphipolis, several monasteries, and Metaxa near the border with Bulgaria. The regional unit is also a tourist attraction including Lailia, rich in forests, a skiing resort in the central portion, lake Kerkini which is a reservoir supplying water to the farmlands. Fishing is common within Ano Poroia especially during the summer months and famous Alistrati's caves and the nearby Aggitis ravine.\n\nThe southern part around the Strymonas valley has a Mediterranean climate, the rest is predominantly continental with cold winters in higher elevations.\n\nIn modern times, Serres, like the rest of Macedonia was contested territory between Greece, Bulgaria, Serbia and the Ottoman Empire. After its liberation from the Turks by the Bulgarians in the First Balkan War, Serres became a part of Greece at the end of the Second Balkan War. During the National Schism, it was occupied by Bulgaria again only to form part of Greece at the end of the war. During the Second World War Bulgaria occupied Serres and launched a campaign of Bulgarisation. It was liberated in 1944.\n\nA substantial portion of the population of the regional unit are descendants of refugees which came from Eastern Thrace which is now Northwestern Turkey, Asia Minor and from Pontus during the Greco-Turkish War.\n\nThe regional unit Serres is subdivided into 7 municipalities. These are (number as in the map in the infobox):\n\nAs a part of the 2011 Kallikratis government reform, the Serres regional unit was created out of the former Serres Prefecture ().

{"id": "1802316", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1802316", "title": "FaSinPat", "text": "FaSinPat\n\nFaSinPat, formerly known as Zanon, is a worker-controlled ceramic tile factory in the southern Argentine province of Neuquén, and one of the most prominent in the recovered factory movement of Argentina. The name is short for \"Fábrica Sin Patrones\", which means \"Factory Without Bosses\" in Spanish.\n\nThe factory was opened in the early 1980s by Luis Zanon, when Argentina was ruled by a dictatorship. According to Alejandro López, a representative of the workers' union, Zanon's factory was built on public land using public funding from the national and provincial governments, which were never repaid. In the inaugural parade, Luigi Zanon congratulated the military government for \"keeping Argentina safe for investments\", in a reference to the Dirty War (the illegal repression of political dissidents). During the 1990s, Zanon grew because of loans from the national and provincial governments; Luigi Zanon was a good friend of both former president Carlos Menem and former governor of Neuquén, Jorge Sobisch.\n\nAccording to López, the Zanon labour union came under the control of criminal elements that acted in collusion with the factory owners during the 1990s, when Argentine labour laws offered little protection to workers. In 2000, after they had taken back control of the union leadership, Zanon workers started to demand improved working conditions. The increased labour activism led to serious conflict with the factory owner, who started firing workers until he decided for a lockout in 2001 in the hope of hiring a more docile workforce in the future.\n\nAfter the closure of the Zanon factory, workers occupied the abandoned factory in a desperate attempt to keep their jobs. They justified this by the large amount of money they were owed in back pay, the fact that the Zanon factory had been built with public funds, as well as worries about asset stripping. These events occurred in the general context of the turmoil created by the 2001 economic crisis. Following the initial occupation, the workers spent months camping outside of the factory without receiving any wages. Facing an attempted lockout by Zanon's management, the workers voted on October 2, 2001, to remain in the factory. On March 2, 2002, 240 workers resumed production for the first time without Zanon management supervision.\n\nIn the beginning, the takeover was not explicitly resisted by Luigi Zanon. In 2002, the government abandoned the fixed one-to-one peso–dollar parity and decreed the \"pesificación\" (\"peso-ification\"), the conversion of all bank accounts denominated in dollars into pesos at the official rate. As a result of the changed economic environment, FaSinPat started to be profitable again, and Luigi Zanon attempted to reclaim ownership of the factory. This included legal action and pressure to force the government to evict all of the workers. FaSinPat has also been the target of increasing violence and death threats, such as the kidnapping and torture of a female worker in March 2005.\n\nFaSinPat has been financially successful and able to expand. During four years of operation, over 170 new workers were hired, bringing the total number of workers to 410 by April 2005. Hindering FaSinPat's profitability is that the worker-controlled factory pays full price for electricity and gas while the previous owner only paid 20%. FaSinPat is the only factory in Neuquén to do so. In eight years the Neuquén Province has not bought any tiles from FaSinPat.\nFaSinPat has nurtured its relationship with the surrounding community. From the start, the recovered factory donated tiles to community centers and hospitals and organised cultural activities for the community on its premises. In 2005, FaSinPat voted to build a community health clinic in the impoverished Nueva España neighbourhood. The inhabitants of Nueva España had been demanding such a clinic from the provincial government for two decades; FaSinPat built it in three months. The workers also make monthly donations to soup kitchens and hospitals. Community support has been very important in protecting the recovered factory from the threats it is subjected to.\n\nOn August 14, 2009, the provincial legislature voted to expropriate the factory to the Zanon cooperative legally and indefinitely by a count of 26 for and 9 against. The state also agreed to pay the principal creditors still owed roughly 22 million pesos (around $7 million). Chief amongst these creditors are the World Bank, from whom Luis Zanon took a substantial loan to start the factory, and Sacmi, an Italian company that produces ceramics machinery. However, the cooperative has resisted these moves, arguing that these creditors participated in a fraudulent bankruptcy in 2001, and that Zanon himself should be liable for these debts, because the credits went to him personally, and not the plant.\n\nThe FaSinPat workers' contributions to the development of rank and file unionism (\"sindicalismo de base\") played a major role in their capability to organize among themselves and maintain control of the factory. This style of unionism, which incorporates worker assemblies, taking control of internal assemblies, and constituting alternative union locals presented a challenge to the dominant organizational structure of powerful unions such as the CGT (General Confederation of Labor), which have a more bureaucratic organization and a tendency to compromise to management demands. In 2000, the Zanon workers took over Local 21 of the \"Sindicato de Obreros y Empleados Ceramistas de Neuquén\" (SOECN), an affiliate of the national ceramists' union.The SOCEN's constitution is grounded on three basic principles: \"worker's democracy\", \"class autonomy\", and \"internationalism and anti-imperialism\". The style of class-conscious unionism employed by the Zanon workers under SOECN represents a break to the traditional form of Peronist unionism in Argentina. Through the SOECN, the workers have supported the Unemployed Worker's Movement of Neuquén (\"Movimiento de Trabajadores Desocupados\") and have supported the Unemployed Workers' Union (\"Union de Trabajadores Desocupados\").\n\n\n"}

The Texas toast loaf itself is often more squarish compared to most sliced breads which have a more curved side and top. While Texas toast bread can be used in the same manner as ordinary bread slices such as in sandwiches, it is especially useful for dishes involving liquids, such as barbecue sauce, or where extra thickness could improve the product, such as French toast. In addition, the often increased thickness of the slices of Texas toast lets it retain moisture and softness better than regular sliced bread. It is usually a white bread although there are whole wheat varieties. Producers of Texas toast in the United States include Franz Bakery, Mrs. Baird's, and Safeway/Lucerne Foods.\n\nPopular in Texas and its bordering states, Texas toast is often served as a side with southern-style dishes such as chicken fried steak, fried catfish, or BBQ. Texas toast can also be used when making toasted sandwiches.\n\nThe actual toast itself is made by putting butter or margarine on both sides of the bread and broiling or grilling it until it is a lightly golden brown. Depending on the recipe, the spread may contain seasonings including garlic, yielding a form of garlic bread. The toast may include cheese on one or both sides, similar to an open-faced grilled cheese sandwich.\n\nThe best-selling varieties of Texas toast are frozen breads, sold with a garlic or garlic and cheese spread which is applied immediately after baking. The best selling brands are the New York Brand of the T. Marzetti Company, Pepperidge Farm, and Coles.\n\nSome recipes suggest regular or thick-sliced bread be cooked in a frying pan alongside fried steak, bacon, or other meat product in order to absorb the grease from the meat (cf. fried bread).\n\nBread of this thickness, is sold, amongst other thicknesses, within Japan.\n\nOne claimant to the invention of Texas toast is from Sante Fe, New Mexico, in the early 1920s. The once-thriving chain, whose heyday in the 1940s saw over 100 locations across the United States, also claims to be the originator of the onion ring. Texas toast may have been first created in 1946 at the Pig Stand in Denton, Texas, after a bakery order for thicker slices of bread resulted in slices too thick for the toaster and a cook, Wiley W. W. Cross, suggested buttering and grilling them as a solution. Another Pig Stand cook in Beaumont, Texas claimed he created the idea of grilling the bread. W.W.W. Cross is also credited for combining the Texas toast with chicken fried steak to create Kirby's Pig Stand's famous Chicken Fried Steak Sandwich.\n\n"}

The equipment ranges from balls, to nets, and to protective gear like helmets. Sporting equipment can be used as protective gear or as tool used to help the athletes play the sport. Over time, sporting equipment has evolved because sports have started to require more protective gear to prevent injuries. Sporting equipment may be found in any department store.\n\nThe ball is often what a sport requires and revolves around. A sports ball is typically round, but can also be in the shape of a prolate spheroid in the case of an American football or a rugby ball.\n\nSports are often named after the ball used, such as association football, American football, baseball and basketball, or the ball is named after the sport. Other cases are the Gaelic football. In other cases, the name of the sport is indicated, just as the cricket ball, golf ball, lacrosse ball or water polo ball.\n\nFlying discs are used for various games such as freestyle, disc golf and ultimate.\n\nIn many games, goal posts are at each end of the playing field, there are two vertical posts (or uprights) supporting a horizontal crossbar. In some games, such as football, hockey or water polo, the object is to pass the ball or puck between the posts below the crossbar, while in others, such as those based on rugby, the ball must pass over the crossbar instead.\n\nNets are used for tennis, volleyball, football, basketball, hockey and badminton.\nA different type of net is used for various forms of fishing.\n\nRacquets are used for racquet sports such as tennis, squash and badminton.\n\nFishing rods and fishing tackle are primarily used for fishing and sport fishing.\n\nSticks are used for sports such as hockey and lacrosse.\nBats are used for sports such as baseball and cricket.\nClubs are used mainly for golf (Golf club)\n\nWickets and balls are used in cricket, and bases are used in baseball.\n\nFootwear for sports includes:\n\nProtective equipment is often worn for sports including motor sport and contact sports, such as ice hockey and American football or sports where there is a danger of injury through collision of players or other objects. Protective equipment includes:\n\nExamples for training equipment include swiss balls, weights, chin-up bars, equipment for the gym. Also protective equipment such as weight lifting belts and bench shirts for weight training and powerlifting.\n\nVehicles (sometimes specialized) are used as equipment for some sports, including motor sport, cycling, aeronautics, sailing and hot air ballooning.\n\nSmall vehicles with flatbeds are often used to carry injured athletes off the field, most commonly in American football.\n\nHistorically many sports have developed their sporting equipment over time. For instance, the use of a football dates back to ancient China, between 225 BC and 220 AD. As football remains the most popular sport in the 21st century, the material of the ball has completely changed over the centuries; from being made out of animal skin, to being lined with multiple layers of polyester or cotton.\n\nAs the sporting equipment industry improves, so does the athletes performance. This is due to the fact that the equipment is more efficient, lighter and stronger it forming a bio-mechanical system, interacting with the athlete.\n\nSince the massive adoption of wearable, new sport equipment tend to be electronics and connected to deliver data performances.\n\n"}
