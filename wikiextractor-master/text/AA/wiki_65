{"id": "1868998", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1868998", "title": "Burn (Usher song)", "text": "Burn (Usher song)\n\n\"Burn\" is a song by American R&B singer Usher, which he wrote with American songwriters Jermaine Dupri and Bryan-Michael Cox. The song was produced by Dupri and Cox for Usher's fourth studio album, \"Confessions\" (2004). Originally planned as the album's lead single, \"Burn\" was pushed back after favorable responses for the song \"Yeah!\" \"Burn\" was released as the second single from the album on March 21, 2004. \n\n\"Burn\" topped various charts around the world, including the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for eight non-consecutive weeks; it succeeded \"Yeah!\" at number one. Both singles gave Usher nineteen consecutive weeks at the top spot, longer than any solo artist of the Hot 100 era. \"Burn\" was certified platinum in Australia and United States, and gold in New Zealand. The song was well received by critics and garnered award nominations. In 2009 it was named the 21st most successful song of the 2000s, on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 Songs of the Decade. This song won the 2005 Kids' Choice Award for Favorite Song.\n\nWhen Usher planned to make a new record after his third album, \"8701\" (2001), he decided to not branch out much with collaborators and continue building music with his previous producers. Usher again enlisted record-producer Jermaine Dupri, who had collaborated on his two previous albums, along with The Neptunes and R. Kelly, among others, to work on his fourth studio album, \"Confessions\" (2004). Dupri contacted his frequent collaborator Bryan-Michael Cox, who had also made hits like the 2001 single \"U Got It Bad\" for Usher. During an early session for the album, Dupri and Cox talked about a situation which later became \"Burn\". At that time, Usher's two-year relationship with TLC's Chilli was flaming out. They said, \"Yo, you gotta let that burn ... That's a song right there\", and started writing.\n\nUsher submitted the album to his label Arista Records after he felt it was completed. After he and the company's then-president Antonio \"LA\" Reid listened to the songs, they felt the album needed a first single and that they needed to create one or two more songs, which caused the album's release to be postponed. Usher went back to the studio and collaborated with Lil Jon, who said, \"He needed a single. They had 'Burn,' 'Burn' was hot, but they needed that first powerful monster. That's when I came in.\" They worked on few more tracks, including \"Red Light\", which was not included in the first release of the album, and \"Yeah!\", which features Ludacris and Lil Jon.\n\nLabel personnel were undecided as to what to consider as the lead single. Reid was considering whether \"Yeah!\" would be released then, being as they also had \"Burn\". Usher was doubtful if the former was the right choice, after he wanted an R&B record. Until \"Yeah!\" was leaked, \"Burn\" was chosen as the official first single from \"Confessions\". \"Yeah!\", which was intended as a promotional song and a teaser for Usher's fans, was released to street DJs and mixtapes. However, the favorable response to the song led to a change; \"Yeah!\" was the lead single and \"Burn\" was set as its follow-up. \"Burn\" was released in the United States on March 21, 2004 as a CD single, Digital Download and 7\" single.\n\nUsher decided about the new material \"to let it all hang out by singing about some of his own little secrets, as well as a few bones from his homies' skeleton-filled closets.\" The public speculated that he was referring to his recent personal struggles, on which he promised a \"real talk\". \n\nIn early 2004, Usher broke up with Chilli due to \"irreconcilable differences and because they found it almost impossible to make compromises.\" Usher said in an interview: \"It's unfortunate when you have to let a situation go because it's not working\", which added reference to the breakup. It was later revealed that Chilli in fact broke up with Usher because of cheating, and the media said otherwise because of the lyrics in the song, which was not based on their relationship. Dupri, however, confessed that his personal life is the real story of the album. Usher said he took inspiration collectively by looking at his friends' personal situations.\n\n\"Burn\" is a slow jam R&B ballad. The song is performed with a moderate groove. It is composed in the key of C-sharp major. The melody line of the song has influences from \"Ignition (Remix)\" by R. Kelly and \"How to Deal\" by Frankie J. \"Burn\" has a combination of robotic noises, synthesized strings and guitar lines.\n\nThe lyrics are constructed in the traditional verse-chorus form. The song starts with a spoken intro, giving way to the first verse. It continues to the chorus, following the second verse and chorus. The bridge follows, leading to a break and finalizing in the chorus. \n\n\"Burn\" was considered a \"window to Usher's inner thoughts\", along with the controversial track \"Confessions\" and \"Confessions Part II\". The song is about breakups and ending relationships. According to Matt Cibula of Popmatters, \"Burn\" is constructed from \"two-step concept\". In the lyrics \"You know that it's over / You know that it was through / Let it burn / Got to let it burn\", Usher breaks up with his woman but found her sad about feeling bad about what happened to their relationship. However, Usher says that she must deal with it before she can accept the truth. For the lines \"It's been fifty-eleven days / Umpteen hours / I'm gonna be burnin' / Till you return\", the direction changes after Usher realized that breaking up with her was a huge mistake and that he wanted her back.\n\n\"Burn\" was lauded by contemporary music critics. Jem Aswad of \"Entertainment Weekly\" complimented Dupri and Cox for producing what he called the \"best song\" from the album, along with \"Confessions Part II\", which they also produced. Aswad said the songs feature \"mellifluous melodies\". Laura Sinagra of \"Rolling Stone\" found Usher's singing a \"sweet falsetto on the weepy breakup song \", adding, it \"convincingly marries resolve and regret, but when it comes to rough stuff, there's still no 'u' in p-i-m-p.\" Cibula called the song brilliant and considers its step one and step two technique a hit. Jon Caramanica of \"Blender\" complimented the song for being the only \"serviceable\" track among all ballad-influenced songs in the album which \"often drown in their own inanity.\" Ande Kellman of Allmusic considered \"Burn\" as one of the Usher's best moments in the album, together with \"Caught Up\", the final single from \"Confessions\". Steve Jones of \"USA Today\" stated that Usher is singing about a relationship that cannot be saved because of the \"flame has simply died\".\n\n\"Burn\" was nominated at the 47th Grammy Awards for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance and Best R&B Song. The song earned British record company EMI the \"Publisher of the Year\" at the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers 2005 Pop Music Awards.\n\n\"Burn\" was another commercial success for Usher. In the United States, the single debuted on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 at number sixty-five, months prior to its physical release. It reached the top spot on May 29, 2004, replacing \"Yeah!\"'s twelve-week run at number one. The single was beaten by Fantasia's 2004 single \"I Believe\", which charted on its debut. It returned to number one for one last week, before it was finally knocked off by the album's third single, \"Confessions Part II\". The single failed to remain on the top spot as long as \"Yeah!\" did, staying only for eight non-consecutive weeks. \"Burn\" was the fifth most-played song in 2004 for earning 355,228 total plays, alongside \"Yeah!\" which topped the tally with 496,805 plays. The single was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipping 1,000,000 units. It became the second best-selling single in the United States, behind Usher's single \"Yeah!\" This gives him the distinction, alongside The Beatles in 1964, to have two of his singles occupying the top two spots on the \"Billboard\" Year-End Chart. Like \"Yeah!\", \"Burn\" helped \"Confessions\" remain on the top spot.\n\nInternationally, several music markets responded equally well. In the United Kingdom, the single debuted at number one and stayed for two weeks. Across European countries, the single performed well, reaching the top ten in Denmark, Ireland, Norway, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. It entered the top twenty in Austria, Belgium, Germany and Sweden. In Australia, the single debuted at number three and peaked at number two. The single was certified 2x platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association for selling 140,000 units. In the 2004 year ender charts, \"Burn\" became the thirty-first best-selling single in Australia. In New Zealand, it peaked at number one for three weeks, and remained on the charts for twenty-three weeks. The single was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand.\n\nThe music video for \"Burn\" was directed by Jake Nava, who had produced a wide array of videos for Atomic Kitten, Beyoncé Knowles, among others. It was shot at the former Hollywood house of American popular singer Frank Sinatra. The video features model Jessica Clark. In the July 2008 issue of \"Vibe\" magazine, Usher told writer Mitzi Miller, \"Women have started to become lovers of each other as a result of not having enough men.\" On June 26, 2008, AfterEllen.com writer Sarah Warn revealed that Jessica Clark, the lead in Usher's \"Burn\" music video, was in fact an openly gay model. In the article, Warn writes, \"Maybe it's not a lack of men that's turning women gay, Usher--maybe it's you!\"\n\nThe video starts with Usher sitting on a sofa with a backdrop of his girlfriend. When the verse starts, Usher goes to a wide glass window pane, looking at his girlfriend swimming in the pool. The surface is aflame after she is immersed in the water. In the next scene, Usher and his mistress are having sex. While sitting on the edge of the bed, Usher reminisces about the moments he and his girlfriend had have in the same bed. The bedsheets burn, the scene then cutting to Usher riding a silver right-hand drive Aston Martin DB5 with a British registration - EGF 158B (the car was featured in the TV series \"Fastlane\"). The video cuts with the backdrop also burning. Continuing to the car scene, Usher stops as he sees his imaginary girl again. He and dances, executing various hand routines. Video intercuts follow and the video ends with Usher standing. Right before the last chorus, the screen changes from a small screen to a full one with no framework.\n\nThe music video debuted on MTV's \"Total Request Live\" at number six on May 4, 2004, debuting with \"Confessions Part II\". The video reached the top spot and remained on the countdown for thirty-three days. \"Burn\" topped MuchMusic's \"Countdown\" on July 24, 2004, and remained on the chart for fifteen weeks.\n\nCox benefited from co-creating \"Confessions\", as well as from the success of \"Burn\". He had previously contributed to records for Alicia Keys, B2K, Mariah Carey and Destiny's Child, but he felt 2004 introduced him to another landscape in the music industry. His contribution to this song elevated him to fame, and garnered more attention for his past work. \"Burn\" earned him two Grammy nominations. Cox said, \"Everybody who does this for a living, dreams about being nominated. It's the ultimate accomplishment. I've always been the silent guy — I come in, do my job and head out. I like to leave all the glory and shine to others, but this is the validation that means the most to me. It also makes me want to work harder to get that same recognition again.\"\n\nAn a cappella version was created by South Asian fusion a cappella group Stanford Raagapella.\n\n"}

His father, John Bradley, was long thought to be one of the six men who was in the photograph raising the American flag on Mt. Suribachi during the Battle of Iwo Jima in 1945. That photograph has gone on to be one of the most duplicated and reproduced photos ever taken.\n\nOn June 23, 2016, the Marine Corps announced after an investigation, that John Bradley was not in Rosenthal's photograph of six Marines raising the second (and larger) flag on Mount Suribachi on February 23, 1945, although he had been involved in the first raising of a smaller flag two hours earlier, and was still on the mountaintop during the second flag raising.\n\nIn 2000, Bradley published \"Flags of Our Fathers\", written with the author Ron Powers, which tells the story of five US Marines and a US Navy corpsman attached to the Marines Corps (his father, John Bradley, who did not raise the second, larger flag), raising the American flag during the Battle of Iwo Jima and the Seventh War Loan Drive after the battle. In that book, which spent 46 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list and was made into a film directed by Clint Eastwood, Bradley took great care to locate and speak with family and friends who actually knew the men depicted. In doing so, he received praise for his realistic portrayals and bringing the men involved to life.\n\nThe book and the film are in-depth looks at those involved and their war-time service. Of the six men who raised the second and larger replacement flag on Mount Suribachi on February 23, 1945, PhM2c. John Bradley, although he had been involved in only the first raising of a smaller flag hours before, was not involved in the second flag raising, Pfc. Ira Hayes, and Pfc. Rene Gagnon were the only survivors of the battle. Sgt. Michael Strank, Cpl. Harlon Block, and Pfc. Franklin Sousley were killed in action later on in the battle. The book and film tell the story in a before, during, and after format, and both were well received upon their release. An impromptu speech Bradley, who did not raise the flag, gave at the Marine Corps War Memorial (sometimes called the Iwo Jima memorial) was transcribed by Michael T. Powers in October 2000, and widely circulated on the Internet. On June 23, 2016, the United States Marine Corps identified Cpl. Harold Schultz as the sixth flag raiser for the second flag.\n\nIn 2003, Bradley published \"\". That book tells the story of an air raid that took place during the Battle of Iwo Jima, some 150 miles away, when United States warplanes bombed the small communications outpost on Chichi Jima. While Iwo Jima had Japanese forces numbering 22,000, Chichi Jima's forces numbered 25,000. Nine American crewmen survived after being shot down in the raid. One was picked up by the American submarine USS \"Finback\". That was Lieutenant George H. W. Bush, who later went on to become the 41st President of the United States. The other eight were captured as POWs by the Japanese and were executed and eaten, a fact that remained hidden until much later. Like \"Flags of Our Fathers\", \"Flyboys: A True Story of Courage\" also topped the New York Times Bestseller list when it came out.\n\nIn 2009, he published his third \"New York Times\" best selling book, \"The Imperial Cruise\". It concerns the 1905 diplomatic mission led by then-Secretary of War William Howard Taft and Alice Roosevelt, as well as the larger implications of President Theodore Roosevelt's foreign policy, particularly with regard to Japan. \"The New York Times\" published a complimentary review, writing that \"The Imperial Cruise is startling enough to reshape conventional wisdom about Roosevelt's presidency.\" The book exposes the blatantly racist and exploitative policy of the United States in its attempt to extend its influence into the Pacific rim, acquiring Hawaii by conquest and the Philippines by purchase from the Spanish after ostensibly having entered the conflict to aid the Filipino freedom fighters. The American occupation was marked by torture and repression of the very people they had come to help.\n\n\"The China Mirage: The Hidden History of American Disaster in Asia\" is James' fourth book, detailing America's involvement in China since the early 19th Century during the heights of opium trade, through the conclusion of the Second World War and Mao Zedong's rise to power. The premise of the book is how the United States failed to understand Asian cultures that led to poor decision-making by policy makers in the US State Department as well as by both President Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin Roosevelt. Ultimately, Bradley makes the suggestion that the War in the Pacific, the Korean War and the Vietnam War would have been avoided had President Franklin Roosevelt not been unduly influenced by the China Lobby that supported Chiang Kai-shek.\n\nJames Bradley's father, John Bradley, is featured incorrectly as a flag raiser of the second flag in the 2006 Clint Eastwood movie \"Flags of Our Fathers\", which was made a decade before new evidence showed he was not one of them, where he is played by American actor Ryan Phillippe. The movie is based on James Bradley's book of the same title.\n\n\n"}

Many different oxygen fluorides are known:\n\nOxygen fluorides are strong oxidizing agents with high energy and can release their energy either instantaneously or at a controlled rate. Thus, these compounds attracted much attention as potential fuels in jet propulsion systems.\n\nHere are some synthesis methods and reactions of the three most common oxygen fluorides – oxygen difluoride (OF), dioxygen difluoride (OF) and ozone difluoride (OF).\n\nA common preparative method involves fluorination of sodium hydroxide:\n\nOF is a colorless gas at room temperature and a yellow liquid below 128 K. Oxygen difluoride has an irritating odor and is poisonous. It reacts quantitatively with aqueous haloacids to give free halogens:\n\nIt can also displace halogens from their salts. It is both an effective fluorinating agent and a strong oxidizing agent. When reacted with unsaturated nitrogen fluorides with electrical discharge, it results in the formation of nitrogen trifluoride, oxide fluorides and other oxides.\n\nOF precipitates as a brown solid upon the UV irradiation of a mixture of liquid O and F at -196 °C. It also only appears to be stable below -160 °C. The general method of preparation of many oxygen fluorides is a gas-phase electric discharge in cold containers including OF.\n\nIt is typically an orange-yellow solid which rapidly decomposes to O and F close to its normal boiling point of about 216 K.\n\nOF reacts violently with red phosphorus, even at -196 °C. Explosions can also occur if Freon-13 is used to moderate the reaction.\n\nOF is a viscous, blood-red liquid. It remains liquid at 90 K and so can be differentiated from OF which has a melting point of about 109 K.\n\nLike the other oxygen fluorides, OF is endothermic and decomposes at about 115 K with the evolution of heat, which is given by the following reaction:\n\nOF is safer to work with than ozone, and can be evaporated, or thermally decomposed, or exposed to electric sparks, without any explosions. But on contact with organic matter or oxidizable compounds, it can detonate or explode. Thus, the addition of even one drop of ozone difluoride to solid anhydrous ammonia will result in a mild explosion, when they are both at 90 K each.\n\nDioxygen monofluoride is a molecule such as O-O-F, whose chemical formula is OF and is stable only at low temperature. It has been reported to be produced from atomic fluorine and dioxygen.\n\nOxygen- and fluorine-containing radicals like FO and FO occur in the atmosphere. These along with other halogen radicals have been implicated in the destruction of ozone in the atmosphere. However, the fluorine oxide \nradicals are assumed to not play as big a role in the ozone depletion because free fluorine atoms in the atmosphere are believed to react with methane to produce hydrofluoric acid which precipitates in rain. This decreases the availability of free fluorine atoms for oxygen atoms to react with and destroy ozone molecules.\n\nDespite the low solubility of OF in liquid oxygen, it has been shown to be hypergolic with most rocket propellant fuels. The mechanism involves the boiling off oxygen from the solution containing OF, making it more reactive to have a spontaneous reaction with the rocket fuel. The degree of reactivity is also dependent on the type of fuel used.\n\n\n"}

His sidekick was a dog named Thor, who was later retconned to be a robotic sentry operating under the auspices of the Manhunter cult. \n\nAccording to \"Jess Nevins' Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes\", Manhunter's enemies include \"ordinary criminals, Germans, the Nazi agent the Cobra, Dr. Sims (who has created telepathic brains-in-a-jar), the Ghostmaster, the whip-wielding female crime boss Red Kate, and the Spine-Snapper and his trained ape.\"\n\nDan's granddaughter, Marcie Cooper, became the third Harlequin after he convinced her to join the Manhunters.\n\nDan Richards was later killed by Mark Shaw, who had fallen back into his Dumas persona.\nOne of Paul Kirk's remaining clones, claiming the Manhunter identity and wearing Paul Kirk's Council-created uniform, masterminded the creation of the Secret Society of Super Villains. However, he died trying to kill Darkseid.\n\nA new \"Manhunter\" title (by Steven Grant and Vince Giarrano), unrelated to any of the previous Manhunters, was created in the aftermath of the \"Zero Hour\" limited series in 1994. Chase Lawler was a musician who summoned the Wild Huntsman to save himself and his girlfriend from harm. He did not understand the commitment he was making to the Wild Huntsman and found himself compelled to hunt the lonely. He tried to resist the urge by hunting villains, with limited success.\n\nLawler suffered a heart attack and Mark Shaw attempted to resuscitate him. This transferred the bond with the Wild Huntsman and the compulsion to hunt to Shaw. It was later revealed that Lawler had undergone the same mental programming as Mark Shaw and that the Wild Huntsman was actually an illusion created as a side effect. Lawler was drugged and then murdered by Shaw, who had fallen back into his Dumas persona.\n\nCreated by Kurt Busiek and Tom Grummett, the Kirk DePaul version of Manhunter was the last surviving Council-created clone of Paul Kirk and wore a variation of that Manhunter uniform. DePaul was roaming through Africa when his progenitor was killed. DePaul was a partner in the superhero-for-hire firm known as the Power Company. Fellow partner in the firm Skyrocket despised him for his miserly, materialistic attitude.\n\nDePaul's role in the Power Company attracted the attention of Asano Nitobe and Christine St. Clair, who confronted him. They established that he was not evil and, although St. Clair continued watching DePaul, decided not to kill him. DePaul was later murdered and decapitated by Mark Shaw who had suffered a breakdown and resumed his Dumas persona.\n\nAlthough never officially confirmed, it is strongly implied that DePaul was later resurrected by Morgaine le Fey as the character \"Swashbuckler\" in the comic book \"Trinity\" (2008–2009), a mercenary who shows all the skills of a Manhunter. \"Trinity\" writer Kurt Busiek (also the creator of Power Company and Kirk DePaul) confirmed that Swashbuckler is the only member of the \"Trinity\" series' villainous \"Dreambound\" that has been seen before in the DC Universe; \"\"Swashbuckler is a pre-existing character, but not a Silver Age one. There are clues in the story that indicate who he is, though...\"\" Also, in \"Trinity\" #27, Swashbuckler reveals a scar visible all around his neck. At the end of the \"Trinity\" series, the Dreambound including Swashbuckler switch to the side of the heroes, and are later pardoned in court. Their current whereabouts are unknown.\nKate Spencer, like Mark Shaw, is a lawyer, but instead works as a prosecutor. Outraged by the ability of supercriminals to escape justice, Spencer assembled a costume from a variety of devices left over from various heroes and villains. A Darkstar costume and Azrael's Batman gloves give Spencer enhanced strength, agility and resistance to injury while Mark Shaw's power staff allows her to fire bolts of energy. Spencer has taken on several minor league supervillains including Copperhead and the Shadow Thief.\n\nRecently Spencer fought her father, a minor league supervillain who erroneously claimed to be the son of Al Pratt – the Golden Age Atom. Kate is in fact the granddaughter of Phantom Lady and Iron Munro. Al Pratt allowed Sandra Knight (the Phantom Lady) to use his contact information in order to enter a home for unwed mothers, which led to the mix-up.\n\nMost recently Kate Spencer, in her heroic identity as Manhunter, began working with the US government's Department of Extranormal Operations, headed by the former criminal Mister Bones. The new \"Manhunter\" series in which she appears began in 2004. This current series has featured appearances by Dan Richards, Mark Shaw, Chase Lawler, and Kirk DePaul.\n\n\"Manhunter\" was initially slated to be cancelled due to low sales. However, a massive and organized fan campaign, along with support from DC Comics' management, allowed for another five-issue arc to be commissioned. It was revealed at the 2007 New York Comic-Con by Dan DiDio that the series had been given a second reprieve from cancellation. The series was meant to be restarted in July 2007, but has been put on hold until several issues have been written and drawn before the title resumes publication. The series returned in June 2008 with issue #31, written by co-creator Marc Andreyko and pencilled by Michael Gaydos. It ended again in January 2009 with issue #38.\n\nKate Spencer eventually joined the Birds of Prey, and her teammates were subsequently featured in a number of issues of the \"Manhunter\" series.\n\nKate Spencer briefly relocated to Gotham City where she took up a position as the new District Attorney. Her first adventures in Gotham were chronicled in a back-up feature in \"\". She later appeared in \"Justice Society of America\", which saw Kate move to the city of Monument Point and join the JSA.\n\nRamsey Robinson is the son of Kate Spencer and her ex-husband, Peter Robinson. He is revealed to have super powers in \"Manhunter\" (vol. 3) #33 when the seven-year-old smashed a semi-truck while rescuing his dog. Issue #38, penned as a \"future story\", details Ramsey's college graduation and introduces his super-powered boyfriend, Justin, as well as Jade, the super-powered daughter of Obsidian (who is named after Obsidian's twin sister, Jade). The story describes Ramsey, Justin, and Jade training to become the next generation of superheroes and ends with an older Kate presenting Ramsey with a man-made replica of her Darkstar exo-mantle as a graduation gift, hinting he's destined to be the next Manhunter.\n\nStarker, a bounty hunter in the future, was the star of \"Manhunter 2070\". The \"Manhunter 2070\" series was created by writer and artist Mike Sekowsky. Starker first appeared in the pages of \"Showcase\" #91–93 (June–September 1970).\n\nIn 2053 Starker's father was murdered by space pirates, and young Starker was taken as a galley slave. Starker took control of the pirate vessel, captured the pirates, and collected a bounty on them. Starker then decided to become a bounty hunter. He was aided by a robot named Arky.\n\nManhunter 2070 is one of six DC heroes featured in Walter Simonson's 2012 graphic novel, \"The Judas Coin\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1869051", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1869051", "title": "Lime Street (TV series)", "text": "Lime Street (TV series)\n\nLime Street is an American action/drama series that aired on the ABC television network during the 1985 television season. The series was created by Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, who also served as executive producer alongside husband Harry Thomason and series star Robert Wagner.\n\nJames Culver (Wagner), a widower, raises his two daughters, Elizabeth (Smith) and Margaret Ann (Brewton) with his own father (Ayres) and investigates insurance cases with the British Edward Wingate (Standing).\n\nThe cast of \"Lime Street\" included veteran Hollywood star Robert Wagner and Samantha Smith. Smith, a schoolgirl in Manchester, Maine, had written then-Soviet premier Yuri Andropov a letter asking him whether he was truly desirous of a nuclear war with the United States, as she had heard suggested by some. He wrote her a reply stating that he was not, and then invited her to visit the Soviet Union; the event, which was followed by media in both countries and elsewhere around the world, gained her fame.\n\nTwo versions exist of how Smith was cast into the show: one story states that she had caught the attention of Bloodworth-Thomason in early 1985 when the latter's brother-in-law spotted her on a talk show and suggested that she might fit the role of the elder daughter in the series, at that time known as J.G. Culver. Another suggests that Wagner, who had first seen her on \"The Tonight Show\", called her up, asking her to audition for the role.\n\nThree episodes and the pilot had been shot when Smith was killed on August 25, 1985, in the crash of a small plane belonging to Bar Harbor Airlines. Smith's death occurred prior to the airing of any of the programs, the premiere being on September 21. Although production continued, her role was never recast. Auditions were held instead for a new character, another daughter to Wagner's character, but the notion was entirely dropped. The plan had been for Smith's character, Elizabeth, to live on off-screen, moving to Paris to be with her divorced mother. The show was subsequently dedicated to Smith's memory.\n\nCritical reviews on \"Lime Street\" were not enamored of the program itself. Bill Kelley of the \"Sun-Sentinel\" said, \"Apart from the fact that the pilot devotes a large volume of boring time to depicting Wagner's J.G. Culver character as a doting father, there is virtually nothing to separate \"Lime Street\" from such Wagner series as \"It Takes a Thief\", \"Switch\" or \"Hart to Hart\"...The series pins its hopes squarely on the TV audience's fondness for the Wagner they have come to know over the years, rather than on plot turns or originality.\" There was genuine praise for Smith's talents and acting ability in the few episodes she had completed. John Leonard of \"New York\" said \"...Samantha was wonderful— but sincere, life-loving, a saint with bangs...\"\n\nHowever, the series had trouble finding much of an audience, mainly due to competition from NBC's Top 20 hits \"The Golden Girls\" and \"227\", both also debuting that same season. The fifth episode aired on ABC on October 26, 1985, after which the show was cancelled at the request of the producers, the episodes recorded after Smith's death having made them realize that going on with production had not been a wise decision.\n\nHowever, three then-unaired episodes were shown on the Lifetime network in 1987.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1869055", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1869055", "title": "Pygmalion (play)", "text": "Pygmalion (play)\n\nPygmalion is a play by George Bernard Shaw, named after a Greek mythological figure. It was first presented on stage to the public in 1913.\n\nIn ancient Greek mythology, Pygmalion fell in love with one of his sculptures, which then came to life. The general idea of that myth was a popular subject for Victorian era British playwrights, including one of Shaw's influences, W. S. Gilbert, who wrote a successful play based on the story called \"Pygmalion and Galatea\" that was first presented in 1871. Shaw would also have been familiar with the burlesque version, \"Galatea, or Pygmalion Reversed\". Shaw's play has been adapted numerous times, most notably as the 1956 musical \"My Fair Lady\" and its 1964 film version.\n\nShaw mentioned that the character of Professor Henry Higgins was inspired by several British professors of phonetics: Alexander Melville Bell, Alexander J. Ellis, Tito Pagliardini, but above all, the cantankerous Henry Sweet.\n\nShaw wrote the play in early 1912 and read it to famed actress Mrs. Patrick Campbell in June. She came on board almost immediately, but her mild nervous breakdown contributed to the delay of a London production. \"Pygmalion\" premiered at the Hofburg Theatre in Vienna on 16 October 1913, in a German translation by Shaw's Viennese literary agent and acolyte, Siegfried Trebitsch. Its first New York production opened on 24 March 1914 at the German-language Irving Place Theatre. It opened in London on 11 April 1914, at Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree's His Majesty's Theatre and starred Mrs. Campbell as Eliza and Tree as Higgins, running for 118 performances. Shaw directed the actors through tempestuous rehearsals often punctuated by at least one of the two storming out of the theatre in a rage.\n\nGeorge Orwell claimed that \"The central plot of Shaw's play, Pygmalion, is lifted out of Peregrine Pickle [by Smollett], and I believe that no one has ever pointed this out in print, which suggests that few people can have read the book.\" (\"As I Please\" TRIBUNE July 7, 1944)\n\nA group of people are sheltering from the rain. Among them are the Eynsford-Hills, superficial social climbers eking out a living in \"genteel poverty\", consisting initially of Mrs. Eynsford-Hill and her daughter Clara. Clara's brother Freddy enters having earlier been dispatched to secure them a cab (which they can ill-afford), but being rather timid and faint-hearted he has failed to do so. As he goes off once again to find a cab, he bumps into a flower girl, Eliza. Her flowers drop into the mud of Covent Garden, the flowers she needs to survive in her poverty-stricken world. Shortly, they are joined by a gentleman, Colonel Pickering. While Eliza tries to sell flowers to the Colonel, a bystander informs her that a man is writing down everything she says. The man is Henry Higgins, a professor of phonetics. Eliza worries that Higgins is a police officer and will not calm down until Higgins introduces himself. It soon becomes apparent that he and Colonel Pickering have a shared interest in phonetics; indeed, Pickering has come from India to meet Higgins, and Higgins was planning to go to India to meet Pickering. Higgins tells Pickering that he could pass off the flower girl as a duchess merely by teaching her to speak properly. These words of bravado spark an interest in Eliza, who would love to make changes in her life and become more mannerly, even though, to her, it only means working in a flower shop. At the end of the act, Freddy returns after finding a taxi, only to find that his mother and sister have gone and left him with the cab. The streetwise Eliza takes the cab from him, using the money that Higgins tossed to her, leaving him on his own.\n\nHiggins' home – the next day\n\nAs Higgins demonstrates his phonetics to Pickering, the housekeeper Mrs. Pearce, tells him that a young girl wants to see him. Eliza has shown up because she wishes to talk like a lady in a flower shop. She tells Higgins that she will pay for lessons. He shows no interest, but she reminds him of his boast the previous day. Higgins claimed that he could pass her for a duchess. Pickering makes a bet with him on his claim, and says that he will pay for her lessons if Higgins succeeds. She is sent off to have a bath. Mrs. Pearce tells Higgins that he must behave himself in the young girl's presence, meaning he must stop swearing, and improve his table manners, but he is at a loss to understand why she should find fault with him. Alfred Doolittle, Eliza's father, appears with the sole purpose of getting money out of Higgins, having no paternal interest in his daughter's welfare. He sees himself as a member of the undeserving poor, and means to go on being undeserving. With his intelligent mind untamed by education, he has an eccentric view of life. He is also aggressive, and when Eliza, on her return, sticks her tongue out at him, he goes to hit her, but is prevented by Pickering. The scene ends with Higgins telling Pickering that they really have got a difficult job on their hands.\n\nMrs. Higgins' drawing room\n\nHiggins bursts in and tells his mother he has picked up a \"common flower girl\" whom he has been teaching. Mrs. Higgins is not very impressed with her son's attempts to win her approval because it is her 'at home' day and she is entertaining visitors. The visitors are the Eynsford-Hills. Higgins is rude to them on their arrival. Eliza enters and soon falls into talking about the weather and her family. Whilst she is now able to speak in beautifully modulated tones, the substance of what she says remains unchanged from the gutter. She confides her suspicions that her aunt was killed by relatives, and mentions that gin had been \"mother's milk\" to this aunt, and that Eliza's own father was always more cheerful after a goodly amount of gin. Higgins passes off her remarks as \"the new small talk\", and Freddy is enraptured. When she is leaving, he asks her if she is going to walk across the park, to which she replies, \"Walk? Not bloody likely!\" (This is the most famous line from the play, and, for many years after the play's debut, use of the word 'bloody' was known as a \"pygmalion\"; Mrs. Campbell was considered to have risked her career by speaking the line on stage.) After she and the Eynsford-Hills leave, Henry asks for his mother's opinion. She says the girl is not presentable and is very concerned about what will happen to her, but neither Higgins nor Pickering understands her thoughts of Eliza's future, and leave feeling confident and excited about how Eliza will get on. This leaves Mrs. Higgins feeling exasperated, and exclaiming, \"Men! Men!! Men!!!\"\n\nHiggins' home – midnight\n\nHiggins, Pickering, and Eliza have returned from a ball. A tired Eliza sits unnoticed, brooding and silent, while Pickering congratulates Higgins on winning the bet. Higgins scoffs and declares the evening a \"silly tomfoolery\", thanking God it's over and saying that he had been sick of the whole thing for the last two months. Still barely acknowledging Eliza beyond asking her to leave a note for Mrs. Pearce regarding coffee, the two retire to bed. Higgins returns to the room, looking for his slippers, and Eliza throws them at him. Higgins is taken aback, and is at first completely unable to understand Eliza's preoccupation, which aside from being ignored after her triumph is the question of what she is to do now. When Higgins does understand he makes light of it, saying she could get married, but Eliza interprets this as selling herself like a prostitute. \"We were above that at the corner of Tottenham Court Road.\" Finally she returns her jewellery to Higgins, including the ring he had given her, which he throws into the fireplace with a violence that scares Eliza. Furious with himself for losing his temper, he damns Mrs. Pearce, the coffee and then Eliza, and finally himself, for \"lavishing\" his knowledge and his \"regard and intimacy\" on a \"heartless guttersnipe\", and retires in great dudgeon. Eliza roots around in the fireplace and retrieves the ring.\n\nMrs. Higgins' drawing room – the next morning\n\nHiggins and Pickering, perturbed by the discovery that Eliza has walked out on them, call on Mrs. Higgins to phone the police. Higgins is particularly distracted, since Eliza had assumed the responsibility of maintaining his diary and keeping track of his possessions, which causes Mrs. Higgins to decry their calling the police as though Eliza were \"a lost umbrella\". Doolittle is announced; he emerges dressed in splendid wedding attire and is furious with Higgins, who after their previous encounter had been so taken with Doolittle's unorthodox ethics that he had recommended him as the \"most original moralist in England\" to a rich American founding Moral Reform Societies; the American had subsequently left Doolittle a pension worth three thousand pounds a year, as a consequence of which Doolittle feels intimidated into joining the middle class and marrying his missus. Mrs. Higgins observes that this at least settles the problem of who shall provide for Eliza, to which Higgins objects – after all, he paid Doolittle five pounds for her. Mrs. Higgins informs her son that Eliza is upstairs, and explains the circumstances of her arrival, alluding to how marginalised and overlooked Eliza felt the previous night. Higgins is unable to appreciate this, and sulks when told that he must behave if Eliza is to join them. Doolittle is asked to wait outside.\n\nEliza enters, at ease and self-possessed. Higgins blusters but Eliza isn't shaken and speaks exclusively to Pickering. Throwing Higgins' previous insults back at him (\"Oh, I'm only a squashed cabbage leaf\"), Eliza remarks that it was only by Pickering's example that she learned to be a lady, which renders Higgins speechless. Eliza goes on to say that she has completely left behind the flower girl she was, and that she couldn't utter any of her old sounds if she tried – at which point Doolittle emerges from the balcony, causing Eliza to relapse totally into her gutter speech. Higgins is jubilant, jumping up and crowing over her. Doolittle explains his situation and asks if Eliza will come with him to his wedding. Pickering and Mrs. Higgins also agree to go, and leave with Doolittle and Eliza to follow.\n\nThe scene ends with another confrontation between Higgins and Eliza. Higgins asks if Eliza is satisfied with the revenge she has brought thus far and if she will now come back, but she refuses. Higgins defends himself from Eliza's earlier accusation by arguing that he treats everyone the same, so she shouldn't feel singled out. Eliza replies that she just wants a little kindness, and that since he will never stop to show her this, she will not come back, but will marry Freddy. Higgins scolds her for such low ambitions: he has made her \"a consort for a king.\" When she threatens to teach phonetics and offer herself as an assistant to Nepommuck, Higgins again loses his temper and promises to wring her neck if she does so. Eliza realises that this last threat strikes Higgins at the very core and that it gives her power over him; Higgins, for his part, is delighted to see a spark of fight in Eliza rather than her erstwhile fretting and worrying. He remarks \"I like you like this\", and calls her a \"pillar of strength\". Mrs. Higgins returns and she and Eliza depart for the wedding. As they leave, Higgins incorrigibly gives Eliza a number of errands to run, as though their recent conversation had not taken place. Eliza disdainfully explains why they are unnecessary and wonders what Higgins is going to do without her (in another version, Eliza disdainfully tells him to do the errands himself; Mrs. Higgins says that she'll get the items, but Higgins cheerfully tells her that Eliza will do it after all). Higgins laughs to himself at the idea of Eliza marrying Freddy as the play ends.\n\nThe play was well received by critics in major cities following its premieres in Vienna, London, and New York. The initial release in Vienna garnered several reviews describing the show as a positive departure from Shaw's usual dry and didactic style. The Broadway premiere in New York was praised in terms of both plot and acting, described as \"a love story with brusque diffidence and a wealth of humor.\" Reviews of the production in London were slightly less unequivocally positive, with the \"Telegraph\" noting that the play was deeply diverting with interesting mechanical staging, although the critic ultimately found the production somewhat shallow and overly lengthy. The \"London Times\", however, praised both the characters and actors (especially Sir Herbert Tree as Higgins and Mrs. Patrick Campbell as Eliza) and the happy if \"unconventional\" ending.\n\n\"Pygmalion\" was the most broadly appealing of all Shaw's plays. But popular audiences, looking for pleasant entertainment with big stars in a West End venue, wanted a \"happy ending\" for the characters they liked so well, as did some critics. During the 1914 run, to Shaw's exasperation but not to his surprise, Tree sought to sweeten Shaw's ending to please himself and his record houses. Shaw returned for the 100th performance and watched Higgins, standing at the window, toss a bouquet down to Eliza. \"My ending makes money; you ought to be grateful,\" protested Tree, to which Shaw replied, \"Your ending is damnable; you ought to be shot.\" Shaw remained sufficiently irritated to add a postscript essay, \"'What Happened Afterwards,\" to the 1916 print edition for inclusion with subsequent editions, in which he explained precisely why it was impossible for the story to end with Higgins and Eliza getting married.\n\nHe continued to protect what he saw as the play's, and Eliza's, integrity by protecting the last scene. For at least some performances during the 1920 revival, Shaw adjusted the ending in a way that underscored the Shavian message. In an undated note to Mrs. Campbell he wrote,\nWhen Eliza emancipates herself – when Galatea comes to life – she must not relapse. She must retain her pride and triumph to the end. When Higgins takes your arm on 'consort battleship' you must instantly throw him off with implacable pride; and this is the note until the final 'Buy them yourself.' He will go out on the balcony to watch your departure; come back triumphantly into the room; exclaim 'Galatea!' (meaning that the statue has come to life at last); and – curtain. Thus he gets the last word; and you get it too.\n\nShaw fought against a Higgins-Eliza happy-end pairing as late as 1938. He sent the [[Pygmalion (1938 film)|1938 film version]]'s producer, [[Gabriel Pascal]], a concluding sequence which he felt offered a fair compromise: a tender farewell scene between Higgins and Eliza, followed by one showing Freddy and Eliza happy in their greengrocery-flower shop. Only at the sneak preview did he learn that Pascal had finessed the question of Eliza's future with a slightly ambiguous final scene in which Eliza returns to the house of a sadly musing Higgins and self-mockingly quotes her previous self announcing, \"I washed my face and hands before I come, I did\".\n\n[[File:Pygmalion serialized November 1914.jpg|thumb|middle|First American (serialized) publication, \"[[Everybody's Magazine]]\", November 1914]]\nThere are two main versions of the play in circulation. One is based on the earlier version, first published in 1914; the other is a later version that includes several sequences revised by Shaw, first published in 1941. Therefore, different editions of the play omit or add certain lines. For instance, the Project Gutenberg version published online, which is transcribed from an early version, does not include Eliza's exchange with Mrs. Pearce in Act II, the scene with Nepommuck in Act III, or Higgins' famous declaration to Eliza, \"Yes, you squashed cabbage-leaf, you disgrace to the noble architecture of these columns, you incarnate insult to the English language! I could pass you off as the Queen of Sheba!\" – a line so famous that it is now retained in nearly all productions of the play, including the 1938 film version of \"Pygmalion\" as well as in the stage and film versions of \"My Fair Lady\".\n\nThe co-director of the 1938 film, [[Anthony Asquith]], had seen Mrs. Campbell in the 1920 revival of\" Pygmalion\" and noticed that she spoke the line, \"It's my belief \"as how\" they done the old woman in.\" He knew \"as how\" was not in Shaw's text, but he felt it added color and rhythm to Eliza's speech, and liked to think that Mrs. Campbell had [[ad libitum|ad libbed]] it herself. Eighteen years later he added it to Wendy Hiller's line in the film.\n\nIn the original play Eliza's test is met at an ambassador's garden party, offstage. For the 1938 film Shaw and co-writers replaced that exposition with a scene at an embassy ball; Nepommuck, the blackmailing translator spoken about in the play, is finally seen, but his name is updated to Aristid Karpathy – named so by Gabriel Pascal, the film's Hungarian producer, who also made sure that Karpathy mistakes Eliza for a Hungarian princess. In \"My Fair Lady\" he became Zoltan Karpathy. (The change of name was likely to avoid offending the sensibilities of Roman Catholics, as [[John of Nepomuk|St. John Nepomuk]] was, ironically, a Catholic martyr who refused to divulge the secrets of the confessional.)\n\nThe 1938 film also introduced the famous pronunciation exercises \"the rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain\" and \"In Hertford, Hereford, and Hampshire, hurricanes hardly ever happen\". Neither of these appears in the original play. Shaw's screen version of the play as well as a new print version incorporating the new sequences he had added for the film script were published in 1941. Many of the scenes that were written for the films were separated by asterisks, and explained in a \"Note for Technicians\" section.\n\n\"Pygmalion\" remains Shaw's most popular play. The play's widest audiences know it as the inspiration for the highly romanticized 1956 [[My Fair Lady|musical]] and 1964 film [[My Fair Lady (film)|\"My Fair Lady\"]].\n\n\"Pygmalion\" has transcended cultural and language barriers since its first production. The British Museum contains \"images of the Polish production...; a series of shots of a wonderfully Gallicised Higgins and Eliza in the first French production in Paris in 1923; a fascinating set for a Russian production of the 1930s. There was no country which didn't have its own 'take' on the subjects of class division and social mobility, and it's as enjoyable to view these subtle differences in settings and costumes as it is to imagine translators wracking their brains for their own equivalent of 'Not bloody likely'.\"\n\n[[Joseph Weizenbaum]] named his [[chatterbot]] computer program [[ELIZA]] after the character Eliza Doolittle.\n\n[[Peter Hogg]]'s novel \"[[Smilla's Sense of Snow]]\" features a \"Professor Higgins\" character - i.e., a skilled linguist able to deduce a person's geographical and social circumstances from hearing them speak; in that case, Hogg's linguist is an expert on the [[Inuit]] languages and dialects of [[Greenland]], but is equally at home in identifying at a glance the various dialects and [[sociolect]]s of Danish.\n\n[[File:Pygmalion-Fontanne-1926.jpg|thumb|[[Lynn Fontanne]] as Eliza Doolittle in the [[Theatre Guild]] production of \"Pygmalion\" (1926)]]\n\n[[File:Julie Andrews Rex Harrison My Fair Lady.JPG|thumb|[[Julie Andrews]] as flower girl Eliza Doolittle meets [[Rex Harrison]] as Professor Henry Higgins in the 1956 musical adaptation of \"Pygmalion\", \"[[My Fair Lady]]\".]]\n\n[[File:Harry Stradling-Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady.jpg|thumb|Cinematographer Harry Stradling poses with [[Audrey Hepburn]] as Eliza Doolittle on the set of the 1964 movie musical \"My Fair Lady.\"]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[Category:1913 plays]]\n[[Category:West End plays]]\n[[Category:Plays by George Bernard Shaw]]\n[[Category:Works originally published in Everybody's Magazine]]\n[[Category:Literature first published in serial form]]\n[[Category:Plays set in London]]\n[[Category:British plays adapted into films]]"}

The lyrics describe Guns N' Roses singer Axl Rose's experience of getting hustled in the Greyhound bus station upon first arriving in Los Angeles. \n\nThe song's lyrics caused great controversy among many different groups, and accusations of homophobia, nativism, and racism were leveled against Guns N' Roses' lead singer and song lyricist, Axl Rose. Music critic Jon Pareles noted that:\n\nIn a 1989 \"Rolling Stone\" interview, Rose explained the lyrics \"I used words like police and niggers because you're not allowed to use the word 'nigger.' Why can black people go up to each other and say, 'Nigger,' but when a white guy does it all of a sudden it's a big put-down. I don't like boundaries of any kind. I don't like being told what I can and what I can't say. I used the word 'nigger' because it's a word to describe somebody that is basically a pain in your life, a problem. The word 'nigger' doesn't necessarily mean black. Doesn't John Lennon have a song 'Woman Is the Nigger of the World'? There's a rap group, N.W.A. - Niggers With Attitude. I mean, they're proud of that word. More power to them. Guns N' Roses ain't bad. . . . N.W.A. is bad! Mr. Bob Goldthwait said the only reason we put these lyrics on the record was because it would cause controversy and we'd sell a million albums. Fuck him! Why'd he put us in his skit? We don't just do something to get the controversy, the press.\"\n\nThe cover of the \"GN'R Lies\" EP, which was designed as a mock-tabloid newspaper front page, actually contained an advance apology for the song, suggesting controversy was anticipated. A small \"article\" entitled \"One in a Million\", credited to Rose, ended: \"This song is very simple and extremely generic or generalized, my apologies to those who may take offense.\"\n\nIn response to the following accusations of homophobia, Rose initially stated that he was \"pro-heterosexual\" and \"I'm not against them doing what they want to do as long as it's not hurting anybody else and they're not forcing it upon me\", and spoke of negative experiences in his past, such as a seemingly friendly man who let him crash on his hotel room floor and then tried to rape him. He later softened this stance, and insisted that he was not homophobic, pointing out that some of his icons, such as Freddie Mercury and Elton John, as well as David Geffen, the head of his record label, were bisexual or gay.\n\nAxl Rose was also accused of being biased against police due to the negative lyrics in the song which mention them. Rose responded by claiming when he was a teenager he was once mistaken for a girl by two police officers, who then proceeded to make sexual comments towards him, infuriating him so much he attacked the officers, resulting in his arrest.\n\nNevertheless, others - including some of his peers in the music industry - accused him of racism for the use of the word 'niggers' in the song. When Guns N' Roses and Living Colour supported The Rolling Stones for a concert in Los Angeles in 1989, Living Colour guitarist Vernon Reid publicly commented on \"One in a Million\" during his band's set. After hearing this, Rose in turn suggested they play the song for their opening act \"just to piss them off.\"\n\nBy 1992, however, Rose seemed to have gained new perspective on the song and its lyrics. In one interview, he added, \"I was pissed off about some black people that were trying to rob me. I wanted to insult those particular black people.\"\n\nIn his final public comments about \"One in a Million\" in 1992, Rose stated, \"It was a way for me to express my anger at how vulnerable I felt in certain situations that had gone down in my life.\"\n\nThe song was not included on a 2018 box-set reissue of \"Appetite for Destruction\", which otherwise included the remaining songs recorded for \"G N' R Lies\" on a bonus disc.\n\nBefore the release of \"Lies\", the other members of the band tried in vain to make Rose drop the track from the record. Fellow GN'R member Slash, whose mother is black, noted that he did not condone the song but did not condemn his bandmate, commenting in a 1991 interview with \"Rolling Stone:\" \"When Axl first came up with the song and really wanted to do it, I said I didn't think it was very cool... I don't regret doing 'One in a Million', I just regret what we've been through because of it and the way people have perceived our personal feelings.\"\n\nIn 1988, rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin told rock critic Nick Kent that the lyrics simply reflected the poor race relations of inner city Los Angeles.\nIn a 2019 interview, McKagan said the song was misinterpreted, stating \"One thing about Axl is if you’re going to try to compete with him intellectually, you’ve lost, because he’s a super smart guy... He’s a super sensitive dude who does his studies. When we did that song, I was still drinking but he was way ahead of us with his vision of, ‘Something’s gotta be said.’ That was the most hardcore way to say it. So flash-forward to now. So many people have misinterpreted that song that we removed it ... Nobody got it.”\n\n"}

He was one of the most talented artists in the successful generation of painters who studied under Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg but died early and has therefore left a relatively small oeuvre.\n\nWilhelm Bendz was born on 20 March 1804 in Odense on the island of Funen. He was sent to Copenhagen where he attended the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts from 1820 to 1825, where he studied under Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg. In 1825 he made an unsuccessful attempt to win the gold medal, only given to history paintings, the most prestigious genre at that time, and after that decided to specialize in portraits and genre works. He may also have acquired some knowledge of contemporary German painting, the Munich School, which seems to have influenced his style.\n\nAfter his graduation from the Academy, Bendz contributed successfully with a number of works to the annual exhibitions at Charlottenborg in 1826, 1827 and 1828. Three of his paintings were acquired by the Royal Painting Collection; \"Model Class at the Art Academy\" and \"A young artist looking at a sketch through a mirror\" from 1826 and the monumentally sized \"A sculptor working with a live model\" from 1827. Another important work from this phase is \"A Tobacco Party\" from 1828.\n\nAfter this Bendz was employed as an assistant at Eckersberg's studio, working on routine assignments such as the reconstruction of Nikolaj Abraham Abildgaard's history paintings from Christiansborg Palace which had been destroyed in the fire of 1794, and painting copies of Eckersberg's works.\n\nIn late 1830 Bendz finally received a travel scholarship which enabled him to leave for southern Europe. After shorter visits to Dresden and Berlin, he initially went to Munich, which had developed into a vibrant centre for the arts, and where he stayed for around a year. His most important work from the stay is the thoroughly composed group portrait \"Artist in the Evening at Finck's Coffee House in Munich\".\n\nIn the autumn of 1832 he continued his journey towards Rome in company with Joseph Petzl and Thomas Fearnley, stopping in Venice on the way where he renewed his friendship with the painter Ditlev Blunck, who he had first met in his student days at the Academy in Copenhagen. They continued together but shortly after in Vicenza, Bendz, who had felt ill since Venice, died from a lung infection.\n\nToday he is mainly remembered for his many technically accomplished portraits, though his ambition most of all ran towards a refined fusion of portrait, genre scene and allegorical history painting. His technical virtuosity is particularly visible in his depictions of the play of light cast from an obscured source and the resulting shadows.\n\nHis main works include several portraits of his fellow artists such as Ditlev Blunck and Christen Christensen (both in the Danish National Gallery, a scene from the Academy's anatomy class, as well as the group portraits \"A Tobacco Party\" (Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek) and \"Artist in the Evening at Finck's Coffee House in Munich\" (Thorvaldsens Museum).\n\n\n"}

An All-SEC selection in each of his four years at The University of Mississippi, Reed led the team both on the court and in the locker room. As a freshman, Reed guided the Rebels through two NCAA tournament wins en route to a first ever \"Sweet Sixteen\" appearance for the Ole Miss program in 2001.\n\nFollowing his successful career as a forward at the University of Mississippi, Reed was selected in the second round (40th overall) by the Boston Celtics in the 2004 NBA draft. Following one and one-half seasons with little playing time, he was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves on January 26, 2006, in a multi-player deal; he enjoyed a successful 40 games with the Timberwolves and, at season's end, became a restricted free agent. Minnesota then rewarded him with a three-year contract worth $4,310,500.\n\nOn June 14, 2007, it was officially announced that Reed and teammate Mike James would be traded to the Houston Rockets, for Juwan Howard. He was subsequently waived by the Rockets without having appeared in a single game for them.\n\nReed died after a battle with angiosarcoma, a cancer of the blood, on October 20, 2017.\n\n"}

Hand-drawn animated cartoons are used to distinguish flashbacks, parables, stories, spiritual encounters and visions from the main plot, which is all in stop motion. (The daughter of Jairus is not named in the New Testament.)\n\n\"The Miracle Maker\" film appeared in the Welsh language on VHS: S4C Video in 1999 and TV: S4C In 2001. and later in English Cinemas-throughout the United Kingdom on BBC 1 in 2002. It had its American premiere in the United States on ABC in 2000, while Artisan Entertainment, and later Lionsgate, held the home video rights.\n\nThe film was directed by Derek Hayes and Stanislav Sokolov. It stars the voice of Ralph Fiennes as Jesus, and numerous other well-known actors.\n\nThe film ends with Anne Dudley's \"Pie Jesu\" for solo boy soprano and orchestra.\n\nThe film opens in ‘Sepphoris, Upper Galilee, Year 90 of the Roman Occupation.’ Jairus and his sick daughter Tamar are travelling to meet their friend Cleopas, who knows a doctor that may be able to help Tamar. However, the doctor is only able to offer painkillers, confiding to Jairus that there is nothing else that can be done. While Jairus is with the doctor, Tamar witnesses Jesus, one of the carpenters building a new synagogue, protect a deranged woman, Mary Magdalene, from being attacked by the townspeople. Jesus leaves his job, and goes to visit his mother, Mary. While he is there, Mary recalls his birth, the visit of the Wise Men, and how a young Jesus went missing during Passover and was found conferring with the elders at the Temple, who were amazed at his understanding of the scriptures. After leaving his mother's house, Jesus travels to the Jordan River to be baptised by John the Baptist. When Jesus rises out of the water, a voice from Heaven declares, \"This is my beloved son,\" and the Holy Spirit descends on him as a dove. After his baptism, Jesus wanders out into the wilderness, where he is repeatedly tempted by Satan. After Jesus rebukes Satan temptations and leaves the wilderness, he is met by his friend Lazarus. Jesus returns to Lazarus' home, where he is hosted by Lazarus’ sisters, Martha and Mary.\n\nJesus begins preaching the Sermon on the Mount in the fields near Capernaum. Tamar and her mother Rachel happen to be nearby, and Tamar wishes to stay and listen to Jesus, remembering him from her visit to Sepphoris. Jesus tells the Parable of the Wise and the Foolish Builders, while many priests listen on and debate the legitimacy of Jesus and his teachings. Tamar's illness worsens, and her mother takes her home despite Tamar's protests. Meanwhile, Judas and other zealots, including Barabbas, are plotting an uprising against the Romans in a cave nearby. Judas thinks Jesus is the Messiah come to deliver them from the Romans, and that the people will follow him to a glorious victory. He leaves the other zealots to follow Jesus, who mock him and believe he's chasing after foolish dreams.\n\nShortly afterward, Mary Magdalene is being harassed by the tax collector, Matthew, for not paying the tax to cross the border from Judea into Herod's Kingdom. Four fishermen, Simon, Andrew, James and John also confront Matthew, angry at having to pay taxes despite not having caught any fish. Jesus arrives, which excites Andrew but evokes scepticism from Simon. Jesus commandeers Simon and Andrew's boat to preach to the crowd from the water, and tells the Parable of the Mustard Seed. After the crowds have gone, Jesus tells the fishermen to row out into the deep and cast their nets. Simon protests, explaining that no one catches fish in the middle of the day as they hide from the sunlight, but eventually complies to appease Jesus. Much to the fishermen's surprise, they haul in an extremely large catch. Simon tearfully recognises Jesus as the Messiah, and Jesus says he will make him a fisher of men.\n\nSimon the Pharisee, an elder of the Capernaum Synagogue, is visited by Ben Azra, one of the Temple priests, worried about the possibility of Jesus causing a revolt. He says Jesus is more dangerous than John the Baptist and hints that John has already been 'dealt with'. Nearby, Tamar is resting on a balcony, watching a crowd of people swarming a house where Jesus is teaching. Simon the Pharisee and Ben Azra join the crowds to listen to Jesus. A group of men carrying their paralytic friend on a stretcher try to fight their way through the crowd so that Jesus may heal their friend, but find it impossible to make their way to the door. As Jesus teaches using the example of a man with a plank in his eye trying to remove a speck from another's eye, the men with the paralytic friend dig their way through the roof and lower their friend in front of Jesus. Jesus forgives the sins of the paralytic man, and heals him. Tamar and her family watch as the healed man dances through the streets. That night, Jesus encounters Mary Magdalene outside the town and casts several demons out of her. The next day, Jesus chooses his twelve apostles and changes Simon's name to Peter. Shortly afterward, the leaders of the synagogue have invited Jesus and his disciples to their house to question him. Mary Magdalene enters and washes Jesus’ feet with her tears, drying them with her hair. Jesus tells her that her sins are forgiven, causing Ben Azra and Simon the Pharisee to condemn Jesus as being in league with the Devil.\n\nTamar's illness worsens, but Jairus is hesitant to take her to Jesus as the leaders of his synagogue claim that anyone who follows Jesus is an enemy of God. Rachel pleads with Jairus to find Jesus and ask him save their daughter. Jairus agrees to go to Jesus, and pleads with him to heal Tamar. On the way to Jairus' house, a woman with internal bleeding reaches out to touch Jesus's robe and is cured. Just before they arrive at Jairus' house, servants come to tell Jairus that Tamar is dead. Jesus encourages Jairus to remain faithful, enters the house, and raises Tamar, who awakens fully healed. Jairus, Rachel, Cleopas, and Tamar begin to follow Jesus' as well. Jesus learns that King Herod has killed John the Baptist and mourns for him, while Ben Azra meets with Herod about Jesus. Herod regrets John's death but agrees that Jesus must be dealt with to prevent Pilate from reporting any uprisings against Rome.\n\nJesus and all his followers begin to make the journey from Capernaum to Jerusalem for the Passover festival. Meanwhile, Pilate and his Centurion prepare for an influx of pilgrims in Jerusalem, and discuss the suppression of an uprising and the capture of Judas’ friend Barabbas. Jesus teaches his followers on the road and tells the Parable of the Good Samaritan. A rider comes to Jesus and tells him his friend Lazarus is dying, begging him to come. Jesus does not go immediately, which confuses and upsets Tamar. A short time later, Ben Azra rushes to Caiaphas and explains that he witnessed Jesus raise Lazarus from the dead. Despite Ben Azra's apprehensions about the Jews possibly following a man as powerful as Jesus in an uprising against Rome, Caiaphas reasons that Jesus can be disposed of, placating Caesar's anger against the Jews.\n\nJesus enters Jerusalem, followed and greeted by adoring crowds. Judas begins to become disillusioned with Jesus, as the sight of Jesus on a donkey and people singing and waving palm branches does not fit his idea of a conquering army. Jesus and his disciples go to the Temple, where Jesus becomes enraged at the sight of the merchants who have set up shop inside. Jesus proclaims the Temple to be a house of prayer and turns the tables of the traders. The temple priests begin to plot to subdue Jesus, while the elders try to trick Jesus by asking him whether or not it is right to pay taxes. Jesus points out that Caesar's portrait and title are on the denarius, and proclaims that people should \"give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, but give to God what belongs to God!\" When Judas hears Jesus validate the payment of taxes to the Roman Empire, encounters Barabbas in prison, and hears Jesus predict His death, he despairs and resolves to betray Jesus to save himself and the Jewish people, reasoning that only a false Messiah would allow himself to be killed. He goes and offers his services to Ben Azra, who is looking for a way to arrest Jesus away from the crowds.\n\nJesus and his followers eat the Last Supper in secret, where Jesus tells his disciples they will abandon him. Jesus instructs Judas to do what he has to do, and Judas slips out to lead the authorities to Jesus. When they have finished supper, Jesus and his followers gather around fires outside. Cleopas and Jairus ask Jesus to explain all that they don't understand, to which Jesus replies that they will understand soon. He takes Peter, James and John to pray with him in the Garden of Gethsemane. Jesus goes off a bit further by himself, where he prays earnestly and is tempted by Satan to flee while he still can. Jesus refuses, and prays for God's will to be done. Judas returns and leads the authorities to Jesus, who is arrested by the Temple Guard while the disciples flee. Jesus is tried by Caiaphas and the Sanhedrin, who send him to Pilate. Despite having an intense dislike for the Jews, Pilate finds no case against Jesus and sends him to Herod. Herod mocks Jesus and sends him back to Pilate. Judas is overwhelmed with guilt and tries to appeal to Ben Azra, who dismisses him and asserts that what Judas has done is his own problem. Ben Azra gathers a crowd and instructs them to call for the crucifixion of Jesus and the release of Barabbas, despite Pilate's reluctance to do so. Caiaphas blackmails Pilate into condemning Jesus to death. Jairus learns what has happened and Jesus's followers run into Jerusalem, but are unable to interfere. Jesus is led up to Golgotha and crucified, while his followers look on. As Jesus dies, the sky goes dark and he proclaims ‘It is finished’. The curtain in the temple that separates the Holy of Holies from the rest of the temple is torn in two.\n\nThe disciples bury Jesus and mourn for him. Mary Magdalene returns to the tomb on Sunday morning and finds the body is gone. She encounters Jesus in the garden and goes to tell the other disciples, who believe she is mad. Peter goes to the tomb and also encounters Jesus. He tells the other disciples that he, too, has seen Jesus, but Thomas is sceptical. Cleopas and Jairus arrive, and tell the disciples that they encountered Jesus on the road to Emmaus. Thomas declares that they have all gone mad, and that he will not believe unless he sees Jesus and touches his wounds. Just then, Jesus appears, and Thomas also believes. Some time later, Jesus appears among all his followers on a mount, gives the Great Commission, and then ascends into heaven. A child asks where Jesus has gone, and Tamar explains that the Kingdom of God has come, and that Jesus will be with them forever.\n\n\nRenee Schonfeld wrote it was \"Birth of Christianity artfully animated; biblical violence.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1869085", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1869085", "title": "Pygmalion (mythology)", "text": "Pygmalion (mythology)\n\nPygmalion (; Ancient Greek: Πυγμαλίων \"Pugmalíōn\", \"gen\".: Πυγμαλίωνος) is a legendary figure of Cyprus in Greek mythology who was a king and a sculptor. Though \"Pygmalion\" is the Greek version of the Phoenician royal name \"Pumayyaton\", he is most familiar from Ovid's narrative poem \"Metamorphoses\", in which Pygmalion was a sculptor who fell in love with a statue he had carved.\n\nIn book 10 of Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\", Pygmalion was a Cypriot sculptor who carved a woman out of ivory. According to Ovid, after seeing the Propoetides prostituting themselves, Pygmalion declared that he was \"not interested in women\", but then found his statue was so beautiful and realistic that he fell in love with it.\n\nIn time, Aphrodite's festival day came, and Pygmalion made offerings at the altar of Aphrodite. There, too scared to admit his desire, he quietly wished for a bride who would be \"the living likeness of my ivory girl.\" When he returned home, he kissed his ivory statue, and found that its lips felt warm. He kissed it again, and found that the ivory had lost its hardness. Aphrodite had granted Pygmalion's wish.\n\nPygmalion married the ivory sculpture which changed to a woman under Aphrodite's blessing. In Ovid's narrative, they had a daughter, Paphos, from whom the city's name is derived.\n\nIn some versions Paphos was a son, and they also had a daughter, Metharme.\n\nOvid's mention of Paphos suggests that he was drawing on a more circumstantial account than the source for a passing mention of Pygmalion in Pseudo-Apollodorus' \"Bibliotheke\", a Hellenic mythography of the 2nd-century AD. Perhaps he drew on the lost narrative by Philostephanus that was paraphrased by Clement of Alexandria. In the story of Dido, Pygmalion is an evil king.\n\nThe story of the breath of life in a statue has parallels in the examples of Daedalus, who used quicksilver to install a voice in his statues; of Hephaestus, who created automata for his workshop; of Talos, an artificial man of bronze; and (according to Hesiod) of Pandora, who was made from clay at the behest of Zeus.\n\nThe moral anecdote of the \"Apega of Nabis\", recounted by the historian Polybius, described a supposed mechanical simulacrum of the tyrant's wife, that crushed victims in her embrace.\n\nThe trope of a sculpture so lifelike that it seemed about to move was a commonplace with writers on works of art in antiquity. This trope was inherited by writers on art after the Renaissance.\n\nThe basic Pygmalion story has been widely transmitted and re-presented in the arts through the centuries. At an unknown date, later authors give as the name of the statue that of the sea-nymph Galatea or Galathea. Goethe calls her Elise, based upon the variants in the story of Dido/Elissa.\n\nA variant of this theme can also be seen in the story of \"Pinocchio\", in which a wooden puppet is transformed into a \"real boy\", though in this case the puppet possesses sentience prior to its transformation; it is the puppet and not its creator, the woodcarver Mister Geppetto, who beseeches the divine powers for the miracle.\n\nIn the final scene of William Shakespeare's \"The Winter's Tale\", a statue of Queen Hermione which comes to life is revealed as Hermione herself, so bringing the play to a conclusion of reconciliations.\n\nIn George Bernard Shaw's 1913 play \"Pygmalion\", a modern variant of the myth with a subtle hint of feminism, the underclass flower-girl Eliza Doolittle is metaphorically \"brought to life\" by a phonetics professor, Henry Higgins, who teaches her to refine her accent and conversation and otherwise conduct herself with upper-class manners in social situations. This play in turn inspired the 1938 film \"Pygmalion\", as well as the 1956 play \"My Fair Lady\" and the 1964 film \"My Fair Lady\".\n\nThe 2007 film \"Lars and the Real Girl\" tells the story of a man who purchases a doll and treats her as a real person in order to reconnect with the rest of the world. Although she never comes to life, he believes she is real, and in doing so develops more connections to his community. When he no longer needs her, he lets her go. This is a reversal of the myth of Pygmalion.\n\nThe story has been the subject of notable paintings by Agnolo Bronzino, Jean-Léon Gérôme (\"Pygmalion and Galatea\"), Honoré Daumier, Edward Burne-Jones (four major works from 1868–1870, then again in larger versions from 1875–1878 with the title \"Pygmalion and the Image\"), Auguste Rodin, Ernest Normand, Paul Delvaux, Francisco Goya, Franz von Stuck, François Boucher, and Thomas Rowlandson, among others. There have also been numerous sculptures of the \"awakening\".\n\nOvid's Pygmalion has inspired many works of literature, some of which are listed below. The popularity of the Pygmalion myth surged in the 19th century.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough it is not based on the story of Pygmalion, Shakespeare's play \"Measure for Measure\" references Pygmalion in a line spoken by Lucio in Act 3, Scene 2: \"What, is there none of Pygmalion's images, newly made woman, to be had now, for putting the hand in the pocket and extracting it clutch'd?\"\n\nThere have also been successful stage-plays based upon the work, such as W. S. Gilbert's \"Pygmalion and Galatea \" (1871). It was revived twice, in 1884 and in 1888.\n\nIn January, 1872, \"Ganymede and Galatea\" opened at the Gaiety Theatre. This was a comic version of Franz von Suppé's \"Die schöne Galathee\", coincidentally with Arthur Sullivan's brother, Fred Sullivan, in the cast.\n\nIn March 1872, William Brough's 1867 play \"Pygmalion; or, The Statue Fair\" was revived, and in May of that year, a visiting French company produced Victor Massé's \"Galathée\".\n\nIn 1883, the musical burlesque \"Galatea, or Pygmalion Reversed\" was performed at the Gaiety Theatre with a libretto by Henry Pottinger Stephens and W. Webster, and a score composed by Wilhelm Meyer Lutz.\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw's \"Pygmalion\" (1912, staged 1913) owes something to both the Greek Pygmalion and the legend of \"King Cophetua and the beggar maid\"; in which a king lacks interest in women, but one day falls in love with a young beggar-girl, later educating her to be his queen. Shaw's comedy of manners in turn was the basis for the Broadway musical \"My Fair Lady\" (1956), as well as numerous other adaptations.\n\nP. L. Deshpande's play \"Ti Fulrani\" (\"Queen of Flowers\") is also based on Shaw's \"Pygmalion\". The play was a huge success in Marathi theater and has earned many accolades. Madhu Rye adapted \"Pygmalion\" in Gujarati as \"Santu Rangili\" (1976) which was successful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

They were used throughout IBM's second-generation computers, peripherals, the 7000 series, the 1400 series, and the 1620. SMS was superseded by Solid Logic Technology (SLT) introduced with System/360 in 1964, however they remained in use with legacy systems through the 1970s. \n\nMany IBM peripheral devices that are part of System/360, but were adapted from second-generation designs, continued to use SMS circuitry instead of the newer SLT. These included the 240x-series tape drives and controllers, the 2540 card reader/punch and 1403N1 printer, and the 2821 Integrated Control Unit for the 1403 and 2540. A few SMS cards used in System/360 peripheral devices even have SLT-type hybrid ICs mounted on them.\n\nSMS cards are constructed of individual discrete components mounted on single-sided paper-epoxy printed circuit boards. Single-width cards are 2.5 inches wide by 4.5 inches tall by 0.056 inches thick, with a 16-pin gold plated edge connector. Double-width cards are 5.375 inches wide by 4.5 inches tall, with two 16-pin gold plated edge connectors. Contacts are labeled \"A–R\" (skipping \"I\" and \"O\") on the first edge connector, and \"S–Z, 1–8\" on the second.\n\nThe cards are plugged into a card-cage back-plane and edge connector contacts connected to wire wrap pins. All interconnections are made with wire-wrapped connections, except for power bus lines. The back-plane wire-wrap connections were mostly made at the factory with automated equipment, but the wire-wrap technology facilitated field-installation of engineering changes by customer engineers.\n\nSome card types can be customized via a \"program cap\" (a double-rail metal jumper bar with 15 connections) that could be cut to change the circuit configuration. Card types with a \"program cap\" came with it precut for the standard configuration and if a customer engineer needed a different configuration in the field he could make additional cuts as needed. This feature was intended to reduce the number of different card types a customer engineer had to carry with him to the customer's site.\n\nThe card type is a two- to four-letter code embossed on the card (e.g., \"MX, ALQ\"). If the card has a \"program cap\" the code is split into a two-letter card type code and a two-letter \"cap connection\" code (e.g., \"AK ZZ\").\n\nWhen SMS was originally developed, IBM anticipated a set of a couple hundred standard card types would be all that would be needed, making design, manufacture and servicing simpler. Unfortunately that proved far too optimistic as the number of different SMS card types soon grew to well over 2500. Part of the reason for the growth was that multiple digital logic families were implemented (ECL, RTL, DTL, etc.) as well as analog circuits, to meet the requirements of the many different systems in which the cards were used.\n\n"}

Ben Ross\n\nCharles Benjamin Ross (December 27, 1876 – March 31, 1946) was the first Idaho-born Governor of Idaho and an important Idaho political figure throughout the 1930s. Ross served as governor from 1931 until 1937.\n\nOne of eight children, Ross was born to cattleman, John M. Ross, and his wife, Jeanette, near Parma, Idaho. He left school after grade six, but at age eighteen, he decided to continue his education and graduated from Portland Commercial College. In 1897 he returned to the family ranch and co-managed it with his brother, W. H. Ross. He married Edna Reavis on February 14, 1900, and together they raised four foster children.\n\nRoss began his political career in Canyon County, serving as county commissioner from 1915 to 1921. He moved to Bannock County and served as mayor of Pocatello from 1922 to 1930. He won the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1928. Although he nearly tripled the Democratic vote total of his predecessor, Asher B. Wilson, thanks to the recent demise of the Idaho Progressive Party, he was defeated by the Republican incumbent H. C. Baldridge.\n\nRoss won the nomination again in 1930, winning the open seat against Republican John McMurray. His wife, Edna, was a natural politician and a great asset to Ross. She was often referred to as \"Governor Edna\" while he held that office. He was reelected in 1932 and 1934, becoming the first person to win election as Governor of Idaho three times. During his tenure as governor Ross was viewed as the chief proponent of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal policies in Idaho. Even so, his own beliefs more closely mirrored the agrarian populism of earlier Democrats such as William Jennings Bryan.\n\nThe first sales tax in Idaho was enacted in 1935 with Ross' support. A famous line used against Ross by sales tax opponents was \"A Penny for Benny.\" A driver's license law was instituted and legislation was initiated which would make liquor sales regulated through state distributors. Ross ran for United States Senate in 1936 but was defeated by longtime Republican incumbent William E. Borah. Opponents also used the following poem against him: \"Benny got our penny/Benny got our goat/We'll get our Benny/When we go to vote.\" The sales tax was repealed after a statewide referendum in 1936.\n\nIn 1938 Ross ran for governor a fifth time, defeating incumbent Barzilla W. Clark in the Democratic primary but losing to state Republican Party chairman C. A. Bottolfsen in the general election. After losing the 1938 gubernatorial election, \"Cowboy Ben\" retired from public life. He is referred to as \"Founding Father\" of the Idaho Farm Bureau Federation and was looked to as a champion of the Idaho Democratic Party.\n\nRoss died on March 31, 1946, and is interred at Parma Cemetery, Parma, Canyon County, Idaho US.\n\n"}

He batted left-handed and threw right-handed.\n\nHe attended San Diego High School in San Diego, California, where he starred in both baseball and football. He was offered a football scholarship to the University of Arizona as a quarterback, but chose to sign a professional baseball contract. He signed directly with the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League in 1954, and was acquired by the White Sox when they signed a working agreement with the Padres in 1960.\n\nRobinson made his major league debut at age 24 on August 10, 1960 in a 6-0 White Sox home loss to the New York Yankees, starting in right field and going 0-for-3 against Art Ditmar. After batting in double-digit games over a five-week span without a hit, he notched his first career hit on September 18, 1960 in an 8-4 road win over the Detroit Tigers with a sixth-inning single off Jim Bunning. In his next at-bat, he got his first career run-batted-in with a single off Dave Sisler that plated Ted Kluszewski.\n\nRobinson was managed by Hall of Famer Al López, a man he respected a great deal, for most of his seven-year White Sox career. Eddie Stanky managed the 1966 White Sox, which was Robinson's final year with the team. Stanky was known for prickly relationships with his ballplayers.\n\nHis first full year in the majors, 1961, was an outstanding one as he finished tied for third in the American League Rookie of the Year voting. He posted a .310 batting average with 11 home runs, 59 runs batted in, 134 hits and 52 bases on balls.\n\nIn 1962, he finished 10th in the American League MVP voting (Mickey Mantle won) and had 187 hits in 600 at bats for a .312 batting average, third in the league. He led the league in doubles that year with 45, and was fourth in RBIs with 109. On July 22, 1962, Robinson became part of baseball history with six hits (all singles) in six at-bats in a nine-inning game. He is one of only 35 American Leaguers to accomplish the feat.\n\nIn 1964, Robinson came closer to reaching the World Series than he ever would when the White Sox went 98-64, one game behind the 99-63 New York Yankees. It was the second of three straight years that his team finished second in the American League. The White Sox had reached the World Series in 1959, one year before Robinson reached the majors. However, Robinson never played on a team with a losing record.\n\nRobinson's career high in home runs came in 1965 when he hit 14 with 66 RBIs. That was his last major offensive year.\n\nIn December 1966 he was traded to the Reds, for whom he played one season, batting .238 with one home run and 10 RBIs in 55 games. In November 1967 he was traded to the Athletics, for whom he batted .247 with one home run and 14 RBIs in 53 games. On July 31 his contract was purchased by the Red Sox, for whom Robinson played 23 games, including his final career game on September 29, 1968. A knee injury in 1967 had cut short his career.\n\nIn nine major league seasons, Robinson hit .283 with 67 home runs and 426 RBIs. He accumulated 140 doubles, 36 triples, and 42 stolen bases with 458 runs scored. Defensively, in 886 games Robinson committed 30 errors for a .981 fielding percentage.\n\nRobinson is a cousin of former major league outfielder Tommie Reynolds, who played eight years in the majors for five teams from 1963 to 1972.\n\nAfter baseball, Robinson and his wife Sandra, whom he married in 1965, were also business partners, investing in real estate and apartment buildings and a small grocery store. They especially take pride in their building of the Golden Age Garden, a low-income senior citizen apartment complex in San Diego. In 2007, they established the nonprofit Floyd Robinson Foundation.\n\nIn 2009, Robinson was inducted by the San Diego Hall of Champions into the Breitbard Hall of Fame honoring San Diego's finest athletes both on and off the field.\n\n\n, or Retrosheet, or SABR Biography Project\n"}

It is a measure of the average price at which a stock is traded over the trading horizon.\n\nVWAP is often used as a trading benchmark by investors who aim to be as passive as possible in their execution. Many pension funds, and some mutual funds, fall into this category. The aim of using a VWAP trading target is to ensure that the trader executing the order does so in line with volume on the market. It is sometimes argued that such execution reduces transaction costs by minimizing market impact costs (the additional cost due to the market impact, i.e. the adverse effect of a trader's activities on the price of a security).\n\nVWAP can be measured between any two points in time but is displayed as the one corresponding to elapsed time during the trading day by the information provider.\n\nVWAP is often used in algorithmic trading. Indeed, a broker may guarantee execution of an order at the VWAP and have a computer program enter the orders into the market in order to earn the trader's commission and create P&L. This is called a guaranteed VWAP execution. The broker can also trade in a best effort way and answer to the client the realized price. This is called a VWAP target execution; it incurs more dispersion in the answered price compared to the VWAP price for the client but a lower received/paid commission. Trading algorithms that use VWAP as a target belong to a class of algorithms known as \"volume participation algorithms\".\n\nThe first execution of the VWAP was in 1984 for the Ford Motor Company by James Elkins, then head trader at Abel Noser. \n\nVWAP is calculated using the following formula:\n\nwhere:\n\nThe VWAP can be used similar to moving averages, where prices above the VWAP reflect a bullish sentiment and prices below the VWAP reflect a bearish sentiment. Traders may initiate short positions as a stock price moves below VWAP for a given time period or initiate long position as the price moves above VWAP\n\nInstitutional buyers and algorithms will often use VWAP to plan entries and initiate larger positions without disturbing the stock price.\n\nVWAP slippage is the performance of a broker, and many Buy-side firms now use a Mifid wheel to direct their flow to the best broker.\n\n\n"}

Willey\n\nNorman Bushnell Willey (March 25, 1838October 20, 1921) was the second Governor of Idaho from 1890 until 1893.\n\nWilley was born in Guilford, New York, the son of Hiram and Caroline (Church) Willey. He was educated at the Delaware Literary Institute in Franklin, New York. He moved to California at age 20, where he became a gold miner. In 1864, he moved to Warren, Idaho, where he continued to work as a miner and became active in local politics, including service as a member of Idaho County's Board of Commissioners, County Treasurer, and County School Superintendent. Willey also became involved in other business ventures, including owning and operating a sawmill. He later studied law, attained admission to the bar, and practiced in Idaho County.\n\nA Republican, Willey was elected to Idaho's legislative council in 1872, and served until 1873. Elected to another term in 1878, he served until 1889, and was the Council President in 1879. During his legislative career, he was one of the few council members who opposed the effort to reunite North Idaho with Washington State. In 1888, he was defeated for reelection. During his two terms, he became friends with Milton Kelly – a former supreme court justice who had become a prominent newspaper editor. This led to a career in the field of journalism, where his reports as mine superintendent and state correspondent found wide audience.\n\nIn 1890, another opportunity arose for Willey in politics when Idaho gained admission as a state. George Shoup was chosen to serve as governor; however, he only agreed to do so once he was assured that his service would end as governor in late 1890, and that he would then become a United States Senator. Shoup arranged Willey's election as Lieutenant Governor, which ensured that he would succeed to the governorship after Shoup resigned.\n\nDuring his tenure, Willey oversaw the Idaho government's transition from territorial to state, from creation of state agencies to the design for a state seal. He also dealt with a labor-management strike between miners and mine owners in the Coeur D'Alene region, ultimately declaring martial law, and calling in both the militia and federal troops. Willey continued to serve as governor until 1893; he lost renomination in 1892 to William J. McConnell, who went on to win the general election.\n\nAfter leaving office, Willey accepted a position as a mine superintendent in Blue Canyon, California. He never married or had children, and after several business reverses he moved to Topeka, Kansas to live with relatives.\n\nIn his later years, Willey became a resident of Shawnee County's poorhouse, and the state of Idaho eventually appropriated $1,200 as an unofficial pension to assist him in his old age. He died in Topeka on October 20, 1921, and was buried at Auburn Cemetery in Auburn, Kansas.\n\n"}

Its provincial capital is the town of Mendi. According to Papua New Guinea's national 2011 census, the total population of Southern Highlands (after the separation of Hela Province) is 515,511 spread across .\n\nBefore the split there were two major ethnic groups, the Huli Speakers and the Angal Speakers or Angal Heneng. Today the majority of the population in Southern Highlands is made up of Angal or Angal Heneng speakers. They occupy the three provinces of Southern Highlands (Nipa, Mendi, Lai Valley, Imbongu (lower Mendi)), Hela (Magarima) and Enga (parts of Kandep).\n\nIn July 2009, Parliament passed legislation to create two new provinces by 2012. One of these was to be created by removing the districts of Tari-Pori, Komo-Magarima, and Koroba-Kopiago from the Southern Highlands Province to form the new Hela Province. Hela Province officially came into being on 17 May 2012.\n\nAfter the split of Hela, the province is divided into roughly three distinct geographic regions:\n\n\nThere are five districts in the province. Each district has one or more Local Level Government (LLG) areas. For census purposes, the LLG areas are subdivided into wards and those into census units.\n\nThe province was governed by a decentralised provincial administration, headed by a Premier, from 1978 to 1995. Following reforms taking effect that year, the national government reassumed some powers, and the role of Premier was replaced by a position of Governor, to be held by the winner of the province-wide seat in the National Parliament of Papua New Guinea.\n\nThe province and each district is represented by a Member of the National Parliament. There is one provincial electorate and each district is an open electorate.\n\nOn 1 August 2006, the government of Papua New Guinea declared a state of emergency in the country's Southern Highlands region. According to Prime Minister Sir Michael Somare, troops were deployed to restore 'law, order and good governance' in the region, following accusations of corruption, theft and misuse of government buildings at the hands of the regional government.\n\nAs a region rich in energy resources, the Southern Highlands was at the centre of plans to construct a gas pipeline to pump natural gas to Queensland in north Australia. The project would have resulted in much needed revenue for Papua New Guinea, and as it was believed that the instability in the region could jeopardise the project, the national government decided to intervene by declaring a state of emergency. The move was supported by Parliament, although some criticism was leveled at the government for restricting press access to the region while the state of emergency was in force. The companies involved subsequently opted for the current PNG Gas project which has export facilities outside Port Moresby. This is operated by Esso Highlands, a subsidiary of Exxon Mobil Corporation, and is expected to begin production in 2014.\n"}
{"id": "1869157", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1869157", "title": "Larry Zbyszko", "text": "Larry Zbyszko\n\nLawrence Whistler (born December 5, 1951), better known by the ring name Larry Zbyszko, is an American retired professional wrestler and author perhaps best known for his feud with his mentor, Bruno Sammartino, during the early 1980s. Among other accolades, he is a two-time AWA World Heavyweight Champion, and the final titleholder.\n\nZbyszko was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame on March 28, 2015.\n\nWhistler trained under Bruno Sammartino after cutting his collegiate wrestling career at Penn State University short. He debuted in 1973 as the babyface \"Larry Zbyszko\", with his name a tribute to 1920s Polish American wrestler Stanislaus Zbyszko. He initially wrestled in the Pittsburgh area, appearing on the local wrestling program \"Studio Wrestling\", before receiving bookings in Vancouver. He spent three years in the World Wide Wrestling Federation before traveling to California in 1975.\n\nZbyszko was one of the attractions in the 1976 Latin America Wrestling Alliance World Heavyweight championship, held in Guatemala City, under Jose Azzari promotions. Three days after the end of the tournament (Mil Máscaras won the title, defeating Jose Azzari in the final), an earthquake destroyed much of that Central American nation.\n\nZbyszko returned to the WWWF in 1976 and formed a tag team with Tony Garea, with whom he won the WWWF World Tag Team Championships on November 21, 1978 in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Their reign lasted until March 6, 1979, when they were defeated by the Valiant brothers in Allentown.\n\nZbyszko feuded with Bugsy McGraw, Abdullah the Butcher and Superstar Billy Graham in addition to wrestling Killer Kowalski and Baron Mikel Scicluna. In 1978 he summarized his mat-based ringwork with the statement, \"I just believe in science over brawn\".\n\nAt the end of the decade, Zbyszko became frustrated with his inability to shed his label as Bruno Sammartino's protégé. He challenged Sammartino to an exhibition match, claiming this was the only way he could step out of Sammartino's shadow. Sammartino eventually agreed to the match after Zbyszko threatened to retire if he was not granted the match. The trainer and pupil faced one another in Allentown on January 22, 1980, with Sammartino dominating the early stages of the match. After Sammartino threw him out of the ring, an irate Zbyszko seized a wooden chair and struck Sammartino, leaving him in a pool of blood in the middle of the ring and instantly turning Zbyszko into a reviled heel. So despised was Zbyszko by partisan Sammartino fans in the northeast that his car was repeatedly damaged and taxis in which he was traveling were overturned by fans. Zbyszko was struck with an iron pole following a match with Ivan Putski, and was stabbed in the buttock following a match with Pedro Morales in the Washington Avenue Armory in Albany, New York. After turning against Sammartino, Zbyszko was approached by the WWWF's \"Unholy Trio\" of managers (Fred Blassie, The Grand Wizard, and \"Captain\" Lou Albano), but he decided to continue wrestling without a manager. Sammartino and Zbyszko fought one another repeatedly in a lengthy feud that stretched throughout 1980. In the course of the feud, Zbyszko began referring to himself as \"The New Living Legend\" (a reference to Sammartino, who was often addressed as \"The Living Legend\"). The feud culminated in a steel cage match at Showdown at Shea at Shea Stadium in Flushing, New York on August 9, 1980 that saw Sammartino defeat Zbyszko in front of an audience of 36,295.\n\nZbyszko left the WWF in 1981 and feuded with Bruno's son David Sammartino on the independent circuit. He eventually joined the Georgia Championship Wrestling territory of the National Wrestling Alliance, where he began claiming to have retired Bruno Sammartino (Sammartino had retired from full-time competition in 1981). Zbyszko initially feuded with Tim Woods and Paul Orndorff, whom he was unable to defeat for the NWA National Heavyweight Championship. After Killer Tim Brooks defeated Orndorff for the title on March 20, 1983, Zybszko immediately offered him US$25,000 for the title, which Brooks accepted. His reign lasted until April 30 of that year, when NWA President Bob Geigel stripped Zbyszko of the title due to the manner in which he had acquired it. A tournament was held for the vacant title, which Zbyszko entered. He defeated Mr. Wrestling II in the tournament final on May 6, 1983 in Atlanta, Georgia to regain the title. His second reign lasted until September 25, 1983, when he lost to Brett Wayne in Atlanta.\n\nIn March 1984, Zbyszko joined the Minneapolis, Minnesota-based American Wrestling Association. He was awarded the newly created AWA America's Championship in January 1985, and engaged in a lengthy feud with Sgt. Slaughter, who defeated him for the title on June 21, 1985 in Chicago, Illinois. Throughout the feud, Zbyszko drew the ire of fans by fleeing the ring and stalling for minutes at a time whenever Slaughter gained an advantage (in an April 2004 interview, Zbyszko claimed that the longest he ever stalled for was sixteen minutes).\n\nZbyszko feuded with Nick Bockwinkel throughout 1986, losing to him in a Texas death match at \"Rage in a Cage\" on April 28, 1986. In the course of the feud, he also vied with Bockwinkel's ally Ray Stevens and boxer Scott LeDoux. Zybszko lost to LeDoux in a boxing match at WrestleRock '86 on April 20, 1986 and fought him to a double count out at \"Battle by the Bay\" on June 28, 1986.\n\nOn May 2, 1987, Zbyszko helped Curt Hennig defeat Nick Bockwinkel for the AWA World Heavyweight Championship by handing him a roll of dimes to knock Bockwinkel out with. He was suspended \"for life\" by the AWA as a result of an assault on Bockwinkel during Bockwinkel's rematch with Hennig in July 1987. As Bockwinkel retired shortly after the incident, Zbyszko began claiming to have retired both Bockwinkel and Bruno Sammartino.\n\nIn November 1987, Zbyszko joined Jim Crockett Promotions, where he was managed by Baby Doll. He began feuding with Barry Windham, and on January 24, 1988 in Uniondale, New York he defeated Windham for the NWA Western States Heritage Championship. After Baby Doll left Zbyszko he gained a new manager in Gary Hart, who placed him in a tag team with Al Perez. Perez and Zbyszko feuded with Kendall Windham and Dustin Rhodes.\n\nIt was also during this time that Hart was asking for NWA World Title shots for both Zbyszko and Perez. It was claimed by Hart and even announcer Jim Ross that Zbyszko and Perez both had the ability to beat Flair for the title, but neither received title shots and the NWA quickly dropped the overtures. Crockett Promotions was under new ownership and both Zbyszko and Perez were essentially left without an angle. Zbyszko signed with the AWA in January 1989 and the NWA Western States Heritage Championship, which Zbyszko still held at that point, was subsequently retired.\n\nZbyszko took part in an eighteen-man battle royal in Saint Paul, Minnesota on February 7, 1989 to fill the vacant AWA World Heavyweight Championship. By stalling and avoiding confrontations with other wrestlers, Zbyszko was able to remain in the match until only two men remained: himself and Tom Zenk. The two men fought for several minutes. When Zenk went for a pin, referee Gary DeRusha inexplicably entered the ring to make the count. Zbyszko kicked out and the two continued in what now appeared to be a conventional wrestling match. DeRusha ended up taking a bump and was unable to make the three count when Zenk covered Zbyszko for the pin. As DeRusha slowly recovered, Zenk continued to dominate the match. As he attempted a flying body press, however, Zbyszko managed to catch him in mid-air and deliver a fallaway slam, throwing him over the top rope and to the ground below. Zbyszko was thus the new AWA World Heavyweight Champion.\n\nEarly in his title reign, Zbyszko would feud with Wahoo McDaniel and Sgt. Slaughter. He would face Greg Gagne on June 23, 1989 at War in the Windy City, and David Sammartino, who he defeated at the \"Tri-State Winter Challenge\" on January 27, 1990. He then began feuding with Mr. Saito, who defeated him for the AWA World Heavyweight Championship on February 10, 1990 at Super Fight In Tokyo Dome during a tour of Japan. Zbyszko regained the title at SuperClash 4 on April 8, 1990, in Saint Paul and successfully defended it against The Trooper, Brad Rheingans, and Nikita Koloff (who he defeated on May 5, 1990 at Twin Wars '90) toward the end of his reign. He was stripped of the title after leaving the AWA for World Championship Wrestling on December 12, 1990, and the AWA declared bankruptcy in 1991, making Zbyszko the last man to reign as AWA World Heavyweight Champion.\n\nIn December 1990, Zbyszko returned to the NWA. Zbyszko initially teamed with Terrence Taylor, a member of The York Foundation, but was not recruited to the stable. Zbyszko was paired with Arn Anderson as the Enforcers in the late summer of 1991. After Scott Steiner, one-half of the World Tag Team Champions, was injured, the titles were vacated on July 18, 1991, and placed on the line in an eight-man tag team tournament. The tournament finals were held on September 5, 1991 at \"\" and pitted the Enforcers against Rick Steiner and Bill Kazmeier. At the outset of the event, the Enforcers struck Kazmeier with a weight during a weightlifting demonstration, injuring his ribs. This enabled them to defeat Steiner and Kazmeier for the titles in the main event.\n\nAt Halloween Havoc, The Enforcers began feuding with Barry Windham and Dustin Rhodes, and broke Windham's hand by slamming the door of his car on his hand. Following this act, Zbyszko gave himself the sobriquet the \"Cruncher\". Windham was replaced by Ricky Steamboat, and at \"Clash of the Champions XVII\" on November 19, 1991 in Savannah, Georgia, the Enforcers lost the titles to Steamboat and Rhodes.\n\nIn December 1991, the Enforcers joined Paul E. Dangerously's Dangerous Alliance, which also included Rick Rude, \"Stunning\" Steve Austin, Bobby Eaton and Madusa. They feuded with Ricky Steamboat, Dustin Rhodes, Barry Windham, Nikita Koloff, Sting and the WCW World Heavyweight Champion Ron Simmons. On May 17, 1992 at \"WrestleWar 1992: WarGames\", the Dangerous Alliance lost a WarGames match to their rivals after Zbyszko accidentally hit Eaton in the arm with the turnbuckle that he had dismantled, forcing Eaton to submit as a result of the pain. As a result of his blunder, Zbyszko was fired from the stable by Dangerously, turning him into a face for the first time since 1980. He briefly feuded with Austin and Eaton before retiring from full-time competition to become a color commentator. One of his first appearances as a commentator occurred at Starrcade alongside of Missy Hyatt. As a commentator, Zbyszko began referring to himself simply as \"The Living Legend\", as many WCW fans were unfamiliar with his feud with Bruno Sammartino. He also hosted an interview segment, \"Larry Z's Legends\" on WCW television which only lasted a few weeks.\n\nIn March 1994, Zbyszko began hosting \"WCW Pro\", alongside Dusty Rhodes and Gordon Solie. Shortly thereafter, Lord Steven Regal began harassing Zbyszko, prompting him to return to the ring. On May 2, 1994 in Atlanta, Zbyszko defeated Regal for the WCW World Television Championship. He held the title until June 23, 1994 when Regal regained the belt in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nIn 1996, Zbyszko was promoted to the \"WCW Monday Nitro\" broadcast team, where he announced during the first hour with Tony Schiavone. In 1997, he was antagonized by New World Order (nWo) member Scott Hall, but Hall opted not to face Zbyszko. Zbyszko remained in the broadcast booth for most of 1997, occasionally refereeing matches involving Hall and the nWo. On October 13, 1997, Zbyszko got involved in a WCW Tag Team Championship match between the Steiner Brothers and Scott Hall and Syxx (subbing for an injured Kevin Nash) and counted the ensuing fall for the Steiner Brothers who became the champions. This reign was official despite Zbyszko not being an official referee, a role he previously played in Scott Hall's match against Lex Luger at Halloween Havoc (1997). On December 28, 1997 at \"StarrCade 1997\", Zbyszko returned to the ring for a match against Bischoff for control of \"WCW Monday Nitro\" with Bret Hart acting as special referee. Hart ensured that the nWo did not interfere, and Zbyszko won the match, regaining control of \"Nitro\" for WCW. He continued to feud with Hall and his lackey, Louie Spicolli, culminating in a match between Zbyszko and Hall at \"Souled Out 1998\" on January 24, 1998. Zbyszko won the match by disqualification after Dusty Rhodes betrayed him, joining the nWo.\n\nZbyszko went back to commentating, becoming part of the main \"Thunder\" announce team in April along with Mike Tenay, leaving \"Nitro\". On December 6, 1999, when he faced Curt Hennig in a retirement match on \"Nitro\" and lost. He returned in January 2000 as a member of the Old Age Outlaws with Terry Funk, Arn Anderson and Paul Orndorff to feud with the revived nWo, then returned to commentary in February until he was released from his WCW contract in late 2000.\n\nAfter being released from World Championship Wrestling Zbyszko was rumored to be the replacement for Jerry Lawler as the commentator for \"Monday Night Raw\" in early 2001 after Lawler quit the company. Zbyszko did an interview with Live Audio Wrestling saying he wanted the job. These rumors never materialized as Paul Heyman would go on to become the color commentator for \"Monday Night Raw\" until Jerry Lawler returned to the company later that year.\n\nIn 2001 Zbyszko wrestled several matches for Dusty Rhodes's Turnbuckle Championship Wrestling promotion.\n\nIn late 2001, Zbyszko requested that World Wrestling Entertainment cease referring to Chris Jericho as \"The Living Legend\", claiming that this infringed upon his common law trademark. After WWF refused to comply, with chairman Vince McMahon personally addressing Jericho as \"The Living Legend\" during a televised broadcast, Zbyszko launched a lawsuit against WWF. In addition, he challenged McMahon to a shoot fight during a 2002 World Wrestling All-Stars pay-per-view.\n\nIn 2002, Zbyszko had a short feud with Chris Harris in the Nashville, Tennessee-based USA Championship Wrestling promotion. On March 2, 2002, Zbyszko defeated Harris for the USA North American Heavyweight Championship. He held the title until March 30, 2002 when Harris regained the belt at the \"Tojo Yamamoto Memorial Show\". On August 27, 2005 at WrestleReunion in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, Zbyszko faced Diamond Dallas Page, with the provision that he would receive five minutes alone in the ring with the sixty-nine-year-old Bruno Sammartino if he won. Page knocked Zbyszko out with his signature Diamond Cutter, however, then pulled Zbyszko on top of him, thus giving him the win by pinfall. Sammartino then entered the ring and began throttling the still-prone Zbyszko until he was dragged away.\n\nZbyszko debuted in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling on January 15, 2003 and delivered a speech in which he exhorted the roster to respect tradition. This sparked a feud with A.J. Styles, who was not receptive to Zbyszko's requests. On January 29, 2003 Zbyszko faced Styles in a ten-minute-long match with the stipulation that, should Styles be unable to pin him twice in that time, he would become Styles's manager. Styles was only able to pin Zbyszko once, and Zbyszko managed him for a short time before booker Vince Russo cancelled the angle and Zbyszko left the promotion. He returned for one night on August 6, 2003, losing to Kid Kash following interference from Abyss.\n\nZbyszko made a full-time return to TNA on June 23, 2004, assisting Ron Killings in his feud with Jeff Jarrett. On July 14, 2004, Killings, Zbyszko, Dusty Rhodes, Konnan and B.G. James defeated Jarrett, Ken Shamrock and \"The Elite Guard\" (Shawn Hernandez, Chad Collyer and Onyx) in a \"ten-man guitar on a pole match\".\n\nAlong with Harley Race and Terry Funk, Zbyszko was appointed to a body known as the Championship Committee. The Committee would watch matches on \"TNA Impact!\", most of which had a ten-minute time limit, and determine a winner in the eventuality of a draw. As on practise few professional wrestling matches end in a draw, the Committee was gradually phased out.\n\nIn February 2005, Zbyszko joined Planet Jarrett, Jarrett's dominant heel stable. He disappeared several weeks later.\n\nOn June 19, 2005, at TNA Slammiversary 2005, the returning Zbyszko was named Director of Authority, replacing Dusty Rhodes. His first act as DOA was to give Jeff Jarrett's place in the King of the Mountain match later that night to Raven. At TNA Sacrifice 2005 on August 14, Zbyszko responded to Jarrett's request for a shot at the NWA World Heavyweight Championship by informing him that he would receive a title shot if he won his tag team match that night, but would be banned from receiving a title shot for a year if he lost the match. As Jarrett's partner, Rhino, won the match, neither stipulation was applicable.\n\nZbyszko remained neutral for several months, but in October 2005 he became exasperated with Raven, who continually accused him of robbing the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and refusing to grant him a rematch. At TNA Genesis 2005 on November 13, Zbyszko told Raven to resign from TNA or have his life \"made hell\". After Raven refused to resign, Zbyszko forced him to wrestle P.J. Polaco. Much to Zbysko's chagrin, Raven defeated Polaco. Nevertheless, Zbyszko continued his personal crusade against Raven, and to that end booked him into a Raven's House of Fun Match, again with an unknown opponent, for the December 3 episode of \"Impact!\". The opponent turned out to be the entire Diamonds in the rough stable (Simon Diamond, Elix Skipper, and David Young). Despite interference from Cassidy Riley on Raven's behalf, he was pinned and lost the match.\n\nRaven went on to defeat his former tag team partner Chris K. at TNA Turning Point 2005. At Final Resolution 2006 on January 15, 2006, Raven was scheduled to face a mystery opponent, with the stipulation that he would receive a shot at the NWA World Heavyweight Championship if he was victorious, but would be fired if he was defeated. Raven lost to the returning Sean Waltman after Zbyszko, who refereed the match after the original referee was knocked unconscious, distracted Raven so that Waltman could deliver a X Factor and then counted to three despite Raven placing his foot on a ring rope. Following the match, Zbyszko ordered the TNA security to escort Raven from \"my arena\", then mocked Raven until he was confronted by Jackie Gayda about an undisclosed issue.\n\nAt TNA Lockdown 2006 on April 23, 2006, the debuting Christy Hemme handed commentator Mike Tenay an envelope containing a message from \"TNA management\" stating that Zbyszko had been placed on probation due to his conduct, while Raven had been reinstated. Raven then entered the arena and approached the ring, causing Zbyszko to evade him until he was removed by security guards. At TNA Victory Road 2006 on July 17, 2006, Zbyszko lost to Raven in a hair versus hair match. On the October 5 edition of iMPACT he booked a match where the man who was pinned would be fired. He interfered in the match after he hit Eric Young with a golf club. Jim Cornette booked a match at Bound for Glory between him and Young where the loser would be fired. He would then go on to lose the match to Eric Young at Bound for Glory, he was fired a week later.\n\nZbyszko returned to the independent circuit and claimed the AWA Superstars of Wrestling World Heavyweight Championship in AWA Superstars of Wrestling. Zbyszko started rallying for what he claimed was rightfully his since mid-2007. The situation heated up immediately after the then AWA Superstars of Wrestling board of directors stripped Masato Tanaka of the World's title. Zbyszko, through his newly named \"representative\" Mister Saint Laurent and legal representation, started filing documentation, to the new AWA Superstars of Wrestling Management Team, proving he had never lost the title in 1991 when Verne Gagne's American Wrestling Association entered into bankruptcy. After considerable deliberation and review of the bankruptcy file from the early 1990s, the AWA agreed with Zbyszko that he did indeed never actually lose the title. Accordingly, Zbyszko was once again the recognized AWA Superstars of Wrestling World Heavyweight Championship. He lost the title to Brian Logan. Logan defeated Larry Zbyszko and Ricky Landell in a three-way match on April 18, 2008 at a Mountaineer Wrestling Association event in Fayetteville, West Virginia.\n\nOn March 22, 2008, Larry was inducted into the XWF Hall of Fame by its creator Jack Blaze at their \"XWF March Madness 2008\" event. XWF was later renamed LPW (Legends Pro Wrestling) where Larry is still honored in their Hall of Fame- Class 2008.\n\nFour Territories of the AWA Superstars of Wrestling have broken away from AWA Superstars of Wrestling, however, and joined with Championship Wrestling of Tennessee to create the American Wrestling Affiliates. Brian Logan took his championship reign and belt with him and Zbyszko is once again recognized as the AWA Superstars World Heavyweight Champion as AWA Superstars of Wrestling retroactively refused to recognize the title change. He dropped the title to Ricky Landell on October 11.\n\nIn 2009, Full Impact Pro hired Zbyszko as the executive director of the FIP Championship committee.\n\nZbyszko competed at the ROH show on January 29 as a part of Wrestle Reunion 4 where he had a match with Scotty 2 Hotty.\n\nIn March 2010 Zbyszko started appearing at live events for the WFX Wrestling|WFX in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Shortly after his debut, he was named the interim commissioner of the promotion, and makes regular appearances. He competed in one match for the promotion thus far, teaming with Jessie Godderz, to compete against Bushwacker Luke and Eugene Dinsmore.\n\nZbyszko defeated Palmer Canon for the All Out Mayhem Heavyweight Championship on November 20, 2010, in South Portland, Maine.\nIn late March 2011, it was noted that Chris Jericho was very critical of Zbyszko and his announcing capabilities during his tenure in WCW in his latest book. When this was brought to his attention, Larry proceeded to challenge Jericho to say it to his face, and questioned his manhood in a popular internet video. Zbyszko stated in another video that the reason for Jericho's disrespect was because he could not use the phrase \"The Living Legend\" in the WWE because it has been used and trademarked by Zbyszko. On March 17, 2012, In Caribou, Maine Zbyszko defeated Ryan Michaels in a lumberjack match to retain the All Out Mayhem Heavyweight Championship. He would lose the title a month later to Gino Martino in Gray, Maine.\n\nIn April 2013, after attending the WWE Hall of Fame ceremony, he announced he had signed a WWE Legends contract along with recording interviews for the WWE Network and future DVD releases. He is a regular at NXT TV tapings in Orlando and has appeared at WrestleMania Axxess in recent years. On March 16, 2015, it was announced he would be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2015. On March 28 he was inducted by his former mentor and rival Bruno Sammartino.\n\nHe married Kathleen Gagne (Daughter of AWA co-founder Verne Gagne and sister of wrestler Greg Gagne) in 1988, and has a son who is also a professional wrestler: Tim Zbyszko. He has three other sons; Michael, John and Robert.\n\nLarry Zbyszko's book, \"Adventures In Larryland\", was released on June 1, 2008.\n\nZybszko has appeared in \"WWE 2K16\" (as DLC) and \"WWE 2K17\" as a member of The Enforcers with Arn Anderson, and in \"WWE 2K18\" without Anderson.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1869171", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1869171", "title": "William J. McConnell", "text": "William J. McConnell\n\nWilliam John McConnell (September 18, 1839March 30, 1925) was the third Governor of Idaho from 1893 until 1897. He had previously represented the new state as one of its first United States Senators; Idaho achieved statehood in July 1890.\n\nBorn in Michigan and educated in its public schools, McConnell headed west as a freight wagon driver and ended up in California. There, he found work where he could get it: miner, store clerk, cowboy, and teacher. In 1862, he moved to Oregon, where he taught school, and then followed the gold rush into the Idaho Territory the following year.\n\nPerhaps based on his earlier experience in California, McConnell spotted opportunity on the way to the gold fields around Idaho City. Rather than joining the throngs of prospectors, he and two other men claimed some good farmland near Horseshoe Bend. He and the others dug the first significant irrigation ditch along the Payette River and began raising vegetables. The following year, McConnell led a pack train loaded with produce over the mountains to Placerville and sold them at \"fabulous\" prices.\n\nAt the time, Idaho Territory was about a year old and law enforcement was scant to non-existent. When he and other settlers along the Payette began to lose horses and mules to thieves, the youthful McConnell took the lead in organizing a Vigilance committee for the region. While it did not end crime in the area, the work of the committee did reduce it and, according to the \"Illustrated History\", \"The farmers had no further trouble with horse thieves.\" McConnell later published a history of the period, which included a lengthy account of the vigilantes' work. He offered no apologies and asked for no forgiveness … but simply described what he saw as the necessity for what was done.\nAlthough, or perhaps because, McConnell was the recognized leader of the vigilantes, in 1865 he was appointed a Deputy U.S. Marshal for Idaho Territory. At the end of his two-year term, he returned to California.\n\nIn about 1867, McConnell married Louisa Brown and their first child was born in California, where he owned (or worked in) a general store and raised cattle. About 1871, the family moved to Oregon, where they eventually settled in Yamhill County. There, McConnell owned a general store and ran cattle. In 1882, he was elected to the state senate, and was then selected as the senate president.\n\nAround 1879, McConnell had begun investing in the growing town of Moscow, Idaho, and in 1884 he moved his family there. The general store he opened with a partner in Moscow was for many years considered the finest in the region. When leaders convened a constitutional convention, preparatory to Idaho statehood, McConnell represented Latah County.\n\nAfter Idaho became at state on July 3, 1890, McConnell was one of its first U.S. Senators. He served only a short term, which was meant to get the state \"in sync\" with a normal election cycle. For a time, the new state actually had three Senators-elect: McConnell, Fred Dubois, and \"Judge\" William Clagett. The Senate had to vote on which of the two besides McConnell they would seat – they chose Dubois.\n\nMcConnell's term ended in March 1891, and he decided to run for governor as the candidate for the Republican Party. In a state-level reflection of political turmoil across the country, he won with only a plurality (40.6%) of the vote: candidates for the Democratic and Populist parties split 58% of the rest. A Prohibition Party candidate polled about 1.3%. When he ran for re-election, he won in a similar manner, polling 41.5% of the votes with the Democrats and Populists splitting most of the remaining votes.\nAfter his first gubernatorial election, McConnell ended his involvement with the store in Moscow and moved to Boise. There, in 1895, his daughter Mary (or sometimes Mamie) married attorney William E. Borah (1865-1940), who was elected to six terms in the U.S. Senate (1907–40). Mary lived until 1976, to the advanced age of 105 years.\n\nAlong with Willis Sweet, McConnell was at the forefront of the movement to locate the University of Idaho in Moscow. A residence hall built in 1957 was named for him.\n\nTaking office in 1893 as a minority candidate did not smooth McConnell's task as Idaho's third governor. (The first governor, George L. Shoup, resigned after serving just a few months before being elected for a full term as a U.S. Senator.) Having been so recently granted statehood, Idaho had to work out many details of how the state would be governed. Thus, many problems landed on his desk.\n\nUnder McConnell's administrations, Idaho did away with a \"test oath\" whose effect was to disenfranchise the state's considerable body of Mormon voters. Also, the state was the fourth to grant women the right to vote, in 1896.\nThe state also initiated the infrastructure needed to administer irrigation projects eligible for Carey Act consideration. Several years would pass before a complete and effective system could be put in place, but Idaho eventually became the single greatest success story under the Act.\n\nDuring his tenure, the state suffered – along with the nation – through the severe depression called the Panic of 1893, when several major railroads and over 500 banks failed. \nThe economic crisis naturally exacerbated the conflict between labor unions and companies, especially in the silver mines in the Coeur d'Alene region of North Idaho. The crisis in Idaho deepened with the repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act – the Federal government was no longer required to purchase a set monthly amount of silver. The resulting crash in prices squeezed the mining companies, leading to layoffs and moves to cut wages. The subsequent unrest, and flare-ups of violence, led McConnell to threaten the use of troops to keep the peace.\n\nMcConnell did not run for a third term, perhaps realizing that his mainstream Republican Party was going to lose badly. McConnell was himself a \"Free Silver\" supporter, but refused to abandon the Party over one divisive issue. As expected, a coalition of Democrats, Populists, and Silver-Republicans swept the 1896 state elections; mainstream Republicans retained only one seat in the legislature.\n\nFortunately for McConnell, Republican William McKinley handily beat William Jennings Bryan, the Democratic/Populist candidate for president. As a reward for his party loyalty, he received an appointment in the Bureau of Indian Affairs, a position he held until 1901. Later, he served as an Immigration Service Inspector from 1909 until his death in 1925.\n\nMcConnell's memorial service in Moscow was held at the auditorium (of the administration building) at the University of Idaho, which included most of the states's dignitaries. He and his wife Louisa (1846–1930) are buried in the Moscow Cemetery.\n\n"}

{"id": "1869188", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1869188", "title": "Trigon (comics)", "text": "Trigon (comics)\n\nTrigon () is a fictional supervillain published by DC Comics. He is one of the most powerful beings in the DC Universe, along with Darkseid, Neron, Barbatos, Hades, the Anti-Monitor, Nekron, and the Great Evil Beast, having enslaved many worlds. He is the archenemy of the Teen Titans, Justice League, and all other superheroes father of the superhero Raven, and husband of Arella.\n\nSeamus Dever portrayed the disguised human version of Trigon in the \"Titans\" television series, a DC Universe streaming service exclusive. His real form was revealed as a red demon with horns and four eyes and he does not have bat-like wings and/or a tail.\n\nTrigon first appeared in a cameo in \"New Teen Titans\" #2 (December 1980) and his first full appearance is \"New Teen Titans\" #4. He was created by Marv Wolfman and George Pérez.\n\nA sadistic, cruel, dangerous, and powerful demon of inter-dimensional origin, Trigon is a result of the mating between a female member of a mystic sect and the god they worshipped. A side effect of this pairing is that their child was filled with the cast-off evil energies of the inhabitants of Azarath, forming him into their personification. At birth, Trigon killed everyone around him (including his own mother), at the age of one, he ruled an entire planet, at the age of six, he destroyed an entire planet, and by the age of 30, he held dominion over millions of worlds in his dimension. There is some confusion regarding the origins of Trigon, as he claims to have existed as formless energy since the beginning of his own universe, while the energies cast off by Azar and Azarath simply allowed him to take physical form roughly a thousand years before DC's present day.\n\nArella was a depressed woman who decided to join a cult known as the Church of Blood that was trying to kill Trigon. When the ritual was performed, Trigon, disguised as a handsome male, emerged and married Arella. After making love, Arella discovered Trigon's true nature after seeing his true form. Trigon sends Arella back to Earth, and Arella is pregnant and on the brink of suicide when she is found by an extra-dimensional cult and is brought to Azarath, where she gives birth to their daughter Raven. Raven is brought up to \"control her emotions\" in order to suppress and control the demonic powers she inherited from Trigon. During this time, Trigon was aware of his daughter's whereabouts, but rarely intervened, except when a renegade monk named Juris attempted to cast Raven as an infant into another dimension to avert her potential threat; Trigon struck him down at the moment of the deed, and allowed the cult to keep her safe at present.\n\nRaven learned of Trigon's intentions to conquer the Earth and vowed to stop him; she initially approached the Justice League, but they refused her on the advice of Zatanna, who sensed her demonic parentage. In desperation, she reformed the Teen Titans with several new members in order to fight her father. The team was eventually able to defeat Trigon and seal him in an interdimensional prison. However, Raven still had to fight her father's influence as he was not completely destroyed. \n\nTrigon eventually escaped and came to Earth, taking control of Raven and destroying Azarath in the process. The Titans came together and tried to fight Trigon, but were contaminated by his demonic influence and killed Raven; this allowed the souls of Azarath to possess her and use her as a channel to kill Trigon—the demonic possession had been part of a plan to defeat Trigon, as the Titans would never have killed Raven on their own—blasting him out of existence with a beam of purifying light. Although Trigon is gone, his followers (led by Brother Blood) have tried to revive him several times.\n\nRaven notices that Trigon has returned and is responsible for the recent attacks on past and present members of the Teen Titans. The cause of his resurrection from the dead has not been revealed, but the motive for these renewed attack is that a war with rival demons has spread Trigon's forces too thinly and left him desperately weak, which forces him to turn his focus on Earth in hopes of creating a new power base.\n\nThree of Trigon's sons, Jacob, Jared and Jesse, play a significant role in his return to life. The brothers have the ability to induce the seven deadly sins in any living being: they can induce wrath (Jared), lust (Jacob) and envy (Jesse). They attempt to open the portal to Trigon's realm, but then betray their father and steal what little power he has left; this actually makes Trigon proud of them for proving to be just as evil as he is. The trio leave, thinking they have gained great power, and Trigon is left trapped in his realm. However, the three brothers then return and corrupt their half-sister, making her their ally. Eventually, they are defeated by Raven and the Titans.\n\nIn September 2011, \"The New 52\" rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Trigon makes his post-\"Flashpoint\" debut in issue #1 of the \"Phantom Stranger\". In this incarnation, Trigon has an extra set of eyes, giving him six in total. He has struck a bargain with the Stranger to return his offspring Raven (living under the assumed name of Rachel Roth) to him; in return, he pledges to spare Earth from his armies that were ready to search the Earth for her, having already destroyed Azarath years ago. In \"The New 52\", it is revealed that Trigon has at least four children, where Raven is the youngest. Her older brothers are named Belial, Ruskoff, and Suge; Belial is the oldest and most civilized, according to himself, of the three brothers.\n\nLater, Trigon returns to Earth, feeling confident in having swayed Raven to his side during their time together in his demonic realm, where time flows differently. Trigon is shown to be the ruler of six kingdoms known as the Under-Realms, a collective title for the planets and dimensions he conquered, although he has since grown bored with the dull responsibilities of ruling them. At first, he ruled through his own power, then through conquest on the battlefield and finally through subterfuge. His ultimate goal is to unite all seven realms and pass the mantle of leadership to Raven, whom he believes will mold them all in her own image, something only she can do as she has the capacity to love, an emotion Trigon cannot feel or comprehend.\n\nAs part of DC Villains Month, Trigon replaced the Teen Titans as the main characters in their book for one issue named #23.1, with Deathstroke taking over #23.2. The Teen Titans book resumed publishing after Villains Month concluded. Though unconfirmed, the Villains Month event leaves Trigon's origins in question. Long ago, in another universe, a trinity of beings called the Divine attempted to eradicate the concept of evil through an item known as the Heart of Darkness. When the Divine return to a world they believed liberated, they find it in utter chaos along with the being they believe to be responsible, only because he appears not to be one of the planet's inhabitants. As they had done billions of times before, they sentence him and his two guards to the Heart of Darkness, hoping that it would consume the evil within them. However, they were horrified when the stranger not only resisted but consumed the Heart of Darkness, absorbing the evils of a billion worlds, and mutating into the being that would become known as Trigon. Now driven by an insatiable hunger for evil, Trigon moves slowly from universe to universe, spreading corruption and sin among the worlds he finds in order to sate a hunger that knows no end.\n\nMuch later, Trigon encounters a woman wearing a suit of armor specifically crafted to counter his immense powers. Though neither is able to slay the other, Trigon is forced to retreat, swearing that members of his blood would return in their thousands to destroy the wearer of the Silent Armor. Trigon has since set his plans into action, only to run into the problem of most of the mothers of his children being unable to survive mating with him, leaving Trigon with only three sons, all of whom he considers failures. Then, one day, he is brought a human woman from Earth, Arella, who gives him his first daughter Raven, the most powerful of Trigon's children, and the reason why Trigon now targets Earth for conquest.\n\nTrigon is pure evil and a powerful demon capable of immortality, energy projection, pyrokinesis, telepathy, size-shifting, super strength, virtual invulnerability, telekinesis, and matter transmutation and matter manipulation. He was able to reshape the entire planet Earth on a whim; had drained the souls of universes, destroyed entire planets and conquered dimensions, seemingly omniscient, granted powerful psionic powers to Psimon; and could create hordes of demons under his command, as well as open wormholes to other worlds. In addition, Trigon was easily able to defeat the Teen Titans and the Justice League. Trigon can also take on a human form to deceive others. In this form, he appears as an attractive and muscular man with blonde hair and glowing gold eyes.\n\nThe Children of Trigon each wield the power of a Deadly Sin bestowed as a gift from their father. Jared unleashes anger and wrath in his opponents. Jesse sees into the mind of his victims and transforms himself into the thing they envy most as well as taking on said envy's powers and abilities to add to his own. Jacob invokes lust into the hearts of his prey. Raven also possesses this power, and is capable of inducing pride; however, doing so will leave her sick and nauseated for several days. It is not clear whether this is caused by the demonic power itself or by her revulsion towards using it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Effects are seen within an hour. It is taken by mouth.\nCommon side effects include headache, dry mouth, constipation, and dizziness. Serious side effects may include angioedema, urinary retention, and QT prolongation. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding are of unclear safety. It works by blocking muscarinic receptors in the bladder thus decreasing bladder contractions.\nTolterodine was approved for medical use in 1998. It is available as a generic medication. A month supply costs the NHS about GB£2.09 per month as of 2019. In the United States the wholesale cost of this amount is about US$37.16. In 2017, it was the 229th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than two million prescriptions.\n\nDetrusor overactivity (DO, contraction of the muscular bladder wall) is the most common form of urinary incontinence (UI) in older adults. It is characterized by uninhibited bladder contractions causing an uncontrollable urge to void. Urinary frequency, urge incontinence and nocturnal incontinence occur. Abnormal bladder contractions that coincide with the urge to void can be measured by urodynamic studies. Treatment is bladder retraining, pelvic floor therapy or with drugs that inhibit bladder contractions such as oxybutynin and tolterodine.\n\nKnown side effects:\n\nThe following reactions have been reported in patients who have taken tolterodine since it has become available:\n\nTolterodine is not recommended for use in people with myasthenia gravis and angle closure glaucoma.\n\nTolterodine acts on M and M subtypes of muscarinic receptors whereas older antimuscarinic treatments for overactive bladder act more specifically on M receptors.\n\nTolterodine, although it acts on all types of receptors, has fewer side effects than oxybutynin (M and M selective, but more so in the parotid than in the bladder) as tolterodine targets the bladder more than other areas of the body. This means that less drug needs to be given daily (due to efficient targeting of the bladder) and so there are fewer side effects.\n\nIt is marketed by Pfizer in Canada and the United States by its brand name Detrol. In Egypt it is also found under the trade names Tolterodine by Sabaa and Incont L.A. by Adwia.\n"}

{"id": "1869208", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1869208", "title": "Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc", "text": "Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc\n\nPersonal Recollections of Joan of Arc, by the Sieur Louis de Conte is an 1896 novel by Mark Twain which recounts the life of Joan of Arc. It is Twain's last completed novel, published when he was 61 years old.\n\nThe novel is presented as a translation by \"Jean Francois Alden\" of memoirs by Louis de Conte, a fictionalized version of Joan of Arc's page Louis de Contes. The novel is divided into three sections according to Joan of Arc's development: a youth in Domrémy, a commander of the army of Charles VII of France, and a defendant at trial in Rouen.\n\nThe novel was first published as a serialization in \"Harper's Magazine\" beginning in April 1895. Twain was aware of his reputation as a comic writer and he asked that each installment appear anonymously so that readers would treat it seriously. Regardless, his authorship soon became known, and Harper and Brothers published the book edition with his name in May 1896.\n\nThe novel begins with a \"Translator's Preface,\" a translator note on the \"Peculiarity of Joan of Arc's History,\" and a foreword by Sieur Louis de Conte. The \"Translator's Preface\" offers a condensed overview of Joan of Arc's life, with heavy praise (\"the character of Joan of Arc ... occupies the loftiest possible to human attainment\"). The \"Peculiarity\" note explains that Joan of Arc's life is preserved in court documents and that the particulars are provided by Louis de Conte, who, the translator assures us, is reliable. The foreword is Sieur de Conte's writing from 1492 (Joan of Arc died in 1431) about his intimate relation to Joan of Arc: \"I was with her from the beginning until the end\"\n\nBook One begins with the birth of de Conte on January 6, 1410 in Neufchâteau, France and his parents' subsequent move to Paris. He relates his early childhood as chaotic with the city tormented by mobs, criminals, and other instabilities. In 1415, following the death of his family by a Burgundian raiding party, de Conte is sent to a small, rural, rudimentary village named Domrémy to live with the parish priest. Here, he meets young Joan d’Arc, an illiterate peasant. de Conte tells multiple incidents where Joan is shown to be the wisest, bravest, most virtuous child in Domrémy, such as her arguments to the priest on the fairies and her treatment of the wandering soldier and the criminal madman.\n\nIn Chapter VI and VII, de Conte recounts his seeing Joan converse with a divine entity and her explanation that she has been chosen by God to \"win back France, and set the crown upon the head of His servant that is Dauphin and shall be King.\" The governor and the people in the Domrémy mock her when she openly announces this mission; her parents even keep her under watch. Nonetheless, Joan remains adamant.\n\nBook Two begins with the elimination of Joan's hindrances. With support from her visions, Joan leaves the village at age 17 to request control of the army from the king. In Chapter IX, after Joan successfully defends herself in trial for witchcraft, the king appoints Joan \"General-in-Chief of armies.\"\n\nIn Chapter X, Joan begins to organize her campaign, writing a letter to the English commanders at Orléans, demanding they vacate France. The English refuse, and Joan attacks immediately and aggressively despite the generals' and counselors' advice that France remain on the defensive. Through this military campaign, Joan secures several victories over the English. On July 5, the English forces surrender at Rheims, allowing the Bloodless March and coronation of Charles to take place. During the coronation, Joan asks the King to remit taxes on Domremy.\n\nAfter the coronation, Joan requests permission to attack Paris, saying that the move would cripple the English forces. The king's wicked counselors, however, oppose her in the attempt. The king initially grants Joan permission to attack, but just as Joan is on the verge of victory, the king announces a long-term truce with Paris, which indicates a ceasefire. Joan and de Conte are upset at the lost opportunity.\n\nThe final chapter relates the events of May 24, 1430, in which Joan and the French lose a battle to the English and Burgundian troops, resulting in Joan's capture.\n\nThroughout Book 2, de Conte speaks of Joan's virtue (her ban on prostitution, gambling, and profanity in the army; her requirement that each man attend church; and her mercy toward English prisoners) as well as Joan's divine powers (her recognizing the king without notice, finding a hidden sword in the church, foreseeing war-wounds and her impending death).\n\nThe third and final book opens with Joan d’Arc's imprisonment at Marguy. For five and a half months, the Burgundians hold Joan, waiting for King Charles to provide a ransom of 61,125 francs. When no attempt is made, she is sold to the English. For two more months, Joan remains imprisoned while her enemies, led by Bishop Pierre Cauchon of Beauvais, prepare her trial. In an attempt to lessen her influence over the French people, they decide to try Joan for crimes against religion.\n\nBeginning in Chapter IV, the novel provides a detailed account of Joan's three-month-long trial starting on February 21, 1431. de Conte, secretly serving as clerk to the chief recorder, describes the trial as unfair on multiple fronts, including the biased judges and the lack of advocates on her behalf.\n\nThe questions at trial focus on topics such as the visions, her cross-dressing, and her upbringing. de Conte stresses that Joan, the illiterate peasant, fared extremely well, providing well-spoken answers that could not be twisted against her. Chapter VII recounts her most well-known answer after being asked by Beaupere, “Are you in a state of Grace?” (This is a trick question asked by Beaupere. According to Catholic teaching, only God knows who is in a state of Grace. By answering either yes or no, Joan can be accused of blasphemy.) Conte states that with simple gravity she answers, “If I be not in a state of Grace, I pray God place me in it; if I be in it, I pray God keep me so.”\n\nIn Chapter XX, Joan finally submits to her captors before she is about to die at the stake. Unable to read, Joan unknowingly signs a document “confessing herself a sorceress, a dealer with devils, a liar, a blasphemer of God and His angels…and this signature of hers bound her to resume the dress of a woman.\" At the end of Chapter XXI, readers may think that de Conte insinuates Joan d'Arc was raped in prison by the English guards due to the vague wording. It is important, however, to note that at the end of Chapter XXIII, this interpretation is directly gone against by Joan's own statements, relayed by de Conte, during a passionate outburst of indignation and despair by Joan to those dooming her, specifically referring to herself as one who has \"never been defiled.\" If this were the case, she would have taken them to task for this cruelty at that time, and it would have been reflected in the narrative.\n\nIn Chapter XXII, de Conte accuses the English of treachery. While Joan slept, one of the guards removed her female apparel and put male apparel in its place. \"For modesty's sake,\" Joan put on the male clothes, \"the forbidden garments, knowing what the end would be.\"\n\nFor breaking the condition that she not wear men's clothing again, Joan is convicted as a \"relapsed heretic.\" She burns at the stake on the following Wednesday, May 30, 1431.\n\nThe fictional biographer, de Conte, ends his presentation in the year 1492, where he is 82 years of age. He summarizes the lives and deaths of many of the characters, including Joan's family and King Charles the VII. He closes with a salute to the legacy of Joan, citing her impact on the country she loved so much.\n\n\"Joan of Arc\" largely lacks the humor prevalent in Twain's other works, and it has a different tone and flow. He had a personal fascination with Joan of Arc which began in the early 1850s when he found a leaf from her biography and asked his brother Henry if she was a real person. Gioia notes that: \"Twain was raised in a Southern culture that was deeply suspicious of – and sometimes openly hostile to – Roman Catholicism and its veneration of saints and relics. He once stated that he had been taught 'enmity toward everything that is Catholic'.\"\n\nTwain claimed to have worked harder on this book than any other. He wrote to H.H. Rogers, \"I have never done any work before that cost so much thinking and weighing and measuring and planning and cramming.\" The published book lists 11 official sources as \"authorities examined in verification of the truthfulness of this narrative\". Historians today agree that Twain conducted the bulk of his investigation during his prolonged stay in Europe during the early 1890s, which included multiple stops in France. He apparently drew most of his information from the fifth volume of Jules Michelet's \"Histoire de France\" and Jules Quicherat's \"Proces de condamnation et de rehabilitation de Jeanne d’Arc\". Joan of Arc's story was relatively unknown at that time, especially in English-speaking nations, which makes Twain's research noteworthy.\n\nTwain based Joan of Arc's physical appearance on his daughter Susy Clemens, as he remembered her at age 17. He began writing the novel late in 1892, then set it aside until 1894; he finished the manuscript in 1895. He serialized an abridged version for magazine publication, then published the full-length book in 1896.\n\nTwain considered this work to be his best and most important. It was fairly well received in 1893, when first published: One newspaper positively reviewed Twain's work. \"We meet a dignified, ennobled, hero-worshipping Mark Twain. His language has undergone a startling change. Not flippancy, but pathos, meets us on every page; the sardonic mocking spirit has been conquered by the fair Maid of Orleans, and where aforetime we met laughter, we now meet tears.\" Twain's daughter Clara Clemens wrote that \"Andrew Lang so much admired Father’s \"Joan\" that he suggested dedicating to him his own biography of the Maid.\"\n\nAs a child, Coley Taylor was Twain's neighbor in Redding, Connecticut, where Twain lived from 1908 until his death in 1910. He told the story of the day when he approached Twain as a young boy to profess his adulation for Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. Upon hearing the boy's praises, Twain suddenly took on the mien of a vexed schoolteacher. \"You shouldn’t read those books about bad boys,\" he said, wagging his finger in Taylor's face. \"My best book is my \"Recollections of Joan of Arc\".\"\n\nHowever, 20th century critics have not favored \"Recollections\", and it is hardly read or acknowledged in the mainstream today, especially compared to Twain's comedic works such as \"Huckleberry Finn\", \"Pudd'n Head Wilson\", and \"Tom Sawyer\".\n\nIn the preface to his play \"Saint Joan\", iconoclastic literary critic George Bernard Shaw accused Twain of being \"infatuated\" with Joan of Arc. Shaw says that Twain \"romanticizes\" the story of Joan, reproducing a legend that the English deliberately rigged the trial to find her guilty of witchcraft and heresy. Recent study of the trial transcripts, however, suggests that Twain's depiction may have been closer to the truth than Shaw was willing to accept.\n\nAmerican author and historian Bernard DeVoto was also critical of \"Joan of Arc\", calling it \"mawkish\". De Voto also claims that Twain \"was uncomfortable in the demands of tragedy, formalizing whatever could not be sentimentalized.\" Maxwell Geismar delivered a scathing review, describing it as Twain's worst book: \"It is difficult to find anything of interest in \"Joan of Arc\" – except its badness\". Twain scholar Louis J. Budd said that \"Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc\" \"has disgraced Twain posthumously with several levels of readers\", even though \"it met general approval in 1896\".\n\nHarris expresses befuddlement at this work's placement in Twain's body of works: \"By the time Twain is writing \"Recollections\", he’s not a believer. He is anti-Catholic, and he doesn’t like the French. So he writes a book about a French-Catholic-martyr? Ostensibly, it doesn’t make a lot of sense.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1869211", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1869211", "title": "Instruction selection", "text": "Instruction selection\n\nIn computer science, \"instruction selection\" is the stage of a compiler backend that transforms its middle-level intermediate representation (IR) into a low-level IR. In a typical compiler, instruction selection precedes both instruction scheduling and register allocation; hence its output IR has an infinite set of pseudo-registers (often known as \"temporaries\") and may still be – and typically is – subject to peephole optimization. Otherwise, it closely resembles the target machine code, bytecode, or assembly language.\n\nFor example, for the following sequence of middle-level IR code\n\na good instruction sequence for the x86 architecture is\nMOV EAX, a\nXCHG EAX, b\nADD a, EAX\nFor a comprehensive survey on instruction selection, see.\n\nThe simplest approach to instruction selection is known as \"macro expansion\" or \"interpretative code generation\". A macro-expanding instruction selector operates by matching \"templates\" over the middle-level IR. Upon a match the corresponding \"macro\" is executed, using the matched portion of the IR as input, which emits the appropriate target instructions. Macro expansion can be done either directly on the textual representation of the middle-level IR, or the IR can first be transformed into a graphical representation which is then traversed depth-first. In the latter, a template matches one or more adjacent nodes in the graph.\n\nUnless the target machine is very simple, macro expansion in isolation typically generates inefficient code. To mitigate this limitation, compilers that apply this approach typically combine it with peephole optimization to replace combinations of simple instructions with more complex equivalents that increase performance and reduce code size. This is known as the \"Davidson-Fraser approach\" and is currently applied in GCC.\n\nAnother approach is to first transform the middle-level IR into a graphical representation and then \"cover\" the graph using \"patterns\". A pattern is a template that matches a portion of the graph and can be implemented with a single instruction provided by the target machine. The goal is to cover the graph such that the total cost of the selected patterns is minimized, where the cost typically represents the number of cycles it takes to execute the instruction. For tree-shaped graphs, the least-cost cover can be found in linear time using dynamic programming, but for DAGs and full-fledged graphs the problem becomes NP-complete and thus is most often solved using either greedy algorithms or methods from combinatorial optimization.\n\nThe \"lowest common denominator strategy\" is an instruction selection technique used on platforms where processor-supplementary instructions exist to make executable programs portable across a wide range of computers. Under a lowest common denominator strategy, the default behaviour of the compiler is to build for the lowest common architecture. Use of any available processor extension is switched off by default, unless explicitly switched on by command line switches.\n\nThe use of a lowest common denominator strategy means that processor-supplementary instructions and capabilities are not used by default.\n\n"}

He was a successful silk merchant in Essex, England, but he emigrated to the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1632 and quickly assumed a number of roles in the colonial government. In the mid-1630s, he became a supporter of dissident minister John Wheelwright and of Anne Hutchinson. Hutchinson was tried as a heretic in 1637, and Coggeshall was one of three deputies who voted for her acquittal. She was banished from the colony in 1638, and the three deputies who voted for her acquittal were also compelled to leave. Before leaving Boston, Coggeshall and many other Hutchinson supporters signed the Portsmouth Compact in March 1638 agreeing to form a government based on the individual consent of the inhabitants. They then established the settlement of Portsmouth on Aquidneck Island (called Rhode Island at the time), one of the four towns comprising the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.\n\nCoggeshall was very active in civil affairs, but a rift in the leadership of the colony caused him and several other leaders to leave in 1639, moving to the south end of the island and establishing the town of Newport. The towns of Portsmouth and Newport reunited in 1640 under the leadership of William Coddington, and Coggeshall was his assistant until 1647 when the two towns on Rhode Island united to form a common government with the towns of Providence and Warwick, and Coggeshall was elected President of the entire Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. His tenure was very short due to his death later the same year, but during his administration many laws were established which became the basis for the colony and the future State of Rhode Island.\n\nJohn Coggeshall was the son of John and Ann (Butter) Coggeshall. He was born and raised in northeastern Essex, England and baptized at Halstead. After his marriage, he lived four miles (six km) away in Castle Hedingham where several of his children were baptized, and where he was a merchant prior to his emigration. In 1632, Coggeshall and his family joined the mass migration of English Puritans to New England, sailing on the \"Lyon,\" the same ship that carried Roger Williams the year before. The Coggeshalls first settled at Roxbury where they were admitted to the Roxbury Church the year of their arrival, and where John Eliot became the pastor. In 1634, Coggeshall moved with his family to Boston where he and his wife were admitted to the church on 20 August, and where they became the nextdoor neighbors of William and Anne Hutchinson.\n\nCoggeshall was a mercer in the silk trade, and he held many offices in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. He was a deputy to the General Court for Boston from 1634 to 1637 and a Boston selectman during the same period. In 1634, he was also on a committee to survey Mount Wollaston, and also on a committee to oversee ammunition.\n\nSometime after moving to Boston, Coggeshall became an enthusiastic supporter of Anne Hutchinson, who was at the center of the growing Antinomian Controversy. Also supporting her initially were the Reverend John Cotton and many of the Boston church members. Even the colony's Governor Henry Vane was a strong admirer, but he was voted out of office and John Winthrop became the governor. At that point, strong measures were taken to \"stamp out heresy and drive out the heretics,\" in the words of one modern historian. Anne Hutchinson was tried, convicted, and banished from the colony because of her religious opinions, her prophecies of God's wrath and destruction upon the colony, and her influence in fanning the flames of controversy within the community. At her civil trial, Coggeshall spoke out in her defense and was one of only three deputies to vote for her acquittal, the other two being William Aspinwall and William Coddington. Coggeshall also supported dissident minister Reverend John Wheelwright, whose wife was the sister of Anne Hutchinson's husband. Shortly after Hutchinson's banishment, Coggeshall was expelled from the General Court and was also directed to leave Massachusetts in March 1638.\n\nMany of Hutchinson's supporters were ordered out of the Massachusetts colony, but a group of them (including Coggeshall) signed what is called the Portsmouth Compact before leaving Boston, thus establishing a non-sectarian civil government with a Christian focus, upon the universal consent of the inhabitants. The group initially planned to settle in New Netherland, but they were persuaded by Roger Williams to purchase some land from the Indians on Narragansett Bay. They moved to the northeast end of Rhode Island and established the settlement of Pocasset, changing the name to Portsmouth in 1639. William Coddington was elected the first judge (governor) of the settlement. In May 1638, Coggeshall was on a committee to lay out land there, and he was granted six acres at the same time. The following year, a disagreement prompted Coddington and a few other leaders, including Coggeshall, to leave Portsmouth and begin a new settlement called Newport at the south end of the island. Governor Winthrop described the 1639 disagreement in Portsmouth in his journal: \"the people grew very tumultuous and put out Mr. Coddington and the other three magistrates.\" Coggeshall was one of the three referred to by Winthrop.\n\nCoggeshall was soon a leader in Newport and was granted of land on the south side of the town, along Bellevue Avenue. In the first election in 1638, he was elected as treasurer, and he became an assistant to the governor in 1640, which position he held continuously until 1647. He had a good working relationship with Roger Williams which helped the towns of Portsmouth, Newport, Providence, and Warwick to unite and form the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations in the Spring of 1647, under the patent that Williams had obtained from the crown in 1644. In May 1647, Coggeshall was elected the chief magistrate of the four-town colony with the title of President. He had an assistant from each town, a general recorder, and a treasurer. Under his administration, the courts of justice were established and the first complete code of laws was written. Rhode Island historian and Lieutenant Governor Samuel G. Arnold made this tribute to the digest of statutes enacted under Coggeshall in 1647: \n\nCoggeshall was in office only briefly, dying of an illness in Newport on 27 November 1647 and being buried on his own property there. He is noted for being the first president of the united Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. He is also noted for helping to establish the three towns of Boston, Portsmouth, and Newport, and the two colonies of Massachusetts Bay and Rhode Island.\n\nCoggeshall's wife was named Mary, but her maiden name remains uncertain. Some sources claim that her maiden name was Gould, another says that it was Surgis, but these are undocumented. Coggeshall and his wife had eight children, five of whom were born in England and the others in Boston, but only half of whom are known to have survived to maturity. Their oldest child John was very active in colonial affairs over a period of three decades, serving as treasurer, commissioner, assistant, and deputy governor. Their son Joshua also served in public office as deputy to the General Court of Rhode Island for all but two years between 1664 and 1672, and as assistant (magistrate) for all but one year from 1669 to 1676.

{"id": "1869214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1869214", "title": "SEMI", "text": "SEMI\n\nSEMI (formerly Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International) is a industry association comprising companies involved in the electronics design and manufacturing supply chain. They provide equipment, materials and services for the manufacture of semiconductors, photovoltaic panels, LED and flat panel displays, micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), printed and flexible electronics, and related micro and nano-technologies.\n\nSEMI is headquartered in Milpitas, California, and has offices in Bangalore; Berlin; Grenoble, France; Hsinchu, Taiwan; Seoul; Shanghai; Singapore; Tokyo; and Washington, D.C. Its main activities include conferences and trade shows, development of industry standards, market research reporting, and industry advocacy. The president and chief executive officer of the organization is Ajit Manocha.\n\nSEMI Global Advocacy represents the interests of the semiconductor industry’s design, manufacturing and supply chain businesses worldwide. SEMI promotes its positions on public issues via press releases, position papers, presentations, social media, web content, and media interviews.\n\nSEMI Global Advocacy focuses on five priorities: taxes, trade, technology, talent, and environment, health and safety (EHS).\n\nSEMI Workforce Development attracts, and develops talent that can fulfill the requirements of the electronics industry. SEMI programs include:\n\n\nThe SEMI Standards program was established in 1973 using proceeds from the west coast SEMICON show. Its first initiative, following meetings with silicon suppliers, was a successful effort to set common wafer diameters to be used in silicon manufacturing. This standardization helped the industry avoid a wafer shortage from 1973 to 1974, that had previously been anticipated. The standards would become internationally utilized over the years, through partnerships with the ASTM, the DIN, and other national standards organizations. Before these standards, there were more than two thousand different specifications for silicon and by 1975 80% of all silicon wafers met with the SEMI standard. It was first published annually as the Book of SEMI Standards. With three new standards published annually in the mid-2000s, the book was eventually replaced with a CD-ROM, and now standards are available online on an annual subscription basis.\n\nToday, more than 1,000 SEMI standards and safety guidelines are available to address all aspects of automated fabs. The standards are developed and maintained by over 5,000 volunteer experts representing more than 2,000 companies, working in 23 technical committees and 200 task forces. High-profile standards include wafer dimensions and materials, factory efficiency and reliability, equipment interfaces, and environmental, health and safety standards.\n\nThe four main equipment communication standards are the SECS-I (which stands for SEMI Equipment Communication Standards) established in 1978 that deals with communication protocol and physical definitions, the SECS-II established in 1982 that deals with message format, the GEM established in 1992 that refines the SECS-II, and the HSMS that supersedes SECS-I established in 1994. The organization also provides safety and ergonomics guidelines, the first of which was the SEMI S2 developed in 1993, followed by the SEMI S8 in 1995.\n\nSEMI was founded in 1970 as an association of semiconductor production equipment vendors. At that time, most companies in the semiconductor industry exhibited at the Wescon Show on the west coast and the IEEE show on the east coast. Wishing to organize a show dedicated to semiconductor production equipment, 55 companies met in Palo Alto and agreed to found a new association, originally called Semiconductor Equipment and Materials Institute.\n\nThe first SEMICON show was held in 1971 at the San Mateo Fairground in California, which featured “semiconductor processing equipment, materials, and service firms.” It featured 80 exhibitors and attracted 2,800 visitors. In 1973, the first SEMICON East show was held in New York City, with 120 exhibitors participating. This was followed by SEMICON Europa in Zurich, Switzerland (1975) and SEMICON Japan in Tokyo (1977), which attracted more than 200 exhibitors and 4,500 visitors. Through this and other activities, the organization grew from a domestic organization to one with an international focus. Part of this focus was to work with governments to reduce trade barriers and develop “a sympathetic regulatory climate” for its member organizations—companies that sold equipment and materials to firms that produce microprocessors.\n\nToday SEMI organizes and produces nearly 100 technology showcases, trade shows, conferences and special events per year in all of the major manufacturing regions of the world. They include trade shows in China, Japan, Germany, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, North America, and Europe, as well as executive conferences, technical programs, and standards meetings. The organization also has technical education programs, and a weekly email newsletter. Presentations delivered at its symposia are available to members of the organization on the Members Only section of the website.\n\nSEMI provides market research reports for the semiconductor equipment, materials, and LED industries. Its billing data is considered an important leading indicator of demand trends and is closely watched within the industry and by semiconductor market analysts and investor. It also releases the World Fab Forecast.\n\nThe semiconductor equipment billings report provides a three-month rolling average of the book-to-bill ratio for semiconductor equipment manufacturers with headquarters in North America. It is released approximately three weeks after the close of each month.\nData for the reports is collected directly from suppliers through a confidential data collection program via an independent financial services company.\n\nThere are data collection programs in the following areas.\n\nIn-depth reports are broken down by region, supply chain segment, and equipment type.\n\nSEMI Smart Initiatives build activities around promising electronics markets emerging from mass digitalization in the Fourth Industrial Era. The initiatives synchronize advances around semiconductors, electronics and imaging systems, the Internet of Things, MEMS, sensors, devices, displays, and other digital technologies used in the electronics industry.\n\nSEMI Smart Initiatives include:\n\n\nMore than 20 SEMI Technology Communities, 150 Committees, and 15 Partner organizations provide access to global networks for collaboration, professional growth, business opportunities, educational events, workshops, and industrywide intelligence.\n\nIn 2019, Electronic Systems Design Alliance (ESDA) joined SEMI as a SEMI Strategic Association partner In 2018, Electronic System Design Alliance joined SEMI as a Strategic Association partner.\n\nIn 2019, Nano Bio Materials Consortium (NBMC) joined SEMI as a SEMI Strategic Association partner\n\nIn 2018, Fab Owners Association joined SEMI as a SEMI Strategic Association partner.\n\nIn 2017, MSIG (MEMS & Sensors Industry Group) joined SEMI as a SEMI Strategic Association partner bringing MEMS and Sensors community to SEMI’s global platforms.\n\nIn 2016, FlexTech joined SEMI as a SEMI Strategic Association partner.\n\n\n"}

He created the Evil Queen in \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\". He led the development of \"Pinocchio\" and co-wrote \"Fantasia\" and \"Dumbo\". During World War II, Grant worked on war cartoons including the Oscar-winning \"Der Fuehrer's Face\". \n\nGrant was Jewish, and rigorously denied rumors that Walt Disney was anti-Semitic claiming \"As far as I'm concerned, there was no evidence of anti-Semitism...I think the whole idea should be put to rest and buried deep. He was not anti-Semitic. Some of the most influential people at the Studio were Jewish. It's much ado about nothing. I never once had a problem with him in that way. That myth should be laid to rest.\" \n\nLady, the protagonist from \"Lady and the Tramp\" was based on a pet English Springer Spaniel named Lady owned by Joe Grant, it is said by his daughter on the DVD (\"Lady and the Tramp\") that Walt Disney thought the dog's long fur looked like a dress and suggested creating a storyboard featuring his dog.\n\nGrant left the Disney studio in 1949 and ran a ceramics business and a greeting card business but returned in 1989 to work on \"Beauty and the Beast\". He also worked on \"Aladdin\", \"The Lion King\", \"Pocahontas\", \"Mulan\", \"Fantasia 2000\", and Pixar's \"Monsters, Inc.\" among others. Grant was also specially mentioned in the credits of Monsters, Inc. The last two films he worked on before his death, \"Chicken Little\" and Pixar's \"Up\", were dedicated to him.\n\nGrant worked four days a week at Disney until he died, nine days before his 97th birthday. Grant's final project, \"Lorenzo\", for which he conceived the idea and helped storyboard, received an Academy Award nomination in 2005.\n\nHe was a recipient of the Disney legend award.\n\nIn 2004, a short film he developed called \"Lorenzo\" was made and was based on his cat who got into a fight with two poodles in 1949. While it happened, he was thinking, \"what would happen if he lost his tail?\" The short, directed by Mike Gabriel, was released on March 4th, 2004 at the Florida Film Festival and made its world premier in front of the critically panned \"Raising Helen,\" with this the only positive feedback from critics and audiences. The finished short was planned at the time to be attached for a planned third \"Fantasia movie,\" but in 2003, the planned feature was eventually cancelled due to several years of funding and staff cutbacks from Walt Disney Feature Animation. The short won an Annie Award for Best Animated Short Subject, and was included at the Animation Show of Shows.\n\nOn May 6, 2005, Grant died of heart attack while working at his drawing board in his home studio, nine days before his 97th birthday. He is interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. The film \"Chicken Little\", released five months after his death, was dedicated to his memory.\n\n"}

It originally appeared as Heckler & Koch's candidate for the US Army's Enhanced Grenade Launcher requirement, evaluated for use with the XM8 and FN SCAR rifles. As is commonly mistaken, the \"A\" is not an addition to the name \"G36\", which is short for \"Gewehr 36\", but is in fact an abbreviation of the German \"Anbaugranatwerfer\", literally meaning \"attached grenade launcher\" and the 36 coming from the name of the primary weapon it was designed to enhance – the G36. It can also be used dismounted, with a stock attached as a stand-alone model, or a LLM01 laser light module can be attached to it.\n\nAs in many modern weapon systems, including the G36 series, extensive use of polymers and high-strength aluminium in the AG36 launcher contributes to its low mass and high durability. It is capable of firing almost all 40×46mm grenade rounds, including plastic training cartridges, flexible baton rounds, CS gas, and oleoresin capsicum (OC, the same chemical used in pepper spray) gas cartridges, white phosphorus, and HE ammunition. With the grenade launcher fitted, when firing 5.56 mm ammunition, the G36 Rifle’s mean point of impact shifts approx. 10 cm downwards at a range of 100 meters. The AG36 is a part of Germany's Infantryman of the future program.\n\nThe AG36 is a single-shot weapon with a break-action steel barrel and unlike its American counterpart, the M203, the AG36 swings out laterally for loading, allowing for the use of longer rounds when necessary, e.g. baton or flare rounds. When open, the breech is on the left. For installation, the rifle's existing barrel handguard is removed and replaced by the AG36. The weapon has a trigger group with a manual safety lever and a pistol grip for ease of handling. Aiming is accomplished using standard ladder sights, which are located on the left side of the launcher body and folded down when not in use.\n\nDue to its modular design, the launcher can be readily adapted to other rifles, such as the M16-series and the Diemaco C7 and C8.\n\nThe L17A1 and L123A2 UGL (Underslung Grenade Launcher) are the under-barrel 40 mm grenade launchers used by the British Army in conjunction with the L85A2 rifle (L123A2 UGL), and in small numbers with the L119A1 carbine used by United Kingdom Special Forces and the Pathfinder Platoon (L17A1 UGL). It is designed and built by Heckler & Koch and is a modified variant of the AG36. The UGL was first deployed during Operation Telic in 2003. The UGL replaced the muzzle-launched Rifle Grenade General Service. One UGL is issued per fireteam within infantry battalions.\n\nA further version of the AG36 is the Heckler & Koch AG-C/EGLM.\n\n\n\n"}

Smylie\n\nRobert Eben Smylie (October 31, 1914 – July 17, 2004) was an American politician and attorney from Idaho. A member of the Idaho Republican Party, he served as the 24th Governor of Idaho for twelve years, from 1955 to 1967.\n\nBorn in Marcus, Iowa, Smylie graduated from high school in Cresco in 1932 at the height of the Depression. Offered a place to live by an uncle, he moved to Idaho to attend the College of Idaho in Caldwell. During the school year, he participated in debate, the yearbook, football, and student government, and hitchhiked back to Iowa in the summers.\n\nAfter his graduation in 1938 he moved to Washington D.C., where he simultaneously clerked at the law firm of Covington Burling, was a U.S. Capitol policeman, and attended George Washington University Law School until his graduation in 1942. He married Lucile Irwin on December 4, 1943 and the couple had two sons.\n\nHaving begun practicing law in Washington, D.C., Smylie left his practice in 1942 to join the U.S. Coast Guard as a lawyer and was stationed in Philadelphia and the Philippines during World War II. He returned to his private practice in 1946.\n\nIn January 1947, Smylie became a deputy attorney general in Idaho, under newly elected Robert Ailshie. Later that year, Ailshie unexpectedly died of a heart attack at age 39 and Smylie was appointed attorney general at age 33 by Governor C. A. Robins. After he was elected to a full term in 1950, Smylie ran for governor in 1954, as the seat was not eligible for re-election at the time and was held by Republican Len Jordan. Starting with the 1946 election, Idaho changed from two-year to four-year terms for governor, but with the change it disallowed self-succession (re-election). Smylie was elected governor in 1954 and successfully lobbied the 1955 legislature to propose an amendment to the state constitution to allow gubernatorial re-election, which was approved by voters in the 1956 general election. Smylie was re-elected in 1958 and 1962. He was its first governor born in the 20th century.\n\nDuring his tenure, a state park system was created, and a sales tax adopted. In February 1955, following a prompt from a BBC reporter, Smylie fast-tracked legislation to remove the anomaly of Idaho being the only one of the 48 states that did not observe George Washington's Birthday as a holiday. While governor, Smylie served as chair of the Western Governors Association (1959–1961) and as chair of the Republican Governors Association. He was a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1960. Smylie served on the National Governor's Conference Executive Committee from 1956 to 1957, from 1959 to 1960, and in 1963.\n\nSmylie ran for a fourth term in 1966, but was soundly defeated (61 to 39%) in the Republican primary by his successor, Don Samuelson, whom he had encouraged to run for the state senate six years earlier. Smylie attributed his support of the newly implemented sales tax of three per cent in 1965 as a major factor in his defeat. The sales tax was easily approved by voters in the November election; it stayed at three per cent until and is now \n\nLeaving the governor's office after a dozen years at age 52, Smylie returned to the practice of law in 1967. He served as Trustee, Chair of Trustees, and as acting President of the College of Idaho. Smylie ran for the open U.S. Senate seat in 1972, but finished fourth in the Republican primary, won by Jim McClure.\nA former governor for more than 37 years, Smylie died in Boise at age 89 on July 17, 2004, and his wife Lucile died less than six weeks later. They are interred at Pioneer Cemetery in Boise. Lucile's sister Virgil was the widow of D. Worth Clark, Democratic U.S. Senator from Idaho.\n\n"}

This understatement is likely deliberate; Catullus knows very well the quality of his poetry, and also the provocative form it has. He also calls his work \"new\"; the poems are recently made and therefore new, but they are also new as some of the first examples of Neoteric poetry in the Latin language.\n\nThe meter of this poem is hendecasyllabic, a common form in Catullus's poetry.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1869241", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1869241", "title": "Pop filter", "text": "Pop filter\n\nA pop filter, pop shield or pop screen is a noise protection filter for microphones, typically used in a recording studio. It serves to reduce or eliminate \"popping\" sounds caused by the mechanical impact of fast-moving air on the microphone during recorded speech and singing.\n\nPopping sounds occur particularly in the pronunciation of aspirated plosives (such as the first 'p' in the English word \"popping\"). The popping sound recorded by a microphone has two components: High-frequency components are from air moving past the grille or other parts of the microphone body. The low-frequency component is from air impacting the diaphragm. Mechanical and electrical saturation (e.g. clipping) can also play a role depending on the amount of headroom designed into these systems.\n\nA typical pop filter is composed of one or more layers of acoustically semi-transparent material such as woven nylon stretched over a circular frame, and often includes a clamp and a flexible mounting bracket. Metal pop filters use a fine mesh metal screen in place of the nylon. Some studio condenser microphones have an integral pop filter built into their design.\n\nAn improvised pop shield, functionally identical to the professional units, can be made with material from tights or stockings stretched over a kitchen sieve, embroidery hoop or a loop of wire such as a bent clothes hanger. It is important that the pop shield not be attached directly to the microphone as vibrations will be transmitted from the shield to the mic.\n\nPop filters are designed to attenuate the energy of the plosive, which otherwise might exceed the design input capacity of the microphone, leading to clipping. In effect, the plosive's discrete envelope of sound energy is intercepted and broken up by the strands of the filter material before it can impinge on, and momentarily distort, the sensitive diaphragm of the microphone. Pop filters do not appreciably affect hissing sounds or sibilance, for which de-essing is used.\n\nAdditionally, a pop filter can protect against the accumulation of saliva on the microphone element. Salts in human saliva are corrosive; therefore, use of a pop filter may improve the lifespan of the microphone.\n\nA pop filter differs from a microphone windscreen. Pop filters are generally used in a studio environment, while windscreens are typically used outdoors. Windscreens are also used by vocalists on stage to reduce plosives and saliva, though they may not be as acoustically transparent as a studio pop filter.\n"}

The main V-weapons were the V-1 flying bomb and V-2 rocket – these were launched against Britain from 1944 to 1945 and used against European targets as well. It included strategic operations against research and development of the weapons, their manufacture, transportation and attacks on their launch site, and fighter intercepts against missiles in flight.\n\nInitial intelligence investigations in 1943 into the progress of German long range weapons was carried out under the code name Bodyline. On 15 November, a larger operation was set up under the name \"Crossbow\". Post-war, Crossbow operations became known as \"Operation Crossbow\" particularly following the 1965 film of the same name.\n\nIn May 1943 Allied surveillance observed the construction of the first of eleven large sites in northern France for secret German weapons, including six for the V-2 rocket. In November it discovered the first of 96 \"ski sites\" for the V-1 flying bomb.\n\nOfficials debated the extent of the German weapons' danger; some viewed the sites as decoys to divert Allied bombers, while others feared chemical or biological warheads. When reconnaissance and intelligence information regarding the V-2 became convincing, the War Cabinet Defence Committee (Operations) directed the campaign's first planned raid (the Operation Hydra attack on Peenemünde in August 1943).\n\nThe works in France were the German \"Site System 1\" which was to be 96 fixed launching sites with storage bunkers (the 'ski' shapes) and outdoor ramps. Site System 2 (a reserve) and System 3 were planned. There were also four larger \"Wasserwerk\" (\"Waterworks\") bunker sites: Siracourt, Lottinghen, Nardouet, and Brécourt. Intended for use in January 1944 actual progress in construction, training and supply of V-1s was behind when inspected by German high command in October. French reports and detailed aerial reconnaissance linked with reconnaissance of Peenemünde indicated possibility of 2,000 missiles per day against England. Over half the sites were completed by December but Allied intelligence had identified all 96 by end of January. The first bombing of sites was by USAAF Martin B-26 Marauder medium bombers in early December with RAF Bomber Command starting night-time attacks shortly after but the greater inaccuracy of night bombing against small targets led Joint Chiefs of Staff to use US heavy bombers in daylight. By end of December 54 sites had been attacked and seven were destroyed. The bombing continued – by end of March 9 destroyed and 35 seriously damaged, by May 24 destroyed and 58 seriously damaged.\n\nFollowing Operation Hydra, a few \"Crossbow\" attacks were conducted on the \"Heavy Crossbow\" bunkers of Watten (V-2) and Mimoyecques (V-3) from August and November 1943 respectively. \"Crossbow Operations Against Ski Sites\" began on December 5 with the \"Noball\" code name used for the targets (e.g., 'Noball 27' was the site, \"Noball No. 93\" was in the Cherbourg area, \"Noball No. 107\" was at Grand Parc, and \"Noball V1 site No.147\" was at Ligescourt).\n\nThe US formed its own Crossbow Committee under General Stephen Henry (New Developments Division) on December 29, 1943, and the US subsequently developed bombing techniques for ski sites in February/March 1944 at the Air Corps Proving Ground.\n\nA mid-1944 plan for US Marine Corps aircraft to attack V-1 launch sites from aircraft carriers fell victim to inter-service rivalry – being opposed by the Army.\nV-2 facilities were also bombed in 1944, including smaller facilities such as V-2 storage depots and liquid oxygen plants, such as the Mery-sur-Oise V-2 storage depot on August 4, 1944 and, by the Eighth Air Force, which bombed five cryogenic liquid oxygen plants in Belgium on August 25, 1944 but aborted the next days attack on plants \"at La Louviere, Torte and Willebroeck, Belgium\" due to cloud.\n\nAt the request of the British War Cabinet, on April 19, 1944, General Eisenhower directed \"Crossbow\" attacks to have absolute priority over all other air operations, including \"wearing down German industry\" and civilian morale \"for the time being\", which he confirmed after the V-1 assault began on the night of June 12/13, 1944 saying to Arthur Tedder \"with respect to \"Crossbow\" targets, these targets are to take first priority over everything except the urgent requirements of the Overlord [invasion of Normandy] battle; this priority to obtain until we can be certain that we have definitely gotten the upper hand of this particular business\".\nThe launches surprised the Allies, who had believed that the earlier attacks on the sites had eliminated the danger. The British, who had not expected German bombing of Britain to resume so late in the war, were especially upset. Some suggested using gas on the launch sites, or even executing German civilians as punishment.\n\nCarl Spaatz, commander of U.S. Strategic Air Forces in Europe (USTTAF), responded on June 28 to \"complain that \"Crossbow\" was a 'diversion' from the main task of wearing down the Luftwaffe and bombing German industry\" for the Combined Bomber Offensive, and to recommend instead that \"Crossbow\" be a secondary priority since \"days of bad weather over Germany's industrial targets would still allow enough weight of attack for the rocket sites and the lesser tactical crises.\" By July 10, Tedder had published a list of Crossbow targets which assigned 30 to RAF Bomber Command, six to the tactical Allied Expeditionary Air Force, and 68 to Spaatz' USSTAF; after which Spaatz again complained, so Eisenhower allowed \"spare\" bombing of non-Crossbow targets: \"Instructions for continuing to make \"Crossbow\" targets our first priority must stand, but ... when ... the entire strategic forces cannot be used against \"Crossbow\", we should attack—(a) Aircraft industry, (b) Oil, (c) ball bearing (German): Kugellagerwerke, (d) Vehicular production\" (Eisenhower, July 18).\n\nNonetheless, over a quarter of the Combined Bomber Offensive's tonnage of bombs were used against V-weapon sites in July and August; many of the attacks were ineffective, as they were against unused sites rather than the launchers themselves. Spaatz unsuccessfully proposed that attacks concentrate on the Calais electrical grid, and on gyrocompass factories in Germany and V-weapon storage depots in France. The gyrocompass attacks, along with targeting liquid oxygen tanks (which the Allies knew the V-2 needed), might have been very effective against the missiles. On August 25, 1944, the Joint Crossbow Target Priorities Committee (established July 21) prepared the \"Plan for Attack on the German Rocket Organization When Rocket Attacks Commence\"—in addition to bombing of storage, liquid-oxygen, and launch sites; the plan included aerial reconnaissance operations.\nFollowing the last V-1 launch from France on September 1, 1944, and since the expected V-2 attacks had not begun, \"Crossbow\" bombing was suspended on September 3 and the campaign against German oil facilities became the highest priority.\n\nThe V-1 threat from occupied France ended on September 5, 1944, when the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division contained the German military units of the Nord-Pas de Calais area with their surrender following on September 30.\n\n\"Crossbow\" bombing resumed after the first V-2 attack and included a large September 17 raid on Dutch targets suspected as bases for Heinkel He 111s, which were air-launching V-1s. Modified V-1s (865 total) were air-launched from September 16, 1944 to January 14, 1945. The British had initially considered that an earlier July 18–21, 1944 effort of 50 air-launched V-1s had been ground-launched from the Low Countries, particularly near Ostend. In addition to air-launched V-1s, launches were from ramps built in the province of South Holland, the Netherlands in 1945.\n\nAllied reconnaissance detected two sites at Vlaardingen and Ypenburg, and along with a third at Delft, they launched 274 V-1s at London from March 3–29. Only 125 reached the British defences, and only thirteen of those reached the target area. Three additional sites directed their fire on Antwerp. After using medium bombers against V-2 launch site in the Haagse Bos on March 3, the RAF attacked the Holland V-1 sites with two squadrons. An RAF Fighter Command unit used Spitfires against Ypenburg on March 20 and 23, while a RAF Second Tactical Air Force unit used Hawker Typhoons against Vlaardingen on March 23. Counterattacks on Holland's V-1 and V-2 sites ended on April 3, and all \"Crossbow\" countermeasures ended on May 2 with the end of World War II in Europe.\n\nOn January 2, 1944, Air Marshal Roderic Hill, Air Officer Commander-in-Chief of Air Defence of Great Britain submitted his plan to deploy 1,332 guns for the defence of London, Bristol and the Solent against the V-1 \"Robot Blitz\" (the \"Diver Operations Room\" was located at RAF Biggin Hill). Against V-1s attacks there were belts of select units of Fighter Command (No. 150 Wing RAF) operating high-speed fighters, the anti-aircraft guns of Anti-Aircraft Command, and approximately 1,750 barrage balloons of Balloon Command around London.\n\n\"Flabby\" was the code name for medium weather-conditions when fighters were allowed to chase flying bombs over the gun-belt to the balloon line, and during Operation \"Totter\", the Royal Observer Corps fired \"Snowflake\" illuminating rocket flares from the ground to identify V-1 flying bombs to RAF fighters. After the Robot Blitz began on the night of June 12/13, 1944, the first RAF fighter interception of a V-1 was on June 14/15. Moreover, anti-aircraft guns increased the rate of downed V-1s to 1 per 77 rounds fired after the introduction of proximity fuses.\nDespite the defences, by June 27, \"over 100,000 houses had been damaged or destroyed by the V-1 ... and shattered sewage systems threatened serious epidemics unless fixed by winter.\"\n\nOf the 638 air-launched V-1s that had been observed, guns and fighters brought down 403; the 66 fell in the London Civil Defence Region and 169 in other places, including Southampton on July 7 and one as far north as Manchester.\nThe British intelligence services (Secret Intelligence Service and Air Ministry’s Scientific Intelligence Office) were monitoring German rocket artillery research and information received by bugging high-ranking German prisoners-of-war increased focus on activities at Peenemunde.\nIn response to discussions by the vice-chiefs of staff on the subject of German long range rocket developments, in April 1943 Duncan Sandys was given the responsibility of investigating how far Germany had progressed. Under the codename Bodyline, investigations by SIS, the Combined Services Detailed Interrogation Centre, and the Photographic Reconnaissance Unit were able to confirm existence of rocketry activities at Peenemunde and Sandys reported his findings to the chiefs of staff that the Germans were developing rockets, were probably well-advanced and countermeasures should be studied\n\nThe Bodyline Scientific Committee (19 members, including Duncan Sandys, Edward Victor Appleton, John Cockcroft, Robert Watson-Watt) was formed in September 1943 regarding the suspected V-2 rocket. After the 1944 crash of a test V-2 in Sweden, \"transmitters to jam the guidance system of the rocket\" were prepared. A British sound-ranging system provided \"trajectory [data] from which the general launching area could be determined\", and the microphone(s) in East Kent reported the times of the first V-2 strikes on September 8, 1944: 18:40:52 and 18:41:08.\n\nIn November 1943, the Bodyline committee handed over the tasks to the Air Ministry as the extent of the issue became clear.\n\nOn March 21, 1945, the Pile's plan for the \"Engagement of Long Range Rockets with AA Gunfire\" which called for anti-aircraft units to fire into a radar-predicted airspace to intercept the V-2 was ready, but the plan was not used due to the danger of shells falling on Greater London.\n\nUnlike the V-1 which was of comparable speed to a fighter, the velocity and trajectory of a V-2 made aircraft interception an impossibility. Happenstance instances of Allied aircraft encountering launched V-2 rockets include: October 29, 1944, Lieutenants Donald A. Schultz and Charles M. Crane in a Lockheed P-38 Lightning attempted to photograph a launched V-2 above the trees near the River Rhine, January 1, 1945, a 4th Fighter Group pilot aloft over the northern flightpath for attacking elements of five German fighter wings on \"Unternehmen Bodenplatte\" that day, observed a V-2 \"act up for firing near Lochem ... the rocket was immediately tilted from 85 deg. to 30 deg\", and on February 14, 1945, a No. 602 Squadron RAF Spitfire Mk XVI pilot, Raymond Baxter's colleague \"Cupid\" Love, fired at a V-2 just after launch.\n\nAfter the last combat V-2 launch on March 27, 1945, the British discontinued their use of radar in the defence region to detect V-2 launches on April 13.\n\n\n\n"}

From a large family, he worked on a ranch then enlisted in the U.S. Army at age 18 in 1917. After two years in the service, he attended the University of Oregon in Eugene on a football scholarship, and was a halfback for the Ducks. Jordan graduated in 1923, and was awarded a key to Phi Beta Kappa. He married classmate Grace Edington on December 30, 1924. \nJordan was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army during World War I, but did not serve overseas. After college, he was a sheep rancher in Hells Canyon in Idaho during the Great Depression at Kirkwood Bar, and then settled in Grangeville in 1940, where he established a farm implement business, a real estate agency, and an automobile dealership.\n\nJordan was elected to the state senate in 1946, lost his seat in 1948.\n\nJordan successfully ran for governor in 1950.\n\nDuring his four-year term, slot machines were banned; employment, unemployment, and job training services were merged; and the state highway commission was initiated. Jordan did not run for re-election in 1954 because it was not allowed at the time. Starting with the 1946 election, Idaho changed from two-year to four-year terms for governor, but disallowed self-succession (re-election). Jordan's successor as governor was the former attorney general, Robert Smylie, who successfully lobbied the 1955 legislature to propose an amendment to the state constitution to allow gubernatorial re-election, which was approved by voters in the 1956 general election. (Smylie was re-elected in 1958 and 1962, and sought a fourth term in 1966, but was defeated in the primary.)\n\nIn 1955, Jordan was appointed by President Eisenhower as Chairman of the United States section of the International Joint Commission with Canada.\n\nIn August 1962, Jordan was appointed to the U.S. Senate by Governor Smylie, following the death of Henry Dworshak in July. In November, Jordan defeated Democratic congresswoman Gracie Pfost of Nampa in the special election to complete the remaining four years of the term.\n\nHe was re-elected in 1966, defeating former congressman Ralph Harding of Blackfoot.\n\nIn the Senate, Jordan helped Frank Church establish the Sawtooth National Recreation Area in 1972, and voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1968, as well as the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall to the U.S. Supreme Court. He also voted in favor of the Equal Rights Amendment.\n\nIn August 1971, Jordan announced that he would not seek re-election in 1972, and was succeeded by Jim McClure, the three-term Republican congressman from the first district. At age 73, Jordan was the first from Idaho to voluntarily retire from the U.S. Senate.\n\nA state office building in Boise, near the state capitol, was named for him in December 1973.. Jordan died at age 84 in Boise on June 30, 1983, and his wife died two years later. They are interred at Cloverdale Memorial Park in west Boise.\n\nDaughter Patricia (1927–2010) married Charles F.

He played in Major League Baseball for the New York Yankees (1952–1960), Kansas City Athletics (1960–1961), Chicago White Sox (1961), and Los Angeles Dodgers (1962).\n\nCarey was born on October 18, 1931, as Andrew Arthur Hexem in Oakland, California, and raised in Alameda, California. His parents divorced when he was young, and his mother remarried Kenneth Carey, a divorce lawyer. Carey later took his adopted father's name.\n\nCarey attended Alameda High School, where he played as a pitcher and third baseman for the school's baseball team. He graduated in 1949, and rather than sign a professional baseball contract, attended Saint Mary's College of California. Carey made Saint Mary's college baseball team as a freshman. He also played semi-professional baseball in Weiser, Idaho, where he caught the attention of New York Yankees scout Joe Devine.\n\nCarey signed with the Yankees, receiving a $60,000 signing bonus. He made his major league debut with the Yankees in 1952. By 1954, Carey was the Yankees' starting third baseman. That year, he had a .302 batting average and 65 runs batted in (RBIs) in 122 games played. In 1955, Carey led the American League with 11 triples. While playing for the Yankees in the 1956 World Series, Carey twice helped preserve Don Larsen's perfect game against the Dodgers on October 8, 1956. In the second inning, the Dodgers’ Jackie Robinson smacked a shot between third and short that Carey knocked down, allowing shortstop Gil McDougald to pick up the ball and nip Robinson at first. In the eighth, he robbed Gil Hodges by snaring a low line drive that seemed headed for left field.\n\nCarey played for the Yankees into the 1960 season. By this point, the emergence of Clete Boyer as the Yankees third baseman led them to trade Carey after four games to the Kansas City Athletics for Bob Cerv.\n\nIn June 1961, the Athletics traded Carey, Larsen, Ray Herbert, and Al Pilarcik to the Chicago White Sox for Wes Covington, Stan Johnson, Bob Shaw, and Gerry Staley. After the 1961 season, the White Sox traded Carey with Frank Barnes to the Philadelphia Phillies for Taylor Phillips and Bob Sadowski. However, Carey refused to report to Philadelphia, and the White Sox sent Cal McLish to the Phillies to compensate them. The White Sox then traded Carey to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Ramon Conde and Jim Koranda before the 1962 season. The Dodgers released Carey after the 1962 season.\n\nIn an 11-year career, he had a .260 batting average, with 64 home runs, and 350 RBIs. He had 741 career hits. He finished his career with 38 triples.\n\nAfter he retired, Carey worked as a stockbroker for Mitchum, Jones, and Templeton in Los Angeles.\n\nCarey married four times, and was divorced three times.

{"id": "1869270", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1869270", "title": "Mission of Gravity", "text": "Mission of Gravity\n\nMission of Gravity is a science fiction novel by American writer Hal Clement. The novel was serialized in \"Astounding Science Fiction\" magazine in April–July 1953. Its first hardcover book publication was in 1954, and it was first published as a paperback book in 1958. Along with the novel, many editions (and most recent editions) of the book also include \"Whirligig World\", an essay by Clement on creating the planet Mesklin that was first published in the June 1953 \"Astounding\".\n\nClement published three sequels to \"Mission of Gravity\": a 1970 novel called \"Star Light\", a 1973 short story called \"Lecture Demonstration\", and a 2000 short story, \"Under\". \"Mission of Gravity\" was nominated for a \"Retro-Hugo\" Award for the year 1954.\n\nThe story is set on a highly oblate planet named Mesklin, which has surface gravity that varies between 700 \"g\" at the poles and 3 \"g\" at the equator. The story is told from the points of view of one of the local intelligent life forms and a human explorer. The locals are centipede-like, in order to withstand the enormous gravity, and terrified of even small heights, because in 700 \"g\", even a tiny fall is fatal. (See Mesklin for a more comprehensive description of the planet's characteristics.)\n\nThe native protagonist, Barlennan, captain of the sailing raft \"Bree\", is on a trading expedition to the equator. Prior to the story's opening, a human scientific probe has become stranded at one of the planet's poles, where the gravity is too strong to effect a rescue. A member of the scientific team, Charles Lackland, is dispatched to the equator where he has met Barlennan by chance. Even machine aided, Lackland is barely able to function in the 3 gee environment, one Barlennan considers incredibly light and a tiny fraction of what his culture is used to.\n\nLackland teaches the \"Bree\" crew English and arranges a deal with Barlennan; in exchange for the humans providing warnings of the violent weather which often plagues trips to the pole, Barlennan will retrieve the probe and return it to the equator where it can be picked up. Communication is achieved through an audio-visual radio built to function in a high-gravity environment, which is treated as magical by other intelligences encountered on the planet.\n\nAlong the way to the pole, the ship encounters and overcomes a variety of obstacles, some of which the humans help with using their superior scientific knowledge, and some of which rely on the cunning of Barlennan and his crew. They are captured by various lifeforms similar to themselves, but who live in the lower-gravity areas and have developed projectile weapons and gliders. Gradually, with human help, they gain an understanding of these and manage to escape.\n\nBarlennan has been dissatisfied with the humans' efforts to seemingly avoid explanation of anything scientific, and almost withholds the probe when they finally reach it; but the humans convince them that a scientific background is needed to understand the advanced equipment in the probe, and a deal is reached whereby the humans will educate the Mesklinites.\n\nThe novel provides an exposition on how the weather, geology and atmosphere of the seas and the pole are affected by the local conditions, and sees the Mesklinites overcoming their fear of gravity as they learn to view it scientifically, eventually harnessing aerodynamics to make the \"Bree\" fly at the poles.\n\n\"Mission\" was the runner-up for the 1955 International Fantasy Award for fiction. Boucher and McComas found \"Mission\" \"compact and unified, with a good deal of adventurous excitement\" and characterized it as \"a splendid specimen of \"science\" fiction in the grandest of grand manners.\"\n\nWayne Barlowe illustrated the Mesklinites in his \"Barlowe's Guide to Extraterrestrials\".\n\nIt is most often praised for the thoroughness and care with which Clement designed and described Mesklin — even today, it is considered one of the definitive examples of worldbuilding. Although Clement has stated that his original calculations concerning the polar gravity of Mesklin were inaccurate — he later estimated the polar gravity should have been approximately 250 g instead of 700 — the exploration of what existence might be like in such extreme conditions is detailed, convincing, and persuasive. The novel is frequently invoked in discussions of the sense of wonder, the sensation of dawning comprehension and understanding of a larger context for a given experience, that many readers of science fiction point to as the reason why they pursue the genre.\n\nThe personalities of Clement's alien characters have been criticized as being \"too human\" or not \"alien enough\", as failing to be, in the words of John W. Campbell \"something that thinks \"as well\" as a man, but not \"like\" a man\".\n\n"}

Al-Tamimi has been described as \"arguably the first American born activist Salafi preacher.\"\n\nAl-Tamimi grew up in the metropolitan Washington area. His father, a lawyer, worked at the Iraqi embassy, and his mother was a psychologist. Knowing the family personally, journalist Milton Viorst, who talks of how his father got a M.A. in law at George Washington University \"in his free time\", and says of his mother that \"she took pride in telling me that she had acquired three master’s degrees and a Ph.D. in psychology\", also describes the family as \"not particularly ethnic or religious\" : like other Americans, they celebrated Halloween and Christmas, while Ali was into sports, but it all changed in 1978, when he was 15, as his family moved to Saudi Arabia because his father wanted to reconnect with his Arab-Islamic roots, and where Ali himself became interested in Islam, learning its basics while before he didn't even knew Muslims pray towards Mecca. On returning to the U.S. two years later, he attended The George Washington University and the University of Maryland, College Park. In 2004 he received a doctorate in computational biology from George Mason University on the topic of \"Chaos and Complexity in Cancer\". Al-Tamimi pursued Islamic studies, where he became influenced by Islamist thinkers like Sayyid Qutb, Safar Al-Hawali and Muhammad Surur, before returning to the United States. \n\nAli Al-Tamimi worked at an IT company named Xpedior, Inc. Clients he provided service to included America Online (AOL). He reportedly worked for two months for Andrew Card, former Chief of Staff (2000–2006) of the George W. Bush Whitehouse, while Card was Secretary of Transportation under George H. Bush (1992–93). In the early 1990s, Al-Tamimi led a five-person delegation from the Islamic Assembly of North America in the United Nations 4th World Conference on Women, held in Beijing, China. Al-Tamimi contacted Shaikh Abdel Rahaman Abdel Khaliq, who wrote a book about women in Islam, which Al-Tamimi translated into English. He was a lecturer at the Center for Islamic Information and Education in Falls Church, Virginia. He was a founding member of the Center, which is also known as Dar al-Arqam. In late 2002, the then-former Dar al-Hijrah imam Anwar al-Awlaki visited al-Timimi and inquired about recruiting men for \"violent jihad.\". But Al-Timimi became suspicious of al-Awlaki's motives believing it to be an entrapment attempt and asked al-Awlaki to leave.\n\nPrior to al-Tamimi's prosecution, nine members of the Virginia Jihad Network were convicted on charges related to their participation in a terrorist enterprise, including engaging in paramilitary training. Tamimi had been named as an unindicted co-conspirator in that case. According to court papers, he said on September 16, 2001, that his followers should \"go abroad and join the mujaheddin engaged in violent jihad in Afghanistan.\" Many attendees at that meeting began military training both in the United States and in terrorist training camps overseas.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the Virginia Jihad Network trials, prosecutors tried al-Tamimi for encouraging the Virginia Jihad Network wage \"jihad\" in India and the U.S. The case before U.S. District (Eastern District of Virginia) Judge Leonie M. Brinkema was on 10 counts, including enlisting people to wage war against the United States and providing services to the Taliban. Al-Tamimi's defense lawyers argued his case was an attack on the freedom of speech and religious freedom, arguing that their client only told young Muslims that it might be better to emigrate from the United States to better practice their faith.\n\nThe jury convicted him on all 10 counts after a week of deliberation in April 2005. He was sentenced on July 14, 2005, to life imprisonment. In sentencing him, Judge Brinkema said \"I don't think any well-read person can doubt the truth that terrorist camps are a crucial part of the new terrorism that is perpetrated in the world today. People of good will need to do whatever they can to stop that.\"\n\nJonathan Turley, handling the appeal, argued together with dozens of Muslims convicted of terror charges, that al-Timimi's wiretaps were illegal. This was one of a series of cases challenging the NSA warrantless surveillance. The appeal also alleged mistreatment in prison and denial of access to counsel. The appeals court did not rule on the merits of the appeal, but sent the case back to federal court for a rehearing, with broad latitude given to the trial judge. The Justice department did not confirm or deny the use of NSA wiretaps against al-Timimi.\n\nIn September 2015, the Fourth Circuit court remanded the terrorism case on the grounds that \"the FBI withheld evidence of its 2002 investigation into the first American on the CIA's kill or capture list, Anwar al-Awlaki\".\n"}

A member of the Von Erich Family, Von Erich is best known for his appearances with his father's World Class Championship Wrestling promotion.\n\nKevin Adkisson played football at North Texas State University as a fullback, second string to Garry Smith, until an injury ended his football career and dream of playing in the National Football League.\n\nKevin started wrestling as Kevin Von Erich in 1976. He spent most of his career wrestling for his father's promotion, World Class Championship Wrestling. Kevin's natural athletic ability and good looks made him one of the promotion's biggest stars. He achieved great success in the company both as a singles and tag team wrestler, often participating in many of the company's high-profile feuds. Kevin was also known for wrestling barefoot, highly unusual in a sport where almost all wrestlers wear high-topped boots. World Class announcers often jokingly referred to him as \"The Barefoot Boy\" on WCCW broadcasts. Kevin later admitted in an interview that he never set out to wrestle barefoot, but that before one of his matches someone hid his boots as a joke, and he wasn't able to find them before his match, so just went out barefoot to wrestle, and it later became his trademark. Contrary to popular belief, he wore boots in matches in his early career, including his debut match against Paul Perschmann aka Playboy Buddy Rose and in a match against Superfly Jimmy Snuka. Kevin was a big fan of Snuka's, who also wrestled barefoot, and Kevin often performed a moved similar to Snuka's flying body splash from the top rope, which Snuka calls \"The Superfly\".\n\nDuring the late 70s, Kevin established himself in the Dallas territory. His first major success came in 1978 while wrestling as a tag team with his younger brother David. During the year, they captured the NWA Texas Tag Team Championship on two occasions as well as the NWA American Tag Team Championship. On Christmas Day 1978, he established himself firmly in the singles ranks of the promotion by defeating Bruiser Brody for the NWA American Heavyweight Championship. In 1980, Kevin Von Erich made his only wrestling appearance in the WWF on January 21 against Johnny Rodz, in a match he won. As the 1980s dawned, Kevin became one of the promotion's most viable performers and continued to win numerous championships in both singles and tag team competition with a variety of different partners. However, his highest profile partners would always be his brothers Kerry and David.\n\nAs the early-1980s progressed, Kevin would appear often at other NWA-promoted territories, including St. Louis, Georgia Championship Wrestling and briefly Florida Championship Wrestling. Kevin also competed in a few matches for the World Wide Wrestling Federation.\n\nIn early 1982, the Fabulous Freebirds, consisting of Michael Hayes, Terry Gordy and Buddy Roberts, left Georgia Championship Wrestling after meeting WCCW booker Gary Hart at a show. Appearing in World Class, the trio instantly became fan favorites due to a combination of their unique talents and chemistry as well as their close friendship with the Von Erichs. All three rose quickly through the ranks and in late November 1982, Hayes and Gordy defeated the team of King Kong Bundy and Wild Bill Irwin for the NWA American Tag Team Championship.\n\nA feud between the Von Erichs and Freebirds developed roughly a month later. During WCCW's annual Christmas show in 1982, Kerry Von Erich faced Ric Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship inside of a steel cage with Michael Hayes acting as a special referee. As explained in \"The Triumph and Tragedy of World Class Championship Wrestling\" DVD, the storyline, developed by Gary Hart, was written as Hayes having been selected by fans to be a special enforcer type of referee in the match. Near the end of the match, Flair shoved Hayes, which resulted in Hayes punching him. Hayes then tried to place Kerry on top of Flair to make the three count. Von Erich refused to do so since it wasn't the \"Texas thing to do\", which led to a brief shoving match and argument between the two. Hayes, disgusted with the situation, told Terry Gordy, who had been assigned as the gatekeeper, to open the cage door. As Hayes is about to leave Von Erich was attacked from behind by Ric Flair, with the former accidentally hitting Hayes and knocking him out of the cage. The angle was written as having neither Hayes nor Gordy being aware that Kerry was shoved into Hayes. As Kerry was getting to his feet inside the ring, that was the signal for Gordy to slam the cage door shut, hitting Kerry on the head and costing him the championship.\n\nThe Freebirds immediately became the top heels in the company, due to the belief of many fans that their actions cost one of their local heroes the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. As the feud was building, the WCCW television broadcasts were syndicated to television stations all across the United States, giving the promotion millions of viewers each week in the U.S. alone. This changed the face of wrestling and how it was marketed and presented to audiences. The extremely physical nature of the matches between the two factions captivated fans, changing preconceptions about what professional wrestling was and could be. Throughout the next several years, the Freebirds and Von Erichs engaged in numerous high-profile matches that were very physical in nature with the various members of each group feuding over various championships within the promotion. The feud is seen today by many fans and wrestling industry insiders as one of the best worked and most memorable feuds in the history of professional wrestling. This line of drama ended, when Kevin's brother David von Erich, died in Japan from acute enteritis of the upper intestine. This broke up the symmetry of the wrestling rivalry, though eventually the remaining brothers went on to wrestle individually, with varying degrees of success.\n\nKevin also had a long feud with Chris Adams that lasted for months and had many violent matches, including two well-known chair shots on each other that required hospitalization for both men. Kevin would also tag-team with Adams on numerous occasions before and after their feud. Away from the ring, Kevin and Chris were close friends; Kevin served as a pallbearer during Adams' funeral in 2001 and traveled to England to visit Adams' family afterwards. In recent interviews, Kevin stated that Adams was the toughest wrestler he's ever wrestled in his career and he showed a great amount of respect for the British-born wrestler.\n\nKevin had several close matches with NWA World Champ Ric Flair, including the main event of the 2nd David Von Erich Memorial Parade of Champions at Texas Stadium, but never won the title.\n\nAfter the failure of SuperClash III, in 1989, Kevin became very despondent over his father's decision to sell the promotion to Jerry Jarrett, who owned the Memphis-based CWA, despite his brother Kerry welcoming Jarrett into the mix; the merged promotions became the USWA. However, because of disputes, including suing Jarrett himself, he pulled WCCW out of the USWA in 1990, but he couldn't resurrect the promotion his father built and had no choice but shut down World Class that November. Kevin did manage to draw crowds to the Sportatorium in the early going, but with the absence of his brother, manager/booker Gary Hart, and the lack of televised matches, World Class' survival was very thin.\n\nDuring that time, Kevin competed very little; other than wrestling in other independent cards promoted by either himself, Chris Adams or Gary Hart. Kevin did not participate at all in the August 4, 1989 card in which World Class formally became USWA Texas, while brother Kerry, who competed on the card earlier, reportedly left the Sportatorium shortly after his match. Kevin however did help out a young Steve Austin increase his abilities in the ring during this time, and considers Austin as one of his friends to this day.\n\nSixteen months after his brother joined the World Wrestling Federation, Kevin wrestled a dark match on December 2, 1991 at a Wrestling Challenge taping in Corpus Christi, TX where he faced and defeated Brian Lee.\n\nVon Erich competed in Mexico's Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre in 1991.\n\nOn April 2, 1993 he teamed up with Chris Adams to defeat Fabulous Freebirds' Michael Hayes and Buddy Roberts at Global Wrestling Federation's Adkisson Benefit Show at the Sportatorium.\n\nKevin's last round of glory occurred on January 7, 1995 while competing for Jim Crockett, Jr.'s NWA promotion based at the Sportatorium; where he won the North American heavyweight title defeating Greg Valentine. A week later he dropped the title to John Hawk. He then formed a very brief alliance with manager Skandor Akbar. Kevin eventually cut back on his ring appearances and formally retired by the end of 1995.\n\nAt 60 years of age, Von Erich returned to wrestling for the first time in 22 years on July 9, 2017. He teamed with his sons Ross and Marshall as they defeated Marty Jannetty, Jumping Lee and Gery Roif at Los Angeles Wrestling in Tel Aviv, Israel.\n\nOn October 3, 2005, Kevin made an appearance on the WWE Raw Homecoming show alongside other WWE Hall of Famers. Later that night, as Dusty Rhodes and the WWE Hall of Famers were gathered in the ring, Rob Conway came out and interrupted Rhodes. This eventually led to Conway's beatdown by several Hall of Famers, in which Kevin used the legendary Iron Claw on Conway, to the raves of the partisan Dallas, Texas crowd. Jim Ross said afterwards that he never thought he would live to see the Iron Claw again.\n\nOn January 20, 2006, Kevin and his son Ross Adkisson (billed as Ross Von Erich) appeared on a local wrestling card in Longview, Texas as guests of Roddy Piper's \"Piper's Pit\". During the segment, in which Kevin and Piper talked about going to the Sportatorium as teenagers, Skandor Akbar interrupted the interview to berate both Kevin and Ross. At one point, Akbar pushed Ross, which prompted Kevin to apply the iron claw on Akbar. Greg Valentine then pulled Akbar away, with Kevin, Ross, Piper and The Grappler taking in the cheers of the crowd.\n\nIn 2006, Kevin, and a number of others from World Class Championship Wrestling's heyday, participated in \"Heroes of World Class Wrestling\", an independently produced retrospective documentary about the promotion and the Von Erich family. The documentary featured comments from Adkisson, Gary Hart, Skandor Akbar, Bill Mercer, Mickey Grant, David Manning, Marc Lowrance and via earlier interviews, Chris Adams.\n\nLater that October he sold the rights to the (pre-1988) WCCW name and tape archives to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). WWE subsequently began broadcasting WCCW's syndicated programming on their subscription video on demand service WWE Classics On Demand with Kevin and Michael \"P.S.\" Hayes acting as hosts and later included WCCW footage on the WWE Network. WWE produced \"The Triumph and Tragedy of World Class\", their own documentary on the territory in 2007. Kevin was also featured in the 2007 WWE produced DVD \"The Most Powerful Families in Wrestling\" in a segment on the Von Erich family.\n\nOn April 4, 2009, Kevin represented the Von Erich family as they were inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by Michael Hayes.\n\nOn June 15, 2014, at Slammiversary, Kevin accompanied his sons Ross and Marshall to the ring for a tag-team match.\n\nOn April 2, 2016 Kevin appeared at the WWE Hall of Fame ceremony to discuss his relationship with The Fabulous Freebirds.\n\nIn July 2017 Kevin, along with his two sons Marshall and Ross, wrestled at the \"Rage Megashow\" in Israel.\n\nHe has been married since August 1, 1980 to Pam Adkisson. They currently live in Hawaii and run a family investment business together. Kevin also dabbles in commercial real estate, and owns the rights to \"Southwest Sports\" (the distributor of \"World Class Championship Wrestling\"), which was later renamed \"K.R. Adkisson Enterprises\". Together they have four children; Kristen Rain (born February 3, 1981), Jillian Lindsey (born February 10, 1985), David Michael Ross (born June 1, 1988), and Kevin Marshall (born November 11, 1992). He and Pam have 8 grandchildren as well. Kristen and Joseph Nikolas, her husband, have one daughter, Adeline Claire, twin sons Eli and Rush, and sons Abram and Josiah.\n\nKevin is the last surviving son of wrestler Fritz Von Erich and had four brothers who wrestled, David, Kerry, Mike and Chris, as well as an older brother, Jack, who died in 1959.\n\nAdkisson, as Kevin Von Erich, appears in the video games \"Legends of Wrestling\", \"Legends of Wrestling II\", \"\" , \"WWE 2K17\" and \"WWE 2K18\".\n\n\n\n"}

The Prince was chairman of the \"Central Civil Committee\" (Centralny Komitet Obywatelski) in 1915. From 1916 to 1917 mayor of Warsaw. He was an activist of the \"Real Politics Party\" (Stronnictwo Polityki Realnej) and from 1917 to 1918 member of the Regency Council. From 1928 until 1935 member of the Senate and chairman of the \"Council of Landowner Organisations\" from 1931 to 1935.\n\nIn 1893, Lubomirski married Maria née Branicki, with whom he had three children: daughters Julia Maria (born 1894) and Dorota (born 1904), and son Jerzy Aleksander (born 1896). Together with his wife, he lived in a house in Warsaw district of Frascati, and in a family real estate located in the village of Mala Wies, near Grójec.\n\nZdzislaw Lubomirski was born on April 4, 1865 in the Russian city of Nizhny Novgorod. He was the son of Prince Jan Tadeusz Lubomirski, and Maria née Zamoyska. Since his patriotic parents wanted their son to be raised in a Polish spirit, as a child he was sent to Austrian Galicia, where he attended Kraków's St. Anna High School. In 1883–1887, Lubomirski studied law at Jagiellonian University and University of Graz.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Lubomirski became a well-known public figure in partitioned Poland, due to his charity work. In 1904, he became a deputy chairman of Warsaw Association of Charity, and a curator of the Ophthalmic Institute, which provided free eye exams for the poor. Since official education in Russian-controlled Congress Poland was carried out in the Russian language, Lubomirski helped with founding Polish language schools and libraries. He co-founded administrative and organizational foundations of the future Polish education system. He co-created an organization called Spojnia Narodowa (National Unity; 1905), and participated in meetings of teachers – members of Association of National Education.\n\nDuring World War I, the prince continued his charity activities. Among others, he was chairman of such bodies, as Committee of Support of Social Work, Polish Sanitary Help Committee, and Temporary Self-Help of Landowners. On August 3, 1914, Lubomirski became a member of Civic Committee of the City of Warsaw. Since Russian oversight of this body was almost non-existent, the Civic Committee enjoyed wide autonomy. His activities were highly praised by residents of Warsaw. \n\nIn August 1915, during the Great Retreat, the armies of the German Empire entered Warsaw. Lubomirski refused to leave the city, and with permission of German authorities, he was named chairman of the Central Civil Committee. Under his leadership, a network of Polish language schools was created, and Lubomirski served as a mediator between Polish residents and German government (the Committee was later renamed into Central Welfare Council). In order to win maximum autonomy for Poland, Lubomirski cooperated with the Germans. At the same time, he tried to democratize political life of the country. On July 16, 1916, with permission of German authorities, elections for Warsaw local government took place, after which Lubomirski became the mayor of the city. On December 13, 1916, Lubomirski for the first time met with Józef Piłsudski, offering him a post in the future Polish government.\n\nOn November 5, 1916, the emperors of Germany and Austria-Hungary issued the so-called Act of 5th November, in which they promised an independent Polish state (see also Kingdom of Poland (1916–18)). A year later, on September 16, 1917, the Germans created a provisional government of Poland, the Regency Council, led by Prince Lubomirski, one of its three members along with Archbishop Aleksander Kakowski, and Józef Ostrowski. The Council had its first meeting at Warsaw's Royal Castle on October 27, 1917.\n\nOn October 7, 1918, on initiative of Prince Lubomirski, Polish declaration of independence was announced. Seven days later, first Polish Army soldiers pledged allegiance to the Polish flag. Lubomirski himself regarded Józef Piłsudski as an excellent politician and statesman, and supported Pilsudski's nomination for the post of the head of state (see Naczelnik Panstwa). On November 10, 1918, Lubomirski welcomed Pilsudski at Warsaw's Rail Station, and four days later, Pilsudski became the head of Polish state.\n\nIn the early 1920s Lubomirski stayed away from political life. He decided to return to politics after the May Coup. On May 13, 1926 he talked with Pilsudski at Warsaw East Rail Station. Soon afterwards, he was among four men considered for the post of President of Poland, but refused to accept the nomination. In 1928–1935, Lubomirski was a senator of Nonpartisan Bloc for Cooperation with the Government, and a chairman of two Senate commissions – foreign affairs and military. He frequently participated in different international events, such as 1929 funeral of Marshal Ferdinand Foch.\n\nIn 1930, Lubomirski resigned from the Senate in protest against the Brest trials, but Prime Minister Walery Slawek did not accept the resignation. Lubomirski disliked the so-called colonels’ regime, and in the late 1930s, he organized several secret meetings, in which political situation of the Second Polish Republic was discussed. The sanacja government was aware of it, and blocked Lubomirski's run for Senate election in 1938. Meanwhile, Lubomirski continued his charity activities, as member of several civic organizations.\n\nIn September 1939, during the Siege of Warsaw, Lubomirski actively participated in the Civic Committee, headed by Stefan Starzynski. In the early months of German occupation of Poland, he worked on creating an underground government under General Juliusz Rómmel, in which he was to be foreign minister. It was never created, as Polish leaders decided to open the government-in-exile, first in Paris and since summer 1940, in London. Lubomirski decided to stay in occupied Poland. On November 10, 1942 he was arrested by the Gestapo, and spent two months in prison. During this time, his health deteriorated, and he never recovered. Lubomirski died on July 31, 1943 in his real estate in Mała Wieś near Grójec. He was buried in a parish church at Bielsko Duże.\n"}

He spent most of his life in Connemara and died in poverty in about the year 1820.\n\nCong was the filming location for John Ford's 1952 Oscar-winning film, \"The Quiet Man\", featuring John Wayne, Maureen O'Hara and Barry Fitzgerald. Much of the film was filmed on the grounds of Ashford Castle. The town and castle area remain little changed since 1952, and Cong's connection with the movie make it a tourist attraction. (The film is still celebrated by the local \"Quiet Man Fan Club\").\n\nRoman Catholic records for Cong do not survive from before 1870. Church of Ireland records from the 18th and 19th centuries have survived, however, and are held at the South Mayo Family Research Centre in nearby Ballinrobe.\n\n Cong is the home of Ashford Castle, a luxury hotel, which was converted from a Victorian faux lakeside castle, built by the Guinness family. Ashford Castle is a tourist attraction in its own right. Cong also features a ruined medieval abbey, Cong Abbey, where Rory O'Connor, the last High King of Ireland, spent his last years. It also is the origin of a piece of Celtic art in the form of a metal cross shrine called the Cross of Cong. The 'Cross of Cong' is now held in the National Museum of Ireland, Dublin. There is a High Cross in the village.\n\nThe Cong Canal, built over five years by the Commissioners of Public Works between 1848 and 1854 as a combined scheme to provide navigation, drainage and mill-power. In 1854 the Commissioners abandoned the navigation aspect of the scheme and instructed Samuel Roberts, their engineer, \"to suspend the execution of all navigation works in this division of the district, and complete only such as were necessary for the regulation of the waters of Lough Mask, for drainage purposes.\" Now it is commonly known as the \"Dry Canal\"; the water level can vary between zero and 3.5 meters depending on the time of year (summer dry, winter full) and is 5 km in length. Built heritage features of the canal remain.\n\nFrom the Annals of Tigernach, Annals of Connacht, the Annals of the Four Masters:\n\n\n"}

The business was started by David John Beal. The mail order department was in the basement. John employed the services of a child psychologist to ensure that the toys and books were of a positive and educational value to children. \n\nThe clever and unique concept was for parents to join as a member, new sets of educational toys/books were then sent to them regularly. If they decided to keep the items, they would pay via their account.

The Minister heads the Te Puni Kōkiri (TPK, or the Ministry of Māori Development). Between 1947 and 2014 the position was called Minister of Māori Affairs; before that it was known as Minister of Native Affairs. As of 2017, The current Minister for Māori Development is Nanaia Mahuta.\n\nThe role of the Minister for Māori Development differs somewhat from those of other ministers. While the Minister for Māori Development does have a government department to supervise (Te Puni Kōkiri, TPK for short, or the Ministry of Māori Development), he or she also has input into other portfolios to the extent that they affect Māori. For example, the Minister for Māori Development would expect to be involved in the development of Māori language policy in the education portfolio, even though education is normally the sole responsibility of the Minister of Education.\n\nThe office was originally called Minister of Native Affairs, or simply Native Minister. Most early Ministers of Native Affairs were not Māori, although a convention existed that there should be Māori in Cabinet (albeit without portfolio). Prior to the implementation of responsible government, Māori affairs (specifically the purchase of land from Māori by the Crown) had been handled by the Governor.\n\nAttitudes of early Ministers were varied. The first Minister, William Richmond, considered Māori to be savages, and believed that his task was to \"reform\" Māori by making them more like Europeans. He was particularly hostile to Māori tradition of shared land ownership, considering it \"beastly communism\". Other Ministers were more friendly to Māori interests — James FitzGerald, the sixth Minister, believed that peaceful co-existence with Māori was vital, and considered the confiscation of Māori land to be an \"enormous crime\". Other Ministers have varied between these positions.\n\nThe first Minister of Native Affairs to be ethnically Māori was James Caroll, appointed by the Liberal Party in the late 19th century. Another prominent Minister of Native Affairs was Āpirana Ngata, also of the Liberals. For the most part, however, early Ministers were Pākehā, although were frequently advised by Māori colleagues. Maui Pomare of the Reform Party and Eruera Tirikatene of the Labour Party were examples of politicians who played a major role in the portfolio without actually holding office. After Caroll and Ngata, it was not until Matiu Rata (1972–1975) that there was another ethnically Māori Minister of Māori Affairs.\nUnder the Maori Purposes Act 1947, the Ministerial title and all other government usage was changed from 'Native' to 'Maori'.\n\nIn modern times, the tendency has been for the major parties to have Māori as their Māori Affairs spokespeople (and thus as Minister) when possible. The Labour Party has consistently had Māori in this role since the 1970s, while the National Party has had a mixture of Māori and Pākehā.\n\nAfter the 2014 general election cabinet reshuffle, the title was changed from Minister of Māori Affairs to Minister for Māori Development. While Prime Minister John Key said that there was not really any difference in what the portfolio would involve, \"it gives you a sense of where the minister [Flavell] will want to shape the portfolio\". During the 2014-2017 term of the Fifth National Government, Te Ururoa Flavell served as the Minister for Māori Development.\n\nFollowing the formation of the Sixth Labour Government, Nanaia Mahuta was appointed as Minister for Māori Development.\n\nThe table below lists ministers who have held responsibility for Māori issues. Initially, the title used was Minister of Native Affairs, but the title was changed to Minister of Maori Affairs on 17 December 1947 and then to Minister of Māori Affairs with the insertion of the macron in modern orthography under the Māori Language Commission. In 2014, the title was changed for a fourth time to Minister for Māori Development.\n\n\n"}

This cultured milk beverage is the results of microbial action of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and a surface-growing yeast-like fungus \"Geotrichum candidum\" present in milk, which forms a velvet-like surface on viili. In addition, most traditional viili cultures also contain yeast strains such as \"Kluveromyces marxianus\" and \"Pichia fermentans\". The lactic acid bacteria identified in viili include the acid‐producing \"Lactococcus lactis\" subsp. \"lactis\" and \"L. l. cremoris\" as well as the aroma producers \"L. lactis\" subsp. \"lactis\" biovar \"diacetylactis\" and \"Leuconostoc mesenteroides\". Among those mesophilic LAB strains, the slime-forming \"Lc. lactis\" subsp. \"cremoris\" produce a phosphate-containing heteropolysaccharide, named viilian. Viilian is similar to kefiran produced by kefir grains. The production of exopolysaccharides (EPS) by the strain forms the consistency character of viili and it has been claimed to have various functional benefits toward the rheological properties of milk products and the health improving potential.\n\nIn modern practice, pasteurized milk is used, fermentation is carried out in a dairy plant in controlled conditions using laboratory-grown cultures and the product sold fresh. Viili is widely available in Finland in grocery stores in several variants.\n\nSeveral variants of fermented milk products are found in Western Finland and Sweden, such as filmjölk (\"viili milk\") or långfil (\"long viili\"), which vary in consistency and fermentation. In Norway, filmjölk is usually named \"kulturmelk\" (\"cultured milk\") or \"surmelk\" (\"sour milk\"), while in Gotland and Iceland, the name \"skyr\" is used to refer to fermented yoghurt variants.\n\nCream viili (Finnish: \"kermaviili\") is made from cream instead of milk, and is used in cooking like sour cream, or with dill, chives and other spices as cold sauce for fish, or as a base for dip sauces.\n"}
{"id": "1869417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1869417", "title": "Perfect game (bowling)", "text": "Perfect game (bowling)\n\nA perfect game is the highest score possible in a game of bowling, achieved by scoring a strike in every frame. In bowling games that use 10 pins, such as ten-pin bowling, candlepin bowling, and duckpin bowling, the highest possible score is 300, achieved by bowling 12 strikes in a row in a traditional single game: one strike in each of the first nine frames, and three more in the tenth frame. Because a strike counts as ten pins plus any pinfall in the next two balls, 30 points are possible in a given frame.\n\nIn five-pin bowling, the highest possible score is 450, as a strike is worth 15 pins. It is rare to bowl or witness one. The Canadian Five Pin Bowlers Association approves from 10 to 40 perfect games per year.\n\nBefore a is recognized by the certifying body of the league or tournament, a series of tests are conducted by the local or regional bowling association. First, the bowler and league (or tournament) must be in good standing with the organization. In earlier years, the bowling ball(s) used in the scoring was taken for testing (hardness, weighting, and other aspects that would otherwise break the organization's regulations). Also, the lanes used in the scoring were shut down after the last game of the day was completed. The official then used a tape reader to test the oil condition, to make sure it met the organization's regulations. The data was then sent to the certifying body, and the score received a certification decision a few days to a few weeks later.\n\nThere are cases where the tests do not meet regulation, and therefore the score is not recognized by the organization. However, the score still counts towards the league or tournament statistics. Modern recognition is much easier; lanes are no longer shut down, balls are no longer taken and inspected. The lanes are inspected once a year, and the ball's make and serial number (USBC only requires that the ball have an engraved serial number, they do not need the actual number) are taken by a league/tournament official and reported to the certifying organization.\n\nIn league or tournament play, a certified 300 game is usually commemorated with a ring. Subsequent league 300s are denoted by setting \"chips\" or precious stones into the ring, so that skilled bowlers do not have to wear several rings. The United States Bowling Congress (USBC) offers a \"multiple\" 300 ring for an additional fee that features the number of approved 300 games for that bowler surrounded by stones. The ring can be returned to have the number changed as the bowler rolls additional perfect games.\n\nIn casual or \"open\" play, a 300 game is not recognized officially by any certifying, professional, or other organization, but may be honored by other means within the bowling center, such as a plaque, trophy, \"wall of fame\" photo, or other prize.\n\nA handful of 300 games have been broadcast on live TV. Grazio Castellano of Brooklyn, New York was the first to roll a on live television. This occurred on October 4, 1953, during an Eastern All-Star league session at Newark, New Jersey. (Castellano is a member of the United States Bowling Congress Hall of Fame.) A more recent example came in October 2006, when England's Paul Moor became the first man to register a score of 300 in the Weber Cup (the first 300 on live British television), the annual Europe versus America team challenge event. Australian Jason Belmonte became the first bowler to ever roll a 300 game in the televised finals of the World Tenpin Masters, defeating Moor in the 2007 event. Tommy Jones had shot a perfect game in each Weber Cup from 2007 to 2009. Shota Kawazoe has rolled back-to-back 300 games on live Japanese television.\n\nA bowler that bowls a perfect game on a televised PBA Tour event receives a $10,000 bonus, although occasionally there is a $1 million bonus for a bowler that bowls a 300 game in the finals of a televised PBA event. Through January 2020, there have been 27 televised 300 games in title events on the PBA Tour, and two more on the Senior PBA Tour. The first 300 game in a televised PBA event was rolled by Jack Biondolillo in the opening match of the 1967 Firestone Tournament of Champions finals (broadcast by ABC). This was also the first \"nationally\" televised broadcast of a perfect game. The most recent perfect game in a U.S. telecast of a PBA Tour event was accomplished by American Tommy Jones in the championship match of the 2020 PBA Hall of Fame Classic live finals (January 19, 2020 on Fox Sports 1), a day after he was inducted into the PBA Hall of Fame. Sean Rash rolled the PBA's 23rd and 25th 300 games, and is to date the only player with multiple televised perfect games in PBA Tour stops. Mika Koivuniemi narrowly missed joining this exclusive club. Having rolled the PBA's 16th televised perfect game in 2004, Mika shot a 299 game in the semifinals of the 2011 PBA Tournament of Champions.\n\nTwo other players have shot multiple 300 games on U.S. television, though one or both games were not rolled in an official PBA title event. In 2009, Wes Malott rolled two 300 games in an ESPN broadcast of the King of Bowling series. Though this event featured PBA players, it was not an official PBA Tour event. Ryan Shafer, who earlier in his career rolled the PBA's 18th televised 300 in a PBA Tour event, threw his second televised 300 game in a singles match at the Geico PBA Team Shootout, a made-for-TV event broadcast on ESPN, July 2, 2011. PBA Hall of Famer Chris Barnes, who rolled the PBA's 22nd televised 300 game, has also rolled live perfect games on European television (2014 QubicaAMF World Cup) and Japanese television (2015 PBA-DHC Japan Invitational).\n\nFemale bowlers have also achieved perfection in front of a television audience. Ritsuko Nakayama of the Japan Professional Bowling Association became the first female to score a perfect game in front of a national television audience, doing so in Japan on August 21, 1970. Michelle Feldman of the Professional Women's Bowling Association (PWBA) became the first female to score a 300 on American national television, when she accomplished the feat in a 1997 Prime Sports broadcast. Cara Honeychurch, Liz Johnson and Dasha Kovalova have also bowled 300 games in PWBA events on American TV. Urara Himeji, Wendy Macpherson and Takiko Naganawa have rolled 300 games on Japanese national television – all during JPBA events.\n\nAndy Varipapa, a standout bowler from the 1930s and 1940s, joked about a being twelve strikes in a row spanning two games. Hence, such a result is named after the veteran bowler.\n\n75-year-old Will June, grandfather of Cato June, became the oldest player to bowl consecutive perfect games on August 31, 2010.\n\nA \"900 series\", a three-game set with scores adding up to 900, is a more difficult feat to achieve than bowling a single perfect game because it requires more consistency and careful attention to the subtle changes in the lane conditions from game to game. The first six 900 series reported, starting with PBA Hall of Famer Glenn Allison's in 1982, were all rejected by the USBC for various reasons – mostly due to improper lane conditions. Finally, in 1997, an officially certified 900 series was bowled by collegiate bowler Jeremey Sonnenfeld, rolled at Sun Valley Lanes in Lincoln, Nebraska. It was the first 900 series approved by the USBC. Twelve perfect series were bowled in the ten-year period 1997-2008, and six were bowled in the two years 2009-2010. As of January 16, 2019, the USBC lists a total of 35 officially certified 900 series by 34 different bowlers, with Robert Mushtare the only person to roll more than one.\n\nThe concept of a perfect bowling game has been regularly used in fiction for either suspenseful or comedic effect.\n\n"}

The album was well-reviewed upon release, and is now regarded as a high point of American rock in the 1980s.\n\nThe album's title was long rumored to have been a phrase uttered by singer/guitarist J Mascis in frustration at the cramped conditions of a lengthy tour. However, Mascis has denied this story.\n\n\"Poledo\" is different from the rest of the album in that the first half is a low fidelity recording of Lou Barlow singing and playing ukulele, much like his own group Sebadoh, while the other half is a collection of sound collages and abstract noise pieces.\n\nIn 2005 the album was performed live in its entirety as part of the All Tomorrow's Parties-curated Don't Look Back series.\n\nThe album was originally issued when the band were still known as Dinosaur, before a lawsuit forced the name change to Dinosaur Jr. The album was recalled by SST a few months after release, and new copies were printed crediting the band as Dinosaur Jr. The band made a music video for the song \"Little Fury Things\" that was directed by Jim Spring and Jens Jurgensen.\n\nThe album is considered a classic of indie and alternative rock. In 2005, it was ranked 31 in \"Spin\"s list of the 100 greatest albums from 1985 through to 2005 Pitchfork Media placed the album at number 40 in their list of \"Top 100 Albums of the 1980s.\" \"Alternative Press\" ranked it number 5 on their list of 'Top 99 Albums of '85 to '95'. Beats per Minute ranked it number 17 on their list of 'The Top 100 Albums of the 1980s'. Acclaimed Music finds it to be the 429th most acclaimed album of all time. In 2011, the album was canonized as a classic in the history of rock music by the appearance of a book dedicated to it in Continuum's 33⅓ series, written by Nick Attfield. The album was also included in the book \"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\".\n\nThe album has also proved to be massively influential, especially on the then-nascent shoegazing genre. Kevin Shields of My Bloody Valentine has named the album, among others, as an influence on their seminal \"You Made Me Realise\" EP; the two bands would eventually end up touring together.

She used the names Kimona Wanaleya in ECW and Leia Meow in WCW.\n\nLaum was asked by her friend Raven to go into professional wrestling while she was working as a go-go dancer at a club. She made her debut in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) on January 27, 1996 as Raven's new valet under the name Kimona Wanalaya (a play-on-words for \"Come on, I wanna lay ya\") and she managed Raven to win the ECW World Heavyweight Championship on the same night. According to the storyline, Raven used her to replace Beulah McGillicutty, his former girlfriend and valet, who had announced that she was pregnant with Tommy Dreamer's child on January 7 at ECW's House Party event. On April 20, 1996 at Hostile City Showdown, Shane Douglas, with Kimona by his side, called out Dreamer to inform him that Beulah had been cheating on him. While Dreamer was wondering who the person could be, in which Douglas replied “it's not a he”, Kimona snatched the microphone from Douglas's hand and shouted \"It's me!\" Moments later, Beulah made her way to the ring and she and Kimona shared a racy kiss and fell to the mat together before Dreamer decided to date both women. The segment is widely believed to be the first lesbian angle in a major wrestling promotion. A career highlight came when she danced atop the ECW Arena, a moment that was used to sell VHS copies of Extreme Warfare Vol. 2 until the promotion died.\n\nLaum later left ECW and worked for Jersey All Pro Wrestling (JAPW) for a while as Kimona. While in JAPW, she wrestled Missy Hyatt in a series of mixed tag team matches and a steel cage match.\n\nShe was signed by World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1999, and she eventually debuted alongside The Varsity Club (Kevin Sullivan, Mike Rotunda and Rick Steiner) as the cheerleader, Leia Meow.\nThis angle soon ended and she became the manager for The Jung Dragons (Jamie-San, Yun Yang, and Kaz Hayashi), thus turning heel. She would interfere in matches with a flying bodypress off of the top rope onto their opponents. She also had a dominatrix gimmick and carried a riding crop. She used it to attack Pamela Paulshock after Paulshock had won the \"Miss WCW\" contest that Meow participated in on September 25, 2000. She was then attacked by Midajah and had a brief rivalry with her leading to a fight on the following Thunder during Mike Awesome's \"Lava Lamp Lounge\" segment. She also had a short feud with Tygress and threatened to cut her hair off. By the time WCW was sold to Vince McMahon, she had been fired from WCW along with the majority of the other on-air female talent due to roster cuts.\n\nShe went to the X Wrestling Federation (XWF) where she was known as Kris, a member of the X-Girls, a dance team that included Gorgeous George and Chiquita Anderson of the Nitro Girls. When XWF folded, Kristina retired from wrestling.\n\n"}

Network executives may decide to attempt to revive a television program when they feel that a market once again exists for it. It is one of several programming strategies television networks employ to capitalize further on successful programs; among the other methods are spin-offs, reboots, remakes, cast reunions, television movies and sequels.\n\nUnlike spin-offs, in which a television network creates an entirely new series around an existing character, a revival reintroduces most or many of the original program's storylines, characters, and locales, and usually attempts to resolve story arcs that the original run failed to complete, as opposed to a sequel that may introduce a new storyline with some of the same characters after the previous series' story ended. Revivals usually take place at some point after the original series ends. By contrast, reboots and remakes may feature many of the original characters, but are usually played by new cast members and without taking into account events or continuity that occurred during the original series.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, game shows, due to the large number of international franchisings and the much greater rate of cancellation and revival among them, are largely absent from this list. Anthology series revivals, though they may include episodes that are remakes of ones from the earlier series, are generally included.\n\nLegend: \"—\" = denotes shared name with original work.\n\n"}

The band is best known for the single \"Banditos\" from their 1996 breakthrough album \"Fizzy Fuzzy Big & Buzzy\", and also for \"Yahoos and Triangles\", the theme song to the long-running animated series \"King of the Hill\". The latter was a piece the band traditionally performed at soundchecks. The Refreshments disbanded in 1998, although Roger Clyne and P.H. Naffah continue to tour and play Refreshments songs along with new music as Roger Clyne and the Peacemakers.\n\nOriginally The Mortals in 1992, Roger Clyne and Dustin \"Dusty\" Denham wanted to continue playing after that band's tenure had come to an end. They formed The Refreshments in early 1993 and had considered names like \"Pop Enema\" and \"All You Can Eat\" before settling on a more conventional name. The original lineup consisted of Clyne (lead vocals, rhythm guitar, harmonica, kazoo), Brian David Blush (lead guitar, backing vocals), Art Edwards (bass guitar, backing vocals), and Denham (drums, percussion, backing vocals). Blush came from a band called August Red, who were active around 1991 and consisted of Tim Thiel, Brian Spector, Brian Blush, Zowie Bowie, and Michael Gatt. Denham and Edwards had played together for a short time in a band called The Hanson Brothers.\n\nIn one year the band went from opening for such powerhouse local bands as Dead Hot Workshop and the Gin Blossoms to headlining and packing venues five nights a week. The Refreshments applied for entry to South by Southwest in Austin, Texas, and were not only received, but learned that the band's demo tape had been played for an A&R rep for Mercury Records; as a result of their performance at the music festival, the band was signed by the label as well as signing with manager, Michael Lustig. In 1995, original drummer Dustin \"Dusty\" Denham departed, and was replaced by Paul \"P.H.\" Naffah who had played in a local band called Rain Convention.\n\nThe Refreshments recorded their first record in the summer of 1995 and it was released in January 1996. The band hit the number one spot on Billboard's Heatseekers list with the single \"Banditos\" and toured throughout the U.S. “Banditos” peaked at No. 9 on the Billboard Alternative Rock charts and crossed over into the Hot 100. The band was slated to leave for Australian tour in the late fall but it was canceled by the new president of Mercury Records and the band members were told to go record their second album. Their second album was recorded in early 1997 and it was released in the fall of 1997. There was no financial or promotional support from Mercury to promote a tour. Mercury Records let the band's recording contract lapse in early 1998, unimpressed by the flagging sales of its second CD, \"The Bottle & Fresh Horses\". The Refreshments decided that the writing was on the wall and left Mercury before they were dropped from the label's lineup. The band sold 10,000 units in December 1997, their last month with the label.\n\nThat second Refreshments album, 1997's \"The Bottle and Fresh Horses\", spent one week on the chart. The band lost its deal with Mercury around the time Blush's drug problem peaked. In 1998, the band could no longer tolerate his junkie ways, and he was removed from the band. Blush pawned his lucrative publishing rights for both “King of the Hill” and the Refreshments catalog for $2,500.\n\nRoger Clyne and P.H. Naffah decided to rename the band and to continue touring and making music; the band still plays today as Roger Clyne and the Peacemakers.\n\nThe group was known for its \"Southwestern Sound,\" similar to other bands hailing from Arizona such as The Sidewinders, Gin Blossoms, The Meat Puppets and Dead Hot Workshop. The group had two charting singles, both from 1996's \"Fizzy Fuzzy Big & Buzzy\" (both written by Roger Clyne): \"Banditos\" (U.S. Mainstream Rock No. 11, Modern Rock No. 14), and \"Down Together\" (Modern Rock No. 38).\n\nLead vocalist, rhythm guitarist, and primary songwriter Roger Clyne and drummer Paul \"P.H.\" Naffah renamed the group Roger Clyne & The Peacemakers in 1998, and still perform most of The Refreshments songs live in concert. Occasionally, Roger Clyne and Paul \"P.H.\" Naffah play acoustic shows just the two of them, or Roger plays acoustic shows just by himself. Roger Clyne & The Peacemakers have released 8 studio albums, 2 live albums and a live DVD of their annual music festival, Circus Mexicus, in Puerto Peñasco, MX. They also went on to form a close relationship with the Major League Baseball team the Arizona Diamondbacks, writing/performing the team's theme song, \"The D-Back's Swing\". The band has also performed concerts for the team after ballgames at Chase Field and other various team events.\n\nArt Edwards is now a writer, and self-published his novels, \"Stuck Outside of Phoenix\" and \"Ghost Notes\" with another, \"Badge\", released in early 2014.\nStuck Outside of Phoenix was made into a full-length feature film which premiered May 2, 2013. It was produced by Nico Holthaus and directed by Dean Mongan, and stars Brandon Hannifin.\n\nGuitarist Brian David Blush is now a member of The Toluenes. The band’s first album with Blush was tentatively scheduled for release in February, 2011. Blush performed onstage with Roger Clyne and the Peacemakers on July 27, 2010 at Mr. G’s in Osceola, Indiana with Clyne, Naffah, and bassist Nick Scropos, performing \"Nada\". This was his first performance with them since 1998.\n\nIn March 2013, Roger, PH & Brian re-united and performed as The Refreshments to a raucous crowd at the Circus Mexicus Music Festival in June 2013.\n\nIn 2017, the documentary film titled \"Here's To Life - The Story of the Refreshments\" was released on Digital/DVD/Blu-Ray. The film chronicles the groups beginnings as a bar band, their rise to fame on a major label and issues within the band and the music industry that led to their sudden end.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The series began in 1990. It was produced by Steven Churchill of Odyssey Productions and Miramar Productions. The first three products in the series were released on VHS (by BMG) and LaserDisc (by Image Entertainment) and also released on DVD (by Simitar Entertainment). The fourth program in the series was released and distributed by Sony Music on DVD.\n\nThe typical entry in the \"Mind's Eye\" series is a short package film, usually 50 to 60 minutes long, with an electronic music soundtrack over a series of music video-like sequences. The original film, titled \"The Mind's Eye: A Computer Animation Odyssey\" by director and co-producer Jan Nickman, consisted of a non-rigid structure of many semi-related sequences. The general style which characterizes the series is light and cartoony due to the difficulty of rendering more complicated images using the computers of the day.\n\nThe computer animation sequences that appeared in the films were generally not produced specifically for the \"Mind's Eye\" series but rather were work originally created for other purposes, including demo reels, commercials, music videos, and feature films. Director and co-producer Jan Nickman then assembled these sequences into a narrative through creative editing, which resulted in a double platinum selling film considered to be a milestone in the field of computer animation. As a result, \"The Mind's Eye: A Computer Animation Odyssey\" reached #12 on Billboard's video hits chart. This approach gave Churchill access to the best-quality computer graphics of the time without having to bear their substantial production costs.\n\nThe soundtracks for the films were composed by James Reynolds, Thomas Dolby, Jan Hammer and Kerry Livgren (founder and guitarist for Kansas).\n\nThe Mind's Eye: A Computer Animation Odyssey (Miramar Images, Inc., September 25, 1990) was the first effort by director and co-producer Jan Nickman which served as a demonstration of computer animation when the art-form was still in its relative infancy. It is composed of a sequence of segments ambitiously chronicling the formation of Earth (\"Creation\"), the rise of human civilizations (\"Civilization Rising\"), and the technological advances of humanity from the advent of agriculture to the future exploration of the cosmos. The video speculatively concludes with a segment of what might be the next sentient species to arise on Earth, as well as the CGI short \"\". The soundtrack was composed by James Reynolds. The sales of this video were RIAA certified as \"Multi-Platinum\" and reached as high as #12 on Billboard's video sales chart.\n\nBeyond the Mind's Eye (Miramar Images, Inc., December 23, 1992) featured the efforts of Jan Hammer and included the first vocal tracks in such segments as \"Too Far\" and \"Seeds of Life\", a sequence themed around planet-colonizing seeds featuring the noted \"Panspermia\" by computer graphics artist Karl Sims. The DVD version included both the vocal version of \"Seeds of Life\" (sung by Chris Thompson) that blended the animation segment and footage of Hammer and his \"band\" performing (composed of four Jan Hammers), with an instrumental version of the same track. \"Beyond the Mind's Eye\" also features some CGI sequences from \"The Lawnmower Man\". The DVD contains 11 segments. The sales of this video were RIAA certified as \"Multi-Platinum\" and reached as high as #8 on Billboard's video sales chart.\n\nThe Gate to the Mind's Eye (Miramar Images, Inc., June 30, 1994) continued the trend of vocal tracks, along with music by Thomas Dolby. Five of its nine segments include vocal tracks: \"Armageddon\", a sequence depicting massive devastation; \"Neo\", an astronomy-themed song; \"Valley of the Mind's Eye\", a song about the progress of human technology; \"Nuvogue\", the first jazz track in the series; \"Quantum Mechanic\" starring guest vocalist Dr. Fiorella Terenzi. \"The Gate to the Mind's Eye\" also featured the animations \"Delirium Tremendus\", \"God and the Quantum\" and \"Synchronicity\" produced and conceptualized by visionary artist Beny Tchaicovsky.\n\nOdyssey Into The Mind's Eye (Odyssey Productions, July 12, 1996) features a soundtrack by Kerry Livgren and two more vocal tracks, \"One Dark World\" (sung by Darren Rogers) and \"Aspen Moon\" (sung by Livgren's nephew Jacob). \"Odyssey Into The Mind's Eye\" features versions of CGI sequences from \"Johnny Mnemonic\", \"\" and also features CGI sequences from '\"Cyberscape\" a 45 minutes computer animation vision produced and copyrighted by visionary artist Beny Tchaicovsky, released on VHS and DVD by Sony Music in 1997.\n\nConcurrently with the release of the Mind's Eye series, Churchill also released a series of titles such as Virtual Nature: A Computer Generated Visual Odyssey From the Makers of the Mind's Eye (Odyssey Visual Design, 1993) that obliquely referenced the series. This sister-series of videos continued after the release of \"Odyssey Into The Mind's Eye\" with the final three titles: The Mind's Eye Presents Luminous Visions (Odyssey Productions, 1998) and The Mind's Eye Presents Ancient Alien (Odyssey Productions, 1998), and The Mind's Eye Presents Little Bytes (Odyssey Productions, 2000).\n\nOther Anthology films released by Churchill such as Imaginaria (Odyssey Visual Design, 1994), and Turbulence (Odyssey Productions, 1997) did not include the term \"The Mind's Eye\" as part of their titles and are thus not considered to be a part of the series. Churchill's most recent releases have been members of the 8-member \"Computer Animation\" series which ran from 1996 to 2000 with Computer Animation Festival Volume 1.0 (Odyssey Visual Design, 1993), Computer Animation Festival Volume 2.0 (Odyssey Visual Design, 1994), and Computer Animation Festival Volume 3.0 (Odyssey Productions, 1996) forming the main series. The subsequent three \"Computer Animation\" titles again included oblique references to \"Mind's Eye\" and are entitled The Mind's Eye Presents Computer Animation Classics (Odyssey Productions, 1997), The Mind's Eye Presents Computer Animation Showcase (Odyssey Productions, 1997), and The Mind's Eye Presents Computer Animation Celebration (Odyssey Productions, 1998). The last two members in the series are Computer Animation Marvels (Odyssey Productions, 1999) and Computer Animation Extravaganza (Odyssey Productions, 2000).\n\nA second sister-series obliquely referencing \"Computer Animation\" is formed by the original \"Mind's Eye\" video and \"Cyberscape: A Computer Animation Vision\" (1997, co-produced by Zoe Productions and Odyssey Productions), a surreal animation on the history of the evolution of human life and thought by award-winning visionary artist Beny Tchaicovsky.\n\n\"Beyond the Mind's Eye\" was a bestseller in the US when it was originally released on VHS and LaserDisc. Roger Ebert selected it as his \"Video Pick of the Week\" on the week of December 25, 1992 on \"Siskel & Ebert\".\n\nSeveral excerpts from \"The Mind's Eye\" were seen in the 1992 film \"The Lawnmower Man\", which itself was featured in \"Beyond the Mind's Eye\". \"The Mind's Eye\" and \"Beyond the Mind's Eye\" were both integral components in YTV's \"Short Circutz\" segments that aired between programs in the 1990s. Canadian independent television station NTV airs excerpts from the first three of The Mind's Eye videos among their \"Computer Animated Art Festivals\" that run overnight on Fridays.\n\nPantera covered the song \"Planet Caravan\", originally by Black Sabbath, on their 1994 album \"Far Beyond Driven\". The music video for this song features scenes from \"Beyond the Mind's Eye\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1869488", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1869488", "title": "Phaser (effect)", "text": "Phaser (effect)\n\nA phaser is an electronic sound processor used to filter a signal by creating a series of peaks and troughs in the frequency spectrum. The position of the peaks and troughs of the waveform being affected is typically modulated so that they vary over time, creating a sweeping effect. For this purpose, phasers usually include a low-frequency oscillator.\n\nPhasers are often used to give a \"synthesized\" or electronic effect to natural sounds, such as human speech. The voice of C-3PO from \"Star Wars\" was created by taking the actor's voice and treating it with a phaser.\n\nThe electronic phasing effect is created by splitting an audio signal into two paths. One path treats the signal with an all-pass filter, which preserves the amplitude of the original signal and alters the phase. The amount of change in phase depends on the frequency. When signals from the two paths are mixed, the frequencies that are out of phase will cancel each other out, creating the phaser's characteristic notches. Changing the mix ratio changes the depth of the notches; the deepest notches occur when the mix ratio is 50%.\n\nThe definition of phaser typically excludes such devices where the all-pass section is a delay line; such a device is called a flanger. Using a delay line creates an unlimited series of equally spaced notches and peaks. It is possible to cascade a delay line with another type of all-pass filter. This combines the unlimited number of notches from the flanger with the uneven spacing of the phaser.\n\nTraditional electronic phasers use a series of variable all-pass phase-shift networks which alter the phases of the different frequency components in the signal. These networks pass all frequencies at equal volume, introducing only phase change to the signal. Human ears are not very responsive to phase differences, but this creates audible interferences when mixed back with the dry (unprocessed) signal, creating notches. The simplified structure of a mono phaser is shown below:\n\nThe number of all-pass filters (usually called \"stages\") varies with different models, some analog phasers offer 4, 6, 8 or 12 stages. Digital phasers may offer up to 32 or even more. This determines the number of notches/peaks in the sound, affecting the general sound character. A phaser with n stages generally has n/2 notches in the spectrum, so a 4-stage phaser will have two notches.\n\nAdditionally, the output can be fed back to the input for a more intense effect, creating a resonant effect by emphasizing frequencies between notches. This involves feeding the output of the all-pass filter chain back to the input, as shown here: \n\nThe frequency response of an 8-stage phaser with or without feedback is shown. Note that the peaks between the notches are sharper when there's feedback, giving a distinct sound.\n\nA stereo phaser is usually two identical phasers modulated by a quadrature signal; the output of the oscillators for the left and right channels are a quarter-wave out of phase. \n\nMost modern phasers are a part of a digital signal processor, often emulating analog phasers. Phasers are mostly found as plugins for sound editing software, as a part of a monolithic rackmount sound effect unit, or as \"stompbox\" guitar effects.\n\nPhasing is a popular effect for electric guitar. The term was often used to refer to the original tape flanging effect heard on many psychedelic records of the late 1960s, notably \"Itchycoo Park\" (1967) by the Small Faces. In 1968, Shin-ei's Uni-Vibe effects pedal, designed by audio engineer Fumio Mieda, incorporated phase shift and chorus effects, soon becoming favorite effects of guitarists such as Jimi Hendrix and Robin Trower. By the early 1970s, phasing was available as a portable guitar effect, one of the most notable early examples being the MXR Phase 90. From 1974, Steve Hackett in the \"Selling England by the Pound\" (1973) studio album and tour used this one for his Les Pauls, and from \"The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\" (1974) album and tour used the \"phase filter\" section in his EMS Synthi Hi-Fli. In the late 1970s, Brian May used large amounts of phasing, in such songs as \"Sheer Heart Attack\". In the late 1970s and 1980s, Eddie Van Halen, for instance, often used the MXR Phase 90 as part of his signal chain, for example in the instrumental \"Eruption\" and on the song \"Atomic Punk\".\n\nKeyboard players also used phasing: in the 1970s, keyboard instruments like the Fender Rhodes electric piano, the Eminent 310 electronic organ, and the Clavinet were commonly treated with a phaser, especially in avant-garde jazz. Bill Evans, for instance, used a Maestro phaser on \"Intuition\" (1974). The phaser is also used to \"sweeten\" their sounds. Examples can be heard in Billy Joel's \"Just The Way You Are\", Styx's \"Babe\", and Jean Michel Jarre's \"Oxygène\" (1976) on which he used an EHX Small Stone phaser extensively. Tony Banks (Genesis) used an MXR Phase 100 on his RMI 368x Electra piano from 1974 (later he inserted this effect, as well as the fuzzbox, into the Electra's panel); from late 1977 he also used the phaser (along with a Boss CE-1) on his Hammond organ to replace the Leslie's rotating effect. Daft Punk helped to re-popularize the effect in the 21st century, utilizing it on a number of tracks on their \"Discovery\" album in 2001. Richard Tee also used a phase shifter hooked up to his Fender Rhodes.\n\nIn motion picture or television production, the effect created by a phaser is often used to imply that the sound is synthetically generated, like turning a natural human voice into a computer or robot voice. The technique works because the frequency filtering produces sound commonly associated with mechanical sources, which only generate specific frequencies, rather than natural sources, which produce a range of frequencies. A vocoder is a different effect used for similar purposes.\n\nA specific type of phasing, flanging is a similar effect, in which the notches are linearly spaced. In a flanger effect, the notches are created by mixing the signal with a delayed version of itself. Flangers tend to sound more pronounced and natural, like the \"jet plane whoosh\" effect, whereas phasers tend to sound more subtle and otherworldly.

The highway follows the shore of Lake Michigan and the Little Traverse Bay, with its southern terminus at US Highway 31 (US 31) near Bay View, about four miles (6.4 km) east of Petoskey; the northern terminus is at a junction with county roads C-66 and C-77 in Cross Village. North of Harbor Springs, the highway is known as the Tunnel of Trees Scenic Heritage Route. This section of highway lacks a centerline and is known for its scenic beauty. On an average day, between 2,000 and 15,000 vehicles use various parts of the highway.\n\nThe first highway along the route of the modern M-119 was a section of the original M-13 designated by July 1, 1919. This highway was later redesignated M-131 in late 1926, a designation it held until 1979. During this timeframe, another highway bore the M-119 moniker in the southern part of the state near Paw Paw from the 1930s until the early 1970s. In between 1926 and 1979, M-131 was extended and truncated on both its northern and southern ends at various times. Since the M-119 designation was applied to the current highway, no changes have been made to the routing.\n\nM-119 starts at an intersection with US 31 about four miles (6.4 km) northeast of Petoskey near the community of Bay View in Bear Creek Township. The highway runs north between Petoskey State Park on the west and Round Lake on the east as it rounds the east end of Little Traverse Bay. The trunkline passes the eastern and northern edges of the Harbor Springs Municipal Airport as it turns westward near the junction with C-81 (Pleasantview Road). Through this area, M-119 runs through the community of Wequetonsing and forests just inland from the bay's northern shore. As it passes into the city limits of Harbor Springs, the highway follows Main Street into downtown. It turns north and then westward along State Street in the middle of town, intersecting the southern end of C-77 in the central business district. M-119 continues westward, passing through a residential area on Bluff Drive as it leaves the city.\n\nFrom Harbor Springs on, M-119 is the Tunnel of Trees Scenic Heritage Route, one of the Pure Michigan Byways in the state. Bluff Drive becomes Lake Shore Drive near the Harbor Point Golf Course, and M-119 turns northward to follow the Lake Michigan shoreline at the mouth of Little Traverse Bay. The roadway meanders through oaks, maples, birch and cedars along an old Ottawa trail. The writers at \"National Geographic\" said that \"only sometimes can you catch glimmers of Lake Michigan through the trees, but the dense foliage lends beauty to the winding road\". Along this area of the routing, the highway narrows in width and continues through the forest without a centerline most of the remainder of the way. As the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) states on their website, \"M-119 is not a road for those in a hurry.\" The roadway is known as the Tunnel of Trees because, \"the foliage from trees on either side of the road meets high over the middle of road where it forms a canopy so soft that it lets daylight trickle through in small amounts only.\" The trunkline continues through the community of Good Hart up the Lake Michigan shoreline to the community of Cross Village. M-119, and state maintenance, end at the intersection between Lake Shore Drive and C-66/C-77 (State Road) in the middle of town.\n\nAs part of the state's maintenance of M-119, MDOT tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadway. MDOT's surveys in 2010 showed that the highest traffic levels along M-119 were the 14,647 vehicles daily near the southern terminus, on average; the lowest counts were the 2,036 vehicles per day at the northern terminus. None of M-119 has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. The Discovery Channel named the roadway as one of the \"Top 10 Motorcycle Rides in North America\".\n\nThe first incarnation of the M-119 designation ran from an intersection south of US 12 in Paw Paw south to Lawton in Van Buren County. By the middle of 1936, it had been extended farther south to US 112 near Mottville. In 1971, all of M-119 was redesignated as M-40.\n\nThe current highway was designated in 1979, replacing the former route of M-131; the routing has remained unchanged since. This section of highway had been part of M-13 on July 1, 1919, when the state trunkline highway system debuted. Later on November 11, 1926, M-13 south of Fife Lake was redesignated as part of US 131, and the remainder of M-13 was designated as M-131.\n\nUntil 1933, M-131 had terminated in Harbor Springs; the highway was extended to the north along Little Traverse Bay and the Lake Michigan shoreline through the community of Good Hart before terminating in Cross Village. This section of highway would be stripped of its designation in 1937 and truncated back to Harbor Springs. In late 1938 or early 1939, the State Highway Department extended US 131 along the M-131 corridor to Petoskey. This allowed US 131 to finally connect to its parent, US 31 for the first time since their inception in 1926. The MSHD re-extended M-131 back to Cross Village in 1945. The highway remained as such until 1967 when a slight realignment was made in Emmet County along the lakeshore where M-131 was routed on to its final alignment. The southern end was moved in 1969 out of Petoskey so that M-131 would no longer run concurrently with US 31 to connect with US 131.\n\n\n"}

He was one of the influential advocates of bringing modern architecture from custom residences and large corporate buildings to general public availability. His company and developments remain in the Greater San Francisco Bay Area and Greater Los Angeles.\n\nBetween 1949 and 1966, Joseph Eichler's company, Eichler Homes, built over 11,000 homes in nine communities in Northern California and homes in three communities in Southern California. Later, other firms worked with Eichler's company to build similar houses. Together, they all came to be known as Eichlers. During this period, Eichler became one of the nation's most influential builders of modern homes. The largest contiguous Eichler Homes development is \"The Highlands\" in San Mateo, built between 1956 and 1964.\n\nJoseph Eichler is considered by some to be a social visionary and commissioned designs primarily for middle-class Americans. One of his stated aims was to construct inclusive and diverse planned communities, ideally featuring integrated parks and community centers. Eichler established a non-discrimination policy and offered homes for sale to anyone of any religion or race. In 1958, he resigned from the National Association of Home Builders when they refused to support a non-discrimination policy.\n\nAccording to his son, Eichler was inspired by a short period of time when the family lived in a Frank Lloyd Wright–designed home in Hillsborough. Eichler was attracted to the style and decided to try to produce similar designs. Joseph Eichler used well-known architects to design both the site plans and the homes themselves. He hired the respected architect and Wright disciple of sorts Robert Anshen of Anshen & Allen to design the initial Eichlers, and the first prototypes were built in 1949. In later years, Eichler built homes that were designed by other architects including by the San Francisco firm Claude Oakland & Associates and the Los Angeles firms of Jones & Emmons, A. Quincy Jones, and Raphael Soriano.\n\nEichler homes are examples of Modernist architecture that has come to be known as \"California Modern\", and typically feature glass walls, post-and-beam construction, and open floorplans in a style indebted to Frank Lloyd Wright and Mies van der Rohe. Eichler home exteriors featured flat and/or low-sloping A-framed roofs, vertical 2-inch pattern wood siding, and spartan facades with clean geometric lines. One of Eichler's signature concepts was to \"bring the outside in\", achieved via skylights and floor-to-ceiling windows with glass transoms looking out on protected and private outdoor rooms, patios, atriums, gardens, and swimming pools. Also of note is that most Eichler homes feature few, if any, front-facing (i.e., street-facing) windows; instead house fronts have either small, ceiling-level windows or small, rectangular windows with frosted glass. Many other architectural designs have large windows on all front-facing rooms.\n\nThe interiors had numerous unorthodox and innovative features for the time period including: exposed post-and-beam construction; tongue and groove decking for the ceilings following the roofline; concrete slab floors with integral radiant heating; lauan (Philippine mahogany) paneling; sliding doors for rooms, closets, and cabinets; and typically a second bathroom located in the master bedroom. Later models introduced the distinctive Eichler entry atriums, an open-air, enclosed entrance foyer designed to further advance the concept of integrating outdoor and indoor spaces.\n\nEichler homes were airy and modern in comparison to most of the mass-produced, middle-class, postwar homes built in the 1950s. At first, potential home buyers, many of whom were war-weary ex-servicemen and women seeking convention rather than innovation, were resistant to the innovative homes.\n\nThe Northern California Eichler Homes are predominantly in San Francisco, Marin County, Sacramento, the East Bay towns of Walnut Creek, Concord, Oakland, Castro Valley, and the San Francisco Peninsula towns of San Mateo, Redwood City, Palo Alto, Sunnyvale, Mountain View and San Jose. The Southern California Eichler Homes developments are in Thousand Oaks, Granada Hills, Orange and Palm Springs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoseph Eichler also built semi-custom designs for individual clients by commission, such as three in Chestnut Ridge, New York. As a result of soaring land prices in the mid-1960s urban redevelopment projects became popular, and Eichler began building low- and high-rise projects in San Francisco's Western Addition and Hunters Point-Bayview districts, luxury high-rises and clustered housing on Russian Hill and Diamond Heights. He also developed the suburban and trendsetting co-op communities Pomeroy Green and Pomeroy West in Santa Clara. These large projects began to overextend the company, and by the mid-1960s, Eichler Homes was in financial distress. The company filed for bankruptcy in 1967.\n\nHe married Lilian Moncharsh (1902–1982), the daughter of Polish Jewish emigres. Together they had two sons, Edward \"Ned\" Philip (1930–2014) and Richard.\n\n"}

It is named after the Egyptian goddess of truth and justice, Ma'at.\n\nMaat Mons has a large summit caldera, 28×31 km in size. Within the large caldera there are at least five smaller collapse craters, up to 10 km in diameter.\n\nA chain of small craters 3–5 km in diameter extends some 40 km along the southeast flank of the volcano, but rather than indicating a large fissure eruption, they seem to also be formed by collapse: full resolution imagery from the \"Magellan\" probe reveals no evidence of lava flows from these craters.\n\nAt least two large scale structural collapse events seem to have occurred in the past on Maat Mons.\n\nRadar sounding by the \"Magellan\" probe revealed evidence for comparatively recent volcanic activity at Maat Mons, in the form of ash flows near the summit and on the northern flank.\n\nIntriguingly for planetary geologists, atmospheric studies carried out by the Pioneer Venus probes in the early 1980s revealed a considerable variation in the concentrations of sulfur dioxide (SO) and methane (CH) in Venus' middle and upper atmosphere. One possible explanation for this was the injection of volcanic gases into the atmosphere by plinian eruptions at Maat Mons.\n\nMore recent studies have suggested that the volcano structure, distribution of lava flows, pit craters, summit morphology, and other small-scale features are indicative of recent volcanic activity on Maat Mons.\n\nAlthough many lines of evidence suggest that Venus is likely to be volcanically active, present-day eruptions at Maat Mons have not been confirmed.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1869510", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1869510", "title": "Blue City (novel)", "text": "Blue City (novel)\n\nBlue City is a thriller written in 1947 by Ross Macdonald. The novel was originally released under his real name, Kenneth Millar, by Alfred A. Knopf, while a condensed version was serialized in the August and September 1950 issues of \"Esquire\". In 1986 it was considerably adapted to film.\n\nMacdonald later described his third novel, \"Blue City\", as \"a tough thriller in the Spillane tradition\", although \"The Chicago Sun\" noted that he was in a different league from Mickey Spillane. Publicity for the novel linked the author's name with James M. Cain, Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, a comparison deprecated in the mixed reviews that the book received at the time. Macdonald himself later said in an interview that Hammett was a particularly strong influence on the novel; \"I imagine I might never have written hard-boiled detective stories at all if it hadn't been for Hammett\". Others have commented on the likeness between Macdonald's 'Blue City' and the 'Poisonville' of Hammett's \"Red Harvest\".\n\nThe portrayal of the novel's unnamed Mid-Western small town, lying in the shadow of Chicago, is centered mostly on the disadvantaged who live in it and differs from the up-market Californian scenarios of the Lew Archer novels that Macdonald was yet to write. In a 1952 letter to his publisher, he explained that he had in mind \"a town where I had suffered, and several of the characters were based on people I hated.\" It is from this that the book's anger and political stance derive. The protagonist is narrator throughout, but will occasionally diverge from talking tough into what Macdonald's biographer describes as \"civics lectures\" or he overdoes literary reference. The particular target of his anger is small-town pettifoggery. The self-congratulatory tabloid editorial justifying anti-union violence or the list of books suppressed in the library from which \"it was somehow comforting to know that the good people of the town … were protected against the lubricity of Rabelais, the immorality of Flaubert, the viciousness of Hemingway, and the degradation of Faulkner.\"\n\nReviewing the book, Nelson Algren praised the over-all clipped descriptive style: \"Kenneth Millar never uses two words when one will do; and when he wants you to see a thing, you see it.\" A later commentator looked beyond thriller conventions and discovered that \"Millar wanted to do in prose what jazzmen did in music\". Here he was only following Macdonald himself, who had said in an earlier interview that \"the imagery and rhythm and movements of jazz had a lot to do with forming my style in my early books. It's quite obvious in a book like \"Blue City\".\" He also noted then that Jack Kerouac's \"jazz-prose\" was written later and more diffusely. There was no direct influence.\n\nTwenty-two-year-old John Weather has returned from the army, having served in the European Theater in the Second World War, only to find his estranged father had been shot two years previously. John had known his father as a prominent businessman and politician and now learns that he was a leading factor in the corruption of the town. Everyone seems more than happy to let his murder remain unsolved and, as John tries to uncover the murderer, he finds himself up against and manhandled by thugs in the pay of Roger Kerch. Kerch is a blackmailer who has taken over his father's slot machine franchise and seems to have a hold over his step-mother, Floraine, whom his father had married while John was young and living away from home.\n\nFinally, with the help of Carla, a hostess at the Cathay Club, John gets ahead of those trying to prevent him uncovering the truth. After Kerch has killed his step-mother (who turns out to be Kerch's bigamous wife), and John is in line to inherit his father's assets, he gains the co-operation of Ralph Hanson, the police inspector in charge of the case, and Freeman Allister, the ineffectual reformist mayor. Kerch and his surviving associates are jailed, while Allister, the real murderer of John's father, is shot by his mistress.\n\n"}

January 1795) was known as a peacemaker who was open to trade with Europeans. By the time Ackomokki was chief, the Blackfoot/Plains Confederacy had consolidated power throughout he plains of what is modern-day Montana, Alberta, and western Saskatchewan.\n\nAckomokki's son was known to fur traders as \"Feathers\" (or \"Painted Feathers\"). After his father's death he adopted the name Ackomokki, although Europeans continued to call him \"Feathers\" or \"Many Swans\" to distinguish him from his father. The younger Ackomokki (d. 1814), like his father, worked to preserve peace among his people and the neighboring Cree and Assiniboine peoples, as well as with European traders. In 1800, Ackomokki allowed the Hudson's Bay Company to establish the Chesterfield House trading post within the Blackfoot's wintering grounds at the confluence of the Red Deer and South Saskatchewan Rivers. However, changes in the balance of power between the Blackfoot and neighboring tribes brought on in part by westward expansion of U.S. traders lead to increasing conflicts and military decline for the Siksika.\n\nAround 1801, the younger Ackomokki drew for Hudson Bay Company surveyor Peter Fidler a detailed map of the lands around the Upper Missouri, including names of rivers, mountains, and peaks and travel time between them and information about 32 tribes populating the region. These drawings were later incorporated into the 1802 edition of Aaron Arrowsmith's map of the Interior Parts of North America. Ackomokki's maps included significant details about the topography and inhabitants of the area, which proved helpful in expanding the Hudson's Bay Company activities in the region.\n\nA third Old Swan (d. 1859/1860), possibly a son or nephew of the younger Ackomokki, assumed leadership of what was called by Europeans \"Old Feathers' Band\" by 1822. He was described in 1858 by Dr. James Hector as one of the principal chiefs of the Blackfoot Confederacy, and, in July 1859, the Palliser Expedition were guests at his encampment on the Red Deer River.\n"}

At the 2006 census, its population was 554 individuals from 180 families.\n\nHistorical names for the city include Māsalar and Khortāb. It was founded in the 10th century AD.\n\nMasuleh is approximately 60 km southwest of Rasht and 32 km west of Fuman. The village is 1,050 meters above sea level in the Alborz (or Elburz) mountain range, near the southern coast of the Caspian Sea. The village itself has a difference in elevation of 100 meters.\n\nAlthough it has been written that the community was established around 10 AD, the province of Gilan has a long history. The first village of Masuleh was established around 1006 AD, 6 km northwest of the current city, and it is called Old-Masuleh (Kohneh Masuleh in Persian). People moved from Old-Masuleh to the current city because of pestilence and attacks from neighbouring communities.\n\nMasouheh-Rood-Khan is the river passing through the city, with a waterfall located just 200 meters away from the village. It's cut-off by snow during the winter months. Fog is the predominant weather feature of Masuleh.\n\nMasuleh’s architecture is unique. The buildings have been built into the mountain and are interconnected. Courtyards and roofs both serve as pedestrian areas similar to streets. Masuleh does not allow any motor vehicles to enter, due to its unique layout. It is the only city in Iran with such a prohibition. However, the small streets and many stairs simply wouldn't make it possible for vehicles to enter.\n\nThe spectacular architecture of Masuleh is popularly known as \"The yard of the building above is the roof of the building below\".\n\nYellow clay coats the exterior of most buildings in Masuleh. This allows for better visibility in the fog.\n\nBuildings are mostly two stories (1st floor and 'ground' floor) made of adobe, rods and bole. A small living room, big guest room, winter room, hall, WC and balcony are usually found in 1st floor. A cold closet, barn and stable are located on the floor below, which are connected to the upper floor by several narrow steps inside the building.\n\nThere are four main local communities at the city named: \"Maza-var\" (meaning beside the Mosque) at the south, \"Khana-var\" (beside homes) at the East, \"Kasha-sar\" (stretched on top) at the North, and, \"Assa-mahala\" (Assad community) at the West. Apparently, down town is the Market (Bazaar) area and also the main mosque of the city, named \"O-ne-ben-ne Ali\" (Awn Ibn Mohammad Ibn Ali Ibn. Abi Taleb) built in 969 AD.\n\nDue to avoiding utilization of human figures and abstaining from idolatry, decorations have specific geometry in Islamic art and architecture. One of the striking characteristics of the knots (girih) that has caused to dynamicity throughout its thousand-year history is its regeneration and diversification of the diverse geometric properties. Girih tiling decoration is part of geometric arts in the traditional buildings of the historic town of Masouleh dates back to eight hundred years. Traditional and local architects of this historical town have adopted special and intellectual plans for creating visual attractions in expression and creation of girih tiling in the walls of the monuments. One of these valuable solutions is diverse geometric decorations patterns .Since the main facades of the houses in this town are directly located in the sunrise direction and it is accepted landscape for the citizens of this historical town, thus the artists have shown their art and style in this part of the monument and built beautiful and harmonic diverse wooden windows and variety of these patterns are seen in all five neighborhoods in this town. Girih tiling consists of straight and broken lines on a regular basis that could be reasonably expanded in the surface.\n\nGeometric designs (both normal and abnormal) and purely geometric interlaced patterns involve mental imaginary forms which are essentially superior to the perception- based naturalistic images. The patterns were not aimed to capture the reality perceived through the eyes, but they were supposed to create a glimpse of astonishing beauty in the artist’s creative mind or soul. Due to avoiding utilization of human figures and abstaining from idolatry, decorations have specific geometry in Islamic art and architecture. One of the striking characteristics of the knots (girih) that has caused to dynamicity throughout its thousand-year history is its regeneration and diversification of the diverse geometric properties. Girih tiles are used in Islamic art and architecture. Iranian Chinese Knotting is one of is one of traditional fields and professions that depends on geometrical patterns and on the first encounter, the spectator, is subconsciously affected by its discipline. Geometrical patterns, which are the source for the art Chinese Knotting, usually contain a polygon star in\nthe middle (the Shamseh) and some other geometrical figures so that they can cover the remaining space. Chinese knotting is not specifically a certain decoration or a means of conveying the emotions of the artist, but also the point of making them regarding to two ways: acting on the basis of their own knowledge and guiding others towards this knowledge. When a spectator looks upon the works of Chinese Knotting, they’re first affected by its beauty and especially its discipline, but after some more contemplation they are driven into the art’s mystical meanings. Girih tile is a part of Islamic architecture and art while its different types are used in the following arts: Wood carving, tiling, plaster, Khātam, brick work, mirror work, stone work and in carpentry as fences, door and window, wooden decorations and wood carving of Minbar and in blacksmith Iranian architecture. Girih tile is an intelligent interaction of aesthetics and function. Islamic artists have applied local materials in accordance to the functional requirements and cultural issues of each region. The valuable examples of this art are observed in historical city of Masoule located in the mountainous area of Masoule in Gilan (Iran). Wood is one of the highly applied materials in traditional architecture of Gilan with its different types. One of the greatest arts is seen in the historical city of Masoule with Girih tiles. Wood is used in this region due to its climatic condition and the need to a good thermal isolation against heat and cold weather. Also, wood is the first material being\napplied in openings. Girih tiles decorations in this historical city are abundant in the buildings while their main façade is to the south. One of the advantages of using Girih tiles in openings of this historical city is to control the direct light in\ndifferent seasons of year. The aesthetic aspect is on the second priority. The beauty of Girih tiles, their coordination and part to total tendency in all openings have improved the unity and beauty of the historical buildings of Masoule. Sash window, other meshes and Telar with combination of decorative plants in the façade of buildings in Masoule have increased the aesthetics of this city. Historical city of Masoule is a good model for sustainable architecture and its final aim is respecting the culture and friendly relationship with nature and improving the life style of its residents.\n\nMarket (bazar)\n\nMuseum of Anthropology Masuleh: Established in 2002 and incorporates the history of Masuleh and its people.\n\nForest park: Masouleh Forest Park is one of the most beautiful forest parks in northern Iran and even in the Middle East. The variety of plants in this park is very large and trees like rush, alder, hornbeam, hazelnut, as well as herbs are seen in it.\n\nWaterfalls kooshm and larcheshme and kourbar.\n\nThe native people of Masuleh speak Talysh.\n\n\n"}

He is one of the first openly LGBT Italian politicians and the first openly LGBT heads of a regional government in Italy.\n\nBorn in Terlizzi, in the province of Bari, on 26 August 1958, Vendola was a member of the Italian Communist Youth Federation from the age of fourteen. He went on to study literature at his university, presenting a dissertation on the poet and film director Pier Paolo Pasolini.\n\nVendola became a journalist for \"l'Unità.\" He came out as gay in 1978, and became an activist and a leading member of the Italian gay organisation Arcigay. A member of the National Secretariat of the Italian Communist Party, he fiercely opposed the dissolution of the party proposed by Achille Occhetto in 1991. This led to the formation of the Democratic Party of the Left. Vendola instead joined the Communist Refoundation Party.\n\nIn 1992, Vendola was elected to the Chamber of Deputies, to a seat which he held until 2005. As a member of the Antimafia Commission, he came to prominence as a strong opponent of the Mafia and organised crime.\n\nIn 2005, Vendola ran for the first primary election ever held in Italy, held by the centre-left coalition The Union to choose their candidate for the presidency of the Apulia region. He won the primary over the rival Francesco Boccia. Many moderates in the alliance criticised the choice, since it appeared impossible that a communist homosexual could be elected president of a southern Italian region such as Apulia, generally considered to be conservative and strongly Catholic. Vendola identifies as a \"believer\" (in the line of Pax Christi): he once said that \"the most important book for a communist like me is the Bible\".\n\nIn the regional election in Apulia, held in April 2005, he narrowly defeated the incumbent president Raffaele Fitto, candidate for the centre-right coalition the House of Freedoms. He was the first member of the Communist Refoundation Party to be elected as president of any Italian region.\n\nIn the July 2008 party congress, Vendola was one of the two major candidates running for the place of Chairman of the Communist Refoundation party; he lost to an alliance led by the other major candidate, Paolo Ferrero, formerly Minister for Social Solidarity in the Prodi II Cabinet. Following the defeat, Vendola's supporters have renounced all positions as party executives.\n\nOn 24 January 2009, at Chianciano Terme, Vendola split from Communist Refoundation and founded the Movement for the Left. In December 2009, Vendola became the first leader of the newly founded party Left Ecology Freedom, which the Movement for the Left had merged into.\n\nIn late 2009, his candidacy for re-election was questioned by his centre-left allies from the Democratic Party. They asked him to step down to allow the choice of a candidate able to achieve wider support from other political parties, namely the Christian-democratic Union of the Centre. After Vendola refused to step down, chances of having a new primary election quickly increased.\n\nAfter some weeks of heated debate, elections were called for 24 January 2010. Supported by the Democratic Party, Francesco Boccia ran as Vendola's challenger. Vendola easily won the election with more than 67% of the votes, was picked again as leader of the centre-left coalition, and went on to defeat centre-right candidate Rocco Palese by a wide margin.\n\nIn July 2010, during a general congress of the so-called \"Factories of Nichi\", Vendola announced his candidacy for the Primary Elections of the Italian centre-left. This voting was expected to foreshadow what might be expected in the 2013 Italian general elections. Nationwide polls showed Vendola winning over either Democratic Party Secretary Pier Luigi Bersani or Silvio Berlusconi, then Prime Minister of Italy. But came third in the primaries held on 25 November 2012 Vendola ranked third among the 5 candidates with 485,689 votes totaling 15.6%, failing to access the ballot.\nIn the general election of 2013 Vendola was the candidate of Apulia for the Chamber of deputies, being elected for the 5th time. On 6 March 2013, however, he announced that he would remain in charge of the Puglia Region, thus renouncing the seat in the Chamber. On 10 April 2013 he formalized his resignation as a deputy.\n\nUnable to apply for a third time as president of the region, in 2015 Vendola supports the former mayor of Bari Michele Emiliano who will win with 47%.\n\nOn 17 December 2016, Left Ecology Freedom (SEL) was dissolved and merged with the Italian Left, on 19 February 2017.\n\nDuring his political career he received insults related to his homosexuality. In 2012 he was insulted by a minister of Ferrara of the Democratic Party, Luigi Marattin. In October 2013 Alessandro Morelli, leader of the Lega Nord at the comune of Milan, published an image of Vendola on Facebook with the words \"Gay and pedophile\". The next day Morelli apologized.\n\nVendola has lived with his partner Edward \"Ed\" Testa since 2004. In 2016, the couple used surrogacy in California to have a baby, Tobia Antonio.\nVendola is also a poet: some of his poems have been collected in a book, named \"L'ultimo mare\" (\"The last sea\"). His figure has inspired a biographical film, \"Nichi\". Vendola is a devout Roman Catholic, although he opposes many of the church's social positions.\n\nOn 17 October 2018, Vendola had a heart attack, but he is in no danger after being fitted with a stent at Rome's Gemelli Hospital.\n\n\n\n"}

It runs between US Highway 31 (US 31) and US 131/M-66 in the Lower Peninsula. Running from Mancelona to Eastport, M-88 also goes through the communities of Bellaire and Central Lake. The highway is completely within Antrim County and is known by the street name of \"Scenic Highway\" outside of the various communities along its routing.\n\nM-88 is an original trunkline dating back to the 1919 signing of the state system. An extension in the 1920s and paving in the late 1930s created the highway as it exists today. The highway was not listed on the National Highway System, nor is it included in the Lake Michigan Circle Tour.\n\nM-88 starts in the community of Eastport at an intersection four blocks east of the Grand Traverse Bay of Lake Michigan next to Barnes County Park. From its start, it runs east along the northern end of Torch Lake. M-88 zig-zags south and east along Scenic Highway to the community of Central Lake. In Central Lake it runs south along Main Street, following the western shore of Intermediate Lake. South of Intermediate Lake, M-88 crosses the Intermediate River on a historic designation-eligible Depression-era bridge along Bridge Street in Bellaire. This section of M-88 is just west of the Antrim County Airport before the highway turns east on Cayuga Street in downtown and south on Division Street. The Bellaire section of the trunkline is the location of the highest traffic levels along the highway. The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) measures the annual average daily traffic (AADT) in traffic surveys. The 2007 survey showed that 5,200 vehicles used the section of roadway on the average day in Bellaire.\n\nSouth of Bellaire, M-88 passes the Chief Golf Course and the Legend, Summit and Bellaire golf clubs. M-88 crosses the Shanty Creek, which is the namesake of a resort in the area. South of the Bellaire Golf Club, M-88 turns eastward again, passing south of Schuss Mountain, another resort. This section of trunkline is used by 3,300 vehicles in the 2007 AADT survey. Past Schuss Mountain, M-88 turns east at Alden highway and enters the community of Mancelona, passing the Fairview Cemetery. The highway runs along on State Street into downtown. M-88 ends at an intersection with US 131/M-66 running along Williams Street, and State Street continues eastward as C-38.\n\nM-88 was first designated by July 1, 1919 along its current routing between Mancelona and Bellaire. It was extended in 1927 through Central Lake to end in Eastport. It was used as a temporary routing of US 31 between Eastport and Bellaire while the Elk Rapids to Eastport section of US 31 was reconstructed. The first sections of roadway were paved near Bellaire in late 1936. Paving was completed on the entire highway by late 1940 No changes have been made to the highway since. None of the highway was added to the National Highway System, a system of strategically important highways.\n\n"}

Puffy, who was a Catholic, had demanded that his crucifixion scene be excised from the broadcast edit of the video. However, the wrong edit was incorrectly sent to MTV, which broadcast that version on the April 15, 1999, edition of \"TRL\". Within minutes of the broadcast, Combs had barged into the offices of Nas' manager Steve Stoute with several bodyguards, and struck Stoute over the head with a champagne bottle. In June 1999, Stoute sued Combs, resulting in a $500,000 out-of-court settlement from Combs.\n\n\n"}

It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on November 20, 2002.\n\nIn the episode, Mr. Garrison tries to get fired from his new job as the fourth grade teacher at South Park Elementary by being overtly and explicitly homosexual in front of the students, so he can sue the school and get twenty-five million dollars in damages and shoves the school's gerbil Lemmiwinks into Mr. Slave's rectum. However, he is unable to as the rest of the faculty and the children's parents are desperate to appear tolerant of his homosexuality. The boys do not share their sentiments, and as punishment for not tolerating Garrison's outrageous behavior, they are sent to a Nazi-esque \"tolerance camp.\" All of the scenes inside the camp are shown in black-and-white, a homage to \"Schindler's List\".\n\nThe episode was written by series co-creator Trey Parker and is rated TV-MA in the United States. \"The Daily Telegraph\" has referred to it as one of the series' strongest episodes.\n\nFinally promoted to teaching fourth graders, Mr. Garrison realizes that getting fired for being homosexual could allow him to sue the school for millions. He decides to perform outrageous sex acts in the classroom, hiring his partner Mr. Slave as his teaching assistant. Although the boys complain about Garrison's inappropriate activities, their parents mistakenly think their boys are intolerant of homosexuality. However, despite their thoughts about that, the adults bring the boys to the Museum of Tolerance to learn about tolerance of minorities or those with different life choices, though they hypocritically attack a nearby smoker with verbal abuse. Garrison, annoyed that no one has complained about his actions, steps up his campaign to get fired by shoving Lemmiwinks, the class gerbil, into Mr. Slave's rectum, an act called gerbilling.\n\nThe boys mention their discomfort to Chef, who in turn, reports Garrison's actions to Principal Victoria, but ends up being sent to a \"tolerance seminar\". Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Butters refuse to attend class, so their parents send them to an Auschwitz-like \"tolerance camp\" (it is unknown if this is the same camp Chef was sent to). Back at the Museum of Tolerance, Garrison is to receive the \"Courageous Teacher Award\" for overcoming adversity. Still frustrated at not being fired, Garrison goes all out at the ceremony in an extremely flamboyant and stereotypically gay manner (humming Ferde Grofé's \"On the Trail\" from the \"Grand Canyon Suite\"). Although the parents finally understand what their kids were telling them about and are indeed shocked at Garrison's behavior, they cannot bring themselves to criticize it, as they fear being branded \"intolerant\". When the people continue to call Garrison and Mr. Slave \"courageous\" for their actions, Garrison finally breaks down and shouts at them that tolerating something does not mean you have to like it. He goes on to say that tolerating his homosexuality should not mean that he can do things which are obviously inappropriate in front of his students and begs to be fired so that he can collect on a discrimination lawsuit, but Principal Victoria says she has a better idea.\n\nThe parents hurry to collect their malnourished and emaciated kids from the tolerance camp, but fail to realize that they tried to tell them about Garrison's behavior. Principal Victoria concludes that Garrison and Mr. Slave are \"intolerant of their own behavior\", and she is sending them to the tolerance camp so that they will accept themselves. As the outside events occur, Lemmiwinks traverses the regions of Mr. Slave's digestive system, receiving advice from three animal spirits – the Frog King, Sparrow Prince and Catatafish. The journey is accompanied by songs that parody those used in the 1977 Rankin/Bass version of \"The Hobbit\". As Mr. Slave arrives at the tolerance camp, he coughs up Lemmiwinks. The spirits, now free from Mr. Slave's gut, appear before Lemmiwinks and crown him \"The Gerbil King\". He exits the scene with the \"Ballad of Lemmiwinks\" playing over the credits.\n\n\"The Death Camp of Tolerance\" was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker. By this point in the series' sixth season, the show had followed a story arc involving the death of Kenny (\"Kenny Dies\"), and several other tangents, among those Mr. Garrison's move to teaching kindergarten. Parker and co-creator Matt Stone began their attempts to return the show to normalcy, with Mr. Garrison's return to being the children's teacher in this episode.\n\nThe staff at the studio found the subplot involving the Lemmiwinks ridiculous; Parker recalled watching an animatic and he and Stone being the only ones laughing, while the others sat and stared. The animation crew viewed the sequences as temporary, until Parker informed them that they would be in the final episode. Although few besides the creators found the episode humorous during production, Stone later recalled receiving calls from friends who found the subplot funny, while also remarking, \"That's the most fucked up thing I’ve ever seen.\" The character and plot line originated as a spoof of \"The Lord of the Rings\" and its primary protagonist, Frodo Baggins, who Parker and Stone found a very ineffective and pointless main character. Lemmiwinks was originally a squirrel in a possible live-action \"Lord of the Rings\" parody the duo scrapped. Despite this, a mention of a fictitious program revolving around the Lemmiwinks was mentioned in a 2001 episode of the duo's live action series \"That's My Bush!\".\n\nThe character of Mr. Slave, who is introduced in this episode, is the voice of \"South Park\" staffer John Hansen. The voice originated in conversations with Parker and Stone as an arbitrary, stereotypical homosexual voice.\n\nIn 2010, \"The Daily Telegraph\" mentioned the episode as a moment in which the series solidified its form, writing, \"The episode contains all the ingredients that have helped to transform \"South Park\" into the funniest, cleverest, most corrosive and watchable satire on television.\" According to the paper, \"some fans still regard [it] as the greatest episode.\"\n\nLemmiwinks, alongside The Frog King, The Sparrow Prince and The Catata Fish, later appear in the fifteenth season episode \"Bass to Mouth\" (2011) as well as the 2014 video game \"\".\n\n\n"}

He was a local fixture and something of a celebrity, and was typically found on the footpath in the precincts of Cuba Street and Courtenay Place.\n\nHana was a self-proclaimed devotee of the Māori sun god Tama-nui-te-rā, and claimed that he should wear as few items of clothing as possible, as an act of religious observance. As a result, he would sometimes remove all his clothing, which resulted in the consequent attendance of police officers.\n\nHis name of \"Blanket Man\" was a reference to his usual mode of dress, which was a single blanket, long dreadlocks and either a loin cloth or briefs. His activities and presence provoked a degree of public debate within Wellington.\n\nIt's believed Hana chose to live on the streets after killing a friend in a drink-driving accident as a form of self-penance.\n\nHana was born in Inglewood, New Zealand in 1957 to a Jehovah's Witness family. \n\nIn the late 1970s Hana associated with the Black Power gang, living in Wellington, going by the name \"Bugs\" and fathering two children.\n\nHana was arrested and imprisoned several times for offences including public nudity and possession of cannabis. His criminal record reportedly ran 17 pages long. In 1979, he was convicted of drunk driving causing death.\n\nHana visited the South Island for the first time in 2010, was arrested, charged and flown home after being provided with a shower and new overalls.\n\nIn 2010, a judge ordered that Hana be detained under the Mental Health Act 1992, and he was admitted to Wellington Hospital's psychiatric ward Te Whare O Matairangi, where \"he will have clean clothes, regular meals, and no access to drink and drugs.\" In the same year he was released back onto the streets without any notable change in character. In mid 2011 he was sectioned and detained again, subsequently diagnosed as living with schizophrenia. He was then discharged from hospital and given daily medication under a community treatment order, which allowed forced medical treatment as an outpatient. He mostly resided at his usual location on the central Wellington street of Courtenay Place until his death.\n\nWith his distinctive look and high visibility location, Hana became something of a local celebrity. In general, he was tolerated by some shopkeepers outside whose premises he sat, and by passers-by, although there have been times of opposition from other shopkeepers. Also, on occasions when he decided to push the boundaries of offensive behaviour, police officers were likely to be in attendance. As someone who departed from the patterns of normal behaviour, Hana had become a figure of amusement, sympathy, disgust and even some academic interest. During the 2006 Rugby Sevens tournament, one costumed group appeared in dreads and blankets, mimicking his distinctive look.\n\nHana featured in several works:\n\nHana, age 54, died in Wellington Hospital at 3:35 p.m. on 15 January 2012 of suspected viral myocarditis. However, he was suffering medical problems stemming from heavy alcohol use and malnutrition. A temporary shrine was created outside the ANZ Bank on Courtenay Place, a location where Hana could often be found. Messages were written on the building's facade, and flowers, candles, food and other items were left in tribute.\n\nAmong those who paid tribute were Wellington mayor Celia Wade-Brown and sports athlete Sonny Bill Williams. His funeral was paid for by philanthropist Gareth Morgan.\n\n\n\"Aunt Jemima Prophecy: Cobra Sign\" is a novel by Steve Kenya. It is loosely based on the life of Ben Hana.\n\n"}
{"id": "1869575", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1869575", "title": "Apache tears", "text": "Apache tears\n\n\"Apache tears\" is the popular term for rounded pebbles of obsidian or \"obsidianites\" composed of black or dark-colored natural volcanic glass, usually of rhyolite composition and bearing conchoidal fracture. Also known by the lithologic term \"marekanite\", this variety of obsidian occurs as subrounded to subangular bodies up to about 2 inches in diameter, often bearing indented surfaces. Internally the pebbles sometimes contain fine bands or microlites and though in reflected light they appear black and opaque, they may be translucent in transmitted light. Apache tears fall between 5 and 5.5 in hardness on the Mohs scale.\n\nApache tears originate from siliceous lava flows, lava domes or ash-flow tuffs, often in close association with or embedded in, gray perlite. The spherules occur as cores within perlite masses that typically exhibit texture of concentrically curved, onion-skin fractures. Formation is apparently related to differential cooling and various alkali and water contents. Excessive water present during cooling and quenching of rhyolitic lava causes obsidian to hydrate (i.e., water entering the obsidian glass converts it to perlite). Where perlite is incompletely hydrated, fresh obsidian cores remain as pebbles of marekanite or Apache tears; this origin has been occasionally described in the geologic literature (for example,).\n\nApache tears are well known from tertiary volcanic terrain in numerous localities throughout the western United States, particularly Arizona, from where specimens were widely collected and sold in the lapidary and specimen trade. Several districts in western Nevada also have yielded abundant Apache tears eroding from tuff beds; such areas have been popularized in the lapidary trade through guides for rockhounds. Specimens from many of these sites have been avidly collected by rockhounds and lapidary enthusiasts, are often tumbled and may be considered semi-precious gemstones; locations are noted in the section \"Gemstones of Nevada\" by Rose and Ferdock.\n\nThe name \"Apache tear\" comes from a legend of the Apache tribe: about 75 Apaches and the US Cavalry fought on a mountain overlooking what is now Superior, Arizona, in the 1870s. Facing defeat, the outnumbered Apache warriors rode their horses off the mountain to their deaths rather than be killed. The wives and families of the warriors cried when they heard of the tragedy; their tears turned into stone upon hitting the ground.\n\nAmerican singer songwriter Johnny Cash wrote a song entitled \"Apache Tears\" for his 1964 album \"\".\n\n"}

Papua New Guinea receives an increasing number of visitors each year, with approximately 184,000 international arrivals in 2015.\n\nIn April 1883, James Burns and Robert Philp began a trading partnership, originally named the \"Burns Philp & Company Limited\". They were the first company to offer tourism to New Guinea, in 1884, advertising the 'New Guinea Excursion Trip'. This consisted of a five-week trip from Thursday Island and has been described as the \"official beginning of tourist cruises in the South Pacific\". The company later published a book titled \"Picturesque Travel\".\n\nBy 1914 the Burns Philp Tourist Department was established advertising tours on Lord Howe and Norfolk Island. Acquisition of the Port Moresby Hotel occurred in the same year, with the Papua Hotel purchased some years later. Burns Philp \"maintained a near monopoly on passenger services to Melanesia until the outbreak of the war in the Pacific\". The war saw the British government take over some of the Burns Philp fleet and the vessel \"Macdui\" was sunk in Port Moresby in 1942 as its first voyage as a troop carrier.\n\nThe culture of Papua New Guinea is highly diverse, as implied by the existence of over 800 languages in the country. Styles of cultural expression - carving, dance, singing, ornamentation, architecture, and more - vary greatly across the nation.\n\nPublic festivals which are open to tourists include the Coffee Festivalin Goroka - May, National Mask Festival in Rabaul-July, Mt Hagen Show - August, Goroka Show - September, Hiri Moale Festival in Port Moresby - September, Morobe Show in Lae - October, Kundu & Canoe Festival in Alotau - November.\n\nThe markets are a great drawcard for tourists. Along with local foods, arts and crafts are often on display and can be purchased for reasonable prices. Some of the items on display are traditional carvings and beadwork, traditional and contemporary paintings on canvas and traditionally woven baskets and serving trays. The larger more tourist oriented markets are usually held once a month in the larger towns.\n\nPNG is arguably one of the best diving destinations in the world, having one of the healthiest coral reef systems on the planet.\nIn addition to a large number of reef sites, there are also numerous wrecked World War II boats and aircraft, providing a wealth of Wreck Diving opportunities. Some of the best dive spots are at West New Britain (including Kimbe Bay), Kavieng, Madang, Alotau, Tufi and East New Britain (including Rabaul). The capital, Port Moresby, also offers superb diving.\n\nMany of the diving spots are easily accessible by day trip boat, and there are many sites further out which can be dived from one of the many liveaboards offered locally.\n\nSurfing can be enjoyed all year round. The southern side of PNG includes places such as Hula Beach (100 km from Port Moresby), Milne Bay, Bougainville, and East New Britain which can be surfed from June through to September. In the north of PNG surfing season is mid October to late April. There are great surfing locations which include Madang, Wewak and Kavieng, with the better and more consistent waves found in Vanimo.\n\nThe most famous walking trail in Papua New Guinea is the Kokoda Track, the site of a famous World War II battle between Australia and Japan. Another popular hike is climbing Mount Wilhelm, the highest mountain in Papua New Guinea. There are many more walking tracks, including the very rough Bulldog and Black Cat Tracks.\n\nMany countries have issued travel warnings to their citizens wishing to visit Papua New Guinea, due to its high level of violent crime, slow police response times and poor human rights record.\n\nForeign nationals in Papua New Guinea have become tempting targets to criminals, especially those visiting from wealthier countries are more likely to become victims of violence and crime. Lone foreign females are usually advised not to travel unescorted in Port Moresby and in parts of the Highlands region due to the high risks of unwanted harassment and sexual assault. Travelers are usually advised by their origin countries to seek up-to-date information about the current situation before traveling and to only travel with qualified and experienced tour operator's with extensive knowledge of Papua New Guinea and its local customs. It is generally advised by travel boards to never travel alone or at night in Papua New Guinea.\n\nLGBT travelers are usually advised to avoid traveling to Papua New Guinea entirely because homosexuality is criminalized and prohibited. Those caught engaging in anal sex can be sentenced with up to 14 years imprisonment. Other homosexual acts are punishable with up to 3 years imprisonment.

{"id": "1869577", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1869577", "title": "Jigdo", "text": "Jigdo\n\nJigdo (a portmanteau of \"Jigsaw\" and \"download\") is a utility typically used for downloading to piece together a large file, most commonly an optical disk image such as a CD, DVD or Blu-ray Disc (BD) image, from many smaller individual constituent files. The constituent files may be local and/or retrieved from one or more mirror sites. Jigdo's features are similar to BitTorrent, but unlike BitTorrent, Jigdo uses a client-server model, not peer-to-peer.\n\nJigdo itself is quite portable and is available for many UNIX and Unix-like operating systems,\nand is also available for Microsoft Windows.\n\nReleased under the terms of the GNU General Public License, Jigdo is free software.\n\nA quite common use would be to construct a Linux CD or DVD image for installation or distribution, where a slightly older version or release of same, or a cache or local partial mirror, already contains some or many of the needed constituent files. That would typically proceed as follows: Jigdo would be invoked using the jigdo-lite command, with a command line argument of the URL of a \".jigdo\" file. Jigdo would then download that file, and after examining its contents, would also download a \".template\" file. After inspecting the \".template\" file, Jigdo would prompt for the location of files to scan. The user would then either enter or select from a list the location of files to scan. Jigdo would scan that location for any files that match any of the needed constituent files. Any matching files would be used in constructing the target image. Jigdo prompts again, and if the user gives a location, the process repeats - giving Jigdo the opportunity to scan multiple locations for the needed files. If the user enters no location, Jigdo proceeds to download any unmatched constituent files and to use them to assemble the target image file.\n\nThe jigdo-file utility is generally used to create the \".jigdo\" and \".template\" files needed to create target images using Jigdo.\n\nPresently at least\nDebian and Ubuntu (and some older Fedora releases - see History) make files available for download via Jigdo.\n\nOther projects and sites may also do so or may be doing so - nothing inherently prevents such use.\n\nJigdo was designed to solve several issues. By leveraging redundant available data, Jigdo works to ease loads on mirror systems - both by providing means for such mirror systems to assemble the needed large images while avoiding much redundant downloading, and also by encouraging those downloading from the mirrors to likewise use Jigdo and avoid downloading unneeded redundant data. Additionally, Jigdo can download from multiple mirrors, easing and typically speeding downloads and making them somewhat more resistant to various interruptions in downloading.\n\nJigdo was initially designed to aid in the distribution and downloading of large Debian image files for installation. Development of Jigdo appears to go back to at least 1996‑01.\n\nDebian has been available via Jigdo since at least 2002-01-09\n\nUbuntu has been available via Jigdo since at least 2004-11-12\n\nBy, or sometime after 2006-05 (release of Jigdo version 0.7.3), Jigdo is no longer undergoing active development, but is in \"maintenance mode\" - development has stopped.\n\nFedora has been available via Jigdo since approximately 2008-02-05 with the 9 Alpha release.\nFedora 8 discs as well as many other variants. were also made available via Jigdo. Fedora 15, released 2011-05-24, thus far appears to be the last Fedora release to have been made available via Jigdo by The Fedora Project.\n\nJigdo is no longer undergoing active development, but is in \"maintenance mode\" - development has stopped. Though the command-line tools may be considered finished and \"feature complete\", the GUI client was not completed and does not support multi-image templates, meaning the command-line tools are required. See also Derivatives.\n\nFedora has been developing a Python-based GUI which used Jigdo, called pyJigdo.\n\nIt may be difficult to know accurately how widely distributed and used Jigdo is, however some data are available.\n\nas of 2018 October 3: 0.86% (1,730) of approximately 200,471 reporting Debian systems have Jigdo installed\n\nas of 2018 October 1: 0.27% (7,572) of approximately 2,793,378 reporting Ubuntu systems have Jigdo installed\n\n"}

The follow-up to \"Trout Mask Replica\" (1969), it is regarded by some critics and listeners as superior, and was Van Vliet's favorite. Van Vliet said that the title was an encouragement to \"get rid of the labels\", and to evaluate things according to their merits rather than according to superficial labels (or \"decals\").\n\nMusicians on the album were Don Van Vliet, vocals, harmonica, and woodwinds; Bill Harkleroad, guitar; Mark Boston, bass; Art Tripp, marimba, drums, and percussion; and John French, drums. French had been arranger and musical director on \"Trout Mask Replica\". Van Vliet ejected French from the group—both figuratively and literally, by allegedly throwing him down a flight of stairs—shortly after \"Trout Mask Replica\" was completed, and these roles passed to guitarist Bill Harkleroad. French returned to the group shortly before recording began.\n\nMost of the songs began as piano improvisations by Van Vliet. He would record extended improvisation sessions on a cassette recorder. Harkleroad then listened to these improvisations, picked out the best parts, and pieced them into compositions. The musical lines on \"Decals\" tend to be longer and more intricate than the assemblage of short fragments that characterized much of \"Trout Mask Replica.\"\n\nThe album's liner notes contain two poems or lyrics for songs not present, one untitled and the other \"You Should Know by the Kindness of uh Dog the Way uh Human Should Be\".\n\nCritic Robert Christgau said of the record: \"Beefheart's famous five-octave range and covert totalitarian structures have taken on a playful undertone, repulsive and engrossing and slapstick funny.\" Lester Bangs noted the maturation of Beefheart’s previous musical and lyrical concerns, writing that \"even though the sonic textures are sometimes even more complex and angular than on \"Trout Mask\", ... his messages are universal and warm as the hearth of the America we once dreamed of\".\n\nDue to John Peel's championing of the work on BBC radio, \"Lick My Decals Off, Baby\" spent eleven weeks on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at number twenty. This remains Beefheart's highest-charting album in the UK.\n\nAn early promotional music video was made of its title song, and a bizarre television commercial was also filmed that included excerpts from \"Woe-Is-uh-Me-Bop\", silent footage of masked Magic Band members using kitchen utensils as musical instruments, and Beefheart kicking over a bowl of what appears to be porridge onto a dividing stripe in the middle of a road. The video was rarely played but was accepted into the Museum of Modern Art, where it has been used in several programs.\n\nEnigma Retro released a compact disc edition in 1989; the album has also seen reissue as a 180g vinyl LP, which is still in print. In January 2011, shortly after Van Vliet's death, iTunes and Amazon's MP3 store released the album for download. On November 17, 2014, Rhino Records reissued the album as part of a limited-edition four-disc Beefheart box set \"Sun Zoom Spark: 1970 to 1972\", which also included \"The Spotlight Kid\", \"Clear Spot\", and a disc of outtakes from the three albums. The album was reissued separately, with no bonus tracks, by Rhino on September 25, 2015.\n\nAll songs initially composed by Don Van Vliet. Arranged by Bill Harkleroad.\n\n\nProduction\n"}

It was previously designated as M-171, a former state trunkline highway, until 1960, running from US Highway 23 (US 23) just north of Oscoda, and coming back to US 23 about south of Alpena. The road runs through rural, forested areas of Iosco and Alcona counties, inland from Lake Huron.\n\nAlthough it has been a county road since 1960, F-41 was a state highway in 1919 when the state trunkline highway system was formed. It was a segment of the original M-10 that was replaced by US 23 in 1926. Later changes to US 23 shifted that road closer to Lake Huron, and the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) created two different routings for M-171 out of the former US 23 routings in the area. The second of these highways has been designated F-41 since 1970.\n\nF-41 begins at an intersection with US 23 on the north side of Oscoda. The route travels to the northwest away from town, passing between Van Etten Lake and what was previously Wurtsmith Air Force Base. The road continues north through a rural area of Alcona County on Somers and Mikado roads, running parallel, but inland, to the Lake Huron shoreline. It passes through the small communities of Mikado and Gustin before coming to a junction with M-72. After crossing M-72, F-41 turns east into the community of Lincoln along Traverse Bay State Road, 2nd Street and Main Street before leaving town to the north. The road continues on to the north on Barlow Road through Alcona County before terminating at a second junction with US 23. The highway travels through wooded terrain along its routing.\n\nThe first highway designation to run from Oscoda toward Spruce to Alpena was the original M-10 on July 1, 1919. This segment of highway was later redesignated as a part of US 23 in 1926 when the United States Numbered Highway System was established. Realignments of US 23 created both versions of M-171.\n\nThe initial incarnation of M-171 served as a loop route off US 23 which departed the main highway east of Spruce, traveled west through Spruce, then north past Hubbard Lake and through Wilson before returning to US 23 near Alpena. This roadway was part of US 23 before it was redesignated M-171 in 1932. This routing is now occupied by the present day routings of Spruce, Hubbard Lake and Wilson roads. This version of M-171 was removed from the system in 1934.\nThe second version of M-171 that ran between Oscoda and Caledonia Township in Alcona County was assumed into the state trunkline system in 1936. This was another former segment of US 23. Expansion of the Oscoda Army Air Field (later Wurtsmith Air Force Base) in the early 1940s shifted M-171 eastward, more closely following the west shore of Van Ettan Lake. Portions of the old route were taken up by the expansion, while the rest became part of present-day Skeel Avenue. M-171 existed along the Oscoda to Caledonia Township route for 24 years before being decommissioned in late 1960 or early 1961. The routing was then assigned County Road F-41 after October 5, 1970, and has retained that designation ever since.\n\n"}

It is the first book in the Samaria series of novels.\n\nAngels and mortals, who need one another but have a love-hate relationship, inhabit the land of Samaria. The angels have wings and fly, and are taller and stronger than humans. Legends state that angels were made by Jovah to oversee Samaria under the guidance of the Archangel. The angels are supposed to protect humans, answer their petitions, solve their problems, and intercede to god for them by petitioning the god Jovah through song, especially for rain when the crops need it and the sun when it is stormy. In addition, the angels must sing to Jovah at the annual Gloria held on the Plain of Sharon, otherwise god would destroy the world. The Archangel and his consort, the Angelica, lead this mass in praise of Jovah. Archangels do not serve for life, but every twenty years Jovah selects a new Archangel.\n\nSamaria is divided into three regions, Gaza, Bethel and Jordana, separated by rivers. Each region has an angel hold or fortress that acts as the governing center for the region. The citizens of Gaza, the Manadavvi, are highly cultured and wealthy. The Jansai, who are calculating and greedy merchants, and run the Edori slave trade inhabit Jordana. The Edori are the wanderers and frequently become enslaved by the Jansai.\n\nThe Oracle has declared that the angel Gabriel is to be the next Archangel. However, Raphael, the current Archangel, who is corrupt and uses his position for himself, does not want to step down. Gabriel has an additional problem in that he procrastinated getting married. He tracks down the mortal that god has selected be his wife, but she has her own thoughts about the marriage and the expectations of her as the archangel’s consort, the Angelica. Rachel, an Edori slave, dislikes angels because of what they had done to her family when she was younger. Gabriel is faced with many trials having to contend with Raphael on the one hand, and his reluctant wife, who is a constant thorn-in-the-side. But the trials and tribulations confronting Gabriel and Rachel brings them close together and they finally realize that they love each other. The story ends with Gabriel and Rachael singing together at the Gloria, thus satisfying the wishes of the god.\n\n"}

Eisenhower Presidential Library, Museum and Boyhood Home\n\nThe Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library, Museum and Boyhood Home is the presidential library and museum of Dwight David Eisenhower, the 34th President of the United States (1953–1961), located in his hometown of Abilene, Kansas. The museum also includes his boyhood home, where he lived from 1898 until being appointed to West Point in 1911, and his final resting place. It is one of the thirteen presidential libraries under the auspices of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).\n\nAdmission to the Visitor Center, Place of Meditation (gravesite), and the archives is free. Admission to the museum is $20 for adults and includes a tour of the Boyhood Home. The complex is open every day except New Year's Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas.\n\nThe Eisenhower Presidential complex is only one of two whose creation preceded the close of a presidency, and while this is obviously the case with his boyhood home, construction of the library itself began in 1958, and the museum portion before he even took office, coinciding with the then-General's announcement of his presidential candidacy in June 1952.\n\nAs World War II came to an end, local admirers of the Supreme Commander of Allied forces in Europe decided to honor him with a museum. In 1945, a non-profit foundation in his name was created to purchase his boyhood home and build the museum on the same property. It was to house artifacts from veterans, and the honors of Eisenhower in particular. At the time, the General's mother Ida was still alive and refused to sell the property. When she died in 1946, another purchase attempt was made. However, the fund-raising tactics of the foundation offended Eisenhower, and this almost scuttled the project. New fundraising rules were established for the Foundation after its discussion with Ike's youngest brother Milton, and agreement by all the Eisenhower brothers. They ultimately donated the house to the Foundation, and the entire site, in south Abilene, later became the Eisenhower Presidential Center.\n\nMrs. Eisenhower's home opened to the public as a museum on June 22, 1947. and the cornerstone of an Eisenhower/World War II museum was laid in June 1952 by the General himself, just before he accepted the draft and formally announced his candidacy for President.\n\nThe museum was completed in 1954, and the President was in attendance when it was formally opened on November 11 of that year. He was impressed by the results, and told the leadership of the foundation that if they could raise the money to build a facility, he would donate his papers and other materials to it.\n\nA fundraising campaign launched in 2015 seeks to refresh and expand the museum's exhibits in 2018. If plans remain the same, the museum would be closed for about a year while the remainder of the site would remain open as usual.\n\nWith the fundraising constraints on the foundation still in place in 1954, the Kansas Legislature took up the slack, authorizing a separate \"Eisenhower Presidential Library Commission,\" and over the next five years enough money was raised to begin construction. Again, President Eisenhower was present when ground was broken on October 13, 1959. The project took three years to complete, and Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson joined the retired President Eisenhower at the dedication on May 1, 1962.\n\nOperation of the site was turned over to the NARA in 1966, when it became the fourth library in the system.\n\nThe campus has five buildings:\n\n\nAlso on the site:\n\n\n"}

Previously Joseph had found Mary to be pregnant and had considered leaving her. In this verse an angel comes to him in a dream and reassures him.\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe World English Bible translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 1:20\n\nThis is the first of several dream sequences in Matthew. Like the others, but unlike those of the Old Testament, these dreams are very straightforward with no interpretation required.\n\nAlbright and Mann note that while the Greek word \"angelos\" is commonly translated as angel it could just as well mean a generic divine messenger. The portrayal of an angel in this verse does not match the more common version, which has them appear as men like beings in the physical world.\n\nThe angel refers to Joseph as the \"son of David\". This again emphasizes Jesus' legal Davidic status, the theme of the earlier genealogy.\n\nBy \"take Mary as your wife\" the angel is referring to the second stage of the Jewish marriage ritual that saw the bride move into the husband's house. The Greek, and the content of the rest of the chapter, makes clear that \"take\" is not a euphemism for sexual relations.\n\nWhy Joseph should \"fear\" to love Mary is an important question. Gundry asserts that if he suspected Mary of adultery he would not be in fear. Gundry thus feels that this choice of words demonstrates that Joseph knew of the Virgin Birth before the dream and his fear was in angering God by interfering in his divine plan. This is in keeping with Luke where Mary has already been informed for some time before about the nature of her pregnancy. Boring notes that \"do not be afraid\" is a standard angelic opening line in the Bible that also appears in , , , , and .\n\nThe same note about the use of the term Holy Spirit applies here as in . The author of Matthew refers to a divine spirit in general, not the specific nature of the Holy Ghost of the Trinity which would only be developed some time later.\n\nThe word most often translated as \"conceived\", does not specifically mean biologically conceived. As in English it can also more generally mean created or imagined. Jane Schaberg argues that this verse thus does not rule out the idea that Jesus could also have had a human biological father.

Braun (April 20, 1929 – January 15, 2001) was an American local television and radio personality, best known for a program originating in Cincinnati, Ohio named \"The Bob Braun Show\". The show, which he hosted from 1967 to 1984, had the highest Arbitron and Nielsen ratings of any live entertainment/information program in the Midwest. Originating at WLWT, the 90-minute show originally was syndicated to three other cities in the Midwest. Eventually, more television stations joined the line-up. Braun's show featured a live band, singers, and special guests including Bob Hope (a frequent guest), Lucille Ball, Johnny Carson, Paul Lynde, Red Skelton, Phyllis Diller, Dick Clark and NFL-star Jim Brown. Politicians including Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, John Glenn, and Ted Kennedy were also guests.\n\nThe local Cincinnati television show titled \"The 50-50 Club\" had occupied the time slot that Braun eventually filled. \"The 50-50 Club\" hostess, Ruth Lyons, retired in 1967 due to declining health. Braun had appeared regularly on \"The 50-50 Club\" show since 1957, and frequently had been a fill-in host. On his own show, Braun heavily promoted and supported Lyons' charity, \"The Ruth Lyons Christmas Fund,\" each Christmas season. (The charity, now known as \"The Ruth Lyons Children's Fund,\" remains in operation to this day.) Some years after Braun took over the show, the title was changed from \"The 50-50 Club\" to \"The Bob Braun Show\". (An ad in a 1969 issue of \"TV Guide\" identifies it as \"Bob Braun's 50-50 Club\".) Toward the end of its run in the 1980s, it was renamed \"Braun and Company\".\n\nRegular cast members on \"The Bob Braun Show\" included Rob Reider, Mary Ellen Tanner, Nancy James, baritone Mark Preston (member of The Lettermen), and announcer/weatherman Bill Myers. Beginning with the telecast on the daytime schedule of Friday, June 7, 1968, an entertainment critic for a Columbus, Ohio newspaper, Ron Pataky, visited Cincinnati every Friday to discuss on Braun's television show which movies were playing in cinemas that weekend. Pataky continued making his Friday appearances until 1973. The longtime director of \"The 50-50 Club\", \"Bob Braun's 50-50 Club\" and \"The Bob Braun Show\" was Dick Murgatroyd, who years later became the county-judge executive of Kenton County, Kentucky.\n\nThe Department of Photographs and Films at the Cincinnati Museum Center has videotapes of \"The Bob Braun Show\" and \"Braun and Company\" that were preserved starting in 1982. All episodes of Braun's daytime show that were telecast prior to 1982 were lost because of wiping. Evidently, in 1969, Braun did a prime-time special on which Nick Clooney and his young son George were guests. George talked on-camera about his recent tonsillectomy, and that broadcast was preserved.\n\nBob Braun began his career at the age of thirteen with WSAI Radio, hosting a Saturday morning Knothole Baseball sports show. He joined WCPO-TV in 1949. In 1957, after winning the $1,000 top prize on television's \"Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts\" talent show, Braun was immediately hired by WLWT and WLW-AM. After cutting a handful of unsuccessful pop vocal recordings for labels such as Fraternity and Torch, Braun signed to Decca Records and charted his only Top 40 hit, \"Till Death Do Us Part,\" in 1962. Braun later recorded for United Artists, but most of his subsequent recording efforts were released on small independent or vanity labels. In the mid-1970s he briefly hosted a local game show called \"On The Money\". Braun was one of Cincinnati's biggest TV stars until 1984, when he moved to California for ten years to do commercials, talk shows and small movie roles. During that time, he was most often seen as the spokesperson for Craftmatic adjustable beds and announcer for controversial no-money-down real estate promoter Tony Hoffman, who later produced and marketed a recorded interview with O. J. Simpson. Braun also had a part in the Bruce Willis movie \"Die Hard 2.\"\n\nIn 1993, he was inducted into the Cincinnati Radio Hall of Fame. In March 1994, Braun left Hollywood and returned to WSAI Radio (by then featuring an adult standards musical format) as one of \"The Sunrise Boys,\" working as the morning host alongside his nephew, \"Bucks\" Braun (himself a successful radio personality in nearby Dayton, Ohio) and newsman Don Herman. In June 1997, Mayor Roxanne Qualls and the entire City Council honored him with \"Bob Braun Day in Cincinnati\".\n\nBraun retired on November 24, 1999, after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. His show business career had spanned a half century. He was replaced on WSAI by Nick Clooney.\n\nBraun died of Parkinson's and cancer in 2001 and was buried in Cincinnati's Spring Grove Cemetery. He was survived by his wife, Wray Jean, and three children: Rob, Doug, and Melissa. Rob later worked at WKRC-TV as its primary news anchorman.\nOn June 25, 2019, \"The New York Times Magazine\" listed Bob Braun among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.\n\n\n"}

His career included participation in the American Civil War. Significant roles included coroner of Kent County, Ontario, and surgeon-in-chief.\n\nAnderson Abbott was born on 7 April 1837 in Toronto to Wilson Ruffin and Ellen Toyer Abbott. The Abbotts were a prominent Black family in Toronto, who had left Alabama – as free people of colour – after their store had been ransacked. After first living a short time in New York, they settled in Upper Canada in 1835 or 1836. Wilson Abbott soon began to purchase real estate, in and around Toronto, where he owned 48 properties by 1871. The senior Abbott also became active in politics.\n\nThe family's prosperity allowed Anderson Abbott to receive an excellent education. He attended both private and public schools, including William King's school, in the black Elgin settlement (now North Buxton, Ontario). He was an honour student at the Toronto Academy and later attended Oberlin College in Ohio. He returned to Canada and in 1857, entered University College in Toronto and in 1858, became a medical student at the Toronto School of Medicine. He studied under Alexander Thomas Augusta, a black physician who was born in the U.S. Although he did not graduate, Abbott received a license to practise from the Medical Board of Upper Canada, in 1861, thus becoming the first Canadian-born Black physician.\n\nIn 1866, Abbott resigned from service to the Union Army and returned to Canada. He attended primary medical classes at the University of Toronto the following year. While he did not graduate, he established a medical practice and was admitted to the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario in 1871. In an Anglican wedding ceremony in Toronto on 9 August 1871, he married Mary Ann Casey, the 18-year-old daughter of a successful Black barber. Abbott and his wife moved to Chatham where he resumed his medical practice. They eventually had three daughters and two sons.\n\nLike his father, Abbott soon became an important member of the Black community in Toronto. From 1873 to 1880, he fought against racially segregated schools as president of the Wilberforce Educational Institute and was appointed coroner for Kent County, Ontario, in 1874, the first Black man to hold that office. Abbott contributed to a local newspaper, the \"Chatham Planet\", and was associate editor of the \"Missionary Messenger\", the journal of the local British Methodist Episcopal Church. Abbott was made president of both the Chatham Literary and Debating Society and the Chatham Medical Society in 1878. Abbott moved his medical practice to Dundas, Ontario, in 1881 where he also served in some important community roles including trustee of that community's high school and chairman of the town's internal management committee from 1885 to 1889. He also worked as an administrator for the Dundas Mechanics' Institute.\n\nThe family moved to Oakville, Ontario in 1889 but returned to Toronto the following year. He was elected a member of the local post of the Grand Army of the Republic and one of 273 Civil War veterans in Toronto to wear the badge of that fraternity. He was then known as \"Captain Abbott\", a rank which might reflect his office within the Grand Army of the Republic rather than his actual rank during the American Civil War. In November 1892, Abbott was appointed aide-de-camp on the Staff of the Commanding Officers Dept. of New York. A source of great pride for Abbott and his family, this was the highest military honour ever bestowed on a Black person in Canada or the United States.\n\nIn 1894, Abbott was appointed surgeon-in-chief at Provident Hospital in Chicago, the first training hospital for Black nurses in the United States. He became the hospital's medical superintendent In 1896 but resigned the following year. Returning to Toronto, Abbott resumed his private practice and became more involved with writing for various publications including \"The Colored American Magazine\" of Boston and New York, the \"Anglo-American Magazine\" of London (for which he wrote \"Some recollections of Lincoln's assassination\"), and \"New York Age\". Medicine, Black history, the Civil War, Darwinism, biology, and poetry were among his topics.\n\nAt the turn of the century Abbott became embroiled in the debate between W. E. B. Du Bois and Booker T. Washington over social change. Siding with Du Bois, Abbott believed that Black access to higher education was essential and should not be compromised. Believing that blacks would be culturally assimilated, Abbott wrote: \"It is just as natural for two races living together on the same soil to blend as it is for the waters of two river tributaries to mingle.\" With Canada's black population on the decline, he thought this was especially true in his own country and wrote \"by the process of absorption and expatriation the colour line will eventually fade out in Canada\".\n\nAnderson Ruffin Abbott died in 1913, at the age of 76, in the Toronto home of his son-in-law, Frederick Langdon Hubbard, (Toronto Transportation Commission Chairman from 1929 to 1930, and son of his long-time friend William Peyton Hubbard). He is buried in the Toronto Necropolis.\n"}

Alvord began his career in law enforcement in 1886 as a deputy under Sheriff John Slaughter in Cochise County, Arizona, but turned to train robbery by the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nAlbert W. Alvord was born to Charles E. Alvord and his wife Lucy on September 11, 1867, in Plumas County, California. His father, a native of New York, worked as a prospector and mechanic for mining companies, but eventually came to hold public offices such as constable and justice of the peace in several of the places that the family lived. The family moved frequently throughout Burt’s childhood, following the mining business from boomtown to boomtown. In 1879, the family settled in Pima County, Arizona Territory, but soon moved to Tombstone in Cochise County.\n\nAlvord’s education was informal, but he likely learned much from his father’s cases about local disputes. He also spent time working at the O.K. Corral where he got to know the townspeople very well. Claims that Alvord witnessed the famous Gunfight at the O.K. Corral in 1881 are unsubstantiated, though the banditry and lawlessness for which Tombstone was famous would certainly have made an impression on the young Alvord.\n\nDespite Alvord’s reputation for frequenting saloons and his participation in several bar altercations, Cochise County Sheriff John Horton Slaughter recruited Alvord as a deputy in 1886. The same year, Alvord’s mother died. Alvord served primarily as the muscle behind Slaughter's operations; he made several decisions which revealed his lack of experience and finesse in law enforcement. He was reportedly “not noble, temperate, far seeing, or unselfish”. He did assist Slaughter in capturing or killing several rustlers and other outlaws between 1886 and 1889, but his reputation suffered when his alcoholism became increasingly apparent. Alvord continued to frequent saloons and eventually began to associate with gamblers and suspected outlaws. When Slaughter reprimanded him, he quit.\n\nAlvord next worked as a lawman in several towns in the 1890s, including Fairbank, Arizona and Pearce, Arizona. In 1896, Alvord moved to Cochise County, where he married Lola Ochoa, bought a ranch, and settled down. Once again he became a sheriff’s deputy. Unfortunately, his life took a turn for the worse just two years later, when his father died. In late December 1899, Alvord suddenly and inexplicably resigned his post of deputy sheriff.\n\nAlmost immediately after turning in his badge, Alvord left his wife and turned to crime. He formed a gang with outlaws Billy Stiles, Bill Downing, and \"Three Fingered Jack\" Dunlop, men he had once pursued during his career as a law officer. Alvord's gang committed several armed robberies in Cochise County, where he and Stiles were both captured. Somehow, they managed to escape. On February 15, 1900, Dunlop was killed by lawman Jeff Milton during a bungled train robbery in Fairbank, Arizona, and gang recruit Bravo Juan Yoas was wounded. Later that year, Alvord was again captured and taken to Tombstone. Billy Stiles rode to Tombstone and wounded the deputy on duty, allowing Alvord and 24 other prisoners to escape.\n\nIn 1902, Alvord assisted Arizona Rangers Captain Burton C. Mossman in capturing the notorious Mexican bandit Augustine Chacon, in exchange for a share of the reward money and a reduced sentence. When Chacon was convicted of murder and hung at Solomonville, Alvord decided it was wiser not to surrender after all. Alvord and Stiles instead returned to crime, now pursued by the Arizona Rangers. They were captured in December 1903, but again managed to escape. Alvord even made a crude attempt at faking their deaths, using the bodies of two unknown Mexicans. Alvord sent the bodies to Tombstone, claiming they were himself and Stiles. However, an examination quickly showed the dead men were not the two \"gringos\".\n\nThe irritated Arizona Rangers finally pursued the outlaws across the international border into Mexico, trapping them near Naco in February 1904. The outlaws resisted, but surrendered after both were wounded. Alvord spent two years in the Yuma Territorial Prison. Following his release, he announced he was going by ship to start anew in Central America. He was last seen in 1910 working as a Panama Canal employee. Following this, Alvord's fate is unknown.\n\nIn 1955, Alvord and Stiles were portrayed by Chris Drake and Paul Sorensen in an episode of the syndicated television series \"Stories of the Century\", starring Jim Davis. Bing Russell played Alvord in the 1963 episode \"The Measure of a Man\" of the syndicated series \"Death Valley Days\", narrated by Stanley Andrews. In the story line, Alvord, with a serious arm injury, is promised a light sentence if he will surrender and deliver the whereabouts of the notorious bandit Augustine Chacon (Michael Pate). Rory Calhoun plays the Arizona Ranger Burton C. Mossman, who works to capture Chacon and return him to be hanged for an earlier conviction.\n\nAccording to historian David Leighton, Alvord Road in Tucson, Arizona is named for the lawman-turned-outlaw.\n\n\n"}

Baird, 405 U.S. 438 (1972), is a United States Supreme Court case that established the right of unmarried people to possess contraception on the same basis as married couples.\n\nThe Court struck down a Massachusetts law prohibiting the distribution of contraceptives to unmarried people for the purpose of preventing pregnancy, ruling that it violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution.\n\nWilliam Baird was charged with a felony for distributing contraceptive foams after lectures on birth control and population control at Boston University. The prearranged violation of the law occurred on April 6, 1967 when Baird handed a condom and a package of contraceptive foam to a 19-year-old woman. Under Massachusetts law on \"Crimes against chastity\" (Chapter 272, section 21A), contraceptives could be distributed only by registered doctors or pharmacists, and only to married persons.\n\nAfter Baird was convicted, an appeal resulted in partial overturn by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, which concluded that the lectures were covered by First Amendment protections. However, the court affirmed the conviction under contraceptive distribution laws. Baird filed a petition for a federal writ of habeas corpus, which was refused by the federal district court. Upon appeal, The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit vacated the dismissal and remanded the action with directions to grant the writ, and dismiss the charge, reasoning that the Massachusetts law infringed on fundamental human rights of unmarried couples as guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This ruling was then appealed to the United States Supreme Court, by Sheriff Eisenstadt, who had prosecuted the case, on the ground that Baird lacked standing to appeal, being neither an authorized distributor under the statute nor a single person.\n\nIn a 6–1 decision (Justices Rehnquist and Powell were not sworn in on time to participate in the case), the Court upheld both Baird's standing to appeal and the First Circuit's decision on the basis of the Equal Protection Clause, but did not reach the Due Process issues. The majority opinion was written by Justice William J. Brennan Jr. and joined by three other justices, William O. Douglas, Potter Stewart, and Thurgood Marshall. Brennan reasoned that, since Massachusetts did not (and perhaps could not under \"Griswold v. Connecticut\") enforce its law against married couples, the law worked irrational discrimination by denying the right to possess contraceptives by unmarried couples. He found that Massachusetts's law was not designed to protect public health and lacked a rational basis.\n\nBrennan, writing for the Court, made four principal observations:\n\n\nJustice Douglas, concurring, argued that since Baird was engaged in speech while distributing vaginal foam, his arrest was prohibited by the First Amendment.\n\nJustice White, joined by Justice Blackmun, did not join Brennan's opinion but concurred in the judgment on narrower grounds. White and Blackmun declined to reach the issue of whether Massachusetts could limit distribution of contraceptives only to married couples. They argued that Massachusetts had asserted an implausible health rationale for limiting distribution of vaginal foam to licensed pharmacists or physicians.\n\nChief Justice Burger dissented alone, arguing that there were no conclusive findings available to the Court on the health risks of vaginal foam since that issue had not been presented to the lower courts, and thus no basis for the Court's finding that the Massachusetts statute served no public health interest. Burger also held that the Massachusetts statute independently advanced the state's interest in ensuring couples receive informed medical advice on contraceptives.\n\nWhile Brennan's ruling conceded that states may prohibit sex outside of marriage, later cases have interpreted its most famous sentence—\"If the right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child.\"—as recognizing the right of single people to procreate on the same basis as married couples, reasoning which would eventually be extended to a more general right to engage in sexual activity. \"Carey v. Population Services International\", decided in 1977, struck down a New York law forbidding distribution of contraceptives to those under 16 but failed to produce a majority opinion and thus is not widely cited. \"Bowers v. Hardwick\" in 1986 rejected the claim of homosexuals to a fundamental right to engage in sodomy. However, \"Lawrence v. Texas\" overruled \"Bowers\" in 2003, citing \"Eisenstadt\" in support of this ruling, and recognized that consenting adults had a right to engage in private, consensual non-commercial sexual intercourse. Roy Lucas, a prominent abortion rights lawyer, assessed the case as \"among the most influential in the United States during the entire [20th] century by any manner or means of measurement.\" \"Eisenstadt v. Baird\" is mentioned in over 52 Supreme Court cases from 1972 through 2002. Each of the eleven U.S. Court of Appeals Circuit, as well as the Federal Circuit, has cited \"Eisenstadt v. Baird\" as authority. The highest courts of all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico have cited \"Eisenstadt v. Baird\".\n\n\n"}

This success would only grow with their next album \"Practice What You Preach\". \"The New Order\" was also the first Testament album to enter the \"Billboard\" 200, reaching number 136 on that chart. It was also the band's first album to include an instrumental track. The album contains many songs that the band still plays live to this day including \"Into the Pit\", \"The Preacher\", \"The New Order\", \"Disciples of the Watch\", and \"Trial by Fire\". \"Into the Pit\", \"The New Order\", and \"Disciples of the Watch\" are among Testament's most frequently performed songs; all three of which have been played live over 600 times with the former of the three being their most played song live.\n\nOne of Testament's earliest songs dating back to their period as Legacy, \"Reign of Terror\", was reportedly recorded during the sessions of \"The New Order\", but was left off the album. This re-recorded version of \"Reign of Terror\" can be found as a b-side to the \"Trial by Fire\" single as well as the band's 1993 EP \"Return to the Apocalyptic City\". The song would be re-recorded again in 2001 for the album \"First Strike Still Deadly\".\n\nReviews for \"The New Order\" have generally been favorable. Allmusic's Alex Henderson awards the album four-and-a-half stars out of five, and claims that Testament \"delivered its best offering ever\" and describes it as \"every bit as brutally forceful as \"The Legacy\".\" He also called the album the \"ideal choice.\"\n\n\"The New Order\" entered the \"Billboard\" 200 album charts in August 1988, three months after its release. The album peaked at number 136 and remained on the chart for thirteen weeks, making it Testament's longest run so far. \"Trial By Fire\" and \"The Preacher\" were released as singles, but neither of them charted.\n\nBy 1990, \"The New Order\" had sold over 250,000 copies in the U.S.\n\nIn August 2014, \"Revolver\" placed \"The New Order\" on its \"14 Thrash Albums You Need to Own\" list.\n\nTestament toured for three months to promote \"The New Order\". They toured Europe shortly after its release alongside thrash acts Megadeth, Sanctuary, Flotsam and Jetsam and Nuclear Assault. This was followed by a summer U.S. tour, which featured support from Vio-Lence, Forbidden, Voivod, Sanctuary, Destruction, Overkill, Nuclear Assault, Carnivore, Death Angel, Atheist and Potential Threat. They toured Europe again in August, replacing Megadeth on the Monsters of Rock tour. After playing two shows in San Francisco in December 1988, and one show with Heathen at the Country Club in Reseda in January 1989, Testament began work on their third studio album \"Practice What You Preach\".\n\n\n\n"}

The GameCube version was only released in North America. Players move about on a virtual game board, with the object of the game being to reach the end first. It allows for up to four players, featuring six characters from other Namco games to choose from: Pac-Man (\"Pac-Man\"), Astaroth (\"Soulcalibur\"), Heihachi Mishima (\"Tekken\"), Ms. Pac-Man (\"Pac-Man\"), Tiger Jackson (\"Tekken\"), and Reiko Nagase (\"Ridge Racer\").\n\nThere are three different types of game boards to play—Tropical, Space, and Medieval—each with its own set of minigames. After selecting a board, players can also choose to play a short, medium, or long game, each having a different number of tiles that corresponded to the length's name.\n\nThe object of the game is to get to the finish first. The game is played in rounds; each round begins with a four-player minigame, the results of which determine how many spaces each player moves forward on the board. Each tile on the board also has an effect. These include moving forward/going backward some number of steps, stealing/losing/gaining tokens, playing a single/two-player/free-for-all minigame, the ability to spend earned tokens, and a raffle game to earn redemption tickets with cherry, orange, or banana raffle tickets. When on a \"store\" tile, the player can spend tokens to move steps forward, move others backward, buy raffle tickets, multiply the amount of spaces moved next turn, or gamble to earn more tokens.\n\nThe three spaces before the goal space are special raffle spaces (cherry, orange, and banana, respectively). In addition to functioning as a raffle space for the first player that reaches them (and as a token space thereafter), a player must place a certain rank or better in a minigame (3rd, 2nd, and 1st, for the cherry, orange, and banana tiles, respectively) in order to progress to the next space while on these tiles. If a player attains 1st place in a minigame while on the banana space, they advance to the goal space.\n\nOnce a player has reached the end, the game is over and players will receive redemption tickets based on how far they got on the board. These can then be used to buy each minigame separately, which can be played in short tournaments outside the main game. Alternatively, once all minigames have been bought, the player can let the tickets tally up to see their overall high score.\n\n\"Pac-Man Fever\" received mixed reviews. Matt Casamassina of IGN gave the GameCube version a 4.9/10 and the PlayStation 2 version a 4.5/10. While the sound was praised, the gameplay and graphics were criticized.\n\nReview aggregator Metacritic gave the GameCube version a 54 out of 100, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\", while the PS2 version received a 47 out of 100, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\".\n\nRyan Davis of \"GameSpot\" gave both versions of the game a 5.2/10, disliking the lack of variety in the minigames and the slow pace on the boards.\n"}

{"id": "1869733", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1869733", "title": "Hamilton Burger", "text": "Hamilton Burger\n\nHamilton Burger is the fictional Los Angeles County District Attorney (D.A.) in the long-running series of novels, films, and radio and television programs featuring Perry Mason, the fictional defense attorney created by Erle Stanley Gardner.\n\nHamilton Burger first appears in chapter 10 of Gardner's 1935 novel, \"The Case of the Counterfeit Eye\", in which he is described as \"a broad-shouldered, thick-necked individual with a close-cropped moustache\". Gardner describes Burger in the cast of characters of that novel as an \"honest but stubborn\" D.A. In chapter 15 of \"The Case of the Caretaker's Cat\" (1935), Burger's residential address is given as 3297 West Lakeside, and his phone number is EXposition 9-6949.\n\nBurger is one of literature's least successful district attorneys, and critics have suggested that he must have been the most incompetent lawyer in history, although his record against defense attorneys other than Mason is unknown. Burger's cases inevitably involved prosecuting the wrong person, who was defended by Mason, who in the end, revealed the true criminal through a series of tactics that Burger characterized as courtroom tricks. Burger's bag of tricks was comparatively empty, chiefly comprising indignant exclamations of, \"Incompetent, irrelevant, and immaterial!\" Once Mason had exposed the true perpetrator, Burger often joined in Mason's motion to the judge to dismiss the charges against Mason's client so that Burger could then charge the actual wrongdoer. A scene from the television series in which Mason consoles Burger after such a dismissal effort was claimed by Sonia Sotomayor to have inspired her to become a prosecutor.\n\nHamilton Burger appeared in the fifth installment of the Warner Bros. Perry Mason movie series of the 1930s, \"The Case of the Black Cat.\" He was portrayed by Guy Usher. The character, now portrayed by Charles C. Wilson, played a larger role in the sixth and final film in the series, \"The Case of the Stuttering Bishop.\n\nBurger was portrayed by William Talman in the long-running CBS-TV series \"Perry Mason\" (1957–66). Asked about how he felt about Burger losing to Mason week after week, Talman said, \"Burger doesn't lose. How can a district attorney lose when he fails to convict an innocent person? Unlike a fist or gun fight, in court you can have a winner without having a loser. As a matter of fact Burger in a good many instances has joined Mason in action against unethical attorneys, lying witnesses, or any one else obstructing justice. Like any real-life district attorney, justice is Burger's main interest.\"\n\nBurger did defeat Mason twice on the television series: in \"The Case of the Terrified Typist\" (episode 1-38), and in \"The Case of the Deadly Verdict\" (episode 7-4), a much-publicized episode that begins with Mason's client being sentenced to death.\n\nThe character of Hamilton Burger temporarily disappeared from the TV series during the series' third season. Talman was fired by CBS March 18, 1960, hours after he entered a not-guilty plea to misdemeanor charges related to his presence at a party that was raided by police. The schedule was immediately juggled to minimize Talman's presence on the show. \"The Case of the Crying Cherub\" (episode 3-20) debuts a pared-down title sequence that omits Talman; he is credited only in the four episodes he filmed before he was fired. Talman was defended by the show's executive producer Gail Patrick Jackson, Raymond Burr and others, but even dismissal of the charges in June did not soften the network's position. Patrick said that the role of Burger would not be recast, but that various actors would play assistant district attorneys. CBS reinstated Talman only after Gardner himself spoke out, together with millions of viewers. Talman went back to work in December 1960, and Burger returned in \"The Case of the Fickle Fortune\" (episode 4-15).\n\nIn the short-lived CBS-TV series, \"The New Perry Mason\" (1973–74), Burger was played by Harry Guardino.\n\nTalman had passed away by the time of the Perry Mason television movies of the 1980s and 1990s, but his character was referenced in the first of the series, \"Perry Mason Returns\". In it, a cocky young deputy prosecutor describes her case against Mason's client as a \"dead-bang winner,\" to which the District Attorney replies, \"You know how many times Hamilton Burger said that?\"\n\nIn her confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee in July 2009, Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor prefaced her remarks on the role of the prosecutor by claiming that she was inspired by watching \"Perry Mason\" as a child. \"I was influenced so greatly by a television show in igniting the passion that I had as being a prosecutor, and it was \"Perry Mason\"\", Sotomayor said.\n\nIn her 2013 memoir the Supreme Court justice wrote of the show's influence on her while she was growing up in a Bronx housing project. Sotomayor granted that the defense attorney was the show's hero, \"but my sympathies were not entirely monopolized by Perry Mason. I was fond of Burger, the prosecutor, too. I liked that he was a good loser, that he was more committed to finding the truth than to winning his case. If the defendant was truly innocent, he once explained, and the case was dismissed, then he had done his job because justice had been served.\"\n"}

The band is known for playing dark music heavily influenced by 20th-century chamber music.\n\nIn 1973, Claude Deron and Daniel Denis, both former members of Belgian \"Zeuhl\" band Arkham (which had disbanded the previous year), set up a new group, Necronomicon. By that time, apart from Deron (trumpet) and Denis (drums), the group consisted of Roger Trigaux (guitar), Guy Segers (bass guitar), Patrick Hanappier (violin) and John Van Rymenant (sax), and, later on, Vincent Motoulle (keyboards). At the time, Guy Denis (percussion) took part in some shows and rehearsals and Jean-Luc Manderlier (keyboards) was present only during rehearsals. Necronomicon was renamed Univers Zero in 1974.\n\nFor a time, Univers Zero were part of a musical movement called Rock in Opposition (RIO) which strove to create dense challenging music, a direct contrast to the disco and punk music being produced in the late 1970s. Obvious early influences were Bartók and Stravinsky, however the band also cited less well known composers such as Albert Huybrechts, who was also Belgian.\n\nWhereas their early albums were almost entirely acoustic, featuring oboes, spinets, harmoniums and Mellotrons, their 1980s albums tended to rely more on synthesizer and electric guitar, sounding much more electric.\n\nIn 1977, they released their first eponymous album \"Univers Zero\", later remixed and renamed as \"1313\". The album shows a heavy rock and roll approach despite the fact that the instrumentation was largely acoustic. This is mostly due to the use of drums and bass guitar. Two years later the album \"Heresie\" proved to be even darker. Subsequent albums lightened the sound only slightly but became ever more electric.\n\nDespite these changes, their overall sound remained fairly consistent.\n\nThe group disbanded in 1987 but reformed in 1999. In the interim, drummer Daniel Denis released two solo albums and joined Art Zoyd, a similar band from France. Since 1999, Univers Zéro have released five studio albums.\n\nIn 2003, Univers Zéro had retired from live performance with Daniel Denis being quoted as saying that only something like a festival would make it financially worthwhile. Coincidentally soon after, they were invited to headline the first day of NEARfest in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania in June 2004. In 2011, they joined forces with Belgian groups Present and Aranis to form a 17-member ensemble called Once Upon a Time in Belgium. They premiered at the fourth edition of the Rock in Opposition festival held in Carmaux, France in September 2011, where they performed \"New York Transformations\", a work composed by Kurt Budé. Once Upon a Time in Belgium and Univers Zéro appear in the documentary film \"\".\n\n\n"}

This was also a tea trade route. It is also sometimes referred to as the Southern Silk Road or Southwest Silk Road, and it is part of a complex routes system connecting China and South Asia.\n\nThere are numerous surviving archaeological and monumental elements, including trails, bridges, way stations, market towns, palaces, staging posts, shrines and temples along the route. Besides the route's importance for commercial activity, more significantly it was crucial for cultural exchange between the Indian subcontinent, Tibet and Southwest China. Especially, it was vitally important for the interchange of Buddhism between China and South Asia.\n\nSichuan and Yunnan are believed to be the first tea-producing regions in the world. The first record of tea cultivation in the world suggested that tea was cultivated on Sichuan's Mount Mengding (蒙顶山) between Chengdu and Ya'an earlier than 65 BC. Ya'an has been an important hub of tea trading till the 20th century. Besides tea, silk products from Chengdu, notably Shujin (蜀锦), was also traded through this road to South Asian from around 2000 years ago.\n\nFrom around a thousand years ago, the Tea Horse Road was a trade link from Yunnan to Bengal via Myanmar; to Tibet; and to Central China via Sichuan Province. In addition to tea, the mule caravans carried salt. Both people and horses carried heavy loads, the tea porters sometimes carrying over 60–90 kg (132-198 lb.), which was often more than their own body weight in tea. The porters carried metal-tipped staffs, both for balance while walking and to help support the load while they rested, so they didn't need to lay the bales down (as illustrated in the photo).\n\nIt is believed that it was through this trading network that tea (typically tea bricks) first spread across China and Asia from its origins in Pu'er county, near Simao Prefecture in Yunnan.\n\nThe route earned the name Tea-Horse Road because of the common trade of Tibetan ponies for Chinese tea, a practice dating back at least to the Song dynasty, when the sturdy horses were important for China to fight warring nomads in the north.\n\nIn the 21st century, the legacy of the Tea-Horse Road has been used to promote a railway that will connect Chengdu to Lhasa. This planned railroad, part of the PRC's 13th 5-Year Plan, is called the Sichuan-Tibet railway (川藏铁路); it will connect cities across the route including Kangding. Authorities claim it will bring great benefit to the people's welfare.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1869769", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1869769", "title": "Blackout (wartime)", "text": "Blackout (wartime)\n\nA blackout during war, or in preparation for an expected war, is the practice of collectively minimizing outdoor light, including upwardly directed (or reflected) light. This was done in the 20th century to prevent crews of enemy aircraft from being able to identify their targets by sight, for example during the London Blitz of 1940. In coastal regions a shore-side blackout of city lights also helped protect ships from being seen in silhouette against the shore by enemy submarines farther out at sea.\n\nIn actual warfare, according to M. R. D. Foot, blackouts did not impair navigation by bombers because navigators focused more on reflective bodies of water, railroad tracks, or large highways—the chief purpose was to mobilize the entire civilian population, and provide a test to make sure they obeyed the rules.\n\nPlans to blackout British coastal towns in the event of war were drawn up in 1913 by Winston Churchill in his role as First Lord of the Admiralty; these plans were implemented on 12 August 1914, eight days after the United Kingdom had entered the war. On 1 October 1914, the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police ordered that bright exterior lights were to be extinguished or dimmed in the London area and street lamps be partially painted out with black paint. Elsewhere, the matter was left to local authorities. Following the start of the German strategic bombing campaign early in 1915, ordinary people in towns without blackouts sometimes took the law into their own hands, smashing street lamps which they thought might attract an air raid. Blackout restrictions were extended to the whole of England in February 1916.\n\nIn France, a blackout was implemented for Paris at the start of the Zeppelin campaign in the spring of 1915, but was later relaxed, only to be reintroduced in the spring of 1918 when the Germans began using heavy bombers against the city. In Germany, a blackout was only enforced in a zone 150 kilometres (93 miles) behind the Western Front.\n\nDuring World War II, the Air Ministry had forecast that Britain would suffer night air bombing attacks causing large numbers of civilian casualties and mass destruction. It was widely agreed that navigation and targeting would be more difficult if man-made lights on the ground could be extinguished. As early as July 1939, Public Information Leaflet No 2 (part of the Air Raid Precautions (A.R.P.) training literature) warned of the need for popular discipline to ensure that the blackout regulations were fully enforced during the blackout periods.\n\nBlackout regulations were imposed on 1 September 1939, before the declaration of war. These required that all windows and doors should be covered at night with suitable material such as heavy curtains, cardboard or paint, to prevent the escape of any glimmer of light that might aid enemy aircraft. The Government ensured that the necessary materials were available. External lights such as street lights were switched off, or dimmed and shielded to deflect light downward. Essential lights such as traffic lights and vehicle headlights were fitted with slotted covers to deflect their beams downwards to the ground.\n\nShops and factories had particular problems. Factories with large areas of glass roofing found it impossible to install temporary blackout panels and permanent methods (such as paint) lost natural light during daylight. Shops had to install double \"airlock\" doors to avoid lights showing as customers arrived and departed.\n\nBlackouts proved one of the more unpleasant aspects of the war, disrupting many civilian activities and causing widespread grumbling and lower morale.\n\nThe blackout was enforced by civilian ARP wardens who would ensure that no buildings allowed the slightest peek or glow of light. Offenders were liable to stringent legal penalties.\n\nBlackout restrictions greatly increased the dangers of night driving and fatalities increased as a consequence. As a result, some aspects were relaxed and speed limits were lowered. Unsurprisingly, fatalities were also recorded amongst merchant seaman falling into the docks at night and drowning during the blackout.\n\nCrime also increased under cover of darkness, from looting, theft, burglary, and robbery, to fraud, cons, and gang-related activities, to rape and murder, and even serial murder.\n\nAs German war-making capability declined, a \"Dim-out\" was introduced in September 1944, which allowed lighting to the equivalent of moonlight. A full Blackout would be imposed if an alert was sounded. Full lighting of streets was allowed in April 1945; on 30 April, the day Hitler committed suicide, Big Ben was lit 5 years and 123 days after the Blackout was first imposed.\nSince the attack on Pearl Harbor, the continental United States was exposed to air attacks while engaging in a war with Japan, such as the bombing of Dutch Harbor, the Lookout Air Raids, and the Fu-Go balloon bombs, but these were considered minor or negligible and did nothing to damage American morale and war effort. Along the Atlantic coast, the lack of a coastal blackout served to silhouette Allied shipping and thus expose them to German submarine attack. Coastal communities resisted the imposition of a blackout for amenity reasons, citing potential damage to tourism. The result was a disastrous loss of shipping, dubbed by German submariners as the \"Second Happy Time\". Blackouts were held in cities, and along the coastal areas long after any enemy threat existed; the primary purpose was psychological motivation of the civilian population which saw blackouts as a patriotic duty.\n\nLights can simply be turned off or light can sometimes be minimized by tarring the windows of large public structures. In World War II, a dark blackout curtain was used to keep the light inside. Tarring the windows can mean a semi-permanent blackout status.\n\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, cities such as Detroit would practise blackout air raid drills. During this time, the city's Civil Defense workers would immediately activate the neighborhood air raid siren and families would be required to do the following in order:\n\n\nThe benefits of blackouts against air attack are now largely nullified in the face of a technologically sophisticated enemy. As early as World War II, aircraft were using radio-beam navigation (see \"Battle of the Beams\"), and targets were detected by air-to-ground radar, (e.g. H2X). Today, not only are night-vision goggles readily available to air crews, but sophisticated satellite-based and inertial navigation systems enable a static target to be found easily by aircraft and guided missiles. Nevertheless, during the 1991 Gulf War, authorities in Baghdad practised blackouts along with other civil defence procedures, before the Gulf War air campaign began striking the city.\n"}

The two started performing in 1973 while taking a break from the four-man comedy act The Firesign Theatre, with the comedy album \"TV or Not TV\", on which they based a short film in 1978. They reunited the Firesign Theatre in 1974, but resumed their duo act in 1975 during a second temporary split of the Firesigns, and continued to perform as a duo during several breaks of the Firesign Theatre until Bergman's death in 2012.\n\nPeter Bergman and Philip Proctor met while attending Yale University in the late 1950s, where Proctor studied acting, and Bergman edited the Yale comedy magazine. Bergman studied playwriting and collaborated as lyricist with Austin Pendleton on two Yale Dramat musicals in which Proctor starred: \"Tom Jones\", and \"Booth Is Back In Town\".\n\nProctor was in Los Angeles in 1966, looking for acting work and watching the Sunset Strip curfew riots. When he discovered he was sitting on a newspaper photo of Bergman, he called his college buddy, who recruited him as the fourth man for the comedy group he formed, along with producers Phil Austin and David Ossman. Bergman christened the group the Firesign Theatre, as all four were born under the three astrological fire signs (Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius).\n\nIn 1972, the Firesign Theatre combined parts of a live stage show, the Shakespeare parody \"The Count of Monte Cristo\", with a live KPFK broadcast, \"Martian Space Party\", plus some new studio material to produce their sixth album \"Not Insane or Anything You Want To\". But before releasing the album in October 1972, they had discarded their original story line idea and some newly written scenes. The album performed poorly, and the Firesigns decided to take a break and perform in separate directions for a while. Proctor and Bergman decided to perform as a duo, and made a separate record deal with Columbia, producing \"TV or Not TV: A Video Vaudeville in Two Acts\". They turned this into a vaudeville-type show which they played on tour. While promoting the show, they did a radio interview with disk jockey Wolfman Jack.\n\nThe Firesign Theatre reunited in 1974 and produced three more comedy albums for Columbia. The ninth one, \"In the Next World, You're on Your Own\", was a black comedy which also sold poorly in 1975, and caused the Firesigns to lose their Columbia recording contract. They effectively split in half again, and Proctor and Bergman turned their attention to producing a live show and Columbia album, \"What This Country Needs\", based in part on material from \"TV or Not TV\".\n\nThey appeared as regulars on a 1977 summer replacement TV series hosted by the Starland Vocal Band. Proctor and Bergman gave up their road performances after witnessing the September 4, 1977 Golden Dragon Massacre, and in 1978 released another studio album \"Give Us a Break\", which lampooned radio and television. The Starland Vocal Band also performed short comic radio breaks on this album.\n\nIn 1979, Proctor and Bergman produced a film, \"J-Men Forever\", using clips from old Republic Pictures movie serials with dubbed dialogue, combined with new footage of them as FBI agents tracking down a villain known as \"the Lightning Bug\" voiced by disk jockey M. G. Kelly. This became popular on the 1980s late-night TV series \"Night Flight\".\n\nThe Firesign Theatre reunited again late in 1979, but the changing American social and political climate marked by the election of President Ronald Reagan caused a cooling-off of the Theatre's first wave of popularity. In the summer of 1990, NPR producer Ted Bonnitt called Proctor and asked him if he wanted to contribute some comedy material to Bonnitt's nightly program \"HEAT with John Hockenberry\". Proctor called Bergman, and the duo agreed to write and perform a serial consisting of 13 five-minute episodes, \"\"\n\nIn 1993, the Firesign Theatre reunited for a ten-city cross-country reunion tour, and experienced a second wave of popularity. They produced five albums of new material and continued to perform live, until Bergman's death on March 9, 2012, from complications involving leukemia.\n\nThe two Midwestern members of the group performed as a double act for a while in the mid-1970s and recorded a few albums, though all four members continued to perform and record together.\n\nIn 1977, they were regulars on a summer replacement television series on CBS hosted by the Starland Vocal Band.\n\nAfter the series, at the peak of their career as a duo, the performers and their entourage were eating a post show meal when they were ancillary to the Golden Dragon massacre. When Army veteran Bergman realized the perpetrators had emptied their weapons, he rose in time to see their faces as they exited, later testifying in their conviction. While only one person in their party was wounded in the massacre, it took the air out of their will to continue on the road.\n\nThe screenplay for the 1979 movie \"Americathon\" was an adaptation by others of a play written by Proctor and Bergman.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was released in Japan on October 15, 1996, by Sony Music Entertainment Japan. Thematically the album expounded on the issue of complacency and ignorance in popular culture and the discrimination of minorities, gays, and women. Songs like \"Love to Hate\" and \"You Don't Know\" address the entertainment industry and media and their corruption. \"Ballad of Cleo and Joe\" is a song about the double life of a cross dresser. \"Say a Prayer\" is about the AIDS epidemic.\n\nThe record takes a deviation from previous projects, incorporating a blend of electronica production with a variety of traditional instruments such as the guitar, zither, Appalachian dulcimer, and slide dulcimer, as well as an omnichord. There is a permeating pagan theme highlighted by the track \"Mother,\" an ode to Gaea. Speaking to \"Billboard\" in 1997, Lauper commented: \"To me, this album is a natural progression from the songs on \"Hat Full of Stars\". I've never been more proud of a group of songs.\" Many of the album's tracks were written by Lauper and Jan Pulsford, who had joined Lauper's band as keyboardist for the tour promoting \"Hat Full of Stars\" (1993). Lauper told \"Billboard\": \"We were on a special journey that felt so right. Jan and I are extremely compatible collaborators\".\n\nThe album was released in 1996 in Japan and in 1997 in other parts of the world. The Japanese version features a bonus track, \"Early Christmas Morning\". The track \"Lollygagging\" is a hidden track which is nothing more than Lauper and her musicians attempting to record the song \"Hot Gets a Little Cold\" but making a musical mistake and laughing about it.\n\nThe album was heavily praised by multiple music critics due to Lauper's creative growth and eclectic themes. However, due to ongoing friction between Lauper and her record label, the album's release was delayed and due to low promotion sold only 56,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Since its release, the album has been met with continued praise including the Songwriters' Hall of Fame noting the title track as one of Lauper's key songs in her catalog.\n\nThe title of the album is a reference to the book \"The Mists of Avalon\" by Marion Zimmer Bradley, which tells the legend of King Arthur from the point view of the female characters.\n\nUpon release, Larry Flick of \"Billboard\" wrote: \"The album plays to Lauper's considerable strengths as a vocalist and her marked maturity as a songwriter, with broad stylistic leanings.\" David Grad of \"Entertainment Weekly\" noted: \"Lauper remains an intoxicating pop siren. Her sixth album is a wonderfully eclectic affair.\"\n\nStephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described the album as \"varied and eclectic\", adding: \"While the results aren't always successful, the record is the most intriguing and rewarding album she made since \"True Colors\".\" \"People\" noted the album's variety and \"cutting commentary\", but felt \"for all her bold experimentation, Lauper seems to be trying too hard\".\n\nDue to lack of promotion, the album performed poorly in most markets. In the United States the album debuted at 188 on the chart dated April 19, 1997. It stayed on the chart for one week and has sold 56,000 copies to date.\n\nIn the UK, the album was released earlier in February 1997 and entered the chart at 59 before leaving the chart the following week. The album entered the Austrian Albums chart at its peak of 45, staying on the chart for 3 weeks. It was her first studio album to chart there since \"True Colors\".\n\nThe album was however more successful in Japan where it peaked at 15, spending 9 weeks on the chart and was eventually certified Gold for shipment of 100,000 copies.\n\nAll songs written by Cyndi Lauper and Jan Pulsford unless otherwise noted.\n\n"}

Primarily a center fielder, he appeared in 1,270 games played in Major League Baseball over 11 seasons for the Detroit Tigers (1952; –1957), Kansas City Athletics (1958–1961) and Minnesota Twins (1961–1963). Tuttle also played 85 games as a third baseman during 1961 for the Twins: they were the only MLB games he ever played at the \"hot corner.\" He threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed .\n\nTuttle was born and grew up in Cramer, a small farming community located south of Elmwood, Illinois, and three miles southeast of Farmington, where his parents operated a general store. After attending Bradley University in Peoria, Illinois, he played in his first major league game on September 10, 1952. \n\nIn his 11-year career, Tuttle had a .259 batting average, with 149 doubles, 47 triples, 67 home runs and 443 RBIs. He had 1,105 career hits. His finest offensive seasons came in and . In the former year, he reached career highs in runs scored (102), home runs (14) and runs batted in (78). In the latter season, Tuttle batted .300 for the only time in his MLB tenure, collecting 139 hits in 126 games. Throughout his career, he was considered one of the most reliable defensive players in the game, leading all American League outfielders in putouts in 1955 and 1960 and assists in 1959 and 1960. He also led center fielders in assists in 1955, and 1958.\n\nOn practically every baseball card issued for Tuttle, a large bulge of chewing tobacco is evident in his cheek. Tuttle died in Anoka, Minnesota, at the age of 69, and oral cancer was in all likelihood the cause of his death. Tuttle was diagnosed with oral cancer five years before his death, and used the last half-decade of his life to raise awareness as an active volunteer for the National Spit Tobacco Education Program (NSTEP). of Oral Health America.\nDuring the last years of his life, Tuttle was facially disfigured due to extensive surgery for oral cancer. He traveled widely as a public speaker, warning major league players of the dangers of chewing tobacco. \"It's going to be pretty hard to tell someone making $4 million a year not to chew\", he admitted. \"So what we're trying to do is get it off TV.\" \n\nAfter being diagnosed with oral cancer, he was interviewed for a \"Reader's Digest\" article entitled \"My War With A Smoke Free Killer\" in which he detailed how he was introduced to chewing tobacco by a teammate while sidelined with an injury and subsequently became addicted. The article showed pictures of a disfigured Tuttle after his many facial surgeries.\n\n"}

It also offers delivery (from some stores), take-out and private dining. Bertucci's was founded by Joey Crugnale in Davis Square, Somerville, Massachusetts, in 1981. The company expanded rapidly during the 1990s. Bertucci's locations are primarily found in the Northeast, but range as far south as Virginia. N.E. Restaurant Co. Inc. bought out Bertucci's in 1998, adopting the Bertucci's Co. name in 2001.\n\nJoseph (\"Joey\") Crugnale, Bertucci's founder, was born in Sulmona, Italy. He landed his first job in a restaurant while in high school, after emigrating to Boston. He worked as a porter at the Sonesta Hotel in Cambridge. In 1974 he opened his first ice cream stand. In 1975, he refinanced his father's home and purchased Steve's Ice Cream from founder Steve Herrell for $80,000. Crugnale established 26 stores before selling the concept to Integrated Resources in 1983 for $4.5 million.\n\nThe first 'Bertucci's Pizza and Bocce' was opened in 1981, two doors from Steve's Ice Cream in Davis Square. Bertucci's was opened to eliminate the possibility of an ice cream competitor moving in. The name was found in a magazine during a flight to New York City. The original location had a bocce court in the basement, as did the second location, in Brookline.\n\nTwo more Massachusetts restaurants opened in 1985, in Cambridge and Holliston, MA. They featured open-hearth brick oven specialty pizzas topped with ingredients such as artichoke hearts and roasted eggplant. No two Bertucci's were alike to avoid marketing as a chain. The Brookline restaurant contained an outdoor bocce court. It planned to operate 20 restaurants by 1990. The Brookline restaurant closed in September 2009.\n\nWhile the company grew it spent less than 1 percent of revenues on advertising, relying on word of mouth. \"USA Today\" listed Bertucci's as one of America's top 10 pizza restaurants in 1989; by then, its headquarters were in Woburn.\n\nIn the 1990s Bertucci's menu added soups, salads, and pasta dishes before expanding into Rhode Island and New Hampshire.\n\nBertucci's became a publicly owned company in July 1991. The company offered 21 units for $13 per share. That year sales increased 30 percent to $37.4 million and net income increased by 90 percent to $3 million. Stock prices nearly doubled, selling for $24.75 per share.\n\nIn 1992 delivery and take-out services were added; Bertucci's grew from 26 to 36 stores. In 1994, it expanded to Atlanta, Georgia; Chicago; Orlando, Florida; and New Jersey. Bertucci's had 63 stores by 1995.\n\nA $10.4 million wrongful death lawsuit against Bertucci's was filed in July 1995. Janet Walker, of Salem, New Hampshire, went into anaphylactic shock and then slipped into a coma after ingesting pesto sauce that contained nuts. The waitress, according to the lawsuit, failed to mention the nuts. A week later, Walker died. The case never went to trial.\n\nJoey Crugnale attempted to take the chain private again in 1998, but though the board approved his attempt, he was outbid. N.E. Restaurant Co. Inc. purchased Bertucci's for $10.50 a share during the buyout.\n\nCrugnale has moved on to own two individual restaurants, Naked Fish in Waltham, Massachusetts, and Red Sauce (now closed).\n\nIn 2001, N.E. Restaurant Co. Inc. sold its Chili's and On the Border restaurants to Brinker International, and changed its name to Bertucci's Corp. A $4 million advertising tagline \"Everybody Eats\" was developed in April 2002.\nIn 2006, Italian chain Vinny T's rebranded as Buca di Beppo and withdrew from some markets. As part of their consolidation, they sold 11 Boston locations to Bertucci's Corp.\n\nIn 2011, \"The Boston Globe\" did a DNA investigation of fish available in area restaurants and supermarkets and determined that 50% of the fish was not properly labelled as to species. Bertucci's was asked for comment, and acted swiftly to correct the issue – an article on their search to find an acceptable serving of cod to replace the hake that their supplier had sourced them with appeared at the same time as the report on the investigation.\n\nOn December 3, 2012, Bertucci's opened its first 2Ovens concept restaurant in the re-vamped White City shopping center in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts. The brick ovens are the only method of cooking in the restaurant.\n\nOn April 15, 2018, Bertucci's filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The chain is expected to close about half of their locations and the plans are to hold an auction for the remainder of the company. The opening bid would be for $19.7 million and if no higher bid come is made, an affiliate of Right Lane Capital has agreed to purchase the chain. The company owes approximately $9 million to their suppliers and $110 million to financial lenders.\n\nIn June 2018, the Bertucci's chain agreed to be acquired by the corporate parent of Planet Hollywood, Earl Enterprises, for $20 million. Earl Enterprises currently owns 58 Bertucci's locations.\n\nBertucci's began by specializing primarily in brick oven pizzas. In the 1990s, Bertucci's expanded its menu to include a wider selection of pasta, panini and foccacia sandwiches, and various grilled dishes.\n\n\n"}

The show has since been syndicated by DiC to affiliates of smaller television networks such as The CW and MyNetworkTV and some independent stations so that those stations can fulfill FCC educational and informational requirements. Since September 16, 2006, the series aired on CBS's new block called \"KOL Secret Slumber Party on CBS\", then it was aired on \"KEWLopolis\", named after Mike Bundlie's KEWL Magazine. In 2008, it ran on History. The series aired on Cookie Jar Toons on This TV and on CBS's Cookie Jar TV block from 2009 to 2013.

{"id": "1869857", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1869857", "title": "Accessory pigment", "text": "Accessory pigment\n\nAccessory pigments are light-absorbing compounds, found in photosynthetic organisms, that work in conjunction with chlorophyll \"a\". They include other forms of this pigment, such as chlorophyll \"b\" in green algal and higher plant antennae, while other algae may contain chlorophyll \"c\" or \"d\". In addition, there are many non-chlorophyll accessory pigments, such as carotenoids or phycobiliproteins, which also absorb light and transfer that light energy to photosystem chlorophyll. Some of these accessory pigments, in particular the carotenoids, also serve to absorb and dissipate excess light energy, or work as antioxidants. The large, physically associated group of chlorophylls and other accessory pigments is sometimes referred to as a \"pigment bed\".\n\nThe different chlorophyll and non-chlorophyll pigments associated with the photosystems all have different absorption spectra, either because the spectra of the different chlorophyll pigments are modified by their local protein environment or because the accessory pigments have intrinsic structural differences. The result is that, in vivo, a composite absorption spectrum of all these pigments is broadened and flattened such that a wider range of visible and infrared radiation is absorbed by plants and algae. Most photosynthetic organisms do not absorb green light well, thus most remaining light under leaf canopies in forests or under water with abundant plankton is green, a spectral effect called the \"green window\". Organisms such as some cyanobacteria and red algae contain accessory phycobiliproteins that absorb green light reaching these habitats.\n\nIn aquatic ecosystems, it is likely that the absorption spectrum of water, along with gilvin and tripton (dissolved and particulate organic matter, respectively), determines phototrophic niche differentiation. The six shoulders in the light absorption of water between wavelengths 400 and 1100 nm correspond to troughs in the collective absorption of at least twenty diverse species of phototrophic bacteria. Another effect is due to the overall trend for water to absorb low frequencies, while gilvin and tripton absorb higher ones. This is why open ocean appears blue and supports yellow species such as \"Prochlorococcus\", which contains divinyl-chlorophyll \"a\" and \"b\". \"Synechococcus\", colored red with phycoerythrin, is adapted to coastal bodies, while phycocyanin allows Cyanobacteria to thrive in darker inland waters.\n\n"}

Initially a jazz bassist (Last won the award for \"best bassist\" in Germany in each of the years 1950–1952), his trademark \"happy music\" made his numerous albums best-sellers in Germany and the United Kingdom, with 65 of his albums reaching the charts in the UK alone. His composition \"Happy Heart\" became an international success in interpretations by Andy Williams and Petula Clark.\n\nLast is reported to have sold an estimated 200 million albums worldwide in his lifetime (figures vary widely, for example \"British Hit Singles & Albums\" (2006) reports 100 million at that time), of which 80 million were sold by 1973 - and won numerous awards including 200 gold and 14 platinum discs in Germany, the International MIDEM Prize at MIDEM in 1969, and West Germany's highest civilian award, the Bundesverdienstkreuz (Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany) in 1978. His album \"This Is James Last\" remained a UK best-seller for 48 weeks, and his song \"Games That Lovers Play\" has been covered over a hundred times. Last undertook his final tour months before his death at age 86, upon discovering in September 2014 that an illness (the exact illness was never disclosed) had worsened. His final UK performance was his 90th at London's Royal Albert Hall, more than any other performer except Eric Clapton.\n\nLast's trademark sound employed big band arrangements of well-known tunes with a jaunty dance beat, often heavy on bass and brass. Despite at times being derided by critics and purists as the \"king of elevator music\" or \"acoustic porridge\", his style and music were popular in numerous countries and cultures, including Japan, the former Soviet Union, the USA and UK, and his native Germany, where it became \"the archetypal soundtrack of any German cellar bar party\", and made him the \"most commercially successful bandleader\" of the second half of the 20th century. Last's composition Jagerlatein is also widely celebrated in Ireland as \"The Sound of Summer\" due to use as the theme tune to \"The Sunday Game\", a live sporting show which follows GAA hurling and Gaelic football All Ireland Championships since 1979.\n\nLast was born to Louis and Martha Last in Bremen, Germany. He was the younger brother of Robert Last and Werner Last (aka Kai Warner). His father was an official at the postal and public works department of the city of Bremen and Last grew up in the suburb of Sebaldsbrück. He began studying the piano at age 10, though he could play simple tunes such as the folk song \"Hänschen klein\" when he was 9. His first music teacher felt he lacked any musical talent. Last started playing more actively with his second tutor and switched to the double bass as a teenager. His home city of Bremen was bombed heavily during World War II, and he ran messages to air defence command posts during the raids. He entered the Bückeburg Military Music School of the German Wehrmacht at the age of 14 and learned to play bass, piano and tuba.\n\nAfter the end of the war, he joined 's Radio Bremen Dance Orchestra. In 1948 he became the leader of the Last-Becker Ensemble, which performed for seven years. He was voted as the best bassist in the country in a German jazz poll for 1950, 1951 and 1952. When the Last-Becker Ensemble disbanded, he became the in-house arranger for Polydor Records, as well as a number of European radio stations. During the next decade he helped arrange hits for artists such as Helmut Zacharias, Freddy Quinn, Lolita, Alfred Hause and Caterina Valente.\n\nLast first released albums in the U.S. under the titles \"The American Patrol\" on Warner Bros. Records around 1964. He also released a series of nine albums in a series called \"Classics Up To Date\" which served up arrangements of classical melodies with strings, rhythm and wordless chorus from the mid-1960s until the early 1980s. Last's 1965 album, \"Non Stop Dancing,\" was a recording of brief renditions of popular songs, all tied together by an insistent dance beat and crowd noises. It was a hit and helped make him a major European star. Over the next four decades, Last released over 190 records, including several more volumes of \"Non Stop Dancing\". On these records, he varied his formula by adding different songs from different countries and genres, as well as guest performers like Richard Clayderman and Astrud Gilberto.\n\nHe also had his own successful television series throughout the 1970s with guests including ABBA and Lynsey de Paul which was screened across Europe. Last's trademark sound employed big band arrangements of well-known tunes with a jaunty dance beat, often heavy on bass and brass.\n\nThough his concerts and albums were consistently successful, especially in the UK, where he had 52 hit albums between 1967 and 1986, which made him second only to Elvis Presley in charting records, he had relatively few hit singles. In the UK, his only chart singles were \"The Seduction\", a cover version of the theme from \"American Gigolo\" (1980) composed by Giorgio Moroder, and \"Biscaya\" from the album \"Biscaya\". His single \"Mornings at Seven\" became a familiar tune in Britain after the BBC used it as the theme music for an ice skating program. It was released on 7\" vinyl in 1968 and has been included on \"By Request\" and \"Eighty Not Out\".\n\nIn the US, where \"The Seduction\" became a Top 40 hit, peaking at No. 28 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and No. 22 on the Adult Contemporary chart in May 1980. Last was somewhat more successful on the singles charts. In 2003, his song \"Einsamer Hirte\" (The Lonely Shepherd) which features the pan flute of Gheorghe Zamfir appeared on the soundtrack of the Quentin Tarantino movie \"Kill Bill Volume 1\".\n\nHe won numerous popular and professional awards, including \"Billboard\" magazine's Star of the Year trophy in 1976, and was honoured for lifetime achievement with the German ECHO prize in 1994.

Angels Baseball LP is a lawsuit filed in Orange County, California Superior Court by the city of Anaheim, California against the owners of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Major League Baseball franchise, concerning the team's official name. The lawsuit and a related political and public relations battle sought to reverse the team's official name change from \"Anaheim Angels\" to \"Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim\", which the city characterized as a breach of the team's lease on the city-owned Angel Stadium of Anaheim. The city was unsuccessful, as both a trial jury and an appellate court ruled in the team's favor.\n\nThe Angels franchise was founded as the \"Los Angeles Angels\" in 1961 and played under that name until 1965, when it changed its name to \"California Angels\" upon its move from Los Angeles' Dodger Stadium to the new Anaheim Stadium (now Angel Stadium of Anaheim). In 1996, the Angels and the city of Anaheim agreed on a new lease that called for the city to fund renovations to Anaheim Stadium, and called for the team's name to contain the name \"Anaheim\". The following year, the team's official name changed again to \"Anaheim Angels\".\n\nIn 2003, the team was sold to Arturo \"Arte\" Moreno. Less than two years later, the team announced it was changing its name to \"Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim\", an attempt to market the team as being from Southern California—Major League Baseball's second-largest media market—rather than just Orange County. The \"of Anaheim\" phrase was included to comply with the terms of the 1996 lease. Anaheim city officials immediately denounced the change, characterizing it as a breach of the lease. Likewise, many fans denounced the change, as many Orange County residents consider Orange County to have its own identity separate from Los Angeles.\n\nA preliminary injunction filed by the city seeking to immediately reverse the name change was unsuccessful, and the Angels began playing under the new name for the 2007 season.\n\nThe present-day Angels franchise began play as the \"Los Angeles Angels\" in . Owned by actor Gene Autry and his wife Jackie, they played their inaugural season at Wrigley Field in South Los Angeles (not to be confused with the Chicago stadium of the same name). They moved to Dodger Stadium the following season, becoming tenants of the National League's Los Angeles Dodgers for four seasons. During the season, Gene Autry struck a deal with the suburban city of Anaheim on a new stadium for the Angels. The team changed its name to \"California Angels\" late in the season, as they were the only American League team in the state at the time, and moved to the city-owned Anaheim Stadium in . They would play under this moniker for over 30 seasons.\n\nIn The Walt Disney Company acquired a 25% interest in the Angels from the Autrys. The following year, the team changed its name to \"Anaheim Angels\", the result of an agreement between the city and the team to refurbish and downsize Anaheim Stadium after the 1994 departure of the NFL's Los Angeles Rams to St. Louis. One clause of the new lease required that the team name \"contain\" the name \"Anaheim\". There was precedent for the name \"Anaheim\" in a major professional sports team name, as the NHL's Mighty Ducks of Anaheim (now known as the Anaheim Ducks), also owned by Disney, were enfranchised in 1993. Disney acquired the remaining share of the team in , less than a year after Gene Autry's death.\n\nEarly in the season, Disney sold the team to Arturo \"Arte\" Moreno, a fourth-generation Mexican American billboard magnate from Arizona. Though he vowed to keep the team in Anaheim, starting in the 2004 season, all references to Anaheim began disappearing from the Angels players' uniforms, officially licensed merchandise, web site, ticket media, and promotional materials, and were replaced with \"Angels\", \"Angels Baseball\", or the Angels' wordmark or halo insignia.\n\nOn January 3, 2005 the Angels announced that the club's official name was being changed to \"Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim\".\n\nIn its official announcement, team spokesmen pointed out the Angels had been originally created as the American League's representative of the Greater Los Angeles area, which comprises the counties of Los Angeles, Ventura, Riverside, and San Bernardino, in addition to Orange County.\n\nNew owner Moreno believed the new name would help him market the team to the entire Southern California region rather than just Orange County, thereby tapping into Major League Baseball's second largest media market. The \"of Anaheim\" phrase was included in the official name to comply with a provision of the team's lease at Angel Stadium which requires that the team's name \"include the name Anaheim therein\", although it was correctly anticipated that the team would be referred to as simply the \"Los Angeles Angels\" by the media and the majority of the public.\n\nAt the same time they announced the name change, the Angels aggressively marketed themselves to Los Angeles, buying space on nearly 500 billboards in the area that read simply \"City of ANGELS\" in the team's wordmark. The Dodgers, not wanting to give up any of its market share to the Angels, countered with their own billboard campaign, featuring the slogan \"LA Baseball\" (with \"LA\" depicted in the team's insignia), and putting \"Los Angeles Dodgers of Los Angeles\" on special giveaway merchandise for Opening Day 2005.\n\nThe name change upset some fans from Orange County who did not wish to be associated with Los Angeles. It has been claimed that a cultural divide (the \"Orange Curtain\") exists between Orange County and Los Angeles. Some fans suggested that Moreno, an Arizona native, did not take into account the alleged animosity between residents of the two counties when he attempted to restore the team's original name. Some fans wished for either the name to stay the same, or even for an alternate rename to the \"Orange County Angels.\" Some fans made and sold unlicensed merchandise with messages such as \"We are not LA\" and \"Anaheim Angels of Anaheim\" .\n\nAnaheim Mayor Curt Pringle and other city officials asserted that the name change violated the spirit of the lease clause, even if it was in technical compliance. They argued that a name change was a major bargaining chip in negotiations between the city and Disney, and that the wording of the clause was merely to allow Disney some \"wiggle room\" in selecting the team name (Disney chairman Michael Eisner reportedly considered naming the team the \"Mighty Angels of Anaheim\"). They further argued that the city would never have agreed to the new lease without the name change, because the new lease required that the city partially fund the stadium's renovation while reducing annual revenue for the city. Anaheim sued Angels Baseball L.P. in Orange County Superior Court, seeking monetary damages and a restoration of the \"Anaheim Angels\" name. Concurrently, city politicians boycotted the city's luxury suite at Angel Stadium, including during the Angels' 2005 playoff run, opting instead to donate game tickets in the suite to various charities. A trial, initially set for November 7, 2005 was postponed until January 9, 2006.\n\nIn addition to the lawsuit brought by the city of Anaheim, the mayors of every Orange County city, as well as the mayor of Los Angeles, signed a petition opposing the name change, while the city councils of Anaheim, Irvine, and Los Angeles adopted formal resolutions opposing the name change. The Los Angeles resolution specifically stated that the city only recognizes professional sports teams bearing the name \"Los Angeles\" as those whose home facilities are within the Los Angeles city limits, including the National League's Dodgers, the NBA's Lakers and Clippers, the WNBA's Sparks, the NHL's Kings, and the Arena Football League's Avengers. Disney and the city of Los Angeles filed \"amicus curiae\" papers in Orange County Superior Court supporting Anaheim's position in its lawsuit against the team.\n\nThe city also sought a preliminary injunction to immediately reverse the name change in advance of the trial, which was rejected by the superior court judge. The city appealed the judge's ruling to the Court of Appeal, Fourth District, which granted an unusual writ moving the city's case to the top of the docket and held a hearing on March 28, 2005. Though a ruling had been anticipated by April 7, 2005 the three judges of the appellate court merely urged the city and the team to work towards a settlement prior to trial. The appellate court ruled against Anaheim's request for an injunction on June 27, 2005.\n\nThe case proceeded to jury trial on January 9, 2006, and on February 9, 2006, the jury found in favor of the team, determining that the \"Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim\" name was in compliance with the lease, and thus denying the city any monetary compensation. Both citing the jury verdict finding the team in compliance and noting that his own conclusion agreed with that judgment, on March 2, 2006, the judge in the case formally denied the city's request to force the team to restore the \"Anaheim Angels\" name.\n\nOn February 26, 2007, the city of Anaheim appealed the jury's decision, citing some testimony that it wanted to present but was not heard in the jury trial, and sought to recoup an estimated US$7 million in court costs. On December 20, 2008, a state appellate court issued a split decision denying the city's appeal and refusing to either set aside the jury's verdict or order the team to pay for the city's court costs. On January 13, 2009, Anaheim's city council voted not to further appeal the court's decisions, bringing a conclusion to the legal battle.\n\nDespite the legal victory, the team only uses its full name on official press releases and its website, and continues to market itself without direct reference to location wherever possible. Neither \"Los Angeles\" nor \"Anaheim\" appears on the team's uniforms or officially licensed merchandise or promotional materials; \"Angels\" or \"Angels Baseball\" are used instead. Major League Baseball and the national media have recognized the name change from the beginning, and team ownership correctly predicted that the national media and the general public would drop \"of Anaheim\" out of convenience and refer to the team as simply the \"Los Angeles Angels.\" And, prior to the 2016 season, the Angels officially dropped “of Anaheim” from their name. \n\nDespite the prolonged legal battle, organized fan resistance to the new name subsided long before the appellate court ruling.\n\nThe name controversy and the city's suit and boycott did little to quell fan enthusiasm for the team, as Angel Stadium consistently drew over 3.3 million fans through its gates each season from 2004 to 2008. It also had little to no impact on the team's on-field performance—they won four American League West division titles over the same timespan, marking the most successful era in franchise history. The controversy also did little to negatively impact the perception of team ownership around the league, as evidenced by the Angels being selected to host the 2010 All-Star Game, with MLB Commissioner Bud Selig calling the Angels a \"model franchise.\"\n\nIn 2007, the Angels' name change was the inspiration for the independent minor league Long Beach Armada baseball team's tongue-in-cheek name change to the \"Long Beach Armada of Los Angeles of California of the United States of North America Including Barrow, Alaska\".\n\nOn February 22, 2005, California state assemblyman Tom Umberg introduced a truth in advertising bill (AB 1041) in the State Assembly. If signed into law, the \"Truth in Sports Advertising Act\" would have required the Angels to disclose on all tickets and promotional materials that the team's home is Anaheim, not Los Angeles, unless Anaheim or Orange County exempted the franchise from the requirement. On May 16, 2005, the bill passed the California Assembly by a margin of 52–17 and was sent to the California State Senate where, on May 26, 2005, it was referred to the Business, Professions and Economic Development Committee.\n\nState Senate hearings scheduled on June 7 and June 27, 2005 were cancelled at the request of Assemblyman Umberg. On July 11, 2005, the hearing was postponed indefinitely by the Senate committee, effectively killing the bill.\n\n\n"}

Formed in 1999, they released two EPs and two full length albums before disbanding in 2008. Hoeffleur described their music as \"\"influenced by old-school punk (Wire, Minutemen, Misfits) and old-school country (Hank, Lefty, Patsy, Johnny) with a dash of singer/songwriter (Leonard Cohen, Nick Drake)\"\".\n\nThe Beauty Shop was formed by John Hoeffleur and drummer Casey Smith in 1999, in Champaign, Illinois. Hoeffleur (b. Arlington Heights, Illinois, 26 November 1977) grew up in the suburbs of Chicago, and graduated from the University of Illinois. He had previously played with local band The Blackouts, and on his own playing in local coffee shops.\n\nThe duo’s first release was \"The Grief EP\", a self-released limited edition recorded in Smith's home, which they sold at local concerts. The EP caught the eye of the Urbana, Illinois-based record label Parasol Records, who signed the band to produce an album. At the same time, the band put out hand-written ads for a bassist, and recruited Ariane Peralta. The band released their first album \"Yr. Money or Yr. Life\" in October 2000. The album garnered many positive critical reviews, and the band attracted a growing audience at its live performances, boosted when they opened at the last minute for The Violent Femmes in Champaign. According to one reviewer, \"\"the unsettling cover art reflected the bleakness of Hoeffleur's lyrical vision … spinning tales of dysfunctional characters drawn into seemingly terminal decline.\"\"\n\nIn August 2001, Smith left the band, and Hoeffleur played several solo shows before he and Peralta recruited drummer Joe Martin in early 2002. By that time, the album had been licensed to Shoeshine Records in Scotland, who released it in the UK. Shoeshine also released a limited-edition 7\" single of \"Death March\", the single from \"Yr. Money or Yr. Life\". The band toured across the UK in July 2002 to promote the album's release, again gaining critical acclaim. However, they then took a second hiatus after Martin left, with Hoeffleur playing solo shows in the UK, and Peralta concentrating on school.\n\nThe Beauty Shop reformed in 2004 to record a second album, \"Crisis Helpline\", with drummer Steve Lamos. In July 2004 they returned to live performance in the USA, with drummer Brett Sanderson, of The Blackouts. \"Crisis Helpline\" was released in Europe in September 2004, the record company concentrating on seeking to break the band there first. They also released a 7\" and CD single, \"Monster\", which enjoyed considerable airplay on BBC 6 in the UK. A second single, \"Rumplestiltskin Lives\", was released to UK radio stations in spring 2005.\n\nThe band then signed to Bryan Morrisson’s label, Snapper Records, in summer 2005. The label released two further singles in the UK, \"Paper Hearts for Josie\" (August 2005) and \"A Desperate Cry for Help\" (October 2005). New drummer Ben Ucherek replaced Sanderson for the filming of the video for \"A Desperate Cry for Help\". In April 2006, they released a hybrid album of the best tracks from their previous releases, \"Yard Sale\".\n\nTheir song \"I Got Issues\" was listed in Maxim magazine as \"\"the #4 Song to download if you're missing Johnny Cash\"\". They often include cover songs as B-sides. Their single release \"Monster\" includes a cover of the Misfits' \"Hybrid Moments\", \"Paper Hearts for Josie\" included The Pixies' \"Gouge Away\", \"A Desperate Cry Help\" contained Judas Priest's \"Breaking the Law\", and \"Death March\" featured a cover of Depeche Mode's \"Personal Jesus\". The band often played at The Great Cover-up, an annual Champaign-Urbana based charity show.\n\nBassist Ariane Peralta left in late 2006 to pursue a Ph.D. at university. She was replaced by Eric Fisher, formerly of the band Lorenzo Goetz.\n\nIn October 2007, the band released a new EP, \"Just Some Demos\", on their own label. The Beauty Shop disbanded in the summer of 2008 with the departure of Eric Fisher to Oregon and Ben Ucherek focusing his time on his new band Golden Quality. The band played its final show on June 6, 2008 at the Canopy Club in Urbana, Illinois. In late 2008, after the group disbanded, a new song entitled \"NuFuture\" was released on their MySpace page. The band's final demos were given a digital-only release as \"Just Some More Demos\" in January 2009.\n\nIn mid-2009, Hoeffleur formed a new band, Heyokas, with Kelly McMorris (keyboards), Marc Turner (bass), and Jesse Greenlee (drums).\n\nWith a line-up of Hoeffleur, Peralta and Ucherek, the Beauty Shop reformed for a one-off show in Champaign-Urbana in January 2016.\n\n\n\n"}

He said after the game he could miss the rest of the year, and was placed on the Injured Reserve list two days later.\n\nOn October 24, 2011 in a game of Monday Night Football, Ayanbadejo was ejected from the game for striking Jacksonville Jaguars offensive lineman Guy Whimper in the face.\n\nIn 2013, Ayanbadejo helped the Ravens sweep Indianapolis and Denver in the playoffs, and move on to defeat the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship game. That particular victory was especially sweet for Baltimore and Ravens fans everywhere because it finally healed the wound of their devastating \"wide-left\" loss to New England in the 2012 AFC Championship game. The Ravens' \"season of Destiny\" culminated in New Orleans on February 3, 2013, when they defeated the San Francisco 49ers 34-31 in Super Bowl XLVII, becoming two-time Super Bowl champions. He never started a single game for the Ravens during the 2012 season, spending most of his time on special teams.\n\nAyanbadejo was released by the Ravens on April 3, 2013.\n\nIn August 2013 Ayanbadejo was hired by Fox Sports as an analyst for \"Fox Football Daily\" on Fox Sports 1. He also serves as an occasional game analyst on \"NFL on Fox\" coverage.\n\nIn 2009, Ayanbedejo began advocating for the legalization of same-sex marriage. His advocacy rather suddenly became a cause célèbre in September 2012, after Maryland State Delegate Emmett C. Burns Jr. wrote an August 29, 2012, letter to Baltimore Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti, on official Maryland State letterhead, demanding that Bisciotti \"take the necessary action ... to inhibit such expressions from your employee.\" Burns' letter went on to state that, \"I know of no other NFL player who has done what Mr. Ayanbadejo is doing.\" Burns' letter was widely criticized as an effort to infringe on Ayanbadejo's right to free speech. According to \"The Washington Post\", the Ravens acknowledged receiving the letter but had no further comment.\nShortly after the Burns letter was delivered, Ayanbedejo publicly announced that, as the son of interracial parents whose own marriage would have been illegal in 16 states prior to the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark \"Loving v. Virginia\" decision in 1967, he had no intention of remaining silent on an issue of conscience and public importance. Ayanbadejo has since said that he has received widespread support in the world of football.\nAmong others, Minnesota Vikings punter Chris Kluwe wrote a scathing response to Burns, while the Ravens also publicly sided with Ayanbadejo. In February 2013, Ayanbadejo and Kluwe filed a joint amicus brief with the Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage, particularly in the case dealing with California Proposition 8.\n\nHe is the younger brother of free agent fullback Obafemi Ayanbadejo. The two were teammates on the Miami Dolphins in 2003. They were on the same team again in 2007, this time the Chicago Bears. Obafemi Ayanbadejo was cut by the Chicago Bears on October 1, 2007, after the fullback finished serving his four-game suspension for violating the NFL Policy on Anabolic Steroids and Related Substances.\n\nAyanbadejo wrote for the \"Santa Cruz Sentinel\" his first several years in the NFL. He has advocated for the passage of the FIT Kids Act, federal legislation that would require school districts to report on students' physical activity and to give youngsters health and nutritional information.\n\nAyenbadejo received his Executive MBA from The George Washington University in 2013.\n\nHe is married. His daughter, Anaya Lee Ayanbadejo, was born in August 2005; and his son, Amadeus Prime Ayanbadejo, was born in April 2011.\n\n\n"}

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 2004 to 2010 and again from 2012 to 2013 for the Arizona Diamondbacks, Chicago Cubs, Florida Marlins, and Washington Nationals. He also played for the Hiroshima Toyo Carp of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB).\n\nTracy compiled a .339 batting average during his career at East Carolina University. In 2000, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Orleans Cardinals of the Cape Cod Baseball League. He was selected by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the seventh round of the 2001 Major League Baseball draft.\n\nHe played third base in El Paso, Texas, for the El Paso Diablos. In four minor league seasons, Tracy hit .335 with 24 home runs, 85 doubles, and 206 RBIs in 337 games. In , he was selected to participate in the Futures Game during the All-Star break as the starting third baseman on the U.S. squad.\n\nTracy made his major league debut with Arizona in . He finished his rookie season with a .285 average, eight home runs, 53 RBIs, and a .343 on-base percentage in 143 games. He led NL third basemen with 25 errors, and he had a major-league-low .935 fielding percentage at third.\n\nIn , Tracy had a breakout season, as he batted .308 (7th-best in the league) with 27 home runs and 72 RBIs. He also had a slugging percentage of .533, 10th-best in the NL.\n\nTracy's numbers dipped in the season. He batted .281 with 20 homers and 80 RBIs. His slugging percentage went down over 100 points from his 2005 total, going from .553 to .451. His 129 strikeouts went up as they nearly doubled his 2005 total. He also tied Edwin Encarnación for the major league lead in errors by a third baseman, with 25, as he again had a .935 fielding percentage at third base.\n\nHis numbers dipped again in 2007, as he batted .264—the lowest batting average of his major league career. He batted .222 with 2 out and runners in scoring position.\n\nIn 2008, he had his lowest on-base percentage (.308) and slugging percentage (.414) of his major league career, as he batted .267. He again batted .222 with 2 out and runners in scoring position.\n\nOn May 6, 2009, Tracy (who was batting .224) was taken out of the starting lineup, replaced by Josh Whitesell, who was called up to the Diamondbacks after hitting .356 for the Reno Aces with a .477 on-base percentage (2nd in the Pacific Coast League) and a .552 slugging percentage. Manager Bob Melvin said Whitesell would get a chance to play every day, and that Tracy \"is going to pinch hit, (and) he's going to fill in at third and first for a while.\" That did not last long, however, as on May 19, not even two weeks later, Melvin had been fired as manager and the team optioned Whitesell back to Reno.\n\nA right-oblique strain that Tracy suffered May 29 led to him being placed on the 15-day disabled list. Tracy came off the disabled list after missing 27 games.\n\nTony Clark was released in mid-July, and Whitesell was called back up for the third time in the season to replace him on July 16. Tracy said: Obviously, I want the playing time, I want to be out there every day. Right now, there are a lot of question marks, especially for me, and some of the other guys that are on their last year of their contract or have some value to be traded, so I think we're probably at that point now where anything can happen. I wouldn't be surprised by anything. Manager AJ Hinch spoke with Tracy, who was batting a career-low .222 with a .288 on-base percentage at the time, and Whitesell on July 17. He told them that Whitesell would get the bulk of the action at first base, starting four or five times a week \"for the time being\". After the 2009 season, the Arizona Diamondbacks did not pick up Tracy's 2010 option, which permitted Tracy to file for free agency.\n\nOn January 26, 2010, Tracy signed a minor league contract with the Chicago Cubs with an invite to spring training. The deal was announced on January 27, 2010. On March 29, the Cubs announced that Tracy had made the major league Cubs' 25 man roster. On May 7, Tracy was sent down to the Triple-A Iowa Cubs to make room for Starlin Castro. Tracy was designated for assignment by the Cubs. Tracy was released by the Cubs on July 1, 2010.\n\nTracy signed with the New York Yankees on July 9, 2010, and he was assigned to the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees but eventually opted out of his contract, making him a free agent.\n\nTracy signed with the Florida Marlins on August 5, 2010.\n\nTracy signed with the Hiroshima Toyo Carp of Japan to play the 2011 season.\n\nChad Tracy signed a minor league deal with the Washington Nationals in the spring of 2012. He showed enough improvement at the plate during spring training to make the club's opening day roster. He was made a member of the Nationals' bench, where he was a productive left-handed bat. In two seasons, he hit .269 in 2012 but declined to just .202 in 2013, his final season for the Nationals.\n\nTracy signed a minor league deal with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim on January 29, 2014. He was released on March 23. On April 26, Tracy announced his retirement from baseball.\n\nIn 2007, Tracy married Katie Martin. They have four daughters: Ella, Brynn, Leah, and Ruthie.

The Microcord (1951) was based on the Rolleicord; it was soon (1952) followed by the Microcord Mk II, with an improved shutter (the German Prontor). The Ross lens is of high quality. In 1958, MPP brought out the lever-wound Microflex, inspired by the Rolleiflex. This had excellent optics (by Taylor, Taylor and Hobson) and the camera was well made, but the crank invited hard use for which it was not designed. Shortly after its introduction, Britain dropped the high duty rates that had made Rollei equipment prohibitively expensive, and the Microflex had to be heavily discounted.\n\nOther products included enlargers (even for large format), projectors, dark slides, carrying cases and a flashgun that was similar in design and appearance to Graflex models.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1869931", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1869931", "title": "Princess Marie Bonaparte", "text": "Princess Marie Bonaparte\n\nPrincess Marie Bonaparte (2 July 1882 – 21 September 1962), known as Princess George of Greece and Denmark upon her marriage, was a French author and psychoanalyst, closely linked with Sigmund Freud. Her wealth contributed to the popularity of psychoanalysis, and enabled Freud's escape from Nazi Germany.\n\nMarie Bonaparte was a great-grandniece of Emperor Napoleon I of France. She was the only child of Roland Napoléon Bonaparte, 6th Prince of Canino and Musignano (19 May 1858 – 14 April 1924) and Marie-Félix Blanc (1859–1882). Her paternal grandfather was Prince Pierre Napoleon Bonaparte, son of Lucien Bonaparte, 1st Prince of Canino and Musignano, Napoleon's rebellious younger brother. For this reason, despite her title Marie was not a member of the dynastic branch of the Bonapartes who claimed the French imperial throne from exile. Her maternal grandfather was François Blanc, the principal real-estate developer of Monte Carlo. It was from this side of her family that Marie inherited her great fortune.\n\nShe was born at Saint-Cloud, a town in Hauts-de-Seine, Île-de-France and called \"Mimi\" within the family. Her maternal grandfather, François Blanc, had left an estimated fortune of FF 88M when he died in 1877. However, his widow, born Marie Hensel, left mostly debts for her three children, including Marie's mother Marie-Félix, to pay off upon her death in July 1881. Prince Roland protected his wife's fortune by persuading her to renounce that of her late mother before the amount of her debts became known. Marie-Felix died of an embolism shortly after Marie's birth, leaving half of her FF 8.4M dowry to her husband and half to her daughter. Most was managed in trust during Marie's youth by her father, who had few financial resources of his own. Marie lived with her father, a published geographer and botanist, in Paris and on various family country estates where he studied, wrote and lectured, leading an active life in Parisian academic circles and on expeditions abroad, while her daily life was supervised by tutors and servants. Afflicted by phobias and hypochondria as a youth, Marie spent much of her time in seclusion, reading literature and writing the personal journals which reveal her inquisitive spirit and early commitment to the scientific method reflected in her father's scholarship.\n\nSeveral candidates for future husband presented themselves or were considered by Prince Roland for his daughter's hand, notably a distant cousin of the princely House of Murat, Prince Hermann of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and Louis II, Prince of Monaco. Following a Parisian luncheon Prince Roland hosted for King George I of Greece in September 1906 during which the king agreed to the prospect of a marriage between their children, Prince George of Greece and Denmark, second of the king's five sons, was introduced to Marie on 19 July 1907 at the Bonapartes' home in Paris. He courted her for twenty-eight days, confiding that from 1883, George had lived not at his father's Greek court in Athens, but at Bernstorff Palace near Copenhagen with Prince Valdemar of Denmark, his father's youngest brother. The queen had taken the boy to Denmark to enlist him in the Danish royal navy and consigned him to the care of Valdemar, who was an admiral in the Danish fleet. Feeling abandoned by his father on this occasion, George described to his fiancée the profound attachment he developed for his uncle. He admitted that, contrary to what he knew were her hopes, he could not commit to living permanently in France since he was obligated to undertake royal duties in Greece or on its behalf if summoned to do so. Once his proposal of marriage was accepted, the bride's father was astonished when George waived any contractual clause guaranteeing an allowance or inheritance from Marie; she would retain and manage her own fortune (a trust yielding 800,000 francs \"per annum\", her father leaving 60 million francs on his death in 1924) and only their future children would receive legacies.\n\nOn 21 November 1907 in Paris, Marie and George were married in a civil ceremony, with a subsequent Greek Orthodox ceremony on 12 December 1907, at Athens. Thereafter she was known as Princess George of Greece and Denmark.\n\nBy March 1908 Marie was pregnant and, as agreed, the couple returned to France to take up residence. When George brought his bride to Denmark for the first visit with his uncle, Prince Valdemar's wife, Marie d'Orléans, was at pains to explain to Marie Bonaparte the intimacy which united uncle and nephew, so deep that at the end of each of George's several yearly visits to Bernstorff he would weep, Valdemar would fall sick, and the women learned the patience not to intrude upon their husbands' private moments. During the first of these visits, Marie Bonaparte and Valdemar found themselves engaging in the kind of passionate intimacies she had looked forward to with her husband who, however, only seemed to enjoy them vicariously, sitting or lying beside his wife and uncle. On a later visit, Marie Bonaparte carried on a passionate flirtation with Prince Aage, Valdemar's eldest son. In neither case does it appear that George objected, or felt obliged to give the matter any attention. Marie Bonaparte came to admire the forbearance and independence of Valdemar's wife under circumstances which caused her bewilderment and estrangement from her own husband.\n\nAlthough Marie occasionally joined her husband in Greece or elsewhere for national holidays and dynastic ceremonies, their life together was spent mostly on her estates in the French countryside. For months at a time, George was in Athens or Copenhagen, while Marie was in Paris, Vienna or traveling with the couple's children. That pattern allowed each to pursue activities in which the other had little interest.\n\nThe couple had two children, Peter (1908–1980) and Eugénie (1910–1989).\n\nFrom 1913 to early 1916, Marie carried on an intense flirtation with French prime minister Aristide Briand, but went no further because she did not want to share him with his mistress, the actress Berthe Cerny. Matters came to a head in April 1916, when Berthe Cerny broke off the relationship.\nThe affair with Briand lasted until May 1919. In 1915 Briand wrote to her that, having come to know and like Prince George, he felt guilty about their secret passion. George tried to persuade him that Greece, officially neutral during World War I but whose King was suspected of sympathy for the Central Powers, really hoped for an Allied victory: He may have influenced Briand to support the Allied expedition against the Bulgars at Salonika. When the prince and princess returned in July 1915 to France following a visit to the ailing King Constantine I in Greece, her affair with Briand had become notorious and George expressed a restrained jealousy. By December 1916 the French fleet was shelling Athens and in Paris Briand was suspected, alternately, of having seduced Marie in a futile attempt to bring Greece over to the Allied side, or of having been seduced by her to oust Constantine and set George upon the Greek throne.\n\nDespite what she described as sexual dysfunction, Marie Bonaparte conducted affairs with Freud's disciple Rudolph Loewenstein as well as Aristide Briand, her husband's aide-de-camp Lembessiss, a prominent married French physician, and possibly others. Troubled by her difficulty in achieving sexual fulfillment, Marie engaged in research. In 1924, she published her results under the pseudonym \"A. E. Narjani\" and presented her theory of frigidity in the medical journal Bruxelles-Médical. Having measured the distance between the clitoris and the vagina in 243 women, she concluded after analyzing their sexual history that the distance between these two organs was critical for the ability to reach orgasm (\"volupté\"); she identified women with a short distance (the \"paraclitoridiennes\") who reached orgasm easily during intercourse, and women with a distance of more than two and a half centimeters (the \"téleclitoridiennes\") who had difficulties while the \"mesoclitoriennes\" were in between. Marie considered herself a \"téleclitorienne\" and approached Josef Halban to surgically move her clitoris closer to the vagina. She underwent and published the procedure as the Halban–Narjani operation. When it proved unsuccessful in facilitating the sought-after outcome for Marie, the physician repeated the operation.\n\nShe modeled for the Romanian modernist sculptor Constantin Brâncuși. His sculpture of her, \"Princess X\", created a scandal in 1919 when he represented her or caricatured her as a large gleaming bronze phallus. This phallus symbolizes the model's obsession with the penis and her lifelong quest to achieve vaginal orgasm.\n\nIn 1925, Marie consulted Freud for treatment of what she described as her frigidity, which was later explained as a failure to have orgasms during missionary position intercourse. It was to Marie Bonaparte that Freud remarked, \"The great question that has never been answered and which I have not yet been able to answer, despite my thirty years of research into the feminine soul, is 'What does a woman want?'\".\nAlthough Prince George maintained friendly relations with Freud, in 1925 he asked Marie to give up her work in psychoanalytical studies and treatment to devote herself to their family life, but she declined.\n\nRobed in the diplomatic immunity of a member of a reigning European royal family and possessed of great wealth, Marie was often able to help those threatened or despoiled by World War II. When the Greek royal family were in exile or Greece was under occupation, she helped support her husband's banished relatives, including allowing the family of her husband's nephew, Prince Philip of Greece, to occupy one of her homes in Saint-Cloud and paying for their private schooling while sending her own children to public \"lycées\".\n\nLater she paid Freud's ransom to Nazi Germany and bought the letters Freud had written to Wilhelm Fliess about his use of cocaine from Fliess's widow when he could not afford her price. Freud wished the letters destroyed, but Marie refused, insisting that they were of historical importance. She agreed never to read them, however, and they were not published until 1984. She was also instrumental in delaying the search of Freud's apartment in Vienna by the \"Gestapo\" and later arranged for Freud to smuggle abroad some of his savings in a Greek diplomatic pouch. She persuaded Anton Sauerwald, a Nazi, to sign the papers enabling Freud to leave Vienna and also arranged for the transport to London of his books, collection of antiquities and analytic couch.\n\nOn 2 June 1953, Marie and her husband represented their nephew, King Paul of Greece, at the coronation of Elizabeth II in London. Bored with the pageantry, Marie offered a sampling of the psychoanalytic method to the gentleman seated next to her, the future French president François Mitterrand. Mitterrand obliged Marie, and the couple barely witnessed the pomp and ceremony, finding their own dialogue far more interesting.\n\nShe practiced as a psychoanalyst until her death in 1962, providing substantial services to the development and promotion of psychoanalysis. She authored several books on psychoanalysis, translated Freud's work into French and founded the French Institute of Psychoanalysis (\"Société Psychoanalytique de Paris SPP\") in 1926. In addition to her own work and preservation of Freud's legacy, she also offered financial support for Géza Róheim's anthropological explorations. A scholar on Edgar Allan Poe, she wrote a biography and an interpretation of his work.\n\nBonaparte's translation of a sentence in Freud's thirty-first Vorlesungen, \"Wo Es war, soll Ich werden\", has generated some controversy. Strachey translated it into English as \"Where Id was, Ego shall be\". Lacan, arguing that Freud used \"\"das\" Es\" and \"das\" Ich\" when he intended the meaning to be \"Id\" and \"Ego\", suggested \"Wo Es war, soll Ich werden\" be translated \"Where It was, there shall I come to be\". Bonaparte translated it into French as \"le moi doit déloger le ça\", meaning in English roughly \"Ego must dislodge Id\", which according to Lacan is directly contrary to Freud's intended meaning.\n\nShe died of leukemia in Saint-Tropez on 21 September 1962. She was cremated in Marseille, and her ashes were interred in Prince George's tomb at Tatoï, near Athens.\n\nThe story of her relationship with Sigmund Freud, including assisting his family's escape into exile, was made into a television film in 2004 as \"\", directed by Benoît Jacquot, starring Catherine Deneuve as Princess Marie Bonaparte and Heinz Bennent as Freud.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The name \"Leevi\" is often taken to mean Sundqvist personally, although this is incorrect, and \"Leevi\" refers to a late friend of the band members. Sundqvist kept himself almost completely hidden from publicity and Leevi and the Leavings never performed in front of a live audience, with only one exception under the name \"Tarmo Dynamo\". In the 1980s and 90s, Gösta and the band gave some interviews but after the year 1996 Sundqvist became a total media hermit.\n\nSundqvist is best remembered by the songs he composed, arranged, and wrote the lyrics for. His lyrics were down-to-earth which was probably the key to success among the Finnish public. His subjects covered loneliness, sexuality, alcoholism, mental health, environment and society, often with sarcasm and black humour. In 1990 Sundqvist expanded his work to include radio comedy. He wrote several humorous shows for the radio station formerly known as Radiomafia, including \"Tietokoneenkorjauskurssi\" (\"Computer repair course\") and \"Koe-eläinpuisto\" (\"Laboratory animal park\").\n\nLeevi and the Leavings started their career at the end of the 1970s, but became popular in wider circles in the second half of the 80s.

He pioneered the use of gross national product (GNP) as the basis for studying national economies.\n\nColin Clark was born in London in 1905 and was educated at the Dragon School in Oxford. He then studied at Winchester College, then at Brasenose College, Oxford where he graduated in Chemistry in 1928. After graduation he worked as a research assistant with William Beveridge at the London School of Economics (1928–29) and then with Sir Alexander Carr-Saunders and Allyn Young at the University of Liverpool (1929–30). During this time he ran unsuccessful campaigns to be elected to parliament for the British Labour Party in the seat of North Dorset (1929), and later for Liverpool Wavertree (1931) and South Norfolk (1935).\n\nIn 1930 he was appointed a research assistant to the National Economic Advisory Council newly convened by Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald. He resigned shortly after his appointment, after being asked to write a background memorandum to make a case for protectionism. Despite this, he had sufficiently impressed one of the council members (John Maynard Keynes) to secure an appointment as a lecturer in statistics at Cambridge University.\n\nHe was a lecturer in Statistics in Cambridge from 1931 to 1938 where he completed three books: \"The National Income 1924–31\" (1932), \"The Economic Position of Great Britain\" (jointly with A.C Pigou) (1936) and \"National Income and Outlay\" (1937). His first book was sent to the publisher Daniel Macmillan with a recommendation from Keynes: \"[...] Clark is, I think, a bit of a genius: almost the only economic statistician I have ever met who seems to me quite first-class.\"\n\nDuring a visit to Australia and New Zealand in 1937 and 1938 he accepted a position with the Queensland Government at the invitation of the premier Forgan Smith. At the time he wrote to Keynes about his decision to stay in Australia. As he put it, the chance to advise the Queensland Premier on 'practically everything connected with economic matters' was 'too remarkable an opportunity to be missed for putting economics into practice'\n\nOn 6 May 1938, he was appointed Government Statistician, Director of the Bureau of Industry, and Financial Advisor to Queensland Treasury, and provided the State's first set of economic accounts in 1940. He also held the position of Deputy Director (Queensland) of the Commonwealth Department of War Organisation of Industry from 1942 to 1946. Clark resigned as Government Statistician on 28 February 1947 to become Under Secretary of the Queensland Department of Labour and Industry.\n\nUnusually for a public servant he continued his academic work, publishing numerous articles in Economics and preparing his book \"Conditions of Economic Progress\" which was published in 1940.\n\nIn 1951 he took a secondment to the Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome (1951) and then to the University of Chicago (1952) before taking the Directorship of the Institute for Agricultural Economics at Oxford University (1952–69). He returned to Australia in 1969 as the Director of the Institute of Economic Progress at Monash University (1969–78) and finally as a Research Consultant to the Department of Economics at the University of Queensland until his death in 1989.\n\nHe was on the Council of the Econometric Society from 1948 to 1952.\n\nClark married Marjorie Tattersall in 1931, and they had 8 sons and 1 daughter who in turned produced a total of 40 grandchildren. His son Gregory became an author and academic in Japan. His nephew is the cognitive psychologist and computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton.\n\nClark died in Brisbane, Australia in 1989. He is buried together with his wife Marjorie at the Mount Gravatt Cemetery in Brisbane (Section 3B).\n\nIn 1984 he was named by the World Bank as one of the \"pioneers of development\" along with Sir Arthur Lewis, Gunnar Myrdal, W.W. Rostow and Jan Tinbergen.\n\nIn 1987 Clark was together with Professor Trevor Swan the first recipient of the Distinguished Fellow awards, presented by The Economic Society of Australia.\n\n\n\n"}

It was first published in Barcelona, by Juan Bta. Pujol & Co., in 1892 as the prelude of a three-movement set entitled \"Chants d'Espagne\".\n\nThe name \"Asturias (Leyenda)\" was given to it posthumously by the German publisher Hofmeister, who included it in the 1911 \"complete version\" of the \"Suite española\", although Albéniz never intended the piece for this suite. Despite the new name, this music is not considered suggestive of the folk music of the northern Spanish region of Asturias, but rather of Andalusian flamenco traditions. \"Leyenda\", Hofmeister's subtitle, means \"legend\". The piece is noted for the delicate, intricate melody of its middle section and abrupt dynamic changes.\n\nAlbéniz's biographer, Walter Aaron Clark, describes the piece as \"pure Andalusian flamenco\". In the main theme the piano mimics the guitar technique of alternating the thumb and fingers of the right hand, playing a pedal-note open string with the index finger and a melody with the thumb. The theme itself suggests the rhythm of the bulería—a fast flamenco form. The \"marcato\"/\"staccato\" markings suggest both guitar sounds and the footwork of a flamenco dancer. The piece sounds as though it is written in the Phrygian mode which is typical of bulerías. The second section is a reminiscent of a copla—a sung verse following a specific form. Clark states that it is written in typical Albéniz form as it is \"presented monophonically but doubled at the fifteenth for more fullness of sound. The music alters between a solo and accompaniment that is typical of flamenco. The short middle section of the piece is written in the style of a malagueña—another flamenco style piece. The malagueña borrows two motives from the previous copla and builds on them. The piece returns to its first theme until a slow \"hymn-like\" passage ends the piece.\n\nIt is not possible to transcribe the piece note for note for guitar. The original version makes uses of the piano keyboard's wider range compared to the tessitura of the guitar, and the key is not suitable for the guitar.\n\nMany have attributed the first transcription for guitar to Francisco Tárrega who put it in its most recognizable key, E minor. According to the guitarist and guitar scholar Stanley Yates, the first guitar transcription of the piece was probably by Severino García Fortea, although Andrés Segovia's transcription is the most famous and most influential. The piece has become one of the most important works of the classical guitar repertoire. Robbie Krieger, guitarist of The Doors, uses a reworking of the melody from this classical piece in The Doors song \"Spanish Caravan\" from their 1968 album \"Waiting For The Sun\".\n\n"}

The PIP is almost always actively determined by a targeting computer, which then projects a PIP marker (a \"pipper\") onto a Head-Up Display (HUD). Modern HUDs are focused so the weapon operator will see the marker projected directly over the point of impact, regardless of the position of their eye.\n\nModern combat aircraft are equipped to calculate the PIP for onboard weapons at any given time. Using the PIP marker, pilots can achieve good accuracy at ranges of up to several kilometers, whether the target is ground-based or airborne. Variables included in the calculation are aircraft velocity, target velocity, target elevation, distance to target, forces on the projectile (drag, gravity), and others.\n\nAnother example of devices that show the PIP are red dot sights like the M68 Aimpoint. Such sights, like on a HUD's, are collimated reflector sights, so the dot always appears over the weapon's impact point, regardless of the shooter's eye position. Red dot sights do not use internal computers and must be manually zeroed for maximum accuracy.\n\n"}

The term is used in slightly different ways among the various schools of Hellenistic philosophy.\n\nThe Pyrrhonists developed the concept of \"epoché\" to describe the state where all judgments about non-evident matters are suspended in order to induce a state of ataraxia (freedom from worry and anxiety). The Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus gives this definition: \"Epoché is a state of the intellect on account of which we neither deny nor affirm anything.\" This concept is similarly employed in Academic Skepticism, but without the objective of ataraxia.\n\nIn Stoicism the concept is used to describe the withholding of assent to phantasiai (impressions). For example, Epictetus uses the term in this manner: \"If what philosophers say is true, that in all men action starts from one source, feeling, as in assent it is the feeling that a thing is so, and in denial the feeling that it is not so, yes, by Zeus, and in epoché, the feeling that it is uncertain: so also impulse towards a thing is originated by the feeling that it is fitting, and will to get a thing by the feeling that it is expedient for one, and it is impossible to judge.\"\n\nEpoché plays an implicit role in subsequent philosophical skeptic thought, as in René Descartes' epistemic principle of methodic doubt. The term was popularized in modern philosophy by Edmund Husserl. Husserl elaborates the notion of 'phenomenological epoché' or 'bracketing' in \"Ideas I\". Through the systematic procedure of 'phenomenological reduction', one is thought to be able to suspend judgment regarding the general or naive philosophical belief in the existence of the external world, and thus examine phenomena as they are originally given to consciousness.\n\nEpoché plays an important role in Pyrrhonism, the skeptical philosophy named after Pyrrho. Pyrrhonism provides practitioners with techniques for achieving epoché through use of the Ten Modes of Aenesidemus, the Five Modes of Agrippa, and the Pyrrhonist maxims. Pyrrhonism is mostly known today through the writings of the Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus whose surviving works appear to be an encyclopedia of Pyrrhonist arguments for inducing epoché across a breadth of philosophical and other intellectual issues of antiquity.\n\nEpoché, or Bracketing in phenomenological research, is described as a process involved in blocking biases and assumptions in order to explain a phenomenon in terms of its own inherent system of meaning. This is a general predisposition one must assume before commencing phenomenological study. This involves systematic steps to \"set aside\" various assumptions and beliefs about a phenomenon in order to examine how the phenomenon presents itself in the world of the participant.\n\n"}

Later that month over 70,000 people attended to hear the American evangelist Billy Graham. \n\nThe largest crowd ever for a concert event in Australia was the 1967 Seekers homecoming concert at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl which an estimated 200,000 people attended. The 2007 \"Guinness Book of World Records\" lists it as the greatest attendance at a concert in the Southern Hemisphere in history. This attendance is also included in The Australian Book Of Records. Melburnians were celebrating the annual Moomba Festival, a free community festival, and many thousands were enjoying other attractions but are included in the crowd estimate. Since then, international performers have included: ABBA, AC/DC, Metallica, Wings, Blondie, the Beach Boys, Crowded House, Dire Straits, Neil Diamond, Bob Dylan, the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra, Merle Haggard, Pearl Jam, the Electric Light Orchestra, Paul McCartney, Midnight Oil, INXS, R.E.M., Kiri Te Kanawa, Daft Punk, Red Hot Chili Peppers and, in more recent times, Bon Jovi, Guns N' Roses, Soundgarden, Tool, Kanye West, Paramore, Neil Young, Lenny Kravitz, Swedish House Mafia, blink-182, the Black Keys, Lorde and the Chainsmokers.\n\nIn 1980, administration of the bowl was handed over to the Victorian Arts Centre from the Sidney Myer Fund by Ken Myer, Sidney Myer's son. In 1984 a temporary ice-skating rink was created on the bowl's stage for use during winter months. The venue was closed for a major renovation in 2000 to bring the facilities up to an appropriate standard, and was reopened by the Premier of Victoria, Steve Bracks, at Carols by Candlelight on Christmas Eve, 2002. Recent works on the lawns extending from the seating and stage, and the construction of a fence and gates has reduced the total capacity to a little over 12,000, however this has also improved the visibility and standard of facilities out of sight.\n\nIn 2009 the 50th anniversary of the Sidney Myer Music Bowl was celebrated. The Arts Centre put together a four-day commemorative program of free events. From 12 to 15 February, the festivities featured two concerts from the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, including a recreation of their 1959 opening concert of the bowl and a romantic Valentine's Day program; a salute to 50 years of rock and roll at the bowl from \"RocKwiz\" and an afternoon picnic of family entertainment. There was also an informative exhibition at the St Kilda Road Foyer Gallery of the Arts Centre and a commemorative website depicting 50 years of the bowl.\n\nThe bowl's canopy consists of a thin membrane made out of half an inch weather-proofed plywood sheeted on both sides with aluminium attached to a cobwebbed frame of steel cables and supported by masts pivoted to the earth. The total area of the canopy is . The main cable at the edge of the canopy comprises 7 ropes, each about 9 cm in diameter and long, anchored deep into the ground in concrete blocks. Longitudinal cables hold up the roof and transverse cables hold it down.\n\nProject design was by Yuncken Freeman and Griffiths and Simpson during 1956. The project architect was Barry Patten. Construction commenced in 1958 with an innovative system of cables laced together and covered with aluminium faced plywood sandwich panels. To ensure the structure would be watertight yet aerodynamically stable and flexible, new construction techniques were developed. Ground anchors were required to be corrosion resistant. The shell also needed to be acoustically correct. Construction entailed input from a number of engineering and scientific organisations including the Aeronautical Research Laboratories and Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Forest Products Division.\n\nUnlike the Hollywood Bowl's concrete shell structure in Los Angeles which inspired it, the Sidney Myer Music Bowl combined a tensile structural system with a free-form roof. The structural design predates by nearly 10 years noted German architect and engineer Frei Otto and his experiments in using lightweight tensile and membrane structures. Otto's design of Munich's Olympic Park for the 1972 Olympics and the temporary West German pavilion at the 1967 World's Fair in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, were heavily influenced by Patten's design of Melbourne's Myer Music Bowl.\n\nThe Sidney Myer Music Bowl is registered on the Victorian Heritage list for its cultural importance to Victoria, its architectural importance as the largest, purpose built, permanent outdoor performance venue in Australia and its engineering experimentation in new forms of construction involving use of membranes and a tensile structural system.\n\nThere is a fixed seating area which can hold 2,030 people. Behind this area are sloping lawns which can accommodate up to 10,000. The stage area is 27.4 metres wide by 19.5 metres deep ().\n\nThe bowl holds major events including Vision Australia's Carols by Candlelight, held every year on Christmas Eve, televised each year by the Nine Network.\n\n"}

He then frequented some art schools, and visited galleries and museums.\n\nHe was rapidly attracted by avant-garde painters, notably Yves Tanguy and Pablo Picasso, whose influences were visible in his first works. At 25 he painted a self-portrait full of premonition as he showed himself with a deformed hand and with the veins of his arm cut. He chose to kill himself 27 years later by cutting his veins.\n\nIn 1933 Domínguez met André Breton, a theoretician of Surrealism, and Paul Éluard, known as the poet of this movement, and took part a year later in the Surrealist exhibition held in Copenhagen and those of London and Tenerife in 1936. Domínguez was also working in Paris at the Atelier 17.\n\nHe popularized the Russian-invented technique of decalcomania as a Surrealist automatic technique in 1936, using gouache spread thinly on a sheet of paper or other surface (glass has been used), which is then pressed onto another surface such as a canvas. Automatism, invented by Andre Breton, was important for the Surrealists as a means of channeling their subconscious through art. Dominguez's style influenced many artists including Max Ernst, Hans Bellmer, Remedios Varo and Dutch poet and translator Gertrude Pape.\n\nHis 1937 oil painting \"The Infernal Machine\" sold for 2 770 000 FF (US$404,375) on June 8, 2000 at Drouot-Montaigne in Paris.\n\nHis 1933 oil painting \"Roma's portrait\" sold for 902,500 GBP (US$1,469,270) on Feb. 4. 2014 at Christie's in London.\n\nIn 1952 he started an affair with Marie-Laure de Noailles, who called him \"putchie\".\n\nDomínguez committed suicide December 31, 1957, by slitting his wrists in the bath.

He broadcast Montreal Expos games for every year of the team's existence, from 1969 to 2004. He is currently the French play-by-play voice of the Toronto Blue Jays on TVA Sports.\n\nDoucet began his career in 1959 as a translator for the Canadian Press news agency. After one year in 1960–1961 as a sports journalist for the short-lived \"Nouveau Journal\" daily, he went to \"La Presse\" in 1962, still as a sports journalist, where he remained until early 1972.\n\nDuring a long strike in 1964 at \"La Presse\", Doucet had a brief first experience in sports broadcasting, for Montreal Alouettes football games.\n\nHe got the assignment as the Montreal Expos beat writer for \"La Presse\" as soon as the franchise was awarded to Montreal in 1968, in addition to being the official scorer for games at Jarry Park.\n\nSometime in the middle of the Expos' first season in 1969, Doucet was asked to occasionally replace Jean-Pierre Roy as colour commentator on the now-defunct CKLM 1570, which held the French radio broadcast rights, as Roy moved to TV broadcasts once a week.\n\nIn 1972, as CKAC 730 became the Expos' new French radio flagship, Doucet was hired by the (now-defunct) Télémédia network to do play-by-play for all Montreal Expos games, in addition to the All-Star, League Championship and World Series games and a selection of pre-season Expos games.\n\nWhen Télémédia merged with Radiomutuel on September 30, 1994, creating the new Radiomédia network, he became an Expos employee and continued to do play-by-play but only for Montreal Expos games, which continued to be aired mostly on CKAC 730 until the end of 2003. (He was heard for a few games on CKVL 850 (now CINF 690) in 1995, and on CJMS 1040 in 2002 and 2003. CHMP-FM 98.5 took over as the French radio flagship in 2004 for the last season of the Expos in Montreal).\n\nOver his career, Doucet described more than 5,000 Major League Baseball games, including two perfect games (by Dennis Martínez in 1991 against the Los Angeles Dodgers and by New York Yankees pitcher David Cone against the Expos in 1999).\n\nDoucet was introduced in the Quebec Baseball Hall of Fame in 2002, in the Expos Hall of Fame in 2003 and in the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in 2004.\n\nWhile fans hope Doucet will be recognized by the Cooperstown Baseball Hall of Fame via the Ford C. Frick Award, this has not occurred (although he has been a finalist five times, including in 2011). Doucet has been described as \"the French-Canadian equivalent of Jaime Jarrín\" and even as \"Canada's Vin Scully\", but it has been noted that \"because he broadcast games in French, few of the people who cast final votes for admission to Cooperstown have heard Doucet work\", and that the language barrier might keep Doucet out of Cooperstown; at least one observer has suggested that Doucet has failed to win the Award because he is not an American.\n\nIn March 2005, Doucet became the official spokesperson for Encore Baseball Montreal, an organization initially created to keep the Expos in Montreal and which is now focused on promoting baseball in Quebec.\n\nIn June 2005, Doucet's efforts to create a French-language version of standard baseball terminology were underlined at length in a front-page story by the \"Wall Street Journal\".\n\nFrom 2006 to 2011, Doucet was the play-by-play voice for the home games of the Quebec Capitales. The Capitales play in the Can-Am League, an eight-team independent baseball league; their games are heard on CHRC 800 in Quebec City.\n\nIn August 2011, Doucet was hired by TVA Sports, a new sports television channel which went on the air a month later, as the play-by-play voice of the Toronto Blue Jays.\n\nIn collaboration with Marc Robitaille, Doucet has published a two-volume history of the Montreal Expos titled \"Il était une fois les Expos\".

As a result, Geist was placed in suspended animation in a stasis pod orbiting the planet Jerra until it crashed several years later, awakening him and bringing him into another war on the planet.\n\nThe Regular Army of the planet Jerra has been locked in a bloody civil war with the rebellious Nexrum Army, who believe that Earth should not be involved in governing its extraterrestrial colonies. In response, the Jerran Army developed the \"Most Dangerous Soldiers\", which turned out to work too well; the MDS units attacked everyone, including their allies. One such soldier, MD-02 \"Geist\", was ordered placed in suspended animation aboard a stasis satellite and launched into Jerra's orbit.\n\nAfter several years, Geist awakens after the stasis satellite crashes on Jerra. In a desolated city, Geist discovers a group of bandits, whose leader kills a stray soldier wearing a powered suit. Geist confronts the bandit leader over acquiring the dead soldier's suit. In a fight to the death over the suit, Geist slices off the leader's arms before impaling his combat knife through his skull. Vaiya, a female bandit, is attracted to Geist's strength, but other than her knowledge of both armies' activities, Geist shows no desire for her. The bandits spot a Jerran mobile fortress being attacked by Nexrum forces and find it as an opportunity to save the fortress for a price. Geist and the bandits form an uneasy alliance with the Jerran forces led by Colonel Krutes (Geist's former superior) before participating in a mission to stop the Jerran doomsday weapon \"Death Force\" from activating. Death Force's countdown commenced shortly after the president of a Jerran country was assassinated. Its purpose is to annihilate all life forms on Jerra without discrimination.\n\nLike a black knight, Geist equips himself with the acquired powered suit (which eventually becomes his trademark), and goes into the Brain Palace with Krutes' commandos and his bandit team in tow. All but Geist and Krutes are killed during the invasion. Upon reaching Brain Palace, Geist faces an advanced combat robot activated by Krutes, realizing that the colonel set him up. While Geist battles the robot, Krutes reaches the control center to deactivate the Death Force. He succeeds, but discovers that the robot he activated has failed to kill Geist. Krutes laughs heavily before Geist crushes his skull with his hands. When Vaiya arrives at the control center, she sees Geist set off Death Force, unleashing an army of machines that consume living matter to replicate, condemning all life on Jerra to death.\n\nLess than a year after Geist activated the Death Force, which decimated most of Jerra's population, he has kept himself busy by dismantling the Death Force machines one by one. The remnants of the human population have fled to a remote haven run by a warlord named Krauser. Krauser is another MDS unit, MD-01, who has a technology that hides his mobile fortress from the Death Force. When he encounters Geist, an initial fight takes place, where Krauser 'defeats' Geist, throwing him from a bridge of the fortress. Some time after, Krauser and the Jerran army plan to lure the Death Force machines into an abandoned city and detonate the lethal \"Jignitz Bomb\" to exterminate them.\n\nAgain, Geist's programming overrides any shred of humanity he may have, and he leads the Death Force off to Krauser's fortress, leaving Krauser's commandos to be destroyed in the Jignitz Bomb's detonation. Although most of the Death Force is consumed in the explosion as well, a large number of the machines fall upon Krauser's fortress while Geist confronts Krauser himself. Geist kills Krauser in hand-to-hand combat while the Death Force machines consume most of the refugees.(In the anime Krauser is caught in an explosion and Geist's empty helmet is later shown so while both are probably killed neither death is definitively confirmed.)\n\nThis comic takes place before the events of the first OVA. At a board of Regular Army officials, Lt. Leigh Wong attempts to persuade them to use Geist in battle; he is a genetically-engineered soldier bred to specialize in strategy and versatility, designed to perform as a solitary fighter, rather than within a group. Wong also mentions how Geist strictly follows feasible commands. She is dispatched to a base along with Geist, who has been instructed to work with the squad already stationed at the base, much to her frustration. The squad, led by Col. Stanton, reject Geist, viewing him as lifeless, who in turn is unaffected and assigns himself to the reserves as ordered by Stanton, much to Wong's displeasure.\n\nLater, Stanton briefs his men on the mission they will be undertaking, in which they are to investigate and if necessary, destroy a Nexrum collective at a temple within a jungle. Wong interrupts the briefing to make mention of the Nexrum's cyborg units, to the interest of the men who have never heard of them before; her interruption is in hopes that Stanton will make use of Geist, who is the only soldier with experience against cyborgs. Suddenly, a private rushes in to tell both of them to come outside. Sgt. Robard, a soldier with whom Geist has gotten into a fight, lies twitching on the floor with both arms severed, Wong quite sinisterly sees it as proof of Geist's efficiency.\n\nThe next morning, Stanton and his men are preparing to begin their mission, only to be halted when Wong and Geist suddenly show up. Once again, Stanton refuses to accept Geist, especially after what happened yesterday, keeping him as a reserve without armor. In the jungle, Geist takes effortless care of their encounters, eventually they reach the temple to discover a Nexrum ship armed with a large cannon. Geist and the soldiers quickly occupy the base, taking the enemy forces prisoner. Wong and Stanton investigate the ship, when suddenly the soldiers are ambushed by cyborgs piloting Nexrum machines. Geist is the only one to survive, having jumped onto the ship once it has begun to take off. On board, Wong discovers a plan for the Nexrum to fire the ship's cannon at their own city, which is loaded with nuclear weapons, and it's been ordered by Earth. With no way to stop the ship, Stanton and Geist take off to destroy the engines, but before they go any further, Stanton makes it clear that Geist is to tell no one of Earth's involvement with this plan, even if Geist outlives him, he must not mention it. The two of them battle with a machine that is guarding the engines, by the end of it Stanton is fatally wounded, and his armor covered in oil leaking from the enemy machine. With his view on Geist finally re-evaluated, Stanton delivers one final order, to don his armor and take out the ship's cannon. Geist successfully does so, tangling briefly with the same machine after he discovers its connections are still active, and prepares to hijack the jet section of it. Geist escapes just in time as a defense unit destroys the reactor circuit controls in the cockpit, destroying part of the ship's thrusters, causing it to dive into the temple. Wong cries out as she sees Geist fly past, unable to save her.\n\nThe temple goes up in an enormous explosion, and a Regular Army patrol discovers Geist waiting to be picked up. Before a jury, Geist does not speak of what happened in the mission, remembering Stanton's orders. For this, Col. Krutes comes to the conclusion, based on evidence, that Geist is in some way responsible for the deaths of Regular Army personnel and for failure of the mission. Krutes expresses his wish to execute Geist, but because of President Ryan's input, he is instead to be imprisoned in stasis.\n\nAlthough Hayato Ikeda was credited as director of \"M.D. Geist\", it was actually Ohata who did the overall direction. Because Ohata was 23 years old and inexperienced at the time, the producers brought in Ikeda for appearances. Ohata admitted that the numerous animation mistakes found on the first title were a result of a disorganized animation team. The \"Director's Cut\" edition, co-produced by Central Park Media, smoothed out most of the animation errors and featured additional footage - including a new introduction and epilogue.\n\n\"M.D. Geist\" was originally released in Japan by Nippon Columbia and re-released under the Denon label. In 1988, a trailer of the OVA under the title \"Thunder Warrior\" was produced by Gaga Communications along with a string of other anime titles the company was hoping to sell to the North American market. \"M.D. Geist\" was released in North America by Central Park Media in 1992; two years prior, the company used Geist as the logo for their mainstream anime label U.S. Manga Corps. Curiosity by fans over U.S. Manga Corps' logo boosted domestic sales of the OVA and prompted Central Park Media to collaborate with co-creator Koichi Ohata in producing a sequel. In 1996, Central Park Media released \"M.D. Geist - Director's Cut\", featuring roughly five minutes of additional footage - including a new introduction and epilogue that paved the way for the sequel. Months later, CPM released \"M.D. Geist II: Death Force\". In addition, the company commissioned Ohata and American artist Tim Eldred to illustrate the comic book adaptation.\n\nIn the United States, the Sci Fi Channel premiered \"M.D. Geist\" I and II during their Ani-Monday block at midnight E.S.T. September 29 and October 6, 2008 respectively. Following the closure of Central Park Media, \"M.D. Geist\" was re-licensed by ADV Films and was re-released on DVD in July 2009. It is currently available for digital download on iTunes by Manga Entertainment, along with \"Now and Then, Here and There\".\n\nTo coincide with the release of \"M.D. Geist I: Most Dangerous Soldier (Director's Cut)\" and \"M.D. Geist II: Death Force\", CPM Manga released a comic book adaptation written and drawn by Tim Eldred with Ohata as guest artist. This comic was preceded by Ground Zero, and served as a more refined version of the original 1986 OVA, in which several details were explained better to make up for some of the plot holes present in the original version. Nexrum is also known as \"Negstrom\" in the comics, and Krutes' name goes by the original Japanese romanization of \"Kurtz\".\n\nDarius Washington from Otaku USA magazine defined the original version of M.D. Geist as \"an entertaining action vid with okay production values, unique elements and a psychotically fun twist\" The owner of Central Park Media John O'Donnell jokingly named it \"the best bad anime ever made\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1870106", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1870106", "title": "Righteous army", "text": "Righteous army\n\nRighteous armies, sometimes called irregular armies or militias, are informal civilian militias that have appeared several times in Korean history, when the national armies were in need of assistance.\n\nThe first righteous armies emerged during the Khitan invasions of Korea and the Mongol invasions of Korea. They subsequently rose up during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598), the first and second Manchu invasions, and during the Japanese occupation and preceding events.\n\nDuring the long period of Japanese invasion and occupation from 1890 to 1945, the disbanded imperial guard, and Confucian scholars, as well as farmers, formed over 60 successive righteous armies to fight for Korean freedom on the Korean peninsula. These were preceded by the Donghak movement, and succeeded by various Korean independence movements in the 1920s and beyond, which declared Korean independence from Japanese occupation.\n\nThe righteous armies were an irregular military that fought the Japanese army that twice invaded Korea during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598). Righteous armies were most active in the Jeolla Province in the southwestern area of Korea. Righteous armies included peasants, scholars, former government officials, and Buddhist warrior monks as well. Righteous armies were important during the war because a significant portion of the expected government organized resistance had been destroyed in Gyeongsang and Chungcheong Provinces in the south by the force of Japanese arms at the outset. The \"natural\" defenders had been stripped away and the residue had been called north to help protect the fleeing king. Moreover, many of the district officers had obtained their commissions not through merit, but by bribery or influence, and were essentially incompetent or cowards. This was highlighted in their performance and in the performance of their units in the early days of the conflict.\nThis kind of resistance was totally unexpected by the Japanese invaders. In Japanese warfare, when the leaders fall, civilians would simply submit. However, after they learned that people were forming organized resistance against them, they were shocked. Japanese strategies were based on the premise that the people of Korea would submit to them and assist their supply line by giving their food. However, this was not the case and righteous armies continued to interrupt the Japanese supply line. People's voluntary resistance movements were one of the major reasons why Japanese invasion was not successful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLate Joseon dynasty period Korean nationalism outgrew the unplanned, spontaneous, and disorganized Donghak movement, and became more violent as the Japanese occupation began a brutal regime throughout the Korean peninsula and pursued repressive policies against the Korean people.\n\nThe Japanese occupiers fought with state-of-the-art cannons, machine guns, repeaters, mounted cavalry reconnaissance units in the mountains, and an entrenched class of informers and criminals developed over the previous decade before the battles began.\n\nKoreans fought with antique muzzle-loaders, staves, iron bars, and their hands. There were rare instances of modern weapons, and a few enemy weapons captured.\n\nFor at least thirteen years after 1905, small irregular forces, often led by regular army commanders, fought skirmishes and battles throughout Korea against Japanese police, armies, and underworld mercenaries who functioned to support Japanese corporations looting Korea, and as well armed Japanese settlers who seized Korean farms and land. In one period, according to Japanese records in \"Boto Tobatsu-shi\" (Annals of the Subjugation of the Insurgent), between October 1907 and April 1908, over 1,908 attacks were made by the Korean people against the invaders.\n\nWhile most attacks were done using available weapons, and bare hands, international arms dealers profited. Arms dealers and governments who supplied the Korean resistance included Chinese arms dealers from across the Yalu and in coastal waters; German arms dealers provided Mausers, and a French cruiser in September 1908, resupplied Korean Catholic armies in payment for gold at exorbitant prices. Smugglers from Japan as well supplied Murada weapons, with links to anti-Meiji forces who hoped to see Ito and his clan toppled in the wake of disasters in the Japanese economy.\n\nAfter the Russian revolution, some weaponry was diverted from the White forces into what is now North Korea, and supporters built there, however this was sparse and while white Russian mercenaries fought against the Japanese, this was a minor element.\n\nThe Righteous Army was formed by Yu In-seok and other Confucian scholars during the Peasant Wars. Its ranks swelled after the Queen's murder by the Japanese troops and Koreans. Under the leadership of Min Jeong-sik, Choe Ik-hyeon and Shin Dol-seok, the Righteous Army attacked the Japanese army, Japanese merchants and pro-Japanese bureaucrats in the provinces of Gangwon, Chungcheong, Jeolla and Gyeongsang.\n\nChoe Ik-hyeon was captured by the Japanese and taken to Tsushima Island where he went on hunger strike and finally died in 1906. Shin Dol-seok, an uneducated peasant commanded over 3,000 troops. Among the troops were former government soldiers, poor peasants, fishermen, tiger hunters, miners, merchants, and laborers.\n\nThe Korean army was disbanded in August 1, 1907. The Army was led by 1st Battalion Commander Major Park Seung-hwan, who later committed suicide, occurred after the disbandment, led by former soldiers of the Imperial Army against Japan in Namdaemun Gate. The disbanded army joined the Righteous Armies and together they solidified a foundation for the Righteous Armies battle.\n\nIn 1907, the Righteous Army under the command of Yi In-yeong massed 10,000 troops to liberate Seoul and defeat the Japanese. The Army came within 12 km of Seoul but could not withstand the Japanese counter-offensive. The Righteous Army was no match for two infantry divisions of 20,000 Japanese soldiers backed by warships moored near Incheon.\n\nThe Righteous Army retreated from Seoul and the war went on for two more years. Over 17,000 Righteous Army soldiers were killed and more than 37,000 were wounded in combat. Unable to fight the Japanese army head-on, the Righteous Army split into small bands of partisans to carry on the War of Liberation in China, Siberia and the Baekdu Mountains in Korea.

Marshall. Its members are civilian women and men appointed by the Secretary of Defense to provide advice and recommendations on matters and policies relating to the recruitment and retention, treatment, employment, integration, and well-being of women in the U.S. Armed Forces. It is authorized under the provisions of P.L. 92-463, the Federal Advisory Committee Act, and meets on a quarterly basis to review issues and conducts information-gathering activities through installation visits, meetings, reports, and surveys. The committee provides recommendations to the Secretary of Defense through an annual report.\n\nThe 1948 Women's Armed Services Integration Act established defined roles for women in the peacetime armed forces of the United States. Previously, they only had been allowed to serve as nurses in peacetime; a wider variety of roles only open to them in time of war. However, with the start of the Korean War in June 1950, the Department of Defense began to investigate ways to increase recruitment and retention of women in all services. Internal inquiries from defense agencies such as the National Security Resources Board and external pressure from politicians such as Senator Margaret Chase Smith added to the sense of urgency in defining a more comprehensive position for women in the military.\n\nAt the suggestion of Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manpower Anna Rosenberg, Marshall formed the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services in August 1951. Its first chair was Mary Pillsbury Lord, a civic activist who had been chair of the National Civilian Advisory Committee of the Women's Army Corps. Some of its original members included Oveta Culp Hobby, the first Women's Army Corps (WAC) director; Mildred McAfee Horton, former director of the WAVES; Ruth Streeter, former director of the Women Marines; actress Helen Hayes; Sarah G. Blanding, Vassar College president, engineer Lillian Gilbreth; and publisher Beatrice Gould. Meeting for three days at the Pentagon in September 1951, they heard presentations about recruiting and the possible need for a women's draft based on the failure of recruiting during World War II to meet the military services' requirements for women. The committee would help to develop policies and standards for women in the military—using them, expanding their opportunities, recruiting them, and training them. The committee ensured that military women would have representation at the Department of Defense.\n\nBeginning in 2002, the Committee began providing advice and recommendations on family issues related to recruitment and retention. DACOWITS' recommendations have been instrumental in effecting changes to laws and policies pertaining to military women.\n\nIn October 1955, Margaret Divver, advertising manager of the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company, was named to head the Committee, replacing Oliver Crowther. The Committee was exploring ways to interest better qualified women in military careers and explaining the increasing variety of positions available to them.\n\nIn October 1971, Estelle M. Stacy was appointed to serve as chair for the calendar year 1972, replacing Helen K. Leslie.\n\nAfter a November 1982 recommendation that 23 additional job categories be closed to women, increasing the number to 60 of 360 categories, the Committee's chair, Mary Huey of Texas Women's University, sought assurance from Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger that women's promotion would not suffer from these exclusions, and Weinberger did so. \nIn 1998 the Committee, then composed of 18 women and two men and chaired by Judith A. Youngman, an associate professor of political science at the Coast Guard Academy, and reporting directly to the Secretary of Defense, recommended increased integration of men and women during basic training after finding that \"most service members from every service believed that more gender integration of training was needed than currently existed\". It contradicted a late 1997 report of a committee headed by Senator Nancy Kassebaum Baker of Kansas, formed in response to reports of sexual harassment during training, that advocated the opposite. \nIn 2001, there were reports that the Bush administration was considering eliminating the Committee, along with a number of similar advisory groups devoted to women's concerns, and complaints that new appointments were being delayed.\n\nIn 2002, the charter of DACOWITS expired and the committee face elimination.\n\nThe Office of the Secretary of Defense issued a new charter for DACOWITs, reducing the number of members from 36 to 13 and adding family issues to the committee's remit.\n\nDACOWITS added the issue of sexual assault in the military to its review of policies and issues concerning the retention and deployment of female servicemembers. The committee conducted focus groups at military installations worldwide and used data and research from literature, military surveys, and military and civilian subject matter experts. The Committee's issued recommendations its 2004 report for dealing with sexual assault in the military, including the use of a new definition of sexual assault in the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the establishment of victim advocates independent of the chain of command, provision of training for servicemembers on the procedures and resources available to victims following a sexual assault, and educational awareness efforts.\n\nThe Defense Department Advisory Committee on Women in the Services focused on problems in retaining female military doctors, lawyers, and chaplains for periods longer than 5 to 8 years, identifying the potential of overseas deployments away from young children as a barrier to retention and exploring possible solutions (including leaves of absence).\n\nThe 2009 DACOWITS report included findings on U.S. servicewomen's roles in Operations Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Iraqi Freedom (OIF) over the past several years, stating, \"Most focus group participants reported that they or the females with whom they served had been involved in combat roles while deployed to OIF or OEF, e.g., in a combat theatre of operations, exposed to the possibility of hostile action from a threat to self or unit, and/or in a situation where they received hostile fire. The focus groups also described specific combat roles in which women have served, such as serving outside the wire—whether on convoys, as drivers, or otherwise traveling between camps—and participating in female search teams, including the Lioness program. For the most part, female focus group participants shared feelings of satisfaction and pride about their combat experiences.\"\n\nOn March 21, DACOWITS co-hosted an event with Veteran Affairs Center for Women Veterans at the Women in Military Service for American Memorial (Arlington National Cemetery, Virginia) celebrating the centennial of the enlistment of Loretta P. Walsh in the U.S. Naval Reserve Force on March 21, 1917. Walsh was officially the first woman to enlist in the U.S. military.\n\nD'Amico, Francine J., and Laurie L. Weinstein, eds.

{"id": "1870121", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1870121", "title": "Wilhelm Fliess", "text": "Wilhelm Fliess\n\nWilhelm Fliess (; 24 October 1858 – 13 October 1928) was a German Jewish otolaryngologist who practised in Berlin. He developed highly eccentric theories of human biorhythms and a possible nasogenital connection that have not been accepted by modern scientists. He is today best remembered for his close personal friendship and theoretical collaboration with Sigmund Freud, a controversial chapter in the history of psychoanalysis.\n\nFliess developed several idiosyncratic theories, such as 'vital periodicity', forerunner of the popular concepts of biorhythms. His work never found scientific favor, though some of his thinking – such as the idea of innate bisexuality – was incorporated into Freud's theories. Fliess believed men and women went through mathematically fixed sexual cycles of 23 and 28 days, respectively.\n\nAnother of Fliess's ideas was the theory of 'nasal reflex neurosis'. This became widely known following the publication of his controversial book \"Neue Beitrage und Therapie der nasaelen Reflexneurose\" in Vienna in 1892. The theory postulated a connection between the nose and the genitals and related this to a variety of neurological and psychological symptoms; Fliess devised a surgical operation intended to sever that link.\n\nOn Josef Breuer's suggestion, Fliess attended several conferences with Sigmund Freud beginning in 1887 in Vienna, and the two soon formed a strong friendship. Through their extensive correspondence and the series of personal meetings, Fliess came to play an important part in the development of psychoanalysis.\n\nFreud, who described Fliess as \"the Kepler of biology\", repeatedly allowed Fliess to operate on his nose and sinuses to cure his neurosis and also experimented with anaesthetization of the nasal mucosa with cocaine. Together, Fliess and Freud developed a \"Project for a Scientific Psychology\", which was later abandoned. Fliess wrote about his biorythmic theories in \"Der Ablauf des Lebens\".\nEmma Eckstein (1865–1924) had a particularly disastrous experience when Freud referred the then 27-year-old patient to Fliess for surgery to remove the turbinate bone from her nose, ostensibly to cure her of premenstrual depression. Eckstein haemorrhaged profusely in the weeks following the procedure, almost to the point of death as infection set in. Freud consulted with another surgeon, who removed a piece of surgical gauze that Fliess had left behind. Eckstein was left permanently disfigured, with the left side of her face caved in. Despite this, she remained on very good terms with Freud for many years, becoming a psychoanalyst herself.\n\nFliess also remained close friends with Freud. He even predicted Freud's death would be around the age of 51, through one of his complicated bio-numerological theories (\"critical period calculations\"). Their friendship, however, did not last to see that prediction out: in 1904 their friendship disintegrated due to Fliess's belief that Freud had given details of a periodicity theory Fliess was developing to a plagiarist. Freud died at 83 years of age.\n\nFreud ordered that his correspondence with Fliess be destroyed. It is only known today because Marie Bonaparte purchased Freud's letters to Fliess and refused to permit their destruction.\n\nHis son Robert Fliess was a psychoanalyst and a prolific writer in that field. He devised the phrase \"ambulatory psychosis\". Jeffrey Masson claimed that Fliess sexually molested his son Robert and that this caused Fliess to undermine Freud's investigation of the seduction theory because of its implications for his life.\n\nHis niece Beate Hermelin (née Fliess) was an experimental psychologist who worked in the UK, where she made major contributions in what is now known as developmental cognitive neuroscience.\n\nMedical science has given a highly negative verdict to Fliess' theories.\nThe nasogenital theory was briefly quite popular in late 19th century medical circles, but within a decade disappeared from the medical literature. Most scientists who have studied the question believe that the biorhythms theory has no more predictive power than chance and consider the concept an example of pseudoscience.\n\nAccording to Frank Sulloway, most of Freud's sympathetic biographers have attributed Freud's adherence to Fliess' pseudoscience to their strong personal friendship. Martin Gardner suggested that Freud's willingness to entertain Fliess' \"crackpottery\" casts doubt on psychoanalysis itself and has strongly condemned what he viewed as orthodox Freudians' attempts to hush up an embarrassment in the history of the movement.\n\nFliess appears as a character in Joseph Skibell's 2010 novel, \"A Curable Romantic\". The story of the relationship between Freud and Fliess is told by Martin Gardner in his July 1966 Mathematical Games column in Scientific American.\n\n"}

The first episode was broadcast on 16 September 2002, and a total of four series were produced. The series starred Ross Kemp as central character Staff Sergeant Henry 'Henno' Garvie. The show was initially described as a star vehicle for Kemp, who had been lured away from the BBC to ITV with a multimillion-pound contract. Kemp appeared in every episode of the four series. The series was co-created by Chris Ryan, a former British SAS soldier who was a member of the famous Bravo Two Zero patrol during the 1991 Gulf War. The series was produced by Bentley Productions.\n\nAs well as his behind the scenes role, creator Chris Ryan appeared in the first series of the show playing Blue Troop leader Johnny Bell. Domestically, the change of format seemed to produce diminishing returns for ITV. The third series was abruptly taken off air by the network midway through the run, only to return a few weeks later. The show was then moved to Saturday evenings at 9 p.m. A similar fate awaited series four, which was pulled after just two episodes. The three remaining episodes of the fourth series were not originally shown on ITV, but shown on ITV4, in January and February 2007. ITV showed the remaining three episodes of the series over a year later, starting on 18 May 2008. The DVD of the fourth series had previously been released on 25 September 2006. ITV then announced there would not be a fifth series, partially due to low ratings—hence the cutting of series three and four midway through their runs—whilst many of the stars moved onto other projects. \n\nRoss Kemp went on to host a series of documentaries following the progress of British Army troops in Afghanistan, whilst both Sam Callis and Christopher Fox joined ITV's police serial drama \"The Bill\". Notably, a large number of plotlines throughout the series were left unanswered: most notably, the killing of Iain Macalwain by Henno, the conflict in Pete Twamley's marriage, and the murder of Jamie Dow's step dad, who is hinted to have been killed by Ricky Mann. DVD sales of the first two series resulted in more than £700,000 of revenue by the arrival of the third series, with both regular and limited edition sets making the top ten of the television sales charts. The series has also been aired in 120 countries, ranging from Europe to Southeast Asia.\n\n\n\n\n\n<onlyinclude></onlyinclude>\n\n\nBritish Military dramas:\n\nUS Military dramas:\n\n\n"}

The mosque was established in 1826. This mosque is also known as Chulia Mosque and Periya Palli (meaning the \"Big Mosque\") among the Tamil Muslim community in Singapore. Together with its neighbour, Sri Mariamman Temple, the mosque stands out in its predominantly Chinese location. The Mosque Street that runs beside it may have been named after this mosque.\n\nJamae Mosque was established by the Chulias, who were Tamil Muslims from the Coromandel Coast of South India. They came to Singapore mostly as traders and money changers and set up three mosques within a short time, with Jamae Mosque being the first. The other two are Al-Abrar Mosque and Nagore Durgha, both of which are on Telok Ayer Street. A mosque was initially set up on South Bridge Road around 1826 under the leadership of Ansar Saib, and the current Jamae Mosque was then constructed on the site between 1830 and 1835.\n\nIn 1881, after the early benefactors had died, a lease was granted to five trustees of the mosque, and in 1894, the Jamae Mosque and Nagore Durgha were placed under a new panel of court-appointed trustees. In 1917, the Mohammedan and Hindu Endowments Board took over the management of the mosque until 1968, when it handed the reins over to Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (MUIS).\n\nDespite two proposals to rebuild it, the present structure has remained more or less unchanged since it was completed in 1835. Repair work was undertaken in 1996. Jamae Mosque is skewed towards Mecca although the mosque's compound is aligned with the street grid.\n\nJamae Mosque's value as a historical site was recognised when it was gazetted as a national monument on 19 November 1974.\n\nWorshippers enter the mosque through a gateway framed by two minarets topped by onion domes and a miniature four-storey palace façade. Rising out of solid bases, each minaret comprises seven levels embellished with a miniature \"mihrab\" motif and deep recesses. The palace façade sits on top of the gate, between the minarets. Intricately designed, it features tiny doors and cross-shaped windows.\n\nIn the mosque compound are a covered foyer, the main prayer hall, and the ancillary prayer hall. It also contains a shrine to an early local Muslim religious leader, Muhammad Salih Valinvah, whose grave existed on the site before the construction of the mosque in the 1830s. From the foyer, a stairway leads to the parapet from which calls to prayer would have been announced. Beyond the foyer is the ancillary prayer hall, a square airy room with arched openings in its brick walls. Timber fanlights and bars decorate each opening, as do patterned Chinese green glazed tiles. Inside the ancillary hall is the main prayer hall. Also a square airy room, it is supported by two rows of Tuscan columns with elaborate mouldings. Verandahs lie on the north and south sides, separated from the hall proper by timber doors.\n\nThe mosque's architectural style is eclectic that reflected the architectural styles of 1830s Singapore. While the entrance gate is distinctively South Indian, the two prayer halls and the shrine are in the Neo-Classical style typical of George Drumgoole Coleman, the first trained architect in Singapore. This uniqueness of Jamae Mosque made it a well-photographed landmark that may be seen in postcards from the 19th century to the present day.\n\nThe mosque is accessible from Chinatown MRT station.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1870163", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1870163", "title": "Cyfraith Hywel", "text": "Cyfraith Hywel\n\nCyfraith Hywel (; \"Laws of Hywel\"), also known as Welsh law (), was the system of law practised in medieval Wales before its final conquest by England. Subsequently, the Welsh law's criminal codes were superseded by the Statute of Rhuddlan in AD 1284 and its civil codes by Henry VIII's series of Laws in Wales Acts between 1535 and 1542.\n\nWelsh law was a form of Celtic law with many similarities to the Brehon law of Ireland and particularly the customs and terminology of the Britons of Strathclyde. It was passed down orally by jurists and bards and, according to tradition, only first codified during the reign of Hywel Dda in the mid-10th century. The earliest surviving manuscripts, however, are in Latin, date from the early 13th century, and show marked regional differences. The law is only known to have been revised by a few rulers (particularly Bleddyn ap Cynfyn, who was credited with revisions retained in the kingdom of Powys) but was obviously updated by jurists in response to changing jurisdictions and circumstances, so that the surviving manuscripts cannot be considered an accurate portrayal of Hywel's first code.\n\nNotable features of Welsh law include the collective responsibility of kindreds (Welsh: cenedl) for their members; the gavelkind inheritance of land among all and only male descendants; a status-based system of blood money (\"galanas\"); slavery and serfdom; the inability of foreigners to naturalize earlier than the fourth generation; and very lax treatment of divorce and legitimacy that scandalized the non-native clergy.\n\nThe laws include the \"laws of the court\", the laws laying down the obligations and entitlements of the king and the officers of his court and the \"laws of the country\" dealing with every other topic. In some versions of the laws some of the material in the laws of the country are split off into the \"justices' test book\" dealing with homicide, theft and the values of wild and tame animals and other items. Within each of these sections there are tracts of varying length dealing with different subjects, for example the law of women and the law of contracts. Civil law differed from most other codes of law in the rule that on a landowner's death his land was to be shared equally between his sons, legitimate and illegitimate. This caused conflict with the church, as under canon law illegitimate children could not inherit.\n\nOnce a case came to court, the method used to come to a decision was usually by compurgation. Under this system the person accused or the parties to a dispute would give their version under oath, following which they had to find a number of others who would take an oath that the principal's oath could be trusted. The number of compurgators required depended on the nature of the case. The judge or judges would then come to a decision. Capital punishment was only prescribed for a small number of crimes. Homicide was usually dealt with by the payment of compensation to the victim's family, while theft could be punished by death only if it was theft by stealth and the thief was caught with the goods in hand; the value of the goods stolen also had to exceed four pence. Most other offences were punished by a fine.\n\nMost of the surviving manuscripts of Welsh law start with a preamble explaining how the laws were codified by Hywel. The introduction to the Book of Blegywryd is a typical example:\n\nAs each of the manuscripts dates from centuries later than Hywel’s time, this statement cannot be used to date the event described above. Professor Huw Pryce has demonstrated that some of the prologues were developed in response to attacks on Welsh law by Church men and Nobles who wished to gain rights more akin to those enjoyed by Ecclesiastics and the aristocracy in England. In discussing Hywel’s association with the law, K. L. Maund suggests:\n\nOn the other hand, the Iorwerth versions, produced in Gwynedd, have exactly the same attribution of the law to Hywel and the council at Whitland as do the southern versions. It is more likely that Hywel’s name was used to lend some form of “ancestral authority\" to the laws.\n\nThe best that may be said of Hywel’s association with the law is that a folk memory recalled a revision and rejuvenation of the law during his reign. Other kings are said to have introduced later modifications to the laws, for example Bleddyn ap Cynfyn, king of Gwynedd and Powys in the mid 11th century.\n\nSome of the legal material, such as the tract on the Seven Bishop Houses of Dyfed, may be dated to a very early period of law. Other material bears comparison with Early Irish Law.\n\nAlthough there are a substantial number of manuscripts containing the law texts, there are no existing manuscripts of law texts dating back to the time of Hywel and Welsh law was continually being revised and updated. There has been some debate among scholars as to whether the laws were originally written in Welsh or Latin. The \"Surexit\" memorandum in the Lichfield Gospels is a record of the outcome of legal proceedings dating from the 9th century and written in Welsh, and though it is not a law manual it does indicate the use of Welsh legal terms at that time. The earliest manuscripts known are Peniarth 28, written in Latin but now generally thought to be a translation of a Welsh original, and Peniarth 29, known as the \"Black Book of Chirk\", written in Welsh. These are thought to date from the early or mid 13th century. There are a large number of law manuscripts, written mainly in Welsh but some in Latin, written between this period and the 16th century. Later manuscripts have been shown to reflect legal developments particularly in the Southern Welsh lordships. Apart from the full compilations there are shorter versions thought to have been working copies used by judges. However they are all usually considered to fall into three Redactions, known as the Cyfnerth Redaction, the Blegywryd Redaction and the Iorwerth Redaction.\n\n\nThe first part of the laws deal with the rights and duties of the king and the officers of the king's court. The order of precedence is set down: first the king, then the queen, then the or edling, the heir. Next come the officers of the court; the Iorwerth Redaction identifies twenty-four, of whom sixteen are the king's officers and eight the queen's officers. First in rank was the captain of the household troops, then the priest of the household, then the steward followed by the chief falconer, the court justice, the chief groom and the chamberlain. A list of additional officers follows, including such officers as the groom of the rein, the porter, the bakeress and the laundress. Each officer's entitlements and obligations are listed.\n\nIt introduces a number of legal terms. \"Sarhad\" could mean an insult or injury or the payment that was due to a person in the event of an insult or injury, and this varied according to the status of the person concerned, for example the queen or the edling's \"sarhad\" was one third that of the king. \"Galanas\" was a form of weregild and represented the value of a person's life in the event of a homicide and was set at three times the \"sarhad\", though the \"sarhad\" was also payable by the killer. \"Dirwy\" was a fine payable for crimes and \"camlwrw\" a smaller fine for less serious offences, while \"ebediw\" was a death duty payable to the deceased's lord. \"Sarhad\" and \"dirwy\" are still Welsh words meaning ‘insult’ and ‘fine’ respectively,\n\nThe origins of the various redactions are reflected in the relative position of the rulers of the Welsh kingdoms. The Iorwerth Redaction manuscripts proclaim the superiority of the king of Aberffraw, chief seat of the kingdom of Gwynedd, over the others, while the manuscripts from Deheubarth claim at least equality for the king of Dinefwr, chief seat of the southern kingdom.\n\nWhile Welsh law lays more emphasis on the powers of the king than the Brehon Law of Ireland, this is still restricted compared to many other codes. As Moore comments:\n\nFor the purposes of the laws, Welsh society was divided into five classes: the rulers, including the king (\"rhi\" or \"brenin\") over his kingdom and the lords over their fiefs; the free Welsh, including both the pedigreed aristocracy (\"boneddigion\" or \"uchelwr\") and the yeomen together; the Welsh serfs (\"taeogion\", \"ailltion\", or \"bileiniaid\"); foreigners resident in Wales (\"alltudion\"); and the slaves (\"caethion\"). The privileges, penalties, and obligations due by law varied with the social status of the person concerned.\n\nAt the time of Hywel's laws, \"Cymry\" the modern Welsh for all of the Welsh people apparently only applied to the free classes and not to serfs or slaves. However, none of them counted as a \"foreigner\" and, even if they moved from one Welsh \"kingdom\" (\"gwlad\") to another, they did not suffer that status but were considered fully native.\n\nThose from outside Wales were considered between serfs and slaves, forbidden to offer testimony, and obliged to pledge themselves to a native Welshman (even a serf) who would be responsible for them. This status could only be removed after three generations in the north and possibly as many as nine elsewhere, after which the foreigner's descendants were considered to be native serfs.\n\nThe position of women under Welsh law differed significantly to that of their Norman-English contemporaries. A marriage could be established in two basic ways. The normal way was that the woman would be given to a man by her kindred; the abnormal way was that the woman could elope with a man without the consent of her kindred. In this case her kindred could compel her to return if she was still a virgin, but if she was not she could not be compelled to return. If the relationship lasted for seven years she had the same entitlements as if she had been given by her kin.\n\nA number of payments are connected with marriage. \"Amobr\", or commutation-fee, was a fee payable to the woman's lord on the loss of her virginity, whether on marriage or otherwise. \"Cowyll\", or maiden-fee, was a payment due to the woman from her husband on the morning after the marriage, marking her transition from virgin to married woman. Dowry (\"agweddi\") was the amount of the common pool of property owned by the couple which was due to the woman if the couple separated before the end of seven years. The total of the agweddi depended on the woman's status by birth, regardless of the actual size of the common pool of property. If the marriage broke up after the end of 7 years, the woman was entitled to half the common pool. The portion that was immediately accessible during the marriage, consisting usually of linens, dishes, and other domestic items, was known as \"argyvrau\".\n\nIf a woman found her husband with another woman, she was entitled to a payment of six score pence (i.e. half a pound) the first time and a pound the second time; on the third occasion she was entitled to divorce him. If the husband had a concubine, the wife was allowed to strike her without having to pay any compensation, even if it resulted in the concubine's death. A woman could only be beaten by her husband for three things: for giving away something which she was not entitled to give away, for being found with another man, or for wishing a blemish on her husband's beard. If he beat her for any other cause, she was entitled to the payment of \"sarhad\". If the husband found her with another man and beat her, he was not entitled to any further compensation. According to the law, women were not allowed to inherit land. However, there were exceptions, even at an early date. A poem dated to the first half of the 11th century is an elegy for Aeddon, a landowner on Anglesey. The poet says that after his death his estate was inherited by four women who had originally been brought to Aeddon's court as captives after a raid and had found favour with him. The rule for the division of moveable property when one of a married couple died was the same for both sexes. The property was divided into two equal halves, with the surviving partner keeping one half and the dying partner being free to give bequests from the other half.\n\nMurder was regarded as an offence against the family rather than against society or the state. It was normally dealt with by the payment of blood money (\"galanas\") by the killer \"and\" his extended family to the family of the deceased. The base sum was computed by the social status and position of the victim. The \"galanas\" of the king of Deheubarth was set at an impossibly long line of impossibly perfect cattle to ensure it could never be met; the family of a murdered slave, meanwhile, received no \"galanas\", although the slave's owner was to be compensated for the loss. This sum might then be modified in certain situations (for example, an attack from ambush doubled the base fine). Upon the payment of the blood money, the victim's family was then legally bound to forgo its vengeance (\"dial\"). Murder by poison, however, carried the death penalty.\n\nAssault or offenses against honor were dealt with in a similar fashion, through a fine called \"sarhaed\". However, it only applied to the upper classes: any serf who struck a free man was to liable to have the offending limb removed.\n\nThe crime of rape was treated as a theft and remedied by the payment of another fine (\"dirwy\"), payment of which restored the woman's virginity for legal purposes. A man who could not pay the fine was to have his testicles removed.\n\nSimilarly, a convicted thief was imprisoned in the first instance, but a serf convicted for the third time was to have his hand removed. (Assuming he was not caught in the act: thieves caught with goods in hand more valuable than four \"ceiniogau\" were liable for hanging.) Such strong penalties led the Welsh to narrowly define \"theft\", however: forcible robbery was considered much less serious. Further, a hungry man who had passed at least three towns without receiving a meal could not be punished for stealing food.\n\nAiding and abetting including witnessing a killing and failing to protect the victim or receiving stolen property was also punished with \"dirwy\" fines.\n\nAlthough Hywel's commission generally recorded the traditions of the country, one modification they made was to end the right of nobles to trial by combat, finding it unjust.\n\nMedieval Welsh law placed a high value on compensation for any breach of the law. In particular, high and detailed compensation values\nwere given for each limb of the body. There are nine limbs of equal value (that is the hands, the eyes, the lips, the feet, and the nose) each of which is valued at 480 pennies, every other limb is carefully\nvalued and can be altered depending on various influencing factors.\n\nThe values given to eyes, ears, nose, lips, hands, and feet are identical; termed as the ‘Limbs of equal value’ they represent 12.7% of the standard \"galanas\" for a \"boneheddig\" (A \"boneheddig\" is a standard free-man, whose \"galanas\" is valued at 3780 pennies/ 63 cows). There are no additional complexities to any of these costs, except when it comes to ears. The Iorwerth manuscripts and LATIN A do not value the ear itself at 480 pennies, instead they differentiate between the loss of an ear and the loss of hearing. If the ear is lost but the victim can still hear, then the price lies at 160 pennies, whilst deafness (even without the loss of ear) retains the 480 penny value. This is a rare example of a ‘functional value\nbeing given where the loss of the function of the ear... is appreciated and not the organ itself’. Harris notes that although these members are all given equal value, it seems there is some underlying notion that some are perhaps more essential than others (at least in the Iorwerth and LATIN A texts) with hearing being more\nimportant than any of the other senses.\n\nFingers are valued at 80 pence each, whilst a thumb has a value of 180 pence which corresponds to its use in ‘gripping agricultural equipment or arms’. The Iorwerth and Cyfnerth 5 recensions value a finger nail at 30 pence, whilst the top of the finger to the first knuckle is valued (in the same texts) at 26 2/3 of a penny. The price of a fingernail as it is valued in Iorwerth and Cyfnerth is 0.8% of\nthe \"galanas\", and intriguingly the thumbnail in the Wessex tariff also stands at 0.8% of the \"wergild\" value for the man.[7] Harris argues that these similar percentages reflect the co-existence of two legal systems in Wales; the Welsh and the English.\n\nThe triad known as the \"Tri Arberygl Dyn\" (Three Dangerous wounds of man) specifies three injuries for which‘teyr punt a geyf y nep a archoller y gan y nep ay harchollo’ ‘He who is wounded shall have 3 pounds from him who wounds him’. These are; when a man is cut so that the brains can be seen, when a man is pierced so his entrails can be seen, and when one of the four posts of the body (the limbs) are broken.\n\nThe body parts appear to be classed for compensation based on how much use they have in society. The higher the use; the higher the compensation cost. Loss of hearing, for example, as well as loss of testes and/or penis incur very high redress rates, because their loss will cause either danger or an inability to continue lineage, which was highly important in such a kin-based society. The tongue is also particularly high because, as with the ear, it would have formed the primary means of communication for the victim.\n\nAlso notable are the different grades of compensation given to wounds depending on the degree of disfigurement produced by the wounding, with a differentiation between \"craith ogyfarch\"; a conspicuous scar which attracts remarks, and \"craith guiddiedig\"; a hidden scar which will therefore attract less remarks. The \"craith ogyfarch\" afforded the most compensation, but the value of the \"ogyfarch\" compensation varied according to its noticability. The three most conspicuous scars are given as those on a face (six score pence), on a hand (sixty pence), and on a foot (thirty pence), whilst a hidden scar is given only four pence. The Latin texts A and E ‘make provision for a cloak to cover facial disfigurement’ and front teeth were also accorded a higher value than other teeth.\n\nThe section on surety lays down the rules if a person acts as \"mach\" or surety, for example for a debt, and gives the provisions for various cases, such as where the debtor refuses to pay or denies the debt and where the surety denies the suretyship or contests the sum involved. Rules are also given for the giving and forfeiting of gages. Another aspect is \"amod\" or contract, usually made by the two parties calling \"amodwyr\" who are witnesses to prove the terms agreed by the parties. It is laid down that:\n\nIn what is thought to be an archaic survival in some versions of Iorwerth it is stated that women are not entitled to act as sureties or to give sureties. Later versions of this rule in Iorwerth state that women were entitled to give sureties, and could therefore enter into contracts, though they were still not allowed to act as sureties. In Colan, Cyfnerth and some of the Latin texts women could give sureties and could under certain circumstances act as sureties. This appears to indicate a gradual improvement in the legal position of women in this respect.\n\nThis is followed by land law, setting out the procedure in the event of rival ownership claims over land. Court was convened on the land itself, with both claimants calling witnesses to support their claims. In the Iorwerth Redaction, it is stated that the claimants were entitled to the representation by both types of lawyer - \"cyngaws\" and \"canllaw\". If both claims were deemed to have equal merit, the law allowed for the land to be shared equally between the two claimants.\n\nOn the death of a landowner (\"priodawr\") his immovable estate (land) passed in joint tenancy (\"cytir\") to his sons, similar to the gavelkind system of Kent. Then the youngest son partitioned (\"cyfran\") the land equally, and each brother took his share. Illegitimate sons were entitled to shares equal to those of legitimate sons, provided they had been acknowledged by the father. This provision differed the most from canon law; as the Iorwerth text puts it:\n\n\"Dadannudd\" is a son's claim to land which previously belonged to his father. A landowner's right to convey land was restricted; it was only allowed under certain circumstances with the consent of his kindred and coheirs (\"laudatio parentum\"). With the consent of the lord and the kindred, the landowner could use the living gage (\"prid\"). The land would be made over to a gagee (\"pridwr\") for a period of four years, and if the land had not been redeemed by the gagor (owner) or his heirs at the end of the four years, the gage could then be renewed for additional four-year periods. After three renewals (or 16 years total), the land passed permanently to the gagee.\n\nFrom the time of the fall of Rome, Wales was divided into numerous petty \"kingdoms\" (\"gwledydd\", \"peoples\") which were repeatedly unified and then redivided. It is frequently stated that Welsh law demanded the division of a kingdom between all the ruler's sons, but that is a misunderstanding of the inheritance law the crown itself was unitary but the king's \"lands\" (\"maertref\") were required to be divided among all of his acknowledged sons by whatever mother. This naturally weakened the position of the new king and that weakness, along with the long free and separate traditions of the various Welsh \"gwledydd\", then permitted disputes and civil wars among the family appanages. Further, by the time of Hywel, the kingdoms normally taken as independent Deheubarth, Powys, &c. were nominally subordinate to the elder line of the family in Gwynedd and bound to display that with annual gifts.\n\nThe confusion of the 11th century and the use of the Saxon loanword \"edling\" for the heir also seem to have clouded the issue. By law, the principal homestead (and presumably the realm) were to go to the king's eldest son, but this was subject to several important provisos:\n\nThe eldest son of a king who died before that was barred from direct inheritance but possessed the right to retake the throne himself on the attainment of majority. The number of princes rebelling just prior to their 30th year may even indicate that they were \"required\" to assert their rights at that point or lose them. If the eldest son were ineligible for whatever reason, his brothers, uncles, and first and second cousins were all considered legitimate substitutes. Likewise, even when the eldest son did inherit, other descendants of his great-grandfather were considered legitimate rulers and not usurpers if they were able to wrest control away from him.\n\nFinally, although our surviving editions of Hywel's law explicitly forbid inheritance by or through female members of the royal family, Hywel's line itself derived from lords of Man who had (allegedly) married into the dynasties of Gwynedd and Powys and there are numerous examples through the 11th century of kings asserting their legitimacy on account of royal mothers, despite surviving underage representatives of the male line of succession.\n\nThis is only a separate section in the Iorwerth Redaction; in the other versions the material is incorporated in the \"Laws of the country\" section. It is a compilation of the rules for dealing with the \"Three Columns of Law\", namely cases of homicide, theft and fire, and \"The Value of Wild and Tame\". There are also appendices dealing with joint ploughing and corn damage by stock.\n\n\"The value of wild and tame\" gives the values of various animals, for example:\n\nValues are also given for trees, equipment and parts of the human body. The value of a part of the body was fixed, thus a person causing the king to lose an eye would pay the same as if he had caused a villein to lose an eye. However he would also have to pay \"sarhad\", and this would be far greater for the king than for the villein.\n\nThe main administrative divisions of mediaeval Wales were the cantrefs, each of which was divided into several commotes. These were of particular importance in the administration of the law. Each cantref had its own court, which was an assembly of the \"\"uchelwyr\"\", the main landowners of the cantref. This would be presided over by the king if he happened to be present in the cantref, or if he was not present by his representative. Apart from the judges there would be a clerk, an usher and sometimes two professional pleaders. The cantref court dealt with crimes, the determination of boundaries and matters concerning inheritance. The commote court later took over most of the functions of the cantref court. The judges (Welsh \"ynad\") in Gwynedd were professionals, while in south Wales the professional judges worked together with the free landowners of the district, all of whom were entitled to act as judges.\n\nA person accused of a crime could deny the charge by denying it on oath and finding a certain number of persons prepared to go on oath that they believed his or her own oath, a system known as compurgation. The number of persons required to swear depended on the gravity of the alleged crime; for example denying a homicide could require 300 compurgators, while if a woman accused a man of rape, the man would have to find 50 men prepared to swear to his innocence. For lesser crimes a smaller number would be sufficient. Witnesses could also be called, including eyewitnesses of the crime (\"gwybyddiaid\"). A witness who has once been proved to have given false testimony on oath was barred from ever appearing as a witness again.\n\nThe task of the judge, having considered the case, was to determine what sort of proof was appropriate and which of the parties was to be required to produce proof, whether by the calling of witnesses, by compurgation or by pledges, then in the light of the proof to adjudicate on the case and impose the appropriate penalty in accordance with the law if a penalty was called for.\n\nAccording to the Iorwerth Redaction, a prospective judge had to be at least twenty-five years of age and his legal knowledge has to be approved by the Court Justice:\n\nIt was possible to appeal against a judge's decision, and the appellant could demand that the judge show the authority of a book for his judgment. The consequences for a judge could be serious if his judgement was reversed, involving a financial penalty equivalent to the value of his tongue as laid down in the values of the parts of the body. He would also be banned from acting as a judge in future.\n\nWelsh law usually applied in the Welsh Marches as well as the areas ruled by Welsh princes. In the event of a dispute, the first argument in the border regions might be about which law should apply. For example, when Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn was in dispute with Roger Mortimer about some lands, it was Gruffydd who wanted the case heard under English law and Mortimer who wanted Welsh law to apply. The matter went to the royal justices, who decided in 1281 that since the lands concerned lay in Wales, Welsh law should be used.\n\nWelsh law came to be a particularly important badge of nationhood in the 12th and 13th centuries, particularly during the struggle between Llywelyn the Last and King Edward I of England in the second half of the 13th century. Llywelyn stated:\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury, John Peckham when involved in negotiations with Llywelyn on behalf of King Edward in 1282 sent Llywelyn a letter in which he denounced Welsh law, stating that King Hywel must have been inspired by the devil. Peckham had presumably consulted the Peniarth 28 manuscript which was apparently held in the library at St. Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury at this time. One of the features to which the English church objected was the equal share of land given to illegitimate sons. Following Llywelyn's death the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284 introduced English criminal law into Wales: \"in thefts, larcenies, burnings, murders, manslaughters and manifest and notorious robberies — we will that they shall use the laws of England\". Nearly two hundred years after Welsh law ceased to be used for criminal cases, the poet Dafydd ab Edmwnd (fl. 1450–80) wrote an elegy for his friend, the harpist Siôn Eos, who had accidentally killed a man in a tavern brawl in Chirk. Siôn Eos was hanged, and Dafydd ab Edmwnd laments that he could not have been tried under the more humane Law of Hywel rather than \"the law of London\".\n\nWelsh law was still used for civil cases such as land inheritance, contracts, sureties and similar matters, though with changes, for example illegitimate sons could no longer claim part of the inheritance. The Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542 brought Wales entirely under English law; when the 1535 Act declares the intention \"utterly to extirpe alle and singular sinister usages and customs\" belonging to Wales, Welsh law was probably the main target.\n\nThe last recorded case to be heard under Welsh law was a case concerning land in Carmarthenshire in 1540, four years after the 1536 Act had stipulated that only English law was to be used in Wales. Even in the 17th century in some parts of Wales there were unofficial meetings where points of dispute were decided in the presence of arbiters using principles laid down in Welsh law.\n\nAntiquarian interest in the laws continued, and in 1730 a translation by William Wotton was published. In 1841 Aneurin Owen edited an edition of the laws entitled \"Ancient laws and institutions of Wales\", and was the first to identify the various Redactions, which he named the \"Gwentian Code\" (Cyfnerth), the \"Demetian Code\" (Blegywryd) and the \"Venedotian Code\" (Iorwerth). His edition was followed by a number of other studies in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nCarmarthenshire County Council has set up the Hywel Dda Centre in Whitland, with an interpretative centre and garden to commemorate the original council.\n\nContemporary Welsh Law is a term applied to the body of primary and secondary legislation generated by the National Assembly for Wales, according to devolved authority granted in the Government of Wales Act 2006. Each piece of Welsh legislation is known as an Act of the National Assembly for Wales. The first Assembly legislation to be officially proposed was called the NHS Redress (Wales) Measure 2008. These powers have been effective since May, 2007. It is the first time in almost 500 years that Wales has had its own laws, since Cyfraith Hywel was abolished and replaced by English law through the Laws in Wales Acts, passed between 1535 and 1542 by King Henry VIII of England.\n\nEllis Peters in her Cadfael cycle often uses the ancient Welsh laws. The novel called \"Monk's Hood\" mentions the \"Cyfraith Hywel\" (called Hywel Dda). A recognised son, born out of wedlock has an over-riding claim to his father's property. The manor is in Wales. His demand could be accepted because the manor, lying in Wales, is under Welsh law.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1870170", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1870170", "title": "Volunteers (Jefferson Airplane album)", "text": "Volunteers (Jefferson Airplane album)\n\nVolunteers is the fifth studio album by American psychedelic rock band Jefferson Airplane, released in 1969 as RCA Victor LSP-4238 and in quadrophonic sound in 1973 as RCA Quadradisc APD1-0320. The album was controversial because of its revolutionary and anti-war lyrics along with the use of profanity. The original album title was \"Volunteers of Amerika\", but it was shortened after objections from Volunteers of America.\n\n\"Volunteers\" was the group's first album recorded entirely in San Francisco, at Wally Heider's state-of-the-art 16-track studio. Guest musicians included Jerry Garcia on pedal steel guitar, veteran session pianist Nicky Hopkins, future Airplane drummer Joey Covington on percussion, David Crosby and Stephen Stills. The album was among the earliest 16-track recordings, and its back cover shows a picture of the Ampex MM-1000 professional 16-track tape recorder used to record the album.\n\nThe album was marked with strong anti-war and pro-anarchism songs. The theme of nature, communities and ecology was also explored with the songs \"The Farm\" and \"Eskimo Blue Day\". The title was inspired by a Volunteers of America (a religious charity similar to the Salvation Army) garbage truck that woke singer Marty Balin one morning. The original title was \"Volunteers of Amerika\"; spelling \"America\" as \"Amerika\" was a common practice used by leftists at the time to emphasize their dissatisfaction with the American government, as it usually references both German fascism and the Kafka novel \"Amerika\". After Volunteers of America objected, the title was shortened to \"Volunteers\".\n\nThe album provoked even more controversy with lyrics such as \"Up against the wall, motherfucker,\" which appeared in the opening song, \"We Can Be Together\". The offending word was mixed lower on the 45 RPM release of that track to partially obscure it, but it was still audible. However, the word \"motherfucker\" was censored on the album lyric sheet as \"fred\". RCA Records had refused to allow the word \"fuck\" on the album until confronted with the fact that the label had already set a precedent on the \"Hair\" cast recording album. \"Eskimo Blue Day\" was also a point of contention, with its chorus line of \"doesn't mean shit to a tree\" repeated throughout.\n\nThe album is characterized by Jorma Kaukonen's lead guitar parts (the dueling solos on \"Hey Fredrick\", plus the traditional gospel-blues song \"Good Shepherd\" and \"Wooden Ships\") and Hopkins' distinctive piano playing. It also featured the band experimenting with a country-rock sound, particularly on \"The Farm\" and \"Song for All Seasons\".\n\nDespite its controversies, the album was a commercial success. It peaked at #13 (becoming the band's fourth Top 20 record) on the \"Billboard\" album chart album chart and received a RIAA gold certification within two months of its release.\n\nThis was to be the last album with the group for both Jefferson Airplane founder Marty Balin and drummer Spencer Dryden (although they did both appear on the \"Mexico\" single released in 1970 and its B-side \"Have You Seen the Saucers?\") and thus signifies the end of the best-remembered \"classic\" lineup. It was to be the group's last all-new LP for two years; Jack Casady and Jorma Kaukonen would now devote more of their energy to their embryonic blues group Hot Tuna, while Paul Kantner and Grace Slick released \"Blows Against the Empire\" and \"Sunfighter\" with various guest musicians and celebrated the birth of their daughter China in 1971.\n\nThough the album was released in late 1969, the cover photo dates back to 1967; it features the band wearing disguises and was taken during the filming of a promotional film made for the \"Martha\" single.\n\nA specially remixed quadraphonic (four-channel) version of the album was released in 1973 as a vinyl disc using the discrete JVC/RCA CD-4/Quadradisc system, as well as in reel-to-reel and 8-track cartridge tape formats. The quadraphonic mixes are noticeably different from the usual stereo mixes; \"Hey Fredrick\" has a completely different lead vocal along with different guitar lines and coda, \"Volunteers\" is a totally different recording, Kaukonen's guitar lines are different on \"We Can Be Together\", \"Wooden Ships\" lacks the opening sailboat sound effects and the backing vocals by Ace of Cups on \"The Farm\" are more prominent. A few tracks from the quadraphonic version were included in the triple-CD box set \"Jefferson Airplane Loves You\", though the CD format's technical limitations necessitated reducing the four-channel recordings to two channels.\n\nThe 2004 CD re-release features five additional bonus tracks from the group's annual Thanksgiving concert at the Fillmore East, New York in 1969.\n\nIn 2003 the album was ranked number 370 in \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and at 373 in a 2012 revised list.\n\nThe album was released again in 2009, along with the entirety of the group's live performance at the Woodstock Festival in 1969, as \"Jefferson Airplane Woodstock Experience\".\n\nPer liner notes.\n\n\n\nAlbum\nSingle\n"}

The festival was first held on 1 – 15 May 1999, and the last festival took place on 22 April – 8 May 2011. The Festivals were organized by Boston Cyberarts Inc, a non-profit arts organization.\n\n, the director of Cyberarts is George Fifield, who was one of the original cofounders of the organization. Boston Cyberarts, Inc. continues to exist as a non-profit arts organization, but has redirected its energies to promoting the arts and technology year-round, rather than biennially. The most visible continuing effort is the Boston Cyberarts Gallery, which used to be the Axiom Center for New and Experimental Media. The gallery was and is located in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston, in the Green Street station building on the MBTA Orange Line rapid transit line.\n\nThe online presence of the past Boston Cyberarts Festivals, including online exhibits, is archived and still accessible free of charge.\n\nThe festival was located in Boston, Massachusetts. The festival usually featured a central headquarters where visitors could get information about the events and also attend the opening night party. Massachusetts had arguably the densest population of digital artists in the US, making Boston the high-technology cultural center of the country.

It is a neoclassical building which houses the Rhode Island General Assembly and the offices of the governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, and general treasurer of Rhode Island. The building is on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThis is Rhode Island's seventh state house and the second in Providence after the Old Rhode Island State House. The architectural firm of McKim, Mead, and White designed it, and it was constructed from 1895 to 1904. The building had a major renovation in the late 1990s. It served as the United States Capitol exterior in the 1997 film \"Amistad\". It also served as the City Hall of Capital City in Disney's \"Underdog\".\n\nThe Rhode Island State House is constructed of of white Georgia marble, 15 million bricks, and of iron floor beams. The dome is the fourth-largest self-supporting marble dome in the world, after St. Peter's Basilica, the Minnesota State Capitol, and the Taj Mahal. On top of the dome is a gold-covered bronze statue of the Independent Man, originally named \"Hope\". The statue weighs more than ; it is tall and stands above the ground. The Independent Man represents freedom and independence and alludes to the independent spirit which led Roger Williams to settle and establish Providence Plantations and later the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.\n\nThe chamber of the Rhode Island Senate is located in the east wing of the building, and the chamber of the Rhode Island House of Representatives is located in the west wing. Other notable rooms include the rotunda (beneath the dome), the State Library (north end), and the State Room (south end). The State Room is an entrance area for the office of the governor and contains a full-scale portrait of George Washington by Rhode Island native Gilbert Stuart. This room is also where the governor has press conferences and bill signings at the State House. It was one of the first public buildings to use electricity. It is lit by 109 floodlights and two searchlights at night.\n\nIn 2013, Governor Lincoln Chafee's administration started to remove grass from the eastern side of the Statehouse lawn in order to provide extra parking for employees. The move was opposed by the Capital Center Commission, the public board designated to oversee zoning requirements within the district. Supporters of the proposed parking say that there is demand from employees and visitors to the building. Opponents point to existing zoning requirements that make the surface lot illegal, point to the expense of providing parking, and advocate an increased presence for transit, biking, walking, and carpooling instead. The state spent $3.1 million on an adjoining piece of land on Francis Street next to I-95 for parking, which provides 100 parking spots at around $30,000 a space.\n\nIt is an annual State House tradition to feature a Christmas tree and community and cultural holiday displays each December. A Fraser fir or Balsam fir is erected in the rotunda and decorated. The tree, donated by a local family or tree farm, is typically between 17 and 25 feet tall. \n\nIt has become a holiday tradition in local media to feature stories about problems with Rhode Island's state tree, often meriting front page treatment:\n\n\nSince 2014, holiday displays from \"any Rhode Island area-based religious or secular group\" have been featured on the first and second floors. Participating groups have included local religious, ethnic, and secular organizations.\n\n\n"}

It is located between the towns of Birkirkara and Ħamrun, and it also borders Qormi and Msida.\n\nThe Old Church of Santa Venera was built in 1473, and it was enlarged in 1500, rebuilt between 1658 and 1688 and again in the 19th century. This church remained as the parish church until 1989. A new church was blessed in 2005.\nIn 1610, Grandmaster Alof de Wignacourt financed the building of the Wignacourt Aqueduct to transport water from springs in Rabat and Dingli to the capital Valletta, passing through various towns along the way including Santa Venera. The Aqueduct was finished in 1615, and an ornamental gateway was built where it crossed the road between what is now Fleur-de-Lys and Santa Venera. The arches stopped at a tower known as \"it-Turretta\" (the Turret) also known as \"Tower Guard\", also in Santa Venera. From this tower, water continued its journey to Ħamrun, Blata l-Bajda, Floriana and Valletta through underground pipes.\n\nCasa Leoni, also known as Palazzo Manoel, was built around 1730 during the reign of António Manoel de Vilhena. Its design is attributed to Charles François de Mondion, the French military engineer who also designed Mdina Gate and parts of Fort Manoel. During the French blockade, Casa Leoni served as a Maltese insurgent command base, and it later served as a residence of Governors of Malta, a depository of the Museums Department and a government primary school. It now houses the Ministry for Sustainable Development, the Environment and Climate Change. The palace has a large garden behind it, part of which was opened to the public in 1977 as Romeo Romano Gardens.\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the town of Santa Venera saw more development and various churches and institutes were built. The town was considered as part of Birkirkara until 1912, and it became a separate parish six years later in 1918.\n\nA 7 Up factory was located at Santa Venera until it was closed in 2002. The factory was demolished to make way for flats but the façades of the buildings were retained.\n\nIn 1990, a large church began to be built in Santa Venera. Although it is still unfinished as the belfries have not yet been built, it was consecrated in 2005 as the new parish church.\n\nThe flag and coat of arms of Santa Venera are red with a white stripe in the middle and three red fleur-de-lys on the stripe, taken from the coat of arms of the Grandmaster Alof de Wignacourt who ruled the islands from 1601 to 1622. The flag was introduced when Malta's local councils were created in 1993.\n\nSanta Venera has a number of educational institutions which include the following:\n\n\n\n\nThis is an award given every year to personalities who have left a mark in the locality of Santa Venera. In 2016, the award was given to ALS Malta founder, Bjorn Formosa M.Q.R. Previous winners include Mario Coleiro and Mario Calleja.\n\nSanta Venera is twinned with:\n"}

It is one of four objects (besides paper documents) still existing that were present during the Constitutional Convention, along with Independence Hall itself, the Liberty Bell, and the chair that George Washington sat in as the Constitutional Convention's presiding officer.\n\nThe inkstand was made by Philip Syng in 1752 for the provincial assembly of Pennsylvania. It is both a work of art and an important historical artifact, as it was used by such prominent Founding Fathers of the United States as Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, John Hancock, Alexander Hamilton, John Adams, James Madison, and the other signers of the founding documents.\n\nDesktop inkstands hold ink for quill pens and other tools that require ink. Ornate versions include a pen holder, an inkpot, a candle to melt sealing wax, and a pot similar to a salt or pepper shaker used to pour pounce to aid in the sizing of parchment or vellum. The Syng inkstand is decorated in late Rococo style and includes a pounce pot, quill holder, and inkpot (left to right in the image shown).\n\nSyng immigrated to America from Ireland in 1713. He was a renowned silversmith who created fine works in silver and gold for the wealthy families of Philadelphia. He was an associate of Benjamin Franklin and a prominent member of the Philadelphia community who assisted in founding the Library Company of Philadelphia, the American Philosophical Society, the Union Fire Company, and the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Syng inkstand became the property of the State of Pennsylvania and was moved to the state capital in Harrisburg soon after the Constitutional Convention ended. It was returned to the City of Philadelphia in 1876, on the centennial of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, where it became famous. It was displayed in Independence Hall on a desk in front of George Washington's chair. Cracks appeared in the plaster ceiling of Independence Hall in 1922 and stoked fears that the building would collapse, and the inkstand was considered such an important artifact that it was removed at the same time that the first floor was cleared of visitors.\n\nThe National Park Service acquired the inkstand when it took over maintenance of Independence Hall from the City of Philadelphia. It is now on display in a special case in Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia, along with copies of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.\n\n"}
{"id": "1870198", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1870198", "title": "Dailies", "text": "Dailies\n\nIn filmmaking, dailies are the raw, unedited footage shot during the making of a motion picture. They are thus referred to because usually at the end of each day, its footage is developed, synced to sound, and printed on film in a batch (or telecined onto video tape or disk) for viewing the next day by the director, for selected actors and film crew members. Dailies serve as an indication of how the filming and the actors' performances are progressing. \n\nAnother way to describe film dailies is \"the first positive prints made by the laboratory from the negative photographed on the previous\nday\".\n\nIn some regions such as the UK, India and Canada, dailies are usually referred to as rushes or daily rushes, referring to the speed at which the prints are developed. In animation, dailies are also called rushes or sweat box sessions.\n\nFilm dailies can refer to the viewing of dailies on film in a theater.\n\nDailies are usually viewed by members of the film crew either early in the morning before filming starts, during the lunch break, or in the evening after filming ends. It is common for several members of the film crew including the director, cinematographer, editor and others to view and discuss the dailies as a group, but some productions opt to distribute multiple copies of the dailies for individual viewing (e.g., on DVD).\n\nViewing dailies allows the film crew to see exactly what images and audio were captured the previous day, in order to detect such technical problems as dirty, scratched, or out-of-focus film. It also presents opportunity for the director to evaluate the actor performances, toward avoidance of later schedule conflicts, and to confirm having captured a scene from an adequate assortment of camera angles. If additional filming seems expedient, the timely availability of the video is likely to avoid duplication of setup costs, and reduce later actor-scheduling conflicts.\n\nDailies are also often viewed separately by producers, and by studio executives not engaged, day-by-day, in production and must have other assurances that it meets their respective expectations as investors. Commonly, dailies sequences are repetitious, often including multiple takes of the same shot.\n\nFilm directors and film producers prefer to view dailies on film, rather than on DVD dailies. However, because of the costs involved, some productions will start by viewing film dailies and later switch to DVD dailies. One reason why film dailies are preferred over DVD dailies, is that it is much easier to check for correct focus, when using film (rather than video) dailies. HD dailies can have resolution as high as 2k (e.g. 2048 x 858, with 2.39:1 aspect ratio).\n\nIn the production of low-budget films with few crew and a short and uninterrupted shooting period, there may be no time available for viewing of dailies.\n\nMany films have one main film unit which does all primary filming and one or more smaller film units shooting additional \"pickup\" shots, stunts, or shots involving special effects. These shots are included with the main unit footage on the dailies reels. A typical pickup shot might be a simple shot of the exterior of a building which does not involve any actors, and is filmed with a smaller crew to save time and money.\n\nIf a unit shoots with more than one camera usually all the shots from one \"A\" camera will be followed by all \"B\" camera shots because of the way the dailies are processed.\n\nTo save time, ordinarily only a small amount of the previous day's footage is viewed. If viewing dailies on video, often all the footage is transferred and the viewer can fast-forward as desired. Dailies on print film are more expensive to produce and cannot be easily fast-forwarded. In this case, during shooting the director will specify which takes he or she wants converted to dailies. When a take is completed, the director yells, \"Cut\" and if the director wants the take converted to dailies, the director will also yell, \"Print\". Once the director yells, \"Cut! Print!\", the script supervisor, the camera assistant and the sound person circle the take number on their log sheets so that only these circle takes will be printed that night by the film laboratory.\n\nThe end of a dailies reel may contain sound that was recorded without simultaneous picture recording called wild sound.\n\nVisual effects shots are often assembled daily for viewing by a visual effects or animation supervisor. They will contain the previous day's work by animators and effects artists in various state of completion. Once a shot is at the point where additional feedback from the director is needed they will be assembled and screened for the director either as part of the normal dailies screening or as a separate weekly VFX dailies screening.\n\nDailies delivered to the editing department will usually have timecode and keycode numbers overlaid on the image. These numbers are used to later assemble the original high-quality film and audio to conform to the edit. Depending on how the dailies are produced, these numbers may only be on the editor's copy of the dailies or on all copies of the dailies.\n\nDuring the typical filming of a motion picture, a movie camera captures the image on 35 mm film and a separate audio recorder (such as a Nagra tape recorder or digital hard disk recorder) records the sound on-set.\n\nThe film negative is developed and printed or telecined so that the images can be viewed on a projector or video monitor.\n\nThe sound is synched to the film using a clapperboard as a reference. The clapperboard is labeled to identify the scene, shot, and take number for the camera. The numbers are also read aloud to label the audio recording. Once camera and sound are rolling, a camera assistant will close the clapper creating a visual and auditory reference point. During the synching process after the film has been developed, the technician will look at the numbers on the slate board and then match the numbers with the verbal slate. Then the technician looks for the frame where the clapper first closes and for the beep or clapping sound on the audio tape, adjusting one or the other until they happen simultaneously when played back. This needs to be done for every take. Systems exist which record synchronized timecode onto the film and audio tape at the time of shooting, allowing for automatic alignment of picture and audio. In practice these systems are rarely used.\n\nBefore computer-based editing tools became widely available in the late 1980s, all feature-film dailies were printed on film. These pieces of film are called the workprint. After viewing, the workprint is used by the film editor to edit the movie using a flatbed editor. Once the workprint is edited and approved, the negative is assembled so it is identical to the edited workprint.\n\nToday, most editing is done on computer based non-linear editing systems which use a video copy of the dailies. When the film is telecined, keycode numbers are logged which assign a number to each frame of film and are later used to assemble the original film to conform to the edit.\n\nWhen using a video camera or digital motion picture camera, the image and sound are often recorded simultaneously to video tape or hard disk in a format that can be immediately viewed on a monitor, eliminating the need to undergo a conversion process to create dailies for viewing. The footage recorded each day will still usually go through a daily process to create a second copy for protection and create multiple copies on DVD or other media for viewing by producers or other people not on set.\n\nOutside of their use in producing a motion picture, dailies are desirable by fans as a collectors item and to see more of the filmmaking process. They are also desirable to film students and teachers to illustrate how a film is shot and as a tool to practice editing.\n\nFor a variety of reasons, major motion picture studios never release their dailies for outside use. One cited problem is that the Screen Actors Guild has a clause in their contract to protect their actors' privacy which says that the producers of all union productions must give up their rights to the actor's performance for anything but the edited movie. In most other English speaking countries, the actors unions have similar contracts which limit the distribution of all film dailies. New Zealand does not have this limitation, which is why the dailies from and are on the DVDs for these shows.\n\nEvery year American Cinema Editors holds the ACE Film Editing Contest in which they make dailies available to 50 film students for an editing contest. ACE also sells a video tape with film dailies from the 1950s TV show \"Gunsmoke\". These film dailies have been used by many film schools for the last 40 years.\n\nRushes and dailies are also used to create trailers, even if they may contain footage that is not in the final movie, or the trailer editor and the film editor may use different takes of a particular shot.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1870203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1870203", "title": "Production company", "text": "Production company\n\nA production company, production house, production studio, or a production team is a business that provides the physical basis for works in the fields of performing arts, new media art, film, television, radio, comics, interactive arts, video games, websites, and video. Production teams consisting of technical staff produce the media. Generally the term refers to all individuals responsible for the technical aspects of creating a particular product, regardless of where in the process their expertise is required, or how long they are involved in the project. For example, in a theatrical performance, the production team includes not only the running crew, but also the theatrical producer, designers and theatre direction.\n\nThe production company may be directly responsible for fundraising the production or may accomplish this through a parent company, partner, or private investor. It handles budgeting, scheduling, scripting, the supply with talent and resources, the organization of staff, the production itself, post-production, distribution, and marketing.\n\nProduction companies are often either owned or under contract with a media conglomerate, film studio, entertainment company, or Motion Picture Company, who act as the \"production company\"'s partner or parent company. This has become known as the \"studio system\". Independent studios usually prefer \"production house\" (see Lionsgate), and sometimes as a \"production studio\" or \"production team\" (see Amazon Studios or Rooster Teeth). In the case of television, a production company would serve under a television network. Production companies can work together in co-productions. In music, the term production team typically refers to a group of individuals filling the role of \"record producer\" usually reserved for one individual. Some examples of musical production teams include Matmos and D-Influence\n\nEntertainment companies operate as mini conglomerates, operating many divisions or subsidiaries in many different industries. Warner Bros. Entertainment and Lionsgate Entertainment are two companies with this corporate structure. It allows for a single company to maintain control over seemingly unrelated companies that fall within the ranges of entertainment, which increases and centralises the revenue into one company (example: a film production company, TV production company, video game company, and comic book company are all owned by a single entertainment company). A motion picture company, such as Paramount Pictures, specializing \"only\" in motion pictures is only connected with its other counterpart industries through its parent company. Instead of performing a corporate reorganization, many motion picture companies often have sister companies they collaborate with in other industries that are subsidiaries owned by their parent company and is often not involved in the making of products that are not motion picture related. A film production company can either operate as an affiliate (under a contract) or as a subsidiary for an entertainment company, motion picture company, television network, or all, and are generally smaller than the company they are partnered with.\n\nA book to film unit is a unit of a book publishing company for the purposes of getting books that they published adapted into film.\n\nFilms have been using books as a prime source for films for years. In 2012, six out of the nine best picture Oscar nominees were originally books. Previously, publishers did not develop their books into movie nor receive any of the profits. Neither Scholastic or Little Brown, get any box office revenue from the Harry Potter and Twilight movies just through book sales. As the publishers faced decreasing revenue due to increased competition from self-published e-books, or Amazon.com moving into the publishing field, publishers have started to enter the film and TV production business to boost their net income with Amazon attempting to compete there too. More screenwriters are turning to book publishers to get their screenplay published as a book, so as to have a boost in their attempt to have the screenplay turned into a movie, given that it is a known product after the book.\n\nPublisher Simon & Schuster has been owned by media companies lately by ViacomCBS while the publisher is not involved with film and TV, S&S shares with CBS for possible film or TV deals. Alloy Entertainment while not a unit of a publisher started using a book packaging to film model of film and TV development by developing the property in-house, hire authors for the books and films, so as to own the property. Random House was the first big six book publisher to establish a book to film unit, Random House Films, in 2005 with a Focus Features deal under a development and co-finance plan.\n\nMacmillan Films was launched by Thomas Dunne Books in October 2010 under the packaging model similar to Alloy while also moving to get film rights from Dunne's published author. Also that year, Random House changed their strategy to film development and packaging only.\n\nCondé Nast Entertainment was started by Magazine publisher Conde Nast in October 2012. In 2013, Macmillan Films became Macmillan Entertainment with an expansion to look at other divisions' book for possible films.\n\nA production company is usually run by a producer or director, but can also be run by a career executive. In entertainment, a production company relies highly on talent or a well known entertainment franchise to raise the value of an entertainment project and draw out larger audiences. This gives the entertainment industry a democratized power structure to ensure that both the companies and talent receive their fair share of pay and recognition for work done on a production.\n\nThe entertainment industry is centered on funding (investments from studios, investment firms, or individuals either from earnings from previous productions or personal wealth), projects (scripts and entertainment franchises), and talent (actors, directors, screenwriters, and crew). Production companies are judged and ranked based on the amount of funding it has, as well the productions it has completed or been involved with in the past. If a production company has major funding either through earnings, studio investors, or private investors, and has done or been involved with big budget productions in the past, it is considered to be a major production company. These companies often work with well-known and expensive talent. If a production company does not have much funding and has not done or been involved with any big budget productions, it is considered to be a small production company. These companies often work with up and coming talent.\n\nSmall production companies will either grow to become a major production company, a subsidiary completely owned by another company, remain small, or fail. The success of an entertainment production company is centered on the projects it produces, the talent it can acquire, and the performance of the talent. Marketing is also a major factor. All films, as a tradition, are often marketed around the image and the performance of the actors; with an option of marketing the behind the scenes crew such as the directors and screenwriters. Unlike many other businesses, a production company does not rely on an ongoing revenue stream, they operate on ongoing investments; this often requires a parent company or a private corporate investment entity (see Legendary Pictures). Their only source of profit comes from the productions they produce. Because entertainment and media are currently in \"high demand\", a production company can profit if its management is capable of using its resources to supply good quality products and services to the public. Many entertainment production companies brand their entertainment projects. An entertainment project can either become a \"one time hit\" or an ongoing \"entertainment franchise\" that can be continued, remade, rebooted, or expanded into other sister industries; such as the video game industry (see \"Star Wars\", \"Star Trek\"). Entertainment projects can be either an original or an adaptation from another industry.\n\nIn rare occasional cases, a few troubled major studios would also shed their distribution and/or marketing staffs, mainly due to reduced resources, and resort to co-investing and/or co-distributing film projects with larger studios, operating as virtual, production-only movie studios. Notable examples include legendary studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which, after many years of box office flops (mostly with low budgets), bad management and distribution, and bankruptcy, was restructured at the end of 2010 under new management and currently struck deals with some of the Big Six studios (most notably the Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group and Warner Bros.); Miramax, which was downsized by former owner Disney into a smaller division after the Weinstein brothers' 2005 divestment and, after 17 years under Disney ownership, was sold to a group of investors at the end of 2010 who eventually struck deals to co-finance the studio's projects with other independent companies; and DreamWorks Pictures, the independently run live action studio, which currently releases many projects through Universal Pictures and formerly released their projects through Disney after spinning off from Paramount Pictures (which purchased the studio in 2006 and stripped it of its independent distributor status) in 2008.\n\nBecause a production company is only operational when a production is being produced and most of the talent and crew are freelancers, many production companies are only required to hire management staff that helps to oversee the company's daily activities. In some cases, a production company can be run by only a handful of people. The company's funds are mainly committed towards employing talent, crew, and acquiring new updated production equipment on a regular basis. Many productions often require at least one to two cameras and lighting equipment for on location shooting. Production equipment is either leased or purchased from another production company or directly from the manufacturer. In the entertainment industry, in order to secure experienced professional talent and crew, production companies often become a signatory company to that talent or crew members \"guild\". By becoming a signatory company, it agrees to abide by the guild regulations. All big budget guild productions are exclusive to guild members and non guild members are not allowed to participate in these productions unless authorized by the guild. Productions with smaller budgets are allowed to use both guild talent and talent from the public. The majority of the talent and crew working in the entertainment industry are members of their professions guild. Most productions in the entertainment industry are guild productions.\n\nA production company is responsible for the development and filming of a specific production or media broadcast. In entertainment, the production process begins with the development of a specific project. Once a final script has been produced by the screenwriters, the production enters into the pre-production phase, most productions never reach this phase for financing or talent reasons. In pre-production, the actors are signed on and prepared for their roles, crew is signed on, shooting locations are found, sets are built or acquired, and the proper shooting permits are acquired for on location shooting. Actors and crew are hand picked by the producer, director, and casting director, who often use collaborators or referenced personnel to prevent untrusted or unwelcomed people from gaining access to a specific production and compromising the entire production through leaks. Once a production enters into principal photography, it begins filming. Productions are almost never cancelled once they reach this phase. Codenames are often used on bigger productions during filming to conceal the production's shooting locations for both privacy and safety reasons. In many cases, the director, producers, and the leading actors are often the only people with access to a full or majority of a single script. Supporting actors, background actors, and crew often never receive a full copy of a specific script to prevent leaks. Productions are often shot in secured studios, with limited to no public access, but they are also shot on location on secured sets or locations. Due to the exposure, when shooting in public locations, major productions often employ security to ensure the protection of the talent and crew working on a specific production. After filming is completed, the production enters into post production, which is handled by a post production company and overseen by the production company. The editing, musical score, visual effects, re-recording of the dialog, and sound effects are \"mixed\" to create the final film, which is then screened at the final screening. Marketing is also launched during this phase, such as the release of trailers and posters. Once a final film has been approved, the film is taken over by the distributors, who then release the film.\n\nFor legal reasons, it is common within the entertainment industry for production companies not to accept unsolicited materials from any other company, talent, or the general public. It is also common for filmmakers or producers to become entrepreneurs and open their own production companies so that they can have more control over their careers and pay, while acting as an \"in-house\" creative and business driving force for their company but continuing to freelance as an artist for other companies, if desired.\n\n"}

{"id": "1870213", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1870213", "title": "Film distributor", "text": "Film distributor\n\nA film distributor is responsible for the marketing of a film. The distribution company is usually different from the production company. Distribution deals are an important part of financing a film.\n\nThe distributor may set the release date of a film and the method by which a film is to be exhibited or made available for viewing; for example, directly to the public either theatrically or for home viewing (DVD, video-on-demand, download, television programs through broadcast syndication etc.). A distributor may do this directly, if the distributor owns the theaters or film distribution networks, or through theatrical exhibitors and other sub-distributors. A limited distributor may deal only with particular products, such as DVDs or Blu-ray, or may act in a particular country or market. The primary distributor will often receive credit in the film's credits, one sheet or other marketing material.\n\nIf a distributor is working with a theatrical exhibitor, the distributor secures a written contract stipulating the amount of the gross ticket sales the exhibitor will be allowed to retain (usually a percentage of the gross). The distributor collects the amount due, audits the exhibitor's ticket sales as necessary to ensure the gross reported by the exhibitor is accurate, secures the distributor's share of these proceeds, surrenders the exhibitor's portion to it, and transmits the remainder to the production company (or to any other [intermediary], such as a film release agent).\n\nThe distributor must also ensure that enough film prints are struck to service all contracted exhibitors on the contract-based opening day, ensure their physical delivery to the theater by the opening day, monitor exhibitors to make sure the film is in fact shown in the particular theatre with the minimum number of seats and show times, and ensure the prints' return to the distributor's office or other storage resource also on the contract-based return date. In practical terms, this includes the physical production of release prints and their shipping around the world (a process that is being replaced by digital distribution in most developed markets) as well as the creation of posters, newspaper and magazine advertisements, television commercials, trailers, and other types of ads.\n\nThe distributor is also responsible for ensuring a full line of advertising material is available for each film which it believes will help the exhibitor attract the largest possible audience, create such advertising if it is not provided by the production company, and arrange for the physical delivery of the advertising items selected by the exhibitor at intervals prior to the opening day. Film distributors spend between $3.5 billion and $4.0 billion a year in the United States alone on direct buys of advertising such as TV commercials, billboards, online banner ads, radio commercials and the like. That distributor-spending figure doesn't include additional costs for publicity, film trailers and promotions, which aren't classified as advertising but also market films to audiences.\n\nDistributors typically enter into one of the two types of film booking contracts. The most common is the aggregate deal where total box office revenue that a given film generates is split by a pre-determined mutually-agreed percentage between distributor and movie theater. The other method is the sliding scale deal, where the percentage of box office revenue taken by theaters declines each week of a given film's run. The sliding scale actually has two pieces that starts with a minimum amount of money that theater is to keep—often called \"the house nut\"—after which the sliding scale kicks in for revenue generated above the house nut. However, this sliding scale method is falling out of use. Whatever the method, box office revenue is usually shared roughly 50/50 between film distributors and theaters.\n\nIf the distributor is handling an imported or foreign film, it may also be responsible for securing dubbing or subtitling for the film, and securing censorship or other legal or organizational \"approval\" for the exhibition of the film in the country/territory in which it does business, prior to approaching the exhibitors for booking. Depending on which studio that is distributing the film, the studio will either have offices around the world, by themselves or partnered with another studio, to distribute films in other countries. If a studio decides to partner with a native distributor, upon release both names will appear. The foreign distributor may license the film for a certain amount of time, but the studio will retain the copyright of the film.\nWhen a film is produced and distributed by an independent production company and independent distributor (meaning outside the studios), generally an international sales agent handles the licensing of international rights to the film. The international sales agent will find a local distributor in each individual international territory and license the exclusive rights to the film for a certain amount of time but in the same case as the studios described above, the production company will retain the copyright of the film. This means that this distributor in a certain territory has the exclusive right to exploit the film in various media (theatrical, TV, home entertainment, etc.) for a certain amount of time.\n\nAlthough there are now numerous distribution techniques, in the past the studios and networks were slow to change and did not experiment with different distribution processes. Studios believed that new distribution methods would cause their old methods of revenue to be destroyed. With time, the development of new distribution did prove to be beneficial. The studios revenue was gained from myriad distribution windows. These windows created many opportunities in the industry and allowed networks to make a profit and eliminate failure. These new distribution methods benefited audiences that were normally too small to reach and expanded the content of television. With the new age of technology, networks accepted the fact that it was a consumer demand industry and accepted the new models of distribution.\n\nThis term, used mainly in the British film industry, describes the distribution of feature films for screening to a gathered audience, but not in theatres at which individual tickets are sold to members of the public. The defining distinctions between a theatrical and a non-theatrical screening are that the latter has to be to a closed audience in some way, e.g. pupils of a school, members of a social club or passengers on an airline, and that there can be no individual admission charge. Most non-theatrical screening contracts also specify that the screening must not be advertised, except within the group that is eligible to attend (e.g. in a membership organisation's newsletter or an in-flight magazine).\n\nNon-theatrical distribution includes the airlines and film societies. Non-theatrical distribution is generally handled by companies that specialize in this market, of which Motion Picture Licensing Company (MPLC) and Film bank media are the two largest:\n\nMotion Picture Licensing Company\nFilm bank media\n\nRepresenting the major Hollywood studios and independent producers. Home video media is sold with a licence that permits viewing in the home only. Until these technologies were widespread, most non-theatrical screenings were on 16 mm film prints supplied by the distributor. Today, the most common business model is for a distributor to sell the exhibitor a licence that permits the legal projection of a copy of the film, which the exhibitor buys separately on a home video format. These licences can either be for individual, one-off screenings, or cover an unlimited number of screenings of titles represented by that distributor for a specified time period. The latter are often purchased by pubs and students' unions, to enable them to show occasional feature films on a TV in their bars.\n\nSome distributors only handle home video distribution or some sub-set of home video distribution such as DVD or Blu-ray distribution. The remaining home video rights may be licensed by the producer to other distributors or the distributor may sub-license them to other distributors.\n\nIf a distributor is going to distribute a movie on a physical format such as DVD, they must arrange for the creation of the artwork for the case and the face of the DVD and arrange with a DVD replicator to create a glass master to press quantities of the DVD.\n\nSome movie producers use a process called \"DVD-on-demand.\" In DVD-on-demand, a company will burn a DVD-R (a process called \"duplication\") when a copy of the DVD is ordered, and then ship it to the customer.\n\nA distributor may also maintain contact with wholesalers who sell and ship DVDs to retail outlets as well as online stores, and arrange for them to carry the DVD. The distributor may also place ads in magazines and online and send copies of the DVD to reviewers.\n\nThe primary distribution companies will usually receive some billing for the film. For example, \"Gone With the Wind\" was shown on the one sheet as \"A Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Release\". A modern example, \"Jurassic Park\", would be the credit \"Universal Pictures presents …\". The Universal production logo also opened the film's trailer. In some cases, there is split distribution as in the case of \"Titanic\" (1997): \"20th Century Fox and Paramount Pictures present …\". Both companies helped to finance the film.\n\n"}

{"id": "1870228", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1870228", "title": "Fast of the Firstborn", "text": "Fast of the Firstborn\n\nFast of the Firstborn (, \"Ta'anit B'khorot\" or , \"Ta'anit B'khorim\"); is a unique fast day in Judaism which usually falls on the day before Passover (i.e., the fourteenth day of Nisan, a month in the Jewish calendar; Passover begins on the fifteenth of Nisan). Usually, the fast is broken at a siyum celebration (typically made at the conclusion of the morning services), which, according to prevailing custom, creates an atmosphere of rejoicing that overrides the requirement to continue the fast (see \"Breaking the fast\" below). Unlike all other Jewish fast days, only firstborn children are required to fast on the Fast of the Firstborn.\n\nThis fast commemorates the salvation of the Israelite firstborns during the Plague of the Firstborn (according to the Book of Exodus, the tenth of the ten plagues wrought upon Ancient Egypt prior to the Exodus of the Children of Israel), when, according to Exodus (12:29): \"\"...God struck every firstborn in the Land of Mitzrayim (Ancient Egypt)...\"\"\n\nThe primary source quoted for this custom is Tractate \"Soferim\" 21:3, where it is stated that firstborns fast \"in commemoration of the miracle that they were saved from the Plague of the Firstborn.\" Rabbeinu Asher and Rabbeinu Aharon HaKohein quote the Jerusalem Talmud as an additional source for the fast.\n\nRabbi Yehuda Grunwald (Rabbi of Satmar and student of the Ketav Sofer) suggests that the firstborn Israelites fasted in trepidation in advance of the Plague of the Firstborn; despite a divine guarantee of safety, they felt a need to fast in repentance to achieve greater divine protection. Rabbi Grunwald thus posits that this was the precedent for the Fast of the Firstborn.\n\nFasts in Judaism can have a number of purposes, including atonement for sins; commemorative mourning, and commemorative gratitude (see Ta'anit). \n\nThe Fast of the Firstborn incorporates commemorative gratitude for salvation from the Plague of the Firstborn, as detailed above.\n\nAccording to Rabbi Jacob Emden, the Fast of the Firstborn also commemorates the salvation of the Jews from the plot of Haman. This is because Haman advanced his plot on the thirteenth of Nisan, and Queen Esther reacted by instructing all Jews of Shushan to undertake a three-day fast beginning the next day, the fourteenth of Nisan. For this reason, even some non-firstborns maintain the custom to fast on the fourteenth of Nisan.\n\nAccording to Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach, the Fast of the Firstborn also includes an aspect of mourning: firstborns fast to mourn the loss of their priestly status which had initially been granted them on the fourteenth of Nisan. Furthermore, during the Temple period, this loss was most profoundly felt on the fourteenth of Nisan, which was the busiest day of the year for the Temple priests and Levites.\n\nThere is disagreement among the early halakhic authorities (authoritative scholars of Jewish law) as to who qualifies as a firstborn (Bechor) for purposes of the Fast of the Firstborn. All authorities agree, however, to the conditions of halakhic adulthood (generally speaking, this is 12 years for a female and 13 years for a male) and sanity, preconditions for all positive \"mitzvot\", to obligate one to fast. (Other rare conditions, such as deaf-muteness, also exempt one from positive \"mitzvot\").\n\nAccording to the \"Bayit Chadash\", the \"Sefer Agudah\", and arguably the \"Maharil\", both men and women are obligated to fast. This is based upon the Midrash, which states that both men and women among the firstborn Egyptians perished in the plague. Following a precedent common in Jewish commemorative rituals, the above authorities ruled that all those who were miraculously saved should participate in commemoration (see also \"Pesachim\" 108b). Since both men and women died from the plague, all firstborn Jewish men and women alive at that time are considered to have been miraculously saved. The \"Rema\" and the Vilna Gaon rule that women are exempt from the fast. As the Book of Exodus (13:12–15) mentions the biblical commandment of Redemption of the Firstborn as commemorative of the salvation of Jewish firstborns in Egypt, and as this command only applies to firstborn males, the \"Rema\" and the Vilna Gaon rule similarly that only males are obligated to fast. Common practice is that only males fast.\n\nWhile a firstborn to both parents, or a firstborn to only the mother, must fast according to all authorities, there is a dispute among the early halakhic authorities regarding the status of a firstborn to only the father. The \"Shulchan Aruch codifies that a firstborn to only the father is obligated to fast, while most printings of the \"Arba'ah Turim\" indicate that such a person would be exempt. Common practice follows the \"Shulchan Aruch\".\n\nTypically, if the oldest in the family died, the next oldest is not required to fast. However, if the oldest child had died within 30 days of birth, the next oldest is required to fast. (The \"Dagul Mervavah\" maintains that this only applies if the oldest child had been born prematurely or was not born viable).\n\nMany authorities, including the \"Rema\", note the custom that the father of a firstborn should fast on his child's behalf until the child reaches halakhic adulthood. The Rema rules that if the father is a firstborn himself, the mother should fast on behalf of the child. The \"Mateh Moshe\" and \"Maharil\" dispute this and rule in such a scenario that the mother need not fast. The \"Magen Avraham\" rules that it is appropriate to follow the lenient opinion if fasting causes the mother excessive discomfort or if she is pregnant or nursing, but he adds that a mother who begins following the former opinion must maintain that custom and fast in subsequent years.\n\nThe \"Sh'vut Ya'akov\" (1:17) rules that the above-cited custom of the father fasting for the child goes into effect as soon as the child is born, except where the child is born after \"chatzot ha'laila\" (\"halakhic\" midnight, which generally corresponds to solar midnight) on the 14th of Nisan of that year. (Since the child had not yet been born by the equivalent time that the Plague of the Firstborn had occurred in Egypt, the father need not fast for his child until the following year) The \"Korban N'tan'el\" disagrees. He writes that the custom only goes into effect from the time the child is 30 days old. This relates, again, to the command to redeem the firstborn, which does not go into effect until the child is 30 days old.\n\nThere is some discussion among the \"poskim\" (halakhic authorities) regarding whether a firstborn born through caesarean section is required to observe this fast, given that he is not obligated in the Redemption of the Firstborn. The \"Chok Ya'akov\" (470:2) suggests that such a firstborn may be required to fast, while the \"Kaf HaChayyim\" (470:3) rules that he need not fast. To circumvent this question, as well as dispute regarding a firstborn non-Jew who converts to Judaism, Rabbi Yosef Shalom Elyashiv suggests that such firstborns participate in a \"seudat mitzvah\" (see here and here below).\n\nAs with most Jewish fast days, the fast begins at dawn. The common practice is that it is subsequently broken in the morning at a \"seudat mitzvah\" (celebratory meal) following a \"siyum\". If the fast is not broken at a \"seudat mitzvah\", there is a dispute among halakhic authorities regarding the duration of the fast. Normally, all Jewish fasts continue until nightfall (most authorities rule that this is approximately 40 minutes after sunset, but varies by location and time of year). However, the presence of a fast immediately before a holiday presents a unique quandary. Normally, one may not enter a Shabbat (Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath) or Yom Tov (Festival) in a state of fasting. The Talmud (\"Eruvin\" 41a) discusses what one should do when a formal fast day (other than Yom Kippur) falls directly before Shabbat or Yom Tov. The sages of the Talmud are divided over two options: Either one should break the fast shortly before sundown, or one should fast through nightfall, regardless. Since the Talmud arrives at no clear conclusion, disagreement arose among halakhic authorities. The Maharil rules that the fast continues until nightfall, while others rule that it should be broken before sundown.\n\nIn modern times, however, this fast is rarely observed, as most firstborns opt to attend a \"siyum\" (festive meal celebrating the completion of a Tractate of the Talmud) instead. This is considered a legitimate form of \"breaking\" the fast, and therefore the firstborn may eat during the rest of the day.\n\nThe \"Mishnah Berurah\" quotes three opinions regarding circumstances in which the fast may be broken. According to the first, a healthy individual must fast if he can sustain the fast without undue suffering and without any subsequent weakening that would affect his ability or inclination to heartily partake of his Passover Seder meal (and specifically the matzah). (If one is obligated to partake of a festive meal that day, such as if he is the father of an infant on the day of circumcision, this opinion requires him to undertake a reciprocal fast at the soonest opportunity.) According to the second custom (quoted by the \"Magen Avraham\" in the name of the \"Maharash Levi\"), the fast may be broken at any festive meal celebrating a circumcision or a redemption of the firstborn. According to the third custom, based upon the \"Maharshal\", the fast may even be broken at a \"seudat mitzvah\" for a \"siyum\" celebrating the completion of study of a tractate of Talmud. The latter custom is commonly observed.\n\nIf a firstborn attending a \"siyum\" does not hear the completion of the tractate, or if he does not understand what he hears, or if he is in the \"shiva\" period of mourning and is thus forbidden from listening to the Torah material being taught, some authorities rule that subsequent eating would not qualify as a \"seudat mitzvah\" and he would therefore be forbidden to break his fast. Other authorities allow a firstborn to break his fast under such circumstances. The \"Minchas Yitzchak\" (ibid.) suggests that a firstborn in such a position should at least try to contribute to the \"siyum\" in some way, such as by sponsoring or helping to prepare the meal.\n\nIn order to break one's fast on a \"seudat mitzvah\", many authorities rule that one must partake of at least a \"kotevet\" of food (around 1.5 to 2 oz.) or a \"melo lugmav\" of liquid (at least around 1.7 oz.) at the \"seudah\". Other authorities rule that a firstborn need not eat anything at the \"siyum\" itself, and that he may break his fast anytime after the \"siyum\".\n\nRabbi Moshe Feinstein extends the possibility of breaking the fast to include even breaking it at a festive meal celebrating the completion of any mitzvah that required regular, continual involvement. According to these authorities, such a meal would be considered a \"seudat mitzvah\" of adequate caliber to exempt one from continuing the fast.\n\nAdditionally, the \"Mordechai\" quotes the ruling of his father-in-law \"Rabbeinu Yechiel\" that firstborns need not fast \"at all\" on the day before Passover; firstborns need only limit their diet to snacks. (The \"Bigdei Yesha\" commentary suggests the rationale behind this ruling was to avoid holding a fast during the month of Nisan, which is generally prohibited.) The \"Mishnah Berurah\" states that it is appropriate for a weak individual to follow this ruling.\n\nIf the day before Passover falls on Shabbat, most authorities rule that the fast is set for the previous Thursday, and this has become common practice. This is because it is forbidden to fast on Shabbat (except for where Yom Kippur falls on Shabbat), and fasts are preferably not set for Friday. In such a scenario, the ritual of Bedikas Chametz (the formal search for forbidden leaven that is conducted before Passover) is set for Thursday night. Normally, it is forbidden to eat (starting from nightfall) before conducting the \"Bedikas Chametz\". However, for a firstborn who is fatigued or uncomfortable from the fast, the \"Mateh Moshe\" and \"Maharil\" rule that some food may be eaten before the search or that another person may be appointed to perform the search on behalf of the firstborn.\n\nRabbi Moshe Feinstein (OC 4:69:4) writes, based on the \"Rema\" (who is supported by a similar ruling of the \"P'ri M'gadim\"), that one who breaks the adjusted Thursday fast might be required to fast on Friday. Since there are many opinions that dispute the \"Rema\", Rabbi Feinstein writes that, practically speaking, one should not fast on Friday in such circumstances. This rationale may be based on the above cited \"Korban N'tan'el\", who writes that excessive strictures regarding keeping the Fast of the Firstborn should not come at the expense of possibly fasting unnecessarily during the month of \"Nisan\".\n\nThe above halakhic quandary is avoided completely if a firstborn fasts the entire day on Thursday. However, Rabbi Feinstein makes no mention of this requirement. In order for a firstborn (who eats on Thursday) to comply with the ruling of the Rema, the \"Piskei T'shuvot\" suggests participating in a second \"siyum\" on Friday, while Rabbi Tzvi Pesach Frank suggests partaking on Friday of leftovers from the previous day's \"siyum\".\n\nIn halakha, there are two general types of fast: the communal fast and the individuals' fast. Among other differences between the two, a special prayer is added by the \"Chazzan\" (leader of the prayers) on communal fasts whenever both ten fasting individuals congregate and the Chazzan is fasting. While the \"Magen Avraham\" treats the fast as an individuals' fast, the \"Shiyurei K'nesset Ha-G'dolah\", the \"P'ri Chadash\", and the \"Or Zaru'a\" view it as a communal fast. To avoid the practical implications of the controversy, the \"Mishnah Berurah\" suggests that a firstborn should not serve as Chazzan on the day of the fast.\n\nAdditionally, this fast differs from most other fasts established in the Jewish calendar in that this fast is not indicated in the Hebrew Scriptures. This lessens the severity of the fast, and someone who experiences significant discomfort as a result of fasting may break his fast (\"Mishnah Berurah\" based on the \"Rema\").\n\nThe custom of the Fast of the Firstborn is today observed nearly universally throughout Orthodox Ashkenazic communities. However some Sefardic and Mizrahi communities have not fully adopted the custom. It is not traditionally observed by Yemenite Jews and its practice was discouraged by the former Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Haifa, R. Yosef Messas.\n\nAmongst Conservative Jews, the custom is endorsed by various communities and cited positively in their responsa.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1870236", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1870236", "title": "Bad faith (existentialism)", "text": "Bad faith (existentialism)\n\nBad faith (French: \"mauvaise foi\") is a philosophical concept utilized by existentialist philosophers Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre to describe the phenomenon in which human beings, under pressure from social forces, adopt false values and disown their innate freedom, hence acting inauthentically. It is closely related to the concepts of self-deception and \"ressentiment\".\n\nA critical claim in existentialist thought is that individuals are always free to make choices and guide their lives towards their own chosen goal or \"project\". This claim suggests that individuals cannot escape this freedom, even in overwhelming circumstances. For instance, even an empire's colonized victims possess choices: to submit to rule, to negotiate, to commit suicide, to resist nonviolently, or to counter-attack.\n\nAlthough external circumstances may limit individuals (this limitation from the outside is called facticity), they cannot force a person to follow one of the remaining courses over another. In this sense the individual still has some freedom of choice. For this reason, an individual may choose in \"anguish,\" fully aware that this will have consequences. For Sartre, to claim that one amongst many conscious possibilities takes undeniable precedence (for instance, \"I cannot risk my life, because I must support my family\") is to assume the role of an object in the world, not a free agent, but merely at the mercy of circumstance (a \"being-in-itself\" that is only its own facticity, i.e., it \"is\" inside itself, and acts there as a limitation).. For Sartre, this attitude is manifestly self-deceiving. \n\nHumans are always aware that they are more than what they are aware of, meaning that they are not whatever they are aware of. In this sense, humans cannot be defined as \"intentional objects\" of consciousness that includes the restrictions imposed by facticity, personal history, character, bodies, or objective responsibility. Thus, as Sartre often repeated, \"Human reality is what it is not, and it is not what it is.\" An example of what he means is being a doctor but wishing to \"transcend\" that to become a pig farmer. One is who one is not: a pig farmer, not who one is, a doctor. \n\nOne can only define oneself negatively, as \"what it is not\", and this negation is the only positive definition of \"what it is.\"\n\nFrom this we are aware of a host of alternative reactions to our freedom to choose an objective situation, since no situation can dictate a single response. We pretend that these possibilities are denied to us by assuming social roles and value systems external to this nature . But this is itself a decision made possible by our freedom and our separation from these things. \n\n\"Bad faith\" is the paradoxical free decision to deny to ourselves this inescapable freedom.\n\nSartre cites a café waiter, whose movements and conversation are a little too \"waiter-esque\". His voice oozes with an eagerness to please; he carries food rigidly and ostentatiously; \"his movement is quick and forward, a little too precise, a little too rapid\". His exaggerated behaviour illustrates that he is play acting as a waiter, as an object in the world: an automaton whose essence is to be a waiter. But that he is obviously acting belies that he is aware that he is not (merely) a waiter, but is rather consciously deceiving himself.\n\nAnother of Sartre's examples involves a young woman on a first date. She ignores the obvious sexual implications of her date's compliments to her physical appearance, but accepts them instead as words directed at her as a human consciousness. As he takes her hand, she lets it rest indifferently in his, \"neither consenting nor resisting – a thing\" – refusing either to return the gesture or to rebuke it. Thus she delays the moment when she must choose either to acknowledge and reject his advances, or consent to them. She conveniently considers her hand only a thing in the world, and his compliments as unrelated to her body, playing on her dual human reality as a physical being, and as a consciousness separate and free from this physicality.\n\nSartre suggests that by acting in bad faith the waiter and the woman are denying their own freedom, by using their freedom to do so. They manifestly know they are free, but are actively choosing not to acknowledge it. Bad faith is paradoxical in this regard: when acting in bad faith, a person is actively denying their own freedom, while relying on it to perform the denial.\n\nDe Beauvoir described three main types of women acting in bad faith: the \"Narcissist\" who denies her freedom by construing herself as a desirable object; the \"Mystic\", who invests her freedom in an absolute; and the \"Woman in Love\", who submerges her identity in that of her male object.\n\nShe also considered what she called the \"Serious Man\", who subordinated himself to some outside cause, to be in bad faith inasmuch as he denies his own freedom.\n\nSartre claims that the consciousness with which we generally consider our surroundings is different from our reflecting on this consciousness, i.e., the consciousness of \"ourselves being conscious of these surroundings\". The first kind of consciousness, before we think about, or reflect on, our previous consciousness, is called \"pre-reflective\". Reflecting on the pre-reflective consciousness is called \"reflective\" consciousness. But this cannot be called unconsciousness, as Freud used the term. Sartre gives the example of running after a bus: one does not become conscious of \"one's running after the bus\" until one has ceased to run after it, because until then one's consciousness is focused on the bus itself, and not one's chasing it.\n\nIn this sense consciousness always entails being self-aware (\"being for-itself\"). Since for Sartre consciousness also entails a consciousness of our separation from the world, and hence freedom, we are also always aware of this. But we can manipulate these two levels of consciousness, so that our reflective consciousness interprets the factual limits of our objective situation as insurmountable, whilst our pre-reflective consciousness remains aware of alternatives.\n\nOne convinces oneself, in some sense, to be bound to act by external circumstance, in order to escape the anguish of freedom. Sartre says that people are \"condemned to be free\": whether they adopt an \"objective\" moral system to do this choosing for them, or follow only their pragmatic concerns, they cannot help but be aware that they are not – fundamentally – part of them. Moreover, as possible intentional objects of one's consciousness, one is fundamentally \"not\" part of oneself, but rather exactly what one, as consciousness, defines oneself in opposition to; along with everything else one could be conscious of.\n\nFundamentally, Sartre believes humankind cannot escape responsibility by adopting an external moral system, as the adoption of such is in itself a choice that we endorse, implicitly or explicitly, for which we must take full responsibility. Sartre argues that one cannot escape this responsibility, as each attempt to part one's self from the freedom of choice is in itself a demonstration of choice, and choice is dependent on a person's wills and desires.\n\nAs a human, one cannot claim one's actions are determined by external forces; this is the core statement of existentialism. One is \"condemned\" to this eternal freedom; human beings exist before the definition of human identity exists. One cannot define oneself as a thing in the world, as one has the freedom to be otherwise. One is not \"a philosopher\", as at some point one must/will cease the activities that define the self as \"a philosopher\". Any role that one might adopt does not define one as there is an eventual end to one's adoption of the role; i.e. other roles will be assigned to us, \"a chef\", \"a mother\". The self is not constant, it cannot be a thing in the world. Though one cannot assign a positive value to definitions that may apply to oneself, one remains able to say what one is not.\n\nThis inner anguish over moral uncertainty is a central underlying theme in existentialism, as the anguish demonstrates a personal feeling of responsibility over the choices one makes throughout life. Without an emphasis on personal choice, one may make use of an external moral system as a tool to moralize otherwise immoral acts, leading to negation of the self. According to existentialism, dedicated professionals of their respective moral codes – priests interpreting sacred scriptures, lawyers interpreting the Constitution, doctors interpreting the Hippocratic oath – should, instead of divesting the self of responsibility in the discharge of their duties, be aware of their own significance in the process. This recognition involves the questioning of the morality of all choices, taking responsibility for the consequences of one's own choice and therefore; a constant reappraisal of one's own and others' ever-changing humanity. One must not exercise bad faith by denying the self's freedom of choice and accountability. Taking on the burden of personal accountability in all situations is an intimidating proposition – by pointing out the freedom of the individual, Sartre seeks to demonstrate that the social roles and moral systems we adopt protect us from being morally accountable for our actions.\n\n\n\n"}

It has been dated to c. 530 CE.\n\nBeowulf is an epic poem that refers to the conflict, but not to a battle on Lake Vänern. In Beowulf, the Swedish king Ohthere (Ottar Vendelkråka, who is often called the first historical king of Sweden) had died and his brother Onela (Áli) had usurped the Swedish throne. Ottar's sons Eanmund and Eadgils (Adils) had to flee to Geatland and seek refuge with the Geatish king Heardred. This induced Onela to attack the Geats and kill both Eanmund and Heardred. In order to avenge his king and kinsman, Beowulf decided to help Eadgils gain the throne of Sweden. During the battle Eadgils slew Onela and became the king of Sweden.\n\nThere are a few references in Norse sources that give an account of the battle on the ice of Lake Vänern. Some of the sagas differ from one another in detail. The equivalent of Onela, \"Áli hinn upplenzki\", has been placed in Norwegian Oppland, rather than Swedish Uppland.\n\nIn Snorri Sturluson's \"Prose Edda\", in the \"Skáldskaparmál\", the battle is mentioned in two verses. In the first account, Snorri cites a fragmentary poem called \"Kálfsvísa\":\n\nIn the second account, Snorri relates: \"They decided to fight on the ice of the water which is called Vänern...In this fight king Áli died and a great many of his people. Then king Adils took from him his helmet Hildisvín [battle-boar] and his horse Hrafn.\"\n\nIn the \"Ynglinga saga\", Snorri relates that King Adils (Eadgils) fought hard battles with the Norwegian king who was called Áli hin upplenzki. They fought on the ice of Lake Vänern, where Áli fell and Adils won. Snorri relates that much is told about this event in the saga of the Sköldungs, and that Adils took \"Hrafn\" (Raven), Áli's horse.\n\nThe \"Skjöldunga saga\" is lost but at the end of the 16th century, Arngrímur Jónsson saved a piece of information from this saga in Latin. He wrote: \"There was animosity between king Adils of Sweden and the Norwegian king Áli of Uppland. They decided to fight on the ice of Lake Vänern. Adils won and took his helmet, chainmail and horse.\"\n\nAdils would become a famous king of whom much is told in the legends of Hrólf Kraki and in the Danish Gesta Danorum. According to Snorri, he is buried in Old Uppsala.\n\nThe accounts of the Battle on the Ice contain accurate information about this time and the Swedish Vendel Age. This period was characterized by the appearance of mounted warriors who fought on horseback and by the use of boar-crested helmets.\n\nIn the Battle on the Ice, the combatants are described as fighting on horseback, although the later Norsemen and Anglo-Saxons who told of this battle in their legends would fight on foot. Likewise, Onela's helmet is called the \"battle-boar\" although the boar-crested helmets were long out of use by the time records of the event were written down. Many instances of boar-crested helmets have been found in extant examples, notably in the burial mounds of Vendel, Valsgärde and Uppsala. The power centre of ancient Scandinavia is up to much debate still.\n"}
{"id": "1870260", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1870260", "title": "U.S. Agent", "text": "U.S. Agent\n\nU.S. Agent (John Walker) is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, usually those starring Captain America and the Avengers. He first appeared in \"Captain America\" #323 (November 1986) as Super-Patriot. He was later redesigned as a new incarnation of Captain America and, a few years later, as U.S. Agent.\n\nIn 2012, the character was ranked 29th in IGN's list of \"The Top 50 Avengers\". Wyatt Russell portrays John Walker in the Marvel Cinematic Universe Disney+ series \"The Falcon and the Winter Soldier\".\n\nThe character John Walker was first introduced as the supervillain Super-Patriot in \"Captain America\" #323 (November 1986). Mark Gruenwald created Walker to counter the general message in \"Captain America\" of patriotism being invariably good, describing him as someone \"who embodied patriotism in a way that Captain America didn't—a patriotic \"villain\". Basically, I just wanted to do the opposite of Steve Rogers. Okay, Steve Rogers is a poor northern urban boy. So I'll make a guy from rural middle class south. Cap is now old, so this guy'll be a real young up-and-comer. Cap has lofty ideals, so I'll make Super-Patriot be more realistic and more pragmatic. So, I put together his background and character traits by playing the opposite game.\"\n\nAfter a return appearance in \"Captain America\" #327, Gruenwald reintroduced him as the new Captain America in issue #333. Though Gruenwald said he would not have done this if it had not been a logical development from the preceding storylines, he also openly acknowledged that the motivating reason for replacing Steve Rogers as Captain America was to boost sales:\n\nWith \"Iron Man\", for example, we had James Rhodes take the lead character's place, and we did it for two years—which I'm sure was about a year and a half longer than anybody thought we would do it. In \"Thor\" we had Beta Ray Bill take Thor's place for two or three issues. So, this is the sort of thing that has been done to shake up people before. You know, I'm responsible for it in \"Iron Man\" and I was editor of \"Thor\" at the time of Beta Ray Bill, and believe me it's a trick I know \"works\" because I've seen it work a number of times. It's just to get you noticed so that people who don't normally read it will say, \"Oh, I heard something about this, let me read it and see.\" And with luck, folks will get hooked on the storyline.\n\nJohn Walker's installation as Captain America indeed provided a major boost to the series's sales, and he remained the main character of \"Captain America\" for issues 333 through 350, during which his character generally became more heroic. In \"Captain America\" #354 he was given another name and costume change, this time as U.S. Agent (created by writer Mark Gruenwald and artist Kieron Dwyer) using a discarded costume of Steve Rogers (the original Captain America): a black outfit with a different alignment of the stars and stripes to differentiate it from Steve Rogers' suit.\n\nLike some West Coast Avengers teammates who had their own series (such as Iron Man, or Hawkeye in \"Solo Avengers\"), the character U.S. Agent was popular enough to support his own limited series in 1993. The mini-series was used to finish off a long-standing Marvel Universe plot thread involving the Scourge of the Underworld.\n\nDuring the events of the \"Maximum Security\" storyline, U.S. Agent was given a new uniform reminiscent of riot police uniforms. He continued to use that uniform in his 2001 miniseries, which followed the events in \"Maximum Security\" and was written and drawn by Jerry Ordway.\n\nJohn Walker was born in the fictional town of Custer's Grove, Georgia. He grew up idolizing his older brother, Mike, a helicopter pilot who died in the Vietnam War in 1974. John wanted to live up to Mike's memory, who was idolized by their parents, and so he later enlisted in the military. John served at Fort Bragg, although it was never specifically stated which unit he was attached to. Unfortunately for John, he served during peacetime and so never became the hero that he perceived Mike to have been.\n\nAfter John received an honorable discharge from the United States Army, he was told by a friend about the Power Broker, a mysterious individual who gave people superhuman abilities. Walker and his friend received treatments that granted them superhuman abilities.\n\nWalker, now in debt to the Power Broker, intends to join the Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation but meets Ethan Thurm who becomes his manager and persuades Walker to become a hero instead. Thurm secures financial backing, helps Walker design a costume, and sets out a strategy that allows him to debut as the corporate-sponsored Super-Patriot, who then travels the country promoting his image to the nation through patriotic rallies and community service.\n\nAt a rally in Central Park, he holds a secretly rehearsed performance in which he publicly criticizes Captain America and is subsequently attacked by three extremist supporters of Captain America called the Bold Urban Commandos or \"Buckies\". Walker defeats them in the staged fight as a demonstration of his combat prowess and patriotism. Captain America confronts Walker privately afterwards and demands that he stop using the Buckies, since people attending the rally could have been hurt in a panic resulting from the staged attack. Walker refuses, arguing that his actions are justified by his quest to replace the outdated Captain America as the nation's symbol.\n\nWhen Captain America repeatedly refuses his challenges to a fight, Super-Patriot attacks him. Although Captain America proves to be a more skilled fighter and lands blow after blow, a trash-talking Walker manages to absorb the attacks. With neither man falling after a lengthy brawl, Super-Patriot flings a number of throwing stars at Captain America. Captain America is too tired to dodge. One hits him in the chest, embedding into his uniform but doing little to no actual physical damage. With the successful strike, a gleeful Super-Patriot claims victory and promptly departs. A weary and dejected Captain America tries to tell himself that the fight was a draw, as neither man actually went down. But he is nonetheless left questioning his own fighting abilities while acknowledging Super-Patriot's superior strength and stamina.\n\nWalker truly catches the eye of the nation though when he tackles a terrorist named Warhead who threatens to detonate a nuclear weapon in Washington, D.C. atop the Washington Monument. Walker scales the monument, disarming him with a throwing star, before sending him plummeting to the ground below. Warhead – preferring to go out 'like a man' – kills himself before hitting the ground by detonating a hand grenade.\n\nThis high-profile act makes him an instant celebrity, appearing in The Washington Post and on national television where he claims himself to be \"America's future\", which in turn brings him to the attention of Valerie Cooper in her role as a Presidential advisor.\n\nWalker is the second Super-Patriot character in the Marvel Universe. The first Super-Patriot debuted in \"Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.\" #13 in July 1969 and never appeared again. The original Super-Patriot's costume bears no resemblance to that used by John Walker.\n\nSoon after, the original Captain America (Steve Rogers) abandons his costume and identity when ordered to report directly to the Commission on Superhuman Activities, feeling that Captain America had grown beyond the name's original role as a symbol of America during the war and not wanting to be tied down to a political agenda.\n\nThe Commission debate who should become the new Captain America, with Nick Fury and Sam Wilson (the Falcon) both being considered as candidates, although it was considered that the former was too old and would not want to give up the autonomy he enjoyed as Director of S.H.I.E.L.D, where as in the case of the latter they did not believe that the United States was ready for a black Captain America.\n\nDr. Valerie Cooper, a member of the Commission, suggests that Walker should be made the new Captain America, as a U.S. government operative. Though repulsed by the notion of giving up being Super-Patriot and taking on the identity he has criticized so much, Walker ultimately answers, \"Ma'am, if Uncle Sam wanted me to be Mickey Mouse, I'd do it.\" In becoming Captain America, he is forced to abandon Thrum as his manager, and can only retain one of the \"Buckies\", Lemar Hoskins, since the other two fail to pass background checks.\n\nHoskins is partnered with Walker as the new Bucky, but Hoskins later changes his codename to \"Battlestar\" due to the negative racial connotations of the name for a black man. They follow the orders of Adrian Sammish. Walker is trained by Freedom Force, the Guardsmen, and the Taskmaster—Taskmaster's training focusing on teaching him how to use Captain America's shield—and goes on his first mission against The Watchdogs, a militia group.\n\nAnother of Walker's early acts as Captain America was a mission to \"aid stability and democracy in South America\" by teaming up with the Tarantula in order to hunt escaped political dissidents from his home country on behalf of its oppressive regime in order to silence them. Despite believing in the fight against Communism and in the principle of helping America's \"Democratic allies in Latin America\", Walker becomes increasingly uncomfortable with the methods used by Tarantula after he interrogates and threatens occupants of an immigration detention center for information on his targets. The two battle and wound Spider-Man, however Walker – increasingly conflicted by the fact that both the immigrants who Tarantula interrogated and Spider-Man looked upon him and the uniform he wore with fear, seeing him as an enemy – decides to walk away, convincing himself that this course of action was not something that Captain America would support. Spider-Man ultimately defeats Tarantula and Walker later learns that the individual who gave him his orders to help Tarantula was a rogue agent who did so without legal authority, beating him and telling him that the uniform he wears is supposed to inspire, not terrify.\n\nAlthough Walker finds himself trying to emulate Rogers' ethics, Walker is more brutal than his predecessor, due to his reactionary points of view. His superhuman strength and lack of emotional control lead him to inadvertently beat Professor Power to death. as well as badly injure the mutant group 'The Resistants'\n\nThe two rejected \"Buckies\", now calling themselves Left-Winger and Right-Winger, crash the press conference arranged by Cooper to reveal the \"new\" Captain America and Battlestar, and announce Walker's name and birthplace on national TV. His parents are subsequently killed by The Watchdogs; this incident drives Walker closer to a mental breakdown, particularly when the Commission orders him not to step out of line in the future, resulting in him missing his parents' funeral due to his new responsibilities. In a state of rage, he kills many of the Watchdogs, and beats Left-Winger and Right-Winger to a pulp, leaving them to die in an explosion. They are left terribly burned and in critical condition. Walker is then captured by Flag-Smasher, but rescued by the original Captain America, Battlestar, and D-Man.\n\nThe Red Skull, now in a clone body of Steve Rogers, lures Walker to Washington, D.C. The Skull attacks Walker with a horde of Walker's enemies, but Walker kills or critically injures them all in a single brawl. The Red Skull arranges for Walker to confront Captain America—now using the identity and costume of \"the Captain\"—but Rogers defeats him and confronts the Red Skull. Walker wakes up and throws his shield at the Red Skull, causing him to be exposed to his own \"dust of death,\" giving his head a reddish skull appearance, but the Skull escapes. Rogers and Walker give a report to the Commission, which returns the uniform of Captain America to Steve Rogers. Rogers declines the offer, but Walker persuades him to reconsider and accept it. At a press conference announcing the return of the original Captain America, General Haywerth fakes Walker's assassination by a Watchdog in order to set up John Walker in a new identity.\n\nTo address Walker's psychosis, he is hypnotized into believing his parents are still alive, and he would not recover his full memory for many years. He is also given a new cover identity of 'Jack Daniels' as well as speech therapy and work to erase old mannerisms in order to help hide the fact that he was the man the public had recently seen \"assassinated\".\n\nWalker soon resurfaced as an adventurer, the U.S. Agent, wearing a variation of the costume that Rogers had worn as the Captain and using his vibranium disc as a shield. Walker continued to work for the Commission. He was first seen as the U.S. Agent, battling an Iron Monger as a test for the Commission. He was placed as a watchdog of West Coast Avengers and the Vision by the Commission, as a condition to possibly get their government clearance reinstated. Some time later, he rescued Battlestar from the Power Broker, and reconciled with him; Walker learned that his memories had been altered and that his parents were dead.\n\nThe manner of his appointment to the West Coast Avengers team, and his own abrasive attitude, saw U.S.Agent frequently come into conflict with his colleagues, in particular the headstrong Hawkeye (Clint Barton), which culminated in a battle between the two that saw them both suspended. He later almost killed Spider-woman (Julia Carpenter) – an ex-employee of U.S.Agent's employers Commission for Super Human Activities – hesitating over delivering the fatal blow before collapsing in grief – his guilt over his long history of violence catching up with him.\n\nWhile under the employ of the Commission for Superhuman Activities, U.S. Agent was charged with the responsibility of taking down the Punisher (Frank Castle). U.S. Agent locates the Punisher and after some hand-to-hand combat, the Punisher discloses that he is attempting to take down the Maggia; he agrees to help the Punisher, vowing to take him into custody once they had done so. Agent takes down the superpowered mercenary Paladin, who had been employed to kill the Punisher by the Maggia, breaking both of his legs with his shield. Ultimately the Punisher upon completing his mission escapes U.S. Agent by dressing a deceased henchman in his uniform and leaving him in a burning building, convincing U.S.Agent that he had perished in the fire. U.S. Agent is berated by his employers who inform him that his job is to act, not think and declaring that it is no wonder that he failed as Captain America. U.S. Agent walks away halfway through his dressing-down.\n\nU.S. Agent was once more forced to choose between following the rules and laws of the nation he had dedicated himself to serving, or ignoring them in favor of doing what he personally believed to be right, when he investigated a series of gruesome murders of illegal immigrants on the Mexico/U.S border who he later discovered were being committed by a corrupt law enforcement official.\n\nU.S. Agent investigates the killer \"the Scourge of the Underworld\" and discovers that Scourge is not an individual at all, but is in fact essentially a franchise of killers trained towards the singular purpose of wiping out the menace posed by the world's various super-villains. U.S. Agent attempts to infiltrate the organization but is captured, tortured and interrogated until he is released by a masked operative who reveals himself to be none other than Mike Walker – U.S. Agent's older brother who he had long thought to have died in the Vietnam War. Mike tries to convince U.S. Agent to join the Scourge program before letting him go in order to think it over.\n\nIt is later revealed that \"Mike\" is not U.S. Agent's brother at all but rather a cleverly designed deception intended to lure U.S. Agent into joining the Scourge program himself. U.S. Agent decides against joining the program at which point 'Mike' – better known as 'Bloodstain' – attempts to wipe him out unsuccessfully.\n\nThrough interrogating members of the Scourge organization, Agent traces its mysterious benefactor back to a high-class estate, at which point he is revealed to be none other than Thomas Holloway – the man previously known as the World War II era hero \"The Avenging Angel\" – who reveals how he had set up the Scourge organization using his immense wealth after witnessing an innocent bystander killed by a criminal's bullet meant for him. Unable to continue his costumed career because of the guilt he instead decided to set up the organization to atone for his failings as a crime fighter and battle those criminals who would undermine America's moral character.\n\nU.S. Agent and Bloodstain battle one last time, and Bloodstain is eventually dispatched by his own bullets as they deflect off U.S. Agent's shield. Thomas Holloway is subsequently arrested for his crimes and the Scourge program seemingly closed down. Later, U.S. Agent muses that just like Holloway he had done things as a hero that he feels he needs to make amends for, but promises that unlike Holloway he will find the true path to salvation.\n\nU.S. Agent fought alongside the Avengers in several battles. After the Avengers moved to a United Nations based charter, he received only one vote (though not from himself) in the ensuing vote and consequently lost his place on the team. Even with his personality conflicts and reckless behavior, he soon proved himself worthy of being an Avenger and was able to rejoin.\n\nDuring his time with the West Coast Avengers, U.S.Agent participated in the 'Infinity War' in which he was part of the team that remained on Earth to protect it against Magnus waves of superhuman dopplegangers, the 'Infinity Crusade', during which he was recruited by the Goddess along with other heroes who were susceptible, as they are either especially religious, mystically inclined, or have had a near-death experience, and Operation Galactic Storm in which he was responsible for guarding the Kree prisoners Captain Atlas and Dr. Minerva, and battled a Kree Sentry\n\nU.S. Agent also helped the team battle the likes of the Lethal Legion, Dr Demonicus and his Pacific Overlords, Ultron and his robotic 'bride' War Toy, the 'Night Shift', the 'Bogatyri' – a group of Russian extremists intent upon ushering in a new Cold War, 'Death Web' – a team of spider-themed villains, and Immortus.\n\nU.S. Agent, along with fellow \"replacement\" heroes Thunderstrike (Eric Masterson) and War Machine (James Rhodes), was manipulated into battling the heroes who had inspired them – Captain America, Thor, and Iron Man – by the time travelling villainess \"Terminatrix\", before putting their differences aside to team up against their common foe.\n\nU.S. Agent along with the rest of the West Coast Avengers, the Avengers and the X-Men, participated in the 'Bloodties' crossover, during which Professor X attempted to negotiate a peace to end the civil war on the island of Genosha. U.S. Agent was charged with the responsibility of acting as bodyguard for Professor X.\n\nCaptain America sarcastically cited U.S. Agent's use of his \"famous powers of composure and diplomacy\" as one example of the recent failings of the West Coast Avengers when he indicated his intention to shut the team down. This provoked U.S. Agent's fury who raised his hand to strike Captain America; Iron Man stopped him and uttered, \"Not now. Not ever\".\n\nDuring this time, U.S. Agent was featured in a Marvel UK comic called \"Super Soldiers\", initially battling, then teaming up with American and British soldiers empowered by a variation of the drugs that created Nuke.\n\nWhen the West Coast Avengers dissolved, he dumped his U.S. Agent costume and shield into the Hudson River. Soon after, most of the then-current members of the West Coast Avengers were asked by Tony Stark to found Force Works. Initially the Agent was reluctant, however Scarlet Witch later persuaded him to join, stating that she needed the Agent to be the team's \"backbone\" and intended to run the team on tight military lines and the values of strength and dedication that Agent had shown her during their time together on the West Coast Avengers. U.S. Agent ultimately joined the new team, wearing a new costume and using an energy-based shield provided to him by Tony Stark. Stark describes U.S. Agent as a \"loose cannon\", suggesting that he could have an identity problem, expressing the desire to develop a new look for him \"to get U.S. Agent out of Captain America's red, white and blue shadow\".\n\nU.S. Agent travels to an isolated region of Tennessee in order to locate Hawkeye (Clint Barton) who had disappeared after the death of his then-wife Mockingbird. Angry at the fact that Hawkeye had abandoned his teammates when they had desperately needed his support to avoid the dissolution of the West Coast Avengers, U.S. Agent finds him and they initially fight before eventually reconciling, at which point U.S. Agent informs Hawkeye of all the recent changes – including the formation of Force Works and the death of Wonder Man (Simon Williams).\n\nHawkeye vents that he has been through a lot with the loss of his wife, and that he mistrusts Tony Stark, prompting a rare showing of emotion from U.S. Agent who confesses that the death of his own parents haunts every waking moment of his life and that he more than anyone knows what it is like to live life on the outside looking in – never quite good enough for anyone – but at least he is not running and hiding from it!\n\nThe two agree to put their spat aside and sleep, with U.S. Agent telling Hawkeye that he will be taking him back in the morning regardless of any objections, however when U.S. Agent wakes Hawkeye is gone – although he leaves him a note thanking him for helping him get some things off his chest, and letting him know that he is not all bad after all.\n\nIn the spirit of forgiveness, U.S. Agent later formulates a plan to reconcile Hawkeye with the rest of his former teammates – especially Tony Stark – by inviting him as a secret guest to the Force Works Christmas party. While Hawkeye waits alone he monitors U.S. Agent and the rest of the Force Works team via video feed as they listen to Stark issue a sincere apology for his behavior in recent times – from walking out on the West Coast Avengers team, to faking his own death and not trusting them with the truth.\n\nUnfortunately Hawkeye only catches the part of the speech where Stark talks about Hawkeye's \"loud mouthed opinions\", switching the feed off before he hears Stark refer to Hawkeye as the backbone of the West Coast Avengers team, a friend, and how he misses his presence more than anything, and when U.S. Agent learns that Hawkeye has left in a temper, he wonders what on Earth could have gone wrong...\n\nU.S. Agent remained a member throughout the team's tenure, fighting threats such as the Kree, alien parasites The Scatter, Slorenian supernatural threat Ember, Slorenia's armored protectors Black Brigade, The Mandarin, fighting alongside Australian super hero Dreamguard (Willie Walkaway) against the dream-manipulating Orphan, Slorenia's undead shock troops The Targoth and Volkhvy the Eternal One, teaming up with the Avengers against the Kree commandos Excel, intergalactic mercenary The Broker, battling Force Works' own rogue security system VIRGIL, an alternate reality version of deceased former Force Works member Wonder Man (Simon Williams), and the Serpent Society\n\nU.S. Agent was briefly referred to as the Liegeman in \"Avengers\" Vol. 3 #2–3 as it was the codename for him in the Morgan le Fay verse.\n\nU.S. Agent briefly appears in \"Captain America\" (Vol 3) during the 'American Nightmare' story arc attempting to steal an experimental jet plane. Captain America stops him, and U.S. Agent is later seen in stasis along with others affected by the villain Nightmare.\n\nHe eventually became the field leader of the Jury, a group of armored corporate vigilantes, owned by Edwin Cord, owner of Cordco. U.S. Agent again wearing his original U.S. Agent uniform and now using an eagle-shaped shield that could be directed in midair via remote control. The Jury's job was to take down the Thunderbolts, but they were defeated by the Thunderbolts and their new leader Hawkeye, a former Avenger teammate of Walker's. The Jury attempted to apprehend the Thunderbolts a second time, but instead the two groups joined forces together against Brute Force and the soldiers of the Secret Empire.\n\nU.S. Agent was severely beaten to near death by Protocide. Due to emergency medical procedures performed on him, he was outfitted, by S.H.I.E.L.D., with an enhancing exo-skeleton.\n\nFollowing his recovery, he soon adopted a new costume and rejoined the Commission on Superhuman Activities, with the position at the head of the federal government's U.S. Marshal division, called S.T.A.R.S., the Superhuman Tactical Activities Response Squad. The group battled alien invaders and superhuman threats and was responsible for their imprisonment. In this role, he was placed in charge of coordinating Earth's heroes during the 'Maximum Security' crisis when Earth became a prison planet, claiming that he was needed to prevent the other heroes getting 'sidetracked' by their concern for the prisoners to ensure that their focus remained on what was best for Earth.\n\nU.S. Agent continued to work for S.T.A.R.S as America's super human 'top cop' under the observation of Valerie Cooper. In this role his former love, and current agent of S.H.I.E.L.D, Kali Vries—who he had endured Army boot-camp with many years previously, and who had bested him in almost all physical tests—was thrust upon him as second in command. U.S. Agent was uncomfortable with Vries' appointment as she had previously jilted him, although she was still affectionate towards him. Other S.T.A.R.S agents warned Agent that Vries was playing him. Vries is later revealed to be in the employ of ambitious Senator Warkovsky and on his order places a parasite capable of allowing mind control on U.S. Agent's neck.\n\nIn their second mission together U.S. Agent and Vries teamed up to tackle a radical faction of Atlantians working with the super-villain Poundcakes (Marian Pouncey). It transpired that Pouncey was attempting to trade more of the alien parasites capable of mind control with the Atlantians. The Sub-Mariner (Namor) disrupts the battle and discovers the parasite placed on U.S. Agent's neck by Vries. Vries later attends Agent's room and attempts to seduce him, placing another parasite on him. U.S. Agent—apparently no longer in control of his own will, and despite being informed that a S.H.I.E.L.D envoy had been dispatched—then takes the duffle bag full of parasites seized by S.T.A.R.S in order to take them to his manipulator who transpires to be none other than the Power Broker (Curtis Jackson)—the man originally responsible for granting John Walker his super-human powers, whose plan is to infect the International assemblage of Heads of State with the mind-controlling parasites.\n\nAt this point Captain America (Steve Rogers), who had been revealed to be the S.H.I.E.L.D envoy responsible for collecting the parasites, along with Kali Vries, burst into the meeting between U.S. Agent and the Power Broker. Power Broker places a parasite on the neck of Senator Warkovsky intent upon influencing his address to the International assemblage of Heads of State, but is interrupted by U.S. Agent who is subsequently assaulted by Captain America intent upon stopping him. The two battle with neither of them able to gain the upper hand. Meanwhile, Vries is captured by the Power Broker who reveals that he had been attacked and left for dead by aliens during the 'Maximum Security' crisis at which point, barely alive, he had become the host for an alien which produced the mind-controlling parasites, subsequently attempting to expand its control by infecting influential individuals. Power Broker then infects Vries with a parasite. Eventually Agent manages to escape Captain Americas attentions long enough to reveal the presence of the parasite on Senator Warkovsky's neck and removes it with his energy baton. Together Cap and Agent fight off the crowd of V.I.P's (also apparently under the control of the Power Broker), escaping and then teaming up to restrain both Power Broker and Vries and removing the parasites from each of them. Dum Dum Dugan then appears on the scene to inform U.S. Agent that Vries, far from being a traitor, was actually a deep cover agent acting on behalf of S.H.I.E.L.D with the intention of gaining Senator Warkovsky's confidence and discovering who was using the parasites and attempting to take the mother-parasite into custody for study and as evidence. Agent destroys the specimen and then speculates that he didn't believe it to be alien at all but rather a product of a government genetics lab that went wrong. Dugan is suspicious by his silence and shocked when Captain America indicates that he believes U.S. Agent's accusation. U.S. Agent is later seen deep in thought, looking at a photo of himself and Vries during better times and reading a letter of apology from her for her deceptions. He later burns the photo before running out of his room after being informed that there is an assignment for him, declaring \"I love this job!\"\n\nU.S. Agent is later summoned along with fellow Avengers Captain America, Thor, Jack of Hearts, Beast, Ironman, and She-Hulk to unite against a common threat. That threat? Litigation!\n\nAccountants Janice Imperato and Max Catan (executives from the Maria Stark foundation who help fund the Avengers) intend to hold a meeting in order to maintain the Avengers tax exempt status, audit the team's finances, and review a recent case – a battle against the \"Elements of Doom\" which resulted in the expensive loss of an Avengers Quinjet, and widespread property damage.\n\nU.S. Agent – stubborn as ever – claims a complete lack of knowledge of the incident as he \"is a very busy man\". When asked to justify his actions, U.S. Agent refuses to do so, with his response being \"Forget it. Theyre alive right? They should be grateful!\" and accused his interrogators of just wanting to drag heroes down.\n\nU.S. Agent leaves his interviewers with one piece of advice: \"I go out there to save lives. You just pay the bills. Just be good little bean counters – and pay em!\"\n\nWalker eventually became a member of the New Invaders, wearing a Captain America-like costume, serving alongside the likes of the original Human Torch, Union Jack (Chapman), and the Blazing Skull until the team disbanded.\n\nU.S. Agent's first task was to negotiate the release of the Blazing Skull from captivity at the hands of middle Eastern terrorists. It is revealed that U.S. Agent can speak fluent Arabic, but he is forced to exterminate the terrorists when they renege on the agreed deal.\n\nThe New Invaders then team up with Namor and his Atlantean forces in order to overthrow the government of Mazikandar – an alliance Namor agrees to because Mazikandar has been choking the seas with pollution by sinking oil tankers in an effort to control supply to the USA.\n\nThe New Invaders alongside the forces of Atlantis assault Mazikandar's government forces, scattering them and moving on to the capitol building in order to capture its head of state. Suddenly however they find themselves opposed by none other than the Avengers. U.S. Agent is confronted by Captain America, who calls him a disgrace to the uniform, instructing to take it off before he tears it off, but Walker replies that his country gave him that uniform because Rogers was not willing to do what they needed him to. Walker calls Rogers a traitor, and states that his country has given him the authority of the real Captain America, and that Rogers never understood duty to country and doing what is required to keep its shores safe. Rogers retorts that Captain America represents an ideal for all people, of all countries.\n\nUltimately U.S. Agent is defeated by Rogers. Mazikandar's dictator is presented to his hand picked successor, who promptly executes his predecessor on the steps of the capitol building to the surprise of both the Invaders and Avengers alike.\n\nThe murder of a man without trial causes a further schism with the Avengers, who blame the New Invaders for declaring open war on Mazikhandar. Namor responds that Mazikhandar had declared war on \"his\" nation when they decided to pollute the oceans.\n\nU.S. Agent – captive for the time being – receives word from the Thin Man requesting a distraction, which Walker provides by breaking his bonds and aggressively approaching Captain America, growling that the New Invaders operation is sanctioned by the U.S., Britain, and Altantis, and that the Avengers have no grounds to interfere. Hawkeye tries to cool the situation as only the hot-headed archer could by shooting U.S. Agent in the backside, prompting the now furious Walker to turn his attention from Captain America to Hawkeye.\n\nWith the two teams battling once more, Thin Man retreats to the inside of the Capitol building where he berates the new political leader for killing his predecessor and explaining that the previous leader had actually been a simulacrum – an imposter placed into that position when US Secretary of Defence Dell Rusk (secretly the Red Skull) had the real leader assassinated – and the New Invaders only agreed to help because they needed the synthetic alive.\n\nThe fighting ends when Namor announces that he has formed an alliance with Mazikhandar, and that it is now a protectorate of Atlantis thus giving the Avengers no need, and no power to remain.\n\nThin Man later informs the team that they have been formed to tackle a new threat – the \"Axis Mundi\" – a creation of the Red Skull and something born out of the ashes of Hitler's Third Reich, who have an army of assassins armed with sub-dimensional technology that gives them the ability to move instantly to wherever they wish without fear of barriers or borders and a plan to replace world leaders with synthezoids.\n\nThe U.S government, needing to counter the threat first created an elite strike force – the New Invaders – then equipped them with a battleship named \"The Infiltrator\", capable of travelling the world unseen and armed with tactical missiles with the ability to drop entire cities into sub dimensional space.\n\nWalker insisted on being called Captain America. Captain America (Steve Rogers), while attempting to close down the New Invaders, threatened Walker with legal action over his use of the uniform, stating that he owned the copyright to it. Walker informed Rogers that he had only taken the role in the first place because Rogers had refused the Thin Man's invitation to lead the team and that they had to show their enemies \"that Captain America is not afraid to fight!\"\n\nWhile Walker initially proved to be unpopular with many of his new allies, he later gained their respect, in particular winning over Namor who had been a close ally of the original Captain America, Steve Rogers. Walker saved Namor from a brainwashed and murderous Wolverine, who had been resurrected by The Hand during the \"Enemy of the State\" storyline. The badly injured Namor later offered Walker his personal thanks.\n\nIn the special one-shot \"Civil War: Choosing Sides\", Tony Stark (at this point U.S Secretary of Defense) orders U.S Agent north to Canada – vulnerable due to the death of Alpha Flight, in order to act as U.S liaison to the newly formed Omega Flight team, with an objective to stop super-powered criminals attempting to flee America's Superhuman Registration Act.\n\nU.S. Agent reacts as expected – furiously – stating he \"serves Uncle Sam, not Major Maple Leaf\", and there is no way he is going to \"freakin' Canada\". Stark makes the case that Canada supplies the U.S with 20% of its oil, and their security is a top priority for SHIELD, but U.S. Agent is unimpressed and even the threat of arrest is not enough to persuade him as he storms out.\n\nLater U.S. Agent overcomes an attack by a team of SHIELD agents mind-controlled by the super villain Purple Man, but is overcome by the Purple Man himself who orders him to fall from great height after stealing his shield – something he only survives because of his advanced biology.\n\nEager for revenge, U.S. Agent's defeat gives Tony Stark the leverage to finally persuade him to join Omega Flight when he reveals that the Purple Man has fled north himself.\n\nAs an employee of Omega Flight, U.S. Agent is given the responsibility of training Weapon Omega (Michael Pointer).\n\nDuring a mission to take down un-registered super-criminal Tentakill, Weapon Omega passes out mid-combat for unknown reasons forcing U.S. Agent to detain the criminal single handed. Weapon Omega's unusual behaviour rouses U.S. Agent's suspicions, who is later seen to be communicating covertly with an unknown source.\n\nIt later transpires that Weapon Omega is being manipulated by Omega Flight's handler Agent Brown as well as his psychologist Dr. Benning, but worse than that unregistered super-criminals are being detained, with no record being made of their detention, and their powers are being used to fuel Weapon Omega's energy absorbing power, resulting in the deaths of several of the inmates who are completely drained of life.\n\nIt is later revealed that U.S. Agent is acting on behalf of Tony Stark (Iron Man) who is monitoring Weapon Omega's progress and requires U.S. Agent to obtain the data analysis of Omega's powers as well as the details of his private consultations with Omega Flight's psychologists.\n\nBefore his departure Stark, due to his lack of knowledge that the super-villain Rap-tor had been recently detained—despite having access to all prisoner manifests—unknowingly confirms Agent's suspicions that super-villains detained by Omega Flight are not being officially recorded and that the villains are subsequently disappearing without explanation.\n\nU.S. Agent's suspicions grow when Weapon Omega is not seen for weeks at a time. He is repeatedly told by Agent Brown that Omega is simply unwell and resting. Arachne (Julia Carpenter), acting with U.S. Agent in order to uncover the conspiracy, spies and informs him that Weapon Omega isn't resting and for some reason he is being constantly observed.\n\nDuring their next training session U.S. Agent is easily besting Weapon Omega in combat when Omega's handlers increase the flow of power from the super-powered detainees. This results in Omega losing control as he manifests the various powers of numerous inmates, breaking U.S. Agent's ankle before manifesting the reptilian powers of Rap-tor, beating and lacerating U.S. Agent almost to death—an assault only stopped by the interference of Sasquatch (Walter Langkowski). U.S. Agent tries to warn Weapon Omega—who is shocked at his loss of control—that power is being fed into him via his suit, but is sedated before he is able to do so.\n\nWeapon Omega eventually realizes that he is being manipulated and that his handlers intend to continue to use him even against his will, however this is stopped by the U.S. Agent having discharged himself from the infirmary despite his severe injuries. Dr. Benning boasts that as a fail-safe had been activated, all evidence of her manipulation of Weapon Omega had been destroyed. It is at this point that Omega reveals that one of the individuals whose powers he had absorbed had been a technopath, and that he had accessed all of Benning's confidential records and sent them to Tony Stark. Weapon Omega then exposes Benning to a glimpse of the hundreds of personalities within his being, leaving her in a vegetative state. He then vows to become a hero rather than a weapon and is last seen assisting the people of Alaska—the location where his powers had first manifested, resulting in the deaths of the original Alpha Flight team.\n\nDuring the Dark Reign, U.S. Agent is removed from Omega Flight by Loki (disguised as the Scarlet Witch) to aid Hank Pym in defeating the reality-altering Chthon. Initially the pro-registration U.S. Agent finds himself in combat with the anti-registration Hulk and Hercules, but they later endeavor to team up against their common foe. Chthon's power is tied to Wundagore Mountain and U.S. Agent plays a part in separating him from that source by planting explosives in order to destroy it. The team ultimately defeat Chthon, and U.S. Agent quits the Omega Flight team – with their blessing – stating it was an honor to serve with them, but 'once an Avenger, always an Avenger'.\n\nFollowing their victory, U.S. Agent joins the Mighty Avengers. The team is sent on various missions including saving the Infinite Avengers Mansion from becoming untethered from reality. On a mission to China investigating the Unspoken (a former king of the Inhumans), U.S. Agent is devolved by Xenogen gas which turns him into an Alpha Primitive. He attacks the current Captain America, James \"Bucky\" Barnes while in this condition. Quicksilver convinces him to attack the Unspoken by saying \"The Commies will win!\" Hank Pym later creates a new shield for U.S. Agent after his previous shield was destroyed by the Collective Man.\n\nU.S. Agent was one of the Avengers who joined Hercules in his Assault on New Olympus. He said he believes that the Gods are just people with super powers and battled against Eris, Goddess of discord.\n\nFollowing a conflict involving a Cosmic Cube-empowered Absorbing Man and the Dark Avengers, U.S. Agent is stripped of his rank by Norman Osborn.\n\nU.S. Agent and several members of the now disbanded Mighty Avengers are called upon by Amadeus Cho during the events of Siege. Their mission is to stop Norman Osborn's Thunderbolts from stealing Odin's spear from the Asgardian armory. After engaging the Thunderbolts in battle, Nuke uses the spear to sever U.S. Agent's left arm and leg.\n\nAs thanks for his service during the siege of Asgard, John Walker is appointed the new warden of The Raft maximum security prison. The injuries he sustained during his fight with Nuke have left him wheelchair bound and using a prosthetic arm. He refuses to repair his body using more technologically advanced prostheses because he does not want to become a cyborg like the man who crippled him. Walker engaged several inmates in hand-to-hand combat during a prison riot, demonstrating that he could still hold his own despite some limitations. The warden was influential in establishing the new Thunderbolts beta team, appointing Songbird team leader and handpicking the new candidates.\n\nDuring the \"Fear Itself\" storyline, Juggernaut heavily damaged the Raft before escaping, causing a prison break. This triggered a security fail-safe in one section of the jail which reversed the air supply, eventually creating a fatal vacuum. Walker set out to override the system, which could only be done in person. He was assisted by Ghost, who earned Walker's respect after protecting the lives of the ungrateful inmates. Walker also rallies other help, inmate and powered alike, to assist him in his duties throughout this crisis. Norman Osborn escapes the Raft due in part to traitors on staff (one had a shrine to Osborn), which leaves Walker under a cloud of suspicion.\n\nIn August 2012 a teaser image for the Dark Avengers displayed U.S. Agent's traditional red, white and black shield followed by the tag line 'EVIL is our only HOPE!'.\n\nAn interview with writer Jeff Parker later confirmed that John Walker would be returning to the role of U.S. Agent with the Dark Avengers but that this return would 'come at a cost.'\n\nThe Dark Avengers team are thrown into an alternate world where, while unconscious, U.S. Agent is examined by an alternate reality Hank Pym and determined to be \"John Walker, ex-Marine Captain.\" June Covington is seemingly able to restore his lost limbs with help from this reality's version of the Venom symbiote in lobotomized form.\n\nDuring the \"AXIS\" storyline, an inverted Doctor Doom recruits U.S. Agent to join his version of the Avengers in order to help fight the now-evil Avengers starting with Scarlet Witch when she invades Latveria.\n\nDuring the \"Civil War II\" storyline, U.S. Agent meets with Paul Keane, president of Keane Industries, who, along with others, asks him to convince Sam Wilson, the current Captain America, to give up the shield and stand down. At first John declines the request, out of respect for Steve's decision to share the mantle with Sam, until they see a news report about Sam and former New Warrior Rage fighting the Americops, a private police force funded by Keane Industries. After Sam escapes from the Americops, U.S. Agent attacks him from behind knocking him out of the sky with his shield. He then tells Sam that he needs to stand down, saying that he is out of control and that he should hand over the shield. Sam refuses, acknowledging his mistakes when he assumed the mantle, and the two begin to fight, with John gaining the upper hand due to his powers. Sam defeats U.S. Agent by dragging him into a tunnel, where in the darkness the great horned owls that live in it gave him the advantage, allowing him to see through their eyes whilst Agent remains blind. It is later revealed that John never wanted to fight Sam until Steve approached him and convinced him to do so, saying that Sam has lost his way and needs to stand down. U.S. Agent was then reported missing in action on a secret mission to Syria, with a possible implication that his disappearance may have been the result of the now evil Steve Rogers' machinations.\n\nDuring the events of Avengers Standoff U.S. Agent, in his civilian guise of John Walker, attended a black market auction on Barbuda (formally A.I.M) Island where he bid on and won the \"Axiom Protocols\" - a drive containing strategies on how to defeat every super human on Earth that had been derived from the encyclopedic knowledge of S.H.I.E.L.D agent Phil Coulson. Coulson, who had also been in attendance at the auction disguised as Wolverine (character) later retrieves the protocols by disabling Walker with knock out gas.\n\nDuring the \"Secret Empire\" storyline, U.S.Agent appears briefly alongside the resistance forces, including fellow former West Coast Avengers teammates Mockingbird and Tigra. Together while aiding other allied group of superhero and super-villain resistances, they battle the Superior Octopus (Otto Octavius) and the forces of Steve Rogers' Hydra organization which took over America. Sam Wilson/All-New Captain America, Ant-Man (Scott Lang) and Winter Soldier manage to redeem Kobik and return the real Steve Rogers back from his imprisonment inside the Cosmic Cube, allowing the real Steve (who immediately dons his classic Captain America costume) to defeat his Hydra counterpart.\n\nHe later joined a team of heroes recruited by Captain Marvel to hunt down the Punisher for his actions when he was a member of Hydra Supreme Steve Rogers's \"Secret Empire\", even though the Punisher had been manipulated by Hydra, and was now hunting every last one of them in revenge.\n\nU.S. Agent, believing that the Steve Rogers who had lead Hydra had been the genuine article, later confronted the real Rogers as he investigated a new spate of murders by the vigilante the Scourge of the Underworld, beating him and accusing him of manipulating him. He is stopped when Misty Knight activates a stasis beam to hold him in place, at which point Rogers explains that he did not commit the crimes U.S. Agent is accusing him of and that \"someday we're going to grab a beer and I'll tell you exactly what went wrong\".\n\nU.S. Agent forms part of a new iteration of the superhero team Force Works during the \"Iron Man 2020\" storyline. Assembled to act as the U.S governments last, best line of defense against an uprising of robots and artificial intelligences, they are sent to the fictional South American nation of Lingares where their aircraft is shot down by local rebels. After surviving the crash landing U.S. Agent is forced to fight off a group of rebels with the assistance of Mockingbird before rendezvousing with the rest of the team, at which point they are attacked and seemingly overwhelmed by a group of rebels infected with Deathlok technology. While held captive with his shield confiscated, it is revealed that the Deathloks want the team for spare parts in their war against an even bigger threat, that of Ultimo. The team are rescued by War Machine and are surprised to discover that he himself had been rescued by MODOK Superior who now desires to join the team in order to add some \"much needed brain power\" to their ranks.\n\nAs a result of the experimental mutagenic augmentation process conducted on him by Dr. Karl Malus on behalf of the Power Broker, John Walker has superhuman strength (capable of lifting ten tons under maximum exertion), agility, reflexes/reactions, and endurance. His speed, dexterity, coordination, and balance are of the order of a superior Olympic athlete.\n\nAside from the above advantages, U.S. Agent is an exceptional hand-to-hand combatant and highly trained in gymnastics and acrobatics, having received rigorous training in unarmed combat and the use of his shield in a style similar to Captain America's own fighting style by the Taskmaster.\n\nHe is a seasoned combat veteran with military combat experience in tactical and strategic planning, observations, and special operations, has been shown to have a fluent grasp of the Arabic language, and Spanish, is technically proficient enough to bypass an advanced security system, is a qualified fixed-wing pilot, a trained scuba diver, and is highly proficient in the use of conventional firearms.\n\nHe is capable of using his nearly indestructible vibranium shield for defensive purposes and as a weapon. He has great accuracy at throwing his shield and due to his superhuman strength, it is potentially a lethal weapon.\n\nAgent has used a variety of shields in his time, initially inheriting Captain America's indestructible circular shield after Steve Rogers had relinquished it upon quitting the role and refusing to work for the Commission for Super Human Activities. U.S. Agent was later provided the Vibranium replica of this shield by Black Panther and used by Steve Rogers when Rogers adopted the title of 'The Captain'. U.S. Agent then briefly adopted a remote control shield against Hawkeye and the Thunderbolts. During his time with the New Invaders, U.S. Agent possessed a star shaped shield with retractable spikes. The shield was decorated with the names of Americans who had died at the hands of terrorists as well as a photograph of U.S. Agent's parents.\n\nThe U.S. Agent also wears synthetic stretch bulletproof fabric.\n\nAfter being badly injured by the villain Protocide, U.S. Agent was fitted with an exoskeleton by S.H.I.E.L.D. that allowed him to continue to walk, and according to then-Director Sharon Carter may have also provided \"An additional benefit or two\".\n\nAfter being crippled by Nuke, John Walker lost one arm and one leg. Electing to use ordinary low-tech prosthesis, he retires his U.S. Agent identity, and no longer has access to his weapons and gear. However, he still retains his full capability to act in self-defense.\n\nAt one point, the Agent used wrist guards which produced an energy shield as well as energy blasts. U.S. Agent's costume incorporated a \"thought relay receptor\" that picks up his mental commands and shapes his shield however he wills it. In U.S. Agent's own words \"It's better than the old trash can lid!\"\n\nIn his first costumed identity as the Super Patriot, Walker wore a costume that was capable of stopping multiple shots from a handgun at point blank range, and also used throwing stars and a flame torch.\n\nIn an alternate reality John Walker becomes Captain America and battles with Steve Rogers, with only the intervention of Nick Fury and then-President Ronald Reagan bringing the hostilities to an end. Regan gives a speech in which he enshrines the importance of helping the government against foreign enemies and in support of domestic affairs, but also the importance of America as a nation of individuals – ideologies represented by Walker and Rogers respectively. His speech is cut tragically short however when the head of the Commission, Douglas Rockwell, assassinates Rogers by shooting him dead on the orders of the Red Skull – who has secretly been planning Rogers downfall and was close to seeing his plans fail. In light of Rogers death, the President requests that John Walker become the new Captain America, however as it was before, Walker is lethally violent, and with no Steve Rogers alive to stop his fury he goes unchecked until the nation burns. Eventually Walker is stopped and imprisoned in the Vault for his crimes, but the government – realising that the man inside the costume was far more important than the costume itself – decide to retire the role of Captain America and consign it to a museum. Later, the Red Skull visits the museum, stands below the memorial of his greatest foe – a foe now utterly destroyed and reduced to nothing but a memory – and laughs as he has finally triumphed.\n\nIn another dystopian alternate reality in which Captain America's (Steve Rogers) icy tomb was not discovered by the Avengers until much later in history, U.S. Agent is once again a villain, working for an oppressively right wing United States government and going by the name of \"American Agent\".\n\nIn one panel, U.S. Agent is shown as one of the surviving heroes. He questions why Magneto is present, to which Nick Fury answers \"anyone who is not a zombie is an ally\".\n\nIn the Ultimate Marvel version of \"Major\" John Walker is a high-ranking official at the Camp Angel facility used to house mutants in the aftermath of 'Ultimatum', appearing to be complicit in the beating and torture of some mutants. When the news breaks that all mutants are actually the result of secret government experiments, a riot breaks out at the camp led by the X-Man Storm.\n\nJohn Walker of Earth 9907 is the deputy leader of the Thunder Guard—that Earth's feared super human police force. SS Agent has a costume and photonic energy shield similar to that worn and used by USAgent during his time with Force Works. He first appeared in \"Avengers Next\" #10.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It features ground-penetrating radar capabilities, which uses synthetic aperture techniques and a secondary receiving antenna to isolate subsurface reflections. MARSIS identified buried basins on Mars. MARSIS was funded by ASI (Italy) and NASA (USA).\n\nOn May 4, 2005, \"Mars Express\" deployed the first of its two 20-metre-long radar booms for the MARSIS experiment. At first the boom didn't lock fully into place; however, exposing it to sunlight for a few minutes on May 10 fixed the glitch. The second 20 m boom was successfully deployed on June 14. Both 20 m booms were needed to create a 40 m dipole antenna for MARSIS to work; a less crucial 7-meter-long monopole antenna was deployed on June 17. The radar booms were originally scheduled to be deployed in April 2004, but this was delayed out of fear that the deployment could damage the spacecraft through a whiplash effect. Due to the delay it was decided to split the four-week commissioning phase in two parts, with two weeks running up to July 4 and another two weeks in December 2005.\n\nThe deployment of the booms was a critical and highly complex task requiring effective inter-agency cooperation ESA, NASA, Industry and public Universities.\n\nMARSIS transmits a series of modulated chirps at frequencies between 1.8 and 5.0 MHz in subsurface sounding mode, with a 1 MHz bandwidth. It also emits chirps sweeping between 0.1 and 5.4 MHz when ionosphere sounding. Depending on mode the pulsewidth is 30, 91 or 250 μs and the nominal Pulse repetition frequency is 130 Hz. Transmitted power is either 1.5 or 5 W.\n\nNominal science observations began during July 2005.\n\nA 2012 paper by the MARSIS team measured a difference between the dielectric constant of the northern and southern high-latitude regions. This is evidence that the material that fills the northern basin is a lower-density material, which could be interpreted as evidence of an ancient northern ocean.\n\nUsing MARSIS data, 22 Italian scientists reported in July 2018 the discovery of a subglacial lake on Mars, below the southern polar ice cap, and extending horizontally about , the first known stable body of water on Mars.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1870317", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1870317", "title": "Bam Bam Bigelow", "text": "Bam Bam Bigelow\n\nScott Charles Bigelow (September 1, 1961 – January 19, 2007) was an American professional wrestler, better known by the ring name Bam Bam Bigelow. Recognizable by his close to 400-pound frame and the distinctive flame tattoo that spanned most of his bald head, Bigelow was hailed by former employer WWE in 2013 as \"the most natural, agile and physically remarkable big man of the past quarter century.\"\n\nBigelow is best known for his appearances with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), and World Championship Wrestling (WCW) between 1987 and 2001. Over the course of his career, he held championships including the ECW World Heavyweight Championship, the ECW World Television Championship, and the WCW World Tag Team Championship. Bigelow headlined various pay-per-views including the first Survivor Series in 1987, the first televised King of the Ring in 1993, WrestleMania XI, and the 1997 and 1998 editions of ECW's premier annual event, November to Remember.\n\nBigelow attended Neptune High School in Neptune Township, New Jersey, where he competed in scholastic wrestling.\n\nAfter training in Larry Sharpe's Monster Factory in New Jersey, Bigelow debuted as an athletic and agile monster heel in Jerry Lawler and Jerry Jarrett's Memphis, Tennessee-based Continental Wrestling Association promotion in the summer of 1986. Billed as \"the Beast of the East\" and referred to as \"The Bammer\" by announcer Lance Russell, Bigelow teamed with Jerry Lawler to feud with Austin Idol and Tommy Rich. Bigelow was featured in an article in the September 15, 1986 issue of \"Sports Illustrated\".\n\nIn late-1986, Bigelow wrestled in World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW) with a Russian gimmick under the name Crusher Yurkof.\n\nIn May 1987, he signed with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), making his debut on May 28 in Allentown, PA when he defeated Sivi Afi. Much like the recently signed Dingo Warrior, Bigelow would remain off television until the fall. The storyline upon his debut was that the various heel managers were all vying for Bigelow's services. The angle was thus called \"The Battle for Bam Bam”. Bigelow, in the end, wound up a babyface when he denounced all the heel managers and announced that his manager was going to be Oliver Humperdink. Fans were entertained by Bigelow's unique style and his remarkable speed and agility for a man his size. Indeed, Bam Bam utilized dropkicks and aerial moves, and would perform cartwheels to either dodge his opponents or just to dazzle the fans. His first WWF encounters were with Nikolai Volkoff and his jilted manager Slick, with Bigelow dominating their series of matches. He also racked up wins over King Kong Bundy, Harley Race, and Hercules Hernandez. Bigelow wrestled as a part of Hulk Hogan's team at the first Survivor Series, in which he survived longer than even Hogan (the biggest star in wrestling history at the time). He eliminated both King Kong Bundy and One Man Gang, but eventually lost to sole survivor André the Giant. He wrestled in the WWF for one year before leaving to have surgery on a badly injured knee. Bigelow lost by count-out to One Man Gang in the first round of WrestleMania IV's WWF World Heavyweight Championship tournament. Following the event, he began to feud against Gang and was dominant. Bigelow was defeated by Andre the Giant at Madison Square Garden on June 25. The match aired on Prime Time Wrestling on July 25, and this proved to be the last match in his initial WWF run.\n\nIn 1987 Bigelow made his New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) debut where he was known as Crusher Bam Bam Bigelow.\n\nThree months later Bigelow re-emerged with the NWA member Jim Crockett Promotions, appearing on the October 1 edition of World Championship Wrestling and facing Trent Knight. Again managed by Oliver Humperdink, he was immediately set up to challenge Barry Windham for the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship. While NWA wanted control of Bigelow, his loyalty was with New Japan, to whom he was committed. His final match was in January 1989, when he teamed with Lex Luger to defeat Abdullah the Butcher and Barry Windham.\n\nAfter this brief stay, Bigelow returned to Japan to work for the legendary Antonio Inoki's New Japan Pro-Wrestling. Here, he formed a tag team with Big Van Vader, winning the IWGP Tag Team Championship. He would return to WCW (JCP had been renamed by this point after Ted Turner purchased the company) briefly in 1990 as a heel, reunited with Humperdink (by this point going by the nickname \"The Big Kahuna\"), to aid Sullivan's Slaughterhouse (Kevin Sullivan, Cactus Jack, and Buzz Sawyer) in their feud with Captain Mike Rotundo, Norman the Lunatic, and Abdullah the Butcher. In 1992 he left New Japan, performing for several other Japanese professional wrestling promotions. His time in these promotions featured a win over Japanese wrestling legend Kenta Kobashi during a brief stint in All Japan Pro Wrestling.\n\nBigelow came back to the WWF as a heel on the October 31, 1992 edition of \"Prime Time Wrestling\", with a vignette hyping his return. On the November 28, 1992 episode of \"Superstars\", he defeated enhancement talent Jerry Fox in his first appearance with the company since 1988. In 1993, Bigelow made his pay-per-view return with a victory over The Big Boss Man at Royal Rumble. On the May 10 episode of \"Monday Night Raw\", Bigelow defeated Typhoon to qualify for the first-ever televised King of the Ring tournament. At the King of the Ring pay-per-view, Bigelow defeated Jim Duggan in the quarter-final round before losing to Bret Hart in the final. Soon after, Luna Vachon became Bigelow's (kayfabe) love interest and valet. Bigelow went on to feud with Tatanka and Doink the Clown. He teamed with The Headshrinkers against Tatanka and The Smoking Gunns in a losing effort at SummerSlam. Bigelow's team of The Headshrinkers and Bastion Booger was defeated by The Four Doinks (The Bushwhackers and Men on a Mission) at Survivor Series.\n\nBigelow began 1994 by replacing Ludvig Borga in a match against Tatanka at Royal Rumble. Tatanka won the match. Later that night, both men participated in the Royal Rumble match, where Bigelow eliminated Tatanka to end the feud. At WrestleMania X, Bigelow teamed with Luna to defeat Doink and Dink to conclude the rivalry with Doink.\n\nOn the May 16 episode of \"Raw\", Bigelow defeated Sparky Plugg to qualify for the 1994 King of the Ring tournament. He lost to Razor Ramon in the quarter-final at the eponymous pay-per-view. Bigelow's lack of success resulted in his breakup with Luna after his loss to Mabel on the June 27 episode of \"Monday Night Raw\" and he joined Ted DiBiase's new faction Million Dollar Corporation on the July 2 episode of \"Superstars\", thus becoming the second member of the group.\n\nOn the August 1 episode of \"Raw\", he was placed in a tag team with Corporation's newest acquisition Irwin R. Schyster and the two were announced as the next challengers for the Tag Team Championship on the August 6 episode of \"Superstars\". However, the champions The Headshrinkers dropped the titles before the scheduled title match at SummerSlam. The two teams still fought at the event, with Bigelow and IRS emerging victorious. At Survivor Series, Bigelow was part of Million $ Team with Heavenly Bodies and Corporation teammates King Kong Bundy and Tatanka against Guts and Glory (Lex Luger, Mabel, Adam Bomb and Smoking Gunns). Bigelow and Bundy were the survivors of the match.\n\nIn the fall of 1994, Bigelow and Tatanka participated in a tournament to crown the new Tag Team Champions, defeating Men on a Mission in the quarter-final and The New Headshrinkers in the semi-final matches on the December 17 and January 14, 1995 episodes of \"Superstars\" respectively. Bigelow and Tatanka ended up losing to Bob Holly and 1-2-3 Kid in the finals at Royal Rumble. Bigelow was mocked at ringside by former New York Giants All-Pro linebacker Lawrence Taylor. Bam Bam fought back, shoving Taylor at ringside, and was soon engaged in a highly publicized feud with the famous ex-football player. Bigelow was defeated by Taylor in the main event at WrestleMania XI. Shortly after WrestleMania, tensions were starting to build up between Bigelow and Ted DiBiase. After he failed to win the WWF Championship from Diesel on the April 24 episode of \"Raw\", DiBiase slapped him and led the entire Million Dollar Corporation to take him down including new member Sycho Sid. Diesel made the save and Bigelow turned babyface, publicly quitting the Million Dollar Corporation.\n\nHe teamed with Diesel to take on Corporation members Tatanka and Sid in a tag team match at King of the Ring, which Bigelow and Diesel won. Bigelow's feud with the Corporation continued for most of the summer of 1995 including a victory over Henry Godwinn at SummerSlam, Shortly towards end of the feud with the Corporation, Bigelow became more of a jobber to the stars and moved on to a rivalry with British Bulldog, which culminated in a loss for Bigelow at In Your House 3. Bigelow's last match in WWF was a loss to Goldust at Survivor Series. After rumored problems backstage with The Kliq, Bigelow left the WWF in late 1995.\n\nIn 1996, Bigelow returned to Japan to work for Genichiro Tenryu's Wrestle Association R. He would feud against Tenryu.\n\nBigelow made a few appearances in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) in early 1996, feuding with Taz and siding with Tod Gordon. He defeated Mick Foley at Just Another Night. Later in the year, Bigelow would face Terry Gordy. He won with the assistance of The Eliminators.\n\nHe returned to Paul Heyman's ECW in 1997, eventually joining with the Triple Threat faction, with Chris Candido and leader Shane Douglas. Bigelow made his in-ring debut in a tag team match at Chapter 2 on May 10, teaming with Douglas to defeat The Pitbulls. Bigelow made his televised debut on the June 26 episode of \"Hardcore TV\" in a six-man tag team match, in which Triple Threat defeated Balls Mahoney and The Pitbulls. Bigelow participated in his first singles match in ECW on the July 3 episode of \"Hardcore TV\", where he pinned Pitbull #2. Bigelow made his pay-per-view debut in a tag team match with Chris Candido at Heat Wave against Chris Chetti and Balls Mahoney, which Candido and Bigelow won.\nBigelow began a series of matches against Spike Dudley, with the two exchanging victories including one at the Hardcore Heaven pay-per-view, which Bigelow won. During the rivalry, Bigelow established himself as a dominant force in ECW, carrying out feats of strength such as hurling Dudley out of the ring and into the audience and slamming Taz through the ring itself.\n\nAs part of the Triple Threat group, Bigelow was quickly promoted to main event status by turning on fellow Triple Threat member Shane Douglas, as he was booked to win his first world championship by beating Douglas to win the World Heavyweight Championship under the guidance of Rick Rude on the October 24 episode of \"Hardcore TV\". As a result, Bigelow left Triple Threat and began feuding with his former stablemates. He retained the title against Douglas at Ultimate Jeopardy, before dropping the title back to Douglas at the November to Remember pay-per-view, ending the reign at 46 days. It turned out to be a classic match. Both men were so badly injured as a result of the match that they did not appear on ECW television for over a month.\n\nThey continued to feud, with Bigelow looking to Taz to join him in his campaign against the Triple Threat. At the Hostile City Showdown event in 1998, Bigelow and Taz took on Triple Threat in a handicap match, where he turned on Taz and rejoined the group as Triple Threat prospect Lance Storm was tossed aside. Triple Threat began a feud with Taz, Rob Van Dam and Sabu, which carried over throughout 1998. During this rivalry, Bigelow won the World Television Championship from Taz in his hometown of Asbury Park, New Jersey at the Living Dangerously pay-per-view. Bigelow successfully defended the title against The Sandman on the March 25 episode of \"Hardcore TV\" before dropping the title to Rob Van Dam, two weeks later on \"Hardcore TV\", ending the reign at just 34 days. After beating New Jack at Wrestlepalooza, Bigelow failed to capture the ECW FTW Heavyweight Championship from Taz in a falls count anywhere match at Heat Wave. The feud ended with a six-man tag team match between the two teams at November to Remember, in which Sabu, Taz and Van Dam defeated Triple Threat. Bigelow then left ECW.\n\nOn the November 16, 1998 episode of \"Monday Nitro\", Bigelow returned to World Championship Wrestling (WCW), interrupting a match between Scott Putski and Chavo Guerrero, Jr. and attacking both competitors. He was portrayed as an unwelcome guest from outside the company and confronted the World Heavyweight Champion Goldberg. His first WCW match was a no contest against Goldberg on December 12 on WCW Monday Nitro. After defeating Wrath in his WCW pay-per-view debut at the 1999 Souled Out event, Bigelow competed against Goldberg in a losing effort at SuperBrawl IX.\n\nHe was one of the wrestlers who developed WCW's hardcore division with a series of hardcore wrestling matches for the next few months including a triple threat falls count anywhere match with fellow ECW alumni Raven and Hardcore Hak at Uncensored in which Hak would emerge victorious and then Bigelow defeated Hak and Brian Knobbs in hardcore matches at Spring Stampede and Slamboree respectively.\n\nIn May 1999, Bigelow formed a tag team with Diamond Dallas Page and the duo entered competition for the World Tag Team Championship. On the May 31 episode of \"Nitro\", Page and Bigelow were booked to defeat Raven and Perry Saturn to win the tag team title for the first time after they attacked Raven before the match and his substitute Chris Kanyon turned on Saturn. The following week on \"Nitro\", Kanyon officially joined Page and Bigelow to form a stable, known as the Jersey Triad.\n\nPage and Bigelow dropped the titles to Saturn and Chris Benoit on the June 10 episode of \"Thunder\", after Saturn's original partner Ric Flair abandoned him and Benoit replaced Flair as Saturn's partner. As a result, Triad began an affiliation with Flair. Triad regained the tag titles when Page and Kanyon defeated Benoit and Saturn at The Great American Bash. Following their second reign, Triad executed the Freebird Rule in which any two members of the Triad could defend the title, allowing Bigelow to be recognized as champion and defend the title as well. Triad successfully defended the titles against Benoit and Saturn in a rematch at Bash at the Beach, before dropping the titles to Harlem Heat at Road Wild. Triad disbanded after Page's loss to Goldberg at Fall Brawl, with Bigelow moving to singles competition.\n\nFollowing the dissolution of Triad, Bigelow entered a tournament to crown a new World Heavyweight Champion, losing to Norman Smiley in the first round on the October 25 episode of \"Nitro\". Bigelow returned to the hardcore division and was booked to win the Hardcore Championship, his only singles title in WCW, from Brian Knobbs, on the February 7, 2000 episode of \"Nitro\", only to drop the title back to Knobbs at SuperBrawl 2000.\n\nBigelow began his next program with The Wall after Wall developed a sadistic streak and attacked younger wrestlers, including David Flair and Crowbar. This led to a series of matches between the two, which culminated at Uncensored where Wall and Bigelow fought in a match where The Wall put Bigelow through a table, resulting in a disqualification win for Bigelow.\n\nBigelow floundered into the mid-card and was rarely utilized in a major feud. He closed the year with a win over Sgt. AWOL at Mayhem and a loss to Mike Awesome in an ambulance match at Starrcade. In 2001, Bigelow began his final feud in WCW against Shawn Stasiak, resulting in a match between the two at WCW's final pay-per-view event \"Greed\", which Stasiak won. The pair ended their feud in a rematch on the final episode of \"Nitro\" on March 26. The stipulation of the match was that, if Bigelow won, he would tattoo \"that sweet thing\" in the ring (Stasiak accepted the stipulation, assuming he meant his valet Stacy Keibler when he was, in fact, referring to Stasiak himself). However, Stasiak won the match.\n\nBigelow remained with WCW until the company was purchased by the WWF in March 2001. Then, he waited until his Time Warner (the major corporation that had bought the promotion from Jim Crockett in 1989) contract expired in June 2002. He returned to the ring, making several appearances for USA Pro Wrestling. He performed his final wrestling match on November 7, 2006, for the American Combat Wrestling promotion, teaming with Ralph Mosca as \"The Syndicate\" in a tag team match defeating Overkill (Legion Cage and Marcus Hall).\n\nOn November 17, 1996, Bigelow competed in a \"U-Japan\" mixed martial arts event against Kimo Leopoldo. Bigelow was dominated throughout the match, being mounted within the first 10 seconds. He lost to a rear naked choke in the first round. Despite not being a trained mixed martial artist, Bigelow was able to command a substantial fee for the fight (Bigelow claimed in his 1998 RF Video shoot interview that he received $100,000; though it has been suggested by others that he actually received $75,000). Bigelow would later claim in a shoot interview that the fight was a work and he received minimal damage for a nice paycheck. He then claimed that he was the \"world's highest-paid jobber.\"\n\nIn 2000, Bigelow and his wife Dana Fisher, with whom he had four children, divorced. In 2005, Fisher sued Bigelow for non-payment of child support.\n\nOn July 4, 2000, Bigelow received second degree burns on 40% of his body while rescuing three children from a burning house near his home in Wayside, New Jersey during a barbecue cookout. Following the incident, Bigelow spent 10 days recovering in a hospital.\n\nUpon his retirement, Bigelow moved to a private recreational community called \"The Hideout\" in Lake Ariel, Pennsylvania. He also opened the eponymous Bam Bam Bigelow restaurant, located nearby in the town of Hamlin in Salem Township, but it later closed. He then relocated to Florida, with his close friend Shane Douglas clueless as to his whereabouts.\n\nIn May 2004, Bigelow was charged with endangering the welfare of a child through reckless driving. He attributed the incident to a seizure he had suffered, and the charges were dropped two months later.\n\nOn October 2, 2005, Bigelow was hospitalized with a broken nose and several lacerations after crashing his Harley-Davidson motorcycle in Spring Hill, Florida. Janis Remiesiewicz, Bigelow's girlfriend, was his passenger at the time of the crash, and she suffered severe injuries. A spokesman for the Florida Highway Patrol stated that Bigelow would be the focus of a homicide investigation should Remiesiewicz die, but she eventually made a complete recovery and remained with Bigelow until his death.\n\nIn his most profitable years as a wrestler, Bigelow earned between $750,000 and $1.2 million per year.\n\nOn the morning of January 19, 2007, Bigelow was found dead in his home by Remiesiewicz at approximately 10:00 a.m. EST in Hudson, Florida. He was 45 years old. The autopsy results showed that Bigelow's death was due to multiple drugs found in his system including toxic levels of cocaine and an anti-anxiety drug. Bigelow was also suffering from a heart problem, specifically arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and had severe back problems.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1870330", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1870330", "title": "International Revolutionary Marxist Centre", "text": "International Revolutionary Marxist Centre\n\nThe International Revolutionary Marxist Centre was an international association of left-socialist parties. The member-parties rejected both mainstream social democracy and the Third International.\n\nThe International was formed in 1932, following a fringe meeting at the Socialist International conference in Vienna in 1931. The IRMC underwent a variety of names. It was initially called the Committee of Independent Revolutionary Socialist Parties and later the International Bureau of Revolutionary Socialist Unity, but throughout the period it was generally known simply as the London Bureau (and nicknamed by some the 3½ International, in an analogy with the so-called 2½ International of 1921-3), although its headquarters were transferred from London to Paris in 1939 (on the grounds that in addition to the French affiliate, five parties-in-exile had their central committees there). Its youth wing was the International Bureau of Revolutionary Youth Organizations.\n\nFor a period, the IRMC was close to the Trotskyist movement and the International Left Opposition. In the early 1930s, Leon Trotsky and his supporters believed that Stalin's influence over the Third International could still be fought from within and slowly rolled back. They organised themselves into the International Left Opposition in 1930, which was intended to be a group of anti-Stalinist dissenters \"within\" the Third International. Stalin's supporters, who dominated the International, would no longer tolerate dissent. All Trotskyists, and those suspected of being influenced by Trotskyism, were expelled.\n\nTrotsky claimed that the Third Period policies of the Comintern had contributed to the rise of Adolf Hitler in Germany, and that its turn to a popular front policy (aiming to unite all ostensibly anti-fascist forces) sowed illusions in reformism and pacifism and \"clear[ed] the road for a fascist overturn\". By 1935 he claimed that the Comintern had fallen irredeemably into the hands of the Stalinist bureaucracy. He and his supporters, expelled from the Third International, participated in a conference of the London Bureau. Three of those parties joined the Left Opposition in signing a document written by Trotsky calling for a Fourth International, which became known as the \"Declaration of Four\". Of those, two soon distanced themselves from the agreement, but the Dutch Revolutionary Socialist Party worked with the International Left Opposition to declare the International Communist League.\n\nThe Spanish section merged with the Spanish section of ICO, forming the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM). Trotsky claimed the merger was to be a capitulation to centrism. The Socialist Workers' Party of Germany, a left split from the Social Democratic Party of Germany founded in 1931, co-operated with the International Left Opposition briefly in 1933 but soon abandoned the call for a new International.\n\nThe secretariat of the International Centre remained with the British Independent Labour Party (ILP) for all but one of the eight years 1932–1940. Fenner Brockway, ILP leader, was chairman of the Bureau for most of this period, while in 1939, Julián Gorkin of the POUM became its secretary. By this time, the Bureau had member parties in more than 20 countries, including the Netherlands, Austria, Czechoslovakia, the United States, and Palestine.\n\n\n\n\n"}

C. Fields and Bob Hope. Directed by Mitchell Leisen, the film is the last in a series of \"Big Broadcast\" movies that were variety show anthologies. This film featured the debut of Hope's signature song, \"Thanks for the Memory\" by Ralph Rainger.\n\nIn what is being billed as \"The Race of the Ages,\" the new forty-million-dollar “radio powered” Streamlined Ocean Liner S.S. \"Gigantic\" (“America’s Challenge for Crossing Record”) is about to race its rival, the slightly smaller S.S. \"Colossal\" across the Atlantic from New York’s Pier 97 to Cherbourg in two-and-a-half days. \"Gigantic\" owner T. Frothingill “T.F.” Bellows (W. C. Fields) intends to send his nearly identical younger brother S.B. (also Fields) to sail aboard the \"Colossal\", hoping he will cause trouble and sabotage the rival ship, enabling the \"Gigantic\" and his own Bellows Line to win.\n\nHowever S.B., who is held back due to a golf game, ends up flying over the ocean to meet the \"Colossal\" en route and mistakenly lands aboard the deck of the \"Gigantic\" instead, much to the consternation of Captain Stafford (Russell Hicks). Matters are made worse for the \"Gigantic\" when S.B.’s outrageously unlucky daughter Martha (Martha Raye) is brought onboard, being rescued after surviving the shipwreck of the yacht, \"Hesperus V.\"\n\nPopular OBC radio emcee Buzz Fielding (Bob Hope), who has just been released from “alimony jail” and is broadcasting live from the \"Gigantic\", is trying to juggle his three ex-wives Cleo (Shirley Ross), Grace (Grace Bradley), and Joan (Lorna Gray); his lukewarm girlfriend Dorothy Wyndham (Dorothy Lamour); and his inept microphone assistant Mike (Ben Blue). Buzz does his best throughout the voyage to announce the progress of the race and introduce a series of musical acts for the pleasure of the passengers and OBC’s radio audience.\n\nMeanwhile, Dorothy is romanced by First Officer (and inventor of the \"Gigantic\"’s enormous radio power plant) Robert Hayes (Leif Erickson), just as Buzz and Joan get sentimental about their broken marriage.\n\n\"In order of appearance\"\n\nThe screenplay is by Walter DeLeon, Ken Englund, and Francis Martin, based on an adaptation by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse, based on a story by Frederick Hazlitt Brennan.\n\nThe art direction is by Hans Dreier and Ernst Fegté, with interior decorations by A.E. Freudeman. Costumes were designed by Edith Head. The cartoon sequence integrated with the live action in the “Rippling Rhythm” sequence was directed by Leon Schlesinger.\n\nThe film was Hope's first feature film, and was the final film under Fields' long-running Paramount contract, before he moved to Universal Studios to make his final series of films.\n\nWhile the S.S. \"Colossal\" in the film appears to be similar to the 1935 steam turbo-electric-propelled passenger ship S.S. \"Normandie\" with its classic Art Deco French Line-styled exterior, the S.S. \"Gigantic\" is a Streamline Moderne futuristic-fantasy ship inside and out (based on Norman Bel Geddes \"Liner of the Future\"), with deck-mounted air propellers and diesel engines powered by remote controlled radio electricity capable of reaching 65 knots, a speed more than twice that of a real ocean liner of the time. Modern cruise ships have come to somewhat resemble the \"Gigantic\"'s glass-enclosed upper deck design.\n\nRalph Rainger and Leo Robin wrote six songs that appear in the film: “This Little Ripple Had Rhythm” (an instrumental composition); “Don’t Tell a Secret to a Rose;” “You Took the Words Right Out of My Heart;” “Thanks for the Memory;” “Mama, That Moon is Here Again;” and “The Waltz Lives On.”\n\nThe extended “The Waltz Lives On” sequence features musical sections from the ragtime “At a Georgia Camp-Meeting” written by Kerry Mills; and James P. Johnson’s jazz classic “The Charleston;” and a short swing lyric section called “Truckin’ (They’re Going Hollywood in Harlem)” written by Rube Bloom with lyrics Ted Koehler.\n\nBoris Morros provided the musical direction and Arthur Franklin was the musical adviser.\n\nRalph Rainger and Leo Robin won the 1939 Oscar for Best Song for their song, \"Thanks for the Memory,\" and the song later won an ASCAP Film and Television Music Award for \"Most Performed Feature Film Standard\" in 1989. The song is often regarded as a companion piece to \"Two Sleepy People,\" written in September 1938 by Hoagy Carmichael with lyrics by Frank Loesser, which was also performed by Bob Hope and Shirley Ross in the later film, \"Thanks for the Memory\" (1939).\n\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\n\nOn May 13, 2008, \"The New York Times\" reviewed a new DVD box set of Leisen titles, released by Universal, including \"Big Broadcast of 1938\", which is the only one of the \"Big Broadcast\" films to be released on VHS or DVD to date.\n\n\n\n"}

He is best known for working for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), where he is a former three-time X Division Champion and one-time NWA World Tag Team Champion, while also working on the American independent circuit. Figueroa is also the founder of House of Glory wrestling school, where is also one of the head trainers. He is the cousin of wrestlers Joel and Jose Maximo and Zelina Vega.\n\nFigueroa originally wrestled as Red, but Savio Vega decided to expand his ring name to include the word \"Amazing\" while he worked for the International Wrestling Association in Puerto Rico, giving origin to his more common pseudonym, Amazing Red.\n\nRed, who was already known for his work in the United States independent circuit, joined Total Nonstop Action Wrestling at its 2002 inception, quickly establishing himself in its X Division. During his first run in TNA Red held both the TNA X Division Championship and the NWA World Tag Team Championship with Jerry Lynn, simultaneously. While working for TNA he also wrestled for Ring of Honor as a member of the three-man tag team The S.A.T. with cousins, Jose and Joel Maximo. Eventually he began to team with \"The Phenomenal\" A.J. Styles, becoming known together as Amazing Phenomenon. The team would go on to win the ROH Tag Team Championship from Christopher Daniels and Donovan Morgan.\n\nThrough late 2003 Amazing Red wrestled as Misterio Red as well as Airwalk Spriggan while on a tour with All Japan Pro Wrestling. During the tour he suffered a near career-ending knee injury, tearing his anterior cruciate ligament and having to undergo surgery which kept him on the sideline for an entire year.\n\nRed returned to TNA to wrestle in March 2004, staying there for the majority of the year. When he left TNA he went back to the independents, only returning on occasion to TNA throughout 2005 and 2006. He also wrestled CM Punk in a dark match at a \"WWE SmackDown\" taping on May 12, 2005.\n\nRed's last appearance was at a New York Wrestling Connection event at the beginning of 2006, where he lost his match to Javi-Air and re-injured his knee.\n\nIt was made official on the Pro Wrestling Unplugged Website that he would be making his return to their \"Haunted\" event although he requested off since it was announced that his wife was expecting their child on March 14, 2008.\n\nAfter being on the sidelines with his injury, Red made his return on December 13, 2008, at Jersey All Pro Wrestling's Best of the Light Heavyweights, the match was won by Archadia as he defeated Amazing Red, Flip Kendrick, and Louis Lyndon.\n\nIn April 2009, it was announced via the TNA website that the Amazing Red would return to the company in the Team 3D Tag Team Invitational Tournament. On the April 30 edition of \"Impact!\" he teamed with then-X Division Champion Suicide to defeat the Motor City Machineguns of Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin.\n\nSuicide and Amazing Red were eliminated from the tournament on the May 14 episode of \"Impact!\" by the new stable, The British Invasion after interference from the Motor City Machineguns.\n\nOn the May 28 edition of \"Impact!\", he challenged Suicide for the X Division Championship but was unsuccessful in winning the title for a second time. Red competed in a Steel Asylum match at the Hard Justice Pay-Per-View on August 16, in another losing effort. On the October 1 edition of \"Impact!\" Red became the number one contender to Samoa Joe's X Division title by defeating Jay Lethal, Consequences Creed, Sheik Abdul Bashir and Kiyoshi in a ladder match. On the following \"Impact!\" Red won the X Division Championship for the second time by pinning Samoa Joe following interference by Bobby Lashley. On the October 15 edition of \"Impact!\" Don West debuted as Red's new manager. At Bound for Glory Red retained his X Division Title in an Ultimate X match against Homicide, Daniels, Suicide, Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin. The following week on \"Impact!\" Red lost to Homicide in a non-title match. The return match between the two was booked for Turning Point, where Red was able to retain his title. Afterwards Don West quietly broke off his affiliation with Red, while he went on to defend his title on TNA's weekly Webmatches against the likes of Chris Sabin and Homicide. At Genesis Red retained his title in a match against the returning Brian Kendrick. On the January 28 edition of \"Impact!\" the British Invasion attacked Red after his six-man tag team match. As Rob Terry was going to cash in his \"Feast or Fired\" briefcase, which gave him the right to challenge for the X Division Championship anytime, anywhere, his stable mate Doug Williams managed to convince him to hand it over to him and defeated Red to win the Championship. On the April 12 edition of \"Impact!\" Red took the place of the injured Hernandez and teamed up with Matt Morgan to successfully defend the TNA World Tag Team Championship against the Motor City Machineguns. After the match Morgan attacked Red for getting the pinfall in the match. After a few weeks out of action, Red returned to \"Impact!\" on the June 10 edition, in a losing effort against Kurt Angle. On September 23 Red defeated Jay Lethal at a live event in his hometown of New York City to win the X Division Championship for the third time. Red re-lost the title to Lethal two days later at a live event in Rahway, New Jersey. On the December 23 edition of \"Impact!\" Red answered Jeff Jarrett's MMA Challenge, but was defeated by submission. After the match Red told Jarrett that he had a younger brother, who would answer the challenge the following week. The following week Red's storyline brother, billed simply as Little Red (later renamed Crimson), answered the challenge and was winning his match against Jarrett, before Jarrett was pulled away from the ring by his security guards Gunner and Murphy. Shortly afterwards, Crimson broke away from Red and the relation between the two was seldom mentioned again.\n\nOn the April 19 edition of \"Xplosion\", Figueroa debuted as Sangriento, a masked luchador, in a three-way match, where he defeated Jay Lethal and Chris Sabin. Sangriento made his \"Impact!\" debut on May 5, defeating Suicide. After defeating Suicide in a rematch the following week, Sangriento was not seen again for two months, until appearing in a backstage segment with Eric Young at Destination X on July 10. At the same pay-per-view Amazing Red wrestled in an X Division number one contender's Ultimate X match, which was won by Alex Shelley, and which would turn out to be his final match for the promotion. On August 4, 2011, Figueroa announced via his Twitter account that he had parted ways with TNA.\n\nOn March 4, 2012, Red returned to Ring of Honor at the 10th Anniversary Show, where he teamed with T.J. Perkins in a losing effort against the House of Truth (Michael Elgin and Roderick Strong). In June 2012, Red wrestled a tryout dark match for WWE.\n\nOn April 1, 2019, Red announced his retirement from professional wrestling due to a severe neck injury. However, he would return to the ring only a few months later. In August 2019, Red was announced for the New Japan Pro-Wrestling Super J Cup that takes place in late-August. He would be defeated in the first round by the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion Will Ospreay. He would then be booked for the September U.S. tour Fighting Spirit Unleashed.\n\nAlso, Red opened his own training school, House of Glory. During his stint in the company, he became one-time HOG Tag Team Champion with his former teammate Crimson after defeating the Young Bucks. He also won the HOG Heavyweight Championship at House of Glory's \"High Intensity 6\" and would hold the title for a record setting 364 days. He lost the title almost a year later at \"High Intensity 7\" to Anthony Gangone in a No Ropes Match. Red would be forced to join the House of Gangone stable, and would then, of his own chose, turn heel by attacking two of his students, Private Party (Marq Quen & Isiah Cassady).\n\nRed is known for his high-flying style. He has been described as a pioneer and an innovator during the early 2000s. Pro wrestler Will Ospreay called him an inspiration.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1870352", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1870352", "title": "4-12-2", "text": "4-12-2\n\nUnder the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives, 4-12-2 represents the wheel arrangement of four leading wheels, twelve coupled driving wheels, and two trailing wheels. This arrangement was named the Union type, after the only railroad to use it, the Union Pacific Railroad.\n\nOther equivalent classifications are:\nAAR wheel arrangement: 2-F-1\nUIC classification: 2′F1′ (also known as German classification and Italian classification)\nFrench classification: 261\nTurkish classification: 69\nSwiss classification: 6/9\n\nOnly one type of locomotive with a 4-12-2 wheel arrangement was built: the Union Pacific Railroad's 9000-series locomotives, 88 of which were built by ALCO between 1926 and 1930. These locomotives were used to increase the speed of freight trains in flat country, and were fairly successful, but were maintenance nightmares, largely because of their use of an inside third cylinder driving the cranked second driving axle between the frames. There was no inside valve gear to worry about, however. ALCO had obtained permission to use the conjugated valve gear invented by Sir Nigel Gresley. This system used two hinged levers connected to the outer cylinder's valves to operate the inner cylinder's valve. The 9000 class locomotives were the largest to use Gresley gear.\n\nBetween 1934 and 1940 eight of the first fifteen locos had their Gresley gear removed and were converted to a \"double Walschaerts\" valve gear which utilized a double eccentric (return) crank and second link on the right side (similar to the gear Baldwin used on its 3-cylinder experimental compound 4-10-2 #60000), which operated the valve for the inside cylinder. Union Pacific referred to this system as the \"third link.\" The 4-12-2's constructed from 1928 utilized roller bearings in the Gresley lever bearings, thus none of these engines were converted. The pre-1928 engines not converted received the roller bearing levers in 1940, and no further conversions were made.\n\nDuring design the third and fourth driving axles were planned to be \"blind\" (flangeless) in order to improve curve handling, but ALCO's lateral motion devices on the first and sixth axles (which allowed the axles to slide up to two inches to the side) made this unnecessary. They had the longest rigid wheelbase in North America, and the longest in the world until the Soviet Union built their 4-14-4 locomotive in 1934. The trailing truck carried the same axle load as the drivers, which was unusual.\n\nThere has been debate as to whether the first driving axle of the 4-12-2 was cranked to provide clearance for the main rod connected to the second axle. Union Pacific drawings show no such crank on the first axle, and the \"Railway Age\" article says \"The drivers permit the use of a straight axle on the front drivers...\" The spacing between the first and second axles was increased by to provide clearance. Based on the published dimensions, this means at its closest the centerline of the inside rod was from the centerline of the first axle. (UP drawings reproduced in Kratville and Bush's \"Union Pacific Type\" books show the inside rod long and the first and second driver axles apart. The inside cylinder axis was inclined 9.5 degrees and was above the plane of the driving axles at a point ahead of the second driving axle, so the cylinder axis missed the centerline of the second axle by 1-11/16 inches. The rod centerline is closest to the axle when the crank is 54.49 degrees below horizontal.)\n\nOnly one example has survived into preservation. Union Pacific 9000 is preserved at the Railway and Locomotive Historical Society's museum at the Los Angeles County Fairplex in Pomona, California. It received a new boiler paint job in 2006-2007.\n\n"}

He competes in Lucha Libre USA as Chi Chi.\n\nHe first appeared in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) as Allan Funk, wrestling on \"Saturday Night\" and \"WorldWide\" against opponents such as Sonny Siaki. Soon after his debut, Allan had a brief feud with Barry Horowitz, he then teamed with \"Above Average\" Mike Sanders, as the Re-Enforcers. The team dissolved after both men got brought to \"WCW Monday Nitro\".\n\nUpon his graduation from the WCW Power Plant in 1998, Funk was moved up to the main roster and given a left field gimmick as an eccentric dressed all in pink, and given the ring name Kwee Wee. Contrary to popular belief Kwee Wee was not a homosexual, as demonstrated by his physical interactions with manager Paisley.\nNear the end of WCW's existence, Kwee Wee developed an aggressive alter-ego named \"Angry Allan\", whom Kwee Wee would suddenly \"turn into\" in the event he was angered, a gimmick similar to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde or The Incredible Hulk. He feuded with Prince Iaukea, Elix Skipper and The Natural Born Thrillers.\n\nKwee Wee Featured in the opening match of the March 18, 2001 Pay Per View WCW Greed. Unfortunately it was a losing effort as Jason Jett defeated him on the first and last Greed Pay Per View.\n\nHe was signed by the WWE after the 2001 WCW buyout, but was never featured on WWE television and was quickly released.\n\nHe then appeared in World Wrestling All-Stars as \"The Funkster\", an impression of \"The Hulkster\" Hulk Hogan.\n\nFunk joined Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) on June 19, 2002 as Bruce, a \"homosexual\" gimmick, forming a short-lived tag team with Lenny Lane known as The Rainbow Express. The team split on November 20, 2002. Bruce also won the Miss TNA Championship on July 31, 2002.\n\nOn September 27, 2003 at the Baltic Brawl event in Helsinki, Finland, Funk wrestled a tag team match with Mike Sanders against Elix Skipper and Sonny Siaki. During that match, Siaki botched a split-legged moonsault and landed on Funk's face knee-first. Funk was badly injured, breaking his eardrum, nose and jaw, also cracking his orbital bone. He has had four surgeries to repair the damage and is still 100% deaf in his left ear, but he made an otherwise full recovery.\n\nFunk resumed wrestling on the independent circuit in 2005, including an appearance in Vince Russo's Ring of Glory promotion as Queen Herod. He also wrestled numerous matches in the NWA Anarchy/Wildside promotion in Cornelia, Georgia.\n\nFunk made his debut in All Japan Pro Wrestling. He had matches with The Great Muta, Kaz Hayashi, Kojima, Taiyo Kea and Kawada. He teamed up with Jerry Tuite, Elix Skipper, Kea and Mike Awesome.\n\nIn July 2010, Funk began working under the name Chi Chi of the \"Exótico\" division for MTV2's wrestling TV project Lucha Libre USA: Masked Warriors, playing a parody of Lady Gaga. He made his debut on the first episode on July 16 along with his best friend Tigresa Caliente.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1870369", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1870369", "title": "Prostitution in Japan", "text": "Prostitution in Japan\n\nProstitution in Japan has existed throughout the country's history. While the Anti-Prostitution Law of 1956 states that \"No person may either do prostitution or become the customer of it\", loopholes, liberal interpretations and loose enforcement of the law have allowed the sex industry to prosper and earn an estimated 2.3 trillion yen ($24 billion) per year.\n\nThe term is used to describe prostitution in Japan, though the terms are not always synonymous.\n\nSince Japanese law defines prostitution as \"intercourse with an unspecified person in exchange for payment\", most \"fūzoku\" services offer specifically non-coital services, such as conversation, dancing or bathing, sometimes accompanied by sexual acts that legally are not defined as \"intercourse\", in order to remain legal.\n\nFrom the 15th century, Chinese, Koreans, and other East Asian visitors frequented brothels in Japan.\n\nThis practice later continued among visitors from \"the Western regions\", mainly European traders who often came with their South Asian \"lascar\" crew (in addition to African crew members, in some cases). This began with the arrival of Portuguese ships to Japan in the 1540s, when the local Japanese people assumed that the Portuguese were from \"Tenjiku\" (天竺, \"Heavenly Abode\"), the ancient Chinese name, thus later Japanese name, for the Indian subcontinent, and thus that Christianity was a new \"Indian faith\". These mistaken assumptions were due to the Indian state of Goa being a central base for the Portuguese East India Company and due to a significant portion of the crew on Portuguese ships being Indian Christians.\n\nPortuguese visitors and their South Asian and African crew members often engaged in slavery in Japan. They bought or captured young Japanese women and girls, who were either used as sexual slaves on their ships or taken to Macau and other Portuguese colonies in Southeast Asia, the Americas, and India, where there was a community of Japanese slaves and traders in Goa by the early 17th century. Later European East India Companies, including those of the Dutch and British, were involved in prostitution while visiting or staying in Japan.\n\nIn 1505 Japan received syphilis, likely because of Japanese prostitutes having sex with Chinese sailors. In Sakai and Hakata ports Japanese brothels had already been patronized by Chinese visitors far before Europeans came to Japan. When the Europeans (Nanbanjin) came to Japan, they too patronized Japanese prostitutes.\n\nIn 1617, the Tokugawa Shogunate issued an order restricting prostitution to certain areas on the outskirts of cities, known as . The three most famous were Yoshiwara in Edo (present-day Tokyo), Shinmachi in Osaka, and Shimabara in Kyoto.\n\nProstitutes and courtesans were licensed as \"yūjo\" (), \"women of pleasure\", and ranked according to an elaborate hierarchy, with \"tayū\" and later \"oiran\" at the apex. The districts were walled and guarded for taxation and access control. The prostitutes were rarely allowed out of the walls, except to visit dying relatives and, once a year, for \"hanami\" (viewing cherry blossoms).\n\nJapanese women engaged in sexual relations with foreign men like Chinese and Europeans at Hirado. In 1609 a post was set up there by the Dutch East India Company. Girls who were unmarried could be rented for a few months or weeks from her parents by stranded foreign sailors stuck there during typhoons. She would then retire from prostitution and then marry after getting a trousseau from the money she earned from sex work over several summers. Some Japanese women married the foreign traders or became their concubines for long term relationships. There were many choices in how to engage in relations between Japanese females and foreign men. leading to some strange situations. Two Japanese women bore daughters at the same time to Dutch merchant Cornelis van Nijenroode who in 1623 was made the Dutch trading posts' chief factor. Zheng Chenggong (Coxinga) was born to a Japanese woman and the Chinese Hokkien trader Zheng Zhilong. Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu had hired William Adams (sailor, born 1564), an Englishman who had in Hirado a Japanese concubine and also another Japanese woman as a wife, a daughter of a headman of a post-station in Honshu.\n\nChinese men visiting Edo period Tokugawa shogunate Japan patronized Japanese sex workers in brothels who were designated for them. Japanese women designated for Chinese male customers were known as Kara-yuki while Japanese women designated for Dutch men at Dejima were known as Oranda-yuki while Japanese women servicing Japanese men were called Nihon-yuki. Karayuki-san was then used for all Japanese women serving foreigners in sexual capacities during the Meiji period. The Japanese girls were offered to Japanese and Chinese customers at a low fee but the price of Japanese girls for Dutch sutomers was expensive and higher. Dutch traders were confined to the designated post at Dejima where Oranda-yuki prostitutes were sent. Initially Chinese men were much less restricted than the Dutch were at Dejimi, Chinese men could live all over Nagasaki and besides having sex with the kara-yuki Japanese prostitutes, the Chinese men could have sex with ordinary Japanese women since 1635 unlike Dutch men who were limited to prostitutes. Later the rules that applied to Dutch were applied to Chinese and Chinese were put in Jūzenji-mura into Tōjun-yashiki, a Chinese settlement in 1688 so they would have sex with the Kara-yuki Japanese prostitutes sent to them. Chinese men developed long term romances with the Japanese girls like the Chinese Suzhou (Su-chou) merchant Chen Renxie (Ch’ên Jên-hsieh) 陳仁謝 with the Japanese Azuyama girl Renzan 連山 who both committed suicide in a lover's pact in 1789, and the Chinese He Minde (Ho Min-tê) 何旻德 who pledged eternal love in Yoriai-machi with the Chikugoya Japanese girl Towa 登倭. She killed herself to join him in death when he was executed for forgery in 1690. The Chinese men were generous with their expensive presents to the Japanese girls and were praised by them for it. The Japanese girls violated Japan's laws which only permitted each to spend one night in the Chinese settlement by retracing their steps after reporting to the guards when they left the gate open in the morning. The Japanese issued laws and regulations considering the mixed children born to Japanese women from Maruyama and the foreigner Dutch and Chinese men in the Shōtoku era (1711-1716). The mixed children had to stay in Japan and could not be taken back to China or the Dutch country but their fathers could fund the children's education. The boy Kimpachi 金八 was born to the Iwataya Japanese girl Yakumo 八 and the Nanking Chinese captain Huang Zheqing 黃哲卿 (Huang Chê-ch’ing). He requested a permit from the Chief Administrator's Office of Nagasaki to trade goods to create a fund his son could live on for all his life, after coming back to Nagasaki at age 71 in 1723. A Hiketaya Japanese girl in Sodesaki 袖笑 gave birth to a son fathered by the Chinese Jiang Yunge 江芸閣 (Chiang Yün-ko) (Xinyi, Hsin-i 辛夷), a poet, painter and sea captain. Yanagawa Seigan and Rai Sanyu were his friends. Chinese dishes, delicacies, sweets and candies were introduced to Japan by Chinese men teaching their Japanese prostitute lover girls how to make them. In the Genroku era (1688-1704) a Chinese instructed the Japanese prostitute Ume how to make plum blossom shaped sugar and rice flour soft sweet called kōsakō. Her name also meant plum blossom. The songs were sung in the Tōsō-on The Kagetsu Entertainment (Kagetsu yokyō) booklet contained information about songs the Chinese men taught to their Japanese prostitute lovers showing that they were sang in Tōsō-on with instruments like hu-kung (two-stringed violin), ch’i-hsien-ch’in (seven-stringed dulcimer) and yüeh-ch’in (lute). The Japanese prostitutes of Maruyama who served the Chinese men in Nagasaki were taught dance, songs and music of Chinese origin. The gekkin (yüeh-ch’in) were used to play these Kyūrenhwan songs. The Kankan-odori dance accompanied one of these songs which spread in Edo and Kyōto as it gained fame. Exhibitions of the original Chinese style dance were performed in Edo by arranging for the sending of Nagasaki officials managing Chinese affairs and geisha to be sent there by Takahashi Sakuzaemon (1785-1829) who was the court astronomer of the Shogunate. He became famous due to the Siebold Incident. Later on the prostitutes were sent to service the Dutch at Dejima after they serviced Chinese at Maruyama being paid for by the Commissioners for Victualing. The Japanese prostitutes were provided by the Japanese government to Deshima where the Dutch were confined.\n\nThe opening of Japan and the subsequent flood of Western influences into Japan brought about a series of changes in the Meiji period. Japanese novelists, notably Higuchi Ichiyō, started to draw attention to the confinement and squalid existence of the lower-class prostitutes in the red-light districts. In 1872, the María Luz Incident led Government of Meiji Japan to make a new legislation, emancipating \"burakumin\" outcasts, prostitutes and other forms of bonded labor in Japan. The emancipating law for prostitution was named \"Geishōgi kaihō rei\" (). In 1900, the Japanese Government promulgated Ordinance No. 44, \"Shōgi torishimari kisoku\" (), restricting the labor conditions of prostitution. The restriction neither reduced the total number of prostitution nor granted more liberty to women. Instead, prostitution thrived under the Meiji government. The name: “kingdom of whoring” (baishun o¯koku) was to describe Japan during the Meiji Period. Due to the development of the modern transportation system, the demand and the supply of prostitution increased, and the population of the female population drastically increased. The government, therefore, with the legislation, could legally collect taxation from prostitution. Rather than improving human rights or liberty, the legislation intended to facilitate government revenue. The prostitution industry contributed a large part of government revenue from the late Tokugawa period to the Meiji period.\n\nIn 1908, the Ministry of Home Affairs' Ordinance No. 16 penalized unregulated prostitution.\n\n\"Karayuki-san\" was the name given to Japanese girls and women in the late 19th and early 20th centuries who were trafficked from poverty stricken agricultural prefectures in Japan to destinations in East Asia, Southeast Asia, Siberia (Russian Far East), Manchuria, and British India to serve as prostitutes and sexually serviced men from a variety of races, including Chinese, Europeans, native Southeast Asians, and others.\n\nImmediately after World War II, the Recreation and Amusement Association was formed by Naruhiko Higashikuni's government to organize brothels to serve the Allied armed forces occupying Japan. On August 19, 1945, the Home Ministry ordered local government offices to establish a prostitution service for Allied soldiers to preserve the \"purity\" of the Japanese race. This prostitution system was similar to the comfort system, because the Japanese police force was responsible for mobilizing the women to serve in these stations similarly to the way that Japanese Military during the Pacific War mobilized women. The police forces mobilized both licensed and unlicensed prostitutes to serve in these camps. The official declaration stated that \"Through the sacrifice of thousands of 'Okichis' of the Shōwa era, we shall construct a dike to hold back the mad frenzy of the occupation troops and cultivate and preserve the purity of our race long into the future.\" Such clubs were soon established by cabinet councilor Yoshio Kodama and Ryoichi Sasakawa.\n\nSCAP abolished the licensed prostitution system (including the RAA) in 1946, which led to the so-called system, under which licensed nightlife establishments offered sexual services under the guise of being an ordinary club or cafe. Local police authorities traditionally regulated the location of such establishments by drawing red lines on a map. In other areas, so-called \"blue line\" establishments offered sexual services under the guise of being restaurants, bars or other less strictly-regulated establishments. In Tokyo, the best-known \"red line\" districts were Yoshiwara and Shinjuku 2-chome, while the best-known \"blue line\" district was Kabuki-cho.\n\nIn 1947, Imperial Ordinance No. 9 punished persons for enticing women to act as prostitutes, but prostitution itself remained legal. Several bills were introduced in the Diet to add further legal penalties for soliciting prostitutes but were not passed due to disputes over the appropriate extent of punishment.\n\nOn May 24, 1956, the Diet of Japan passed the Anti-Prostitution Law, which came into force in April 1958. The Anti-Prostitution Law criminalized the act of committing sexual intercourse in exchange for actual or promised compensation. This eliminated the \"red line\" and \"blue line\" systems and allowed a number of paid sexual services to continue under \"sexual entertainment\" regulations, e.g., \"soaplands\" and \"fashion health\" parlors.\n\nIn 2013, Toru Hashimoto, co-leads the Japan Restoration Party proposed \"There are places where people can legally release their sexual energy in Japan\", and \"Unless they make use of these facilities, it will be difficult to control the sexual energies of the wild Marines.\" The U.S. Department of State later criticized Hashimoto's remarks.\n\nThe Shinto faith does not regard sex as a taboo. Sacred prostitution was even once practised by the Miko within traditional, pre-Meiji Shinto.\n\nBuddhist teachings regarding sex are quite reserved: \"It is true to say that Buddhism, in keeping with the principle of the Middle Way, would advocate neither extreme puritanism nor extreme permissiveness.\" Buddhism has rules and protocols for those that are to live the Buddhist principles in the monasteries and the secular part of the [Shanga]. For the Buddhist monks or nuns, chastity is mandatory since they live on the premise of getting rid of any feelings of attachment. Their way of living is regulated by very strict rules concerning behavior and this includes sex.\n\nAs for the secular Buddhists, there are no specific rules to be followed about sex; although any kind of abuse is regarded as \"misconduct\".\n\nArticle 3 of the of 1956 states that \"No person may either do prostitution or become the customer of it\", but no judicial penalty is defined for this act. Instead, the following are prohibited on pain of penalty: soliciting for purposes of prostitution, procuring a person for prostitution, coercing a person into prostitution, receiving compensation from the prostitution of others, inducing a person to be a prostitute by paying an \"advance\", concluding a contract for making a person a prostitute, furnishing a place for prostitution, engaging in the business of making a person a prostitute, and the furnishing of funds for prostitution.\n\nThe definition of prostitution is strictly limited to coitus with an \"unspecified person\". This means sale of numerous acts such as oral sex, anal sex, mammary intercourse and other non-coital sex acts are legal. Paid sex between \"specified persons\" (acquaintances) is not prohibited. Soaplands exploit this by providing a massage, during which the prostitute and client become \"acquainted\", as a preliminary to sexual services.\n\nThe , also known as the \"Law to Regulate Adult Entertainment Businesses\", amended in 1985, 1999 and 2005, regulates these businesses.\n\nThe sex industry in Japan uses a variety of names. Soaplands are bath houses where customers are soaped up and serviced by staff. Fashion health shops and pink salons are notionally massage or esthetic treatment parlors; image clubs are themed versions of the same. Call girls operate via delivery health services. Freelancers can get in contact with potential customers via deai sites (Internet dating sites), and the actual act of prostitution is legally called \"enjo kōsai\" or \"compensated dating\" to avoid legal trouble.\n\nKabukicho, an entertainment and red-light district in Shinjuku, Tokyo, measures only 0.34 km, and has approximately 3,500 sex parlors, strip theaters, peep shows, \"soaplands\", 'lovers' banks, porno shops, sex telephone clubs, karaoke bars and clubs, etc.\n\nIt was reported in 2003 that as many as 150,000 non-Japanese women were then involved in prostitution in Japan. According to National Police Agency records, out of 50 non-Japanese people arrested for prostitution offences (売春防止法違反) in 2013, 31 (62%) were mainland Chinese, 13 (26%) were Koreans and 4 (8%) were Thai.\nAccording to National Police Agency records, out of 224 non-Japanese people arrested for prostitution offences (風営適正化法) in 2018, 160 (71%) were mainland Chinese, 19 (8%) were Thai.\n\nMany businesses related to prostitution voluntarily (i.e. despite there being no regulation requiring it) ban entry to foreigners, including tourists, people who cannot speak Japanese, and even people who do not have Asian traits. However in recent years, several businesses have been set up to specifically cater to the foreigner market.\n\nIn Tokyo, prostitution dates back several hundred years. In the early 17th century, the first attempts were made to regulate prostitution in the Yoshiwara district of Edo (present-day Tokyo). A law was passed that required prostitutes to register and work in secured facilities, its main purpose being for tax collection.\n\nBecause of Tokyo's position as a top five global business and trade city, prostitution continues to thrive in Tokyo.\n\nSeveral terms have been used as euphemisms for the sex industry in Japan:\n\n\n\n\nJapan is a destination, source, and transit country for men, women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Men, women, and children from Northeast Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, South America, and Africa travel to Japan for employment or fraudulent marriage and are subjected to sex trafficking. Traffickers use fraudulent marriages between foreign women and Japanese men to facilitate the entry of women into Japan for forced prostitution in bars, clubs, brothels, and massage parlors. Traffickers keep victims in forced prostitution using debt bondage, threats of violence or deportation, blackmail, passport retention, and other psychologically coercive methods. Brothel operators sometimes arbitrarily impose \"fines\" on victims for alleged misbehavior as a tactic to extend their indebtedness. Trafficking victims reportedly transit Japan before being exploited in onward destinations, including East Asia and North America.\n\nJapanese citizens—particularly runaway teenage girls—are also subjected to sex trafficking. Enjo kosai, also known as \"compensated dating\", and variants of the \"JK\" business continue to facilitate the sex trafficking of Japanese children. Highly organized prostitution networks target vulnerable Japanese women and girls—often living in poverty or with cognitive disabilities—in public spaces such as subways, popular youth hangouts, schools, and online, and subject them to sex trafficking. Private Japanese immigration brokers help Japanese-Filipino children and their Filipina mothers move to Japan and acquire citizenship for a significant fee, which the mothers often incur large debts to pay; upon arrival, some of these women and their children are subjected to sex trafficking to pay off the debts.\n\nThe United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Japan as a 'Tier 1' country.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1870398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1870398", "title": "Geotagging", "text": "Geotagging\n\nGeotagging, or GeoTagging, is the process of adding geographical identification metadata to various media such as a geotagged photograph or video, websites, SMS messages, QR Codes or RSS feeds and is a form of geospatial metadata. This data usually consists of latitude and longitude coordinates, though they can also include altitude, bearing, distance, accuracy data, and place names, and perhaps a time stamp.\n\nGeotagging can help users find a wide variety of location-specific information from a device. For instance, someone can find images taken near a given location by entering latitude and longitude coordinates into a suitable image search engine. Geotagging-enabled information services can also potentially be used to find location-based news, websites, or other resources. Geotagging can tell users the location of the content of a given picture or other media or the point of view, and conversely on some media platforms show media relevant to a given location.\n\nThe related term geocoding refers to the process of taking non-coordinate based geographical identifiers, such as a street address, and finding associated geographic coordinates (or vice versa for reverse geocoding). Such techniques can be used together with geotagging to provide alternative search techniques.\n\nGeotagging is a popular feature on several social media platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram.\n\nFacebook users can geotag photos that can be added to the page of the location they are tagging. Users may also use a feature that allows them to find nearby Facebook friends by generating a list of people according to the location tracker in their mobile devices.\n\nInstagram uses a map feature that allows users to geotag photos. The map layout pin points specific photos that the user has taken on a world map.\n\nThe geographical location data used in geotagging can, in almost every case, be derived from the global positioning system, and based on a latitude/longitude-coordinate system that presents each location on the earth from 180° west through 180° east along the Equator and 90° north through 90° south along the prime meridian.\n\nTwo main options can be used to geotag photos: capturing GPS information at the time the photo is taken or \"attaching\" geocoordinates to the photograph after the picture is taken.\n\nIn order to capture GPS data at the time the photograph is captured, the user must have a camera with built in GPS or a standalone GPS along with a digital camera. Because of the requirement for wireless service providers in United States to supply more precise location information for 911 calls by September 11, 2012, more and more cell phones have built-in GPS chips. Most smart phones already use a GPS chip along with built-in cameras to allow users to automatically geotag photos. Others may have the GPS chip and camera but do not have internal software needed to embed the GPS information within the picture. A few digital cameras also have built-on or built-in GPS that allow for automatic geotagging.\n\nDevices use GPS, A-GPS or both. A-GPS can be faster getting an initial fix if within range of a cell phone tower, and may work better inside buildings. Traditional GPS does not need cell phone towers and uses standard GPS signals outside of urban areas. Traditional GPS tends to use more battery power. Almost any digital camera can be coupled with a stand-alone GPS and post processed with photo mapping software, to write the location information to the image's exif header.\n\nGPS coordinates may be represented in text in a number of ways, with more or fewer decimals:\n\nWith photos stored in JPEG, TIFF and many other file formats, the geotag information, storing camera location and sometimes heading, is typically embedded in the metadata, stored in Exchangeable image file format (Exif) or Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP) format. These data are not visible in the picture itself but are read and written by special programs and most digital cameras and modern scanners. Latitude and longitude are stored in units of degrees with decimals. This geotag information can be read by many programs, such as the cross-platform open source ExifTool. An example readout for a photo might look like:\n\nor the same coordinates could also be presented as decimal degrees:\n\nWhen stored in Exif, the coordinates are represented as a series of rational numbers in the GPS sub-IFD. Here is a hexadecimal dump of the relevant section of the Exif metadata (with big-endian byte order):\n\nIn the field of remote sensing the geotagging goal is to store coordinates of every pixel in the image. One approach is used with the orthophotos where we store coordinates of four corners and all the other pixels can be georeferenced by interpolation. The four corners are stored using GeoTIFF or World file standards. Hyperspectral images take a different approach defining a separate file of the same spatial dimensions as the image where latitude and longitude of each pixel are stored as two 2D layers in so called \"Input geometry data\" (IGM) files, also known as GEO files.\n\nAudio/video files can be geotagged via: metadata, audio encoding, overlay, or with companion files. Metadata records the geospatial data in the encoded video file to be decoded for later analysis. One of the standards used with unmanned aerial vehicle is which allows geocoding of corner points and horizon lines in individual video frames. Audio encoding involves a process of converting gps data into audio data such as modem squawk. Overlay involves overlaying GPS data as text on the recorded video. Companion files are separate data files which correspond to respective audio/video files. Companion files are typically found in the .KML and .GPX data formats. For audio and video files which use the vorbiscomment metadata format (including Opus, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, Speex, and Ogg Theora), there is a proposed GEO LOCATION field which can be used. Like all vorbis comments, it is plain text, and it takes the form:\n\ncodice_25\n\nfor example:\n\ncodice_26\n\nThe GeoSMS standard works by embedding one or more 'geo' URIs in the body of an SMS, for example:\n\nRFC 1876 defines a means for expressing location information in the Domain Name System. LOC resources records can specify the latitude, longitude, altitude, precision of the location, and the physical size of on entity attached to an IP address. However, in practice not all IP addresses have such a record, so it is more common to use geolocation services to find the physical location of an IP address.\n\nThe GeoURL method requires the ICBM tag (plus optional Dublin Core metadata), which is used to geotag standard web pages in HTML format:\nThe similar Geotag format allows the addition of place name and region tags:\nThe RDF method is defined by W3 Group and presents the information in RDF tags:\n<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\"\n</rdf:RDF>\nThe Geo microformat allows coordinates within HyperText Markup Language pages to be marked up in such a way that they can be \"discovered\" by software tools. Example:\nA proposal has been developed to extend Geo to cover other bodies, such as Mars and the Moon.\n\nAn example is the Flickr photo-sharing Web site, which provides geographic data for any geotagged photo in all of the above-mentioned formats.\n\nNo industry standards exist, however there are a variety of techniques for adding geographical identification metadata to an information resource. One convention, established by the website Geobloggers and used by more and more sites, e.g. photo sharing sites Panoramio and Flickr, and the social bookmarking site del.icio.us, enables content to be found via a location search. Such sites allow users to add metadata to an information resource via a set of so-called \"machine tags\" (see folksonomy).\n\nThis describes the geographic coordinates of a particular location in terms of latitude (codice_31) and longitude (codice_32). These are expressed in decimal degrees in the WGS84 datum, which has become something of a default geodetic datum with the advent of GPS.\n\nUsing three tags works within the constraint of having tags that can only be single 'words'. Identifying geotagged information resources on sites like Flickr and del.icio.us is done by searching for the 'geotagged' tag, since the tags beginning codice_33 and codice_34 are necessarily very variable.\n\nAnother option is to tag with a Geohash:\n\nA further convention proposed by FlickrFly adds tags to specify the suggested viewing angle and range when the geotagged location is viewed in Google Earth:\n\nThese three tags would indicate that the camera is pointed heading 225° (south west), has a 45° tilt and is 560 metres from the subject.\n\nWhere the above methods are in use, their coordinates may differ from those specified by the photo's internal Exif data, for example because of a correction or a difference between the camera's location and the subject's.\n\nIn order to integrate geotags in social media and enhance text readability or oral use, the concept of 'meetag' or tag-to-meet has been proposed. Differing from hashtag construction, meetag includes the geolocation information after an underscore. A meetag is therefore a word or an unspaced phrase prefixed with an underscore (\"_\"). Words in messages on microblogging and social networking services may be tagged by putting \"_\" before them, either as they appear in a sentence, (e.g. \"There is a concert going _montreuxjazzfestival\", \"the world wide web was invented _cern _geneve\", ...) or appended to it.\n\nGeoblogging attaches specific geographic location information to blog entries via \"geotags\". Searching a list of blogs and pictures tagged using geotag technology allows users to select areas of specific interest to them on interactive maps.\n\nThe progression of GPS technology, along with the development of various online applications, has fueled the popularity of such tagged blogging, and the combination of GPS phones and GSM localization, has led to the moblogging, where blog posts are tagged with exact position of the user. Real-time geotagging relays automatically geotagged media such as photos or video to be published and shared immediately.\n\nFor better integration and readability of geotags into blog texts, the meetag syntax has been proposed, which transforms any word, sentence, or precise geolocalization coordinates prefixed with an underscore into a 'meetag'. It not only lets one express a precise location but also takes in account dynamically changing geolocations.\n\nOne of the first attempts to initiate the geotagging aspect of searching and locating articles seems to be the now-inoperative site Wikinear.com, launched in 2008, which showed the user Wikipedia pages that are geographically closest to one's current location.\n\nThe 2009 app Cyclopedia works relatively well showing geotagged Wikipedia articles located within several miles of ones location, integrated with a street-view mode, and 360-degree mode.\n\nThe app Respotter Wiki, launched in 2009, claims to feature Wikipedia searching via a map, also allowing users to interact with people around them, via messaging and reviews, etc. The app, in its current function, however, seems to give only geotagged photo results.\n\nAs of 2017, the provides a simple map search tool which can display tagged articles near to a particular location, as well as a variety of more sophisticated tools integrated with external mapping services.\n\nFollowing a scientific study and several demonstrative websites, a discussion on the privacy implications of geotagging has raised public attention. In particular, the automatic embedding of geotags in pictures taken with smartphones is often ignored by cell-phone users. As a result, people are often not aware that the photos they publish on the Internet have been geotagged. Many celebrities reportedly gave away their home location without knowing it. According to the study, a significant number of for-sale advertisements on Craigslist, that were otherwise anonymized, contained geotags, thereby revealing the location of high-valued goods—sometimes in combination with clear hints to the absence of the offerer at certain times. Publishing photos and other media tagged with exact geolocation on the Internet allows random people to track an individual's location and correlate it with other information. Therefore, criminals could find out when homes are empty because their inhabitants posted geotagged and timestamped information both about their home address and their vacation residence. These dangers can be avoided by removing geotags with a metadata removal tool for photos before publishing them on the Internet.\n\nIn 2007, four United States Army Apache helicopters were destroyed on the ground by Iraqi insurgent mortar fire; the insurgents had made use of embedded coordinates in web-published photographs (geotagging) taken of the helicopters by soldiers.\n\nAnother newly realised danger of geotagging is the location information provided to criminal gangs and poachers on the whereabouts of often endangered animals. This can effectively make tourists scouts for these poachers, so geotagging should be turned off when photographing these animals.\n\n"}

Over time, many of these regiments had managed to return to their pre-Cardwell marches when, in March 2006, the establishment of the Royal Regiment of Scotland saw the disappearance of all Scotland's historic infantry regiments and their distinctions, including music, and the adoption of a new regimental march, \"Scotland the Brave\".\n\n\"Highland Laddie\" continues to be the regimental march of a number of Commonwealth regiments with Scottish affiliations. Some of these regiments include:\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nCanada\n\nAustralia\n\nNew Zealand\n\nRepublic of India\n\nSri Lanka\n\nHighland Laddie is also the name of a dance in Scottish Highland dancing, of the \"national dance\" subtype. This version of the dance was first published by D.G. MacLennan in 1952, who referred to it as a Hebridean dance, collected by MacLennan in 1925 from Archie MacPherson on the island of South Uist. MacLennan himself suggested \"a more effective finishing\" of the dance, with entrechat at the end. Most national dances are usually danced in an Aboyne dress, but the Highland Laddie is one of two national dances that are typically danced in the standard kilt-based outfit, the other being \"Wilt Thou Go to the Barracks, Johnny?\".\n\nHighland (or Hielan') Laddie is the name of several Scottish soft-shoe step dances, different from the National dance mentioned above. Two different dances of this name have been taught in Scottish (Ladies) Step dance classes within the frame of the RSCDS Summer Schools in St Andrews, Scotland. Yet another version, collected by Jack McConachie and published in 1972 is now commonly referred to as \"Hebridean Laddie\". There are reasons to believe that dances taught by Jack McConachie as Hebridean, namely Flowers of Edinburgh and Bonnie Dundee, originally used to be danced to the music of Hielan' Laddie as well.\n\nAs a tune with martial affiliations Highland Laddie is still widely played by the regimental bands and/or pipes and drums of the Scottish regiments. As a traditional Scottish tune, Highland Laddie is also commonly played on the bagpipes for Scottish dances. Typically categorised as a \"Quick March,\" Highland Laddie is normally written in 2/4 time. The \"standard\" setting contains two parts (8 bars per part). As with any of the older melodies, variations have been composed and some published with the most distinctive settings appearing in Pipe Major William Ross' 1885 book containing eight parts to 'Highland Laddie'.\n\n\"Highland Laddie\" appears as the most frequently used regimental march in the Canadian Forces and demonstrates a variety of settings depending upon which music book and/or instructor was used in any particular area. Some regiments play two parts and some a four-part version as their regimental march. Not all the parts are in the same order and some are not played at all.\n\nNumerous lyrics for the tune exist.\n\nWhere ha' ye been a' the day? \nBonnie laddie, Hielan' laddie\nSaw ye him that' far awa' \nBonnie laddie, Hielan' laddie\n\nOn his head a bonnet blue\nBonnie laddie, Hielan' laddie\nTartan plaid and Hielan' trews\nBonnie laddie, Hielan' laddie\n\nWhen he drew his gude braid-sword\nThen he gave his royal word.\nFrae the field he ne'er wad flee\nWi' his friends wad live or dee.\n\nGeordie sits in Charlie's chair\nBut I think he'll no bide there.\nCharlie yet shall mount the throne\nWeel ye ken it is his own.\n\nWas you ever in Quebec?\nBonny laddie, Highland laddie,\nLoading timber on the deck,\nMy bonny Highland laddie.\n\nHigh-ho, and away she goes,\nBonny laddie, Highland laddie,\nHigh-ho, and away she goes,\nMy bonny Highland laddie.\n\nWas you ever in Callao\nWhere the girls are never slow?\n\nWas you ever in Baltimore\nDancing on the sanded floor?\n\nWas you ever in Mobile Bay,\nScrewing cotton by the day?\n\nWas you on the Brummalow,\nWhere Yankee boys are all the go?\n\nThe Lawland Lads think they are fine\nBut oh they're vain and idle gaudy\nHow much unlike the graceful mein\nAnd manly looks o' my Highland Laddie\n\nIf I were free at will to choose\nTo be the wealthiest Lawland Lady\nI'd tak' young Donald without trews\nWi' bonnet blue and Highland plaidie\n\n(Chorus):\n\nOh my bonnie bonnie Highland Laddie\nOh my bonnie bonnie Highland Laddie\nWhen I was sick and like to die\nHe rowed me in his Highland plaidie\n\nO'er Bently Hill wi' him I'll run\nAnd leave my Lawland kin and daddy\nFrae winters chill and summers sun\nHe'll screen me in his Highland plaidie\n\nA painted room, a silken bed\nMaun please a Lawland Lord and Lady\nBut I could kiss and be as glad\nBehind a bush in his Highland plaidie\n\nNae greater joy I'll e'er pretend\nThan that his love prove true and steady\nLike mine to him, which ne'er shall end\nWhile heaven preserves my Highland Laddie\n\nBonny Laddie, Highland Laddie\nBeethoven Op. 108 no.7 (for Piano, Violin and Cello) Four Verses\n\n<poem>Where got ye siller moon,\nBonnie laddie, highland laddie,\nGlinting braw your belt aboon,\nBonnie laddie, highland laddie?\n\nBelted plaid and bonnet blue,\nHave ye been at Waterloo?\n\nWeels me on your tartan trews,\nTell me, tell me a' the news!\n\nSaw ye Boney by the way,\nBlucher wi' his beard sae grey?\n\nOr, the doure and deadly Duke,\nScatt'ring Frenchmen wi'his look?\n\nSome say he the day may rue;\nYou can till gin this be true.\n\nWould ye tell me gin ye ken,\nAught o' Donald and his men?\n\nTell me o' my kilted Clan,\nGin they fought, or gin they ran?</poem>\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is the son of Dory Funk and brother of Terry Funk, and was the promoter of the Amarillo, Texas-based Western States Sports promotion. He is credited with the invention of the Texas cloverleaf submission hold and runs the Funking Conservatory, a professional wrestling school.\n\nFunk held the NWA Worlds Heavyweight Championship once. He is the second-longest reigning NWA World Heavyweight Champion of all time, holding it for over four years. Only Lou Thesz held it longer. He also held the WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship once and the CWA World Heavyweight Championship once. He is a 2009 WWE Hall of Fame inductee. He is working for All Japan Pro Wrestling as the Pacific Wrestling Federation (PWF) chairman.\n\nFunk's career in professional wrestling began in 1963 just after a college football career with West Texas State University (now West Texas A&M University), culminating in a 15 to 14 victory over Ohio University in the Sun Bowl in El Paso, Texas. Funk's first match was a victory over Don Fargo in Amarillo, Texas. West Texas State University All American Jerry Logan was in Funk's corner and Fargo's brother, Jim, was in his corner. Funk was supported by the whole West Texas State University football team and the Tascosa High School amateur wrestling team. He was doing his student teaching as coach of the Tascosa High wrestling team under coach James Kyle.\n\nFunk started in his father's Amarillo, Texas-based Western States Sports promotion and fought Harley Race, Iron Mike DiBiase and Wild Bull Curry. He demonstrated a rugged hard-hitting style that gained attention. He would eventually move on to Florida, Missouri and Japan where his skills improved as he used uppercut forearm smashes, a variety of suplexes and leglocks. Funk won the NWA World Heavyweight Championship from Gene Kiniski on February 11, 1969 in Tampa, Florida with a spinning toe hold and remained NWA World Champion for the next four and a half years, which is the second-longest uninterrupted reign of any NWA World Champion (Lou Thesz held the NWA world title from November 27, 1949, to March 15, 1956). Dory and Terry are the only brothers in history to each hold the title. Funk finally lost the NWA World Championship on May 24, 1973 after a hurried recovery from a pickup truck accident on his father's Flying Mare Ranch in West Texas. Dory was forced into the ring in Kansas City, losing the belt to Harley Race. He performed regularly throughout the NWA, particularly in the Mid-Atlantic and Ontario as a heel, Georgia, Florida and Central States regions, through the 1970s and early 1980s. In Toronto he fought Ric Flair for the NWA championship on October 17, 1982. Flair retained the title.\n\nIn 1987 he feuded with Mike Rotunda in Florida. Rotunda defeated Funk for the vacant Florida Heavyweight title on June 7. Later on a lot of the matches ended in draws.\n\nIn 1973, Funk made his debut for All Japan Pro Wrestling which had just started the year before. Eventually he became a veteran of the company. He feuded with Giant Baba, The Destroyer, Jumbo Tsuruta, Abdullah The Butcher, The Sheik, Genichiro Tenryu, and Harley Race. Terry Funk and him worked a lot as a tag team a series of matches against Abdullah the Butcher and The Sheik; and Giant Baba and Jumbo Tsuruta.\n\nWon many World's Strongest Tag Determination League awards with Terry and Baba. Together Terry and him won the World's Strongest Tag Determination League tournaments in 1977, 1979, and 1982.\n\nOn December 11, 1980 the Funks won Match of the Year Award from Tokyo Sports in their match against Giant Baba and Jumbo Tsuruta.\n\nHis biggest achievement in All Japan was winning the NWA International Heavyweight Championship three times. He won a tournament for the vacant heavyweight title defeating Terry on April 30, 1981. He dropped the title to Butch Reed that June. Later he defeated Reed in August. On October 9 he dropped the title to Bruiser Brody in Tokyo. He regained the title form Brody on November 1. Eventually he lost the title to Brody on April 21, 1982 in Osaka.\n\nLater in his tenure he feuded with Brody, Stan Hansen and Tiger Jeet Singh. The Funks feuded with Riki Choshu and Yoshiaki Yatsu; and the Youngbloods.\n\nIn 1986, Dory (given the nickname \"Hoss\") made his WWF debut in a team alongside his brother Terry. The brothers performed at WrestleMania 2 defeating the Junkyard Dog and Tito Santana. Terry left the WWF shortly after WrestleMania, but Dory remained, mostly tagging with storyline brother Jimmy Jack Funk, who in truth had no relation to the Funk family. They were managed by Jimmy Hart. He would feud with Junkyard Dog. They feuded with The British Bulldogs. Funk wrestled his last WWF match to Pedro Morales at the Sam Muchunik Memorial Tournament on August 29.\n\nOn September 20, 1987, he and Terry teamed up and lost to The Road Warriors by disqualification at World Wrestling Council 14th Anversario in Bayamon, Puerto Rico. On February 27, 1988, Funk participated in World Wrestling Council's La Copa Gillette tournament beating Bruiser Brody in the first round but later that day he lost to Carlos Colon in the quarter finals.\n\nOn April 11, 1988 he lost to Jerry Lawler by count out at Continental Wrestling Association in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nHe reunited with Terry at World Wrestling Alliance defeating Doug Somers and Gary Young on February 2, 1989 in Kansas City, Kansas.\n\nIn October 1990 both Terry and Dory returned to All Japan. They wrestled in tag team matches until Terry left the promotion in April 1991 and went back to North America. Dory found a new partner, Al Perez and they won World's Strongest Tag Determination League Teamwork Award later that year. They lost to Andre the Giant and Giant Baba on November 30, 1991 in Obihiro. At the end of the year Perez left Japan and returned to the United States. In 1992 he once again teamed up with Baba. Later on he teamed with numerous partners. From 1990-1996 he feuded with Abdullah The Butcher and Giant Kimala. He left Japan at the end of 1996.\n\nIn 1994 Funk made his debut for Extreme Championship Wrestling.

The two brothers were the only male descendants of the Byzantine Emperor Andronikos I, who had been dethroned and killed in 1185, and thus claimed to represent the legitimate government of the Empire following the conquest of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204. Although his rivals governing the Nicaean Empire succeeded in becoming the de facto successors, and rendered his dynastic claims to the imperial throne moot, Alexios' descendants continued to emphasize both their heritage and connection to the Komnenian dynasty by referring to themselves as Megas Komnenos or Grand Komnenos.\n\nWhile his brother David conquered a number of Byzantine provinces in northwestern Anatolia, Alexios defended his capital Trebizond from an unsuccessful siege by the Seljuk Turks around the year 1205. Further details of his reign are sparse. Muslim chroniclers record how, in 1214, Alexios was captured by the Turks in the field while defending Sinope; despite sending an envoy to seek their surrender the city refused to capitulate to Sultan Kaykaus I, and Alexios was tortured in sight of the Sinopians. The city submitted to Kaykaus and Alexios was freed after becoming Kaykaus' vassal. Alexios died at the age of forty.\n\nAlexios was the eldest son of Manuel Komnenos, and a grandson of the Byzantine Emperor Andronikos I (reigned 1183–1185). Andronikos had taken refuge at the court of King George III of Georgia in the 1170s, and was a governor in the Pontus when his cousin the emperor Manuel I Komnenos (r. 1143–1180) died; upon hearing the news, he marched on Constantinople and seized the imperial throne. His reign was a turbulent one, and in 1185 Andronikos was dethroned and killed while his son Manuel was blinded and may have died from this mutilation.\n\nManuel left two children, the \"Caesars\" Alexios and David. Their mother's name is not recorded in the primary sources; Byzantinist Alexander Vasiliev speculates that it is \"possible\" that their mother was a Georgian princess. Somehow the boys arrived at the court of their relative Queen Tamar of Georgia; scholars have speculated when and how they made their way there. One school of thought endorses the hypothesis of Fallmerayer, who believed the boys were taken from Constantinople during the chaos of their grandfather's fall from power in 1185, when Alexios was about three years old, and came to Georgia early in Tamar's reign. Another school of thought follows George Finlay's belief that the boys remained in Constantinople, and although educated in the capital, were somehow safe from Andronikos' successor, emperor Isaac II Angelos (r. 1185–1195 and 1203–1204); Finlay argued that they were not at risk from \"a government which, like that of the Byzantine empire, was recognized to be elective, and in which their father had been excluded from the throne by the exercise of an acknowledged constitutional prerogative.\" Older writers who had no knowledge of the chronicle of the Trapezuntine chronicler Michael Panaretos nor access to Georgian records, such as Edward Gibbon, assumed the brothers were simply made governors of Trebizond, and when the Fourth Crusade conquered Constantinople, Alexios declared himself emperor there. Vasiliev discussed these opinions in a 1936 article published in \"Speculum\" and considered Fallmerayer's hypothesis as closer to the truth.\n\nExactly how Alexios and Queen Tamar of Georgia were related is not clear. According to Michael Panaretos, Queen Tamar was Alexios' \"paternal relative\" (προς πατρός θεὶα), a phrase that has baffled scholars. As early as 1854 the Russian scholar Kunik proposed that this phrase meant that Alexios' mother was Rusudan a little-known sister of Tamar, a theory Vasiliev endorsed. Cyril Toumanoff argued that their grandfather Andronikos, while in Georgia, had married an unnamed sister of king George III. More recently Michel Kuršanskis has argued against Toumanoff's theory, producing evidence that Alexios' mother and/or grandmother were daughters of the houses of Palaiologos or Doukas, yet failing to offer an explanation why Panaretos describes Tamar as Alexios' paternal aunt.\n\nDespite the research of Vasiliev, Toumanoff, Kuršanskis and others, Alexios' life is a blank between 1185, when Andronikos was deposed and murdered, and 1204 when he and David arrived at Trebizond—although this lack of information has not prevented scholars from proposing various hypotheses. All authorities agree that Alexios and his brother found refuge at Tamar's court. Vasiliev even speculates that \"Georgian became their native tongue\" and that they \"were thoroughly Georgian in language and education as well as in political ideals\", but possibly \"some Greeks were among their attendants in order that they might be familiar with the language of their own country\". However, Kuršanskis notes that there are few traces of Georgian influence in the administration and culture of the Empire of Trebizond, and points out that its elite always looked towards Constantinople for their political and religious models.\n\nAfter marching from Georgia, and with the help of their paternal relative Queen Tamar, Alexios and David occupied Trebizond in April 1204. That same month Alexios was proclaimed emperor at the age of 22, an act considered by later writers as the moment the Empire of Trebizond was founded.\n\nVasiliev was one of the first historians to suspect that Tamar assisted her young relatives for reasons beyond familial loyalty. \"Religiously minded, Tamar had the habit of bestowing alms on monasteries and churches not only in her own country but also all over the Near East\", Vasiliev wrote in 1936. One such gift she bestowed on a group of monks before they left for Jerusalem was taken from them by the Byzantine emperor Alexios III Angelos (r. 1195–1203) as they sailed past Constantinople; although Tamar subsequently made up for the theft by giving the monks a much more lavish gift, Alexios' theft insulted the queen. She decided to avenge the insult by supporting her nephews in their invasion of Byzantine territories.\n\nThe date Alexios entered Trebizond may be narrowed down even further. Sergey Karpov has identified a lead seal of Alexios, on one side \"the image of a strategos in the peaked helmet leaded by hand by St. George\" with the inscriptions Ἀλέξιος ὁ Κομνηνός [Alexios Komnenos] and Ὁ Ἅ(γιος) Γεώργιος [Saint George] on either side; on the obverse is a scene of Ἡ Ἁγία Ἀνάστασις [The Holy Resurrection] with the corresponding inscription. Karpov interprets the significance of this image and the inscription as portraying the most important achievement of his life, St. George inviting the victorious prince to enter Trebizond and opening the gates of the city with his left hand. The importance of St. George was that Easter—the date of the Resurrection—in 1204 fell on 25 April, while the memorial date of St. George was 23 April. \"So I dared to assume,\" writes Karpov, \"that the seal points out the date of the capture of Trebizond.\"\n\nVasiliev points out that the brothers occupied Trebizond too early to have done so in response to the Crusaders capturing Constantinople; Alexios and David began their march on Trebizond before news of the sack of Constantinople on 13 April 1204 could reach either Trebizond or Georgia. According to Vasiliev, however, their original intention was not to seize a base from which they could recover the capital of the Byzantine Empire, but rather to carve out of the Byzantine Empire a buffer state to protect Georgia from the Seljuk Turks. Kuršanskis, while agreeing with Vasiliev that Tamar was motivated by revenge for Alexios Angelos's insult, proposed a more obvious motivation for the brother's return to Byzantine territory: they had decided to raise the banner of revolt, depose Alexios Angelos, and return the imperial throne to the Komnenos dynasty. However, not long after they had gained control of Trebizond and the neighboring territories, news of the Latin conquest of Constantinople reached them, and the brothers entered the competition for recovery of the imperial city against Theodore I Laskaris in western Anatolia (ruler of the \"Empire of Nicaea\") and Michael Komnenos Doukas in mainland Greece (ruler of the \"Despotate of Epirus\").\n\nOver the following months, David marched westward making himself master of the rest of the Pontus and of Paphlagonia. Anthony Bryer suggests the account in the Georgian Royal Annals of the invasion could be separated into the two routes the individual brothers took. Both started in Imereti and reached Trebizond; David proceeded along the coast, perhaps leading a fleet, capturing Kerasous, Cide, Amasra and Heraclea Pontica; meanwhile Alexios took possession of Limnia, Samsun and Sinope. Although a minor port, Samsun was the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum's doorway to the Black Sea, and Alexios' occupation blocked the Sultanate from the trade and the opportunities of expansion Samsun represented; in the words of the Muslim historian Ali ibn al-Athir, he \"closed the sea\" to the Seljuks. Gaining Paphlagonia gave the brothers access to an important base of support. The Komnenos family was popular in Paphlagonia, with which they had long-established ties, as it was their home province: Kastamone was said to be the ancestral castle of the Komnenoi; during the reign of Isaac II Angelos a pretender to the throne had appeared in Paphlagonia, calling himself Alexios, and he succeeded in uniting several districts behind him.\n\nWhile David was in Paphlagonia, Alexios was forced to remain in the neighborhood of Trebizond, defending the eastern part of their domain from the attacks of the Seljuk Turks. These attacks culminated in the first siege of Trebizond by Sultan Kaykhusraw I. In a panegyric to his master, the Nicaean emperor Theodore Laskaris, Nicetas Choniates compared Alexios to Hylas, a member of the expedition of the Argonauts who landed on the coast of Mysia to obtain water, but was kidnapped by the Naiads and never seen again.\n\nAlthough Theodore Laskaris pushed back the Komnenos brothers' western frontier by defeating an attempt to seize Nicomedia, by 1207 the grandsons of Andronikos Komnenos ruled over the largest of the three Byzantine successor states. From Heraclea Pontica their domain extended east to Trebizond and past it to Soterioupolis on the Georgian frontier. Alexios also made parts of the Crimea a tributary to Trebizond. Cherson, Kerch, and their hinterlands were governed as an overseas province called Perateia (\"beyond the sea\"). It appeared that it was only a matter of time before one of the Komnenos brothers seized Constantinople to rule as \"\"Basileus\" and \"Autokrator\" of the \"Rhomaioi\"\". Unfortunately, this proved to be the high-water mark of their conquests.\n\nTheir adversary, Theodore Laskaris, had not been idle. He had neutralized rivals along his southern marches—Sabas Asidenos, Manuel Maurozomes, and Theodore Mangaphas; he had been crowned Emperor in March or April 1206; all the while Theodore had frustrated attempts of Henry of Flanders to expand the newly founded Latin Empire into Anatolia. In 1208 Theodore decided to strike against the Paphlagonian possessions of Alexios' brother David by crossing the Sangarios River and investing Heraclea Pontica. In response, David sent a deputation to Henry of Flanders, which reached the Latin Emperor in September 1208 with their request for help. Henry led his troops across the Sea of Marmara and occupied Nicomedia, threatening Laskaris' rear, and forcing the latter to lift his siege and return to his own territory. Theodore's withdraw was costly, for he lost about 1000 men in crossing the Sangarios, which was in flood.\n\nDespite this setback, Theodore did not abandon his attempts on Paphlagonia. Following the Seljuk defeat at Antioch on the Meander, he concluded a treaty with the new Seljuk Sultan, Kaykaus I, and together they encroached on the Trapezuntine territory. According to the panegyric of Niketas Choniates, there was no resistance to Theodore's incursions, and Theodore eventually captured Heraclea Pontica and Amastris.\n\nIt was during this period that David Komnenos vanishes from the scene. We know of his ultimate fate from a note in a manuscript written at Mount Athos that tells us David died as a monk of Vatopedi monastery on 13 December 1212. How he went from trusted ally of Alexios to a monastic life—likely an enforced change—has not been documented. Shukurov believes this silence was intentional and therefore significant, that David somehow disgraced himself and was confined to Vatopedi by Alexios. A clue to his offence may be that at one point, faced with another attack from Theodore Laskaris with insufficient men to draw on, David had become a vassal of the enemy of the Byzantine successor realms, the Latin Empire, since, as William Miller explains, \"It was his interest to prefer a nominal Latin suzerainty to annexation by the Nicene Emperor\".\n\nKuršanskis suggests that Alexios also intrigued in the internal politics of the Seljuk Sultanate, supporting Kaykaus' brother Kayqubad against him. This is his interpretation of a puzzling passage in the account of Ibn Bibi, where he states that Sultan Kaykawus was at Sivas when messengers arrived with the report that Alexis had crossed the border and seized territory belonging to the Sultan—when there was no point to this action. If Kuršanskis' has correctly interpreted what lies behind this passage, this would provide Kaykaus with an even stronger reason to ally with Theodore.\n\nKaykaus' role in this alliance was to capture Sinope, the most important port on the Black Sea, and controlling it would once again open the sea to the Seljuks. It was while besieging the port city that Alexios was captured in a skirmish; according to Ibn Bibi, he was hunting outside the city with an escort of 500 cavalry, which Kuršanskis dryly observes was overkill for a simple hunt. This fortunate incident provided Kaykaus with the leverage he needed to take the city, which lies on an isthmus and protected by formidable walls. Alexios was shown to the defenders of the city. At the Sultan's command, Ibn Bibi writes, he sent a confidante into the city to negotiate a surrender; the inhabitants told Alexios' man, \"Suppose Alexius has been captured. None the less he has grown sons in Trebizond who are capable of governing. We will elect one of them as our ruler and will not surrender the country to the Turks.\" Shukurov suggests that the Sinopians' lack of concern for Alexios was out of spite for the deposition of his brother.\n\nInfuriated by their response, Sultan Kaykaus had the unfortunate Alexios tortured in sight of the city walls several times, until the defenders changed their minds. Negotiations began, and on 1 November 1214 the inhabitants surrendered their city to the Seljuks on terms. Alexios was freed, and after pledging his loyalty to the Sultan, and promising to pay tribute, he was allowed to return to Trebizond.\n\nThe loss of Sinope pushed the western frontier of Komnenine territories, which had been at Heraclea a few years earlier, back to the Iris and Thermodon rivers, only from their base at Trebizond. This loss isolated Trebizond from direct contact with the Empire of Nicaea and the other Greek lands. Cut off from the rest of the Byzantine world, the Trapezuntine rulers for the next two generations turned their immediate attention to Asian affairs.\n\nNothing certain is known of the remainder of Alexios' life. Vasiliev has suggested that when George IV Lasha of Georgia was campaigning near the Kura River, Alexios was amongst the \"tributaries [who] arrived from Khlar and Greece with presents\", in the phrasing of the Georgian chronicles. He identifies \"Khlar\" with Ahlat near Lake Van, and states that by \"Greece\" the chronicler meant the Trapezuntine Empire. Kuršanskis, however, is not convinced by Vasiliev's arguments, pointing out that Alexios would have travelled too far from Trebizond to pay homage and emphasizes that Trebizond was always referred to in the \"Georgian Chronicle\" as \"Pontus\" and never as \"Greece\".\n\nAlexios died at the age of forty on 1 February 1222 after a reign of eighteen years. His eldest son John was passed over in favor of his son-in-law, Andronikos I Gidos.\n\nAlexios married at some point in his life, but contemporary writers fail to record any information about his wife. Theodora Axuchina is supposed by some to have been her name, which appears in the \"Europäische Stammtafeln: Stammtafeln zur Geschichte der Europäischen Staaten\" (1978) by Detlev Schwennicke. It has since found its place in several modern genealogies.\n\nMichel Kuršankis has argued, on the strength of John I Axouchos’s surname and Alexios I’s known political affiliations, that he had married, probably about 1201, a daughter of John Komnenos \"the Fat\" (d.1200), son of the \"protostrator\" Alexios Axouch. Alexios is known to have had two sons, the future emperors John I and Manuel I, and a daughter who married Andronikos Gidos. The Russian Byzantinist Rustam Shukurov has argued that Alexios had at least one more son, and speculated that one may have been the Ioannikios who was tonsured and confined to a monastery when Manuel became emperor.\n\n"}

He previously was the UK’s longest-serving Minister of State for Security and Economic Crime from 2016 to 2019. A member of the Conservative Party, he has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for Wyre and Preston North in Lancashire since the 2010 United Kingdom general election. Wallace was first elected as the MP for Lancaster and Wyre in the 2005 United Kingdom general election, having previously served as a captain in the Scots Guards regiment of the British Army, and as a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for North East Scotland.\n\nWallace was born on 15 May 1970 in Farnborough, Kent. He attended the independent school, Millfield in Somerset. After school, Wallace became a ski instructor with the Austrian National Ski School in the village of Alpbach in Austria.\n\nWallace attended the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, before he was commissioned in 1991 into the Scots Guards. From 1991 to 1998, he served in Germany, Cyprus, Belize, and Northern Ireland, rising to the rank of Captain. During his time in Northern Ireland, he was mentioned in dispatches in 1992 for an incident in which the patrol he was commanding captured an entire IRA active service unit attempting to carry out a bomb attack against British troops.\n\nAfter leaving the Army, Wallace decided to enter politics in part because of the experience he had commanding men from some of the UK's most economically deprived areas which he believed could be improved by promoting a more aspirational society. Wallace became a Conservative Member of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, as a list MSP for North East Scotland. He stood down in 2003, as he sought selection for a Westminster constituency in England. Wallace was the Scottish Conservatives' shadow health spokesman during that time.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2005 he was overseas director of the aerospace company QinetiQ, the UK's former Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA).\n\nWallace was elected as MP for the Lancaster and Wyre constituency in the 2005 general election. He won 22,266 votes with a majority of 4,171 (8.0%). The seat had previously been held by the Labour Party's Hilton Dawson. The constituency was abolished in 2010 and in the 2010 general election he was elected as MP in the new seat of Wyre and Preston North with 26,877 votes and a majority of 15,844 (30.9%). Wallace was re-elected at the 2015, 2017 and 2019 general elections.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2010 Wallace was a member of the Scottish Affairs Select Committee. From 2006 to 2010 Wallace was the Shadow Minister of State for Scotland. He was Chairman of the British–Iran Parliamentary Group from 2006 to 2014. On 13 November 2008, Wallace was awarded Campaigner of the Year in the \"Spectator\"/Threadneedle Parliamentarian awards, for his work promoting transparency of MPs expenses.\n\nWallace faced criticism locally after it was revealed he had the fourth highest expenses claim of any MP in the UK in 2008, claiming £175,523 on top of his £63,000 salary. However, he defended the costs by arguing that the constituency has an electorate that is nearly 20% larger than the average one in England.\n\nFollowing his re-election to Parliament in 2010, Wallace was appointed as Parliamentary Private Secretary to the then-Justice Secretary and Lord Chancellor, and later Minister without Portfolio in the Cabinet Office, Ken Clarke MP. On 4 September 2012, Wallace turned down a position as a Lord Commissioner of the Treasury during the cabinet reshuffle to remain Clarke's PPS. He voted against the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013, which legalised same-sex marriage in England and Wales.\n\nIn July 2014, as Clarke returned to the back benches, Wallace was again offered a job in Government as a whip. This time he accepted. In May 2015 he was promoted to Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Northern Ireland Office.\n\nIn January 2016, the Labour Party unsuccessfully proposed an amendment in Parliament that would have required private landlords to make their homes \"fit for human habitation\". According to Parliament's register of interests, Wallace was one of 72 Conservative MPs who voted against the amendment who personally derived an income from renting out property. The Conservative Government stated that they believed homes should be fit for human habitation but did not want to pass the new law that would explicitly require it.\n\nAfter the EU referendum, the new Prime Minister, Theresa May, promoted him to Minister of State for Security in the Home Office. In December 2017 the Ministerial portfolio was extended to include Economic Crime. He was the Security Minister during the terror attacks of 2017 and the Salisbury attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal. Wallace was appointed to the Privy Council for his role in coordinating the government response to the 2017 Westminster attack.\n\nWallace supported the UK remaining within the European Union (EU) prior to the 2016 referendum. He voted for then Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit withdrawal agreement in early 2019, and voted against any referendum on a Brexit withdrawal agreement.\n\nIn February 2018, Wallace was criticised by political opponents for promoting unfounded smears on the leader of the Labour Party. \"The Sun\" newspaper had alleged that during the 1980s Jeremy Corbyn had colluded with a Communist spy. In response to the allegations, a spokesman for Corbyn stated that any suggestion that the Labour leader had been an agent, asset or informer was \"an entirely false and a ridiculous smear\". Amidst these allegations, Wallace was criticised for tweeting: \"'Jeremy has been interested in foreign policy issues his entire political career' [sic] - Labour MP Louise Haigh, BBC Daily Politics - yup so was Kim Philby\". Wallace later defended his tweet, and said he \"wasn't comparing, just saying that being interested in foreign policy isn't an answer to the allegations being made\". Wallace told Sky News: \"It was a light-hearted dig at Louise Haigh's excuse that Corbyn was interested in foreign affairs ... I was simply saying Kim Philby was also interested in foreign affairs\".\n\nOn 24 July 2019 Wallace was appointed Secretary of State for Defence by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, succeeding Penny Mordaunt. In August 2019, he was overheard discussing Prime Minister Johnson's controversial prorogation with Florence Parly, the French Minister of Armies. Wallace suggested that the reason for the prorogation of parliament for five weeks was to prevent MPs from blocking the government's Brexit plans rather than the government's official position that it was to introduce new legislative agenda. The government responded to his comments by stating that he had \"misspoken\". This prorogation was later deemed unlawful by the Supreme Court on 24 September.\n\nOn 13 October 2019, Wallace defended Turkey's offensive against the Syrian Democratic Forces in north-eastern Syria in a NATO meeting. He commented, \"Turkey needs to do what it sometimes has to do to defend itself\". His comments were condemned by other delegates at the meeting.\n\nOn 12 January 2020, in an interview with \"The Sunday Times\", Wallace said that the UK \"must be prepared to fight wars without the US\", one of the UK's key allies. He stated that the upcoming Defence Review \"should be used to make the UK less dependent on the US in future conflicts\". His comments were made in response to US President Donald Trump's America First isolationist policies. Wallace also said that the next Defence Review would be the 'deepest review' of Britain's defence and foreign policies since the end of the Cold War in 1991.\n\nHe married Liza Cooke in 2001 and they have three children. His wife worked as a part-time parliamentary assistant in his office until 30 April 2019. They met when she was a researcher in the Scottish Parliament and Wallace was a MSP.\n\nWallace resides near Lancaster and in London.\n\n\n"}

During the 1960s and 1970s, it was the most powerful and best known conglomerate in Canada, at one time controlling the companies making up 10 percent of all shares traded daily on the Toronto Stock Exchange.\n\nAt its height in the 1970s, it was a true conglomerate with many unrelated businesses. Among these were Dominion grocery stores, Orange Crush soft drinks, Massey-Ferguson farm machinery, Domtar wood products and Carling O'Keefe breweries.\n\nThe company was purchased by Conrad Black in 1978. Black and his associates sold off most of the Argus assets by 1985, and by 2005 Argus contained only one asset and was itself wholely owned by Black's Ravelston Corporation. Due to the fallout of ongoing lawsuits, Ravelston went bankrupt in 2008, and Argus disappeared.\n\nArgus was founded as an investment holding company in 1945 by E. P. Taylor with minority partners Colonel W. Eric Phillips, Wallace McCutcheon, Bud McDougald, and other less influential investors. The company was formed through Taylor's brewery empire, Canadian Breweries Limited, which was later known as Carling O'Keefe, and which Argus took control over. Argus was also set up with the support of the American Atlas Corporation, itself a holding company.\n\nIn 1958, Argus moved its headquarters to the prestigious location of 10 Toronto Street, where it stayed until its demise.\n\nArgus was once one of Canada's most powerful conglomerates. By 1964, 10 percent of all shares traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange were controlled by Argus. In 1969, E.P. Taylor appointed McDougald to run operations. In the 1970s, it controlled large companies including Canadian Breweries Limited, Dominion Stores, Hollinger Mines, Crown Trust, Domtar, Standard Broadcasting and Massey-Ferguson, as well as at some point or other having control or significant shareholdings in other Canadian companies such as Dominion Malting Co., Orange Crush Ltd., British Columbia Forest Products Limited and the St. Lawrence Corporation, a wood pulp processor.\n\nThe company's importance was so great that when Paul Desmarais of the Power Corporation of Canada attempted, but later failed, to acquire Argus, the federal government of Pierre Elliot Trudeau responded by creating the Royal Commission on Corporate Concentration in 1975, which is held to be a token of the influence of the Desmarais clan over the affairs of the nation.\n\nShortly after the death of McDougald in 1978, his widow and her sister sold their shares to Conrad Black while the widows were under the influence of what \"The Globe and Mail\" called \"slow-witted advisers\". The transaction led to a high-profile falling out between the families. The move gave Black effective voting control and he became president of the corporation. The move also was financially lucrative for Black - his net worth grew to an estimated $50 million in 1978. Black and his associates sold off most of the assets by 1985, and used the money to invest in media properties. In 2005, Argus's only asset was the Toronto-based holding company Hollinger Inc. Argus itself was 100 percent controlled by Ravelston Corporation—itself a holding company controlled until 2005 by Black and his long-time associate David Radler. The company went into receivership along with Ravelston in 2005 due to the legal troubles of its chairman, and eventually went bankrupt in 2008 while Black was in prison.\n\nA list of assets once owned by Argus included:\n\n\n"}

Though the bishop is subject to the Roman Pontiff, he is not the vicar of the latter: he governs it in his own name. The diocese takes its name from the see city, the metropolitan area where the bishop resides.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong is a \"de jure\" suffragan diocese of the Archdiocese of Guangzhou. However, in practice it is an immediate subject of the Holy See. Also in theory, not only Hong Kong, but also a small part of Guangdong province belongs to the diocese. In practice, however, the diocese only comprises the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.\n\nThere were about 384,000 local Catholics as of August 2015, and 160,000 Filipino Catholics in Hong Kong. They are served by 223 priests, 26 deacons, 68 brothers and 474 sisters. There are 51 parishes, comprising 40 churches, 31 chapels and 26 halls for religious service. As for education, in 2017 there are 251 Catholic schools and kindergartens, having a total of over 150,000 pupils.\n\nThe organization of what would become the Diocese of Hong Kong began immediately after the establishment of Hong Kong as a British colony.\n\nIn 1841 Pope Gregory XVI created a Prefecture Apostolic comprising \"Hong Kong with the surrounding six leagues\" independent from the Diocese of Macau, but under the authority of the Bishop of Macau. The initial need for the establishment of the prefecture was the spiritual care of the British (Irish Catholic) soldiers stationed in the newly established colony.\n\nTheodore Joset, a Swiss diocesan priest, became the first Prefect Apostolic.\n\nThe prefecture functioned much as a mission, but was intended from its inception to become a diocese. In the first ten years, the missionaries built churches, schools, a seminary, and institutions for the sick, elderly, and orphans.\n\nFollowing Joset's death in 1842, Anthony Feliciani became Prefect Apostolic of Hong Kong.\n\nThe foundation stone of the first church was laid in 1842. It was dedicated to the Immaculate Conception in 1843, enlarged in 1858–59, burnt down on 18 October 1859, rebuilt and blessed on 18 March 1860.\n\nIn 1858, the first missionaries, members of the Seminary of Foreign Missions of Milan (now PIME) arrived; they were designated to take over the administration of the mission in time.\n\nBy 1860, the physical territory had spread well beyond the initial six leagues surrounding Hong Kong to include the San On District (), the Kowloon Peninsula, Sai Kung Peninsula, and Nam Tau.\n\nIn 1874 the Hong Kong Prefecture was raised to a Vicariate Apostolic and entrusted to the Seminary of Foreign Missions of Milan (now PIME). While the prefecture had been run by missionary priests, a vicariate was the intermediary step before becoming a diocese, and required a bishop to run it. Since the territory was not yet a diocese, the bishops were called \"titular bishop\" of another place (where they had no ecclesiastical authority). The bishops were under the direct authority of the Pope, exercising their power in his name, rather than being vested with the office belonging to a diocese.\n\nThe first Vicar Apostolic was Bishop Giovanni Timoleon Raimondi (consecrated 22 November 1874), who died at Mission House, Glenealy, Hong Kong, on 27 September 1894. He was succeeded by Bishops Louis Piazzoli (born 1849) and Dominic Pozzoni (born 1851) elected 26 May 1905.\n\nIn 1880, the vicariate hosted the first synod of the fifth ecclesiastical region of the Catholic Church in China; it hosted a second synod in 1891, and a third in 1909.\n\nIn 1883, the foundation stone of a new cathedral was laid. This is the present Immaculate Conception Cathedral. It was inaugurated in 1888.\n\nThe vicariate continued to grow. In 1913 it included 12 European and 10 native priests and 14,195 Christians; there were 26 churches, 5 of them with resident priests; 40 schools for boys and 29 schools for girls; 12 Brothers of the Christian Schools; 35 Sisters of Canossa; 22 Sisters of St. Paul of Chartres; and 54 native Sisters.\n\nBesides Hong Kong Island, the vicariate included Lantau Island, its adjacent islands and the three continental districts of San-on (), Kwei-shing (), and Haï-fung (). Churches with resident priests were the cathedral (Glenealy), St. Joseph's (Garden Road), St. Francis (Wan Chai), Church of the Sacred Heart (West Point), Church of St. Anthony (West Point). The Société des Missions Etrangères de Paris had a procurator, a sanitorium (Béthanie) and a printing office (Nazareth) at Hong Kong; there was also a Dominican procurator.\n\nMore missionaries arrived from many orders throughout the 1920s and 1930s, building more churches, schools, and hospitals.\n\nDuring World War II, the Japanese occupation stopped almost all activities. Missionaries evacuated, and were variously interned, released, and expelled. After the war, reconstruction began immediately.\n\nOn 11 April 1946 Pope Pius XII established the episcopal hierarchy in China, raising all the apostolic vicariates to dioceses, Hong Kong among them. Since then, the Hong Kong Diocese is directly responsible to the pope. Enrico Valtorta became the first bishop of Hong Kong.\n\nIn 1949 refugees fleeing the Chinese communist regime began to pour into Hong Kong, including many Catholics and clergymen from all over China; diocesan activities were effectively restricted to the boundaries of the Colony. In 1952, the diocese opened seven new chapels for refugees.\n\nIn 1969 Bishop Francis Hsu became, after the resignation of Lorenzo Bianchi, the first Chinese bishop of Hong Kong.\n\nOn 29 May 1988 John Baptist Wu, the fifth bishop, was named a member of the College of Cardinals by Pope John Paul II. He was the first cardinal from the Hong Kong diocese.\n\nOn 18 August 1991, an Open Forum on \"Elections 1991\", jointly organized by the Council of Priests, the Justice and Peace Commission, the Central Council of Catholic Laity and the Catholic Institute for Religion and Society, was held in the nine constituencies of Hong Kong, Kowloon and the New Territories in order to encourage the faithful to take an active part in the direct elections to the Legislative Council on 15 September. Church organizations also made a similar appeal to the faithful and ordinary citizens through publications, questionnaires and advertisements in newspapers.\n\nOn 15 April 1993 the diocese was re-divided into nine deaneries. The Council of Priests was reorganized with all the deans included as ex officio members.\n\nAfter the death of Cardinal Wu on 23 September 2002, his coadjutor Joseph Zen Ze-kiun became the 6th bishop of Hong Kong.\n\nOn 8 July 2004 the Legislative Council passed the Education (Amendment) Bill. Under the New Ordinance, which would be effective on 1 January 2005, every aided school would be required before 2010 to form an incorporated management committee (IMC) whose members should include elected representatives of teachers, parents of students and alumni, as well as other independent persons, with a view to promoting a school-based management. It was the concern of the Church that, as a sponsoring body, she would no longer be empowered in the future to supervise the schools under her sponsorship, nor be able to achieve her goals and objectives in Catholic education. On 5 June 2005, Bishop Zen announced that, if the Legislative Council passed the donation to support schools to create incorporated management committees on 8 July 2005, he would appeal against the decision to the court. After the Government decided to give up some main argued points, the Diocese decided to support the motion.\n\nOn 22 February 2006. Pope Benedict XVI announced that Bishop Joseph Zen would be raised to the College of Cardinals. He was made a cardinal at a consistory held on 24 March. \nZen was an outspoken supporter of democracy and a staunch critic of the People's Republic of China. His views on government policies were often at odds with those of Hong Kong's former Chief Executive Donald Tsang Yam-kuen, who is also a Catholic.\n\nOn 15 April 2009. Pope Benedict XVI appoints Bishop John Tong Hon as the 7th Bishop of the Diocese of Hong Kong after the resignation of Cardinal Joseph Zen. Bishop John Tong was named a member of the College of Cardinals on 19 February 2012. On 1 August 2017. Pope Francis accept the resignation of Cardinal John Tong. Coadjutor Bishop Michael Yeung Ming Cheung was appointed as the 8th Bishop of the Diocese of Hong Kong, until his death in 3 January 2019. After few days of Bishop Michael Yeung's death. Pope Francis appoints Cardinal John Tong as the Apostolic Administrator of Hong Kong Diocese.\n\nBelow is a list of individuals who have led the Diocese of Hong Kong and its antecedent jurisdictions since its founding.\n\n\n\n\nUnder the Code of Canon Law, the coadjutor bishop has the right of succession (\"cum jure successionis\") upon the death, retirement or resignation of the diocesan bishop he is assisting. All coadjutor bishops eventually succeeded to become head of the Diocese of Hong Kong.\n\n\nUnlike coadjutors, auxiliary bishops do not have the right of succession, per canon 975, §1 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law. Hsu, Lei, Tong, and Yeung went on to become Bishop of Hong Kong.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It resulted in the defeat of the Castilian forces and their subsequent retreat to Toledo, whereas the Almohads conquered back Trujillo, Montánchez, and Talavera.\n\nIn 1189 the Almohad caliph Yaqub al-Mansur returned from Marrakesh to fight the Portuguese who, with the help of a Christian alliance, had taken over Silves. He successfully recaptured the city and went back to his capital.\n\nAn armistice between the Almohads and the Christian kings of Castile and León ensued. At the expiration of the truce, and having received news that Yaqub was gravely ill in Marrakesh and that his brother Abu Yahya, the governor of Al-Andalus, had crossed the Mediterranean to declare himself king and take over Marrakesh, Alfonso VIII of Castile decided to attack the region of Seville in 1194. A strong host under the archbishop of Toledo (Martín López de Pisuerga), which included the military Order of Calatrava, ransacked the province. Having successfully crushed his brother's ambitions, Yaqub al-Mansur was left with no choice other than to lead an expedition against the Christians, who were now threatening the northern province of his empire.\n\nOn the first day of June, 1195, he landed at Tarifa. Passing through the province of Seville, the main Almohad army reached Cordova on June 30, reinforced by the few troops raised by the local governors and by a Christian cavalry contingent under Pedro Fernández de Castro, who held a personal feud against the Castilian king. On July 4 Ya'qub moved out of Cordova; his army crossed the pass of Muradal (Despeñaperros) and advanced through the plain of Salvatierra. A cavalry detachment of the Order of Calatrava, plus some knights from nearby castles, tried to gather news about the Almohad strength and its heading; they were surrounded by Muslim scouts and almost exterminated, but managed to supply information to the Castilian king.\n\nAlfonso gathered his forces at Toledo and marched down to Alarcos (al-Arak, in Arabic), near the Guadiana River, a place which marked the Southern limit of his kingdom and where a fortress was under construction. He intended on barring the access to the rich Tagus valley, and did not wait for the reinforcements the Kings Alfonso IX of León and Sancho VII of Navarre were sending. When on July 16 the Almohad host came in view, Yaqub al-Mansur did not accept battle on this day or the day after, preferring to give rest to his forces; but early the day after that, Wednesday, July 18, the Almohad army formed for battle around a small hill called La Cabeza, two bow-shots from Alarcos.\n\nYusuf Ya'qub al-Mansur gave to his vizier, Abu Yahya ibn Abi Hafs, command of a very strong vanguard: on the first line the Bani Marin volunteers under Abu Jalil Mahyu ibn Abi Bakr, with a big body of archers and the Zenata Tribe; behind them, on the hill itself, the vizier with the Amir's banner and his personal guard, from the Hintata tribe; to the left the Arab host under Yarmun ibn Riyah; and to the right, the al-Andalus forces under the popular Caid Ibn Sanadid. Yusuf Ya'qub al-Mansur himself held command of the rearguard, which comprised the best Almohad forces commanded by Yabir ibn Yusuf, Abd al-Qawi, Tayliyun, Muhammad ibn Munqafad, and Abu Jazir Yajluf al-Awrabi and the black guard (of black Africans). It was a formidable army, whose strength Alfonso had badly underestimated. The Castilian king put most of his heavy cavalry in a compact body, about 8,000 strong, and gave its command to Diego López de Haro, lord of Vizcaya. The king himself would follow with the infantry and the Military Orders.\n\nThe Christian cavalry charge was somewhat disordered. The knights crashed against the Zanatas and Bani Marin and dispersed them; lured by the Amir's standard, they charged uphill: Vizier Abu Yahya was killed, and the Hintata fell almost to a man trying to protect themselves. Most of the knights turned to their left and after a fierce struggle they routed the al-Andalus forces of Ibn Sanadid. Three hours had passed; just afternoon, in the intense heat, the fatigue and the missiles which kept falling on them took their toll of armoured knights. The Arab right under Yarmun had been enveloping the Castilian flank and rear; at this point the best of the Almohad forces attacked, with the sultan himself clearly visible in the front ranks; and finally the knights were almost completely surrounded.\n\nAlfonso advanced with all his remaining forces into the melee, only to find himself assaulted from all sides and under a rain of arrows. For some time he fought hand-to-hand, until removed from the action, almost by force, by his bodyguard; they fled towards Toledo. The Castilian infantry was destroyed, together with most of the Orders which had supported them; the Lord of Vizcaya tried to force his way through the ring of enemy forces, but finally had to seek refuge in the unfinished fortress of Alarcos with just a fraction of his knights. The castle was surrounded with some 3,000 people trapped inside, half of them women and children. The king's enemy, Pedro Fernández de Castro, who had taken little part in the action, was sent by the Amir to negotiate the surrender; López de Haro and the survivors were allowed to go, leaving 12 knights as hostages for the payment of a great ransom.\n\nThe Castilian field army had been destroyed. Those killed included three bishops (from Avila, Segovia, and Siguenza); Count Ordoño García de Roda and his brothers; Counts Pedro Ruiz de Guzmán and Rodrigo Sánchez; the Masters of the Order of Santiago, Sancho Fernández de Lemus, and of the Portuguese Order of Évora, Gonçalo Viegas. Losses for the Muslims included the death of the vizier and Abi Bakr, commander of the Bani Marin volunteers, who died of his wounds in the following year.\n\nThe outcome of the battle shook the stability of the Kingdom of Castile for several years. All nearby castles surrendered or were abandoned: Malagón, Benavente, Calatrava, Caracuel, and Torre de Guadalferza, and the way to Toledo was wide open. However, Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur moved back to Seville to make good his own considerable losses; there he took the title of al-Mansur Billah ('The one victorious by God').\n\nFor the next two years, al-Mansur's forces devastated Extremadura, the Tagus valley, La Mancha and even the area around Toledo; they moved in turn against Montánchez, Trujillo, Plasencia, Talavera, Escalona and Maqueda. Some of these expeditions were led by the renegade Pedro Fernández de Castro. Most significantly, however, these raids did not lead to any territorial gains for the caliph, although Almohad diplomacy did obtain an alliance with King Alfonso IX of León (who had been enraged when the Castilian king had not waited for him before the battle of Alarcos) and the neutrality of Navarre. These alliances proved to be temporary only.\n\nBut the caliph was losing interest in the affairs of the Iberian Peninsula; he was in poor health, his objective of retaining a hold over al-Andalus appeared to be a complete success, and in 1198 he returned to Africa. He died in February 1199.\n\nHowever, the success of the battle proved to be short-lived. When the Almohad caliph Muhammad al-Nasir attempted to build on it 16 years later with a new Iberian offensive, he was crushingly defeated in the more decisive Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa. This battle was to mark a turning-point that led to the end of Moorish rule in the Iberian Peninsula. The Almohad Empire itself collapsed a few years later.\n\n"}

The leaves are alternate, simple, lanceolate, 5–15 cm long, with an acuminate tip and a finely serrated or lobed margin. The flowers are small (2–3 cm diameter) and yellow, with five petals; the fruit is a many-seeded capsule.\n\nThe genus \"Corchorus\" is classified under the subfamily Grewioideae of the family Malvaceae. It contains around 40 to 100 species.\n\nThe genus \"Oceanopapaver\", previously of uncertain placement, has recently been synonymized under \"Corchorus\". The name was established by Guillaumin in 1932 for the single species \"Oceanopapaver neocaledonicum\" Guillaumin from New Caledonia. The genus has been classified in a number of different families including Capparaceae, Cistaceae, Papaveraceae, and Tiliaceae. The putative family name \"Oceanopapaveraceae\" has occasionally appeared in print and on the web but is a nomen nudum and has never been validly published nor recognised by any system of plant taxonomy.\n\nThe genus \"Corchorus\" was first described by Linnaeus in his great work \"Species Plantarum\" (1753). It is derived from the Ancient Greek word κόρχορος or κόρκορος (\"korkhoros\" or \"korkoros\") which referred to a wild plant of uncertain identity, possibly jute or wild asparagus.\n\nThe fibers from \"Corchorus\" (known as jute) are the most widely cultivated vegetable fiber after cotton.\n\n\"Corchorus\" leaves are consumed in the cuisines of various countries. \"Corchorus olitorius\" is used mainly in the cuisines of southern Asia, the Middle East, North Africa and West Africa, \"Corchorus capsularis\" in Japan and China. It has a mucilaginous (somewhat \"slimy\") texture, similar to okra, when cooked. The seeds are used as a flavouring, and a herbal tea is made from the dried leaves. The leaves of \"Corchorus\" are rich in betacarotene, iron, calcium, and vitamin C. The plant has an antioxidant activity with a significant α-tocopherol equivalent vitamin E.\n\nIn North Africa and the Middle East, the young leaves of \"Corchorus\" species are known in Arabic as \"malukhiyah\" and are used as green leafy vegetables . \"Malukhiyah\" is eaten widely in Egypt and some consider it the Egyptian national dish. It is featured in cuisines from Lebanon, Palestine, Syria, Jordan and Tunisia. In Turkey and Cyprus, the plant is known as \"molohiya\" or \"molocha\" and is usually cooked into a kind of chicken stew. The leaves of \"Corchorus\" have been a staple Egyptian food since the time of the Pharaohs and it is from there that it gains its recognition and popularity. Varieties of mallow-leaves stew with rice is a well known Middle Eastern cuisine.\n\nIn Nigerian cuisine, especially amongst the Yorubas, it is commonly used in a stew known as \"ewedu\", a condiment to other starch-based foods such as \"amala\" or added with gbegiri a local nigeria soup. In Northern Nigeria it is known as \"Ayoyo\". They use it to cook a sauce called (\"Miyan Ayoyo\") which is commonly served with Tuwon Masara or Tuwon Allebo.\n\nIn Ghana, it is mostly eaten by the people in the North and it is called ayoyo. It is mostly eaten with Tuozaafi (food prepared with cornflour).\n\nIn Sierra Leone it is known as \"krain krain\" (or \"crain crain\") and is cooked as stew. The stew is usually eaten with rice or \"foofoo\" (a traditional food made from cassava).\n\nJute leaves are also consumed among the Luhya people of Western Kenya, where it is commonly known as \"mrenda\" or \"murere\". It is eaten with starchy foods like \"ugali\", a staple for most communities in Kenya. In Northern Sudan it is called \"khudra\", meaning \"green\" in Sudanese Arabic. The Songhai people of Mali call it \"fakohoy\".\n\nIn India, it is locally known as \"nalta sag\". It is a favorite food during the summer months, especially in Sambalpur and the western part of Odisha. Usually it is lightly sauteed and eaten along with rice or rice gruel.\n\nIn the Philippines, \"C. olitorius\" is known as \"saluyot\". It is commonly consumed as a leafy vegetable together with bamboo shoots.\n\nIn Thai cuisine, the leaves of the \"Corchorus olitorius\" (locally known as \"bai po\"; ) are eaten blanched, together with plain rice congee.

A plasma is a quasineutral, electrically conductive fluid. In the simplest case, it is composed of electrons and a single species of positive ions, but it may also contain multiple ion species including negative ions as well as neutral particles. Due to its electrical conductivity, a plasma couples to electric and magnetic fields. This complex of particles and fields supports a wide variety of wave phenomena.\n\nThe electromagnetic fields in a plasma are assumed to have two parts, one static/equilibrium part and one oscillating/perturbation part. Waves in plasmas can be classified as electromagnetic or electrostatic according to whether or not there is an oscillating magnetic field. Applying Faraday's law of induction to plane waves, we find formula_1, implying that an electrostatic wave must be purely longitudinal. An electromagnetic wave, in contrast, must have a transverse component, but may also be partially longitudinal.\n\nWaves can be further classified by the oscillating species. In most plasmas of interest, the electron temperature is comparable to or larger than the ion temperature. This fact, coupled with the much smaller mass of the electron, implies that the electrons move much faster than the ions. An electron mode depends on the mass of the electrons, but the ions may be assumed to be infinitely massive, i.e. stationary. An ion mode depends on the ion mass, but the electrons are assumed to be massless and to redistribute themselves instantaneously according to the Boltzmann relation. Only rarely, e.g. in the lower hybrid oscillation, will a mode depend on both the electron and the ion mass.\n\nThe various modes can also be classified according to whether they propagate in an unmagnetized plasma or parallel, perpendicular, or oblique to the stationary magnetic field. Finally, for perpendicular electromagnetic electron waves, the perturbed electric field can be parallel or perpendicular to the stationary magnetic field.\nformula_2 - wave frequency, \nformula_3 - wave number, \nformula_4 - speed of light,\nformula_5 - plasma frequency, \nformula_6 - ion plasma frequency, \nformula_7 - electron gyrofrequency, \nformula_8 - proton gyrofrequency, \nformula_9 - upper hybrid frequency, \nformula_10 - plasma \"sound\" speed,\nformula_11 - plasma Alfvén speed\n\n\n"}

The neighbourhood is bounded by Lake Furesø to the west, Holte in Rudersdal Municipality to the north, Brede to the east and Kongens Lyngby and Sorgenfri to the south. Virum station is located on the Hillerød radial of the S-train network and is served by the Btrains.\nVirum is known for its religious society.\n\nThe village of Virum is first mentioned in a papal letter from 1186 but is no doubt considerably older. The name \"an open place which is easy to defend\" (\" vigi\": \"easily defendable place\" and -rum: open place). In the letter, Pope Clement III gives the Virum as well as many other villages in the area tio to Bishop Absalon. Absalon soon ceded the villages to the Bishopric of Roskilde.\n\nThe Bishop of Roskilde constructed the small castle Hjortholm at the site in circa 1250. The castle was destroyed during the Count's Feud in 1535. Frederick III took over the estate in 1668. He renamed it Frederiksdal and constructed a small hunting lodge at the site.\n\nThe village of Virum was located where Virumgade is today. It belonged to the parish of Lyngby. The land was divided into three areas called \"Geelsvang\", \"Mellemvang\" and \"Høftevang\" which were subdivided into fields and crops were rotated in accordance with the three-field system. The marchy land down towards Furesøen was grazed by livestock. In 1682, it consisted of 13 farms, three houses with land and 14 houses without land.\n\nThe modern suburb was planned in connection with the conversion of the North Line into an S-train line. Virum station opened in 1936. The ambition was to create a healthy, well-functioning suburb with a population the size of a medium large Danish provincial town. The centre of the new suburb was Virum Torv, a mixed-use development centred on a roundabout next to the station. It contained retail space, service functions and apartments. Its northeastern corner was completed in 1939, its southeastern corner in 1943 and its southwestern corner less than a year later. A cinema, Virum Bio, was from the beginning located in the building on the southeastern corner. The same building also contained an Irma supermarket.\n\nFrederiksdal Castle is located in Virum. Its main building was built from 1744–45 and was used as a summer residence for Foreign Affairs, Privy Councilor Johan Sigismund Schulin. The Schulin Family still owns the estate.\n\nVirum station is located on the Hillerød radial of the S-train network and is served by the Btrains. Brede Station in the eastern outskirts of Virum is served by the Lokaltog service on the Nærum Line between Jægersborg in the south and Nærum to the north.\n\nVirum Church is from 1937 and was designed by Niels Skrivers. Virum Gymnasium is from 1957.\n\n"}

The late-15th-century morality play \"Elckerlijc\" is attributed to him.\n\n\"Elckerlijc\", which was translated into English to become the famous \"Everyman\", has come down to us in manuscripts that fail to mention the play's author. A 1539 Latin translation by Georgius Macropedius, however, states that its original author is one Petrus Diesthemius ('Peter of Diest'). Little else is known of this writer; he has been identified with the Carthusian monk Petrus Dorlandus (1454–1507), who lived in Diest (in present-day Belgium) and wrote lives of the saints. This identification, however, is controversial among philologists.\n"}
