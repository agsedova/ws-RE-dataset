He was the son of Iyasu III.\n\nHezqeyas was brought down from the Royal prison on Wehni by \"Azaj\" Dagale and \"Kantiba\" Ayadar, who made him Emperor, while the reigning Emperor, Tekle Giyorgis, was in the field campaigning against several revolts. Tekle Giyorgis started from Aringo to suppress this threat, but the \"Dejazmaches\" Amade and Ali Borshe, with detachments of \"Ras\" Aligaz's followers, met him at the village of Salam, and tried to encircle his army; Tekle Giyorgis managed to escape and crossed over the Abay to find refuge in Gojjam. Meanwhile, one of the first acts of Hezqeyas made as emperor was to appoint \"Ras\" Haile Yosadiq governor of Gojjam and \"Fitawrari\" Ikonyan \"Dejazmach\" of Damot.\n\nAccording to E. A. Wallis Budge, in the early years of his reign Hezqeyas provided a refuge for Selasse, who had raided Tigray. Hezqeyas made raids towards the frontier with Sennar, which he plundered and lay waste to. However the \"Royal Chronicle\" provides a different narrative. Shortly after his elevation Emperor Tekle Giyorgis marched on Gondar, and upon learning of his advance Hezqeyas fled from the city. When Hezqeyas reached Kemekem, he was joined there by \"Dejazmach\" Hailu Eshte, \"Fitawrari\" Ikonyan, \"Dejazmach\" Hailu Terbenos, and others; reinforced, Hezqeyas marched back to Gondar and Tekle Giyorgis abandoned the city, proceeding to Gojjam by way of Dengel Ber, where he was joined by \"Ras\" Haile Yosadiq, and together they marched on Gondar. But once there, at the last moment Tekle Giyorgis declined to engage Hezqeyas in battle and instead proceeded to Mount Wehni, where he released his relatives from the Royal prison. Hezqeyas' supporters attempted to restore him to Gondar, but found \"Qegnazmach\" Gualej had occupied it; they defeated Gualej who fled to Sar Weha.\n\nFor much of the first year of Hezqeyas' rule the \"Ras Betwodded\" Aligaz could not directly intervene to support this emperor because he had his hands full consolidating his own position: he faced armed resistance to succeeding his brother \"Ras\" Ali, including members of his own family such as \"Dejazmach\" Alula, the \"Fitawrari\" Sadiq, and the \"Jantirar\" Yasufe. When he was able to resolve these challenges, he supported the Emperor Hezqeyas by sending the \"Maqet Azmach\" Wolde Mikael to assist him. Despite this, although the majority of the great lords supported Hezqeyas, Tekle Haymanot made his own appointments from his refuge in Gojjam, undermining Hezqeyas' authority, \"for the Kingdom was split in two.\"\n\nThe following year Tekle Giyorgis had a falling out with his primary supporter \"Ras\" Tekle Yosadiq; Tekle Giyorgis fled Gojjam, seeking the support of another noble, \"Dejazmach\" Gadlu, who refused to receive him; Tekle Giyorgis then turned to \"Ras\" Aligaz for help who responded positively, but once Tekle Haymanot arrived at Aligaz's palace at Filakit Gereger he was imprisoned at Emakina. Hezqeyas then spent the rainy season of 1790 at Filakit Gereger before returning to Gondar. The only action emperor Hezqeyas took that the chronicler felt was worth recording in 1791 was to send a general's robe to \"Ras\" Aligaz and spend the rainy season in Gondar.\n\nIt appears that in 1792 Emperor Hezqeyas acted against his primary supporter, \"Ras\" Aligaz: that year Hezqeyas, Abuna Yosab and Ichege Wolde Iyasus held a council where they declared that they will \"not submit to the Galla\"—a clear reference to either Aligaz or his family; the \"Royal Chronicle\" records that later that year a battle was fought near Gondar where the Emperor and the two leaders of the Ethiopian church were defeated. \"And on the coming of the Galla all that was what was done.\" Not long after this, Haile Wand Bewossen went to Emakina and freed Tekle Giyorgis; they proceeded to Lalibela where the Emperor resided for a while, apparently mustering his supporters. When Hezqeyas heard that his rival had left Emakina, he advanced at the head of an army from Gondar, first to Tsenjana, then to the house of \"Dejazmach\" Haile Eshte where they were joined by \"Ras\" Aligaz, where they \"took counsel together.\"\n\nSeveral battles then followed, ending with Hezqeyas fleeing to Dengel Ber. The restored Emperor Tekle Giyorgis then met with his supporters to decide on their next step, but a lack of consensus led to Tekle Giyorgis going to Wegera and \"Dejazmach\" Gabriel going to Begemder late in 1793. The \"Royal Chronicle\" records that towards the end of his reign one of the warlords, \"Dejazmach\" Wolde Gabriel, entered Gondar and \"made appointments and dismissals without leave of the Negus [Hezqeyas].\" A few months later the disgruntled \"Balambaras\" Asserat entered the capital city to expel the \"Dejazmach\", and in the fighting his men set fire to the Gan Takal, part of the Royal Enclosure.\n\nHezqeyas made one last attempt to retain the throne, before the end of 1793, entering Gondar with the support of \"Qegnazmach\" Mare'ed, \"Dejazmach\" Gugsa, and \"Dejazmach\" Aklog. However, Hezqeyas immediately returned to \"Ras\" Aligaz's camp, while Mar'ed and Aklog remained in Gondar for one more month before leaving for their provinces.\n\nThe \"Royal chronicle\" notes Hezqeyas met his son the Emperor Egwale Seyon in 1802, as he was travelling from Zage to Gondar. His son then escorted him for the rest of his journey and conducted him to the house of the Ichege. The traveler Henry Salt notes that Hezqeyas was still alive at the time of his visit to northern Ethiopia in 1809/1810.\n"}

From its faculty came what are today the dental schools of Temple University and the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe school was founded in 1856 with Henry C. Carey as president, and using many of the faculty of the defunct Philadelphia College of Dental Surgery which had been founded about four years earlier but had recently closed. Carey continued as president until his death in 1879.\n\nThe school's first location was 528 Arch Street, where its predecessor institution had been located, and in some ways the school can be considered an effective successor of that earlier school. In 1863, the school experienced a bit of a setback when some of its resources departed to found a competitor, the Philadelphia Dental College (which later merged into Temple University), and the school also moved to Tenth and Arch Streets. In 1878, another disruption occurred when the University of Pennsylvania began its own dental school. The University had been unable to secure a merger with either of the existing two schools, but was able to entice away a majority of the Pennsylvania College of Dental Surgery's faculty (four out of six professors). The school relocated again during this change, to Twelfth and Filbert Streets, hired additional faculty, and did not seem to suffer from the event.\n\nHenriette Hirschfeld-Tiburtius, born in Germany, became the first woman to take a full college course in dentistry at the school. Hirschfeld-Tiburtius graduated from the school in 1869. Fanny A. Rambarger became the second American woman to earn the degree of Doctor of Dental Surgery in 1874 when she graduated from the school.\n\nIn 1909, short of funds to modernize its equipment and enlarge its teaching staff, the school elected to close. Its remaining assets and records were given to the University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine, effectively merging into the University.\n\n"}

Mitchell had previously been involved with Springbank Distillery but following a quarrel with his brother John, with whom he owned Springbank, he first joined his other brothers at Reichlachan distillery before venturing out on his own.\n\nIn 1919 the distillery was sold as a result of the post-war economic downturn which was badly affecting all the distilleries in the Campbeltown Region. In 1924 the distillery changed hands again and by 1925 had ceased production with all remaining stock being sold off.\n\nAfter being used as a rifle range, an attempt to reopen the distillery by Maurice Bloch, who, with his brother, also owned the Glen Scotia distillery, failed due to Second World War as did a second attempt by Campbell Henderson Ltd. in the 1950s.\n\nIn late 2000 the company of Mitchell's Glengyle Ltd. was formed with the express purpose of renovating and rebuilding the Glengyle distillery. Mitchell's Glengyle is associated with the Springbank Distillery, and both operations come under the guidance of Mr. Hedley Wright, a descendant of the Mitchell Family, the original owners of both businesses.\n\nOver the next four years the buildings were repaired to an adequate standard, being restored in line with the local area and the buildings' listed status (protected by law). Since the original distillery equipment had been disposed of in the 1920s, new stills, malt mills, a mash tun and washbacks were installed along with all the related equipment. In reality much of this was not new, coming instead from other distilleries which had either ceased production or had surplus equipment.\n\nProduction at the new Glengyle distillery began in 2004 with the first spirit expected to be ready by 2014. Glengyle is the first new distillery of the millennium and is part of a trend in new distilleries which include Arran (1995) and Daftmill (2005).\n\nThe whisky from the Glengyle distillery is not called Glengyle, rather it is bottled under the name Kilkerran. This is because the name is owned by Loch Lomond Distillers, and used for their vatted malt. The name Kilkerran comes from the (\"head of the lake of Saint Kieran's cell\"), the name of a settlement where Saint Kieran is believed to have had a religious cell and where modern Campbeltown stands today.\n\n"}

This effect has been known for many years but in 2005 researchers in the group of K. Barry Sharpless presented a systematic study into this phenomenon. \n\nThe rate acceleration is found in certain Claisen rearrangements. In one typical example of this reaction at room temperature the chemical yield was found to be 100% on water after 120 hours compared to 16% with the same reaction in toluene or 73% in the neat reaction.\n\nEnhanced reactivity is also found in cycloadditions. The reaction of quadricyclane with DEAD is a 2σ + 2σ + 2π cycloaddition that on water takes place within 10 minutes at room temperature with 82% yield. The same reaction in toluene takes 24 hours at 80°C with 70% yield. An emulsion reaction in fluorinated cyclohexane takes 36 hours and the neat reaction takes even longer (48 hours). \n\nOther reactions with apolar reactants such as Ene reactions and Diels-Alder reactions also exhibit rate accelerations. An explanation is not available but it involves hydrogen bonding and the presence of a small amount of dissolved solute. This reaction type is of interest to green chemistry because it greatly reduces the usage of organic solvents, reaction product isolation is relatively easy, and it increases the yields and chemical purity with little extra expenditure, if not less.\n\nIn one study a coupling reaction between an indole and a quinone takes place at room temperature without catalyst in water in 82% chemical yield even though reactants and products are insoluble in this medium. The reaction is much less efficient in homogeneous systems such as dichloromethane, toluene and acetonitrile or even the solvent free reaction or even the water reaction but now at 50°C.\n\nThe \"On water\" effect is also studied in cycloadditions of the type:\n\nIn this reaction the alkyne \"methyl 2-octynoate\" reacts with triphenylphosphine to an intermediate zwitterionic allenolate, a dipolarophile for the 1,3-dipole 2-phenylnitrone. The primary regioselective [3+2]dipolar cycloaddition product then rearranges to a -dihydroisoxazole with regeneration of the phosphine. This reaction only takes place in water with lithium chloride added even though the reactants do not dissolve in this medium. In organic solvents such as toluene or dichloromethane no reaction takes place.\n\nAn alternative classification with broader scope is suggested by Yujiro Hayashi as he describes certain organocatalytic Aldol reactions as taking place in the presence of water. The observed effect in these reactions is not rate acceleration (that would be \"On Water\") but happens to be increase in enantioselectivity.\n\nIn the context of organocatalysis both concepts of on-water reactions and in-the-presence-of-water reactions have been criticized in 2007 as not so environmentally friendly by Donna Blackmond. According to Blackmond, separation of reaction product from the water phase usually requires organic solvent anyway and in reported aqueous systems the water phase can in reality be less than 10% of the total reaction mixture with another component forming the actual solvent. Blackmond also notes that in reported instances, the observed rate-acceleration in presence of water is in fact due to water suppressing reaction deactivation.\n"}

His early schooling, in the company of his brothers Henry and Horatio was private and sheltered. His upbringing was austere with little contact with other children or the world outside his home. He later studied at the London Institution and the Royal Institution under William Thomas Brande.\n\nBrayley abandoned an early inclination to follow his father's interests for science. He published on diverse topics in several scientific journals including the \"Philosophical Magazine\", for which he became an editorial assistant between 1823 and 1844. In 1829 and 1830, Brayley was employed by Rowland Hill to lecture on the physical sciences at his schools as Hazelwood, Edgbaston, Birmingham and Bruce Castle, Tottenham, London.\n\nIn 1834, he became librarian of the London Institution and in 1865 professor of physical geography. He lectured there on diverse subjects and also at the Royal Institution, the London Mechanics' Institute, and the Belgrave, Russell, and Marylebone Institutions. As a staff member of the London Institution he was often called on at the last minute to substitute for an indisposed lecturer and his talks included:\n\nMost of his scientific work involved the analysis and synthesis of the published ideas of others.

Its products have included the Mixmaster mixer, the Sunbeam CG waffle iron, Coffeemaster (1938–1964) and the fully automatic T20 toaster.\n\nThe company has endured a long history of struggles, including, in 2001, when it filed for bankruptcy and was also found to have committed massive accounting fraud, for which it was subject to SEC investigation. In 2002, Sunbeam emerged from bankruptcy as American Household, Inc.(AHI). Sunbeam was owned by Jarden Consumer Solutions after Jarden's acquisition in 2004, which was itself later purchased by Newell Rubbermaid (now Newell Brands).\n\nIn 1897 John K. Stewart and Thomas J. Clark incorporated their Chicago Flexible Shaft Company, which made horse trimming and sheep shearing machinery. In 1910 the company produced its first \"Sunbeam\" branded household appliance, the Princess Electric Iron (with an option to buy a fireproof metal storage box). The name \"Sunbeam\" came from a company wide contest to rebrand its growing home appliance business. Edwin J. Gallagher (1897–1983), a buyer and traffic manager for the company, won the contest and received a check for $1,000. The company did not officially incorporate its name to \"Sunbeam\" until 1946.\n\nIn 1928, the company's head designer, Swedish immigrant Ivar Jepson alongside Bernard Alton Graham invented the \"Mixmaster\" mixer. Introduced in 1930, it was the first mechanical mixer with two detachable beaters whose blades interlocked. Several attachments were available for the Mixmaster, including a juice extractor, drink mixer, meat grinderfood chopper, and slicershredder. The Mixmaster became the company's flagship product for the next forty years, but the brand also became known for the designs, mainly by Robert Davol Budlong, of electric toasters, coffee makers, and electric shavers, among other appliances.\n\nSunbeam acquired Rain King Sprinkler Company producing a popular lawn sprinkler line of the 1950s and 1960s. Meanwhile, Sunbeam continued to expand outside of Chicago. By the end of the 1970s, as the leading American manufacturer of small appliances, Sunbeam enjoyed about $1.3 billion in annual sales and employed nearly 30,000 people worldwide. The John Oster Manufacturing Company was acquired in 1960 by Sunbeam Corporation. In 1981, after Sunbeam was bought by Allegheny International Inc. of Pittsburgh, most of the Chicago-area factories were closed and the headquarters moved to downtown Pittsburgh. Under Allegheny International's ownership Sunbeam became the world's largest maker of small appliances through much of the 1980s. Allegheny International moved its headquarters into a 32-floor signature skyscraper in Pittsburgh. During this time the companies Allegheny controlled included John Zink Company (manufactured air pollution control devices) and Hanson Scale (manufactured bathroom scales and other balance machines).\n\nAllegheny's four principal divisions, including Sunbeam, went into decline through the late-1980s. Since Sunbeam-Oster was one of the most important divisions, responsible for nearly half of all sales, the stockholders were very concerned about the leadership. In 1986, the stockholders accused the Chairman and CEO, Robert Buckley of mis-appropriating funds. Buckley's successor, Oliver Travers, downsized considerably and by 1988, the company was essentially just Sunbeam and Oster. The decline continued aided by the stock market crash of October 1987 and Allegheny filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In the fall of 1989 an investment group called Japonica Partners purchased the remains of Allegheny for $250 million ($ million today) in a hostile takeover. The company was renamed Sunbeam-Oster Company, Inc. At this point the business was then divided into four divisions: Outdoor Products, Household Products, Specialty Products, and International Sales. The company headquarters were moved again from Pittsburgh to Providence, Rhode Island and then finally to Fort Lauderdale, Florida. By late 1991, Sunbeam-Oster's sales had increased 7% enabling it to make the Fortune 500 list.\n\nIn 1996, Albert J. Dunlap was recruited to be CEO and chairman of Sunbeam-Oster. Dunlap quickly announced that he would lay off half of Sunbeam-Oster’s work force among other measures. In 1997, Sunbeam reported massive increases in sales for its various backyard and kitchen items. Dunlap purchased controlling interest in Coleman and Signature Brands (acquiring Mr. Coffee and First Alert) during this time. Stock soared to $52 a share. However, industry insiders were suspicious. The sudden surge in demand for barbecues did not hold up under scrutiny. An internal investigation revealed that Sunbeam was in severe crisis, and that Dunlap had encouraged violations of accepted accounting rules. Dunlap was fired, and under CEO Jerry W. Levin, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2001.\n\nSoon after Sunbeam filed for bankruptcy, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Dunlap and four other Sunbeam executives, alleging that they had engineered a massive accounting fraud. The SEC said $60 million of Sunbeam's supposed record $189 million earnings for 1997 were the result of fraudulent accounting. It also said that Dunlap had falsely created the impression of massive losses in 1996 to make it look as if Sunbeam made a dramatic turnaround the next year. Along with Dunlap and several other officers, the SEC sued Phillip Harlow at Sunbeam's accounting firm, Arthur Andersen. Dunlap was ultimately banned from serving again as an officer or director of a public company.\n\nIn 2002, Sunbeam emerged from bankruptcy as American Household, Inc. (AHI), a privately held company. Its former household products division became the subsidiary Sunbeam Products, Inc.\n\nAHI was purchased in September 2004 by the Jarden Corporation, of which it was a subsidiary until 2016 when Jarden Corporation was purchased by Newell Rubbermaid to form Newell Brands\n\nJarden has continued to grow their brands, purchasing the Holmes Group in 2005, K2 in 2007, and Mapa Spontex in 2009. More recently, Jarden purchased Aero International and Quickie Manufacturing. As of 2015, Sunbeam batteries were made in China and imported into the United States by Greenbrier International and into Canada by DTSC Imports for Dollar Tree stores.\n\n"}

He had been made Emperor by \"Dejazmach\" Wolde Gabriel, and after he was deposed by Ras Aligaz, Baeda Maryam found refuge with Ras Guebra. The \"Royal chronicle\" provides further details: when Emperor Tekle Giyorgis I was absent from Gondar raiding near Shawra, Baeda Maryam was proclaimed emperor over the protests of Abuna Yosab III and the Ichege. At the same time Wolde Gabriel was elevated to \"Ras\" and \"Betwodded\". However, according to the \"Royal chronicle\" Baeda Maryam found little support beyond Wolde Gabriel: not long after his coronation, retainers of \"Ras\" Guebra at Shawada and Mosabit clashed with the retainers of Wolde Gabriel; \"Dejazmach\" Wolde Selassie appeared to support Baeda Maryam as emperor, but he sent a secret message to \"Dejazmach\" Haile Wand Bewossen of support. Both \"Ras\" Wolde Gabriel and Emperor Baeda Maryam campaigned in the provinces in a show of strength, but by the rainy season Baeda Maryam had returned to Gondar.\n\nTowards the end of 1795, \"Dejazmach\" Haile Wand Bewossen marched from Lasta, supported by Oromo from Wollo, and defeated Wolde Gabriel in battle at Felaqit Saturday 8 Teqemt. Wolde Gabriel retreated towards the Checheho pausing at Maryam Weha and his enemies at Agala. When Wolde Gabriel attempted to retire towards Sabisabar, he was attacked and defeated once again at Tsanfa Gumara. Wolde Gabriel withdrew to Quratsa, where the monks made peace between him and Haile Wand Bewossen. Wolde Gabriel then went to the monastery at Mahdere Maryam while Haile marched on Gondar, where he summoned Tekle Giyorgis to resume the throne.\n\nBy 1802, Baeda Maryam was reportedly a prisoner in Semien. By January 1813, he was still in Semien, at which time he visited \"Ras\" Wolde Selassie to seek his help in being restored to the throne, but the \"Ras\" declined to help. Pearce later notes that Wolde Selassie was thought to be supporting the claims of another former Emperor, Tekle Giyorgis, but did not act because \"he is persuaded to wait for the Abuna from Egypt and take him with him.\"\n"}

Superconducting magnetic levitation is due to superdiamagnetism, which repels a permanent magnet which approaches the superconductor, and flux pinning, which prevents the magnet floating away.\n\nSuperdiamagnetism is a feature of superconductivity. It was identified in 1933, by Walther Meissner and Robert Ochsenfeld, but it is considered distinct from the Meissner effect which occurs when the superconductivity first forms, and involves the exclusion of magnetic fields that already penetrate the object.\n\nFritz London and Heinz London developed the theory that the exclusion of magnetic flux is brought about by electrical screening currents that flow at the surface of the superconducting material and which generate a magnetic field that exactly cancels the externally applied field inside the superconductor. These screening currents are generated whenever a superconducting material is brought inside a magnetic field. This can be understood by the fact that a superconductor has zero electrical resistance, so that \"eddy currents\", induced by the motion of the material inside a magnetic field, will not decay. Fritz, at the Royal Society in 1935, stated that the thermodynamic state would be described by a single wave function.\n\n\"Screening currents\" also appear in a situation wherein an initially normal, conducting metal is placed inside a magnetic field. As soon as the metal is cooled below the appropriate transition temperature, it becomes superconducting. This expulsion of magnetic field upon the cooling of the metal cannot be explained any longer by merely assuming zero resistance and is called \"the Meissner effect\". It shows that the superconducting state does not depend on the history of preparation, only upon the present values of temperature, pressure and magnetic field, and therefore is a true thermodynamic state.\n\n\n"}

He was the son of Tekle Haymanot II. He may be identical with the Emperor Solomon whom the traveler Henry Salt lists as one of the Emperors still alive at the time of his visit in 1809/1810. E. A. Wallis Budge notes some authorities believe he was the same person as Baeda Maryam II.\n\nHe was largely a figurehead, appointed Emperor by \"Ras\" Wolde Selassie of Tigray and \"Ras\" Mare'ed in 1796. He spent the next year struggling with his rival, and brother, the former Emperor Tekle Giyorgis I; while he was preoccupied with Tekle Giyorgis, Gondar was surrounded in May 1797 by the rebel \"Balambaras\" Asserat, who did not have the military strength to enter the capital city, and limited his destruction to burning the property of Tekle Giyorgis in Gondar. Salomon was forced to flee Gondar, and took refuge in Axum where he lived under the protection of \"Ras\" Wolde Selassie. The \"Ras\" then supported the restoration of Salomon's brother Tekle Giyorgis. Not long afterwards, Salomon was invited to live with his brother as his guest.\n\nIn May 1797, while Tekle Giyorgis was campaigning in Begemder, Salomon disappeared from Tekle Giyorgis' camp and made his way back to Gondar where he received by \"Ras\" Mare'ed. \"Ras\" Mare'ed and \"Ras\" Guebre then restored Salomon as Emperor the following month. However, \"Ras\" Wolde Gabriel marched on Gondar and a battle was fought between him and \"Ras\" Mare'ed on 22 July; both Wolde Gabriel and Mare'ed were killed, but Salomon's supporters were defeated. Salomon was deposed and put into chains by \"Dejazmach\" Gugsa and \"Dejazmach\" Alula, who were in the victorious army, and replaced him five days later with Demetros, the great-grandson of Emperor Fasilides. In 1802, Salomon was reportedly still a prisoner, but at that time in Tigray.\n"}

{"id": "1940000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1940000", "title": "British Rail Class 508", "text": "British Rail Class 508\n\nThe British Rail Class 508 (or 4PER) electric multiple-unit (EMU) passenger trains were built by BREL York works in 1979-80. They were the fourth variant of BR's standard 1972 design for suburban EMUs, eventually encompassing 755 vehicles and five classes (313/314/315/507/508). They have mostly worked on the Merseyrail network since 1983, and continue to do so, now refurbished by Alstom's Eastleigh Works. The Class 508 unit is now years old, making them among the oldest units still in service on the UK mainland rail network, after the Class 313 and Class 507.\n\nThe class was developed for Merseyside following extensive trials and testing of the 4Pep/2Pep stock built in the early 1970s. Testing of Class 313 took place on the Northern Line on Merseyside, using 313013/063 which were loaned from the Great Northern Line of the Eastern Region to Hall Road depot. Original plans were drawn up for 58 Class 508s to be constructed, although costing issues limited the eventual number to 43. However, following planning and building, British Rail decided to divert the 508s to work alongside much older first-generation 4Sub EMUs in the London Waterloo area. The first unit was delivered to Strawberry Hill depot on 9 August 1979. Based at Wimbledon Park depot, they soon became problematic due to their non-standard dimensions and brake problems caused by leaf fall. Once a new build of Class 455 EMUs were complete, the Class 508s were slowly sent to their originally intended home on the Merseyrail network. Driver training began at Kirkdale on 17 February 1982, and the first Class 508 began service on the Northern Line the following month. The first Wirral Line service commenced on 8 June 1984, and the Class 508s had completely displaced the Class 503 fleet by the end of March 1985. The fleet was then working in parallel with the already well-established fleet of Class 507 EMUs across the River Mersey, which had been working on Merseyside since 1978.\n\nDelivered to the Southern Region as four-car sets numbered 508 001–043, all of the sets were reduced to three cars for Merseyside operation by the removal of one trailer and renumbered as 508/1. The individual passenger door controls were plated over before they were sent north. The spare trailer car from each set was incorporated into class 455/7 EMUs. Carriage numbering is as follows:\n\nMerseyrail operates 27 508s, which are used interchangeably between the Northern Line and the Wirral Line. They commonly work the following services:\n\nMerseyrail's fleet of Class 508 units are primarily maintained at Birkenhead North TMD, with minor maintenance being undertaken at Kirkdale TMD. The units, when out of service, have stabling points at various sidings around the Merseyrail network. These can be found at the station termini and the depots, as well as at Rock Ferry station and Birkenhead North station.\n\nConnex South Eastern leased twelve Class 508s freed up by capacity reductions on Merseyrail services in 1996 (508101/105/106/107/109/113/116/119/121/129/132/133), for operation on specific Kent services. Their main duties included to , to , to and to , as well as to for a short period. Units were based at Gillingham Depot.\n\nIn September 2006 new operator Southeastern announced that a cascade of rolling stock would see Class 466 units replace the 508s on the Sheerness and Medway Valley lines in the December 2006 timetable. Following this timetable change the fleet was reduced to six serviceable units. There were five sets in 'warm store' at Ashford Chart Leacon, and one unit, 508212, was cannibalised to keep the surviving service units in operation, including the swap of its TSO coach with one from a unit that ran into a tree on the Redhill to Tonbridge Line. With the transfer of the Tonbridge to London via Redhill services to Southern, Southeastern placed its remaining 508s in store in December 2008.\n\nSilverlink leased three 508s from Angel Trains in 2003 for operation on the Watford DC Line to assist its fleet of EMUs. These were withdrawn following the delivery of \"Capitalstar\" units. These three Class 508/3 units were modified by Alstom Eastleigh to designs provided by Interfleet Technology to make them inter-operable with Class 313 units.\n\n\nNetwork Rail's Route Utilisation Strategy for Merseyside has called for an expansion to Merseyrail's current fleet to allow for both additional services and lengthening of trains to six cars. In December 2009 it was reported by various sources that the former Southeastern and London Overground units would be transferred to Merseyrail. Two ex-London-Overground units were moved to Warrington Arpley Yard in November 2009, but returned south soon after. Meanwhile, the ex Southeastern 508s were moved to Telford Railfreight Terminal for storage between May 2010 and February 2011 before they moved to Eastleigh for further storage in late 2011. On 14 August 2012, 508212 was moved to the Fire Training College at Moreton-in-Marsh.\n\nClass 508s have appeared in many colours over their lifetimes, more so than any EMU of similar type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNamed units are as follows:\n\n\n\nOn 14 May 2012, Merseytravel announced that it was beginning a project for replacement of the 508s and 507s. The lease on the Class 507s and 508s has been extended to 2018. As part of the agreement with Angel Trains, the fleet will receive a refresh package including external re-livery, internal enhancements and engineering work.\n\nOn 11 January 2016 Merseytravel announced the short list of companies bidding to build new trains which will replace the Class 507 and Class 508s on the Merseyrail network. In December 2016, Merseytravel announced that Stadler had won the £460 million contract and that the new trains would be delivered from summer 2019 with all the old trains replaced by 2021.\n\n\n"}

Wallis Budge, Yonas was a forehead, proclaimed Emperor by \"Ras\" Isra'el of Begemder, and deposed by Gugsa, a chieftain of the Yejju Oromo people. However, the \"Royal Chronicle\" records that he was proclaimed Emperor after the Emperor who controlled Gondar, Salomon III, had been defeated by the rebel \"Balambaras\" Asserat, who forced him to flee Gondar. However, during Yonas' reign the realm was afflicted by a famine in which \"more men died than could be numbered.\" Yonas' son Mafu died 7 November then his wife Esther, both apparently from this famine. Lacking any support or rationale for his rule, the major warlords of the time -- \"Ras\" Mare'ed, \"Dejazmach\" Hailu Eshte, \"Dejazmach\" Wolde Selassie, and \"Ras\" Guebra -- all successfully petitioned to Emperor Tekle Giyorgis to return from exile in Waldebba and become ruler once again. Upon learning of Tekle Giyorgis' approach when he was still one day's march away, Yonas fled to sanctuary in the Abuna's palace.\n\nAfter months of hiding in the Abuna's palace, Yonas became a potential pawn when Waheldu, the brother of Asserat and also in conflict with the major warlords, attempted to have Yonas brought to him and used as his own candidate for Emperor. Tekle Giyorgis managed to foil this plot by giving amnesty to Yonas, and had him and Yonas' brother Goshu, \"dwell with him in friendship\" in the Royal Enclosure.\n\nBy 1802, he was a prisoner in Lasta. Henry Salt is reported to have met with his son Fasilidas in Adowa 16 September 1805, and who \"seemed anxious to have a private conversation [with Salt], but was prevented.\" Nathaniel Pearce reports that Yonas was living in exile in Gojjam at the time of his death, and died penniless \"without leaving sufficient even to purchase a coffin to receive ...

As a professional, she has won 12 tournaments, including 10 LPGA Tour events. Creamer has been as high as number 2 in the Women's World Golf Rankings. She was the 2010 U.S. Women's Open champion. As of the end of the 2019 season, Creamer was 10th on the all-time LPGA career money list with earnings of $12,131,822.\n\nAs an amateur, Creamer won numerous junior golf titles, including 11 American Junior Golf Association (AJGA) tournaments. Creamer joined the LPGA Tour in the 2005 season, and her victory in that year's Sybase Classic made her the LPGA's second-youngest event winner.\n\nCreamer was born in Mountain View, California, and raised in Pleasanton, the only child of an airline pilot father and stay-at-home mother. The family's home overlooked the first tee of the Castlewood Country Club's golf course. Creamer participated in acrobatic dancing and gymnastics during her childhood, and started playing golf when she was 10 years old. At the age of 12, she won 13 consecutive regional junior events in northern California, and the following year she became the top-ranked female junior golfer in California, before moving to Bradenton, Florida in 2000 and enrolling at IMG Pendleton School, a co-educational prep school for athletic students.\n\nDuring Creamer's amateur career, she won 19 national tournaments, including 11 American Junior Golf Association events, and was named Player of the Year by the AJGA in 2003. On two occasions (2002 and 2003), Creamer played on the United States team in the Junior Solheim Cup. She was a semi-finalist in the 2003 U.S. Girls' Junior and U.S. Women's Amateur, and reached the same stage of both events the following year. In June 2004 Creamer placed second in the LPGA Tour's ShopRite LPGA Classic, finishing one stroke behind Cristie Kerr. Later that year she tied for 13th in the U.S. Women's Open and represented the United States in the Curtis Cup.\n\nIn December 2004 Creamer won the LPGA Final Qualifying Tournament by five strokes to secure membership on the Tour for the 2005 season. She opted to turn professional immediately after the event at the age of 18.\n\nUpon joining the LPGA Tour in 2005, Creamer quickly became a top player. On May 22, she holed a 17-foot birdie putt on the final hole of the Sybase Classic in New Rochelle, New York, to win by one stroke. Creamer became the youngest winner of a multiple-round tournament in LPGA history. (Marlene Hagge won twice at a younger age than Creamer. Both wins came in 18-hole events.) Her record lasted until 2011, when Lexi Thompson won the Navistar LPGA Classic at the age of 16. On July 23, she claimed her second title of the year, winning the Evian Masters tournament in France by an eight-shot margin. She became the youngest and quickest player to reach $1 million in LPGA career earnings. In August Creamer won the NEC Open on the Japan LPGA tour, and added a victory at the Masters GC Ladies tournament two months later. Creamer earned a spot on the U.S. Solheim Cup Team, becoming the youngest player to do so. She helped the U.S. team win the cup, going 3–1–1 for the competition. Creamer won the LPGA Rookie of the Year award for her season, in which she earned over $1.5 million, second on the money list behind Annika Sörenstam, and recorded eight top-three finishes.\n\nAfter her strong first-year performance, Creamer was second behind Sörenstam in the inaugural Women's World Golf Rankings, which were released on February 20, 2006. Her 2006 season, however, was not as successful. She did not win a tournament, and was hampered by wrist and foot injuries during the year. Creamer still managed to earn over $1 million and make the cut in all 27 LPGA tournaments in which she played, compiling 14 top-10 finishes. Her best result of the season was a tie for second at The Mitchell Company Tournament of Champions.\n\nIn 2007, Creamer rebounded with two LPGA Tour titles. On February 17, she won her third career LPGA title at the SBS Open at Turtle Bay, making a 40-foot birdie putt on the 17th hole of the final round to defeat Julieta Granada by one shot. In November, Creamer won The Mitchell Company Tournament of Champions, defeating Birdie Kim by eight strokes. She also played in her second Solheim Cup, leading both sides in points earned. Creamer went unbeaten in five matches as the U.S. team retained the cup. For the\nseason, she posted 13 top-10 finishes and earned over $1.3 million, third on the money list.\n\nIn the 2008 season, Creamer won a career-high four LPGA events and made more than $1.8 million, the highest amount she has earned in a season. In February 2008, she earned her fifth LPGA title at the Fields Open in Hawaii, coming back from a late two-shot deficit with birdies on the final three holes. On April 27, Creamer came up short in a bid for her second win of the year, losing in a sudden-death playoff to Sörenstam at the Stanford International Pro-Am. The following week, Creamer bounced back at the SemGroup Championship by defeating Juli Inkster in a playoff. At the U.S. Women's Open, she entered the final round one shot off the lead and in good position to claim her first major championship victory. However, a five-over-par 78 on the last day dropped her into a tie for sixth.\n\nOn July 10 at the Jamie Farr Owens Corning Classic, she shot an 11-under 60, just one stroke off of the LPGA Tour record of 59 by Annika Sörenstam. She shot 60-65-70-73 to beat Nicole Castrale by two strokes. Creamer's fourth title of 2008 came in October's Samsung World Championship, where she won by one stroke and became the first American with four or more wins in an LPGA Tour season since Inkster had five tournament victories in 1999. In November of that same year, Creamer teamed with team International to defeat team Asia for the Lexus Cup.\n\nAt the LPGA Playoffs at the ADT, the last event of the 2008 season, Creamer was hospitalized with a stomach ailment, which was originally thought to be peritonitis. The ailment continued to affect her in the opening few months of the 2009 season, with doctors unable to make an exact diagnosis. At the 2009 U.S. Women's Open, held at Saucon Valley Country Club, Creamer finished tied for sixth. In her third Solheim Cup, she was 3–1 as the U.S. again won the competition. Creamer finished 10th on the 2009 LPGA money list with earnings of over $1.1 million. Her highest finishes during the season were a pair of second-place results, at the LPGA Corning Classic and Lorena Ochoa Invitational.\n\nCreamer withdrew from the first event of the 2010 season with a left thumb injury, which she had first sustained in June 2009 at the Wegmans LPGA tournament. The injury, believed to be stretched ligaments, required surgery in March after rehabilitation efforts proved unsuccessful. During the surgery, more severe damage to her thumb was discovered, including ulnar collateral ligament and palmar plate tears. She was forced into an extended absence from golf, and her thumb was still healing by the time she returned in June. In her return event, the ShopRite LPGA Classic, Creamer finished in seventh place at 10-under-par. On July 11, 2010, in her fourth tournament after returning from her thumb surgery, Creamer won the U.S. Women's Open. She was the only golfer under par for the tournament, with a score of 3-under-par, four strokes ahead of Suzann Pettersen and Na Yeon Choi. It was the first victory in a major in Creamer's career. The U.S. Women's Open was her only win of the season, but she had four top-10s in 14 starts.\n\nCreamer did not win a tournament during the 2011 season, though she did have seven top-five finishes and 10 top-10 finishes. Her highest finishes of the year were a pair of ties for second, at the RR Donnelley LPGA Founders Cup and CME Group Titleholders. Creamer was again selected to the U.S. Solheim Cup team in 2011. She posted victories in three of her first four matches, but lost in the singles to Catriona Matthew by a 6&5 score, as the American team lost to Europe.\n\nAt the 2012 Kingsmill Championship, Creamer finished the tournament tied with Jiyai Shin, and the two entered a playoff. They played eight playoff holes, each parring every time. The playoff was then suspended because of darkness, and it resumed the following day. Creamer bogeyed the ninth playoff hole, losing to Shin's par. It was the longest two-player playoff in LPGA Tour history. The following week, she recorded a third-place finish at the Women's British Open.\n\nCreamer earned over $800,000 and had seven top-10 finishes in the 2012 season, but was again unable to win any events.\n\nDuring the 2013 season, she made over $800,000 and finished in the top-10 six times. She also appeared in the 2013 Solheim Cup, but lost three of her four matches as the U.S. team lost 18–10. \n\nCreamer's 2014 began with two T-3 finishes in her first two tournaments, the ISPS Handa Women's Australian Open and the Pure Silk-Bahamas LPGA Classic. On March 2, 2014, Creamer captured her first LPGA tournament since the 2010 U.S. Women's Open. At the HSBC Women's Champions tournament in Singapore, she was tied with Azahara Muñoz after 72 holes. On the second playoff hole, she sank a 75-foot eagle putt for the win. For the remainder of the season, Creamer had one other top-10 result, a seventh-place finish at the 2014 Evian Championship. Her earnings in the 2014 LPGA Tour season were over $700,000, outside the top 20. Her money list ranking of 22nd was her lowest to date.\n\nAfter a stretch of four straight missed cuts, Creamer fell outside the top 40 in the world rankings by September 2015; she was dealing with the effects of swing and equipment changes. Despite not qualifying on points for the 2015 Solheim Cup team, Creamer was chosen for her sixth appearance in the event as a captain's pick. As part of a U.S. comeback from a 10–6 deficit entering the final session, she contributed the Cup-clinching point with a win in her singles match. For the 2015 season, her earnings were under $400,000, 47th on tour. \n\nCreamer changed swing instructors before the start of the 2016 season. Having worked with David Whelan for 15 years, she began receiving instruction from Gary Gilchrist after Whelan left his position at IMG Academy. At the first LPGA tournament of 2016, Creamer posted a top-five result at the Pure Silk-Bahamas LPGA Classic. She tied for fourth place at the JTBC Founders Cup, before going into an extended slump in performance in which she missed the cut seven times. Her 2016 LPGA Tour earnings fell under $300,000, outside the top 60.\n\nAt one point at the 2017 season, Creamer missed the cut four times in five tournaments, including the U.S. Women's Open. She was forced to play in a qualifier to earn a spot in the Women's British Open, and did not make the initial 2017 Solheim Cup team. However, she was chosen as an alternate after the withdrawal of Jessica Korda due to an injury. Creamer won three of her four matches as the U.S. team retained the Cup. In September, at the Evian Championship, an injured left wrist caused her to withdraw. After another withdrawal, she underwent season-ending surgery. Creamer had one top-10 finish in 2017, a tie for seventh at the ShopRite LPGA Classic. She ended the year in 89th place on the LPGA Tour money list with under $150,000 in season earnings.\n\nIn 2018, Creamer fell outside the top 100 in earnings, making about $71,000. Her highest finish of the season was 12th place at the Buick LPGA Shanghai, the last event in which she played. The following season, she improved to 91st on the money list with approximately $145,000 in earnings. Creamer had two top-10 results in 2019, with a tie for sixth at the Dow Great Lakes Bay Invitational her best finish. As of the end of the 2019 season, Creamer was 10th on the all-time LPGA career money list with earnings of $12,131,822.\n\nCreamer's drives are relatively short; her 2012 average driving distance of about 245 yards ranked 193rd on the LPGA Tour. Former player Beth Daniel has said of Creamer that her short hitting is \"stopping her from being a dominating player\". However, she is considered an accurate ball-striker. Creamer ranked outside the top 100 in putts per round in 2012, and \"Golf World\" magazine's Ryan Herrington described her putting as \"sometimes balky\". While she was the LPGA leader in greens in regulation in 2009 and was regularly high in the tour rankings for the statistic early in her career, by 2014 she fell to 51st.\n\nDue to her fondness for wearing pink, Creamer's friend Casey Wittenberg nicknamed her the \"Pink Panther.\" The sobriquet followed her when she turned pro. In addition to her pink outfits, Creamer sports the color on several of her golf accessories, including her club grips and golf bag. Creamer also uses a Pink Panther club head cover, in a nod to her nickname. From 2006 to 2009, she used a pink golf ball, provided by Precept Golf, during the last round of some tournaments.\n\nCreamer graduated from the IMG Pendleton School the week after her first LPGA victory in 2005. She moved to Isleworth in Windermere, Florida, in 2007.\n\nCreamer has endorsement deals with companies including TaylorMade-adidas, Citizen Watch Co., Ricoh, and Bridgestone Golf. \"Forbes\" estimated her 2013 endorsement income to be $4.5 million, and her total income placed her among the 10 highest-earning female athletes that year. Her likeness has been featured in EA Sports' \"Tiger Woods PGA Tour\" series of golf video games.\n\nSince 2005 Creamer has done charitable work for The First Tee, an organization that benefits junior golfers. She hosts the Paula 4 Kids Celebrity Event, an annual outing that raises money for The First Tee of Sarasota/Manatee. In addition, Creamer has appeared at youth golf clinics and donated scholarships to IMG Academy. She also has a foundation that aids junior golfers and military families. \n\nOn December 16, 2013, Creamer announced her engagement to Derek Heath, a United Airlines pilot and United States Air Force veteran. The couple were married in 2014. On March 11, 2018, Creamer told \"Golfweek\" that she and Heath were \"no longer together.\"\n\nLPGA Tour playoff record (2–2)\n\n\"Results not in chronological order before 2018.\"\n^ The Evian Championship was added as a major in 2013\n\nLA = Low amateur\nCUT = missed the half-way cut\nWD = withdrew\nT = tied\n\nSource:\n\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> \n\nPosition in Women's World Golf Rankings at the end of each calendar year.\nAmateur\n\nProfessional\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1940014", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1940014", "title": "Peer Steinbrück", "text": "Peer Steinbrück\n\nPeer Steinbrück (born 10 January 1947) is a German politician who was the chancellor-candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) in the 2013 federal election. Steinbrück served as the 8th Minister-President of North Rhine-Westphalia from 2002 to 2005, a member of the Bundestag from 2009 to 2016, and as Federal Minister of Finance in the first Cabinet of Chancellor Angela Merkel from 2005 to 2009.\n\nA graduate of the University of Kiel, Steinbrück began his political career in the office of Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and became chief of staff to Minister-President of North Rhine-Westphalia, Johannes Rau, in 1986. Steinbrück served as a state minister in both Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia and succeeded Wolfgang Clement as Minister-President of North-Rhine Westphalia in 2002. Governing in an SPD-Green coalition, Steinbrück’s tenure was noted for its attempt to reduce tax breaks and coal subsidies. In the 2005 state election, Steinbrück’s SPD lost to the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) opposition led by Jürgen Rüttgers, thus marking the end of Steinbrück’s tenure as Minister-President.\n\nAfter the 2005 federal election, which resulted in a Grand Coalition government under the leadership of new Chancellor Angela Merkel of the CDU, Steinbrück was appointed Minister of Finance. In this position, Steinbrück was charged with reducing Germany’s budget deficit, curbing public debt, and introducing changes in the taxation system. In the 2009 federal election, SPD chancellor-candidate Frank-Walter Steinmeier included Steinbrück as a member of his shadow cabinet.\n\nIn 2012, the National Assembly of the SPD elected Steinbrück as the chancellor-candidate of the SPD for the 2013 federal election. After he was nominated, controversy surrounding Steinbrück history of giving paid speeches to private banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank, as well as the potential conflict of interest surrounding his seat on the board of steel conglomerate Thyssenkrupp, prompted criticism from both centre-right members of Angela Merkel’s coalition as well as members of SPD’s left-wing. Steinbrück’s gaffe-prone campaign failed to gain traction, and the SPD was comfortably defeated by Merkel’s CDU in the federal election which took place on 22 September 2013.\n\nSteinbrück was born in Hamburg, on 10 January 1947, to Ilse (née Schaper; 1919–2011) and Ernst Steinbrück (1914–1998), an architect born in Danzig. After having been trained as an officer of the reserve of the Bundeswehr, Steinbrück studied economics at the University of Kiel. He graduated in 1974.\n\nAfter graduation Steinbrück worked for several German ministries and, from 1978 to 1981, in the office of German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt. He held positions in the Permanent Representative Office of the Federal Republic of Germany in East Berlin from 1981 to 1985. In the 1980s, Steinbrück was the chief of staff to the Minister President of North Rhine-Westphalia, Johannes Rau.\n\nIn 1993, he became the State Minister of Economic Affairs and Infrastructure in the state of Schleswig-Holstein. He then returned to North Rhine-Westphalia, where he became the Minister of Economic Affairs and Infrastructure in 1998 and Finance Minister in 2000.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2005 Steinbrück served as the 8th Minister President (\"Ministerpräsident\" or governor) of North Rhine-Westphalia. He headed a coalition government between the SPD and the Green Party.\n\nIn December 2002, Steinbrück accompanied Chancellor Gerhard Schröder on a visit to China for meetings with President of the People's Republic of China Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji.\n\nIn 2003, Steinbrück and Roland Koch, the Christian Democrat premier of Hesse, together drew up a plan to reduce tax breaks and subsidies, including those on coal. The subsidies were a particularly sensitive issue in North Rhine-Westphalia, where most of the coal mines were located then. Nevertheless, Steinbrück and Koch agreed that all subsidies were to be reduced by 12 percent over several years. Steinbrück was a supporter of the so-called \"Agenda 2010\".\n\nIn the state election on 22 May 2005, Steinbrück's SPD lost to the Christian democratic (CDU) opposition. This loss also had consequences for federal politics: then German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, who already was enfeebled by weak opinion polls and criticism within his own party, announced plans to call an early federal election for the Bundestag. This resulted in the 2005 federal election four months later, after which Angela Merkel became Chancellor for the first time.\n\nAfter the 2005 federal election, SPD and CDU formed a Grand Coalition under the leadership of new Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU). Peer Steinbrück became finance minister of Germany in November 2005. He was charged with reducing Germany's budget deficit, curbing public debt and introducing changes in the taxation system. Following his initiative, Germany introduced a flat rate withholding tax of 25 percent on private income from capital and capital gains, with the aim of preventing tax evasion. He oversaw and orchestrated the regulatory and fiscal efforts to counter the largest financial and economic crisis in post-War history.\n\nFrom 2005, Steinbrück also served as deputy chairman of the SPD. Ahead of the 2009 elections, German foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier included Steinbrück in his shadow cabinet of 10 women and eight men for the Social Democrats’ campaign to unseat incumbent Angela Merkel as chancellor.\n\nIn a joint article in the \"Financial Times\" on 14 December 2010, Steinbrück and Steinmeier proposed to solve the European debt crisis with \"a combination of a haircut for debt holders, debt guarantees for stable countries and the limited introduction of European-wide bonds in the medium term, accompanied by more aligned fiscal policies.\" In February 2011, Steinmeier proposed Steinbrück as a candidate to lead the European Central Bank.\n\nOn 9 December 2012 an extraordinary National Assembly of the SPD elected Steinbrück, with 93.45 percent of the votes, as candidate for Federal Chancellor, to run in the 2013 federal elections against Angela Merkel. Sigmar Gabriel, the party’s chairman at the time, who had also been considered a possible candidate, said the leadership had agreed to nominate Steinbrück after Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the party’s parliamentary leader, withdrew from the contest.\n\nDuring his election campaign, Steinbrück promised to introduce rent controls, to raise taxes and use those funds for education and infrastructure. He also accused Merkel of showing a lack of passion for Europe in the euro crisis because she was brought up in communist East Germany. In the run-up to the elections, he criticized Merkel's support for hardline austerity measures in indebted eurozone countries and reiterated his support for the euro, saying that its demise would \"throw back European unification by 20 to 30 years\" and result in currency appreciation that would \"destroy any business.\" He also travelled to Greece for meetings with President Karolos Papoulias, Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras and PASOK chairman Evangelos Venizelos.\n\nOn foreign policy issues, Steinbrück criticized Merkel for not joining Germany's allies in their military efforts against Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Also, he promised he would radically curtail German arms exports to countries such as Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn three stages from mid-May 2013, Steinbrück announced the twelve members of his shadow cabinet, including Cornelia Füllkrug-Weitzel, Gesche Joost, Yasemin Karakaşoğlu, Christiane Krajewski, Karl Lauterbach, Matthias Machnig, Thomas Oppermann, Florian Pronold, Oliver Scheytt, Klaus Wiesehügel, Manuela Schwesig and Brigitte Zypries. He signalled his support for Jürgen Trittin, at the time co-chairman of the Green Party’s parliamentary group, to become minister of finance in the case of his win.\n\nAlthough Steinbrück soon won the endorsement of former Chancellors Gerhard Schröder and Helmut Schmidt, his gaffe-prone campaign never gained traction against the popular Merkel. His previously established reputation as a crisis manager who had played a frontline role in fighting the global financial crisis was overshadowed by faux pas throughout the campaign. He clashed with Sigmar Gabriel, the party leader, whom Steinbrück said had not been supportive of his campaign.\n\nOn 22 September, Steinbrück's Social Democrats won 25.7 percent, while Merkel's CDU and its Bavarian sister party CSU together won 41.5 percent of the vote. Following the elections, Steinbrück was part of the SPD delegation to hold exploratory talks with the CDU/CSU on forming a coalition government.\n\nAs member of parliament, Steinbrück served on the Committee on Foreign Affairs and as chairman of the German-American Parliamentary Friendship Group from 2013 until 2016.\n\nIn March 2015, Steinbrück joined the \"Agency for Modernization of Ukraine\", an initiative led by Dmitry Firtash to develop a comprehensive plan of political and economic reforms in the country.\n\nIn September 2015, Steinbrück announced that he would not stand in the 2017 federal elections. He vacated his Bundestag seat in the end of September 2016.\n\nSteinbrück has been a prominent speaker for the SPD, especially on economic matters.\n\nDuring a 2007 visit to Washington for meetings with the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, after the collapse of Amaranth Advisors, Steinbrück lobbied for the development of an internationally accepted \"code of conduct\" for the hedge fund industry, arguing that a \"sizable number\" of hedge funds \"are not behaving properly.\"\n\nSteinbrück predicted in 2008, in the wake of Lehman Brothers’s bankruptcy, that the United States’ days as a financial superpower were numbered. In December 2008 interview with \"Newsweek\", he controversially attacked the British Keynesian approach to economic policy. He raised scepticism about the effectiveness of large fiscal stimulus packages and criticized the resulting increase in public debt. His comments led Steinbrück into a highly public press battle with Paul Krugman, the Nobel laureate economist and \"New York Times\" columnist. An adherent to Keynes' theory that government spending creates growth, Krugman wrote in December 2008—in a direct attack on Steinbrück—that the primary \"multiplier effect\" that government spending programs were having was that of \"multiplying the impact of the current German government's boneheadedness.\"\n\nDuring his time as German Finance Minister, Steinbrück repeatedly accused the United Kingdom of pandering to the City of London by hindering efforts to reform global financial markets. In 2009, Steinbrück opposed any plans by the G-20 major economies to limit the size of banks to avoid individual institutions wielding too much influence in future and posing a risk. At the 2009 G-20 Pittsburgh summit, he supported a Dutch proposal to limit banking executives' bonuses to the level of their fixed annual salary. Also, he called for a global tax to be imposed on financial transactions in a bid to end what he derided as \"binge-drinking\" on markets.\n\nIn a 2010 interview on German television, it appeared that Steinbrück, who had adopted a very critical stance of the shadow banking system, attributed characteristics of the private equity industry to hedge funds.\n\nIn 2012, Steinbrück tabled a plan for sweeping financial regulation that he intended to be a main plank of his election platform. It included compelling banks to finance a €200 billion rescue fund, and splitting investment from retail banking.\n\nAt the 2006 meetings of the IMF and the World Bank in Singapore, Steinbrück argued that, as the world's third largest economy after the US and Japan, Germany must keep its influence in the IMF amid wide-ranging reform of the institution, ruling out suggestions that the Eurozone members should have only one seat on the board as part of the planned overhaul of IMF members' votes.\n\n\n\nSteinbrück has been labelled by the media as a sharp-witted political pugilist whose frank opinions have occasionally attracted controversy.\n\nAs soon as he was nominated as the Social Democrat’s challenger to German Chancellor Angela Merkel in the 2013 federal elections, Steinbrueck announced he would quit the board of steel conglomerate ThyssenKrupp and all outside work, though not an unpaid seat on soccer club Borussia Dortmund's board where he saw no conflict of interest. His decision prompted a slew of criticism of his high earnings outside the Bundestag from Merkel's center-right coalition but also from the SPD's left wing and from anti-graft campaigners. The seat on ThyssenKrupp's board and all but four of the other 85 appointments and engagements listed for the time between 2009 and 2012 were in excess of 560,000 euros.\n\nLater in his campaign, Steinbrück canceled a speech at Bank Sarasin & Cie after \"Süddeutsche Zeitung\" reported that the Swiss private bank was being investigated by German prosecutors for possible tax evasion. Soon after, he declared he had earned 1.25 million euros ($1.6 million) by giving 89 speeches between 2009 and 2012 at companies and banks including Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase, BNP Paribas, Sal. Oppenheim, Union Investment, Ernst & Young, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer and Baker & McKenzie. This sum was in addition to his salary as a member of parliament, which was over 7,500 euros a month. The data also showed Steinbrück gave 237 other addresses for free to schools and charities, and got industry lobby groups to donate to charity instead of paying him. At the same time, he said the chancellor’s salary, at about 250,000 euros annually, is too low because regional savings bank directors are paid more.\n\nIn April 2007, when Germany held the presidencies of both the European Union and the G7, Steinbrück was criticized for going on holiday with his family in Namibia instead of attending a meeting of G7 finance ministers in Washington and for refusing the offer of other G7 members to succeed Gordon Brown as chair of the International Monetary and Finance Committee (IMFC).\n\nAs finance minister, Steinbrück criticized Germany's neighbours in a row over tax havens.\n\nIn the wake of German investigations against the LGT Group of Liechtenstein in 2008, Steinbrück threatened that Germany would impose a levy on all fund transfers to the principality, in effect reinstating pre-1990s-style capital controls, if the country did not change its ways. Speaking to reporters in Paris after a conference on measures to combat tax avoidance, he said Switzerland deserved to be on a tax haven \"black list\" being drawn up by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development because Swiss investment conditions encouraged some German taxpayers to commit fraud. He called on other European countries to \"use the whip\" on Switzerland over its tax havens, likening the Swiss to \"Indians\" running scared from the cavalry.\n\nHis criticism of the Swiss banking secrecy caused some tensions between Germany and Switzerland. The German ambassador to Bern was summoned to the foreign ministry to hear Switzerland's official reaction to what Foreign Minister Micheline Calmy-Rey described as Steinbrück's \"contemptuous and aggressive\" comments.\n\nOn 26 February 2013 Steinbrück said he was \"appalled that two clowns have won\" Italy's February 24–25 election. The vote was actually inconclusive with no party garnering a majority in parliament, although the anti-establishment party of commentator and comedian Beppe Grillo surged to about one fourth of valid votes. In reaction, Italian President Giorgio Napolitano cancelled a dinner in Berlin with Steinbrück, who was German opposition's chancellor candidate.\n\n\n\nSteinbrück's wife, Gertrud (born 1950), is a former biology and politics teacher at a high school in Bonn. They have three children.\n\n"}

He was the son of Hezqeyas.\n\nAccording to Henry Salt, after a period when the Imperial throne was held by a number of different appointees due to \"the preponderance of the different provinces\", \"Rasses\" Wolde Selassie of Tigray and Gugsa of Yejju, and chief of the Oromo, brought this rapid succession to an end by making Egwale Seyon Emperor. He then married Walatta Iyasus, the sister of Ras Gugsa, and they had five children. When Salt visited \"Ras\" Wolde Selassie at his palace in Chalacot in 1809/1810, the Emperor's brother, \"Kenyazmach\" Iyasu, was also a guest of the Ras.\n\nThe writer of \"The Royal chronicle of Abyssinia\" notes that, after one brief campaign into Wegera with \"Ras\" Gugsa at the beginning of his reign, which was notable for Ewale Seyon's meeting with his father Hezqeyas, he never left Gondar. The chronicler later laments\n\nFrom 1803 on, his reign was marked by constant civil war. Most of the battles were part of a three-sided struggle between \"Ras\" Gugsa, \"Ras\" Zewde of Gojjam, and Wolde Selassie. Egwale Seyon was also twice attacked at Gondar (1804 and 1808) by the disgraced \"Balambaras\" Asserat, who was supported by armies of the Oromo who lived south of the Abay River. Following the death of Abuna Yosab III in 1803, \"Ras\" Gugsa plundered the episcopal properties, but \"Ras\" Zewde forced him to return a part of what his men had stolen. A little more than five years later, \"Ras\" Zewde attempted to depose Egwale Seyon and replace him with the former Emperor Tekle Giyorgis, but on February 24, 1809 \"Ras\" Gugsa arrived and \"Ras\" Zewde's army refused to fight; \"Ras\" Zewde escaped on foot, and returned to his village.\n\nSalt notes that throughout the turmoil of his reign, Egwale Seyon lived \"neglected at Gondar, with a very small retinue of servants, and an income by no means adequate to the support of his dignity; so that, as he possesses neither wealth, power, nor influence in the state; royalty may be considered, for a time, almost eclipsed in the country.\" Nathaniel Pearce commented, following the Emperor's death, that Egwale Seyon \"was always very sickly and of a weak constitution\".\n\nDespite his political impotence, one tangible accomplishment of Egwale Seyon's reign was his benefaction of Debre Berhan Selassie Church, known for its impressive collection of paintings; his patronage is proved by his numerous portraits in that church.\n"}

This score means, after digestion of the protein, it provides per unit of protein 100% or more of the indispensable amino acids required.\n\nThe formula for calculating the PDCAAS percentage is: (mg of limiting amino acid in 1 g of test protein / mg of same amino acid in 1 g of reference protein) x fecal true digestibility percentage.\n\nThe PDCAAS value is different from measuring the quality of protein from the protein efficiency ratio (PER) and the biological value (BV) methods. The PER was based upon the amino acid requirements of growing rats, which noticeably differ from those of humans. The PDCAAS allows evaluation of food protein quality based on the needs of humans as it measures the quality of a protein based on the amino acid requirements (adjusted for digestibility) of a 2- to 5-year-old child (considered the most nutritionally demanding age group). The BV method uses nitrogen absorption as a basis. However, it does not take into account certain factors influencing the digestion of the protein and is of limited use for application to human protein requirements because what is measured is maximal potential of quality and not a true estimate of quality at requirement level. Nevertheless, BV can be used to assess requirements of protein derived from foods with known quality differences and measure the proportion of absorbed nitrogen which is retained and presumably used for protein synthesis as an accurate indicator for protein measurement.\n\nThe FDA gave two reasons for adopting the PDCAAS in 1993: 1) PDCAAS is based on human amino acid requirements, which makes it more appropriate for humans than a method based on the amino acid needs of animals. 2) The Food and Agricultural Organization/World Health Organization (FAO/WHO) had previously recommended PDCAAS for regulatory purposes.\n\nAmino acids that move beyond the terminal ileum in the body are less likely to be absorbed for use in protein synthesis. They may pass out of the body or become absorbed by bacteria, thus appearing to have been digested instead of being present in the feces. The PDCAAS takes no account of where the proteins have been digested.\n\nSimilarly, amino acids that are lost due to antinutritional factors present in many foods are assumed to be digested according to the PDCAAS.\n\nDue to this in 2013 the FAO proposed changing to Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score.\n\nThe PDCAAS method may also still be considered incomplete, since human diets, except in times of famine, almost never contain only one kind of protein. However, calculating the PDCAAS of a diet solely based on the PDCAAS of the individual constituents is impossible, because one food may provide an abundance of an amino acid that the other is missing, in which case the PDCAAS of the diet is higher than that of any one of the constituents. To arrive at the final result, all individual amino acids would have to be taken into account, though, so the PDCAAS of each constituent is largely useless.\n\nFor example, grain protein has a PDCAAS of about 0.4 to 0.5, limited by lysine. On the other hand, it contains more than enough methionine. White bean protein (and that of many other pulses) has a PDCAAS of 0.6 to 0.7, limited by methionine, and contains more than enough lysine. When both are eaten in roughly equal quantities in a diet, the PDCAAS of the combined constituent is 1.0, because each constituent's protein is complemented by the other.\n\nA more extreme example would be the combination of gelatine (which contains virtually no tryptophan and thus has a PDCAAS of 0) with isolated tryptophan (which, lacking all other essential amino acids, also has a PDCAAS of 0). Despite individual scores of 0, the combination of both in adequate amounts has a positive PDCAAS, with the limiting amino acids isoleucine, threonine, and methionine. Further, according to a 2000 study by Gerjan Schaafsma, \"The questions about the validity of the amino acid scoring pattern and the application of the true fecal rather than the true ileal digestibility correction, as well as the truncation of PDCAAS values warrant a critical evaluation of PDCAAS in its current form as a measure of protein quality in human diets.\" Also, the scientific community has raised critical questions about the validity of PDCAAS (the validity of the preschool-age child amino acid scoring pattern, the validity of the true fecal digestibility correction and the truncation of PDCAAS values to 100%).\n\nIn addition, the fact that four proteins, all with different amino acid profiles, receive identical scores of 1.0 limits its usefulness as a comparative tool. Since they have different compositions, it is natural to assume that they perform differently in the human body and should have different scores. In short, this method, however, gives no distinction of their performance relative to each other, because after they pass a certain point, they are all capped at 1.0 and receive an identical rating. This is because in 1990 at a FAO/WHO meeting, it was decided that proteins having values higher than 1.0 would be rounded or \"leveled down\" to 1.0 as scores above 1.0 are considered to indicate the protein contains essential amino acids in excess of the human requirements.\n\nThis reference pattern is based on the essential amino acid requirements for preschool children aged 1-3 years as published in Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acids (2005). Adults aged 18+ will have slightly lower requirements.\n\nA PDCAAS value of 1 is the highest, and 0 the lowest. The table shows the ratings of selected foods.\n\n\n 17.

The aircraft crashes and its cargo, a low-level atomic bomb, explodes. The resulting cataclysm awakens a prehistoric monster that has the appearance of a giant turtle with teeth and large tusks. Japanese scientists on an expedition nearby (including Drs. Hidaka, Kyoko and Aoyagi) are given a \"devil stone\" by an Inuit chieftain, who explains that the creature is called Gamera.\n\nGamera destroys the American jet with his fire breath and escapes into the sea. The monster heads to Japan and surfaces in Sagami Bay where Toshio, a boy releasing his own pet turtle, sees him. Gamera destroys the city of Fujisawa and a lighthouse. However, he also rescues Toshio from falling from the lighthouse, and then retreats back into the sea. Scientists and government officials hold a conference to discuss killing the monster.\n\nGamera destroys a research ship, kills the crew and then heads to Tokyo. He is attacked with freeze bombs and blown up, falling onto his back as a result. The scientists indicate that a turtle cannot right itself once on its back and that Gamera will therefore die of starvation. Gamera then pulls its head, limbs and tail into its shell, emits flames from its front leg and back leg cavities, and flies away by rising up into the air and spinning around like a flying saucer.\n\nToshio and his family decide to stay with an uncle in Tokyo because they have nowhere else to go. Toshio explains to the professor that Gamera is lonely and, like regular turtles, he is not evil. Dr. Hidaka, meanwhile, has observed that Gamera consumes fossil fuels and may seek out atomic bombs for the energy they provide. He also emits radio signals. This leads the Japan Atomic Energy Commission to see an opportunity to use its nuclear stockpiles. Meanwhile, disasters and accidents start to occur: Koto Ward is struck by flash floods and ships collide in Tokyo Bay. Dr. Hidaka claims that Gamera has caused these accidents because he is hiding in the bay.\n\nAn international scientific conference is called and they decide to use \"Z Plan\", based at Oshima Island, involving a consortium of American, Soviet and Japanese scientists to eradicate Gamera. Before any action can be taken, however, Gamera arrives at Haneda Airport, destroying the control tower, and proceeds to wreak havoc in Tokyo (including destroying the Tokyo Tower). Toshio and his family evacuate again, but Toshio gets lost in the confusion.\n\nZ Plan is still not ready, so the scientists plan to keep Gamera at bay in the meantime by confining him to an oil refinery. Dr. Hidaka has surmised that Gamera is gaining energy by consuming fires at the refinery and they will therefore keep shipping petroleum there by train to keep Gamera occupied for 24 hours. Toshio finds his way to the refinery and sneaks on board a train bound for Gamera, chased by the refinery chief. They are both thrown from the train when it explodes, but are unharmed and Toshio is sent on his way.\n\nZ Plan is finally completed and Toshio sneaks on board a ship delivering supplies to Oshima. Gamera is lured to Oshima by lighting an oil slick path from Tokyo to the island, but an oncoming typhoon blows the fire out. Aoyagi starts a bonfire and Gamera makes his way to a volcano erupting on the island. The next day, Z Plan is put into action: Gamera is lured into the nose cone of a giant rocket and launched on a one-way trip to Mars. The worldwide announcement of success extols the triumph of science over ideology. Aoyagi and Kyoko go off together and Toshio decides he is not sad, because he is going to be a scientist one day so he can visit Gamera on Mars.\n\n\nThe following cast were added in the 1966 American theatrical release of the film:\n\nThe success of Toho's \"Godzilla\" films led to the rival company Daiei to create a monster series of its own. Director Noriaki Yuasa initially began production on a film titled \"Dai gunju Nezura\" () which would involve real rats crawling over miniatures of cities. However, the rats received for the film had fleas, which halted production. As the miniatures for the film were already built, Masaichi Nagata had to develop a giant monster to attack the city and had the idea for a giant flying turtle. Yuasa and screenwriter Nisan Takahashi developed the idea into the 1965 film \"Gamera, the Giant Monster\". Special effects technician Ryosaku Takayama designed the turtle suit used in the film.\n\nThe films created by Daiei were aimed at younger children than the \"Godzilla\" films of the period and had lower budgets. \"Gamera, the Giant Monster\" was the only film in the series shot in black-and-white. Yuasa stated that the first \"Gamera\" film had a budget of about ¥40 million and that the film went \"over budget a little bit\". Due to the commercial success of the first \"Gamera\" film, the second film had a expanded budget that Yuasa stated was 80,000,000 yen.\n\n\"Gamera, the Giant Monster\" was released in Japan on November 27, 1965. The film was a bigger hit than the studio expected, which led to a higher budget for the second film, \"Gamera vs. Barugon\".\n\nAn edited version of the film was released theatrically in the United States on December 15, 1966 as \"Gammera the Invincible\". This version contained additional scenes with American actors, a new theme song by the Moons and all Japanese dialogue dubbed in English, making the U.S. version run at 86 minutes. These included the scenes with the Alaskan army base, the Pentagon and the U.N. headquarters. This version of the film was also shown frequently on American television in the 1970s.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 20% based on 5 reviews and an average rating of 3.65/10.\nFrom contemporary reviews, \"Byro.\" of \"Variety\" stated that Plan Z in the film was an \"appropriate idea for \"Gammera\", a film which can be rated as Grade Z\" The review went on to note that the films script and acting was \"thoroughly predictable and pedestrian level\". From retrospective reviews, AllMovie gave the film a positive review complimenting the films direction, special effects, and cinematography stating, \"All in all, \"Gammera the Invincible\" is a solidly-crafted, engaging monster mash - just make sure you see the original Japanese version\".\n\nKeith Phipps from AV Club stated \"Gamera finds the perfect intersection between silly and cool, looking both dangerous and ridiculous as he tromps around. He’s no Godzilla, but he’s got his own thing going on.\" Arnold T. Blumberg from IGN awarded the film 6 out of 10, stating, \"\"Gamera\" retains a kitschy charm but it was an inauspicious debut for a beloved icon.\" James McCormick from Criterion Cast called the film \"a wonderful slice of schlock that you can watch again and again and appreciate the workmanship and love put into every scene.\"\n\nSandy Frank Film Syndication released the film on VHS as \"Gamera\" in 1987. This release featured an English dub for the Japanese version and replaced the original soundtrack with a new score. Neptune Media released the original, unaltered Japanese version and the altered U.S. version on VHS in 1999. Alpha Video released a cropped public domain version of the U.S. version on DVD in 2003, along with other public domain Gamera films.\n\nVintage Home Entertainment released \"Gamera: The Ultimate Collection\" on May 17, 2005 which included a compilation of the entire film series. Shout! Factory released the original Japanese version of the film on DVD in May 2010. Mill Creek Entertainment released the original Japanese version of the film, combined with other Gamera films, on Blu-ray in April 2014. The film was last released by Willette Acquisition Corp. on Feb 17, 2015.\n\n\"Gamera, the Giant Monster\" was one of the few films featured twice on \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" (both times as \"Gamera\"), the first time as part of the initial KTMA series (episode 5) and again in Season 3 (episode 2). Filmmaker Guillermo del Toro named the original \"Gamera\" film amongst his top five favorite \"kaiju\" films. A character named \"Baby Gamera\", who has an appearance and abilities similar to Daiei's Gamera, appears in the manga and anime of \"Dragon Ball\".\n\n\n\n"}

They were one of the prominent independent teams prior to World War I before organized league play began.\n\nIn 1907, the Brooklyn Royal Giants joined the National Association of Colored Baseball Clubs of the United States and Cuba. The league lasted three seasons and included the teams Philadelphia Giants, Cuban X-Giants, Cuban Stars of Havana, and the Cuban Giants of New York.\n\nDuring the 1920s, under the ownership of Nat Strong, a white New York City booking agent, the team fell into somewhat of a decline, and did very poorly while in the Eastern Colored League. The Giants played their home games while part of the Eastern Colored League at Dexter Park in Queens.\n\nThe Giants played a pair of games against teams featuring Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig. On October 11, 1926, the Giants took on a squad featuring Babe Ruth in Bradley Beach, New Jersey. The Giants won this game 3-1. Following this, in 1928, the Giants played a combined team of the Bustin' Babes (Ruth's barnstorming squad) and the Larrupin' Lous (Gehrig's barnstorming squad) in Asbury Park, New Jersey. The Giants returned to independent play in 1928 and rebuilt the roster, but the quality of the rebuilt team never matched that of the early years. By the mid-1930s, the quality was no better than that of a minor league team, and in the early 1940s it had fallen to a semi-professional status. The team disbanded in 1942.\n\n\n"}

After World War II, he began working for the Peter Maurice publishing company. It was there that he met the singer Petula Clark in 1947. In 1949, Henderson introduced Clark to Alan A. Freeman, who, together with her father Leslie, formed the Polygon record label, for which she recorded her earliest hits. \n\nClark and Henderson later had a romantic relationship, which is said to have broken up because he did not want to be \"Mr. Petula Clark\". In 1957, George Hamilton IV scored a hit with Henderson and Jack Fishman's composition \"Why Don't They Understand\", a song they wrote about Henderson's relationship with Clark. Henderson later penned \"There's Nothing More To Say\" about their split. Clark recorded both songs as album tracks. \n\nIn 1955, Clark suggested Henderson be allowed to record his own music, and he enjoyed two chart hits on Polygon, \"Sing It With Joe\" and \"Sing It Again With Joe\", both medleys of popular songs.\n\nHenderson's biggest hit was \"Trudie\", which made number 14 in the UK Singles Chart, and number 1 in the sheet music chart, where it was the biggest hit of 1958.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nBagabag is famous for its buko pie (coconut pie) in the Cagayan Valley region and it is the gateway to the world-famous Banaue Rice Terraces. It is considered the pineapple region of Nueva Vizcaya. The main crops produced are rice, corn, coconut, mango, and pineapple. Bagabag has the largest tilapia farming in the region. Main resources include agriculture, livestock, and fruit-bearing trees plantation. Main industries include furniture, hollow block factory, tilapia farming, buko pie, pineapple vinegar, and meat processing. Located in the northern part of the town is Bagabag Airport, the only airport of Nueva Vizcaya, which serves the province and its surrounding area.\n\nBagabag is north of its provincial capital, Bayombong, and north of its country capital, Manila. It is located in the northeastern part of Nueva Vizcaya with a total land area of 260 square kilometers or 26,000 hectares. The Magat River, which runs parallel to the Pan-Philippine Highway (AH 26), is situated in the eastern part of the town proper.\n\n\nThe town was formed on October 7, 1741 during the Spanish regime by a Dominican friar, Padre (Pe.) Antonio del Campo, at sitio \"Nagcumventuan\" a place now located between Pogonsino, Bagabag, Nueva Vizcaya and Bangar, Solano, Nueva Vizcaya. The present name of the sitio bears proof to the fact that the Spanish priest constructed a church in the original town site.\n\nPe. Luis Sierra and Pe. Alejandro Vidal, who was the Vicar Provincial, were among the first priests to settle in 1743. They organized the town in 1754. Due to the continuous erosion and flood from the Magat River and its increasing population, Pe. Vidal later transferred the town site to \"Nassa\" which is located between Barangays Lantap and Santa Lucia. The \"Nassa\" location was open and muddy throughout the year. Thus for the third time, Pe. Vidal transferred the town site to its present site where numerous buri palms were then growing. It was from this buri palm plant the name of Bagabag originated, the same being called by the natives as \"bagbag\". No account could be given on the exact date of the year, the present town of Bagabag was founded as the records were destroyed during World War II. The town celebrates its feast day every September 30 in honor of the town's patron, Saint Jerome.\n\nIn 1945, the combined United States and the Philippine Commonwealth troops together with the town's guerrillas attacked the Japanese Imperial forces in the Battle of Bagabag during World War II.\n\nThe natives of Bagabag are the Ga'dangs or Gaddangs whose ancestors originally came from the Cagayan and Isabela regions. The Gaddangs predominantly live in the town proper and they speak the Gaddang language. Many Ilocanos and Tagalogs have migrated and live in Bagabag.\n\nOn January 11, 2008, the Cagayan Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) stated that tilapia fish production grew and Cagayan Valley is now the Philippines' tilapia capital. Production supply grew 37.25% since 2003, with 14,000 metric tons (MT) in 2007. The recent aquaculture congress found that the growth of tilapia production was due to government interventions: provision of fast-growing species, accreditation of private hatcheries to ensure supply of quality fingerlings, establishment of demonstration farms, providing free fingerlings to newly constructed fishponds, and the dissemination of tilapia to Nueva Vizcaya (in Diadi town). Former cycling champion Lupo Alava is a multi-awarded tilapia raiser in Bagabag. Chairman Thompson Lantion of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board, a retired two-star police general, has fishponds in La Torre, Bayombong. Also, Nueva Vizcaya Gov. Luisa Lloren Cuaresma also entered into similar aquaculture endeavors in addition to tilapia production.\n\nBagabag is governed by a mayor, a vice mayor and eight-member municipal councilors.

Although he \"laid aside the cowl of St. Anthony, and assumed the crown and title of sovereignty,\" Gobat notes that \"the first was much more becoming his character, and far more suitable to the energies of his mind.\" At the time Gobat met Gigar, the Emperor was said to be 86 years old, although Gobat thought that Gigar \"did not appear to be more than sixty-five or seventy.\"\n\nGigar was largely a figurehead, made Emperor by Ras Marye of Begemder and chief of the Oromo. He was deposed by Haile Maryam in April 1826, who set Baeda Maryam III on the throne, but after a few days Ras Marye restored Gigar.\n\nGigar dwelled in a \"small circular house, built by Joas, on the ruins of part of the palace,\" Gobat tells us. The emperor then gave Gobat a tour of the palace, which the missionary describes:\nIt must have been once a fine edifice, and although now in ruins, it is far superior to anything I had expected to see in Abyssinia. Three chambers or halls, and several smaller rooms, still remain in a tolerable state of preservation, though they have lain so long unoccupied that they present a very disagreeable appearance, being covered with dust and other impurities. The king occupies but a single room. This is decently furnished for this country, and divided by white curtains. After I had completed my examination of the mansion, he asked me if I had ever seen so superb an edifice. \"Yes,\" said I, \"I think I may have seen some in my own country that might bear a comparison with it.\" \"What!\" he exclaimed with surprise, \"are there indeed men at the present day who are capable of executing such magnificent works?\"\n\nGobat noted several signs of Gigar's ineffectual status, most notably his poverty: \"he lives upon the contributions of the grandees of his dominions, who furnish him with whatever their generosity prompts them to bestow.\" Gobat had made a present of printed copies of an Amharic translation of the Gospels and Acts, which Emperor Gigar returned a few days later, explaining that \"he had already had a considerable number of books, and would consequently much prefer that I should give him something that might be more serviceable to him -- a little cloth, a piece of silk, or some other piece of merchandise.\"\n\nAfter Marye was killed in battle against Sabagadis of Tigray in the Battle of Debre Abbay (14 February 1831), his successor and brother, Ras Dori, deposed Gigar. Gobat records in his journal that Gigar intrigued against his successor: \"by false testimony\" he accused Iyasu IV of inviting Ras Ali's rival, Aligas Faris, to depose the \"Enderase\". \"It is now said\" Gobat wrote on 26 November 1832, \"that the old king, Guigar, has procured his death by poison.\"\n"}

Educated at Weymouth College (leaving at 16), he became a Catholic convert in 1931. As a young man he was involved with H. D. C. Pepler in craft printing, before testing his vocation first of all with the Dominicans, whom he left shortly before joining the Royal Air Force during World War Two. Returning after the war to religious life, he was professed first of all with the Austin Canons before becoming a Carmelite friar in 1952 (and being ordained priest in 1954), remaining with the Carmelites for the rest of his life.\n\nIn a subsequent career as editor, publisher, printer and writer, he commemorated and wrote up a number of lesser literary lights: Arthur Machen, Frederick Rolfe, Montague Summers, Marc-André Raffalovich, John Gray, Olive Custance, Henry Williamson. He also wrote on distributist figures and the Eric Gill and Ditchling circle. Using the Aylesford Review – the magazine of the monastery in which he was cloistered – he also publicised the works of some of the 1960s counterculture poets, in particular Michael Horovitz and his erstwhile wife Frances Horovitz who with others made many trips to Aylesford Priory during the 1960s and 1970s. Sewell, who enjoyed a close friendship with Frances Horovitz, became her confessor and confidant (the fact that she was not Roman Catholic did not prevent Sewell hearing her confession) and following her death of cancer in 1983, he became her biographer.\n\nAs noted by Oswald Mosley biographer Stephen Dorril, Sewell was himself a member of the Distributist League and the British Union of Fascists, and also befriended both Henry Williamson and Mosley himself. Later, during the 1960s, he engaged in a high-profile controversy, speaking out against the Catholic Church's teachings on contraception, but seems in many other ways to have been critical of the modernising of the Roman Catholic Church following Vatican II particularly with regard to the use of the vernacular in the Mass. Yet in other ways Sewell seems to have been curiously non-condemnatory in his evaluations of people and could also be extremely detached in assessing the contributions of those of other points of view or lifestyle, not least the Communist Harry Pollitt, whose oratory he praised, and Christine Keeler, with whom he struck up a friendship. Sewell notably criticised the treatment of Stephen Ward by the authorities during the Profumo affair of 1963, and was an opponent of nuclear weapons, finding himself, in his words, \"at odds with a red hat\" on account of his membership of the radical Catholic peace movement PAX.After Mosley's death in December 1980, Sewell contributed articles to his former secretary and Catholic convert Jeffrey Hamm's magazine \"Lodestar.\n\nFollowing his pronouncements on contraception, in a letter to The Times that suggested Pope Paul VI should resign, Sewell was removed from Aylesford Priory, and lectured at St Francis Xavier's College, Antigonish in Canada for several years, having first of all spent a year in partial seclusion at the erstwhile monastery of Joseph Leycester Lyne at Capel-y-Ffin in South Wales. At this point, the monastery was the private residence of Helen Davies, granddaughter of both Hilary Pepler and of Eric Gill, but by Sewell's own admission, he went there because he had been informed he was no longer \"persona grata\" in the diocese in which he had worked, even if the suspension of his faculties to preach and hear confessions was quickly rescinded as uncanonical. He was ultimately permitted to return to Aylesford, with which monastery he is most associated.\n\nBrocard Sewell died in 2000.\n\n"}

He participated International Mathematical Olympiad in 1973 and took bronze medal. He earned PhD in economic sciences from the Kiev State University, former USSR in the 1970s.\n\nFrom 1978 to 1988 he worked as an economist, researcher and deputy head of a department at the Foreign Ministry of Mongolia. From 1988 to 1990 he worked as a specialist at the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade and in the meantime, he was a director of a market research institute.\n\nFrom 1990 to 1992 he held a seat in the State Small Khural (parliament) for the first time, representing the Mongolian Democratic Party and chaired a standing committee in the parliament. From 1992 to 1993 he held a seat in the State Great Khural (parliament) representing the Mongolian Democratic Party. He was appointed as a president of the Academy for Political Education in 1992.\n\nAfter that he served as the chairman of the common elections commission of Mongolian National Democratic Party and Mongolian Social Democratic Party for the presidential elections of June 6, 1993. From 1993 to 1996 he worked as the chairman of the Presidential office for Punsalmaagiin Ochirbat, first official president of Mongolia. \n\nEnkhsaikhan became Prime Minister of Mongolia on July 7, 1996 after the Mongolian Democratic Union Coalition won at the parliamentary elections. Enkhsaikhan was the elections campaign manager of Mongolian Democratic Union while Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj was the coalition chairman.\n\nThis made Enkhsaikhan the first prime minister since the 1920s who wasn't a member of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP). He presided over a period of aggressive economic reforms, including housing privatization, acceleration of other privatization programs, liberalization of most remaining controlled prices, closure of insolvent banks and elimination of duties on imports. Mongolian relations with international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, which had been strained due to slow reforms under the previous regime, strengthened. However, his tenure was cut short when the parliamentary majority of Democratic Party (DP) and Mongolian Social Democratic Party forced him to resign in April 1998, because of tensions between him and other leaders in the Coalition as well as by the rule of the Coalition, the chairman of the winning party should have become the Prime Minister. He was then replaced by Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj (DP).\n\nFrom 1998 to 2003, Enkhsaikhan was the director of the company \"Premier International Co.\".\nIn January 2003, the Mongolian National Democratic Party elected him party chairman, but he was removed from this position in 2005.\n\nWhen Enkhsaikhan worked as a chairman of Mongolian Democratic Party he moved to form a coalition with Motherland Party. The coalition with the Motherland Party was a failure in the parliamentary elections in 2004. Three of the Democratic Party members were elected to the parliament as individuals because they were not offered slots in the coalition candidates. He became a member of the parliament in 2004 for the Democratic Party. The coalition and its opponent, the MPRP split votes.\n\nThe coalition government was established with agreements of all the parties involved. The Motherland Party was given two seats at the Government Cabinet of the grand coalition government for its 7 elected MPs vs. Democratic Party's 25 elected MPs and Civil Will Party's MPs. However, Badarchiin Erdenebat, Enkhsaikhan's elevated ally wanted Prime Ministership and one more seat at the Government Cabinet. When it was not agreed by all participating parties of the Motherland Democracy Coalition, Badarchiin Erdenebat announced the dissolution of the coalition at the parliament without consent of the coalition parties. According to Mongolian law, if someone announces anything at the parliament, it becomes valid without need of vote for this case. Mendsaikhan Enkhsaikhan joined Badarchiin Erdenebat to dissolve Motherland Democracy Coalition to join MPRP to establish new coalition with MPRP for bigger position at the government.\n\nIn 2005 Enkhsaikhan ran in the presidential elections for the Democratic Party but received less than 20% of the votes and lost against Nambaryn Enkhbayar (MPRP).\n\nIn January 2006 he voted with MPRP members for the dismissal of Elbegdorj's government. He did so in spite of a decision of the Democratic Party's Directing Board not to vote against its own coalition government. The Party's Main Legal Committee therefore canceled Enkhsaikhan's membership in February.\n\nIn the new government under Miyeegombyn Enkhbold he was appointed for the role of a Deputy Prime Minister. Together with few former DP members such as Sonompil Mishigjav, former Member of Parliament and Minister of Defense from Democratic Party, he later registered National New Party which competed in 2008 Parliamentary elections and 2009 by-elections and did not win any seat at the Parliament of Mongolia.\n\nEnkhsaikhan himself was a candidate for a member of Parliament from National New Party and was defeated in the 2008 Parliamentary elections.\n"}

He soon moves into one of the bedrooms, and one night he attempts to commit suicide by slitting his wrists while lying on the bed.\n\nMeanwhile, Ah-jung (Chen Chao-jung) is drinking coffee at a cafe when a beautiful real estate agent, May Lin (Yang Kuei-mei), sits at the table next to his. Intrigued, he follows her as she walks down the street. Lin catches on and eventually joins him. She leads him to a vacant apartment that she is trying to sell — the same apartment that Hsiao-kang is staying in — and they have sex in one of the bedrooms. Hsiao-kang hears them and stops the bleeding from his wrists.\n\nAh-jung steals the key to the apartment from Lin and later returns with his belongings. He moves into one of the adjoining bedrooms. That night, he and Hsiao-kang encounter each other in the apartment and have a short argument.\n\nMay Lin spends her day trying to sell property. While taking a break, she returns to the apartment when Hsiao-kang and Ah-jung are both there. The two sneak out quietly together and soon form a friendship.\n\nOne night, Hsiao-kang goes out for a walk and meets Ah-jung selling dresses on the street. May Lin walks past but does not notice them. Soon, Ah-jung joins her at a food stand and the two return to the apartment and sleep together in the same room as they did the first time. Unbeknownst to them, Hsiao-kang is hiding under the bed as they arrive, and he masturbates as the bed creaks above him.\n\nThe next morning, May Lin gets dressed and leaves. Hsiao-kang lies next to the sleeping Ah-jung and kisses him before slowly pulling away. Lin goes to her car but cannot start it, and instead walks on a path in the unfinished Daan Forest Park.

It also won the Golden Lion award at the 51st Venice International Film Festival.\n\nOn AllMovie, reviewer Jonathan Crow praised the film, writing that \"[director Tsai Ming-liang] presents Taipei as a soulless, ultra-modern labyrinth where individuals cannot communicate other than in one-night stands or business transactions. The film's style is masterful in both economy and emotional power. With very long takes, little narrative tension, and almost no dialogue, the style reinforces the cold, alienating world in which the characters live.\"\n\nThe film has an 83% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. It also received two critics' votes and three directors' votes in the 2012 \"Sight & Sound\" polls.\n\n"}

The National Transport Authority has defined the Greater Dublin Area as including the counties of Dublin (Dublin City, South Dublin, Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown and Fingal), Meath, Kildare, and Wicklow. However, this area does not comprise a formal political unit. The term can also apply more narrowly to the Dublin urban area and nearby suburban towns.\n\nThe urban part of Dublin and surrounding areas has been defined by various statutory instruments, mainly those referring to the Garda Síochána and Courts of the Republic of Ireland. However, since 2009, the Garda Division of the Dublin Metropolitan Area no longer overlaps, if it ever did, with the Greater Dublin Area; it is instead co-extensive with the Dublin Region.\n\nThe city and five counties were mentioned in the order creating the Dublin Transportation Office, giving functions and representations to the office in the Greater Dublin Area, although not using the term. The office was purely advisory and had no executive powers. The term was also defined in section 3 of the Dublin Transportation Authority Bill, 2008. This bill was never enacted. On 1 December 2009 the DTO was dissolved so this term, if it ever had legal significance, ceased to have relevance as far as the DTO is concerned.\n\nThe Garda used the term the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) which was formerly the jurisdiction, within the eastern part of Ireland, of the Dublin Metropolitan Police, which was subsequently merged into An Garda Síochána, the national police force of Ireland. This jurisdiction covered parts of the old County Dublin (except the northern part around Swords) as well as the County Kildare town of Leixlip and the County Wicklow towns of Bray, Greystones and Enniskerry. Swords was covered by the Meath Garda Division. In this way, it differed from the usual definition of County Dublin and did not even conform to the looser definition of the Greater Dublin Area. The definition no longer applies as during 2008 the Garda Divisions were realigned along Regional and county boundaries. As of 2009, the Dublin Metropolitan Region is co-extensive with the Dublin Region.\n\nLeixlip was moved to the County Kildare Division and became the district headquarters for the new Leixlip District . Bray moved into the new County Wicklow Division and became district headquarters for the Bray District .\n\nThe term originated from the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925 (Section 3); that act amalgamated the Dublin Metropolitan Police and Garda Síochána as one national police force.\n\nThe 2003 Regional Planning Guidelines referred to the Greater Dublin Area as a planning district separated into a \"metropolitan area\" and a \"hinterland area\".\n\nThe \"metropolitan area\" included both suburbs and commuter towns, covering the area from Swords and Malahide in Fingal, to Greystones in County Wicklow in the south, and as far west as Kilcock in County Kildare. This area differs from the Garda \"metropolitan region\" scope, in that it stretches approximately 20 km further west.\n\nThe \"hinterland area\" of the Greater Dublin Area was defined in the Regional Planning Guidelines as including a \"range of towns of various sizes together with extensive areas of countryside\".\n\nThe population of the Dublin City, suburbs (Dublin City, Fingal, South Dublin & Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown) and Outer Greater Dublin (Meath, Kildare and Wicklow) as of Census 2016 was 1,904,806 persons. This equates to 40.03% of Ireland's population. Estimates published by the Central Statistics Office suggest that the population will reach 2.1 million by 2021, and 2.4 million by 2026. The figures are based on a regional breakdown of previously published national population projections and assume that current demographic trends will continue.\n\nThe CSO also uses the narrower definition which comprises Dublin City and its suburbs within the 3 local Dublin authorities.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1940140", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1940140", "title": "Total organic carbon", "text": "Total organic carbon\n\nTotal organic carbon (TOC) is the amount of carbon found in an organic compound and is often used as a non-specific indicator of water quality or cleanliness of pharmaceutical manufacturing equipment. TOC may also refer to the amount of organic carbon in soil, or in a geological formation, particularly the source rock for a petroleum play; 2% is a rough minimum. For marine surface sediments average TOC content is 0.5% in the deep ocean, and 2% along the eastern margins.\n\nA typical analysis for total carbon (TC) measures both the total organic carbon (TOC) present and the complementing total inorganic carbon (TIC), the latter representing the amount of non-organic carbon, like carbon in carbonate minerals. Subtracting the inorganic carbon from the total carbon yields TOC. Another common variant of TOC analysis involves removing the TIC portion first and then measuring the leftover carbon. This method involves purging an acidified sample with carbon-free air or nitrogen prior to measurement, and so is more accurately called non-purgeable organic carbon (NPOC).\n\nSince the early 1970s, TOC has been an analytic technique used to measure water quality during the drinking water purification process. TOC in source waters comes from decaying natural organic matter (NOM) as well as synthetic sources. Humic acid, fulvic acid, amines, and urea are examples of NOM. Some detergents, pesticides, fertilizers, herbicides, industrial chemicals, and chlorinated organics are examples of synthetic sources. Before source water is treated for disinfection, TOC provides an estimate of the amount of NOM in the water source. In water treatment facilities, source water is subject to reaction with chloride containing disinfectants. When the raw water is chlorinated, active chlorine compounds (Cl, HOCl, ClO) react with NOM to produce chlorinated disinfection byproducts (DBPs). Researchers have determined that higher levels of NOM in source water during the disinfection process will increase the amount of carcinogens in the processed drinking water.\n\nWith passage of the U.S. Safe Drinking Water Act in 2001, TOC analysis emerged as a quick and accurate alternative to the classical but more lengthy biological oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) tests traditionally reserved for assessing the pollution potential of wastewaters. Today, environmental agencies regulate the trace limits of DBPs in drinking water. Recently published analytical methods, such as United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) method 415.3, support the Agency's \"Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproducts Rules,\" which regulate the amount of NOM to prevent the formation of DBPs in finished waters.\n\nThe content of TOC is also an important parameter to evaluate the quality of organic shale resources which are one of the most important unconventional fuels. Numerous evaluation methods have been introduced, including these based on wireline logs and in situ techniques.\n\nIntroduction of organic matter into water systems occurs not only from living organisms and from decaying matter in source water, but also from purification and distribution system materials. A relationship may exist between endotoxins, microbial growth, and the development of biofilms on pipeline walls and biofilm growth within pharmaceutical distribution systems. A correlation is believed to exist between TOC concentrations and the levels of endotoxins and microbes. Sustaining low TOC levels helps to control levels of endotoxins and microbes and thereby the development of biofilm growth. The United States Pharmacopoeia (USP), European Pharmacopoeia (EP) and Japanese Pharmacopoeia (JP) recognize TOC as a required test for purified water and water for injection (WFI). For this reason, TOC has found acceptance as a process control attribute in the biotechnology industry to monitor the performance of unit operations comprising purification and distribution systems. As many of these biotechnology operations include the preparation of medicines, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) enacts numerous regulations to protect the health of the public and ensure the product quality is maintained. To make sure there is no cross-contamination between product runs of different drugs, various cleaning procedures are performed. TOC concentration levels are used to track the success of these cleaning validation procedures especially\n\nA variety of different terms are used to identify the different types of carbon present at different levels of detail.\n\nSince all TOC analyzers only actually measure total carbon, TOC analysis always requires some accounting for the inorganic carbon that is always present. One analysis technique involves a two-stage process commonly referred to as TC-IC. It measures the amount of inorganic carbon (IC) evolved from an acidified aliquot of a sample and also the amount of total carbon (TC) present in the sample. TOC is calculated by subtraction of the IC value from the TC the sample. Another variant employs acidification of the sample to evolve carbon dioxide and measuring it as inorganic carbon (IC), then oxidizing and measuring the remaining non-purgeable organic carbon (NPOC). This is called TIC-NPOC analysis. A more common method directly measures TOC in the sample by again acidifying the sample to a pH value of two or less to release the IC gas but in this case to the air not for measurement. The remaining non-purgeable CO gas (NPOC) contained in the liquid aliquot is then oxidized releasing the gases. These gases are then sent to the detector for measurement.\n\nWhether the analysis of TOC is by TC-IC or NPOC methods, it may be broken into three main stages:\n\nThe first stage is acidification of the sample for the removal of the IC and POC gases. The release of these gases to the detector for measurement or to the air is dependent upon which type of analysis is of interest, the former for TC-IC and the latter for TOC (NPOC).\n\nAddition of acid and inert-gas sparging allows all bicarbonate and carbonate ions to be converted to carbon dioxide, and this IC product vented along with any POC that was present.\n\nThe second stage is the oxidation of the carbon in the remaining sample in the form of carbon dioxide (CO) and other gases. Modern TOC analyzers perform this oxidation step by several processes:\n\nPrepared samples are combusted at 1,200 °C in an oxygen-rich atmosphere. All carbon present converts to carbon dioxide, flows through scrubber tubes to remove interferences such as chlorine gas, and water vapor, and the carbon dioxide is measured either by absorption into a strong base then weighed, or using an Infrared Detector. Most modern analyzers use non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) for detection of the carbon dioxide. Compared to the conventional high temperature catalytic oxidation, the great benefit of the combustion-method is the high oxidation power, so that oxidation-promoting catalysts are superfluous.\n\nA manual or automated process injects the sample onto a platinum catalyst at 680 °C in an oxygen rich atmosphere. The concentration of carbon dioxide generated is measured with a non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) detector.\n\nOxidation of the sample is complete after injection into the furnace, turning oxidizable material in the sample into gaseous form. A carbon-free carrier gas transports the CO, through a moisture trap and halide scrubbers to remove water vapor and halides from the gas stream before it reaches the detector. These substances can interfere with the detection of the CO gas. The HTCO method may be useful in those applications where difficult to oxidize compounds, or high molecular weight organics, are present as it provides almost complete oxidation of organics including solids and particulates small enough to be injected into the furnace. The major drawback of HTCO analysis is its unstable baseline resulting from the gradual accumulation of non-volatile residues within the combustion tube. These residues continuously change TOC background levels requiring continuous background correction. Because aqueous samples are injected directly into a very hot, usually quartz, furnace only small aliquots (less than 2 milliliters and usually less than 400 micro-liters) of sample can be handled making the methods less sensitive than chemical oxidation methods capable of digesting as much as 10 times more sample. Also, the salt content of the samples do not combust, and so therefore, gradually build a residue inside the combustion tube eventually clogging the catalyst resulting in poor peak shapes, and degraded accuracy or precision, unless appropriate maintenance procedures are followed. The catalyst should be regenerated or replaced as needed. To avoid this problem the manufacturing industry has developed several concepts, such as matrix separation, ceramic reactors, better process control or methods without catalysts.\n\nIn this oxidation scheme, ultra-violet light alone oxidizes the carbon within the sample to produce CO. The UV oxidation method offers the most reliable, low maintenance method of analyzing TOC in ultra-pure waters.\n\nLike the photo-oxidation method, UV light is the oxidizer but the oxidation power of the reaction is magnified by the addition of a chemical oxidizer, which is usually a persulfate compound. The mechanisms of the reactions are as follows:\n\nFree radical oxidants formed:\n\nformula_1\n\nformula_2\n\nformula_3\n\nExcitation of organics:\n\nformula_4\n\nOxidation of organics:\n\nformula_5\n\nThe UV–chemical oxidation method offers a relatively low maintenance, high sensitivity method for a wide range of applications. However, there are oxidation limitations of this method. Limitations include the inaccuracies associated with the addition of any foreign substance into the analyte and samples with high amounts of particulates. Performing \"System Blank\" analysis, which is to analyze then subtract the amount of carbon contributed by the chemical additive, inaccuracies are lowered. However, analyses of levels below 200 ppb TOC are still difficult.\n\nAlso known as heated persulfate, the method utilizes the same free radical formation as UV persulfate oxidation except uses heat to magnify the oxidizing power of persulfate. Chemical oxidation of carbon with a strong oxidizer, such as persulfate, is highly efficient, and unlike UV, is not susceptible to lower recoveries caused by turbidity in samples. The analysis of system blanks, necessary in all chemical procedures, is especially necessary with heated persulfate TOC methods because the method is so sensitive that reagents cannot be prepared with carbon contents low enough to not be detected. Persulfate methods are used in the analysis of wastewater, drinking water, and pharmaceutical waters. When used in conjunction with sensitive NDIR detectors heated persulfate TOC instruments readily measure TOC at single digit parts per billion (ppb) up to hundreds of parts per million (ppm) depending on sample volumes.\n\nAccurate detection and quantification are the most vital components of the TOC analysis process. Conductivity and non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) are the two common detection methods used in modern TOC analyzers.\n\nThere are two types of conductivity detectors, direct and membrane.\nDirect conductivity provides an all-encompassing approach of measuring CO. This detection method uses no carrier gas, is good at the parts per billion (ppb) ranges, but has a very limited analytical range.\nMembrane conductivity relies upon the filtering of the CO prior to measuring it with a conductivity cell. Both methods analyze sample conductivity before and after oxidization, attributing this differential measurement to the TOC of the sample. During the sample oxidization phase, CO (directly related to the TOC in the sample) and other gases are formed. The dissolved CO forms a weak acid, thereby changing the conductivity of the original sample proportionately to the TOC in the sample. Conductivity analyses assume that only CO is present within the solution. As long as this holds true, then the TOC calculation by this differential measurement is valid. However, depending on the chemical species present in the sample and their individual products of oxidation, they may present either a positive or a negative interference to the actual TOC value, resulting in analytical error. Some of the interfering chemical species include Cl, HCO, SO, SO, ClO, and H. Small changes in pH and temperature fluctuations also contribute to inaccuracy.\nMembrane conductivity analyzers have improved upon the direct conductivity approach by incorporating the use of hydrophobic gas permeation membranes to allow a more “selective” passage of the dissolved CO gas and nothing else. This provides a more precise and accurate measurement of the organics that were converted to CO.\n\nThe non-dispersive infrared analysis (NDIR) method offers the only practical interference-free method for detecting CO in TOC analysis. The principal advantage of using NDIR is that it directly and specifically measures the CO generated by oxidation of the organic carbon in the oxidation reactor, rather than relying on a measurement of a secondary, corrected effect, such as used in conductivity measurements.\n\nA traditional NDIR detector relies upon flow-through-cell technology, where the oxidation product flows into and out of the detector continuously. A region of absorption of infrared light specific to CO, usually around 4.26 µm (2350 cm), is measured over time as the gas flows through the detector. A second reference measurement that is non-specific to CO is also taken and the differential result correlates to the CO concentration in the detector at that moment. As the gas continues to flow into and out of the detector cell the sum of the measurements results in a peak that is integrated and correlated to the total CO concentration in the sample aliquot.\n\nA new advance of NDIR technology is Static Pressurized Concentration (SPC). The exit valve of the NDIR is closed to allow the detector to become pressurized. Once the gases in the detector have reached equilibrium, the concentration of the CO is analyzed. This pressurization of the sample gas stream in the NDIR, a patented technique, allows for increased sensitivity and precision by measuring the entirety of the oxidation products of the sample in one reading, compared to flow-through cell technology. The output signal is proportional to the concentration of CO in the carrier gas, from the oxidation of the sample aliquot. UV/ Persulfate oxidation combined with NDIR detection provides good oxidation of organics, low instrument maintenance, good precision at ppb levels, relatively fast sample analysis time and easily accommodates multiple applications, including purified water (PW), water for injection (WFI), CIP, drinking water and ultra-pure water analyses.\n\nVirtually all TOC analyzers measure the CO formed when organic carbon is oxidized and/or when inorganic carbon is acidified. Oxidation is performed either through Pt-catalyzed combustion, by heated persulfate, or with a UV/persulfate reactor. Once the CO is formed, it is measured by a detector: either a conductivity cell (if the CO is aqueous) or a non-dispersive infrared cell (after purging the aqueous CO into the gaseous phase). Conductivity detection is only desirable in the lower TOC ranges in deionized waters, whereas NDIR detection excels in all TOC ranges. A variation described as Membrane Conductometric Detection can allow for measurement of TOC across a wide analytical range in both deionized and non-deionized water samples. Modern high-performance TOC instruments are capable of detecting carbon concentrations well below 1 µg/L (1 part per billion or ppb).\n\nA total organic carbon analyzer determines the amount of carbon in a water sample. By acidifying the sample and flushing with nitrogen or helium the sample removes inorganic carbon, leaving only organic carbon sources for measurement. There are two types of analyzers. One uses combustion and the other chemical oxidation. This is used as a water purity test, as the presence of bacteria introduces organic carbon.\n\nA non-profit research and testing organization, the Instrumentation Testing Association (ITA) can provide results of field testing online TOC analyzers in an industrial wastewater application. Gulf Coast Waste Disposal Authority (GCWDA), Bayport Industrial Wastewater Treatment Plant in Pasadena, Texas sponsored and conducted this test in 2011. The GCWDA Bayport facility treats approximately 30 mgd of industrial waste received from approximately 65 customers (primarily petrochemical). Field tests consisted of operating online TOC analyzers at the influent of the Bayport facility in which TOC concentrations can range from 490 to 1020 mg/L with an average of 870 mg/L. GCWDA conducts approximately 102 TOC analyses in their laboratory per day at their Bayport treatment facility and use TOC measurements for process control and billing purposes. GCWDA plans to use online TOC analyzers for process control, detecting influent slug loads from industries and to potentially use online TOC analyzers to detect and monitor volatiles of the incoming stream. Field tests were conducted for a period of 90-days and used laboratory conformance measurements once per day to compare with analyzer output to demonstrate the instrument's overall accuracy when subjected to many simultaneously changing parameters as experienced in real-time monitoring conditions. Field test results can provide information regarding instrument design, operation and maintenance requirements which influence the performance of the instruments in field applications. The field test report includes evaluations of online TOC analyzers utilizing the following technologies: High Temperature Combustion (HTC), High Temperature Catalytic/Combustion Oxidation (HTCO), Supercritical Water Oxidation (SCWO), and Two-Stage Advanced Oxidation (TSAO).\n\nIn a combustion analyzer, half of the sample is injected into a chamber where it is acidified, usually with phosphoric acid, to turn all of the inorganic carbon into carbon dioxide as per the following reaction:\n\nThis is then sent to a detector for measurement. The other half of the sample is injected into a combustion chamber which is raised to between 600–700 °C, some even up to 1200 °C. Here, all the carbon reacts with oxygen, forming carbon dioxide. It's then flushed into a cooling chamber, and finally into the detector. Usually, the detector used is a non-dispersive infrared spectrophotometer. By finding the total inorganic carbon and subtracting it from the total carbon content, the amount of organic carbon is determined.\n\nChemical oxidation analyzers inject the sample into a chamber with phosphoric acid followed by persulfate. The analysis is separated into two steps. One removes inorganic carbon by acidification and purging. After removal of inorganic carbon persulfate is added and the sample is either heated or bombarded with UV light from a mercury vapor lamp. Free radicals form persulfate and react with any carbon available to form carbon dioxide. The carbon from both determination (steps) is either run through membranes which measure the conductivity changes that result from the presence of varying amounts of carbon dioxide, or purged into and detected by a sensitive NDIR detector. Same as the combustion analyzer, the total carbon formed minus the inorganic carbon gives a good estimate of the total organic carbon in the sample.\nThis method is often used in online applications because of its low maintenance requirements.\n\nTOC is the first chemical analysis to be carried out on potential petroleum source rock in oil exploration. It is very important in detecting contaminants in drinking water, cooling water, water used in semiconductor manufacturing, and water for pharmaceutical use. Analysis may be made either as an online continuous measurement or a lab-based measurement.\n\nTOC detection is an important measurement because of the effects it may have on the environment, human health, and manufacturing processes. TOC is a highly sensitive, non-specific measurement of all organics present in a sample. It, therefore, can be used to regulate the organic chemical discharge to the environment in a manufacturing plant. In addition, low TOC can confirm the absence of potentially harmful organic chemicals in water used to manufacture pharmaceutical products. TOC is also of interest in the field of potable water purification due to byproducts of disinfection. Inorganic carbon poses little to no threat.\n"}

Karr's story was in turn based in the Central European legend of the Vila, also used in the ballet \"Giselle\". The opera, in its original one-act version, was first performed at the Teatro Dal Verme, Milan, on 31 May 1884.\n\"Le Villi\" is Puccini's first stage work. It was written for an 1883 competition of one-act operas by the publisher Sonzogno in his periodical \"Il teatro illustrato\", but did not even earn an honourable mention. According to Mosco Carner, this may have been because it was written in such haste that the score was all but illegible. His supporters, who included Arrigo Boito, funded the first production, whose favorable reception led to publication by Giulio Ricordi. Puccini's mother received the following telegram on the night of premiere at the Teatro dal Verme on 31 May 1884: \"Theatre packed, immense success; anticipations exceeded; eighteen calls; finale of first act encored thrice\"'. Ricordi urged the composer to expand the work, and Puccini did, producing a new version later that year, which was followed by modifications in 1885, and the final version in 1889. A performance typically lasts 64 minutes.\n\nIn the libretto, each part of the symphonic intermezzo between Acts 1 and 2 – \"L'Abbandono\" (The Desertion) and \"La tregenda\" (The Spectre) – is preceded by explanatory verses recounting the intervening events. Michele Girardi, citing a letter from Fontana to Puccini on 3 September 1884, has pointed out that the librettist intended for these to be read by the audience but not actually recited by a narrator. But according to Mosco Carner, Puccini had intended for the verses to be read out to the audience, although he notes there is no mention of this having actually happened in contemporary reviews of the first production. Likewise, there is no record of a narrator having been used at the first performance of \"Le Villi\" at the Metropolitan Opera in 1908. Nevertheless, a narrator is used in some modern productions of the opera, such as the September 2004 production at the Teatro Dal Verme with Leo Nucci as the narrator, and the August 1994 production at the Festival della Valle d'Itria in Martina Franca with Massimo Foschi as narrator. A narrator (Tito Gobbi) is also used in the Sony 1981 studio recording of the work.\n\nA revised, two-act version was performed in at the Teatro Regio, Turin on 26 December 1884. \"Le Villi\" was also performed at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples on 15 January 1888. However, on that occasion it was not viewed favourably by either the audience or the critics who characterized it as \"simply an imitation of Wagner\". Puccini continued to revise the work up until 1892 when it premiered in Hamburg conducted by Gustav Mahler.\n\nThe UK premiere occurred on 24 September 1897 in Manchester and the US premiere of \"Le Villi\" came on 17 December 1908 at the New York Metropolitan Opera conducted by Arturo Toscanini. Performed as a double bill with Mascagni's \"Cavalleria rusticana\", the Met's production featured Frances Alda as Anna and Alessandro Bonci as Roberto. The work did not receive its premiere at the Vienna State Opera until 23 October 2005 when it was performed in a double bill with Leoš Janáček's \"Osud\". Simone Young conducted the performance with Krassimira Stoyanova as Anna and José Cura as Roberto.\n\nThe UK Premiere of the original version and the first performance anywhere since the first performance on 31 May 1884, took place in London's Royal Festival Hall on 21 November 2018. It was given by the London Philharmonic Orchestra under Sir Mark Elder. The soloists were Ermonela Jaho, Brian Mulligan and Arsen Soghomonyan with the Opera Rara Chorus.\n\n\"Spring\"\n\nFamily and guests dance at a celebration of the engagement in marriage of Roberto and Anna. Roberto must leave before the ceremony to collect an inheritance, and Anna worries that she will never see him again (Aria: \"Se come voi piccina\"). Roberto comforts Anna telling her that it will be fine and they will marry when he returns from Mainz. Anna tells Roberto of her dreams of him dying but Roberto tells Anna that she should not worry about his love failing and that she may doubt her God but not his love for her. The crowd returns and Anna is still worried about Roberto leaving. Roberto then asks Guglielmo, Anna's father, to bless them before his journey and Roberto sets off for Mainz.\n\nRoberto is enchanted by a siren, and forgets Anna. Anna waits through the summer and the autumn and in the winter dies in his absence. The legend of the fairies (\"Le Villi\") is then explained. When a woman dies of a broken heart, the fairies force the heart breaker to dance until death.\n\n\"Winter\"\nAnna's father, Guglielmo, holds Roberto responsible for Anna's death and calls upon the Villi to take vengeance on Roberto (Aria: \"Anima santa della figlia mia\"). The Villi call upon the ghost of Anna and lure Roberto into the forest. Roberto, now penniless and abandoned by the seductress, returns when news of Anna's death reaches him. Hoping that he will be forgiven the Villi stalk Roberto as he mourns the loss of the days of his youth (Aria: \"Torna ai felici dì\"). Roberto then finds the one last flower left alive in the winter and tries to find hope that Anna lives but is repelled by the Villi when he tries to knock on the door of Guglielmo's house. Roberto then tries to pray for forgiveness but finds he cannot because of the curse put upon him by the Villi. As Roberto curses his fate Anna appears to him and tells him of the suffering that she had to endure. Roberto begs for forgiveness and he too feels the pain of Anna burning in his heart. But Roberto is not forgiven and Anna calls upon the Villi, who curse Roberto with cries of \"traitor.\" There, the Villi and Anna dance with Roberto until he dies of exhaustion at Anna's feet.\n\nNotes\n\nSources\n\n"}

He was the son of Gebre Mesay, allegedly a descendant of a younger son of Emperor Fasilides.\n\nSahle Dengel was largely a figurehead, with real power in the hands of the \"Enderase\" or Regent, Ras Ali II a member of the Oromo ruling family of the district of Yejju. Eduard Rüppell, who visited the capital of Gondar in 1833, stated that at the time the Emperor \"barely had the income of an averagely well-to-do Ethiopian, and the great princes of the Tigray, Shoa and Amhara were unable to prevent continuous strife and bloodshed.\"\n\nWhen Sahle Dengel was set on the throne by Ras Ali, the clergy of Azazo disapproved of his religious beliefs, and convinced Ras Ali to remove him; Sahle Dengel was sent to Zengaj. Ras Ali recalled Gebre Krestos from Mitraha, an island in northeastern Lake Tana, and restored him as Emperor. However, Gebre Krestos died after three months, and Sahle Dengel met Ras Ali in a village named Tagur, where he convinced the Ras to make him Emperor once again (October, 1832). About that same time, one Egwale Anbesa announced his claim to the throne; Sahle Dengel cut his head off, and set it in a tree at Adababay.\n\nFollowing the death of Ras Kinfu, people fought for control of his lands in Gojjam. Eventually Menen Liben Amede gained the upper hand in the Battle of Chenti Ber (October, 1839), defeating and capturing Kinfu's relative Walda Tekle. Not long afterwards, she deposed Sahle Dengel on 29 August 1840 in favor of her husband Yohannes III. However Yohannes offended Ras Ali by favoring his rival Wube Haile Maryam, and Ras Ali restored Sahle Dengel in October 1841. Sahle Dengel was still emperor in 1848, when Goshu Zewde entered Gondar and was invested with the title of Ras. Yohannes somehow managed to get himself restored to the throne around 1850, only to be deposed again in 1851 and Sahle Dengel was once again restored. Despite this, Yohannes III persisted with his claim; different parts of the fragmented realm recognized one or the other as Emperor until Tewodros II consolidated Ethiopia under his control and declared himself Emperor. Significantly, Yohannes III accepted the accession of Tewodros II.\n\nAlthough without power, Sahle Dengel wrote to officials outside Ethiopia using his title and seal. Existing letters include a packet of letters sent to Samuel Gobat in April 1848, who had by that time become the Anglican Bishop of Jerusalem, which ask for his help in restoring the ownership of the Dar-es-Sultan monastery to the Ethiopian community. His name also appears as one of several signatories to a letter Antoine d'Abbadie delivered to Viscount Henry Palmerston 18 May 1839, which asked that Queen Victoria ask the ruler of Egypt, Muhammad Ali, to recall his forces which were then ravaging Ethiopia and threatening Gondar.\n"}

He served as the president of the Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) political party and was an unsuccessful candidate in Uganda's 2001, 2006, 2011, and 2016 presidential elections, losing all of them to the incumbent Yoweri Museveni, who has been President of Uganda since 26 January 1986. The results of the 2006 elections were contested in court, where court found massive rigging and disenfranchisement. He allowed an early internal FDC election for a successor president, which took place on 24 November 2012. He decided that the successor president should be in place earlier than planned to allow the new president enough time to prepare the party for the next cycle of general elections.\n\nWarren Kizza Besigye Kifefe was born in Rwakabengo, Rukungiri Municipality, Rukungiri District, southwestern Uganda, on 22 April 1956. He attended Kinyasano Primary School and Mbarara Junior School. The second born in a family of 6, both his parents died before he finished primary school. His father was a policeman. He went to Kinyasano Primary School and Mbarara Junior School for his Primary school education. He later joined Kampala's Kitante High School for his Ordinary Levels and then Kigezi High School in Kabale District for his Advanced Level education.\n\nBesigye enrolled at Makerere University in 1975, graduating with a degree in human medicine in 1980. While in the bush, he became Yoweri Museveni's personal physician. When the National Resistance Movement and Army (NRM/A) came to power in January 1986, he was appointed - at the age of 29 - Minister of State for Internal Affairs. He later held the positions of Minister of State in the President's office and National Political Commissar. In 1991, he became commanding officer of the mechanised regiment in Masaka, central Uganda, and in 1993 was appointed the army's chief of logistics and engineering.\n\nOn 7 July 1999, Besigye married Winnie Byanyima, a Ugandan Member of Parliament, in Nsambya, Kampala.\n\nAfter graduating, Besigye briefly worked at Mulago National Hospital. He later went into exile in neighbouring Kenya. While there, he applied to the Medical Board for registration to work as a doctor. After getting registered, he applied for a job at the Aga Khan Hospital which he was given and then started working as a doctor and later at Kenyatta National Hospital - both in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi - before joining Museveni's rebel National Resistance Movement/Army (NRM/A) in 1982.\n\nIn 1999, Besigye wrote a document critical of the government, entitled \"An Insider's View of How the NRM Lost the Broad Base\". The document accused the NRM of becoming a sectarian kleptocracy and a one-man dictatorship. Besigye was charged before a court-martial for \"airing his views in the wrong forum\". He later brokered a deal in 2000 in which the charges were dropped in exchange for an apology for publishing the document.\n\nIn October 2000, Besigye announced that he would run against Museveni in the 2001 elections. He retired from the Uganda People's Defence Forces in 2001, having attained the rank of colonel. During his campaign, Besigye, who was Museveni's strongest opponent, accused the government of widespread corruption and pushed for an end to Museveni's \"Movement\" system, which he said had served its purpose as an instrument in Uganda's political transition to multiparty democracy.\n\nHe lost the election, which was marred by claims of widespread vote rigging, violence and coercion of voters. In March 2001 Besigye petitioned the Supreme Court to nullify the election results. A panel of five judges voted 5-0 that there had been cheating but decided 3-2 not to annul the elections.\n\nIn June 2001, Besigye was briefly arrested and questioned by the police over allegations of treason. The government accused him of being behind a shadowy rebel group - the People's Redemption Army (PRA) - allegedly based in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Besigye's supporters said the government had fabricated the existence of the insurgents to harm his credibility among Ugandans and the international community.\n\nIn August 2001, Besigye fled the country, citing persecution by the state. He said he was afraid for his life. He lived in South Africa for four years, during which time he continued to criticise Museveni's government. Besigye returned to Uganda on 26 October 2005, just in time to register as a voter in the 2006 elections. He was greeted by thousands and hit the campaign trail almost immediately, addressing throngs of supporters across the country. In November 2005, William Lacy Swing, the United Nations special envoy to the Great Lakes region, confirmed the existence of the PRA, naming it as one of the foreign, armed groups operating in the eastern DRC.\n\nBesigye's campaign came to an abrupt halt on 14 November when he was arrested on charges of treason and rape. The treason charges pertained to his alleged links to the PRA and the 20-year-old northern Ugandan Lord's Resistance Army rebellion. The rape charge related to a 1997 accusation by the daughter of a deceased friend. His arrest sparked riots in Kampala and around the country. Museveni was accused of trumping up charges against his main rival in an attempt to discredit Besigye or even prevent him from standing in the election. Both the local and international community came down heavily against Museveni's administration, urging it to release Besigye on bail. The government reacted by banning all public rallies, demonstrations, assemblies or seminars related to the trial of Besigye. It further barred the media from discussing the trial, threatening media houses with the revocation of their licences should they refuse to heed the ban.\n\nOn 25 November, Uganda's high court granted Besigye bail, but he was immediately sent back to jail on military charges of terrorism and the illegal possession of weapons. Besigye denied the charges against him and has argued that as a retiree from the armed forces, he should no longer be subject to an army court-martial. He was freed on bail by the high court on 6 January. Although the charges against him stand, Besigye continues to pursue his ambition to become the next president of Uganda.\n\nThe general elections of 2006 saw FDC as the main opposition party and Besigye as the main challenger against Museveni for the presidency. He stood with Miria Kalule Obote, the first female presidential candidate for the Uganda People's Congress (UPC), Abed Bwanika, who stood as an independent, John Ssebana Kizito for Democratic Party (DP). Museveni was elected for another five-year tenure, having won 59% of the vote against Besigye's 37%. Besigye, who alleged fraud, rejected the result. The Supreme Court of Uganda later ruled that the election was marred by intimidation, violence, voter disenfranchisement, and other irregularities. However, the Court voted 4–3 to uphold the results of the election.\n\nIn the 2011 elections Besigye for the third time in a row lost to his main challenger, the incumbent Yoweri Museveni with a sharp decline from previous polls, failing to win in a single region. Though the election was lauded as one of the most free and fair in Ugandan history, Besigye claimed that his challenger used intimidation and rigging to win a fourth term in office.\n\nFollowing his poor performance in the 2011 presidential elections, Besigye directed his party members elected to the 9th parliament to boycott it. This was rejected by the newly elected MPs, claiming that the election victory was out of their personal effort and not Besigye's or the Party, contributing to rising tensions within the FDC.\n\nBesigye was arrested for a fourth time on 28 April, during a \"walk-to-work\" protest over the high prices of food and fuel. He was sprayed with pepper spray and dragged from his car by police. This was the catalyst for additional protests leading to riots across Kampala, in which at least two people were killed and 120 people wounded, leading to some 360 arrests.\n\nBesigye opposed the re-introduction of the Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Bill into the 9th Parliament of Uganda by back bench MP David Bahati. Besigye's support of gay rights was a contentious issue in Uganda where homosexuality is already criminal under the Ugandan Penal Code (Gender References Amendment Act).\n\nBesigye was arrested on 1 October 2012 after an attempt to make a speech to vendors in Kiseka market in Kampala, Uganda. He was taken to a central police station in the city. Earlier, police had deployed heavily at Besigye's home in a move to block him from travelling to town to hold his planned rally, but he managed to elude the security officials to a then undisclosed location until his arrest by police at the city market about an hour later.\n\nIn the 2016 elections, Besigye again stood as the FDC presidential candidate, going up against other popular candidates Amama Mbabazi and Yoweri Museveni, the President of Uganda for three decades. Besigye again lost to Museveni, receiving only 34 percent of the vote, while Museveni won 62 percent.\n\nIn the aftermath of this election, he urged his supporters to protest peacefully against the results, claiming that the electoral process had been rigged \"using intimidation of voters, imprisonment of opponents, sabotage of rallies, late delivery of election materials, delayed opening of election centers, vote falsification at undisclosed tally centers, and bribery, among other malpractices.\"\n\nOn May 11, 2016 he secretly swore himself in as president of Uganda, a day before the official swearing-in ceremony of President Yoweri Museveni. He was arrested by the Ugandan Army moments into his swearing in.\n\n\n"}

The dam is one of nine dams on the main Tennessee River channel operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority, which built the dam in the early 1940s to provide flood control and electricity and to help create a continuous navigable channel along the entire length of the river. The dam is the technical boundary between the Watts Bar Lake— which it impounds— and Chickamauga Lake, which stretches from the dam's tailwaters southward to Chattanooga.\n\nWatts Bar Dam is named for Watt Island, a sandbar located at the dam site prior to the dam's construction.\n\nWatts Bar Dam is located approximately upstream from the mouth of the Tennessee River, roughly halfway between Knoxville and Chattanooga. Just north of the dam, the Tennessee absorbs the Piney River, which flows down from the Cumberland Plateau to the west. The nearest towns of note are Spring City (a few miles to the northwest) and Decatur (a few miles to the south). Tennessee State Route 68 crosses Watts Bar Dam, connecting the area with Interstate 75 to the east and U.S. Route 27 to the west.\n\nWatts Bar Lake extends northeast from the dam to Fort Loudoun Dam, and includes parts of Meigs, Rhea, Roane, and Loudon counties. In addition to its main Tennessee River channel, Watts Bar Lake is navigable across the lower of the Clinch River (up to Melton Hill Dam) and the lower of the Emory River. The cities of Kingston, Spring City, Harriman, Loudon, Rockwood, and Lenoir City all have waterfronts on Watts Bar Lake. \nWatts Bar provides of shoreline and over of water surface. Watts Bar Dam is high and stretches across the Tennessee River. Watts Bar has a storage capacity of , a flood-storage capacity of , and generates 175 megawatts of electricity. The dam's navigational lock is , and raises and lowers vessels from Watts Bar Lake to Chickamauga Lake and vice versa.\n\nWatt Island's potential as a dam site had been recognized since the early 1870s, when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built a dike at the tip of the island to improve flow in the main river channel. The Corps carried out dredging work at the island between 1911 and 1913 that deepened the main channel, and recommended the site (originally known as the \"White Creek site\" after a stream that joins the Tennessee a few miles upriver) for a dam in 1930. In 1936, the Tennessee Valley Authority assumed direction of the site as part of its unified strategy to build (and acquire) a series of dams along the Tennessee River to improve navigation and flood control, and aide in the region's economic development. TVA was given authorization to build a dam at Watt Island on March 16, 1939, and construction on Watts Bar Dam began on July 1, 1939.\n\nThe construction of Watts Bar Dam and its accompanying reservoir required the purchase of of land and flowage rights, of which were forested and had to be cleared. 832 families, 17 cemeteries, and of roads were relocated. An earthen dike was built to protect downtown Kingston from the reservoir's backwaters, and minor adjustments were necessary to the riverfronts of Spring City, Harriman, Wheat, and Loudon. The community of Rhea Springs, located along the Piney River a few miles upstream from the river's mouth, was completely inundated.\n\nThe dam's original design called for the installation of three generators, but with the outbreak of World War II in 1941, energy demand in the region skyrocketed, and the design was modified to include a fourth and fifth generator. The dam was completed and the gates closed on January 1, 1942. The first generator went online February 11 of that year, followed by the second generator on April 6 and the third on July 23. The fourth generator went online March 12, 1944 and the fifth followed on April 24, 1944. The Army Corps of Engineers designed the dam's lock, which went into operation on February 16, 1942.\n\nWatts Bar Lake was one of the water bodies affected by a massive release of fly ash in 2008 from the Kingston Fossil Plant coal fly ash slurry spill.\n\n\n"}

The king had been on a hunting trip and separated from his retinue, exhausted and thirsty. The farmer was accepted as king by the queen to prevent unrest in the kingdom and became known as the \"Cucumber King\", \"farmer king\" or \"Taungthugyi Min\".\n\nThe story is likely a fairy tale.

He was Chief Scientist of the Special Projects Office of the United States Navy.\n\nJohn Piña Craven was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1924. He held a Bachelor of Arts degree from Cornell University, a Master of Science degree from the California Institute of Technology, a Ph.D. from the University of Iowa, and a law degree from the National Law Center of the George Washington University.\n\nHe met his wife, Dorothy Drakesmith, while attending the University of Iowa.\n\nCraven had 40 years of experience in the innovation, development, design, construction and operational deployment of major oceanic systems. As a boy, John Piña Craven studied ocean technology at the Brooklyn Technical High School, and he became familiar with the ocean on the beaches of Long Island and on the waterfront of New York City.\n\nDuring World War II, Craven served as an enlisted man on the . In 1944, Craven was selected for the Navy's V-12 program for officer trainees, and from this, he earned his commission as an ensign in the Navy. After earning his Ph.D., Craven worked at the David Taylor Model Basin of the Naval Surface Warfare Center at Carderock, Maryland, working on nuclear submarine hull designs. He received two civilian service awards in connection with these developments. He was later appointed as the Project Manager for the Navy's Polaris submarine program, and also the Navy's Special Projects Office. He later became its Chief Scientist. Craven was awarded two Distinguished Civilian Service Awards (the Department of Defense's highest honor for civilians) among other commendations.\n\nWhile working for the Navy, Craven helped pioneer the use of Bayesian search techniques to locate objects lost at sea (Bayesian search theory). Craven's work was instrumental in the Navy's search for the missing hydrogen bomb that had been lost in the Mediterranean Sea, off the coast of Spain in 1966. Craven's next large accomplishment was in the search for and locating of the submarine , which had disappeared in deep water in the Atlantic Ocean west of Portugal and Spain.\n\nAs Chief Scientist of the Special Projects Office, Craven was in charge of the Deep Submergence Systems Project, which included the SEALAB program. In February 1969, when aquanaut Berry L. Cannon died while attempting to repair a leak in SEALAB III, Craven headed an advisory group that determined the best method of salvaging the SEALAB habitat.\n\nAfter leaving the Navy, Craven became the Marine Affairs Coordinator for the State of Hawaii and also the Dean of marine programs at the University of Hawaii. During his time in Hawaii, it has been alleged that Craven was involved in the development and operation of the secretive salvage ship, \"Glomar Explorer\", built to follow up on the discovery of a sunken Soviet submarine, the \"K129\", by other of Craven's projects, a nuclear-powered submarine spy ship called \"Halibut\".\n\nCraven also served during the Carter Administration on the U.S. government's Weather Modification Commission. During that time, a hypothetical method was developed to significantly reduce the impact of tropical cyclones. In 1976, after losing in his campaign to become a member of the United States House of Representatives, Craven was appointed as the Director of the Law of the Sea Institute. In 2001, he was the president of the Common Heritage Corporation.\n\nAfter having earned his law degree through degree program at night, Craven was responsible for the direction of the International Law of the Sea Institute. In 1990 he established the Common Heritage Corporation for the management of innovation for the benefit of the common heritage of mankind. Craven was a member of the National Academy of Engineering.\n\nAccording to the magazine \"Wired\", Craven's latest undertaking was to link islands in the Pacific Ocean with sustainable energy, agriculture, and fresh water through the use of Deep Ocean Water pumped up using pipes from offshore. He was developing a new and innovative cold water therapy, which may produce significant health breakthroughs and slow the aging process.\n\nCraven wrote the book, \"The Silent War: The Cold War Battle Beneath the Sea\".\n\nJohn Piña Craven's daughter, Sarah Craven, is a prominent international advocate of women's rights.\n\nJohn Piña Craven resided in Honolulu, Hawaii for many years. In 1994, he ran against long-term Honolulu mayor Frank Fasi for the nomination of the new Best Party for governor; Fasi won the nomination, but came in second in the general election.\n\nIn 1998, he received the first Distinguished Civilian Service Award by the Naval Submarine League for his work on \"Scorpion\", \"Polaris\", and other projects.\n\nCraven died in Honolulu on February 12, 2015 at the age of 90, from Parkinson's disease.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1940213", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1940213", "title": "Arthur Bryant", "text": "Arthur Bryant\n\nSir Arthur Wynne Morgan Bryant, (18 February 1899 – 22 January 1985) was an English historian, columnist for \"The Illustrated London News\" and man of affairs. His books included studies of Samuel Pepys, accounts of English eighteenth- and nineteenth-century history, and a life of George V. Whilst his scholarly reputation has declined somewhat since his death, he continues to be read and to be the subject of detailed historical studies. He moved in high government circles, where his works were influential, being the favourite historian of three prime ministers: Winston Churchill, Clement Attlee, and Harold Wilson.\n\nBryant's historiography was often based on an English romantic exceptionalism drawn from his nostalgia for an idealised agrarian past. He hated modern commercial and financial capitalism, he emphasised duty over rights, and he equated democracy with the consent of \"fools\" and \"knaves\".\n\nArthur Bryant was the son of Sir Francis Morgan Bryant, who was the chief clerk to the Prince of Wales, and wife Margaret (May) née Edmunds. His father would later hold a number of offices in the royal secretariat, eventually becoming registrar of the Royal Victorian Order. Arthur grew up in a house bordering the Buckingham Palace gardens near the Royal Mews. There he developed a feel for the trappings of traditional British protocol and a strong attachment to the history of England.\n\nHe attended school at Pelham House, Sandgate, and Harrow School where his younger brother the Rev. Philip Henry Bryant later became an assistant Master. Though he expected to join the British Army, he won in 1916 a scholarship to Pembroke College, Cambridge. Despite that, he joined the Royal Flying Corps the following year, as a pilot officer. While there, he served in the first squadron to bomb the towns of the Rhineland during World War 1. He was also for a time the only British subject formally attached to the United States' Expeditionary Force's Air Service, to one of its detachments that had arrived in England for training for frontline service.\n\nIn 1919 he read Modern History at Queen's College, Oxford, obtaining distinction in the honours courses offered to ex-servicemen in 1920.\n\nBryant started work at a school operated by the London County Council, where he developed a strong sense of social justice and became convinced that education would be an effective way of uniting the people. That conviction led him to become a historian. Tall, dark, and attractive, he was popular at the debutante balls he regularly attended, where he often persuaded his dancing partners to help him teach some of the less fortunate children at a children's library he had established in Charles Dickens's old house in Somers Town, London.\n\nHe became a barrister at the Inner Temple in 1923, but left later that year to take the headmaster position of the Cambridge School of Arts, Crafts, and Technology, becoming the youngest headmaster in England. He organised the Cambridge Pageant in 1924 and the Oxford Pageant in 1926. Altogether, he proved remarkably successful in enrolling students, the school growing from three hundred to two thousand students in his three years there. During 1926 he married Sylvia Mary Shakerley, daughter of Walter Geoffrey Shakerley, the third Baronet Shakerley, and the following year became a lecturer in history for the Oxford University delegacy for extramural studies, a position he retained until 1936. His marriage was dissolved in 1930. He also served as an advisor at the Bonar Law College at Ashridge. His first book, \"The Spirit of Conservatism\", appeared in 1929 and was written with his former students in mind.\n\nIn 1929, after cataloguing the Shakerley family library, he was asked by a friend in publishing to produce a new biography of Charles II of England. Yale Professor Frank W. Notestein suggested that he begin the work with Charles's escape following the Battle of Worcester, incorporating details of his earlier life into the narrative thereafter. This dramatic opening led the Book Society to choose it as their October 1931 selection, and it became a best-seller. Bryant's success with this volume encouraged him, and he remained in that field. The book has been described as being both readable and informed by solid scholarship. He also regularly continued to produce pageants. These included the Wisbech and Hyde Park pageants, and the Naval Night Pageant in Greenwich, which was attended by the King, Queen, Prince of Wales, British Cabinet, and members of the World Economic Conference. For the quality of his work in this field, he was acclaimed \"the English Reinhardt\".\n\nHe helped found the National Book Association, and its subsidiary, the Right Book Club, as an alternative to the Left Book Club. The new organisation was not outstandingly successful, however, although it did publish several of his own writings.\nIn January 1939 the National Book Club published a new English edition of \"Mein Kampf\", for which Bryant wrote a foreword praising Hitler (with reservations: he denounced Nazi persecution of Jews) and comparing him to Benjamin Disraeli.\n\nHis next book was a three-volume biography of Samuel Pepys, completed in 1938 and regarded as \"one of the great historical biographies in the language\" by John Kenyon. Almost three-quarters of a century after its publication it remains an important guide to Pepys's career.\n\nBryant also was a frequent contributor to London papers and magazines, and scripted radio broadcasts relating to his historical interests, as well as radio plays for the BBC. He published a collection of scripts in his book \"The National Character\". He was editor of the Ashridge Journal and president of the Ashridge Dining Club.\n\n\"Unfinished Victory\" was a book which Bryant had published in January 1940; it dealt with recent German history, and explained sympathetically how Germany had rebuilt herself after World War I. Bryant asserted that certain German Jews had benefited from the economic crises and controlled the national wealth, and although he criticised the destruction of Jewish shops and synagogues, he declared that the Third Reich might produce \"a newer and happier Germany in the future\". Initially most reviewers received the book positively, but after the 'phoney war' ended, public and elite opinion turned sharply against appeasement of any sort. Bryant realised his mistake in proposing a compromise and tried to buy up unsold copies.\n\nAfter the fall of France in 1940, Bryant's writing celebrated British patriotism. His \"English Saga\", published at the end of that year, described England as \"an island fortress … fighting a war of redemption, not only for Europe but for her own soul\". Roberts says of his popular essays and books, \"Bryant did a superb job in helping to stiffen the people's resolve by putting their sacrifices in historical context.\"\n\nHe married again, in 1941, to Anne Elaine Brooke, daughter of Bertram Willes Dayrell Brooke, one of the White Rajahs of Sarawak. His books during this decade dealt less prominently with the 17th century, and included a collection of Neville Chamberlain's speeches.\n\nHis works during this period were well-received for their style and readability, although they also tended to be less well researched, which has caused them to be questioned by younger historians. Several of these works, including \"English Saga\" (1940), \"The Years of Endurance 1793–1802\" (1942), and \"Years of Victory, 1802–1812\", drew notable criticism, particularly for his preoccupation with comparing Napoleon and Hitler. The shortcomings of these works, possibly combined with their unusual popularity, helped ensure that he never received the highest academic honours.\n\nHis single major work in the decade was a two-volume collection of Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke's diaries with additional commentary, \"The Turn of the Tide\" (1957) and \"The Triumph in the West\" (1959). These books created substantial controversy, given their criticism of Churchill, who was then at the height of his popularity. They are still considered essential reading for understanding the British military during the war.\n\nThe books he wrote during his later years included several volumes of broad English histories. They include \"Set in a Silver Sea\" (1984), \"Freedom's Own Island\" (1986, edited posthumously by John Kenyon, and a third volume.\nHe retained a large readership and was guest-of-honour at the Conservative Monday Club's 1966 annual dinner. He spoke on \"The Preservation of our National Character\". The dinner, at the Savoy Hotel, was sold out. During the 1960s Bryant was knighted and made a Companion of Honour. J. H. Plumb wrote, \"both of his public honours, his Knighthood and his C.H., were given to him by Harold Wilson, whose favourite historian he had long been.\" His second marriage dissolved in 1976. In his final years he lived in Myles Place, Salisbury, Wiltshire.\nBryant died after a brief illness at the age of 85 at Salisbury in the county of Wiltshire on 22 January 1985. His body was cremated, with its ashes being entombed in Salisbury Cathedral.\n\nBryant's total output was remarkable. He wrote over forty books overall, which collectively sold over two million copies. Most were published by William Collins, Sons and Co. Ltd. Also, in collaboration with W. P. Lipscomb, he wrote a play dramatising Pepys' life which ran for one hundred and fifty performances in London. He was a frequent lecturer, speaking at many of the leading cities and schools in Great Britain, as well as in the United States and fourteen European countries. His public speeches included the 1935 Watson Chair lectures sponsored by the Sulgrave Manor Trust. These lectures, on American history, literature, and biography, were later collected into the book \"The American Ideal\".\n\nIn 1936, Bryant took over G. K. Chesterton's \"Our Note Book\" column for the \"Illustrated London News\". (Bryant paid tribute to Chesterton in his introduction to Chesterton's posthumously-published essay collection \"The Glass Walking-Stick\".) He continued writing this column until his death, which occurred almost half a century after Chesterton's. Overall, Bryant produced about 2.7 million words for that magazine.\n\nAndrew Roberts claims that Bryant's work on Samuel Pepys gave insufficient credit to the scholarly work of Joseph Robson Tanner (1860–1931). J. H. Plumb gives this account of how G. M. Trevelyan passed Tanner's notes to Bryant:\nRoberts also claimed that Bryant remained in indirect contact with the Nazis in early 1940, after the outbreak of World War II, and that these ties had been requested by the Foreign Secretary.\n\nComparing his pre-World War II support of appeasement and admiration of Nazi Germany with his patriotic writings after the war began, Julian T. Jackson wrote that\n\nAlthough professional historians were frequently negative about his best-sellers, Bryant's histories were explicitly praised by prime ministers Stanley Baldwin, Neville Chamberlain, Churchill, Attlee, Macmillan, Wilson, James Callaghan and Margaret Thatcher.\n\nJ. H. Plumb, one of Bryant's detractors, wrote:\n\nPlumb's verdict is that Bryant killed off 'patrician history': \n\nPlumb cites Trevelyan's possible heirs as Wedgwood and A. L. Rowse.\n\nAnother detractor is the British historian Andrew Roberts, who has said \n\nRoberts's polemical essay, prompted by the opening of archive material on Bryant, has been followed (and rebutted) by Julia Stapleton's full academic study. Bryant's first biographer was Pamela Street, a neighbour of his in Salisbury, who on occasion had collaborated with Bryant in his historical works, and who was a daughter of farmer-author A. G. Street. Her book appeared during Bryant's lifetime.\n\n\n\n"}

The English translation of the team's name is \"Football Club Freedom Tuzla\".\n\nThe club is a member of the Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina and has been active in the Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina since it was founded, an exception being a two-year stint of playing in the First League of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina after the club got relegated to it in the 2011–12 Premier League season.\n\nSloboda got promoted back up to the Premier League in the 2013–14 First League of FBiH season, and has been playing in the country's top division since.\n\nFK Sloboda Tuzla was founded in October 1919, as a part of the Labour Sport Society \"Gorki\", named after the great socialist Russian poet Maxim Gorky. The football club and the labour society was popular in a wide part of the sporting public in Tuzla and beyond. The club was formed on the initiative of the Tuzla branch of the newly formed Communist party of Yugoslavia, under the influence of the ideas of the October revolution of 1917 and revolutionary movements in Yugoslavia and Bosnia and Herzegovina as its integral part.\n\nAfter the initial congress of unification and the creation of the Socialist Labour Party (Communists) in Yugoslavia that took place in Vukovar, Croatia in 1919, the first conference of the Tuzla municipal organisation of the SWPY(c) took place on 17 October 1919 in Tuzla. The elected party council decided on the same day to start with the formation of a worker's sporting society. The official founding of the club took place in the end of October 1919, and gathering was led by Jovo Sretenović, Mato Vidović, Safet Hadžiefendić, Ljubko Simić, Niko Trifković and Petar Dugonjić.\n\nThe men elected into the first Board of directors of the club were: Leonard Bancher, Mato Vidović, Niko Trifković, Stjepan Brkljačić and Alfred Puhta, Mijo Cuvaj and Ahmed Mandžić, Franto Bauzek (locksmith), Emil Kranjčec, Jakov Čurić and Petar Dugonjić, Franjo Miškovski, Safet Hadžiefendić, August Mot and Karlo Schwartz. The origin of the original name of the sporting society, \"Gorki\", was explained by Petar Dugonjić:\n\n\"When the final preparations for the organising meeting were being dealt with, it was suggested that the club be named \"Sokolović\", after Mićo Sokolović, a known worker's rights activist. Then Mitar Trifunović noticed: \"People, few will know that we named the Club after our Mića. Most will think of Mehmed-paša Sokolović\". The practical Franjo Rezač insisted we go to the meeting with a concrete name suggestion. Mitar Trifunović then said: \"If no one objects, I would suggest the club bears the name of Maxim Gorky\". I remember it well. Afterwards the name was accepted with enthusiasm at the meeting.\"\n\nThe first headquarters of the club was in Rudarska Street in Tuzla, not far from Skver is today. Afterwards the headquarters moved to the building of the Jewish Bank, then to the Grand Hotel and then back to Rudarska Street. The games were played on two fields – the first one was called the \"Communist playground\" between what today are the Chemical and Mechanical high-schools and the second one was the field where the Braća Ribar primary schools stands.\n\nAll the players were workers, and the \"Gorki\" first team had the following players: Mirko Veseli, Peri Mot, Karlo Krejči, Santo Altarac, Ivica Šifer, Franto Bauzek, Mijo Josić, Lorenc Ajhberger, Vili Zaboš, Slavko Zafani, Ahmed Mandžić, Alfred Puhta, Jozo Vikić, Malaga Mustačević, Dragoslav Stakić and several others. The coach was Brato Gamberger, former player of HŠK Zrinjski.\n\nThe club mostly played against other Tuzla football clubs. Namely, at the time of the formation of FK Gorki there were three other football clubs in Tuzla, \"Zrinjski\", \"Obilić\" and \"Makabi\", based around the Croatian, Serbian and Jewish population of Tuzla. In 1921 the Bosniak club \"Bura\" was also formed. Unlike these confessional clubs, FK Gorki was multinational and accepted members of all faiths and ethnicities.\n\nIt is important to note that the official ground of Tuzla in this period was the field of HŠK Zrinjski built in 1928 on the road to Solina from Brčanska Malta with the help of Kalman Liska, a wood merchant and president of HŠK Zrinjski.\n\nIn 1924, because of the country-wide ban of communist activities, FK Gorki was banned by the government of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes under the orders of the infamous \"Obznana\". There was an attempt to form another worker's club, called \"Hajduk\", but this was also banned in 1924.\n\nThanks to the perseverance of labour activists, on 20 November 1927 the \"Labour-cultural and sporting society\" Sloboda (Bosnian: \"Radničko-kulturno sportsko društvo Sloboda\") was formed in Tuzla. The society initially had four sections: Sports, Tamburica, Choir and Amateur theatre. The first team of the sports section was: Karlo Mot, Nikola Kemenc, Suljo Nezirović, Alfred Puhta, Safet and Ešo Isabegović, Oto and Ivica Milinović, Josip Leder and Muho Mujezinović, Karlo Schwartz, Vlado Mileusnić, Jozo Kemenc, Rihard Žlebnik, Mujo Begić and many others.\n\nIn the beginning of 1928, the sports section becomes independent and renames itself to RSK Sloboda. Although officially under the influence of social-democrats, communists continue to have a substantial influence in the club, hence it is a continuation of the formerly banned FK Gorki. That is the reason the year of foundation is always considered to be 1919, the year when Gorki was formed and not 1928. The first game played by the new club was against FK Solvaj from Lukavac. Because of the discontinuation of several other Tuzla football clubs, like Obilić nad Bura, many players transferred to Sloboda and in 1928 it had a formidable team that consisted of the following players: Asim Mulaosmanović, Muho Mujeznović, Dejan Vujasinović, Mujko Mešković, Meša Selimović, Abdurahman Mujezinović Smrt, Vlado Mileusnić, Karlo Mot, Ivan Majer and others. It is a very interesting fact that Mehmed Meša Selimović, one of the greatest Bosniak writers of all time, played in Sloboda at this period.\n\nDuring the time of former Yugoslavia, FK Sloboda was active in the Yugoslav First League and the team had much success, despite never winning the title. The best result was achieved in 1977 when FC Sloboda has qualified for the UEFA cup 1977–78. Unfortunately, Las Palmas from Spain was stronger, 5–0 in Spain for Las Palmas and 4–3 for FK Sloboda in Tuzla. This is a club with very rich history in former Yugoslavia giving many stars such as Mesud Nalić, Omer Jusić, Rizah Mešković, Mersed Kovačević, Fuad Mulahasanović, Ismet Hadžić, Dževad Šećerbegović, Mustafa Hukić, Midhat Memišević as well as young players members of U-20 national team such as Isanović, Ćulumarević, Milošević, Hajrulahović, Jogunčić.\n\nIn 1991 Sloboda was to be relegated from 1st Yugoslav league, but after Croatian and Slovenian teams left Yugoslav 1st league Sloboda was there for season 1992 but left league with Željezničar, Sarajevo and Velež after breakout of war. Until 2000 Sloboda played First League of NFSBiH, after 2000 Sloboda played Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nSeason 1994–1995 was first season of Bosnian First League, Sloboda won Tuzla Group but lost in First Play-off Round from Bosna Visoko,and reached finals of National Cup, but lost to Čelik Zenica.\n\nNext season saw Sloboda winning third place in League, top scorer was Nedim Omerović with 17 goals, same thing happens again in Cup, losing to Čelik.\n\nIn season 1996–1997 Sloboda declined and ended up tenth in First League. In Season 1997–1998 Sloboda missed Championship Playoff with Croat teams by 3 points.\n\nSeason 1998–1999 was turbulent one, by the end of first half of championship Sloboda was in relegation zone, on winter Mustafa Hukić took club over and made great success by reaching fifth place.\n\nSeason 1999–2000 started with huge expectations, fans expected great things, but on 7 August manager of Sloboda Mustafa Hukić died in car crash, and Sloboda ended up in 7th place and runner up in 3 team finals of National Cup.\n\nNumber of great players played for team during these years such as Vedin Musić, Muhamed Konjić, Sakib Malkočević, Nedim Omerović.\n\nAfter 42 years, Sloboda got relegated from the top divisions (including both, Yugoslav and Bosnian football) to the First League of FBiH in the 2011–12 Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina season. They came back after their 2nd season of being relegated. In their first season after getting back to the top tier (2014–15), Sloboda finished at 8th place, recording the 2nd best performance of the spring part of the season (8–4–3).\n\nSloboda was the league leader of the first part of the 2015–16 Bosnian Premier League season. Until March 2016, the team were on an 18-game unbeaten run in the Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina dating back to 18 November 2015. The club took 2nd league place that season, managing also to achieve the Bosnian Cup final which was lost by Radnik Bijeljina (11 May – Tuzla: 1–1, 18 May – Bijeljina: 0–3).\n\nThe season 2016–17 was followed by turbulence. The club's board changed when Azmir Husić decided to leave the chairman seat in September and was replaced with Senad Mujkanović. The club took 5th place in the league at the end. That season left the fans with memories on one of the best come backs when Sloboda hosted Zrinjski Mostar on 19 November 2016. Zrinski had 3–0 after 51 minutes, but the Tuzla-based team managed to tie the game in the end in only 18 minutes.\n\nThe 2017–18 league season was entire to forget when the club took 10th position, just one place above relegation zone. However, through the 2017–18 Bosnian Cup, under the guidance of then manager Slavko Petrović, Sloboda made it all the way to the semi-finals, losing 4–1 on aggregate to eventual winner, Željezničar.\n\nOn 29 March 2019, the club chairman, Senad Mujkanović left Sloboda and, Sead Kozlić was named for the new club's chairman. Not even seven months after Kozlić was named as the new chairman, on 15 October 2019, Kozlić decided to step down from the position, while on the next day, October 16, Elmir Šećerbegović became the new FK Sloboda Tuzla club chairman.\n\nHome team supporters from Stadion Tušanj, which are known as \"Fukare Tuzla\", were established in 1987. The name originated from \"Red-Black Killers\" in the early 1970s.\n\nSloboda's main rival is Tuzla City, the other team from the city of Tuzla. The first match was played on 11 August 2018, when Tuzla City was the host. Sloboda won that game 1–0. Tuzla City's first derby win came on 31 August 2019, which finished 2–1 in favor of the younger Tuzla club.\n\n\n\n\nLegend: GF = Goals For. GA = Goals Against.

{"id": "1940223", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1940223", "title": "AutoRun", "text": "AutoRun\n\nAutoRun and the companion feature AutoPlay are components of the Microsoft Windows operating system that dictate what actions the system takes when a drive is mounted.\n\nAutoRun was introduced in Windows 95 to ease application installation for non-technical users and reduce the cost of software support calls. When an appropriately configured CD-ROM is inserted into a CD-ROM drive, Windows detects the arrival and checks the contents for a special file containing a set of instructions. For a CD containing software, these instructions normally initiate installation of the software from the CD-ROM onto the hard drive. To maximise the likelihood of installation success, AutoRun also acts when the drive is accessed (\"double-clicked\") in Windows Explorer (or \"My Computer\").\n\nUntil the introduction of Windows XP, the terms AutoRun and AutoPlay were used interchangeably, developers often using the former term and end users the latter. This tendency is reflected in Windows Policy settings named AutoPlay that change Windows Registry entries named AutoRun, and in the file which causes \"AutoPlay\" to be added to drives’ context menus. The terminology was of little importance until the arrival of Windows XP and its addition of a new feature to assist users in selecting appropriate actions when new media and devices were detected. This new feature was called \"AutoPlay\" and a differentiation between the two terms was created.\n\nAutoRun, a feature of Windows Explorer (actually of the shell32 dll) introduced in Windows 95, enables media and devices to launch programs by use of command listed in a file called , stored in the root directory of the medium.\n\nPrimarily used on installation CD-ROMs, the applications called are usually application installers. The autorun.inf file can also specify an icon which will represent the device visually in Explorer along with other advanced features.\n\nThe terms AutoRun and AutoPlay tend to be interchangeably used when referring to the initiating action, the action that detects and starts reading from discovered volumes. The flowchart illustration in the AutoPlay article shows how AutoRun is positioned as a layer between AutoPlay and the Shell Hardware Detection service and may help in understanding the terminology. However, to avoid confusion, this article uses the term AutoRun when referring to the initiating action.\n\nAutoPlay is a feature introduced in Windows XP which examines removable media and devices and, based on content such as pictures, music or video files, launches an appropriate application to play or display the content. If available, settings in an autorun.inf file can add to the options presented to the user.\n\nAutoPlay is based on a set of handler applications registered with the AutoPlay system. Each media type (Pictures, Music, Video) can have a set of registered handlers which can deal with playing or display that type of media.\n\nEach hardware device can have a default action occurring on discovery of a particular media type, or the AutoPlay dialog can prompt the user what action to take.\n\nThe AutoRun sequence starts with the initial discovery of a new device or new piece of media. Following this, notification of interested parties occurs, of which the Windows Explorer shell is of primary interest. After checking certain Registry settings to see if AutoRun can proceed, parsing of an optional autorun.inf may occur and any necessary actions are taken.\n\nThe initial sequence is handled much the same in every version of Windows from Windows 95. However, the way the autorun.inf file is read and acted upon and the level of integration of AutoRun with AutoPlay has changed significantly from the time AutoPlay was introduced in Windows XP until the present handling in Windows 7. In Windows 10, Microsoft has added the option to enable autorun in its settings. Not only users can turn it on but also they can choose specific external devices for autoplay.\n\nWhen a device with AutoRun-compatible drivers receives new media, a \"Media Change Notification\" event occurs. The Windows OS then notifies interested applications that a device change has occurred. The notification method used can change depending on the device type.\n\nIf the device changed is a volume (like a CD) or a port (like a serial port) Windows broadcasts a notification to all top-level windows. Windows calls this a \"basic\" notification. A top-level window is one which is a descendant of the desktop.\n\nHowever, if the device changed is not one of these types an application can use the function to register to receive device notifications.\nAn article on the CodeProject website, \"Detecting Hardware Insertion and/or Removal\", with clarifications from a blog by Doran Holan is of particular technical interest here.\nNon-volume devices are those devices that do not appear as drive letters in \"My Computer\". These are not handled by any part of AutoRun - any actions taken for these devices are taken either by device specific software or by AutoPlay. See AutoPlay#Devices that are not drives.\n\nWhen Explorer receives notification of a \"volume\" change, it performs a number of actions:\n\n\nOn Windows versions prior to Windows XP, an autorun.inf file on any drive type will be read and its instructions followed. The AutoRun task, if specified, is executed immediately without user interaction. This includes DRIVE_REMOVABLE, DRIVE_FIXED and DRIVE_REMOTE drive types.\n\nAutoRun will work with network drives (the DRIVE_REMOTE drive type) that are mapped to a drive letter. AutoRun will also work with floppy drives that are provided with autorun-compatible drivers.\n\nThe default Registry settings on Windows versions prior to Windows XP (See NoDriveTypeAutoRun), disable Remote and Removable drives from AutoRun initiation, leaving Fixed and CDROM drive types active by default.\n\nWith the introduction of AutoPlay in Windows XP, the final stage action (stage 7 above) for some drive types changed from executing an application to invoking AutoPlay. From Windows Vista, the AutoPlay system is integrated into every aspect of media handling and there is no automatic execution of the AutoRun task.\n\nThe default Registry settings add Removable drives to those that initiated AutoRun. In Windows XP and higher, \"except\" Windows Server 2003, only the Unknown and Remote drive types are not active for AutoRun.\n\nThe handling of the autorun.inf file changes very significantly between each Windows version. The details can be found in the autorun.inf article. The current handling in Windows 7 is that \"only\" drives of type DRIVE_CDROM may specify an AutoRun task, alter double-click behaviour or change context menus.\n\nAutoRun consults Windows Registry values to decide whether to initiate actions for any particular drive or drive type. These values can be changed using several methods, one of which is using Group Policy.\n\nThe primary relevant Registry entry names are and . These exist in both per-machine and per-user settings and their location and priority in the Registry are described in further detail below.\n\nThe drive types are distinguished by Type Name as follows:\n\nThe Windows Registry is a hierarchical database that stores configuration settings and options for the operating system. The terminology is somewhat misleading so it is briefly summarised here.\n\nA Registry \"key\" is similar to a folder that, in addition to values, each key can contain subkeys which in turn may contain subkeys, and so on.\n\nA Registry \"value\" consists of a name-data pair. Microsoft documentation commonly uses the term \"entry\" as an equivalent term. It also uses \"value\" for \"data\" when it is obvious what is meant. To avoid confusion, this article always uses the term \"entry\" when referring to the name-data pair.\n\nTwo Registry keys that are very commonly referred to are which contains per-machine settings, and which contains settings for the currently logged-on user. These are almost always abbreviated as and respectively. There may be many users of a machine; their settings are stored in , is actually just a link to the appropriate place in .\n\nRegistry settings may be changed directly by using the GUI tool or the command line utility. Settings can also be placed in a text file, named with a .reg extension type. For example, \"\". When the file is double clicked, the settings in the file are entered into the Registry, permissions allowing.\n\nThey can be changed indirectly by using Group Policy, applied locally to a single computer with or to a domain with .\n\nIt may be necessary to either logout or restart the computer in order for any Registry changes to take effect.\n\nThe and Registry entries can exist in two places, the per-user setting (under HKEY_CURRENT_USER) and the per-machine setting (under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE). If an entry appears under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, then any corresponding entry under HKEY_CURRENT_USER is completely ignored. The data values are not merged in any way.\n\nWhen deciding whether to activate AutoRun, both and Registry entries are consulted. If either value indicates a drive should be disabled then AutoRun is disabled for that drive.\n\nThus in the following example:\n\nthe data value taken for is 0x08, disabling drive D and the data value taken for is 0x95, disabling removable and network drives. The per-user entry is never used.\n\nThis Registry entry disables or enables the AutoRun feature on all drives of the type specified. It reflects the setting of the relevant Autoplay Group Policy. Valid data ranges from 0x00 to 0xFF in hexadecimal notation. If the entry is not present, the default data value is either 0x95 or 0x91 depending on the version of Windows used. An entry present in HKLM overrides any entry present in HKCU.\n\nThe entry data is a bitmapped value, where a bit set to 1 disables AutoRun on a particular type of drive. The bit settings for each type of drive are shown below:\n\nNote that bit number 1 is unused and that the \"Unknown\" type is represented twice. Setting all bits to 1 would give a hexadecimal value of 0xFF, decimal 255, and would disable AutoRun on all types of drives.\n\nThe default setting for this entry depends on the version of Windows being used:\n\nThis Registry entry disables or enables the AutoRun feature on individual drives. It is not associated with a Group Policy and does not exist by default. The data value is taken to be 0 if the entry is not present. An entry present in HKLM overrides any entry present in HKCU.\n\nThe data is a 32 bit (DWORD) bitmapped value, of which the lower 26 bits are used to represent each of the 26 drive letters from A to Z. Thus the valid data range is from 0x0 to 0x03FFFFFF. The least significant bit (the right most bit) represents drive A, and the 26th bit from the right represents drive Z.\n\nA bit set to 1 disables AutoRun on a particular drive. For example, if the data value is set to 0x8 (1000 binary), AutoRun is disabled on drive D.\n\nThe only Group Policy settings available for AutoRun affect the Registry entries. The policy is available on either a per-machine or a per-user basis reflecting the Registry entry location in either HKLM or HKCU. As described above, a per-machine policy setting will cause the per-user policy setting to be ignored.\n\nWhen a policy is \"Enabled\", Group Policy will add the entry to the Registry. If the policy is \"Disabled\" or set to \"Not configured\", Group Policy deletes this entry from the Registry for the Machine policy (in HKLM) and sets it back to system defaults value for the User policy (in HKCU). System defaults may then take effect as described in the NoDriveTypeAutoRun section.\n\nThe policy names, locations and possible settings vary slightly between Windows versions. The list of settings are relatively short and are always additional to the system default setting. Therefore, on Windows 2000, enabling the \"Disable Autoplay\" policy and setting it to \"CD-ROM drives\", disables AutoRun (as distinct from AutoPlay) for CD-ROM and DVD drives, removable drives, network drives, and drives of unknown type.\n\nThis setting cannot be used to enable AutoRun on drives on which it is disabled by default or disable AutoRun for drives not listed. To disable or enable any particular drives or drive types, the Registry must be edited manually.\n\nThe per-machine policy location is:\n\nThe per-user policy location is:\n\nThe relevant policy is \"Turn off Autoplay\". In Windows 2000 the policy is called \"Disable Autoplay\" instead.\n\nOnce the policy is Enabled it can be set to \"All drives\" or \"CD-ROM drives\". The latter setting adds CD-ROM drives to the existing list of disabled drive types as described above.\n\nThe per-machine policy location is:\n\nThe per-user policy location is:\n\nThe relevant policy is \"Turn off Autoplay\" and can be set for CD-ROM, DVD-ROM and removable drives or all drives.\n\nTwo related policies were added in Vista and Server 2008:\n\n\nIn these versions of Windows, the ability of an autorun.inf file to set an AutoRun task, alter double-click behaviour or change context menus is restricted to drives of type DRIVE_CDROM. There are no policy settings that will override this behaviour. Policy locations and settings are as per \"Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008\" above with the addition of:\n\n\nIf the key is held down at a certain point in the execution sequence, Windows Vista invokes the AutoPlay dialog regardless of any AutoPlay settings to the contrary. Previous versions of Windows do not execute the AutoRun task. It is essential that the \"left\" Shift key is used for this purpose as holding down the right Shift key for eight seconds invokes FilterKeys.\n\nGiven that Shift must be held down until Windows checks for it, it may be a considerable amount of time before it becomes effective. The time taken primarily depends on the time to recognise the new hardware and the time taken for CD-ROMs to spin up. It is unsafe to rely on this method.\n\nCertain Media Change Notification events may be suppressed by altering certain Registry entries. \"Media Change Notification\" is the generic term; for CD-ROM drives, the specific term is \"Auto Insert Notification\".\n\nFor CD-ROM drives, changing the value of this Registry entry to 0 will disable Auto Insert Notification for CD-ROM drives only. A Windows restart will be necessary.\n\nUnder Windows 95/98/ME, this setting can be changed under Device Manager, accessible from the System icon in Control Panel.\n\nAlthough the Registry entry is named \"AutoRun\", it only suppresses the MCN message. The MCN message does trigger AutoRun initiation but it also instructs the Explorer shell to update its views and contents.\n\nThus, as a side effect only, this disables AutoRun for CD-ROM drives. However, Explorer will now not update its view when a new CD is inserted; it will show the contents of the previous CD until is pressed or View/Refresh is selected from the Explorer menu. This could result in severe confusion for users.\n\nFor this reason the Media Change Notification message should not be disabled unless there is absolutely no alternative; AutoRun can be disabled for individual drives using Group Policy or the Registry.\n\nThis entry is used to suppress the MCN message for specifically listed type of CD-ROM drive, primarily CD-ROM changers. The data is a set of device identifiers, which matches those identifiers reported to the system by the devices themselves.\n\nThe default value for this entry consists of products identified by Microsoft testing as being unable to support AutoRun. This entry should not be altered from its default.\n\nAutoRun may be suppressed on particular drives and drive types by using the methods described in the Group Policy section. However, the Group Policy Editor is not available on Home versions of Windows XP and does not provide any fine-grained drive selection facilities.\n\nHowever, Group Policy would be the accepted method of disabling AutoRun on an entire Windows domain.\n\nA Registry setting file can be created that, when executed, makes the desired changes in the Registry.\n\nIn the above example, AutoRun would be disabled for all drives and for all users. This example would need to be run as Administrator and a reboot would be needed for the setting to take complete effect.\n\nWindows Vista and later versions of Windows have a policy setting, \"Default behavior for AutoRun\", that can be set to disallow the reading of an autorun.inf file on any volume. This avoids certain scenarios where malware leverages autorun.inf functionality to infect a machine. Previous versions of Windows do not have this policy setting but the use of initialisation file mapping is an effective workaround.\n\nAs an autorun.inf file is a standard Windows INI file, the appropriate API calls are used by Windows when fetching its settings. These API calls can be redirected using the INI file mapping method. The following Registry file illustrates the workaround, where all autorun.inf settings are taken solely from the Registry key:\n\nAs this key does not exist, it is as if the autorun.inf file contains no settings information. It is important to note that this applies to any autorun.inf in any location and on any drive.\n\nSince either the policy setting or this workaround disable autorun, installation of software from an autorunning install CD or DVD will obviously no longer be automatic. It will be necessary to view the CD's autorun.inf file and then execute the appropriate install program manually.\n\nMicrosoft recognized that \"Because code may be executed without user's knowledge or consent, users may want to disable this feature because of security concerns.\" and released a \"Fixit\" to disable AutoRun for users not comfortable with editing the registry.\n\nFrom Windows 2000 through to Windows Server 2008, AutoRun-relevant Registry entries were not handled properly leading to a security vulnerability. Windows 95 and Windows 98 were not affected.\n\nWhen AutoRun is disabled, Windows should not proceed further through the activation sequence than the Registry check. However, it parses any autorun.inf found and does everything except the final action to invoke AutoPlay or execute an application.\n\nThis leaves the user open to attack from malware which uses the autorun.inf to alter the double-click and contextual menu behaviours. Double clicking the drive icon will infect the machine. Right Clicking and selecting the \"Explore\" or \"Open\" options from the context menu is not a workaround as these menu items can be coopted by the appropriate autorun.inf entries.\n\nThis bug was fixed in a number of security updates, detailed in Microsoft Knowledge Base article 967715.\n\nAutoRun functionality has been used as a malware vector for some time. Prior to Windows Vista, the default action with a CD-ROM drive type was to follow any autorun.inf file instructions without prompts or warnings. This makes rogue CD-ROMs one possible infection vector.\n\nIn the same category are mixed content CD-ROMs. An audio CD, that a user would not expect to contain software at all, can contain a data section with an autorun.inf. Some companies, such as Sony BMG, have used this vector to install malware that attempts to protect against copying of the audio tracks.\n\nU3 enabled flash drives, by emulating a CD-ROM unit, can also cause Windows to execute commands from the autorun.inf found on the emulated CD-ROM.\n\nDevices like the Huawei E220 HSDPA modem validly use this method to autoinstall drivers for the modem itself. However, plugging in a flash drive from an unknown source is an unwise move. USB Switchblade and similar tools have made U3 flash drive attacks trivial. Given the ease of writing script based attacks, anti-virus software may be ineffective in preventing data and password stealing.\n\nWith a standard flash drive, social engineering attacks can be employed to entice a user to click on the appropriate item in the AutoPlay dialog. An alluring action string promising free games or pornography would lure many users into the trap. At any time, double clicking on the drive icon will use the autorun.inf automatically, a trap more advanced users could fall into.\n\nAny user can configure AutoPlay to make various decisions for them; by checking the appropriate box in the AutoPlay dialog, running flash drive malware becomes silent and automatic.\n\nAutoRun malware has been extended to use hard drives, picture frames and other digital devices. Care in dealing with external devices is a security priority. The prevalence of malware infection by means of AutoRun and USB flash drive was documented in a 2011 Microsoft study analyzing data from more than 600 million systems worldwide in the first half of 2011. The study found that 26 percent of all malware infections of Windows system were due to USB flash drives exploiting the AutoRun feature in Microsoft Windows. That finding was in line with other statistics, such as the monthly reporting of most commonly detected malware by antivirus company ESET, which lists abuse of autorun.inf as first among the top ten threats in 2011.\n\nIn addition to basic security precautions, which include\nexposure to these attacks can be minimised through the appropriate use of Group Policy and Registry settings. The following security policies are a summary of those described within this article:\n\n\nIn addition, the following actions have been recommended by Microsoft, primarily during the Conficker worm attacks:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1940236", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1940236", "title": "AutoPlay", "text": "AutoPlay\n\nAutoPlay, a feature introduced in Windows 98, examines newly discovered removable media and devices and, based on content such as pictures, music or video files, launches an appropriate application to play or display the content. It is closely related to the AutoRun operating system feature. AutoPlay was created in order to simplify the use of peripheral devices – MP3 players, memory cards, USB storage devices and others – by automatically starting the software needed to access and view the content on these devices. AutoPlay can be enhanced by AutoPlay-compatible software and hardware. It can be configured by the user to associate favourite applications with AutoPlay events and actions.\n\nWhen a user inserts a CD-ROM into a drive or attaches a USB camera, Windows detects the arrival and starts a process of examining the device or searching the medium. It is looking for properties of the device or content on the medium so that AutoPlay can present a set of meaningful options to the user. When the user makes a particular choice, they also have the option to make that selection automatic the next time Windows sees that content or device.\n\nThe dialog shows the result of a user placing a DVD into a DVD reader, in this case the drive. AutoPlay has determined that content is most likely a DVD movie and presents a set of actions to the user based on that decision. These actions are called \"Handlers\" and there are sets of Handlers associated with various types of content. The user can now make their decision and click OK to proceed. However, if they also tick the \"Always do the selected action\" tick box at this point, they will not be prompted the next time that particular content type is seen on that particular drive; the selected application will automatically start.\n\nIf a user regrets that decision or wishes to make automatic AutoPlay selections for any particular content type, the AutoPlay properties for any drive are accessible through the \"My Computer\" desktop icon. Selecting a drive and then \"File/Properties\" from the Windows Explorer menu, followed by the selecting the AutoPlay tab, gives a dialog similar to that shown. The content types can be selected with the drop down box. Here the dialog shows the Handlers available if AutoPlay ever determines the content type on drive to be \"Pictures\". Selecting an action to perform makes that action automatic for that user. Selecting \"Prompt me each time to choose an action\" deletes any association; AutoPlay will prompt the next time.\n\nThe content types available vary with the type of drive selected. Pictures, Music files and Video files are available with any drive. DVD and CD drives can also have \"Music CD\" or \"DVD movie\" and Windows Vista adds others like \"Video CD movie\" to the list.\n\n\"Mixed content\" is the result of file content types falling into more than one of the Pictures, Music files or Video files content types. Note that a CD containing audio tracks is always considered to be a \"Music CD\" by Windows, regardless of the presence of data tracks. Therefore, a CD with Picture files, Video files and audio tracks is a \"Music CD\"; it is not \"Mixed content\".\n\nIf this is the result of the AutoPlay decision, the user is always presented with the AutoPlay dialog. This will contain a selection of applications deemed appropriate for the content found. Thus if Music files and Video files are both discovered on a flash drive, the user will get to choose from the Handlers for \"Music files\" along with the Handlers for \"Video files\". In this case, the user cannot make their selection the default one.\n\nHowever, the AutoPlay properties dialog for any drive usually gives \"Mixed content\" as a content type option. The options available here are limited to actions that can handle any type of files, usually \"Open folder to view files\" is the only Handler listed here. This enables the user to make that action the default for Mixed content.\n\nCertain types of devices do not appear as drive letters in \"My Computer\". These are called \"non-volume\" devices and AutoPlay handles them somewhat differently from volume devices like CDs and DVDs. Many digital cameras and video devices fall into this category.\n\nAs Windows cannot examine the files on the device to determine content type, it is left to the manufacturer to decide how to proceed. A manufacturer can register Handlers against their particular device, can add their device to a group of devices (e.g.: ZipDrives) or allow a device class (e.g.: all devices which are Video Cameras) to handle their device for them. This determines which Handlers will be listed in the AutoPlay dialog when their device is discovered.\n\nAs these type of devices do not have a drive letter, AutoPlay properties cannot be accessed and changed through \"My Computer\". However, when a device is attached, the discovery causes Windows to place an icon in the taskbar notification area (commonly referred to as the \"tray\"). AutoPlay preferences for this device can now be changed by clicking this icon. The adjacent image shows the icon that appeared when a video camera was attached.\n\nOn a new installation of Windows, a default set of handler applications are registered with the AutoPlay system. The following are the defaults with Windows XP SP2. The and are simply strings stored within the Handler, they can vary to give the user a better idea of what will happen if they choose that action. They can also change to suit a user's preferred language. Many Handlers use the same Windows application; for example, Windows Media Player is used to play Music files as well as DVD movies. The word \"using\" is added by AutoPlay to join the two strings neatly.\n\nWindows 95 and Windows 98 do have a primitive version of AutoPlay. Its sole job is to deal with Audio CDs and Movie DVDs and start an application to deal with them. If the new arrival does not fall into one of these categories Windows proceeds with the usual AutoRun process.\n\nThe action taken with Audio CDs and Movie DVDs essentially considers both types of media as if they were \"files\"; Explorer then simply performs the default action associated with that file type. File types and the actions associated with them can be viewed and changed from within any Explorer folder from the \"File Types\" tab of the \"Tools/Folder Options\" menu. They are stored in the Registry under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT.\n\nIf the CD is a Red Book standard format Audio CD, then Explorer calls the default action registered for the file type. This is normally set to \"Play\" and commonly calls .\n\nIf the DVD is a Movie DVD then Explorer calls the default action registered for the file type. Movie DVDs are recognised by the existence of the file . The action for DVD is also normally set to \"Play\" and commonly calls .\n\nThe fact that the check for Audio CDs and Movie DVDs is done before AutoRun has implications for disabling the automatic playing of these types of media. Disabling AutoRun via the Registry or Group Policy or looking for messages within an application does not prevent these media types from automatically playing on insertion.\n\nHowever one can disable Audio CDs by editing the file type for AudioCD and clicking \"Set default\". This will remove the Play action as the default for that file type. Alternatively, changing the (Default) entry under the key to \"\" (a blank string) will accomplish the same thing. The disabling action for Movie DVDs is the same, with \"DVD\" used in place of \"AudioCD\".\n\nThe pertinent Registry settings are shown below along with their defaults in Windows 98SE:\n\nIf a file called autorun.inf exists in the root directory of the file system, settings in that file can add to the options presented to the user or affect the view AutoPlay has of the content. Under Windows XP, the existence of this file may affect the process flow – AutoRun can proceed to executing an application directly without user intervention. Under Windows Vista, AutoRun cannot bypass AutoPlay in this way; it can only add to the options presented to the user. The Inf handling section of the AutoRun article details when and whether AutoPlay is invoked.\n\nThe AutoRun layer initially consults Windows Registry values to decides whether to initiate actions for any particular drive or drive type. If AutoRun has been disabled for the newly discovered volume, then the process halts at that point, effectively disabling AutoPlay for that volume.\n\nAfter AutoRun completes, AutoPlay initiates by doing an examination of the volume for content. This is called \"content sniffing\". AutoPlay decides whether the volume is an Audio CD, movie DVD, a blank recordable medium (a CD-R, CD-RW, DVD+R etc.) or a generic volume which contains files.\n\nIn the case of a generic volume, AutoPlay starts with the root directory and searches the file system to a depth of four directory levels below the root directory to find file types that fall into certain categories or \"content types\".\n\nIf this search takes more than a second or so, a progress dialog shows the scanning process taking place. This dialog can easily be confused with an Explorer copy operation; however, no files are being copied or moved.\n\nAs far as AutoPlay sniffing is concerned, files fall into three main categories or \"content types\". Files outside these categories are not of interest:\n\nContent is considered to be \"Mixed content\" if files fall into more than one of the three categories.\n\nContent is considered to be Unknown if the content sniffing process finds no categorisable content. This does not mean that there are no files present, just no files falling into one or more of the above three content types. In this case AutoPlay opens an Explorer window on the root directory of the medium and the process flow finishes here.\n\nIn order to class files into the three content types, the \"PerceivedType\" value associated with various file extensions is used to make the category determination. PerceivedType can be set to \"image\", \"audio\" or \"video\" to class files into Pictures, Music or Video content types respectively. There are other PerceivedTypes known to Windows (text, compressed, system and application) but these are not relevant to AutoPlay.\n\nAll file type information is stored in the Registry under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT. The following is the PerceivedType Registry information for .avi Video files and .mp3 Music files:\n\nThe EventHandler is the title of a table that makes an association between various Handlers and the triggering Event. In the case of volume-based events, the EventHandlers are generated completely internally to AutoPlay with no reference to the Registry.\n\nNote that examination of the section of the Windows Registry reveals the and keys. Off these keys, various subkeys and values would appear to relate to and even control volume-based AutoPlay. However, as of Windows XP SP2, these keys are defined solely for future use and are not accessed by AutoPlay.\n\nOne of the following predefined EventHandlers are chosen based solely on the decision AutoPlay makes internally after volume examination and content sniffing:\n\nAs Windows cannot perform content sniffing on non-volume devices, AutoPlay analyses these devices by their characteristics rather than by their content. Every newly discovered device has identification information, normally stored within the device itself. This information is gather by enumerators and is used to build identification strings which Windows refers to when accessing and referring to the device. An identification string for a particular device is called a \"Device ID\".\n\nIn order to uniquely identify each instance of each device that is installed, Windows assigns an \"Instance ID\" to each device. This ID contains location information, or a serial number if supported.\n\nCombining the Device ID with the Instance ID gives a string which uniquely identifies an individual device in a system. This is the \"Device Instance ID\". An example of a string from a PCI device is:\n\nWhen Windows discovers a new device, it stores the Device Instances in the Registry from:\n\nThe Windows Device Manager (Located under the System icon in the Control Panel) will reveal the Device Instance ID for any particular device. Getting the Properties of any device, selecting the Details tab of the Properties dialog and selecting \"Device Instance ID\" from the drop down box will retrieve the information.\n\nAnother characteristic of every device is the \"Device Interface Class\". This defines an interface contract, where a device agrees to support a basic set of Input/Output Control calls pertaining to that Device Interface Class. For example, a device agreeing to support the keyboard interface contract must support the IOCTL_KEYBOARD_QUERY_ATTRIBUTES IOCTL call, amongst others. Each class is represented as a large universally unique number called a GUID.\n\nA device can register many Device Interface Class GUIDs for itself, contracting to support various appropriate interface calls. The most common Interface Class GUID relating to storage devices is the Volume Device Interface Class GUID, }.\n\nDevice Interface Class GUIDs can be found in the Registry under:\n\nWhen a non-volume device is being analysed, AutoPlay looks in several places in the Registry for a \"DeviceHandlers\" entry. This is simply a string which, when combined with other information, selects an EventHandler (which tables the Handlers). The DeviceHandlers entries are commonly placed into the Registry by the manufacturer of the device. There are also broader categories of devices which have preassigned DeviceHandlers, Video Camera devices for example.\n\nThe first place AutoPlay looks is under the key of the device instance. For example:\n\nis the USB device identification string for an Iomega USB ZIP drive. Combined with a USB serial number, say , this forms the Device Instance ID for the device. Thus the is found at:\n\nThe DeviceHandlers value in this case is \"ZipDeviceHandler\". Other device parameters may also be present here: may specify an icon to represent the device along with to represent the device when it has no media present. specifies a friendly name for the device.\n\nIf no DeviceHandlers entry is found under the device instance, AutoPlay checks for the existence of a DeviceGroup entry, again under the device instance. This allows a whole set of devices to share device parameters.\n\nThe parameters for this device group are stored in:\n\nSo for the ZipDrive100 group example:\n\nLastly, AutoPlay searches the relevant Device Interface Class GUIDs. The parameters for device classes are stored in:\n\nHere is the entry that the Microsoft application Movie Maker registers for any and all Video Camera devices:\n\n\n\n"}

She was finally sold for scrap in 1973. \n\nUSS \"Stevens\" (DD-479) was named for both Rear Admiral Thomas H. Stevens, Jr. (1819–1896), and his father, Captain Thomas Holdup Stevens (1795–1841). She was laid down on 30 December 1941 at the Charleston Navy Yard; launched on 24 June 1942, co-sponsored by Mrs. Roland Curtin and Mrs. Frederick Stevens Hicks; and commissioned on 1 February 1943 at the Charleston Navy Yard, with Commander Frank H. Ball in command.\n\n\"Stevens\" was one of the three \"Fletcher\"-class destroyers to be completed with a catapult for a float plane, the others being (DD-477) and \"Halford\" (DD-480). The catapult and an aircraft crane were located just aft of the number 2 smokestack, in place of the after torpedo tube mount, 5 inch mount number 3, and the 2nd deck of the after deck house which normally carried a twin 40 mm anti-aircraft gun on most ships of the class. (The twin 40 mm mount was moved to the fantail, just forward of the depth charge racks, where most ships of the class carried 20 mm mounts.) It was intended that the float plane be used for scouting for the destroyer flotilla which the ship was attached to. It would be launched by the catapult, land on the water next to the ship, and be recovered by the aircraft crane. It turned out to be not operationally suitable for the intended purpose, and the 3 ships were ultimately converted to the standard Fletcher-class configuration.\n\n\"Stevens\" completed shakedown in the Atlantic during the spring of 1943, then escorted coastal convoys before heading for the Panama Canal in July. On 26 July she transited the canal, and moored at Balboa the following day. She departed on 28 July, headed west to Hawaii, and entered Pearl Harbor on 9 August. By that time, American industrial prowess was beginning to produce and put into action the powerful naval force which, within two years, brought the Japanese Empire to its knees. \"Stevens\", one of a new class of fast, well-armed destroyers, joined three new \"Essex\"-class aircraft carriers and the fast battleships \"Alabama\" (BB-60) and \"South Dakota\" (BB-57) in augmenting the U.S. Pacific Fleet. In late August, she accompanied the Task Force 15 (TF 15) carriers to warm-up raids on the Gilbert Islands. Their planes hit Marcus Island on the 31st and Tarawa on 18 September, but \"Stevens\" parted company with them and steamed for the West Coast before their 5 and 6 October raids on Wake Island. By the time of her departure from the west coast on the 6th, the assaults on Makin and on Tarawa had been made, and the atolls were all but secure.\n\nThough she had missed out on the first hop of the leapfrog across the Central Pacific, \"Stevens\" rejoined the 5th Fleet in time to be part of the second jump. Attached to Task Group 52.8 (TG 52.8), the fire support group, the destroyer participated in Operation Flintlock, the Kwajalein phase of the conquest of the Marshall Islands, in late January and early February 1944. She bombarded the islands before the landings and afterward delivered support gunfire to the Marines until it was no longer necessary.\n\nHowever, \"Stevens\"' tour of duty with the 5th Fleet in the Central Pacific soon ended, for she cleared Kwajalein on 4 February 1944 for the South Pacific area. She stopped at Funafuti, in the Ellice Islands, from 8 to 13 February; then joined \"Lang\" (DD-399), \"Hogan\" (DD-178), \"Hamilton\" (DD-141), and \"Stansbury\" (DD-180) to screen Transport Divisions 24 and 26. The convoy divided on the 15th, and the Guadalcanal detachment, consisting of \"Stevens\" and \"Lang\" screening \"DuPage\" (APA-41), \"Aquarius\" (AKA-16), and \"Almaack\" (AK-27), arrived off Koli Point three days later. On 19 February, \"Stevens\" departed Guadalcanal to accompany \"Almaack\" to New Caledonia. They reached Nouméa on 22 February. After four days at the French port, the destroyer got underway in company with SS \"Japara\" back to the Solomons. On 4 March, she screened the merchantman into Tulagi harbor; fueled at nearby Port Purvis on Florida Island; then took station ahead of SS \"Mormacwren\" for a voyage to Efate. The \"Stevens\" put into Havannah Harbor on 5 March after parting company with the merchantman, which continued on independently to Auckland, New Zealand.\n\nFollowing 10 days in the Efate area, the \"Stevens\" sortied with Task Force 37 to bombard the Kavieng area of northwestern New Ireland. Until mid-March, an assault upon this area had been assumed to be necessary to complete the circle around the huge Japanese base at Rabaul on New Britain Island and to provide a base for operations north to the Philippines. However, the decision to occupy part of the Admiralty Islands obviated Kavieng as a base; and the planners felt that the air campaign against Rabaul was proceeding so well that it was neutralizing that large Japanese base without the occupation of Kavieng. Consequently, the naval bombardment, during which the \"Stevens\" concentrated on the islands of Nusa and Nusalik, was the only phase of the operation carried out, but it was nevertheless highly effective. Samuel Eliot Morison quotes Japanese sources which attest to the \"demoralizing\" effect of the bombardments, in which \"Stevens\", two escort carriers, and 14 other destroyers joined the battleships \"New Mexico\" (BB-40), (BB-41), \"Tennessee\" (BB-43), and \"Idaho\" (BB-42).\n\nThe \"Stevens\" returned to Efate on 25 March 1944, and she remained there almost two weeks. On 5 April, she got underway with Destroyer Squadron 25 (DesRon 25) to steam up the eastern coast of New Guinea. After stopovers at Milne Bay and Cape Sudest, the destroyers rendezvoused with TG 77.4 off Cape Cretin on 19 April and steamed on to the Hollandia, New Guinea, invasion area. TG 77.4, the second echelon of the Hollandia invasion force, divided on [22 April, and the \"Stevens\" screened the western reinforcement group while its troops landed at Tanamerah Bay. She departed from Hollandia on 30 April 1944 and retraced her steps down the east coast of New Guinea, then she headed east to the Solomon Islands, entering Purvis Bay on 10 May.\n\nFor almost a month, she remained in the Solomons, escorting convoys, conducting combat training, and resting and resupplying in port. Then, on 4 June 1944, she steamed on a course for the Marshall Islands, reaching Kwajalein on the 8th, patrolling there until the 12th, and then steaming for Eniwetok. She entered that lagoon on 28 June, and stayed there until 17 July, when she departed in the screen of TG 53.3, transporting troops to the Guam assault. The task group arrived off Guam early on the morning of the day of the landings, 21 July 1944; and the \"Stevens\" fired on enemy positions as the troops disembarked from the transports and landed on the island. The destroyer continued her fire support role of delivering harassing, interdiction, and call fire in support of the American troops and Marines ashore until her departure on 26 July 1944.\n\nThe \"Stevens\" returned to Eniwetok on 30 July, and then she steamed for Guadalcanal the following day. \"Stevens\" reached Guadalcanal on 5 August, but continued on to Espiritu Santo, which she reached the next day. She departed Espiritu Santo on 14 August and moored in Purvis Bay two days later. On 17 July the \"Stevens\" headed for New Guinea. The \"Stevens\" arrived at Humboldt Bay on 21 July, and then made a trip to Maffin Bay and back; then, on 7 September, she stood out of Humboldt Bay for Aitape. She joined Task Force 77 at Aitape and, on 10 September, sortied with that task force for Morotai in the East Indies. Five days later, the assault troops stormed ashore on Morotai, to little opposition. The \"Stevens\" patrolled while the transports unloaded men and equipment. Late that afternoon, she steamed back towards Humboldt Bay, escorting HMAS \"Manoora\" and HMAS \"Kanimbla\". This small convoy reached its destination on 18 September; and the following day, \"Stevens\" joined \"McKee\" (DD-575) in the screen of another echelon bound for Morotai. Upon her arrival back at Morotai, the \"Stevens\" began patrolling as a radar and anti-submarine picket off Kaoe Bay, and serving on night's patrol south of Morotai.\n\nThe \"Stevens\" remained in the vicinity of Morotai from 23 September until 3 October. During that time, she continued her various patrols; fought off air attacks; and, after 25 September, served as headquarters for the landing craft control officer. On 3 October, she cleared Morotai in company with the \"Lang\" (DD-399). The two destroyers put into Humboldt Bay two days later. On 16 October the \"Stevens\" got underway in the screen of TG 78.6, Leyte Reinforcement Group One. After a six-day voyage, the convoy arrived in Leyte Gulf, and the \"Stevens\" refueled before escorting TG 78.10 back to New Guinea. Between 28 October and 9 December 1944, the \"Stevens\" accompanied three more convoys from the New Guinea area to Leyte Gulf.\n\nFrom 9 December 1944, until 7 June 1945, the \"Stevens\" operated primarily in the Philippines; her only break being a voyage from Lingayen Gulf to Manus; she then proceeded back via Hollandia to Leyte, where she remained from 13 February to 4 March. From 20 to 23 December 1944, she escorted the \"Ruticulus\" (AK-113) to Guiuan on Samar and back to Leyte. Between 27 December 1944 and 1 January 1945, while screening a resupply echelon (TU 78.3.15) to Mindoro and back, the \"Stevens\" shot down three enemy planes during frequent air attacks that occurred in the area. On 9 January 1945, she got underway to escort a supply echelon to Lingayen Gulf. On the day before the convoy's arrival, it was attacked by six Japanese planes; four were downed by the screen's anti-aircraft fire, and the other two departed.\n\nThe \"Stevens\"' convoy reached Lingayen Gulf on 13 January, and she patrolled on a radar picket station until 18 January, and also stood by to deliver fire support if necessary. On 23 January she returned to Leyte Island. On 2 February she rendezvoused with Task Unit 78.12.9 (TU 78.12.9), and then escorted it into San Pedro Bay on 5 February; then she departed again to rendezvous with TU 78.7.2 off Dulag, Philippines. The \"Stevens\" guarded that convoy to Lingayen Gulf, arriving on 9 February and remaining there until 13 February 1945.\n\nAfter returning from a voyage to Manus and Hollandia, back to the Philippines, she put into Manila Bay, Luzon, on 6 March, and on the 9th, she headed for Lingayen Gulf. En route, she stopped over at Mindoro on the night of 10/11 March; then she arrived at Lingayen on 12 March. From 13 to 15 March, she joined the \"Frazier\" (DD-607) in a search for downed American flyers. The \"Frazier\" picked up six men of a B-24 crew, and the \"Stevens\" was released to overtake and join TG 72.4 on 16 March. She refueled at Mangarin Bay, Mindoro, that day, and then got underway with the \"Cleveland\" (CL-55), \"Conway\" (DD-507), and \"Eaton\" (DD-510) to support the landings at Iloilo on Panay Island from 18 to 20 March. She cleared Panay on the 20th, arrived at Mindoro on 21 March, and then joined the screen of TG 74.2.\n\nFor the next month, the \"Stevens\" operated out of Subic Bay, Luzon. Next, on 14 April, she got underway with TG 74.2 to participate in the landings in the Parang-Malabang-Cotabato area of Mindanao Island. The \"Stevens\" arrived off Polloc Harbor on 17 April and patrolled the landing area, screening the \"Denver\" (CL-58) and delivering fire support for the troops, until 19 April. She returned to Subic Bay, Luzon, on 21 April, and then remained for a week and a day. On 29 April 1945, the \"Stevens\" steamed back to Mindanao, and, after a stop at Police Harbor, she reached Davao Gulf, Mindanao on 1 May. On 3 May, she supported the minesweeping units in the Santa Cruz area and again screened the USS \"Denver\", while the cruiser delivered fire support with her guns. The \"Stevens\" headed back to Subic Bay, Luzon, that same day, and she arrived on 6 May. She spent the following month in the Manila Bay-Subic Bay area, engaged in exercises, upkeep, repairs, and shore leave.\n\nOn 7 June the \"Stevens\" departed the Philippines with TG 74.2 to support the invasion of Borneo in the East Indies. From 9 to 11 June, she patrolled off Brunei Bay, Borneo, in the support force for the attack group. On the 11th, she steamed for Tawi Tawi with most of the task force. After stopping at Tawi Tawi over the night of 12/13 June, she arrived at Balikpapan, Borneo, on 15 June, and supported the Balikpapan invasion until 2 July. From 15 to 17 June, she supported the minesweepers. On the 17th, she bombarded the beaches at Klandasan and also fought off an air attack that evening during night retirement. She conducted another shore bombardment on 19 June, and then engaged shore batteries on 21 and 23 June, silencing two of them on the 23rd. The troops landed on 1 July, and the \"Stevens\" helped cover them with counter-battery and harassing fire throughout the day and into the night. The following day, she departed Balikpapan en route to Leyte Gulf, the Philippines.\n\nThe \"Stevens\" entered San Pedro Bay on 5 July and then remained there for one week. On 12 July, she steamed out of the bay, and then reached Subic Bay three days later. The USS \"Stevens\" conducted tactical and anti-submarine warfare [ASW] exercises in the Manila Bay-Subic Bay area of Luzon for the duration of the War in the Pacific.\n\nOn 28 August 1945, almost two weeks after the cessation of hostilities, the USS \"Stevens\" departed from Subic Bay with TG 71.1 and headed for the Yellow Sea and western Korea. On 30 August, the \"Stevens\", the \"Bell\" (DD-587), and the \"Burns\" (DD-588) were dispatched to Buckner Bay, Okinawa, where they reported to Carrier Division 5 for duty.\n\nThe \"Stevens\" exited that bay two days later in the screen of the carriers of TF 72 and steamed for Inchon, Korea. On 10 September, she put into Inchon for repairs and, from 19 to 20 September, she screened the \"New Orleans\" (CA-32) to Tsingtao, China. There, she assisted in the internment of Japanese ships until 29 September; then she shifted to Taku Bar where she supported troop landings until 6 October. On 7 October, the \"Stevens\" arrived at Chefoo Harbor, joined TU 71.1.5, and then steamed for Inchon. Following a five-day stay there, she departed on 13 October with troops, sailors, and Marines, bound for the United States. The \"Stevens\" stopped at Guam on 19 October, and after steaming to Hawaii, she spent two days at Pearl Harbor, Oahu. From there, she steamed to the West Coast, reaching San Diego, California, on 7 November 1945.\n\nOn 8 November 1945, after discharging her passengers, the \"Stevens\" steamed to San Pedro, California, and there reported for duty to the 19th (Reserve) Fleet for a deactivation overhaul. She was decommissioned on 2 July 1946, and she remained with the Pacific Reserve Fleet until 1 December 1972 when her name was stricken from the Navy list. On 27 November 1973, her hulk was sold to Zidell Explorations, Inc., of Portland, Oregon, for scrapping.\n\nThe USS \"Stevens\" was awarded nine battle stars for her service during World War II.\n\nComic book artist Sam Glanzman served aboard the \"Stevens\" from 1941 until 1945, and chronicled his years aboard her in a series of short stories for DC Comics and in a pair of Marvel Comics graphic novels, \"A Sailor's Story\" and \"A Sailor's Story, Book Two: Winds, Dreams, and Dragons\".\n\n"}

She is the Alice Gabriel Twight Professor of Psychology at Northwestern University. She is a leading researcher in the study of analogical reasoning.\n\nShe is a leading researcher in the study of analogical reasoning. She developed the structure-mapping theory of analogy and similarity, which has wide application. As her APA Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award citation (2016) states: “For achievements in research and theory in cognitive psychology and cognitive development, especially for developing the structure-mapping theory of analogy and similarity, for highlighting and elucidating analogy as a central learning mechanism and for describing and explaining the development and role of relational language. These ideas are vital underpinnings of a science of learning, fostering the creation of powerful learning tools that build on foundational human thinking skills and enabling new insights into human development.” Her work on structure-mapping theory was foundational for the development of the structure mapping engine by Ken Forbus. This involves the mapping of knowledge from one domain into another or from the base to the target for the purpose of guiding reasoning, to develop conjectures, and to generalize experiences into abstract schema. Gentner also maintained that this theory of analogy can be used to model other subprocesses in analogical reasoning. She also coined the \"kind world hypothesis\", claiming that superficial properties usually tell a lot about the structural features of the object: \"If something looks like a tiger, it probably is a tiger\". For this reason, she argued that due to the environment in which humans have evolved, risk avoidance became a top priority so that the cost of missing a truly deep analogy is preferable than the risk of overlooking a real danger.\n\nGentner has contributed in developing a sophisticated model of analogy use - the manner by which new situations are dealt with through adaptation based on previous experiences or similar situation that transpired in the past.\n\nGentner's contributions to cognitive theory are in three arenas: analogy (including similarity and metaphor); language development; and interactions between language and cognition.\n\nGentner was awarded the 2016 Rumelhart Prize for Contributions to the Theoretical Foundations of Human Cognition. Her Rumelhart Prize commendation states “Dr. Dedre Gentner, the recipient of the 2016 Rumelhart Prize, personifies the success of Cognitive Science as an interdisciplinary enterprise, tackling foundational questions about the mind through the seamless integration of psychological theory, empirical methodology, and computational insight. The resulting work has shaped our understanding of learning, reasoning, language, and the very nature of mental representation.\n\nGentner has made important contributions to the study of verbs, mental models, similarity, language and thought, as well as word learning in children. Underlying this diverse body of work is a common thread: an interest in how it is that we can represent and reason about relationships, such as that between the arguments of a relational predicate, or between two models that are superficially distinct, yet share common underlying structure. It's not surprising, then, that this year's recipient has also been a pioneer in the contemporary study of analogical reasoning, and it is this work for which she is best known.\n\nGentner has influenced the field not only through her prolific experimental work with both children and adults, but also for the general theory of analogical reasoning that she developed and tested alongside students and collaborators: Structure Mapping Theory. A central insight of this theory is that analogies consist of matching relational structures between a base domain and a target domain. The properties of objects in the domains need not match, and deeply nested relational structures are favored over independent relations. In the analogy between heat flow and water flow, for example, the relevant similarities involve a flow of some quantity from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure, even though the domains differ in many superficial respects. This theory was implemented in the Structure-Mapping Engine (SME), which both formalized the theory and offered a computationally-tractable algorithm for carrying out the process of mapping structures and drawing inferences.\n\nGentner's work has not been restricted to analogical reasoning, however, and her influential edited volumes – on mental models in 1983, on analogical reasoning in 2001, and on language and thought in 2003, attest to the breadth of her interests and impact.”\n\nGentner was born in San Diego, California. She received her bachelor's degree in physics from UC Berkeley during the 1970s and did graduate work in physics at the University of Chicago, before discovering the field of cognitive psychology. After a year studying cognitive science at U. Chicago, Gentner taught first grade for two years in Ghana, sparking an enduring interest in cognitive development. She then entered the graduate program at UC San Diego working with Don Norman and David Rumelhart, receiving her PhD in 1974. She taught at the University of Washington, served as Research Scientist at Bolt Beranek and Newman, and taught at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign before joining Northwestern University in 1990, her current position. Gentner co-founded Northwestern's Cognitive Science Program and the Undergraduate Major in Cognitive Science in 1991-92 and was Director of the Cognitive Science Program from 1991 to 2015. During this time the Program grew to over 100 faculty, spanning Psychology, Linguistics, Philosophy, Artificial Intelligence, Learning Science, Neuroscience, Anthropology, Communication Sciences and Disorders, and Music Cognition.\n\nGentner received an Alexander von Humboldt Research Award in 2011.

In the simplest form, the algorithm returns a single intensity threshold that separate pixels into two classes, foreground and background. This threshold is determined by minimizing intra-class intensity variance, or equivalently, by maximizing inter-class variance. Otsu's method is a one-dimensional discrete analog of Fisher's Discriminant Analysis, is related to Jenks optimization method, and is equivalent to a globally optimal k-means performed on the intensity histogram. The extension to multi-level thresholding was described in the original paper, and computationally efficient implementations have since been proposed.\n\nThe algorithm exhaustively searches for the threshold that minimizes the intra-class variance, defined as a weighted sum of variances of the two classes:\n\nWeights formula_2 and formula_3 are the probabilities of the two classes separated by a threshold formula_4 ,and formula_5 and formula_6 are variances of these two classes.\n\nThe class probability formula_7 is computed from the formula_8 bins of the histogram:\n\nFor 2 classes, minimizing the intra-class variance is equivalent to maximizing inter-class variance:\n\nwhich is expressed in terms of class probabilities formula_11 and class means formula_12, where the class means formula_13, formula_14 and formula_15 are:\n\nThe following relations can be easily verified:\n\nThe class probabilities and class means can be computed iteratively.

And if the variances of the object and the background intensities are large compared to the mean difference, or the image is severely corrupted by additive noise, the sharp valley of the gray level histogram is degraded. Then the possibly incorrect threshold determined by Otsu's method results in the segmentation error. (Here we define the object size to be the ratio of the object area to the entire image area and the mean difference to be the difference of the average intensities of the object and the background)\n\nEmpirical results show that the performance of global thresholding techniques used for object segmentation (including Otsu's method) are limited by small object size, the small mean difference between foreground and background pixels, large variances of the pixels that belong to the object and those that belong to the background, the large amount of noise, etc.\n\nVarious extensions have been developed to address limitations of Otsu's method. One popular extension is the two-dimensional Otsu's method, which performs better for the object segmentation task in noisy images. Here, the intensity value of a given pixel is compared with the average intensity of its immediate neighborhood to improve segmentation results.\n\nAt each pixel, the average gray-level value of the neighborhood is calculated. Let the gray level of the given pixel be divided into formula_8 discrete values and the average gray level is also divided into the same formula_8 values. Then a pair is formed: the pixel gray level and the average of the neighborhood formula_27. Each pair belongs to one of the formula_28 possible 2-dimensional bins. The total number of occurrences (frequency), formula_29, of a pair formula_27, divided by the total number of pixels in the image formula_31, defines the joint probability mass function in a 2-dimensional histogram:\n\nAnd the 2-dimensional Otsu's method is developed based on the 2-dimensional histogram as follows.\n\nThe probabilities of two classes can be denoted as: \n\nThe intensity mean value vectors of two classes and total mean vector can be expressed as follows:\n\nIn most cases the probability off-diagonal will be negligible, so it is easy to verify:\n\nThe inter-class discrete matrix is defined as\n\nThe trace of the discrete matrix can be expressed as\n\nwhere\n\nSimilar to one-dimensional Otsu's method, the optimal threshold formula_41 is obtained by maximizing formula_42.\n\nThe formula_43 and formula_4 is obtained iteratively which is similar with one-dimensional Otsu's method. The values of formula_43 and formula_4 are changed till we obtain the maximum of formula_42, that is\nmax,s,t = 0;\nfor ss: 0 to L-1 do\nend for\nreturn s,t;\nNotice that for evaluating formula_42, we can use a fast recursive dynamic programming algorithm to improve time performance. However, even with the dynamic programming approach, 2d Otsu's method still has large time complexity. Therefore, much research has been done to reduce the computation cost.\n\nIf summed area tables are used to build the 3 tables, sum over formula_49, sum over formula_50,\nand sum over formula_51, then the runtime complexity is the maximum of (O(N_pixels), O(N_bins*N_bins)).\nNote that if only coarse resolution is needed in terms of threshold, N_bins can be reduced.\nfunction inputs and output:\n\nhists is a formula_52 2D-histogram of grayscale value and neighborhood average grayscale value pair.\n\ntotal is the number of pairs in the given image.it is determined by the number of the bins of 2D-histogram at each direction.\n\nthreshold is the threshold obtained.\nfunction threshold = otsu_2D(hists, total)\nmaximum = 0.0;\nthreshold = 0;\nhelperVec = 0:255;\nmu_t0 = sum(sum(repmat(helperVec',1,256).*hists));\nmu_t1 = sum(sum(repmat(helperVec,256,1).*hists));\np_0 = zeros(256);\nmu_i = p_0;\nmu_j = p_0;\nfor ii = 1:256\n\nend\nend\n"}

It recalls the day in 1738 when Church of England priest John Wesley attended a group meeting in Aldersgate, London, where he received an experience of assurance of his salvation. This was the pivotal event in Wesley's life that ultimately led to the development of the Methodist movement in Britain and America. \n\nIn the calendars of the Methodist Church of Great Britain and the United Methodist Church the event is publicly commemorated in church services on the nearest Sunday to 24 May, called Aldersgate Sunday.\nAccording to his journal, Wesley found that his enthusiastic gospel message had been rejected by his Anglican brothers. Heavy-hearted, he reluctantly attended a group meeting that evening in a Moravian chapel on Aldersgate Street in London. It was there, while someone was reading from Martin Luther's Preface to the Epistle to the Romans, that he felt that his heart was \"strangely warmed\". He describes it as:\nI felt I did trust in Christ, Christ alone, for salvation; and an assurance was given me that he had taken away my sins, even mine, and saved me from the law of sin and death.\nDaniel L. Burnett called this event Wesley's \"Evangelical Conversion\", even though he was already a priest. In 1739 Wesley broke with the Moravians and founded a new society, which would become the Methodist movement.\n\nMethodists may privately commemorate the event on 24 May. Churches will also mark it on the nearest Sunday. The United Methodist Church has produced a special liturgy to be used for Aldersgate Day. The United Methodist Church also celebrates Heritage Sunday on Aldersgate Day or the preceding Sunday. Previously Heritage Sunday was held on 23 April (the date in 1968 of the church union which created The United Methodist Church) or the Sunday following that date, but in 2004 the United Methodist General Conference moved Heritage Day to coincide with Aldersgate Day.\n\nIn Britain, Wesley's Aldersgate experience is celebrated on the Sunday preceding 24 May if that day is not a Sunday.\n\nShirley Murray's hymn \"How small a spark has lit a living fire!\" celebrates Welsey's Aldersgate experience and was written in 1988 for the 250th anniversary of the event.\n\nJohn Wesley was a priest of the Church of England. In that church's new Common Worship lectionary, published in 2000, Aldersgate Day was included in the calendar as a commemoration of both John Wesley and his brother Charles.\n\n"}

Although he is remembered as the Cucumber King in the Burmese chronicles based on a legend, Sawrahan is the earliest king of Pagan whose existence has been verified by inscriptional evidence. According to scholarship, it was during Sawrahan reign that Pagan, then one of several competing city-states in Upper Burma, \"grew in authority and grandeur\". The creation of Burmese alphabet as well as the fortification of Pagan may have begun in his reign.\n\nDespite the historical importance, the king's reign is recorded in the chronicles with what has been identified as a legend by scholarship. According to the legend, Sawrahan usurped the throne from King Theinhko. Once a farmer, Nyaung-u killed Theinhko when he stole a cucumber from his field. Nyaung-u Sawrahan was accepted as king by the queen to prevent unrest in the kingdom and became known as Taungthugyi Min (Cucumber King or Farmer King; ). The story is likely a fairy tale. There are at least three other versions—an exact parallel in the Burmese fairy tale \"Princess Thudhammasari\" and two variants in Cambodian history, one in the eighth and another in the 14th century. Kings of Cambodia claim descent from the gardener.\n\nNyaung-u Sawrahan was overthrown by Kunhsaw Kyaunghpyu, who in turn was overthrown by Nyaung-u's sons Kyiso and Sokkate.\n\nVarious chronicles do not agree on the dates regarding his life and reign.

{"id": "1940273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1940273", "title": "Fort Loudoun Dam", "text": "Fort Loudoun Dam\n\nFort Loudoun Dam is a hydroelectric dam on the Tennessee River in Loudon County, Tennessee, in the southeastern United States. The dam is operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), which built the dam in the early 1940s as part of a unified plan to provide electricity and flood control in the Tennessee Valley and create a continuous navigable river channel from Knoxville, Tennessee to Paducah, Kentucky. It is the uppermost of nine TVA dams on the Tennessee River.\n\nThe dam impounds the Fort Loudoun Lake and its tailwaters are part of Watts Bar Lake. The generating capacity of Fort Loudoun Dam is enhanced by the Tellico Reservoir, from which water is diverted via canal to Fort Loudoun Lake. It and associated infrastructure were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017.\n\nFort Loudoun Dam is named after Fort Loudoun, an 18th-century British colonial fort built during the French and Indian War. The fort— which was located about south of the dam site— was named for John Campbell, 4th Earl of Loudoun, commander of British forces in North America during this period.\n\nFort Loudoun Dam is located at just over upstream from the mouth of the Tennessee River and nearly downstream from the river's source at the confluence of the Holston and French Broad at Knoxville. The river's natural confluence with the Little Tennessee River is located approximately downstream, although the Tellico Reservoir, which covers most of the lower Little Tennessee, is connected to Fort Loudoun Lake via canal which empties into the lake upstream from the dam. Lenoir City is located immediately north of Fort Loudoun Dam. The reservoir includes parts of Loudon, Blount, and Knox counties.\n\nFort Loudoun Dam was built across three small islands (known as the \"Belle Canton Islands\"), although the construction of the dam and the later construction of Tellico Dam required a drastic modification of the landscape. The northern and eastern parts of these islands are now submerged, whereas the southern and western parts were combined with part of the original mainland and part of Bussell Island (at the mouth of the Little Tennessee) to form one large island. This new island is separated from the mainland by the Tellico canal to the south and the main Tennessee River channel to the north.\n\nFrom 1963 until the bridge's closure in July 2017, Lamar Alexander Parkway (part of U.S. Route 321) crossed the J. Carmichael Greer Bridge atop Fort Loudoun Dam and connected the area to Interstate 75 and Interstate 40 to the north and to Maryville and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park to the south. US-321 intersects U.S. Route 11 just over a mile north of the dam in Lenoir City. Interstate 140 and several federal and state highways cross Fort Loudoun Lake further upstream. A new bridge south-east of the dam was completed in the summer of 2017 and now carries Parkway traffic across the river.\n\nFort Loudoun Dam is high and stretches across the Tennessee River. The reservoir has of shoreline, of water surface, and a flood storage capacity of . The dam is equipped with a lock that raises and lowers boats about between Fort Loudoun Lake (upstream) and Watts Bar Lake (downstream). There are four hydroelectric generators at the dam with a combined generation capacity of 155.6 megawatts of electricity.\n\nTo augment Fort Loudoun's power production capacity, water from the Little Tennessee River is diverted into Fort Loudoun Lake via a short canal extending from Tellico Reservoir a short distance upstream of the nearby Tellico Dam. The canal is roughly a half-mile long and effectively creates an island with Fort Loudoun Dam at its northeastern tip and Tellico Dam at its southwestern tip. The canal also allows navigation by barge-size craft between the Tellico Reservoir and Fort Loudoun Lake.\n\nIn the mid-1930s, TVA drafted its \"unified plan,\" a series of long-term goals that called for the construction of a series of dams along the Tennessee River to provide a minimum navigation channel along the entire length of the river, control flooding in the Tennessee Valley, and bring electricity to the area. The Fort Loudoun project was initially known as the Coulter Shoals project, named for a site identified by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers upstream from the present dam site in the early 1930s. After surveying the area, TVA moved the project to the Belle Canton Islands.\n\nThe TVA proposed the project in 1939 and it was authorized on April 18, 1940. Construction began on July 8, 1940, using much of the construction organization that had been used in previous months on TVA's Hiwassee River projects. TVA originally planned to complete the dam in 1944, but the outbreak of World War II brought increased funding and urgency, and the dam was completed and the gates closed August 2, 1943. The first generator went online November 9, 1943 and the second went online January 15, 1944.\n\nThe Fort Loudoun Dam project required the purchase of of land and flowage rights. 317 residents, 6 cemeteries, and over of roads had to be relocated. Construction efforts required 582,000 cubic yards of concrete and 122,000 cubic yards of riprap. Plans originally called for the installation of four 24-megawatt units, but was modified to three 32-megawatt units after the construction of Cherokee Dam alleviated the need for flexibility. The dam's lock was designed by the Army Corps of Engineers and completed in June 1943. The reservoir submerged part of Louisville, Tennessee, and required modifications to Knoxville's riverfront.\n\nIn 1942, TVA received approval to build a dam— at the time known as the \"Fort Loudoun extension\"— across the mouth of the Little Tennessee River, and divert the water via canal into the Fort Loudoun Reservoir. With the new dam extension planned, TVA received authorization for a fourth 32,000-kW generator. However, the War Production Board gave the dam's third and fourth generators a \"low priority\" rating, which effectively killed funding for the Fort Loudoun extension, and the side project was abandoned. In the 1960s, the Fort Loudoun extension was revived as the Tellico Dam project.\n\n\n"}

As Windows has a case-insensitive view of filenames, the autorun.inf file can be stored as AutoRun.inf or Autorun.INF or any other case combination.\n\nThe AutoRun component was introduced in Windows 95 as a way of reducing support costs. AutoRun enabled application CD-ROMs to automatically launch a program which could then guide the user through the installation process. By placing settings in an codice_1 file, manufacturers could decide what actions were taken when their CD-ROM was inserted. The simplest autorun.inf files have just two settings: one specifying an icon to represent the CD in Windows Explorer (or \"My Computer\") and one specifying which application to run.\n\nExtra settings have been added in successive versions of Windows to support AutoPlay and other new features.\n\ncodice_1 is an ASCII text file located in the root folder of a CD-ROM or other \"volume\" device medium (See AutoPlay device types). The structure is that of a classic Windows .ini file, containing information and commands as \"key=value\" pairs, grouped into sections.

This functionality was removed in Windows 7 and a patch for Windows XP and Vista was released on August 25, 2009 and included in Microsoft Automatic Updates on February 8, 2011.\n\nThe mere existence of an autorun.inf file on a medium does not mean that Windows will automatically read it or use its settings. How an inf file is handled depends on the version of Windows in use, the volume drive type and certain Registry settings.\n\nAssuming Registry settings allow, the following autorun.inf handling takes place:\n\n\nThis simple autorun.inf file specifies codice_11 as the application to run when AutoRun is activated.

{"id": "1940276", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1940276", "title": "Heinz pickle pin", "text": "Heinz pickle pin\n\nThe Heinz pickle pin is an advertising item from the H. J. Heinz Company, being a small green pin made in the shape of a pickle. Being continuously offered for more than a century, and with more than 100 million pins produced over the years, it is both one of the longest-running and most successful promotions in history.\n\nThe Heinz pickle pin is very small, about inches long , dark green, and fully \"three-dimensional\". The word HEINZ appears across the pickle in raised lettering. Because its \"retro\" design and long tradition are part of the appeal of the pickle pin, the design has changed relatively little in over a century of production. The few changes made have been relatively minor. The original pins were made from gutta-percha, a resin material which was a predecessor to modern plastics, and widely used in the 1800s for dental fillings, jewelry, and insulation for wiring. More recent pins use modern plastic. The pinback has changed from a simple wire which clasps around itself to a modern safety-pin back. The earliest pins had a wire pendant-like hook, allowing them to be hung from a string. Finally, the color has varied somewhat, from a realistic light green matte to the darker and shinier cucumber green used today\n\nThe pickle pin was envisioned by Heinz company founder H. J. Heinz, and predates even the \"57 varieties\" slogan for which Heinz is famous. The first Heinz pickle pins were given away at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, also known as the World's Columbian Exposition, where a simple and inexpensive gift was thought to be necessary to draw visitors toward Heinz's relatively out-of-the-way booth in the upper gallery of the Agricultural Building. Heinz believed that the public could help advertise the Heinz brand by wearing a branded item: \"We keep our shingle out and then let the public blow our horn, and that counts.\" Today, when clothing bearing corporate logos is a common sight, this might seem obvious. At the time, however, it represented a new and different marketing concept. Heinz had some local boys scatter thousands of small white tokens around the fairground, with text offering the \"finder\" a free souvenir if they came to the Heinz booth. Their reward for stopping by was the opportunity to sample some food, and a complimentary promotional pickle pin. Heinz would distribute one million pickle pins by the fair's end, making the promotion an incredible success.\n\nThough undoubtedly a success, the actual impact of the pickle promotion on Heinz's business may have been slightly exaggerated. Literature at the time suggested that the pin saved Heinz from certain financial doom. A contemporary ad read spoke of Mr. Heinz: \"A man who found himself in a pickle... was saved by one.\" Whether this is literally true is speculative, but the Heinz company has stuck with this line, even including the preceding quote in a 1999 press release. The success of the pickle pin promotion has achieved almost legendary status, including a story that several of the first-floor fair exhibitors sued Heinz for unfair competition, while the second floor vendors, swamped with guests because of the traffic Heinz drew, threw a gala dinner in his honor.\n\nAfter the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, Heinz continued distributing its pickle pins at events and by other means. Atlantic City's Iron Pier, opened in 1896, would in 1898 be purchased by Heinz and renamed Heinz Pier. The pier was a popular tourist attraction, featuring a museum, food samples, and free pickle pins. Heinz gave out pickle pins on the pier for nearly half a century and still do to this day at the nearby Atlantic City Historical Museum. Another venue where the Heinz pickle pins famously appeared was the 1939 New York World's Fair, where Heinz had an enormous exhibit building called the Heinz Dome. In 1982, at the World's Fair in Knoxville, Tennessee, Heinz once again gave out free pickle pins, but this time with a twist: the pins were distributed by a huge motorized ketchup bottle which moved freely around the fairgrounds. Visitors to Pittsburgh could acquire a pickle pin by taking the Heinz factory tour. Today, Heinz distributes the pins mostly one-by-one, by mail, for free to people who write in to their corporate address to request one. According to Heinz, they distribute just under a million pickle pins a year.\n\nFor the year 2000, the Heinz company decided to try something new for its pickle pin. For the first time, an entirely different pin was produced. Rather than a pickle, the new pin was shaped like a red Heinz ketchup bottle, complete with painted white cap and keystone-shaped label. The first batch of ketchup pins made also feature a printed \"2000\" to denote its commemorative status. A total of one million ketchup pins were produced, which is roughly the equivalent of a year's worth of pickle pins.\n\nBesides the year 2000 ketchup pin, several similar items to the Heinz pickle pin have appeared over the years. A golden lapel pin in the shape of a pickle is a recent example, and Heinz has also made a pickle whistle, presumably as a fun item for kids too young to wear a pin (similar to the Oscar Mayer hot dog whistles distributed from the Wienermobile). In recent years, the amount of Heinz merchandise available has become so large that Heinz actually operates its own retail store called the House of Heinz, located in Grove City, Pennsylvania.\n\n"}

Raised in a musical family, he was playing guitar, playing keyboards and writing songs by the age of 12. His older brother, record producer Laney Stewart, introduced him to one of his first music business mentors, the late Louis Silas, Jr. Silas fostered Stewart's music career by giving him the opportunity to contribute to the projects of several major artists. Before graduating high school, Stewart had placements with artists such as Aaron Hall, rhythm and blues trio IMx, and Chanté Moore. He credits working with Moore opened many doors for his burgeoning music career.\n\nIn 1994, Stewart produced \"Treat U Right\" for Blackgirl. He also met Record Producer and Songwriter L.A. Reid, who offered him a deal to move his first production company to Atlanta. In 1995, with the support of Reid, in partnership with his brother Mark Stewart, and his sister-in-law Judi Stewart-RedZone Entertainment and Triangle Sound Studios were created. RedZone Entertainment is based in Atlanta, but also has a recording studio in Los Angeles.\n\nStewart's career and reputation continued to soar, with a major breakthrough in 1999 when he co-wrote the single \"Who Dat\" for JT Money. \"Who Dat\" was a No. 1 rap single, ASCAP's \"Song of the Year\", and reached No. 5 on the \"Billboard\" pop chart. In addition to producing and writing, he scouted new talent and managed, Stewart jump-started the careers of artists such as Solé and Blu Cantrell.\n\nIn 2000, Tricky co-wrote and produced Interscope artist Mýa's breakthrough single \"Case of the Ex\", It peaked at number 2 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 in December 2000, and stayed in the Top 10 for three months. While Mya's song was still on top, Stewart discovered and signed Blu Cantrell, and went on to executive produce her debut album \"So Blu\" on Arista Records. It peaked at No. 8 on the \"Billboard\" 200 album chart and spawned the No. 2 hit \"Hit 'em Up Style (Oops!)\".\n\nIn 2002, Stewart co-produced and co-wrote B2K's debut single, \"Uh Huh\". It was No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for 10 weeks. In 2003, Blu Cantrell's second album, \"Bittersweet\", was released; it features three songs produced by Stewart, \"Unhappy\", \"Holding on to Love\" and \"Let Her Go\". He also co-wrote and produced a number of songs for Britney Spears's fourth album, \"In the Zone\" (2003), including two of its singles, \"Me Against the Music\" and \"Outrageous\", as well as \"Early Mornin'\" and \"The Hook Up\".\n\n2007 was a breakthrough year for Stewart and RedZone Entertainment.

On April 2, 2008 it was announced that \"Touch My Body\" became Carey's 18th No. 1 single on the Billboard Hot 100, pushing her to second place among artists with the most No. 1 singles in the rock era and first place as a solo artist in the same category, surpassing Elvis Presley. The achievement was attributed to a record-breaking digital sales debut, as 286,000 copies were sold in its first week of availability.\n\nAdditionally, in 2008 he produced the songs, \"16 @ War\" for Karina Pasian, and \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" for Beyoncé as well as the ballad \"Smash into You\". \"Single Ladies\" would later become a pop culture phenomenon due to its female empowerment lyrics, catchy melody and much parodied music video. The song would also win multiple Grammy and MTV Video Music Awards, and remain's Stewart's best-selling single.\n\nHe produced a High Price featuring Ludacris for Ciara's 2009 album, Fantasy Ride. He also worked with Japanese-American singer-songwriter Utada on her third English studio album This Is The One which he produced four songs from the record.\n\nTricky and The-Dream almost exclusively co-wrote (with Mariah) and produced the entirety of Mariah Carey's 2009 album, \"Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel\".\n\nTricky and The-Dream executive-produced Ciara's fourth studio album titled \"Basic Instinct\", which was released on December 10, 2010. The lead single from the album titled \"Ride\", was produced by the duo, the single was released in April 2010 and went on to become Ciara's twelfth top ten hit on the Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.\n\nStewart contributed to the Christina Aguilera album \"Bionic\", released in June 2010, and produced the score for her debut film, \"Burlesque\", released in November 2010.\n\nStewart produced the Katy Perry second studio album, named \"Teenage Dream\" and was released in 2010. The second promotional single, \"Circle the Drain\", produced by Tricky was released on iTunes on August 10, 2010.\n\nStewart is confirmed to be taking part in Jennifer Lopez's eighth studio album \"Love?\" which is looking at a Summer 2010 releasing alongside The-Dream and Tricky Stewart making it her debut release with Def Jam Records after completing her 10-year contract with Epic Records in February 2010.\n\nStewart and The Dream are again, teaming up to work on Kim Kardashian's debut single Jam (Turn It Up) and on Jessica Simpson's holiday album Happy Christmas and upcoming pop album.\n\nStewart and The Dream announced they are working on Estonian singer Kerli's second album.

It is primary (but unsigned) along US 41A and US 41 between Sewanee and Tracy City. From Tracy City to the Kentucky line, SR 56 is a signed primary route, except west from North Springs to Willette, where SR 151 carries primary traffic more directly to Red Boiling Springs.\n\nSR 56 begins as a secondary state route at the Alabama state line south of Sherwood in Franklin County, (as a 2-lane) where the road continues south as Alabama State Route 117 into Jackson County, Alabama. SR 56 continues northward to the Crow Creek Valley, which is full of farmland, and passes through Sherwood before the highway becomes very curvy as it ascends into the Cumberland Plateau.\n\nSR 56 then enters Sewanee to become concurrent with US 41A/SR 15. The highway then turns east and becomes an unsigned primary highway. They have a junction with SR 156 in Saint Andrews before continuing to an interchange with I-24/US 64 (Exit 134) and entering Monteagle. They then have an intersection with US 41/SR 2, where both US 41A and SR 15 end and the roadway is taken over by US 41/SR 2, with SR 56 becoming concurrent with them as they enter downtown, straddling the line with Marion and Grundy Counties. After passing through downtown, they come to an intersection where SR 2 splits from US 41/SR 56, through it is unsigned, and US 41/SR 56 then continue east and leave Monteagle. They continue through countryside, and passing through South Cumberland State Park, before entering Tracy City, where SR 56 splits from US 41 to turn northward from Marion County into Grundy County, while US 41 turns south along unsigned SR 150. SR 56 continues north as a signed primary highway and passes through countryside and the community of Coalmont before becoming concurrent with SR 108 before entering Altamont. They enter downtown and have an intersection with SR 50 before SR 108 splits off and turns east. SR 56 continues north and passes through Beersheba Springs before becoming curvy again as it descends the plateau before traveling up a narrow valley, where it passes through Irving College and runs parallel to the Collins River, before crossing into Warren County. SR 56 then continues on through farmland before entering into the city of McMinnville.\n\nSR 56 traverses the center of the city of McMinnville. It enters the city at the intersection with SR 127. It then proceeds north through a neighborhood before having a Y-Intersection with SR 8, before becoming E Colville Street and passing through a major business district and crossing a bridge over the Barren Fork River. It then curves to the west and has an intersection with SR 380 (Main Street), just before entering downtown and coming to an intersection with SR 55 Bus (Chancery Street). SR 56 then turns north again along Chancery Street straight through the middle of downtown before having another intersection with SR 380 and widening a 4-lane undivided highway (Smithville Highway) to leave downtown and run through a major business district. It then has an intersection with US 70S/SR 1 (Bobby Ray Memorial Parkway) before narrowing to 2-lanes and leaving McMinnville. SR 56 continues north through farmland to have an intersection with SR 287 before crossing into DeKalb County.\n\nSR 56 proceeds northward to have an intersection with SR 288 before entering Smithville to have an intersection with US 70/SR 26 in downtown. It then has an intersection with SR 83 near Smithville Municipal Airport before leaving Smithville to enter mountains, and become curvy again, and cross into Putnam County.\n\nSR 56 continues north zig-zagging and crisscrossing atop various mountains and ridges before crossing a bridge over Center Hill Lake. It then continues through the mountains before entering Silver Point to have an intersection with SR 141 before becoming concurrent with I-40 at Exit 273.\n\nSR 56 runs concurrently with I-40 between exits 273 and 280. Old Baxter Road, the original SR 56 alignment from Silver Point to Baxter closely follows the interstate. After the junction with US 70N/SR 24, SR 56 continues northward through farmland and Bloomington Springs into Jackson County.\n\nThe highway then has an intersection and short concurrency with SR 290 in Center Grove before passing through some mountains and entering the town of Gainesboro. In downtown, SR 56 becomes concurrent with SR 53, and the two go north to the banks of the Cumberland River, where SR 53 splits from SR 56. SR 56 then becomes concurrent with SR 85 and SR 135 before crossing the river to leave Gainesboro. They continue through countryside to Jennings Creek, where SR 85 splits off, before heading on to Whitleyville, where SR 135 splits off via a Y-Intersection.\n\nThe route from I-40 to Gainesboro is known to residents of the Upper Cumberland as part of the Corridor J-1 project of the Appalachian Development Highway System, a unit of the Appalachian Regional Commission.\n\nSR 56 turns westward to meet SR 151 at North Springs, where SR 56 becomes a secondary route, enters Macon County, and makes a right turn to the north at the junction of SR 80 and SR 262 at Willette. SR 56 becomes primary again as the highway then enters farmland again and continues north to an intersection with SR 52 before entering Red Boiling Springs. It then continues into downtown to have another intersection with SR 151 before leaving Red Boiling Springs to continue north through farmland to end at the Kentucky state line. Upon reaching the Kentucky state line, the road continues as Kentucky Route 63 one mile south of Gamaliel, KY.\n\nSR 56's entire course from Altamont to Gainesboro is a part of the Tennessee Scenic Parkway system.\n\nBefore Interstate 40 was built in the 1960s, SR 56 went from Smithville to Silver Point, and right-turns to proceed up what is now the Old Baxter Road from Silver Point to Baxter, and then it went directly through the town of Baxter. After the interstate came through, a spur route was built to intersect with Exit 280 (the Baxter - Gainesboro exit) that bypasses Baxter.\n\nThe stretch of SR 56 between I-40 and Smithville was notorious for terrible curves prior to the late 1970s, but it was rebuilt and is now considered a good route to follow. Small sections of the original alignment that stil exist is now maintained by the county road departments of De Kalb and Puntam Counties.\n\nSR 52 ran concurrently with SR 56 through Red Boiling Springs, and branched out eastward towards Clay County until 2003, when SR 52 was rerouted onto a bypass route around the city.\n\n"}

He is known as a proponent of aristocracy and an anti-egalitarianism, and in the early 20th century was a leading British conservative author. He wrote on subjects including art, metaphysics, politics, economics, religion, the differences between the sexes and races, health, and eugenics.\n\nLudovici began his career as an artist, painting and illustrating books. He was private secretary to sculptor Auguste Rodin for several months in 1906. He later wrote over 30 books, and translating many others.\n\nLudovici was born in London, England on 8 January 1882 to Albert Ludovici, and Marie Cals. Ludovici's father and grandfather, Albert Ludovici, Sr., were both artists. He was of Basque, French, German and Italian ancestry. He was educated privately, in England and abroad but chiefly by his mother. As a young student he became friends with Harry Guy Radcliffe Drew, whom he met at the Paris Exhibition of 1900. Years later he befriended Drew's young daughters Dorothy (later a student of F. M. Alexander) and Joyce (better known as architect Jane Drew). He married Elsie Finnimore Buckley on 20 March 1920, and they first lived at 35 Central Hill, Upper Norwood in South London. He spent several years in Germany where he studied Nietzsche's writings in the original German. He was fluent in several languages.\n\nHe began lecturing on art, politics, religion, and the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche, about whom he wrote \"Who is to be Master of the World?: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche\" (1909) and \"Nietzsche: His Life and Works\" (1910). Nietzsche scholar William Mackintire Salter called \"Nietzsche: His Life and Works\" \"the well-nigh perfect short manual\" on Nietzsche. According to Steven Aschheim, his 1911 \"Nietzsche and Art\" was \"a unique attempt to write a Nietzschean history of art in terms of rising aristocratic and decadent-democratic epochs\". This was the year of the first Parliament Act 1911, cutting back the power of the House of Lords. It also marks a watershed or change in Ludovici's writing, to a more overt political line, which would only sharpen over the next 25 years.\n\nDuring World War I he joined the New Army as a translator, and then served as an artillery officer at Armentières and the Somme, where he described himself as \"a miserable and vermin-ridden trench-rat\", and then in the Intelligence Staff at the War Office, where after two years of service he rose to head of his department (MI6 A). He was awarded the Order of the British Empire, which he immediately returned because he felt that it was too easily attainable and held by too many people. He attained the rank of Captain during World War I., He was subsequently called 'Captain' as a nickname.\n\nAfter the war, he became a student of Dr. Oscar Levy, editor of \"The Complete Works of Friedrich Nietzsche\", the first translation of Nietzsche's works in English. Ludovici contributed several volumes.\n\nLudovici came across the Alexander Technique in 1925 and said he had lessons in 'deportment' over a period of four years with F.M. Alexander.\n\nLudovici's writing was varied, and took traditional conservative stances on social issues. Liberalism, socialism, Marxism, Christianity, feminism, multiculturalism, the modern culture of consumerism and revolt against tradition constituted Ludovici's main areas of attack.\n\nHe wrote \"I have long been an opponent and critic of Christianity, democracy, and anarchy in art and literature. I am particularly opposed to 'Abstract Art,' which I trace to Whistler's heretical doctrines of art and chiefly to his denial that the subject matters, his assimilation of the graphic arts and music, and his insistence on the superior importance of the composition and colour-harmony of a picture, over its representational content.\" He was an early critic of Jacob Epstein, attacking him in \"The New Age\", to which he contributed as an art critic before the Great War.\n\nIn his \"A Defence of Aristocracy\" (1915), Ludovici defends aristocracy against government in popular control. In \"The False Assumptions of \"Democracy\"\" (1921), he attacked the democratic idea and the liberal attitude in general, as being unnatural. \"A Defence of Conservatism\" (1927) defends tradition as being tied to survival.\n\nFor Ludovici, egalitarianism was a denial of the innate biological differences between individuals, the sexes and races. He criticized what he saw as the sentimental coddling of the mediocre and botched. His articles were a regular feature of the \"New Pioneer\", a far-right journal controlled by Viscount Lymington and closely linked to the British People's Party. Ludovici repeatedly warned of the dangers of miscegenation and defended incest as an appropriate response to racial mixing, arguing that society should act 'to break down the barriers now preventing the mating of close relatives' as it was the only way to cause 'a purification of our stock.' .\n\nLudovici's views were nationalist and traditionalist, and he supported eugenics. He argued that heredity influences group values and national and racial characteristics.\n\nHe was on the Selection Committee of the Right Book Club, with Norman Thwaites, Trevor Blakemore, Collinson Owen and W. A. Foyle.\n\nAfter the Second World War, Ludovici fell into obscurity. In 1936, he had written enthusiastically about Adolf Hitler, whom he had met personally that year, along with many other high-ranking Nazi leaders. He was critical of the effect of Jews on the history of England, writing a work under the pseudonym Cobbett, \"The Jews, and the Jews in England\" (1938).\n\nLudovici was dismissed from his intelligence work on 14 August 1940 and his house was subsequently raided allegedly due to his membership of the political group The Right Club. On Friday 8 October 1940, Ludovici was interviewed at Scotland Yard, and then released.\n\nFrom 1955 until 1969 Ludovici wrote a series of articles in the monthly journal \"The South African Observer\". Topics under his analysis included \"The Essentials of Good Government\" in a series of 20 monthly parts, and \"Public Opinion in England\" in a similar series.\n\n\nCompilations\n\n\nAutobiography\n\n\"The Confessions of an Anti-Feminist: The Autobiography of Anthony M.

{"id": "1940317", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1940317", "title": "Piledriver (professional wrestling)", "text": "Piledriver (professional wrestling)\n\nA piledriver is a professional wrestling driver move in which the wrestler grabs their opponent, turns them upside-down, and drops into a sitting or kneeling position, driving the opponent head-first into the mat. The technique is said to have been innovated by Wild Bill Longson.\n\nThe name is taken from a piece of construction equipment, also called a pile driver, that drives countless massive impacts on the top of a large major foundation support, burying it in the ground slowly with each impact. The \"act\" of performing a piledriver is called \"piledriving.\" Someone who has recently been the victim of a piledriver is said to have been \"piledriven\" (e.g. \"The wrestler was \"piledriven\" into the canvas\").\n\nNotable wrestlers who have regularly used a piledriver during their career include Jerry Lawler, Bret Hart, Harley Race, Paul Orndorff, The Undertaker, Kane, The Brain Busters, Buddy Rogers, Minoru Suzuki, Karl Gotch, and Kazuchika Okada.\n\nThe piledriver is often seen as one of the most dangerous moves in wrestling. The sitout reverse piledriver is directly responsible for shortening the career of Stone Cold Steve Austin when his opponent, Owen Hart, inadvertently botched the move, legitimately breaking Austin's neck. Due to this, the move is banned in the WWE with the exception of Kane and The Undertaker due to their experience and having already established the \"Tombstone\" (kneeling belly-to-belly variant) as a finisher; along with the flip piledriver in recent times, done by Adam Cole and Rey Mysterio.\n\nThe piledriver is generally considered a dangerous maneuver in wrestling because of the potential impact on the head and compression of the neck. The proper way to execute the move, in most cases, is for the wrestler performing the move to tuck the opponent's head between his legs before falling to the mat (there are variations that are performed differently, as the list below indicates). If done in this manner, the wrestler receiving the move will land with little or no contact made with the mat at all and thus not run the risk of injury. If the head is not secured and is protruding from between the wrestler's legs, the wrestler receiving the move risks serious injury and potential paralysis as he will likely land with the entire weight of his body on the crown of his head. Perhaps the most famous example of an injury from an improperly performed piledriver came at the 1997 WWF SummerSlam event. In a match between Owen Hart and Stone Cold Steve Austin, Hart was to perform a sitout reverse piledriver on Austin, who later said that he was not sure if the move was a good idea to perform as he was unsure if his head could properly be protected. As Austin had feared, Hart botched the move and dropped Austin on top of his head. The impact jammed Austin's neck and left him temporarily paralyzed. He continued and finished the match, but stayed away from the ring for two months to recover from the injury. The physical demands of Austin's standing as one of the top stars in the WWF did not allow much downtime for him to rest and take care of the injury and as his career progressed, the damage got worse. Austin underwent surgery on the neck in 1999, but it never fully healed. By 2002, Austin's doctors told him that he risked permanent disability if he did not retire, and he finally did so in April 2003.\n\nThe piledriver was banned in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now known as the WWE) in 2000, unless the wrestler has special permission to use the move. In a discussion in 2007, Stephanie McMahon said that only two wrestlers were allowed to use the move, \"two of the stronger guys\", Undertaker and Kane. In fact, The Undertaker's tombstone piledriver continues to be his finishing move. The piledriver is also banned in many other promotions and certain cities. It is also considered an automatic disqualification in professional wrestling matches held in Tennessee, as the move is banned in that state. In some promotions in the United Kingdom, the move can result in not only a disqualification, but a fine. In Mexico, the piledriver (called a \"martinete\") is an automatic disqualification.\n\nBecause of the dangers of the piledriver, it is classed as a foul and is illegal in mixed martial arts under the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts.\n\nAny double-team move in which one wrestler helps another to perform a piledriver on an opponent by pushing down on the opponent's legs for more impact. In a variation of the move, the second wrestler jumps off the turnbuckle while pushing the opponent's feet downward for even more damage, this is well known as a \"spike piledriver\" (not to be confused with a one-man spike piledriver).\n\nThe move is executed from an Argentine backbreaker rack (face up, with the neck and one leg cradled) position. The wrestler pushes the opponent forward while holding the opponent's leg with one arm, and the head with the other arm, and then sits down, driving the opponent head first down to the floor. Super Dragon used this move throughout his career, calling it the \"Psycho Driver\". He also has a cutthroat version (draping one of the opponent's arm across their neck, similarly to the setup of a Million Dollar Dream) called \"Psycho Driver III\".\n\nThe wrestler bends forward or crouches in front of their opponent, grabs hold of the opponent around the legs and stands up, lifting the opponent upside down facing the wrestler's back. The wrestler then either sits down or drops onto his knees, driving the opponent's head down to the mat.\n\nA variation on this which is sometimes known as the sunset driver sees the attacking wrestler hook the opponent's legs underneath their arms while holding the opponent up in the back to belly position. From here, the wrestler drops to their knees, driving the opponent's head into the mat. This move will often see the attacking wrestler hold the move after landing for a rana style pinfall attempt.\n\nThis move begins with the wrestler facing his opponent. From there, the wrestler will pick up the opponent and place them over their shoulder so that the opponent's head is dangling over the wrestler's back by the waist of the wrestler. The wrestler then holds the opponent in place by holding their leg with one arm and applies a headlock to the opponent with their other arm, bending the opponent across the attackers back. The wrestler then drops to a seated position, driving the head and upper back of the opponent into the ground. This move was innovated by Mariko Yoshida, and named the move the \"Air Raid Crash\", and was popularized by Fit Finlay, who dubbed it the \"Celtic Cross\", Cima, who uses it as the \"Schwein\" and Sheamus who dubs the move \"White Noise\".\n\nThe user of this move first starts by putting the opponent into a pumphandle position, then lifting them into the air perpendicular to the ground and upside down, rotating them so that their back is against the chest. The user then proceeds to fall to a seated position, while dropping the opponent onto their head, neck, and/or shoulders. This move was popularized by Super Dragon, who called it \"Psycho Driver II\".\n\nAlso known as a Texas, or traditional piledriver, this is the classic and original piledriver technique. From a position in which the opponent is bent forward and the opponent's head is tucked between the attackers thighs in a standing headscissors, the wrestler grabs around the opponent's midsection and lifts so that the opponent is held upside down facing in the same direction as the wrestler, the wrestler then drops to a sitting position with the opponent's head falling between the wrestler's thighs down to the mat.\n\nA variation of the piledriver where instead of dropping to a sitting position as in the basic belly-to-back piledriver, the wrestler drops to a kneeling position.\n\nThe cradle piledriver is a variation on standard piledrivers which sees the attacking wrestler grapevine the opponents leg with their arm. The most common of which is similar to a Texas piledriver. This move sees the attacking wrestler, from a position in which the opponent is bent forward against the wrestler's midsection, reach around the opponent's midsection and lifting them so that they are held upside down facing in the same direction as the wrestler, the wrestler then hooks their arms around one leg of the opponent before dropping to a sitting or kneeling position with the opponent's head falling between the wrestler's thighs down to the mat. It is a common finisher move for Minoru Suzuki, known as the \"Gotch-Style Piledriver\".\n\nThis variant can be used on other types of piledrivers; including the cradle tombstone piledriver variation, instead of wrapping both of his arms around the waist of the opponent, the wrestler wraps one arm around the waist and places his other arm between the opponent's legs, grabbing hold of his other arm. The wrestler then drops down on his knees, driving the opponent down to the mat head first.\n\nFrom a position in which the opponent is bent forward against the wrestler's midsection, the attacking wrestler crosses the arms of this opponent between their legs (a double pumphandle) before then lifting the opponent up into a vertical position and driving them down between the attacking wrestler's legs.\n\nAlso known as the \"Tiger Driver '98\". In this piledriver, a wrestler will bend their opponent forward, placing the opponent's head between the wrestler's legs, and hooks each of the opponent's arms behind the opponent's back. They then pull back on the opponent's arms lifting them up so that the opponent is held upside down facing in the same direction as the wrestler, the wrestler then drops to a sitting or kneeling position dropping the opponent's head into the mat. It is currently used by Jay Briscoe as the \"Jay-Driller\" and by Jeremiah Crane as the \"Cranial Contusion.\"\n\nAlso known as the vertebreaker, this move is executed from a position in which the opponent is standing behind the wrestler, the wrestler underhooks their arms under the opponent's arms. Then the wrestler twists their body around so that the wrestler is facing the ground and the opponent is standing with their back resting against the wrestler's back. Then the wrestler stands while the opponent is in an upside down position while both the opponent and the wrestler's arms are still hooked. The wrestler then drops to a sitting position. Another way to get the opponent into the position is to approach a standing opponent from behind, hook the opponent's arms, bend forward under the opponent, and then rise up, raising the opponent upside down.\n\nThis technique is extremely dangerous, possibly one of the most dangerous maneuvers in professional wrestling, as the opponent's arms are restrained and their head is not placed between the wrestler's legs, giving them little to post against. The move was banned by WWE in April 2003, except for in cases where the wrestler received special permission to use the move.\n\nThe move was innovated by Megumi Kudo, dubbing it the \"Kudome Valentine\". It is also used by Homicide who called it \"Da Cop Killa\" when in the independent circuit, and \"Da Gringo Killa\" in TNA. It was most famously used by Gregory Helms who called the move the \"Vertebreaker\". Cody Rhodes uses this as a finishing maneuver on the independent scene calling it \"Din's Fire\".\n\nThe move, made famous by Petey Williams is also referred to as the \"Canadian Destroyer\", \"Destroyer\", or a sunset flip piledriver, begins in a position in which the opponent is bent forward against the wrestler's midsection, the wrestler grabs around the opponent's midsection latching onto the opponent's back, with their head to one side of the opponent's hips or between their legs, keeping their legs around the opponent's head. From this position the wrestler pushes off the mat with their legs to flip the opponent over. As both wrestlers flip, the attacking wrestler uses their body weight to land in a seated position driving the opponent's head down to the mat between the wrestler's thighs. A double underhook variation exists in which the arms of a bent over opponent are placed in a butterfly prior to performing the flip. There is a diving variation, Adam Cole uses this move calling it the \"Panama Sunrise\".\n\nAlso known as a spike piledriver or stiff piledriver and is performed in the same way as a basic piledriver, however the wrestler will jump in the air before dropping down to the sitting position for more impact.\n\nA package piledriver is almost the same as a basic belly-to-back piledriver, but instead of grabbing the waist of the opponent, the wrestler puts their arms underneath the opponent's arms and grabs their legs by the knees. The wrestler then stands up, lifting the opponent until they are upside down, and drops to a sitting position with the opponent's head between their thighs.\n\nThere is also an inverted version of the move in which an attacking wrestler reaches between an opponent's legs with one arm and reaches around that opponent's back from the same side with his other arm before lifting their opponent upside down into a belly-to-belly position. The attacker then grabs the opponent's legs by the knees, jumps up, then drops to a sitting position with the opponent's head between their thighs. \nAja Kong Innovated the move. This move was popularized by Kevin Owens during his time on the independent circuit. It is currently used by Pentagon Jr. as his finisher.\n\nAlso known as a stump piledriver, this is a variation of piledriver where, instead of wrapping their arms around the opponent's waist, a wrestler grabs onto the back of the waistband of an opponent's tights to lift them upside down before dropping into a sitting position. Sami Callihan has named his version the \"Cactus Driver\" in honor of Cactus Jack, after Mick Foley (who popularized the move) expressed his approval of Callahan's move on Twitter.\n\nAlso known as a belly-to-belly piledriver, a wrestler faces an opponent and grabs the opponent's waist and turns them upside-down, holding them belly-to-belly against their torso. The wrestler then jumps up and drops down to a seated position, driving the opponent's head down to the mat between the wrestler's thighs.\n\nOften referred to as a Tombstone Piledriver. The wrestler first stands facing an opponent and places their stronger arm between the opponent's legs and their weaker arm on the opponent's opposite shoulder. And then lift the opponent onto their stronger shoulder, turning them upside-down similar to a scoop slam lift. The opponent is then lowered while being held so that the opponent's head is hanging between the standing wrestler's knees. The wrestler then falls or jumps to his knees, driving the opponent's head into the mat. The move was innovated by Karl Gotch, but was popularized by The Undertaker and was later used by his (kayfabe) brother Kane. Other famous practitioners include Dynamite Kid, Satoru Sayama and Don Muraco.\n\nThis variation sees an attacking wrestler first lock an opponent in the pumphandle hold before then using the hold to raise the opponent up over the shoulder of the attacking wrestler. From here the attacking wrestler brings the opponent down into the belly-to-belly position before then sitting down for a reverse piledriver with the opponent's head impacting the mat between the legs of the attacking wrestler. This move was used as a finisher by Tony Nese.\n\nSimilar to the kneeling reverse piledriver but instead of dropping their opponent to a kneeling position. The wrestler first stands facing an opponent and places their stronger arm between the opponent's legs and their weaker arm on the opponent's opposite shoulder. And then lift the opponent onto their stronger shoulder, turning them upside-down similar to a scoop slam lift. The opponent is then lowered while being held so that the opponent's head is hanging between the standing wrestler's knees. The wrestler then drops to a sitting position, driving the opponent's head into the mat. The move was first used by Owen Hart.\n\nFacing his opponent, the wrestler reaches between their opponent's legs with their right arm and reaches around the opponent's neck from the same side with their left arm. They then lift the opponent up on their chest so that they are facing downwards. The wrestler then moves their left arm from around the opponent's neck to around the opponent's torso. They then turn the opponent so that they are upside down on one side of the wrestler. The wrestler then jumps up and falls down to a sitting position, driving the opponent down to the mat neck and shoulder first. The move was popularized by Hayabusa, who called it \"H Thunder\".\n\nFacing their opponent, the wrestler reaches between his opponent's legs with their right arm and reaches around the opponent's neck from the same side with their left arm. They then lift the opponent up and turn them around so that they are held upside down, as in a scoop slam. The wrestler then drops down to their knees, driving the opponent down to the mat neck and shoulder first. There is also a seated version of this move.\n\nThe wrestler stands behind the opponent, applies an inverted facelock, lifts them upside down, and then drops down to a sitting position, driving the opponent down to the mat between the wrestler's legs upper back first. The move was also used by Vampiro with the name \"Nail in the Coffin\".\n\nFacing their opponent, the wrestler reaches between his opponent's legs with their right arm and reaches around the opponent's neck from the same side with their left arm. They then lift the opponent up and turn them around so that they are held upside down, as in a scoop slam before dropping down into a sitout position, driving the opponent down to the mat neck and shoulder first. The move was innovated by Taka Michinoku.\n\nThe wrestler applies a front facelock to the opponent and hooks the opponent's near arm over their shoulder and lifts them into a vertical suplex position. They then turn the opponent 180°, force the opponent into the reverse piledriver position, then drop to a sitting position, dropping the opponent on their head. This move was first used by Jushin Thunder Liger on Ultimo Dragon, then the move became popular through use by Scott Steiner, who called it the \"Steiner Screwdriver\". It's also used by Brian Cage who calls it the \"Drill Claw\".\n\nSimilar to the wheelbarrow facebuster but instead of dropping their opponent face first, they drop their opponent so that the opponent lands on their upper back and neck between the legs of the wrestler, facing towards them usually resulting in a pin.\n\n"}

Founded in 1925 and named after the mountain located just north of the city, the club's home ground is the 8,550-seater Stadion Police.\n\nThey currently play in the Second League of the Republika Srpska (Group East), a third-tier competition in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nFounded in 1925, Leotar was a member of the First League of the Republika Srpska after the 1992–95 Bosnian War, winning its final season before integration in the 2001–02 season. In its first season in the Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Leotar won its only national championship and qualified for the UEFA Champions League.\n\nFounded in 1925 in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, the club served as a training ground for many players who went on to enjoy notable careers elsewhere. Leotar never managed to gain promotion to the Yugoslav First League.\n\nLeotar entered the first-ever season of the First League of Republika Srpska in 1995–96, playing in the Eastern Group and failing to reach the play-offs.

{"id": "1940350", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1940350", "title": "Powerbomb", "text": "Powerbomb\n\nA powerbomb is a professional wrestling throw in which an opponent is lifted (usually so that they are sitting on the wrestler's shoulders) and then slammed back-first down to the mat. The standard powerbomb sees an opponent first placed in a standing headscissors position (bent forward with their head placed between the attacking wrestler's thighs). He is then lifted on the wrestler's shoulders and slammed down back-first to the mat. A prawn hold is commonly used for a pinning powerbomb.\n\nPowerbombs are sometimes used in mixed martial arts competitions, when a fighter attempts to slam another fighter who has him trapped in a triangle choke. In professional wrestling, it is also sometimes used by a bigger wrestler as a counter to an attempted hurricanrana by a smaller wrestler. While it was associated with super-heavyweight wrestlers, the move was invented by Lou Thesz.\n\nThe wrestler first places their opponent face-up across their shoulders, as in an Argentine backbreaker rack, hooks the head with one hand and a leg with the other, and the wrestler will then spin the opponent's head away from them, dropping the opponent down to the mat. Often the wrestler drops to a seated position while spinning the opponent. It was popularized by A.J. Styles with the name \"Rack Bomb\".\n\nAlso known as a sitout two-handed chokeslam and a choke driver. The most common move referred to as a chokebomb sees an attacking wrestler grasps an opponent's neck with both hands and then lift them up into the air. From here the attacking wrestler would throw the opponent back down to the mat while falling to a seated position. This would see the opponent land in a position where their legs are wrapped around the wrestler with their back and shoulders on the mat. This allows the attacking wrestler to lean forward and place both his/her arms on the opponent for a pinfall attempt. A falling version exists, and usually ends with the attacking wrestler pinning the opponent immediately while still holding the throat after the move has already been executed. This move was used as a finisher by Matt Bloom in all of his WWE personas.\n\nThe wrestler places his opponents head in between his legs then grabs the opponents stomach and lifts his opponent over his shoulder and holds both his arms in a cross position over his head. The wrestler finally runs or falls to his/her knees and throws his opponent onto the mat back/neck first. Sheamus employs the running variation, dubbing it the \"High Cross\". The falling variation is often associated with Razor Ramon, who called it \"Razor's Edge\" (also known as the Outsider's Edge or Diamonds Edge during his time in WCW as Scott Hall). While the throwing variation is used by Bad Luck Fale as the \"Bad Luck Fall\".\n\nAlso known as a \"Niagara Bomb\", \"Splash Mountain\" and \"Black Tiger Bomb\", this powerbomb is similar to the Crucifix Powerbomb, but instead of the wrestler falling forward to drop the opponent, the attacking wrestler falls to a seated position for a pinfall attempt instead of releasing the opponent. This move is sometimes used by Roman Reigns as a signature move and was also commonly performed by Matt Hardy and Eddie Guerrero. A top rope version was used by Konnan as well.\n\nThis move, invented by Masato Tanaka, is performed when the wrestler will put the opponent in to the position for a belly to back suplex, lift them up and then catch them in mid air as if going for a spinebuster but instead put the opponents legs on their shoulders then drives the opponent to the mat like a falling powerbomb.\n\nDue to convenience of wording this name can refer to a maneuver either performed by two persons on one, or one person on two; generally both opponents will be far smaller than the wrestler attempting the move. One opponent is placed on the attackers shoulders as per a standard powerbomb, then the other will be placed on the first opponents shoulders, facing in the same direction. This is normally performed by putting the first opponent's head between the seconds legs while they are sitting on the second or top turnbuckle. Finally, both opponents will be slammed to the mat.\n\nAlso known as a Tiger Bomb. The wrestler faces a bent over opponent, and hooks each of the opponent's arms behind the opponent's back. The wrestler then lifts the opponent in the air and flips them over, throwing them back down and driving the back and shoulders of the opponent to the ground. The wrestler may also fall to their knees as they slam the opponent down. A sitout version is commonly known as a \"Tiger Driver\" and was invented by Mitsuharu Misawa. Ahmed Johnson used the sitout version as well, calling it the \"Pearl River Plunge\". Tyler Bate uses the move as his finishing maneuver, calling it the \"Tyler Driver '97\".\n\nThis move is similar to a standard powerbomb. Instead of slamming the opponent directly on the mat from the shoulders, the attacking wrestler first lifts the opponent even higher by holding onto the opponent and extending their arms up, lifting the opponent up off the shoulders of the attacking wrestler just moments before slamming them down to the mat. This move was used prominently by The Undertaker, who named it the \"Last Ride\". A sitout version is used by Kota Ibushi who calls it the \"Golden Star Powerbomb\".\n\nThis move starts by lifting an opponent like a normal powerbomb, but when the opponent is on the wrestler's shoulders the wrestler falls forward, slamming the opponent onto the ground. This move was popularized by Kane.\n\nThe wrestler lifts the opponent on to his shoulders, into the fireman's carry position. The wrestler grabs hold of the opponent's near leg with one hand, and his head with the other. He then pushes the opponent's upper body up and simultaneously spins them, causing them to end up in front of the wrestler face up. The wrestler then either sits down or stays standing. He may also wrap his hands around the opponent's upper legs.\n\nTranslated literally from Japanese as Originator Bomb (元祖 \"ganso\") but in English more commonly referred to as the original powerbomb, this move sees the attacking wrestler make an opponent bend over and grab them in a belly to back waistlock before then lifting the opponent until they are vertical. The attacking wrestler then drives the opponent down on their neck and shoulder while either remaining in a standing position, sitting position or dropping down to their knees. The move is considered one of the most dangerous moves in professional wrestling as the person taking the move is in freefall, dropped onto their own head or neck without protection. It was invented by Lou Thesz. Toshiaki Kawada used this move as the \"Kawada Driver\", while AJ Styles also used it during his tenure with NJPW as the \"Hollow Point\".\n\nThis move involves a wrestler standing over a bent over opponent, locking their arms around the opponent's waist and lifting them up, flipping them over, and slamming them down to the mat back first. The difference compared to a regular powerbomb is that the opponent's head does not go between the wrestler's thighs, instead they remain slightly in front or to the side of the wrestler. Usually the wrestler finishes in a sitting position while slamming the opponent, but a falling version also exists. It was used by Jack Swagger as a finishing move. Most famously used by \"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams as the Doctor Bomb throughout his career.\n\nAlso known as an Inverted front powerslam, this move sees the attacking wrestler faces a bent-over opponent and apply a gutwrench waistlock before lifting the opponent up so they are lying across the wrestler's shoulder, facing upward, with the wrestler maintaining the waistlock to hold them in position, known as an overhead gutwrench backbreaker rack. The wrestler then falls forward, standing or into a sitout position while flipping the opponent forward, driving the opponent horizontally belly-down into the ground. A double underhook version of this move also exists. Ron Simmons made the standing variation famous, calling it the \"Dominator\", while Yujiro Takahashi popularized the sitout version, calling it \"Tokyo Pimps\".\n\nA normal powerbomb which is ended with the wrestler flipping or rolling forward into a bridge with a jackknife hold. Not to be confused with Kevin Nash's finisher, referred to as the \"Jackknife Powerbomb\" but is actually a release powerbomb.\n\nThis variation of a powerbomb is similar to an ordinary powerbomb, however, instead of the wrestler remaining standing, the wrestler falls into a kneeling position while driving the opponent back-first into the mat. Kane has used this version of the Powerbomb\n\nAs the name implies, the wrestler performing the move will do so multiple times. To start, he will lift his opponent into powerbomb position and perform the move. Without letting go of the opponent's waist, the wrestler raises him up again and drops him. Depending on the wrestler, he may continue to repeat the process at his own discretion and may pin the opponent after the last one. Although neither wrestler does this anymore, Chris Jericho and Brock Lesnar used the multiple powerbomb as a signature maneuver when they debuted in WWE; Jericho's version was a double powerbomb and Lesnar's a triple.\n\nAs the name implies, this move begins with the opponent rushing towards the attacker who then flings the opponent vertically up into the air. The move is finished by catching the opponent and performing a powerbomb. This move was popularized by Kevin Owens and Scott Steiner. A sitout version is also possible, which is used by Keith Lee as the \"Spirit Bomb\".\n\nA variation of the powerbomb where the opponent is lifted into the air and then dropped without being forced into a pin. Kevin Nash, Big Van Vader, Bubba Ray Dudley, Chris Benoit, Sycho Sid, Lita, Sara Del Rey and John Bradshaw Layfield use this move and it was also famously used by Sable as the \"Sable Bomb\".\n\nThe wrestler takes hold of an opponent, who is lying on the mat, by their legs. The opponent then grabs hold of one of the ropes with both hands as the wrestler pulls them backwards, lifting them off the mat. At this point the opponent releases their grip on the rope and is brought down to the mat.\n\nThe opponent begins sitting in the corner of the ring and facing outwards, while holding on to the ring ropes. The wrestler takes hold of the opponent by the legs and pulls them upwards and backwards with a twist, falling into a sitting position as they do so. The move ends with the opponent's back on the ground and their legs over the shoulders of the wrestler, placing the opponent in a pinning predicament.\n\nIn this variation of the Powerbomb, the wrestler runs before he releases his opponent. A wrestler may also sit down for a pinfall attempt.\n\nIn this variation of a powerbomb an opponent is first scooped so they are horizontal across an attacking wrestler's chest. The wrestler then pushes the opponent up and turns them, so that they are sitting on the shoulders of the wrestler, before then slamming them down in a powerbomb motion. A seated version is also possible. This maneuver was occasionally performed by \"The Alpha Male\" Monty Brown and was referred to as the Alpha Bomb.\n\nIn this variation of a powerbomb, the attacking wrestler falls to a seated position as he slams the opponent down. Some wrestlers remain in seated position to pin the opponent, while others choose not to. The move can either be performed as a standard powerbomb or as a gutwrench powerbomb. The move was popularized by Jushin Liger, who used it as a finisher, known as the \"Liger Bomb\", and was also famously used by Batista as the \"Batista Bomb\".\n\nFrom a position in which the opponent is sitting across the wrestlers shoulder, the attacker bounces the opponent's back across the top rope. The attacker then spins around, using the momentum to powerbomb the opponent.\n\nAlso called a spiral bomb. The wrestler lifts the opponent up onto his shoulders and spins around several rotations before sitting down and slamming the opponent down to the mat, as in a sitout powerbomb. A release variation sees the wrestler remain standing or kneeling and just throwing his opponent away from them onto their back to the mat. A gutwrench variation is also possible, with the wrestler dropping the opponent as in a normal gutwrench powerbomb. This maneuver was used by DDP but the sitout variation was popularized by Michael Elgin, who adopted it as his finisher.\n\nAlso known as a Blue Thunder Driver or a Blue Thunder Bomb, this is a belly-to-back powerbomb, usually beginning in the back suplex position in which the wrestler stands behind their opponent and puts their head under the arm of the opponent. They then lift the opponent up using one arm around the waist of the opponent and another under their legs. The wrestler then spins the opponent around 180°, dropping them to the mat back first as they drop to a sitting position. Invented by Jun Akiyama, it is used by Sami Zayn as a finishing move. Apollo Crews uses a toss variation of the move. John Cena uses a kneeling variation of the move.\n\nThis move sees the wrestler bend over and place their opponent in a standing head scissors. However, the wrestler moves forward slightly so the opponent's midsection is between the wrestler's thighs instead of their head. The wrestler wraps their arms around the opponent's midsection in a waistlock, then jumps and rolls forward, under the opponent's legs, and into a seated position, forcing the opponent to fall back to the mat. The resulting position can lead to a sitout pin.\nThis is often called a \" Yoshi Tonic \" in Japan. The top rope version is also used sometimes, as seen in the picture above. The move is also very dangerous, because when the wrestler flips over his/her opponents back, if they put too much downward force on their legs, it could result in a leg injury. Seth Rollins was injured while attempting to perform a sunset flip powerbomb by applying too much downward force on his leg, thus injuring it.\n\nThe attacking wrestler forces the opponent to ascend to the top rope, standing usually on the top ropes with their legs spread. The wrestler then bends the opponent, placing their head between the wrestler's thighs. The wrestler then wraps their hands around the opponent's waist. The wrestler then lifts the opponent up, flipping them over, while jumping forward. The opponent falls down to the mat back first, and the wrestler usually falls to their knees or to a sitting position. This variation was popularized by Chris Candido as the \"Blonde Bombshell\".\n\nAnother variation sees the opponent sitting on the top rope. The wrestler climbs up to the top rope and stands facing the opponent. The wrestler then bends the opponent over and takes hold of opponent around the waist. The wrestler then flips the opponent up and over so they are sitting on the shoulders of the wrestler. At the same time, the wrestler spins around 180° and leaps forward, falling to the ground in a standing or sitting position and driving the opponent's back and shoulders to the mat.\n\nAnother variant of the Superbomb was popularized by B.J. Whitmer, who used the move to toss himself and fellow wrestler Jimmy Jacobs into a crowd at a Ring of Honor show in June 2006.\n\nThe wrestler faces a bent opponent and places him in the standing headscissors position (bent forward with their head placed between the wrestler's thighs). The wrestler then grabs hold around the opponent's upper torso or waist, and lifts him on top of one of the wrestler's shoulders on his back. The wrestler then bends forward and slams the opponent down to the mat on his back or shoulders. It is also known as an over-the-shoulder powerbomb.\n\nA powerbomb performed by three wrestlers. Two wrestlers lift an opponent with a belly-to-back hold and place his legs on the third partner's shoulders, who executes the powerbomb while the other two push the opponent from the carrying partner's shoulders. There's also an avalanche variation of this move performed from the middle rope. This was popularized specifically by The Shield in WWE.\n\nThe wrestler faces a standing opponent, bends them forwards, takes a hold around their waist and then flips the opponent up and over so the opponent is sitting on the wrestler's shoulders. The wrestler then faces a corner of the ring and throws the opponent into the corner, driving the back and neck of the opponent to the turnbuckle. The move was famously used by Kenta Kobashi. The move is currently used by Seth Rollins as a signature. This move is also called \"Buckle Bomb\"\n\nThe wrestler lifts the opponent upside down as in a vertical suplex and then pushes their upper body forward while sitting down, ending the move in the same position as the sitout powerbomb. A fall-forward and standing versions are also possible. The move was invented by Kenta Kobashi who called it \"Orange Crush\".\n"}
{"id": "1940360", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1940360", "title": "FK Slavija Sarajevo", "text": "FK Slavija Sarajevo\n\nFudbalski klub Slavija Sarajevo (Serbian Cyrillic: Фудбалски клуб Славија Сарајево) is a professional association football club from the city of Istočno Sarajevo, Republika Srpska that is situated in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Slavija Sarajevo is a member of the Football Association of Republika Srpska and the Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina and it is active in the First League of the Republika Srpska. The club's home stadium is Gradski SRC Slavija Stadium, which has a capacity of 6,000 seats.\n\nDominantly the club of Serbs, Slavija was by far the most successful club from Bosnia and Herzegovina during the interbellum, having played 11 top league seasons (out of possible 16) in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The only other Bosnia-based club that made it to top national level was Croat-dominated SAŠK (six seasons).\n\nFounded in Sarajevo during 1908 when the city was part of Austria-Hungary, the football club was part of the wider sports society of Sarajevo gymnasium students informally known as Đački sportski klub (ĐSK) or Srednjoškolski sportski klub (SSK). Since cultural and social activities in the city in those days mostly revolved around Hotel Evropa and the gymnasium, the idea of establishing a sporting club was initiated on those premises. Some of the students earlier that year visited Zagreb, where they got introduced to the game of football, bringing back the first ball to Sarajevo. Notable individuals who organized club activities in this early period were students Zdravko Jeftanović (son of the Hotel Evropa owner dr. Dušan Jeftanović), Feodor Lukač, Emil Najšul, Sveto Gerovac, Stevo Jokanović, etc. Their early activities were very sporadic and basically clandestine as Austro-Hungarian occupational authorities that just annexed Bosnia instituted a ban on any kind of organized gathering.\n\nIn early 1909, the football section got its first pairs of boots and started holding regular practices and training sessions at Sarajevo Polje grounds, more precisely the military workout open facility known as Egzercir in the Čengić vila area. Since the open field didn't have any goalposts, the students had to haul them in on foot from the city for every practice and match. ĐSK/SSK also informally took red and white as club colours after Slavia Prague, the club that served as inspiration for Slavs throughout Austria-Hungary. Austrian international striker, Karl Harmer, came from Vienna to become the team's first manager.\n\nIt wasn't until 1911 that ĐSK played its debut match, defeating a selection of Vienna soldiers 4–2.\n\nThroughout 1912, ĐSK played friendlies in parts of Austria-Hungary populated by South Slavs. First such trip outside of Sarajevo was to the city of Split where ĐSK played local side Hajduk. The first match took place on 7 April 1912 and Hajduk won, 4–1. A day later on 8 April, the teams played another match with ĐSK winning this time, 2–1. Curiosity from the Split visit was that posters announcing the two matches around the city billed ĐSK as \"Osman\" for non-specified reasons. This probably stemmed from the fact that \"ĐSK\" as club name was informally used even amongst its players so the Split hosts decided to make up a name for their guests' club on the spot. They seemingly found the male Muslim name Osman to be sufficiently funny and decided to print it on the posters as the club's official name.\n\nFrom the fall of 1912 as the first of eventually two Balkan Wars started raging nearby, just beyond the Austria-Hungary's eastern borders, ĐSK naturally began fostering Pan-Slavic sentiment, and especially the Yugoslav idea (unification of South Slavs), even harder as national and political aspects of club's activities came to the forefront. While the Balkan League member states (Serbia, Greece, Bulgaria, and Montenegro) were getting rid of the last remains of Ottoman influence, Slavs within the borders of Austria-Hungary were restless to make some dents in the armour of their own occupiers – the Austro-Hungarian empire. By mid-1913, the Balkan Wars were over with a resounding victory for Slavs (Serbs and Montenegrins) across the border on the other side of river Drina. This had an enormously encouraging effect on Slavs (especially Serbs) in Bosnia. Austro-Hungarian authorities were not oblivious to such developments and their repression got stepped up even further. All of this led to increased tensions and boiling pot atmosphere in the city of Sarajevo.\n\nDuring the second part of 1913, an ethnic split occurred within the ĐSK organization as a certain number of members (all of them ethnic Croats) left ĐSK to form Hrvatski sportski klub, which later became SAŠK. However, most others stayed at the club and soon changed the ĐSK's name to Srpski sportski klub (SSK). The freshly renamed entity attempted to make its existence public and official, and to that end enlisted its connections through Dušan Jeftanović, a prominent local industrialist and landowner, and Jovo Šošić. However, Austro-Hungarian authorities wouldn't give an inch—the ban on organized gathering stayed firmly in place. The difficult situation that the club found itself in made its members pull together even harder and by the end of 1913 they built a home ground located at Čurčić Vila in Koševo neighbourhood. However, they wouldn't get to enjoy their new home for long.\n\nThe assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand by Gavrilo Princip in June 1914 set off a chain of events such as the Austrian July Ultimatum to Serbia, the subsequent Austro-Hungarian declaration of war on Serbia and the eventual outbreak of World War I. The position of Serbs in Bosnia became increasingly difficult. SSK members were no exception as many of them got arrested or forcibly conscripted to fight in the Austro-Hungarian Army. The newly built ground at Čurčić Vila got ransacked and burned by an angry mob of Croats and Bosniaks.\n\nFootball quickly became an afterthought and SSK was completely inactive all throughout World War I. After the end of war and the creation of Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, SSK reactivated in 1919.\n\nIn 1921, SSK changed its name to SK Slavija and competed in the top level of the Sarajevo Subassociation. Over the next few years Slavija built a 4,000-capacity stadium in Marijin Dvor area of Sarajevo. In line with its student background the club devoted its potential to developing young players.\n\nSlavija's first appearance in the Kingdom's top football competition took place in 1924. It featured only seven clubs and was played in cup system. Slavija didn't had luck cause they got as opponents in the quarterfinal Belgrade's SK Jugoslavija, which crashed them 2–5 and later became champions that season.\n\nThe 1930 season saw the return to top flight that now featured six clubs and was played in league system. Slavija finished the season in 5th place with 2 wins, 2 draws, and 6 losses, all of which wasn't enough to avoid the drop.\n\nNext chance for top flight football came in 1932–33 season. By then the competition changed format once more as it was now played in fall-spring league rhythm and expanded to 11 clubs. Slavija finished 9th in the league with 7 wins, 2 draws, and 11 losses, which was just enough to stay afloat.\n\nFootball was not played in Kingdom of Yugoslavia during 1933–34 season, so the next opportunity came in 1934–35. The league now featured 10 teams, and Slavija again barely avoided relegation, finishing third from the bottom with 7 wins, 1 draw, and 10 losses.\n\nThe 1935–36 season finally provided a much sought breakthrough for Slavija as the club came within a hair of becoming the champion of Yugoslavia. The top league now featured 14 clubs, most ever in its history up to that point. Another change was that the home-and-away cup system was brought back. Led by Milan Rajlić and Slavko Zagorac on the pitch, and Risto Šošić from the bench, Slavija first came up against Cetinje's Crnogorac, beating them 5–4 on aggregate. Next up was Građanski from Skopje in the quarter-finals – after losing the first game 1–2, Slavija recorded a famous 10–1 win in the return leg. This momentum carried into the semi-finals against Novi Sad's NAK as Slavija progressed 4–2 on aggregate. That set the stage for the famous two-legged final against the powerhouse BSK team. First leg finished 1–1, but BSK prevailed 0–1 in return.\n\nThe competition for the 1936–37 returned to 10 clubs and league system. Encouraged by their previous season's historic runner-up success, Slavija entered the new campaign with high hopes. They were soon dashed, however, as the club recorded 7 wins, 3 draws, and 8 losses, which was enough for a mid-table 5th-place finish.\n\nThe next season was virtually identical with 7 wins, 4 draws, and 7 losses that again translated to 5th place in the table. A small consolation was that this was the first time season played in the league system that Slavija didn't have more losses than wins.\n\nIn 1940, the club participated at the 1940 Mitropa Cup which ended up abandoned due to the beginning of the war. Slavija lost in the quarter-finals to Ferencvaros in a dramatic 11–1 comeback from the Hungarians in Budapest, after losing to Slavija by 3–0 in Sarajevo in the first round. Slavija was led by the notable Hungarian manager Wilmos Wilhelm.\n\nOnce again just like in World War I, following the Nazi Germany invasion of Kingdom of Yugoslavia the club was inactive until the end of World War II in the Balkans. After the war, SK Slavija was disbanded without any explanation by the new communist authorities. Its stadium at Marijin Dvor was renamed \"Šesti april\" and used for home matches of FK Željezničar and newly formed SD Torpedo. The stadium was eventually torn down while its stands and bleachers were given to FK Željezničar for use in their Grbavica ground that was under construction.\n\nIn 1993, after the break-up of SFR Yugoslavia and the formation of the Football Association of Republika Srpska, FK Slavija was re-formed. In 1996, because of its pre-war tradition, it was decided that the club would become part of the newly formed First League of Republika Srpska. Slavija finished eighth at the end of the season; however, because of the restructuring of the league system, they would compete in the Second League of Republika Srpska for the following seasons, returning in 2000. In that season, Slavija won the 1999–00 Second League of RS unbeatable, with 19 wins and 2 draws, and a 73–6 goal difference. Slavija played in the First League of RS until 2004 when they became league champions and earned promotion to the Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 2004, the club reached the semi-finals of the Bosnian Cup for the third time. Since then, the club has become a regular participant in the Premier League, having in between celebrated its centennial in 2008.\n\nThe organized supporters of the club are known as Sokolovi (The Falcons).\n\n\n\n Captain\n\nThese players played in the club and have played in national teams:\n\nPre-1945 period:\n\nPost-1945 period:\n\n"}

It is the seat of Kolno County, and the seat of the smaller administrative district (gmina) called Gmina Kolno, but it is not part of this district, as the town has gmina status in its own right. Kolno has 10,730 inhabitants (2007).\n\nKolno was first mentioned in 1222. The town first belonged to the Masovian Dukes, and then to the Polish crown. Kolno received city rights from Prince Janusz III of Masovia in 1425. The major economic expansion took place in the 16th century, with more trade and crafts. Kolno was destroyed by fire during the Kościuszko Uprising (1794). After the Partitions of Poland (1795) it became part of Prussia, till 1807, and subsequently, part of Duchy of Warsaw (Księstwo Warszawskie). From 1815 it belonged to Congress Poland (Królestwo Polskie). Kolno was destroyed again in the First World War, during battle between Russian and German empires. The population of Kolno during the interwar period increased to 5,163 persons, 70% of them Jewish.\n\nPolish historian and cartographer Joachim Lelewel (1786–1861) was the first to gather all available mentions of Jan of Kolno known as Johannes Scolnus, and claimed that Scolvus was really Jan z Kolna (English: John of Kolno), a Polish navigator of the Danish fleet. He also found mentions of a Joannis de Colno who studied at the Kraków Academy in 1455, and a Colno or Cholno family of merchants and sailors living in Gdańsk.\n\nFollowing the Nazi German and Soviet Invasion of Poland in World War II Kolno was taken over by the German forces on 8 September 1939. On 29 September Soviets enter the area in accordance with the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact. The town remained in Soviet hands until Operation Barbarossa (22 June 1941) when it was overrun again by the Wehrmacht.\n\nOn 5 1941 Hermann Göring and Erich Koch visited the town, and some 30 to 37 Jews were murdered by the local Poles. The rest of the Jewish population, some 2,350 to 3,000 Jews, were executed in several stages beginning on 15 July 1941. Six weeks later, only 80 Jews remained in Kolno, mostly craftsmen and artisans whom the Germans employed.\n\nThe Soviet Army liberated Kolno on the night of 23–24 January 1945 and ceded the city back to People's Republic of Poland in accordance with Yalta Conference.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1940382", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1940382", "title": "Nueces massacre", "text": "Nueces massacre\n\nThe Nueces Massacre, also known as the Massacre on the Nueces, was a violent confrontation between Confederate soldiers and German Texans on August 10, 1862, in Kinney County, Texas. Many first-generation immigrants from Germany settled in Central Texas in a region known as the Hill Country. They tended to support the Union and were opposed to the institution of slavery. Because of these sentiments, the Confederate States of America imposed martial law on Central Texas. A group of Germans, fleeing from the Hill Country to Mexico and onward after that to Union-controlled New Orleans, was confronted by a company of Confederate soldiers on the banks of the Nueces River. The ensuing German defeat represented an end to overt German resistance to Confederate governance in Texas, but it also fueled outrage among the German-Texan population. Disputes over the confrontation and the efficacy of Confederate actions after the battle, according to historian Stanley McGowen, continue to plague the Hill Country into the 21st century.\n\nGermans immigrated to Texas as early as 1836. By 1860, the German population in Texas, predominantly first-generation immigrants, reached an approximate level of 20,000 across the entire state. They settled heavily in an area known as the Hill Country. The exact dimensions of Hill Country are not concrete. Germans settled so heavily in this area, that the counties of Gillespie, Kerr, Kendall, Medina, and Bexar comprised a \"German Belt\".\n\nDuring the antebellum period, Germans displayed a complex set of opinions on slavery and secession. There were several Germans who owned slaves, and some eventually supported Texas secession from the United States. Most Germans, however were apathetic to slavery. A vocal minority of Germans was actively antagonistic to the institution of slavery. These antagonistic Germans included liberal and republican-minded Germans known as \"Achtundvierziger\" or Forty-Eighters. Many Forty-Eighters remained loyal to the United States and several opposed slavery. Most secessionist Anglo-Texans found this to be an affront to their insurrection against the US. German opposition to slavery led to an animosity between the two groups throughout the 1850s. These disputes were magnified by Texas' secession from the United States in March 1861, and the start of the American Civil War on April 12, 1861.\n\nUpon the commencement of the war, Germans projected an outward appearance of passivity toward the conflict. Confederate officials, however, saw the German population as an internal threat. The most adamant supporters of the Union were Tejanos and the German Texans both from Central Texas and the counties of the Texas Hill Country. They had some evidence for that suspicion. During the statewide vote on secession, German-heavy counties represented many of those, along with the Abolitionist northeast part of the state, to garner a majority vote against secession. Several reports in the beginning of 1862 even alleged that German communities celebrated Union victories. The state government also feared German-run local militias.\n\nThe Union Loyal League, organized by several Forty-Eighters, was one such militia. The actual purpose of the league is still a debated issue. Historians Robert Shook and Stanley McGowen acknowledge, as German Texans maintained at the time, that the group's expressed purpose was to defend the Hill Country from Indians and outlaws. Confederates, they confirm, considered the Union Loyal League the enforcement arm of German-Unionist sentiment. Confederate officers even implicated the organization in strategies to free Union soldiers from Camp Verde.\n\nWith a need for more soldiers, the Confederacy established a draft. The Germans did not want to fight against the Union and objected to being drafted. Buildup to this event began in the spring of 1862 with the initiation of a Confederate conscription for Texans, to which many German Texans voiced their objection. The Confederate Conscription Act of 1862 turned general German objection into open opposition. Because of this opposition, General Hamilton Bee dispatched Captain James Duff to Gillespie County. In late May 1862, Captain Duff imposed martial law. While in Gillespie County, Captain Duff arrested and executed two Germans. The harsh conduct convinced several Germans to leave Texas. Frederick \"Fritz\" Tegener and his Union Loyal League associates planned a departure. Their goal was to enter Mexico, and then to make their way to Union-controlled New Orleans.\n\nBetween August 1, and August 3, 1862, sixty-one German Texans, led by Fritz Tegener, departed from Turtle Creek headed southwest for the Mexican border. Informed of their intentions, Captain Duff dispatched Lieutenant Colin McRae with approximately 96 men in pursuit on August 3, 1862. After six days, Lieutenant McRae and his men spied the German Texans in a small prairie along the Nueces River on August 9. Lieutenant McRae then formulated an attack plan to commence later in the evening. He divided his force into two companies to surround the camp. At approximately 1:00 a.m. on August 10, 1862, the Confederates closed into the camp. At first, however, even surprise and planning did not favor the Confederates. Two Germans wandering from the camp encountered the force. The Confederates fired on these two Germans, which alerted the camp to the assault. Thus alerted, the Germans beat back the first Confederate charge. Several Germans, however, were disheartened by the Confederate presence, and fled the field. Numbers vary, but Stanley McGowen estimates that twenty-three to twenty-eight Germans fled throughout the early morning hours. This reduced the German contingent by over a third. A second charge closer to dawn routed the Germans and led to the flight (at least five Germans fled near the end of the battle, including Tegener), serious incapacitation, or death of all German combatants.\n\nThe Confederate losses, out of the 96-man force, counted two soldiers dead and eighteen wounded, including Lieutenant McRae. Reports on the casualties for the vanquished Germans were sparse and inconclusive. In 1962, historian Robert Shook tallied the German casualties at thirty killed and twenty wounded. A more recent conclusion in 2003, made by historian Randolph Campbell, is that 19 Germans died outright in the assaults on the camp. That, however, was not the final tally for the German Texans' losses. Following the battle, Confederate soldiers killed nine badly-wounded Germans outright; cavalrymen pursued nine more to the Rio Grande where they likewise killed the fleeing Germans. The total German casualty report then comes to approximately thirty-seven killed and unknown totals for wounded among those who fled and survived.\n\nSeveral Germans did survive the engagement and ensuing manhunt. These combatants either hid out in Texas, fled to Mexico and California, or eventually joined Union forces in New Orleans as member of the Union First Texas Cavalry. More importantly, however, was how the incident affected the German community in Texas for the rest of the war. Though Confederate actions met with some ire and loud objections from other German Texans, the incident marked the general end to overt German Unionism in Texas for the remainder of the war.\n\nUpon cessation of hostilities in 1865, Germans emerged as some of the most exuberant celebrants of the Union's victory. The German-language Treue der Union Monument (loyalty to the Union), in Comfort, Texas, was dedicated on August 10, 1866, to commemorate those who died at the 1862 Nueces massacre. With the exception of those drowned in the Rio Grande, the remains of the deceased are buried at the site of the monument. It was the only monument to unionism dedicated by locals in former Confederate territory.\n\nOne title for the incident, the \"Battle of Nueces\" or the \"Nueces Massacre\", has been a contested issue since the engagement itself. Recently, historian Stanley McGowen has addressed both sides of the debate. He recognizes that the Germans were, judging by their ability to repulse a superior force, well-armed. Furthermore, they were actively supporting what was at the time an enemy cause. The initial engagement, he affirms, can be called the Battle of the Nueces. But the execution of Germans following the battle, he states, lends credence to the title Nueces Massacre. No name has garnered definitive support, and McGowen admits the debate on Confederate and German actions still goes on among descendants on both sides of the incident.\n\n\n\n"}

He is best known for playing the fourteen-year-old Tadzio in Luchino Visconti's 1971 film adaptation of the 1912 Thomas Mann novella \"Death in Venice\".\n\nAs a student Andrésen attended the Adolf Fredrik's Music School in Stockholm.\n\nAndrésen had only appeared in one film, \"En kärlekshistoria\" (1970) at the time he was cast in \"Death in Venice\", which gained him international recognition. While the film performed relatively poorly at the box office, Andrésen was noted for his performance as Tadzio, the beautiful young Polish boy with whom the film's older protagonist Gustav von Aschenbach (played by Dirk Bogarde) becomes obsessed. Film historian Lawrence J. Quirk commented in his study \"The Great Romantic Films\" (1974) that some shots of Andrésen \"could be extracted from the frame and hung on the walls of the Louvre or the Vatican.\"\n\nRumors circulated in the United States at the time of the film's release as to whether or not Andrésen was homosexual (as the role demanded that he appear to exchange romantic glances with the protagonist, and on another occasion, be kissed and caressed by another teenage boy). Andrésen emphatically denied these, and later recounted his discomfort at being forced by director Luchino Visconti during filming to visit a gay bar, where he attracted the attention of a number of older men.\n\nEager to dispel the rumors regarding his sexuality and to shed his \"pretty boy\" image, Andrésen thereafter avoided homosexual roles and parts which he felt would play off of his good looks, and was angry when feminist writer Germaine Greer used a photograph of him on the cover of her book \"The Beautiful Boy\" (2003) without his permission. Although Greer did consult photographer David Bailey (who owned the copyright for the image) before publishing the book, Andrésen maintained that it is common practice when a party uses an image of a person which has been copyrighted by a different individual to inform the individual and that he would not have given his consent for Greer to use his picture if she had informed him of her plans.\n\nAfter the release of \"Death in Venice\", Andrésen spent an extended period of time in Japan, where the film became popular, and he appeared in a number of television commercials and also recorded several pop songs. It is said that his appearance as Tadzio in the film influenced many Japanese anime artists (known for their depictions of young, effeminate men known as \"Bishōnen\"), especially Keiko Takemiya. Andrésen has had a strong liking for Japan since then and has visited the country again over the years. \n\nAndrésen has appeared in several other films. These include \"Smugglarkungen\" (1985), \"Kojan\" (1992), \"Pelikaanimies\" (2004), and \"Midsommar\" (2019).\n\nIn addition to being an actor, Andrésen is a professional musician, and until recently performed and toured regularly with the Sven Erics dance band.\n\nAndrésen resides in Stockholm with his wife, poet Suzanna, and their daughter Robine. The couple had another child, a boy (their first child), who died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome in 1986, which caused the couple's temporary separation.\n\n\n\n"}

It first aired on May 19, 2004, on the UPN network within the United States. Set in the 22nd century, the series follows the adventures of the first Starfleet starship, \"Enterprise\", registration NX-01. Season three of \"Enterprise\" features an ongoing storyline that follows an attack on Earth by aliens called the Xindi, a group of aliens that did not appear in preceding series.\n\nIn this episode, Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) convinces the Xindi-Aquatics to aid him in his fight against the Xindi-Reptilians and Insectoids alliance to prevent Earth's destruction by their superweapon. In the midst of a battle between the two Xindi factions, an away team is sent to rescue Ensign Hoshi Sato (Linda Park), previously captured by the Reptilians. However, the superweapon departs for Earth, with Archer in pursuit on board a Xindi vessel.\n\n\"Countdown\" was the first collaboration between writers André Bormanis and Chris Black, and was directed by former \"\" actor Robert Duncan McNeill. It was shot over eight days, with additional sets built for the Xindi-Reptilian vessel and the interior of the superweapon. Critics praised the change in the dynamic between Major Hayes (Steven Culp) and Malcolm Reed (Dominic Keating). Roughly 3.5 million viewers watched \"Countdown\" on its first broadcast.\n\nNeeding a third species' codes in order to arm the weapon, Ensign Hoshi Sato is injected with neural-parasites while she is a prisoner of the Xindi-Reptilians. With the Xindi superweapon about to be armed and time running out, Captain Jonathan Archer tries to persuade the Xindi-Aquatics to help destroy it. Sato's kidnapping, and Archer's promises to shut down the 70-plus known spheres, finally convinces the Aquatics into believing that the Sphere Builders, and not the humans, may indeed represent their true enemy.\n\nA battle between Archer's Xindi fleet and the Reptilian-Insectoid fleet soon breaks out around the superweapon. Locating Sato on board a Reptilian ship, a small squad of MACOs, led by Major Hayes and with the support of Lieutenant Malcolm Reed, transports on board the ship to extract her. With the space battle ongoing, the transporter system is damaged so that only two personnel can beam out at one time. Hayes sends one of his men and Sato out first, and then the rest of the team. Hayes, now alone, is forced to retreat and just as he is beaming out, a Reptilian soldier fires through his chest. Back on board \"Enterprise\", he collapses on the transporter platform, and tells Reed who his MACO successor should be, moments before he dies of heart-failure in Sickbay.\n\nWith the \"threads of time\" turning against them, the Sphere Builders decide to intervene by creating spatial distortions around the weapon. A number of Aquatic ships are destroyed by the distortions, which buys the Reptilians enough time to finally activate the codes. Dolim (Scott MacDonald) has the superweapon enter a vortex and heads for Earth, escorted by two allied ships. Inside one of the vessels, having witnessed the interference of the Guardians, the Insectoid leader begins to doubt the motives of the Reptilians. Since the Reptilians already have the Insectoids' launch code, they dissolve their alliance by destroying the Insectoid's ship. Archer makes a plan to pursue Dolim using Degra's faster spaceship, taking a sickened Sato with his team to guide them through the superweapon.\n\nThis was the first episode written as a combined effort by André Bormanis and Chris Black, although they had both written earlier episodes of the series with Bormanis writing episodes such as \"\" and \"\", while Black wrote \"\" among others. \"Countdown\" also saw the return of \"\" actor Robert Duncan McNeill as director. The episode was his second during season three after previously working on \"\". \"Countdown\" took longer to film than most episodes of \"Enterprise\", having an eight-day shooting timetable versus the normal seven.\n\nAdditional sets were constructed to present the interior of the Xindi-Reptilian ship, and the inside of the superweapon. Two full days of the shoot took place on the Reptilian sets, while a day was spent filming on the superweapon set. The scenes set inside the ships of the Xindi-Aquatics and the Xindi-Insectoids were created in post-production rather than using physical sets. This was in addition to the standing sets, and the Xindi specific sets built initially for previous episodes, such as the interior of Degra's ship, and the \"Avian Residence\" which had both been built for use on-screen in \"\". Scenes involving the Sphere Builders; played by Josette DiCarlo, Mary Mara and Ruth Williamson; were filmed in a combined shoot featuring the scenes from both \"Countdown\" and \"The Council\". Filming concluded on March 4, although B-unit shoots continued on March 8, with McNeil directing once more. This was in addition to further B-unit filming under the direction of Dan Curry for the episode \"E²\" and the start of the work on the season finale, \"\" under Allan Kroeker.\n\nSeveral elements of the props and effects were re-used from previous episodes. The reactor core on the superweapon was a combination of the props previously used as a Romulan mine in \"\" and rings from the \"Enterprise\" gymnasium which had appeared in the episode \"\". The special effect used for the subspace vortexes created by the Sphere Builders had originally been created for the transwarp effect in the \"Voyager\" episode \"Hope and Fear\". The guest stars in \"Countdown\" were recurring from previous episodes, although it would be the final appearance for Steven Culp as Major Hayes. Culp had appeared in the series throughout the third season since \"The Xindi\". During the development of \"\", Culp proposed the backstory for Hayes, which was accepted by the production team. The role was not his first in the \"Star Trek\" franchise however, as he had been cast and filmed for an appearance as Commander Martin Madden for the film \"\". It would have seen him as the replacement for Commander William Riker at the end of the film, but it was cut from the final version.\n\n\"Countdown\" was first aired in the United States on UPN on May 19, 2004. According to Nielsen Media Research, it received a 2.3/4 percent share among adults. This means that it was seen by 2.3 percent of all households, and 4 percent of all of those watching television at the time of the broadcast. It was estimated that \"Countdown\" was watched by 3.5 million viewers. The following episode, \"Zero Hour\", received a 2.7/4 percent rating with the viewer number increased by 400,000. \"Countdown\" won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Visual Effects, after being nominated alongside the previous episode, \"The Council\".\n\nMichelle Erica Green, in her review for TrekNation, said that she saw the Hayes/Reed arc come full circle with the death of Hayes and the return of Reed to the position he had previously held prior to the MACO's arrival. She felt that otherwise, the episode consisted of action to the exclusion of character development but Green criticised the ease at which some of the Xindi side with Archer. She called it a \"strong arc episode\" and set-up the finale, but was concerned that the strong build-up could lead to it being an anticlimax. Jamahl Epsicokhan, on his website \"Jammer's Reviews\", gave the episode a rating of three out of four. He felt that the structure of the plot was the same as the previous episode, but that it had no story and was \"simply plot and action skillfully assembled — a series of events framed as goal-oriented nonstop momentum.\" He was pleased to see an improvement in the writing of the Reed/Hayes relationship and the MACOs, although he felt the collaborative working between the two parties should have occurred earlier in the season.\n\nThe only home media release of \"Countdown\" has been as part of the season three DVD box set which was released in the United States on September 27, 2005. The Blu-ray release of \"Enterprise\" was announced in early 2013, and released on January 7, 2014.\n"}

R. Sorley, was a Scottish philosopher. A Gifford Lecturer, he was one of the British Idealist school of thinkers, with interests in ethics. He was opposed to women being admitted as students to the University of Cambridge.\n\nWilliam Ritchie Sorley was born in Selkirk, Scotland, the son of Anna Ritchie and William Sorley, a Free Church of Scotland minister. He was educated first at the University of Edinburgh, where he took a degree in philosophy and mathematics. This was followed by New College, Edinburgh where he studied theology with the intention of training for the church. He gave this up, and after winning the Shaw Fellowship he spent a year at Trinity College, Cambridge where he took Part II of the Moral Sciences Tripos. He subsequently spent several years at Cambridge where he was lecturer and in 1883 he was elected a Fellow at Trinity.\n\nIn 1886, he was appointed to a post at University College London. After two years he was appointed to a professorship at University College Cardiff, succeeding Andrew Seth as Professor of Logic and Philosophy.\n\nIn 1894 he was appointed Regius Professor of Moral Philosophy at the University of Aberdeen, and finally in 1900 he succeeded Henry Sidgwick in the Knightbridge Professorship at the University of Cambridge. He held this post until his retirement in 1933. He received the honorary degree \"Legum Doctor\" (LLD) from the University of Edinburgh in March 1900, and was made a Fellow of the British Academy in 1905.\n\nSorley's main philosophical interest was the place of moral values in the constitution of the universe. He thought that moral values are objective- a view he explains in his Gifford lectures and in his earlv work on the ethics of naturalism. What is morally good is what we are morally bound to pursue within our ability to do so. If it does not lie within our power to act in a certain way, then we are not bound to pursue it and it cannot be a moral value.\n\nHe is now remembered for his \"A History of British Philosophy to 1900\", published in 1920, with its idiosyncratic slant, as a retrospective view from the point of view of British Idealism. Among his other published works are: \"The Ethics of Naturalism: a Criticism\" (second edition 1904), \"The Moral Life and Moral Worth\" (1911), and his Gifford Lectures which he gave in 1914-15 and were published under the title \"Moral Values and the Idea of God\" (second edition 1921). In his obituary, J.H. Muirhead said of this: \"I can remember the sense of freshness and power that this book gave us all at the time\". The poet Charles Sorley was his son.\n\nDuring the long argument about admitting women as students at Cambridge, there were votes by the Senate in 1897 and again in 1920, following intense public debates among lecturers and undergraduates, and the circulation of many flysheets propounding arguments for and against. Sorley was persistently hostile to any presence of women in Cambridge and argued that they were not after equality but sought power and would damage university life. He authored several flysheets with Prof. Ridgeway - both wanted women totally excluded from Cambridge and instead a separate women's university set up for them.\n\nHe died in Cambridge on 28 July 1935 aged 79, following an illness from pneumonia.\n\n\n"}

Baker\n\nLafayette Curry Baker (October 13, 1826 – July 3, 1868) was a United States investigator and spy, serving the Union Army, during the American Civil War and under Presidents Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson.\n\nBaker was born in Stafford, New York, on October 13, 1826. He became a mechanic, moved to Michigan in 1839, returned to New York in 1848, moved to California in 1853, and was a San Francisco vigilante in 1856. He moved to the District of Columbia in 1861.\n\nBaker's exploits are mainly known through his book \"A History of the Secret Service\" which he published in 1867 after his fall from grace. During the early months of the Civil War, he spied for General Winfield Scott on Confederate forces in Virginia. Despite numerous scrapes, he returned to Washington, D.C., with information that Scott evidently thought valuable enough to raise him to the rank of captain. As Provost Marshal of Washington, D.C., from September 12, 1862, to November 7, 1863, Baker ran the National Detective Bureau also sometimes known as the \"National Detective Police Department.\" He was appointed colonel of D.C. Cavalry, May 5, 1863. According to Glenn Hastedt \"Although his accomplishments were many, Baker operated with little regard for warrants or the constitutional rights of those he pursued. He is also reported to have employed brutal interrogation techniques in order to obtain information.\"\nBaker owed his appointment largely to Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, but suspected the secretary of corruption and was eventually demoted for tapping his telegraph lines and packed off to New York.\n\nBaker was recalled to Washington after the assassination of President Lincoln in 1865. Within two days of his arrival in Washington, Baker's agents in Maryland had made four arrests and had the names of two more conspirators, including the actual presidential assassin John Wilkes Booth. Before the month was out, Booth along with David Herold were found holed up in a barn and Booth was himself shot and killed by Sgt. Boston Corbett. Baker received a generous share of the $100,000 reward offered to the person who apprehended the president's killer. President Andrew Johnson nominated Baker for appointment to the grade of brigadier general of volunteers, April 26, 1865, but the United States Senate never confirmed the appointment. Baker was mustered out of the volunteers on January 15, 1866.\n\nThe following year, Baker was sacked from his position as government spymaster. President Johnson accused him of spying on him, a charge Baker admitted in his book which he published in response. He also announced that he had had Booth's diary in his possession which was being suppressed by the Department of War and Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton. When the diary was eventually produced, Baker claimed that eighteen vital pages were missing. It was suggested by Otto Eisenschiml in his book, \"Why Was Lincoln Murdered?,\" that these would implicate Stanton in the assassination. However, this notion has been proven as speculation by author Edward Steers Jr. and based on non-reputable sources.\n\nOn July 3, 1868, Baker retired to home complaining of soreness from a gun wound during a hunting trip. He had been out drinking with Wally Pollack, his brother-in-law, and came home feeling sick, passing away later that night, reportedly from meningitis.\n\nA widely criticized 1977 book, \"The Lincoln Conspiracy\" by conspiracy theorists David W. Balsiger and Charles E. Sellier, alleges that Baker was poisoned by high-placed conspirators, including Stanton, who supported John Wilkes Booth's plan to kidnap Abraham Lincoln in 1864 and early 1865. The conspirators supposedly planned to have Lincoln impeached in his absence. The authors speculate that the conspirators were concerned that Baker could link them to the planned kidnapping, which might lead to accusations that they were conspirators in Lincoln's assassination. The authors believe the conspirators did not support Booth after March 1865. Academic historians have treated the book with hostility and derision, having many objections based on errors and misuse of sources in the book.\n\nBaker is buried in Forest Hills Cemetery, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\n"}

{"id": "1940435", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1940435", "title": "Veterans of Future Wars", "text": "Veterans of Future Wars\n\nVeterans of Future Wars (VFW) was a satirical political organization initially created as a prank by Princeton University students in 1936. The group was conceived as a parody of the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the movement for early payment of a bonus to veterans of World War I that had been originally scheduled for disbursement in 1945 when the World War Adjusted Compensation Act was passed in 1924. The group jokingly advocated the payment of a similar $1,000 \"bonus\" (plus 30 years' of interest) to future veterans of a coming European conflagration while the recipients were young enough—and alive—to enjoy it.\n\nThe erstwhile parody organization became a national sensation, gaining upwards of 60,000 adherents on college campuses across the United States. The members nationwide were strongly anti-war and cared little for the anti-bonus motivation of the leaders, all of whom were Princeton students. The deep contradiction led to an overnight disintegration late in the 1936–37 academic year.\n\nIn March 1936, Princeton University roommates Lewis Gorin, Jr. and Urban Rushton attended a movie at which they saw a newsreel reporting plans for an early payout of $2 billion in bonus money to veterans of World War I which had been originally scheduled for disbursement in 1945 as part of the World War Adjusted Compensation Act of 1924. The pair's sensibilities were offended that such a massive payout was being so readily granted by Congress in the midst of the Great Depression, due mostly to the lobbying efforts of special interest groups such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) and the American Legion.\n\nWith war in the wind in Europe, the two collegians penciled out plans for a parody organization that would lobby for immediate payment of $1,000 \"war bonuses\" to every American man of military age, including 30 years of future interest—which would bring the total to $2,400—while they were still alive to cash the checks and young enough to enjoy the money. This organization would be known as the Veterans of Future Wars (VFW), in obvious parody of the national veterans organization using the same acronym since 1899.\n\nThe group's satirical manifesto, written by Lewis Gorin, explained the rationale for such a payment:\n\nThe group's manifesto also noted that American women would \"suffer no less than the men in the coming strife\" and therefore advocated immediate payment of a pension of \"$50 per month during the remainder of their natural life\" for \"all mothers and future mothers of male children,\" via the Veterans of Future Wars' \"Home Fire Division.\"\n\nThe satirical Princeton organization dreamed up by Gorin achieved national prominence through a well-timed press release. News of the tongue-in-cheek manifesto calling for cash \"bonuses\" and \"pensions\" to young men and women was picked up by the Associated Press, United Press International, and other wire services and spread coast-to-coast via the nation's daily newspapers. Taken seriously as part of the pacifist movement in some places and as political theater in others, within three weeks the new VFW was reporting the formation of more than 300 \"posts\" around the country, counting among their ranks some 25,000 members. Gorin quickly found himself renting an office in Princeton, New Jersey and hiring a secretary to deal with the mountain of correspondence generated by the spontaneous growth of the new organization.\n\nThe Veterans of Future Wars received its warmest reception from those students who saw the group as a mockery of the overblown patriotism and sense of entitlement of the military veterans' lobby and who saw the veterans lobby as advocates of militarism and an obstacle to peace. Local initiatives added layers of complexity to the VFW parody, with various college seminary students forming a Chaplains of Future Wars, while Cornell University engineering students launched a parallel group called the Future Munitions Workers. Further spinning the VFW concept were journalism students at Rutgers University who launched an pseudo-organization called Propagandists of Future Wars, others at City College of New York who gave birth to the Foreign Correspondents of Future Wars, and a women's group at Bennington College, which debuted the Future War Spinsters.\n\nGorin himself achieved national prominence, receiving multiple invitations as a speaker at events held by the vibrant anti-war movement of the day and later being remembered in his 1999 \"New York Times\" obituary as having briefly been \"the most famous collegian in America who did not actually play football.\" Gorin was quick to capitalize on the publicity afforded him, rushing a short book called \"Patriotism Prepaid\" into print through the important Philadelphia publisher J. B. Lippincott & Co. just two months after the March 1936 launch of the VFW. Gorin's short work received serious reviews in major newspapers around the country, with the \"New York Herald Tribune\" proclaiming it \"the best and grimmest joke of 1936.\"\n\nGorin proclaimed serious intent behind the satirical organization, declaring a hope that the VFW would be the vehicle by which the anti-war movement could \"arrive at some plan to keep us out of the coming European War, but a plan which will appeal to isolationists, Jingoes, and pacifists\" alike. Among the group's moral supporters was First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, who declared the mock student organization \"as funny as can be\" and \"taken light, as it should be—a grand pricking of lots of bubbles.\"\n\nThe Veterans of Future Wars spoof was not without its critics. An early effort to form a women's auxiliary called the Future Gold Star Mothers at Vassar College caused a firestorm, with Vassar President Henry Noble MacCracken denouncing the proposed group as a \"breach of good taste\" and prohibiting campus organizer Marys Converse from forming an organization by that or any other parody name. Similar statements and actions were taken by university officials at a range of other campuses, including Georgetown, George Washington, Temple, Indiana, Southern Methodist, and many other institutions.\n\nVarious patriotic and nationalist organizations such as the American Legion were vitriolic, with the \"National Legionnaire\" magazine mocking the \"Pansies of Princeton\" in verse.\n\nHate mail poured into the Veterans of Future Wars' office, with anonymous and signed letters calling the group's participants cowards, communists, and Nazis, and challenging their intelligence and virility. Poison pens gleefully advocated the future lynching of \"yellow slackers\" when the next war eventually embroiled the country and the world.\n\nRepresentative Claude Fuller of Arkansas went so far as to denounce the Veterans of Future Wars on the floor of the United States Congress, missing no target in characterizing the group as communist, fascist, and pacifist.\n\nThe Veterans of Future Wars, starting as a joke among friends before rapidly blowing up into a national sensation, proved to be ill-prepared for its sudden growth. Contradictions emerged between more conservative elements focused upon the frivolity of massive government spending on a soldiers' bonus during the depths of the Great Depression on the one hand and those on the organization's left interested in striking a lasting blow at growing militarism in the United States. While most of the thousands of students flocking to local groups associated with the VFW were attracted by the group's potential as a voice for pacifism, in the view of Fairleigh Dickinson University historian Chris Rasmussen, Gorin and the VFW leadership \"were wary of presiding over a strictly antiwar organization or being branded as leftists or pacifists.\" The VFW leadership refused to support the Oxford Pledge or to lend the group's support to peace marches, student strikes, or other forms of direct action.\n\nAs the 1935–36 school year came to a close in June 1936, the Veterans of Future Wars reached the peak of its membership and activity; by the fall of 1936 and the resumption of college classes, indecision about how to proceed next froze local activity. As a result of its political hesitancy, the most active and radical supporters of the VFW quickly moved from the parody organization to more serious efforts to keep America out of the coming European war, such as the American Student Union.\n\nVFW founder Lewis Gorin graduated from Princeton in June 1936 and enrolled at Harvard Law School for the coming year, further contributing to the VFW's organizational paralysis. Amidst this leadership vacuum and programmatic uncertainty, the Veterans of Future Wars atrophied as rapidly as it had arisen, dissolving by the end of the 1936–37 academic year.\n\nThe group's somewhat cynical view of the inevitability of American participation in a new European conflagration proved to be prescient, with Gorin and the entire governing National Council of the VFW, except for one member paralyzed in a car crash, ultimately joining the United States Armed Forces. Gorin served in the 6th Field Artillery Regiment on the European front, rising to the rank of Colonel and ironically becoming eligible for a host of military benefits and a pension at the end of World War II.\n\n\n"}

He was recalled to Rome in 1982 to assist with the Vatican's successful arbitration of the dispute between Chile and Argentina over the Beagle Channel.\nOn 12 June 1986, he was appointed Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to Yugoslavia.\n\nOn 17 April 1993, he was given additional responsibility as Apostolic Nuncio to Belarus. Just two weeks later, on 29 April 1993, he was named President of the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy, a post he held until 1998 while continuing in Belarus until 1994 and in Yugoslavia until 1996.\n\nPope John Paul appointed him Apostolic Nuncio to the United States on 7 December 1998. He was also Permanent Observer of the Holy See to the Organization of American States the same day.\n\nIn 2000 Montalvo promptly forwarded to the Secretariat a letter that reported rumors of inappropriate behavior with seminarians on the part of Cardinal Theodore McCarrick. When the letter's author had hesitated to put his charges in writing, fearful that he would suffer reprisals if McCarrick ever saw it, Montalvo insisted he write saying \"What do you think we are, fools? Send the letter.\" On 6 December 2005, Paul Bootkoski, then Bishop of Metuchen, New Jersey, informed Montalvo of three complaints regarding inappropriate sexual behavior by McCarrick, first by phone, and then in writing. Two were made by former priests; the third was hearsay relayed by someone who did not believe it. \n\nOn 17 December 2005, Montalvo retired as Apostolic Nuncio to the United States, at the mandatory age of seventy-five. Despite his long tenure as nuncio, he was a little-known public figure in the United States, where he shunned media attention. .He died of lung cancer at a hospice in Rome on 2 August 2006.\n\n"}
{"id": "1940443", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1940443", "title": "Pontifical Catholic University of Peru", "text": "Pontifical Catholic University of Peru\n\nPontifical Catholic University of Peru (, PUCP) is a private university in Lima, Peru. It was founded in 1917 with the support and approval of the Catholic Church. The person who dealt the necessary formalities was Catholic priest Father Jorge Dintilhac SS.CC. This University was the Peru's first non-State institution of higher learning. Academically, PUCP ranks alternatively as first or second in Peru.\n\nIn July 2012, after an apostolic visitation, begun earlier, in 2011, by Cardinal Peter Erdo, Archbishop of Esztergom-Budapest, Hungary, the Holy See withdrew from the university the right under canon law to use the titles \"Catholic\" and \"Pontifical\" in its name. Titles like \"Catholic\" and \"Pontifical\" are granted by Vatican only after meeting legal requirements. However, on Monday, 28 April 2014, the Rector of the University stated that,: \"The Holy Father, Pope Francis, has formed a Commission of Cardinals with the mission of meeting to find a 'final, consensual solution,' in the framework of the Apostolic Constitution 'Ex Corde Ecclesiae,' ('From the Heart of the Church') to the outstanding issues\" between the Vatican and the University.\" Besides Cardinal Erdo, the other two Cardinal Members of the Commission will be Cardinal Gerald Lacroix, Archbishop of Quebec City, Quebec, Canada, and Cardinal Ricardo Ezzati Andrello, Archbishop of Santiago de Chile, Chile. In 2016, Vatican restored the lost titles and determined that Archbishop of Lima will not assume ever the position of Chancellor of the University. It was a sort of appeasement for rebel authorities because Archbishop of Lima, Juan Luis Cipriani, was the main advocate of the Vatican interests. Nevertheless, nowadays (December 2018) those authorities are facing charges, and Rector Marcial Rubio had to resign after a scandal of undue and abusive charges of students.\n\nThe University began activities in 1917 with two schools: Letters and Laws. In 1933, when the university had more than 500 students, the Schools of Engineering, and Political and Economical Sciences were established. In 1935, the School of Education was created. Later, in 1939, the Academy of Catholic Art was founded, with Adolf Winternitz as its director; the university is still one of only a small number to offer an arts major in Perú.\n\nThe university claims Catholic affiliation, but is not recognized by the Catholic Church. There are currently 23,000 undergraduate students pursuing 38 different specialties in 10 schools. Its main campus is located in the Lima district of San Miguel, with the newly built Mac Gregor complex.\n\nOutside the main campus there are other facilities such as the IC (Idiomas Católica), a language-learning center, the Confucius Institute PUCP, the cultural center (CCPUCP) located in the district of San Isidro. CENTRUM, a center for business studies featuring doctoral level and MBA programs and located in the district of Santiago de Surco, is also part of PUCP. Inside, there is a Pastoral Counseling Center (CAPU).\n\n\nThe university is presently experiencing a debate over its taken name. The debate over the pontifical and catholic status of the university dates back to the 1991 Apostolic Exhortation \"Ex Corde Ecclesiae\" of Pope John Paul II, in which the pope legislated the essential norms for institutes of higher education which wished to be known as \"Catholic.\" Catholic authorities claim that for twenty years these norms were not implemented by the University, despite Vatican requests. It is alleged that the University had refused to allow the Peruvian bishops an official seat on the board of governance and access to the administration of bequests and other sources of funding.\n\nIn October 2011, Cardinal Péter Erdő, 59, Metropolitan Archbishop of Esztergom-Budapest, President of the Hungarian Episcopal Conference was named Apostolic visitor to the College. Erdő had requested that the University implemented the norms by Easter 2012.\n\nUnder canon law, the pontifical title allows certain acknowledged Catholic universities to obtain various ecclesiastical degrees aside from normal civil degrees. Certain seminaries require, for instance, that those teaching classes of theology and canon law hold pontifical degrees in those subjects only obtainable with the permission and recognition by the Holy See.\n\nIn a televised interview with Peruvian channel RPP TV, the attorney for the Archdiocese of Lima, Natale Amprimo, issued a press statement stating that the Archdiocese may decide to file a lawsuit against the university if they do not revise their name soon. Amprimo cited article 83 of the P.U.C.P. University Act, i.e. \"\"goods coming from donations, legacies and bequests are subject to the regime established by the donor\"\".\n\nIn a papal decree dated 11 July 2012, the Vatican's Cardinal Secretary of State Tarcisio Bertone withdrew the titles of \"Pontificia\" and \"Catolica\" from the University, citing disagreements with the current governing body The title \"Pontificia\" was previously granted to the university on 30 September 1942 by the Holy See which was decreed and signed by Pope Pius XII.\n\nThe canonical decree was approved by Pope Benedict XVI, upon whom the University had conferred the academic title of Doctor Honoris causa in 1986, when he was Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger.\n\nOn 22 July 2012 the rector of the university, Marcial Rubio, released a press statement refusing to relinquish the titles Catholic and Pontifical as previously granted by Pope Pius XII, citing that the situation is \"regrettable\" but the title remains their \"official name and will continue to use as such so long as its convenient\" to their governing body. Rubio also asserted that at present the University is governed by the civil laws of Peru, not by ecclesiastical canon law.\n\nOn 26 July 2012, in a CNN televised interview, Marcial Rubio noted that the university may change the official name of the school in the future but only according to a timeline and decision of the present governing board, not in response to any pressure from the Pope or the Holy See. Furthermore, Rubio said that the university will continue to issue its own secular degrees and diplomas which the school considers lawful and valid in Peru.\n\n\"See also \"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1940449", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1940449", "title": "RoboCop 3", "text": "RoboCop 3\n\nRoboCop 3 is a 1993 American science fiction action film directed by Fred Dekker and written by Dekker and Frank Miller. It stars Robert John Burke, Nancy Allen and Rip Torn. Set in the near future in a dystopian metropolitan Detroit, Michigan, the plot centers around RoboCop (Burke) as he vows to avenge the death of his partner Anne Lewis (Allen) and save Detroit from falling into chaos, while evil conglomerate OCP, run by its villainous CEO (Torn), advances its tyrannical program to have the city default on its debts. It was filmed in Atlanta, Georgia. Most of the buildings seen in the film were slated for demolition to make way for facilities for the 1996 Summer Olympics that were held in the city.\n\n\"RoboCop 3\" is the first film to use digital morphing in more than one scene. The film was a critical and commercial failure, only grossing $10 million worldwide against its $22 million budget, making it the least profitable film of the \"RoboCop\" franchise.\n\nThe city of Detroit is on the verge of bankruptcy after a series of failed business plans and drop of stocks, and are now struggling with their plans to create the new Delta City. Conglomerate Omni Consumer Products (OCP) are set to have the city default on their debt before purchasing the entire city. To speed up the process, OCP creates an armed force called the Urban Rehabilitators, nicknamed \"Rehabs,\" under the command of Paul McDaggett. Ostensibly its purpose is to combat rising crime in Old Detroit, augmenting the ranks of the Detroit Police Department in apprehending violent criminals. In reality, it has been set up to forcibly relocate the residents of Cadillac Heights. Nikko, a Japanese-American computer whiz kid, loses her parents in the process.\n\nThe police force is gradually superseded by the Rehabs, and violent crime begins to spiral out of control. The Delta City dream of the former OCP CEO lives on with the help of the Japanese Kanemitsu Corporation, which has bought a controlling stake in OCP and is trying to finance the plan. Kanemitsu, CEO of the Kanemitsu Corporation, sees the potential in the citywide redevelopment, and moves forward with the plans to remove the current citizens in order to create Delta City. The company develops and uses its own ninja androids called \"Otomo\" to help McDaggett and the new OCP president overcome the resistance of anti-OCP militia forces.\n\nRoboCop and partner Anne Lewis try to defend civilians from the Rehabs one night, but Lewis is mortally wounded by McDaggett and eventually dies. Unable to fight back because of his \"Fourth Directive\" programming, RoboCop is saved by members of a resistance movement composed of Nikko and residents from Cadillac Heights and eventually joins them. Due to severe damage sustained in the shoot-out, RoboCop's systems efficiency plummets, and he asks the resistance to summon Dr. Lazarus, one of the scientists who created him. Upon arrival she begins to treat him, deleting the Fourth Directive in the process. During an earlier raid on an armory, the resistance picked up a jet-pack prototype, originally intended for RoboCop's use, which Lazarus modifies and upgrades to hold RoboCop.\n\nAfter recovering from his injuries, RoboCop conducts a one-man campaign against the Rehabs and OCP. He finds McDaggett and attempts to subdue him, but McDaggett is able to escape. McDaggett then obtains information from a disgruntled resistance member regarding the location of the resistance fighters' base. The Rehabs attack and most of the resistance members are either killed or taken prisoner. RoboCop returns to the rebel base to find it abandoned. One Otomo unit arrives and attacks him. RoboCop experiences another power drain and his left arm and auto gun is destroyed, but eventually he is able to overcome his opponent with his arm-mounted gun. Nikko infiltrates the OCP building and assists a captured Lazarus in broadcasting an improvised video, revealing OCP's responsibility for the criminality in the city and implicating them in the removal and killing of the Cadillac Heights residents. The broadcast causes OCP's stock to plunge, driving the company into financial ruin and bankruptcy.\n\nMeanwhile, McDaggett decides to execute an all-out strike against Cadillac Heights with the help of the Detroit police, but the police officers, enraged at the company's sadistic ways, refuse to comply and instead defect to the resistance in order to get revenge for Anne and their salaries and pensions, escalating the rebellion against OCP into a full-scale war. As a result, McDaggett turns to hiring street gangs and hooligans to assist with his plans.\n\nHaving heard Lazarus' broadcast, RoboCop provides aerial support for the entrenched resistance forces. He then proceeds to the OCP building and confronts the waiting McDaggett. RoboCop is then attacked, and nearly defeated, by two Otomo robots. Nikko and Lazarus succeed in reprogramming them using a wireless link from a laptop computer, however, forcing them to attack each other. The Otomos' self-destruct system activate, forcing RoboCop to flee with Nikko and Lazarus. The flaming discharge from the jetpack immobilizes McDaggett, leaving him to perish in the blast.\n\nAs Old Detroit is being cleaned up, Kanemitsu arrives and finally comes face to face with RoboCop along with his group, while his translator tells the OCP president on Kanemitsu's behalf that he is fired, as the corporation shuts down OCP for good and plans to leave Detroit. Kanemitsu then bows to RoboCop and the group in respect. The CEO compliments RoboCop and asks for his name, to which he responds with, \"My friends call me Murphy. You call me RoboCop.\"\n\nThe film was directed by Fred Dekker, a director primarily known for cult horror films (\"Night of the Creeps\", \"The Monster Squad\"). Comic author Frank Miller, who co-wrote \"RoboCop 2\", returned to write the screenplay for the film. Still optimistic that he could make an impression in Hollywood, Miller hoped that some of his ideas excised from \"RoboCop 2\" would make it into \"RoboCop 3\". Major themes of the plot were taken from Miller's original (rejected) draft of \"RoboCop 2\". Disillusioned after finding that his work was even more drastically altered, Miller left Hollywood until the 2005 adaptation of his work \"Sin City\". “[Working on \"RoboCop 2\" and \"3\"] I learned the same lesson,” Miller said in 2005. “Don’t be the writer. The director’s got the power. The screenplay is a fire hydrant, and there’s a row of dogs around the block waiting for it.\" Miller's original screenplay for \"RoboCop 2\", and source for major ideas in \"RoboCop 3\", was later turned into a nine-part comic book series called \"Frank Miller's RoboCop\".\n\nThe star of the previous films, Peter Weller, did not reprise the role of RoboCop, as he was starring in \"Naked Lunch.\" Robert John Burke was signed to play the cyborg character instead. The RoboCop suit Burke wore in the movie was originally built for \"RoboCop 2\" (1990). Since Burke was taller than Weller, he complained that wearing it was painful after a short time. Other important casting changes had to be made for the third film. The actor who played the OCP CEO from the previous two films, Dan O'Herlihy, was absent from this film. The cast changes meant that Nancy Allen, Robert DoQui, Felton Perry, Mario Machado and Angie Bolling are the only supporting cast actors to appear in all three films.\n\nRecognizing that RoboCop's fan base consisted primarily of children, Orion Pictures cut down on the graphic violence that was seen as the defining characteristic of the first two films.\n\n\"RoboCop 3\" went into production soon after \"RoboCop 2\" was complete. Initially scheduled for release in the summer of 1992, \"RoboCop 3\" would languish on the shelf until the following year as Orion Pictures went through bankruptcy and was bought out.\n\nAfter \"RoboCop 2\"'s score which was composed by Leonard Rosenman, the \"RoboCop\" original composer Basil Poledouris returned to do the soundtrack score and brought back many of the RoboCop themes that were missing from \"RoboCop 2.\"\n\n\"RoboCop 3\" earned $4.3 million on its opening weekend, ending its run with $10.6 million domestically, far short of recouping its estimated $22 million production budget.\n\n\"RoboCop 3\" was near universally panned by critics. The film was also a bomb at the box office only earning $10 million on a $22 million budget. Rotten Tomatoes gives \"RoboCop 3\" a score of 3% based on 30 reviews, with an average score of 3.1/10. The websites critical consensus states \"this asinine sequel should be placed under arrest.\" Metacritic rates it 40 out of 100 based on 15 critic reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nRichard Harrington from the \"Washington Post\" says the movie is \"hardly riveting and often it's downright silly. The sets and effects betray their downsized budget.\"\n\n\"Chicago Sun Times\" critic Roger Ebert gave the film one and a half stars, disputing the characters' longevity. \"Why do they persist in making these retreads? Because \"RoboCop\" is a brand name, I guess, and this is this year's new model. It's an old tradition in Detroit to take an old design and slap on some fresh chrome.\"\n\nDavid Nusair from Reel Film Reviews gave the film two and a half stars, stating, \"The best one could hope for is a movie that's not an ordeal to sit through, and on that level, \"RoboCop 3\" certainly excels. When placed side-by-side with the original, the film doesn't quite hold up. But, at the very least, \"RoboCop 3\" works as a popcorn movie—something part two couldn't even manage.\"\n\nOther points of criticism in this movie include curtailing the graphic violence of the first two films (deliberately done in order to be more family friendly), less dark humor, and the absence of Peter Weller in the title role.\n\n"}
{"id": "1940458", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1940458", "title": "Rent strike", "text": "Rent strike\n\nA rent strike is a method of protest commonly employed against large landlords. In a rent strike, a group of tenants come together and agree to refuse to pay their rent \"en masse\" until a specific list of demands is met by the landlord. This can be a useful tactic of final resort for use against intransigent landlords, but carries the obvious risk of eviction and bad credit history in some cases.\n\nHistorically, rent strikes have often been used in response to problems such as high rents, poor conditions in the property, or unreasonable tenancy demands; however, there have been situations where wider issues have led to such action.\n\nGlasgow\nDuring the Irish Land War of the 1880s and during World War I when the landlords of tenement buildings in Glasgow sought to take advantage of the influx of shipbuilders coming into the city and the absence of many local men to raise rents on the tenements' remaining residents. These women left behind were seen as an easy target and were faced with a rent increase of up to 25% and would be forcibly evicted by bailiffs if they failed to pay. As a result of this rent increase, there was a popular backlash against the landlords and a rent strike was initiated. This was led by Mary Barbour, Mary B. Laird, Helen Crawfurd, Agnes Dollan, and other women who were dubbed 'Mrs. Barbour's Army'. During rent strikes, women would forcibly prevent the bailiffs from entering the tenements to deliver eviction notices by pelting them with flour bombs, pulling down their trousers, or throwing them into the 'midden' (trash) in the back court of tenement buildings. The strikes soon spread and became an overwhelming success, moving out from Glasgow and on to other cities throughout the UK, that the government, on 27 November 1915, introduced legislation to restrict rents to the pre-war level.\n\nThe Leeds rent strike in 1914 \nIn early January 1914, around 300 tenants living in the Burley area of Leeds went on rent strike against a 6d increase in rents imposed by the landlords. The rent increase had been called for by the Leeds branch of the Property Owners Association. At a mass meeting of the tenants on Sunday January 10, the rent strike organisers called for a citywide protest against the increase. A week later, the Leeds Trades Council hosted a Labour conference intended to organise mass rent resistance. A Tenants Defence League was formed with a central committee of nine and a mission to spread the rent campaign across the city through a series of public meetings and neighbourhood canvassing. The strike lasted eight weeks. In the end, committee members had been evicted and blacklisted from renting any other home in the area.\n\nKirkby Rent Strike\nA 14-month-long rent strike initiated by 3,000 tenants on October 9, 1972 in the town of Kirkby, outside Liverpool, against the Housing Finances Act. caused a £1 rent rise. A group of women on the Tower Hill estate formed a discussion and support group to help themselves and their families through the factory closure crisis when the Housing Finances Act was passed these women formed an Unfair Rents Action Group and responded by organizing the rent strike \n\nHighland Land League Scotland 1880s\n\nBarcelona mass rent strike 1931 \nbetween 5,000 and 100,000 people were out on rent strike \n\nThe Gothenburg Rent Strikes 1930s \nDuring the 1930s the Gothenburg Tenants´ Movement launched a rent-reduction campaign, using calls to boycott, cancellation of contracts and rent strikes to further their goals. Almost two thousand properties were affected and thousands of tenants got rent reductions as a result. The organized landlords retaliated and during the Olskroken Conflict 1936-1937 hundreds of tenants were evicted. The Olskroken conflict ended in a loss for the landlords, signalling the beginning of the end for tenant militancy in Gothenburg.\n\nNorthern Ireland\nDuring \"The Troubles\" (1960s-1980s) in Northern Ireland, participants in the civil rights movement withheld rent and council rates from local councils in protest at internment.\n\nUniversity College London\nOriginally starting in 2015 with just 60 students, by 2016 a rent strike movement involving over one thousand students at University College London withholding their rent had formed, eventually winning hundreds of thousands of pounds in concessions. This rent strike spread to other UK universities, with many setting up \"Cut The Rent\" campaigns. Since this 2016 rent strike there have been rent strikes also in 2017 and 2018 at UCL, continuing to demand cheaper rents and better conditions, which have also gone on to win over £1.5 million.\n\nSouth Africa massive rent strikes 1980s to end Apartheid and gain ownership of housing by the tenants. The government sent in troops in Soweto in 1987. \"Residents of some public housing have not paid their rents in several years, and in many cases officials have stopped trying to collect and have turned ownership over to tenants. In Soweto, for instance, Government officials say at least 50,000 rental units have been given to tenants.\" \n\nAnti-Rent Movement of New York 1839–1845\nThe Anti-Rent Movement (also known as the \"Anti-Rent War\" and \"Helderberg War\") was a tenants' revolt in upstate New York in the period 1839–1845. The Anti-Renters declared their independence from the manor system run by patroons, resisting tax collectors and successfully demanding land reform.\n\nNew York City Rent Strike in 1907\nIn 1907, in response to rising rents due to housing shortages 10,000 families in lower Manhattan went on rent strike. One of the primary organizers was 16-year-old Pauline Newman, housewives and women working in the garment industry. It lasted from December 26 until January 9 and led to about 2,000 families having their rents reduced.\n\nNew York City rent strike over repairs\nIn the winter of 1963-1964, a rent strike erupted in Harlem. It was led by Jesse Gray, a tenant organizer there since 1953. The focus of the strike was not rent levels but poor maintenance.\n\nNational wave of rent strikes throughout the US in 1960s and early 70s\nRent strikes spread through the US in response to the chronic neglect of repairs in both urban private and public housing stock. After the Harlem rent strikes in 1963-4, it became a popular tactic both among students in university towns and public housing tenants who were living in squalid conditions due to lack of funding and racist federal policies.\n\n\n"}

The archdiocese's first cathedral church is St. Mary Cathedral Basilica in Galveston, with a co-cathedral, the Co-Cathedral of the Sacred Heart, located in Downtown Houston. The co-cathedral is used for all major archdiocesan liturgies.\n\nThe archdiocesan history began with the erection of the prefecture apostolic of Texas in 1839, thus making Galveston the \"\"Mother Church of Texas\"\". The prefecture was elevated to a vicariate apostolic on July 10, 1841. On May 4, 1847, the vicariate became the Diocese of Galveston in the Province of New Orleans and St. Mary Cathedral Basilica was designated the cathedral.\n\nIn 1926, the then-diocese was placed in the newly created Province of San Antonio.\n\nAfter the devastating Galveston Hurricane of 1900, Houston began to expand after the Port of Houston was completed. At the request of Wendelin J. Nold, fifth bishop of Galveston, Pope John XXIII authorised the construction of a co-cathedral of convenience in Houston, and on July 25, 1959, the name of the diocese was changed to the Diocese of Galveston–Houston. Sacred Heart, a parish church located in downtown Houston, was named the co-cathedral of the diocese. This change made Houston an episcopal see city, and permitted full episcopal ceremonies to be held in both Galveston and Houston.\n\nIn 1979, Pope John Paul II recognized the importance the diocese's cathedral played in the development of Texas and the western United States and elevated the status of St. Mary Cathedral by naming it a minor basilica.\n\nBy the end of the 20th century, the diocese had become one of the largest in the United States with its episcopal see cities becoming internationally important. Recognizing this, in December 2004, Pope John Paul II created the new Ecclesiastical Province of Galveston–Houston and elevated the See of Galveston–Houston to a metropolitan see. Bishop Joseph Fiorenza, who had led the diocese for 20 years, became the first Archbishop of Galveston–Houston, and Bishop Daniel DiNardo became Coadjutor Archbishop.\n\nThe Archdiocese of Galveston–Houston oversees the following suffragan dioceses: Austin, Beaumont, Brownsville, Corpus Christi, Tyler and Victoria in Texas.\n\nMany landmark structures are contained within the archdiocese. Most prominent is St. Mary Cathedral Basilica, the mother church of Texas, and one of the few buildings and the only church to survive the 1900 Galveston Storm. Other landmarks include the 1887 Bishop's Palace, the former 1912 Sacred Heart Co-Cathedral, and Annunciation Church, one of the oldest churches in Texas.\n\n\n\n(Aloysius Joseph Meyer, C.M. was appointed apostolic administrator in 1881 but it did not take effect. Bishop Gallagher, already listed above, became administrator.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe coat of arms of the Archdiocese of Galveston–Houston is composed of a blue fielded shield on which is displayed a scattering of silver and white roses and topped with a bishop's mitre.\n\nThe roses represent the Blessed Virgin Mary, in her title of the Mystical Rose, titular of the Cathedral-Basilica in the see city of Galveston. The red cross represents the Faith, with a square center containing a single silver star to represent Texas, the \"Lone Star State\".\n\nApproximately 1.7 million Catholics live within the boundaries of the Archdiocese of Galveston–Houston (equaling 26% of the total population), making the archdiocese the largest in the state of Texas and the fifth largest in the United States. The archdiocese's 146 parishes are served by approximately 435 priests (193 diocesan, 195 religious, and 47 other) and 411 permanent deacons.\n\nAs of 2018, the Catholic school network of the archdiocese is the largest private school network in the State of Texas. As of that year the archdiocese had 59 schools, with about 19,500 students enrolled. In 2012 it operated thirteen schools in the central areas of Houston; that year they had 2,000 students, with about 66% of the students being Catholic.\n\nSee \"List of the Catholic bishops of the United States\"\n\n\n"}

The miners, mostly of Polish, Slovak, Lithuanian and German ethnicity, were shot and killed by a Luzerne County sheriff's posse. Scores more workers were wounded. The massacre was a turning point in the history of the United Mine Workers (UMW).\n\nThe economies of Central and Eastern Europe were struggling in the late 19th century. The European rural population was growing faster than either the agricultural or new industrial sectors of the economy could absorb, industrialization was disrupting both the agricultural and craft economy, and there was increasing competition from large-scale commercial and foreign agricultural producers. These factors drove most of the mass immigration to the US. Disproportionate numbers of new Slavic immigrants worked in the coal mining industry, where they were among the most exploited of all mine workers. During strikes in Northeast Pennsylvania by English-speaking miners in 1875 and 1887, many Slavic miners were imported as strikebreakers, and were \"despised as scabs\" by the English-speaking immigrant and American miners of the region.\n\nConditions in coal mines of the late 19th century were harsh. Mine safety was poor, such that 32,000 miners in Northeast Pennsylvania had died since 1870. Wages, already low in a competitive industry, fell 17% during the mid-1890s after a coal industry slump. Although wages had improved some by the fall of 1897, anthracite coal companies in the region cut wages and consolidated operations within the mines (often resulting in more laborious working conditions). In some cases, companies forced workers to lease homes from the company and required them to see only company doctors when injured.\n\nIn August 1897, the Honey Brook division of the Lehigh and Wilkes-Barre Coal Company laid off workers at its strip mines, cut the pay of the remaining employees, and raised fees for workers residing in the area's company towns. The company consolidated its mule stables, forcing teenage mule drivers to travel much farther each day to pick up their mules (time for which they were not compensated). After inconclusive talks, 25 to 35 teenaged drivers struck on August 14, 1897. A scuffle between a supervisor and some drivers led to additional walkouts by strip miners as well as underground coal miners, and by August 16 nearly 2,000 workers were on strike. Nearly all the miners joined the UMW (United Mine Workers) on August 18, and within two days almost all the mines in the region had closed due to the spreading strike. Many Slavic miners had not joined the nascent United Mine Workers, both because of ethnic discrimination exhibited by English-speaking and American miners but also because of the poor relationships between unionized miners and the former strikebreakers. But worsening working conditions and a UMW call for a 15 percent wage increase drew many Slavic miners into the union.\n\nThe first wave of the strike ended on August 23, after the company agreed to pay overtime, bring wages up to the regional average, allow miners to see their own doctors when injured, and no longer force miners to live in company-owned housing. A second strike began on August 25. Teenaged breaker boys at the A.S. Van Wickle coal breaker in the nearby village of Colerain struck for higher wages as well. When Van Wickle attempted to use Slavic workers as strikebreakers, the Slavs joined the strike instead. Although the strike spread to two other nearby coal works, the company quickly agreed to raise wages up to the regional average and the strike ended on or about August 28.\n\nBut when the new pay rates were announced on September 1, only a limited number of workers received raises. Management did agree to treat Slavic workers more fairly, but the mine owners reneged on their other promises. The strikes resumed. On September 3, 3,000 workers marched on four mines, shutting them down.\n\nThe mine owners' private armed force, the Coal and Iron Police, proved too few in number to break the strike, so the owners appealed for help from Luzerne County Sheriff James F. Martin. Martin established a posse of about 100 English and Irish citizens to prevent any further marches from occurring. Within five days, 8,000 to 10,000 miners were on strike. On September 8, mine owners demanded that the sheriff of Schuylkill County arrest several thousand miners who had assembled near Pottsville and had forced a mine to shut down, but the sheriff refused.\n\nOn Friday, September 10, about 300 to 400 unarmed strikers—nearly all of them Slavs and Germans—marched to a coal mine owned by Calvin Pardee at the town of Lattimer to support a newly formed UMW union. Their goal was to support the newly formed UMW union at the still-open Lattimer mine. The demonstrators were confronted by law enforcement officials several times on the road and ordered to disperse, but kept marching.\n\nThe deputies had spent most of the morning joking about how many miners they would kill. While on a streetcar headed for Lattimer with the sheriff and his comrades, one deputy was overheard saying \"I bet I drop six of them when I get over there.\"\n\nWhen the demonstrators reached Lattimer at 3:45 pm, they were met again by the sheriff and 150 armed deputies. Sheriff Martin ordered the marchers to disperse, and then attempted to grab an American flag out of the hands of the lead marcher. A scuffle ensued, and the police opened fire on the unarmed crowd. At least 19 miners died, and anywhere from 17 to 49 others were wounded. Many had been shot in the back, and several had multiple gunshot wounds, which indicated that they had been targeted by the deputies.\n\nThe strike led to temporary mass unrest in the area. After Sheriff Martin telephoned for help, the Pennsylvania National Guard was dispatched to the county to restore order. Late on the evening of September 10, more than 2,500 troops of the Third Brigade (partly stationed in Luzerne County) had been deployed. Local Slavic community leaders held a rally on September 11 to try to calm the workers, raise money for the provision of the families, and seek the prosecution of Sheriff Martin and his deputies. Outraged miners searched in vain on September 12 for Lehigh and Wilkes-Barre Coal Company mine superintendent Gomer Jones, and destroyed his home when they could not find him. On September 20, a group of Slavic women (armed with fireplace pokers and rolling pins) led some 150 men and boys to shut down the McAdoo coal works, but were turned back by the quick arrival of National Guard troops. The Guard's artillery unit was withdrawn on September 24, and the rest of the troops five days later.\n\nSheriff Martin and 73 deputies were arrested and put on trial. At trial, the defendants claimed that the marchers had refused to obey an order to disperse and were charging toward the sheriff and his deputies. As recounted by witness John Pusti in formal testimony:\n\nFurther medical evidence showed that nearly all the strikers had been shot in the back. Nonetheless, the sheriff and his deputies were acquitted.\n\nThe Lattimer massacre was a turning point in the history of the United Mine Workers (UMW). The UMW, struggling to establish itself in Pennsylvania's coal mines, witnessed a dramatic upsurge of more than 10,000 new members. The incident helped end a longstanding myth about the docility of non-English speaking miners. Just three years later, the union was powerful enough to win large wage increases and safety improvements for miners throughout the region. It significantly boosted the union career of John Mitchell, an activist for the UMW who would be elected president of the national union due to his efforts during the Lattimer strikes.\n\nThe crossroads where the Lattimer massacre occurred remained unmarked for 80 years. In 1972, the United Labor Council of Lower Luzerne and Carbon Counties and the UMW erected a small memorial on the site.\n\nAccording to a contemporary report in the \"New York Herald,\" there were 21 killed in the Lattimer massacre:\n\nWorking from what he describes as \"known gravesites\" rather than contemporary documents, in his book \"The Guns of Lattimer\" self-described \"philosopher and theologian rather than a historian\" Michael Novak lists the following 19 names of Lattimer shooting victims:\n\n\n\n"}

(film)\n\nOh, God! is a 1977 American comedy film starring George Burns and John Denver. Based on a 1971 novel of the same name by Avery Corman, the film was directed by Carl Reiner from a screenplay written by Larry Gelbart. The story centers on unassuming supermarket manager Jerry Landers (Denver), chosen by God (Burns) to spread his message despite the skepticism of the media, religious authorities, and Landers' own wife (Teri Garr).\n\nThe film inspired two sequels, \"Oh, God! Book II\" (1980) and \"Oh, God! You Devil\" (1984), both of which featured Burns reprising his role, but with no other recurring characters from the original story.\n\nGod (George Burns) appears as a kindly old man to Jerry Landers (John Denver), an assistant supermarket manager. After a few failed attempts in trying to set up an \"interview,\" God tells Jerry that he has been selected to be His messenger to the modern world, much like a contemporary Moses. Timidly at first, Landers tells his wife (Teri Garr), children and a religion editor of the \"Los Angeles Times\" of his encounters with God and soon becomes a national icon of comedic fodder.\n\nJerry soon appears on television with Dinah Shore and describes the look God takes when he encounters him. The next day, after Jerry is stranded from a car breakdown, God appears as a taxi driver to take Jerry home, where they are met by a bunch of chanting \"religious nuts.\" Before he disappears, God consoles Jerry that he has the \"strength that comes from knowing.\"\n\nSkeptical at first, Landers finds his life turned upside down as a group of theologians attempt to discredit him by challenging him to answer a series of questions written in Aramaic while locked in a hotel room alone to prove God is contacting him directly. To Jerry's relief after an agonizing wait, God, working as room service, delivers food to Jerry and answers the questions. After being sued for slander by a charismatic preacher that God directed Jerry to call a \"phony\", Jerry decides to prove his story in a court of law.\n\nJerry argues that if God's existence is a reasonable possibility, then He can materialize and sit in the witness chair if He so chooses. At first, God fails to appear and the judge threatens to charge Jerry with contempt for \"what you apparently thought was a clever stunt.\" Jerry argues that when everyone waited for a moment to see what would happen when he raised the mere possibility of God making a personal appearance in the courtroom, it proved that He at least deserves the , although given that a plaintiff in an American civil lawsuit needs only prove his/her case by a preponderance of the evidence in order to win, the mere establishment of reasonable doubt (including merely establishing that a given doubt is reasonable) is not enough to guarantee a defense verdict.\n\nSuddenly, without opening the doors, God appears and asks to be sworn in, concluding the procedure with \"So help me Me.\" \"If it pleases the court, and even if it doesn't please the court, I'm God, your honor.\"\n\nGod provides some miracles, first in the form of a few rather impressive card tricks for the judge. Then, to help the people believe, he leaves the stand, walks a few steps and, with everyone watching, literally disappears before their eyes. His disembodied voice then issues a parting shot: \"It can work. If you find it hard to believe in Me, maybe it will help to know that I believe in you.\"\n\nSometime later, after hearing the ringing of a public telephone, Jerry meets up with God once again. God states he's going on a trip to spend some time with animals. Jerry expresses worry that they failed, but God compares him to Johnny Appleseed, saying he was given the best seeds and they will take root. Jerry then says he has lost his job and that everybody thinks he's a nut, but God assures him that there are other supermarkets and that he's in \"good company\". God had said to Jerry earlier: \"lose a job; save a world.\" God gets ready to leave and says that he will not be coming back. Jerry then asks what if he needs to talk with him. God says to him \"I'll tell you what, you talk. I'll listen.\" He then disappears. Jerry smiles as God departs.\n\n\"Oh, God!\" garnered both critical acclaim and box office success upon its release.\n\nThe film was released on October 7, 1977 in 198 theaters and earned $1.9 million on its opening weekend. It ultimately grossed $51,061,196 domestically, making it the sixth highest-grossing film of 1977.\n\nThe film was well received by critics and was regarded by many as one of the best films of 1977, including Gene Siskel, who placed it on his top 10 list for the year. Roger Ebert gave the film 3.5 stars out of possible 4, praising the casting of Burns and Denver and noting that \"Oh God!\" struck the right tone by avoiding both pious religious platitudes and \"cheap shots\" about faith.\n\nThe film holds a 71% \"Fresh\" rating on the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nLarry Gelbart's screenplay received an Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay and a Saturn Award nod for Best Writing. The screenplay also won the Writers Guild award for Best Comedy Adapted from Another Medium.\n\n\"Oh, God!\" was also awarded two Saturn Awards for Best Fantasy Film and Best Actor for George Burns. It received an additional nomination for Carl Reiner's direction.\n\n\"Oh, God!\" has become a cornerstone of the \"On Cinema\" series, including its filming locations being featured in the \"On Cinema On Location\" segments, plus a segment in the On Cinema Live touring show during which Gregg Turkington presented \"a slideshow detailing the career trajectories of actors who starred in \"Oh, God!\".\"\n\n"}

The club was founded in 1947 and they have been members of the Macedonian First Football League since its inception in 1992.\n\nThe Toshe Proeski Arena has been the home ground of FK Vardar since 1947. Vardar is the most popular and renowned Macedonian football club both domestically and abroad, having won 10 national championships and 5 national cups.\n\nA football club named Vardar after the river of Vardar was established in 1911 but existed in the shadow of other major clubs in Skopje in the pre-WWII period. After WW2 FK Vardar was established with the merger of city rivals FK Pobeda and FK Makedonija, in the hall of cinema \"Vardar\" on 22 July 1947. The foundation assembly had decided the club's color to be blue and it was, but already at the next assembly the decision was changed to red and white. FK Pobeda has competed in the first season of the Federal League after the World War II, finished at the 8th place and won the relegation playoffs against FK Sloga from Novi Sad, FK Vardar was a member of the Federal league from the very beginning. However, during the following decade they were several times relegated and promoted back again. The present recognizable red and black color was adopted after the 1963 Skopje earthquake.\n\nThe club won its first major trophy in the 1960–61 Yugoslav Cup. Many famous players from the region started their careers at Vardar, and their triumph in the Yugoslav Cup was a highlight. The leader of that particular generation of players was Andon Dončevski, who later coached the team from 1985 to 1988. Due to massive irregularities during the last 34th week of fixtures, the 1985–86 Yugoslav First League season ended notoriously. Football Association of Yugoslavia headed by Slavko Šajber voided the last week's results ordering a replay of all 9 fixtures. Twelve clubs were docked 6 points due to alleged participation in the match-fixing scandal. All teams agreed to replay their games but FK Partizan, who had won the title with a 4–0 over FK Željezničar Sarajevo, refused, after which the game was awarded 3–0 to FK Željezničar Sarajevo, which gave Red Star Belgrade the title. Red Star Belgrade played in the 1986–87 European Cup. However, after a sequence of legal processes, the original final table, with FK Partizan as champions, was officially recognized in 1987. The following 1986-87 Federal League season saw 10 teams starting with -6 points. Vardar Skopje, who had not been deducted 6 points, won the title, and participated in the 1987–88 European Cup, but the points deduction was later annulled after more legal proceedings, and the title was given to FK Partizan, who headed the table with the deduction. But for UEFA, Vardar was recognized as a champion. In 1986–87 Federal League team had a group of wonderful players, led by the talented Darko Pančev and including Ilija Najdoski, Dragi Kanatlarovski and Vujadin Stanojković. FK Vardar went on to spend 33 seasons in the Federal top flight from 1947 to 1992 and is ranked 11th on the all-time table.\n\nVardar celebrated Macedonia independence by winning three consecutive titles including going unbeaten in the inaugural season. During the 90's they remained at the top of Macedonian football reaching five Cup finals; winning four and have always been the team to beat. After a lean spell by their standards, they brought the league again in 2001–02 and the following season just missed out on qualifying for the 2003–04 UEFA Champions League group stage. A remarkable achievement, in the Second qualifying round they eliminated CSKA Moscow and came within a goal of getting past Sparta Prague. In 2011, Vardar was originally relegated from the Macedonian First Football League, but after a buying the license from Miravci it stayed. The following season they brought the league again after nine years. To date they have 17 major honors to their name. In 2012, with the new transformation, FK Vardar became the first team in North Macedonia organized as a joint stock company incorporated under the Companies Act. FK Vardar went on to spend 24 seasons in the Macedonian First Football League from 1992 to 2017 and is ranked 1st on the all-time table.\n\nIn their history, FK Vardar has had many memorable matches. The first big one came in 1961 against Dunfermline from Scotland, victory at home ground 2:0 glorious moments in Cup winners Cup. Among those, the one that stands out the most was defeating FK Partizan by a score of 5–0. In early history, the 2–1 victory over Varteks in the Yugoslav Cup final is remembered by the club as its first major trophy win. A game that had the highest attendance was a matchup against Trepča where FK Vardar won 2–1 and earned promotion to the Yugoslav First League. Other matches to remember came against the great four Red Star Belgrade, Partizan Belgrade, Dinamo Zagreb and Hajduk Split. Then 1985 home ground victory over Dinamo Bucurset from Romania 1:0 in UEFA Cup competition. At the beginning of the Macedonian First Football League the most memorable matches were all the wins against rival Pelister, including the first-ever Macedonian Football Cup final in 1993 where FK Vardar won 1–0 at the old City Stadium. The biggest international achievement of the club came in 2003 when FK Vardar came one goal short of qualifying for the UEFA Champions League group stage. They had great match against Barry Town from Wales and 3–0 victory at home ground, then another glorious 2–1 away win over Russian heavyweights CSKA Moscow. In 2004 UEFA Intertoto Cup they destroyed Ethnikos Achnas from Cyprus in both matches home and away with identical victories of 5–1, then 1–0 victory against Belgian side Gent at home ground.\n\nIn the 2017–18 Champions League second qualifying round, Vardar were drawn against Swedish side Malmö FF, in the first leg away, they have played a draw (1–1) and won the second leg in Strumica (3–1), with the goals of Boban Grncharov, Tigran Barseghyan and Boban Nikolov. In the third qualifying round, Vardar was played against Danish side F.C. Copenhagen, they won first leg at the home in Skopje (1–0), with the goal of Jonathan Balotelli. In the second leg in Copenhagen, Vardar had a result which would lead to the play-off round of Champions League, but in last 15 minutes, Copenhagen scored two goals, and Vardar lost the match (4–1), and its eliminated from the Champions League. But, the participation in the European competitions in that season Vardar continued in the Europa League play-off round, in whom were drawn against Turkish giants Fenerbahçe. Surprisingly, Vardar won both matches against them, in the first leg in Skopje won 2–0, with the goals of Barseghyan and the bizarre own goal of Mehmet Topal, and in the second leg in Istanbul 2–1, with a goals of Jaba Jighauri and Nikola Gligorov, and Vardar qualified for the group stage of the Europa League for the first time in its history and became the first Macedonian club to qualify for the group stage of a European competition. In the group stage, Vardar were drawn in Group L against Zenit Saint Petersburg, Rosenborg and Real Sociedad. In the debut match, Vardar were outclassed by Zenit in Skopje (0–5) and lost the match in Trondheim against Rosenborg (3–1), but was scored first goal in the group stages of European competition by Juan Felipe. In third match Vardar was again trashed by Real Sociedad at home (0–6), which was a highest defeat in the European competition matches. \nHowever, FК Vardar later wins historic first point in European Cups with a 1:1 draw in the home match against Rosenborg BK.\n\nThe Filip 2 Arena with a capacity of 33,460 spectators, it ranks among the 10 biggest stadiums in the Balkans. The field is of 105 x 68 m dimensions. There are two big boards that are located on the east and west sides, size 18 × 6 m. The Toshe Proeski Arena has 494 VIP seats and 386 seats for the media on the northern stand. 80% of the space in Toshe Proeski Arena is sheltered in case of bad weather. The Toshe Proeski Arena is a multifunctional sports facility located in Skopje, North Macedonia. It is named after Philip II of Macedon and is mostly used for football matches. On 25 July 2012, one of the most visited matches of FK Vardar against FC BATE Borisov was played in the second qualifying round of the 2012–13 UEFA Champions League. The west stand is known by the Komiti, FK Vardar's most faithful fans.\nNational Arena Toshe Proeski was the host of 2017 UEFA Super Cup, Macedonia's first UEFA club competition final.\n\nThe Hipodrom Training Ground training camp of is one of the most impressive football facilities, built not only on the territory of North Macedonia and the surrounding region. Designed according to modern facilities which are at the disposal of the strongest European teams, this complex provides FK Vardar's first team players with all necessary conditions for the normal training process. Having in use the training center which cost 4 million €, the Vardar footballers received the following benefits offered by their new professional home:\n\nConsidering that the existence of adequate infrastructure is the most fundamental prerequisite for the football game FC Vardar received a modern training camp as it has long deserved. Simply, our present and future, the coaches and the footballers, right on this place will build, time and adjust the form, which is supposed to soar Vardar to the desired heights on the international stage in European competitions.\n\nThe longtime dream of generations of Vardar fans, for ranking in the group stage of the Champions League and the Europe League, we could now rightly say, that from day to day will start turning into reality. The first step towards a given target has been made with the implementation of the plan for the construction of the \"red-black\" professional training center.\n\nThe FK Vardar Football Academy is one of the most modern sports facilities intended for work with youth categories, which are built not only on the territory of North Macedonia, but in the surrounding region. As an institution for development of young football talents, the work of the academy is organized according to the standards of the famous clubs of Europe's elite. The Secrets of the football game under the guidance of their coaches and other professionals, will be learned by more than 400 boys, juniors of the most successful Macedonian club. The construction of this capital facility in the city park of Skopje, covers an area of , for the Vardar's juniors use with the following sports and administrative contents:\nA lot of top proven footballers came from the famous Vardar Football School in the time of the history, and this is witnessed by the numerous trophies won in the junior competitions of the Macedonian and the ex-Yugoslavia scene.\nNow, with the new working conditions, Vardar will be a regional leader in the creation of new football \"pearls\" that will successfully carry the jersey of our club and the national team of North Macedonia in the coming period.\nGuided by the thought that children are our greatest treasure and that the future belongs to them, investing in their football development and building of sports habits, has always been and will remain our top strategic priority.\n\nFK Vardar supporters are known as \"Komiti\". Komiti are the first organized supporters group of Vardar and they were founded on 4 June 1987 in Skopje, at the match between FK Vardar and Red Star Belgrade. Throughout their existence, they left significant seal in the history of Vardar and with their support becoming the 12th player of the team. FK Vardar as a club is supported by most Macedonians worldwide. The Ultras group KOMITI was noticed for the first time in the year 1985, on 'Zapad' (West Stand), where the most fanatic fans of Vardar always operated. Two years later, on 4 June 1987 at the City Stadium in Skopje was a derby match of the Yugoslav league at that time between Vardar Skopje and Red Star Belgrade (3:1). On 'Zapad' for the first time since the existence of the club, a banner with the writing 'KOMITI' was noticed. The idea contained the establishment of a massive and strong Macedonian ultra scene. The goal was for 'KOMITI' to make the prominent post of all activities and events on the West Stand. As the most acceptable name of the group was selected 'KOMITI'.\n\nThe reason for it was simple: When the Balkans were in the Middle Ages under occupation by the Ottomans, young Macedonians under the name 'KOMITI' had organized themselves, in order to fight against the tyranny. This name is very strong and the meaning of the name is closely linked with their goals, this is why they decided not to use one like the standard unimaginative names such as Brigate, Commando, Ultras, Boys, etc. And so, the name 'KOMITI' was selected for the newborn Ultra group.\n\nThe team has always been a symbol of the Macedonians and North Macedonia in the world. Komiti have great relations with FK Teteks fans \"Vojvodi\" and FC Schalke 04 fans \"Ultras Gelsenkirchen\".\n\nThe fixture between Vardar and FK Pelister is the biggest and most violent match in North Macedonia. An important aspect of this match-up is the intense rivalry in the Macedonian tifo scene between the supporter clubs Komiti Skopje and Čkembari. The rivalry began in the season 1989–90 at a match in Skopje, between FK Vardar and Red Star Belgrade. A conflict occurred between the \"Skopje fans\" and a few \"Bitola fans\" who went to cheer for FK Vardar, who at that time was the most popular Macedonian football club in the former Yugoslavia. On 8 March 1991 in Bitola FK Pelister and FK Vardar met in the Yugoslav second league and the first incident occurred. From that day forward, started the big rivalry between Komiti and Čkembari along with the Vardar–Pelister match becoming the eternal derby. In recent years the rivalry wained slightly in importance as FK Pelister stopped being as competitive.\n\nFK Vardar and FK Sloga Jugomagnat is the main derby in the city, as both clubs have active organised support. This rivalry is drawn along ethnic lines as FK Vardar fans are Macedonians and Orthodox Christians, while FK Sloga Jugomagnat are Albanians and Muslims. Rabotnički is the other team in Skopje with organised fans, although the rivalry is rarely manifested on the football pitch, it is widely upheld however in handball and basketball.\n\nVardar has a strong rivalry with KF Shkëndija. Like the rivalry with FK Shkupi, this rivalry is also drawn along ethnic lines as KF Shkëndija fans are Albanians and Muslims. There is also a friendly \"brotherhood derby\" with FK Teteks the fans of these two clubs have been dubbed as \"Orthodox Brothers\".\n\n\n\nFK Vardar's first competitive European match was a 0–5 loss against Dunfermline Athletic in the 1961–62 European Cup Winners' Cup. Muarem Zekir holds the record for most appearances in Europe for the club with 21. Top scorer in UEFA club competitions is Wandeir with 13 goals. The biggest win in UEFA competition was against Ethnikos Achna FC in the 2004 Intertoto Cup defeating them twice by the score of 5–1 and 10–2 on aggregate.\n\nFK Vardar became the first Macedonian club to qualify for the group stages of a European competition, after beating Fenerbahçe S.K. in the 2017–18 UEFA Europa League playoffs.\n\n\n"}

The dam is operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority, which built the dam in the early 1960s to extend the Tennessee Valley's continuous navigation channel up the Clinch as far as Clinton and to increase TVA's overall power-generating capacity. The dam impounds the Melton Hill Lake, and is the only TVA tributary dam serviced by a navigation lock. The dam and associated infrastructure were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017.\n\nMelton Hill Dam was named for a knob atop nearby Copper Ridge where the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey installed a triangulation station in 1884.\n\nThe Clinch River flows southwestward for from its source in southwestern Virginia through the hills of northeastern Tennessee before emptying into the Tennessee River at Kingston. Melton Hill Dam is located upstream from the mouth of the Clinch, stretching across the Roane-Loudon county line. Melton Hill's tailwaters are part of Watts Bar Lake, a main Tennessee River channel impoundment that extends across the lower of the Clinch. Melton Hill is the newer of two dams on the lower Clinch, the other being Norris Dam, located upstream from Melton Hill.\n\nMelton Hill is a concrete gravity-type dam with an electric power generation capacity of 79 megawatts. The dam is 103 feet (31 m) high and stretches 1,020 feet (311 m) across the Clinch River. The dam is equipped with a 3-bay spillway that has a total discharge of 118,000 cubic feet (3,341 cubic meters) per second.\n\nMelton Hill Lake provides nearly 193 miles (311 km) of shoreline and 5,470 acres (22 km²) of water surface for navigation and recreation, and includes parts of Loudon, Roane, Anderson, and Knox counties. The reservoir stretches up the Clinch from the dam to the base of Norris Dam, and is navigable for from Melton Hill Dam to Clinton.\n\nMelton Hill is the only TVA dam on a tributary stream (i.e., not on the Tennessee River) with a navigation lock. The lock is x , and lowers and raises vessels between Melton Hill Lake and Watts Bar Lake and vice versa.\n\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers recognized the dam potential of the Melton Hill site as early as the 1920s, and the Tennessee Valley Authority began investigating the site as part of its lower Clinch Valley surveys in the late 1930s. TVA first proposed the Melton Hill project in 1957, and after several years of lobbying, Congress agreed to fund the dam's construction. President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the funding bill into law on September 2, 1960, and TVA began building the dam on September 6, 1960.\n\nThe construction of Melton Hill Dam and its reservoir required the purchase of of land, of which— mostly situated along the river's west bank immediately upstream from the dam site— were in possession of the Atomic Energy Commission. The commission agreed to give this land to TVA in exchange for lands further downstream along Watts Bar Lake. The AEC also agreed to pay for the reconstruction of Oak Ridge's raw water intake after TVA accused them of building it without their approval, in violation of the TVA Act. 89 families and of roads were relocated. The project's most problematic relocation issue involved an experimental farm operated by the Agricultural Research Laboratory, a joint initiative of the AEC and the University of Tennessee. To replace the farm, TVA purchased and paid for the re-seeding of an plot nearby above reservoir operating levels.\n\nMelton Hill Dam was completed and its gates closed on May 1, 1963. Its first generator went online July 3, 1964, and its second generator went online November 11, 1964. The dam's lock was designed by the Army Corps of Engineers, which based the design on the Corps' Old Hickory Dam lock in Middle Tennessee. The Melton Hill lock is bigger than the typical 60x360-foot locks used by TVA's Tennessee River dams, allowing Melton Hill to accommodate several barges simultaneously. The lock was placed in service June 10, 1963.\n\n\n"}

It provides medical and surgical services. It is part of Parkway Pantai, itself a subsidiary of the Malaysian–Singaporean private healthcare group IHH Healthcare.\n\nGleneagles Hospital started out as a 45-bed nursing home in 1957. The British Association was the original founder of Glenagles Hospital, during a time where Singapore was slowly gaining independence from the British.\n\nOn 16 January 1958, Gleneagles Nursing Home was incorporated as a private company that came to be known as Gleneagles Hospital Limited. The hospital first opened its doors to the public on 8 June 1959. In 1979, it evolved into a 126-bed hospital that provides a wider range of medical services. From 1979 to 1980, the small 45-bed nursing home was slowly expanded into a 126-bed \"medical center\".\n\nParkway Holdings then acquired Glenagles Hospital on May 1987 for S$46 million. Parkway Holdings continued the expansion from 1988 to 1991. Spending S$150 million, Gleneagles Hospital was transformed into a modern hospital. The new additions were a new 10-storey hospital block, 14 operating theaters and 150 consulting suites. Parkway Holdings did not stop at superficial improvements. Gleneagles Hospital also expanded its range of services to include hospital management and consultancy services.\n\nIn 1993, Gleneagles transformed into a tertiary care hospital. A year later, Gleneagles Hospital was commissioned with 150 medical specialists. In 1997, the hospital had expanded to a 380-bed institution.\n\nAt present, there are more than 160 specialists specializing in more than 30 specialties. It is renowned for attracting many foreigners around the region due to its excellent patient care record.\n\nThe current address of the hospital at 6A Napier Road, Singapore 258500 is where the old Gleneagles Hotel was located. Located across the Singapore Botanical Gardens, Gleneagles Hotel was built as a luxury, leisure hotel. It had long lounges and wide windows. These features were adapted into the current hospital layout, allowing for a relatively different hospital environment, as compared to the other hospitals in Singapore.\n\nGleneagles Hospital was awarded the Joint Commission International Accreditation (JCI) in 2006, certifying that the hospital satisfies the international standard of care and hospital management, with the Gold Seal of Approval.\n\nIn 2002 the Asian American Liver Center in Gleneagles Hospital became the first hospital in South East Asia to perform a living donor liver transplant for children, a high-risk but potentially life-saving procedure. The Asian American Liver Center uses modern technology which helps doctors reconstruct liver anatomy from CT scans, facilitating more accurate diagnosis and precision in operations. it was the only South East Asian medical center to use this technology.\n\nGleneagles is in forged partnerships with institutions including Johns Hopkins University and Hospital (US), Thames Valley University (UK), Curtin University of Technology and La Trobe University (Australia). Besides working with international institutions, Gleneagles collaborates locally with other hospitals in times of crisis. In July 2013, in response to the surge in dengue cases, Gleneagles Hospital collaborated with public hospital Changi General Hospital, using its beds to accommodate public hospital patients.\n\nIn 2013 a patient, Mr Li Siu Lun, 54, sued Gleneagles Hospital and was awarded S$250,000 in damages, compensatory damages of $10,000 and $240,000 aggravated damages for distress.

It is one of the seven administrative divisions of the city of Prostějov, with a population of 3,402 inhabitants, according to the 2001 census.\n\nVrahovice lies in the Hornomoravský úval. The rivers Romže, Hloučela and Valová flow through Vrahovice. The highest point in Vrahovice is Vrbatecký kopec (known locally as \"Vrbák\").\n\nThe village was first mentioned in 1337. The first mention of a church in Vrahovice was in 1370. The church was destroyed in a large fire in 1587. A church constructed shortly after the fire was used until it was destroyed in 1831. A replacement church was built between 1831 and 1836 and financed by Jan Josef Count Seilern, the owner of the Kralice domain.\n\nA village by the name of Trpenovice (now known as Trpinky), with a written history dating back to 1349, was combined with Vrahovice in 1466. From 1960–1973, Vrahovice also included the village of Čechůvky.\n\nThrough its history, Vrahovice has passed through the hands of several owners. In 1725, Jan Bedrich Seilern bought Vrahovice, and the Seilern family became the last to possess the village.\n\nThe first mayor of Vrahovice was Jan Frébort, who took office in 1848. The village experienced significant development during the interwar period, during the tenure of mayor Josef Stříž, when roads to Prostějov and Vrbátky and a new city hall were built. During World War II, occupying Nazi forces built an observation point on the hill above Vrahovice to monitor the railway. After World War II, there was an internment camp in the village for Germans from the Prostějov region awaiting transfer to Germany.\n\nBetween 1950 and 1954, and from 1973 until the present day, Vrahovice has been a part of Prostějov. Since the 1990s there have been advocates for its separation.\n\nOn 9 December 2004, five people were killed in the village when a truck carrying soldiers crashed into a train.\n\nThe village has a church, Saint Bartholomew's, dating from the 19th century. Other important local buildings include a monument to the Czechoslovak Legions, an 18th-century Roman Catholic vicarage, an 18th-century statue of Saint Florian, and a brick factory built at the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nVrahovice has a common integrated transport system with Prostějov. Bus routes from Prostějov to Přerov and Tovačov run through the village. Vrahovice is located on the train route from Nezamyslice to Olomouc. The village train station was built in 1946.\n\nThe village has a primary school dating back to the 19th century.\n\nVrahovice is home to a Sokol branch, a volunteer fire department, and Spolek za staré Vrahovice, an association dedicated to local history research, environmental protection, and the promotion of the village. The association has renamed several streets in the village after important Vrahovice inhabitants, including Josef Stříž, František Kopečný and Zdeněk Tylšar, and has created a new park, the Arboretum Vrahovice.\n\nThere are no professional sports teams in Vrahovice. In 1930, a football team, SK Vrahovice, was established, but after the 1948 communist coup d'état, the team was banned. Its players became members of another voluntary football association, Sokol Vrahovice, which is still in existence.\n\nIn 2012, an amateur dragonboat team, \"\", was established.\n\nMusicians Zdeněk Tylšar and Bedřich Tylšar were born in the village, and linguist František Kopečný lived there for many years. Football player Rostislav Václavíček was born in Vrahovice and played football for the local team at the beginning of his career.\n\nOther notable natives:\n\nJiří Bigas wrote a book, \"Vrahovice 119\", about a village in the Sudetenland after the Second World War.

These elites gradually adopted Islam (from previous religions like Tengrism) as well as Turkic languages, while retaining Mongol political and legal institutions.\n\nThe Turco-Mongols founded many Islamic successor states after the collapse of the Mongol Khanates, such as the Tatar Khanates which succeeded the Golden Horde (e.g. Khanate of Crimea, Astrakhan Khanate, Kazan Khanate, Kazakh Khanate) and the Timurid Empire which succeeded the Chagatai Khanate in Central Asia. \n\nBabur (1483–1530), a Turco-Mongol prince and great-great-great-grandson of Timur, founded the Mughal Empire, which would go on to rule almost all of the Indian subcontinent.\n\nThese Turco-Mongol elites would become patrons of the Turco-Persian tradition, which was the predominant culture amongst the Muslims of Central Asia at the time. In subsequent centuries, the Turco-Persian culture would be carried on further by the conquering Turco-Mongols to neighbouring regions, eventually becoming the predominant culture of the ruling and elite classes of South Asia (Indian Subcontinent), specifically North India (Mughal Empire), Central Asia and Tarim basin (Northwest China) and large parts of West Asia (Middle East).\n\nBefore the time of Genghis Khan, Turkic peoples and Mongols exchanged words between each other, with Turkic languages being more active than Mongolian. A much earlier Turco-Mongol tradition existed in, as evidenced by the extensive lexical borrowings from Proto-Turkic in the Proto-Mongolic language from around at least the first millennium BCE. Turkic and Mongolic languages share extensive borrowed similarities in their personal pronouns, among other lexical similarities, which seem to date to before this era and already existed before the breakup of the Turkic people around 500 BCE. A still more ancient period of prolonged language contact between Turkic and Mongol languages is indicated by further and more fundamental phonotactic, grammatical, and typological similarities (e.g. synchronic vowel harmony, lack of grammatical gender, extensive agglutination, highly similar phonotactic rules and phonology). In the past, such similarities were attributed to a genetic relationship and led to the widespread acceptance of an Altaic language family. More recently, due to the lack of a definitive demonstration of genetic relationship, these similarities have been divided into at these three known periods of language contact. The similarities have led to the proposal of a Northeast Asian sprachbund instead, which also includes the Tungusic, Korean, and Japonic language families, although Turkic and Mongolic display the most extensive similarities. According to recent aggregation and research, there are doublets, which are considered to be the same in terms of their roots, found in the vocabulary in Mongolian language and Turkic loanwords. Also, inside the Mongolian vocabulary that are derived from other languages, Turkic is the most common.\n\nFollowing the Mongol conquests, the ruling Mongol elites of the Mongol successor states began a process of assimilation with the non-Mongol populations that they ruled over. The population of the Golden Horde was largely a mixture of Turks and Mongols who adopted Islam later, as well as smaller numbers of Finno-Ugrians, Sarmato-Scythians, Slavs, and people from the Caucasus, among others (whether Muslim or not). Most of the Horde's population was Turkic: Kipchaks, Cumans, Volga Bulgars, Khwarezmians, and others. The Horde was gradually Turkified and lost its Mongol identity, while the descendants of Batu's original Mongol warriors constituted the upper class. They were commonly named \"the Tatars\" by the Russians and Europeans. Russians preserved this common name for this group down to the 20th century. Whereas most members of this group identified themselves by their ethnic or tribal names, most also considered themselves to be Muslims. Most of the population, both agricultural and nomadic, adopted the Kypchak language, which developed into the regional languages of Kypchak groups after the Horde disintegrated.\n\nIn the Chagatai Khanate, the Turkic language that was adopted by the Mongol elites became known as the Chagatai language, a descendant of Karluk Turkic. The Chagatai language was the native language of the Timurid dynasty, a Turco-Mongol dynasty who would gain power in Central Asia after the decline of the Chagatai Khans. Chagatai is the predecessor of the modern Karluk branch of Turkic languages, which includes Uzbek and Uyghur.\n\nThe Mongols during the period of the early Mongol conquests and the conquests of Genghis Khan largely followed Tengrism. However, the successor states of the Mongol Empire, the Ilkhanate, Golden Horde and Chagatai Khanate ruled over large Muslim populations with the Ilkhanate and Chagatai Khanate ruling over Muslim majority populations in Iran and Central Asia respectively. \n\nIn the Golden Horde, Uzbeg (Öz-Beg) assumed the throne in 1313 and adopted Islam as the state religion. He proscribed Buddhism and Shamanism among the Mongols in Russia, thus reversing the spread of the Yuan culture. By 1315, Uzbeg had successfully Islamicized the Horde, killing Jochid princes and Buddhist lamas who opposed his religious policy and succession of the throne. Uzbeg Khan continued the alliance with the Mamluks begun by Berke and his predecessors. He kept a friendly relationship with the Mamluk Sultan and his shadow Caliph in Cairo. After a long delay and much discussion, he married a princess of the blood to Al-Nasir Muhammad, Sultan of Egypt. Under Uzbeg and his successor Janibeg (1342–1357), Islam, which among some of the Turks in Eurasia had deep roots going back into pre-Mongol times, gained general acceptance, though its adherents remained tolerant of other beliefs. In order to successfully expand Islam, the Mongols built a mosque and other \"elaborate places\" requiring baths — an important element of Muslim culture. Sarai attracted merchants from other countries. The slave trade flourished due to strengthening ties with the Mamluk Sultanate. Growth of wealth and increasing demand for products typically produce population growth, and so it was with Sarai. Housing in the region increased, which transformed the capital into the center of a large Muslim Sultanate.\n\nIn the Chagatai Khanate, Mubarak Shah converted to Islam and over time the Chagatai elite would become entirely Islamized. The Chagatai Khanate was succeeded by the Timurid Empire in Central Asia, founded by the Turco-Mongol warrior Timur. According to John Joseph Saunders, Timur was \"the product of an Islamized and Iranized society\", and not steppe nomadic. To legitimize his conquests, Timur relied on Islamic symbols and language, referred to himself as the \"Sword of Islam\", and patronized educational and religious institutions. He converted nearly all the Borjigin leaders to Islam during his lifetime. Timur decisively defeated the Christian Knights Hospitaller at the Siege of Smyrna, styling himself a \"ghazi\".\n\n"}

He has been a significant figure in the Canadian television industry, or more specifically children's programming, since the 1980s. Some of his most known productions include \"Committed\", \"Blaster's Universe\", \"Clone High\", \"Franklin\", \"Rolie Polie Olie\", \"Johnny Test\", \"Arthur\", \"Caillou\", \"Will and Dewitt\", \"Spider Riders\", \"World of Quest\", \"Magi-Nation and \"Strawberry Shortcake's Berry Bitty Adventures\".\n\nBorn in Belgium in 1948, Michael's family emigrated to North America when he was a child; he was raised primarily in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and New York City. After high school, Michael attended York University in Toronto where he would meet his future business partner, Patrick Loubert. Hirsh abandoned his post-secondary education after three years to pursue his filmmaking ambitions.\n\nIn 1971, Hirsh co-founded Nelvana with Patrick Loubert and British-born animation artist Clive A. Smith. Under co-CEO Hirsh's leadership, the studio was responsible for many of its animated phenomena.\n\nDuring this period, he co-directed the satirical live-action/animated 1972 feature \"Voulez-vous coucher avec God?\"\n\nIn the 1980s, Hirsh saved Nelvana from more than one brush with bankruptcy. After the failure of their initial feature film, \"Rock & Rule\" (in which he also worked as a storyboard artist for the film), the original distributor of their live-action show, \"T. and T.\", went out of business. Defying advice to fold the company, Michael found a replacement distributor within six weeks.\n\nIn late 1996, amid Golden Books negotiations to buy Nelvana, Hirsh went against his co-founders' advice and declined the offer. This led to the now infamous argument with the then COO of the company, Eleanor Olmstead, in which the normally mild-mannered Hirsh and Olmstead were reportedly heard \"swearing up and down the hallway at one another\". After remaining unaware for some time, Golden Books eventually walked out of the C$140 million deal in light of the internal discord.\n\nIn 1997, Hirsh and Nelvana helped found Teletoon along with fellow Canadian children's television production company Cinar.\n\nIn September 2000, Hirsh sold the Nelvana holdings to Corus Entertainment for C$540 million. Two years later, he was the last of the original founders to leave the studio, though the Corus press release stated that he had decided to take on an advisory role in the company.\n\nIn 2004, Hirsh reestablished himself in the children's television market when he led a consortium which acquired the remains of Cinar after a financial scandal had brought that company to ruin. Cinar was bought for C$190 million and Hirsh became CEO of the new company rebranded \"Cookie Jar Entertainment\".\n\nSince then, the Cookie Jar Group has been expanding in both Canada and the United States. In 2008, Cookie Jar merged with DIC Entertainment in an estimated US$87.6 million buyout, forming one of the world's largest privately held children's entertainment companies.\n\nIn 2012, Cookie Jar Entertainment was acquired by DHX Media and Hirsh became Executive Chairman of DHX Media. The combined company has a children's library of 8000 episodes and is the largest supplier of kids programming to online streaming services, as well as a leader in production and licensing and merchandising for children.\n\nNear the end of 2015, three years after DHX Media's acquisition of Cookie Jar, Hirsh left to found a new production company called Ezrin Hirsh Entertainment with music producer Bob Ezrin. Ezrin Hirsh and producer/entrepreneur Fred Seibert (and his company Frederator Networks, Inc.) together worked out an arrangement with Vancouver's Rainmaker Entertainment and on 26 October 2016 Rainmaker purchased the companies and also announced that Rainmaker's assets will consolidate its divisions under a new holding company called WOW! Unlimited Media Inc. Hirsh will serve as CEO and chairman for the holding company, with Seibert as Chief Creative Officer and CEO of Frederator.\n\nA number of productions that Michael has been involved with have been nominated for or won awards. For their work on shows including \"Beetlejuice\", \"Babar\", \"Little Bear\", \"Rupert\", \"Franklin\", \"Rolie Polie Olie\" and \"The Adventures of Tintin\", Hirsh and his colleagues have received awards such as Daytime Emmys and Geminis.\n\n"}

After this, Arsames most likely retired to his family estate in the Persian heartland of Parsa, and lived out the rest of his long years there peacefully, though he may nominally have exercised the duties of a \"lesser king\" under the authority of the \"Great King\". In an inscription allegedly found in Hamadan he is called \"king of Persia\", but some scholars believe it is a fraud, either modern or ancient. Another attestation of his reign is the Behistun Inscription, where his grandson Darius I lists him among his royal forebears and counts him among the eight kings who preceded him.\n\nArsames was the father of Hystaspes, satrap of Parthia, of Pharnaces, satrap of Phrygia and of Megabates, general. Arsames would live to see his grandson, Darius I, become the Great King of the Persian Empire, though he would die during his reign.

The 2nd Earl was murdered by George Gordon, Earl of Huntly, as the culmination of a vendetta. Known as \"the Bonnie Earl\" for his good looks, he became the subject of a popular ballad, \"The Bonnie Earl of Moray\".\n\nHe was the eldest son of James Stewart, and was a male-line descendant of Robert II of Scotland's second son, the Duke of Albany, through an illegitimate line. His father was created Lord Doune on 24 November 1581. From his distant relative King James VI, he received in the year 1580 a gift of the ward and marriage of the two daughters of the Regent Moray. In January 1581 he married Elizabeth Stewart, the elder daughter. The wedding was celebrated on 31 January in Fife with a tournament of \"running at the ring\" and James VI of Scotland took part. Two day after the party came to Leith, where a water pageant culminated with a theatrical assault on a Papal Castel Sant'Angelo, built on boats on the water of Leith Some of her relatives thought the Lord Doune's son was not of sufficient status to marry her. He soon after assumed, \"jure uxoris\", the title of the Earl of Moray. Stewart held the office of Collector General, receiving income from the church.\n\nStewart was an extremely ambitious man who aimed to make himself the most powerful lord in the north-east at the expense of his neighbour, the Earl of Huntly. On 1 August 1588 he was appointed a commissioner for executing the act against the Spanish armada, and on 5 March 1590 was commissioned to execute the acts against the Jesuits. He then foolishly entered into an alliance with his wife's famous cousin Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell who was a notorious conspirator greatly feared by the King. In late 1590 he decided, along with the Earl of Atholl, to assist the Laird of Grant when his house was being besieged by Huntly; Huntly retreated to Edinburgh and on 23 January 1591 presented a supplication against Moray for his \"having taken part with the malefactors in the north\", both earls were then commanded to proceed to Edinburgh and sign bands to keep the peace.\n\nHuntly then obtained a special commission to pursue Bothwell and his associates, whom the King feared were planning a rebellion. To prevent Bothwell from obtaining shelter with the Earl of Moray, a distant cousin and ally, Moray was induced by Lord Ochiltree, who was specially deputed by the King, to come south on the condition of receiving a pardon. It is claimed in the traditional ballad that James was jealous of Moray's favour with his Queen, Anne of Denmark, on account of his good looks. Moray, in expectation of a summons to the court, had arrived at Donibristle, a house of his mother on the Fife coast, when on 7 February 1592 it was suddenly beset by the followers of Huntly, who called on him to surrender. He declined to do so, and Huntly set fire to the house. Moray stayed for a time inside, and, suddenly dashing out, he broke through the cordon surrounding the house, and made for the rocks on the seashore. The glow of his burning helmet tassle, however, was said to have betrayed his location and he was killed. The corpses of the earl and of Dunbar, Sheriff of Moray, who was also killed, were brought by the earl's mother to Leith to be placed in the tomb of the Regent Moray in the Church of St. Giles; but for some months they remained in their coffins unburied, their friends refusing to bury them until the killing was punished. Captain Gordon, one of Huntly's followers, who being wounded was unable to escape to the north, was brought to Edinburgh and executed; but this was not enough to satisfy popular feeling, and the King deemed it prudent to retire from Edinburgh to Glasgow, until Huntly entered himself in ward in Blackness Castle. This Huntly did on 12 March, but on the 20th he was released on giving surety that on six days' notice he would appear and stand his trial whenever called on to do so. This murder remains famous to this day as the earl was just 27 years old at the time of his death and his murderer's punishment was a mere week-long house arrest.\n\nBy his wife, Elizabeth Stewart, whom he married between 23 January 1580 and 1581 and who died three months before he did, he had two sons and three daughters:\n\n"}

Although it is part of the Region of Peel, policing for the Town of Caledon, which is north of Brampton, is the responsibility of the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP). The village of Snelgrove was once part of Caledon, but is now within Brampton, and is within the jurisdiction of the Peel force.\n\nThe PRP also patrol the section of Highway 409 between the Toronto-Peel border (immediately west of Highway 427) and Pearson Airport. Policing of all other 400-series highways that pass through the region, including highways 401, 403, 410, and 427 as well as the QEW freeway and the 407 ETR toll highway, are the responsibility of the OPP.\n\nThe Peel Regional Police were established in tandem with the creation of the Regional Municipality of Peel on January 1, 1974. It integrated the former police departments of Mississauga, Port Credit, Streetsville, Brampton, and Chinguacousy.\n\nThe Toronto Township Police Department was formed in January 1944 and was later renamed \"Mississauga Police Department\" in 1968. The Brampton Police Department dates to 1873, when it was created to replace policing from Chinguacousy. The Chinguacousy Township Police traces its roots back to 1853.\nAreas north of Mayfield Road and not within Snelgrove were transferred to the OPP. The Port Credit Police Department was founded with the township's incorporation in 1909. The Streetsville Police Department was formed in 1858.\n\nAll the police departments were together merged into the Peel Regional Police Service in 1974. As of 2020, the Peel Regional Police have approximately 2,000 officers and 800 civilian support staff. Since the creation of the Peel regional police force, six deaths have been recorded, five from traffic accidents (the latest in March 2010) and one from a stabbing in 1984.\n\nThe Peel Regional Police divide the region into five divisions. Major police stations are located in each division which is supported by smaller community police stations. These provide residents with services to deal with traffic complaints, neighbourhood disputes, minor thefts, community issues, landlord-tenant disputes, found property, and doubts or questions related to policing in the community.\n\nCommanded by Superintendent Heather Ramore\n\n\nCommanded by Superintendent Robert Ryan\n\nThe Marine Unit at 135 Lakefront Promenade is located in this division.

Founded in 1976 (the same year the death penalty was reinstated by the Supreme Court of the United States) by Henry Schwarzschild, the NCADP is the only fully staffed nationwide organization in the United States dedicated to the total abolition of the death penalty. It also provides extensive information regarding imminent and past executions, death penalty defendants, numbers of people executed in the U.S., as well as a detailed breakdown of the current death row population, and a list of which U.S. state and federal jurisdictions use the death penalty. One of this group's founding members was Hugo Adam Bedau, the Austin B. Fletcher Professor of Philosophy at Tufts University before he died in 2012 at the age of 85.\n\nNCADP works to abolish the death penalty in the United States and supports efforts to abolish the death penalty worldwide.\n\nProviding education and outreach to state and local affiliates is a key priority for the national office.

Additionally, NCADP holds annual conferences and training for staff and volunteers.\n\nNCADP is dedicated to the abolition of the death penalty. Below are some of the reasons the organization believes in this doctrine:\n\n1) Executions are carried out at a high cost to tax payers\n\n2) Capital punishment does not deter crime\n\n3) States cannot prevent execution of innocent people\n\n4) Race plays a role in who lives and dies\n\n5) Capital punishment is applied arbitrarily\n\n6) The United States keeps company with the top human rights abusers as a country that employs executions\n\n7) Poor legal representation is a persistent problem\n\n8) Life without parole is an appropriate alternative to capital punishment\n\n9) Capital punishment goes against almost every major religion\n\n10) Millions of dollars could be diverted to helping the families of murder victims\n\nThe NCADP uses a number of non-violent methods to draw attention to, and advance, their campaign at local, state and national levels:\n\n1) Promotion of anti-death penalty legislation and pressuring state legislators for abolition or moratorium bills through letter writing and campaigning.\n\n2) Using local and state media to disseminate information about the death penalty.\n\n3) Using their numerous links with like-minded organizations to speak and act against the death penalty.\n\n4) Networking with these organizations on campaigns.\n\n5) Hosting annual conferences to promote networking among members and like-minded organizations.\n\n6) Incorporating social networking sites to foster networking and facilitate coordination of activity in local communities.\n\n7) Focusing on the human rights violations which are widely thought to be inherent in the death penalty.\n\n8) Selling anti-death penalty clothing, bumper stickers, and pins to promote campaign ideals.\n\nThe Texas Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty \nThe Texas Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty (TCADP) is a grassroots Texas organization that works to end the death penalty. TCADP is an affiliate of the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty and the World Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty.

The main focus of the NM Repeal is to abolish the death penalty and replace it with the sentencing of life without the possibility of parole. The NM Repeal is founded on six principles: Victims' Families first, Innocence, Fairness, Cost, Deterrence, and International. These principles are the justification given to other people for education as to why individuals should support \"repeal\" of capital punishment. The organization educates the community on the effects of the death penalty on victims and their families, as well as on convicts and their families.\nNorth Carolina Coalition for a Moratorium \nThe North Carolina coalition for a Moratorium (NC Moratorium) is based in Durham, North Carolina but works closely with the Western and Eastern areas of the state. The NC Moratorium hosts a campaign that is non-partisan, housing members that are Democrats and Republicans. The mission of the campaign is to abolish the Death penalty and to eliminate \"the arbitrariness, racial disparities, hidden evidence and classist approach that has characterized NC's death penalty since its inception\" as quoted on the North Carolina Coalition for a Moratoriums' official website. The campaign states that it needs a moratorium in North Carolina to temporarily suspend executions while the legislature reconstructs the Capital Punishment process. , North Carolina has put a hold on executions as the state legislature debates whether or not lethal injection is considered unconstitutional, how the act will be carried out, and whether a doctor should be present during a lethal injection procedure.\nProject Hope to Abolish the Death Penalty\nProject Hope to Abolish the Death Penalty( Project Hope) is an organization established in 1989 in the state of Alabama. It is a non-profit, non-denominational religious organization founded and operated by Death Row inmates. Project Hope strives to educate the public on the death penalty and to raise awareness to gain support for abolition of the death penalty in Alabama. Project Hope publishes a newsletter, \"Wings of Hope,\" four times a year. Articles are written by current inmates on death row. The publication is offered to the public, and it discusses the number of executions that has been committed in the State of Alabama or autobiographical stories of the inmates on death row. Project Hope uses Wings of Hope to educate the \"outside\" world on executions that occur in the state of Alabama. This organization has also taken strides to establish a moratorium in Alabama.\n\nNew Yorkers Against the Death Penalty\nThe New Yorkers Against the Death Penalty (NYADP) is a grassroots organization formed in 1992 that advocates through education to abolish capital punishment. It has local chapters in Albany, Buffalo, Ithaca, Long Island, Mid-Hudson, Nassau County, New York City, Rochester, Syracuse, and Westchester. In 2007, the NYADP was successful in gaining abolition of the death penalty by the state legislature. Most of the bill's supporters wanted to establish a sentence of life without parole as the alternative. The NYADP has stated that they have revamped their mission statement to bring together victims, law enforcement, advocates for the mentally ill, restorative justice practitioners, and families of the incarcerated, around policies that address needs and reduce the likelihood of violent crime.\nWashington Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty\nThe Washington Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty (WCADP) aspires to abolish the death penalty by educating, advocating, and informing the public as well as political leaders. WCADP publishes newsletters, supports Washington's death row inmates, organizes activities that are anti-death penalty, and works with the media to gain coverage on the cause.\n\nMissourians to Abolish the Death Penalty \nThe Missourians to Abolish the Death Penalty (MADP) was founded in 1987 to oppose the death penalty in the state. It has chapters in Kansas City, Springfield, St. Louis and Columbia, twenty-one affiliate groups, and individuals across the state who support abolition of the death penalty. The coalition organizes opposition to the death penalty, works with state legislators to pass a moratorium, educates state residents, monitors events pertaining capital punishment, advocates alternatives other than death as punishment for crimes; and supports death row prisoners, victims and their family members as well as others affected by the action of death penalty.\n\nOther Affiliate groups in the United States not listed above can be found at the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty website.\n\nWith its \"Stop Killing the Kids Campaign,\" NCADP played a paramount role in the abolition of the death penalty for juveniles in the United States. The campaign encouraged NCADP staff to work with citizens in South Dakota and Wyoming to pass measures to ban the death penalty for crimes committed by those under the age of 18. Additionally, the victories in South Dakota and Wyoming added to evidence for the Supreme Court to rule that the death penalty for juvenile offenders violated the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.\n\nA Wisconsin ballot initiative attempted to revive the death penalty after more than 100 years, however, after NCADP's successful campaigning with local activists, the initiative was defeated.\n\nFunding for NCADP mostly comes from voluntary contributions made to the organization while the least amount of money comes from membership dues. The greatest expenses NCADP spends their money on is for program expenses to promote their campaigns.\n\n\n"}

It comprises 96,000 acres (332 km) of wild land administered by the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency (TWRA). The Management Area is funded by hunters and fishermen, and is popular with all outdoors enthusiasts, including backpackers, and whitewater rafters. It has many trails for hiking, of which the most notable is the Cumberland Trail. It also has gravel roads and dirt track four-wheel drive roads for motorized exploration. Catoosa ranges from gentle rolling hills to some of the most rugged and extreme terrain in the country. Many rivers and streams have cut deep canyons into the Cumberland Plateau and Cumberland Mountains of the Management area allowing for beautiful vistas.\n\nCatoosa and several other WMAs are closed to entry between sunset and sunrise in order to reduce the effect of the activities that are considered incompatible to established wildlife management practices. Because WMAs were purchased with funds generated by hunters, the TWRA regards hunting as the main priority on these areas. Off-road vehicles and horses are permitted, but only on certain roads and trails. Overnight camping is allowed on designated areas by permission of the area manager.\n\nThe Catoosa WMA lies within the Emory River drainage, which is divided by a number of major stream drainages, including the Obed River, Daddy's Creek, Clear Creek, and Otter Creek. The Emory River meets the Obed River in the southeast corner of the area. The terrain is moderately rolling, ranging in elevation from to , with deep canyons cut by the streams.\n\nOver 98 percent of the WMA is forested and the wildlife populations have been restored. The healthy deer herd regularly produces trophy bucks for hunters, and wild turkey numbers are growing fast. Other game animals include European wild boar, fox squirrels, gray squirrels, ruffed grouse, raccoons, quail, rabbits, and mourning doves. Game fish include smallmouth bass, rock bass, bluegill, and muskellunge.\n\nMan's first use of the plateau was as hunting grounds. Artifacts found in caves and rock shelters suggest Mississippian and later Cherokee hunters camped here but never established permanent dwellings. The hunting grounds were visited seasonally by the Cherokees, Choctaws, Chickasaws, and Shawnees, and were the subject of repeated conflicts. In the eighteenth century, longhunters came to hunt game, and English, Scots-Irish and German settlers settled in small hamlets mostly in the valleys.\n\nIn 1797, Francis Bailey wrote, \"...about five o'clock we arrived at Crab Orchard. Here we found a large plain or natural meadow, containing many hundred acres covered throughout its whole extent with a tall, rich grass.\" Two years later, in 1799, Martin Steiner wrote, \"...then we crossed barren hills where only bushes grew. Now and then one saw a little tree.\" There were many other such accounts indicating the open nature of the terrain and the presence of great herds of elk, deer, and bison.\n\nEcologists believe the prairie-like environment arose from lightning-caused wildfire and grazing by megafauna. This natural community was maintained by periodic burning by the Native Americans. The plateau reforested when early European settlers began practicing fire suppression. The white settlers visited the high country occasionally to mine coal and harvest timber before major industry came to the area with the first lumber mill in the 1870s. By 1911, two coal and lumber companies had formed a syndicate that exploited the region until the main bridges on their rail lines were destroyed by a flood in 1929. As the companies cleared the woodland they leased these lands to small farms for arable and animal farming.\n\nThe Great Depression prevented the industrial companies from reinvesting in the repair of their railroads and businesses began to fail. In 1940 the Crossville Exchange Club appointed a committee to encourage the state to purchase some of the abandoned land for a wildlife management area. The Conservation Commission bought 63,000 acres (250 km) from the Tennessee Mineral and Lumber Company in 1942 using Pittman–Robertson federal aid funds. In 1949 the Tennessee Game and Fish Commission, now the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency (TWRA), established a tentative purchase boundary encompassing some 90,000 acres (360 km) within which they began to eliminate interior holdings through a land acquisition program. this program was still in train.\n\n"}

His parents were both Irish immigrants, and his brother Bernard was also a priest who served as superintendent of schools in the Archdiocese of San Francisco. He received his early education at the parochial school of St. Augustine's Church in Oakland. He began his studies for the priesthood at St. Joseph's College (California) in Mountain View, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1949. He completed his theological studies at St. Patrick's Seminary in Menlo Park, earning a Master of Divinity degree in 1953.\n\nOn January 24, 1953, Cummins was ordained a priest by Bishop Hugh Aloysius Donohoe at the Cathedral of St. Mary of the Assumption. His first assignment was as a curate at Mission Dolores Basilica in San Francisco, where he remained for four years. He also served as chaplain at the Newman Centre of San Francisco State University. He taught at Bishop O'Dowd High School in Oakland from 1957 until 1962, when he became chancellor of the Diocese of Oakland. He was named a domestic prelate in 1963.\n\nIn addition to his duties as chancellor, Cummins coordinated the Social Justice and Ecumenical Commissions, and oversaw the diocesan insurance program.

Especially as our political discourse addresses the very real concerns about the security of our country, our families, and our values, we need to remember that religious rights are a cornerstone of these values. Restricting or sacrificing these religious rights and liberties out of fear – instead of defending them and protecting them in the name of mutual respect and justice – is a rationalization which fractures the very foundation of morality on which we stand.

{"id": "1940721", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1940721", "title": "Oberto (opera)", "text": "Oberto (opera)\n\nOberto, Conte di San Bonifacio is an opera in two acts by Giuseppe Verdi to an Italian libretto by Temistocle Solera, based on an existing libretto by Antonio Piazza probably called \"Rocester\".\n\nIt was Verdi's first opera, written over a period of four years, and was first performed at the Teatro alla Scala, Milan, on 17 November 1839. The La Scala production enjoyed \"a fair success\" and the theatre's impresario, Bartolomeo Merelli, commissioned two further operas from the young composer.\n\nDuring his student days in Milan, Verdi began the process of making connections to the world of music in that city which were to stand him in good stead. These included an introduction by his teacher Lavigna to an amateur choral group, the Società Filarmonica, where he functioned as rehearsal director and continuo player for Haydn's \"The Creation\" in 1834, as well as conducting Rossini's \"La cenerentola\" himself the following year. 1836 saw his involvement in an April concert celebrating Emperor Ferdinand's birthday; for this he wrote a cantata in the Emperor's honour which received some praise.\n\nBut it was after his return to his hometown of Busseto in 1835 to become director of the music school with a three-year contract that Verdi took advantage of the connection he had made to the Filarmonica's director, Pietro Massini. In a series of letters from 1835 to 1837 he informed him about the progress towards writing his first opera using a libretto supplied by Massini which had been written by Antonio Piazza, a Milanese \"journalist and man of letters\" . By then it had been given the title of \"Rocester\" and the young composer expressed hopes of a production in Parma.\n\nHowever, Parma was not interested in new works and so approaches were made to Milan. Whether \"Rocester\" actually became the basis for \"Oberto\" when Verdi was able to return to Milan in February 1839 after fulfilling two and a half years of his contract in Busseto is subject to some disagreement amongst scholars. How much of \"Rocester\" remained visible in \"Oberto\" is discussed by Roger Parker, who does suggest that \"in this shape-shifting tendency, the opera was, of course, very much of its time.\"\n\nIn his recollections in 1881 (quoted in Budden) following his return to Milan from Busseto in 1838, Verdi describes how he was invited to meet the La Scala impresario, Bartolomeo Merelli, who had heard a conversation about the music of the opera between soprano Giuseppina Strepponi and Giorgio Ronconi in which she praised it. Merelli then offered to put on \"Oberto\" during the 1839 season and, after its premiere, \"Oberto\" was given a respectable 13 additional performances.\n\nAs noted by Roger Parker, the opera, while having a somewhat limited success at La Scala, did receive revivals over the following three years, during which Verdi took the opportunity to compose new numbers or supply new or revised music to fit particular voices. It appeared in Turin and Milan in 1840, the latter in the autumn after the failure of Verdi's second opera, \"Un giorno di regno\"; again, it was seen in Naples and Genoa (both in 1841), and in Barcelona in 1842.\n\nThe opera was staged in Parma on 6 September 1913, \n\nThree opera companies, which plan to present all of Verdi's operas, have given this opera recently. Companies which intend to present all of the composer's works have included \"Oberto\" in their schedules in recent years. These are Sarasota Opera which staged it in 2001 as part of their \"Verdi Cycle\"; the ABAO in Bilbao, Spain, gave performances in January 2007, as part of their \"Tutto Verdi\" series; and the Teatro Regio di Parma gave it in October 2007 as part of their on-going \"Festival Verdi\". In 2010 the Berliner Operngruppe under Felix Krieger presented the work in a concert performance in Berlin.\n\nIn celebration of the Verdi bicentennial, it was staged by La Scala in April/May 2013.\n\nBefore the action takes place, a battle has been fought between Oberto, Count of San Boniface, and the Salinguerra, led by Ezzelino da Romano. Oberto has lost and has retreated to Mantua. Meanwhile, his daughter Leonora has been seduced and abandoned by Riccardo, Count of Salinguerra, and Riccardo is about to marry Cuniza, Ezzelino's sister. Leonora makes her way to Bassano on Riccardo's wedding day, intent on confronting him.\n\n\"Scene 1: The countryside near Bassano\"\n\nRiccardo is welcomed by a chorus as he is about to enter Ezzelino's palace. He sings of his joy at being close to Cuniza (\"Son fra voi! Già sorto è il giorno...Già parmi udire il fremito\" – \"Here I am amongst you! The day hasted by my desire has now arrived\"). They enter the castle. Leonora arrives swearing to avenge Riccardo's desertion and she sings of the love which she had and a hope of recovering those innocent days (\"Sotto il paterno tetto...Oh potessi nel mio core\"- \"Beneath my father's roof an angel appeared to me\"). She leaves to go towards the village.\nHer father, Oberto, arrives, pleased to be back in his home country but unsure of Leonora's whereabouts. When Leonora returns, each is aware of the other's presence and father and daughter are reunited. They express amazement at having found each other again. But Oberto's initial anger at Leonora's actions quickly turns to fatherly affection as the pair makes plans to disrupt the wedding.\n\n\"Scene 2: A room in Ezzelino's palace\"\n\nThe chorus sings a welcome to the happy bride but, alone with Riccardo, Cuniza expresses some forebodings in spite of expressing her love for him. (\"Questa gioia che il petto m'inonda\" – \"This joy that overwhelms my breast is mingled with a mysterious fear\").\n\nAfter the couple leaves, Leonora enters and is questioned by Imelda. Leonora tells her that her father, Oberto, is also in the palace and, when he enters, she tells Cuniza about her betrayal by Riccardo. Cuniza agrees to help them.\n\nShe then hides Oberto in a nearby room and invites Riccardo and his guests to join her. Upon entering, Cuniza reveals Leonora's presence and accuses her lover of infidelity. Riccardo's accusations against Leonora prompt her father to enter and challenge Riccardo to a duel.\n\n\"Scene 1: The princess's private apartments\"\n\nCuniza and Imelda are alone and the servant announces that Riccardo wishes to speak to her mistress. Cuniza laments the love she had, but following her aria, \"Oh, chi torna l'ardente pensiero\" – \"Oh, who can turn my fevered thoughts\", she instructs Imelda to tell Riccardo that he should return to Leonora, concluding in \"Più che i vezzi e lo splendore\" – \"More persuasive to my conscience\" that she has made the right decision.\n\n\"Scene 2: A remote place near the castle gardens\"\n\nThe courtiers gather and express their sympathy for Leonora's plight. As they leave, Oberto enters, waiting for his rival to appear. He proclaims that he will seek vengeance: (Aria: \"L'orror del tradimento\" – \"The horror of his betrayal\"). The courtiers return to tell him that Cuniza has interceded on his behalf and that he has nothing to fear from Riccardo, but Oberto's thoughts still focus on vengeance. Riccardo finally arrives and they begin to fight, but are soon stopped by Cuniza who arrives with Leonora. Cuniza insists that Riccardo admit his infidelity and agrees to marry Leonora. Still determined to fight his rival, Oberto extracts an agreement from Riccardo that they will soon meet in the woods. Oberto leaves the group to go into the woods; all leave. Offstage, the sound of a duel in progress can be heard and it is followed by Riccardo's arrival. He realizes that he has killed Oberto (Aria: \"Ciel che feci?\" – \"Heavens, what have I done!\") and he is filled with remorse. Then Imelda and Cuniza appear explaining that Leonora is prostrate over the dead body of her father. Soon a letter arrives from Riccardo explaining that he has gone into exile leaving everything he possesses to Leonora. In her grief, she announces that she will become a hermit.\n\nContemporary critical reactions to Verdi's first effort were mixed, as noted by scholar Francis Toye, writing in 1931, when he quoted two Milanese critics:\n\nJulian Budden comments on the performance reviews of the time, especially one which indicates that Verdi's music was not inspired by Donizetti, Bellini, Mercadante nor Rossini, and he states \"in detail it owes a little to all of them. But what finally emerges is often subtly different, with a flavour of its own. Above all, it has that ultra-Verdian quality of gathering momentum as it proceeds.\"\n\nGiven the need at the time for composers to take into account singers' strengths and weaknesses, Verdi's writing for the four principals (rather than the more conventional three of that era) who became the cast for the premiere of \"Oberto\" well accommodated the limitations of Mary Shaw's voice and played to the strengths of Antonietta Rainieri-Marini's in the lower register. Ignazio Marini, the bass who sang the title role, was \"a performer of impressive vocal and dramatic range, for whom Verdi would later write the title role of \"Attila\", notes Parker. He continues by adding that \"la Marini\" was undoubtedly grateful to Verdi in that it was she who quite probably helped to secure most of the revivals of the opera during the following few years where she appeared as Leonora in four of the five of them.\n\nAgreeing with Parker that the support given to \"la Marini\" helped with stagings of further performances from 1840 to 1843 (and, therefore, allowed the composer the opportunity to make additions and changes as these performances were played in different cities and with different singers).\n\nFor the 1840 revival after the failure of \"Un giorno di regno\", the role of Cuniza was sung by Luigia Abbadia and it was for her that Verdi wrote an entrance aria in act 1 and a duet for Cuniza and Riccardo also in act 1, the latter described as being \"full of that intensely condensed melodic expressiveness that will characterise the best of his early music. It is on quite a different level of invention from the rest of \"Oberto\".\n\nToye notes that, in spite of its weaknesses, the opera:\n\n2012 Michael Hofstetter conductor, Theater Gießen – Germany, Oberto: Adrian Ganz, Leonora: Franceska Lombardi, Cuniza: Manuela Custer, Riccardo: Norman Reinhardt, Imelda: Naroa Intxausti, Concert Version Stadttheater Giessen, OEHMS Classics OC959 2CDs\n\nThe historical Cunizza da Romano, whose life was as at least as interesting as this fictionalised account.\n\nNotes\n\nCited sources\n\nOther sources\n\n"}

His second single \"Shining\" peaked at #13 whilst the album \"Some Day Soon\" was certified gold selling in excess of 150,000 copies.\n\nLeontiou toured the album in November 2004 taking him to the US to work with L.A Reid, Chairman of the Island Def Jam music group. Unhappy with the direction his career was going, on a flight back from the US in 2004 he decided to take his music in a new direction. Splitting from his label in late 2005, he went on to collaborate with Faithless on the song \"Hope & Glory\" for their album ‘'To All New Arrivals'’. It was this release that saw him unleash the One eskimO moniker. It was through working with Rollo Armstrong on the Faithless album, that Rollo got to hear an early demo of \"Astronauts\" from the One eskimO project. Being more than impressed by what he heard, Rollo opened both his arms and studio doors to Leontiu and they began to co-produce the ‘'All Balloons’' album.\n\nIt was at this time that he paired up with good friend Adam Falkner, a drummer/musician, to introduce a live acoustic sound to the album. They recorded the album with engineer Phill Brown (engineer for Bob Marley and Robert Plant) at Ark studios in St John's Wood where they recorded live then headed back to Rollo's studio to add the cinematic electro touches that are prominent on the album.\n\nShortly after its completion, One eskimO's \"Hometime\" was used on a Toyota Prius advert in the USA. The funds from the advert were then used to develop the visual aspect of One eskimO. He teamed up with friend Nathan Erasmus (Gravy Media Productions) along with animation team Smuggling Peanuts (Matt Latchford and Lucy Sullivan) who together began to develop the One eskimO world, the first animation produced was for the track ‘Hometime’ which went on to win a British animation award in 2008.\n\nIn 2008 Leontiou started a new management venture with ATC Music. By mid-2008 Time Warner came on board to develop all 10 One eskimO animations which were produced the highly regarded Passion Pictures in London. Now with all animation complete and a debut album, One eskimO prepare to unveil themselves fully to the world in summer 2009.\n\nMurder victim Meredith Kercher made a cameo appearance in the music video for Kristian Leontiou's song \"Some Say\" in 2004, 3 years before she was found dead in Italy.\n\nLeontiou released a cover version of Tracy Chapman's \"Fast Car\", which was originally released as a single in 2005. Leontiou's version was unable to chart, however, due to there being no simultaneous physical release alongside the download single, a UK chart rule that was in place at the time. On 24 April 2011, the song entered the singles chart at number 88 due to \"Britain's Got Talent\" contestant Michael Collings covering the track on the show on 16 April 2011.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1940733", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1940733", "title": "Clerical collar", "text": "Clerical collar\n\nA clerical collar, clergy collar, Roman collar or dog collar is an item of Christian clerical clothing. The collar closes at the back of the neck, presenting a seamless front. The shirt may have the collar built in. The clerical collar is almost always white and was originally made of cotton or linen but is now frequently made of plastic. Sometimes it is attached with a \"collaret\" or \"collarino\" that covers the white collar almost completely, except for a small white square at the base of the throat, and sometimes with the top edge of the collar exposed to mimic the collar of a cassock. It may simply be a detachable tab of white in the front of the clerical shirt. The clerical shirt is traditionally black (or another color appropriate to a person's ministry rank, such as purple for Anglican bishops), but today is available in a variety of colors depending on the wearer's preference. Once the clerical collar is removed the garment is indistinguishable from any other shirt. When clergy are delivering sermons, they sometimes attach preaching bands to their clerical collar.\n\nAccording to the Church of England's Enquiry Centre (citing the \"Glasgow Herald\" of December 6, 1894), the detachable clerical collar was invented in 1865 by the Rev. Donald Mcleod, a Church of Scotland (Presbyterian) minister in Glasgow.\n\nBy 1840, Anglican clergy developed a sense of separation between themselves and the secular world. One outward symbol of this was the adoption of distinctive clerical dress. This had started with the black coat and white necktie which had been worn for some decades. By the 1880s this had been transmuted into the clerical collar, which was worn almost constantly by the majority of clergy for the rest of the period.\n\nHenry McCloud stated that the collar \"was nothing else than the shirt collar turned down over the cleric's everyday common dress in compliance with a fashion that began toward the end of the sixteenth century. For when the laity began to turn down their collars, the clergy also took up the mode.\" Invented in the Presbyterian Church, the clerical collar was adopted by other Christian denominations, including the Catholic Church, Anglican Church, Methodist churches, Eastern Orthodox Church, Baptist churches and the Lutheran churches. Prior to the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965) the practice of Catholic clergy wearing the clerical collar as street-dress tended to be found only in those countries where Catholicism was the minority religion. It was mandatory for U.S. Catholic priests starting in 1884. In the 1960s, many clergy who lived in countries where Catholicism was the dominant religion also began to wear the clerical collar rather than the soutane or cassock.\n\nIn the Reformed tradition, which stresses preaching as a central concern, pastors often don preaching tabs, which project from their clerical collar. Preaching bands (an alternative name for tabs) are also worn by Anglican clergy, particularly on occasions such as inductions when choir dress of cassock, surplice, preaching scarf and the academic hood pertaining to degree is worn, as well as at Mattins and Evensong. Methodist and Lutheran clergy also sometimes attach preaching bands to their clerical collars.\n\nIn the Catholic Church, the clerical collar is worn by all ranks of clergy, thus: bishops, priests, and deacons, and often by seminarians who have been admitted to candidacy for the priesthood as well as with their cassock during liturgical celebrations.\n\nAmong the Eastern Catholic Churches and Eastern Orthodox Church a band collarette with no \"notch\" in front may be worn by seminarians, although the norm is still a standard clerical collar. However, as the cassock is more commonly, if not mandatorily, worn to classes, often a plain white shirt will suffice, or a band collar with no collarette. Slavic cassocks button to the side, and thus a collar is often pointless, whereas a Greek cassock buttons to the front and has a higher collar, so the collar prevents chafing—as was its original function under a cassock. Eastern deacons and sometimes subdeacons, but rarely readers or other minor clerics, also wear a clerical collar, with subdeacons and readers often having a style with no notch, or a tab shirt with no tab. Most Orthodox clerics do not wear a clerical collar; those who do are usually to be found in Western Europe or North America.\nCollars are typically worn by clergy of other groups such as those of the Anglican, Methodist, Presbyterian and Lutheran traditions, although many Scandinavian Lutheran clergy wear the ruff instead. Also many Pentecostal and non-denominational Protestants, and others wear collars. In the Roman Catholic tradition, major seminarians, after receiving admission to candidacy (and thus becoming \"candidates\" for ordination), often wear clericals in the seminary or their dioceses.\nSome Unitarian Universalist ministers choose to wear a clerical collar along with a stole.\nIn the United Kingdom (and other British-influenced countries, such as Canada), clerical collars have been informally referred to as \"dog collars\" since the mid-nineteenth century. The term \"Roman collar\" is equivalent to \"clerical collar\" and does not necessarily mean that the wearer is Roman Catholic.\n\nIn the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, non-Christian clergy, such as some Jewish rabbis in England (such as Rabbi Abraham Cohen, the editor of the Soncino Books of the Bible) would also wear clerical collars. \n\nDuring the 1950s the Reverend Alec Vidler began to advocate the abolition of the clerical collar in favour of a black shirt and white tie, but whilst some clergy adopted this mode of dress it did not become widespread. \n\nNon-ordained clerics, such as Chaplains or Readers are not entitled to use the traditional clerical collar (i.e. black collar and white shirt or white collar and black shirt), but are increasingly using the same design shirt and collar as ordained priests, but with matching shirt and collar (i.e. white shirt with white collar and black shirt with black collar).\n\nMembers of religious orders will often wear a \"Brother's Collar\" or \"Brothers Collarette\" which is very similar to a typical clerical collar, but revealing a noticeably smaller amount of the white band.\n"}
{"id": "1940745", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1940745", "title": "Esmerine", "text": "Esmerine\n\nEsmerine is a Canadian modern chamber music group that incorporates genres such as drone music, post punk, and Turkish folk. Founded in Montreal in 2000 by Bruce Cawdron (drums) and Beckie Foon (cello), current members also include percussionist Jamie Thompson and multi-instrumentalist Brian Sanderson. The band has released five albums. \"Dalmak\", was awarded Instrumental Album of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2014. Their latest \"Lost Voices\" is nominated for Instrumental Album of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2016.\n\nThe chamber rock group Esmerine was formed in 2000, and was initially a duo consisting of percussionist Bruce Cawdron and cellist Rebecca Foon. The two had recently met in Montreal while both recording the debut album of Canadian post-rock band Set Fire To Flames. Cawdron and Foon had independently contributed to other Montreal-based groups as well, notably Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra & Tra-La-La Band, Saltland, Fifths of Seven and Mile-End Ladies' String Auxiliary. However, instead of using the guitar-focused sound of their other projects, the duo initially focused on percussion and cello, drawing on minimalist classical music and chamber music. The band initially performed their original music in gigs around Montreal.\n\nEsmerine recorded and released their debut album \"If Only a Sweet Surrender to the Nights to Come Be True\" in May 2003. It came out on the UK label Resonant Records, as well as the band's newly formed Madrona Records imprint. The album met with a largely positive reception. Allmusic gave it 4/5 stars, stating, \"A French female name meaning quiet and sensitive, Esmerine is a fitting moniker for the overall sound,\" and calling it \"a sublime chamber rock album that brings Rachel's or Wim Mertens to mind.\" While Allmusic described the later tracks as having rock influences, \"The three opening tracks are serene, melancholic, and well-composed, avoiding the quiet-loud-quiet or builds-to-crescendo device.\"\n\nIn 2004 the duo recorded their second album at the Hotel2Tango studio in Montreal. They released \"Aurora\" in May 2005 on Madrona Records, with a vinyl version released by Ninja Tune. In the mid-2000s Foon dedicated more time to Thee Silver Mt. Zion, while Cawdron continued to work as an acupuncutrist. At the same time they continued to occasionally perform in Montreal, often bringing in guest artists or collaborating with other groups.\n\nFoon and Cawdron began writing new music together in earnest in 2010. For their third album, \"La Lechuza\", two new members joined the group; Sarah Pagé, a harp player, and multi-instrumentalist Andrew Barr (both of The Barr Brothers and the Lhasa de Sela band). Album producer Patrick Watson also contributed vocals on two songs, with other guests including violinist Sarah Neufeld (Arcade Fire) and saxophonist Colin Stetson. Mark Lawson of Arcade Fire mixed most of the tracks. As part of \"La Lechuza\", Esmerine collaborated with Patrick Watson to honor their recently deceased friend Lhasa de Sela, creating the dedication website Snow Day for Lhasa. It was listed as one of the top ten underground records of the year in \"Mojo\".\n\nAfter Barr and Page became occupied with their other projects, Esmerine added two new members to their touring lineup: percussionist Jamie Thompson and multi-instrumentalist Brian Sanderson.\n\nAfter a number of live performances the quartet began writing new material in early 2012. After performing in Istanbul, the band was invited to return for an artist residency later that year. After turning a rented loft into a makeshift recording studio, the band recorded for two days in Istanbul. According to the band, \"We immersed ourselves in the culture of the city of Istanbul and the people whom we met there.\" The band's \"song skeletons\" were added to by Turkish musicians, who contributed instruments such as the bendir, darbuka, erbane, meh, barama, saz and electric guitar. Among the guest musicians were Hakan Vreskala, Baran Aşık, Ali Kazim Akdağ and James Hakan Dedeoğlu.\n\nThe album, \"Dalmak,\" was completed in the winter of 2012 and 2013, at Breakglass Studios in Montreal with engineer Jace Lasek. The word 'dalmak' means immerse in Turkish. It can also be interpreted as \"to dive into,\" \"to contemplate,\" and \"to be absorbed in.\"\n\n\"Dalmak\" was released on Constellation Records in 2013. It was awarded Instrumental Album of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2014. \"Tiny Mix Tapes\" gave \"Dalmak\" a score of 3/5. The review described the album as starting off with the band's normal style, before Turkish influences start to dominate in tracks such as \"Lost River Blues II.\" \"The Line of Best Fit\" gave it 7.5/10 stars, saying the members \"spin a fine web of noise – it’s fragile, tempestuous, pensive and sprawling – as they experiment with languid strains of clinical harmony, exploring avante-garde themes in neo-classical music, electronica and post-rock.\" The review further stated, \"they ultimately craft gorgeous, sparkling experimental noises that blur the line between post-rock, minimalist electronica and Turkish folk.\"\n\n\"Lost Voices\" was released on Constellation Records in 2015. It is nominated Instrumental Album of the Year at the upcoming Juno Awards of 2016. The band composed the record at Le Chateau Monthelon in Montreal. France. Lost Voices is the result of multiple recording sessions led by Vid Cousins (Kid Koala, Amon Tobin, Colin Stetson) and was mixed/produced by Jace Lasek (The Besnard Lakes) at his Breakglass Studio in Montréal. Expanding from Dalmak's core quartet, Esmerine also welcomes bassist Jeremi Roy (who began touring with the group in 2013) as an official member. Lost Voices is equally notable for the appearance of GY!BE/Silver Mt. Zion violinist Sophie Trudeau as a featured guest.\n\n\"Decoder Magazine\" has described Esmerine as \"new-classical, punk-drone-post rock.\" As a \"chamber rock\" ensemble, Esmerine's music consists mainly of percussion, cello, and marimba, lacking the guitars prominent in the members' other side projects. Esmerine's style shares many characteristics with minimalist classical music and chamber music.\n\nWhen the band tours live they are known to use lightbox projections by artist and puppeteer Clea Minaker, also known for working with Feist. In December 2013, the band toured Europe and the UK, with several Turkish musicians joining them on stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1940754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1940754", "title": "Feminist sociology", "text": "Feminist sociology\n\nFeminist sociology is a conflict theory and theoretical perspective which observes gender in its relation to power, both at the level of face-to-face interaction and reflexivity within a social structure at large. Focuses include sexual orientation, race, economic status, and nationality.\n\nCharlotte Perkins Gilman's (1860-1935) work helped formalize feminist theory during the 1960s. Growing up, she went against traditional holds that were placed on her by society by focusing on reading and learning concepts different from women who were taught to be housewives. Her main focus was on gender inequality between men and women along with gender roles placed on by society. Where men go to work secure proper income for the family while women stay at home and tend to the family along with household chores. She \"emphasized how differential socialization leads to gender inequality,\" but she did agree that biologically there is a difference between those born with female and male parts.\n\nParts of her research involved a theoretical orientation of a multidimensional approach to gender and discusses it more in depth in her book \"Women and Economics\". Due to gender roles she believed that women pretended to live a certain life to avoid achieving their full potential living the role of a housewife. This is an example of a neurological theory, as developed by Sigmund Freud, which is cultivated using a psychoanalysis process called conscious and subconscious state of mind. The specific example given would be considered falling under false consciousness instead of \"true\" consciousness. Leading the belief that women are viewed as property of their husbands, economically women were still dependent on husbands to provide financial support to themselves and their family. Gilman argued furthermore that the traditional division of labour was not biologically driven, but instead forced upon women based on the structure of society since before the nineteenth century.\n\nGilman described this as a \"sociobiological\" tragedy because women are disregarded as being part of the ideology of \"survival of the fittest\". Instead, females are thought to be soft and weak individuals that are only good for productive purposes, and are depicted as emotional and frail beings born to serve their husbands, children, and family without living for themselves. Gilman's research was conducted during a time where women engaged in science were unheard of and when women were barred from voting. Her research helped create a ripple effect, along with other female sociologists, that helped pave the way for feminism, and concepts related to feminist theory.\n\nThe study of sociology had been mostly androcentric up until the 1970s, when sociological thinking began to shift to focus on women. In 1963s, the Equal Pay Act, signed into law by John F. Kennedy, outlawed the wage disparity based on sex (Grady). The Equal Pay Act was one of the first ways that the United States began to shift its mentality about women's rights, how women should be treated in the workplace, and in society at large. While the Equal Pay Act focused solely on equal pay for equal work regardless of sex, Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act was passed in a fight against discrimination of any kind in the workplace. \n\nA major form of discrimination many women face in the workplace is sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is a form of illegal discrimination based on an abuse of power which can range from “inappropriate jokes” to “outright sexual assault” and more (Conley 312). While sexual harassment is not a form of discrimination uniquely faced by women, when it occurs in the workplace it often involves the subordination of women by a male superior or coworker. In the 1970s, many women fought for the right to dictate what happens to their body, such as establishing legal abortions, as well as making forced sterilization illegal (Grady). This shifted how Americans saw women, and the country began changing to allow women to have more control over their bodies.  \n\nStarting in the early 1990s, several instances of sexual harassment and abuse became well known and started a push for women to open about their own encounters with harassment. The allegations by Anita Young that Justice Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her was one of these instances. After Thomas was confirmed as a justice on the Supreme Court regardless of these allegations, more women began to speak out. In surveys taken after the hearings, it was reported that “between 40 and 65 percent of women claim to have experienced sexual harassment on the job” (Sapiro). This social shift led to a change in attitude over bodily autonomy, and boundaries within the workplace, and throughout life. Beginning in the mid 1990s, women began to come forward with sexual harassment complaints and sexual assault allegations against their male counterparts, which led to a movement of drastically increased numbers of women taking a stance against sexual violence, leading to society recognizing there is a fundamental problem concerning sexual harassment (Grady). This, in turn, led to another movement in recent years called the “Me Too Movement” that led many women to coming forward with their own stories and encounters, showing that sexual harassment affects women across the world.\n\nMany feminist sociologists argue that the intersectionality of women, especially when it comes to race, can no longer be ignored by the growing feminist movement. Due to the increase in popularity of this outlook, there has been a rise of transnational feminists stressing the idea that feminism should not be seen as an exclusively Western-centric idea, but that it must be able to adapt in order to incorporate the context and complications of individual cultures and traditions. The relationship between feminism and race was largely overlooked until the second wave of feminists produced greater literature on the topic of 'black feminism'. The second wave of feminists incorporated a \"new feminist theory\" known as including race, gender, and class to explain the oppression women of color face. This intersectionalist approach on feminist sociology allows for a type of “marriage” between the “gender/race/class dynamic,” rather than excluding individuals of different races, ethnicities, nationalities, social classes, gender, sexual orientation, or any other factors. Women who suffer from oppression due to race may find themselves in a double bind. The relationship between feminism and race was largely overlooked until the second wave of feminists produced greater literature on the topic of 'black feminism'.\n\nHistorically, the feminist movement, and the sociological feminist movement, has been lead by middle and upper class women from predominantly white backgrounds, causing the social trends of the movement to largely pass over the issues faced by women who do not fit into these tropes. This disregarding of the issues of intersectional women throughout the history of the feminist movement is due largely to the ignorance of the issues that these women face, and the assumption that the problems of white women within middle and upper-class homes are the problems of all women.\n\nAn ongoing debate in portions of transnational feminism surrounds the question of \"solidarity\", specifically as regards the general representation of women of the Global South. The question has been posed by a movement opposing the single minded outlook of second wave feminism, called Third World feminism. Because feminist movements are primarily led and operated by Western women who have sought to define themselves \"in relation to 'other' more oppressed women from non-Western countries.\" Consequently, this has rendered women from the Global South \"mere objects of their systems and institutions, victims of this never changing primitive force known as culture\", effectively erasing their struggles only to be \"replaced instead by the voices of Western feminists who want to save them.\"\n\nHowever, several African American women within the field of feminist theory have been crucial in revolutionizing the field in which they work. An instrumental contribution to the field was Kimberlé Crenshaw's seminal 1989 paper, \"Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics\" (Crenshaw 1989). In it she outlines the manner in which black women have been erased from feminist pedagogy. Black women must be understood as having multiple identities that intersect and reinforce one another, the two key experiences of being black and of being women. Furthermore, black women suffer on both racist and sexist fronts, marginalized not only by larger systems of oppression but by existing feminist discourse that disregards their intersectionality. Crenshaw's work is integral to understanding feminist sociology, as it advocated for black feminist thought and set the building blocks for future feminist sociologists such as Patricia Hill Collins.\n\nAnna Julia Cooper and Ida Bell Wells-Barnett are African American women who were instrumental in conducting much research and making valuable contributions in the field of black feminism. \"Cooper and Wells-Barnett both consciously drew on their lived experiences as African American women to develop a \"systematic consciousness of society and social relations.\" As such, these women foreshadow the development of a feminist sociological theory based in the interests of women of colour.\n\nThere are different models that attempt to describe the relationship between gender and stratification. One model is the sex-differences model which discusses the differences in behavior and attitude when called on the labels of male and female. Further, it is attempting to locate the true difference when all \"socialization is removed\". The inequalities that exist are due to many of the processes that are essential in normal socialization. However, these processes are removed. Another model is the sex-roles model which employs socialization, rather than ignoring it, to attempt to uncover the differences in gender and how people choose to identify to discover gender roles. Some sociologists do not agree with this sex-roles approach because it does not fall under the normal sociological “understanding of social roles”. This is because most express a connection between oneself and other people. However, the sex-roles approach discusses two “polarized and internally persistent sets of predispositions”. Most “theorists of gender do not agree on any one comprehensive theory of stratification”. Also, “feminist analyses have developed gender parallels to the critiques of models of race that fail to address inequality as a function of something other than “difference”. There are many different sociologists who argue that gender is organized \"differently for Whites and Blacks\" within race. These theorists continue to argue that gender also significantly impacts race differently for men and women. Similarly, gender also impacts the organization of class and class impacts the organization of gender.\n\nModern queer theory attempts to unmake the social and contextual elements reinforcing heteronormativity by challenging oppressive institutions on traditional binary distinctions between male and female, among its many other criticisms. In this regard, feminism and queer theory address the same ways social structures violently categorize and erase women and LGBTQIA+ from the social narrative. However, sociological feminism often reinforces the gender binary through the research process \"as the gendered subject is made the object of the study\" (McCann 2016, 229). Queer theory, by comparison, challenges the traditional ideas of gender through the deconstruction and lack of acceptance of a dichotomy of male and female traits. In her recent work \"Epistemology of the Subject: Queer Theory's Challenge to Feminist Sociology\", McCann confronts the theoretical perspective and methodology of feminist sociology:\"[the subject] rarely reflects the fluid, unstable, and dynamic realities of bodies and experiences. To “settle” on a subject category, then, is to reinscribe a fixity that excludes some, often in violent ways (for example, those who are literally erased because their bodies do not conform to a discrete binary)\" (McCann 2016, 231-232). There can be a refashioning of the field, where extending boundaries to include queer theory would \"develop new and innovative theoretical approaches to research...[and] address inequality within society\" (McCann 2016, 237).\n\nModern queer theory attempts to unmake the social and contextual elements reinforcing heteronormativity by challenging oppressive institutions on traditional binary distinctions between male and female, among its many other criticisms.

These critics believe that feminists should not push their views on other cultures because it forces western ideas on others. Feminists around the world argue that men are mistreating women in other countries, but the male elites around that world would justify their infringement on women's rights by passing it off as part of their culture (Moller Okin).  People with feminist ideals do not care about the backlash they get from world leaders and other countries. They believe that violations of women's rights should be prohibited all around the world, and their mission is to rid all cultural excuses for women's oppression (Moller Okin).\n\nThe remit of multiculturalism is to allow distinct cultures to reside in Western societies, or separate societies in general, and one possible consequence is that certain religious or traditional practices may negate Western feminist ideals. Central debates include the topics of arranged marriage and female genital mutilation. Others have argued that these debates stem from Western orientalism and general political reluctance to accept foreign migrants.\n\n\n"}

Also, since 2007 RAŚ organize in Poland every year \"\"Autonomy Marches\"\" (, ).\n\nThe movement participated in the 1991 parliamentary elections and received 40,061 votes (0.36%) and two seats, one of its MP was Kazimierz Świtoń.\n\nIn the 2001 parliamentary elections, two candidates of the movement were included on the lists of the Civic Platform (PO).\n\nIn the elections of 2005, several candidates from the movement, including its vice president Krzysztof Kluczniok, took part on the list of the Polish Peasant Party (PSL).\n\nIn the 2006 Polish local elections, the movement did not win a single seat in the sejmik of the Silesian Voivodeship, gaining 4.35% of the popular vote. It placed after main parties in Poland: Civic Platform (PO), Law and Justice (PiS), Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) and Polish People's Party (PSL), but ahead other main parties in Poland: Self-Defense of the Republic of Poland (Samoobrona), which won 3.96%, and the League of Polish Families (LPR), which won 3.46%. In Opole Voivodeship, RAŚ won 1.46% of all ballots.\nRAŚ won mandates in a few municipalities and county councils: in Katowice (7.7% of the popular vote), Ruda Śląska (9.39%), Zabrze (5.71%), Tychy (5.1%), Bytom (6.8%), Mysłowice (8.3%) and Gliwice county (7.54%), Bieruń-Lędziny county (10.4%), Tarnowskie Góry county (7.73%), Siemianowice Śląskie (4.94%), Piekary Śląskie (5.06%), Rybnik county (8.1%).\n\nIn the 2010 Polish local elections, the movement got three seats (for Jerzy Gorzelik, Henryk Mercik, Janusz Wita) in the sejmik of the Silesian Voivodeship, gaining 8.5% of the popular vote. It is twice the amount from previous elections (in 2006). It placed RAŚ after the main parties in Poland: Civic Platform (PO), Law and Justice (PiS) and Democratic Left Alliance (SLD), but ahead of other main National parties: Polish People's Party (PSL), Self-Defense of the Republic of Poland (Samoobrona) and the League of Polish Families (LPR). \n\nIn the Silesian part of the Silesian Voivodeship RAŚ had the following percentage of votes: Chorzów area - 17,50%, Katowice area - 15.96%, Rybnik area - 14.57%, Gliwice area - 8.70% and Bielsko-Biała area - 1.58% (actually only half of Bielsko-Biała lies within Silesia). Generally, the average result in Silesia within the Silesian Voivodeship (Katowice, Chorzów, Rybnik and Gliwice areas) was nearly 15%. \n\nIn districts of the Silesian Voivodeship which lie outside of the historical Silesian region RAŚ had the following support percentage: Sosnowiec area - 1.37% and Częstochowa area - 0.69%.

{"id": "1940776", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1940776", "title": "Macclesfield Canal", "text": "Macclesfield Canal\n\nThe Macclesfield Canal is a canal in east Cheshire, England. There were various proposals for a canal to connect the town of Macclesfield to the national network from 1765 onwards, but it was not until 1824 that a scheme came to fruition. There were already suggestions by that date that a railway would be better, but the committee that had been formed elected for a canal, and the engineer Thomas Telford endorsed the decision. The canal as built was a typical Telford canal, constructed using cut and fill, with numerous cuttings and embankments to enable it to follow as straight a course as possible, although Telford had little to do with its construction, which was managed by William Crosley.\n\nThe canal opened in 1831, and is long. All of its twelve locks are concentrated in a single flight at Bosley, which alters the level by . The canal runs from a junction with the Peak Forest Canal at Marple in the north, in a generally southerly direction, through the towns of Macclesfield and Congleton, to an end-on junction with the Hall Green Branch of the Trent and Mersey Canal. There is a stop lock at the junction, which drops the level by , and the branch runs for another to Hardings Wood Junction, where it joins the Trent and Mersey main line. This short branch is usually considered to be part of the Macclesfield Canal in modern literature.\n\nFaced with growing threats from railways, and the fact that the Trent and Mersey was proposing to merge with a railway company, the management did all they could to cut costs, but in 1846 reached an agreement to sell the canal to a railway company, which became the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway soon afterwards. Under railway ownership, the canal fared better than many, and commercial carrying continued until 1954. There had been some leisure use of the canal since the end of the First World War, and the North Cheshire Cruising Club, formed in 1943 and based at the High Lane arm, became the first such cruising club on the British inland waterways. There were dangers that the northern end would be isolated under plans to close the Ashton Canal and the lower Peak Forest Canal in the early 1960s, but vigorous campaigning and a growing restoration movement resulted in the Transport Act 1968, which secured the future of those canals. The designation of the canal as part of the Cheshire Ring in 1965 was part of the strategy by the Inland Waterways Association to promote the leisure potential of canals.\n\nThe whole canal was designated as a Conservation Area by Macclesfield Borough Council in 1975, and a large number of its structures have been Grade II listed in recognition of their historic importance. This includes a number of elegant roving bridges, which are known locally as \"snake bridges.\" Much of the canal is rural, passing through open countryside, and there are a number of impressive embankments and aqueducts, where the canal crosses river valleys. In the centres of population, there are several large mills, once served by the canal but now repurposed as small industrial units or apartments.\n\nThe canal runs for in a generally north to south direction from Marple Junction at Marple, where it joins the Upper Peak Forest Canal, to a junction with the Hall Green Branch of the Trent & Mersey Canal at Hall Green stop lock. The canal runs along the edge of a tall ridge of hills, to the west of the Pennines, and was built using Telford's \"cut and fill\" approach, following as straight a course as possible, with many cuttings and embankments constructed to achieve this, rather than the earlier approach of following the contours. It is a narrow canal, designed for boats with a maximum length of and a width of .\n\nIt joins the Peak Forest Canal on the eastern edge of Marple, at the top of a flight of 16 locks that raise the lower Peak Forest by to join the upper section. There was once a Stop Lock at Marple, although both canals were built to the same level, and the lock was provided only for cases where water shortages might have resulted in a temporary difference. The lock has long been de-gated, having become unnecessary once the Macclesfield and Peak Forest canals came into common ownership. The site of the lock remains as a narrows just in front of the junction bridge, and is overlooked by a canal warehouse with two storeys, built in 1835. It has a rectangular plan, and includes an internal waterway.\n\nAs the canal reaches Hawk Green, just to the south of Marple, a huge mill with six storeys is situated on the east bank. Goyt Mill was built in 1905, and now houses over 50 small businesses. At High Lane, the canal passes through the centre of the village, and the High Lane Branch, which is used as moorings for the North Cheshire Cruising Club, is to the west of the canal. A tall aqueduct carries the canal over a railway line, and beyond it is a large embankment. The next section is isolated and rural, with the canal following the contours, but the route crosses a number of valleys where there are embankments and aqueducts. Near Higher Poynton, the canal is wider, as it has suffered from subsidence from a nearby coal mine, which resulted in the banks and bridges being raised on several occasions.\n\nOn the outskirts of Bollington, the canal passes another Clarence Mill, another huge building which now houses small industrial units. Two aqueducts and a embankment carry the canal over the valley of the River Dean and into Bollington. Adelphi Mill is on the west bank at the southern edge of Bollington, and was once a silk mill. It has been converted for use as offices. After another rural section, the canal enters Macclesfield. Hovis Mill, where the famous flour was originally milled, is on the west bank. It was built in the 1820s, and has been converted into apartments. A branch of the canal formerly led into the complex, but only its blocked up entrance remains. Near Gurnett Aqueduct, which carries the canal over the road to Gurnett and the River Bollin, is a cottage with a plaque to commemorate the civil engineer and canal builder James Brindley. He served an apprenticeship to Abraham Bennett between 1733 and 1740 there.\n\nBeyond, the canal resumes its rural course as it follows the contours towards Bosley Lock Flight. To the east is Sutton Reservoir, which draws its water supply from springs to the east, and holds some of water to supply the canal. It provides opportunities for walking and picnicking. Just before the first lock is a short branch to the east, which gives access to facilities for boaters. It is actually the widened end of the feeder from Bosley Reservoir, the first to be built to supply the canal, which is located some distance to the south east. The top lock is from the Peak Forest Canal. The twelve locks of the flight drop the level of the canal by , and they are squeezed together in around . Whereas narrow locks on most canals have a single gate at the upper end, these all have twin mitred gates at both ends. Below the bottom lock, a fine aqueduct carries the canal over the River Dane.\n\nThe canal heads towards the west before turning to the south again at Buglawton. In Congleton, it crosses the Dane in Shaw Brook, from which a good view of the tall viaduct that carries the railway across the valley can be had. A branch line formerly passed under an aqueduct, beyond which the canal runs along the top of a large embankment. To the east is The Cloud, a large hill over high with ancient earthworks at the top. Below Congleton, the canal passes through open countryside in a fairly straight course, to reach Scholar Green and the hamlet of Hall Green, where a stop lock indicates the official junction with the Trent and Mersey Hall Green Branch. The branch continues for another , crossing over the Trent and Mersey main line, and then turning to the east, to join the main line at Hardings Wood Junction near Kidsgrove, after lock 41 and before the Harecastle Tunnel. Since both canals have been in common ownership, this final section is often treated as part of the Macclesfield Canal, and the numbering of bridges 94 to 98, which are all on the Trent and Mersey section, follows on from bridge 93, the final bridge on the Macclesfield Canal.\n\nThe canal forms part of the Cheshire Ring cruising route. This term was first used by the Inland Waterways Association in 1965, when they initiated a campaign to ensure that all of the waterways that comprised the Peak Forest circular route should be retained. It was in response to the threat of complete closure of the Rochdale Canal, of which just a mile (1.6 km) is used to complete the circuit. At the launch of the campaign in July 1965, it was called the Cheshire Canal Ring, but the word \"canal\" had been dropped by November. The route comprises the Macclesfield Canal, the Hall Green Branch, parts of the Trent and Mersey Canal, the Bridgwater Canal and the Rochdale Canal, all of the Ashton Canal and part of the Peak Forest Canal. There are 92 locks on the ring, which is around long, and it can reasonably be completed in a week.\n\nThere were a number of early proposals to link Macclesfield to the canal network. The first was in 1765, when a link to Congleton to the south, and Northwich to the west was proposed. A writer in the \"Derby Mercury\" newspaper in 1793 suggested a link from the Caldon Branch of the Trent and Mersey Canal to Macclesfield wia Leek. Two years later, a canal from Poynton Collieries via Macclesfield to the Trent and Mersey at Lawton, with a branch via Leek to the Caldon Branch was proposed.\n\nA rather more serious proposal was made in 1796, when gentlemen from Congleton, Leek, Macclesfield, Manchester, Stockport and the West Riding employed the engineer Benjamin Outram to survey possible routes. Outram was working on the Peak Forest Canal at the time. At a meeting in Macclesfield, held on 11 March 1796, his proposals for a canal from the Peak Forest via Rudyard to Endon on the Caldon Branch, with a separate branch or railway from Poynton and Norbury to Stockport were welcomed. However, there were dissenters, with some arguing that there was no guarantee that the Peak Forest Canal would succeed, and the Trent and Mersey Canal already had plans to build a branch from their Caldon Branch to Leek. The cost was estimated to be £90,000, and there was not enough financial support, now that the initial rush for building canals, known as Canal Mania, had ended.\nIn 1799, the Peak Forest Canal included clauses for a branch to the collieries at Poynton and Norbury in an Act of Parliament they were trying to obtain, but those clauses were deleted during the parliamentary process. In 1805 and 1806, they attempted to find the original papers from Outram's surveys, and hoped that the Trent and Mersey might support their proposal for a canal from Marple to Lawton, via Macclesfield. There was another proposal in 1810, and various half-hearted attempts to revive the idea between 1814 and 1818, but none came to fruition. In 1824, the Cromford and High Peak Railway, a bold scheme to link the Cromford Canal and the Peak Forest Canal, was being planned, but a suggestion to build a branch of the railway to serve Macclesfield was deferred, as there was nobody from Macclesfield at the meeting. A proposal for a canal from Church Lawton to the Bridgewater Canal near Manchester, passing through Congleton, Macclesfield, and Stockport, was also made, but it was thought that there would be difficulties dealing with the Trent and Mersey Canal at one end and the Trustees of the Duke of Bridgwater at the other.\nFinally, five gentlemen from Macclesfield placed an advertisement in the \"Courier\" newspaper on 18 September 1824, which resulted in the Mayor calling a public meeting on 22 September. At the meeting, held at the Macclesfield Arms, the canal was proposed and a committee formed, consisting of the Mayor and the five gentlemen. They would attempt to gain the cooperation of any owners of land through which the canal would pass, and would invite the towns of Congleton and Stockport to join them in the venture. Unlike earlier canals, the spectre of the arrival of the railways was already in sight, and at least one present at the first meeting suggested that a railway might be built. After some debate, it was decided to open subscriptions for a canal, but to consider the possibility of a railway, and some £100,000 was pledged.\n\nThe engineer Thomas Telford was employed to survey the route, and proposed a canal from Marple on the Peak Forest Canal, which would be level to beyond Macclesfield, and would then descend by a series of locks to the level of the Trent and Mersey Canal summit. It would pass close to Congleton, and would join the Trent and Mersey near Harecastle Tunnel. He stated that an adequate water supply could easily be obtained, ande discounted a branch to Stockport, which would have involved a descent of , as the town was already served by the Ashton Canal and the Peak Forest Canal. He considered five possible sites for the location of reservoirs to supply the canal.\nBy the time the canal gained its Act of Parliament on 11 April 1826, the estimated cost of construction, to be funded by shareholders, was put at £295,000. The authorised share capital was £300,000, and the company had powers to borrow a further £100,000.\n\nHaving conducted the survey and steered the bill through Parliament, Telford does not appear to have been involved in the construction of the canal. Tenders received for the work varied wildly in price, and he chose those that he thought best, as well as contributing £1000, but after that, the civil engineering was managed by William Crosley, a job which he carried out to a high standard. He had previously been working on the northern end of the Lancaster Canal, but resigned from that post to work on the Macclesfield Canal. Construction of the canal began at Bollington on 4 December 1826, with a ceremonial cutting of the first sod. The northern section from Bosley Locks to Marple was awarded as five separate contracts, and work progressed steadily. The Trent and Mersey Canal had managed to get a clause inserted into the enabling Act that required them to build the final mile (1.6 km) of the canal where it joined theirs, and to charge tolls to those using it. By the time the committee met in 1828, much of the northern end of the canal was nearing completion, and contracts for the three sections from Bosley to the Trent and Mersey had been awarded. No work had started on the locks, as the contractor was busy opening a quarry on the nearby hill called Bosley Cloud, and building a railway to carry the quarried stone to the lock sites.\n\nCrosley reduced the number of reservoirs from five to two, and these were built at Bosley and Sutton. According to the \"Courier\", the overall length of the canal had been reduced by some as a result of \"the skillful management of Mr Crosley\". There were problems with the Trent and Mersey length, with water seeping up and dislodging the puddle clay which made the canal watertight. This was eventually overcome by covering a short section with stone, to hold the clay in position. The committee made another inspection in June 1829, when good progress was reported on most fronts, although there were issues with the embankments at Bollington and Dane-in-Shaw, and with the aqueduct which carried the canal over the River Dane at Bosley. In the autumn of 1829, Telford also inspected the works. He highlighted a few minor problems, but was generally impressed by the quality of the workmanship. The annual meeting for 1830 was delayed, as King George IV had died, and his funeral was held on the day the meeting was scheduled. The aqueduct over the River Dane was completed on 23 October 1830, and contained of stone, with the main semi-circular arch spanning .\n\nThe committee were hoping that the canal would be completed by August 1831, but the opening was delayed, as the embankment at Dane-in-Shaw was still settling. They authorised the borrowing of £50,000 at a special meeting of shareholders held on 29 August 1831, to expedite the works. The formal opening took place on 9 November 1831, with ceremonial processions of boats from Congleton and Marple proceeding towards Macclesfield, meticulously timed so that boats would arrive at Macclesfield from both directions at the same time. Upon arrival, a salute was fired, and the Band of the Macclesfield Cavalry played God Save the King, before the proprietors and dignitaries retired to the Town Hall for dinner. A separate dinner was held at the Bulls Head Hotel for thirty of the contractors, while 500 workmen and 200 boatmen and drivers were each given half-a-crown (12.5p) to spend.\n\nThe final cost of the canal was around £320,000, only £25,000 more than the original estimate. The summit level, above Bosley Locks, was constructed at an elevation of , on a level with the Peak Forest Canal. At Bosley, twelve locks dropped the level to almost that of the Trent and Mersey, but there is a stop lock at the junction with their Hall Green Branch, with a fall of just , which ensured that the Trent and Mersey did not lose any water to the new canal. When originally built, the chamber was very long, and both companies installed a set of lock gates, enabling them both to collect tolls. Each company built a cottage overlooking the locks, the Macclesfield Canal constructing theirs of stone, while the Trent and Mersey used brick. A long overflow above the locks channels surplus water to the Trent and Mersey Canal, as stipulated by the amendment to the 1827 Act. Only one set of gates is still in place, and this is the set that was originally the Macclesfield Canal lock.\n\nAt the annual general meeting, held in July 1833, there was good news to report. Crosley had left the employment of the canal company on 24 June, but had produced a detailed report on the condition of the works before he left, in which he stated that there was no observable settlement in the embankments, the stonework of the locks, bridges and aqueducts was still good and showing no signs of failure, and the reservoir at Bosley had been filled to the top of several occasions, without any sign of leakage. Edward Stanley, the chairman of the management committee, reported that trade was brisk, and that 98,201.5 tons of cargo had been carried in the first full year of operation (March 1832-March 1833), generating an income of £6,117. Even a reduction in the rates being charged, to bring them in line with other canals, had not resulted in an appreciable fall in income. The company had built six wharfs, and was building a seventh at Bosley, four of which also had warehouses. In addition, ten houses had been built, for use by various members of staff, and offices had been constructed at Macclesfield. The company had bought the land for a second reservoir at Sutton and had already built the feeders to link it to the canal.\n\nBy 1838, the canal company was looking to expansion, and sought to build a branch from Buglawton to Biddulph, to serve the coal mines. Initially proposed as a canal, and later as a railway, the plan was eventually dropped after it met with a less than enthusiastic reception from shareholders who were seeking a more substantial dividend, rather than re-investment of profits, and from the mine owners. In the same year, the company joined forces with the Trent and Mersey, the Peak Forest and the Ashton Canal companies to successfully oppose plans to open a new canal from Middlewich to Altrincham.\n\nAs with so many UK canals, the arrival of the railways led to the decline of the canal. By 1845, the spectre of railway competition was looming large, and the proposals for the Trent and Mersey Company to merge with a railway company were causing concern. It was discussed at the 1845 general meeting, as it seemed likely that such a move would be detrimental to the Macclesfield Canal. They tried to cut costs by reducing the number of staff and lowering their wages, all the while reducing tolls in an attempt to retain traffic. They had ceased to pay dividends to the shareholders after a final payment of £1.50 in 1840.\n\nDespite this, they encouraged the use of stream boats, and in 1842 began running swift packet boats carrying leisure traffic from Dukinfield Central railway station, close to Dukinfield Junction on the Peak Forest Canal to Disley, Lyme Park and Macclesfield at fares of 1-1½d per mile. Promotional material stated that \"this line of conveyance is peculiarly adapted for pleasure parties, who may enjoy a delightful and healthy excursion on the Peak Forest Canal, and spend a day in the rural woods and pleasure grounds in the neighbourhood. The scenery is beautiful in the extreme, and cannot be equalled in any part of the country.\" However, the service does not appear to have lasted beyond 1846.\n\nWith proposals for the North Staffordshire Railway underway by 1845, the canal company threatened to build their own railway between the branch of the Manchester and Birmingham Railway at Macclesfield and Harecastle Tunnel, where it would meet the North Staffordshire Railway. The railway promoters immediately tried to gain the support of the Macclesfield Canal, by offering them shares, and requesting their assistance in promoting their Act of Parliament. The canal company suggested that the railway could lease the canal at £2 per share per year. The railway company responded with an alternative plan, which would see them buying the canal within five years for £2.50 per share, and paying off some of the canal's debts. This was rejected by the shareholders, who authorised the committee to negotiate with other railways, or to seek the required powers to build their own railway.\n\nBy June 1846 the company had negotiated an alternative arrangement with the Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway. Under the terms of this agreement, the railway company took out a perpetual lease of the canal at an annual rent of £6,605, which amounted to £2.50 per share, and was broadly equivalent to the dividend paid by the canal company prior to 1840. They also made a payment of £60,000, to cover all outstanding debts of the canal company. A bill to authorise the takeover of both the Macclesfield Canal and the Peak Forest Canal was sought and obtained in late 1846. The final meeting of the canal company took place on 15 July 1847, although it remained as a legal entity until 1883, to manage the rents. The railway company began selling water from the canal as soon as it took over.\n\nAt the time it took out its lease, the Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway was itself at an advanced stage in negotiating a merger with other railway companies, and on 1 January 1847, ownership of the canal passed to the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway. With an expectation that they would complete the construction of their London extension in 1899, the company changed its name to the Great Central Railway in 1897. When most of the railways of Britain were amalgamated in 1922, under the provisions of the Railways Act 1921, known as \"the grouping\", the Great Central Railway and hence the canal passed into the ownership of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER).\n\nIn 1848, the carriage of goods earned the company £9,049. The railway company began operating as a carrier soon afterwards, on a fairly small scale, and this continued until 1894, by which time most of the trade was in cotton. Trade in the return direction dwindled, to the point where the operation was uneconomic, and ceased. In 1905, boats using the canal carried coal, raw cotton, grain, which was supplied to textile and flour mills, and stone, but by this time traffic volumes were small. On 29 February 1912, the canal burst its banks at Kerridge, flooding several nearby streets. The cause was the failure of a culvert that carried Tinkers Brook under the canal embankment, at about 1:00 am. By the time the bridges could be stopped with stop planks, most of the upper pound above Bosley locks had drained away. It took three weeks to repair the breach, and around 100 men were employed to fill the gap with 160 boat loads of clay puddle and other materials.\n\nCommercial carrying on the canal ended in 1954, when the carriage of coal between Stoke and Marple ceased. There had been some leisure use of the canal since the end of the First World War, with the High Lane Arm acting as a base, where a number of boathouses were built. In 1937, the local authority decided that such buildings should incur rates, and a group of boaters joined together to challenge this. They were unsuccessful, although they did prevent the rates from being backdated for six years, and in 1943, a more formal organisation was formed. The chairman, Harry Downs, who had had many dealings with the North Cheshire Water Board, suggested that it should be called the North Cheshire Cruising Club, and this was agreed. They subsequently rented part of the arm from the LNER. The club is acknowledged to be the first such cruising club to be formed in Britain.\n\nWith the nationalisation of the railways in 1948, responsibility for the canal passed to the British Transport Commission. In 1955, a Board of Survey carried out an assessment of the canals, and many in the fledgling waterways movement, including the Inland Waterways Association, expected that the British Transport Commission annual bill for that year would include powers to close many of the canals rated as Class 3 by the Board of Survey. However, with growing public unease at the perceived fate of the canals, no such powers were included in the bill. The canal was visited by Sir Reginald Kerr, the head of British Transport Waterways, and other dignitaries on 27 February 1958, and again by boat on 21 May 1958, when he expressed his intent to ensure that the canals were used by private boaters. There was a risk that the northern end of the canal would be cut off by the closure of the Lower Peak Forest and the Ashton Canal, but vigorous campaigning and a growing restoration movement resulted in the passing of the Transport Act 1968, which effectively assured their future. As part of the Inland Waterways Amenity Advisory Council's \"Recreational Framework for Britain's Canals\" initiative, published as a policy document in 1975, Macclesfield Borough Council designated the whole canal as a Conservation Area in June of that year.\n\nThe following are all Grade II listed structures:\n\nThe Hall Green Branch, whilst originally built by the Trent & Mersey Canal Company, is often considered as part of the Macclesfield Canal in modern maps and guidebooks. Hall Green Stop Lock survives, with its rise and fall of about a foot (0.3m); this was to prevent the Trent & Mersey losing water to the Macclesfield in the event of a breach in the latter. There are no tunnels on the Macclesfield Canal, but there are several impressive embankments, including those at Bollington and High Lane on the upper section, and one over the River Dane on the lower section, close to Bosley bottom lock. The Macclesfield Canal is renowned for its elegant roving bridges, locally known as \"Snake Bridges\".\n\nIn 1992, the magazine \"Waterways World\" carried an article about a trip made by John Liley from the Caldon Canal feeder, across Rudyard Lake, and ending at the Macclesfield Canal feeder at the top of Bosley Locks. He had made the journey as a boy, and had used a portable dinghy for some of the route. This led to a number of people suggesting that the route could be made fully navigable, to effectively create a new cruising ring. The idea was examined again in 2004, in an article about the lake, in which it was stated that the feeder, which is about long, and the streams which feed into the north end of the lake, could provide a fairly level route for such a canal, which would join the Macclesfield at the bottom of Bosley flight. The main obstacle to overcome would be the difference in height between the start of the feeder and the level of the lake, as the earth dam is tall. A short flight of locks or perhaps a boat lift was suggested.\n\n\n\n"}

Designed by Charles Buek, the houses were built between 1880 and 1883 in three spurts, on land John Jacob Astor had purchased in 1844 for $10,000. Astor's grandson, William Backhouse Astor, Jr., was the driving force behind the development.\n\nThe design of the three-story brick, single-family houses is unusual, in that they are set back from the street, and all have front and side yards – an oddity in Manhattan – as well as wooden porches. The first group of houses, numbers 8 through 22, comprises freestanding pairs, while the remainder, numbers 24 through 60, are connected together at the rear.\n\nThe Astor Row houses were designated New York City Landmarks on August 11, 1981.\n\nWhen William Backhouse Astor died, the houses were divided among his grandchildren: Mary, James, and Sarah Van Alen. Ownership stayed in the Astor family until 1911, when the westernmost 10 of the houses were sold to real estate investor Max Marx, who traded them in part for an apartment building in Washington Heights. The new owners, the Brown Realty Company, defaulted on their mortgage, and the houses passed to the New York Savings Bank.\n\nIn 1920, the houses were described by a reporter for \"The New York Times\" as \"one of the most attractive and exclusive home centers\" in Harlem, presenting \"a picture of domestic tranquility and comfort which few other blocks in the city possess.\" \n\nThe Astor Row townhouses rented originally for $1,100 per year and were so popular that for years there was a waiting list for them. The townhouses were occupied originally by whites, but in 1920, 20 of the 28 houses – the 10 owned by New York Savings Bank, plus 10 still owned by the Astors – were purchased by James Cruikshank, a real estate operator and leased to black tenants.\n\nGenerally, the houses were not well maintained, and the porches were gradually lost. In 1978, the second edition of the \"AIA Guide to New York City\" described the row as having \"restrained beauty which has been tarnished by years of economic distress.\" In 1981, New York City designated the entire row as landmarks, and money was raised to restore their facades, and improve their plumbing, heating systems, and electrical lines where needed. The group overseeing and financing the work included the New York Landmarks Conservancy, New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, the Vincent Astor Foundation, Manhattan Community Board 10, the Abyssinian Development Corporation, the Commonwealth Fund, the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development, and several local banks. In 1992, Ella Fitzgerald performed at a benefit at Radio City Music Hall to raise money for the restoration. By the end of the 1990s, the porches and other decorative elements had been restored to almost all the buildings on the block. In August 2009, \"The New York Times\" would write \"the block is at the center of an intense but, as yet, unfinished revival of the surrounding streets in Central Harlem.\" The restoration of the row was overseen by Roberta Washington and Li/Saltzman.\n\nIn his novel \"Home to Harlem\" (1928), Claude McKay described Astor Row as \"the block beautiful.\"\n\n\n"}

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 9, 2001. The episode sees Homer, after being hypnotized by the hypnotist Mesmerino while having dinner at the restaurant Pimento Grove, reminded by a repressed traumatic experience from his childhood. The Simpsons set out to find the corpse that triggered Homer's psychological trauma, which evolves into a murder mystery later in the episode.\n\nThe episode was written by Ian Maxtone-Graham while Steven Dean Moore served as the director. The original idea for the episode came from current show runner Al Jean, which involved the murder mystery in the episode. The writers then incorporated Homer's flashbacks, at which point the episode was titled \"The Blunder Years\", a parody on the television show \"The Wonder Years\". \n\nFollowing the release of \"The Simpsons\"' thirteenth season on DVD and Blu-ray, the episode received mixed reviews from critics.\n\nAfter tricking Marge into believing that the model for the Burly paper towel corporation Chad Sexington would have dinner with the Simpsons, Homer takes the family to the Pimento Grove to watch live performers as compensation. One of the acts is a hypnotist called Mesmerino. Homer volunteers, and Mesmerino hypnotizes him into thinking he is twelve years old again. As Homer starts to reminisce, he starts screaming incessantly all through the night. The next day, Homer's co-workers Lenny and Carl bring him home early from work, still screaming. They finally manage to calm him down with some Yaqui tea. He starts to recall the events leading up to the scream-inducing incident. In a flashback, Homer, Lenny, and Carl are hiking in the woods and are confronted by a young Fat Tony, but they are saved by a young Moe.\n\nUpon noticing that his bar was empty, the present-day Moe arrives at the Simpsons' home and begins to recall the events of that day. He remembers that while they sat by a fire that night, they saw a near-meltdown at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. The next day, they go to the old quarry for a swim, and Homer jumps in, only to find that there was no water but only mud. However, Homer recalls that there was no water in the quarry because something was blocking the inlet pipe. When Homer unblocks it, he finds a rotting corpse in his lap, causing him to scream so much his voice changes from puberty.\n\nBack in the present, the Simpsons decide to investigate. They go to the old quarry where they meet Chief Wiggum, who comes with them. Marge uses Burly paper towels to drain the water from the quarry. Finding nothing left of the corpse but a skeleton, they take its skull with them and travel through the pipe to emerge through a hatch in Mr. Burns's office. They confront him about the body, but he insists he did not murder anyone. He tells them that the dead man is Smithers' father, Waylon Smithers Sr. He shows an old surveillance tape, filmed during the imminent meltdown in which Smithers' father goes into an unstable reactor core to prevent the meltdown. He succeeds in saving the city, but he dies in the process due to exposure to large amounts of radiation. Burns tells them that he kept the truth from Waylon Jr.; Smithers then enters the room, having heard the entire story. Burns apologizes to him, saying he wanted to spare him from telling the story about his father's real death. However, Smithers admits that he is glad that his father died as a real hero rather than from a tribe of savage Amazon women, which Burns told him earlier.\n\nDeclaring the case of the haunted quarry solved, Homer stores the skull in his \"Memories\" box, despite Marge's insistence to give it to Smithers. Just then, Moe arrives, having found some clues to the case. Despite Homer and Marge telling him the case has been solved, upon seeing Moe despondent, they decide to humour him by letting him show them his clues, which continues through the credits, ending with Homer screaming.\n\n\"The Blunder Years\" was written by Ian Maxtone-Graham and directed by Steven Dean Moore. It was first broadcast on Fox in the United States on December 9, 2001. Although the episode was written by Maxtone-Graham, the original idea for the episode, which involved Homer finding Smithers' father's corpse, was conceived by writer and current show runner Al Jean. At that point, the episode was titled \"Smithers' Father's Apparent Murder\" until the writers incorporated flashbacks to Homer's childhood that resembled the story of the film \"Stand By Me\", based on the novella \"The Body\" by Stephen King. At this point, the writers changed the episode title to \"The Blunder Years\".\n\nHomer's first flashback shows a clip of him falling down Springfield Gorge on a skateboard, a scene taken from the episode \"Bart the Daredevil\". The \"Simpsons\"' staff were concerned that this would make people think the episode was in fact a clip show, so they kept the clip short. The staff also debated how horrific Smithers' father's corpse would look. The first design was \"more horrific\" than the one seen in the episode, and it more closely resembled Smithers. The corpse seen in the episode was an altered version of the first design. The video recorded by Mr. Burns' security camera was originally supposed to be shot in the same angle as a real security camera, but according to director Steven Dean Moore, to follow the narrative, the staff \"had to lose [the camera angle]\". This led to some confusion, since one of the shots was from inside the core, making it look as if the security camera was actually inside it. The staff intended to cut the shot, but they later decided to keep it in; Jean explained in the DVD audio commentary for the episode that \"Nobody ever notices it\". The end of the episode originally had Chad Sexington showing up for his date with Marge, causing Homer to scream uncontrollably again; however, it was cut in favor of Hank Azaria's improvisation as Moe, which, according to \"Simpsons\" writer Carolyn Omine, was Azaria's \"favorite thing [he] had ever done\" on \"The Simpsons\".\n\nAmerican actor and director Paul Newman guest starred as himself in the episode, however he had only one line of dialogue. Newman recorded approximately five or six takes of his line over the phone from the set of a movie he was shooting at the time. According to Maxtone-Graham, Newman recorded his line with no rigmarole; \"He just said, 'Sure, I'll do it', and he did it instantly.\" The episode also features Joe Mantegna, who plays a young Fat Tony. Welsh singer-songwriter Judith Owen, wife of \"Simpsons\"' cast member Harry Shearer, also makes an appearance in the episode.\n\nThe episode's title is a reference to the television show \"The Wonder Years\". Homer's flashbacks to his childhood were based on the plot of the film \"Stand By Me\", which in turn is based on Stephen King's novella \"The Body\". However, the scenes in the quarry were based on the coming of age film \"Breaking Away\", directed by Peter Yates. Burly, the brand of paper towels featured in the episode, is based on the real brand Brawny Paper Towels. The model for Burly paper towels, called Chad Sexington, was based on the Brawny paper towels' logo; however, the logo, within \"a year or two of [the episode]\", was changed into a more \"right-of-center\" looking brunette, according to Dean Moore. One of the walls in Pimento Grove shows photos of several characters and guest stars who have appeared on \"The Simpsons\", including Birch Barlow, Stephen Hawking, and Ringo Starr. Mesmerino later reads a letter in a similarly to Carnac the Magnificent, played by Johnny Carson on \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\".\n\nFollowing the release of the thirteenth season of \"The Simpsons\" on DVD and Blu-ray, \"The Blunder Years\" received mixed reviews from critics. \n\nGiving the episode a positive review, Dominic von Riedermann of \"suite101\" stated that the episode was one of the season's \"comedy gems\", praising Paul Newman's guest appearance in particular. \n\nWriting for \"DVD Verdict\", Jennifer Malkowski gave a favorable review of the episode, giving a B rating and pointed at the scene in which \"Homer says finding a corpse explains everything that's gone wrong in his life—especially his fear of corpses\" as the highlight of the episode. \n\nColin Jacobsson of DVD Movie Guide was positive, calling the episode a \"reasonably amusing spoof [of \"Stand By Me\"]\". He enjoyed \"Marge's lust for Burly\" and \"Homer's rampaging fear\", and concluded by saying that, while nothing in the episode \"dazzles\", it still \"adds up to a good episode\".\n\nRon Martin of 411mania was less enthusiastic about the episode. Calling the episode a \"bad parody of \"Stand By Me\"\", Martin wrote that \"any moments this episode might have had are annulled by the constant annoyance of Homer screaming through the first half of the episode\".\n\n"}

There have been many common methods of mapping messages to codewords. These are often used to recover messages sent over a noisy channel, such as a binary symmetric channel.\n\nformula_1 is considered a binary code with the length formula_2; formula_3 shall be elements of formula_4; and formula_5 is the distance between those elements.\n\nOne may be given the message formula_6, then ideal observer decoding generates the codeword formula_7. The process results in this solution:\n\nFor example, a person can choose the codeword formula_9 that is most likely to be received as the message formula_10 after transmission.\n\nEach codeword does not have an expected possibility: there may be more than one codeword with an equal likelihood of mutating into the received message. In such a case, the sender and receiver(s) must agree ahead of time on a decoding convention. Popular conventions include:\n\nGiven a received codeword formula_6 maximum likelihood decoding picks a codeword formula_7 that maximizes\n\nthat is, the codeword formula_9 that maximizes the probability that formula_10 was received, given that formula_9 was sent. If all codewords are equally likely to be sent then this scheme is equivalent to ideal observer decoding.\nIn fact, by Bayes Theorem,\n\nUpon fixing formula_18, formula_10 is restructured and\nformula_20 is constant as all codewords are equally likely to be sent.\nTherefore, \nformula_21\nis maximised as a function of the variable formula_9 precisely when\nformula_23\nis maximised, and the claim follows.\n\nAs with ideal observer decoding, a convention must be agreed to for non-unique decoding.\n\nThe maximum likelihood decoding problem can also be modeled as an integer programming problem.\n\nThe maximum likelihood decoding algorithm is an instance of the \"marginalize a product function\" problem which is solved by applying the generalized distributive law.\n\nGiven a received codeword formula_6, minimum distance decoding picks a codeword formula_7 to minimise the Hamming distance:\n\ni.e. choose the codeword formula_9 that is as close as possible to formula_10.\n\nNote that if the probability of error on a discrete memoryless channel formula_29 is strictly less than one half, then \"minimum distance decoding\" is equivalent to \"maximum likelihood decoding\", since if\n\nthen:\n\nwhich (since \"p\" is less than one half) is maximised by minimising \"d\".\n\nMinimum distance decoding is also known as \"nearest neighbour decoding\". It can be assisted or automated by using a standard array. Minimum distance decoding is a reasonable decoding method when the following conditions are met:\n\nThese assumptions may be reasonable for transmissions over a binary symmetric channel. They may be unreasonable for other media, such as a DVD, where a single scratch on the disk can cause an error in many neighbouring symbols or codewords.\n\nAs with other decoding methods, a convention must be agreed to for non-unique decoding.\n\nSyndrome decoding is a highly efficient method of decoding a linear code over a \"noisy channel\", i.e. one on which errors are made. In essence, syndrome decoding is \"minimum distance decoding\" using a reduced lookup table. This is allowed by the linearity of the code.\n\nSuppose that formula_33 is a linear code of length formula_2 and minimum distance formula_35 with parity-check matrix formula_36. Then clearly formula_37 is capable of correcting up to\n\nerrors made by the channel (since if no more than formula_39 errors are made then minimum distance decoding will still correctly decode the incorrectly transmitted codeword).\n\nNow suppose that a codeword formula_6 is sent over the channel and the error pattern formula_41 occurs. Then formula_42 is received. Ordinary minimum distance decoding would lookup the vector formula_43 in a table of size formula_44 for the nearest match - i.e. an element (not necessarily unique) formula_45 with\n\nfor all formula_7. Syndrome decoding takes advantage of the property of the parity matrix that:\n\nfor all formula_49. The \"syndrome\" of the received formula_42 is defined to be:\n\nTo perform ML decoding in a binary symmetric channel, one has to look-up a precomputed table of size formula_52, mapping formula_53 to formula_54.\n\nNote that this is already of significantly less complexity than that of a standard array decoding.\n\nHowever, under the assumption that no more than formula_39 errors were made during transmission, the receiver can look up the value formula_53 in a further reduced table of size\n\nonly (for a binary code). The table is against pre-computed values of formula_53 for all possible error patterns formula_41.\n\nKnowing what formula_54 is, it is then trivial to decode formula_10 as:\n\nFor Binary codes, if both formula_63 and formula_64 are not too big, and assuming the code generating matrix is in standard form, syndrome decoding can be computed using 2 precomputed lookup tables and 2 XORs only. \n\nLet formula_43 be the received noisy codeword, i.e. formula_66. Using the encoding lookup table of size formula_67, the codeword formula_68 that corresponds to the first formula_63 bits of formula_43 is found. \n\nThe syndrome is then computed as the last formula_64 bits of formula_72 (the first formula_63 bits of the XOR are zero [since the generating matrix is in standard form] and discarded). Using the syndrome, the error formula_54 is computed using the syndrome lookup table of size formula_52, and the decoding is then computed via formula_76 (for the codeword, or the first formula_63 bits of formula_10 for the original word).\n\nThe number of entries in the two lookup tables is formula_79, which is significantly smaller than formula_80 required for standard array decoding that requires only formula_81 lookup. Additionally, the precomputed encoding lookup table can be used for the encoding, and is thus often useful to have.\n\nPartial response maximum likelihood (PRML) is a method for converting the weak analog signal from the head of a magnetic disk or tape drive into a digital signal.\n\nA Viterbi decoder uses the Viterbi algorithm for decoding a bitstream that has been encoded using forward error correction based on a convolutional code.\nThe Hamming distance is used as a metric for hard decision Viterbi decoders. The \"squared\" Euclidean distance is used as a metric for soft decision decoders.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1940787", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1940787", "title": "Taq-e Bostan", "text": "Taq-e Bostan\n\nTaq-e Bostan (,) means \"Arch of the Garden\" or \"Arch made by stone\" is a site with a series of large rock reliefs from the era of the Sassanid Empire of Persia (Iran), carved around the 4th century CE.\n\nThis example of Persian Sassanid art is located 5 km from the city center of Kermanshah. It is located in the heart of the Zagros mountains, where it has endured almost 1,700 years of wind and rain. Originally, several sources were visible next to and below the reliefs and arches, some of which are now covered. Sources next to the reliefs still feed a large basin in front of the rock. The site has been turned into an archaeological park and a series of late Sassanian and Islamic column capitals have been brought together (some found at Taq Bostan, others at Bisutun and Kermanshah).\n\nThe carvings, some of the finest and best-preserved examples of Persian sculpture under the Sassanids, include representations of the investitures of Ardashir II (379–383) and Shapur III (383–388). Like other Sassanid symbols, Taq-e Bostan, and its relief patterns accentuate power, religious tendencies, glory, honor, the vastness of the court, game and fighting spirit, festivity, joy, and rejoicing.\n\nSassanid kings chose a beautiful setting for their rock reliefs along an historic Silk Road caravan route waypoint and campground. The reliefs are adjacent to sacred springs that empty into a large reflecting pool at the base of a mountain cliff.\n\nTaq-e Bostan and its rock relief are one of the 30 surviving Sassanid relics of the Zagros mountains. According to Arthur Pope, the founder of the Iranian Art and Archeology Institute in the United States of America, \"art was characteristic of the Iranian people and the gift which they endowed the world with.\"\n\nThe Taq-e Bostan complex comprise a rock relief standing on its own and several more reliefs associated with two rock cut arches. They illustrate the investiture ceremonies of the kings Ardashir II, Shapur II, Shapur III and Khosrau II. They also depict the hunting scenes of Khosrau II.\n\nThe first Taq-e Bostan relief, and apparently the oldest, is a rock relief of the crowning ceremony of Ardashir II (379-383 AD) by his predecessor Shapur II or Ahura Mazda (although even the middle figure is wearing a Sassanian crown, with the balloon-like top/compartment [apparently to hold their hair in], and the figure to his left is the receiver of the ring; so he could not be Ahura Mazda, either). Researchers long debated the identities of the figures in this relief but is now ascertained that Ardashir II receives the beribboned ring - symbol of royal investiture - from his predecessor Shapur II or Ahura Mazda. There may be a deliberate mixture of the iconography of both identities. The two main figures are standing on the fallen Roman emperor Julianus Apostata (361-363 AD). Ardashir played an important role in his defeat during the reign of Shapur II (309-379 AD). Exceptional within Sasanian art is the fact that this is a portrait, based on the image of Julianus Apostata as it appears on Roman coins. Ardashir II was installed as interim ruler, awaiting the coming of age of the royal heir Shapur III (383-388 AD). The fourth figure is the god Mithra who holds a barsum in his hands and stands on a lotus flower. He is the protector of oaths and is witness to this pact. \nLocal beliefs and Persian folk tale interpreted the scene as the victory of the first Sasanian kings on Artabanus IV, the last king of the Parthian dynasty. The Mithra figure became the visual inspiration for representations of the prophet Zoroaster.\n\nThe relief panel is approx. 4.07 m wide and 3.9 m high.\n\nThe smaller arch or iwan (Taq-e Bustan II) has, on the upper part of the back wall, two Pahlavi inscriptions identifying two royal figures as Shapur II (Shapur the Great) and his son Shapur III. They are shown facing each other. The arch's vestibule measures 6 x 5 x 3.6 meters. It has been suggested as having been built during the reign of Shapur III and some put the date of its completion at 385 AD. However, the royal crown of Shapur III does not agree with those on his coins and is closer to that of his predecessor Ardashir II. It has been argued that the texts represent an usurpation of Ardashir's relief by Shapur III. The translation of the inscriptions follows:\n\nShapur II inscription :\n\nShapur III inscription:\n\nThe figures of the two kings have been carved in low relief, looking at each other. Each figure is ca. 2.97 meters. Shapur II is on the right and Shapur III is on the left. Their hands are placed on a long straight sword which point downwards. The right hand is holding the grip and the left rests on the sheath. Both figures wear loose trousers, necklaces, curled hair, and a pointed beard ending in a ring.\n\nThe three figures on the back wall of the large \"iwan\" are usually considered to represent Khosrow Parviz flanked by Ahura Mazda and Anahita. They are placed above a mounted Persian knight, thought to be Khusrow himself riding his favourite horse, Shabdiz. There is, however, no unanimity about the exact identification of this late Sasanian king. The two attending figures are sometimes considered to be a priest and a priestess, rather than the gods Ahura Mazda and Anahita themselves.\n\nOne of the most impressive reliefs inside the largest grotto or \"ivan\" is the gigantic equestrian figure of the Sassanid king Khosrau II (591-628 CE) mounted on his favorite charger, Shabdiz. Both horse and rider are arrayed in full battle armor.\n\nThe front of the rock-cut arch bears delicately carved patterns showing the tree of life or the sacred tree. Above the arch and located on two opposite sides are figures of two winged women with diadems.\n\nEquestrian relief panel measured on 16.08.07 approx. 7.45m across by 4.25 m high\n\nOn the right and left wall of the arch, there is a picture of the king's hunting measuring 3.8 X 5.7 meters. From the time of Cyrus the Great to the end of Sassanid period, hunting was one of the most favourite activities of Iranian kings. Therefore, scenes of hunting are frequently found next to those of crownings.\n\nThere are two hunting scenes on each side of the ivan. One scene depicts the imperial boar hunt, and in a similar spirit, the other scene shows the king stalking deer. Five elephants flush out the fleeing boars from a marshy lake for the king who stands poised with bow and arrow in hand while being serenaded by female musicians. In the next scene, another boat carries female harpists and shows that the king has killed two large boars. The next boat shows the king standing with a semicircular halo around his head and a loose bow in his hand, meaning the hunt is over. Under this picture, elephants are retrieving the game with their trunks and putting them on their backs. Several episodes of the royal hunt are thus shown at the same time.\n\nThese royal hunting scenes are among the most vivid and highly narrative murals immortalized in stone.\n\nPanel depicting boar hunt measured on 16.08.07 as approx. 6.0 m wide x 4.25 m high\n\nPanel depicting deer hunt measured on 16.08.07 as approx. 5.9 m wide x 4.35 m high\n\nJumping 1300 years in time the upper relief shows the 19th century Qajar Governor in Kermanshah city, Dowlatshah carving a relief in a big arch.\n\n\n\n"}

He served as Bishop of Oakland from 1962 until his death in 1977.\n\nFloyd Begin was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the eldest of three children of Peter H. and Stella Agnes (née McFarland) Begin. He received his early education at the parochial schools of St. Columbkille Church and St. Thomas Aquinas Church. He attended Cathedral Latin High School (1916–20) and St. John Cathedral College (1920–22), both in Cleveland. He graduated from St. Ignatius High School (Cleveland) in 1920\n\nBegin then studied for the priesthood at the Pontifical North American College in Rome, where he served as assistant to the rector during his studies. He earned a doctorate in philosophy and in theology from the Pontifical Urbaniana University. In 1930, he received a doctorate in canon law from the Apollinarus University.\n\nBegin was ordained a priest in Rome on July 31, 1927. Following his return to Ohio, he briefly served as administrator of St. Anthony Church in Canton. From 1930 to 1938, he served as secretary to Bishop Joseph Schrembs as well as vice-chancellor and pro-vicar general of the Diocese of Cleveland.\n\nBegin became an \"officialis\" of the diocesan tribunal in 1938.

She was formerly a lady-in-waiting to Aleksandar's mother, Queen Natalija.\n\nDraga was the fourth daughter of Panta Lunjevica, a prefect of the Aranđelovac area, and wife Anđelija (\"née\" Koljević). Draga was the sixth of seven siblings. She had two brothers, Nikola and Nikodije, and four sisters, Hristina, Đina, Ana and Vojka. Draga's mother was a dipsomaniac and her father died in a lunatic asylum.\n\nDraga was the granddaughter of Nikola Lunjevica, a close comrade of Prince Miloš, Aleksandar's great-granduncle. Her paternal grandmother was Đurđija Čarapić, a relative of \"vojvoda\" Ilija Čarapić (died 1844), husband of Karađorđe Petrović's daughter Stamenka Karađorđević. At the time of her second marriage, she was the widow of Svetozar Mašin (1851–1886), a Czech civil engineer, and was twelve years older than Aleksandar.\n\nThe couple married on 5 August 1900 in a formal ceremony. When Aleksandar announced their engagement, public opinion turned against him. He was viewed as a besotted young fool in the power of a wicked seductress. Dowager Queen Natalija bitterly opposed the marriage, and was exiled by her son, in part because of it. His many arbitrary and unpopular acts were blamed on Draga's influence. There were rumors that Aleksandar would name Draga's elder brother as heir-presumptive to the throne. Both brothers were serving as army officers at the time of the marriage and appear to have been unpopular with their peers.\n\nThis last rumour led to the royal couple's assassination. On the night of 10–11 June 1903, a group of army officers invaded the royal palace, led by Colonel Dragutin Dimitrijević and others. Troops led by other officers involved in the conspiracy were deployed near the palace, and the royal guards did not offer effective resistance in the confusion after the electric lighting of the building was turned off. Initially the conspirators were unable to find Aleksandar and Draga. However an aide of the king was captured and, either out of sympathy for the conspiracy or out of fear for his own life, revealed that they were hiding in a large built-in wardrobe off their bedroom. \n\nAnother account says that Aleksandar did not shut the secret door properly. Emerging partially dressed, the couple were murdered with sword thrusts and pistol shots by the officers, some of whom were reportedly drunk. The bodies were mutilated and afterwards thrown from a palace balcony onto piles of garden manure. Draga's two brothers, Nikodije and Nikola, were executed by firing squad on the same day.\n\nShe was played by Magda Sonja in the 1920 Austrian silent film \"Queen Draga\". In the 1932 American film \"A Woman Commands\" she was portrayed by Pola Negri.\n\n"}

It was established as a subsidiary of Konami in Tokyo. The studio had around 100 employees, but grew to over 200 for \"\". After leaving Konami when his employment contract ended in 2015, Kojima reformed the company as an independent studio in Shinagawa.\n\nThe company was formed on April 1, 2005, after Konami merged several of the subsidiaries including Hideo Kojima's team at Konami Computer Entertainment Japan (KCEJ). Kojima stated the merger relieved him of business management and administrative burdens he had as KCEJ's vice president, and that as head of Kojima Productions he could focus on creating games. He stated:\n\nThe company's first release was \"Metal Gear Solid HD Collection\" in 2011, a compilation of \"Metal Gear\" games. They released \"\" for Nintendo 3DS as a port for \"\". The company produced two final video games for Konami, including \"\" and \"\".\n\nOn March 16, 2015, Konami announced that it had restructured the game development operations to \"[shift] our production structure to a headquarters-controlled system, in order to establish a steadfast operating base capable of responding to the rapid market changes that surround our digital entertainment business.\" Kojima and his company were stripped from promotional material and websites relating to the \"Metal Gear\" series, Kojima's Los Angeles studio was renamed Konami Los Angeles Studio, a new \"Metal Gear Solid\" Twitter account without references to Kojima in its username was established, and the Kojima Productions website began to redirect to the \"Metal Gear Solid\" website. That day, Kojima posted a photo on his personal Twitter account captioned \"heading off\", and a Konami filing stated that as of April 1, 2015, he would no longer be among Konami's executive officers. Speculation arose that Kojima was planning to leave Konami after the release of \"The Phantom Pain\", which he had described as the conclusion to the \"Metal Gear\" series.\n\nOn March 19, an anonymous employee reported to GameSpot that these changes were a result of conflicts between Kojima and Konami. The employee stated that Kojima and his staff were now being treated as contracted workers rather than employees, Konami had blocked access to their corporate e-mail and phone systems, and that Kojima and the studio's senior staff planned to leave Konami in December 2015 following the conclusion of their contracts and the release of \"The Phantom Pain\". A Konami spokesperson denied that Kojima was leaving the company, and stated that he would still be involved with Konami and the \"Metal Gear\" franchise. On March 20, Konami stated on its website that Kojima would stay through at least the completion of \"The Phantom Pain\", and that it was recruiting staff to develop future \"Metal Gear\" games. Kojima confirmed in a statement that he was still \"100% involved\" in \"The Phantom Pain\", and was \"determined to make it the greatest game I've directed to date.\" Donna Burke, who had been involved in the game, claimed in a posting on Twitter that Kojima had been fired; Konami denied these claims and Burke revoked her statement.\n\nOn July 10, 2015, Akio Ōtsuka tweeted that the company was closed. In December 2015, Kojima Productions was nominated for Developer of the Year at The Game Awards 2015, but lost to CD Projekt Red. Kojima was reportedly blocked from attending the event by Konami's lawyers, requiring Kiefer Sutherland to accept awards for \"The Phantom Pain\" on his behalf.\n\nOn December 16, 2015, in a joint announcement with Sony Computer Entertainment, Kojima announced that his company would be re-established as an independent studio, with Yoji Shinkawa and Kenichiro Imaizumi. The studio announced that it would develop a new franchise for PlayStation 4. Kojima stated that he \"will be taking on a new challenge by establishing my own independent studio, and I am thrilled to be able to embark on this journey with PlayStation, who I have continued to work with all these past years.\" At E3 2016, Kojima unveiled a trailer to \"Death Stranding\" during Sony's pre-E3 conference. It was released by Sony Interactive Entertainment in 2019, and is scheduled for release by 505 Games on Microsoft Windows in 2020. In November 2019, the studio announced their plans to make films.\n\nThe philosophy of Media Molecule was modelled by Kojima when reforming the studio. After visiting the company in 2016, he simultaneously modelled his own, wanting \"a small, intimate type of studio\". Kojima praised their high number of female employees and relaxed atmosphere comparing the atmosphere to a family. Kojima set a limit of one hundred employees for the studio, due to the low number at Media Molecule.\n\nKenichiro Imaizumi, who had been a founding member, left the company in 2019.\n\nIn April 2020 during COVID-19 pandemic, the office was shut down after an employee tested positive for Covid-19.\n\nThough Kojima had been designing games at Konami in 1987, the studio was not officially formed until 2005. However, Konami retroactively referred to Kojima's earlier productions as belonging to the studio. His games for Konami were released until 2015.\n\n"}

It is a relatively volatile and highly toxic inorganic compound. It occurs as white crystals that react slowly with water to form hydrogen cyanide.\n\nCyanogen iodide is prepared by combining I and a cyanide, most commonly sodium cyanide in ice-cold water. The product is extracted with ether.\n\nCyanogen iodide has been used in taxidermy as a preservative because of its toxicity.\n\nCyanogen iodide was first synthesized in 1824 by the French chemist Georges-Simon Serullas (1774–1832).\n\nCyanogen iodide was considered one of the impurities in commercially sold iodine before the 1930s.\n\nCyanogen iodide is toxic if inhaled or ingested and may be fatal if swallowed or absorbed through the skin. Cyanogen iodide may cause convulsions, paralysis and death from respiratory failure. It is a strong irritant and may cause burns to the eyes and skin if contacted. If cyanogen iodide is heated enough to undergo complete decomposition, it may releases toxic fumes of nitrogen oxides, cyanide and iodide. A fire may cause the release of poisonous gas. Cyanogen iodide decomposes when contacted with acids, bases, ammonia, alcohols, and with heating. ICN slowly reacts with water or carbon dioxide to produce hydrogen cyanide.\n\nIt is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.\n\nCyanogen iodide solutions in pyridine conduct electric current. Dilute solutions of ICN in pyridine are colorless at first, but upon standing become successively yellow, orange, red-brown and deep red-brown. This effect is due to a change in conductivity, which in turn is due to the formation of an electrolyte. When electrical conductivity of ICN is compared with that of iodine-pyridine solutions, the formation of the electrolyte in ICN proceeds much more slowly. Results confirm that cyanides are much weaker salts in pyridine than are iodides, although cyanogen iodide solutions are able to be dissolved in pyridine giving solutions with electrical conductivity that increases over time and results in maximum values.\n"}

{"id": "1940832", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1940832", "title": "Global governance", "text": "Global governance\n\nGlobal governance or world governance is a movement towards political cooperation among transnational actors, aimed at negotiating responses to problems that affect more than one state or region. Institutions of global governance—the United Nations, the International Criminal Court, the World Bank, etc.—tend to have limited or demarcated power to enforce compliance. Global governance involves multiple states including international organizations with one state having more of a lead role than the rest. The modern question of world governance exists in the context of globalization and globalizing regimes of power: politically, economically and culturally. In response to the acceleration of worldwide interdependence, both between human societies and between humankind and the biosphere, the term \"global governance\" may name the process of designating laws, rules, or regulations intended for a global scale.\n\nGlobal governance is not a singular system. There is no \"world government\" but the many different regimes of global \"governance\" do have commonalities:\nThe term world governance is broadly used to designate all regulations intended for organization and centralization of human societies on a global scale. The Forum for a new World Governance defines world governance simply as \"collective management of the planet\".\n\nTraditionally, \"government\" has been associated with \"governing,\" or with political authority, institutions, and, ultimately, control. \"Governance\" denotes a process through which institutions coordinate and control independent social relations, and that have the ability to enforce their decisions. However, authors like James Rosenau have also used \"governance\" to denote the regulation of interdependent relations in the absence of an overarching political authority, such as in the international system. Some now speak of the development of \"global public policy\".\n\nAdil Najam, a scholar on the subject at the Pardee School of Global Studies, Boston University has defined global governance simply as \"the management of global processes in the absence of global government.\" According to Thomas G. Weiss, director of the Ralph Bunche Institute for International Studies at the Graduate Center (CUNY) and editor (2000–05) of the journal \"\", \"'Global governance'—which can be good, bad, or indifferent—refers to concrete cooperative problem-solving arrangements, many of which increasingly involve not only the United Nations of states but also 'other UNs,' namely international secretariats and other non-state actors.\" In other words, global governance refers to the way in which global affairs are managed.\n\nStates are more likely to formally include civil society organizations (CSOs) in order to avoid a potential legitimacy advantage of their counterparts and to enhance domestic legitimacy if the following two conditions apply: first if they are more central to the global governance network; and second, if other states formally include CSOs as well. Thus, while government choices concerning whether to involve formally CSOs in global climate policy are obviously driven to a considerable degree by domestic factors, the authors concentrate on international network effects.\n\nThe definition is flexible in scope, applying to general subjects such as global security and order or to specific documents and agreements such as the World Health Organization's Code on the Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes. The definition applies whether the participation is bilateral (e.g. an agreement to regulate usage of a river flowing in two countries), function-specific (e.g. a commodity agreement), regional (e.g. the Treaty of Tlatelolco), or global (e.g. the Non-Proliferation Treaty). These \"cooperative problem-solving arrangements\" may be formal, taking the shape of laws or formally constituted institutions for a variety of actors (such as state authorities, intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), private sector entities, other civil society actors, and individuals) to manage collective affairs. They may also be informal (as in the case of practices or guidelines) or ad hoc entities (as in the case of coalitions).\n\nHowever, a single organization may take the nominal lead on an issue, for example the World Trade Organization (WTO) in world trade affairs. Therefore, global governance is thought to be an international process of consensus-forming which generates guidelines and agreements that affect national governments and international corporations. Examples of such consensus would include WTO policies on health issues.\n\nThe WTO is needed when establishing a regulatory guide in decision-making, the Global Administrative Law is active in going hand-in-hand with WTO. They promote global principles when involving accountability, transparency, and legitimacy when making decisions involving more than one country or state. This is necessary to prevent future disputes between states.\n\nIn short, global governance may be defined as \"the complex of formal and informal institutions, mechanisms, relationships, and processes between and among states, markets, citizens and organizations, both inter- and non-governmental, through which collective interests on the global plane are articulated, Duties, obligations and privileges are established, and differences are mediated through educated professionals.\"\n\nTitus Alexander, author of \"Unravelling Global Apartheid, an Overview of World Politics\", has described the current institutions of global governance as a system of global apartheid, with numerous parallels with minority rule in the formal and informal structures of South Africa before 1991.\n\nWhile attempts of intergovernmental coordination of policy-making can be traced back to ancient times, comprehensive search for effective formats of international coordination and cooperation truly began after the end of the WWI. It was during that post-war period that some of the still existing international institutions (or their immediate predecessors) were founded. Among thinkers who made major contributions to the period discussions on the goals and forms of international governance and policy coordination were J.M. Keynes with his \"The Economic Consequences of the Peace\" and G. Cassel with his works on the post-war development of the global monetary system.\n\nThe dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 marked the end of a long period of international history based on a policy of balance of powers. Since this historic event, the planet has entered a phase of geostrategic breakdown. The national-security model, for example, while still in place for most governments, is gradually giving way to an emerging collective conscience that extends beyond the restricted framework it represents.\n\nThe post-Cold War world of the 1990s saw a new paradigm emerge based on a number of issues:\n\n\nGlobal governance can be roughly divided into four stages:\n\nWorld authorities including international organizations and corporations achieve deference to their agenda through different means. Authority can derive from institutional status, expertise, moral authority, capacity, or perceived competence.\n\nIn its initial phase, world governance was able to draw on themes inherited from geopolitics and the theory of international relations, such as peace, defense, geostrategy, diplomatic relations, and trade relations. But as globalization progresses and the number of interdependencies increases, the global level is also highly relevant to a far wider range of subjects. Following are a number of examples.\n\n\"The crisis brought about by the accelerated pace and the probably irreversible character of the effect of human activities on nature requires collective answers from governments and citizens. Nature ignores political and social barriers, and the global dimension of the crisis cancels the effects of any action initiated unilaterally by state governments or sectoral institutions, however powerful they may be. Climate change, ocean and air pollution, nuclear risks and those related to genetic manipulation, the reduction and extinction of resources and biodiversity, and above all a development model that remains largely unquestioned globally are all among the various manifestations of this accelerated and probably irreversible effect.\n\nThis effect is the factor, in the framework of globalization, that most challenges a system of states competing with each other to the exclusion of all others: among the different fields of global governance, environmental management is the most wanting in urgent answers to the crisis in the form of collective actions by the whole of the human community. At the same time, these actions should help to model and strengthen the progressive building of this community.\"\n\nProposals in this area have discussed the issue of how collective environmental action is possible. Many multilateral, environment-related agreements have been forged in the past 30 years, but their implementation remains difficult. There is also some discussion on the possibility of setting up an international organization that would centralize all the issues related to international environmental protection, such as the proposed World Environment Organization (WEO). The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) could play this role, but it is a small-scale organization with a limited mandate. The question has given rise to two opposite views: the European Union, especially France and Germany, along with a number of NGOs, is in favor of creating a WEO; the United Kingdom, the US, and most developing countries prefer opting for voluntary initiatives.\n\nThe International Institute for Sustainable Development proposes a \"reform agenda\" for global environmental governance. The main argument is that there seems to exist an unspoken but powerful consensus on the essential objectives of a system of global environmental governance. These goals would require top-quality leadership, a strong environmental policy based on knowledge, effective cohesion and coordination, good management of the institutions constituting the environmental governance system, and spreading environmental concerns and actions to other areas of international policy and action.\n\nThe focus of environmental issues shifted to climate change from 1992 onwards. Due to the transboundary nature of climate change, various calls have been made for a World Environment Organisation (WEO) (sometimes referred to as a Global Environment Organisation) to tackle this global problem on a global scale. At present, a single worldwide governing body with the powers to develop and enforce environmental policy does not exist. The idea for the creation of a WEO was discussed thirty years ago but is receiving fresh attention in the light of arguably disappointing outcomes from recent, ‘environmental mega conferences’(e.g.Rio Summit and Earth Summit 2002).\n\nMultiple national environmental organizations are used to help build environments from the ground up. The Nature Conservancy helps from re-growing coral reefs to finding climate change solutions. The Nature Conservancy has scientists and volunteers in over 70 countries, working to conserve the world as much as possible. While creating international policies involving limiting pollution, the stop of habitat loss and trying to promote biodiversity, they work with other countries to find solutions. They go hand in hand with other international organizations that support finding ways to better the environment. The Environmental Defense Fund works with The Nature Conservancy to find solutions to environmental crises.\n\nInternational environmental organizations do exist. The United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), created in 1972, coordinates the environmental activity of countries in the UN. UNEP and similar international environmental organizations are seen as not up to the task. They are criticized as being institutionally weak, fragmented, lacking in standing and providing non-optimal environmental protection. It has been stated that the current decentralized, poorly funded and strictly intergovernmental regime for global environmental issues is sub-standard. However, the creation of a WEO may threaten to undermine some of the more effective aspects of contemporary global environmental governance; notably its fragmented nature, from which flexibility stems. This also allows responses to be more effective and links to be forged across different domains. Even though the environment and climate change are framed as global issues, Levin states that ‘it is precisely at this level that government institutions are least effective and trust most delicate’ while Oberthur and Gehring argue that it would offer little more than institutional restructuring for its own sake.\n\nThe UN is widely involved with the development of protecting the environment from an international perspective. In 2012 at the IN Conference on Sustainable Development, they have fully committed to working towards a safer and healthier environment. This ranges from the planting of trees to the type of cars citizens can drive. Between analyzing and writing multiple solutions, they have found possibilities to strengthen and enhance synergies among global environmental conventions.\n\nThere are multiple organizations involved in creating a strong environmental impact, although the changes are not being made. Over the past couple decades there has been a decrease in trend and an increase in risks to the environment. Global Governance reforms have been taken place to try and make changed, but it is the issue of making the game plans effective.\n\nMany proposals for the creation of a WEO have emerged from the trade and environment debate. It has been argued that instead of creating a WEO to safeguard the environment, environmental issues should be directly incorporated into the World Trade Organization (WTO). The WTO has “had success in integrating trade agreements and opening up markets because it is able to apply legal pressure to nation states and resolve disputes”. Greece and Germany are currently in discussion about the possibility of solar energy being used to repay some of Greece's debt after their economy crashed in 2010. This exchange of resources, if it is accepted, is an example of increased international cooperation and an instance where the WTO could embrace energy trade agreements. If the future holds similar trade agreements, then an environmental branch of the WTO would surely be necessary. However critics of a WTO/WEO arrangement say that this would neither concentrate on more directly addressing underlying market failures, nor greatly improve rule-making.\n\nThe creation of a new agency, whether it be linked to the WTO or not, has now been endorsed by Renato Ruggiero, the former head of the World Trade Organization (WTO), as well as by the new WTO director-designate, Supachai Panitchpakdi. The debate over a global institutional framework for environmental issues will undoubtedly rumble on but at present there is little support for any one proposal.\n\nWorld Trade involves a wide amount of funding and taxes when being sent from one state to another. Singapore's Prime Minister created a solution that would benefit all countries which would promote economic stability and sustainable growth for all states. The Eminent Person's Group (EPG) would control Financial Global Governance to create fair and equal regulations with all involved. This governance structure would require the development of finance institutions and would involve all countries working together.\n\nThe 2008 financial crisis may have undermined faith that laissez-faire capitalism will correct all serious financial malfunctioning on its own, as well as belief in the presumed independence of the economy from politics. It has been stated that, lacking in transparency and far from democratic, international financial institutions may be incapable of handling financial collapses. There are many who believe free-market capitalism may be incapable of forming the economic policy of a stable society, as it has been theorised that it can exacerbate inequalities.\n\nNonetheless, the debate on the potential failings of the system has led the academic world to seek solutions. According to Tubiana and Severino, \"refocusing the doctrine of international cooperation on the concept of public goods offers the possibility . . . of breaking the deadlock in international negotiations on development, with the perception of shared interests breathing new life into an international solidarity that is running out of steam.\"\n\nJoseph Stiglitz argues that a number of global public goods should be produced and supplied to the populations, but are not, and that a number of global externalities should be taken into consideration, but are not. On the other hand, he contends, the international stage is often used to find solutions to completely unrelated problems under the protection of opacity and secrecy, which would be impossible in a national democratic framework.\n\nOn the subject of international trade, Susan George states that \". . . in a rational world, it would be possible to construct a trading system serving the needs of people in both North and South. . . . Under such a system, crushing third world debt and the devastating structural adjustment policies applied by the World Bank and the IMF would have been unthinkable, although the system would not have abolished capitalism.\"\n\nBuilding a responsible world governance that would make it possible to adapt the political organization of society to globalization implies establishing a democratic political legitimacy at every level: local, national, regional and global.\n\nObtaining this legitimacy requires rethinking and reforming, all at the same time:\n\nThe political aspect of world governance is discussed in greater detail in the section Problems of World Governance and Principles of Governance\n\nThe political and institutional governments help protect the rights of humans and make all things equal between states. The middle balance prevents war breakouts and civil wars. They prevent the world from a global crisis and have programs to conduct research on ways to increase citizen participation in politics to become more involved. The increasing of interdependence has led to the incline of needing political and institutional governance.\n\nArmed conflicts have changed in form and intensity since the Berlin wall came down in 1989. The events of 9/11, the wars in Afghanistan and in Iraq, and repeated terrorist attacks all show that conflicts can repercuss well beyond the belligerents directly involved. The major powers and especially the United States, have used war as a means of resolving conflicts and may well continue to do so. If many in the United States believe that fundamentalist Muslim networks are likely to continue to launch attacks, in Europe nationalist movements have proved to be the most persistent terrorist threat. The Global War on Terrorism arguably presents a form of emerging global governance in the sphere of security with the United States leading cooperation among the Western states, non-Western nations and international institutions. Beyer argues that participation in this form of 'hegemonic governance' is caused both by a shared identity and ideology with the US, as well as cost-benefit considerations.\n\nAt the same time, civil wars continue to break out across the world, particularly in areas where civil and human rights are not respected, such as Central and Eastern Africa and the Middle East. These and other regions remain deeply entrenched in permanent crises, hampered by authoritarian regimes, many of them being supported by the United States, reducing entire swathes of the population to wretched living conditions. The wars and conflicts we are faced with have a variety of causes: economic inequality, social conflict, religious sectarianism, Western imperialism, colonial legacies, disputes over territory and over control of basic resources such as water or land. They are all illustrations a deep-rooted crisis of world governance.\n\nThe resulting bellicose climate imbues international relations with competitive nationalism and contributes, in rich and poor countries alike, to increasing military budgets, siphoning off huge sums of public money to the benefit of the arms industry and military-oriented scientific innovation, hence fueling global insecurity. Of these enormous sums, a fraction would be enough to provide a permanent solution for the basic needs of the planet's population hence practically eliminating the causes of war and terrorism.\n\nAndrée Michel argues that the arms race is not only proceeding with greater vigor, it is the surest means for Western countries to maintain their hegemony over countries of the South. Following the break-up of the Eastern bloc countries, she maintains, a strategy for the manipulation of the masses was set up with a permanent invention of an enemy (currently incarnated by Iraq, Iran, Libya, Syria, and North Korea) and by kindling fear and hate of others to justify perpetuating the Military–industrial complex and arms sales. The author also recalls that the \"Big Five\" at the UN who have the veto right are responsible for 85% of arms sales around the world.\n\nProposals for the governance of peace, security, and conflict resolution begin by addressing prevention of the causes of conflicts, whether economic, social, religious, political, or territorial. This requires assigning more resources to improving people's living conditions—health, accommodation, food, and work—and to education, including education in the values of peace, social justice, and unity and diversity as two sides of the same coin representing the global village.\n\nResources for peace could be obtained by regulating, or even reducing military budgets, which have done nothing but rise in the past recent years. This process could go hand in hand with plans for global disarmament and the conversion of arms industries, applied proportionally to all countries, including the major powers. Unfortunately, the warlike climate of the last decade has served to relegate all plans for global disarmament, even in civil-society debates, and to pigeonhole them as a long-term goal or even a Utopian vision. This is definitely a setback for the cause of peace and for humankind, but it is far from being a permanent obstacle.\n\nInternational institutions also have a role to play in resolving armed conflicts. Small international rapid deployment units could intervene in these with an exclusive mandate granted by a reformed and democratic United Nations system or by relevant regional authorities such as the European Union. These units could be formed specifically for each conflict, using armies from several countries as was the case when the UNIFIL was reinforced during the 2006 Lebanon War. On the other hand, no national army would be authorized to intervene unilaterally outside its territory without a UN or regional mandate.\n\nAnother issue that is worth addressing concerns the legitimate conditions for the use of force and conduct during war. Jean-Réné Bachelet offers an answer with the conceptualization of a military ethics corresponding to the need for a \"principle of humanity.\" The author defines this principle as follows: \"All human beings, whatever their race, nationality, gender, age, opinion, or religion, belong to one same humanity, and every individual has an inalienable right to respect for his life, integrity, and dignity.\"\n\nThe World Trade Organization's (WTO) agenda of liberalizing public goods and services are related to culture, science, education, health, living organisms, information, and communication. This plan has been only partially offset by the alter-globalization movement, starting with the events that took place at the 1999 Seattle meeting, and on a totally different and probably far more influential scale in the medium and long term, by the astounding explosion of collaborative practices on the Internet. However, lacking political and widespread citizen support as well as sufficient resources, civil society has not so far been able to develop and disseminate alternative plans for society as a whole on a global scale, even though plenty of proposals and initiatives have been developed, some more successful than others, to build a fairer, more responsible, and more solidarity-based world in all of these areas.\n\nAbove all, each country tries to impose their values and collective preferences within international institutions such like WTO or UNESCO, particularly in the Medias sector. This is an excellent opportunity to promote their soft power, for instance with the promotion of the cinema.\n\nAs far as science is concerned, \"[r]esearch increasingly bows to the needs of financial markets, turning competence and knowledge into commodities, making employment flexible and informal, and establishing contracts based on goals and profits for the benefit of private interests in compliance with the competition principle. The directions that research has taken in the past two decades and the changes it has undergone have drastically removed it from its initial mission (producing competence and knowledge, maintaining independence) with no questioning of its current and future missions. Despite the progress, or perhaps even as its consequence, humankind continues to face critical problems: poverty and hunger are yet to be vanquished, nuclear arms are proliferating, environmental disasters are on the rise, social injustice is growing, and so on.\n\nNeoliberal commercialization of the commons favors the interests of pharmaceutical companies instead of the patients', of food-processing companies instead of the farmers' and consumers'. Public research policies have done nothing but support this process of economic profitability, where research results are increasingly judged by the financial markets. The system of systematically patenting knowledge and living organisms is thus being imposed throughout the planet through the 1994 WTO agreements on intellectual property. Research in many areas is now being directed by private companies.\"\n\nOn the global level, \"[i]nstitutions dominating a specific sector also, at every level, present the risk of reliance on technical bodies that use their own references and deliberate in an isolated environment. This process can be observed with the 'community of patents' that promotes the patenting of living organisms, as well as with authorities controlling nuclear energy. This inward-looking approach is all the more dangerous that communities of experts are, in all complex technical and legal spheres, increasingly dominated by the major economic organizations that finance research and development.\"\n\nOn the other hand, several innovative experiments have emerged in the sphere of science, such as: conscience clauses and citizens' panels as a tool for democratizing the production system: science shops and community-based research. Politically committed scientists are also increasingly organizing at the global level.\n\nAs far as education is concerned, the effect of commoditization can be seen in the serious tightening of education budgets, which affects the quality of general education as a public service. The Global Future Online report reminds us that \". . . at the half-way point towards 2015 \"(author's note: the deadline for the Millennium Goals)\", the gaps are daunting: 80 million children (44 million of them girls) are out of school, with marginalized groups (26 million disabled and 30 million conflict-affected children) continuing to be excluded. And while universal access is critical, it must be coupled with improved learning outcomes—in particular, children achieving the basic literacy, numeracy and life skills essential for poverty reduction.\"\n\nIn addition to making the current educational system available universally, there is also a call to improve the system and adapt it to the speed of changes in a complex and unpredictable world. On this point, Edgar Morin asserts that we must \"[r]ethink our way of organizing knowledge. This means breaking down the traditional barriers between disciplines and designing new ways to reconnect that which has been torn apart.\" The UNESCO report drawn up by Morin contains \"seven principles for education of the future\": detecting the error and illusion that have always parasitized the human spirit and human behavior; making knowledge relevant, i.e. a way of thinking that makes distinctions and connections; teaching the human condition; teaching terrestrial identity; facing human and scientific uncertainties and teaching strategies to deal with them; teaching understanding of the self and of others, and an ethics for humankind.\n\nThe exponential growth of new technologies, the Internet in particular, has gone hand in hand with the development over the last decade of a global community producing and exchanging goods. This development is permanently altering the shape of the entertainment, publishing, and music and media industries, among others. It is also influencing the social behavior of increasing numbers of people, along with the way in which institutions, businesses, and civil society are organized. Peer-to-peer communities and collective knowledge-building projects such as Wikipedia have involved millions of users around the world. There are even more innovative initiatives, such as alternatives to private copyright such as Creative Commons, cyber democracy practices, and a real possibility of developing them on the sectoral, regional, and global levels.\n\nRegional players, whether regional conglomerates such as Mercosur and the European Union, or major countries seen as key regional players such as China, the United States, and India, are taking a growing interest in world governance. Examples of discussion of this issue can be found in the works of: Martina Timmermann \"et al.\", \"Institutionalizing Northeast Asia: Regional Steps toward Global Governance\"; Douglas Lewis, \"Global Governance and the Quest for Justice - Volume I: International and Regional Organizations\"; Olav Schram Stokke, \"Examining the Consequences of International Regimes,\" which discusses Northern, or Arctic region building in the context of international relations; Jeffery Hart and Joan Edelman Spero, \"Globalization and Global Governance in the 21st Century,\" which discusses the push of countries such as Mexico, Brazil, India, China, Taiwan, and South Korea, \"important regional players\" seeking \"a seat at the table of global decision-making\"; Dr. Frank Altemöller, “International Trade: Challenges for Regional and Global Governance: A comparison between Regional Integration Models in Eastern Europe and Africa – and the role of the WTO”, and many others.\n\nInterdependence among countries and regions hardly being refutable today, regional integration is increasingly seen not only as a process in itself, but also in its relation to the rest of the world, sometimes turning questions like \"What can the world bring to my country or region?\" into \"What can my country or region bring to the rest of the world?\" Following are a few examples of how regional players are dealing with these questions.\n\nOften seen as a problem to be solved rather than a people or region with an opinion to express on international policy, Africans and Africa draw on a philosophical tradition of community and social solidarity that can serve as inspiration to the rest of the world and contribute to building world governance. One example is given by Sabelo J. Ndlovu-Gathseni when he reminds us of the relevance of the Ubuntu concept, which stresses the interdependence of human beings.\n\nAfrican civil society has thus begun to draw up proposals for governance of the continent, which factor in all of the dimensions: local, African, and global. Examples include proposals by the network \"Dialogues sur la gouvernance en Afrique\" for \"the construction of a local legitimate governance,\" state reform \"capable of meeting the continent's development challenges,\" and \"effective regional governance to put an end to Africa's marginalization.\"\n\nForeign-policy proposals announced by President Barack Obama include restoring the Global Poverty Act, which aims to contribute to meeting the UN Millennium Development Goals to reduce by half the world population living on less than a dollar a day by 2015. Foreign aid is expected to double to 50 billion dollars. The money will be used to help build educated and healthy communities, reduce poverty and improve the population's health.\n\nThe United States and China have been working side by side to improve foreign policy and global governance. There has been a 3-year project to support the international business industry. They have discussed climate change, areas of trade, investment and finance. \nThe Research Center for Chinese Politics and Business (RCCPB) has done the majority of international relationship meetings and has input the most solutions for development including bringing scholars from all around the world to meet and discuss action plans.\n\nIn terms of international institutions, The White House Web site advocates reform of the World Bank and the IMF, without going into any detail.\n\nBelow are further points in the Obama-Biden plan for foreign policy directly related to world governance:\n\nThe 21st century has seen the arrival of a new and diverse generation of left-wing governments in Latin America. This has opened the door to initiatives to launch political and governance renewal. A number of these initiatives are significant for the way they redefine the role of the state by drawing on citizen participation, and can thus serve as a model for a future world governance built first and foremost on the voice of the people. The constituent assemblies in Ecuador and Bolivia are fundamental examples of this phenomenon.\n\nIn Ecuador, social and indigenous movements were behind the discussions that began in 1990 on setting up a constituent assembly. In the wake of Rafael Correa's arrival at the head of the country in November 2006, widespread popular action with the slogan \"\"que se vayan todos\"\" (let them all go away) succeeded in getting all the political parties of congress to accept a convocation for a referendum on setting up the assembly.\n\nIn April 2007, Rafael Correa's government organized a consultation with the people to approve setting up a constituent assembly. Once it was approved, 130 members of the assembly were elected in September, including 100 provincial members, 24 national members and 6 for migrants in Europe, Latin America and the USA. The assembly was officially established in November. Assembly members belonged to traditional political parties as well as the new social movements. In July 2008, the assembly completed the text for the new constitution and in September 2008 there was a referendum to approve it. Approval for the new text won out, with 63.9% of votes for compared to 28.1% of votes against and a 24.3% abstention rate.\n\nThe new constitution establishes the rule of law on economic, social, cultural and environmental rights (ESCER). It transforms the legal model of the social state subject to the rule of law into a \"constitution of guaranteed well-being\" (\"Constitución del bienestar garantizado\") inspired by the ancestral community ideology of \"good living\" propounded by the Quechuas of the past, as well as by 21st century socialist ideology. The constitution promotes the concept of food sovereignty by establishing a protectionist system that favors domestic production and trade. It also develops a model of public aid for education, health, infrastructures and other services.\n\nIn addition, it adds to the three traditional powers, a fourth power called the Council of Citizen Participation and Social Control, made up of former constitutional control bodies and social movements, and mandated to assess whether public policies are constitutional or not.\n\nThe new Bolivian constitution was approved on 25 January 2009 by referendum, with 61.4% votes in favor, 38.6% against and a 90.2% turnout. The proposed constitution was prepared by a constituent assembly that did not only reflect the interests of political parties and the elite, but also represented the indigenous peoples and social movements. As in Ecuador, the proclamation of a constituent assembly was demanded by the people, starting in 1990 at a gathering of indigenous peoples from the entire country, continuing with the indigenous marches in the early 2000s and then with the Program Unity Pact (\"Pacto de Unidad Programático\") established by family farmers and indigenous people in September 2004 in Santa Cruz.\n\nThe constitution recognizes the autonomy of indigenous peoples, the existence of a specific indigenous legal system, exclusive ownership of forest resources by each community and a quota of indigenous members of parliament. It grants autonomy to counties, which have the right to manage their natural resources and elect their representatives directly. The \"latifundio\" system has been outlawed, with maximum ownership of 5,000 hectares allowed per person. Access to water and sanitation are covered by the constitution as human rights that the state has to guarantee, as well as other basic services such as electricity, gas, postal services, and telecommunications that can be provided by either the state or contracting companies. The new constitution also establishes a social and community economic model made up of public, private, and social organizations, and cooperatives. It guarantees private initiative and freedom of enterprise, and assigns public organizations the task of managing natural resources and related processes as well as developing public services covered by the constitution. National and cooperative investment is favored over private and international investment.\nThe \"unitary plurinational\" state of Bolivia has 36 official indigenous languages along with Spanish. Natural resources belong to the people and are administered by the state. The form of democracy in place is no longer considered as exclusively representative and/or based on parties. Thus, \"the people deliberate and exercise government via their representatives and the constituent assembly, the citizen legislative initiative and the referendum . . .\" and \"popular representation is exercised via the political parties, citizen groups, and indigenous peoples.\" This way, \"political parties, and/or citizen groups and/or indigenous peoples can present candidates directly for the offices of president, vice-president, senator, house representative, constituent-assembly member, councilor, mayor, and municipal agent. The same conditions apply legally to all. . . .\"\n\nAlso in Latin America: \"Amazonia . . . is an enormous biodiversity reservoir and a major climate-regulation agent for the planet but is being ravaged and deteriorated at an accelerated pace; it is a territory almost entirely devoid of governance, but also a breeding place of grassroots organization initiatives.\". \"Amazonia can be the fertile field of a true school of 'good' governance if it is looked after as a common and valuable good, first by Brazilians (65% of Amazonia is within Brazilian borders) and the people of the South American countries surrounding it, but also by all the Earth's inhabitants.\"\nAccordingly, \"[f]rom a world-governance perspective, [Amazonia] is in a way an enormous laboratory. Among other things, Amazonia enables a detailed examination of the negative effects of productivism and of the different forms of environmental packaging it can hide behind, including 'sustainable development.' Galloping urbanization, Human Rights violations, the many different types of conflicts (14 different types of conflicts have been identified within the hundreds of cases observed in Amazonia), protection of indigenous populations and their active participation in local governance: these are among the many Amazonian challenges also affecting the planet as a whole, not to mention the environment. The hosts of local initiatives, including among the indigenous populations, are however what may be most interesting in Amazonia in that they testify to the real, concrete possibility of a different form of organization that combines a healthy local economy, good social cohesion, and a true model of sustainable development—this time not disguised as something else. All of this makes Amazonia 'a territory of solutions.'\"\n\nAccording to Arnaud Blin, the Amazonian problem helps to define certain fundamental questions on the future of humankind. First, there is the question of social justice: \"[H]ow do we build a new model of civilization that promotes social justice? How do we set up a new social architecture that allows us to live together?\" The author goes on to refer to concepts such as the concept of \"people's territory \" or even \"life territory\" rooted in the indigenous tradition and serving to challenge private property and social injustice. He then suggests that the emerging concept of the \"responsibility to protect,\" following up on the \"right of humanitarian intervention\" and until now used to try to protect populations endangered by civil wars, could also be applied to populations threatened by economic predation and to environmental protection.\n\nThe growing interest in world governance in Asia represents an alternative approach to official messages, dominated by states' nationalist visions. An initiative to develop proposals for world governance took place in Shanghai in 2006, attended by young people from every continent. The initiative produced ideas and projects that can be classified as two types: the first and more traditional type, covering the creation of a number of new institutions such as an International Emissions Organization, and a second more innovative type based on organizing network-based systems. For example, a system of cooperative control on a worldwide level among states and self-organization of civil society into networks using new technologies, a process that should serve to set up a \"Global Calling-for-Help Center\" or a new model based on citizens who communicate freely, share information, hold discussions, and seek consensus-based solutions. They would use the Internet and the media, working within several types of organizations: universities, NGOs, local volunteers and civil-society groups.\n\nGiven the demographic importance of the continent, the development of discussion on governance and practices in Asia at the regional level, as well as global-level proposals, will be decisive in the years ahead in the strengthening of global dialog among all sorts of stakeholders, a dialog that should produce a fairer world order.(See Kishore Mahbubani).\n\nAccording to Michel Rocard, Europe does not have a shared vision, but a collective history that allows Europeans to opt for projects for gradual political construction such as the European Union. Drawing on this observation, Rocard conceives of a European perspective that supports the development of three strategies for constructing world governance: reforming the UN, drawing up international treaties to serve as the main source of global regulations, and \"the progressive penetration of the international scene by justice.\"\n\nEurope does not have the same views as other nations, however according to the Ambassador of Vienna, Walther Lichem, \"Today, every citizen can contribute to the recognition of the dignity of the other and the related human rights. The impact of citizen-focused human rights programs is visible in human rights cities in all regions of the world. The citizen creating conditions of societal cohesion also essentially contributes to peace and security.\" Overall, having the same human rights goal is the ultimate end game in all nations. \nEurope's main focus now through global governance is to keep the trend of peacekeeping. Involved in the peacekeeping is Ireland, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Germany, Austria, Belgium and Norway. They have worked with The International Collaboration Research Network to establish rules and norms to follow by.\n\nRocard considers that there are a number of \"great questions of the present days\" including recognition by all nations of the International Criminal Court, the option of an international police force authorized to arrest international criminals, and the institution of judicial procedures to deal with tax havens, massively polluting activities, and states supporting terrorist activities. He also outlines \"new problems\" that should foster debate in the years to come on questions such as a project for a Declaration of Interdependence, how to re-equilibrate world trade and WTO activities, and how to create world regulations for managing collective goods (air, drinking water, oil, etc.) and services (education, health, etc.).\n\nMartin Ortega similarly suggests that the European Union should make a more substantial contribution to global governance, particularly through concerted action in international bodies. European states, for instance, should reach an agreement on the reform of the United Nations Security Council.\n\nIn 2011, the European Strategy and Policy Analysis System (ESPAS), an inter-institutional pilot project of the European Union which aims to assist EU policy formulation through the identification and critical analysis of long-term global trends, highlighted the importance of expanding global governance over the next 20 years.\n\nIt is too soon to give a general account of the view of world-governance stakeholders, although interest in world governance is on the rise on the regional level, and we will certainly see different types of stakeholders and social sectors working to varying degrees at the international level and taking a stand on the issue in the years to come.\n\nThe World Parliamentary Forum, open to members of parliament from all nations and held every year at the same time as the World Social Forum, drew up a declaration at the sixth forum in Caracas in 2006. The declaration contains a series of proposals that express participants' opinion on the changes referred to.\n\nThe European Commission referred to global governance in its White Paper on European Governance. It contends that the search for better global governance draws on the same set of shared challenges humanity is currently facing. These challenges can be summed up by a series of goals: sustainable development, security, peace and equity (in the sense of \"fairness\").\n\nThe freedom of thought enjoyed by non-state stakeholders enables them to formulate truly alternative ideas on world-governance issues, but they have taken little or no advantage of this opportunity.\n\nPierre Calame believes that \"[n]on-state actors have always played an essential role in global regulation, but their role will grow considerably in this, the beginning of the twenty-first Century . . . Non-state actors play a key role in world governance in different domains . . . To better understand and develop the non-state actors' role, it should be studied in conjunction with the general principles of governance.\" \"Non-state actors, due to their vocation, size, flexibility, methods of organization and action, interact with states in an equal manner; however this does not mean that their action is better adapted.\"\n\nOne alternative idea encapsulated by many not-for-profit organisations relates to ideas in the 'Human Potential Movement' and might be summarised as a mission statement along these lines: 'To create an accepted framework for all humankind, that is self-regulating and which enables every person to achieve their fullest potential in harmony with the world and its place in existence.'\n\nSince the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, references to the universal collective of humanity have begun using the term 'humankind' rather than 'mankind', given the gender neutral quality of the former.\n\n'Self-regulation' is meant to invoke the concept of regulation which includes rule-making such as laws, and related ideas e.g. legal doctrine as well as other frameworks. However its scope is wider than this and intended to encompass cybernetics which allows for the study of regulation in as many varied contexts as possible from the regulation of gene expression to the Press Complaints Commission for example.\n\nSince 2005, religious leaders from a diverse array of faith traditions have engaged in dialogue with G8 leaders around issues of global governance and world risk. Drawing on the cultural capital of diverse religious traditions, they seek to strengthen democratic norms by influencing political leaders to include the interests of the most vulnerable when they make their decisions. Some have argued that religion is a key to transforming or fixing global governance.\n\nSeveral stakeholders have produced lists of proposals for a new world governance that is fairer, more responsible, solidarity-based, interconnected and respectful of the planet's diversity. Some examples are given below.\n\nJoseph E. Stiglitz proposes a list of reforms related to the internal organization of international institutions and their external role in the framework of global-governance architecture. He also deals with global taxation, the management of global resources and the environment, the production and protection of global knowledge, and the need for a global legal infrastructure.\n\nA number of other proposals are contained in the World Governance Proposal Paper: giving concrete expression to the principle of responsibility; granting civil society greater involvement in drawing up and implementing international regulations; granting national parliaments greater involvement in drawing up and implementing international regulations; re-equilibrating trade mechanisms and adopting regulations to benefit the southern hemisphere; speeding up the institution of regional bodies; extending and specifying the concept of the commons; redefining proposal and decision-making powers in order to reform the United Nations; developing independent observation, early-warning, and assessment systems; diversifying and stabilizing the basis for financing international collective action; and engaging in a wide-reaching process of consultation, a new Bretton Woods for the United Nations.\n\nThis list provides more examples of proposals:\n\nDr. Rajesh Tandon, president of the FIM (Montreal International Forum) and of PRIA (Participatory Research in Asia), prepared a framework document entitled \"Democratization of Global Governance for Global Democracy: Civil Society Visions and Strategies (G05) conference.\" He used the document to present five principles that could provide a basis for civil society actions: \"Global institutions and agenda should be subjected to democratic political accountability.\"\n\nVijaya Ramachandran, Enrique Rueda-Sabater and Robin Kraft also define principles for representation of nations and populations in the system of global governance. They propose a \"Two Percent Club\" that would provide for direct representation of nations with at least two percent of global population or global GDP; other nations would be represented within international fora through regional blocs.\n\nIn the light of the unclear meaning of the term \"global governance\" as a concept in international politics, some authors have proposed defining it not in substantive, but in disciplinary and methodological terms. For these authors, global governance is better understood as an analytical concept or optic that provides a specific perspective on world politics different from that of conventional international relations theory. Thomas G. Weiss and Rorden Wilkinson have even argued that global governance has the capacity to overcome some of the fragmentation of international relations as a discipline particularly when understood as a set of questions about the governance of world orders.\n\nSome universities, including those offering courses in international relations, have begun to establish degree programmes in global governance.\n\nThe view regarding the establishment of global governance is based on the difficulties to achieve equitable development at the world scale. \"To secure for all human beings in all parts of the world the conditions allowing a decent and meaningful life requires enormous human energies and far-reaching changes in policies. The task is all the more demanding as the world faces numerous other problems, each related to or even part of the development challenge, each similarly pressing, and each calling for the same urgent attention. But, as Arnold Toynbee has said, 'Our age is the first generation since the dawn of history in which mankind dares to believe it practical to make the benefits of civilization available to the whole human race'.\"\n\nThe rise of global governance has been in effect since Alexander the Great led Greece to dominance of the world, only to become one of the victim of Rome's quest for world dominance. The 20th century is no different than worlds prior.\n\nBecause of the heterogeneity of preferences, which are enduring despite globalization, are often perceived as an implacable homogenization process. Tolerance for inequalities and the growing demand for redistribution, attitudes toward risk, and over property rights vs human rights, set the stage. In certain cases, globalization even serves to accentuate differences rather than as a force for homogenization. \nWith the growing emergence of a global civic awareness, comes opposition to globalization and its effects. A rapidly growing number of movements and organizations have taken the debate to the international level. Although it may have limitations, this trend is one response to the increasing importance of world issues, that effect the planet.\n\nWith good global governance, the states will see efficient processes, visibility in errors, reduced costs, smoother running operations and conforming products in the market. The need for a strong global governance is high because all people seek to see these results.\n\nPierre Jacquet, Jean Pisani-Ferry, and Laurence Tubiana argue that \"[t]o ensure that decisions taken for international integration are sustainable, it is important that populations see the benefits, that states agree on their goals and that the institutions governing the process are seen as legitimate. These three conditions are only partially being met. Taklya\"\n\nThe authors refer to a \"crisis of purpose\" and international institutions suffering from \"imbalance\" and inadequacy. They believe that for these institutions, \"a gap has been created between the nature of the problems that need tackling and an institutional architecture which does not reflect the hierarchy of today's problems. For example, the environment has become a subject of major concern and central negotiation, but it does not have the institutional support that is compatible with its importance.\"\n\nGlobal governance is not world government, and even less democratic globalization. In fact, global governance would not be necessary, were there a world government. Domestic governments have monopolies on the use of force—the power of enforcement. Global governance refers to the political interaction that is required to solve problems that affect more than one state or region when there is no power to enforce compliance. Problems arise, and networks of actors are constructed to deal with them in the absence of an international analogue to a domestic government. This system has been termed disaggregated sovereignty.\n\nImproved global problem solving need not involve the establishment of additional powerful formal global institutions. It does involve building consensus on norms and practices. One such area, currently under construction, is the development and improvement of accountability mechanisms. For example, the UN Global Compact brings together companies, UN agencies, labor organizations, and civil society to support universal environmental and social principles. Participation is entirely voluntary, and there is no enforcement of the principles by an outside regulatory body. Companies adhere to these practices both because they make economic sense, and because stakeholders, especially shareholders, can monitor their compliance easily. Mechanisms such as the Global Compact can improve the ability of affected individuals and populations to hold companies accountable. However, corporations participating in the UN Global Compact have been criticized for their merely minimal standards, the absence of sanction-and-control measures, their lack of commitment to social and ecological standards, minimal acceptance among corporations around the world, and the high cost involved in reporting annually to small and medium-sized business\n\nBitcoin & Beyond: Blockchains, Globalization, and Global Governance workshop brings together an interdisciplinary group of researchers to examine the implications that blockchains pose for globalization and global governance.\n\nOne effect of globalization is the increasing regulation of businesses in the global marketplace. Jan Aart Scholte asserts, however, that these changes are inadequate to meet the needs: \"Along with the general intensified globalization of social relations in contemporary history has come an unprecedented expansion of regulatory apparatuses that cover planetary jurisdictions and constituencies. On the whole, however, this global governance remains weak relative to pressing current needs for global public policy. Shortfalls in moral standing, legal foundations, material delivery, democratic credentials and charismatic leadership have together generated large legitimacy deficits in existing global regimes.\"\n\nProposals and initiatives have been developed by various sources to set up networks and institutions operating on a global scale: political parties, unions, regional authorities, and members of parliament in sovereign states.\n\nOne of the conditions for building a world democratic governance should be the development of platforms for citizen dialogue on the legal formulation of world governance and the harmonization of objectives.\n\nThis legal formulation could take the form of a Global Constitution. According to Pierre Calame and Gustavo Marin, \"[a] Global Constitution resulting from a process for the institution of a global community will act as the common reference for establishing the order of rights and duties applicable to United Nations agencies and to the other multilateral institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization.\" As for formulating objectives, the necessary but insufficient ambition of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals, which aim to safeguard humankind and the planet, and the huge difficulties in implementing them, illustrates the inadequacy of institutional initiatives that do not have popular support for having failed to invite citizens to take part in the elaboration process.\n\nFurthermore, the Global Constitution \"must clearly express a limited number of overall objectives that are to be the basis of global governance and are to guide the common action of the U.N. agencies and the multilateral institutions, where the specific role of each of these is subordinated to the pursuit of these common objectives.\"\n\nCalame proposes the following objectives:\n\nIs the UN capable of taking on the heavy responsibility of managing the planet's serious problems? More specifically, can the UN reform itself in such a way as to be able to meet this challenge? At a time when the financial crisis of 2008 is raising the same questions posed by the climate disasters of previous years regarding the unpredictable consequences of disastrous human management, can international financial institutions be reformed in such a way as to go back to their original task, which was to provide financial help to countries in need?\n\nLack of political will and citizen involvement at the international level has also brought about the submission of international institutions to the \"neoliberal\" agenda, particularly financial institutions such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Trade Organization (WTO). Pierre Calame gives an account of this development, while Joseph E. Stiglitz points out that the need for international institutions like the IMF, the World Bank, and the WTO has never been so great, but people's trust in them has never been so low.\n\nOne of the key aspects of the United Nations reform is the problem of the representativeness of the General Assembly. The Assembly operates on the principle of \"one state, one vote,\" so that states of hugely varying sizes have the same effect on the vote, which distorts representativeness and results in a major loss of credibility. Accordingly, \"the General Assembly has lost any real capacity to influence. This means that the mechanisms for action and consultation organized by rich countries have the leading role.\"\n\nGustave Massiah advocates defining and implementing a radical reform of the UN. The author proposes building new foundations that can provide the basis for global democracy and the creation of a Global Social Contract, rooted in the respect and protection of civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights, as well as in the recognition of the strategic role of international law.\n\nThere is the jurisdictional gap, between the increasing need for global governance in many areas - such as health - and the lack of an authority with the power, or jurisdiction, to take action.\nMoreover, the gap of incentive between the need for international cooperation and the motivation to undertake it. The incentive gap is said to be closing as globalization provides increasing impetus for countries to cooperate. However, there are concerns that, as Africa lags further behind economically, its influence on global governance processes will diminish. At last, the participation gap, which refers to the fact that international cooperation remains primarily the affair of governments, leaving civil society groups on the fringes of policy-making. On the other hand, globalization of communication is facilitating the development of global civil society movements.\n\nInadequate global institutions, agreements or networks as well as political and national interests may impede global governance and lead to failures. Such are the consequence of ineffective global governance processes. Qin calls it a necessity to \"reconstruct ideas for effective global governance and sustainable world order, which should include the principles of pluralism, partnership, and participation\" for a change to this phenomenon. The 2012 Global Risks Report places global governance failure at the center of gravity in its geopolitical category.\n\nStudies of global governance are conducted at several academic institutions such as the Balsillie School of International Affairs, LSE's Department of International Relations, the Leuven Centre for Global Governance Studies, the Global Governance Programme at the European University Institute, and the Center for Global Governance at Columbia Law School.\n\nJournals dedicated to the studies of global governance include the Chinese Journal of Global Governance, the Global Policy Journal at Durham University, , and Kosmos Journal for Global Transformation.\n\n\n"}

The \"St. James-Bond\" name derived from the merger of \"St. James Square Presbyterian Church\" with \"Bond Street Congregational Church\" in 1928. Prior to the merger, they were separate congregations downtown, of the Presbyterian and Congregational traditions respectively.\n\nThe church building at 1066 Avenue Road was vacated on February 28, 2006. The building was torn down in the summer of 2006, and the site is now the Living Life on the Avenue Seniors Retirement Residence.\n\nThe building had been used by Elections Canada for a polling place. In 2008, some voters were mistakenly told to vote at the demolished church, instead of at the new polling place at Marshall McLuhan Catholic Secondary School.\n\nOriginally located east of Yonge Street on Dundas Street, the congregation moved uptown in 1927, to a growing suburban development north of Eglinton Avenue. The Bond Street building was acquired by a pentecostal church, \"Evangel Temple\". The building was destroyed by fire after Evangel Temple moved to the Hoggs Hollow area, near Yonge and York Mills, on September 19, 1981.\n\nLocated on Gerrard Street, just east of Yonge, on the present site of Ryerson University's St. James Square Campus, this was the third building of the \"Second United Presbyterian Church of Toronto\". It was built in 1879, replacing a much smaller building on nearby Gould Street that had been built by architect William Hay in 1855.\n\nThe United Presbyterian Church's Canadian synod approved the division of their Toronto, Canada West \"Bay Street United Presbyterian Church\" congregation in 1853 to assist in the move of their \"Divinity Hall\" from London to Toronto. In 1861, the merger of the UPC with the Free Church saw the Divinity School merge with Knox College, and \"Gould Street Church\" grew under the leadership of:\n\n\nBoth congregations joined the United Church of Canada in 1925. Each had declined as Toronto grew and parishioners joined congregations closer to their homes, some started by the respective congregations.\n\nSt. James Square was the \"parent\" of College Street United Church and St. John's Presbyterian Church, Toronto. Bond Street was the parent of Birchcliff Church in Scarborough Township (now Birchcliff Bluffs United Church). Bond Street was the first of the two congregations to move into a new area, joined by their former downtown neighbour a year later.\n\nIan Fleming apparently stayed with a friend on Avenue Road across from the church, and he later went on to write books about a character named James Bond.\n\n\n"}

The ship was built in Marmaris, Turkey, in 1996 to provide a replica of a frigate for the production of the ITV series adapted from the novels about Royal Navy officer Horatio Hornblower by C. S. Forester. Nowadays the tall ship is used mainly in sailing events, for corporate or private charter, and for receptions in her spacious saloon or on her deck. In 2010 the French company Étoile Marine Croisières, based at Saint-Malo, Brittany, purchased the ship and renamed her \"Étoile du Roy\".\n\nThe role model for the replica was a frigate designed by Michael Turk of Turks Shipyard Ltd. of Chatham, which was established in 1710. The modern replica was constructed of iroko planking over laminated mahogany frames. She has an overall length of , and is at the waterline, with a beam of and a draught of . The frigate is square-rigged on three masts with a sail area of , and has two Kelvin TAS8 diesel engines, and a bow thruster, as well as four AC generators for electrical power.\n\nThe ship was originally fitted with six 9-pounder replica cannons constructed by the naval dockyard of Sevastopol, Ukraine. These guns consisted of a high tensile steel tube encased in moulded alloy to resemble the original weapons, and were designed only to fire black powder charges. On 24 August 2001 a crew member was injured after a premature explosion during the firing of a gun, while the ship was taking part in the International Festival of the Sea at Portsmouth. The Marine Accident Investigation Branch were obliged to consult the Keeper of Artillery from the Royal Armouries museum for technical assistance and advice.\n\n\"Grand Turk\" is familiar as a stand in for in the TV series \"Hornblower\", although the historical \"Indefatigable\" was a much larger ship. She also served in the same TV series as the French ship \"Papillon\".

{"id": "1940863", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1940863", "title": "Weinsberg", "text": "Weinsberg\n\nWeinsberg (South Franconian: \"Weischberg\") is a town in the north of the German state Baden-Württemberg. It was founded around 1200 and is situated in the Heilbronn district. The town has about 11,800 inhabitants. It is noted for its wine.\n\nWeinsberg lies in the eastern Heilbronn district in the northeast part of Baden-Wuerttemberg, between the Neckar in the west and the Löwenstein mountains in the east. The small river Sulm rises from the Löwenstein mountains and flows into the Neckar after approximately . The valley formed of the Sulm and its tributaries is called \"Weinsberger Tal\". The city mainly lies in and on the tendencies of the valley of the Stadtseebach (also called Saubach), a southern tributary of the Sulm. The Sulm flows by Weinsberg's area, but not by the city itself, and only a small northern part of the city lies at the edge of the Sulm valley.\nNorthwest of the town centre rises the Burgberg, with the ruins of \"Weibertreu\" castle, west of it the Scheuerberg. Both mountains are used intensively for viticulture. In the east extends the Sulm valley, south the cultivated area are the Stadtseebach valley and the Brühl valley. In the south and the west the city borders on the Heilbronn mountains, which are wooded foothills of the Löwenstein mountains. They begin in the east with the Reisberg and extend over the Hintersberg and the \"Waldheide\" up to the Galgenberg and the Wartberg in the west. On the Wartberg the valley of the Stadtseebach continues, north of it the Schemelsberg mentioned above in the northwest.\n\nThe Sulm valley in the north of the Schemelsberg becomes dominated by the A 6, which meets the A 81 by the Weinsberg interchange in the north-east of the town. North of the Sulmtal continues the wooded \"Sulmer Bergebene\". The A 81 towards Stuttgart runs approximately along the eastern boundary border of Weinsberg.\n\nThe lowest point of the boundary lies at the Sulm with 166 m elevation. The highest point lies on the northern slope of the Reisberg at the southeast boundary border to Heilbronn with 338 m elevation.\n\nWeinsberg is situated on the edge of a Keuper area of the Löwenstein mountains, whose foothills extend until Neckarsulm and Öhringen. The Burgberg and Schemelsberg are buttes being separated by Sulm and Stadtseebach from the remaining mountain stick. Both have a stratum of sandstone, which was used both for the Weibertreu castle and the Johanneskirche. At the Burgberg from 1811 to 1867 gypsum was reduced. The hole being left by the gypsum dismantling in the mountain was filled up again in the 1950s and converted into vineyards of the local viticulture school.\n\nIn former times in the periphery of Weinsberg 10 quarries were operated. In Weinsberg there were quarries at the southwest border to Heilbronn as well as on the Burgberg (the last one very small).\n\nThe town of Weinsberg covers , about of which are allotted to Weinsberg, to Gellmersbach, to Grantschen and to Wimmental .\n\nBy the incorporations the form of the communal land can be compared with an irregular (Greek) cross, whereby Weinsberg represents the short west and the thickened south bar. Gellmersbach represents the north bar; Grantschen and Wimmental represent the extended east bar. The expansion in north–south direction amounts to about , in west–east direction about . In 1957 as well as 1988-2004 the land use distributed itself as follows: \nThe settlement surface increases continuously, since Weinsberg still proves construction sites. Conversely the agriculturally used surface decreases.\nThe urban forest possession amounts to altogether 567 ha. Beside 426 ha forest on the communal land of Weinsberg and its localities the city also possesses 141 ha forest on the communal land of Gemmingen, which was acquired on 29 July 1936, as reconciliation for Weinsberg's area deliveries to the state for military purposes (extension of Heilbronn's drilling place on the Waldheide).\n\nNeighboring municipalities of Weinsberg are (clockwise from the west): the city Heilbronn (Stadtkreis) and the municipalities Erlenbach, Eberstadt, Bretzfeld (Hohenlohekreis), Obersulm, Ellhofen and Lehrensteinsfeld. With the exception of Heilbronn and Bretzfeld all belong to the district of Heilbronn. Together with Eberstadt, Ellhofen and Lehrensteinsfeld Weinsberg has combined to form a joint association of administrations called \"„Raum Weinsberg“\" seated in Weinsberg.\nExcept from the town itself, Weinsberg consists of the incorporated localities of Gellmersbach, Grantschen and Wimmental. Outside of the closed land development are the places Weißenhof (with clinical center), Rappenhof and Stöcklesberg belonging to Weinsberg, without it dealing thereby with own localities. Gone off no longer existing places on Weinsberg's communal land are Bodelshofen, Burkhardswiesen (or Burchardeswiesen), Holßhofen, In dem Gründe, Lyndach, Uff the Wier and Wolfshöfle.\n\nThe climate is mostly mild by the protected valley situation and favours the extensively operated viticulture. The annual average duration of sunshine amounts on 1638.7 hours.\n\nAccording to annual reports of the viticulture school Weinsberg, the average yearly temperature during 1961-1990 was , the annual precipitation was about . Values for the period 1971-2000 are at and 2002 at . January from 1961 to 1990 had on the average at precipitation, 1971-2000 at and 2002 at . July had from 1961 to 1990 on the average at precipitation, 1971-2000 at and 2002 at .\n\nAccording to meteorological data of the viticulture school the average yearly temperature in Weinsberg increased from 1900 to 2006 from to .\n\nThe earliest known settlement trace in Weinsberg is a group of tumuli. They're situated in the forest near the boundary to Heilbronn and haven't been investigated so far. It is assumed that the tumuli are to be assigned to the Hallstatt culture.\n\nIn the 19th century there was found a Celtic silver coin from the 2nd century BC. Its inscription \"V, O, L, C\" can be assigned to the Celtic tribe of the Volcae, which lived (among other places) in Southern Germany at that time. So it can be assumed that Celts lived at least occasionally in the area of today's Weinsberg.\n\nHowever, the first solidly attested settlers in the area of Weinsberg were the Romans. In the 2nd century, a Roman road led through today's town, running from the Böckingen castellet (belonging to the Neckar Limes) to the Öhringen castellet (belonging to the Limes Germanicus). Between 148 and 161 AD, a Roman villa rustica was established on this road, which existed until its destruction by the Alamanni in 234 or 259/260. The bath house of this manor (known in Weinsberg as \"Römerbad\", i.e. \"Roman bath\") was excavated and conserved in 1906; parts of the remaining manor followed in 1977.\n\nAround 500 AD, the Alamanni were displaced by the Franks, who settled on Weinsberg's communal land between Erlenbach and Gellmersbach in the 7th century. In 778 the area around Weinsberg was first mentioned as \"Sulmanachgowe\" in a deed of donation of Charlemagne to the Lorsch Abbey. In the area of today's Weinsberg several medieval settlements (Bodelshofen, Burchardeswiesen, Lyndach) were established, continuing even after the town foundation, but finally given up.\n\nPresumably around 1000, the Weinsberg castle was established on a mountain at the trade route running from Heilbronn to Schwäbisch Hall. \n\nIn 1140 the castle was besieged by Konrad III in the course of the struggles between the Staufers and the Welfs. Finally it had to surrender on December 21, 1140, since the army of Welf VI to release the castle had been defeated by the Staufers in a battle. According to the report of the \"Chronica regia Coloniensis\", the women of the castle were granted free departure and allowed to take what they could carry on their backs. They carried down their men, and so saved their lives, since the king adhered to his word. The women became known as \"treue Weiber\" (\"loyal women\"). The castle (today's ruin) is called \"Weibertreu\" due to this occurrence.\n\nThe Staufers used a family of ministerialis from Gmünd as managers of the castle, which soon called itself after its seat \"von Weinsberg\" (Masters of Weinsberg) and who possessed the castle as a fiefdom until 1450. A settlement developed at the tendencies of the Burgberg. A settlement at the trade route in the valley served the supply of the castle and the surrounding localities. Around 1200 the building of the Johanneskirche began at instigation of the Masters of Weinsberg between these two settlements.\n\nPresumably Weinsberg was created at the same time and surrounded with a city wall. In 1241 the town was first mentioned in one Staufish income list, where Weinsberg ranked at 29 equal with Donauwörth, Wiesbaden, Offenburg and Konstanz. The date of when Weinsberg attained its town privileges is unknown. However, it must have been before 1283, since Rudolf I had lent its town privileges to Löwenstein in this year – after the model of the city right, which its predecessors of the town Weinsberg had lent. At the beginning one half of Weinsberg was a free imperial city, the other half belonged to the Masters of Weinsberg. The town persisted on its status as a free imperial city and affirmed it by entrying to different city federations, what led to numerous quarrels between the town and the masters.\nThe city wall around the town established in early 13th century originally also included the castle in the northwest by linking walls. In the area between these linking walls, directly underneath the castle, there were houses for priests, ministerialis and serfs of the masters. Presumably in 1332 Weinsberg's citizens destroyed this quarter and locked the city in the west in opposite to the castle, as documents state from 1375. While two of the three castle masters were absent and against the resistance of the third one they established a wall between castle and town with a moat. Probably the linking walls were broken off at the same time.\n\nThe quarrels with the masters persisted. Finally, on May 22, 1417, Sigismund gave Weinsberg to his treasurer Konrad IX. So the town had been devalued by losing its status as a free imperial city to the subordinated status of the Masters of Weinsberg's rule. The town looked for protection in a further city federation called the Weinsberg Federation. On November 27, 1420, 33 free imperial cities united for the protection of Weinsberg.\n\nThe town refused to acknowledge Konrad's rule and did not want to pay its taxes any longer. That is why Konrad IX achieved the \"Reichsacht\" at the royal court imposing on all citizens of age on 10 February 1422. Since it had caused nothing the \"Aberacht\" followed in 1425. In addition the Pope – presumably Martin V – imposed the anathema on them in 1424. However, all this had not caused anything, and Konrad took drastic steps. Weakening the Swabian towns allied with Weinsberg, he acquired the town Sinsheim, where one of the arteries led to the Frankfurt Trade Fair. In August 1428 he attacked businessmen in Sinsheim travelling to the fair and detained 149 people from 20 cities, so the Frankfurt fair had to fail. The king took it as a personal offense and withdrew his favour from Konrad. In October 1428 the cities agreed with Konrad in Heidelberg, however the king forbade this agreement. Two years later, the parties reached an agreement on the basis of the obtained agreement two years before. According to the corresponding treaty Konrad had to recognize Weinsberg as a (undivided) free imperial city.\n\nThe German religious reformer Johannes Oecolampadius was born here in 1482 and was a preacher at the local church from 1510 to 1518, the year in which he went to Basel, where he introduced the reformation.\n\nOn April 16, 1525 (Easter Sunday), during the German Peasants' War, the peasants attacked and destroyed the castle, which was already damaged from an earlier attack in 1504. They then proceeded to execute the nobleman who had been in command of both town and castle and who had treated the peasants very badly several times before. The execution was an unprecedented move and shocked and outraged the German nobility and clergy. They had the town destroyed several weeks later, on May 21, even though the townspeople had had nothing to do with the execution.\n\nFrom 1819 until his death in 1862, the poet and physician Justinus Kerner lived in Weinsberg. His circle of friends, all of them poets, often met at his house, giving Weinsberg the reputation of being a \"Swabian Weimar\".\n\nDuring the Second World War, Weinsberg was the site of a prison camp (Oflag Va) for Allied officers (French and British Commonwealth). On April 12, 1945, the town was destroyed by aerial bombings, gunfire and the fires which resulted from this.\n\nWeinsberg has official partnerships with the French town of Carignan (département Ardennes) and the Italian town of Costigliole d'Asti (Province of Asti). There are informal relations with Cossebaude (now a part of Dresden) in Germany, Keyworth (Nottinghamshire) in the UK and Lake Crystal, Minnesota in the US. The latter two came about because of student exchange programs between schools in Weinsberg and schools there.\n\nThe American town of Winesburg, Ohio was originally named after Weinsberg in the early 19th century and had the spelling changed only in 1833.\n\nBefore 1930 the title was Schultheiß/Stadtschultheiß\n\nIn earlier times viticulture has been the basis of Weinsberg's economy and plays still an important role. In 1271 viticulture in Weinsberg was mentioned for the first time, there are proven 28 wine presses in the town from 1636. With a cultivated area of 430 ha (conditions: 2005, with districts), two thirds of it are red wine sorts, standing the town in fifth place of the viticulture municipalities in Württemberg. In 1868 the winemaking cooperative Weinsberg was created, getting combined with Erlenbach's and Heilbronn's cooperatives to the \"Genossenschaftskellerei Heilbronn-Erlenbach-Weinsberg e. G.\", still attaching the most wine-growers of Weinsberg. In addition there are some estates removing and marketing their wine by themselves. Besides there's the Staatliche Lehr- und Versuchsanstalt für Wein- und Obstbau Weinsberg (\"LVWO\" or briefly viticulture school) created in 1868, educating people and marketing their wine as \"Staatsweingut Weinsberg\". Since January 19, 1957, there is also the technical school of cooper business providing courses each year to a mastership examination in this profession. Finally since 1972 also the viticulture association of Württemberg has resided in Weinsberg.\n\nIn 1966, a motorway interchange was built in the area of Weinsberg and named after the town. The A 6 (Mannheim–Nuremberg) and A 81 (Würzburg–Stuttgart) cross there. The A 81 to Würzburg is less busy than the other three directions. Due to the opening of the Eastern Bloc, the A 6 leading in east–west direction is often a gridlock. In 2001, the daily traffic volume reached 102,000 vehicles. 30% of it are HGV, so it is one of the highest portions in the German motorway net. For a long time, the extension to six lanes of the four-lane A 6 is an urgent desire of the whole Heilbronn region. It has paid the costs of the expansion plan from Weinsberg interchange up to the Bavarian border. The extension is assured but not scheduled yet, so as a remedy the shoulders of the motorway became provisional driving strips.\n\nFormerly the Bundesstraße 39 (Heilbronn–Schwäbisch Hall) leading in west–east direction had been running right through the town, dividing Weinsberg into a northern and southern part. Crossing the B 39 apart from traffic lights was nearly impossible, so the desire of a bypass grew, which was finally inaugurated on July 13, 1990. Running from Heilbronn it passes the Schemelsberg in a tunnel, then it leads around Weinsberg parallel to the A 6 and finally meets the old B 39 in the east. The old route of the B 39 through the town received less traffic. At the border to Ellhofen the motorway feeder B 39a branches to the south, which leads to the A 81's motorway junction \"Weinsberg/Ellhofen\".\nPublic transport is provided by tram-trains operated by the Heilbronn and Karlsruhe Stadtbahns and buses co-ordinated with it by the HNV. Weinsberg is situated on the \"Hohenlohebahn\" rail track built from 1860 to 1862 running from Heilbronn via Öhringen to Schwäbisch Hall. Apart from Regional-Express trains of the Deutsche Bahn, the Albtal-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft runs its tram-trains there to Öhringen since December 2005. Nothing had been invested to this previous non-electrified distance for a long time, still being on technical conditions of 1900. For this purpose the track became modernized until Öhringen from 2003 to 2005 providing an overhead line for the first time. In addition new train stops were opened. In Weinsberg they're called \"Weinsberg-West\" (planned start February 2009) and \"Weinsberg/Ellhofen Industriegebiet\" (since December 2006), so that Weinsberg will have three stops at its disposal.\nWeinsberg has a big psychiatric and neurological hospital, founded in 1903. Named \"Klinikum am Weissenhof\" (since 2002), it is the town's biggest employer. There also is a state institution for teaching and research in winemaking, called the \"Staatliche Lehr- und Versuchsanstalt für Wein- und Obstbau\". Several new grape varieties were bred there since it was founded in 1868.\n\n\n"}

The earliest use of the word \"playpen\" cited in the Oxford English Dictionary is 1902.\n\nPlaypens were traditionally made of wood, and consisted of a flat rectangular platform, usually square in shape, with vertical bars on four sides, so that the child can see out. The floor of the playpen is usually a soft mat. The walls of the playpen are usually higher than the height of the child, so as to avoid climbing injuries; playpens may also have a detachable lid. There are many more modern and portable designs.\n\nModern playpens are portable and typically consist of a basic metal and plastic support system and mesh, soft plastic or nylon sides. An optional removable bassinet can be attached at the top for the child to sleep in or be changed in until four months of age. Some models have attachments such as mobiles, side pockets for supplies and toys, change table attachment, night lights, music boxes, and clip-on adapter for CD player for the child to listen to music while sleeping or playing. Portable playpens come in different sizes, but most are expected to be collapsed into a small roll for easy storage and transport. Difference between playpen and playard is small.\n\nIt is important to ensure the playpen being used is safe for the child. This is especially relevant when the playpen has been bought second-hand which may have been subject to a product recall. Unsafe playpens may collapse which could result in (possibly fatal) injury to the child.\n\n"}

A late bloomer, Kato won 46 titles, including the Oza eight times in a row. He also became the second player to reach 1,200 career wins, behind Rin Kaiho.\n\nKato is the author of \"The Chinese Opening: The Sure-Win Strategy\" (published in English by Kiseido Publishing Company) and \"Kato's Attack and Kill\" (published by Ishi Press).\n\nKato joined Kitani Minoru's go dojo in 1959, quickly becoming friends with Ishida Yoshio. The two became sparring partners and kept a close relationship up until Kato's death. In 1964, Kato passed the pro exam at age seventeen. Along with Takemiya Masaki and Ishida, the trio became known as the three crows of the Kitani dojo. Kato began qualifying for tournaments early on in his professional career. He made the Honinbo league in 1968 as a 4 dan, a feat unheard of at the time. Kato was unable to progress past the group stages and was relegated. However, he challenged title holder Rin Kaiho the following year, losing four games to two.\n\nHe was known as the \"Killer\" for his attacking style.

The congregation dates back to 1857, and at one time, was the largest congregation by membership within the Presbyterian Church in Canada (PCC).\n\nThe first congregation of St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church began in 1857. Twenty-nine Presbyterians petitioned the London UPC Presbytery for their own congregation from the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland congregation in Detroit. Permission was granted on July 1, and St. Andrew's elected its first Session on July 12, and met in early August with a charter membership of 32. Alexander Bartlet served as Session Clerk from then until his death in 1910, and Sunday school Superintendent until 1893. St Andrew's was at that time part of the UPC's Presbytery of London, in Canada West.\nIn the early years, there was no church building. Services were held in a room above the store of John McCrae, the same room that was used as the council chambers by the municipal government until Windsor constructed its first town hall. There were also meetings at the Old Ward School. With such a small congregation it was difficult to secure a permanent minister. The usual practice was to bring in someone from Detroit or a missionary to conduct services. Ministers from around the UPC's London Presbytery were appointed to moderate Session Meetings.\nThe UPC and the Free Church, Canada Synod merged in July 1861 to become the Canada Presbyterian Church. Rev. William Bennet, a native of Ireland who was ministering in New Brunswick was called to the post, and was the first minister inducted in Windsor, serving from October 22 1861 to November 1863. The first building for St. Andrew's was erected in 1865 on the southeast corner of Victoria Avenue and Chatham Street. In May 1866, the Rev. Alexander Ferrier Kemp was called from St Gabriel's Church in Montreal as its second minister. He left in 1870 when appointed to a professorship at Olivet College in Olivet, Michigan. Dr. Kemp later returned to Canada as principal of the Ottawa Ladies' College, and was co author of the 1883 \"Handbook of the Presbyterian Church in Canada\".\n\nKemp was followed by the Rev. John Gray, an 1870 graduate of Toronto's Knox College (all subsequent senior ministers are Knox Alumni), during whose pastorate (1870-1893) the congregation built a new brick church at Victoria and Park Street, in 1883. On March 16, 1895, the building burned to the ground. Gray, like his predecessor, left for the United States (Kalamazoo, Michigan), and later retired in Toronto.\n\nThe fire precipitated the building of the current structure in 1895, with the first service held on June 14, 1896. The church was originally designed to seat 800. The balconies were added in 1903, allowing the seating of another 400 people. In 1915, Rev. James C. Tolmie (1893-1915) resigned from St Andrew's, having combined the pulpit when elected Member of Provincial Parliament for Windsor in 1914. He went overseas with the Essex Fusiliers, and was the finalist in the provincial Liberal Party Leadership Convention in both 1919 and 1922. He was designated \"Minister Emeritus\" at St. Andrew's.\n\nRev. Dr. Hugh M. Paulin arrived in late 1915 and served the congregation over thirty-five years until his death in October 1952. The congregation voted in 1925 to remain within the continuing Presbyterian Church in Canada by a vote of 18 for joining into the United Church of Canada, and 607 against the proposed merger. The membership at St Andrew's exceeded 2,000 members the year Dr. Paulin died, and retained the largest membership in the PCC in the years following 1925, until surpassed by St Andrew's Church in Kitchener.\n\nThe Rev. Dr. William Lawson succeeded Paulin, serving from 1953 until his retirement in 1981, followed by Dr. Robert Fourney (1982-1996). The Rev. Dr. Jeff Loach, now minister of St Paul's in Nobleton, Ontario, ministered from 1997 until 2004.\n\nAn addition to the building was completed in 1983, consisting primarily of the Meeting Place and the Herman-Clark Hall, along with significant renovations to the offices and Sunday School rooms in the southern part of the building.\n\nIn June 1980, the congregation hosted the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Canada; the opening service was held in St Andrew's, with the remainder of the event held at the University of Windsor. The Assembly coincided with the United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America's General Assembly held in Detroit, and there was a joint session held at Cobo Hall. In June 1997, the PCC General Assembly returned to Windsor.\n\nThe congregation celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2007. The celebrations started with the induction of only their ninth Senior Minister, Rev. Ronald Sharpe, who arrived from a ministry in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia.\n\nThe building also hosts a Chinese-speaking congregation, the Windsor Chinese Presbyterian Church, that holds weekly worship on Sunday afternoons.\n\nOn May 1st, 2016, the congregation voted to end current operations, sell their building and property, and investigate other ministry opportunities in the downtown core due to financial concerns.\n\n"}
{"id": "1940889", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1940889", "title": "North Atlantic Gyre", "text": "North Atlantic Gyre\n\nThe North Atlantic Gyre, located in the Atlantic Ocean, is one of the five major oceanic gyres. It is a circular system of ocean currents that stretches across the North Atlantic from near the equator almost to Iceland, and from the east coast of North America to the west coasts of Europe and Africa.\n\nThe currents that compose the North Atlantic Gyre include the Gulf Stream in the west, the North Atlantic Current in the north, the Canary Current in the east, and the Atlantic North Equatorial Current in the south. This gyre is particularly important for the central role it plays in the thermohaline circulation, bringing salty water west from the Mediterranean Sea and then north to form the North Atlantic Deep Water.\n\nThe North Atlantic Gyre traps anthropogenic marine debris in the North Atlantic Garbage Patch, similar to how the North Pacific Gyre traps debris in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.\n\nThe North Atlantic Gyre forms the Sargasso Sea, noted for its still waters and dense seaweed accumulations.\n\nAs with many oceanographic patterns, the North Atlantic Gyre experiences seasonal changes. Stramma and Siedler (1988) determined that the gyre expands and contracts with a seasonal variance; however, the magnitude of volume transport does not seem to change significantly. During the Northern Hemisphere winter season, the gyre follows a more zonal pattern; that is, it expands in the east-west direction and thins in the north-south direction. As the seasons move from winter to summer, the gyre shifts south by a few degrees latitude. This occurs concurrently with the displacement of the northeastern part of the gyre. It has been concluded that zonal deviations within the gyre remain small while north and south of the gyre they are large.\n\nData collected in the Sargasso Sea region in the western part of the North Atlantic Gyre has led to analytical evidence that the variability of this gyre is linked to wintertime convective mixing. According to Bates (2001), a seasonal variation of 8-10 °C in surface temperature occurs alongside a fluctuation in the mixed layer depth between the Northern Hemisphere winter and summer seasons. The depth rises from 200 meters in winter to about 10 meters in summer. Nutrients remain below the euphotic zone for most of the year, resulting in low primary production. Yet during winter convective mixing, nutrients penetrate the euphotic zone, causing a short-lived phytoplankton bloom in the spring. This then lifts the mixed-layer depth to 10 meters.\n\nThe changes in oceanic biology and vertical mixing between winter and summer in the North Atlantic Gyre seasonally alter the total amount of carbon dioxide in the seawater. Interannual trends have established that carbon dioxide concentrations within this gyre are increasing at a similar rate to that occurring in the atmosphere. This discovery concurs with that made in the North Pacific Gyre. The North Atlantic Gyre also undergoes temperature changes via atmospheric wave patterns. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is one such pattern. During its positive phase, the gyre warms. This is due to a weakening of the westerly winds, resulting in reduced wind stress and heat exchange, providing a greater period of time for the gyre water temperatures to rise.\n\nCollections of aerosols, marine particles, and ocean water in the North Atlantic Gyre from 1990-1992 have led to measurements in lead isotope ratios. These measurements exceed those associated with atmospheric pollution carried from Europe by the trade winds, implying that the majority of lead contamination in the gyre in the early 1990s was primarily caused by American emissions. The surface layers of the Sargasso Sea were used to estimate the lead isotopic concentrations. 42-57% of the lead isotope concentrations result from American industrial and automotive contamination, despite the reduction in the production and use of leaded gasoline in the United States. However, lead concentrations from measurements made after 1992 show a decrease in the amount of lead contamination.\n\n\n"}

The monks are best known for their breeding of German Shepherds, and the training of all dog breeds in basic obedience. The monks have written several dog-training manuals, including \"The Art of Raising a Puppy\" and \"How to Be Your Dog's Best Friend: The Classic Training Manual for Dog Owners\". The nuns are best known for baking gourmet cheesecakes, which they sell on the Internet and in their gift shop. \n\nThese two communities are unique in that they have instituted wide-ranging reforms to the divine office and eucharistic liturgies of the Eastern Orthodox Church, aimed at rendering the services more comprehensible. They are open to ecumenical contacts with other Christian groups. The nave of their Holy Wisdom Temple features iconographic portraits of Orthodox saints as well as prominent non-Orthodox people, such as Pope John XXIII, Archbishop Michael Ramsey, and Mother Teresa of Calcutta, The communities also celebrate the feast of the Roman Catholic saint Francis of Assisi. \n\nThey have been criticized by Orthodox conservatives and traditionalists, but the Monks and Nuns have strongly defend their renewal of liturgy and monastic life. They believe this is a necessity if Orthodox monasticism is to be more than \"museum-keeping\" in the modern world. The monastery has a chapel community as well as a fellowship of lay people, known as Companions, who seek to be formally connected with New Skete in order to deepen their spiritual lives. Through their connection with New Skete, they work to incorporate monastic values that help them live out the call of the Gospel in a lay setting at the same time as they help to support New Skete's mission. This enrichment program serves those who seek to integrate prayer and spirituality in their daily activities, and enhances their commitment to their own Christian life.\n\nIn April 2007, the television show \"Divine Canine\" premiered on the cable television channel Animal Planet. The show featured the dog training program of the Monks of New Skete.\n\nThe Monks of New Skete believe that an authentic and vibrant monasticism is an essential ingredient to healthy Church life. The monastic vocation is contemplative and apostolic, challenging both the Church and the world at large to fuller life. They note that monasticism has always incarnated itself within a particular cultural context. \n\nWorking to live as monks in the modern world, they have developed a daily schedule that integrates liturgical and personal prayer, work, study, and prudent openness to the world. Anchored in a daily cycle of matins and vespers (with Divine Liturgy on Sundays and feast days), they try to be available to all who come to the monastery, in a manner in keeping with their vocation. Many people visit the monastery each year, either to make retreats, attend services, or visit the gift shop and grounds, or as dog customers.\n\nThe Nuns of New Skete, originally a group of Poor Clares, moved from Indiana in 1969 to establish their monastery near the monks' monastery. They support themselves by baking New York-style gourmet cheesecakes for sale in their gift shop and on their website. \n\n\n\n"}

Johansen in command.\n\n\"Halford\" was one of the three \"Fletcher\"-class destroyers to be completed (out of six planned) with a catapult for a float plane, the others being and . The catapult and an aircraft crane were located just aft of the number 2 smokestack, in place of the after torpedo tube mount, 5 inch mount number 3, and the 2nd deck of the after deck house which normally carried a twin 40 mm anti-aircraft gun on most ships of the class. (The twin 40 mm mount was moved to the fantail, just forward of the depth charge racks, where most ships of the class carried 20 mm mounts.) It was intended that the float plane be used for scouting for the destroyer flotilla which the ship was attached to. It would be launched by the catapult, land on the water next to the ship, and be recovered by the aircraft crane. It turned out to be not operationally suitable for the intended purpose, and the three ships were ultimately converted to the standard \"Fletcher\"-class configuration.\n\nIn 1943 when the struggle in Pacific was raging, the Pacific Fleet prepared for its mighty sweep across Micronesia. In an effort to strengthen the \"seeing eyes\" of the fleet, \"Halford\" was constructed with a cruiser catapult and scout observation plane. She departed San Diego 5 July en route Pearl Harbor arriving five days later. For the next 3½ months \"Halford\" was to test the feasibility of carrying scout planes on small vessels. Because of tactical changes and the Navy's growing strength in aircraft carriers, \"Halford\" returned to Mare Island Naval Shipyard 27 October 1943 for alterations which replaced the catapult and scout plane with a second set of torpedo tubes and the number 3 5 inch mount.\n\nBy 6 December, with increased fighting power and a new profile, \"Halford\" again departed for the South Pacific. She called at Pearl Harbor, Funafuti, Espiritu Santo, and Tutuila, Samoa; then took up convoy duties which included a Christmastime assignment of protecting the troopship \"Lurline\" with Marine reinforcements embarked for Guadalcanal. Arriving at Guadalcanal, she assumed command of the anti-submarine screen and took up station off Lunga Point. In addition to Guadalcanal, \"Halford\" supported the beachhead at Bougainville, screening supply trains and participating in coastal bombardments.\n\nAnti-shipping sweeps on New Ireland's east coast, punctuated by counter-battery fire off East Buka Passage made tense and exciting days for \"Halford\", and during January 1944, a month which also saw the destruction by this three-ship task force, of the strategic Japanese facilities on Choiseul Island.\n\n\"Halford\" next became the flagship for Admiral T. S. \"Ping\" Wilkinson's Green Islands Attack Force. Carrying Major General Harold E. Barrowclough's 3rd New Zealand Division Admiral Wilkinson's destroyer-transport group sortied from Vella Lavella and the Treasuries, 12 – 13 February, arrived off Barahun Island at 06:20, 15 February and lowered their landing craft fully manned.\n\n\"Halford\" took up station off Green Island and began patrolling while unloading operations proceeded. At 09:40 General Barrowclough, RNZA, and staff disembarked to land on Green Island. Within two hours after the initial landing, all New Zealand forces were ashore; 5,800 men were landed during D-Day, 15 February. The fact that such a force could put thousands of troops ashore virtually without opposition 115 miles (210 km) from Rabaul demonstrated the might and mobility of the Allied fleets in the Pacific.\n\n\"Halford\" next joined a destroyer squadron to make shipping sweeps off the west coast of New Ireland. On the night of 24 – 25 February 1944, \"Halford\" and sank two small coastal ships and severely damaged a patrol vessel. For the next three days, \"Halford\" carried out her sweeps south of the strong Japanese naval base of Truk then returned to Purvis Bay for supplies.\n\nThe Spring of 1944 found \"Halford\" busily escorting supply units to the northern Solomon Islands. \"Halford\" then prepared for the longest cruise of her career—commencing early in June with the campaign for the Marianas.\n\nThe initial phase of Operation Forager which kept \"Halford\" at sea for seventy five days was the bombardment of Tinian's west coast defenses, followed by night harassing fire and the screening of heavy shore bombardment units. On 17 June \"Halford\" joined the battle line of Admiral Marc A. Mitscher's famed Task Force 58 (TF 58) for the greatest carrier action of all time: the Battle of the Philippine Sea. 19 June found \"Halford\" in the first phase of the battle:—the \"Marianas Turkey Shoot\"—as repeated enemy carrier strikes were shot down by surface fire. In the two day battle of the Philippine Sea, the Japanese Fleet lost 395 of its carrier planes, thirty one float planes, and three aircraft carriers.\n\nWhile Guam footholds were being secured, \"Halford\" covered beach demolition units giving close bombardment support to assault troops and rescuing a number of friendly natives who had escaped through Japanese lines. \"Halford\" then joined the Angaur Fire Support Group in the bombardment of Angaur Island (4 – 21 September 1944).\n\n\"Halford\" turned next to the campaign for the recapture of the Philippines. Joining Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf's Fire Group of the Southern Attack Force, \"Halford\" participated in the pre-invasion bombardments in Leyte Island. Then, on 24 October, when Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid estimated that Admiral Shoji Nishimura's Southern Force would try to enter Leyte Gulf via Surigao Strait, \"Halford\" prepared for the Battle of Surigao Strait (24 – 25 October 1944). That night and in the early morning hours of 25 October \"Halford\", as a member of Destroyer Division 112, witnessed virtually the complete destruction of the Japanese Southern Force except for destroyer . American casualties totaled 39 men killed and 114 wounded, most of them in destroyer . Admiral Oldendorf said after the battle, \"My theory was that of the old-time gambler: 'Never give a sucker a chance.' If my opponent is foolish enough to come at me with an inferior force, I'm certainly not going to give him an even break.\"\n\nAfter the epochal Battle of Leyte Gulf, which broke the back of Japanese sea power, \"Halford\" departed Leyte Gulf 1 November 1944 and took up operations with the 3rd Fleet out of Ulithi until 2 December when she returned to Leyte as part of the covering force for the landings. On 6 December she was dispatched to escort damaged SS \"Antone Sautrain\" into Leyte, but the ship was lost in air attack. Returning to Leyte \"Halford\" next escorted supply echelons to Ormoc Bay and troopships to Mindoro.\n\nIn the afternoon of 2 January 1945 \"Halford\" sortied from Hollandia to escort transports of Task Force 79 to Lingayen Gulf for the occupation of Luzon Island; delivering the transports safely despite heavy air attack she commenced patrolling the entrance to the Gulf. Then on the afternoon of 11 January, \"Halford\" took part in the shipping strike on San Fernando Harbor in which three small cargo ships, a landing craft, and several barges were sunk. Next morning she took part in the bombardment which neutralized the town of Rosario.\n\nOn 14 February, while patrolling Saipan Harbor, in a smoke screen, \"Halford\" rammed M.S. \"Terry E. Stephenson\". Although there were no injuries, it necessitated \"Halford\"'s return to Mare Island, where she arrived on 24 March 1945.\n\nOn 27 May 1945 \"Halford\" departed San Diego on her way west again. She proceeded to the Marshall Islands via Pearl Harbor where she escorted transports from Eniwetok to Ulithi. On 11 August \"Halford\" departed Eniwetok en route to Adak, Alaska as a unit of the Northern Pacific Fleet. With a task force composed of light carriers, cruisers, and destroyers, \"Halford\" departed Adak on 31 August and steamed into Ominato, Northern Honshū, Japan 12 September. Under the direction of Vice-Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher, this force was responsible for the initial occupation of the Ominato Naval Base and surrounding areas.\n\nWith Admiral Fletcher's Task Group, \"Halford\" cleared Ominato on 20 September returning to Adak five days later, thence on via Kodiak to Juneau for Navy Day.\n\n\"Halford\" departed Juneau, Alaska, on 1 November 1945, and arrived at Bremerton, Washington, three days later to begin inactivation overhaul. She departed Bremerton on 23 January 1946. She joined the Pacific Reserve Fleet at San Diego on 28 January and decommissioned there on 15 May 1946.\n\n\"Halford\" was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 May 1968; she was sold on 2 April 1970 and broken up for scrap.\n\n\"Halford\" received thirteen battle stars for World War II service.\n\n"}

Crossing from Plymouth to Roscoff on 17 July with 1,034 passengers aboard, the ship put out an emergency call which resulted in British and French air sea rescue helicopters scrambling to the ship's aid. The fire was extinguished by the ship's own crew before land-based assistance could come aboard, but passengers were mustered and lifeboats swung out as a precaution. Quiberon remained out of service for much of the rest of the summer season, not reappearing from repairs until the end of August. As a result of this fire, the ship received some rather unflattering newspaper headlines,\n\nFacilities available on board the \"Quiberon\" included 2 cinemas, 2 restaurants, a Salon de The, 4 shops and more than 280 cabins. She received a full renovation prior to entering service in 1982 and another one in 1990.\n\n"}

The purpose of the bulb keel is to place the ballast as low as possible, therefore gaining the maximum possible amount of leverage and thus the most righting moment. An example of a class of boats that use a bulb keel is the International 110 racing class, which uses a 300 lb (136 kg) cast iron bulb keel on a boat whose minimum racing weight is 910 lb (414 kg).\n\nSince bulb keels work best on long, thin keels or daggerboards, they are generally not used on sailboats intended for shallow waters, but are most often found on offshore racing craft. Daggerboards built like bulb keels are often referred to as \"lifting keels\", and they can be retracted into the boat to reduce the draft, and to allow the boat to be loaded onto a trailer. Lifting keels are also more likely to be found on craft built for speed, as a winch or a set of pulleys is required to provide purchase to lift the heavy keel.\n\nSome boats with lifting keels go so far as to allow the keel to be canted side to side, allowing the bulb to be placed to windward to reduce heel in high winds; this type of keel is called a canting keel, and is used in the newest Volvo Ocean Race's Volvo Open 70 class yachts. It is also possible to shape the bulb into a horizontal foil, called a winged keel.\n\nWhen the bulb protrudes past the leading edge of the keel, it is called a \"T-bulb\". It offers better performance (like required for racing), but is prone to hook into flotsam (like kelp or discarded fishing nets).\n\n"}

Specifically this clash took place on the Kimmerghame Estate in a field now named \"Slaughter Field\". The estate is in the possession of the Swinton Family.\n\nIn 1402, Scottish nobles launched a coordinated invasion of Northern England. In the initial foray, some 12,000 Scottish troops crossed into Cumberland and looted areas near Carlisle. On 22 June at Nisbet, Berwickshire, the forfeited George de Dunbar, 10th Earl of March successfully led 200 English soldiers, mainly drawn from the garrison at Berwick-upon-Tweed, against 400 Scots returning from a raid on Northumberland. Henry IV of England was given news of the skirmish while at Harborough on 30 June, and delayed plans to suppress a Welsh rebellion so that he could deal with the large-scale Scottish invasion that was then imminently expected. In the autumn a large army of Scots led by Archibald Douglas, 4th Earl of Douglas harassed the English countryside as far south as the River Wear, and were engaged and defeated in the battle of Humbleton Hill.\n\nThe Scottish casualties at Nesbit Moor included the death of Sir Patrick Hepburn younger of Hailes; and the capture of Sir John Haliburton of Dirleton, Robert de Lawedre of Edrington, Sir John Cockburn, and Sir Thomas Haliburton. The date of Sir Robert Lawder's liberation does not appear to be on record but as there is a charter in \"The Great Seal of Scotland\" (number 934) confirmed at Falkland Palace in May 1411, which mentions him being \"present\", we might safely assume that he was freed before that date.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 25, 1991. In the episode, Lisa's teacher Miss Hoover takes medical leave due to what she thinks is Lyme disease, so substitute teacher Mr. Bergstrom takes over the class. Lisa finds Mr. Bergstrom's teaching methods inspiring and discovers an entirely new love for learning. When Miss Hoover returns to class, Lisa is devastated to lose her most positive adult role model. Eventually, she realizes that while Mr. Bergstrom was one of a kind, she can find role models in other people, including her father Homer. Meanwhile, Bart runs for class president against Martin.\n\nThe episode was written by Jon Vitti and directed by Rich Moore. It is the first episode of the show to have the opening sequence start at the driveway scene. Dustin Hoffman—using the pseudonym Sam Etic—guest-starred in it as Mr. Bergstrom, who was modeled on the physical appearance of Mike Reiss, a longtime writer and producer on the show. The episode features cultural references to Mike Nichols's film \"The Graduate\", which starred Hoffman, and the novel \"Charlotte's Web\" by E. B. White. \n\nSince airing, the episode has received positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a Nielsen Rating of 11.1, and was the highest-rated show on Fox the week it aired.\n\nLisa's teacher, Miss Hoover, thinks she has Lyme disease and is replaced by substitute teacher Mr. Bergstrom. \n\nMr Bergstrom is dressed as a cowboy, setting the scene as Texas, 1830. He adds there are three things wrong with his costume and whoever guesses them will win his hat. Lisa states that his belt said \"State of Texas\" but Texas was not a state until 1845, the revolver was not invented until 1835 and that Mr Bergstrom appears to be of Jewish descent and there were no Jewish cowboys. Mr. Bergstrom is impressed by Lisa's knowledge and rewards her with his cowboy hat, also adding that he was wearing a digital watch. Due to his unorthodox teaching methods and friendly nature, Lisa starts falling in love with him. Lisa runs into Mr. Bergstrom at a museum and is embarrassed when Homer displays his ignorance. Sensing a void in their relationship, Mr. Bergstrom takes Homer aside to suggest he be a more positive role model.\n\nAt Marge's suggestion, Lisa goes to invite Mr. Bergstrom to dinner at their home, but is devastated to find Miss Hoover back and Mr. Bergstrom gone. She rushes to his apartment and learns that he has accepted a new job in Capital City. She rushes to the train station and confesses that she will be lost without him. Mr. Bergstrom replies that the life of a substitute teacher is transient, and he has to help the more needy. He writes her a note and tells her that any time she feels alone, its contents are all she needs to know. He boards the train and departs. Lisa opens the note: it reads \"You are Lisa Simpson.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Bart's class prepares to elect a class president. Mrs. Krabappel nominates Martin, while Sherri and Terri nominate Bart. During a debate with Martin, Bart tells jokes and wins the class over. Certain of Bart's victory, none of the children in his class—including Bart—votes, giving Martin the victory with just two votes.\n\nDevastated by Mr. Bergstrom's departure, Lisa takes her grief out on the insensitive Homer, calling him a baboon. Marge tells Homer to console Lisa, explaining how their daughter is hurt and needs her father. Homer confesses to Lisa that he cannot imagine her experience, as he has never lost anyone special, and cheers her up by mimicking a monkey. Lisa apologizes for calling him a baboon. Finding Bart seething over the election result, Homer comforts him by pointing out that being class president would have involved extra work with little reward. Finally, passing Maggie's room, he places her pacifier in her mouth. Homer goes to bed with Marge happily that night, saying he is \"on the biggest roll\" of his life.\n\n\"Lisa's Substitute\" was written by Jon Vitti and directed by Rich Moore. According to Vitti, \"The Simpsons\" producer James L. Brooks contributed more to this episode than he did to any other in the show's history. Vitti said the episode was \"very controversial\" when it was being made because it \"came at a point when the staff were just beginning to realize the comedy potential of the show, but we were trapped with these love stories, and just as the staff were starting to get frustrated with the love stories, along came 'Lisa's Substitute': the biggest, huggiest, warmest and fuzziest of them all.\"\n\nMr. Bergstrom was modeled on the physical appearance of Mike Reiss, a longtime writer and producer on the show. American actor Dustin Hoffman provided the voice of Mr. Bergstrom. Hoffman was not sure if he wanted to be identified with a cartoon show at the time, like many early guest stars on \"The Simpsons\", and therefore used the pseudonym Sam Etic in the closing credits. Sam Etic is a play on the word semitic, alluding to the fact that both Hoffman and Mr. Bergstrom are Jewish. Brooks was the one who suggested the pseudonym, which Hoffman immediately liked. The cast of the show flew to New York to record the episode with Hoffman and were directed by James L. Brooks. Yeardley Smith, who provides the voice of Lisa, said she grew as an actress after working with Hoffman that day. \"The Simpsons\" writer Al Jean said he remembered that when the audio track of the episode came back, Hoffman's voice was too low on the singing parts. The staff were \"petrified\" that the singing scenes would not show up on air, so they had Hoffman re-record them when he was in Los Angeles. Vitti mentioned on Twitter that the note Lisa receives at the end of the episode should have had an exclamation point at the end. He did not notice it in the animatic and it still \"haunts [him] to this day\".\n\nMrs. Krabappel trying to seduce Mr. Bergstrom is a reference to Hoffman's similar situation in the 1967 film \"The Graduate\". Mr. Bergstrom reads a line from the 1952 novel \"Charlotte's Web\" to his class. It is implied that this line is the end of the book, but in reality another chapter follows. Vitti said the line was the maximum amount of the book they could feature in the episode without being sued. The staff contacted a relative of the author E. B. White, but she would not clear the use of the book. When Lisa arrives at Mr. Bergstrom's apartment building, a list of tenants can be seen. One of the names is J. Vitti, for the episode's writer Jon Vitti, and another is J. Kamerman, for then-animator Jen Kamerman. When Bart unexpectedly loses to Martin in the class president race, a picture of Martin holding up a copy of \"The Daily Fourth Gradian\" with the headline \"Simpson Defeats Prince\" is taken, which in turn ends up on the front page of \"The Daily Fourth Gradian\" under the headline \"Prince Beats Simpson\". This is a reference to the famous picture of former President Harry S. Truman holding up a copy of a prematurely printed edition of the \"Chicago Tribune\" that proclaimed \"Dewey Defeats Truman\", taken the day after his unexpected victory over Thomas E. Dewey in 1948.\n\nIn its original broadcast, \"Lisa's Substitute\" finished forty-third in the ratings for the week of April 22–28, 1991, with a Nielsen Rating of 11.1, equivalent to approximately ten million viewing households. It was the highest-rated show on Fox that week. \n\nSince airing, the episode has received positive reviews from television critics with Hoffman's performance being critically lauded. \n\nThe authors of the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\", Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said \"Despite a scene-stealing performance from Ms Krabappel, this is Lisa's show. Mr Bergstrom's last message for Lisa is a delightful touch and adds the finishing touch to a wonderful episode.\" \n\nFormer TV Squad blogger Adam Finley named \"Lisa's Substitute\" as one of his top fourteen most touching \"The Simpsons\" episodes, and The Simpsons Archive webmaster Jouni Paakkinen rated the episode as his third favorite. \n\nColin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide said that Lisa episodes \"tend to be goopy\", but \"Lisa's Substitute\" seemed like \"a good show, however\". He went on to say, \"The show offered many other good moments, and it helped expand the Lisa/Homer relationship neatly. The Bart's election subplot punctured any sappiness that otherwise might have occurred. [...] 'Lisa's Substitute' offered a fairly solid program.\" \n\nEmily VanDerWerff of \"Slant Magazine\" picked the episode as the show's second best, praising its emotion and Hoffman's performance.\n\nHoffman has been praised for his guest appearance as Mr. Bergstrom. \"Entertainment Weekly\" named it one of the sixteen greatest guest appearances on \"The Simpsons\". In 2007, Simon Crerar of \"The Times\" listed his performance as one of the thirty-three funniest cameos in the history of the show. The episode's reference to \"The Graduate\" was named the 20th greatest film reference in the history of the show by \"Total Film\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Nathan Ditum. Ditum also ranked Hoffman's performance as the 16th best guest appearance in the show's history. \n\n\"Lisa's Substitute\" also received positive reviews from cast and crew members of the show. \n\nBart's voice actress, Nancy Cartwright, said it is one of her top three episodes together with \"Bart Sells His Soul\" and \"Bart the Mother\", while writer Al Jean said the episode was his favorite sentimental episode. Yeardley Smith, the voice actress of Lisa, has mentioned this episode is one of her favorite \"Simpsons\" episodes of all time. Dan Castellaneta, the voice of Homer, named it his favorite episode of the show together with \"Simpson and Delilah\" and \"Homer the Heretic\". Executive producer James L. Brooks said he thinks \"Lisa's Substitute\" stands out because it is \"The Simpsons\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> \"best show\" with a message behind it. When \"The Simpsons\" began streaming on Disney+ in 2019, former \"Simpsons\" writer and executive producer Bill Oakley named this one of the best classic Simpsons episodes to watch on the service.\n\n"}

In 1888 the building was renamed Knox after John Knox.\n\nKnox Presbyterian Church Oakville began with a simple service in 1833 attended by 11 worshippers in a wooden frame building on the east bank of the 16 Mile Creek. The settlement, on land surrendered by the Mississauga Indians, was in the midst of the last great virgin forest remaining between York and Hamilton Bay. Early services in the pioneer shipbuilding port, with its nearby stands of highly prized white oak trees, were held in such places as a cabinet maker's shop. This led in 1850 to the building of a white frame church on William Street.\n\nThe current red-brick Gothic style building was dedicated May 20, 1888. It replaced the old frame church, called Oakville Presbyterian Church. The new church had taken a year to build and cost $16,000, a huge amount in those days. To build it, 60 members of the congregation signed a promissory note and the church purchased the White Oak Hotel at the corner of Dunn Street and Colborne Street, later to become Lakeshore Road. The hotel had once been a wild drinking place called O'Reilly's Tavern. A later owner took to keeping a live bear chained up to amuse customers. But Oakville residents voted the town dry in 1881 and by 1887 the owner was willing to sell it to the Presbyterians for $1,600. The old hotel was cut into three sections and moved off the site - one section is still downtown today at 152 Lakeshore Road. A church bell was installed several years later - the exact date is in dispute - cast in New York State. By 1894, a \"pedal organ\" had been approved, to the consternation of the more conservative members of the church who regarded it as \"the devil's instrument.\"\n\nBy 1919, the church was ready to expand again, and the sanctuary was renovated to assume the form that exists today. The old organ was replaced with a new $6,625 three-manual Casavant Organ, the chancel was extended through the arch and the stained glass window of the Last Supper was installed in memory of the men in the congregation who died in the Great War, including the son of the minister. The window was donated by Cecil Marlatt, owner of a great family tannery, who died 8 years later bankrupt. These renovations, which cost $20,300, also saw the addition of what is now R.G. MacMillan Hall. The 1925 Union crisis and the creation of the United Church of Canada, along with the Great Depression, brought about a period of hard times for the church and it wasn't until 1949 that the congregation could hold a mortgage-burning ceremony.\n\nIn 1955 the boom following the arrival of the Ford Motor company was being felt and the church expanded again. Completed in 1956, the new section along Dunn Street now includes the parlour the library, counting room, office, and the nursery. In 1965, a hall was built under the Church at a cost of $80,000, to provide additional space for the church school. It was named for C.K. McNicoll, the minister who guided Knox from its centennial in 1933 to 1961.\n\n\n"}

It first aired on October 29, 2003 on the UPN network in the United States. The episode was written by Chris Black and Brent V. Friedman. It was directed by David Straiton, his sixth episode of the series at that point.\n\nSet in the 22nd century, the series follows the adventures of the first Starfleet starship \"Enterprise\", registration NX-01. In this episode, the crew follow a trail of information to a mining complex which is producing a compound used in the construction of a Xindi weapon, while Chief Engineer Charles \"Trip\" Tucker (Connor Trinneer) makes a discovery about the Xindi sidearms.\n\nThe episode was filmed in late August and early September at the same time as the season premier was first aired. It used a combination of standing sets along with a handful of new sets to represent locations on the Xindi planet. Two actors resumed their roles from earlier in the season; John Cothran, Jr. had previously appeared as a Klingon in both \"\" and \"\". Reviews were mostly positive for \"The Shipment\", and it received a 3.9/6 rating, which was an increase from the re-run shown the previous week but was not as high as the following episode.\n\nAt the Xindi Council, Degra reports that the weapon should be ready in a matter of weeks. On \"Enterprise\", the coordinates provided by Tarquin (in \"\") lead to a planet, and the crew decide to hide the ship while a shuttlecraft manned by Captain Archer, Lieutenant Reed and Major Hayes approaches it. Evading detection, they land and enter a Xindi settlement, where they find a great quantity of kemocite being refined. They then observe Gralik Durr and two associates discussing the deal they have to mine the kemocite for Degra. The away team then beams up a canister of kemocite for analysis, and then follow Gralik back to his home, where they confront him.\n\nT'Pol's analysis shows that the Xindi probe which attacked Earth (in \"The Expanse\") contained kemocite. Archer then tells Gralik that Degra will use the kemocite to build a weapon, but the Arboreal denies any knowledge of the plan. Back on \"Enterprise\", Commander Tucker also learns that the kemocite is the key to Reptilian rifle technology. Archer approves his idea to reverse engineer a rifle, but Tucker unknowingly triggers a self-destruct sequence and the weapon is beamed into space. Archer then decides not to destroy the kemocite mining complex as he doesn't want the Xindi to think of them as aggressors.\n\nOn the planet, Gralik explains that Degra told him that the kemocite was for research, and explains how the Avian race were assumed to be made extinct in the Xindi Civil War. A Reptilian shuttle arrives early, carrying Degra, to collect the final shipment of kemocite. Gralik takes the away team to a cave that will protect them from scans, but they are soon attacked by robotic drones sent by the Reptilians. When Gralik returns home, he is confronted by Degra, who reveals the true purpose of the kemocite, to build a weapon to destroy a ruthless alien species. T'Pol in the meantime has modified the canister of kemocite so that the ship can track it. Archer manages to sneak it aboard the shuttle and after the Reptilians leave, Archer thanks Gralik for his trust and help.\n\nFilming of the episode started on August 29, 2003, overlapping with the final day of the shoot for the episode \"\". As the final scenes to be shot for \"Exile\" only required Linda Park from the main cast, the remaining cast were freed up to shoot scenes for \"The Shipment\". The first scenes to be filmed were those concerning the subplot of the episode where Tucker attempts to take apart the Xindi rifle. Filming resumed on the day after Labor Day with all of the main cast involved. Most of the sets used were the \"Enterprise\" standing sets, but additional sets were required to represent Gralik's home, the Xindi complex and a forest and cave area. During the shoot, live footage was shot of the sets and was presented by Scott Bakula for \"Good Day Live\" in order to promote the series three premier \"The Xindi\", which aired that evening.\n\nIt was the second episode of the season for director David Straiton after the second episode, \"\", and his sixth episode of the series overall. Chris Black and Brent Friedman wrote the episode together. They were both producers on the show; Black a co-executive producer and Friedman a consulting producer. They had each written episodes of the series separately with Friedman credited for \"Rajiin\". Black has several credits to his name on the show, including \"\" and \"\". The episode saw the return of John Cothran Jr., who had previously played two Klingons in previously \"Star Trek\" series. These were Nu'Daq in \"\" episode \"\" and Telok in the \"\" episode \"\". Other cast returning from earlier in the season were Steven Culp as Major Hayes and Randy Oglesby as the Xindi Degra. Executive producer Rick Berman later announced that Gralik would be returning to \"Enterprise\", however \"The Shipment\" was the only on screen appearance of the character.\n\n\"The Shipment\" was first aired in the United States on the UPN network on October 29, 2003. It received a 3.9/6 share among all adults, with 6 percent of all adults watching television at the time of the broadcast. It was in sixth place for the night, one place behind \"Smallville\" on The WB which had a 4.2/7 rating. It was an increase from the 2.6 rating in the previous week for a re-run episode aired up against a Major League Baseball World Series game on the Fox Network. The following week was sweeps week, and saw an increase in viewers for the episode \"\" up to a rating of 4.07, an increase of nearly 400,000 viewers compared to \"The Shipment\".\n\nMichelle Erica Green, reviewing the episode for TrekNation, described the episode as \"very classic Trek\". She was pleased to see that some character depth was being introduced into the new Xindi characters, and compared Gralik to Captain Dathon from the \"\" episode \"Darmok\" but thought that Gralik didn't get developed quite enough to be on the same level. Overall, she described the episode as \"a very solid hour of entertainment, with very few nitpicks... a slick package with the values I consider to be real Trek\". Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website \"Jammer's Reviews\" wasn't enthusiastic about a particularly \"lackluster\" action scene which he felt was a bad cross between \"\" and \"Andromeda\".

The brigade is one of the biggest army units, training approximately 4000 conscripts annually. Brigade is one of the three readiness brigades in the Finnish Army. The brigade trains troops for war-time Kainuu Jäger Brigade.\n\nThe Brigade trains units suited for combat on the heavy snow and poor road-infrastructure areas of Northern Finland, and has several variations from normal Finnish Army training schedules and equipment to meet these demands, such as the light tracked all-terrain vehicles used for fast transportation of troops especially during wintertime. The vehicles are also used by heavy (120 mm) mortar companies, who use mortars fixed on these vehicles. The equipment provides inexpensive, unopposed freedom of movement even in difficult off-road and snow conditions.\n\nFrom 1.1.2015, the organisation of the brigade is the following:\n\n\nAll units of the Brigade train their own specialists and drivers, and all receive a basic infantry jaeger training. All units are equipped with at least light AT fire-and-forget weapons and 12.7 mm anti-air machine guns, that can also be mounted on APCs and is very effective against infantry and lightly armoured vehicles.\n\nNote also that this is the training organisation, not the actual war-time organisation. In this training or peace-time organisation, the Brigade can hoist everything needed on a modern battlefield except for anti-air weapons other than the 12.7 mm machine guns. These units are trained in the Jäger Brigade.\n\nThe Kuopio battalion is responsible for training of drivers for various vehicles (for Supply mostly - other battalions train the drivers they need themselves), and supply and munitions personnel. The battalion is also responsible for the training of NCOs for recon and transportation. \nThe Jaeger battalion trains the main body of the brigade - the infantry. It also trains NCOs for infantry. The battalion is equipped with the tracked, non-armoured vehicles (telakuorma-auto) which make it very fast even off-road and in high snow. The battalion is equipped with state-of-the-art anti-armor weapons as well as other, lighter and cheaper AT-weapons. It also has modernized Russian 12.7 mm anti-air machine guns (as do other battalions) and the light 81 mm mortars. As all Finnish jaegers, these troops are taught to be deadly, fast, maneuverable, and silent if need to be. The Battalion also has some Sisu XA-185 \"Pasi\" APCs.\n\nThis battalion trains engineers and their NCOs. The Battalion includes the 1st Engineer Company, training of which is concentrated on usage and de-armament of mines and other explosives. The other Company of the Battalion, the Technical Company, focuses on \"heavy engineering\" such as trench- and bridge building.\n\nThe Artillery regiment uses 81 mm light mortars attached to infantry units, 120 mm heavy mortars fixed on TeKa:s, 122 mm Soviet howitzers and modern 155 K 98 155 mm guns equipped with APU to provide (minor) movement without towing vehicles. It also trains all artillery NCO's, including forward observers and mortar leaders.\n\nThis battalion houses units that are responsible for the usage and building of brigade-scale signal systems. It also trains NCOs for this task. The battalion also has the HQ company (Esikuntakomppania, EK) that trains the military police for the brigade, which also uses the dogs trained by the Kainuu jaegar battalion. MP NCOs are not trained at the brigade, but in Rovaniemi. The recon and \"sissi\" NCOs specialiced in communications are also trained in Northern Finland signal battalion.\n\nThe brigade has its roots in the Savolax Infantry Regiment of the Thirty Years' War, and the battle of the River Lech on April 5, 1632, which is the traditional day of the brigade. It also holds up the traditions of the men that fought at Suomussalmi, Raate Road and Kuhmo during the Winter War as well as the Rukajärvi-directions 14. Division during the Continuation War.\n\nThe honorary march of the brigade is \"Hurtti-Ukko\" by Carl Collan.\n\nThe brigade's flag is the Kajaani Sissi Battalion's flag from 1920.\n\n"}

The 2 divisions of Warrington are Borough constituencies,\nwith the remaining 9 being County constituencies.\n\nFollowing the Fifth Periodic Review of Westminster Constituencies by the Boundary Commission for England, the existing 11 constituencies were retained with changes to realign constituency boundaries with the boundaries of current local government wards, and to reduce the electoral disparity between constituencies. These changes were implemented at the 2010 United Kingdom general election.\n\nThe Boundary Commission for England submitted their final proposals in respect of the Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster Constituencies (the 2018 review) in September 2018.

They propose to bring forward primary legislation to remove the statutory obligation to implement the 2018 Boundary Review recommendations, as well as set the framework for future boundary reviews in time for the next review which is due to begin in early 2021 and report no later than October 2023.

{"id": "1941001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1941001", "title": "Dungeon Siege II", "text": "Dungeon Siege II\n\nDungeon Siege II is an action role-playing video game, the sequel to 2002's \"Dungeon Siege\". It was developed by Gas Powered Games and released on August 16, 2005. The story is a continuation of the \"Dungeon Siege\" storyline. An expansion \"\" was released in 2006.\n\nThe game play centers around a class system of Melee, Ranger, Nature magic and Combat magic with the introduction of two additional classes in the expansion pack \"Broken World\". The player controlled protagonist finds themselves changing alliances once their friend, Drevin, is killed in the main story line and works to defeat the villain Valdis. Players can recruit NPC players with unique personalities and attributes which offers depth to game play.\n\nThe game was favorably received upon release, scoring an 80 on Metacritic and winning PC Gamer US's \"Best Roleplaying Game 2005\" award.\n\nUnlike \"Dungeon Siege\", \"Dungeon Siege II\" takes a more varied approach to its gameplay. The original game was criticized for being too automated and lacking replay value. Developer Gas Powered Games improved the old system into a more versatile one that incorporates additional elements of strategy.\n\nBy default, the new system turns off much of the original game's combat automation and requires players to click once for each individual attack of their selected character. For players who liked the combat system of the previous version, the new system can be made to behave more like it. Clicking on a monster and holding the right mouse button makes the character continuously attack until the monster dies. There are options that allow the player's characters to automatically defend themselves and/or automatically continue to attack their targets, much like in the old system.\n\nIn the original \"Dungeon Siege\", the four character specialities (also known as classes) differed only in the items and spells they were allowed to use. In \"Dungeon Siege II\", each speciality (Melee, Ranged, Nature Magic, Combat Magic) has a unique set of skills, that determines a character's particular strengths. For example, melee-oriented characters can get better at using a shield to defend their allies or they can improve their two-handed weapon skills to more effectively attack opponents. As in the original game, multi-classing (distributing experience and skills to more than one class) is possible, but it is best to do so with caution. A character learning skills in too many different areas may find themselves spread too thin and unable to perform any role effectively.\n\nIn the expansion pack for \"Dungeon Siege II\", \"Broken World\", two new character classes have been introduced. These classes are multi-class characters: the Fist of Stone being a multi-class of Melee and Nature Magic, and the Blood Assassin being a multi-class of Ranged and Combat Magic. These new classes have been given their own specialised skill trees in addition to the others, allowing them to multiclass more easily without being at as much of a disadvantage. For example, the Fist of Stone is able to cause small earthquakes when attacking to keep up with the damage output of a pure melee character, and the Blood Assassin is able to cause targets to hemorrhage blood to keep up with the damage output of a pure ranged character (as they multi-class, they cannot upgrade their weaponry as often and would otherwise be weaker in combat).\n\nAnother change in \"Dungeon Siege II\" is the addition of the Hero Powers system. Powers are special abilities that characters can use when normal attacks do not suffice; they include abilities like invincibility for the entire party and the power to summon a lightning strike that damages all enemies in the area. They are acquired when certain skills are trained to a certain level. Each power has 3 levels, each requiring more skill points to get. Powers increase in potency as characters level.\n\nLike its predecessor, \"Dungeon Siege II\" is a party-based role-playing game. Players can have up to four characters in a party under the first difficulty setting (Mercenary), five characters in Veteran difficulty, and six in Elite difficulty. Aside from being able to recruit non-player characters (NPCs) that function much like the player's own character, players can also buy pets that grow after being fed items. However, unlike its predecessor, the hirable NPCs have unique personalities and can converse with the player and each other at certain points in the game; they even have their own personal side quests. Pets start off with a basic attack (and spell if applicable), gain a Power upon reaching the third level of growth, and finally gain an emanation upon becoming Mature. Emanations are special pet-only auras that provide beneficial effects to friendly characters within range (such as increased mana regeneration).\n\nThe magic system in \"Dungeon Siege II\" remains largely unchanged. Combat Mages and Nature Mages still have access to separate spell lines that increase in power as the character levels. However, combat and nature magic are much more distinct from each other than in \"Dungeon Siege\". Combat magic focuses on causing massive amounts of damage and weakening enemies with curses, while nature magic focuses more on healing, summoning and strengthening party members with embrace and wrath enchantments.\n\nParties are limited to a maximum of two concurrent buffs. Pets' spells count towards this buff limit, but their emanations (see above) do not. Weapon enhancement spells, used by the Fist of Stone and Blood Assassin characters introduced in the expansion, also do not count towards this limit. Each enemy may only have one debuff placed on it at a time. All negative effects count towards this limit, including curses and stuns.\n\n\"Dungeon Siege II\"'s \"game over\" system is similar to that in many other role-playing games. When a character loses enough health, they usually fall into a state of unconsciousness. The character falls to the ground, unable to move, and must wait for their health to slowly regenerate itself or wait for magical healing from another character. If a character is hit hard enough by an enemy, or if an enemy is persistent in attacking an unconscious character, the character may eventually be killed. Once death occurs, the character can no longer be healed and must be resurrected by another character or by a special Necromancer NPC in town. If the entire party is slain, the party may choose to continue by respawning back in town without their equipment. Their equipment is left on their corpses. The party must then find a way to retrieve its fallen equipment, either by venturing back to the characters' corpses or by having them summoned to town by a Necromancer NPC for a monetary charge.\n\n\"Dungeon Siege II\" supports multiplayer cooperative gaming over LAN, the Internet, and the GameSpy network. Multiple players can cooperate in separate-but-allied parties. There is a total limit of eight characters, though only four can be player-controlled. Purchased pets count towards this limit but summoned creatures (from spells) do not. There is an unsupported \"old school\" mode in multiplayer, allowing up to eight players to play simultaneously. To enable this, add \"oldschool=true\" (without quotes) to command line or the .ini file.\n\nFor LAN and Internet play, saved games are stored on the players' own computers. For GameSpy play, saved games and characters are stored on GameSpy's servers. The GameSpy environment limits the amount of online cheating that can take place, but as of late beta, the possibility still existed. GameSpy characters can be downloaded from the GameSpy servers to players' computers, where they can then be used for Internet, LAN, and single-player games. The reverse is not true: GameSpy characters can only be created and leveled on the GameSpy network itself. GS network makes an attempt to support only original games; unlicensed copies are blocked if they cannot mimic the CD-Key. Online play may therefore also not be possible with a second-hand game. The Steam version of \"Dungeon Siege II\" does not support multiplayer functionality.\n\nThe game begins with the player-controlled protagonist and their friend, Drevin, serving as mercenaries in the army of Valdis, a warlord who has aligned himself with a race of Dark Wizards and wields the magical Sword of Zaramoth. The player character and Drevin are ordered to capture a temple held by dryads. After the temple is captured, however, Valdis attacks the mercenaries. Drevin is killed, and the player character is knocked unconscious.\n\nThe player character regains consciousness in the custody of the dryads. Rather than execute them, the dryads allow the player to earn their freedom by helping them in the war against Valdis. After the protagonist earns freedom, they discover that they are infected with the Plague, a mysterious disease created by the Dark Wizards that drives its victims to insanity. After being cured by the water from an Elven shrine, they return to their hometown.\n\nOn the way home, the player character rescues an old man from Plague-maddened dryads. The old man describes an event called the Great Cataclysm, caused when the Sword of Zaramoth that Valdis wields struck a magical shield called the Shield of Azunai. The blow shattered the shield, causing a catastrophe that ended the First Age. Valdis hopes to cause another such catastrophe by gathering the shards of the Shield of Azunai so he can shatter it again. The old man explains the Plague, saying that it is caused by crystals created during the Great Cataclysm that give license to the souls of Zaramoth's army to possess the living.\n\nAfter the player character returns home, they begin to gather the pieces of the shield to use it against Valdis. After they gather all of the pieces, they take them to the Agallan giants so that they can re-forge the shield. As they re-forge it, they place a medallion in the center of it for added durability. This medallion had previously been worn by Drevin; he gave it to the player character before he died.\n\nWith the shield re-forged, the player character travels to Valdis' stronghold known as Zaramoth's Horns. The shield protects them from the Dark Wizards, but the battle with Valdis himself proves to be a stalemate until the old man appears and takes the shield from the player character. He gives the shield to Valdis, revealing that he is a Dark Wizard. Valdis tries to destroy the shield with the Sword of Zaramoth, but when he strikes the shield, his sword shatters instead. Valdis and the player character resume the battle, in which Valdis is killed.\n\n2K Games released \"Dungeon Siege II: Broken World\" in September 2006. The expansion pack introduces several features, including an additional act (campaign), two hybrid classes based on existing classes, Dwarves as a playable race, enchantment-based \"recipes\", two pets purchasable at the act's main town, including the Pack Ram and Kohl Beast, and the PlayStation Portable crossover items to promote and to be used in conjunction with \"\".\n\n\"Dungeon Siege II: Deluxe Edition\" is a special collector's set that includes the original \"Dungeon Siege II\", \"Broken World\" expansion pack, and a number of collectible items spanning maps, portraits, wallpapers and a \"The Making of \"Dungeon Siege II\"\" video file on CD-ROM. It was released on October 23, 2006.\n\nThe game received generally favorable reviews based on 51 critic reviews, scoring an 80 on Metacritic.\n\n\"Dungeon Siege II\" won \"PC Gamer US\"s \"Best Roleplaying Game 2005\" award. The magazine's Greg Vederman called it \"that rare sequel that rises above its predecessor in just about every way.\"\n\n"}

The different forms of spelling is driven by euphonic (sandhi) rules of Sanskrit, useful in different contexts.\n\n\n\"Satchitananda\" is therefore translated as \"Truth Consciousness Bliss\", \"Reality Consciousness Bliss\", or \"Existence Consciousness Bliss\".\n\nThe term is contextually related to \"the ultimate reality\" in various schools of Hindu traditions. In theistic traditions, \"sacchidananda\" is same as God such as Vishnu, Shiva or Goddess in Shakti traditions. In monist traditions, \"sacchidananda\" is considered directly inseparable from \"nirguna\" (attributeless) Brahman or the \"universal wholeness of existence\", wherein the Brahman is identical with Atman, the true individual self. \"Satchitananda\" or Brahman is held to be the source of all reality, source of all conscious thought, and source of all perfection-bliss. It is the ultimate, the complete, the destination of spiritual pursuit in Hinduism.\n\nThe Brihadaranyaka Upanishad ( 800–600 BCE) is among the earliest Hindu texts which links and then discusses Atman (soul), Brahman (ultimate reality), awareness, joy and bliss such as in sections 2.4, 3.9 and 4.3. The Chandogya Upanishad (~800-600 BCE), in section 3.14 to 3.18, discusses Atman and Brahman, these being identical to \"that which shines and glows both inside and outside\", \"dear\", \"pure knowing, awareness\", \"one's innermost being\", \"highest light\", \"luminous\". Other 1st-millennium BCE texts, such as the Taittiriya Upanishad in section 2.1, as well as minor Upanishads, discuss Atman and Brahman in saccidananda-related terminology.\n\nAn early mention of the compound word \"sacchidananda\" is in verse 3.11 of Tejobindu Upanishad, composed before the 4th-century CE. The context of \"sacchidananda\" is explained in the Upanishad as follows:\n\nThe Vedantic philosophy understands \"saccidānanda\" as a synonym of the three fundamental attributes of Brahman. In Advaita Vedanta, states Werner, it is the sublimely blissful experience of the boundless, pure consciousness and represents the unity of spiritual essence of ultimate reality.\n\nSaccidānanda is an epithet for Brahman, considered indescribable, unitary, ultimate, unchanging reality in Hinduism.\n\nTulsidas considers Rama as \"Satcitananda\".\n\n\n\n"}

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba as a Liberal-Progressive from 1935 to 1962, and was a cabinet minister in the government of Douglas L. Campbell. His father, Albert Préfontaine, had previously served in the Assembly for twenty-nine years, and was a cabinet minister in John Bracken's government.\n\nFluently bilingual, Préfontaine was educated at the University of Manitoba and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1918. He worked as a farmer, and as a breeder of pure Holsteins. He also served as director of the Winnipeg District Milk Producers Cooperative Association.\n\nThe Préfontaines were prominent Franco-Manitoban family in the Conservative Party during World War I. Although popular opinion among Canadian francophones was generally against the war, Edmond Préfontaine enlisted for service on May 12, 1918, following his graduation. He spent four months at the Petawawa Training Camp, and might have served overseas had the war not come to an end. After the war, the Préfontaines left the Conservative Party for the United Farmers of Manitoba, and later for the Liberal-Progressives.\n\nAfter Albert Préfontaine died in 1935, Edmond campaigned to succeed him in the rural constituency of Carillon. He was successful, defeating his sole opponent, Louis-P. Gagnon, by 155 votes. A Liberal-Progressive, he was a backbench supporter of Bracken's government.\n\nPréfontaine was re-elected in the 1936 and 1941 provincial elections, and won without opposition in 1945. From 1940 to 1950, Manitoba was governed by a multi-party coalition dominated by the Liberal-Progressives, and also including the Progressive Conservatives. Préfontaine was a supporter of the coalition for many years, but crossed to the opposition benches in 1949.\n\nIn the 1949 election, Préfontaine campaigned as an Independent Liberal opposing the coalition government. He was again re-elected, defeating government candidate H.B. Johnson by 600 votes. During this period, he described the coalition as damaging to the British system of parliamentary government.\n\nPréfontaine rejoined the government side in 1950, as the coalition was coming to a close. He was appointed to Campbell's cabinet as Municipal Commissioner on December 1, 1951. This position was restructured on April 20, 1953, and Préfontaine was sworn in as the province's first Minister of Municipal Affairs. In the 1953 provincial election, he described a vote for the Liberal-Progressives as a vote for \"progress plus sanity\" (\"Winnipeg Free Press\", 21 May 1953).\n\nEasily returned as a Liberal-Progressive candidate in the 1953 election, Préfontaine was given the additional portfolio of Provincial Secretary on September 4, 1953. He held both cabinet positions until June 30, 1958, when the Campbell government resigned from office.\n\nLloyd Stinson, leader of the Manitoba CCF, once described Préfontaine as an \"independent spirit\", and claimed he never seemed comfortable in the Campbell administration.\n\nPréfontaine was re-elected in the 1958 election. The Liberal-Progressives, who in one form or another had governed Manitoba since 1915, were defeated by Dufferin Roblin's Progressive Conservatives in this election, and Préfontaine moved with his party to the opposition benches. He was again re-elected in the 1959 election, but did not run in 1962.\n\nPréfontaine's son, René Préfontaine, was also active in politics, though ironically as a supporter of Roblin's Progressive Conservatives. It was on Edmond's advice that René turned down an offer to join the Roblin cabinet in 1959.\n\nPréfontaine died in Quebec City in 1971 following a lengthy illness.\n"}

{"id": "1941141", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1941141", "title": "Helen Forrest", "text": "Helen Forrest\n\nHelen Forrest (born Helen Fogel, April 12, 1917 – July 11, 1999) was an American singer of traditional pop and swing music. She served as the \"girl singer\" for three of the most popular big bands of the Swing Era (Artie Shaw, Benny Goodman, and Harry James), thereby earning a reputation as \"the voice of the name bands.\"\n\nForrest was born in Atlantic City, New Jersey on April 12, 1917. Her parents, Louis and Rebecca Fogel, were Jewish. Her father died from influenza when Helen was an infant so she was raised by her mother, who often blamed her husband's death on Helen's birth. She believed God had taken her husband because she had wished so much for a baby girl. Helen had three older brothers: Harry, Ed, and Sam. In Helen's early teen years, the family relocated to Brooklyn. Her mother married a house painter, whom Helen disliked. Soon, Helen's mother and stepfather turned the family's home into a brothel. At 14, Helen was nearly raped by her stepfather; she defended herself with a kitchen knife, injuring him. Following this, Helen's mother permitted her to live with her piano teacher, Honey Silverman, and her family. While teaching her piano, Honey noticed Helen's singing ability and encouraged her to focus on singing instead. Anxious to find a career in singing, Helen dropped out of high school to pursue her dream.\n\nForrest returned to Atlantic City and began singing with her brother Ed's band. She soon returned to New York City, where she visited song publishers and performed an audition for a 15-minute slot for a local radio show. Around this time, Forrest was encouraged to change her name from \"Fogel\" because her name sounded \"too Jewish.\" In 1934, 17-year-old Forrest began singing for WNEW in New York. She also performed for WCBS where she was known as “Bonnie Blue” and “The Blue Lady of Song.” Eventually she found a singing job at the Madrillon Club, in Washington, D.C., where she performed for approximately two years.\n\nAfter seeing Forrest at the Madrillon, bandleader Artie Shaw asked her to go on tour with him; Shaw was looking for new talent when vocalist Billie Holiday decided to leave the band. Helen was hired in 1938. For a time she and Holiday were both working with Shaw's band. In some venues, African-American performers were required to remain off stage until they performed. When Forrest became aware of this, she stated that like Holiday, she would also not take the stage until she was to sing. She recorded 38 singles with Shaw's band. Two of her biggest hits with Shaw were the songs \"They Say\" and \"All the Things You Are.\" During her time with Shaw, Helen Forrest became a national favorite. In November 1939, Shaw broke up his band.\n\nHelen joined Benny Goodman in December 1939, with whom she recorded a number of celebrated songs, including the hit song \"The Man I Love.\" Helen recorded 55 studio recordings with Goodman. She told the \"Pop Chronicles\" radio series: \"Benny would look right above your eyebrows, in the middle, right on top of the brow. He was a very strange man\", and described Goodman as the most demanding band leader she sang for. Forrest also stated, \"The band I joined was sensational, but few special arrangements were written for me. I sang choruses, and made myself fit to the music. Benny used to drive me crazy by 'noodling' behind me on clarinet while I sang.\" Goodman was also reported to have been a perfectionist and a very difficult man to work with. In August 1941, Forrest quit the orchestra \"to avoid having a nervous breakdown\". After leaving Goodman, Forrest briefly recorded with Nat King Cole and Lionel Hampton.\n\nIn 1941, she approached Harry James, offering to work for him under one condition: that she be permitted to sing more than one chorus. Although James was looking for a more jazz-oriented singer, he allowed Forrest to audition. The band voted her in and she was hired. Several decades later, Forrest explained in an interview, \"Harry James was wonderful. When I joined him, I said, 'There's only one condition: I don't care how much you pay me, I don't care about arrangements. The one thing I want is to start a chorus and finish it. I want to do verses, so don't put me up for a chorus in the middle of an instrumental.' He said, 'You got it,' and that was it.\" She also told writer George T. Simon, \"I'll always remain grateful to Artie and Benny. But they had been featuring me more like they did a member of the band, almost like another instrumental soloist. Harry, though, gave me just the right sort of arrangement and setting that fit a singer. It wasn't just a matter of my getting up, singing a chorus, and sitting down again.\" In his book, \"The Big Bands\", Simon explained that Harry James constructed \"the arrangements around his horn and Helen's voice, establishing warmer moods by slowing down the tempo so that two, instead of the usual three or more choruses, would fill a record ...many an arrangement would build to a closing climax during Helen's vocal, so that she would emerge as its star.\" It was with the Harry James Orchestra that Helen recorded what are arguably her most popular numbers, including \"I Had the Craziest Dream\" in 1942, and 1941's \"I Don't Want to Walk Without You.\" In 1942, Helen also appeared with the Harry James Band in the Hollywood film \"Springtime in the Rockies\", starring Betty Grable.\n\nIn 1942 and 1943, Helen Forrest was voted the best female vocalist in the United States in the \"Down Beat\" poll.\n\nForrest left Harry James in late 1943 in pursuit of a solo career, saying \"three years with a band is enough.\" She signed a recording contract with Decca and co-starred with Dick Haymes on \"The Dick Haymes Show\" on CBS radio from 1944 to 1947. Helen's first Decca disc, \"Time Waits For No One\", reached second place on the Hit Parade, and the radio show achieved top ratings. Haymes was also contracted to Decca, and from 1944 to 1946 the pair recorded 18 duets, 10 of them reaching the Top Ten. Particularly successful were their versions of \"Long Ago and Far Away\", \"It Had To Be You\", \"Together\", \"I'll Buy That Dream\", \"I'm Always Chasing Rainbows\" and \"Oh, What It Seemed To Be\". In 1944, she made an appearance in the Esther Williams movie \"Bathing Beauty\" with Harry James and his orchestra. She also appeared in the film \"Two Girls and a Sailor.\" During the last years of the 1940s, Helen headlined at theatres and clubs.\n\nIn 1955, Helen's mother died. In that same year, Helen joined Harry James again in the studio to record a new swing album called, \"Harry James in Hi-Fi\", which became a bestseller. By the end of the 1950s, Helen's solo career waned as rock'n'roll became increasingly popular. Helen's manager, Joe Graydon, said, \"She was at an `in-between' stage in her career. Not young enough to be current. Not old enough to be nostalgia.\"\n\nAfter a dip in recording in the 1950s, including a stint with the startup Bell Records, Helen sang with Tommy Dorsey's orchestra, led by Sam Donahue, in the early 1960s. Helen continued to make occasional records and perform in concerts and was performing at Lake Tahoe with Frank Sinatra Jr. in 1963 when he was kidnapped.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, Forrest performed in supper clubs on \"big band nostalgia\" tours, including appearances with Harry James and Dick Haymes. In 1977, Helen participated in a television reunion of herself, James, and Haymes on \"The Merv Griffin Show\". This led to a touring production called The Fabulous 40s (1978), followed in 1979 with a similar revue entitled The Big Broadcast of 1944. In 1980, six months following Haymes' death, Helen suffered a stroke, but recovered to resume performing and recording. Her autobiography, \"I Had the Craziest Dream\", was published in 1982 and is dedicated to her only son. In 1983, Helen released her final album, entitled \"Now and Forever\". She also starred with Vivian Blaine and Margaret Whiting in a stage revue titled \"A Tribute to Dick Haymes\".\n\nDespite an unhappy childhood, frequent illness, and personal disappointments, Forrest remained dedicated to her musical profession and continued singing until the early 1990s when rheumatoid arthritis began to affect her vocal chords and forced her into retirement. Forrest also suffered scarlet fever as a youngster, which left her with a hearing loss. The loss of her hearing worsened as she became older and she was able to perform her old standards because she remembered where the notes for them were.\n\nHelen Forrest died on July 11, 1999, from congestive heart failure at the Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles. She was 82.\n\nHer final resting place, Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery, in the Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles, in an unmarked grave. Online funding provided her with a grave stone.\n\nDuring her life, Helen married and divorced three times. In 1960, Helen (with her third husband, Charles Feinman) gave birth to her only son, Michael Forrest Feinman. Michael resided in southern California until his death on May 1, 2014.\n\nIn the early 1940s, Forrest had a love affair with bandleader Harry James while she was part of his band. The relationship ended shortly before James met the woman he would later marry, actress Betty Grable. Forrest wrote, \"I've had three marriages and I never married Harry, but he was the love of my life. Let's face it, I still carry a torch for the so-and-so.\"\n\nHelen Forrest on her career:\n\n\"\"I live for today, but it is nice sometimes to look back to yesterday. We did not know that we were living through an era - the Big Band Era - that would last only 10 years or so and be remembered and revered for ever...it's hard to believe, but the best times were packed into a five-year period from the late 1930s through the early 1940s when I sang with the bands of Artie Shaw, Benny Goodman, and Harry James. The most dramatic moments of my life were crammed into a couple of years from the fall of 1941 to the end of 1943. They seem to symbolize my life...that was when the music of the dance bands was the most popular music in the country, and I was the most popular female band singer in the country and Harry had the most popular band in the country. It didn't last long, but it sure was something while it lasted. Everyone should have something like it at least once in their lives. I'm grateful I did.\"\" - Helen Forrest (circa 1982)\n\nAt the peak of her career, Helen Forrest was the most popular female singer in the United States. Because of her work with the bands of Artie Shaw, Benny Goodman, and Harry James, she is known as \"the voice of the name bands\" and is regarded by some as the best female vocalist of the swing era. In addition, AllMusic describes Forrest as \"a performer that some might not consider a jazz vocalist, but one with exceptional ability to project lyrics and also an excellent interpreter.\" Also, IMDb describes Forrest: \"though Helen was not, perhaps, a jazz singer in the truest sense, she brought to her songs a wistful 'girl-next-door' quality\" through her \"femininity and warmth of her voice and the clear, emotional phrasing of her lyrics.\" In his book \"The Big Bands\", writer George Simon wrote, \"Helen was a wonderfully warm and natural singer.\"\n\nOver the course of her career, Helen Forrest recorded more than 500 songs. In 2001, she was posthumously inducted into the now-defunct Big Band and Jazz Hall of Fame.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1941153", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1941153", "title": "San Antonio Gunslingers", "text": "San Antonio Gunslingers\n\nThe San Antonio Gunslingers were a professional American football team based in San Antonio, Texas that played in the USFL in 1984 and 1985. Owned by oil magnate Clinton Manges, the team played its home games in Alamo Stadium and its colors were kelly green, royal blue, silver, and white. Rick Neuheisel was the team's quarterback.\n\nGoing into the 1984 season, the USFL made the decision to expand to eighteen franchises in order to boost league capital. However, efforts to expand to Minneapolis-St. Paul and Seattle fell through. San Antonio was mentioned as a possible market for expansion, as rapid growth through the 1970s propelled it to major-city status. By 1984, almost 800,000 people lived in San Antonio, making it the 11th largest city in the United States. Despite this, a series of studies of possible new cities concluded that San Antonio could not support a USFL team. The San Antonio area, then as now, was considered a medium-sized market because the surrounding suburban and rural areas were far smaller than the city itself.\n\nThe owners were also somewhat skeptical about Manges's bid, not in the least because he planned to base the team at Alamo Stadium, a Works Progress Administration project and high school stadium that seated only 18,000 people. Ultimately, fears that Manges would seek a franchise in a proposed league started by WFL, American Basketball Association, and World Hockey Association co-founder Dennis Murphy tipped the scales in his favor. At the time, the flamboyant oil baron was a member of the Forbes 400, and was thought to be one of the richest men in Texas. The USFL did not want to risk losing his apparent wealth to a rival league. Ultimately, the league folded before it could get off the ground when the USFL placed teams in three of its potential markets–San Antonio, Memphis, and Houston.\n\nThe USFL had endeavored to avoid the mistakes of the ill-fated World Football League by requiring perspective owners to undergo a detailed due diligence and requiring franchises to meet strict capitalization requirements. However, as the league had initially not planned to expand to San Antonio, it neglected to perform any meaningful due diligence on Manges's original application. Once the franchises in Minnesota and Seattle had fallen through, the league had few options that could fall back on if it was to field 18 teams for the 1984 campaign. With little time to examine Magnes's financial situation, league officials apparently concluded that given the San Antonio owner's perceived wealth, his application carried little risk. Additionally, despite – or perhaps, because of – his apparent oil fortune, the league also didn't require Manges to make an initial capital investment (as is standard for most major league sports franchises). Instead, Manges appeared to pay team expenses out-of-pocket as they arose.\n\nThe result was an organization that was notoriously cheap, even by USFL standards. The front office was staffed mainly by friends and family. The team bus was an old San Antonio Independent School District bus with a malfunctioning gas gauge; the driver had to manually check the tank. The Gunslingers had to add 14,000 folding chairs around the end zones to bring the stadium to the USFL's minimum capacity. The team office was located in a double-wide trailer in the Alamo Stadium parking lot.\n\nManges hired local coaching legend Gil Steinke to run the team as general manager and head coach. In 23 years at nearby Texas A&I, Steinke had a record of 195-63-5, including a 6-1 record in NAIA Championship games. However, Steinke had been off the sidelines for almost a decade, and was displaying clear signs of mental deterioration. He frequently forgot plays and play calls, and got lost in cities that he supposedly knew well. In a league with free-spending owners, Steinke's Gunslingers rarely had the edge in talent but most games were very disciplined on the field, allowing them to remain somewhat competitive in spite of the team's shoestring budget.\n\nThe Gunslingers showed moments of offensive competence most games, but lacked the game breakers that other teams had. The team was populated with football players, not athletes. If they were going to score, it would be a long, drawn-out drive. The Gunslingers were an average rushing team, in spite of having no true feature back. QB Rick Neuheisel played solidly for the team, nickel and diming the team up and down the field, and the intense \"Bounty Hunter\" defense led by players like Jeff McIntyre, John Barefield, Peter Raeford, Rich D'Amico, Jim Bob Morris, and Putt Choate kept the Gunslingers within striking distance almost every week. Notably, the team was +13 in turnovers---a sign of a well coached team.\n\nCoach/general manager Steinke managed to rally the modestly talented team to a 7-7 finish after an 0-4 start, keeping them in the playoff race until the last few weeks of the season. However, the Gunslingers' most enduring memory of that first season was when the lights at Alamo Stadium went out during their second game—and didn't come back on for 48 minutes. According to Neuheisel, the head of municipal power company City Public Service deliberately cut the power after having a falling-out with Manges. They finished the game with temporary lights, though by most accounts it was still somewhat dark.\n\nThe team remained competitive despite Alamo Stadium's poor playing conditions. The locker rooms were cramped and had no air conditioning. The playing surface was an extremely thin AstroTurf carpet atop a concrete slab, resulting in numerous knee injuries. Many players came down with skin infections because Manges was unwilling to pay to keep the field clean. The field was painted with industrial-grade paint that dried hard. Combined with the thin surface, this turned rug burns usually common on artificial surfaces into severe rashes and scabs in San Antonio.\n\nAdditionally, team officials frequently deactivated non-marquee players every third game in a cost-cutting move. The standard USFL contract required players to be active in three consecutive games to earn their full salaries. Neuheisel recalled that players often faked injuries to keep from being deactivated.\n\nThe Gunslingers only drew 15,444 fans per game, in large part because they had already built a reputation for being short of professional standards. For instance, they tried to save money by mailing press releases in bulk, resulting in them arriving days after games. Among the promotions they attempted were cowboys firing real guns into the air.\n\nDefensive coordinator Jim Bates was rewarded with a promotion to head coach in 1985. However, according to Bates's successor as defensive coordinator, Tim Marcum, who would later go on to fame in the Arena Football League, the coaches and players already considered Bates to be their true on-field leader. Steinke remained general manager. They also acquired Larry Canada, the Chicago Blitz' leading rusher.\n\nDespite their strong finish, by the start of the 1985 season, the Gunslingers were known to be badly undercapitalized, unlike most of their USFL brethren.\n\nThe Gunslingers' ramshackle financial structure caught up with them early in 1985. The price of oil tumbled as low as $11 or $12 a barrel, decimating Manges's fortune. The Gunslingers quickly fired all of their secretaries, and virtually all of the public relations staffers resigned. The on-field operation suffered as well; they had no scouts or practice squad. It would soon emerge that the Gunslingers' owner had been in financial trouble since at least 1980.\n\nWith Manges suddenly unwilling and/or unable to continue using his personal wealth to underwrite the franchise's mounting expenses, the club found itself in a situation not unlike those faced by many teams in the ill-fated WFL. Players and coaches frequently had their checks bounce. Neuheisel and linebacker Jeff McIntyre where the only two players with a personal services contract. When the \"San Antonio Express-News\" broke the story, Manges reacted by revoking the paper's press credentials. The situation got so dire at one point that several players traded tickets for food and stayed with sympathetic fans because they couldn't afford to pay the rent for their apartments. Years later, Neuheisel told ESPN that the players raced each other to the bank to cash their checks, knowing that half (if not more) of them would bounce. However, the team had to use creative methods to meet payroll even before then; as mentioned above, they were notorious for deactivating players every third game.\n\nThe \"San Antonio Light\" reported that the Internal Revenue Service had slapped two liens on the Gunslingers for over $400,000 in back payroll taxes, further squeezing the franchise's financial picture. Eventually, Manges ordered his employees not to discuss the team's finances, and even had reporters bounced from the locker room.\n\nOn April 7, Manges promised that the payroll problem would be fixed, going as far as to issue promissory notes. However, the checks bounced again on the following payday, which particularly rankled the players when they saw Manges and his top staffers riding limousines. A month later, the team was nearly left stranded in Orlando when the check for the flight home bounced. They only made it back to San Antonio after Lieutenant Governor Bill Hobby, a Manges confidant, intervened to guarantee payment. After another late payroll on May 29, the players walked out of practice, and only returned after Manges told team president Bud Haun that he would shut the team down if they didn't return.\n\nOn one occasion, an arbitrator threatened to release 30 players from their contracts if Manges didn't make good on their bounced checks. On another, several players threatened to sit out a June 9 game against the Los Angeles Express unless they were paid. After a month of missed paydays, Bates threatened to quit unless the players were paid by the team's contest against the Oakland Invaders. The money never arrived, and Bates walked out, forcing Steinke to take over for the last six games of the season.\n\nIn June, Manges simply stopped paying the franchise's bills. The players and coaches played the last four games of the season without being paid. Not surprisingly, the Gunslingers barely survived the season. Due in large part to a nonexistent rushing attack (their leading rusher, George Works, only ran for a total of 452 yards), they finished with the second-worst record in the league. Attendance crashed to 11,721, the second-worst in the league. Shortly after the season, after another missed payroll, the entire roster was put on waivers.\n\nA month after the season, Commissioner Harry Usher had seen enough. He ordered Manges to make restitution for the team's debts in 15 days, or lose the franchise. When this didn't occur, the Gunslingers became the only USFL franchise to be revoked. The dubious distinction was, to an extent, academic. The USFL, which had been planning to move to a fall schedule in 1986, ultimately folded without playing another game.\n\nThe Gunslingers' holding company, South Texas Sports, was auctioned off to pay more than $650,000 of debts to former players. The players also sued Manges to recover back pay, but that suit collapsed when Manges filed for bankruptcy. At least some of the players still hadn't been paid at the time of a 1998 reunion, and no players or staff members that were owed back wages had been paid at the time of Manges's death in 2010.\n\n\nSources\n\nSources\n\nNO.

Friedman and Chris Black from a story idea from Friedman and Paul Brown, and was directed by Mike Vejar.\n\nSet in the 22nd century, the series follows the adventures of the first Starfleet starship \"Enterprise\", registration NX-01. Season three of \"Enterprise\" features an ongoing story following an attack on Earth by previously unknown aliens called the Xindi. In this episode, Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) and the crew visit an alien bazaar seeking a formula to help protect the ship against the anomalies in the Delphic Expanse. They bring back on board a former slave called Rajiin (Nikita Ager), whose motivations are not what the crew initially believe.\n\nSeveral sets were built for the episode, including the alien bazaar. Filming took longer than the normal seven days, with secondary shoots taking an additional day and a half. It was the highest-rated episode of the season so far, with 4.52 million viewers watching the first broadcast. However, the critical reception was mixed with criticism levelled at the \"gratitious\" female sexuality seen but the reviewers were pleased that it showed a sense of continuity in the overall Xindi arc with it described as a \"space opera\".\n\nThe Xindi Council meet to discuss the progress of \"Enterprise\". Although the Reptilians and Insectoids want to attack the humans, Degra advises them to continue with the plan to build the superweapon.

Meanwhile, T'Pol and Tucker attempt to replicate the chemical from B'Rat's formula but the first attempt fails.\n\nAfterwards, T'Pol returns to her cabin and is surprised to find Rajiin inside. She tries to resist, but is soon overcome. Rajiin attempts to flee using the transporter, but is quickly captured and placed in the brig. As Archer attempts to question her, Lieutenant Reed informs him that two Reptilian ships are on an intercept course. Rajiin admits she was gathering information for the Xindi. Reptilians, after running battles with the crew, retrieve Rajiin and take her back to one of the ships. \"Enterprise\" attempts to pursue, but the Xindi enters a subspace vortex. Afterwards, the Council convenes again to discuss the development and construction of a new bio-weapon, a project helped by Archer's bio-data that was stolen by Rajiin.\n\nFilming on \"Rajiin\" began on July 30, 2003, and primary shooting concluded after seven days filming on August 7. The second unit continued on August 8, with a further half day of shooting taking place the following week during the filming of the following episode \"\". This was the first episode to be worked on by Brent V. Friedman, who had joined the staff as a Consulting Producer. He had previously been a producer on other similar genre television series such as \"Dark Skies\" and \"The Twilight Zone\". \"Rajiin\" was directed by Mike Vejar, who had previously directed episodes of \"\", \"\" and \"\". This was his fifth episode of \"Enterprise\", and his first of season three.\n\nSeveral sets were built for this episode, including an alien bazaar and a chemical laboratory. As the Xindi council returned in Rajiin for the first time after the first episode of the season \"The Xindi\", the guest stars who had appeared as their members returned. These included Tucker Smallwood, Randy Oglesby, Rick Worthy and Scott MacDonald. The titular character, Rajiin, was played by Nikita Ager. She had recently appeared in the television film \"Mermaids\", which had also been co-written by Friedman. Main cast member Dominic Keating described Ager, saying \"This girl is HOT! Oh my word. I forgot my lines a couple of times.\" Dell Yount appeared as B'Rat; he had previously appeared in the \"Deep Space Nine\" episode \"Sons of Mogh\".\n\n\"Rajiin\" was first aired on October 1, 2003 on UPN. It received a 2.7/4% share, meaning that it was seen by 2.6 percent of all households, and 4 percent of all households watching television at the time of the broadcast. This translated to approximately 4.52 million viewers. It was the highest rated episode of season three at that point, despite it going up against \"Smallville\" on The WB for the first time this season.\n\nIn her review for TrekNation, Michelle Erica Green said that she was pleased with the continuity seen in \"Rajiin\" but felt that the female sexuality seen in this episode was the \"most gratuitous... I can remember on Trek\". She thought that the Rajiin character was a cliché, calling her a \"trained slut who comes on to everyone around her\". Green described the overall plot as \"feeble\", but praised the alien bazaar set. Jamahl Epsicokhan, on his website \"Jammer's Reviews\", said that \"Rajiin\" demonstrated that there was an intention for the Xindi story-arc to be a fully fledged space opera. He thought that the episode was average for the third season, and wasn't as good as \"\". However, he felt that the scenes were reminiscent of comic books, saying that \"There's nothing really wrong with that. Nothing great about it either.\" He gave it a score of 2.5/4.\n\nThe first home media release of \"Raijin\" was as part of the season three DVD box set, released in the United States on September 27, 2005. The Blu-ray release of the third season of \"Enterprise\" took place on January 7, 2014.\n\n"}

She is known for portraying the character of Jenny Humphrey on The CW's teen drama series \"Gossip Girl\" (2007–2012) and Cindy Lou Who in the film \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\" (2000).\nAfter her retirement from acting, she became widely known for being the frontwoman of the American rock band The Pretty Reckless.\n\nMomsen was born in St. Louis, Missouri. Her parents are Michael and Collette Momsen and she has a younger sister, Sloane Momsen, who is also an actress. She has Russian ancestry. She was raised Roman Catholic and attended Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic School for elementary school and later Herbert Hoover Middle School in Potomac, Maryland but is now non-religious. She also studied dance at the Center of Creative Arts in St. Louis.\n\nMomsen was signed with Ford Models at a very young age: \"My parents signed me up with Ford [Modeling] at the age of 2. No 2-year-old wants to be working, but I had no choice. My whole life, I was in and out of school. I didn't have friends. I was working constantly and I didn't have a real life.\" She began acting professionally at three years of age in a 1997 national commercial for Shake 'n Bake. She was then cast in \"The Prophet's Game\".\n\nMomsen is included on the list of Unclaimed Coogan accounts for performing children whose partial childhood earnings are mandated to be put in a special fund but who have yet to claim their earnings.\n\nIn 2000, Momsen played the role of Cindy Lou Who in Dr. Seuss' \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\", her breakout role. In 2002, she played Gretel in \"Hansel and Gretel\" and Alexandra, the President's daughter, in \"\".\n\nMomsen's career came to a halt for over three years until she received a lead role in the WB series \"Misconceptions\", which never aired. After that, she also appeared in the 2006 film \"Saving Shiloh\". She also auditioned for the title role in \"Hannah Montana\", and was in the top three, but the role was instead awarded to Miley Cyrus—a decision that Momsen was happy with in retrospect. In 2007, she starred in the Walt Disney Pictures film \"Underdog\" as Molly and as Jennifer in the movie \"Paranoid Park\", directed by Gus Van Sant.\n\nBeginning in 2007, she played the character of Jenny Humphrey in The CW television series \"Gossip Girl\", based on the book series by Cecily von Ziegesar. Momsen's appearances on the series became increasingly sporadic, and, by the end of the first half of the fourth season, she had only appeared in four episodes. It was then announced that the actress would be scheduled for an indefinite hiatus from the show, which ended with her leaving the series as a regular cast member after the completion of the fourth season in 2011. On August 16, 2011, Momsen told \"Elle\" magazine that she had quit acting to focus on her music career. On October 16, 2012, it was reported that Momsen would be returning to \"Gossip Girl\" for its final episode, in which she appeared briefly in the wedding sequence.\n\nIn June 2008, at the age of fourteen, Momsen signed to IMG Models. She was the face of British fashion chain New Look for its spring/summer 2010 collection. After weeks of speculation about who would be the face of Madonna's 2010 fashion line \"Material Girl\", Momsen was announced on July 15, 2010. A week later, Momsen was announced as the model for John Galliano's new women's fragrance, scheduled to launch in autumn 2010. In 2010, she appeared in a video for Galliano's \"Parlez-Moi d'Amour\" fragrance ad campaign.\n\nMomsen is the face of Samantha Thavasa's handbag line. She has done multiple photoshoots, press events, and commercials.\n\nMomsen appeared on the cover of \"Page Six Magazine\" when she was 15 years old in 2009. She also appeared on the February 2010 cover of \"Seventeen\". In October 2010, Momsen wore a pair of platform stilettos, thigh-high stockings, and a holster strapped around her leg for \"Revolver\". She appeared on the cover of \"FHM\"'s March 2012 edition and \"FHM\" ranked Momsen #29 in its 2012 Hot 100 issue. She also made her cover debut for \"Maxim\" in the November 2013 issue.\n\nIn an interview with music journalist, Jason Tanamor, when asked about posing for Playboy, she said, \"I was at the mansion last week and took some pictures. Does that count?\"\n\nMomsen has said that \"music is where I can be me\", stating that \"acting is easy. I've been doing it for so long and I totally love it. But you're playing a character instead of yourself. Music is more personal because you're writing it and you're involved in every step of it.\" At 7 years old, Momsen recorded the song \"Christmas, Why Can't I Find You?\" for the soundtrack to \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\". In 2002, she recorded the songs \"One Small Voice\" and \"Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer\" for the compilation album \"School's Out! Christmas\".\n\nIn March 2009, Momsen stated in an interview with \"OK!\" magazine that her band the Pretty Reckless had signed a deal with Interscope Records.

After the tour, Momsen began working with guitarist Ben Phillips, who would soon join the band. Momsen subsequently swapped out her former bandmates. She co-writes songs with Phillips; in addition to lead vocals, Momsen also plays rhythm guitar.\n\nThe band's debut album \"Light Me Up\" was released on August 30, 2010 in the UK, where it debuted at number 6, as well as at number 18 in Ireland. The first single \"Make Me Wanna Die\" was released on May 30, 2010, while the second single \"Miss Nothing\" which was released on August 23, 2010 peaked at number 39. \"Just Tonight\" was released as the album's third single. Songs from this album have been in the movie \"Kick-Ass\" as well as shows like \"The Vampire Diaries\" and \"Gossip Girl\".\n\nTelevision personality Heidi Montag recorded \"Blackout\", a song written by Momsen. According to Momsen, she wrote the song when she was 8 years old and recorded it as a demo with a producer. Montag released the song as a digital only single, with the music video being directed by her husband Spencer Pratt. Momsen commented about the recording: \"I'm like, okay, dude, you're singing an 8-year-old's words, but that's cool. It's so funny because I didn't shop it or anything and I get this call going, 'Did you write a song for Heidi Montag'? And I'm like, 'What?'\" The track was later included on Montag's debut studio album \"Superficial\" (2010).\n\nOn July 27, 2011, Momsen announced that the band would be the supporting act for Evanescence during the fall of 2011. Throughout 2012, Momsen and her band toured North America; the second headlining tour, titled the Medicine Tour, began in March 2012 and culminated with supporting dates for Marilyn Manson's 2012 world tour Hey Cruel World... Tour. Momsen also appeared as guest vocalist on the first track of ex Ministry member Paul Barker's 2012 album \"Fix This\".\n\nOn November 30, 2012, it was announced that the Pretty Reckless' fourth single \"Kill Me\" would be released on December 11. The track was the last song to be featured in the \"Gossip Girl\" series finale.\n\nMomsen cites Kurt Cobain, Chris Cornell, the Beatles, Led Zeppelin, the Who, Pink Floyd, AC/DC, Marilyn Manson, Oasis, and Shirley Manson of Garbage as some of her personal influences.\n\n\"Going to Hell\" was released on March 18, 2014. The release marked the band's largest sales week to date and landed at #5 on the Billboard 200 with over 35,000 copies sold in its first week. The success of the record saw Taylor, along with the rest of the band, break records when they became the first female-fronted band to reach No. 1 on the rock radio charts with its first two singles: \"Heaven Knows\" in March 2014 and \"Fucked Up World\" in September 2014. The Pretty Reckless also spent the majority of late 2013 throughout 2014 on tour supporting \"Going To Hell\". In 2014, her band also supported Fall Out Boy in their European leg of the Save Rock n Roll Tour along with New Politics.\n\nThroughout 2015, Momsen continued to record new material for the third Pretty Reckless album. On September 29, 2016, the band released the single \"Take Me Down\", which reached number two on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Chart. The third album, \"Who You Selling For,\" was released in October 2016.\n\n"}
{"id": "1941165", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1941165", "title": "Birmingham Fire", "text": "Birmingham Fire\n\nThe Birmingham Fire were a professional American football team based in Birmingham, Alabama. They were a member of the North American West of the World League of American Football (WLAF) and played their home games at Legion Field. The club was a charter member of the WLAF, and was under the ownership of Gavin Maloof. Led by head coach Chan Gailey, the Fire saw moderate success as they compiled an overall record of twelve wins, nine losses and one tie (12–9–1) and made the playoffs in both seasons they competed. The franchise folded in September 1992 when the NFL placed the league on an indefinite hiatus.\n\nIn June 1989, WLAF president Tex Schramm and other league officials met with Birmingham leaders to discuss the possibility of fielding a team at Legion Field. At that time Schramm stated the Birmingham was under consideration for a franchise based on its past support of the Americans/Vulcans of the World Football League and the Stallions of the United States Football League. The following July, the National Football League (NFL) owners voted to approve the formation of the WLAF in an effort to expand the sport outside of the United States. At the time of the announcement the league was envisioned to have twelve teams with London, Frankfurt, Barcelona, Milan, New York City, Montreal, Mexico City and Northern California as being already selected for franchises. Birmingham was identified as a contender for one of the final four franchises along with Nashville, San Antonio and Orlando.\n\nOn April 18, 1990, Birmingham became the second city in the United States officially awarded a franchise after the Orlando Thunder to compete in the inaugural WLAF season. At the time of the announcement, Schramm reiterated past support for professional football in Birmingham was a major reason for its selection for a franchise. A group headed by former Houston Rockets president Gavin Maloof was revealed as owners of the Birmingham franchise in November 1990. At that time the league reaffirmed it would begin play in March 1991 with ten teams, and that Birmingham would compete as a member of the North American West division with the Sacramento Surge and the San Antonio Riders. On December 6, Michael Huyghue was introduced as general manager, and at the time of his being hired, he was the first African American general manager of a professional football team. On December 21, 1990, Chan Gailey was introduced as the first head coach of the Fire.\n\nIn February 1991, the WLAF held its inaugural draft, and unlike the NFL Draft, the WLAF version was carried out with individual positions being drafted over a period of several days. Offensive linemen were drafted on February 14; running backs, punters and placekickers on February 16; quarterbacks, wide receivers and tight ends on February 18; defensive linemen on February 20; linebackers on February 22; and defensive backs on February 24. The most notable player drafted by the Fire was when they selected Brent Pease with the first overall selection in the quarterbacks draft. Training camp started shortly thereafter, and in mid-March the Fire lost to San Antonio in a controlled scrimmage at San Marcos, Texas.\n\nThe Fire played their first game on March 23 against the Montreal Machine at Legion Field. Although they lost 20–5, an attendance of over 53,000 resulted in the start of the game being delayed 21 minutes to allow fans into the stadium as only two gates were open at the time. The next week, the Fire won their first game against the Sacramento Surge. The 17–10 win only drew 16,000 spectators, but the featured a 99-yard interception return for a touchdown by John Miller. The team then alternated pairs of wins and losses over their remaining eight regular season games. The first pair of losses came on the road against Montreal and at home against the London Monarchs. In their first all-time road game, Birmingham lost to the Machine 23–10 before 27,766 fans at Olympic Stadium. One week later, they suffered their only shutout of the season in their 27–0 loss against eventual World Bowl champion London. Birmingham then rebounded with a 31–6 road win at the Orlando Thunder and a 16–12 with at home against San Antonio to even their overall record at 3–3.\n\nThe Fire then lost both of the games played in Europe, and as a result their record dropped to 3–5. The first loss came against the Barcelona Dragons in an 11–6 defeat and against the Frankfurt Galaxy in their 10–3 loss at the Waldstadion. In their final home game of the season, Birmingham defeated the New York/New Jersey Knights 24–14 to put the team in contention for the last playoff spot as they entered the final week of the regular season. In their regular season finale the Fire defeated the Raleigh–Durham Skyhawks 28–7, and clinched a spot in the first WLAF playoffs as the winners of the North American West division with a 5–5 record. In the WLAF semifinals, Birmingham lost for the second time in the season to Barcelona 10–3 at Legion Field to finish their inaugural season with a final record of 5–6.\n\nIn the buildup to their playoff game in the months that followed, the Fire started their effort to host World Bowl '92 at Legion Field. In the formal request for the event, team ownership indicated they were willing to undertake a $12 million renovation of the facility that would increase the seating capacity from 72,000 to 80,000, add luxury skyboxes and a giant TV scoreboard. Ultimately the league awarded the game to Montreal in December 1991. Michael Huyghue resigned as general manager on June 20 to take a position in the WLAF front office.\n\nIn December 1991, Rick Nichols was hired from the Houston Oilers to serve as general manager of the Fire. In February 1992, the league held its second annual draft and Birmingham made 29 selection during its two days. In addition to those players drafted, an additional six players were allocated to the Fire from NFL teams that retained their overall rights. By March, the team was again in training camp, but this season had an official preseason game to play against the London Monarchs. In this game, the Fire lost 14–13, and in a first in professional sports the loss could be utilized as a potential tiebreaker in order to determine playoff eligibility.\n\nThe Fire opened the season for the second consecutive season with a loss in their opening game, and on the road at Sacramento, Birmingham lost 20–6. They then rebounded by going undefeated over the four games that followed. After a 17–10 victory in their home opener against San Antonio, Birmingham earned their first all-time win in Europe with a 17–7 win at Frankfurt. The next week, Birmingham tied London 17–17 at Wembley Stadium. The draw was both the first in the history of the World League, and remained as the only one until Berlin and Hamburg battled to a 17–17 tie as part of NFL Europe in 2006. The Fire returned from Europe and defeated Sacramento 28–14 in a rematch of their week one matchup. In week six, Birmingham lost 17–10 on the road to division rival San Antonio before they ended the regular season on a four-game winning streak.\n\nAgainst Barcelona, the Fire withstood a fourth quarter comeback and defeated the Dragons for the first time in franchise history 19–7. The next week, Birmingham defeated Montreal for the first time and also won their first overtime game with their 23–16 victory over the Machine. A failed two-point conversion gave the Fire a 24–23 victory over Orlando and a comeback, 27–24 victory at the Ohio Glory in the final game of the season allowed Birmingham to qualify for the playoffs as a wild card. In their semifinals appearance, numerous turnovers resulted in a 45–7 defeat at Orlando to finish the season with a record of 7–3–1.\n\nIn August 1992, Maloof sold the franchise back to the league. At that time league officials asked former Green Bay Packers quarterback Bart Starr to help find a new ownership group in Alabama. On September 17, 1992, the NFL decided to place the WLAF on an indefinite hiatus. The owners stated that the decision was made to shutter the league at that time in an effort to save money to settle potential class action lawsuits brought about by players in the wake of Plan B free agency being declared illegal. The NFL stated that when the league was reestablished it would be focused on European markets with no more than one or two teams envisioned for play in the United States.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the franchise, several of its former coaches and front office personnel moved onto other endeavors. Chan Gailey was named the head coach at Samford University in January 1992 to replace the departed Terry Bowden. When he left to re-enter the NFL after only one season with the Bulldogs, he was replaced by former Fire offensive line coach Pete Hurt. Gailey went on to become the head coach of the Dallas Cowboys, Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets and the Buffalo Bills. Former owner Gavin Maloof joined his brother in the late 1990s to become owners of the National Basketball Association's Sacramento Kings.\n\nIn 1995 World League returned after a two-year hiatus, and the Fire nickname was resurrected in Düsseldorf, Germany as the Rhein Fire. Professional football returned to Birmingham in 1995 when the Canadian Football League (CFL) awarded what became the Birmingham Barracudas as part of their CFL USA expansion. The Barracudas only played the one season and folded, and Birmingham's next football team, the XFL's Birmingham Thunderbolts, met the same fate. In 2019, Birmingham served as the home of the now defunct AAF's Birmingham Iron.\n\n"}

Over the next few years, artists Dann Peer, Gord Heins, John Dymond, and Eric Mahar filled in for the band. In 1989 the Mercey Brothers disbanded; they were inducted into the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame that same year.\n\nIn 1973, The Mercey Brothers opened their own recording studio called Mercey Brothers Recording Studio. That gave them more control over their music and general sound of the band. Their studio was in Elmira, Ontario between 1973 and 1980. They also started their own Record Label, MBS (Mercey Brothers Sound) during this period. MBS signed on names such as Terry Carisse, Marie Bottrell and Joan Kennedy.\n\n"}

The Command Centre set was used for the second time, having previously appeared in the first episode of the season. It had been introduced as a new set for the third season as an area on the \"Enterprise\" where the crew would plan their next move in the mission against the Xindi. A new set was created for the brig, where the Osaarian Orgoth was held prisoner. One day of filming was on sets to represent the Osaarian base, with the majority of those made up using green screens that would allow the sets to be digitally inserted in post production.\n\nJulia Rose made her debut as MACO Corporal McKenzie, having beaten between 25 and 40 other actors to get the part. The spacesuit costume that she wore in the episode was reused, having been created originally for the 2003 Paramount Pictures film \"The Core\" where it was worn by Hilary Swank. Rose had been a fan of Bakula from his time on \"Quantum Leap\" and described him as the \"Dad\" on set. Nathan Anderson returned as Sergeant Kemper for the second time. Robert Rusler, who appeared as Orgoth, had previously appeared in the cast of the second season of \"Babylon 5\" as Warren Keffer. \"Anomaly\" was the fifth episode to be directed by David Straiton.\n\n\"Anomaly\" was first aired in the United States on UPN on September 17, 2003. According to Nielsen Media Research, it received a 2.6/5 percent share among adults. This means that it was seen by 2.6 percent of all households, and 5 percent of all of those watching television at the time of the broadcast. It was estimated that \"Anomaly\" was watched by 4.29 million viewers, which was the highest since \"\" in February 2003 was watched by 4.62 million and the fourth highest of 2003 so far.\n\nMichelle Erica Green, writing for TrekNation, compared the actions of Archer in this episode to those of Kathryn Janeway in the second part of the \"\" episode \"\", but felt that here it came across as \"callous and horrific\". She felt that Archer's actions were typical of a \"Hollywood fantasy (or nightmare) post-9/11 leader\" but thought that they were realistic. She also praised other elements such as the special effects such as the derelict ship, calling it \"creepy, vivid, [and] entirely believable.\" Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website \"Jammer's Reviews\", called the episode \"proof that action-centric \"Trek\" can indeed work, and work well.\" He thought it was a vast improvement on the previous episode and found the stronger version of Archer interesting. He praised the soundtrack by Jay Chattaway which he felt suggested that the typical \"Star Trek\" music was being revised. He gave the episode a score of three and a half out of four.\n\nThe first home media release of \"Anomaly\" was as part of the season three DVD box set, released in the United States on September 27, 2005. The Blu-ray release of the third season of \"Enterprise\" took place on January 7, 2014.\n\n"}

The team played at Alamo Stadium in San Antonio in 1991 and then were forced to move to Bobcat Stadium on the campus of Southwest Texas State University (now Texas State University) in San Marcos, Texas, northeast of San Antonio, for the 1992 season after the San Antonio Independent School District refused to allow the sale of beer at WLAF games or the display of beer advertising at Alamo Stadium. In return, Riders ownership scrapped plans to fund $235,000 in renovations to the Stadium. In June 1991, SAISD officials announced plans for a rent increase on the Riders for the 1992 season. The relationship would last for only one season.\n\nThe team was owned by Larry Benson, the brother of Tom Benson (owner of the New Orleans Saints of the NFL). The general managers were Tom Landry (Pro Football Hall of Fame coach) and Tom Landry, Jr. The head coach for both seasons was Mike Riley.\n\nThe team's record in 1991 was 4-6. San Antonio turned things around in 1992 with a mark of 7-3. The Riders were not able to compete in the highly competitive North American West Division during the 1992 season, and like the Frankfurt Galaxy of 1991, they did not make the playoffs despite a 7-3 record.\n\nFormer players include professional wrestler John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield, better known as JBL of World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), Jason Garrett who not only went on to play for and serve as current head coach for the Dallas Cowboys, and head coach Mike Riley, who went on to coach the San Diego Chargers of the NFL.\n\nAfter the 1992 season saw the suspension of the WLAF (and ultimately the abandonment of North American teams), Benson applied to the Canadian Football League to have the Riders join that league instead for the 1993 season.

{"id": "1941189", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1941189", "title": "KARR (Knight Rider)", "text": "KARR (Knight Rider)\n\nKARR (Knight Automated Roving Robot) is the name of a fictional, automated, prototype vehicle featured as a major antagonist of KITT, in two episodes of the television series \"Knight Rider\", and was part of a multi-episode story arc in the 2008 revived series.\n\nKARR (voiced by Peter Cullen, later Paul Frees) is the prototype version of KITT, originally designed by Wilton Knight and built by his company Knight Industries. Upon completion of the vehicle, KARR's CPU was installed and activated. However, a programming error made the computer unstable and potentially dangerous. The project was put on hold and KARR was placed in storage until a solution could be found.\n\nUnlike KITT, whose primary directive is to protect human life, KARR was programmed for self-preservation, making him a ruthless and unpredictable threat. He does not appear as streetwise as KITT, being very naive and inexperienced and having a childlike perception of the world. This has occasionally allowed people to take advantage of his remarkable capabilities for their own gain; however, due to his ruthless nature he sometimes uses people's weaknesses and greed as a way to manipulate them for his own goals. Despite this, he does ultimately consider himself superior (always referring to KITT as \"the inferior production line model\") as well as unstoppable, and due to his programming the villains don't usually get very far. KARR demonstrates a complete lack of respect or loyalty – on one occasion ejecting his passenger to reduce weight and increase his chances of escape.\n\nKARR first appeared in the Season One episode \"Trust Doesn't Rust\" aired on NBC on November 19, 1982, where he seemingly met his demise at the end. However, he was so popular with viewers that he was brought back again in the Season Three episode \"K.I.T.T. vs. K.A.R.R.\", for a second time which aired on NBC on November 4, 1984 and then brought back in 2009 for \"Knight to King's Pawn\" in season 1 of the new \"Knight Rider\" series of 2008–2009 for a third time (marking him as one of the very few villains in the original series and the new series to make a return appearance).\n\nOnce KITT was constructed, it was presumed that his prototype KARR (voiced by Peter Cullen) had been deactivated and dismantled. However, the latter did not occur and KARR was placed in storage and forgotten following the death of Wilton Knight. When two thieves, Tony (Michael MacRae) and The Rev (William Sanderson), break into the warehouse where KARR – who is entirely identical to KITT with the exception of the Yellow/Green Voice Module on his dashboard – is \"sleeping\", they unwittingly reactivate him, and he escapes.\n\nWhen the two thieves realize how useful the vehicle could be, they use KARR to go on a crime spree, whilst Michael and KITT frantically try to catch up with KARR and stop him before anyone is seriously hurt. Bonnie devises a high-powered laser, the only known way to stop KARR, which must be fired from KITT directly into KARR's scanner. However, when KARR needs maintenance, Tony kidnaps Bonnie before the laser can fully be calibrated. Although Michael rescues Bonnie, she is unable to get a clear shot at KARR with the laser and he escapes.\n\nKARR's only weakness is his primary directive of self-preservation and Michael uses this to his advantage. When KARR threatens to destroy KITT in a head-on collision, Michael plays chicken with him, on a hunch that KARR will veer out of KITT's path in order to protect himself. KARR indeed swerves out of the way, but unable to stop in time: he drives off a cliff and seemingly explodes in the ocean (using footage of the climactic scene from the 1977 film \"The Car\", footage that was also used for KITT on a couple of other occasions).\n\n\"Trust Doesn't Rust\" was also printed in book form, written by Roger Hill and Glen A. Larson, following the story and general script of the original television episode, expanding some areas of the plot and adding several extra secondary characters.\n\nKARR (now voiced by Paul Frees) was only believed to have been destroyed. He was damaged and ended up buried in the sand on the beach below the cliffs. When the tide had gone out, a young couple, John and Mandy, stumble upon the partially buried car, dig him out, and reactivate him. This time, KARR is furious and has only one clear motive: revenge against Michael and KITT.\n\nKARR is still damaged after the last encounter with KITT and forces John to serve as his driver, and also to carry out some cosmetic modifications to his paintwork in a ravine in order to differ entirely from KITT. KARR challenges Michael and KITT to a final showdown. After releasing the young couple, KARR fires a stolen laser and damages KITT. However, Michael and KITT destroy KARR's laser by reflecting the beam back to the emitter. Damaged, KARR prepares for another attack. KITT and KARR both turbo boost and collide in mid-air. KARR is blown to pieces, but Michael and KITT survive the impact. At the end of the episode, however, KARR's motherboard — i.e. KARR himself — can be seen lying undamaged on the ground amongst the wreckage, its LED's still blinking – suggesting to the viewer that KARR is still \"alive\".\n\nOriginally, KARR appeared entirely identical to KITT (all black with a red scan bar), with the only physical difference being a greenish-yellow LED voice modulator on his dash (for the first half of the first season, KITT's voice modulator is a red square that blinks on and off as he talks; KARR's voice modulator is the prototype to the one seen on KITT from the mid first season onwards, after it was received well by viewers) and the only other difference being the evil voice. When KARR returns in \"K.I.T.T. vs. K.A.R.R.\", KARR's scan bar is now amber/yellow and is now very similar to KITT, and is still 100% black like KITT for the first half of the episode.\n\nKARR later gets a brand new black and silver two-tone paint job incorporating a silver lower body into his familiar 100% all-black finish. KARR's scanner originally made a low droning noise, but in the comeback episode it sounds similar to KITT's but with a slight reverb audio effect added to it. The sound of KARR's engine, originally sounding rough and \"fierce\", here sounds similar to KITT's, again effected by a reverb. In \"Trust Doesn't Rust,\" KARR had no license plates. In KARR's second appearance, he had a California license plate that read \"KARR.\" Despite various other changes, KARR's dashboard remains correct with continuity – he still has the earlier version of the dashboard as previously seen on KITT in season 1–2, whereas by the time of 'KITT Vs KARR', Bonnie had updated all of KITT's dash and various functions at the start of the third season.\n\nKARR's evil personality is also somewhat different in the comeback episode. His childlike perceptions are diminished into a more devious personality, completely cold and bent on revenge. His self-preservation directive is no longer in play. When KARR is close to exploding after receiving severe damage; he willingly turbo-jumps into a mid-air collision with KITT, hoping that his own destruction would also spell his counterpart's. Even KARR's modus operandi is different; serviceful enough in the first episode, he aims to actually make use of other people, anyone, to serve his own needs. One explanation of this change could be as a result of the damage he received after falling over the cliff at the end of \"Trust Doesn't Rust\", causing further malfunctions in his programming. Indeed, KITT himself is seen to malfunction and suffer change of personality as a result of damage in several other episodes.\n\nIn \"Trust Doesn't Rust\" and the 2008–2009 series Episode Knight to King's Pawn , the voice of KARR was provided by voice actor Peter Cullen. Cullen is better known as the voice of Optimus Prime in both the G1 \"Transformers\" cartoon series plus Transformers Prime TV Series, and had had a previous working relationship with series creator Glen A. Larson after voicing several Cylon characters in the original \"Battlestar Galactica\". In \"K.I.T.T. vs K.A.R.R.\", KARR was voiced by late legendary voice actor Paul Frees, known as the voice of Boris Badenov in the popular series \"The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show\" and the voice of Ludwig Von Drake in the popular anthology series, \"Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color\" as well as being the original voice of Ghost Host in the Haunted Mansion ride at Disneyland. Like William Daniels, the voice of KITT, who was never credited on-screen, Frees was also uncredited on-screen for his role.\n\nKARR 2.0 (Peter Cullen) is mentioned in the new \"Knight Rider\" series episode \"Knight of the Living Dead\", and is said to be a prototype of KITT (Knight Industries \"Three\" Thousand). The new KARR acronym was changed to \"Knight Auto-cybernetic Roving Robotic-exoskeleton\". Instead of an automobile, a schematic display shows a heavily armed humanoid-looking robot with wheeled legs that converts into an ambiguous off-road vehicle.\n\nIn the episode, a spy infiltrates the SSC and activates a self-destruct program within KITT, placed there secretly by Dr. Graiman. In order to save KITT's operating system (which is given priority over his memories), Michael and Sarah transmit the files to the back-up computer at the headquarters, but the transmission is also intercepted by an unknown third party. It is stated that KITT, KARR and the base back-up computer are the only systems able to run the program, and leaves Dr. Graiman with only one conclusion: KARR 2.0 is still out there, and someone is trying to reactivate him.\n\nWhen KARR finally appears in the episode \"Knight to King's Pawn\", he takes a form once again similar to KITT as a 2008 Ford Shelby Mustang GT500KR, but has a yellow scanner and 100% yellow color voice module and is once again 100% All Black like KITT. once again Similar to the original character, this entirely different \"KARR\" project (2.0) had an AI that was programmed for self-preservation, and he was deactivated and placed in storage after he reprogrammed himself and killed seven people.\n\nKARR returns in the episode \"Knight to King's Pawn\", with Peter Cullen reprising his vocal role using his Optimus Prime/Nemesis Prime Voice from Transformers. A pre-recorded message from Dr. Graiman reveals that Mike was KARR's driver and his memories were erased after KARR became uncontrollable. He says that he knew of and opposed Alex Torres and the NSA's plans to reactivate KARR, as they wrongfully believe KITT's artificial intelligence will overwrite KARR's programming flaws. During the dismantling of the SSC (FLAG's control centre), KITT's A.I. chip is removed and delivered by Torres to the NSA, where it is installed into KARR. Mike vows to end this once and for all, and infiltrates Area 51 to rescue KITT, using another chip built by Billy. KARR activates himself, viewing the re-activated KITT as a threat that must be terminated. Alex states that he is now in charge and KARR must take his orders; KARR agrees, but then merges Alex with him as a driver to seek out Mike.\n\nKARR seems to believe that it is his destiny to merge with Mike as before, and comes after KITT to destroy him and get Mike back. Despite KITT lacking his transformation protocols and weapons, Mike takes him into battle anyway. Using a grappling hook, Mike and KITT pull out KARR's chest plate, freeing Alex, and Turbo Boost through his body, destroying him in a manner similar to the destruction of KARR in the original series. Given the short nature of the battle and the ambiguity of KARR's fate, it is possible that the new KARR might return yet again, although in the following episode entitled \"Exit Light, Enter Knight\" Mike is told that the KARR project has been permanently abandoned.\n\nKARR is once again similar to KITT, also a 2009 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500KR based on the Knight 3000 and is once again 100% all Black like KITT The main difference is that KARR has a yellow scanner (in the original series it was more amber/yellow) and the scanner noise is lower in sound with more of an echo. The sound difference is especially notable when KITT is racing toward KARR while KARR is still in Mustang mode and KARR's Voice Module originally Yellow/Green is now 100% Yellow Color.\n\nIn \"Knight of the Living Dead\" a schematic display shows KARR as a heavily armed humanoid-looking robot with wheeled legs that converts into an ambiguous off-road vehicle, but when KARR returns in 2009 for his third appearance in Knight to King's Pawn he is once again similar to KITT and is once again 100% all Black like KITT. KARR is now a 2009 Ford Mustang GT 500 KR, like KITT 3000; the only difference is that he has a Yellow Scan Light Bar. In the original series it was more Amber/Yellow, and KARR's voice module originally yellow-green in the original series. It is now 100% Yellow Color and KARR's Scanner sounds much lower with much more of an echo. The sound is especially noticeable when KARR is chasing down KITT while he is still in Ford Mustang Mode. Peter Cullen reprised his role as the voice of KARR in the 2009 Knight Rider episode, \"Knight to King's Pawn.\"\n\nKARR is in both \"\" and its sequel. In the first one he is teamed with Garthe Knight, but at the end of the game is caught in an explosion and falls into the sea. In the second he is again teamed with Garthe; however, KITT damages his systems and drives him into a fire. In the sequel, he is once again teamed with Garthe, as he didn't abandon him like the Foundation did. Garthe outfitted KARR with new weapons and copied his processor for an army of robotic enemies, culminating in a rocket armed with a laser that could kill thousands. KARR also appears in the \"Knight Rider\" World in \"Lego Dimensions\", with his mission involving finding him while he's hiding.\n\nMattel has released two die-cast metal models of KARR. A 1:18 scale model as part of the Hot Wheels Elite collection and a 1:64 scale model as part of the Hot Wheels Retro Nostalgia Entertainment collection. They both resemble KARR's appearance from \"KITT vs. KARR\" with silver paint around the bottom half of the vehicle. The small one however lacks the amber scanner light and instead retains the red scanner from KARR's appearance in \"Trust Doesn't Rust\" and there is also a KITT which is completely identical to KARR in his first episode in \"Trust Doesn't Rust\".\n\n"}

{"id": "1941218", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1941218", "title": "Battle of Picacho Pass", "text": "Battle of Picacho Pass\n\nThe Battle of Picacho Pass or the Battle of Picacho Peak was an engagement of the American Civil War on April 15, 1862. The action occurred around Picacho Peak, northwest of Tucson, Arizona. It was fought between a Union cavalry patrol from California and a party of Confederate pickets from Tucson, and marks the westernmost battle of the American Civil War.\n\nAfter a Confederate force of about 120 cavalrymen arrived at Tucson from Texas on February 28, 1862, they proclaimed Tucson the capital of the western district of the Confederate Arizona Territory, which comprised what is now southern Arizona and southern New Mexico. Mesilla, near Las Cruces, was declared the territorial capital and seat of the eastern district of the territory. The property of Tucson Unionists was confiscated and they were jailed or driven out of town. Confederates hoped a flood of sympathizers in southern California would join them and give the Confederacy an outlet on the Pacific Ocean, but this never happened. California Unionists were eager to prevent this, and 2,000 Union volunteers from California, known as the California Column and led by Colonel James Henry Carleton, moved east to Fort Yuma, California, and by May 1862 had driven the small Confederate force back into Texas.\n\nLike most of the Civil War era engagements in Arizona (Dragoon Springs, Stanwix Station and Apache Pass) Picacho Pass occurred near remount stations along the former Butterfield Overland Stagecoach route, which opened in 1859 and ceased operations when the war began. This skirmish occurred about a mile northwest of Picacho Pass Station.\n\nTwelve Union cavalry troopers and one scout (reported to be mountain man Pauline Weaver but in reality Tucson resident John W. Jones), commanded by Lieutenant James Barrett of the 1st California Cavalry, were conducting a sweep of the Picacho Peak area, looking for Confederates reported to be nearby. The Arizona Confederates were commanded by Sergeant Henry Holmes. Barrett was under orders not to engage them, but to wait for the main column to come up. However, \"Lt. Barrett acting alone rather than in concert, surprised the Rebels and should have captured them without firing a shot, if the thing had been conducted properly.\" Instead, in midafternoon the lieutenant \"led his men into the thicket single file without dismounting them. The first fire from the enemy emptied four saddles, when the enemy retired farther into the dense thicket and had time to reload. ... Barrett followed them, calling on his men to follow him.\" Three of the Confederates surrendered. Barrett secured one of the prisoners and had just remounted his horse when a bullet struck him in the neck, killing him. Fierce and confused fighting continued among the mesquite and arroyos for 90 minutes, with two more Union fatalities and three troopers wounded. Exhausted and leaderless, the Californians broke off the fight and the Arizona Rangers, minus three who surrendered, mounted and carried warning of the approaching Union army to Tucson. Barrett's disobedience of orders had cost him his life and lost any chance of a Union surprise attack on Tucson.\n\nThe Union troops retreated to the Pima Indian Villages and hastily built Fort Barrett (named for the fallen officer) at White's Mill, waiting to gather resources to continue the advance. However, with no Confederate reinforcements available, Captain Sherod Hunter and his men withdrew as soon as the column again advanced. The Union troops entered Tucson without any opposition.\n\nThe bodies of the two Union enlisted men killed at Picacho (George Johnson and William S Leonard) were later removed to the National Cemetery at the Presidio of San Francisco in San Francisco, California. However, Lieutenant Barrett's grave, near the present railroad tracks, remains undisturbed and unmarked. Union reports claimed that two Confederates were wounded in the fight, but Captain Hunter in his official report mentioned no Confederate casualties other than the three men captured.\n\nBefore this engagement a Confederate cavalry patrol had advanced as far west as Stanwix Station, where it was burning the hay stored there when it was attacked by a patrol of the California Column. The Confederates had been burning hay stored at the stage stations in order to delay the Union advance from California. About the same time as the skirmish at Picacho Peak, a larger force of Confederates was thwarted in its attempt to advance northward from Santa Fe, New Mexico, in the Battle of Glorieta Pass. By July the Confederates had retreated to Texas, though pro-Confederate militia units operated in some areas until mid-1863. The following year, the Union organized its own territory of Arizona, dividing New Mexico along the state's current north-south border, extending control southward from the provisional capital of Prescott. Although the encounter at Picacho Pass was only a minor event in the Civil War, it can be considered the high-water mark of the Confederate West.\nEvery March, Picacho Peak State Park hosts a re-enactment of the Civil War battles of Arizona and New Mexico, including the battle of Picacho Pass. The re-enactments now have grown so large that many more participants tend to be involved than took part in the actual engagements, and include infantry units and artillery as well as cavalry. The 2015 re-enactment, which was held March 22 and 23, also included re-enactments of the Battle of Valverde and the Battle of Glorieta Pass, both of which took place in relatively nearby New Mexico.\n\n"}

{"id": "1941240", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1941240", "title": "Ain't I a Woman?", "text": "Ain't I a Woman?\n\n\"Ain't I a Woman?\" is a speech, delivered extemporaneously, by Sojourner Truth, (1797–1883), born into slavery in New York State. Some time after gaining her freedom in 1827, she became a well known anti-slavery speaker. Her speech was delivered at the Women's Convention in Akron, Ohio, on May 29, 1851, and did not originally have a title.\n\nThe speech was briefly reported in two contemporary newspapers, and a transcript of the speech was published in the \"Anti-Slavery Bugle\" on June 21, 1851. It received wider publicity in 1863 during the American Civil War when Frances Dana Barker Gage published a different version, one which became known as Ain't I a Woman? because of its oft-repeated question. This later, better known and more widely available version has been the one referenced by most historians.\n\nThe phrase \"Am I not a man and a brother?\" had been used by British abolitionists since the late 18th century to decry the inhumanity of slavery. This male motto was first turned female in the 1820s by British abolitionists, then in 1830 the American abolitionist newspaper \"Genius of Universal Emancipation\" carried an image of a slave woman asking \"Am I not a woman and a sister?\" This image was widely republished in the 1830s, and struck into a copper coin or token, but without the question mark, to give the question a positive answer. In 1833, African American activist Maria W. Stewart used the words of this motto to argue for the rights of women of every race. Historian Jean Fagan Yellin argued in 1989 that this motto served as inspiration for Sojourner Truth, who was well aware of the great difference in the level of oppression of white versus black women. Truth was asserting both her gender and race by asking the crowd, \"Am I not a woman?\"\nThe first reports of the speech were published by the \"New York Tribune\" on June 6, 1851, and by \"The Liberator\" five days later. Both of these accounts were brief, lacking a full transcription. The first complete transcription was published on June 21 in the \"Anti-Slavery Bugle\" by Marius Robinson, an abolitionist and newspaper editor who acted as the convention's recording secretary. The question \"Ain't I a Woman\" does not appear in his account.\n\nTwelve years later, in May 1863, Frances Dana Barker Gage published a very different transcription. In it, she gave Truth many of the speech characteristics of Southern slaves, and she included new material that Robinson had not reported. Gage's version of the speech was republished in 1875, 1881, and 1889, and became the historic standard. This version is known as \"Ain't I a Woman?\" after its oft-repeated refrain. Truth's style of speech was not like that of Southern slaves; she was born and raised in New York, and spoke only Dutch until she was nine years old.\n\nAdditions that Gage made to Truth's speech include the ideas that she could bear the lash as well as a man, that no one ever offered her the traditional gentlemanly deference due a woman, and that most of her 13 children were sold away from her into slavery. Truth is widely believed to have had five children, with one sold away, and was never known to claim more children. Further inaccuracies in Gage's 1863 account conflict with her own contemporary report: Gage wrote in 1851 that Akron in general and the press in particular were largely friendly to the woman's rights convention, but in 1863 she wrote that the convention leaders were fearful of the \"mobbish\" opponents. Other eyewitness reports of Truth's speech told a different story, one where all faces were \"beaming with joyous gladness\" at the session where Truth spoke; that not \"one discordant note\" interrupted the harmony of the proceedings. In contrast to Gage's later version, Truth was warmly received by the convention-goers, the majority of whom were long-standing abolitionists, friendly to progressive ideas of race and civil rights.\n\nMarius Robinson, who attended the convention and worked with Truth, printed the speech as he transcribed it in the June 21, 1851, issue of the \"Anti-Slavery Bugle\".\n\nThe speech was recalled 12 years after the fact by Gage, an activist in the woman's rights and abolition movements. Gage, who presided at the meeting, described the event:\n\nThe following is the speech as Gage recalled it in \"History of Woman Suffrage\" which was, according to her, in the original dialect as it was presented by Sojourner Truth:\n\nGage described the result: \nAmid roars of applause, she returned to her corner, leaving more than one of us with streaming eyes, and hearts beating with gratitude. She had taken us up in her strong arms and carried us safely over the slough of difficulty turning the whole tide in our favor. I have never in my life seen anything like the magical influence that subdued the mobbish spirit of the day, and turned the sneers and jeers of an excited crowd into notes of respect and admiration. Hundreds rushed up to shake hands with her, and congratulate the glorious old mother, and bid her God-speed on her mission of 'testifyin' agin concerning the wickedness of this 'ere people.'\n\nThere is no single, undisputed official version of Truth's speech. Robinson and Truth were friends who had worked together concerning both abolition of slavery and women's rights, and his report is strictly his recollection with no added commentary. Since Robinson's version was published in the \"Anti-Slavery Bugle\", the audience is largely concerned with the rights of African Americans rather than women; it is possible Robinson's version is framed for his audience. Although Truth collaborated with Robinson on the transcription of her speech, Truth did not dictate his writing word for word.\nThe historically accepted standard version of the speech was written by Gage, but there are no reports of Gage working with Truth on the transcription. Gage portrays Truth as using a Southern dialect, which the earliest reports of the speech do not mention. Truth is said to have prided herself on her spoken English, and she was born and raised in New York state, speaking only Jersey Dutch until the age of 9. The dialect in Gage's 1863 version is less severe than in her later version of the speech that she published in 1881. The rearticulation in the different published versions of Gage's writings serve as the metonymic transfiguration of Truth. In addition, the crowd Truth addressed that day consisted of mainly white, privileged women. In Gage's recollection, she describes that the crowd did not want Truth to speak because they did not want people to confuse the cause of suffrage with abolition, despite many reports that Truth was welcomed with respect. Although Gage's version provides further context, it is written as a narrative: she adds her own commentary, creating an entire scene of the event, including the audience reactions. Because Gage's version is built primarily on her interpretation and the way she chose to portray it, it cannot be considered a pure representation of the event.\n\nSojourner Truth's \"Ain't I a Woman\" is a critique of single axis analysis of domination, and how an analysis that ignores interlocking identities prevents liberation. Scholars Avtar Brah and Ann Phoenix discuss how Truth's speech can be read as an intersectional critique of homogenous activist organizations. Truth's speech at the convention \"deconstructs every single major truth-claim about gender in a patriarchal slave social formation\", as it asks the audience to see how their expectations of gender have been played out within her lived experience. Brah and Phoenix write,\n\n\"Sojourner Truth's identity claims are thus relational, constructed in relation to white women and all men and clearly demonstrate that what we call 'identities' are not objects but processes constituted in and through power relations.\"\n\nTruth's speech gives insight in how black women face domination under slavery, and that the domination they faced was specific because of their blackness and their womaness together, and that by treating the two as separate entities limits the liberatory potential of any coalition unified against domination. Truth challenges the audience to confront their understanding of domination by placing her lived experience as an enslaved black woman at the foreground of her politics, and specifically how she is both black and a woman.\n\n\n"}

The stadium was built in 2002 and holds 6,016 people. It is the home of the Joliet Slammers.\n\nIn December 2010, the Joliet Jackhammers were sold to Steel City Baseball LLC. As a result of the details of the sale, mainly pertaining to the non-payment of outstanding debts, the Joliet Jackhammers ceased operations. Steel City Baseball LLC renamed and rebranded the franchise as the Joliet Slammers, in theme of the old Joliet prison as well as a grand slam in the sport of baseball.\n\nDuPage Medical Group Field has two levels; the main level and a second level of suites. The main seating area runs from first to third base and there are about 20 rows. There is a general admission lawn area. There are no outfield seats, but there is a large picnic pavilion area beyond the left field wall. There is a concourse that goes completely around the field, but the concourse in right field is behind the fence and one cannot see the field from this area. After installation of artificial turf, the left field fence moved back to a distance of . This was one of the main adjustments made in the facility's US$1.6 million 2018 improvement plan, along with mostly repairs to stadium infrastructure. Since the 2018 renovations, there has only been one soccer tournament held and no lacrosse matches to date. Joliet Slammers Vice President of Marketing and Sales John Wilson has stated that the reason for lack of expanded sporting use is the high demand for baseball to be played on the field.\n\nThe ballpark's former name was Silver Cross Field, with the naming rights belonging to Silver Cross Hospital. In November 2017, the City of Joliet announced their plan for rename the facility Joliet Route 66 Stadium, which included a new facade showcasing the area's automotive history centered around U.S. Route 66.\n\nThe city of Joliet owns the land and stadium. The city splits the naming rights revenue with the Joliet Slammers.\n\nDuPage Medical Group Field also plays host to the University of St. Francis baseball team as well as local high school baseball games and competitions. It is the site of the annual 3A and 4A IHSA State Final Baseball Tournament that happens every summer. The Joliet Slammers, being the primary tenant, rent out the field to any teams that would like to play in a professional stadium. The facility also hosts several youth baseball leagues in the area as well certain special events, such as the annual Joliet Police Department vs. Joliet Fire Department rivalry nicknamed \"Guns and Hoses\".\n\nThe facility was slated to play host to a rock concert named the Joliet Slammers Fest on August 10, 2019, but plans fell through when concerns about damaging the newly-installed artificial turf arose. Bands such as Everclear, Bowling for Soup, and Alien Ant Farm, among others, were slated to perform at what was supposed to be the first concert ever held at the stadium. Joliet Slammers management has remained verbally open to the possibility of hosting concert events in the future if proper safety measures can be taken to protect the turf surface. The facility also hosted a wedding in the summer of 2019. Joliet Slammers Director of Tournaments and Special Events Cori Herbert said he estimates that about 425 events were held at DuPage Medical Group Field in 2019 alone.\n\n"}

The university offers programs at both baccalaureate and graduate levels in a range of fields. Arkansas Tech welcomed its first doctoral cohorts in the Summer of 2015. The Arkansas Tech University–Ozark Campus, a two-year satellite campus in the town of Ozark, primarily focuses on associate and certificate education.\n\nThe Second District Agricultural School was created by Act 100 of 1909 of the Arkansas General Assembly. It was decided on February 10, 1910, to found the school in Russellville. On October 26, 1910, the first classes were held in Russellville. The original purpose of the school was to offer classes leading to a high school degree. Later on, the school took on the first two years of college instruction, and the school's name was changed to Arkansas Polytechnic College by the General Assembly in 1925 to reflect this change in purpose. At this time, the course work leading to a high school diploma was phased out and in 1931, Tech formally only offered courses leading to a college degree.\n\nThe school took on its current name of Arkansas Tech University on July 9, 1976.\n\nIn the fall of 2003, Arkansas Tech University announced it intended to overtake the state vocational school, Arkansas Valley Technical Institute, in Ozark, the seat of Franklin County. As of July 1, 2004, the Ozark campus has acted as a satellite campus of Arkansas Tech and has begun offering coursework leading toward an Associate of Applied Science degree in various subjects.\n\nOn Oct. 23, 2013, Jerry the Bulldog was adopted as Arkansas Tech's campus ambassador after a 76-year absence from the school.\n\nFrom 1997 to 2015, enrollment at Arkansas Tech has increased by 183 percent. The fall of 2015 marked the 17th consecutive year that Arkansas Tech has established a new institutional record for largest enrollment at 12,054 students, also officially making ATU the 3rd largest institution of higher learning in the state of Arkansas.\n\nArkansas Tech has invested $180 million in upgrades to its infrastructure since 1995 and the university has added more than 40 new academic programs of study under the leadership of Robert C. Brown, who has served as president of Arkansas Tech since 1993. In April, 2014, Dr. Robin E. Bowen was unanimously selected by the university trustees selected to succeed Dr. Brown; when she took office on 1 July 2014, she became the first woman to lead a four-year, public Arkansas university.\n\nSeveral Tech buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArkansas Tech participates in NCAA Division II athletics as a charter member of the Great American Conference. Tech was a member of the Gulf South Conference from 1995 to 2011. Previously, Tech was a member of the Arkansas Intercollegiate Conference in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics. The university fields four men's and six women's varsity sports, as well as a club sports program:\n\n\n\n\nArkansas Tech University has dual nicknames: men's athletic teams are called the Wonder Boys, while the women's teams are called the Golden Suns.\n\nOn November 15, 1919, John Tucker, a 17-year-old freshman from Russellville, scored two touchdowns and kicks two extra points to lead the Second District Agricultural School Aggies to a 14–0 upset win over Jonesboro. In newspaper accounts following the game, Tucker and his teammates were referred to as \"Wonder Boys,\" and the nickname remains to this day. Tucker was labeled as \"The Original Wonder Boy\" and was associated with the school for the rest of his life. He went on to play on the University of Alabama's Rose Bowl team in 1931 and served Arkansas Tech in a variety of roles – including coach, athletic director and chemistry professor – between 1925 and 1972. Two buildings on the Tech campus – Tucker Coliseum and Tucker Hall – are named in his honor.\n\nTired of being referred to as the Wonder Girls or Wonderettes, the female athletes of Arkansas Tech held a contest in the spring of 1975 to determine what their new mascot would be. Several names were nominated, but in the end, the athletes selected Golden Suns as their new nickname.\n\n\n\n"}

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba as a Progressive Conservative from 1958 to 1959, and was a cabinet minister in the government of Dufferin Roblin.\n\nBoulic born at Altamont, Manitoba, and was educated at St. Boniface College. He was elected as a school trustee in 1940, and served in this position for three years. He was later a councillor, and then the reeve of Notre-Dame-de-Lourdes. Boulic was initially a farmer in private life, and later operated a creamery.\n\nBoulic first for the Manitoba legislature in a by-election held on June 27, 1955. He agreed to run as the Progressive Conservative candidate in Mountain after meeting with Dufferin Roblin, who had been chosen as the party's leader the previous year. Roblin has said of their first meeting that Boulic struck him as \"a man in his forties, open-faced, well set-up, of diffident manner, but clearly a leader\", adding \"[h]is politics were in doubt but I got know him just the same. When the by-election came, I had my man\".\n\nOn election day, Boulic lost to Liberal-Progressive candidate Walter Clark by 276 votes. Notwithstanding his defeat, Boulic's showing was considered both impressive and significant. Mountain had been considered one of the safest Liberal-Progressive seats in the province, and the Conservatives had not even fielded a candidate in the division since 1932. Several prominent Liberal-Progressives campaigned on Clark's behalf, and senior party members were reported as being concerned with the close result. Roblin wrote that Boulic, in defeat, \"[laid] the foundations for victory in 1958\".\n\nNewspaper reports indicate that Clark's support came largely from Mountain's Anglo-Saxon majority and significant Flemish community, while Boulic did well among French Canadians, who made up about one third of the electorate.\n\nBoulic was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1958 provincial election, defeating incumbent Liberal-Progressive Samuel Burch by 512 votes in the redistributed constituency of Cypress. The Progressive Conservatives under Roblin won a minority government in this election, and Boulic was appointed as Provincial Secretary on June 30, 1958. He was the only Franco-Manitoban in Roblin's cabinet.\n\nHe was re-elected in the 1959 provincial election with an increased majority. The Progressive Conservatives won a majority government in this cycle, and Boulic retained his cabinet position.\n\nBoulic died of a heart attack a few months after the election, at his home in St. Boniface. The \"Winnipeg Free Press\" wrote that his death \"remove[d] from public life in Manitoba one of its most personable young men,\" describing Boulic as having wide knowledge of municipal affairs, a \"contagious French Canadian sense of humour\" and \"rich personal charm.\" The paper added that he had not served long enough as Provincial Secretary to make a strong impact in the position.\n\nAt the time of Boulic's death, Dufferin Roblin described him as a \"pillar of the cabinet and a very dear personal friend.\" He later paid him the following tribute in his memoirs:\n"}
