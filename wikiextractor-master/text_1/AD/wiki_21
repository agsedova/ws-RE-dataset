Rangers tend to be wise, hardy, cunning, and perceptive in addition to being skilled woodsmen. Many are skilled in woodcraft, stealth, wilderness survival, beast-mastery, herbalism, tracking, and sometimes \"nature magic\" or have a resistance to magic. Rangers spend a great deal of time hunting, fishing, and camping—whether on a short- or long-term basis—and their preferred martial arts weapons leans towards practical-utility: archery, knife fighting, stick-fighting, axeplay, spearplay and swordplay.\n\nRangers skills in books and games can include and are not limited to:\n\n\nIn \"Dungeons & Dragons\", rangers typically worship a nature god or goddess, and they take a role similar to druids by protecting nature and slaying foul creatures. Rangers gain offensive bonuses against certain creatures through the choosing of a \"Favored Enemy\" (such as giants, dragons or undead). Exploration is what rangers specialize in. They may also gain defensive bonuses within certain terrains through the choosing of a \"Favored Environment\" (such as Desert, Forest or Urban) that stacks with their \"Favored Enemy\"; this further illustrates their cunning. In addition, rangers have access to divine magic and an animal companion to aid them in battle.\n\nRangers tend to prefer the company of fellow rangers, and they are extensively trained. However, good rangers will often act as the guardians of others - whether appreciated or not - by repelling \"evil\" forces and protecting the weak.\n\nSome noteworthy fictional rangers are Drizzt Do'Urden and Hank in the \"Dungeons and Dragons\" animated television series.\n\nRangers have appeared as in various \"Final Fantasy\" games, including the MMORPG \"Final Fantasy XI\". Rangers have also appeared in one form or another in other Final Fantasy games often called Archer or Hunter. In \"Final Fantasy Tactics Advance\" Hunter is an upgraded class of the basic class, Archer.\nRangers in \"Guild Wars\" are sleek looking individuals who primarily use bows, but can select a secondary profession that allows them to use their weapon skills with limited effectiveness. \nIn Guild Wars 2 characters cannot select a secondary profession, but each profession has a wide variety of weapons available for their use with both melee and ranged options. Rangers favor bows and throwing axes for ranged attacks, and swords and greatswords for melee. \nIn both games, rangers can tame pets and command them in battle, summon nature spirits, set traps, use a variety of combat skills to avoid attacks and survive in battle, and use powerful marksmanship skills. Rangers wear medium armor (higher than Scholar classes, lower than Soldier classes). \n\nIn the competitive modes of the original \"Guild Wars\", player versus player rangers are known for their survivability and effectiveness as solo characters, often acting separately from the rest of the team, reflecting the hardy and cunning nature of a ranger. \nIn Guild Wars 2, rangers are known as proficient snipers that take enemies down from a long distance, and durable skirmishers that can evade attacks while counterattacking. Subsequent expansions to Guild Wars 2 added the Druid specialization (focusing on healing and player buffs) and the Soulbeast specialization (merging with their animal companion to boost their own capabilities).\n\nIn lore, the way rangers live varies from race to race. Human Rangers will be found ranging a forest to guard them against dangers like forests and poachers, and typically worship Melandru, the Goddess of Earth and Nature. Norn Rangers are more likely be hunters and trappers that follow Wolf, the Spirit of the Wild that favors loyalty and cooperation. Charr rangers are often in charge in taming beasts to be used in war for tasks such as transporting cargo, watching, scouting or even full on battle. Sylvari rangers are usually those given a 'wyld hunt' (a lifelong call given before birth) about preserving nature or that are fascinated by the wild. Asura rangers are rare, and they are usually field researches that prefer the wild over being cooped up in a lab.\n\nRangers in\" Dark Age of Camelot\" are an archer class in the realm of Hibernia. The races of Elves, Lurikeen, Celt, and Shar may become rangers. The differ from the archer class of the other realms in that they wield two weapons instead of a sword and shield, or a large spear. The weapon of choice for a Dark Age of Camelot Ranger is the Recurve Bow. Unlike the Albion Scout, they can employ spells to augment themselves. Like all archers, they are adept at stealth.\n\nIn \"Fire Emblem\", units of the Archer class can wield only bows, allowing them to attack most enemy units without receiving a counterattack, but at the same time preventing them from counterattacking enemies who manage to close to melee range. Hunter is a similar class with lower defensive stats, but the ability to move through forest terrain without being slowed. The Hunter's promoted form Horseman is a cavalry unit which can equip both swords and bows, making them extremely flexible; in addition they usually lack some of the normal weaknesses of mounted units, such as vulnerability to anti-cavalry weapons and inability to pass through rough terrain. In some games the Horseman class is instead known as Ranger, and can be promoted from both Mercenary (a balanced class specialising in two-handed swords) and Archer.\n\nIn \"\" the protagonist Ike's initial class is named Ranger, but is otherwise identical to the Mercenary class described above.\n\nThe rangers in \"Heroes of Might and Magic\" were a ranged class (their special class ability was a slight bonus to their ranged skills). However, they were notable for not having any connection to nature, only to pathfinding, and for being an advanced class of either the barbarian or the thief (neither of which normally become rangers).\n\nAlthough there are not definitive classes in \"RuneScape\", Rangers are characters who have decided to invest most of their resources in the Ranged skill and its associated equipment, increasing their ability with bows, crossbows, throwing knives, and all of the game's ranged weapons. They have none of the association to nature and animals common in other milieux, being primarily a distance attacker, though certain items allow usage of poisons. RuneScape Rangers use lighter, leather armour, placing their defensive ability somewhere between the low-armour magical classes and the high-armour melee classes. During PVP they are known to wear heavy armour helmets and leggings if their defence level allows it. A Ranger may also invest in the Mage skill so that they may use restricting spells that can hold the opponent in place while the caster uses ranged attacks from a safe distance.\n\nIn \"Maplestory\", the ranger is a third advancement from the bowman base class. Rangers specialize in bows and rapid attacks in contrast to their cousin, the sniper, who specializes with crossbows and power. Although there is not a clear affinity for nature, both Rangers and Snipers can summon a silver hawk and golden eagle respectively, that can aid their caller in battle by stunning a nearby monster.\n\n\"Ranger\" is a character class in \"NetHack\". Rangers can become skilled or expert with many thrown or fired weapons such as spears, arrows and bows and daggers. Rangers enjoy the ability to be able to skillfully cast \"Divination\" spells that help them discover monsters, identify objects, map areas, etc. Orcs, Elves, Gnomes and Humans can play ranger, the alignments available to this class are neutral and chaotic.\n\n\"Ranger\" is a Class in the role-playing game \"Dragonfable\". Zhoom, the master Ranger, is the main NPC in the town the Sandsea. You must complete Zhoom's Quest, The Hard Way, to unlock the armor. The Rangers of DragonFable are described by Zhoom as moving from place to place and calling no one place home. All Rangers have different codes of honor, but they live and die by that code. Zhoom also states that, \"Rangers serve no king.\" Rangers have an affinity for nature as well, and each have an animal that they consider a partner and seen to share a spiritual connection with. Zhoom has a PrideLord named Zixcy, but he teaches the player character Falconry after the player completes the Hudson's Hawk Quest.\n\nIn order to Level Up this class, the player needs to give Zhoom three Ancient Treasures, which can be obtained by completing various Quests throughout the Sandsea. The Class armor consists of leather armor, leather boots, and leather gloves with cloth pants. It carries a bow and arrows, a knife, and the player's equipped weapon, which is displayed hanging from the waist of the armor. While the Ranger's default attack is Melee, most of its attacking Skills involve Ranged damage. Its Skills involve enchanting arrows to cause flashbang and poison effects, using multiple arrows to attack, and using multi-hit attacks that can involve both Melee and Ranged attacks.\n\nIn \"Scions of Fate\" the Ranger is a slow attacking warrior that uses arrows to attack from far distances. He has relatively low health and defence ability. However he has a very high dodging ability and attack power.\nThe class is not actually called \"Ranger\". The cycle goes Novice Bowman - Bowman - Silent Strider - Swift Ranger. This class can only be accessed if the Order Faction is selected.\n\nIn \"EverQuest\", the Ranger of Norrath is a cousin of the Druid, though one that specialises in melee as opposed to magical combat. They are usually referred to as Guardians or Wardens of Nature and many have similar beliefs and principles to Druids; though as their equipment often requires repairs and periodic replacing Rangers tend to be more comfortable socially than their spell casting counterpart. They do still have a similar ability to call upon spirits (of nature) and unseen forces but it is much more limited in its power, as such they are extensively trained in many weapon types and combat abilities, usually to a far greater level of proficiency than any Druid would be expected to reach.\n\nA Rangers combat training focuses on offensive skills, with the defensive side left to an individuals cunning and agility. Many of a Rangers spells can either be used at a distance or allow the Ranger to fight outside their opponents range, archery is one of a Rangers primary weapon skills and when mastered becomes one of the most powerful weapons available to them. Rangers can also slow movement, 'root' a target to the ground and when fighting animals make them flee in fear. They gain some of the Druid 'blast' spells and can transform into a wolf when they reach the required level of power.\n\nWhile defensively limited, a Ranger does have some defensive boons including the capability to wear chain armour. Their armour class and hit points can be magically raised and they can cast a shield which harms their opponent when they strike the Ranger. In addition Rangers can reduce aggression and 'lull' creatures enough that they wouldn't attack when approached, giving enough distraction to pick groups of them off one by one. Along with the best tracking ability of any profession this means Rangers are often considered the masters of hunting, commonly taking responsibility for scouting ahead or choosing suitable 'prey' for a party.\n\nA \"Hunter\" is the \"World of Warcraft\" equivalent of a Ranger class that has an animal companion and may employ either ranged weaponry or a melee spear. Most specifically, the \"Survival Hunter\" specialization tree is specified in its in-game description as a Ranger.\n\nRangers are a Scout Class in the live action role-playing game, the Vorydian Chronicles. They are more combat oriented than the other two Scout Classes (Rogue and Spy) in order to better survive the wilderness on one's own. Rangers are specialize in wooded environments, able to slip past animals and carnivorous plants unnoticed, track, camouflage one's self, and they are given the ability to dual-wield swords, in addition to the existing Scout Fighting Styles. Their combat skills are generally centered on Marksman (archery and thrown weapons) and gladiator (dual-swords), and they receive fighting style proficiencies, as well as Expert Flanking proficiencies. Defensively, Rangers receive Vaea boosts to their hit points, as well as a threshold soak, up to two chosen element types to take minimal from, and immunity to a poison of choice. At the highest common rank, a Ranger may receive a Spirit Animal. Rangers may achieve any one of the Exemplar lists: Stalker, Ghost, Sniper, or Bounty Hunter.\n\n\"Ranger's Apprentice\", a young adult fantasy book series based in medieval times, revolves around Rangers. They are the \"police\" of the country and widely feared. Normal people consider them sorcerers of the black arts, but the rangers of Rangers Apprentice do not associate with magic. There are fifty active rangers in the Ranger corps and all of them are skilled bowmen, trackers, knife fighters and throwers, and are masters in unseen and unheard movements. Only one ranger in the corps, Gilan, knows how to fight with a sword. Every ranger, and any apprentice to a ranger, has their own horse. The horse they have is specially bred and trained to travel for long distances at fast speeds. These horses all have a sort of \"password\" needed to ride. If a person attempts to ride on the horse and they do not know the password then the horse throws them off. This word is only needed to be spoken into the horse's ear the first time someone attempts to ride. Each certified ranger is required to protect and deal with trouble and laws in their fief, which is similar to a state. The series bases itself around a young orphan named Will who becomes apprentice to a high ranking ranger named Halt. By book five Will completes his apprenticeship and is a certified ranger and is called upon to go on missions. Most of the time on these missions he is accompanied with Horace, a knight who grew up with Will in the orphanage, and Halt.\n"}

He was sometimes credited as Robert Stewart early in his career. Banks Stewart contributed extensively to drama for the BBC and ITV for several decades, which included creating and producing the series \"Shoestring\" (1979) and \"Bergerac\" (1981). He also produced and co-adapted \"The Darling Buds of May\" (1991). \n\nBorn in Edinburgh, he began writing as a journalist, working for the city's evening newspapers, where he became the youngest news editor in history for the \"Evening Dispatch\". Even then, he used to discuss ideas for television series. Later he became a story editor at Pinewood Studios. Working as a scriptwriter from the end of the 1950s, he worked on such TV series as \"Danger Man\", \"The Human Jungle\", \"Top Secret\" and \"The Avengers\" (\"The Master Minds\" and \"Quick-Quick Slow Death\"). He also contributed a few scripts to the \"Edgar Wallace Mysteries\" series of second features for the cinema.\n\nWorking for Thames Television he contributed scripts to the programmes \"Callan\", \"Special Branch\", \"The Sweeney\" and \"Owner Occupied\". For HTV, he wrote five episodes of \"Arthur of the Britons\". Banks Stewart wrote two popular serials for the BBC science-fiction series \"Doctor Who\" when it starred Tom Baker: \"Terror of the Zygons\" (1975) (which was set in his native Scotland and drew on the Loch Ness Monster legend) and \"The Seeds of Doom\" (1976) (which was influenced by classic science-fiction such as \"The Day of the Triffids\", \"The Quatermass Experiment\" and \"The Thing from Another World\"). A third story, \"The Foe from the Future\", was considered but ultimately cancelled as Stewart became unavailable, but elements were reworked into \"The Talons of Weng-Chiang\" and an audio adaptation of the story was released in 2012 by Big Finish Productions.\n\nBanks Stewart continued working in television as a writer, script editor and producer, creating \"Shoestring\" (1979–80), which ran for two series on the BBC and following this up with the Jersey-set detective drama series \"Bergerac\" (1981–91).

It was originally envisaged as a two-part TV series, but Banks Stewart said he decided to turn it into a novel after \"getting nowhere\" with TV executives, which he attributed to ageism. His memoir of working in the television industry, \"To Put You in the Picture\", was published in 2015.\n\nOn 14 January 2016, Robert Banks Stewart died of cancer at the age of 84.\n"}

They also disappointed with an 8-8 tie in Guam, but still finished second in their group of four teams thanks to beating Malaysia 48-12. However, as only the top team in the group qualified for the next stage, India were out. Their current record in IRB-recognised internationals is ten wins, one tie, and twenty four losses.\n\nThe national side is ranked 86th in the world (as of 29 July 2019).\n\nRugby Union in India dates back to a scratch match or two played in Kolkata and Madras during the visit of MS Galatea in 1871. The first recorded match was played on Christmas Day 1872, at CFC in Kolkata, it was played between England and a combined team of Scotland, Ireland and Wales.\n\nThe national team was not started till 1998 however when the India national team played Singapore in Singapore, they lost 85-0. The team were then admitted into the International Rugby Board in 2001 and then in 2003 the team undertook its first UK tour. This consisted of playing three sides from the Midlands which all resulted in large defeats, including a staggering 153-0 defeat from a Leicester Tigers XV at Welford Road. They also failed to score a single try during their visit. Despite the sheer lack of success, the head did have some positive words, stating: \"It's all a learning process for us. The difference in size and body weight between the two teams was huge, but when we get back to Asia we'll be playing against teams roughly our own size.\" In 2007 India attempted to qualify for the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France, Scotland, and Wales. They were placed in Asian Division 3, Pool B for the qualifiers in which India finished second of four teams with 1 win, 1 tie, and 1 loss. As only the first place team moved on to the second qualification round India was officially knocked out of the 2007 World Cup.\n\nIn 2008 the India Rugby Union Team attempted to qualify for the Rugby World Cup again. This time though qualification was different as instead of the group stage India had to play in the 2008 Asian Five Nations and win it in order to move on to Round 2 in qualification. India though lost their first match against Thailand and had to settle for 3rd place after a 2nd place match win against Pakistan in which India achieved their biggest ever victory as they beat Pakistan 92–0.\n\nIndia does not have its own personal stadium to use. When they play they usually do on local university fields throughout India.\n\nIndia have worn dark blue and black for all of their Rugby Union games since 2011 and prior to that, from 1998–2010, they used the traditional Indian sports colours of light blue and white. At present, the shirt and socks are dark blue and the shorts are black.\n\nIndia competes annually in the Asia Rugby Championship, which is a rugby union competition held amongst national rugby sides within the Asia Rugby region. India participated in the inaugural 2008 Asian Five Nations (as it was then known) competing in the Second Division, finishing in third place, and missing out on being promoted. During the 2009 Asian Five Nations India again finished in 3rd place in the Second Division but then during the 2010 Asian Five Nations India just lost out on promotion to Division 1 when they were beaten 34-12 by the Philippines in the final game. They then suffered a setback in 2011 Asian Five Nations as they were relegated to Division 3 after losing both their matches in Second Division tournament. In 2012 India were successful in winning the Third Division tournament earning a promotion back to Division 2 the following year. In 2013 they finished fourth in the Second Division tournament, relegating them back to the third division. In 2014 the Division 3 tournament was split into an East and West competition, with four teams in each. India finished in fourth place in the Division 3 West tournament. In 2015 the Division 3 tournament was split into three brackets, East, West and Central, with three teams in each. India competed in the Central tournament, however due to the withdrawal of Pakistan the remaining teams India and Uzbekistan played two matches against each other. As both team scored respective victories India was declared the winner on points difference. In 2016 the Division 3 tournament was split into four competitions, East, Central, West and West-Central. India plays in the South-Central bracket where it is scheduled to compete against Pakistan. \n\nIndia has never played in the Rugby World Cup but they have attempted twice in 2005 and 2008 to qualify for the 2007 Rugby World Cup and 2011 Rugby World Cups respectively.\n\nTheir Test match record against all nations, updated to 8 June 2013, is as follows:\n\nSquad to 2019 Asia Rugby Championship \n"}

He was born in Hattiesburg, Mississippi.\n\nGathright attended Bonnabel High School in Kenner, Louisiana, where he played baseball & Football as a junior and boxed. He was drafted by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in the 32nd round of the 2001 Major League Baseball Draft, and signed in August after playing that summer in a Louisiana Sugar Cane League in Sorrento, Louisiana.\n\nHe made his major league debut with the Devil Rays on June 25, 2004.\n\nGathright was arguably one of the fastest players in major league baseball when he made his major league debut, and led all major league outfielders in range factor (3.06) in 2006. He does not hit for power (with only one home run in his MLB career). From 2006 to 2009, he had the lowest slugging average of players with at least 1000 plate appearances at .298. He has a .263 lifetime batting average going into the 2009 season.\n\nGathright was clocked at 6.1 seconds in the 60-yard dash. While in high school, he jumped over his coach's car. That jumping ability proved useful on the field, as in a 2008 spring training game Gathright jumped over Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Hiroki Kuroda, who was trying to tag him out en route to first base.\n\nIn 2005, he hit .276 in 76 games, and drew 10 walks.\n\nOn June 20, 2006, he was traded to the Kansas City Royals, along with infielder Fernando Cortez, for left-handed pitcher J. P. Howell. In the 2006 season, he batted .238 with a .321 on-base percentage, and a .292 slugging percentage. He hit his first, and to date only, home run on September 16, 2006 against Joel Piñeiro of the Seattle Mariners.\n\nIn 2007, Gathright broke up Bobby Jenks's major league record-tying streak of 41 consecutive batters retired. Gathright, who would have been the record 42nd batter, was able to get a hit.\n\nWhile playing center field, his range factor per nine innings was below average in 2007, 2008, and 2009. In 2008 Gathright saw his range factor fall to 2.53, below all but one center field starter in the league. He also hit .254 with a .311 on-base percentage, and only a .272 slugging percentage—below that of all starting outfielders in the major leagues.\n\nGathright, while with the Royals, had a tendency to attempt to bunt for base hits in order to use his superior speed to reach base. However, he proved to be an inconsistent bunter, and thus his on-base percentage and batting average suffered.\n\nOn December 16, 2008, three days after being non-tendered by the Royals, Gathright signed a one-year deal with the Chicago Cubs. and made his debut April 6 against the Houston Astros. In 20 games for the Cubs, he hit .214.\n\nOn May 8, 2009, after clearing waivers and being sent outright to the minors, the Cubs traded Gathright to the Baltimore Orioles for Ryan Freel. The Orioles sent him to the AAA Norfolk Tides, where he hit .329 in 80 games.\n\nOn August 29, 2009, the Boston Red Sox acquired Gathright in exchange for either a player to be named later or cash considerations. He appeared in 17 regular season games, primarily as a pinch runner. He was on the post-season roster, where he made one appearance without an at-bat.\n\nOn December 13, 2009, the Toronto Blue Jays signed Gathright to a minor league contract. However, he was released on March 28, before the start of the season.\n\nOn March 30, 2010, he signed a minor league contract to return to the Orioles. He was released on July 22, 2010 after 61 games with Norfolk, where he hit only .185\n\nOn August 6, 2010, Gathright signed with the Long Island Ducks of the independent Atlantic League. He ended the season hitting .269 with 3 home runs and 19 RBI.\n\nOn April 13, 2011, Gathright signed with the Shreveport-Bossier Captains of the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball. He was released on June 7, 2011 after hitting .190 in 21 games.\n\nHe then signed, on June 10, 2011, with the Yuma Scorpions of the North American League, where he hit .347 in 61 games.\n\nHis performance got him another chance in the Majors and on August 31, 2011, he returned to the Red Sox. He appeared in 7 late season games with the Red Sox, as either a defensive replacement or pinch runner.\n\nHe was signed by the Tigres de Quintana Roo of the Mexican League but later signed with the Bridgeport Bluefish of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball.\n\nOn May 24, the Cincinnati Reds purchased Gathright's contract from the Bridgeport club. He reported to the Louisville Bats, Cincinnati's AAA minor league affiliate.

He designed the external fuselage attachments for the Airwolf helicopter, based on a Bell 222, as well as both versions of the internal Electronic Data Command Center, the show's iconic logotype and wolf insignia, flight suit costumes and other miscellaneous items within Archangel's office. He also story-boarded most of the aerial sequences on the show for the 2nd Unit team during the series' run from 1984-1986.\n\nIn 1984, he worked on \"Back to the Future\", initially drawing storyboards but then continuing the design of the DeLorean time machine that had been started by Ron Cobb.\n\nAlso in 1984, he designed the motorcycle for the pilot episode of \"Street Hawk\", which was later redesigned for the series by Ron Cobb.\n\nIn 1986, he joined the staff of the then new series \"\" where he was initially hired to design the bridge of the new starship, the \"Enterprise\"-D However, after the show's producers saw a speculative Enterprise sketch that Probert had produced he was tasked with designing the starship's exterior as well. During his one season stint on \"The Next Generation\", he also designed the exteriors of virtually every other space vehicle seen in the first year of the show, including the Romulan Warbird.\n\nHis film and television work also includes stints on \"*batteries not included\", \"SpaceCamp\", \"Mask\", \"Tron\" and \"The Philadelphia Experiment\". He also worked four years as a Show Designer at Walt Disney Imagineering.\n\nOn February 6, 2006, Perpetual Entertainment and CBS Media announced that Probert had been employed as an initial design consultant for the first incarnation of the MMOG \"Star Trek Online\".\n\nOn November 21, 2012, Alê Camargo, Brazilian animator and film producer, of Buba Filmes, contacted Probert to work on his new television series \"\". For this, Probert designed the show's main spaceship, both inside and out, and consulted on several additional details during the following three years of production.\n\nIn May 2013, Probert began communicating with Jamie Anderson, son of the late Gerry Anderson of \"Space: 1999\" fame, resulting in Conceptual Consulting on Anderson's first book project: \"GF-1\", written by M.G. Harris, continuing into 2015.\n\nAugust 2018 through July 2019, Probert was asked to return to Buba Filmes and upgrade the look of the show's hero spaceship, new spacesuits, shuttlecraft, & more, for a Motion Picture version of their 2017 Fujiwara Manchester TV series titled: \"Mundo Proibido\" (Forbidden World).\n\nProbert continues to design for film and television productions and makes an occasional appearance at various media-related conventions. \n"}

His father, Tiger Fafara, and his late uncle, Stanley Fafara, were child actors on the \"Leave It to Beaver\" television sitcom.\nFafara's wife is named Anahstasia, and she appears on the cover of the second Coal Chamber album \"Chamber Music\". Fafara has three sons: Tyler, Simon and Kaleb. \"Tyler's Song\", from the album \"Chamber Music\", was written for Tyler. Simon, age nine at the time, added backing growls on DevilDriver's third album, \"The Last Kind Words\" (2007), on the song \"Tirades Of Truth\", during the last two lines of the chorus.\n\nHe has suffered from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder his whole life.\nFafara adopted the nickname \"Dez\" in honor of Dez Cadena, vocalist and guitarist for Black Flag and an early influence on Fafara.\n\nHe is a vegan. He expresses disgust towards animals that are being used for food and feels that people are starting to view plant-based foods as \"good for your body, good for the environment.\" Fafara also said that going vegan made a substantial improvement on his health.\n\nFafara released a total of 5 albums with Coal Chamber. Four of the albums, \"Coal Chamber\" (1997), which went gold, \"Chamber Music\" (1999), and \"Dark Days\" (2002), consisted of new material. An album of remixes, rarities, and b-sides, titled \"Giving the Devil His Due\" (2003) and a \"Best Of\" (2004) were also released. Coal Chamber disbanded in 2003, shortly after Fafara formed his current band DevilDriver.\n\nOn September 26, 2011, it was announced that Coal Chamber would reunite for Australia's Soundwave Festival, which took place in early 2012. As of October 2012, according to Fafara, new material from Coal Chamber is in the works.\n\nCoal Chamber participated in a tour with Sevendust and Stolen Babies in early Spring of 2013.\n\nAccording to Fafara, the fourth album was completed in December 2014 before its release in 2015. Coal Chamber now is disbanded and last consisted of the three founding members; Fafara, Miguel Rascon and Mikey Cox, with bassist Nadja Peulen rejoining the band in 2013, having originally played with Coal Chamber in 1999 and 2002.

Its highest point is currently 56 metres below the surface.\nSpartel Bank is one of the several seamounts in the bed of Gibraltar Strait, similar but deeper seamounts are found at Camarinal Sill and further east. These represent landslide blocks which slid south from the north bank of the Strait of Gibraltar when the strait was formed, possibly through erosion by inflowing waters of the Zanclean flood.\n\nIt vanished under the surface approximately 12,000 years ago due to rising ocean levels from melting ice caps after the last Glacial Maximum.

However, in follow-up correspondence Gutscher indicates that the island could not have been Atlantis, referring to Plato's description of a Bronze Age society, which Spartel could not have supported at the time. A detailed review in the \"Bryn Mawr Classical Review\" comments on the discrepancies in Collina-Girard's dates and use of coincidences, concluding that he \"has certainly succeeded in throwing some light upon some momentous developments in human prehistory in the area west of Gibraltar.

It was launched on 10 July 2005 aboard the M-V rocket on the M-V-6 mission. After its successful launch, the satellite was renamed \"Suzaku\" after the mythical Vermilion bird of the South.\n\nJust weeks after launch, on 29 July 2005 the first of a series of cooling system malfunctions occurred. These ultimately caused the entire reservoir of liquid helium to boil off into space by 8 August 2005. This effectively shut down the X-ray Spectrometer (XRS), which was the spacecraft's primary instrument. The two other instruments, the X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (XIS) and the Hard X-ray Detector (HXD), were unaffected by the malfunction. As a result, another XRS was integrated into the Hitomi X-ray satellite, launched in 2016.\n\nOn 26 August 2015, JAXA announced that communications with \"Suzaku\" had been intermittent since 1 June, and that the resumption of scientific operations would be difficult to accomplish given the spacecraft's condition. Mission operators decided to complete the mission imminently, as \"Suzaku\" had exceeded its design lifespan by eight years at this point. The mission came to an end on 2 September 2015, when JAXA commanded the radio transmitters on \"Suzaku\" to switch themselves off.\n\n\"Suzaku\" carried high spectroscopic resolution, very wide energy band instruments for detecting signals ranging from soft X-rays up to gamma-rays (0.3–600 keV). High resolution spectroscopy and wide-band are essential factors to physically investigate high energy astronomical phenomena, such as black holes and supernovae. One such feature, the broad iron K line, may be key to more direct imaging of black holes.\n\n\n\"Suzaku\" was a replacement for ASTRO-E, which was lost in a launch failure. The M-V carrier rocket on the M-V-4 mission launched on 10 February 2000 at 01:30:00 UTC but experienced a failure 42 seconds later, failing to achieve orbit and crashing with its payload into the ocean.\n\nSuzaku discovered \"fossil\" light from a supernova remnant.\n\n\n"}

The coin was minted in 1794 and 1795; its size and weight were based on the Spanish dollar, which was popular in trade throughout the Americas.\n\nIn 1791, following a study by Alexander Hamilton, Congress passed a joint resolution calling for the establishment of a national mint. Later that year, in his third State of the Union address, President George Washington urged Congress to provide for a mint, which was officially authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. Despite the authorization, silver and gold coins were not struck until 1794. The Flowing Hair dollar, designed by Robert Scot, was initially produced in 1794, and again in 1795. In October 1795 the design was replaced by the Draped Bust dollar.\n\nBeginning in the 1780s, a large number of prominent Americans called for the establishment of a central mint to supply the United States with official coinage; all such proposals failed due in large part to lack of funds and opposition from individuals and groups who preferred that coins be struck by the individual states. Since there were no federal coins issued, the needs of the states were fulfilled by a variety of domestic and foreign coins and tokens, including Spanish eight-\"real\" coins (popularly known as Spanish dollars or pieces of eight).\n\nIn 1789, the United States Constitution, which granted Congress the power \"to coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures\", was ratified and came into force. The following year, Congress began deliberating on the state of the nation's monetary system and coinage. On January 28, 1791, Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton presented a report to Congress detailing the findings of a study he had conducted on the monetary system and the potential of a United States mint. As part of his study, Hamilton had a series of assay tests of Spanish dollars performed, as that was the coin upon which the United States monetary system would be based. After viewing the results, the secretary recommended that the silver content of the United States dollar be based on the average silver content of the \"reales\" tested. Hamilton's recommendation was that the dollar should contain 371.25 grains of silver and have a gross weight of 416 grains, the balance being copper. On March 3, 1791, after reviewing Hamilton's report, Congress passed a joint resolution authorizing a federal mint; the resolution, however, gave no specifics or appropriations.\n\nIn his third annual address to Congress, later known as the State of the Union address, delivered on October 25, 1791, in Philadelphia, President George Washington urged members of Congress to put the joint resolution approved earlier that year into immediate effect:\n\nIn response, the Senate appointed a committee chaired by Robert Morris to draft the necessary specifications and legislation that would officially create a federal mint and coinage. The committee presented a bill before Congress on December 21, 1791, which stated in part that the new dollar coin (which was to form the basis of the United States monetary system) should contain 371 grains of silver and a total weight of 416 grains, as Hamilton had earlier recommended. The new silver coins were to be struck in an alloy containing 1,485 parts out of 1,664 (about 89.24 percent) fine silver, with the remainder copper, intended to equal the silver in Spanish dollars. However, an assay of the Spanish dollars was in error—they were in fact 65/72 silver (about 90.28 percent) with the remainder copper.\n\nOne provision in Morris' legislation called for President Washington to be depicted on the obverse side of every coin struck by the new mint. The bill passed the Senate after debate, but it was altered in the House of Representatives to instead call for the head of an allegorical figure representing Liberty to appear. Upon returning to the Senate, the upper house insisted on its version of the design provision. The House rejected the provision for the second time and passed another version of the bill, after which the Senate concurred. The law, known as the Coinage Act of 1792, was signed into law on April 2, 1792, by President Washington. The Act provided for the creation of the United States Mint, and appropriated money to meet the cost of construction of an appropriate facility, and for salaries for employees and officials. The denominations sanctioned under the Act were half cents, cents, half dimes, dimes, quarter dollars, half dollars, dollars, quarter eagles, half eagles and eagles. On July 31, 1792, the foundation stone of the Philadelphia Mint was laid by newly appointed Mint Director David Rittenhouse. Machinery and personnel began occupying the new building by September 1792, and production began on cents in February 1793. In the first year of production at the Mint, only copper coins were minted, as the prospective assayer could not raise the required $10,000 surety to officially assume the position; the 1792 Coinage Act stated that both the chief coiner and assayer were to \"become bound to the United States of America, with one or more sureties to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the Treasury, in the sum of ten thousand dollars\". Later that year, Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson appealed to Congress that the amount of the bonds be lowered. On March 3, 1794, Congress lowered the bonds to $5,000 and $1,000 for chief coiner and assayer, respectively.\n\nEarly in 1794, engraver Robert Scot began preparing designs for the silver dollar. Scot's initial design depicted a bust of Liberty, while his reverse featured an eagle, both required by the 1792 Coinage Act. Scot's design closely followed his design for the cent, but with the Phrygian cap removed. Government officials later instructed Scot to include a wreath around the eagle and to move the denomination from the reverse face to the edge of the coin. After receiving approval, Scot began engraving the hubs for the new silver dollar. Extra care was taken during the engraving of this denomination, because the dollar would be the largest American coin, and would thus receive the most scrutiny from foreign nations. The lettering was executed by Frederick Geiger, who had worked as a typographer for various books and newspapers. After the dies were created, several copper test pieces were struck. Officials decided to add fifteen stars around the periphery, representing the fifteen states that had ratified the Constitution to that point, to the right-facing Liberty on the obverse.\n\nNow that mintage of the silver denominations could begin, the Mint began seeking depositors to bring in silver and gold bullion to be coined. After receiving several deposits, assayer Albion Cox notified Rittenhouse of his beliefs that the .892 standard approved for silver coinage was difficult to produce and that it would darken if put into circulation. Instead, Cox recommended that the purity be modified to .900 fine, but also that the weight be kept at 416 grains. This meant that the new alloy was contrary to statute and that all depositors would be overcharged for their silver bullion deposits, as there was a higher silver content in the coins than was allowed by the Coinage Act of 1792. The Mint's action cost suppliers of silver about one percent of their deposit; the largest depositor, John Vaughan, reckoned his loss at $2,260. Congress approved his petition for reimbursement in 1800, after several delays.\n\nBefore the coins could be struck, the edge lettering and devices had to be impressed on the edge of the planchets. This action was performed with a device known as the Castaing machine; the machine stamped the edge with the words \"Hundred Cents One Dollar or Unit\" along with ornamentation. As production was inexact, many planchets intended for silver dollars were overweight. This was remedied by filing the face of the planchets; for this reason, the coins vary in weight more dramatically than later issues, which were minted with more precise equipment.\n\nThe first silver dollars were struck on October 15, 1794. The silver used for the 1794 dollars came solely from silver ingots deposited with the Mint by Mint Director David Rittenhouse on August 22, 1794. Per a handwritten coin transfer warrant issued by Director Rittenhouse on October 15, 1794, 1,758 silver dollars were transferred from the custody of Chief Coiner Henry Voigt to the custody of Mint Treasurer Dr. Nicholas Way. Also on October 15, per a handwritten coin return warrant issued by Director Rittenhouse, the 1,758 silver dollars were transferred from the custody of Mint Treasurer Dr. Nicholas Way to David Rittenhouse, as a partial coin return towards his August 22 silver deposits. The 1,758 coins that were struck by Chief Coiner Henry Voigt, though acceptable, were poorly struck due to issues with the coining press that was used during early production at the Mint. It was a man-powered screw press intended for use on coins no larger than a half dollar.\n\nOn October 16, 1794, after receiving a silver dollar from David Rittenhouse, Secretary of State Edmund Randolph forwarded the dollar coin to President Washington for his inspection. In an attempt to help circulate the coins, Rittenhouse spent many of the new coins and traded them for foreign coins to market the new products of the Mint. Others were distributed to VIPs and distinguished visitors to the Mint. After the initial production, Rittenhouse ordered all dollar coin production to end until Mint personnel could build a more powerful press that would be capable of better striking the coins. The Columbian Centinel (Boston, MA) first wrote an article about the new dollar coins on November 26, 1794: Some of the new dollars now coining at the Mint of the United States have found their way to this town. A correspondent put one in into the editor's hands yesterday. Its weight is equal to that of a Spanish dollar, but the metal appears finer ... The \"tout ensemble\" (entire design) has a pleasing effect to a connoisseur, but the touches of the <nowiki>[en]</nowiki>graver are too delicate, and there is a want of that boldness of execution which is necessary to durability and currency\n\nThe new coinage press was completed in early 1795, and the first group of dollars, totalling 3,810 coins, was delivered on May 6. The coins struck on May 8 may have borne a 1794 date, however there is no document or evidence to support such a statement. A number of 1795 dollars (along with one 1794 issue) are known to have been struck with a silver plug set into the center, measuring approximately . It is believed that this was done to correct the weight of underweight planchets. The total mintage for the second and final year of production is estimated at 160,295. In total, 203,033 silver dollars were struck in 1795, but it is unknown exactly how many of those were of the Flowing Hair type, as the Draped Bust dollar succeeded it in October 1795; the Draped Bust dollar was designed by portraitist Gilbert Stuart at the behest of Rittenhouse's successor as Mint Director, Henry DeSaussure.\n\nThroughout its history, the 1794 dollar has widely been considered one of the rarest and most valuable of all United States coins. In a September 1880 issue of \"The Coin Journal\", the author noted that a good quality specimen of the 1794 dollar was valued at fifty dollars. In the early 1990s, numismatic historian Jack Collins estimated the surviving number of the coins to be between 120 and 130. In 2013, the finest known example, which was among the earliest coins struck and was prepared with special care, was sold at auction for $10,016,875, the highest selling price of any coin in history. The dollar was graded Specimen-66 by the Professional Coin Grading Service, noting the special conditions under which it was struck. The coin, which had previously been owned by Colonel E.H.R. Green, was sold by Stack's Bowers Galleries in a public auction in January 2013. It was previously sold in 2010 for what was then a record sum of $7.85 million, to the Cardinal Collection Educational Foundation. Steven Contursi, a former owner of the coin, said that it was a \"national treasure\" and that he was proud to have been its \"custodian\" from 2003 until its sale in 2010. Martin Logies, representative of the foundation that purchased the coin, said that of all the rarities he had seen, he believed that one was the \"single most important of all\".\n\n\nEPIC\n"}

He finished the year with .167 average (AL and NL stats combined). He refused a minor league assignment on October 12, and became a free agent. He signed a minor-league contract with the Texas Rangers on November 11, 2010, and played the entire 2011 season at their Triple-A affiliate in Round Rock, TX.\n\nOn January 8, 2012, Cash announced his retirement. He was announced as an advance scout for the Blue Jays during the 2012 season.\n\nShortly after the 2012 season ended, Cash joined Terry Francona's staff with the Cleveland Indians as their bullpen coach. Cash played for Terry Francona during his stints with the Red Sox, and joined fellow Red Sox alumnus Brad Mills, who became Cleveland's bench coach. Mills was Terry Francona's bench coach while Cash played for the Red Sox, as well as Cash's manager with the Houston Astros in 2010. While in Cleveland, Cash recommended Yan Gomes to Chris Antonetti, the team's general manager.\n\nOn December 5, 2014, the Tampa Bay Rays hired Cash as their manager, succeeding Joe Maddon. In 2015 he was successful on a lower percentage of replay challenges than any other MLB manager with 10 or more challenges, at 31.5%.\n\nCash is the nephew of former MLB player Ron Cash. He lives with his wife Emily and their three children in Hillsborough County, Florida.\n\n"}

It derives from the Scottish Gaelic \"cuach\" () meaning a cup.\n\nAccording to the 1911 \"Encyclopædia Britannica\", the quaich was inspired by the low silver bowls with two flat handles frequently used as bleeding vessels in England and the Netherlands in the 17th century.\nAnother popular theory suggests that the shape is derived from scallop shells. However, this seems to have had its origins in the poems of James Macpherson which were once thought to be translations of poems by Ossian, son of Fionn mac Cumhaill.\nIn his 1955 monograph \"Some Scottish Quaichs\", Richard L. McCleneahan, an American collector, suggests that the quaich evolved directly from the medieval mazer. This seems unlikely as the form and material (burr maple for mazers) are quite different. There were small stave-built drinking vessels common in the medieval period found around the Baltics and, since some of the earliest quaichs are stave-built, this could be the source.\n\nTraditionally quaichs are made of wood, an artform known as \"treen\". Some early quaichs are stave-built like barrels and some have alternating light and dark staves. The staves are held together by bands of willow or silver. They generally have two, and more rarely three or four, short, projecting handles. Other wooden quaiches were lathe-turned out of a single piece of wood and there was another group which were turned then carved outside in basket-weave pattern. In addition to wood, they are made of stone, brass, pewter, horn, and silver. The latter were often engraved with lines and bands in imitation of the staves and hoops of the wooden quaichs. \n\nThe origin of quaichs in Scotland is traced to the Highlands; it was not until the end of the 17th century that they became popular in such large centres as Edinburgh and Glasgow. The silversmiths of such local guilds as Inverness and Perth frequently mounted them in silver, as may be seen from the hallmarks on the existing examples.\n\nCommemorative quaichs awarded as prizes, or given as gifts, are more commonly made of pewter or silver. These prize cups are rarely used for actual drinking.\n\nRelated vessels to the Scottish quaich include the porringer, a larger vessel typically in diameter with one (US colonial) or two (European) horizontal handles. The Sami and Norrland, Sweden, equivalent is the kuksa, which also only has a single handle.\n\nThe quaich was used for whisky or brandy, and in the 19th century Sir Walter Scott dispensed drams in silver quaichs. One of the quaichs he owned was the Waterloo Tree Quaich. It was made in part from wood Scott had taken from the Waterloo Elm, when he visited the battlefield shortly after the Battle of Waterloo (the elm tree had been the Duke of Wellington's command post for much of the battle). In his collection he also owned some other quaichs made from commemorative wood: one made from Falkland Oak; one made from Queen Mary's yew; and another made from the Wallace Oak. The one he kept for himself was made of wood with seven bands, and had travelled from Edinburgh to Derby with Bonnie Prince Charlie in 1745.\n\nWooden commemorative quaichs designed by Paul Hodgkiss were given as presents to winners at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.\n\n\n\nAttribution:\n\n"}

Nacchio (born June 22, 1949 in Brooklyn, New York) is an American executive who was chairman of the board and chief executive officer of Qwest Communications International from 1997 to 2002. Nacchio was convicted of insider trading during his time heading Qwest. He claimed in court, with documentation, that his was the only company to demand legal authority for surreptitious mass surveillance demanded by the NSA which began prior to the 11 September 2001 attacks.\n\nHe was convicted of 19 counts of insider trading in Qwest stock on April 19, 2007 – charges his defense team claimed were U.S. government retaliation for his refusal to give customer data to the National Security Agency in February, 2001. This defense was not admissible in court because the U.S. Department of Justice filed an \"in limine\" motion, which is often used in national security cases, to exclude information which may reveal state secrets. Information from the Classified Information Procedures Act hearings in Nacchio's case was likewise ruled inadmissible.\n\nOn July 27, 2007, he was sentenced to six years in federal prison, and after appeals failed he reported to Federal Correctional Institution, Schuylkill in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania on April 14, 2009 to serve his sentence. Nacchio finished serving his sentence on September 20, 2013.\n\nHe is the son of a New York City longshoreman and bartender \nand graduated in 1970 from New York University with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering. Later he earned an MBA from New York University and a Master's degree in Management (SM) as a Sloan Fellow from the MIT Sloan School of Management in 1986.\n\nNacchio joined Qwest in 1997 from AT&T Corporation.\n\nWhile Chairman, Nacchio was serving on two federal advisory panels—the Network Reliability and Interoperability Council and the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee. He was Chairman of the latter and was given a top secret security clearance in the late 1990s.\n\nIn 2000, during Nacchio's tenure as Qwest CEO, the company acquired its regional rival US West. In 2002, Qwest admitted to false accounting during the time of the merger.\n\nJoseph P. Nacchio was the only head of a communications company to demand a court order, or approval under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, in order to turn over communications records to the NSA.\n\nAccording to a \"The Washington Post\" report, Nacchio claimed that the National Security Agency had asked Qwest in February 2001 to participate in a surveillance program; Nacchio said that after he declined, the NSA punished Qwest by dropping a contract worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nNacchio had been selling his Qwest stock as early as January.\n\nQwest stock began a sharp decline in May 2001, falling from $38 to below $2 by August 2002. Nacchio resigned from Qwest in June 2002 and was replaced by former Ameritech CEO Richard Notebaert.\n\nOn March 15, 2005, Nacchio and six other former Qwest executives were sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. They were accused of a $3 billion financial fraud between 1999 and 2002 and of benefiting from an inflated stock price.\n\nIn its case, the government stated that Nacchio continued to tell Wall Street that Qwest would be able to achieve aggressive revenue targets long after he knew that they could not be achieved. This helped it buy up regional phone rival US West, the government alleged. For his part, Nacchio maintained that he believed Qwest would soon be receiving several large government contracts. On November 21, 2005, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported that Nacchio \"believed Qwest was doing well because it was getting lucrative secret national-security-related work from the federal government.\" Nacchio claimed that he was not in a rightful state of mind when he sold his shares because of problems with his son, and the imminent announcement of a number of government contracts.\n\nNacchio was indicted on December 20, 2005 on insider trading charges in Denver, Colorado. He was forced to surrender his passport for fear that he would flee the country. The indictment against Nacchio charged him with 42 counts of insider trading. Each count carries a potential 10-year jail term and corresponds to a sale of Qwest shares, including a flurry in April–May 2001, when Nacchio sold almost $39 million in stock. At the time, Qwest was trading between $41.12 and $38.31.\n\nNacchio was convicted on 19 of 42 counts of insider trading case on April 19, 2007. He was released on a $2 million bond. On July 27, 2007, Nacchio was sentenced to six years in federal prison. Federal Judge Edward Nottingham also ordered Nacchio to pay a $19 million fine and forfeit $52 million he gained in illegal stock sales. On March 17, 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit overturned his conviction on the basis of defense expert witness testimony that was improperly excluded, and ordered a new trial before a different trial judge. Herbert J. Stern led Nacchio’s defense team during the initial trial,\nwhile Maureen Mahoney was lead defense attorney during the appeal.\nOn February 25, 2009, the full Tenth Circuit reversed the three-judge panel and reinstated the conviction and sentence.\n\nNacchio surrendered April 14, 2009 to a federal prison camp in Schuylkill, Pennsylvania to begin serving a six-year sentence for the insider trading conviction. The United States Supreme Court denied bail pending appeal the same day. His federal register number is 33973-013.\n\nOn October 5, 2009, the US Supreme Court denied certiorari, letting the conviction stand.\n\nNacchio finished serving his sentence on September 20, 2013.\n\n\n"}

Roger Merrill, and Rebecca R. Merrill. It offers a time management approach that, if established as a habit, is intended to help a person achieve \"effectiveness\" by aligning him- or herself to \"First Things\". The approach is a further development of the approach popularized in Covey's \"The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People\" and other titles.\n\nThe book asserts that there are three generations of time management: first-generation task lists, second-generation personal organizers with deadlines and third-generation values clarification as incorporated in the Franklin Planner. Using the analogy of \"the clock and the compass,\" the authors assert that identifying primary roles and principles provides a \"true north\" and reference when deciding what activities are most important, so that decisions are guided not merely by the \"clock\" of scheduling but by the \"compass\" of purpose and values. Asserting that people have a need \"to live, to love, to learn, and to leave a legacy\" they propose moving beyond \"urgency\" (not the same as the quadrant II in a Cartesian coordinate system).\n\nIn the book, Covey describes a framework for prioritizing work that is aimed at long-term goals, at the expense of tasks that appear to be urgent, but are in fact less important. He uses a time management formulation attributed to Eisenhower (see: The Eisenhower Method), categorizing tasks into whether they are urgent and whether they are important, recognizing that important tasks may not be urgent, and urgent tasks are not necessarily important. This is his 2x2 matrix: classifying tasks as urgent and non-urgent on one axis, and important or non-important on the other axis. His quadrant 2 has the items that are non-urgent but important. These are the ones he believes we are likely to neglect; but, should focus on to achieve effectiveness.\n\nImportant items are identified by focusing on a few key priorities and roles which will vary from person to person, then identifying small goals for each role each week, in order to maintain a holistic life balance. One tool for this is a worksheet that lists up to seven key roles, with three weekly goals per role, to be evaluated and scheduled into each week before other appointments occupy all available time with things that seem urgent but are not important. This concept is illustrated with a story that encourages people to \"place the big rocks first.\"\n\nDelegation is presented as an important part of time management. Successful delegation, according to Covey, focuses on results and benchmarks that are to be agreed in advance, rather than on prescribing detailed work plans.\n"}

In the late 19th century, he became a political ally in the Republican Party of William Madison McDonald, a prominent African-American politician.\n\nAfter his mother's death in 1916 and his inheritance of half her fortune, Green built a mansion in Round Hill, Massachusetts. He was noted for his stamp and coin collections.\n\nEdward Green was the first of two children of Hetty and Edward Henry Green. His sister Harriet Sylvia Ann Howland Green Wilks, called Sylvia, was born in 1871. Their mother amassed a fortune through her business dealings and was known as a miser.\n\nNed broke his leg as a child, and Hetty first tried to have him admitted to a free clinic for the poor. Charles Slack, her biographer, said that she was recognized, she did not agree to pay for the medical services and treated him herself. The boy's leg did not heal properly and had to be amputated due to gangrene. Ned had to use a cork prosthesis. He grew to 6'4\" (1.93 m) and 300 lb. (136 kg) as an adult.\n\nGreen attended private schools, and then graduated from Fordham College in 1888. He later studied real estate law.\n\nIn 1893, Green was assigned by his mother to manage the Texas Midland Railroad, which she had acquired by foreclosure. He went to Terrell, Texas, and turned the ailing enterprise into \"a model railroad boasting the first electrically-lighted coaches in the State.\" This was only one of many business ventures in which Green succeeded.\n\nGreen was also active in state politics. In 1896, he began a long-lasting political partnership with William Madison McDonald, an African-American leader of the Black and Tan faction of the Republican Party from Fort Worth. In 1910, though a Republican, Green was made \"a Colonel on the staff of a Democratic Governor of Texas\".\n\nIn contrast to his mother, Green spent lavishly and partied. He surrounded himself with attractive young women, who were well paid for their services.\n\nIn 1911, Green was interviewed and sketched by Marguerite Martyn of the \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch.\" She said that he was a \"fine, stalwart, upstanding millionaire, middle-aged . . . wholesome and hearty, with a most ingratiating, breezy Western way with him.\" He told her that he received \"thousands of letters\" from women offering to marry him and that \"a secretary had been appointed to take charge of this class of mail.\" Green told Martyn: \"Why, it isn't my \"money\" they want to marry me for. It's \"alimony.\"\"\n\nAs Hetty strongly opposed his marrying, he waited until after her death in 1916 to wed his longtime companion, Mabel E. Harlow, a former prostitute.\n\nHe and his sister Sylvia each inherited half of their mother's fortune of $150 million or more. In addition to the various other homes he already owned, after his mother's death, Green built a mansion in Massachusetts, Round Hill, and another on Star Island. The Round Hill mansion was designed by the Anglo-American architect Alfred C. Bossom and completed in 1921 at a cost of $1.5 million.\n\nHe died of heart disease at Lake Placid, New York, in 1936. In accordance with Green's last request, his widow had his amputated leg exhumed and reunited with the rest of his body.\n\nHis widow and his sister fought over his estate, estimated at the time as $44,384,500 or \"more than $40 million\". Green had persuaded Mabel to sign a prenuptial agreement, which limited her to a $1,500 monthly stipend, but she challenged it in court. She eventually settled for $500,000.\n\nFour states, Texas, Massachusetts, Florida and New York, fought over who would collect $6 million in inheritance taxes. The United States Supreme Court awarded the money to Massachusetts.\n\nGreen is known to philatelists for forming one of the great collections of postage stamps of the early 20th century, exceeded in size and value only by that of King George V. In 1918, he purchased the sheet of Inverted Jenny stamps from the dealer Eugene Klein for $20,000. On Klein's advice, he broke the sheet up into blocks. He put one stamp in a locket he gave to his wife.\n\nTo numismatists, Green is known for his extensive coin collection. Most notably, he was one of the original owners of all five of the 1913 Liberty Head Nickels known to exist.\n\nHe brought one of the first automobiles into Texas, \"a two-cylinder St. Louis Gas Car surrey, designed by George Norris [\"sic\" - the correct name is Dorris]\", and is reputed to have been involved in the first car accident in the state, when the car was forced off the road into a ditch by a farm wagon in October 1899 in Forney, Texas. He eventually owned a large fleet of cars, many modified with special transmissions on account of his prosthetic leg.\n\nIn 1924, Green rescued the last American wooden whaling vessel of the 19th century, the bark \"Charles W. Morgan\", and exhibited her, embedded in sand, at Round Hill. Green was the grandson of Edward Mott Robinson, one of the ship's earlier owners. The Marine Historical Association bought her in 1941, when she became a showpiece of Mystic Seaport Museum, Mystic, Connecticut.\n\nIn 1927, he opened an airfield on his property, and kept the field well-maintained according to people who flew there. Following his son's kidnapping, Charles Lindbergh landed on the property in order to investigate a lead about his whereabouts.\n\nColonel Green had an early fascination with radio technology, dating back to the 1890s. In June 1922, the Round Hills Radio Corporation was incorporated under a commercial charter, with Colonel Green the company president. Under the initial charter, the company's function, in addition to engaging in radio broadcasting, was to sell radio, telephone and similar equipment. However, because the company did not actually engage in commercial activities, in August of the next year it was rechartered under the state's charitable and educational statutes, with its mission now described as \"for radio experimentation, improving the uses of wireless and scientific experimentation in new devices to further the use of radio, and to broadcast, free of charge, concerts, weather reports, etc.\"\n\nTo support the radio operations, a building containing a broadcast studio plus laboratory rooms was constructed adjacent to the estate's main building. MIT's President, Samuel W. Stratton and the Department of Electrical Engineering's new Communications Division were invited to experiment with the new technology, and the department was initially financed by Green.\n\nIn September 1922, the Round Hills Radio Corporation received licenses for a broadcasting station, WMAF, in addition to one for experimental work, with the call sign 1XV. The broadcasting station, which was operated only during the summer months of 1923-1928, adopted the slogan \"The Voice from Way Down East\". For the summer of 1923, Green arranged for the American Telephone & Telegraph Company (AT&T) to install a telephone line connection to rebroadcast the programs originating from WEAF (now WFAN) in New York City, which was the first permanent radio network link.\n\nProfessor Edward L. Bowles set out to determine the signal strength and radiation patterns of different antenna arrays in 1926. Round Hill's radio station (which included an early radio telescope, built atop a water tower designed to look like the foundation of a lighthouse) followed Donald B. MacMillan's and Admiral Richard E. Byrd's polar expeditions, tracked the Graf Zeppelin dirigible during its maiden transatlantic flight, and was the sole communication link for areas devastated by the Vermont floods in 1927.\n\nIn 1933, Round Hill was the site of Robert J. Van de Graaff's electrical experiments. Van de Graaff had been brought to MIT from Princeton in 1931 to develop a high voltage research facility. He built a tall Van de Graaff generator in an abandoned airship hangar on Round Hill. The purpose was to provide the energy to accelerate subatomic particles to bombard atomic nuclei. The machine became operational in December 1933. It was capable of operating at 5,000,000 volts. After it became obsolete, the generator was donated in 1956 to the Museum of Science, Boston, and circa 2019 the generator continues to function as a major exhibit.\n\n\n"}

It is most often associated with tamarind (Filipino: \"sampalok\"), although it can use other sour fruits and leaves as the souring agent. It is one of the more popular dishes in Filipino cuisine.\n\n\"Sinigang\" means \"stewed [dish]\", it is a nominalized form of the Tagalog verb \"sigang\", \"to stew\". While present nationwide, \"sinigang\" is seen to be culturally Tagalog in origin, thus the similar sour stews and soups found in the Visayas and Mindanao (like \"linarang\") are regarded as different dishes and differ in the ingredients used. Fish sauce is a common condiment for the stew. The Malaysian dish \"singgang\" is derived from \"sinigang\".\n\n\"Sinigang\" is most often associated with tamarind in modern times, but it originally referred to any meat or seafood cooked in a sour and acidic broth, similar to but differentiated from \"paksiw\" (which uses vinegar). Other variations of the dish derive their sourness from native ingredients. These souring agents include unripe mangoes, butterfly tree leaves (\"alibangbang\"), citruses (including the native calamansi and biasong), santol, bilimbi (\"kamias\" or \"iba\"), gooseberry tree fruits (\"karmay\"), binukaw fruits (also \"batuan\"), and libas fruits, among others. Guava, introduced to the Philippines via the Manila galleons is also used. Seasoning powder or bouillon cubes with a tamarind base are commercial alternatives to using natural fruits.\n\n\"Sinigang\" typically use meat or seafood (e.g., fish, pork, beef, shrimp, or chicken) stewed with tamarind, tomatoes, garlic, and onions. Other vegetables commonly used in the making of sinigang include okra, taro corms (\"gabi\"), white radish (\"labanós\"), water spinach (\"kangkóng\"), yardlong beans (\"sitaw\") and eggplant (\"talóng\"). Most Filipinos like to cook sinigang with green long peppers in order to enhance the taste and add a little spice to the dish. Another variation includes adding locally made miso.\n\n\n\"Sinampalukang manók\" or \"sinampalukan\" is technically not a variation of sinigang, as the chicken has to be sautéed in ginger first instead of all the ingredients being placed simultaneously into the pot and brought to a boil. \"Sinampalukan\" is also distinguished by its use of shredded tamarind leaves, and is usually made together with ginger, onions, tomatoes, eggplant and other vegetables.\n\nOther Filipino dishes that are similar to \"sinigang\" but distinct include \"pinangat na isda\" from Southern Luzon and \"linarang\" from Cebu. Both of which also use sour fruits but are restricted to fish or seafood and differ in the other ingredients used.\n\n\n"}

By the time the last site was under the 22nd Signal Group's control in August 1964, the group had become a subordinate unit of the US Army Strategic Communications Command – Europe, thus severing its ties with United States Army Europe.\n\nIn April 1980, a provisional signal brigade was established. On 16 September 1980, the 22nd Signal Brigade was placed on the active rolls in an augmentation carrier status. A reorganization of the assets of the 32nd Signal Battalion (Corps) to create the Brigade Headquarters and the 17th Signal Battalion followed.\n\nWhen France made the final decision to withdraw from NATO, the 22nd kept communication channels open to withdrawing US forces until 16 March 1967. The brigade was inactivated as a TO&E unit until 13 November 1967 and was organized under a Table of Distribution and Allowances (TDA) as the Signal Group 22, supporting United States Army commands until 12 August 1974, when Signal Group 22's colors were furled in Mannheim, Germany.\n\nThe 22nd Signal Brigade (Corps), a major subordinate command of Headquarters, V Corps, was activated on 16 March 1981 by its first commander, Colonel Theodore W. Hummel. The 22nd Signal Brigade consisted of three battalions: the 17th Signal Battalion (Command), the 32nd Signal Battalion (Radio) and the 440th Signal Battalion (Area). The brigade's headquarters, along with 17th and 32nd Signal Battalions, were headquartered in Hoechst, while the 440th Signal Battalion remained in Darmstadt. The V Corps G6 office was located with the V Corps Headquarters in Frankfurt.\n\nIn 1990, brigade Soldiers (Charlie Company 17th Signal Battalion located at that time on Gibbs Kaserne in Frankfurt) in support of 143rd Signal Battalion 3rd Armored Division deployed to Saudi Arabia as part of Operation Desert Storm. The 22nd Signal Brigade was re-equipped with the Army's Mobile Subscriber Equipment in the Central Region of Germany immediately after Desert Storm and successfully weathered Army force reductions in USAREUR, reorganizing into its final structure. The brigade headquarters was located in Darmstadt, along with 32nd and 440th Signal Battalions. The 17th Signal Battalion headquarters was in Kitzingen, at Larson Barracks. The Corps G6 office was stationed in Heidelberg with the V Corps headquarters.\n\nIn 1995, under the operational command of the 1st Armored Division's Task Force Eagle, the 22nd Signal Brigade Headquarters, 440th Signal Battalion, elements of the 17th and 32nd Signal Battalions, and 1AD's 141st Signal Battalion, deployed to Bosnia and Herzegovina in support of Multi-National Division-North. Brigade Signaleers were the first elements to fly into Tuzla Airbase and cross the swollen Sava River during that first frozen December. The Brigade Task Force went on to install over 11 MSE node centers and over 43 small extension switching teams in support of US, Russian, Turk, and Nordic Polish forces throughout the Task Force Eagle area of operations in Bosnia. TFE Signaleers broke new ground in providing reliable voice, data, and video teleconferencing capabilities to MND-North's dispersed forces.\n\nAfter returning to Germany in December 1996, the brigade quickly reestablished itself as the premier tactical signal brigade in the Army. The brigade has been at the leading edge of tactical and technological innovations while supporting a vigorous USAREUR and V Corps exercise and training program. Beginning in 1995, 22nd Signaleers were continuously deployed in support of both the 1st Infantry Division and 1st Armored Division in Bosnia, US EUCOM's national support element in Hungary and NATO's Task Force Able Sentry in Macedonia. In May 1998, the brigade once again deployed the 440th Signal Battalion to Bosnia as the 1st Armored Division's Task Force Eagle Signal Support Force. In 2003, the brigade deployed all of its battalions in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n\n22nd Signal Brigade was deployed a second time to support Operation Iraqi Freedom in October 2005, returning October 2006.\n\nOn 22 May 2007, the colors of the 22nd Signal Brigade were furled and the unit was inactivated.\n"}

Cargotec was formed in June 2005 when Kone Corporation was split into two companies to be listed: Cargotec and new KONE.\n\nAfter the split, Kone Corporation's container handling (Kalmar Global), load handling (HIAB) and marine cargo handling (MacGregor) business units formed Cargotec. However, the businesses within Cargotec have much longer histories and have been formed through a series of mergers and acquisitions over several decades.\n\nAt the end of 2019, Cargotec had approximately 12,500 personnel working in over 100 countries.\n\nCargotec's major shareholders are the heirs of Pekka Herlin. Current (since July 12, 2005) Chairman of the Cargotec's Board of Directors is Ilkka Herlin.\n\nKalmar products and services are used in ports, terminals, distribution centers and in the heavy industry. Kalmar products include forklifts, terminal tractors, quay cranes, yard cranes, ASCs, shuttle and straddle carriers, reachstackers and equipment for empty container handling. Lately, Kalmar has invested in terminal automation and in energy-efficient container handling.\n\nHiab products, service and spare parts are used in on-road transport and delivery. The product portfolio includes loader cranes, demountable, forestry cranes, recycling cranes, truck-mounted forklifts, and tail lifts.\n\nMacGregor focuses on engineering solutions and services for handling marine cargos and offshore loads. MacGregor products are used in maritime transportation, offshore and naval logistics markets, in ports and terminals as well as on board ships.\n\nAround 2010, Cargotec prepared a separation and possible listing of MacGregor in Singapore. Due to market conditions and focusing on integration of major acquisitions, Cargotec's Board of Directors decided in October 2013 to delay the listing.\n\nCargotec was formed in June 2005 when Kone Corporation was split into two companies to be listed: Cargotec and new KONE. After the split, Kone Corporation's marine cargo handling (MacGregor), container handling (Kalmar Industries AB) and load handling (HIAB and Moffett, the latter being based in Ireland and acquired in 2000) business units formed Cargotec. However, the businesses within Cargotec have much longer histories and they have been formed through a series of mergers and acquisitions during several decades.\n\nCargotec's Kalmar business area started to take shape in 1997 when Partek Corporation acquired the Finnish state-owned Sisu Ltd including its terminal tractor business. During the same year, Partek acquired a major shareholding in Kalmar Industries Ltd, a container handling equipment producer.\n\nThe foundations of Cargotec's Hiab business area were laid in 1977 when Partek Corporation bought Multilift Group. In 1985, Partek acquired Hydrauliska Industrier Ltd (Hiab) and Jonsered forestry cranes. A couple of years later Partek strengthened its forestry crane expertise by acquiring that particular business line from Fiskars. Several business acquisitions in 2000 enforced the load handling business. In 2004, the name Hiab was taken into use for the whole load handling business in Cargotec.\n\nMacGregor originates from England where it started to serve shipping companies and shipyards in 1937. The marine cargo business of the company in a broader meaning started in 1983 when MacGregor merged with the Finnish Navire. In 1993 Incentive acquired MacGregor-Navire and merged it with Hägglunds Marine. In 1998, the majority of MacGregor was sold to Industri Kapital. In 2005, Cargotec bought MacGregor International AB, the global marine cargo flow solutions provider, to strengthen the company's cargo handling offering. Several mergers and acquisitions have taken place since to further strengthen MacGregor.\n\nIn 2011, Cargotec acquired Navis, a US based terminal operator systems provider from Zebra Technologies for $190 million.\n\nThe major shareholders of Cargotec are Pekka Herlin's heirs Ilkka Herlin (Wipunen varainhallinta oy), Niklas Herlin's estate (Mariatorp Oy) and Ilona Herlin (since 31 Aug 2015 Pivosto Oy) each managing over 22% of votes.\n"}

{"id": "2211109", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2211109", "title": "Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness", "text": "Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness\n\nMs. Pac-Man Maze Madness is a 3D, four-directional control (block-based) puzzle game starring Ms. Pac-Man. It was released on the Sony PlayStation console in all regions, and was later released on the Nintendo 64 and Sega Dreamcast exclusively in North America. Unlike the previous 20th Anniversary \"Pac-Man World\", the player must follow along designated paths. It was well received for its simple gameplay, staying true to the original \"Ms. Pac-Man\" game, but its multiplayer mode was at times heavily criticized.\n\nProfessor Pac learns that the evil forces have taken control of the Enchanted Castle, using black magic. The princess has vanished, and a witch named Mesmerelda is planning on stealing all four Gems of Virtue (Generosity, Truth, Wisdom, and Courage) to control the \"four wonders\" (areas of Pac-Land). These four areas each have enemies in them, and are blocked by mysterious force fields. Professor Pac creates a device called the Pactrometer, which allows Ms. Pac-Man to go to these areas to recover the gems before Mesmerelda can get them first. However, as the Professor is telling Ms. Pac-Man this, he gets sucked into a mirror by the witch, leaving Ms. Pac-Man with the Pactrometer. As she journeys through the areas, she is helped by video messages that the Professor placed in the Pactrometer, and by holograms of Professor Pac.\n\nAs Ms. Pac-Man gathers the last of the gems, they are stolen by Mesmerelda. A battle ensues and the witch is defeated and runs away, leaving behind a key. Without the key, Mesmerelda is unable to get into the castle to reach her crystal ball, and thus cannot use the gems.\n\nMs. Pac-Man returns to fight for the gems, and this time wins, regaining the gems. With them and the Pactrometer, the witch's spell is broken, and Mesmerelda returns to her true form as the princess. Professor Pac, Ms. Pac-Man, and the princess proceed to celebrate their victory.\n\nThe player must navigate a series of mazes with Ms. Pac-Man. Along the way, she encounters such obstacles as moving blocks, exploding boxes, and locked doors. To help her, there is 'Pac-Dot Radar' to locate missing dots the player will need before being allowed to reach the next section of a level. Placed about the maze are such devices as spring tiles (to jump over the walls of the maze, and sometimes on top of them); switches, keys, hearts to regain her health, and 'Power Pellets' used to allow Ms. Pac-Man to eat all the enemies in the area for a limited time.\n\nAs the player progresses, they must eat yellow dots scattered about each area, once they have eaten enough of these, a door will open, allowing them to reach a new section of that area. Each area has its own number of dots, as well as snacks such as fruit and pretzels. If the player can get all of these, as well as reaching the exit of the areas, they are rewarded with a 'Gold Star'. Once an area is beaten, the player can also play it again for a Time Trial, 'Gold Star', and 'Gold Clock'. Earning enough stars will unlock various features such as 'Bonus Rounds' between some levels, and a 'Movie Player' to watch the game's animated scenes.\n\nEach enemy and item that the player eats gives them more points, which can earn them additional lives, as well as allow them to unlock other features. After beating the two in-game bosses (the green 'Gobblin' and the final boss 'Mesmerelda'), the player receives the 'Witch's Key' which allows them to unlock various locations in the earlier areas. However, the game requires the player to beat the bosses twice in order to see the game's ending.\n\nThe multiplayer mode allows up to 4 people to play simultaneously (although a player can play solo, verse three computer-controlled characters).\n\nThere are three different multiplayer modes:\n\nThe original arcade version of Ms. Pac-Man is freely playable as an option on the main menu, similar to how the original \"Pac-Man\" arcade game was freely available on the main menu of the 20th Anniversary \"Pac-Man World\" game. This was not included in the Game Boy Advance version.\n\nThe reception for Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness was mainly positive. IGN stated on the Nintendo 64 review \"The simple gameplay of \"Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness\" makes it an ideal choice for young kids\", and also adds \"However, solid gameplay and some great extras will interest [we] \"older kids as well\". GameSpot gave this game a rating of 65% for the PlayStation and Game Boy Advance, 68% for the Nintendo 64, and 69% for the Dreamcast, saying that \"While Maze Madness may be overly easy for experienced gamers, the younger crowd and inexperienced gamers should have loads of fun with the game.\" The multiplayer mode received less favorable reception. Nintendo Power, stated \"The multiplayer mode stumbles,\" while N64 Magazine gave it a much harsher description: \"The Multiplayer mazes are viewed from three-quarters angle — and the blurry visuals make it all but impossible to see what's going on.\" They also continue comparing the tag games as being \"ruined by the fact that the chasers move twice as fast as the other players.\" Their final comment on the multiplayer mode was simply \"Terrible.\"\n\nChris Charla reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \"The maze format makes the game too limited to be the next \"Ape Escape\", but it's definitely worth a look.\"\n\nDaniel Erickson reviewed the Nintendo 64 version of the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \"A solid package for just about any gamer.\"\n\nThere was originally supposed to be a sequel to this game for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube called \"Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness 2\", which was to be developed by TKO Software and to be released in 2005, but it was quietly cancelled.\n"}

Another theory is that the name is derived from the thriving honey industry that began in the area in 1869 and comes from the Spanish translation of Dulzura meaning \"sweetness\".\n\nAlthough it was also the place of death for former Major League Baseball pitcher Eric Show, it was best known between 1908 and 1914 as the home of a delicacy known as \"Clark's Pickelized Figs,\" a candied fruit that was sold from small firkins at grocery stores across the United States. The figs were produced at Clark Ranch by Frank and Lila Clark. The advent of World War I resulted in a sugar shortage which effectively ended the family business.

For example, the hydrogen molecule, because of its light mass, gets a high translational energy.

For example, a reaction of a hydrogen atom with hydrogen atoms on a silicon surface and a reaction of an oxygen atom with oxygen molecules on Pt(111) have been reported. Hot atoms can also be generated by degenerating molecules on a metal surface with UV light. It has been reported that the reactivity of an oxygen atom generated in such a way on a platinum surface is different from that of chemisorbed oxygen atoms. Elucidating the role of hot atoms on surfaces will lead to a deeper understanding of the mechanism of reactions.\n\n"}

This colourless solid is a notable electrical insulator with a higher thermal conductivity than any other non-metal except diamond, and exceeds that of most metals. As an amorphous solid, beryllium oxide is white. Its high melting point leads to its use as a refractory material. It occurs in nature as the mineral bromellite. Historically and in materials science, beryllium oxide was called glucina or glucinium oxide.\n\nBeryllium oxide can be prepared by calcining (roasting) beryllium carbonate, dehydrating beryllium hydroxide, or igniting metallic beryllium:\nIgniting beryllium in air gives a mixture of BeO and the nitride BeN. Unlike the oxides formed by the other Group 2 elements (alkaline earth metals), beryllium oxide is amphoteric rather than basic.\n\nBeryllium oxide formed at high temperatures (>800 °C) is inert, but dissolves easily in hot aqueous ammonium bifluoride (NHHF) or a solution of hot concentrated sulfuric acid (HSO) and ammonium sulfate ((NH)SO).\n\nBeO crystallizes in the hexagonal wurtzite structure, featuring tetrahedral Be and O centres, like lonsdaleite and w-BN (with both of which it is isoelectronic). In contrast, the oxides of the larger group-2 metals, i.e., MgO, CaO, SrO, BaO, crystallize in the cubic rock salt motif with octahedral geometry about the dications and dianions. At high temperature the structure transforms to a tetragonal form.\n\nIn the vapour phase, beryllium oxide is present as discrete diatomic molecules. In the language of valence bond theory, these molecules can be described as adopting \"sp\" orbital hybridisation on both atoms, featuring one σ (between one \"sp\" orbital on each atom) and one π bond (between aligned \"p\" orbitals on each atom oriented perpendicular to the molecular axis). Molecular orbital theory provides a slightly different picture with no \"net\" sigma bonding (because the 2\"s\" orbitals of the two atoms combine to form a filled sigma bonding orbital and a filled sigma* anti-bonding orbital) and two pi bonds formed between both pairs of \"p\" orbitals oriented perpendicular to the molecular axis. The sigma orbital formed by the \"p\" orbitals aligned along the molecular axis is unfilled. The corresponding ground state is ...(2sσ)(2sσ*)(2pπ) (as in the isoelectronic C molecule), where both bonds can be considered as dative bonds from oxygen towards beryllium.\n\nHigh-quality crystals may be grown hydrothermally, or otherwise by the Verneuil method. For the most part, beryllium oxide is produced as a white amorphous powder, sintered into larger shapes. Impurities, like carbon, can give a variety of colours to the otherwise colourless host crystals.\n\nSintered beryllium oxide is a very stable ceramic. Beryllium oxide is used in rocket engines and as a transparent protective over-coating on aluminised telescope mirrors.\n\nBeryllium oxide is used in many high-performance semiconductor parts for applications such as radio equipment because it has good thermal conductivity while also being a good electrical insulator. It is used as a filler in some thermal interface materials such as thermal grease. Some power semiconductor devices have used beryllium oxide ceramic between the silicon chip and the metal mounting base of the package to achieve a lower value of thermal resistance than a similar construction of aluminium oxide. It is also used as a structural ceramic for high-performance microwave devices, vacuum tubes, magnetrons, and gas lasers. BeO has been proposed as a neutron moderator for naval marine high-temperature gas-cooled reactors (MGCR), as well as NASA's Kilopower nuclear reactor for space applications.\n\nBeO is carcinogenic in powdered form and may cause chronic beryllium disease. Once fired into solid form, it is safe to handle if not subjected to machining that generates dust. Beryllium oxide ceramic is not a hazardous waste under federal law in the USA.\n\n"}

Controlling Pac-Man, the player must complete each of the game's six worlds, featuring five stages each, by collecting a certain amount of pellets to open up an exit door. The plot follows Pac-Man's enemies, the ghosts, crashing his 20th birthday and kidnapping his friends to bring them to their homeland of Ghost Island — with his birthday in ruins and his family in trouble, Pac-Man sets out to rescue them and defeat the ghosts.\n\nThe game originally began as an open-world adventure game titled \"Pac-Man Ghost Zone\", with development headed by director Bill Anderson and designer Scott Rogers. After being unhappy with the game's quality, Namco scrapped the game and fired nearly the entire team aside from Rogers and a few others. The development team focused on making the game live up to the \"flavor and feel\" of the original \"Pac-Man\", and to successfully bring the character into an enjoyable 3D adventure game. Rogers noted that this proved to be a difficult task, as he claims most fans of the series only had fond memories of the original and \"Ms. Pac-Man\", which put a lot of pressure on the team. Tommy Tallarico composed the game's soundtrack. Rogers originally wanted Pac-Man to have a voice in the game; however, Namco was unable to decide on what he should sound like and instead made him speechless, which also saved money on voice acting and animation. Other Namco characters, such as Valkyrie from \"Valkyrie no Densetsu\" and Taizo Hori from \"Dig Dug\", were meant to appear in the game but were scrapped later on.\n\n\"Pac-Man World\" was a critical and commercial success, selling over 1.25 million copies in North America alone. Reviewers praised the game's originality, colorful graphics, gameplay mechanics and soundtrack, with some comparing it favorably to Namco's own \"\". Some reviewers criticized it for being repetitive after a while and its constant use of backtracking. A Game Boy Advance remake was developed by Full Fat and released in 2004, while the PlayStation version was digitally re-released for the PlayStation Network in 2013 under the PSone Classics brand. It was followed by three sequels; \"Pac-Man World 2\" (2002), \"Pac-Man World 3\" (2005), and \"Pac-Man World Rally\" (2006). A spiritual successor, \"Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness\", was released a year later.\n\n\"Pac-Man World\" is a 3D platform video game. Controlling Pac-Man, the player must complete each of the game's six worlds to rescue his friends, who are held captive by the ghosts in their homeland of Ghost Island. Worlds consist of five levels each, which are completed by eating all of the pellets to open up an exit door. The final level of each world has a boss that Pac-Man must defeat in order to progress. The player can play whichever world he or she chooses, although two of them are locked until the other four are completed. Worlds also vary in themes, featuring pirate ships, factories, a circus, graveyards and outer space.\n\nLevels contain fruit that can be eaten for bonus points, alongside letters that spell out \"PACMAN\" — collecting all of these letters in a level will unlock a secret bonus stage. Some levels will have Pac-Man needing to retrieve a key to rescue one of his captive friends, which is required to progress through the game. Galaxian flagships can be found in certain levels that allow Pac-Man to access a 3D maze themed after the world he is in. These mazes play similarly to the original \"Pac-Man\" and \"Ms. Pac-Man\", where the player will need to eat all the dots and avoid the ghosts. Completing these mazes will unlock them for play later from the main menu. Most levels also contain Pac-Man's nemesis, the ghost gang, which can be defeated by consuming large Power Pellets and eating them.\n\nPac-Man has two main moves, which can be used to defeat enemies and other objects: a butt-bounce that can shatter crates and crush enemies, and a rev-roll that allows him to propel up ramps or activate moving platforms. Pac-Man has a health meter that allows him to sustain three hits before dying — he can find small fractions of health to replenish it in levels, alongside extra lives. The player can find crates scattered around in levels, some of them giving Pac-Man access to new abilities, such as a metal suit allowing him to walk underwater. Pac-Man can also interact with objects such as trampolines, doors and ramps, which can be used to solve puzzles to progress through the level. At the main menu, the player can play a port of the original \"Pac-Man\" arcade game, which is the same version found in \"Namco Museum Vol. 1\".\n\n\"Pac-Man World\" began as a prototype platform game for the PlayStation, titled \"Pac-Man Ghost Zone\", intended for a fall 1997 release. Headed by Namco Hometek director Bill Anderson, the game followed a teenager being sucked into a \"Pac-Man\" arcade cabinet by the ghosts and their leader the Ghostlord, and transforming into Pac-Man. The game was made to break the mold of previous \"Pac-Man\" games, such as having a grittier look. Namco's Japanese division put pressure on the project with strict guidelines — Anderson recalls being unable to use a 3D render of the character as a reference, requiring the team to make it themselves. Development was assisted by designer Scott Rogers, with music composed by Tommy Tallarico. When the prototype was presented to Namco, they became unhappy with it and cancelled it for quality reasons, firing the entire development team aside from Rogers, an artist and a programmer. Namco also pushed the release date back to 1998 to allow the game to be reworked. The team decided to revamp the project with a new gameplay engine.\n\nRogers, who had previously worked on localization for Namco's own \"Soul Edge\" and \"Xevious 3D/G\", became the head designer of the project and created many of the enemies and stage layouts. The team set out to retain the \"flavor and feel\" of the original \"Pac-Man\", and to bring the character into an entertaining platform game. Inspiration was taken from earlier platform games in the series, notably \"Pac-Land\" (1984) and \"Pac-In-Time\" (1995). During development, Rogers noted that trying to live up to the game's source material put a large amount of pressure on the team, claiming that most players were only familiar with the original \"Pac-Man\" and \"Ms. Pac-Man\" with no memories for later games in the series, which left the team having to make the game appeal to players of those two games. The game originally featured cameos from other Namco characters, including Taizo Hori from \"Dig Dug\" and Valkyrie from \"Valkyrie no Densetsu\", however these were replaced with members of Pac-Man's family in the final version — a Pooka from \"Dig Dug\" was later added into the game due to the character's popularity in Japan. The game's main antagonist, Toc-Man, is named after Namcot, the older Japanese home console division of Namco.\n\nPac-Man wasn't given a voice in the game due to Namco being unable to decide what he should sound like — some suggested that he sound like an adult male and others like a human child. To save money on voice acting and animation, the character was made to be speechless. Tommy Tallarico was hired back to compose the soundtrack. The game was first shown at the 1997 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) tradeshow in Atlanta, Georgia, under the working title \"Pac-Man 3-D\". Rogers recalls it being a popular title, saying that many play testers shared with him their memories with \"Pac-Man\" series. It was then shown off at E3 1999 under the final title of \"Pac-Man World: 20th Anniversary\". The game was released in North America on October 15, 1999 to coincide with the original release of \"Pac-Man\" in the United States. It was later released in Japan on November 2, 1999 and in Europe on February 28, 2000. A Game Boy Advance version was developed by Full Fat and released in 2004. The PlayStation version was digitally re-released on the PlayStation Network in 2013, part of the PSone Classics brand.\n\n\"Pac-Man World\" was well-received by critics for its gameplay, soundtrack, graphics and originality, holding an 80% score on aggregator website \"GameRankings\". By 2007, the game had sold over 1.24 million copies in North America alone.\n\n\"GameSpot\" compared the game favorably to Namco's own \"\", praising its colorful graphics, character animations and controls, concluding that it was \"worthy of anyone's library\". \"IGN\" had a similar response, liking the game's originality, graphics and soundtrack — they especially praised its gameplay for standing out among other platform games, with its puzzle solving and animation style. \"GameFan\" praised its gameplay, puzzle-solving mechanics and inclusion of the original \"Pac-Man\", while \"Official US PlayStation Magazine\" applauded its gameplay, vibrant graphics, challenge and boss fights, saying that the game's use of nostalgia doesn't feel forced on the player. \"GameFan\" also wrote that the game \"perfectly mimics those old 8-bit and 16-bit platformers we used to go nuts over\", comparing the game's quality favorably to \"Klonoa: Door to Phantomile\". \"Atari HQ\" liked how the game tied in a platform game with mechanics from the original, highly praising its gameplay and originality.\n\n\"Game Revolution\" was particularly negative towards the game, saying that it simply existed as a marketing ploy to scoop up additional money from the name recognition. They criticized the game for lacking originality, particularly comparing it unfavorably to \"Donkey Kong Country\" and \"Crash Bandicoot\", as well as for having an unbalanced difficulty level and \"quick, corner-cutting development\". They only recommended the game to hardcore \"Pac-Man\" fans, although mockingly commented that they \"probably bought [it] already.\"\n\n"}

The station is owned by West Palm Beach, Florida-based Ion Media Networks (the former Paxson Communications). KUPX-TV's offices are located on Lawndale Drive in the southern section of Salt Lake City, and its transmitter is located on Farnsworth Peak in the Oquirrh Mountains, southwest of Salt Lake City. The station's signal is rebroadcast on low-power translator stations K22MV-D (channel 22) in Teasdale, Utah, K23NU-D (channel 23) in Richfield, Utah, K26OY-D (channel 26) in Malad City, Idaho, K33OU-D (channel 33) in Fountain Green, Utah, and K41LF-D (channel 4) in Salina and Redmond, Utah.\n\nThere are two methods of accounting the station's history: by license and by \"intellectual unit\", which is the combination of a station's call letters, programming, network affiliation and staff. As the result of two local marketing agreements (LMAs) that began in 1998, which launched a process that culminated in a station swap in 1999, the KUPX license history differs from the intellectual unit history prior to April 21, 1998.\n\nOn April 24, 1985, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) granted an original construction permit to build a full-power television station on UHF channel 16 to serve Provo and the Salt Lake City television market. The new station, originally owned by Morro Rock Resources, Inc., was given the call letters KZAR-TV, it was then sold to Royal Television of Utah, Inc. in October 1985. Royal Television had considerable difficulty in constructing the station, as evidenced by several applications to change transmitter location and several construction permit extensions, and even replacements of expired construction permits. In 1988, the station's callsign was deleted, then restored four months later. In July 1990, Royal Television applied to replace the construction permit that was to expire the following month. The application was not granted until February 1996, more than five years later. In September 1995, Roberts Broadcasting agreed to buy the station from Royal Broadcasting, and the deal was consummated in May 1996. In February 1996, the same day that the FCC approved the sale of the station from Royal Television to Roberts Broadcasting, Paxson Communications sent a proposal to Roberts to acquire a 50% share in the station. The proposal was unsuccessful.\n\nOn August 22, 1997, ACME Communications agreed to acquire a 49% stake in KZAR-TV, with an agreement to purchase the other 51% once the television station was on the air. Jamie Kellner, CEO and co-founder of ACME, was also co-founder and at the time, CEO of The WB, so it was naturally assumed that KZAR-TV would affiliate with that network. In February 1998, KZAR-TV changed its call letters KUWB in anticipation of the upcoming WB affiliation.\nOn April 20, 1998, Paxson entered into an agreement with Roberts Broadcasting and ACME Communications where each station would acquire the other's assets, but WB programming would remain on channel 30. To expedite the process, the parties immediately entered into local marketing agreements, whereby the stations would swap call signs and would begin to operate each other's stations until the FCC could approve the assignments of license. The following day, the stations executed the LMAs. KUPX (channel 30) in Ogden became KUWB and KUWB (channel 16) in Provo adopted the KUPX call letters. Meanwhile, Roberts and ACME continued to own KUPX, but operated KUWB. Two days following the execution of the LMAs, KUPX applied for a license for channel 16 in Provo and the station became operational. The license was approved by the FCC on May 29, 1998. Paxson and Roberts Broadcasting/ACME filed formal assignment of license applications in May 1998 and the FCC approved the swap in March 1999. ACME Communications followed through on its agreement to acquire the remaining 51% of KUPX in November 1998 and the deal was consummated in February 1999. ACME and Paxson consummated the station swap agreement in September 1999 and took full ownership of the stations that they had already been operating under the LMAs.\n\nOriginally, KUPX was an outlet for inTV, a shopping and infomercial network owned by Paxson Communications, but on August 31, 1998, Paxson launched a family-oriented network called Pax TV, which KUPX as its owned-and-operated station for the market. Through Pax, KUPX also aired programming from The Worship Network during the overnight hours as well as infomercials and religious programs. On July 1, 2005, Paxson Communications became Ion Media Networks and Pax TV rebranded as i: Independent Television. The network again renamed itself to Ion Television on January 29, 2007.\n\nThe KUPX intellectual unit began September 6, 1996, when Paxson Communications agreed to acquire channel 30, then known as KOOG-TV, from Alpha & Omega Communications LLC. The station had previously been the WB affiliate in the Salt Lake City, and Paxson continued that affiliation, but also replaced Home Shopping Network programming with Paxson's infomercial network, inTV, and religious programming. KOOG-TV changed its call letters to KUPX in February 1998, and the intellectual unit moved over to channel 16 in April 1998, when ACME Communications and Roberts Broadcasting, co-owners of channel 16, and Paxson Communications, owners of channel 30, agreed to allow each other to manage their stations leading up to the station swap, which was completed in September 1999.\n\nOn April 3, 1997, the FCC adopted its Sixth Report and Order , establishing digital television service allotments . In the initial allotment, the FCC assigned UHF channel 29 for KOOG-DT, the companion channel to UHF channel 30 in Ogden, later to become KUPX-DT. In the station swap, which was initiated in April 1998, the allocation for KUPX-DT was treated as part of the KUPX intellectual unit, and became the companion channel for Provo UHF channel 16, although channel 29 was still officially assigned to Ogden in the Digital Table of Allotments. Paxson Communications filed an application for KUPX-DT in July 1998. As part of a significant reallocation of DTV stations approved by the FCC in May 2000 , the city of license for KUPX-DT officially moved from Ogden to Provo in the DTV Table of Allotments. The FCC granted a construction permit to build KUPX-DT in March 1999 and Paxson Communications applied for a license for the DTV station in May 2002, which the FCC granted on November 7, 2002. The station's digital signal transmits from Farnsworth Peak, while the analog signal's transmissions originated from Lake Mountain until the digital transition in June 2009.\n\nKUPX-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 16, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 29, using PSIP to display KUPX-TV's virtual channel as 16 on digital television receivers.\n\n"}

It was first performed in 1996 at London's Gate Theatre, directed by the author. The play is a modern adaptation of Seneca's \"Phaedra\". The play explores the brutal nature of love, social relations, nihilism and belief through the example of an affair between a queen and her stepson.\n\nIt centres more on Hippolytus (the original focuses more on Phaedra), who is rendered lazy and cynical by his upbringing as the son of King Theseus. Unlike classical drama, most of the violent action happens on stage rather than off.\n\nKane described \"Phaedra's Love\" as \"My comedy\".\n\nThe play opens Hippolytus cleaning semen and snot with socks that are lying about his room. He is described as 'fat' and his room is in disarray. Shortly thereafter Phaedra, his step-mother, is talking to a doctor about Hippolytus's wellbeing. The doctor deduces Phaedra's romantic affection for her step-son and warns her against consummating her affection. She confides in her daughter, Strophe, who likewise warns Phaedra against pursuing an affair with Hippolytus. Phaedra approaches Hippolytus, regardless of the warnings she has heard. Hippolytus openly speaks about his multiple sexual partners and reinforces how he doesn't care for any of them and won't care for Phaedra. Phaedra confesses her love for him, but he spurns her, telling her she will only be hurt. She then proceeds to perform fellatio on him. He is initially unresponsive, but when he reaches his climax he asserts himself in the act. During the interaction Hippolytus informs Phaedra that he has had sex with his step-sister, Strophe, and that Strophe, Phaedra's biological daughter, has also had sex with Theseus, Phaedra's husband and Hippolytus's father. It is later revealed that Strophe had sex with Theseus on the night Theseus and Phaedra were married. Afterwards, Phaedra kills herself, leaving behind a note that states Hippolytus has raped her. Strophe confronts Hippolytus about the accusation, but he refuses to deny or confirm the allegation, though the subtext implies that he did not. Whilst in prison, Hippolytus speaks with a priest who eventually performs fellatio on Hippolytus. In the final sequence Theseus has returned home and disguises himself in a crowd. Strophe, unbeknownst to Theseus, has done the same. She publicly defends Hippolytus and Theseus responds by raping and killing her. The enraged mob rips Hippolytus limb from limb, and his father disembowels him. Afterwards, when Theseus sees the corpses, he realizes that it was Strophe who he had just raped and killed and expresses regret before cutting his own throat. The play ends as a vulture flies down to consume the corpse of Hippolytus.\n\n"}

On May 25, 1602 (o.s.), the vessel \"Concord\" having first entering Buzzards Bay (which the crew called \"Gosnolls Hope\") from Vineyard Sound, they determined to make the west side of on an islet within Cuttyhunk Island their settlement. From that island Archer saw the a hill on the mainland which he called \"Hap's Hill,\" \"for that I hope much hap may be expected from it.\" On May 31, Captain Gosnold sailed to the mainland, anchored and came ashore. There he was welcomed by native men, women and children \"who with all courteous kindnesse entertayned him …,\" presenting him with furs (thought valuable by Archer), tobacco, turtles, hemp, chains and other ornaments. The landing party explored the coast finding it to be, in the words of Archer, \"the goodliest continent that ever we saw, promising more by farre than we any way did expect … .\" Exploring the coast they discovered Hap's Island between two inlets. On the basis of the description, Hurd determined that what Archer called Hap's Hill was later referred to as \"Round Hill.\"\n\nEdward Howland Robinson Green, known as \"Colonel\" Ned Green, the only son of the renowned female tycoon and miser, Hetty Green, built his home on Round Hill after his mother's death in 1916 left him and his sister with a fortune of between $100 and $200 million. The mansion was designed by architect Alfred C. Bossom and completed in 1921 at a cost of $1.5 million.\n\nIn 1948, twelve years after the Colonel's death, his sister Sylvia Green, his heir, donated the entire property to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which used the estate for educational and military purposes until 1964. MIT erected a giant antenna atop a 50,000-gallon water tank on the site. Another was erected nearby for research towards the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System. The giant dish antenna stood as a local and marine navigational landmark until the current owners of the site, the Bevelaqua family, demolished it in 2007.\n\nIn 1964 MIT sold the estate to the Society of Jesus of New England. It adapted the mansion as a religious retreat center. Its upper floors were converted into 64 individual rooms, and its main floor reworked to include a chapel, conference rooms, and library. In 1968 the Jesuits sold much of the estate's beach to the Town of Dartmouth. In 1970 it sold the entire property to Gratia R. Montgomery, a local woman. In 1981 she sold most of the site to private developers. They developed it as a private, gated condominium community.\n\nCol. Green had an early fascination with radio technology, dating back to the 1890s, and in June 1922, the Round Hills Radio Corporation was incorporated under a Massachusetts charter, with Colonel Green the company president. To support the radio operations, a building containing a broadcast studio plus laboratory rooms was constructed adjacent to the estate's main building. In September 1922, the Round Hills Radio Corporation received licenses for a broadcasting station, WMAF, in addition to one for experimental work, with the call sign 1XV. The broadcasting station, which was operated only during the summer months of 1923-1928, adopted the slogan \"The Voice from Way Down East\".\n\nMIT's President, Samuel W. Stratton and the Department of Electrical Engineering's new Communications Division were invited to experiment with the new technology, and the department was initially financed by Green. Professor Edward L. Bowles set out to determine the signal strength and radiation patterns of different antenna arrays in 1926. Round Hill's radio station (which included an early radio telescope, built atop a water tower designed to look like the foundation of a lighthouse) followed Donald B. MacMillan's and Admiral Richard E. Byrd's polar expeditions, tracked the Graf Zeppelin dirigible during its maiden transatlantic flight, and was the sole communication link for areas devastated by the Vermont floods in 1927.\n\nIn 1933, Round Hill was the site of Robert J. Van de Graaff's electrical experiments. Van de Graaff had been brought to MIT from Princeton in 1931 to develop a high voltage research facility. He built a tall Van de Graaff generator in an abandoned airship hangar on Round Hill. The purpose was to provide the energy to accelerate subatomic particles to bombard atomic nuclei. The machine became operational in December 1933. It was capable of operating at 5,000,000 volts. After it became obsolete, the generator was donated in 1956 to the Museum of Science, Boston, and circa 2011 the generator continues to function as a major exhibit.\n\nThe New Bedford whaling ship Charles W. Morgan, now on display at Mystic Seaport, was once owned in part by Colonel Green, and moored at Round Hill.\n\nDuring World War II, the Coast Artillery built a fire control structure on the site. This site was known as the Mishaum Point Military Reservation.\n\nIn 2007 the property was bought for around $8.5 million. On November 19, 2007, the antenna was demolished by the new owner, who planned to build a new home on the site.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Virata was the third to occupy the position and was succeeded by economist Vicente Valdepeñas, Jr..\n\nHe was replaced as Prime Minister in the aftermath of the 1986 People Power Revolution by Salvador Laurel. Laurel succeeded Virata as Prime Minister on 25 February 1986, through the appointment of Corazon Aquino, but the position was abolished a month later by Proclamation No. 3 (the 'Freedom Constitution'). The office was confirmed as superseded by the 1987 Constitution, which again fused the offices of the head of state and the head of government in the President.\n\nPrior to assuming leadership positions in the government service during the Marcos regime, Virata used to teach at the business school of the University of the Philippines Diliman. He served as dean of the College of Business Administration, which was named after him on April 12, 2013 by the University of the Philippines Board of Regents (BOR) as the Cesar E.A. Virata School of Business. Several interest groups, including U.P. Kilos Na, have protested this renaming of the business school, and the BOR decided to restudy its decision during its board meeting held last July 29, 2013. Some members in certain interest groups, including U.P. Kilos Na, the UP Diliman University Council, undergraduates of the UP College of Business, and in the BOR itself then objected to renaming the business school after Virata. The matter was discussed at length in a series of meetings which resulted in the BOR re-affirming its decision to rename the college after Virata.\n\nVirata is married to Phylita Joy Gamboa, a popular stage actress, and has three children: Steven Cesar, a businessman; Gillian Joyce, an educator; and Michael Dean, a doctor specializing in infectious diseases. The grandnephew of the first President, Emilio Aguinaldo, Virata holds an MBA from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Virata is also an accomplished tennis player. His uncle, Leonides Sarao Virata, also served during under Marcos as Secretary of Trade and Industry and chairman of the Development Bank of the Philippines. As with most of his family, Virata is a member of the Philippine Independent Church.\n\nVirata's life and his impact on Philippine economic history have been the subject of various books. The most of extensive biography to cover Virata as its main subject is Gerardo Sicat's 2014 biography, \"Cesar Virata: Life and Times Through Four Decades of Philippine Economic History.\" He is also one of the main subjects of Teresa S. Encarnacion Tadem's 2019 Ateneo Press book \"Philippine Politics and the Marcos Technocrats: The Emergence and Evolution of a Power Elite.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2211169", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2211169", "title": "Cratylus (dialogue)", "text": "Cratylus (dialogue)\n\nCratylus (; , \"Kratylos\") is the name of a dialogue by Plato. Most modern scholars agree that it was written mostly during Plato's so-called middle period. In the dialogue, Socrates is asked by two men, Cratylus and Hermogenes, to tell them whether names are \"conventional\" or \"natural\", that is, whether language is a system of arbitrary signs or whether words have an intrinsic relation to the things they signify.\n\nThe individual Cratylus was the first intellectual influence on Plato (Sedley). Aristotle states that Cratylus influenced Plato by introducing to him the teachings of Heraclitus, according to MW. Riley.\n\nThe subject of Cratylus is \"the correctness of names\" (περὶ ὀνομάτων ὀρθότητος), in other words, it is a critique on the subject of naming (Baxter).\n\nWhen discussing an ὄνομα (\"\" ) and how it would relate to its subject, Socrates compares the original creation of a word to the work of an artist. An artist uses color to express the essence of his subject in a painting. In much the same way, the creator of words uses letters containing certain sounds to express the essence of a word's subject. There is a letter that is best for soft things, one for liquid things, and so on. He comments:\n\nOne countering position, held by Hermogenes, is that names have come about due to custom and convention. They do not express the essence of their subject, so they can be swapped with something unrelated by the individuals or communities who use them.\n\nThe line between the two perspectives is often blurred. During more than half of the dialogue, Socrates makes guesses at Hermogenes' request as to where names and words have come from. These include the names of the Olympian gods, personified deities, and many words that describe abstract concepts. He examines whether, for example, giving names of \"streams\" to Cronus and Rhea (\"Ροή\" – flow or space) are purely accidental.\n\nThe Greek term \"ῥεῦμα\" may refer to the flow of any medium and is not restricted to the flow of water or liquids. Many of the words which Socrates uses as examples may have come from an idea originally linked to the name, but have changed over time. Those of which he cannot find a link, he often assumes have come from foreign origins or have changed so much as to lose all resemblance to the original word. He states, \"names have been so twisted in all manner of ways, that I should not be surprised if the old language when compared with that now in use would appear to us to be a barbarous tongue.\"\n\nThe final theory of relations between name and object named is posited by Cratylus, a disciple of Heraclitus, who believes that names arrive from divine origins, making them necessarily correct. Socrates rebukes this theory by reminding Cratylus of the imperfection of certain names in capturing the objects they seek to signify. From this point, Socrates ultimately rejects the study of language, believing it to be philosophically inferior to a study of things themselves.\n\nAn extensive section of Plato's dialogue \"Cratylus\" is devoted to the etymology of the god Hades' name, in which Socrates is arguing for a folk etymology not from \"unseen\" but from \"his knowledge (\"eidenai\") of all noble things\". The origin of Hades' name is uncertain, but has generally been seen as meaning \"The Unseen One\" since antiquity. Modern linguists have proposed the Proto-Greek form *\"Awides\" (\"unseen\"). The earliest attested form is \"Aḯdēs\" (), which lacks the proposed digamma. West argues instead for an original meaning of \"the one who presides over meeting up\" from the universality of death.\n\nThe sound was lost at various times in various dialects, mostly before the classical period.\n\nIn Ionic, had probably disappeared before Homer's epics were written down (7th century BC), but its former presence can be detected in many cases because its omission left the meter defective. For example, the words ἄναξ (; 'tribal king', 'lord', '(military) leader') and (; 'wine') are sometimes found in the Iliad in the meter where a word starting with a consonant would be expected. Cognate-analysis and earlier written evidence shows that earlier these words would have been (, attested to in this form in Mycenaean Greek) and (; cf. Cretan Doric \"ibêna\", cf. Latin \"vīnum\" and English \"wine\").\n\n\nAlthough these are clear examples of onomatopoeia, Socrates's statement that words are not musical imitations of nature suggests that Plato didn't believe that language itself generates from sound words.\n\nPlato's theory of forms also makes an appearance. For example, no matter what a hammer is made out of, it is still called a \"hammer\", and thus is the \"form\" of a hammer:\nSocrates: So mustn't a rule-setter also know how to embody in sounds and syllables the name naturally suited to each thing? And if he is to be an authentic giver of names, mustn't he, in making and giving each name, look to what a name itself is? And if different rule-setters do not make each name out of the same syllables, we mustn't forget that different blacksmiths, who are making the same tool for the same type of work, don't all make it out of the same iron. But as long as they give it the same form--even if that form is embodied in different iron--the tool will be correct, whether it is made in Greece or abroad. Isn't that so?\n\nPlato's theory of forms again appears at 439c, when Cratylus concedes the existence of \"a beautiful itself, and a good itself, and the same for each one of the things that are\".\n\nAn early translation was made by Thomas Taylor in 1804.\n\n\"Plato: Cratylus, Parmenides, Greater Hippias, Lesser Hippias.\" With translation by Harold N.

The ships were originally designed to be fitted with the Trishul SAM, but in 2001, the decision was made to deploy the Barak SAM.\n\nThe \"Times of India\" reported on 7 September 2005, that \"Betwa\" became the first Indian warship to successfully integrate indigenous combat data systems, with a wide variety of foreign/Indian weapons and sensors on board. While \"Brahmaputra\" was the first warship to be equipped with the BEL combat data systems, it was Betwa that has validated the indigenous technology platform. Captain C S Murthy, Commanding Officer of \"Betwa\", stated that the integrated systems had been successfully tested to an extreme. The anti-submarine warfare officer of \"Betwa\", Lieutenant Commander Sharad Parti, stated, \"The EMMCA system gives commanders on the ship a consolidated tactical picture. It adds to the ship's maritime combat power.\" Commodore R P S Ravi, Director of the Maritime Warfare Centre in Mumbai, stated that it was a significant achievement for the Navy that indigenous data systems would be used for target evaluation, weapon selection and target engagement.\n\nThe vessels are designed for a crew of 350 (including 40 officers + 13 aircrew). The ships are propelled by 2 BHEL \"Bhopal\" steam turbines.\n\nThe vessels feature a Bharat RAWS-03 S-band radar using a DA08 antenna for air/surface search. The air search radar is a Bharat/Signaal RAWL-02 (PLN 517) D-band radar using a LW08 antenna. They use a One Decca Bridgemaster, BEL Rashmi (PIN 524) I-band radar with a ZW06 antenna for navigation.\n\nThe ships are provided with a Bharat HUMSA (Hull Mounted Sonar Array), a medium-frequency, active panoramic search and attack sonar. They also use a Thales (Thomson Marconi Sonar) Sintra towed array sonar.\n\nVessels feature BEL's EMCCA (Electronic Modular Command & Control Applications) Action Information Organisation (AIO) system with 10 multi-function consoles using Barco MPRD 9651 display linked with a LAN (Large Area Network). The system is capable of C3I and threat analysis and all tactical data can be integrated onto one display if necessary. The EMCCA system is an intra-naval AIO package made by Bharat Electronics Ltd. The vessels also feature an Indian-developed data link and Inmarsat communications (JRC). These frigates can operate in all environments, including those contaminated by nuclear, chemical or biological fallouts.\n\nThe \"Brahmaputra\" class is armed with sixteen 3M-24E (Kh-35 Uran or NATO: SS-N-25 Switchblade) anti-ship missiles (AShM), housed in four quadruple KT-184 launchers, angled at 30°, two on either side of the bridge superstructure. Equivalent to the Harpoon Block 1C AShM, these missiles have active radar homing (ARH) out to a range of at 0.9 Mach, with a warhead. All 16 Urans can be ripple-fired in 2-3 second intervals. Fire control is provided by a BEL Aparna (modified Garpun-Bal FC, NATO: Plank Shave) radar. The Garpun-Bal FC radar combines active and passive channels and in the active target designation mode, it operates in X-band (I/J-band) and can handle up to 150 targets at ranges between , although it is possible to obtain ranges of more than in wave-guide propagation conditions. The passive channel operates in the ESM mode searching for pulse and CW signals, and accurately identifying the bearing of hostile emitters from a built-in classification library of up to 1,000 signatures. The maximum range of the passive channel is over 100 km depending on the frequency.\n\nThe shoulder-held Igla-M (SA-N-10) SAM launcher was used as a stop-gap measure aboard INS \"Brahmaputra\" at launch, until the ship was retro-fitted with the Israeli Barak SAM system, with fire control provided by an EL/M-2221 STGR radar. INS \"Betwa\" and INS \"Beas\" were commissioned with these systems deployed.\n\nOne OTO Melera Super Rapid main gun, for use against ship and shore targets, with 65 rounds per minute to . Four multi-barrelled AK-630 Gatling guns on either beam, to shoot down incoming anti-ship missiles, with 5500 to 6000 rds/min to . Fire control for these five gun mounts are provided by two BEL Shikari (based on the Contraves Seaguard) opto-electronic trackers that operate in the I- and Ka-bands. Either of the Shikari trackers can control all five gun mounts or any combination thereof. Good minimum ranges, for the 76 mm gun, have been largely achieved by advanced software.\n\nSix ILAS 3 torpedo tubes in two triple mounts with Whitehead A244S anti-submarine torpedoes, with active/passive homing to at with a shaped charged warhead. Can also fire the AET anti-submarine torpedo, a locally produced version of the A244S.\n\nThe weapons-control radar is a BEL Shikari, BEL Aparna, RAN and RAWS-03. A BEL Ajanta Mk.2C is used as the EW (Electronic Warfare) suite. A media report, dated 5 May 2007, stated that the ELLORA Electronic Support Measures (ESM) system is fitted aboard \"Beas\" and the other two vessels in the class will also feature this ESM system. The ELLORA is an indigenous development by the Defence Electronics Research Laboratory (DLRL). The vessels are also fitted with two chaff/flare launchers, featuring long and medium range deceiver chaff. Features two Graesby G738 Towed Torpedo Decoy systems or the indigenously developed BEL Towed Torpedo Decoy. The 'Super Barricade' chaff launcher is also installed.\n\nDepending on operation requirements, two Sea King Mk.42B anti-ship and anti-submarine helicopters can be embarked or a combination of the HAL Chetak and a Sea King Mk.42B is usually embarked. The latter is equipped with a surface search radar, dunking sonar and can carry two Sea Eagle AShMs or a combination of depth charges and AS-244 anti-submarine torpedoes. The Sea King Mk.42B helicopter can fly around the vessel and is equipped with a data link to download target data to the combat information centre, based on the indigenous Bharat Shikari (Hunter) combat data system, in the operations room. Bharat Shikari is a derivative of the Italian IPN series of combat data systems, but integrating Western, Russian and Indian weapons and sensor systems.\n\nThe construction of these vessels at GRSE was slowed down due to a combination of design changes, labor problems, delays in equipment availability and integration problems with the Trishul SAM. This caused severe delays to the commissioning date of \"Brahmaputra\". The vessel was laid down in 1989 as a part of the \"Godavari\" class. After the new design for Project 16A was finalized in September 1994, the ship was finally commissioned on 14 April 2000.\n\n"}

The mercenaries manage to capture the drug lord, but his men are trying to set him free. Along the way the heroes cross into Vietnam and must face a sadistic Vietnamese colonel as well as protect the family of Chang Chung which lives in a village near the border.\n\n\nAfter finishing \"Plain Jane to the Rescue\" director John Woo began working on a film titled \"The Sunset Warrior\". Woo was not happy working for the production company Golden Harvest, noting that he \"I just wanted to make any movie for them to finish the contract.\" Woo found the script to be fairly simple and made changes to it to make it more emotional.\n\nThe film was shot in Thailand the film featured cast and crew who did not speak English. This included three Korean actors, two French actors (Phillippe Loffredo and Cécile Le Bailly) and a Japanese cameraman and director of photography. The film included scenes of sexuality and drug use which were not shot by Woo.\n\nAfter the film's completion, it was shelved. Woo commented that the film was all over the place in tone with sometimes being very emotional, something being as violent as a horror film and that it did not contain any popular actors. As of 2004, Woo stated he had not seen the film in its finished form.\n\nAfter the popularity of Woo's film \"A Better Tomorrow\", the film was released for one week in Hong Kong under the new title \"Heroes Shed No Tears\". The film was released in Hong Kong on September 5, 1986. It grossed a total of 2.8 million Hong Kong Dollars.\n\nFrom retrospective reviews, \"Heroes Shed No Tears\" received a four out of ten rating from John Charles in his book \"The Hong Kong Filmography , 1977-1997\". The review noted that the film had \"virtually no plot\" and \"few sympathetic characters\" and that it \"displays none of the finesse that would characterise Woo's later work\" In his book \"Ten Thousand Bullets\", Christopher Heard stated that the film was \"nowhere near as slick as [Woo]'s later movies, but it does have a dark visual harshness that indicates Woo knew the direction in which he wanted to travel.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Quinquela Martín is considered the port painter-par-excellence and one of the most popular Argentine painters. His paintings of port scenes show the activity, vigor and roughness of the daily life in the port of La Boca.\n\nHis birthday could not be determined precisely as he was abandoned on March 20, 1890 at an orphanage with a note that stated \"This kid has been baptized, and his name is Benito Juan Martín\". From his physical appearance, the nuns who found him deduced that he should be around twenty days old; thus March 1 is regarded as his birthday.\n\nAdopted by Manuel and Justina Molina de Chinchella when he was seven years old, he adopted his stepfather's surname (which would later be hispanized as \"Quinquela\").\n\nAt the age of 14 he attended a modest night school of art in La Boca while working during day on the family's coal-yard. When he turned 17 years old he joined the Pezzini Stiattesi Conservatory, where he stayed until 1912.\n\nBy 1910 he had started appearing in small art exhibitions, mainly in and around La Boca. He obtained the second prize on the \"Salón Nacional\" (\"Spanish\", \"National Exhibition\") in 1920. After an exhibition at Mar del Plata in the same year, he was sent as the Argentine representative to an exhibition in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil attended by local personalities including Brazilian president Epitacio Pessoa. \n\nBy the 1920s Marcelo T. de Alvear and his wife were very fond of Quinquela Martín's works, and this admiration led to a lasting friendship. In 1922, Quinquela Martín was assigned as chancellor of the Argentine Madrid Consulate in Spain. On April 1923 he exhibited at the Círculo de Bellas Artes of Madrid. Two of his works were acquired by the institution (\"Buque en reparación\" and \"Efecto de Sol\"), while another two were acquired by the Museum of Modern Art of Madrid.\n\nIn 1925 he set sail for France because—in his own words—\"\"My trip to France is owed to President Alvear, who liked my work and wanted them to be judged by Paris\"\". The Musée du Luxembourg acquired \"Tormenta en el astillero\".\n\nIn 1927 he left for New York City, where he arrived Benito on board the SS American Legion on January 17, 1928. According to immigration records he was able to read and write in Spanish, Italian and French. According to The New York Times, his paintings were shown for the first time in the United States at the Anderson Galleries. Accounts say two paintings were bought by \"Mr. Havemeyer\", who donated them to the Metropolitan Museum of New York. After this exhibition he made several others under sculptor Georgette Blandi's tutelage. Before returning to Buenos Aires, he was invited to Havana by Conde Ribero to exhibit there.\n\nOn 1929, on a trip to Italy, he had an exhibition at the Palazzo delle Esposizioni in Rome. The Museum of Modern Art of Rome acquired several paintings which were chosen by Benito Mussolini during the display. Quinquela Martín made his last trip in 1930, to London, where he exhibited at the Burlington Gallery. Several British museums acquired his paintings, including the Museum of Arts of London, Museum of Birmingham, Sheffield, Swansea, Cardiff, New Zealand and St. James's Palace.\n\nBack at home, he became a philanthropist and donated several works to La Boca and the city of Buenos Aires. He also bought the land, and donated the money to build a school, a Children's Dental Hospital, a place where women breast-fed orphaned children, and his home to be used as a museum. In March 15, 1974, at the age of 84, he married his lifelong assistant, Alejandrina Marta Cerruti. He died on January 28, 1977, in Buenos Aires, of heart complications, and was buried in La Chacarita Cemetery. He was buried in a coffin painted by him the previous year, stating \"He who lived surrounded by colour cannot be buried in a plain box.\" On the cover of the coffin was a painting of the port of La Boca.\n\nAmong his most famous works are: \"Tormenta en el Astillero\" (Musée du Luxembourg, Paris), \"Puente de la Boca\" (St. James's Palace, London) and \"Crepúsculo en el astillero\" (Museo de Bellas Artes de la Boca Quinquela Martín, Buenos Aires).\n"}

The current holder of this position is Pope Tawadros II, who was selected as the 118th pope on November 18, 2012.\n\nFollowing the traditions of the church, the pope is chairman and head of the Holy Synod of the Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria as a first among equals. The Holy Synod is the highest authority in the Church of Alexandria, which has between 12 and 18 million members worldwide, 10 to 14 million of whom are in Egypt. It formulates the rules and regulations regarding matters of the church's organization, faith, and order. The pope is also the chairman of the church's General Congregation Council.\n\nAlthough historically associated with the city of Alexandria, the residence and Seat of the Coptic Orthodox Pope of Alexandria has been located in Cairo since 1047. The pope is currently established in Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral, inside a compound which includes the Patriarchal Palace, with an additional residence at the Monastery of Saint Pishoy.\n\nAfter the death of Shenouda III on March 17, 2012 the Holy Synod of the Coptic Orthodox Church voted. The names of the three candidates who received most votes were put in a glass chalice. The name then picked became the new Patriarch of Alexandria. It is believed the name is picked by 'Divine Choice', by a blindfolded boy. He is believed to be guided by the hand of God.\n\nThe liturgy of the Altar Ballot took place on November 4, 2012. The 60-year-old Bishop Tawadoros, Auxiliary Bishop of Beheira, assistant to Metropolitan Pachomios of Beheira, was chosen as the 118th Pope of Alexandria. He then chose the name of Theodoros II. He was formally enthroned on November 18, 2012.\n\nThe early Christian Church recognized the special significance of several cities as leaders of the worldwide \"catholic\" (universal) Church. The Church of Alexandria is one of these original patriarchates, but the succession to the role of patriarch in Alexandria is still disputed after the separation which followed the Council of Chalcedon.\n\nThe later development of the \"Pentarchy\" also granted secular recognition to these religious leaders. Because of this split, the leadership of this church is not part of this system.\n\nMembers of the church recognize its head as a successor of Mark the Evangelist, considered the first Bishop of Alexandria, who founded the Church in the 1st century, and therefore marked the beginning of Christianity in Africa.\n\nThe leader of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria is known as \"Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of all Africa on the Holy See of St. Mark the Apostle\". The Successor of St. Mark the Evangelist, Holy Apostle and Martyr, on the Holy Apostolic Throne of the Great City of Alexandria.\n\nHis full title is:\n\nThat is:\n\nIn being so, he is considered to be:\n\nHonorary titles attributed to the Hierarch of the Alexandrine Throne are:\n\n“Pope and Lord Archbishop of the Great City of Alexandria and Patriarch of all Africa on the Holy Apostolic Holy See of St. Mark the Evangelist and Holy Apostle”.\n\nThe appellation of \"pope\" has been attributed to the Bishop of Alexandria since the episcopate of Heraclas, the thirteenth Bishop of Alexandria. All the clergy of Alexandria and Lower Egypt honored him with the appellation \"papas\", which means \"father\", as the senior and elder bishop among all bishops, within the Egyptian province, who are under his jurisdiction, three centuries before it was assumed by Pope John I Bishop of Rome (523–526), who ratified the Alexandrian computation of the date of Easter. Bestowing the title on Rome's pontiff did not strip it from Alexandria's, and the Roman Catholic Church recognizes this ecclesiastical fact.\n\nSince Alexandria was the capital of the province, the preaching center and the place of martyrdom of Saint Mark the Evangelist and Holy Apostle, the title “Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of all Africa on the Holy Throne of Saint Mark the Evangelist and Holy Apostle\". also known as “Pope and Patriarch of Alexandria and all Africa” in short, was that of the Bishop of Alexandria.\n\nThe appellation of \"pope\" became recognized as a title, but this did not mean that it represented a title different or higher than the title of \"patriarch\". Only the Patriarch of Alexandria, however, has the double title of Pope and Patriarch among the Oriental Orthodox and the Eastern Orthodox thrones.\n\nPope (, \"papa\") has been the specific designation for the Archbishop of Alexandria, Patriarch of Egypt, and the See of Saint Mark, whose ecclessiastic title is, Papa Abba, the Abba stands for the devotion of all monastics, from Pentapolis in the West to Constantinople in the East, to his guidance.\n\nHistorically, this office has held the title of Papa, Father in Coptic, since Papa Heracleus, 13th Alexandrine Patriarch (232–249 AD) was first to associate with the title three centuries before it was assumed by John I, the Bishop of Rome (523–526), who ratified the Alexandrian computation of the date of Easter. Bestowing the title on Rome's Pontiff did not strip it from Alexandria's, and the Roman Catholic Church recognizes this. In the Roman Catholic viewpoint, this title does not have the same meaning as that of the Bishop of Rome, who was the only Primate in the West to be given the title of \"Pope\" in the beginning of the 5th century. The Pope of Rome is considered by the Roman Catholic Church as the \"Supreme Pontiff\", holding the office of the Roman See (being one of the successors of Saint Peter). On the other hand, both the Oriental Orthodox and Byzantine Orthodox Churches respond by saying that their respective heads are equal with Rome and also note that Rome has deviated too much already from their original understanding.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church considers that the Pope of Rome ranks higher than the four other popes and patriarchs of the Major Apostolic Thrones (Alexandria, Constantinople, Antioch and Jerusalem). This viewpoint is not accepted by the Coptic Orthodox Church.\n\nThe title \"patriarch\" means the head or the leader of a tribe or a community. Ecclesiastically it means the head of the fathers (bishops) and their congregation of faithful. This title is historically known as “Patriarch of Alexandria and all Africa on the Holy Apostolic Throne of Saint Mark the Evangelist,” that is “of Alexandria and of all Africa.” The title of “patriarch” was first used around the time of the Third Ecumenical Council of Ephesus, convened in 431 AD, and ratified at Chalcedon in 451 AD.\n\nThe Bishop of Alexandria also has the title of \"archbishop.\" This is a natural jurisdictional title for the ecclesiastical dignity of the Bishop of Alexandria. Ruling as a \"metropolitan\", the bishop of the metropolis (i.e. Alexandria), had jurisdiction over the Roman Provinces of Egypt (Lower Egypt I and II, Arcadia Ægypti, Upper Egypt I and II (aka Thebais Prima and Thebais Secunda), Pentapolis, Libya and Nubia, which were at that time, the extent of the “Egyptian Provinces” within the Roman Empire. As set by the Ecumenical First Council of Nicaea 325 AD, the jurisdiction of the Archiepiscopate of Alexandria covered the above-mentioned provinces.\n\nBut since the demise of the Latin (Roman) North African Archiepiscopate of Carthage (which covered all of North and West Africa, apart from Egypt, Pentapolis and Libya) in the 8th century, Alexandria became the sole apostolic throne in the entire continent of Africa. The historical evangelization of the Apostolic Throne of Alexandria in Africa, apart from Egypt, Pentapolis, Libya, Nubia and the Sudan, does extend to:\n\nEthiopia:\n\nIt constituted a major archdiocese of the Church of Alexandria, which was always governed by an Egyptian patriarchal vicar in the rank of archbishop, and named Aboune Salama by the Ethiopian Church. By 1929, the Alexandrine Throne allowed the Ethiopian Clergy to participate in the governing of their own Church, and the first native Ethiopian archbishop was enthroned in 1930 (thus becoming an autonomous church).\n\nIn 1959, an agreement was reached between the Ethiopian Holy Synod and the Alexandrine throne to have their own patriarch-catholicos in a transitional period. The Ethiopian archbishop ordained as primate of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church back in 1950, was elevated by the Coptic Orthodox Pope of Alexandria Joseph II in Cairo and enthroned in Addis Ababa by the members of the Ethiopian Holy Synod and an Alexandrine delegation. The first prelate, Aboune Basilius I (1959–1971), patriarch-catholicos of Addis Ababa and all Ethiopia, was ordained and enthroned in 1959, by Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria.\n\nAboune Paulos I became the 5th patriarch of the Patriarchate of Addis Ababa and of all Ethiopia in 1992. This is after the patriarchates of Aboune Theophilus I (1971–1979) (deposed in a non-canonical way in 1976, sent to prison and murdered in prison in 1979), Aboune Thecla Hemanote I (1976–1988) (who was elected in a non-canonical manner by pressure of the then Communist government to replace his predecessor) and Abouna Mercurios I (1988–1991), (who resigned under pressure, due to the accusation of collaborating with the (Dereg) Menghistu Communist Regime, and who is now living in self-exile in Kenya).\n\nAboune Paulos I has requested from the Alexandrine throne complete independence to his patriarchate. The Patriarchate of Addis Ababa and all Ethiopia was granted its independence in 1994, by Shenouda III Pope and Patriarch of Alexandria, thus making the Patriarchate of Addis Ababa and all Ethiopia hierarchically and jurisdictionally independent “autocephalous patriarchate.”\n\nEritrea:\n\nWhose own prelate, Aboune Philipos I (1998–2002), Patriarch of Asmara and of all Eritrea, was ordained and enthroned in May 1998, by Pope Shenouda III Pope and Patriarch of Alexandria. This made the new Patriarchate of Asmara and of all Eritrea a hierarchically and jurisdictionally independent “autocephalous patriarchate.” The current prelate, Aboune Antonius I (2004– ), is the third Patriarch of Asmara and all Eritrea, who succeeded Yacob I (2003–2004), the second Patriarch of Asmara and all Eritrea. However, he was deposed non-canonically in January 2006, and replaced by Aboune Discoros I. This action is, however, not approved by the Alexandrine throne and is still under debate.\nThe Patriarchate of Addis Ababa and all Ethiopia and the Patriarchate of Asmara and all Eritrea are daughter Churches of the Holy Apostolic Patriarchate of Alexandria.\nIn addition to the above, the countries of Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe, the Congo, Cameroon, Nigeria, Ghana, Botswana, Malawi, Angola, Namibia and South Africa are under the jurisdiction and the evangelization of the Throne of Alexandria.\n\nThe Dean of the Great Catechetical School of Theology of Alexandria:\nThis is a customary title, which many patriarchs of Alexandria have held since the episcopacy of St. Justus (the 6th Bishop of Alexandria), and which was recently revived by Pope Shenouda III.\nThe Ecumenical Judge of the Holy Apostolic and Orthodox Church of God:\nThis was a title given to St. Alexander I (the 19th Archbishop of Alexandria), in honor of the canonical responsibilities bestowed upon the Primates of Alexandria thereafter, to determine the date of the Pascha, and to convey ecclesiastical letters of notification to all Hierarchies of the Universal Church, along with the Paschal encyclical. This was officially agreed upon and ratified at the Ecumenical First Council of Nicaea (325 AD).\nThe Thirteenth among the Holy Apostles:\nThis title was given to Athanasius I (the 20th Archbishop of Alexandria), in honor of his apostolic defiance against heresies, especially the Arian heresy. He was exiled five times before his final victory over them. He is known as \"The Apostolic,\" meaning that he reached the level of the Holy Apostles.\nThe Pillar and Defender of the Holy Catholic Church and of the Orthodox Doctrine:\nThis title was given to St. Cyril I, the Great (the 24th Archbishop of Alexandria) in memory of his defense against the Nestorian heresy and his defense of the Title of “Theotokos,\" attributed to the Virgin Mary.\nAll these hierarchical and honorary titles were bestowed upon the bishop who occupies the Holy Apostolic Throne of Alexandria.\n\nThe head of the church of Alexandria was known just as \"Bishop of Alexandria\" since the time of St. Ananius, the first Bishop of Alexandria, who was ordained by St. Mark the Evangelist and Holy Apostle, where the latter preached and evangelized in the City of Alexandria. The title remained simply \"bishop\" until the Church grew within and all over the Egyptian Province, and many bishops were consecrated for the newly founded parishes all over the towns and cities.\n\nThe Bishop of Alexandria, being the successor of the first bishop, the one who was first consecrated by St. Mark, was honored by the other bishops as first among equals \"(Primus inter Pares)\" as a means of church hierarchical recognition and organization. This was in addition to the appropriate honorary dignity, which was due by virtue of being the senior bishop of the main metropolis of the Province of Alexandria, being also the capital and the main port of the province.\n\nThis honor was bestowed by making the senior bishop an archbishop, thus presiding in dignity of honor over all the Alexandrine and Egyptian bishops. So was the case among other provinces in the Roman Empire East and West (Rome, Antioch, Jerusalem, Ephesus, Caesarea, Edessa, Seleucia and many others major metropolitanates), as the bishops of these major cities, and those who were presiding over the churches, which were first established within the region, became to be known as archbishops.\n\nThe word \"pope\" derives from Greek πάππας meaning \"father\". This title was first assumed by the Patriarchs of Alexandria, long before it was assumed by the Bishops of Rome. In fact, the first person known to carry the title of pope was the Archbishop of Alexandria, Pope Heracleus (232–249 AD), the 13th Alexandrine Archbishop.\n\nThe first record in history of the term \"pope\" is assigned to Pope Heraclas of Alexandria in a letter written by the bishop of Rome, Dionysius, to Philemon:\n\nwhich translates into:\n\"Papa\" has been the specific designation for the Archbishop of Alexandria, Patriarch of all Africa on the See of Saint Mark, whose ecclesiastic title is \"Papa Abba\", the Abba stands for the devotion of all monastics, from Pentapolis in the West to Constantinople in the East, to his guidance. Abba is the most powerful designation, that for all monks in the East to voluntarily follow his spiritual authority.\n\nThe Bishop of Carthage was also known as \"papas\" by the late 2nd and early 3rd centuries, most probably taken from Alexandria or from the common tradition of Pentapolis (under Alexandrine jurisdiction) as it was quite common to call the Senior Bishop of Alexandria and the Senior Bishop of Pentapolis (who was the second in importance and command after the Bishop of Alexandria and known as the Elder of Pentapolis) \"papas.\"\n\nIt is difficult to ascertain the identity of the first Bishop of Rome to carry the title Pope of Rome. Some sources suggest that it was Pope Marcellinus (died 304 AD), while other sources suggest that this did not happen until the 6th century, with Pope John I (523–526 AD) the first to assume this title. Bestowing the title on Rome's pontiff did not strip it from Alexandria's, and the Roman Catholic Church recognizes this.\n\nFrom the 6th century, the imperial chancery of Constantinople normally reserved this designation for the Bishop of Rome. From the early 6th century, it began to be confined in the West to the Bishop of Rome, a practice that was firmly in place by the 11th century, when Pope Gregory VII declared it reserved for the Bishop of Rome.\n\nBetween the Third Ecumenical Council of Ephesus (431 AD) and the Fourth Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon (451 AD), the archbishops of the Eastern and Western Roman Empires (i.e. the archbishops of Alexandria, Antioch, Rome, Constantinople, and Jerusalem, also known as the Archbishops of the Ancient Apostolic Thrones), were given the title of \"patriarch\". These titles were ratified at the Fourth Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon (451 AD), and henceforth were known historically as the Ancient Patriarchates of the Holy Catholic and Apostolic Orthodox Church or otherwise as the Pentarchy.\nThe Bishop of Alexandria was first known as the Bishop of Alexandria. Later, due to the importance and dignity of Alexandria as a major Christian center and as an Ancient Apostolic Throne, and in addition to the fact that the Bishop of Alexandria is the successor of the first Bishop on the Throne of Alexandria, he was given the title of archbishop by the late 3rd century. He was already called by the Alexandrine clergy and by all the Egyptian bishops \"papas,\" since the middle of the 3rd century.\nBy the middle of the 5th century, the title of \"patriarch\" was bestowed upon all major Apostolic thrones of the Holy Catholic, Apostolic and Orthodox Church (ratified by the Fourth Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon in 451 AD). By this title, it meant that these patriarchates have geographical jurisdiction based upon either the extent (domain) of the natural borders of their provinces, or as set by Church Ecumenical Councils and/or Church Tradition.\nLater, between the 5th and 7th century, the appellation of \"“papas”\" or \"“pope”\" became somehow a title along with the archiepiscopal and patriarchal titles of the Bishop of Alexandria. This, however, did not mean that the title of \"“pope”\" denoted a higher hierarchical or ecclesiastical dignity or rank than that of the title and rank of \"“patriarch”\" given to the Bishop of Alexandria.\n\nPatriarchal delegates known as \"Patriarchal Exarchs\" are designated for areas outside the region of the canonical jurisdiction of the Bishop of Alexandria, or any other throne that has set jurisdictional boundaries.\n\nIn this way, the Apostolic Exarchates are not in contradiction with the Canon Laws of the Church, but are considered “Embassies of the Patriarchate of Alexandria”, rather than “Jurisdictional Dioceses\" outside the defined canonical jurisdiction.\n\n\nUntil 1928, patriarchal elections were carried out according to oral and written Church tradition. The patriarchal election of 1928 was the first in modern history to invoke written bylaws. The elections of 1928, 1942 and 1946 inspired controversy by pitting relatively young monks versus older, more experienced bishops. Supporters of each group argued that the other should be disqualified: the advocates of the younger monks claimed that the bishops were wedded to their dioceses for life and that their election to the patriarchate would lead to an unnatural divorce of bishop and diocese, while the bishops' partisans countered that a bishop might continue to provide diocesan pastoral care from the apostolic throne, while observing that the pastoral experience of the more seasoned bishops would be indispensable to the patriarchate of the entire church; they further noted that the patriarchs of every other apostolic church, such as those of the Greek, Russian and Catholic churches, were nearly always bishops or abbots prior to election.\n\nThis controversy ultimately led to the development of a new set of bylaws in 1957. The bylaws state that a candidate for election to the Apostolic Throne of Alexandria must be a man of at least 40 years of age and must be a monk with at least 15 years of monastic service (in that Coptic bishops are always drawn from the ranks of monks), but he may be of any ecclesiastical rank: monk, hieromonk (monk priest or monk archpriest), abbot, or bishop.\n\nA potential candidate who meets the requirements of the bylaws must be endorsed by six bishops or twelve of the 24 members of the General Lay Council of the Church, a church governing body composed primarily of laypeople elected by the congregation to five year terms. A Nominations Committee is then formed by nine bishops appointed by the Holy Synod and nine laypersons elected by the General Community Council. The Nominations Committee, chaired by the locum tenens patriarch, narrows the field of candidates to a group of five or seven. Each diocese then contributes twelve electors to an Electoral College; their numbers are augmented by the members of The Holy Synod of the Coptic Orthodox Church, the General Community Council, Coptic Orthodox political leaders and journalists and envoys of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. The voting of the Electoral College results in a ranking of the remaining five or seven candidates, and the three highest-ranked candidates advance to the final stage of the selection process.\n\nThe name of each candidate is written on a slip of paper in a box placed on the altar of St. Mark Cathedral in Cairo during a Sunday eucharistic liturgy presided over by the locum tenens of the throne, and attended by all members of the Holy Synod, General Congregation Council and the laity. A five-year-old child selected from the congregation then draws a slip, sight unseen, from the box; the name it bears determines the next Patriarch.\n\nThe last three Coptic Popes were selected in this manner: Cyril VI in 1959, Shenouda III in 1971, and Tawadros II in 2012.\n\nThe duties of the Coptic Orthodox pope, apart from his diocesan duties, are:\n\n\nFurther reading on traditions and procedures for electing the patriarch may be found at:\n\n"}

McVey ranked alongside Jack Johnson, Joe Jeanette, Sam Langford, and Harry Wills as the top black heavyweights of their generation. All of them, except Johnson, was denied a shot at the world heavyweight championship due to the color bar, which ironically was maintained by Johnson when he became the first black fighter to win the world heavyweight title. Despite being denied a title shot, McVea enjoyed a famed career that took him across the globe.\n\nIn 96 documented fights in at least 10 different countries, McVey only lost 16 bouts. His greatest wins include two victories over both Sam Langford and Harry Wills, which won him the World Colored Heavyweight Championship on two separate occasions, respectively. In his later, years he worked as a trainer and sparring partner for both black and white fighters training for important bouts.\n\nFighting out of Oxnard, California, McVey stood 5′10½″ inches tall and fought at a weight of between 205 and 220 lbs. He relied more on brute strength than finesse in the ring. His first pro fight listed on boxrec took place in 1902 at the age of 18, but a newspaper from 1902, on his then-upcoming fight with Jack Fogarty, lists five earlier fights he won in Australia, and a further two that took place in California. However In those days, few mixed-race fights took place, so McVey frequently fought the other top black boxers of his time, including Sam Langford (15 times), Joe Jeanette (5 times), Harry Wills (5 times), and Jack Johnson (3 times). Overall, McVey's boxing record was 65 wins, 16 losses, and 12 draws.\n\nMcVey spent much of his prime years fighting overseas. He left for Paris in 1907 and fought there for four years. McVey left Paris in 1911 for Australia. He fought there for three more years before finally returning to the U.S.\n\nOn December 31, 1908 in Paris, Sam McVey competed in a mixed style bout against jujutsu expert Tano Matsuda, knocking him out in ten seconds. In the earlier part of this century, such bouts were occasionally held in Japan pitting western boxers against judo or jujutsu fighters.\n\nOn April 17, 1909, in Paris, Sam McVey fought Joe Jeanette in a bout considered one of the greatest and certainly one of the longest of the 20th century. The fight went 50 rounds and lasted three and a half hours. McVey was generally agreed to be winning through most of the fight, particularly the 21st and 22nd round, knocking Jeanette down repeatedly. By the 40th round, however, Jeanette had recovered while McVey was lagging and knocked down repeatedly. Ultimately McVey's eyes had swollen shut and he was forced to quit.\n\nIn 1912, McVey was one of the contenders for the World Colored Heavyweight Championship fought at various venues across Australia. Sam Langford his opponent, was a Black Canadian popularly known as the Boston Tar Baby and reputedly one of the greatest fighters of all time, beating champions in the lightweight to heavyweight classes. \nBefore the matches, the boxers gave demonstrations of their skill. Before his beating, Sam McVea in the Exhibition Rink Buildings in Perth, Sam Langford stayed at the Nedlands Park Hotel where he:\n\nMcVey contracted pneumonia and died December 23, 1921, in New York City, penniless while still an active fighter. His burial and grave marker was paid for by Jack Johnson.\n\nMcVey was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1999.\n"}

He continued reprising the role of Lemmy Caution well into his 70s; his final appearance as the character was in Jean-Luc Godard's \"Germany Year 90 Nine Zero\" (1991).\n\nIsraël Constantine was born in Los Angeles to Jewish immigrant parents, a Russian father and Polish mother; his father was a jeweller. In pursuit of a singing career, he went to Vienna for voice training, but when he returned to America his career didn't take off and he started taking work as a film extra. Having failed to make a career in America, Constantine returned to Europe in the early 1950s and started singing and performing in Parisian cabarets. He was noticed by Edith Piaf, who cast him in the musical \"La p'tite Lili\". Constantine also helped Piaf with translations for her 1956 album \"La Vie en Rose/Édith Piaf Sings In English\", so that he has songwriting credits on the English versions of some of her most famous songs (especially \"Hymne à l'amour\"/\"Hymn to Love\").\n\nIn the 1950s Constantine was a star in France due to his role as the hard-boiled detective/secret agent Lemmy Caution (from Peter Cheyney's novels) in a series of French B-pictures, including \"La môme vert-de-gris\" (1953), \"Cet homme est dangereux\" (1953), \"Ça va barder\" (1953), \"Je suis un sentimental\" (1955), \"Lemmy pour les dames\" (1961) and \"Your Turn, Darling\" (1963).\n\nWhen not playing Lemmy Caution, Constantine's character would still typically be a suave-talking, seductive, smooth guy, although he often played this for laughs. He turned his accent and perceived American cockiness to advantage in such roles, and later described his film persona as having been \"James Bond before James Bond\".\n\nOne of his most notable roles was in Jean-Luc Godard's \"Alphaville\" (1965), in which he reprised (to a more radical end) the role of Lemmy Caution, in a departure from the style of his other films. His box-office appeal in France waned in the mid-1960s. Having remarried to a German television producer, he eventually relocated to Germany, where he worked as a character actor, appearing in German TV dramas as well as film. Constantine later claimed he had never taken his acting career seriously, as he considered himself to be a singer by trade, and had been an actor strictly for the money. He nevertheless worked with directors including Godard and Rainer Werner Fassbinder, and his last notable film appearance was in Lars Von Trier's \"Europa\" in 1991. He had taken up the part of Lemmy for the last time in the same year, in Godard's experimental film \"Germany Year 90 Nine Zero\".\n\nConstantine was married three times, to Helene Musil (1942-1976, divorced), with whom he had three children, Dorothea Gibson (1977, divorced), and the film producer Maya Faber-Jansen (1979–1993, Constantine's death), with whom he had one child. His daughter Tanya Constantine, born in 1943, is a photographer. His daughter Barbara Constantine, born in 1955, is a writer. His son Lemmy Constantine, born in 1957, is also a singer and actor. His daughter Mia Constantine, born in 1981, is a theater director.\n\nEddie Constantine died of a heart attack on February 25, 1993, aged 79.\n\n"}
{"id": "2211269", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2211269", "title": "Transgender people in Singapore", "text": "Transgender people in Singapore\n\nThe history and subculture surrounding transgender people in Singapore is substantial. Not immediately apparent to Singapore's mainstream society is the fact that the gay community sees itself as a totally separate entity from the transgender communities (often also referred to as \"transvestite and transsexual\" communities). They are individual subcultures with many different priorities and concerns.\n\nNational service was implemented in 1967, whereby all 18-year-old males were required to train full-time for two or two-and-a-half years, depending on their educational attainment. Transgender was listed as a condition in a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) 'Directory of Diseases' and recruits who outed themselves to the examining doctors at the Central Manpower Base (CMPB) at Depot Road had their 'deployability' denied in sensitive positions. They were classified as Category 302 personnel, downgraded to a Physical Employment Status of C or E and assigned only non-combat roles at military bases.\n\n\"Transgender individuals who have undergone sex reassignment surgery (SRS) are able to skip National Service entirely. However due to the difficulty of transitioning early, only a very small percentage of transsexuals in Singapore are actually able to obtain SRS before having to enter National Service.\nIn rare cases, it's possible for transgender people to be exempted from National Service despite not undergoing sex reassignment surgery. However this is mostly up to the medical-officer in charge and varies case by case. In general, transsexuals that look like cisgender females have a much higher chance of being exempted.\"\nAs Singaporean gynaecological surgeons became more skilful, leaders in the field like Prof. S Shan Ratnam were authorised to perform Sex reassignment surgery male-to-female (SRS) at Kandang Kerbau Hospital. The first such operation in Asia took place in Singapore in July 1971. However, before patients could go under the knife, they first had to subject themselves to an exhaustive battery of tests and be given a clean psychological bill of health by chief academic psychiatrist Prof. Tsoi Wing Foo.\n\n\"In 1973, Singapore legalised sex-reassignment surgery. A policy was instituted to enable post-operative transsexual people to change the legal gender on their identity cards (but not their birth certificates) and other documents which flowed from that. There was no specific provision in the statutes which allowed the Registrar to do this, so it existed probably only at the level of a policy directive. However, for over 20 years, this policy seemed to have operated smoothly.\"\n\nLater, the more technically demanding sex reassignment surgery female-to-male was also offered at Kandang Kerbau Hospital and at Alexandra Hospital, performed by gynaecologists such as Dr. Ilancheran. A Gender Identity Clinic (GIC) and Gender Reassignment Surgery Clinic were set up at the National University Hospital two decades later. It was headed by Prof. S Shan Ratnam until his retirement in 1995, after which leadership passed to his nephew, Dr. Anandakumar. In fact, for 30 years, Singapore was one of the world leaders in SRS, performing more than 500 such operations. This gave a new lease on life to the many transgender individuals whose bodies did not match their gender identity. As one consequence of this, Bugis Street and Johore Road started to become populated with a range of transgender people from transvestites to iatrogenic intersex individuals to fully transformed women.\n\nIn the 1970s, a well-known transsexual model was occasionally featured in Her World magazine.\n\nSince the mid-1970s, post-operative transsexual people had been discreetly lobbying to be given the right to marry opposite-sex spouses. In 1996, a bill was presented before the Parliament of Singapore and the Women's Charter amended to read:\n\nThe minister moving the bill argued that since 1973, the government's intention was for people who had changed gender/sex to live a life according to their new gender, including the right to marry. Through an oversight, the law relating to marriage had not been re-aligned with the official policy to recognise sex reassignment surgery. Now that the courts had illuminated this inconsistency after a landmark case in which a woman sought and won the annulment of her marriage to a trans man (Lim Ying v Hiok Kian Ming Eric), it was necessary to amend the Women's Charter to ensure that the original intent was not undermined. Transgender people were officially granted their wish on 24 January 1996 via an announcement by MP Abdullah Tarmugi without much public fanfare or opposition.\n\nThe Gender Identity Clinic (GIC) at the National University Hospital quietly closed in 2001. The official explanation was that the gynaecologist in charge had left for private practice, and without him, the clinic did not have the skills to perform SRS. However, as early as 1987, the Ministry of Health had been directing hospitals to stop doing such operations on foreigners. It also discouraged them for Singaporeans, saying 'the increased danger of AIDS with such patients poses unnecessary risk to hospital staff'.\n\nThis dismayed transgender people seeking to have their operations performed locally. The online edition of the now-defunct newspaper Project Eyeball carried out a survey in June 2001 asking, \"Should sex-change operations be resumed in Singapore?\" 39% of respondents said, \"Yes, they are people with valid medical needs, like infertile couples\" and 35% said, \"Why not? It is legal here, as are transsexual marriages\". The results showed that Singaporeans were generally quite supportive.\n\nThe transgender community petitioned for the GIC to be reopened and were successful, with the clinic discreetly resuming its services in 2003, helmed by Dr. Ilancheran. However, owing to the discrimination against transgender people in Singapore even within some segments of the medical community, the high financial outlay involved and the necessity for psychological clearance, many preferred to have their operations performed sans the hassles in Bangkok, which had by then become the première centre for SRS.\n\nOne of Singapore's most famous tourist meccas since the 1950s, renowned internationally for its nightly parade of flamboyantly dressed trans women, Bugis Street attracted hordes of Caucasian gawkers who had never witnessed Asian queens in full regalia.\n\nThe latter would tease, cajole and sit on visitors' laps or pose for photographs for a fee. The amount of revenue that they raked in was considerable, providing a shot in the arm for the tourism industry. Veterans recall that the notorious drinking section began at Victoria Street, and proceeded west to Queen Street. Halfway between Victoria and Queen Streets, there was an intersecting lane parallel to the main roads, also lined with \"al fresco\" bars. There was a well-patronised public toilet with a flat roof of which there are archival photos, complete with jubilant rooftop trans women. The earliest published description of Bugis Street found by Yawning Bread as a place of great gender diversity was in the book \"Eastern Windows\" by Ommaney, F.D. (1960. London:Longmans. pp. 39–45). Ommaney did not date specifically his description of the street, but his book made clear that he was in Singapore from 1955 to 1960.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Bugis Street underwent major urban redevelopment into a retail complex of modern shopping malls, restaurants and nightspots mixed with regulated back-alley roadside vendors. Underground digging to construct the Bugis MRT station prior to that also caused the upheaval and termination of the nightly transgender sex bazaar culture, marking the end of a colourful and unique era in Singapore's history. Tourist and local lamentation of the loss sparked attempts by the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (STPB) to attempt to recreate some of the old sleazy splendour by staging contrived \"Ah Qua shows\" on wooden platforms, but these artificial performances failed to pull in the crowds. They were abandoned after a short time.\n\nBugis Street was immortalised in an English-language film of the same name, made, ironically, by a Hong Kong film company which did employ some local talent in its production.\n\nFormerly located between and parallel to Queen Street and Victoria Street, and bisected by Ophir Road, Johore Road was the less well-known cousin of its glamorous counterpart, Bugis Street, just a stone's throw away. It was the seedy haunt of transgender sex workers who solicited sex from locals, away from the glare of Western tourists. No photographs or media attention were focused on this street of ill-repute; only a no-frills approach to an economic exchange.\n\nIt was one of the few roads to be completely erased from the map of Singapore after a fire in the late 90s, to be replaced by an unnamed park next to the Bugis MRT station and the Victoria Street Wholesale Centre.\n\nBoom Boom Room was Singapore's only drag queen cabaret nightclub and thought by many also to be Singapore's only real national institution in the same uninhibited spirit as the original Bugis Street. It is the namesake of John Lee Hooker's legendary blues club in San Francisco, shooting to international fame when the postmodernist magazine \"Wallpaper\" called it \"our top pick for a good night out in all of Asia!\"\n\nOriginally established by owner Alan Koh in 1993 at 4 New Bugis Street in Bugis Village, it later relocated on 2 April 2000 to the second floor of the old 2-storey Chui Eng Free School schoolhouse at 130–132 Amoy Street, Far East Square (10 min walk from the Raffles Place MRT station). The new venue, which was reputed to have the best Singapore Sling in town, had a restaurant downstairs for informal and outdoor dining.\n\nIts overwhelming attraction were the risqué comedy routines by local drag superstar Kumar who took no-holds-barred digs at topics close to the hearts of Singaporeans. He was aided by his coterie of flamboyant, dazzlingly costumed, cross-dressing backups, nubile toyboys and other straight stand-up comedian friends.\n\nThe first performance debuted on 18 August 2000. There were 2 shows each night and outrageous wisecracks, in raw Singlish which made the banter difficult for tourists to understand, were interspersed with DJs playing the latest chart tunes. Members of the audience sitting next to the stage ran the highest risk of being drawn into the performance. It was patronised by a largely heterosexual audience who danced wildly during the intervals, but Tuesday nights were gay with access only granted to password holders.\n\nIt closed after 12 years on 15 January 2005, reportedly to enable its artists to move on to fresh creative pursuits. However, many thought other reasons were that the shows were getting stale, the drag queens were getting old (Kumar was 36) with no fresh blood to carry the torch and the existing ones not having what it took, and the club's poor location. It spawned a spoof version called the Bang Bang Room at Changi Village which held late night performances every weekend.\n\nA well-known area for men seeking the services of cisgender women sex workers in the Serangoon or Little India area for decades, it attracted many transgender sex workers from nearby Johore Road after the latter was erased from the map by a fire in the late 1990s.\n\nUnlike their cisgender female government-regulated counterparts who are on display, usually seated on armchairs or sofas in well-lit rooms, reminiscent of a low-class back-lane version of Amsterdam, the trans women of Desker Road, in contrast, cruise while standing or strolling. This is done to render their activities, which are considered illegal, less vulnerable to vice squad raids. The seedy atmosphere of the whole vicinity has largely disappeared due to massive redevelopment around Mustafa Centre.\n\nChangi Village has been popular with trans women since the early 1990s and the straight men who go there to ogle at them, chat them up or use their services.\n\nLocated on level 2 of the rear block of Orchard Towers along Orchard Road, it is Singapore's second drag queen cabaret nightclub, a joint venture between Kumar, and partner Gwen Khoo, who also owns the 3 Monkeys Restaurant in Orchard Towers. Together, they spent $50,000 to open the venue in July 2005, six months after the closure of Boom Boom Room.\n\nAiming for the high-end market, Gold Dust boasts professional dancers with flamboyant mardi gras-type costumes, and women dancing alongside drag performers. Kumar's trademark provocative jokes are still the main focus, but now framed in a classier and more streamlined show. Kumar aims to capture the cozy feel and stylish look of New York City-style theatre bars. Thus, the club has no dance floor and all the chairs and tables face the stage. It can hold 180 people, and has the feel of a 1970s glam disco, updated for the new generation. Instead of young National Servicemen and students, who formed a significant part of the Boom Boom Room clientele, Gold Dust intends to target a slightly more upper-crust crowd.\n\nThe main aim of the theatre bar is to showcase talent. In addition to the cabaret dances and stand-up comedy staples, it is considering expanding the shows to include mime, monologues, plays and singing. Partner Kumar decided to open the venture because he needed a steady income stream, as well as a home base for his stand-up performances. Although the bar is located in the back block of Orchard Towers where Harry's Bar and Jason's supermarket reside, some felt that the idea of a bar next to the infamous '4 floors of whores' may not appeal to some patrons. However, Kumar felt that Orchard Towers was always known to be a controversial place, and since he was also a controversial performer who pushed the boundaries, it made sense for the bar to be based there.'\n\nFor the first time, Kumar's show incorporates two female professional dancers, Samantha Kan and Aslinda. There were only male dancers at the Boom Boom Room. He always felt that the latter was lacking something and now he realised that it was girls.\n\nChinatown Caberat is a drag queen cabaret opened in 2006 by entrepreneur Max Lim at Ann Siang Hill.\n\n\nThere is far less information available on trans men in Singapore.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2211273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2211273", "title": "Thirunamam", "text": "Thirunamam\n\nThirunamam represents the 'Sacred name of God'. The phrase Namam also represents the white clay found at the deeper layer of earth, which is used as the powder to wear a flame shaped mark. The Ayyavazhi people wore this Namam, starting from the central point between the eyebrows, going straight up near the top edge of the forehead.\n\nThe flame shape represents \"Aanma Jyothi\" or Atman. Which in turn means that, Aatman is considered sacred and as the name of God. Zealous devotees smeared it on the exterior of the upper arms, over the chest and below the spinal cord area at the back.\n\nThis white mark was unlike the one worn by a Hindu of Vaishnavism tradition who wore it on the forehead in the shape of 'U', or of Saivism tradition who wore it horizontally as three parallel lines. This Thirunamam is also called as \"Tottu Namam\" and \"Thiruman\".\n\nIn the nineteenth century Travancore society, the social setup is highly marked for the discriminative hierarchical caste order and the inhumanities unfold from this, such as untouchability, \"unseeability\" and \"unapproachability\" accordingly some people were shunned from the public approach and sight. This caste based social reality is transformed into a religious institution. The then political faculties duly safeguarded this order. Even in temple the priests while handing over the \"Prasadam\" (a ritual object) to devotees after worship, they approach freely with the higher castes, whose nearness and touch would not pollute them, and use to throw the Prasadam on to a platform from where the lower caste devotee (whose touch may pollute him) has to collect this.\n\nIn such a social conscience, the alternative form of ritual marking 'Tottu Namam' generated. The very name 'Tottu Namam' says the meaning, 'a mark with a personal touch'. In Ayyavazhi universe primarily, Ayya Vaikundar seems to have personally touched the forehead of followers and worn it for them.\nThis dimension of personal touch stood out to the public eye and was much appreciated by the then society. It presented itself to be a symbolic site wherein new and alternative modes of social relations were proposed, forged and legitimated. It recast the priest-devotee relationship to bear upon the social reality of the time.\n\nThe alternative relationship and close contact brought up by this ritual practice meant a reversal of the hierarchical social relationship and discrimination based on purity and pollution. In other words, with the under-lying ritual ambience, this 'Tottu Namam' acted fast against the caste based and other inequalities prevalent in the then Travancore Kingdom and Tamil society.\n\nUnder sociology, the then 'social discriminative force' is termed as the evil spirit of Kali. And this \"Kali\" is said to be get destroyed by the ritual practise of wearing 'Thiru Namam'. The break-point of social hierarchy is channeled in a religious way.\n\nUnlike the social definition for this ritual practice, the religious or ritual importance for Thirunamam fits to all period of time. Sociologically, while this practice is a basic need, to reform a society (19th century Travancore), religiously the same is performed just with a religious belief. The religious definition for the practice 'Tottu Namam' is as The Name of God. The Atman is assumed to be in a flame shape and it as the name of God. That is, the Atman is God and the supreme self.\n\nIt was religiously taught that, one who pay extreme belief over Vaikundar will be turned of to the name of God (Atman). And hence the 'purified jeeva' is an Absolute Atman or God. Also the Thirunamam is smeared between the 'central point of the eyebrows' where the Ajna Chakra is situated. This chakra is viewed in relation to the Kali Yuga of the 'Eight yuga circle' as per Ayyavazhi scriptures. Since the present yuga is the Kali, the 'Thiru Namam' or the name of God is to be smeared there in Ajna (place of Kali) for purifying the Jeevas from \"Kali\" in order to attain the sacred feet of God. (i.e.)Wearing the gods name purifies the jeevas and transform them to the absolute self.\n\nPresently this practise is considered as the primary ritual to be performed in Pathis and Thangals. Those who 'serve' in every Pathis or Nizhal Thangals, wear this white mark for the people and give a portion of it in their hands. People carry it home as holy object, and some of them even swallow a little of it believing it to be medicinal. The 'Thiru mun' (sacred soil) for preparing the Thiru Namam is collected from Swamithope pathi for Nizhal Thangals after conducting the Pothippu. But some Thangals prepare them as their own.\n\nAkilam, the primary scripture too accredit this ritual practice to be ceremonial and sacred. And it was practiced and treated with high religious importance and as the primary ritual from the celebration conducted in Swamithope pathi even during the period of Vaikundar. The secondary scripture Arul Nool too refers that, Ayya personally touched the devotees and wore Thirunamam for them.\n\nSince Vaikundar used ordinary soil as 'Thiru Namam' during his Tavam (austerity) period, ordinary soil is kept there now in alternative of the white soil in the Vatakku Vasal, where Ayya performed the Tavam.\n\nThis Thirunaman, a white flame-shaped mark, is treated as the symbol of Ayyavazhi since the 1940s and then the present symbol \"Lotus and Namam\" was accepted as the symbol. Even in the present symbol the Thirunamam is used with the same religious definition as the Atman. \n\nIn Ayyavazhi symbolism this Atman is placed above Sahasrara which is symbolised as Namam above Lotus. It shows that, the Atman reaches the state of supreme self or becomes unified with the supreme Ekam, when it reaches Sahasrara after moving towards the seven other chakras.\n\nSome Nizhal Thangals use this symbol Thirunamam as building architecture. Mostly all Thangals use to mount the symbol at the top either with a lotus or not.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2211274", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2211274", "title": "At Close Range", "text": "At Close Range\n\nAt Close Range is a 1986 American neo-noir crime drama film directed by James Foley, based on the real life rural Pennsylvania crime family led by Bruce Johnston Sr. which operated during the 1960s and 1970s. It stars Sean Penn and Christopher Walken, with Mary Stuart Masterson, Sean's brother Chris Penn, David Strathairn, Crispin Glover, Kiefer Sutherland, and Eileen Ryan in supporting roles. Madonna both sang and co-wrote the song “Live to Tell” which features in the film's soundtrack.\n\nBrad Whitewood Sr. is a career criminal and the leader of his family's gang of rural back-door criminals. The film chronicles the intersection of Sr's criminal enterprises with his son, Brad Whitewood Jr., who starts out as a floundering, out-of-work teenager living in near squalor with his mother, grandmother, brother and mother's boyfriend. When his father shows up in a flashy car with a pocket full of hundred dollar bills, Brad Jr. formulates a desire to join his father's life of crime. At first Jr. starts a gang with his brother, Tommy, fencing their stolen goods through Brad Sr.'s criminal network. As a result of entanglements with his 16-year-old girlfriend, Terry, Brad Jr. seeks full entry into his father's gang, but after witnessing a murder he tries to back out. Eventually Brad Jr's gang is arrested while attempting to steal tractors, and the FBI and local law enforcement attempt to lean on Brad Jr. to get him to turn evidence on his father's gang.\n\nDuring Brad Jr.'s time in jail, Brad Sr. becomes convinced that Terry is a risk to his activities, thinking that Brad Jr. may confide details to Terry and that she has a big mouth. In an attempt to destroy her relationship with Brad Jr., Brad Sr. rapes Terry after getting her drunk and stoned. After a prison visit where Terry, accompanied by Brad Jr's mother, has an inaudible conversation with Brad Jr., it appears that Brad Jr. begins to cooperate with the police. The members of Brad Jr's gang are subpoenaed, and Brad Sr. feels his only recourse is to eliminate them. Brad Jr. and Terry plan to flee to Montana, but they are ambushed. Terry is killed, and Brad Jr. is seriously wounded. Brad Jr. confronts his father armed with his father's gun, but decides instead to cooperate with police. The film ends with a close up of Brad Jr. on the witness stand.\n\n\nThe movie, while depicting incidents in Chester County and Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, was actually filmed in Franklin, Tennessee and Spring Hill, Tennessee.\n\nMusic for the film was composed by Patrick Leonard, who had been working on an instrumental theme for \"Fire with Fire\", and wanted to enlist Madonna for the vocals. Leonard was turned down by Paramount for that project, but Madonna, who was at the time married to Sean Penn, decided that the theme would work well for \"At Close Range\". She composed the lyrics and presented a demo cassette to director James Foley, and suggested Leonard compose the film's soundtrack. The theme with Madonna's lyrics became the single \"Live to Tell\". A slower instrumental version opened the film's main title sequence, a harbinger of the end credit sequence, which was accompanied by the version from Madonna's album \"True Blue\". Versions of the instrumental show up throughout. The instrumental score by Leonard remained unreleased until a version of the main titles appeared on the Internet in 2014, although the 45 single of \"Live to Tell\" included a B-side incomplete instrumental version of the score, and DJ A!O released a seven-minute instrumental suite of Leonard's film arrangement prior to 2008 on Sp!n.\n\nThe official soundtrack to the film included a number of singles from the 1970s decade, including \"Miss You\" by The Rolling Stones, \"Boogie Oogie Oogie\" by A Taste of Honey, as well as a number of arrangements featuring LeRoux.\n\nRoger Ebert gave the \"At Close Range\" 3½ (out of 4) stars, noting that \"few recent films have painted such a bleak picture of human nature\". He described Penn as \"probably the best of the younger actors\", while lauding Walken's \"hateful\" performance.\n\nAt Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 87% based on 23 reviews, with an average score of 7.2/10. It holds a score of 67 out of 100 on Metacritic from 9 appraisals, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\nDespite the accolades and warm reviews, the film was not a box office success. It grossed a total of $2,347,000 at the North American box office during its theatrical run in 83 theaters, earning less than its production budget of $6.5 million.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2211286", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2211286", "title": "Lager Sylt", "text": "Lager Sylt\n\nLager Sylt was a Nazi concentration camp on Alderney in the British Crown Dependency in the Channel Islands. Built in 1942, along with three other labour camps by the Organisation Todt, the control of \"Lager Sylt\" changed from March 1943 to June 1944 when it was run by the Schutzstaffel - SS-Baubrigade 1 and \"Lager Sylt\" became a subcamp of the Neuengamme concentration camp (located in Hamburg, Germany).\n\nEach Alderney camp was named after one of the Frisian Islands: Lager Norderney located at Saye, Lager Helgoland at Platte Saline, \"Lager Sylt\" near the old telegraph tower at La Foulère and Lager Borkum, situated near the Impot. Two of these camps were the only Nazi concentration camps on British soil.\n\nThe \"Borkum\" and \"Helgoland\" camps were \"volunteer\" (Hilfswillige) labour camps and the labourers in those camps were treated harshly but better than the inmates at the \"Sylt\" and \"Norderney\" camps and were paid for work done. \"Lager Borkum\" was used for German technicians and volunteers from different countries of Europe. \"Lager Helgoland\" was filled with Russian Organisation Todt workers. (For further information on Alderney camps, see \"Appendix F: Concentration Camps: Endlösung – The Final Solution\"; \"Alderney, a Nazi concentration camp on an island Anglo-Norman\".)\n\nToday, little remains of the camp. Three gateposts to the rear of the island's airport mark the entrance; one has had a commemorative plaque attached. Some ruins remain, including a number of sentry posts, some foundations and a small tunnel, which led from the camp commandant's house to the inside of the camp. The commandant's house was later moved to another part of the island.\n\nIt was built by the Organisation Todt (OT) in January 1942 by and for their forced labourers who would be employed in building fortifications including bunkers, gun emplacements, air-raid shelters and tunnels.\n\n\"Sylt camp\" held Jewish enforced labourers. The prisoners in \"Lager Sylt\" and \"Lager Norderney\" were slave labourers forced to build the many military fortifications and installations throughout Alderney. \"Norderney camp\" housed European (usually Eastern but including Republican Spaniard) and Russian enforced labourers.\n\nThe \"Lager Sylt\" commandant, Karl Tietz, had a black French colonial as an under officer. Shocked to see a black man beating up white men from the camp, a German naval officer threatened to shoot him if he saw him doing it again. Tietz was brought before a court-martial in April 1943 and sentenced to 18 months penal servitude for the crime of selling cigarettes, watches and other valuables he had bought from Dutch OT workers on the black market.\n\nIt was taken over by the Schutzstaffel – SS-Baubrigade I, which was first under supervision of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp; from mid-February 1943 it ran under the Neuengamme camp in northern Germany, located near the old telegraph tower at La Foulère. It was used by the Organisation Todt, a forced labour programme, to build bunkers, gun emplacements, air-raid shelters, and concrete fortifications on the island.\n\nAlderney has been nicknamed \"the island of silence\", because little is known about what occurred there during the occupation. The German officer left in charge of the facilities, Commandant Oberst Schwalm, burned the camps to the ground and destroyed all records connected with their use before the island was liberated by British forces on 16 May 1945. The German garrison on Alderney surrendered a week after the other Channel Islands, and was one of the last garrisons to surrender in Europe. The population were not allowed to start returning until December 1945.\n\nOver 700 of the OT workers are said to have lost their lives in Alderney, or in shipping that was sunk; the remaining inmates transferred to France in 1944.\n\nThe States (Alderney's governing body) decline to commemorate the sites of the four labour camps. Local historian Colin Partridge feels this may be due to the locals' desire to dissociate themselves from the accusations of collaboration. A faded memorial plate, tucked away behind the island's parish church, vaguely mentions 45 Soviet citizens who died on Alderney in 1940–1945, without saying how they died and why.\n\n\n"}

Canadian Lawyer named him one of the 25 most influential lawyers in Canada in 2011, 2012, and 2013.\n\nGeist has received widespread public attention from mainstream and citizen media for leading the public response to Canadian copyright law.\n\nAccording to Geist, in 2007, proposed Canadian legislation included the worst aspects of the 1998 U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). In December 2007, Geist said the legislation will likely \"mirror the DMCA with strong anti-circumvention legislation—far beyond what is needed to comply with the WIPO Internet treaties\", and will likely contain no protection for \"flexible fair dealing. No parody exception. No time shifting exception. No device shifting exception. No expanded backup provision. Nothing.\"\n\nWidespread online and offline support, from activist and author Cory Doctorow to over 90,000 Facebook users, led to the tabling of the copyright legislation by Industry Minister Jim Prentice until 2008.\n\nGeist has continued to play a prominent role on copyright in Canada, with numerous articles, speeches, books, and appearances before House of Commons and Senate committees on the subject. In December 2010, he wrote a paper titled \"Clearing Up the Copyright Confusion: Fair Dealing and Bill C-32\" where he summarizes and critically examines some of the main issues of this bill.\n\nThen in October 2011, when the Canadian government began attempts to pass a new bill on copyright reform, which included digital lock rules, called Bill C-11, he wrote \"The Daily Digital Lock Dissenter\" on his blog. This was a daily blog entry where he introduced former submissions to the government about how Canadians felt about the restrictive digital lock regulations in regard to Bill C-32 and based on the 2009 national copyright consultation. He argued that while Bill C-11 had some valid points, it was too restrictive because it did not take a balanced approach and it was \"primarily about satisfying U.S. pressure, not public opinion\".\n\nGeist is considered an expert about the intellectual property and digital trade issues associated with trade agreements such as the failed international Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), which he covered frequently on his blog, criticizing the negotiation process for lack of transparency and warning of possible negative consequences for Internet users. He was similarly active in assessing the implications of the Trans Pacific Partnership and reforms to NAFTA, later called the USMCA.\n\nIn 2011, Geist criticized the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission's (CRTC) history of inability to foster an atmosphere of competition that would allow third-party internet service providers (ISPs) to gain a foothold in the Canadian market. He did note, with the CRTC's usage based oral hearing on July 19, 2011, that they were making efforts to address this lack of competition and criticized Bell Canada and other major companies for their involvement in limiting smaller ISPs. \nAlso in 2011, he wrote a study on the true transport costs of a gigabyte for a Canadian consumer from an ISP and concluded it was roughly a total of eight cents per gigabyte but this report was later denounced by the major ISPs, most notably Bell Canada.\n\nGeist has been a vocal supporter of net neutrality in Canada, writing widely on the subject and frequently discussing the issue in the mainstream media. In 2017, he appeared before the House of Commons Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics to explain the key concerns to Members of Parliament.\n\nGeist is one of Canada's leading advocates on privacy protection. He is the editor of the \"Canadian Privacy Law Review\" and served on the Privacy Commissioner of Canada's Expert Advisory Board. He is the editor of the 2015 book, \"Law, Privacy and Surveillance in Canada in the Post-Snowden Era.\" He has regularly appeared before House of Commons committees to discuss privacy and potential reforms.\n\nIn 2018, Geist was a leading voice opposed to a proposal to establish a website blocking system in Canada to be overseen by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission. He wrote dozens of widely cited posts on concerns with the proposal. The CRTC rejected the proposal on jurisdictional grounds in October 2018.\n\n\nGeist has received numerous awards for his work.

{"id": "2211288", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2211288", "title": "Taenia pisiformis", "text": "Taenia pisiformis\n\nTaenia pisiformis, commonly called the rabbit tapeworm, is an endoparasitic tapeworm which causes infection in lagomorphs, rodents, and carnivores. Adult \"T. pisiformis\" typically occur within the small intestines of the definitive hosts, the carnivores. Lagomorphs, the intermediate hosts, are infected by fecal contamination of grasses and other food sources by the definitive hosts. The larval stage is often referred to as \"Cysticercus pisiformis\" and is found on the livers and peritoneal cavities of the intermediate hosts. \"T. pisiformis\" can be found worldwide.\n\n\"T. pisiformis\" typically infect dogs and other carnivores such as coyotes and foxes. In rabbits, \"T. pisiformis\" larvae attach themselves to the liver and intestines, forming cysts in diameter. This is referred to as cysticercosis.\n\nIn adult \"T. pisiformis\", the long hooks of the scolex are on average and the short hooks are . The dimensions of the suckers are . They can have from 34 to 38 hooks, which can be up to in length. Adult \"T. pisiformis\" can grow between .\n\nThe intermediate host is represented by hares and rabbits, in which are found the mesacestoide (the larval stage) known as cysticercus pisiformis. This is found in the peritoneum of the intermediate host and can be ingested by the definite host when the dog or cat feeds on the viscera of such an infected intermediate.\n\nEggs are introduced into the environment through infected canine feces. In the feces are the gravid proglottids that house the \"T. pisiformis\" eggs that will eventually be released form the proglottid onto nearby vegetation. The eggs are then ingested by a rabbit or from any member of the \"Leporidae\" family. Once inside the rabbit's gut the larva or oncosphere phase will then penetrate into the intestinal wall until they reach the blood stream. When the worm reaches the liver the larva transforms into a cysticercus form. This cysticercus will stay in the liver for about two to four weeks, then move to the peritoneal cavity where it will wait for the definitive host to eat the rabbit. The definitive hosts are ether dogs or other members of the \"Canidae\" family. Once ingested the cysticercus finds its way into the intestine and attaches to the intestinal wall with hooks and suckers. After the worm has time to develop and grow in size, the gravid proglottids is released from the distal end of the parasite and passed in the feces to start a new cycle.\n\nThe adult stage consists of a scolex with four suckers and an armed rostellum, a short neck region, a series of immature proglottids with undeveloped reproductive organs, a series of mature proglottids with fully developed male and female reproductive organs, and a series of gravid proglottids with an expanded uterus filled with eggs.\n\nIn rabbits there are not really defined clinical signs seen for any range of intensity except when there is an externally high intensity. In this case, rabbits look weak or ill. The major illness seen is signs of liver failure. In very few cases the cysts will migrate to the lungs or brain; these cases can cause breathing complication or seizures. In the most extreme cases the rabbit will have sudden death.\n\nFor dogs there are normally no clinical signs seen for low to moderate infections. In highly infected cases the dog will experience blockage in the intestines. In all cases the proglottids will be seen in the feces.\n\nWhen looking for signs of infection in the intermediate host or definitive host, the signs are not very externally seen. For the intermediate host there will be between two and 20 pea-sized cysts found inside the liver. The cysts that are found have one scolex inverted to the middle of the cyst. This shape is called a \"cysticercus\", that is part of the \"metacestodes\" stage of life. The ones found in the liver form these bladders that are specifically called \"Cysticercus pisiformis\" for \"T. pisiformis\". These signs can only be seen when a necropsy is done to the rabbit. When looking for an infection in dogs there is a more straightforward method. There will be gravid proglottids with striated eggs seen in the feces. This can be found using a fecal float on a sample that can easily be done by a vet.\n\n\"Taenis pisiformis\" infection is very hard to treat in wild rabbits and canines, but it is easier to control pet infections. One way to stop the infection is to prevent dogs from eating wild rabbits or rodents. If the infected rabbit is not eaten then the worm cannot finish its life cycle. Household rabbits usually do not get infected if they are strictly indoor pets, but infection can happen if they are let outside into open grasses.\n\nIf the infection is already present then use one of these drugs: Epsiprantel, Praziquantel, Mebendazole, Niclosamide, Bunamindine hydrochloride or Fenbendazole. This will kill the adult stage but not the cyst or egg stage, so several treatments may be needed. Daily doses of Praziquantel for about one to two weeks' time will be effective against larval cysticercosis in rabbits. One dose of Niclosamide or Praziquantel can be very effective in dogs.\n"}

In 1955, he and Joe Brown were the first climbers to ascend Kangchenjunga, the third highest mountain in the world.\n\nGeorge Band was born in Taiwan and educated at Eltham College. He did his National Service with the Royal Corps of Signals and read Geology at Queens' College, Cambridge, followed by Petroleum Engineering at Imperial College, London. \n\nHaving started climbing in the Alps while a student at Queens', he was the youngest climber on the 1953 British expedition to Mount Everest on which Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay made the first ascent of the mountain. Two years later, in 1955, he and Joe Brown became the first climbers to ascend Kangchenjunga, the third highest mountain in the world. Out of respect for the religious feelings of the people of Nepal and Sikkim, they stopped about ten feet below the actual summit.\n\nFollowing these early mountaineering successes, George Band spent most of his professional life in oil and gas exploration. In 2005, aged 76, Band made the trek to the south-west Base Camp of Kangchenjunga in Nepal. He was president of the Alpine Club and the British Mountaineering Council, and he traveled around the world. He wrote the books, \"Road to Rakaposhi\" and in 2003, \"Everest 50 Years on Top of the World\" (the official history - Mount Everest Foundation, Royal Geographical Society and the Alpine Club). In 2007 he wrote \" Summit\", a book celebrating 150 years of the Alpine Club. He was Chairman of the Himalayan Trust (UK).

The restaurant's slogan was \"Everything at Foster's is wonderful to eat\".\n\nGeorge Foster owned the western development rights for Dairy Queen. The name Dairy Queen was already being used in California so Dairy Queen was called Foster's Old Fashion Freeze in California.\n\nAfter more than 70 years in the business, Fosters Freeze now has 74 Locations in California.\n\nEl Pollo Loco signed a master franchise contract with Fosters Freeze in 1994, allowing service of Fosters Freeze soft serve ice cream in El Pollo Loco locations. Mark Hardinson, the director of marketing for the grilled-chicken chain, stated that sales increased from three percent to six percent at El Pollo Loco's co-branded locations that served Fosters Freeze's soft-serve desserts. In 2002, there were 122 Fosters Freeze branches, not including the 163 El Pollo Loco restaurants serving Fosters Freeze products. Over half of El Pollo Loco's locations served Fosters Freeze products until the contract's end in 2014, according to El Pollo Loco's official Facebook account.\n\nSome of the company's earliest locations in California included Sunnyvale, Mountain View, and Palo Alto. The Palo Alto location, across the street from the Stanford University campus on El Camino Real, remains virtually unchanged since c. 1950. The oldest locations are often historic landmarks. Also, the Atwater Village location was used in a scene of the movie \"Pulp Fiction\" where Bruce Willis' character runs over Ving Rhames.\n\nThe historical significance embodied in a Fosters Freeze location attracts patrons and has united community members to preserve locations. In 2006, a neighborhood in Menlo Park, located in northern California, presented to their city council a petition with about 800 signatures to avoid demolition of their local Foster's.\n"}

These conventions are typically two or three days long, and often held at either a university or in a convention center hotel.\n\nThe largest gaming convention, Spiel, is a trade fair held in Essen, Germany that focuses on German-style board games and RPGs. A similarly large event is \"Festival Ludique International de Parthenay\" (FLIP), a games festival held over twelve days in France. The annual gamescom in Cologne is the world's leading expo for video games.\n\nWhile games are often a large part of science fiction conventions and other hobby conventions, gaming conventions are distinguished by focusing on games and game-industry guests. The Penny Arcade Expo is the largest gaming convention in the US, with over 70,000 attendees at both its East (Boston) and Prime (Seattle) events. Gen Con has an emphasis on RPGs and features events for RPGs, CCGs, miniatures and boardgames with 60,000+ unique attendees over four days in 2017. Origins focuses on miniatures wargames and boardgames with 12,902 unique attendees in 2014, but also has a large component of RPG and CCG players. DragonCon is an example of a large convention with a focus on popular culture and comics that includes a large gaming contingent and 35,000-40,000 attendees, but isn't dedicated solely as a gaming convention. A smaller genre of gaming conventions are those devoted to the hobby of historical miniature wargaming, many of which are sponsored by the Historical Miniatures Gaming Society.\n\nWorld Boardgaming Championships, PrezCon and Euro Quest are game conventions representing the hobby of Tournament Board Gaming Open Gaming, Demos, Jr. Events and more dedicated to the face to face board game hobby. The World Boardgaming Championships and PrezCon are considered two of the largest events dedicated solely to board games. WBC runs the first week in August each year and PrezCon runs the last week of February each year.\n\nGaming conventions typically have games scheduled for various time slots. Most gaming \"cons\" use some system of pre-registration to ensure that games are neither over-full nor under-full.\n\nCompetitive games, such as \"\", typically have tournaments set out where players meet in matches. Prizes can be quite large for the winners. There are also competitive role-playing games, where the best roleplayers, most successful parties, etc. get rewarded. The RPGA runs competitive \"D&D\" and other RPGs at many conventions. Most scheduled RPGs, however, are not competitive.\n\nThe types of games often include many of the following:\n\n\nOpen gaming goes on throughout any such convention, and it is common that all seating in common areas will be taken by people playing pick-up games. Pick-up gaming is not generally discouraged by the convention management; in fact, pick-up games are a large part of the appeal of gaming conventions.\n\nThere is almost always a dealers' room where various game manufacturers and related companies sell their products. Many game companies choose game cons to reveal new products. Creating consumer excitement is greatly facilitated at gaming cons, but word can spread fast, and games may equally well become instant failures at conventions.\n\nOften there are other activities at a gaming convention as well. Costume balls, art auctions, and screenings of movies may all take place. Lectures, workshops, or panel discussions on gaming might be part of the programming, or for some cons, even the focus.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2211339", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2211339", "title": "Infitah", "text": "Infitah\n\nInfitah ( \"\", \"openness\") was Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's policy of \"opening the door\" to private investment in Egypt in the years following the 1973 October War (Yom Kippur War) with Israel. Infitah was accompanied by a break with longtime ally and aid-giver the USSR – which was replaced by the United States – and by a peace process with Israel symbolized by Sadat's dramatic flight to Jerusalem in 1977. Infitah ended the domination of Egypt's economy by the public sector and encouraged both domestic and foreign investment in the private sector. The Egyptian Army's cross through the Suez canal in the October 1973/Yom Kippur War, which most Egyptians considered a strategic victory, gave Sadat the prestige to initiate a major reversal of Gamal Abdel Nasser's policies.\n\nUnder President Nasser, proponents of statism and a command economy with limited private investment, dominated the political scene. However, by the 1970s, critics believed Egypt's economy, with its large public sector, had evolved into a \"Soviet-style system\" of \"inefficiency, suffocating bureaucracy, and waste.\" Sadat also wanted to turn Egypt away from its focus on war with Israel and devotion of resources to a large military establishment. He believed capitalist economic policies would build a substantial private sector, and alliance with the United States and the West would lead to prosperity (\"rakhaa\" ) and eventually democratic pluralism. Infitah was not only ideologically but also politically motivated: by aligning himself with the capitalist West, and the rich and powerful members of Egyptian society, Sadat differentiated himself from his predecessor Nasser while at the same time securing his position in power.\n\nThe implementation of Infitah is generally considered to have been flawed in its over-ambitiousness and its appearance of having abandoned \"solidarity with the poor.\" The government rewarded its cronies and allies (many of whom became quite rich), and built a power base loyal to the regime with concessions on land, goods and commodities; mandates and contracts to agencies and dealerships, but did little to create free markets and an open economy. The millions of previously poor Egyptians who had joined the middle class under the Nasser regime through education and jobs as doctors, engineers, teachers, lawyers, journalists for the government or parastatals, were left stuck in an \"increasingly marginalized, stagnant and low-paying public sector,\" under Infitah. Infitah was a shock to the Nasser-era middle class, reversing the socialist principles of Nasserism, seeming to revoke policies of free education, social equality, abolition of feudalism, nationalization of land and industry, and progressive taxation. At the same time the public sector continued to dominate the economy. The proportion of the population working for the state grew from 3.8% at the height of the Nasserite era, to 10% (about 35% of the country's entire labor force) after the full thrust of Infitah in the early 1980s. Despite promotion of foreign private investment, the \"state's contribution to the formation of investment capital\" (72%), barely changed from the mid-1960s to the end of the 1970s.\n\nAccording to author Tarek Osman \"Infitah's main fault was that it was over ambitious. It failed to recognize the complexities of Egypt's socio-economic conditions ... It ignored the limitations of the country's administrative system and the power of the military establishment ... the mismatch between the skills of the Egyptian middle class and the various economic opportunities springing up as a result. ... As such, it was an unrealistically rapid developmental program that was doomed to fail.\" \n\nIn 1977, negative public reaction to Infitah policies led to massive spontaneous riots involving hundreds of thousands of Egyptians when the state announced that it was retiring subsidies on basic foodstuffs. On 6 October 1981, Sadat was assassinated during a military parade in Cairo.\n\n\n"}

Two of these camps were the only Nazi concentration camps on British soil, the other two were labour camps.\n\nThe labour housed in the camps were used by the OT in a forced labour programme, to supply labour to build fortifications including bunkers, gun emplacements, air-raid shelters and other concrete defensive structures.\n\n\"Norderney camp\" housed European (usually Eastern but including Spaniard) and Russian enforced labourers. The prisoners in \"Lager Norderney\" and \"Lager Sylt\" were slave labourers. The \"Borkum\" and \"Helgoland\" camps were \"volunteer\" (Hilfswillige) labour camps and the labourers in those camps were treated harshly but better than the inmates at the \"Sylt\" and \"Norderney\" camps. \"Lager Borkum\" was used for German technicians and volunteers from different countries of Europe. \"Lager Helgoland\" was filled with Russian Organisation Todt workers. (For further information on Alderney camps, see \"Appendix F: Concentration Camps: Endlösung – The Final Solution\"; \"Alderney, a Nazi concentration camp on an island Anglo-Norman\").\n\nThe camp was built up by the Organisation Todt after January 1942 and run by them until in March 1943 when it was handed over to the Schutzstaffel - SS-Baubrigade I—which was first under supervision of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp; and ran under the Neuengamme camp in northern Germany.\n\nSome of the structures of Lager Norderney still remain, and the site is now a camping site for tourists. Close by is a tunnel from the camp to the beach, which is it is claimed was used by the Nazis as a shelter, or possibly as a killing site.\n\nOver 700 OT workers lost their lives in the island and in shipping travelling to or from Alderney, before the workers were transferred to France to help build the Atlantic Wall. The destruction of Norderney Camp by the Nazis began in March 1942 and the camps were closed after the Normandy invasion in June 1944.\n\n"}
{"id": "2211347", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2211347", "title": "Synchronous programming language", "text": "Synchronous programming language\n\nA synchronous programming language is a computer programming language optimized for programming reactive systems. Computer systems can be sorted in three main classes: (1) transformational systems that take some inputs, process them, deliver their outputs, and terminate their execution; a typical example is a compiler; (2) interactive systems that interact continuously with their environment, at their own speed; a typical example is the web; and (3) reactive systems that interact continuously with their environment, at a speed imposed by the environment; a typical example is the automatic flight control system of modern airplanes. Reactive systems must therefore react to stimuli from the environment within strict time bounds. For this reason they are often also called real-time systems, and are found often in embedded systems.\n\nSynchronous programming (also synchronous reactive programming or SRP) is a computer programming paradigm supported by synchronous programming languages. The principle of SRP is to make the same abstraction for programming languages as the synchronous abstraction in digital circuits. Synchronous circuits are indeed designed at a high-level of abstraction where the timing characteristics of the electronic transistors are neglected. Each gate of the circuit (or, and, ...) is therefore assumed to compute its result instantaneously, each wire is assumed to transmit its signal instantaneously. A synchronous circuit is clocked and at each tick of its clock, it computes instantaneously its output values and the new values of its memory cells (latches) from its input values and the current values of its memory cells. In other words, the circuit behaves as if the electrons were flowing infinitely fast. The first synchronous programming languages were invented in France in the 1980s: Esterel, Lustre and Signal. Since then, many other synchronous languages have emerged.\n\nThe synchronous abstraction makes reasoning about time in a synchronous program a lot easier, thanks to the notion of logical ticks: a synchronous program reacts to its environment in a sequence of ticks, and computations within a tick are assumed to be instantaneous, i.e., as if the processor executing them were infinitely fast. The statement \"a||b\" is therefore abstracted as the package \"ab\" where \"a\" and \"b\" are simultaneous. To take a concrete example, the Esterel statement \"every 60 second emit minute\" specifies that the signal \"minute\" is exactly synchronous with the 60-th occurrence of the signal \"second\". At a more fundamental level, the synchronous abstraction eliminates the non-determinism resulting from the interleaving of concurrent behaviors. This allows deterministic semantics, therefore making synchronous programs amenable to formal analysis, verification and certified code generation, and usable as formal specification formalisms.\n\nIn contrast, in the asynchronous model of computation, on a sequential processor, the statement \"a||b\" can be either implemented as \"a;b\" or as \"b;a\". This is known as the interleaving-based non determinism. The drawback with an asynchronous model is that it intrinsically forbids deterministic semantics (e.g., race conditions), which makes formal reasoning such as analysis and verification more complex. Nonetheless, asynchronous formalisms are very useful to model, design and verify distributed systems, because they are intrinsically asynchronous.\n\nAlso in contrast are systems with processes that basically \"interact synchronously\". An example would be systems built based on the Communicating sequential processes (CSP) model, which also allows nondeterministic choice.\n\n\n\n"}

Its major fundraiser is the annual Stotfold Mill Steam and Country Fair which takes place in May and attracted around 8,500 visitors raising approximately £20,000 in 2010.\n\nThe parish church of St Mary the Virgin dates to about 1150 but was probably preceded by a series of wooden Saxon churches on the same site. The church is built of flint with Ashwell clunch stone dressings to the buttresses and is mainly in the Early Perpendicular style. In about 1450 the tower was added and the chancel widened and it is believed that the baptismal font also dates from this time and is octagonal and panelled.\n\nIn about 1824 much work was done at the church which included plastering the roof of the north aisle and replacing both the mediaeval carvings and the 400 year-old pews, the latter being done by local contractor William Seymour of Arlesey. At the same time the old paintings on the walls were either destroyed or whitewashed over.\n\nBuilding work continues to expand the town, with new areas such as Mill View and Fairfield Park.\nFairfield Park is on the site of the old Fairfield Hospital, covering a very large area, south of Stotfold and to the east of Arlesey. The old hospital has been converted into luxury apartments, with hundreds of new homes being built in the grounds of the former mental health institute. Fairfield Park was formally split from Stotfold on 1 April 2013, when it became a separate civil parish.\n\nConstruction has also begun on 850 new homes in the 'Four Mills' development by Linden Hills developers. The first phase was completed in 2018 and comprised 55 properties. The development was called \"an overdevelopment\" by Tim Polston, representing some residents in Stotfold.\n\nStotfold has a Non-League football club Stotfold F.C., which plays at Roker Park.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2211358", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2211358", "title": "End of Fashion", "text": "End of Fashion\n\nEnd of Fashion are an Australian pop rock band from Perth, Western Australia. In January 2014, the band took a hiatus, with former lead singer and guitarist Justin Burford explaining in a Facebook post: \"Triple J [national Australian radio station] ended the career path of End Of Fashion, no question.\" The group gained mainstream attention with its 2005 single, \"O Yeah\", that was voted into eighth position of the \"Hottest 100\" poll, compiled by Australian youth radio station, Triple J. The group has released three studio albums. The band performed their first show since their long-term hiatus on 22 September 2018 at the Indian Ocean Hotel in Scarborough.\n\nThe band was originally formed as a side-project by guitarists Burford and Rodney Aravena, together with drummer Malcolm Clark and bassist Jonathon Dudman. After two years, Burford and Aravena split from The Sleepy Jackson to devote their full attention to a band they named \"End of Fashion\". After a series of bass players and drummers—including Vanessa Thornton from Jebediah, Mike Hobbs, Hugh Jennings from Autopilot, and Nicholas Jonsson—the band settled on the line-up of Hobbs as drummer and Tom King as bass guitarist. The band name also represented the band's modus operandi, as Burford explained:\nI want to break down the walls – within that context, that image, we can do anything we want no matter whether it's super cheesy or punk, I want to kill fashion, see the end of it.\nIn 2003, the band started work on its first recording, the four-track EP, \"Rough Diamonds\", with former Midnight Oil guitarist, Jim Moginie, as producer. The EP was jointly released through independent label Hello Cleveland! (artwork) and major label EMI.\n\nTriple J added both singles, \"Anything Goes\" and \"Rough Diamonds\", to high rotation in the first week of the EP's release, and the band then performed sold-out shows during a five-week national tour in support of Little Birdy and Betchadupa. The EP was released in March 2004 and debuted at number 57 on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart and reached number 81 on Triple J's Hottest 100 for 2004. The band signed to EMI/Capitol Australia for overseas licensing options in early 2004, before playing SXSW.\n\nOn 25 August 2005, End of Fashion released their self-titled debut album, which was recorded in Oxford, Mississippi, US and was produced by Dennis Herring, who had previously worked with Elvis Costello, Counting Crows and Modest Mouse. The album peaked at number 3 on the ARIA Albums Chart and was certified gold in Australia and New Zealand, and was released in the United States in May 2006.\n\nThe band's first single, \"O Yeah\", reached number 21 on the ARIA Singles Chart, number 8 on Triple J's Hottest 100 for 2005, won two ARIA Music Awards and was nominated for the prestigious APRA 'Song of the Year'. The fourth single \"The Game\" debuted on the ARIA Singles Chart at a career high number 13 in 2006.\n\nTheir songs have been on the games \"Thrillville\" (which featured \"She's Love\" and \"Lock Up Your Daughters\" on the in-game radio), \"ATV Offroad Fury 4\" (which featured \"The Game\"), and \"FIFA Street 2\" (which featured \"O Yeah\"). \"The Game\" was featured as the theme song for the television coverage of the 2007 NRL season on the Nine Network.\n\nOn 15 December 2007, End of Fashion released a new song \"Biscit\" on the band's official website, Facebook and MySpace pages. In May 2008, the band confirmed on their website that their second album, titled \"Book of Lies\", would be released in September 2008. While End of Fashion released a further two new songs, \"Kamikaze\" and \"Walkaway\", on their MySpace page on 27 June 2008, the first single to be released from the album was \"Fussy\", which reached number 47 in the charts.\n\nIn an interview with \"Time Out Sydney\" in February 2009, Burford revealed that Simon Fasolo had replaced Tom King as the band's bassist. \"He's been a really good friend of ours for years and he's been brought into the fold to take Tom's spot who we encouraged to go pursue his own project. \"\n\nThe second single released from the album was \"Dying for You\", a collaboration between Burford and Julian Hamilton of The Presets:\n\nThe third single \"Down or Down\" was released digitally in March 2009 and received radio coverage. During their 2009 Australian tour in support of Evermore, Burford announced that \"Force of Habit\" would be the fourth single taken from \"Book of Lies\".\n\nEnd of Fashion's third studio album \"Holiday Trip of a Lifetime\" was released on 4 May 2012. The album was independently produced and released, with the band writing the album over the period of one year. However, the band members parted ways following the album's release, and Burford's focus shifted towards acting and solo music work. Burford attracted media attention in January 2014 when he identified Triple J as the primary reason for the band's demise, explaining: \"'The question becomes, when your entire fan base is tied up in a radio station and that station decides to no longer broadcast your output or even barely acknowledge your existence, where do you go from there?'\" Burford's perspective, initially published in a Facebook post, followed criticism of the radio station from other musicians and an article published by the \"Age\" newspaper, in which the journalist addressed the issue of whether Triple J has led to the \"homogenisation of Australian music\". In an interview in 2013 Burford stated that the band hadn't broken up but was in hiatus, \"We've never had the chat where we have said 'Let's call it a day', It's just that everybody has fallen into other rhythms of life.\"\n\nBurford joined the cast of the rock musical, \"Rock of Ages\", in 2010, following a meeting with producers in New York City, United States (US). Burford played the lead role of Drew Boley. Rock of Ages ran from 8 April to 4 December 2011, and played in Melbourne and Brisbane. Burford was nominated for a Helpmann Award for Best Male Actor in a Musical at the 2012 Helpmann Awards.\n\nBurford also appeared in several episodes of the music-based game show \"Spicks and Specks\", at the time hosted by Adam Hills for the ABC including:\n\nIn early 2012 Burford and former End Of Fashion member Mike Hobbs began work crafting a one-man cabaret show that was to focus on the life and music of legendary Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain. To bring the show to stage, Burford & Hobbs reunited with former bandmates Hugh Jennings and Rodney Aravena and the one time lineup of End Of Fashion performed \"\"KURT\"\" at the Adelaide Cabaret Festival from 8 to 10 June 2012.\n\nBurford appeared with Perth Symphony Orchestra on 25 September 2013 for \"Vivaldi by Candlelight\" at the heritage listed Wesley Church in Western Australia. He later performed with Perth Symphony Orchestra at \"Symphony By The Lake\" on 8 March 2014.\n\nIn 2014 Aravena formed a blues duo, She Leaves the Mountain, with vocalist Dimity Magnus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Each camp was named after one of the Frisian Islands: Lager Norderney located at Saye, \"Lager Borkum\" at Platte Saline, Lager Sylt near the old telegraph tower at La Foulère and Lager Helgoland, situated in the northwest corner of the island. Over 700 workers died in the Alderney camps (out of a total inmate population of about 6,000) and in ships moving them to and from the Island. \n\nLittle remains of Lager Borkum now.

Benson holds the rank and pay-grade of Captain and is the Commanding Officer of the Manhattan Special Victims Unit of the New York City Police Department, which operates out of the 16th precinct.\n\nWhen the series begins, she holds the rank of Detective and is partnered with Detective Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni), serving as the junior member of the pair. Following Stabler's departure at the end of the 12th season after a deadly shootout in the precinct, she is partnered with Detective Nick Amaro (Danny Pino) and becomes the senior member.\n\nDuring the 15th season, Benson is promoted to Sergeant and appointed as acting commanding officer, in the wake of the retirement of both Sergeant John Munch (Richard Belzer) and Captain Donald Cragen (Dann Florek). During the 17th season, she is promoted to Lieutenant and becomes the squad's official commanding officer. She is promoted to Captain in the 21st season premiere.\n\nThe character first appeared in the \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\" pilot episode, \"\", which aired September 20, 1999. Hargitay remains the only original cast member still present on the series. Benson has been credited in 470 episodes of \"SVU\" (478 in the franchise/universe), and with the premiere of season 21, Hargitay's Benson became the longest running prime-time live-action character of all time, surpassing the record held by \"Gunsmoke\"s Marshall Matt Dillon and Kelsey Grammer's character Frasier Crane from \"Cheers\" and \"Frasier\". She made her 400th credited appearance in the third episode of the eighteenth season of \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\", surpassing Cragen as the character with the most credited appearances in the \"Law & Order\" franchise.\n\nHargitay's portrayal of Olivia Benson has received critical acclaim, and she has been the recipient of numerous awards and nominations, including an Emmy and a Golden Globe.\n\nSeries creator Dick Wolf named his two lead detectives after his son, Elliot, and his daughter, Olivia. Wolf conceived Benson as a detective in the Manhattan Special Victims Unit, which investigates sex crimes. For the first twelve seasons of the show, she is partnered with Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni); after he resigns (offscreen) at the beginning of season 13, she is partnered with Nick Amaro (Danny Pino).\n\nShe is tough, empathetic, and gets emotionally involved in cases. Executive producer and head writer Neal Baer has explained that she is \"the empathetic, passionate voice for these victims\", in contrast to Stabler, who embodies \"the rage we feel, the 'How can this happen?' feeling\". Of their partnership, Baer assessed that: \"They both represent the feelings that we feel simultaneously when we hear about these cases. That's why they work so well together.\"\n\nBenson herself is a child of her mother's rape. Her mother's rapist, Joseph Hollister, later committed suicide. Benson's mother Serena (Elizabeth Ashley), an English professor, was an alcoholic who emotionally and physically abused Olivia. In the season 2 episode \"\", Serena Benson dies falling down a flight of subway stairs outside the entrance to a bar. In a later episode, \"\", Benson mentions being engaged briefly when she was 16 to one of her mother's students; when her mother found out, she broke a bottle of vodka and went after her with it. Benson fought back, kicked her mother twice, and ran out of the house.\n\nBenson is a graduate of Siena College. While there, she held a membership in a sorority. In addition to English, Benson speaks Italian, Russian, some Spanish and French, and is able to read the Miranda warnings in at least two other languages. She owns a black 1965 Ford Mustang convertible but rarely drives it.\n\nShe has a younger half-brother named Simon Marsden (Michael Weston). Simon, whom she found by illegally running her DNA through the system, was a suspect in a rape case. However, his name was cleared after it is revealed that he was framed by Captain Julia Millfield (Kim Delaney), who believed (incorrectly) that he sexually assaulted her sister. In the season 13 episode \"Child's Welfare\", Simon reveals to Benson that he is planning to marry a woman named Tracy (Nicole Beharie), with whom he has a daughter and a stepson; he named his daughter Olivia after Benson. When the children are taken by the City because of Simon's criminal background, Benson calls defense attorney Bayard Ellis (Andre Braugher), an old friend of hers, to help Simon and Tracy get the children back. When a judge denies the Marsdens custody of their children, Simon kidnaps them. Ellis makes a deal to have Simon serve a 60-day sentence, knocking his charge down from kidnapping to a misdemeanor, custodial interference. One of the conditions of the reduced charges is that he must give up his custody petition and agree to visit his daughter only in a supervised setting for the next three years. Simon is reluctant, but Benson tells him that the deal is better than his daughter visiting him in jail. In the Season 21 episode \"Murdered at a Bad Address\", Simon reaches out to Benson for the first time in years as his only remaining family, Tracy having left him and taken their children. She hesitantly agrees to meet with him, but when he doesn't show up, she leaves him a voicemail cutting him out of her life for good. Shortly afterward, he is found dead of a heroin overdose. Benson blames herself for his death, haunted by the possibility that he overdosed out of despair after she disowned him.\n\nIn Season 12, Benson is named the legal guardian of a young boy named Calvin Arliss (Charlie Tahan). Calvin's mother, Vivian (Maria Bello), abandons him and flees when Benson's investigation uncovers that Vivian (also a child of rape) may have killed her mother's rapist. Vivian names Benson as Calvin's legal guardian. Calvin lives with her for a while, until she finds Vivian and her lover Sara Hoyt (Kat Foster) have relapsed into drug use. Sara confesses to murdering Vivian's father and is then shot dead. Vivian revokes Benson's parental rights and sends Calvin to live with his grandparents in Vermont. Both Calvin and Benson are devastated by the separation. In season 13, she is seen with Calvin and his grandparents during or right before Halloween.\n\nAt the conclusion of the finale, Benson becomes the court-appointed custodial guardian of Noah Porter, an orphaned baby. The appointment is for a trial period of one year, with the option to apply for legal adoption at the end of that period. Although the year is rocky due to Noah's health issues and the demands of her job, Benson grows to love Noah and formally adopts him a year later. Noah's biological father is a pimp and serial rapist named John \"Johnny D\" Drake (Charles Halford) who trafficked, raped and murdered Noah's mother, Ellie Porter (Emma Greenwell). Drake sues for custody as a ploy to get out of prison, imperiling Benson's chances of adopting Noah. Benson's problems are solved when Drake is killed during a courtroom shootout, but she still occasionally worries that Noah has inherited his father's violent tendencies.\n\nAt the end of season 19 premiere \"Gone Fishin'\", Benson learns that she is being investigated by the DA's office on suspicions of abusing Noah. The investigation is dropped in \"Mood\". In \"Contrapasso\", her lawyer Trevor Langan (Peter Hermann) returns to tell her that Noah has a grandmother, Sheila Porter (Brooke Shields), Ellie's mother. In \"No Good Reason\", she brings Benson to family court, accusing her of being an unfit parent; the case is dismissed, but Benson agrees that it's in Noah's best interest that they stop fighting. In \"Unintended Consequences\", Benson lets her visit and spend time with Noah. At the end of \"Intent\", she gets a call from Sheila telling her that Noah had been kidnapped in the mall. In \"Gone Baby Gone\", it is revealed that Sheila was behind the kidnapping, and that she intends to take Noah to live with her in Derry, New Hampshire. Benson goes to Sheila's cabin in Franconia, New Hampshire to rescue Noah, where Sheila attacks her; Benson manages to subdue and arrest her, however, and takes Noah back home with her.\n\nBenson is forced to kill a suspect on three separate occasions during her tenure on the show: in Season 1's \"Disrobed\", she shoots and kills serial rapist Roger Silver (Jack Gwaltney) in self-defense; in Season 3's \"Wrath\", serial killer Eric Plummer (Justin Kirk) commits suicide by cop by attacking a woman and forcing Benson to shoot him; and in Season 18's \"Next Chapter\", she shoots and kills rapist (and retired corrections officer) Tom Cole (Chris Bauer) during a hostage situation when Cole attacks her SVU colleague Detective Dominick \"Sonny\" Carisi Jr. (Peter Scanavino). Also, in Season 6's \"Rage\", she shoots and wounds serial killer Gordon Rickett (Matthew Modine) to prevent Stabler from killing him in cold blood.\n\nHargitay has characterized Benson and Stabler's relationship as \"very complicated\". Her assessment is that:\n\nBaer agrees that a romantic relationship between the two is unlikely, though commented: \"You never can say never\".\n\nHargitay has stated that her favorite \"SVU\" scene occurs in the episode \"Fault\", when Benson is faced with the possibility of losing Stabler: \"Lou Diamond Phillips [who played a child killer] has a gun to Elliot's head. I'm negotiating [with him to drop the gun]. It was a painful, high-stakes scene. Elliot and I have to admit what we mean to each other... He is everything that [my character] Olivia has. So this was where we really got that to pay off.\" In an episode where Stabler goes undercover, Benson tries to talk him into coming back; but they are interrupted by Stabler's targets, and she undresses and pretends to be a prostitute.\n\nBenson takes it hard when Stabler resigns from the NYPD in the 13th season opener, \"Scorched Earth\", and takes a while to warm up to her new partner, Nick Amaro. While Stabler has yet to appear again in the series, Benson frequently mentions him in both a professional and personal context; she tells the squad's newer detectives what Stabler would do in a given situation, and says more than once that she is \"getting over someone\".\n\nIn season 1, Benson has a sexual relationship with one of her SVU colleagues, Detective Brian Cassidy (Dean Winters). In the episode \"Closure\", Benson refers to it as a drunken one-night stand. It is implied that the relationship continued based on comments in the episode \"\". Cassidy leaves the precinct at the end of that episode. In the season 5 episode \"Lowdown\", it is revealed Benson had a relationship with a murder victim who turned out to be gay and HIV positive. Medical Examiner Melinda Warner (Tamara Tunie) immediately tests Benson and the results come back negative. In the season 9 episode \"Closet\", the SVU squad are surprised to find out that Benson has been in a relationship with journalist Kurt Moss (Bill Pullman) for several months. It comes out only because Internal Affairs is investigating Benson and Stabler in a case in which the department accidentally outed a professional football player. By the end of the episode, she breaks up with Moss.\n\nWhile Benson has only been portrayed in relationships with men, she has, according to lesbian entertainment website AfterEllen.com, \"attracted a large lesbian following\". Fan speculation exists over alleged sexual tension between Benson and Assistant District Attorney Alexandra Cabot (Stephanie March), which Baer admits to indulging: \"We read the fan sites. We know that people are into the Alex-Olivia thing. All the codes are in there.\"\n\nIn the middle of season 13, Benson enters into a relationship with a new prosecutor to the District Attorney's Office, (Harry Connick Jr.). Hargitay has said that Connick, who is a friend of hers, improved the show to a more romantic advanced stance. \"This is a home run on so many levels,\" she said. \"The show is very fortunate to have Harry's extraordinary talent, and I'm lucky because I get to work with my friend. I think Olivia couldn't have asked for a better companion to take her through a new stage in her life and career.\" Haden and Benson begin their relationship at the end of the episode, \"Official Story\". In the episode \"Hunting Ground\", she decides to take it slow with Haden, claiming she needs time to see if their relationship will last. That night, they end up sleeping together in her apartment. This makes her late for a case, which is frowned upon in the NYPD. In the episode \"\", Benson and Haden end their relationship due to a conflict of interest.\n\nIn the season 14 premiere, Benson shares a kiss with Cassidy after she tells him she is not the same person from 13 years before, when they had a brief sexual relationship. Later that season, in the episode \"Undercover Blue\", it is revealed that Cassidy and Benson had been seeing each other for quite some time. Their relationship hits a rough patch in the episode when Cassidy is accused of rape, which results in their relationship becoming public. The charges against Cassidy are later dropped when the SVU detectives discover that he was being set up. In season 15, Benson stays with Cassidy as she recovers from her imprisonment by a serial rapist. A few months after she returns to work, they get a new apartment together. They break up in the episode \"Downloaded Child\", however, upon realizing that they want different things.\n\nIn \"Chicago Crossover\" and \"They'll Have to Go Through Me\", Benson strikes up a friendship with Sergeant Hank Voight (Jason Beghe) of the Chicago Police Department, despite their differing methodologies when it comes to solving crime. Upon the conclusion of their joint operation, the two share drinks before Benson returns to New York.\n\nIt is suggested throughout that Benson is in a relationship with Capt. Ed Tucker (Robert John Burke) of Internal Affairs. In \"Manhattan Transfer\", they are forced to confirm their relationship when Tucker is accused – by his own cousin, a priest – of being complicit with a sex trafficking ring that has ties to Vice and the Catholic Church. Tucker is eventually cleared, and he continues his relationship with Benson. In season 18, Tucker tries to convince Benson to retire with him, though at the conclusion of the episode \"Next Chapter\", Benson realizes she is not ready to do so, as being a cop is part of who she is. As a result, Benson breaks up with Tucker at the end of the episode \"Chasing Theo\".\n\nIn the season 9 episode \"Undercover\", Benson poses as an inmate in a women's prison to investigate an alleged rape by a corrections officer. While there, the corrections officer in question, Captain Lowell Harris (Johnny Messner), attacks her and attempts to force her to perform oral sex on him. She is rescued by SVU colleague Fin Tutuola (Ice-T), who gets there just in time to stop Harris from raping her. Later, Benson helps convict Harris by questioning his earlier victim about distinguishing features on his penis, prompting the victim to recall a mole on it, which Benson later explains to medical examiner Melinda Warner (Tamara Tunie) that she had also seen. When Warner asks Benson if she had been raped, she replies, \"It was the closest I've ever come.\"\n\nIn season 10, Benson is seen struggling with now being a victim of sexual assault herself. She is attending group therapy, something she has not shared with anyone but Tutuola. In the episode \"PTSD,\" while investigating the rape of a Marine, she is pushed against a wall while trying to break up a fight between a suspected rapist and another Marine. She subsequently breaks up the fight by holding her weapon to the back of the suspect's head. Later, while in questioning, the other Marine tells Tutuola that, \"She [Benson] has PTSD, I would recognize that glassy-eyed look anywhere.\" At the end of the episode, the original suspect is cleared, and Benson apologizes to him, admitting that she was a victim of sexual assault.\n\nIn the season 11 episode \"Perverted,\" Benson becomes the prime suspect in the sexual mutilation and murder of a biker gang member. As more evidence is found linking her to the crime, an Internal Affairs detective insinuates that she may have committed it while suffering from a flashback to the assault. The other detectives eventually discover that Benson has been framed by a man she sent to prison years earlier.\n\nAt the end of the season 14 finale \"Her Negotiation\", Benson is kidnapped by serial rapist/murderer William Lewis (Pablo Schreiber). During the season 15 premiere \"Surrender Benson\", Lewis makes her watch while he rapes and tortures the mother of his own attorney and kills a police officer who attempted to pull him over. He then beats and tortures her, burning her with cigarettes and wire hangers, and holds her hostage for four days. Just as he is about to rape her, she breaks free, handcuffs him, and holds him at gunpoint. When he taunts her, she loses control and beats him within an inch of his life with an iron rod. She is rescued by her fellow detectives moments later, and Cragen puts her on mandatory leave so she can recover. She returns to work in the following episode, \"Imprisoned Lives\", which takes place two months later, but is still haunted by the experience. She begins seeing a therapist (Bill Irwin) to cope with the trauma. It is later revealed that Lewis survived and is in prison awaiting trial.\n\nIn \"Psycho/Therapist\", a visibly injured and still-recovering Lewis fires his new attorney and chooses to represent himself. He calls Benson as a witness and accuses her of assaulting him because he rejected her sexual advances. She vehemently denies it, and lies under oath that he had broken free of his restraints and lunged at her. Lewis is found guilty of kidnapping and assaulting a police officer, but the jury voices doubts about Benson's story and acquits him of attempted rape. The episode closes with Benson weeping on the courthouse stairs and, four months later, Lewis being wheeled away on a stretcher.\n\nIn \"Beast's Obsession\", Lewis uses the distraction caused by his (self-induced) cardiac incident to escape from prison. He then rapes a teenage girl, kidnaps her younger sister, and threatens to kill her unless Benson tells the truth about her testimony. Benson holds a press conference and admits that she lied on the witness stand. When Lewis does not release the girl, Benson tracks him down and surrenders to him. With his hostage watching, Lewis at first attempts to rape Benson, but changes his mind when she refuses to show him fear; instead, he forces her to play Russian roulette with him. As a police squad closes in, Lewis taunts her one last time before committing suicide right in front of her. In \"Post-Mortem Blues\", she is brought before a grand jury to explain her admission and Lewis' death. Her career is threatened until SVU's temporary commanding officer, Lt. Declan Murphy (Donal Logue), tells the grand jury that he instructed Benson to lie in her press conference, thus clearing her of Lewis' death and possible perjury charges. Murphy then makes Benson his second-in-command.\n\nIn subsequent seasons, Lewis' name becomes a kind of code for an intensely dangerous situation, and Benson admits that her trauma and ordeal with him will always be a part of her. During a heated exchange with Amaro, he pointedly asks her whether she can ever forgive Lewis; she does not answer, and he apologizes.\n\nHargitay has deemed the storyline which saw Benson find her paternal family \"probably the biggest thing that's ever happened to Olivia\". She feels her character is a role model for teenage girls, revealing:\n\nBenson joined the NYPD in 1992, and was trained by Sergeant Karen Smythe (Khandi Alexander) at the 55th Precinct in the Bronx. After completing her probationary period, Smythe recommended that Benson be transferred to the Sex Crimes Unit (later renamed the Special Victims Unit) because of her talent for dealing with victims. From 1993 to 1998, she was partnered with Detective Patrick Griffin (Anthony Edwards), who in 1992 testified on her behalf when she was accused of taking money and drugs during her first bust. However, he lied for her, as he had not actually been with her in the same room at the time.\n\nBy 1998, she had received her detective's shield and was assigned to the 16th Precinct as a Detective 3rd Grade, and was partnered with Det. Elliot Stabler. She is promoted to Detective 2nd Grade in 2001, and Detective 1st Grade in 2011. In 2006, she is temporarily reassigned to the Computer Crimes Unit; later that year, she does a stint undercover for the FBI's Domestic Terrorism Unit at the request of her friend, Special Agent Dana Lewis (Marcia Gay Harden).\n\nBenson and Stabler work together for over 12 years, until Stabler retires in 2011 after he is forced to kill an 18-year-old girl who shot up the SVU squad room. Following Stabler's resignation, she is partnered with Det. Nick Amaro.\n\nCragen asks Benson to take the Sergeant's exam following the retirement of Sgt. John Munch (Richard Belzer), and she gets the promotion soon afterward; Cragen congratulates her for placing 48th out of 8,000 applicants. Cragen announces at another dinner party that Benson has been approved to remain at SVU (it was feared she would be reassigned); at the end of the episode, Cragen reveals his impending retirement from the NYPD, making Benson SVU's acting commanding officer. Benson remains in command until Lieutenant Declan Murphy (Donal Logue) takes over the squad; he makes her his second-in-command. When Murphy returns to undercover work, he appoints her acting commander.\n\nLt. Ed Tucker (Robert John Burke), representing 1 Police Plaza, asks Benson to take the Lieutenant's exam in order to officially take command of SVU before the NYPD appoints another officer to the position. She passes the Lieutenant's exam with flying colors, and is officially promoted to Lieutenant after some politicking by her boss, Deputy Chief William Dodds (Peter Gallagher). Benson had wanted Detective Fin Tutuola as her second-in-command, but Chief Dodds arranges for the politically unsavvy Benson to be assigned a Sergeant who does know how to play the game – his own son, Mike (Andy Karl).\n\nFollowing the events of \"Manhattan Transfer\", Benson is relieved of her duties as Commanding Officer of SVU, largely due to her (personal) involvement with now-Captain Tucker, who becomes a person of interest in a complex corruption case SVU stumbled upon. Mike Dodds is made Acting Commanding Officer. In spite of this, Benson quietly continues to call the shots at SVU since Dodds disagrees with her suspension and continues to seek her advice in secret. Benson is reinstated after SVU managed to bust the sex trafficking ring and Tucker is cleared.\n\nIn \"Heartfelt Passages\", Benson and Mike Dodds, on the latter's last day at SVU, are involved in a hostage situation involving corrupt Rikers Island corrections officer Gary Munson (Brad Garrett) holding his wife hostage. Benson takes Munson's children out of the house and Dodds tried to resolve the situation, but while trying to get the gun from the officer, he ends up being shot. He suffers a stroke after surgery and dies. Benson blames herself for Dodds' death because they did not initially search Munson for a weapon.\n\nBenson is promoted to Captain in the episode \"I'm Going to Make You a Star\", the final act of Deputy Chief Dodds before his transfer to Staten Island.\n\nAs commanding officer, Benson has worked cases frequently with each of the detectives under her command: Tutuola, Amanda Rollins (Kelli Giddish) and Dominick \"Sonny\" Carisi, Jr. (Peter Scanavino).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following are the medals and service awards worn by then-Sergeant Benson, as seen in \"Betrayal's Climax\" and \"Beast's Obsession\".\n\nThe following are the medals and service awards worn by then-Lieutenant Benson, as seen in \"Heartfelt Passages\".\n\nCasting for the lead characters on \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\" occurred in the spring of 1999. Dick Wolf, along with officials from NBC and Studios USA, were at the final auditions for the two leads at Rockefeller Center. The last round had been narrowed down to six finalists. For the female lead – Benson – Samantha Mathis, Reiko Aylesworth, and Hargitay were being considered. For the male role – Stabler – the finalists were Tim Matheson, John Slattery, and Christopher Meloni. Meloni and Hargitay had auditioned in the final round together and after the actors left, there was a moment of dead silence, after which Wolf blurted out, \"Oh well. There's no doubt who we should choose – Hargitay and Meloni.\" The duo, who Wolf believed had the perfect chemistry from the first time he saw them together, were his first choice. Garth Ancier, then head of NBC Entertainment, agreed, and the rest of the panel assembled voiced their assent. Hargitay trained as a rape crisis advocate to prepare for the role of Benson.\n\nDuring the last months of her pregnancy in 2006, Hargitay took maternity leave from \"SVU\", and was temporarily replaced by Connie Nielsen.\n\nIn May 2009, after the show's , Hargitay and Meloni's contracts expired when they were reportedly making $375,000–$385,000 per episode. During negotiations in April for a new contract, the duo attempted to receive a percentage of the show's profits as other high-profile \"Law & Order\" actors had done in the past. It was rumored that NBC threatened to replace Hargitay and Meloni if they persisted in their demands. However, two months later it was officially reported that both their contracts had been renewed for two more years. When the thirteenth season was about to air, initial reports indicated that Hargitay would appear in only the first 13 episodes. However, NBC chairman Bob Greenblatt later clarified that she would be in every episode of the season.\n\nSince 2012, Hargitay earns approximately $400,000 to $500,000 per episode.\n\nHargitay has won a number of awards for her role as Benson: 'Individual Achievement for Best Female Lead' and 'Outstanding Female Lead' Gracie Awards in 2004 and 2009 respectively, an Emmy for 'Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series' in 2006, a Prism Award for 'Performance in a Drama Series Episode' in 2006, and a Golden Globe for 'Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series' in 2005. Of her Emmy win, Hargitay commented: \"It makes me only want to be better. Now I'm an Emmy winner. I have to step it up.\"\n\nThe \"San Francisco Chronicle\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s John Carman called Hargitay \"the show's weakest performer\" when the series originally premiered in 1999. In 2006, however, fellow \"San Francisco Chronicle\" writer Jean Gonick deemed Benson a suitable role model for teenage girls, calling her \"courageous and strong, and unspeakably gorgeous\", and writing that \"Olivia Benson is our own special hero. She battles evil, avenges her mother, faces her demons but refuses to date them.\" In 2001, \"Entertainment Weekly\"s Ken Tucker criticized Benson and Stabler as \"the most naive, bleeding heart molester busters in America.\"\n\nA poll on the Hallmark Channel voted her second-greatest detective in the \"Law & Order\" franchise, only being beaten by \"\"s Robert Goren (Vincent D'Onofrio). Benson appeared in Comcast's list of TV's Most Intriguing Characters and also in the website's list of TV's Top Cops. She was included in \"TV Guide\"s list of \"TV's Sexiest Crime Fighters\". UGO Networks placed \"the hard-charging detective\" among the \"fifty greatest fictional detectives of all time\". A 2015 poll released by \"Trailer Park, Inc.\" in conjunction with \"QC Strategy\" ranked Benson as the No. 1 \"favourite female television character\".\n\nBenson appears on three episodes of \"Law & Order\", one episode of \"\", three episodes of \"Chicago P.D.\" and one episode of \"Chicago Fire\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2211410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2211410", "title": "Paragonimus", "text": "Paragonimus\n\nParagonimus is a genus of flukes (trematodes). Some tens of species have been described, but they are difficult to distinguish, so it is not clear how many of the named species may be synonyms. The name Paragonimus is derived from the combination of two Greek words, “para” (on the side of) and “gonimos” (gonads or genitalia). Several of the species are known as lung flukes. In humans some of the species occur as zoonoses; the term for the condition is paragonimiasis. The first intermediate hosts of \"Paragonimus\" include at least 54 species of freshwater snails from superfamilies Cerithioidea and Rissooidea.\n\nThe most prominent species of Paragonimus in human medicine is \"Paragonimus westermani\", an infectious lung fluke originating in eastern Asia. Worldwide, about nine species of \"Paragonimus\" are known to cause human paragonimiasis in which many of the species reside in East Asia, West Africa, and in North and South America.\n\nSpecies of \"Paragonimus\" vary in size; the adult stage might attain a length of up to and a width of up to . The adult flatworm has an oval shape body with spines covering its thick tegument. Both the oral sucker and acetabulum are round and muscular. The acetabulum is slightly bigger than the oral sucker – 0.19 mm and 0.12 mm, respectively. Ovaries are located behind the acetabulum and posterior to the ovary are the testes. The seminal receptacle, the uterus and its metraterm, the thick-walled terminal part, lie between the acetabulum and the ovary.\n\nThe parasite passes through two intermediate hosts, an aquatic snail and a crustacean. It enters its mammalian definitive hosts when they eat infected freshwater crustaceans. Typical hosts include dogs, cats, and humans. Humans usually contract paragonimiasis when they eat undercooked freshwater crabs (for instance species of the genus \"Nanhaipotamon\") or crayfish, that contain live metacercariae. In the intestine, the parasite will move into the abdomen and commonly into the lungs. In the lung, the parasites encyst and cross fertilize each other. The cyst eventually ruptures in the lungs and the eggs may be coughed up or swallowed and excreted in the feces. An egg landing in fresh water hatches and releases a ciliated miracidium. A successful miracidium swims about until it finds an intermediate host, usually an aquatic snail. A crustacean in turn becomes infected by eating infected snails. The definitive host completes the cycle if it eats infected crustaceans.\n\nWorldwide roughly 20 million people are infected with Paragonimus. Human infections are most common in regions with many human and animal reservoir hosts plus an abundance of intermediate hosts, such as snails, crabs, or crayfish, and where in addition consumption of raw or undercooked seafood is common. Consumption of insufficiently cooked meat from infected land animal hosts, such as wild boar, commonly transmits the infection. The domestic cat is a reservoir for a variety of lung flatworms and can transmit the infection to humans.\n\nSymptoms of paragonimiasis may include abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, and hives. If the infection remains untreated, the symptoms may diminish or disappear after only few months, but sometimes they last for decades. Paragonimiasis is caused by the body's natural immune response to the worms and eggs that are present and also migrating from the intestines to the lungs.\n\nAs a rule, the parasites begin to cause symptoms about three weeks after ingesting live metacercariae. After about eight weeks, they begin to produce eggs in the lungs. Some patients develop brain damage if parasites establish in the brain and produce eggs. The brain damage commonly causes headache, vomiting, and seizures. Untreated cerebral paragonimaisis commonly results in death from increased intracranial pressure.\n\nPraziquantel has been used to effectively treat paragonimiasis by separating the tegument. An effectively complete rate of cure may be expected after three days of treatment if there has not been too much permanent damage, such as from intracranial effects. Other medications can also be used such as bithionol, niclofan, and triclabendazole with high cure rates.\n\nThorough cooking of an infected crustacean kills all stages of the parasite. Crab meat should not be eaten raw, even if pickled, because the pickling solution often fails to kill all the parasites. Utensils and cutlery boards should be cleaned thoroughly before and after food preparation.\n"}

His former group, Green River, is one of the first grunge bands, along with Malfunkshun, Soundgarden, Skin Yard, the U-Men, and others. He is also the manager of the Sub Pop warehouse and previously worked at Fantagraphics Books.\n\nArm was born February 21, 1962 at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, and was raised in Kirkland, Washington. As a child, he was a member of Boy Scouts of America. He graduated from Bellevue Christian High School in Bellevue, Washington. \n\nIn 1985, Arm earned an English degree with an emphasis in creative writing from the University of Washington.\n\nArm first entered the Seattle rock scene in 1980, when he formed a band while still in high school, called \"Mr. Epp and the Calculations\" with singer Jo Smitty. The band played its first show in 1981, opening for the band Student Nurse. In 1982 they released a 7\" EP entitled \"Mohawk Man\", produced by Johnny Rubato (of Rubato Records, a local used record shop for more than 30 years). The next year they added a second guitarist, Steve Turner, and released a cassette of both studio and live material. They also played with Ten Minute Warning and the Dead Kennedys at the Eagles Auditorium in April. Mr. Epp and the Calculations came to an end the following year.\n\nAfter Mr. Epp and the Calculations ended, Mark Arm and Steve Turner (who had become close friends) joined the band Limp Richerds for a few weeks. Afterward, Arm and Turner took on future Pearl Jam members Jeff Ament and Stone Gossard, as well as Alex Vincent, to form the band Green River. Green River released two EPs and a full length album before disbanding. Steve Turner left the band to finish college, and Arm was forced to find a new band again. After Turner returned from schooling, they resumed their Green River side project, The Thrown Ups.\n\nArm and Turner took on drummer Dan Peters, and bassist Matt Lukin, formerly of Melvins. The new band renamed themselves Mudhoney. In 1988, Sub Pop released Mudhoney's first single, \"Touch Me I'm Sick\". After extensive touring and an EP album, Mudhoney released their eponymous full length debut in 1989. Their next album, \"Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge\" came out soon after, just before the explosion of grunge spearheaded by Nirvana's seminal \"Nevermind\". At the time, Sub Pop, their record label, was \"on the verge of bankruptcy, having trouble paying its flagship band, severely delaying the release of the album to July 1991.\" In 1992, they signed to a major record label, Reprise and released \"Piece of Cake\". The album did not sell well, due to a combination of the band's uncompromising sound and an oversaturation of the genre; according to Stephen Turner, the album references \"how easily things had come to them...the songs were kinda half-baked... and Mark wasn't at his best.\"\n\nAlthough they never achieved the fame of some of their contemporaries, Arm and Mudhoney have made significant contributions to grunge music. Mudhoney is one of the few grunge bands that continue to release albums; in 2002 they released \"Since We've Become Translucent\", \"The Lucky Ones\" followed in May 2008, \"Vanishing Point\" came in April 2013, and, most recently, Digital Garbage came out in September 2018. All of these releases have been on the Sub Pop record label.\n\nArm released \"The Freewheelin' Mark Arm\", a solo single in 1990.\n\nHe was a singer and guitarist for the group Bloodloss and singer for the Seattle supergroup The Monkeywrench. Monkeywrench members include Arm, Turner, Tim Kerr (Lord Hi Fixers, Big Boys, Poison 13), Tom Price (Gas Huffer) and Martin Bland (Bloodloss). He has also made guest appearances on several albums, most notably on Alice in Chains' 1992 EP \"Sap\".\n\nIn 1998, he made an appearance on the motion picture soundtrack for the film \"Velvet Goldmine\" with Ron Asheton, Mike Watt, Thurston Moore, and Steve Shelley under the name Wylde Ratttz.\n\nIn 1999, he recorded the vocals for the song \"I Need Somebody\", a cover of the song by The Stooges, featured on Nebula's first album, To the Center.\n\nIn 2000, Arm, Turner, Peters, Scott McCaughey, Tom Price and Bill Henderson recorded the album \"The New Original Sonic Sound\" under the band name The New Strychnines. they recorded a compilation of 16 songs by the legendary mid-60's Seattle garage band The Sonics. The album was released by Book Records.\n\nIn 2004, he toured with MC5, standing in for the late Rob Tyner on vocals.\n\nIn 2013, he contributed vocals on The Scientists' cover version of \"Set It on Fire\" from Melvins' album Everybody Loves Sausages.\n\nWhen grunge exploded in the early '90s, Arm wrote a comedic nonfiction essay about smoking pot and going to the Clinton White House with Pearl Jam.\n\nIn 2008, he told the Washington Post's Express, \"I don't smoke pot all that much. I did get stoned last night, though [laughs] – after the show. I'm not opposed smoking pot or to people smoking pot. Every now and again I smoke a joint, but I don't get stoned and come up with creative ideas. I usually get paralyzed on the couch.\"\n\nAccording to a recent article in magazine, MOJO, Mark Arm started using heroin in 1987 and by the summer of 1989, \"...it had all caught up with me.\". Apparently, the band had little patience for his addiction, so he would \"use heroin when Mudhoney were off the road, then stop as they prepared to leave. 'So I was real used to quitting,' Arm says. 'You go through these flu-like symptoms for a couple of days, then you think about it for months.'\" Arm hit his nadir on New Year's Eve 1992 when he overdosed for the fourth time. He stopped using heroin in 1993 upon becoming involved with Emily Rieman, now his wife.\n\n\n"}

She was a small vessel, originally a whaler, of 214 tons. She is best known for being the first Norwegian unit to engage the German invasion forces during the 1940 Operation Weserübung.\n\n\"Pol III\" was built by Akers mekaniske verksted as build no. 429 in 1926. She was requisitioned by the Royal Norwegian Navy in 1939 and pressed into service as a guard vessel in the Oslofjord. \nLate on 8 April 1940 the guard vessel spotted the German Kampfgruppe 5 heading north as part of the German invasion of Norway. Despite being seriously outnumbered - the Kampfgruppe consisted of the heavy cruiser \"Blücher\", the heavy cruiser \"Lützow\", the light cruiser \"Emden\", three torpedo boats and eight minesweepers carrying 2,000 troops to Oslo - \"Pol III\" engaged the German forces. After firing a warning shot, \"Pol III\" closed with the German torpedo boat \"Albatros\". Realising that the enemy would not turn away, but was going to violate Norwegian neutrality, \"Pol III\" fired flares to alert Norwegian coastal batteries and rammed \"Albatros\" in the side. From \"Albatros\" it was clear that the guns on \"Pol III\" were manned, and that the Norwegians intended to fight. \"Albatros\" hit the small Norwegian vessel with anti aircraft fire, wounding the captain, Leif Welding-Olsen, and starting several fires. As \"Pol III\" was burning, her crew abandoned the vessel and was captured. Leif Welding-Olsen, weakened by blood loss, did not manage to enter the lifeboat and drowned, becoming the first Norwegian fatality in open war between Norway and Nazi Germany.\n\nKampfgruppe 5 was temporarily turned back by Oscarsborg Fortress a few hours later, with the loss of the heavy cruiser \"Blücher\".\n\nThe next day, 9 April, \"Pol III\" was towed to Tønsberg. The German Kriegsmarine captured her on 14 April, and after repairs utilised the vessel as a Vorpostenboot under several names (NO-05 Samoa, V-6105 and NH-05). \nAfter the war, \"Pol III\" became part of the Norwegian mine sweeping fleet before she was sold off. Later \"Pol III\" had several different owners and names, the engines replaced and her structure rebuilt. In 1949 she was sold to Hareid where she was rebuilt as a fishing vessel and given the name \"Johan E\". In 1978 she was sold to Ørnes and rebuilt as a fish transport vessel and named \"Odd Oscar\". Five years later she was sold to Bodø and given the name \"Fisktrans\". Although in essence a different vessel than in 1940, the hull of \"Pol III\" remained afloat and in use for many years. In her last guise, she was owned in Salten and had the name \"Arnøytrans\". She ran as a fish transport vessel along the Norwegian coast.\n\nOn 1 October 2011, she was sailed on own power to \"Fosen Gjenvinning\" breaker's yard at Revsnes in Sør-Trøndelag for scrapping.\n\nSome of her hull plates survived and are in the care of the Larvik Maritime Museum.\n\n"}

LZSS was described in article \"Data compression via textual substitution\" published in \"Journal of the ACM\" (1982, pp. 928–951).\n\nLZSS is a dictionary coding technique. It attempts to replace a string of symbols with a reference to a dictionary location of the same string.\n\nThe main difference between LZ77 and LZSS is that in LZ77 the dictionary reference could actually be longer than the string it was replacing. In LZSS, such references are omitted if the length is less than the \"break even\" point. Furthermore, LZSS uses one-bit flags to indicate whether the next chunk of data is a literal (byte) or a reference to an offset/length pair.\n\nHere is the beginning of Dr. Seuss's \"Green Eggs and Ham\", with character numbers at the beginning of lines for convenience. Green Eggs and Ham is an optimal example to illustrate LZSS compression because the book itself only contains 50 unique words, despite having a word count of 170. Thus, words are repeated, however not in succession.\nThis text takes 177 bytes in uncompressed form. Assuming a break even point of 2 bytes (and thus 2 byte pointer/offset pairs), and one byte newlines, this text compressed with LZSS becomes 94 bytes long:\n\nNote: this does not include the 12 bytes of flags indicating whether the next chunk of text is a pointer or a literal. Adding it, the text becomes 106 bytes long, which is still shorter than the original 177 bytes.\n\nMany popular archivers like PKZip, ARJ, RAR, ZOO, LHarc use LZSS rather than LZ77 as the primary compression algorithm; the encoding of literal characters and of length-distance pairs varies, with the most common option being Huffman coding. Most implementations stem from a public domain 1989 code by Haruhiko Okumura. Version 4 of the Allegro library can encode and decode an LZSS format, but the feature was cut from version 5. The Game Boy Advance BIOS can decode a slightly modified LZSS format. Apple's Mac OS X uses LZSS as one of the compression methods for kernel code.\n\n"}

Another exposition of these main teachings, expressed as \"the main features of the spirit of Opus Dei,\" can be found in the Opus Dei website .\n\nIn his Apostolic Constitution \"Ut Sit\", John Paul II declared that \"this Institution has in fact striven, not only to illuminate with new lights the mission of the laity in the Church and in society, but also to put it into practice; it has also endeavored to put into practice the teaching of the universal call to holiness, and to promote at all levels of society the sanctification of ordinary work, and by means of ordinary work.\" \n\nAccording to Dr. Pedro Rodriguez, an Opus Dei priest who specialized in studying the theology of the Roman Catholic Church (ecclesiology), Opus Dei is all about a message and an institution bearing that message. \"The message of St Josemaría,\" says José Saraiva Martins, Cardinal Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, \"belongs to the perennial patrimony of the Roman Church.\" The following are the main features of Escrivá's spiritual teachings, the core message of Opus Dei.\n\nOne central feature of Opus Dei's theology is its focus on the lives of the ordinary Catholics who are neither priests nor monks. Opus Dei emphasizes the \"universal call to holiness\": the belief that everyone should aspire to be a saint, not just a few special individuals. Opus Dei does not have monks or nuns, and only a minority of its members are part of the priesthood. Whereas the members of some religious orders might live in monasteries and devote their lives exclusively to prayer and study, most members of Opus Dei lead ordinary lives, with traditional families and conventional careers, and strive to \"sanctify ordinary life\". Indeed, Pope John Paul II called Escrivá \"the saint of ordinary life\". \nOne of the distinctive features of Opus Dei is its stress of lay spirituality - a spiritual life for lay people living an everyday life and doing ordinary work. Escriva takes decided position against the concept of having an interior spiritual life and a separate \"not spiritual\" professional, social, and family life. According to Opus Dei, Opus Dei's spirituality commits lay people to sanctify themselves in the same place where they were before they met Opus Dei and their place in the world is the \"means\" for their sanctification.\n\n\"There is something holy, something divine, hidden in the most ordinary situations,\" Escriva preached, \"and it is up to each of you to discover it.\"\n\nAccording to Escrivà, Christians can become saints and apostles right there where they work and live. Whatever work they do is to be done with a spirit of excellence as an effective service for the needs of society. Their work then becomes a fitting offering to God. Sanctifying work means to work with the spirit of Jesus Christ, to work competently and ethically, with the aim of loving God and serving others, and thus to sanctify the world from within, making the Gospel present in all activities whether they be outstanding or humble and hidden. In the eyes of God what matters is the love that is put into work, not its human success.\n\nA related characteristic is Opus Dei's emphasis on uniting spiritual life with professional, social, and family life.\n\nA Christian who practices these teachings has no double life, a life of faith divorced from daily work. Instead, he has a \"unity of life\"—a profound union with Jesus Christ, both fully God and fully man, one person in whom divine power is fused with ordinary human activity. A Christian's work should be God's work, \"opus Dei.\" This Christian, despite all his defects, which he humbly tries to remove, is \"alter Christus, ipse Christus\", another Christ, Christ himself. \n\nSt Josemaría said: “There is just one life, made of flesh and spirit. And it is this life which has to become, in both soul and body, holy and filled with God.”\n\nSince the Bible stated that man was created \"to work\" (Gen 2:15) and that Jesus \"did all things well\" (Mk 7:37), Escrivá encouraged Christians to work excellently out of love. By doing so, their work is a service to society and a fitting offering to God. \"'Great' holiness consists in carrying out the 'little duties' of each moment\", says Escrivá.\n\nEscriva preached that Christians should love freedom because God the Son himself, on becoming man, took on human freedom. He sanctified mankind through \"love\": by freely giving himself, \"obeying\" his Father's will throughout his ordinary life, \"until death on the cross.\" (Phil 2,8) Escriva notes that Jesus \"gave himself, because he wanted to.\" (Is 53,7) Through his freedom, each man controls and shapes his life, being responsible for cooperating or not with God's loving plan of holiness. Recognizing such great dignity, Christians should therefore delicately respect the freedom of others, be open to a pluralism of opinions, and give themselves, with full freedom and personal responsibility, to God and neighbor. , \n\nLove, the essence of sanctity and apostolate, is nurtured by constant childlike prayer which is supported by norms of piety involving the Eucharist, the Bible, and the Virgin Mary. Mortification, \"prayer of the senses,\" is especially done by striving to practice all the human virtues, such as being kind, hardworking, sincere and cheerful despite difficulties and failures. \"Do everything for Love. Thus there will be no little things: everything will be big...'Great' holiness consists in carrying out the 'little duties' of each moment.\" These actions are co-offered in the Holy Mass, the same redeeming sacrifice of Jesus on the cross. Sanctifying grace flows down especially through communion and confession.\n\nChristians are to give the highest importance to the virtue of charity: being understanding and caring for each person. Included are service towards the needy in society and the practice of human courtesy, refinement, warmth, affection and fraternal correction. Love, which should be orderly, starts by performing one's duties well and is first directed towards the Pope. And it overflows when one generously gives the best to people, bringing them closer to their Father God, source of peace and joy.\n\nAccording to Escrivá, the foundation of Opus Dei's spirit is a personal awareness of the Christian's \"divine filiation\". Divine filiation is the Christian's fundamental state as a daughter or son of God in Christ, a deep awareness of which brings about immense happiness: \"Joy comes from knowing we are children of God.\" Opus Dei, in the words of Escrivá, is \"a smiling asceticism.\" (See )\n\nWilliam E May, professor of moral theology at the Catholic University of America, writes that the Second Vatican Council took from Escriva the teaching that men and women are called to be saints in the midst of everyday life and cites a passage from Lumen gentium by Pope Paul VI which expresses that idea. One such passage is the following:\nThus it is evident to everyone, that all the faithful of Christ of whatever rank or status, are called to the fullness of the Christian life and to the perfection of charity; by this holiness as such a more human manner of living is promoted in this earthly society. In order that the faithful may reach this perfection, they must use their strength accordingly as they have received it, as a gift from Christ. They must follow in His footsteps and conform themselves to His image seeking the will of the Father in all things. They must devote themselves with all their being to the glory of God and the service of their neighbor. In this way, the holiness of the People of God will grow into an abundant harvest of good, as is admirably shown by the life of so many saints in Church history. (\"Lumen Gentium, 39\")\nMany Council Fathers visited and talked to St. Josemaría, who was living in Rome during the time of the Council.\n\nOn the other hand, Henri Denis, professor for dogmatics at the University of Lyon and specialist regarding Vatican II theology holds that the teachings of Vatican II and Opus Dei are incompatible, specially referring \"reconstitution of Christianity\" and the theology of Gaudium et Spes regarding the legitime autonomy of terrestrial realities.\n\nIn his opening message for the theological symposium \"Holiness and the World\", Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger stressed that the teachings on sanctity of the founder of Opus Dei are \"Christ-centred\".\n\nThe message Opus Dei is called to proclaim, that all Christians can and should become a saint, is grounded in the following premises: Christians believe that (1) they are \"poor creatures\" made of nothing \"whose pride leads (them) to rise up against God;\" (2) Christ is the almighty God, who \"has created us and maintains us in existence,\" and is the \"only one who can satisfy the longings of the human heart;\" (3) Christ is a Savior who is \"madly in love\" with us and who is the one most interested in that we live in communion with him in infinite bliss: \"He chose us in him before the foundation of the world, to be saints and blameless in his sight\" (Eph 1:4). Through his love and redemption, he has given us the immense dignity of being \"children of God\"; \n(4) \"This Christ who is alive is also a Christ who is near,\" says Ratzinger of Escrivá's thought, \"a Christ in whom the power and majesty of God make themselves present through ordinary, simple, human things.\" \n\nThe theological basis then is a God who is always at work in the world, who waits as a Merciful Father in the Sacrament of Reconciliation and personally searches for man through the Eucharist. This God makes himself \"totally available,\" says Escrivá, to nourish the Christian so as to become \"one single thing with him.\" Given the gift of this \"divinization\" in grace, \"a new principle of energy,\" and with the support of \"Christ's family,\" the Church, Escrivá states that the difficult ideal of becoming a saint, another Christ, is \"also easy. It is within our reach.\" For this, he refers to Christ's famous \"My yoke is easy and my burden light.\" (Mt 11:30) Thus, according to Ratzinger (2002), becoming a saint is shunned when there is a \"mistaken concept of holiness...as something reserved for some 'greats'...who are completely different from us ordinary sinners. But this is a wrong perception which has been corrected precisely by Josemaría Escrivá.\" Even if he \"can be very weak, with many mistakes in his life,\" a saint has heroic virtue \"because he has been transparent and available for the work of God. In other words, a saint is nothing other than to speak with God as a friend speaks with a friend...the Only One who can really make the world both good and happy,\" according to the theological analysis of the then Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. As Pope he stated: \"it is not a burden to be carried by a great love and a revelation, but it is like having wings.\" \n\nSanctification is a repayment of love for God's tender fatherly love and is the work of the Holy Spirit, Infinite Love, according to Catholic doctrine. This person resides in a Christian who is willing to correspond, and thus the human spirit which was created to love, says Escrivá, is led along an \"inclined plane,\" which starts with the fervent repetition of short prayers and then \"gives way to intimacy with God, looking at God without needing rest or feeling tired.\" And so, one of his favourite teachings is the biblical injunction that all should love God with their \"whole\" heart, soul, might, and mind. This is a love which does not keep anything back, a kind of love which parents are supposed to transmit all day long to their children (Deut 6:4-9: Shema Yisrael), and which Christ called the \"greatest commandment\" (Mt 22:37-40). Escrivá also points to Jesus' \"new commandment\" to love one another \"as I have loved you\" (Jn 13:34), \"greater love\" than which \"no man has\" for he \"lays down his life for his friends\" (Jn 15:13). According to the \"Catechism\", this \"effective self-offering\" is \"our model of holiness\" (no. 459). For Escrivá this is \"the level of what can be demanded\" of all Christians. \n\nAffirming that the \"Church's first purpose is to be the sacrament of the inner union of men with God\" (\"CCC\" 775), John Paul II, in the Apostolic Letter \"At the Beginning of the New Millennium\", placed sanctity, \"this high standard of ordinary Christian living,\" as the single most important priority of all pastoral activities in the universal Church \"for all times.\" And for this, Catholics are to live a \"life distinguished above all in the art of prayer\" and should proclaim God's word \"without ever hiding the most radical demands of the Gospel message.\"\n\nHowever, some critics refer to the late Hans Urs von Balthasar, considered one of the greatest theologians of the 20th century, who discussed Opus Dei in an article entitled \"Fundamentalism.\" There he described it as \"a concentration of fundamentalist power in the Church.\" (article in \"Wort und Wahrheit\", 1963). He based his negative views on his reading of some points of Escriva's main book, The Way, which von Balthasar did not consider of sufficient spiritual depth for its worldwide goals. On the other hand, V. Messori, who studied the von Balthasar issue, says that the theologian later retracted his views after more in-depth study and after meeting members of Opus Dei. He even defended Opus Dei against attacks.\n\nA Christian becomes a saint, according to Opus Dei's founder, principally through God's mercy, and thus he emphasised frequent confession and other means of sanctification: \nEscrivá says one cannot love someone who is not known. Thus he says Christians should have \"the piety of children and the sure doctrine of theologians\".\n\nHe holds that the \"paramount means\" of training is one-on-one coaching through spiritual direction, a practice which has its roots in the early Church. According to Cornelio Fabro, eminent Italian philosopher, Opus Dei's training fosters the human virtues, habits which are developed through the repetition of free decisions in one's activities and professional work. These habits of human excellence, including love for the truth, courage, and generosity, are the \"foundation\", Escrivá says, of the supernatural virtues of faith and love for God. Training in Opus Dei is based on the single-sex education model.\n\nMembers of Opus Dei (numeraries as well as supernumeraries) follow the Opus Dei \"Plan of Life\"—a daily regimen of prayer, meditation, and religious ceremonies. The \"plan of life\" established by Escriva has changed little throughout the decades. The specific practices in the \"plan of life\" are referred to as \"norms\". The plan consists of the following norms:\n\n\nEscriva's teachings were analyzed, studied and endorsed in a theological symposium held in Rome, \"Holiness and the World\". Together with an address by John Paul II, several theologians contributed their studies, including the then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, Georges Cottier, Theologian of the Papal Household, and noted American moral theologian Prof. William May. \n\nSome critics belittle the writings of the founder, saying that they are \"less than scintillating.\" In \"Opus Dei in the United States\", Jesuit scholar, Fr. James Martin (1995), says that Escriva's maxims range \"from traditional Christian pieties...to sayings that could easily have come out of \"Poor Richard’s Almanack\".\" Critics also say that the teachings are Escriva-centred.\n\nIn contrast, Catholic officials, specifically the Vatican's theological consultors for Escriva's canonization gave another assessment of Escriva's works. One said that Escriva is \"like a figure from the deepest spiritual sources\"; another stated that he \"possesses the force of the classic writers, the temper of a Father of the Church.\"\n\nThus, these teachings do not lie outside mainstream traditional Roman Catholic spiritual and ascetic theology. According to Le Tourneau in \"What is Opus Dei?\", these teachings \"belong to the common patrimony of the Catholic Church, throwing a special light on secular realities.\" These teachings then form a lay spirituality, and help build the spirit or culture which is practised in the Work.\n\n Opus Dei: Mission of Opus Dei\n\nEscriva, Josemaria (1993). \"Conversations With Josemaria Escriva\" Sydney New York: Little Hills & Scepter.\n"}

The pessimistic meta-induction undermines the realist's warrant for their epistemic optimism (the view that science tends to succeed in revealing what the world is like and that there are good reasons to take theories to be true or truthlike) via historical counterexample. Using meta-induction, Larry Laudan argues that if past scientific theories which were successful were found to be false, we have no reason to believe the realist's claim that our currently successful theories are approximately true. The pessimistic meta-induction argument was first fully postulated by Laudan in 1981.\n\nHowever, there are some objections to Laudan's theory. One might see shortcomings in the historic examples Laudan gives as proof of his hypothesis. Theories later refuted, like that of crystalline spheres in astronomy, or the phlogiston theory, do not represent the most successful theories at their time. A further objection tries to point out that in scientific progress we indeed approximate the truth. When we develop a new theory, the central ideas of the old one usually become refuted. Parts of the old theory, however, we carry over to the new one. In doing so, our theories become more and more well-founded on other principles, they become better in terms of predictive and descriptive power, so that, for example, aeroplanes, computers and DNA sequencing all establish technical, operational proof of the effectiveness of the theories. Therefore, we can hold the realist view that our theoretical terms refer to something in the world and our theories are approximately true.\n\nHowever, as articulated by Thomas S. Kuhn in his \"Structure of Scientific Revolutions\", new scientific theories do not always build upon the older ones. In fact, they are created by an entirely new set of premises (a new \"paradigm\"), and reach vastly different conclusions. This gives greater weight to the proponents of anti-realism, and illustrates that no scientific theory (thus far) has proved infallible.\n\n\n"}

An accompanying music video, directed by Michael Haussman, premiered on the finale of \"Britney & Kevin: Chaotic\". Entirely shot in black-and-white, the music video features Spears as a pregnant woman and portrays a transformation of her character.\n\nIn July 2004, Spears announced her engagement to American dancer Kevin Federline, whom she had met three months before. The romance received intense attention from the media, since Federline had recently broken up with actress Shar Jackson, who was still pregnant with their second child at the time. The initial stages of their relationship were chronicled in Spears's first reality show \"\". They held a wedding ceremony on September 18, 2004, but were not legally married until three weeks later on October 6 due to a delay finalizing the couple's prenuptial agreement. In October 2004, the singer announced she would be taking another career break to start a family. Spears gave birth to her first child, Sean Preston Federline, on September 14, 2005.\n\n\"Someday (I Will Understand)\" was composed by Spears on the piano at her house, two weeks before she learned of her pregnancy with Sean Preston. She explained the song came \"like a prophecy... when you're pregnant, you're empowered\". It was produced by Guy Sigsworth, who previously worked with the singer on \"Everytime\" (2003). Spears recorded her vocals for the song at Conway Studios in Los Angeles, California, and at Frou Frou Central in London. The piano was played by Spears herself, while all other instruments and mixing were done by Sigsworth. Background vocals for the song were provided by Kate Havnevik.\n\n\"Someday (I Will Understand)\" initially received mixed reviews from music critics. While reviewing \"\", Mike McGuirk of Rhapsody noted, \"Britney now sings about either the husband or the kid. Gil Kaufman of MTV thought the song a \"horrible Britney ballad with the black-and-white video that began her descent into madness.\" Leo Ebersole of the \"Chicago Tribune\" considered it \"a fictional piece\", while another reviewer from the same newspaper noted that \"as a matter of fact, the song is more or less a lesson in Britney history.\" Becky Bain of Idolator praised the track, stating that \"Britney goes genuine for this ode to her unborn baby.\" Kurt Kirton of About.com said that \"And Then We Kiss\" and other remixes of songs like \"Toxic\" and \"Someday (I Will Understand)\" on the remix album \"\" \"hold their own\". IGN writer Spence D. noted the Hi-Bias Signature Radio Remix \"reverberates with all the clichés that often stifle the music that rustles through the late night/early morning club scenes around the world.\" \"Rolling Stone\" contributor Barry Walters gave the song's remix a negative review, saying that \"nothing can rescue Spears' freakishly sappy flop single \"Someday (I Will Understand)\".\" Bradley Stern also of MTV, however, praised the Leama & Moor Remix, saying it \"transforms the tearjerker of a ballad into a full-on trance anthem. Big beats, stuttering vocals -- it's heartbreak on the dance floor.\"\n\nOver the years following its release, attitude toward the song began to change for the positive. Ten years after its release, a reviewer for AXS called the song \"serene\" and the \"most sincere single of her career.\" A writer for \"MuuMuse\" said that while the song was not career-defining, it was \"interesting, and certainly personal.\"\n\nOn September 1, 2005, \"Someday (I Will Understand)\" debuted at number 46 on the Swedish Singles Chart.

He was a pupil of Eduard Marxsen in Altona and belonged to the circle of musicians around Johannes Brahms, who was also a pupil of Marxsen. Later, Thieriot was a pupil of Josef Rheinberger in Munich. A close, friendly relationship connected him with his teachers all his life. Thieriot was married to a publisher’s daughter (Ernst Berens, Hamburg), Else Berens. The marriage remained childless. He worked as a music teacher and musical director in Hamburg, Ansbach, Leipzig (1867) and Glogau (1868-1870). Later Brahms recommended Thieriot for the position of “Artistic Director” of the Styrian Music Association in Graz (1870-1885). The composer always received high praise in concert reviews: “… and met with a warm and friendly reception by the audience and deservedly so. … Excellent work, clarity and good taste regarding the instrumentation; employment of dignified motives full of character … Enrichment of the concert repertoire.” From March 1902 onwards, Thieriot had his home again in Hamburg where he lived until his death. (Performances of his works in concerts at the Hamburg Philharmonic and Singing Academy as well as in Leipzig where he obtained a post in 1897 at the Directorium of the Bach Gesellschaft in Leipzig).\n\nThieriot's chamber music constitutes a great part of his total output and is judged to be among his finest compositions. He is known to have composed 4 piano trios: Opp.14, 45, 47 & 90, 13 string quartets, only two of which have been published, 2 Octets (Op.78 for 4 violins, 2 violas and 2 cellos and Op.62 for 2 violins, viola, cello, bass, clarinet, horn, and bassoon) a quartet for flute and string trio Op.84, a quintet for piano and winds Op.80, a quintet for piano and string quartet Op.20 and several instrumental sonatas. In addition to the above, several unpublished compositions remain in manuscript awaiting publication.\n\nWilhelm Altmann, one of the most influential and perceptive chamber music critics of all time, writing of Thieriot's chamber music, states:\n\"\"Thieriot's chamber music is without exception noble and pure. He writes with perfect command of form and expression.\"\"\n\nThieriot died in Hamburg.\n\n\n"}

It is next to the Atlantic Ocean and just 22 km from the province capital, Huelva. In 2017, it had 3998 inhabitants, but the population is much higher in summer.\n\nMazagón was created in the late 19th century, mainly because of the fishing, the agriculture and the residential purpose in summer. Lots of families of the towns around Mazagón built their holiday houses here. But when tourists went in a higher quantity, some bars or shops were created, as well as districts.\n\nEl principal reclamo son sus extensas playas y la proximidad a los espacios naturales del Parque Nacional y Natural de Doñana, los Parajes Naturales de las Lagunas de Palos y Las madres, y el Estero Domingo Rubio; así como el carácter colombino y juanramoniano que le confieren sus núcleos matrices. Mazagón cuenta con las playas más vírgenes de la provincia de Huelva, además posee un entorno natural con el médano dunar y los pinares como elementos destacados. Delimita con el Parque Nacional de Doñana por el noreste, donde comienza la denominada Playa de Castilla. Obstenta bandera azul en su Parador y puerto\n\nThe main interest of Mazagón is its long beaches of white sand and its proximity to the National and Natural Park Doñana. Also it belongs to Palos, from where Columbus set off to America, and to Moguer, were the Nobel prize Juan Ramón Jiménez was born.\n\nMazagón has the best beaches in whole the province, with dunes and pines. It has blue flag in its Port and Parador Beach.\n\nMazagón has an important independence movement since 1996, when a new political party took part in the Municipal Elections. Almost all people in Mazagón wanted and want to be independent because Moguer and Palos do not control it well. However, the Junta de Andalucía (Government of Andalusia), said in 2008 that Mazagón couldn't be a new town. Nowadays there is still hope so AVEMA, the Separatist Party is the third main power in whole the area (Moguer, Palos and Mazagón):\n\nAbout tourism, Mazagón has gotten better, however it is not an important touristic place out of Andalusia. Often you find that there are other Andalusian families with houses in Mazagón, or just Spanish people coming there. There is some foreign tourism, but it comes to Mazagón, mostly, to enjoy the Natural Park Doñana.\n\nThere are several hotels and apartment buildings in Mazagón.\n\nThere are 3 main zones in Mazagón:\n\n\nIn Mazagón there is a huge sort of activities, from traditional sports like basketball or football, to interesting and new ones like parachuting or surf.\n"}

It has been the home of the US Open Grand Slam tennis tournament, played every year in August and September, since 1978 and is operated by the United States Tennis Association (USTA). The facility has 22 courts inside its and 12 in the adjoining park. The complex's three stadiums are among the largest tennis stadiums in the world; Arthur Ashe Stadium tops the global list with a listed capacity of 23,200. All 33 courts have used the DecoTurf cushioned acrylic surface since the facility was built in 1978.\n\nNear Citi Field (home of the New York Mets) as well as LaGuardia Airport, the tennis center is open to the public for play except during the US Open, junior and wood-racquet competitions.\n\nFormerly called the USTA National Tennis Center, the facility was rededicated for Billie Jean King on August 28, 2006.\n\nThe idea of the tennis center came about in January 1977, when William Hester, the then-incoming president of the USTA, saw the underused Singer Bowl on a flight into nearby LaGuardia Airport. He asked the City of New York to let him use the stadium and adjoining land for a tennis facility to host the U.S. Open. The stadium was heavily renovated and divided into two venues: Louis Armstrong Stadium and the adjoining grandstand. The National Tennis Center opened in August 1978.\n\nAfter rumors of a possible move to San Diego, a major upgrade and expansion began in March 1995. More land was committed to the USTA National Tennis Center, and in August 1997 the newly built Arthur Ashe Stadium replaced Louis Armstrong Stadium as the main court. The four-year expansion was completed in 1999. Arthur Ashe Stadium holds more than 22,000 spectators while Louis Armstrong Stadium was downsized to hold just 10,000 spectators (the original size was 18,000). In 2006, at the location of the old indoor tennis building near the East Gate, work began on a 245,000-square-foot, multi-purpose tennis pavilion. The new facility was completed in 2008 and includes 12 courts, classrooms, fitness facilities, and a pro shop. It also includes a hospitality center, museum, and food commissary. Other renovations included the players’ lounge, locker rooms, and medical, training and office space.\n\nIn 2011, the facility opened a new show court, Court 17, located in the southeast corner of the grounds, seating 2,500 to 3,000, making it small in comparison to the facility's other show courts. Next in size after those courts — Arthur Ashe Stadium, Louis Armstrong Stadium, and the Grandstand (the latter with a capacity of 8,125) — the court has large television screens and Hawk-Eye electronic line-calling capability which allows for player challenges. In constructing the new court, foundations from the 1939 and 1964 World's Fair were discovered, and the water table was found to be several feet higher than expected. Because the playing surface of Court 17 is below ground level, the new court has received the nickname of \"The Pit\".\n\nThe center is in the middle of a $550 million renovation that has included the erection of a retractable roof on Arthur Ashe Stadium, which was completed for the 2017 US Open. A new show court was opened in 2016 in the southwest corner of the complex. It has 8,125 seats, making it the third largest court in the center, and replaces the old Grandstand. A new, 14,000-seat Louis Armstrong Stadium (also with a retractable roof) has been constructed on the site of the original stadium, and was completed in time for the 2018 US Open.\n\nIn July 2008, the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center and Arthur Ashe Stadium hosted its first ever non-tennis event, when the New York Liberty of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) played in the \"Liberty Outdoor Classic: 2008\". The game itself was the first ever professional basketball regular season game ever played outdoors in the USA, by either men or women. The contest featured the Indiana Fever defeating the New York Liberty.\n\nUSTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center is the site of the annual New York State High School tennis championships, held in May. This tournament is sponsored by the New York State Public High School Athletic Association (NYSPHSAA).\n\nIn March 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the city proposed building a temporary 350-bed field hospital in the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center to treat overflow patients from area hospitals.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2211475", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2211475", "title": "Anaerobic lagoon", "text": "Anaerobic lagoon\n\nAn anaerobic lagoon or manure lagoon is a man-made outdoor earthen basin filled with animal waste that undergoes anaerobic respiration as part of a system designed to manage and treat refuse created by concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs). Anaerobic lagoons are created from a manure slurry, which is washed out from underneath the animal pens and then piped into the lagoon. Sometimes the slurry is placed in an intermediate holding tank under or next to the barns before it is deposited in a lagoon. Once in the lagoon, the manure settles into two layers: a solid or sludge layer and a liquid layer. The manure then undergoes the process of anaerobic respiration, whereby the volatile organic compounds are converted into carbon dioxide and methane. Anaerobic lagoons are usually used to pretreat high strength industrial wastewaters, and municipal wastewaters. This allows for preliminary sedimentation of suspended solids as a pretreatment process.\n\nAnaerobic lagoons have been shown to harbor and emit substances which can cause adverse environmental and health effects. These substances are emitted through two main pathways: gas emissions and lagoon overflow. Gas emissions are continuous (though the amount may vary based on the season) and are a product of the manure slurry itself. The most prevalent gasses emitted by the lagoon are: ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, methane, and carbon dioxide. Lagoon overflow is caused by faulty lagoons, such as cracks or improper construction, or adverse weather conditions, such as increased rainfall or strong winds. These overflows release harmful substances into the surrounding land and water such as: antibiotics, estrogens, bacteria, pesticides, heavy metals, and protozoa.\n\nIn the US, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has responded to environmental and health concerns by strengthening regulation of CAFOs under the Clean Water Act (CWA). Some states have imposed their own regulations as well. Due to repeated overflows and resultant health concerns, North Carolina banned the construction of new anaerobic lagoons in 1999. There has also been a significant push for the research, development and implementation of environmentally sound technologies (ESTs) which would allow for safer containment and recycling of CAFO waste.\n\nBeginning in the 1950s with poultry production, and then later in the 1970s and 1980s with cattle and swine, meat producers in the United States have turned to concentrated animal feeding operation (CAFO) as a way to more efficiently produce large quantities of meat. This switch has benefited the United States consumer by increasing the amount of meat that can be grown thereby decreasing the price of meat. However, the increase in livestock has generated an increase in manure. In 2006, for example, livestock operations in the United States produced of manure. Unlike manure produced in a conventional farm, CAFO manure cannot all be used as direct fertilizer on agricultural land due to the poor quality of the manure. Moreover, CAFOs produce a high volume of manure. A feeding operation with 800,000 pigs could produce over of waste a year. The high quantity of manure produced by a CAFO must be dealt with in some way, as improper manure management can result in water, air and soil damage. As a result, manure collection and disposal has become an increasing problem.\n\nIn order to manage their waste, CAFOs have developed agricultural wastewater treatment plans. To save on manual labor, many CAFOs handle manure waste as a liquid. In this system, the animals are kept in pens with grated floors so the waste and spray water can be drained from underfloor gutters and piped to storage tanks or anaerobic lagoons. Once at a lagoon, the purpose is to treat the waste and make it suitable for spreading on agricultural fields. There are three main types of lagoon: anaerobic, which is inhibited by oxygen; aerobic, which requires oxygen; and facultative, which is maintained with or without oxygen. Aerobic lagoons provide a higher degree of treatment with less odor production, though they require a significant amount of space and maintenance. Because of this demand, almost all livestock lagoons are anaerobic lagoons.\n\nAnaerobic lagoons are earthen basins with a usual depth of , though greater depths are more beneficial to digestion as they minimize oxygen diffusion from the surface. To minimize leakage of animal waste into the ground water, newer lagoons are generally lined with clay Studies have shown that in fact the lagoons typically leak at a rate of approximately per day, with or without a clay liner, because it is the sludge deposited at the base of the lagoon that limits the leakage rate, not the clay liner or underlying native soil. Anaerobic lagoons are not heated, aerated or mixed. Anaerobic lagoons are most effective in warmer temperatures; anaerobic bacteria are ineffective below Lagoons must be separated from other structures by a certain distance to prevent contamination. States regulate this separation distance. The overall size of the lagoon is determined by addition of four components: minimum design volume, volume of manure storage between periods of disposal, dilution volume and the volume of sludge accumulation between periods of sludge removal.\n\nThe lagoon is divided into two distinct layers: sludge and liquid. The sludge layer is a more solid layer formed by the stratification of sediments from the manure. After a while, this solid layer accumulates and eventually needs to be cleaned out. The liquid level is composed of grease, scum and other particulates. The liquid level CAFO wastewater enters at the bottom of the lagoon so that it can mix with the active microbial mass in the sludge layer. These anaerobic conditions are uniform throughout the lagoon, except in a small surface level. Sometimes aeration is applied to this level to dampen the odors emitted by the lagoons. If surface aeration is not applied, a crust will form that will trap heat and odors. Anaerobic lagoons should retain and treat wastewater from 20 to 150 days. Lagoons should be followed by aerobic or facultative lagoons to provide further required treatment. The liquid layer is periodically drained and used for fertilizer. In some instances, a cover can be provided to trap methane, which is used for energy. Anaerobic Lagoons work through a process called anaerobic digestion. Decomposition of the organic matter begins shortly after the animals void. Lagoons become anaerobic due to the high biological oxygen demand (BOD) of the feces, which contains a high level of soluble solids, resulting in higher BOD. Anaerobic microorganisms convert organic compounds into carbon dioxide and methane through acid formation and methane production.\n\n\n\nRates of asthma in children living near a CAFO are consistently elevated. The process of anaerobic digestion has been shown to release over 400 volatile compounds from lagoons. The most prevalent of these are: ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, methane, and carbon dioxide.\n\nIn the United States, 80 percent of ammonia emissions come from livestock production. A lagoon can vaporize up to 80 percent of its nitrogen through the reaction: NH4+-N -> NH3 + H+. As pH or temperature increases, so does the amount of volatilized ammonia. Once ammonia has been volatilized, it can travel as far as 300 miles, and at closer ranges it is a respiratory irritant. Acidification and eutrophication of the ecosystem surrounding the lagoons could be caused by prolonged exposure to volatilized ammonia. This volatilized ammonia has been implicated in widespread ecological damage in Europe and is of growing concern for the United States.\n\nWith averages greater than 30ppb, lagoons have high concentration of hydrogen sulfide, which is highly toxic. A study by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency has found that concentrations of Hydrogen sulfide near lagoons have exceeded the state standard, even as far away as 4.9 miles. Hydrogen sulfide is recognizable for its unpleasant rotten-egg odor. Because hydrogen sulfide is heavier than air, it tends to linger around lagoons even after ventilation. Levels of hydrogen sulfide are at their highest after agitation and during manure removal.\n\nMethane is an odorless, tasteless, and colorless gas. Lagoons produce about 2,300,000 tonnes per year, with around 40 percent of this mass coming from hog farm lagoons. Methane is combustible at high temperatures and explosions and fires are a real threat at, or near, lagoons. Additionally, methane is a greenhouse gas. The U.S. EPA estimated that 13 percent of all the methane emissions came from livestock manure in 1998, and this number has grown in recent years. Recently there has been interest in technology which would capture methane produced from lagoons and sell it as energy.\n\nContaminants that are water-soluble can escape from anaerobic lagoons and enter the environment through leakage from badly constructed or poorly maintained manure lagoons as well as during excess rain or high winds, resulting in an overflow of lagoons. These leaks and overflows can contaminate surrounding surface and ground water with some hazardous materials which are contained in the lagoon. The most serious of these contaminants are pathogens, antibiotics, heavy metals and hormones. For example, runoff from farms in Maryland and North Carolina are a leading candidate for \"Pfiesteria piscicida.\" This contaminant has the ability to kill fish, and it can also cause skin irritation and short term memory loss in humans\n\nMore than 150 pathogens in manure lagoons that have been found to impact human health. Healthy individuals who come into contact with pathogens usually recover promptly. However, those who have a weakened immune system, such as cancer patients and young children, have an increased risk for a more severe illness or even death. About 20 percent of the U.S. population are categorized in this risk group. Some of the more notable pathogens are:\n\nE. coli is found in the intestines and feces of both animal and humans. One particularly virulent strain, , is found specifically in the lumen of cattle raised in CAFOs. Because cattle are fed corn in CAFOs instead of grass, this changes the pH of the lumen so that it is more hospitable to \"E\". \"coli\". Grain-fed cattle have 80 percent more of this strain of \"E\". \"coli\" than grass-fed cattle. However, the amount of \"E\". \"coli\" found in the lumen of grain fed cattle can be significantly reduced by switching an animal to grass only a few days prior to slaughter. This reduction would decrease the pathogen's presence in both meat and waste of the cattle, and decrease the \"E\". \"coli\" population found in anaerobic lagoons.\n\nIn 1999, Hurricane Floyd hit North Carolina, flooding hog waste lagoons, releasing 25 million gallons of manure into the New River and contaminating the water supply. Ronnie Kennedy, county director for environmental health, said that of 310 private wells he had tested for contamination since the storm, 9 percent, or three times the average across eastern North Carolina, had fecal coliform bacteria. Normally, tests showing any hint of feces in drinking water, an indication that it can be carrying disease-causing pathogens, are cause for immediate action.\n\nCryptosporidium is a parasite that causes diarrhea, vomiting, stomach cramps and fever. It is particularly problematic because it is resistant to most lagoon treatment regimens In a study performed in Canada, 37 percent of swine liquid-manure samples contained Cryptosporidium.\n\nOther common pathogens (and their symptoms) include: \n\nAntibiotics are fed to livestock to prevent disease and to increase weight and development, so that there is a shortened time from birth to slaughter. However, because these antibiotics are administered at sub-therapeutic levels, bacterial colonies can build up resistance to the drugs through the natural selection of bacteria resistant to these antibiotics. These antibiotic-resistant bacteria are then excreted and transferred to the lagoons, where they can infect humans and other animals.\n\nEach year, 24.6 million pounds of antimicrobials are administered to livestock for non-therapeutic purposes. Seventy percent of all antibiotics and related drugs are given to animals as feed additives. Nearly half of the antibiotics used are nearly identical to ones given to humans. There is strong evidence that the use of antibiotics in animal feed is contributing to an increase in antibiotic-resistant microbes and causing antibiotics to be less effective for humans. Due to concerns over antibiotic-resistant bacteria, the American Medical Association passed a resolution stating its opposition to the use of sub-therapeutic levels of antimicrobials in livestock.\n\nGrowth hormones such as rBST, estrogen, and testosterone are administered to increase development rate and muscle mass for the livestock. Yet, only a fraction of these hormones are actually absorbed by the animal. The rest are excreted and wind up in lagoons. Studies have shown that these hormones, if they escape the lagoon and are emitted into the surrounding surface water, can alter fertility and reproductive habits of aquatic animals.\n\nOne study found that several lagoons and monitoring wells from two facilities (a nursery and a farrowing sow operation) contained high levels of all three types of estrogen. For the nursery, lagoon effluent concentrations ranged from 390 to 620 ng/L for estrone, 180 to 220 ng/L for estriol, and 40 to 50 ng/L for estradiol. For the farrowing sow operation, digester and primary lagoon effluent concentrations ranged from 9,600 to 24,900 ng/L for estrone, 5,000 to 10,400 ng/L for estriol, and 2,200 to 3,000 ng/L for estradiol. Ethinylestradiol was not detected in any of the lagoon or ground water samples. Natural estrogen concentrations in ground water samples were generally less than 0.4 ng/L, although, a few wells at the nursery operation showed quantifiable but low levels.\"\n\nManure contains trace elements of many heavy metals such as arsenic, copper, selenium, zinc, cadmium, molybdenum, nickel, lead, iron, manganese, aluminum and boron. Sometimes these metals are given to animals as growth stimulants, some are introduced through pesticides used to rid livestock of insects, and some might pass through the animals as undigested food. Trace elements of these metals and salts from animal manure present risks to human health and ecosystems.\n\nAnaerobic lagoons are built as part of a wastewater operation system. As such, compliance and permitting are handled as an extension of that operation. Therefore, manure lagoons are regulated on the state and national level through the CAFO which operates them. In recent years, because of the environmental and health effects associated with anaerobic lagoons, the EPA has increased regulation of CAFOs with a specific eye towards lagoons. Additionally, on a state level, due to the same safety concerns North Carolina banned the construction of new anaerobic lagoons in 1999 and upheld that ban in 2007.\n\nSome research has been done to develop and assess the economic feasibility of more environmentally superior technologies. Five main alternatives which have been implemented in North Carolina are: a solids separation/nitrification–denitrification/soluble phosphorus removal system; a thermophilic anaerobic digester system; a centralized composting system; a gasification system; and a fluidized-bed combustion system. These systems were judged based on their ability to: reduce impacts of CAFO waste in the surface and groundwater, decrease ammonia emissions, decrease the escape of disease-transmitting pathogens, and lower the concentration of heavy metal contamination.\n\nThe US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has also evaluated the prospect of creating a cap-and-trade program for CAFO's carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions. This program has yet to be implemented, however the USDA speculates that such a program would encourage corporations to adopt EST practices.\n\nFinally, a more comprehensive study of anaerobic swine lagoons nationwide has been launched by the US Agricultural Research Service. this study aims to explore the composition of lagoons and anaerobic lagoon influence on environmental factors and agronomic practices.\n\n"}

Like many parasites, it relied on multiple hosts, and its disappearance is hypothesized to be associated with declines in some of these hosts. The thornback ray \"Raja clavata\" and the barndoor skate \"Dipturus laevis\" were hosts for the adult form, and have declined because they are killed as bycatch in fisheries.

(formerly Corus Group plc) is a steelmaking company headquartered in London, United Kingdom, with its main operations in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.\n\nCorus Group was formed through the merger of Koninklijke Hoogovens and British Steel plc in 1999 and was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. It was acquired by Tata of India in 2007, and renamed Tata Steel Europe in September 2010.\n\nAt formation Corus operated steelmaking plants (blast furnaces) in Port Talbot, Wales; Scunthorpe and Teesside, England; and IJmuiden, the Netherlands, with additional steelmaking facilities in Rotherham, England (electric arc furnace), as well as downstream steel production of both long and flat steel.\n\nProfitability at the business was affected by the aftermath of the Financial crisis of 2007–08 (see Great Recession): the Teesside plant was mothballed and sold in 2009/2010; the long products division including the steelworks at Scunthorpe was sold for a nominal sum to Greybull Capital in April 2016.\n\nIn September 2017, Tata Steel Ltd reached an agreement to merge its European steel business with the German steel manufacturer ThyssenKrupp to form a joint venture headquartered in Amsterdam. The agreement subsequently failed.\n\nBritish Steel plc was a large British steel producer, consisting of the assets of former private companies which had been nationalised on 28 July 1967 by the Labour Party government of Harold Wilson. On 5 December 1988 the company was privatised as a result of the British Steel Act 1988. Koninklijke Hoogovens was a Dutch steel producer founded in 1918, located in IJmuiden.\n\nIn October 1999, British Steel merged with Koninklijke Hoogovens to form Corus Group. At formation the steel company was the largest in Europe and the third largest worldwide. The French steel company Sogerail, specialising in rail manufacture, was acquired in 1999 shortly before the merger of BSC for £83 million.\n\nIn 2001 Corus announced it was to cut 6,050 jobs between 2001 and 2003.\n\nIn 2003 Corus became the sole owner of SEGAL, a galvanizing company established 1983 as a joint venture.\n\nIn March 2006, Corus announced that it had agreed to sell its aluminium rolled products and extrusions businesses to Aleris International, Inc. for €728million (£572 million). Corus was to retain its smelting operations and supply Aleris under a long-term agreement. On 1 August, the sale to Aleris Europe was completed. The sale took place in May 2006.\n\nIn 2006 the Mannstaedt works (Troisdorf, Germany, special profiles, acquired by BSC in 1990) was sold to Georgsmarienhütte (GMH Holding).\n\nOn 20 October 2006, Corus announced that it had accepted at £4.3 billion ($8.1 billion) offer from Tata Steel; a valuation of £4.55 per share. The combination of Corus (18.18MT pa) and Tata (4.4MT pa) would create the fifth largest steelmaking company worldwide. Tata surprised the credit default swap segment of the derivative markets by deciding to raise $6.17 billion of debt for the deal through a new subsidiary of Corus called 'Tata Steel UK', rather than by raising the debt itself. Tata's security credit rating was investment grade, whereas the new subsidiary may not be. The higher risk associated with raising debt through a subsidiary with a lower credit rating prompted Fitch Ratings to downgrade its rating of the credit swap risks in the takeover to 'negative'. Fitch also stated that Corus' responsibility for the debt may lead to Corus' own unsecured debt rating being downgraded. This does not affect the rating of bonds issued by Corus which are secured debt.\n\nOn 19 November 2006, the Brazilian steel company Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional (CSN) launched a counter offer for Corus at a higher valuation of £4.75 per share. CSN and Corus had previously discussed a merger in 2002, cancelled late 2002; CSN's iron ore assets would provide synergy with Corus's need to import ore.\n\nSubsequently, Tata submitted an improved bid at £5.00 per share, followed by an improved bid from CSN at £5.15 per share which was accepted by the board of Corus on 11 December 2007. On 19 December 2006 the UK body, the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers announced a close date for bidding of 30 January 2007.\n\nOn 30/31 January an auction was held by the Panel for Corus's shares, with Tata outbidding CSN at £6.08 vs £6.03 per share. CSN's bid had been supported by Goldman Sachs whilst Tata's was supported by ABN Amro, Rothschilds, and Deutsche Bank.\n\nIn January 2009, Corus announced job cuts of 1,000 in the Netherlands and 2,500 in the UK due the economic downturn (see Great Recession) and consequent reduction of steel demand. Cuts included cessation (mothballing) of production at a hot strip mill in Llanwern, Wales (600 jobs), as well as major jobs losses (up to 700) at the engineering steel production site in Rotherham. Corus also closed down its defined benefit pension scheme to new members.\n\nIn late 2009 Corus announced the mothballing of the \"Teesside Cast Products\" plant (Teesside blast furnaces), following the unexpected cancellation of 10 year contracts with Marcegaglia (Italy) signed 2004. Corus's workforce was expected to be reduced by approximately 1,700 as a result; The plant had been identified as surplus to requirements in 2003, with Corus's own steel requirements to be supplied from Port Talbot and Scunthorpe, with Teesside Cast Products to seek external markets for its steel slab. Partial mothballing took place in early 2010. In mid 2010 the company reached preliminary agreement to sell the plant to Thai steel producer SSI. The plant was sold in February 2011 for £300 million.\n\nIn September 2010, Corus announced that it was changing its name to Tata Steel Europe and adopting the Tata logo.\n\nIn July 2012, Tata Steel were fined £500,000 over the 2006 death of worker Kevin Downey at their Port Talbot plant. Engulfed in steam and left disorientated during a night shift, Downey died after wandering into a channel of molten slag heated to 1,500 °C.\n\nOn 23 November 2012 Tata Steel Europe announced that, as a result of restructuring proposals, there would be a net loss of 900 jobs in the UK.\n\nBy late 2014 Tata Group remained £13 billion in debt, which had increased following the acquisition of Corus in 2007, due to reduced demand in Europe (see Financial crisis of 2007–08 and Great Recession). As a result, the company sought to reduce liabilities: the European long products division was offered in sale to Klesch Group. The long products division employed around 6,500, and was operating at about 60% of its 5 million ton pa capacity; the division included primary production at Scunthorpe steelworks; mills in Teesside (Teesside beam mill, Skinningrove and Darlington special profiles); France (Hayange rail mill); Scotland (Dalzell and Clydebridge), and other assets including the Immingham Bulk Terminal. In late 2014 estimates for the value of the property were about $1.4 billion. In August 2015 talks on the acquisition ended unsuccessfully, with Klesch citing energy prices and (dumping of) Chinese steel imports as factors against the sale.\n\nIn October 2015 the Dalzell and Clydebridge plants were announced to be mothballed, The mothballing in Scotland and further reductions at Scunthorpe (around 900 jobs) led to 1,200 redundancies in late 2015. In late 2015 Tata Steel UK reached a preliminary agreement with Greybull Capital for it to acquire Tata's European long products division, excluding the Dalzell and Clydebridge plants.\n\nIn early 2016 CEO Karl Koehler stood down to be replaced by CTO Hans Fischer.\n\nIn March 2016 \"The Sunday Post\" report that a preliminary agreement had been reached between Tata and Liberty House Group on the sale of the Dalzell and Clydesbridge plants.\n\nAt the end of March 2016 the Tata board rejected a turnaround plan for the Port Talbot site, and announced it would seek to sell all (or part) of its UK steel business. Its UK steel operations had lost £68 million in the three months to February 2016, from a profit the previous year despite rising demand – a primary factor in the loss was lowered steel prices due to global imports, with Russia, South Korea and particularly China cited as dumping steel. Other factors mitigating against profitability included high energy costs (including green taxes), high business rates and oversupply/low demand. In addition the UK government had voted against increased tariffs on imported Chinese steel due to its free trade policies, limiting import duties to minimal amounts (around 10%). – the \"Daily Telegraph\" reported that the UK Government's failure to back EU attempts to increase anti-dumping measure on imported steel had been the tipping point in Tata's decision to exit the UK steel business.\n\nThe sale of the Long Products division to Greybull Capital for a nominal £1 was agreed on 11 April 2016, with Greybull taking over assets and liabilities of the division. On completion of the sale Greybull was to rename the business \"British Steel\". At takeover the division employed approximately 5,000 persons, predominately in the UK. The sale was completed end of May 2016.\n\nTata set a deadline of 28 May 2016 for bids for its remaining UK business. Liberty House confirmed it was to bid for Tata's remaining UK assets, and a management backed buyout, named \"Excalibur UK\" also submitted a bid. In early May 2016 Tata stated it was considering offers from seven bidders for the whole UK business, taking forward only bids for the whole of the business. Other bidders were rumoured to be JSW Steel (India), Nucor (US), Hebei Iron & Steel Group (China), ThyssenKrupp (Germany), private equity fund Endless LLP (UK), and Greybull Capital. Wilbur Ross (USA) was also rumoured to be a late bidder for the assets.\n\nIn early July 2016 Tata paused the sale procedure in part to assess the effect of the vote to leave the EU (Brexit) in the UK EU membership referendum of 2016; on 8 July it announced it was in discussion with other steelmakers, specifically ThyssenKrupp on the formation of a joint venture between their respective European steel businesses. JSW Steel and Hebei Iron & Steel were also reported as potential joint venture partners. In addition to the talks on a joint venture the company was also stated to be in talks to sell the pipe (Hartlepool) and EAF/speciality steel (South Yorkshire) businesses separately.\n\nIn November 2016 Tata and Liberty House signed a letter of intent on the sale of Tata's speciality steel business (Rotherham, Stocksbridge, Brinsworth) for £100 million. This sale was completed in February 2017 to form Liberty Speciality Steels and included the Wednesbury bright bar division and Hartlepool tubes division.\n\nIn December 2016 Tata made commitments to: invest £1 billion over ten years into its British operations, and continue operating two blast furnaces at Port Talbot for at least 5 years; as well as promising to avoid compulsory redundancies in the next five years; at the same time an agreement was announced between unions and Tata leading to the closure of a defined benefit pension scheme.\n\nAt the beginning of 2016 Tata Steel Europe had three blast furnaces based steelmaking facilities; the long products division was sold in April 2016 including the Scunthorpe blast furnaces.\n\n\nIt also has rolling mills and steel product manufacturing sites situated at:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was noted for his many climbing achievements, including a solo climb of a new route on the south-west pillar of the Aiguille du Dru in August 1955, the first ascent of Gasherbrum IV in 1958 and in 1965 the first solo climb in winter of the North face of the Matterhorn on the mountain's centenary year of its first ascent. Immediately after his extraordinary solo climb on the Matterhorn Bonatti announced his retirement from professional climbing at the age of 35 and after 17 years of climbing activity. He authored many mountaineering books and spent the remainder of his career travelling off the beaten track as a reporter for the Italian magazine \"Epoca\".\nHe died on 13 September 2011 of pancreatic cancer in Rome aged 81, and was survived by his life partner, the actress Rossana Podestà.\n\nFamed for his climbing panache, he pioneered little known and technically difficult climbs in the Alps, Himalayas and Patagonia.\n\nBorn in a working-class family, his father was a fabric merchant, Bonatti took to gymnastics through a sport association in Monza. The physical strength and balance he developed here would prove to be crucial skills for Bonatti as a climber. At age 18, Bonatti started climbing on the Grigna, a rocky mountain of the Italian Prealps, where he spent the summer of 1948 climbing intensively.\n\nDuring 1949, within a year of starting to climb, he made the first repetition of the \"Oppio-Colnaghi-Guidi Route\", a challenging climb on the South Face of the Croz dell'Altissimo long and rated UIAA V+. Soon after followed the climb of the \"Bramani-Castiglioni Route\" on the North-West face of Piz Badile, a second repetition of the \"Ratti-Vitali route\" on the West Face of the Aiguille Noire de Peuterey, a rocky mountain in the Italian part of the Mont Blanc massif and the fourth ascent of the Walker Spur on the North Face of the Grandes Jorasses in only two days and with limited equipment. This last route had been climbed for the first time in 1938 by famous climber Riccardo Cassin and consists of of rock-climbing with UIAA difficulty of IV and V and one step of VI+. The climb of the Walker Spur by the \"Cassin route\" is exposed to stone-fall and ranks together with the North Face of the Eiger as one of the major climbs achieved in the Alps between the two world wars.\n\nBonatti had limited financial means and his first climbs were done with very basic equipment, including pitons that he had manufactured personally. During the first years Bonatti worked in a steel mill and climbed on Sunday directly after the Saturday night shift. In less than two years since he started climbing, Bonatti had already joined the restricted circle of the best Italian climbers.\n\nIn 1950 he tried what would have been his first major achievement: the first ascent of the east face of the Grand Capucin, an unclimbed face of red granite in the group of Mont Blanc, together with the climber Camillo Barzaghi. They climbed a few pitches before being forced back by a storm. Three weeks later, together with Luciano Ghigo another attempt was made. After three days of climbing and three hanging bivouacs they had reached the most difficult section of the climb, a vertical section of of smooth granite, but a storm again forced them to retreat.\n\nIn 1951 the same team tried again to climb the east face of the Grand Capucin. They started the climb on 20 July in good weather conditions. In two days they got close to the summit but again the weather worsened and they had to spend a day on the face in a hanging bivouac. The next day, despite bad weather conditions, they managed to successfully complete the climb and return safely to the hut. A few years later, in 1955 and after completing the climb himself, Hermann Buhl stated that it was the \"most difficult granite climb in an absolute sense\".\n\nIn 1952, Bonatti together with Roberto Bignami opened the first route on the south ridge of the Aiguille Noire de Peuterey.\n\nIn February 1953, together with Carlo Mauri he made the first winter ascent of the north face of the legendary Cima Ovest di Lavaredo. A few days later they made the first repetition of the winter ascent of the north face of Cima Grande, climbed already in 1938 by Fritz Kasparek. Before the end of the 1953 winter, with Roberto Bignami, and in only two days, Bonatti opened on Matterhorn a new direct variant on the \"Furggen Ridge\". In the summer of 1953 he achieved the first climb of Mont Blanc by the north gully from the Peuterey Col.\n\nIn 1954 Bonatti was assigned to the Alpine regiment and for four days each week he trained men to climb; for the other three he was allowed to head off into the mountains on his own. With all his achievements he had become an unavoidable selection for the Italian assault on K2, which would cause him a lot of trouble.\n\nBonatti was the youngest participant of the 1954 Italian expedition to K2 organised by Ardito Desio. As Bonatti said afterwards at the age of 80: \"It was the era when European countries picked off the 8,000m peaks in the same way they had colonies 100 years previously.\" On 31 July, two members of the Italian team Lino Lacedelli and Achille Compagnoni reached the summit, securing the first ascent of K2 for the Italian team. However, years after the expedition Bonatti found himself accused and at the center of a bitter controversy based on conflicting accounts of events which occurred during the ascent. Only 53 years later, did the Italian Alpine Club officially recognise that both Lacedelli and Compagnoni lied in their account of the ascent and that Bonatti's version of the facts was accurate.\n\nAlong with Hunza climber Amir Mehdi, Bonatti had the task to carry oxygen cylinders up to Lacedelli and Compagnoni at Camp IX for a summit attempt.\nHowever, Compagnoni had decided to place Camp IX at a higher location than previously agreed with Bonatti. Bonatti and Mehdi reached a point close to Camp IX but by this time night had fallen and Mehdi's condition had deteriorated. Bonatti knew that he and Mehdi needed the shelter of a tent to survive a night at this altitude without risk of frostbite or worse, but the Camp IX tent was placed at the end of a dangerous traverse across icy slopes and visibility was too reduced to get there. Bonatti saw that Mehdi was in no condition to climb further or make a return to Camp VIII and was reluctantly forced to endure an open bivouac without tent or sleeping bag at and . This cost Mehdi his toes, while Bonatti was lucky to survive the terrible night unharmed.\nCompagnoni gave the explanation that his decision to change the agreed site of the camp was to avoid an overhanging serac, but Bonatti accused both (and the facts would later give him reason) to have deliberately changed the location to make it impossible for Bonatti and Mehdi to remain overnight at that height, so there would be no way they too could attempt the summit themselves.\nBonatti was in the best physical condition of all the climbers and the natural choice to make the summit attempt, but Ardito Desio selected Lacedelli and Compagnoni. Had Bonatti joined the summit team he would likely not have used supplemental oxygen. Therefore, Lacedelli and Compagnoni's oxygen-assisted climb could have been eclipsed. Although the Bonatti-Mehdi forced bivouac was not anticipated, Compagnoni intended to discourage Bonatti from reaching the tent and participating in the final summit climb. In the morning of 31 July, after Bonatti and Mehdi had already begun their descent to the safety of Camp VIII, Compagnoni and Lacedelli retrieved the oxygen cylinders left at the bivouac site and reached the summit of K2 at 6.10pm. Ardito Desio, in his final report, mentioned the forced bivouac only in passing. Mehdi's frostbite was an embarrassment to the expedition. The Italian government provided Mehdi with a small pension for his contribution and sacrifice on the first ascent of K2. This is disputed by Mehdi's son.\n\nBonatti was later accused by Compagnoni of using some of the oxygen to survive his bivouac, causing the climbers to run out of oxygen earlier than expected on the summit day. Bonatti immediately claimed that he could not use this supplemental oxygen because both the mask and the regulator were at the Camp IX. Bonatti brought evidence supporting his response that Compagnoni had lied about running out of oxygen en route to the summit. Although Bonatti's version of facts was supported by Lacedelli in \"K2: The Price of Conquest\" (2004), Lacedelli contended that the oxygen had in fact run out. However, he attributed this not to Bonatti's alleged use of the oxygen, but to the physical exertion of the climb causing the use of more oxygen than expected.\n\nFor a long time Bonatti was accused and vilified by a part of the climbing community but over time the growing amount of evidence in support of his version of the facts proved his honesty. Reinhold Messner, in June 2010, said: \"Bonatti was one of the greatest climbers of all time – the last true Alpinist, an expert in all disciplines. But more importantly Walter was a marvellous, tolerant, loving person. He leaves a great spiritual testament: he was a clean man vilified for 50 years over what happened on K2, but in the end everyone accepted that he was right.\"\n\nIn 2007 the Italian Alpine Club published with the name of \"K2 – Una storia finita\", a revised official account that accepted Bonatti's version of events as completely accurate.\n\nBonatti tried to organise a solo ascent of K2 without oxygen the following year to put the record straight but couldn't get the backing, so he retreated to Courmayeur, where he became a mountain guide in 1954.\n\nMany years later, Bonatti would write:\n\nIn the August 1955, after two attempts frustrated by the weather, he managed to solo climb a new route on the south-west pillar of the Aiguille du Dru in the Mont Blanc Group. The climb, rated ED+ with difficulties up to UIAA VIII-, required six days (and five hanging bivouacs) and still today is considered a masterpiece of climbing.\n\nAfter five days of climbing on a vertical rock offering very limited protection, Bonatti found himself stalled and faced with an impassable overhanging section. On the left and on the right the rock was absolutely smooth. Bonatti put together all the slings and small sections of ropes he had on him, attached one end of the rope in a crack and swinging on the other end managed to negotiate the difficulty. This route, known afterwards as the Bonatti Pillar, is considered still today as one of the greatest achievements in alpinism. In order to overcome long vertical sections and several overhangs, Bonatti had to adapt the techniques of aid climbing to the granitic rock formations of the Dru.\n\nIn 2005 a massive landslide completely destroyed the Bonatti Pillar route.\n\nIn December 1956, together with his partner Silvano Gheser, Bonatti attempted a winter ascent of the \"Pear Route \" on the Brenva side of Monte Blanc. During the approach they met two climbers, the French Jean Vincendon and the Belgian François Henry, en route to the nearby Brenva Spur, a climb of medium difficulty. Both parties started their respective climbs at 4am on Christmas Day in clear sunny conditions. After a few hours, ice conditions on Bonatti's climb deteriorated dangerously and he and Gheser were forced to seek a safe exit up the Brenva Spur where Jean Vincendon and François Henry were climbing. The two parties continued the climb on different, but parallel, lines. Close to the end of the climb at 4pm, Bonatti's party was around higher. In the meantime with the approach of darkness a strong storm began. The two parties were forced to make an unplanned bivouac at , but could not keep up a vocal and visual link.\n\nBonatti managed to pass the night unharmed but his companion Gheser started to suffer from frostbite to one foot. On 26 December Bonatti and Gheser descended lower to join the other party. The four climbers continued the climb together and arrived on the Brenva Col. From there two options were possible: descend directly to Chamonix crossing a section of unstable and avalanche-prone snow, or climb to the summit of Mont Blanc and descend the normal route to find shelter in the Vallot Hut. Bonatti decided to take the second option, the safest but also the longest and more painful because it required the four men to gain of elevation in a winter storm. Bonatti pushed the men to climb as fast as possible because he realised time was limited; Gheser's feet and hands were suffering from severe frostbite (later in the valley he would have some fingers amputated). They arrived at the Vallot Hut when night had already fallen.\nIn the meantime Vincendon's party decided, from the summit of Mont Blanc, to turn back and head directly to Chamonix, but the arrival of darkness forced them to spend the night in a crevasse at . Bonatti and Gheser left the Vallot Hut on 27 December, descended the Italian side of Mont Blanc and arrived at the Gonella Hut, where on 30 December a team of alpine guides arrived to rescue them.\n\nVincendon and Henry, in the meantime were totally exhausted and frostbitten and waited in the crevasse to be rescued, but the bad weather prevented a successful operation. Multiple attempts to save the climbers were made (including a helicopter sent to rescue the party but crashing on the glacier). All proved useless. Both climbers died of cold after 10 days exposure. Their bodies were recovered in March 1957. The events that marked this tragedy triggered changes in mountain rescue techniques and procedures in France.\n\nIn 1957 Bonatti relocated to Courmayeur. After a long period spent recovering from his Brenva Spur climb, Bonatti turned his attention to the last big virgin face in the Mont Blanc Group: the north face of the Grand Pilier d'Angle.\nThree new routes were opened on the Grand Pilier d'Angle between 1957 and 1963: on the north-east face with Toni Gobbi (1–3 August 1957), on the north face (22–23 June 1962) with the Cosimo Zappelli and again with Zappelli on the south-east face (11–12 October 1963). All these rountes have an alpine difficulty around ED and are UIAA rated V/VI.\n\nBonatti declared after the first ascent of the north-east face of the Grand Pilier d'Angle, that \"The mixed terrain of the face was without doubt the most sombre, the most savage and the most dangerous of any that I have ever encountered in the Alps.\".\n\nOn 9 March 1961 Bonatti climbed together with Gigi Panei and made the first winter ascent of the \"Via della Sentinella Rossa\", a classic route on the Brenva side of Mont Blanc in a record time of 11 hours from the bivouac of \"La Fourche\".\n\nIn January 1958 Bonatti was in Patagonia, (Argentina), to participate to a mixed Italian-Argentinian expedition in the glaciated mountains of the Southern Patagonian Ice Field. The objective was to climb with Carlo Mauri the unclimbed Cerro Torre (). The climb started from the west side of the mountain 2 February in conditions of fair weather, but the route would prove to be difficult and the climbing equipment (ropes and pitons) insufficient.\nVery likely, the climb itself was above the skills of the best climbers of those years. Indeed, the first undisputed and fair climb of Cerro Torre would be achieved only in 1974 by another Italian expedition, after many unsuccessful attempts from other climbers.\n\nDuring the same expedition, along with Argentines René Eggmann and Folco Doro Altán, they ascended on 4 February the unclimbed Cerro Mariano Moreno and on 7 February the also unclimbed Cerro Adela. In the following days they concatenated the mountains Cerro Doblado, Cerro Grande and Cerro Luca (this last one climbed for the first time). Cerro Luca, in the Group of Cerro Grande will be named by the two climbers with the name of Mauri's son. The traverse of the three mountain is currently known as \"Travesía del Cordón Adela\" (Cerro Adela traverse). This impressive traverse took place only two days after the first ascent of Cerro Mariano Moreno.\n\nIn 1958 Bonatti joined an Italian expedition, led by Riccardo Cassin, to the Karakoram mountains of Pakistan. The intention was to climb the previously unconquered Gasherbrum IV (, the 17th highest mountain on Earth and the 6th highest in Pakistan). On 6 August together with Carlo Mauri, Bonatti summitted after an alpine style ascent by the north-east ridge. The route climbed by Bonatti and Mauri has since been successfully climbed only a few times.\n\nIn May 1961, Walter Bonatti and Andrea Oggioni climb Nevado Ninashanca () and achieved the first ascent of Rondoy Norte (), a remote peak of the Cordillera Huayhuash. This peak was climbed by the west face, a very serious and difficult climb rated ED+; it has recorded very few ascents since.\n\nIn the summer of 1961 Walter Bonatti, Andrea Oggioni and Roberto Gallieni decided to climb the Central Pillar of Frêney, an unclimbed peak of the Mont Blanc Group. During the approach at the Bivouac of La Fourche they met a French team composed of Pierre Mazeaud, Pierre Kohlmann, Robert Guillaume and Antoine Vieille. The two teams decided to make the ambitious climb together.\nA snow storm, lasting more than one week, blocked the two parties only from the summit of the pillar. In the meantime, two alpine guides (Gigi Panei and Alberto Tassotti) alerted by the fact that Bonatti had not yet returned to Courmayeur, moved to the Bivouac of La Fourche and realised, reading a note left by Bonatti in the hut book, the scope of the climb of the two teams. Meanwhile, Bonatti and the others were in a stalled situation; they had not moved for the previous three days. Finally they decided to descend but only three climbers (Bonatti, Gallieni and Mazeaud) managed to return safely. The other four died of exhaustion or accident, while trying to find a way out through the fresh snow. Vieille died at the Rochers Gruber (a technical section of the climb) and Guillaume fell into a crevasse of the Freney Glacier. Andrea Oggioni died in the Innominata Gully, less than one hour of descent from the hut. Pierre Kohlmann died only 10 minutes walk from the hut.\nIn 2002, French President Jacques Chirac awarded Bonatti the National Order of the Legion of Honor for the courage, determination and altruism he demonstrated trying to save his fellow climbers.\n\nThe Central Pillar of Frêney remained unclimbed only for a few days. On 29 August 1961 Chris Bonington, Ian Clough, Don Whillans and Jan Długosz were the first to solve what was called the \"Last Great Problem of the Alps’.\n\nIn four days of climb, between the 6 and 10 August 1964, Bonatti climbed for the first time the Pointe Whymper (one of the six summits of the Grandes Jorasses) together with Michel Vaucher. The climb (known today as the \"Bonatti-Vaucher route\") is still considered very technical and difficult. It is classified as ED alpine grade and consists of of rock-climbing rated UIAA VI, several sections of mixed ground quoted M6 (vertical to overhanging with difficult dry tooling) and with some pitches of A2 aid climbing. This difficult climb would be repeated in winter in 1976 by Pierre Béghin and Xavier Fargeas. In 1977 Pierre Béghin would solo the route in winter.\n\nIn February 1965, Bonatti tried with two companions to climb a new, direct route on Matterhorn \"Nordwand\" (north face) but the team was turned around by storm. Back in the valley his two friends had to leave. He considered his options then set off on 18 February 1965 for a second attempt alone. Five days later he emerged on the summit, having completed a demanding climb of 1.200 metres rated ED+. This climb has been since rarely repeated solo and in winter, the three most notable repetitions being perhaps:\n\nShortly after the climb, Walter Bonatti announced his retirement from professional climbing at the age of 35 and after only 17 years of climbing activity.\n\nBonatti worked for more than 20 years as a reporter for the weekly Italian magazine \"Epoca\", travelling off the beaten track. Here are the most notable places he visited:\n\n\nMost of these adventure are described in his book \"In terre lontane\".\n\nIn 1980 Bonatti met the former actress Rossana Podestà in Rome and they soon relocated to Dubino, a small town in the Alps.\n\nBonatti, aged 81, died alone at a private clinic where the hospital management would not allow his partner of more than 30 years spend the last minutes of his life together because the two were not married. His funeral took place in Lecco on 18 September 2011, where he was cremated and the ashes interred in the cemetery of Porto Venere.\n\nWalter Bonatti called his climbing philosophy \"The pursuit with the extremely hard\". He pulled off a fantastic number of audacious ascents plus more remarkably survived some horrific climbs that killed some of his associates. The underlying idea of his approach was to accept to climb the mountain hard as it is, with fair means and in the simplest and most aesthetic way possible. In an interview left to John Crace of The Guardian on 30 June 2010 he said: \"Modern equipment is so technically advanced you can climb anything if you put your mind to it. The impossible has been removed from the equation.\"\n\nHe was always fiercely opposed to the use of expansion bolts. Reinhold Messner shared Bonatti's approach and stated in the book \"The Murder of the Impossible\" that \"Expansion bolts contribute to the decline of alpinism\".\n\nIn his book \"The Mountains of My Life\" Walter Bonatti writes:\n\n\n\nThe life of Walter Bonatti has inspired entire generations of climbers, in Italy and worldwide.\n\nA hut in the Val Ferret, at near the village of La Vachey, in the municipality of Courmayeur is dedicated to Bonatti.\n\nIn 2009 Bonatti was awarded the Piolet d'Or for his lifetime achievement. After his death, the Piolet d'Or prize for lifetime achievement was renamed \"Piolet d'Or for lifetime achievement, Walter Bonatti prize\".\n\nBritish climber Doug Scott wrote in his 1974 book \"Big Walls\" that Bonatti was \"perhaps the finest alpinist there has ever been\", while in 2010 Reinhold Messner described him as \"one of the greatest climbers of all time and a marvellous person.\"\n\nThe legendary Chris Bonington said about Bonatti: \"He was a complex person and a sensitive one too. K2 always preyed on his mind. But he was also a man of great integrity. And a great gentleman.\"\n\nFrench alpinist Pierre Mazeaud declared: \"Il y a de la spiritualité chez cet être-là. Pour moi, Walter est sans doute un héros de légende mais c’est avant tout un homme de vérité qui a tout simplement du cœur (There is spirituality in that person. For me, Walter is undoubtedly a legendary hero but it is above all a man of truth who has a big heart).\"\n\nGaston Rebuffat would speak of Bonatti in the following terms: \"Un homme doté d'un idéal mais également doté des précieuses qualités humaines qui permettent de réellement mettre un idéal en pratique. (A man with ideals, but also with the precious human qualities making possible ideals to become real)\".\n\nIn May 2012 the first movie on the life of Bonatti: \"Con i muscoli, con il cuore, con la testa\", was produced by Road Television. The production of the movie started before Bonatti's death and modified slightly afterwards.\n\nListed are some of the most significant climbs of Water Bonatti.\n\n\nRoutes soloed\n\nWalter Bonatti was a prolific writer.

She was born near Cobh, County Cork, but shortly moved with the family to nearby Youghal, County Cork. Mary had three siblings who lived into adulthood: Robert, Bent (1806-1860), and Anne, a well-known algologist. The family was Protestant and \"involved in trade\".\n\nThere is not much known about Mary's training, but as a middle-class family she certainly would have access to a microscope and the latest volumes of natural history and scientific classification of the times. It has been recorded that Robert started collecting specimens with his father at the age of five. It can be assumed that Mary would have participated as well. Robert encouraged Mary in her early insect studies, purchasing for her a copy of James Stephens' \"Systematic Catalogue of British insects\", published in 1829. In this she detailed the insects in her growing collection.\n\nIn 1833 Mary began a correspondence with the Belfast naturalist William Thompson. Her insect collection became large for the time and was very well known. Thompson named about twenty species of molluscs and crustaceans in her honour, including a small spiral snail \"Rissoa balliae\" in 1856.\n\nMary concentrated on collecting shells and insects, accumulating what was considered one of the best collections of molluscs in the country at the time, though it was disposed after her death. One of her most interesting finds was a specimen of the migratory locust figured in John Curtis's \"British Entomology\" - Folio 608 \"Locusta christii\" dated 1 August 1836. \"In the cabinets of Miss Ball and the author\" - \"Another specimen, captured last September at Ardmore in the county of Waterford by Miss M. Ball has been kindly transmitted to me for my inspection by Mr Robert Ball of Dublin. It is of the same sex as the one figured but the elytra are much more spotted\".\n\nMary Ball's Odonata were studied by the Belgian entomologist Michel Edmond de Selys-Longchamps on his visit to Dublin.\n\nHer entomology collections are now housed in the Natural History Museum in Dublin, and the Zoology Museum in Trinity College, Dublin.\n\nAfter the successive deaths of her father in 1841, her mentor William Thompson in 1852 and her brother Robert in 1857, Mary seems to have given up entomology and taken to fern gardening. A success too: \"If Aunt Mary had planted a parasol it would have grown into an umbrella\", one of her nephews remarked. She spent her last years living with her sister Anne in Dublin. She died there in 1898 at the age of eighty-six.\n\nMary, as was the convention, did not publish her work under her own name. The three known works were all communicated by her brother Robert. They are:\n\n\nHer observations of butterflies and moths were cited by the \"father of Irish entomology\" Alexander Henry Haliday in his work on the Irish Lepidoptera.\n\n"}

He was professor of history at the University of East London at the time of his death and also taught at Ruskin College from 1962 until his death.\n\nSamuel was born into a Jewish family in London. His father, Barnett Samuel, was a solicitor and his mother, Minna Nerenstein, was a composer and partner in Jewish publishers Shapiro, Valentine. Samuel joined the Communist Party of Great Britain when a teenager and left following the Soviet Union's invasion of Hungary in 1956.\n\nSamuel was awarded a scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford where he became a member of the Communist Party Historians Group, alongside Christopher Hill, E. P. Thompson and others. He co-founded the journal \"Past and Present\" in 1952, and pioneered the study of working-class history. He founded the Partisan Coffee House in 1956 in Soho, London, as a meeting place for the British New Left.\n\nHe founded the History Workshop movement at trade union connected Ruskin College, Oxford. Samuel and the History Workshop movement powerfully influenced the development of the approach to historical research and writing commonly called \"history from below\".\n\nIn 1987 Samuel married the writer and critic Alison Light. Samuel's archive is held at Bishopsgate Library.\n\nAfter Samuel's death in 1996, the East London History Centre of the University of East London was renamed the Raphael Samuel History Centre, in honour of his role in creating it. The Centre was established to investigate and document the history of London since the eighteenth century. Consistent with Samuel's belief that historical studies should extend outside the academy, the Centre encourages research in the community, and the publication of materials ranging from monographs by established scholars to student dissertations and \"Notes and Queries\" features in the local press. Since September 2009 the Raphael Samuel Centre has been a partnership between the University of East London, Birkbeck College and the Bishopsgate Institute.\n\nIn an obituary in the journal \"Radical Philosophy\", Carolyn Steedman describes Samuel's work:Like Raymond Williams and Edward Thompson, he produced his historical work in interaction with working-class adult returners to education... The standard charge against the history Samuel inspired was of a fanatical empiricism and a romantic merging of historians and their subjects in crowded narratives, in which each hard-won detail of working lives, wrenched from the cold indifference of posterity, is piled upon another, in a relentless rescue of the past. When he was himself subject to these charges, it was presumably his fine – and immensely detailed – accounts of the labour process that critics had in mind. But it was meaning rather than minutiae that he cared about.\n\nRaphael Samuel was interred at Highgate Cemetery.\n\n\n\n"}

As a young princess, her grandmother, Queen Sisowath Kossamak, chose her to become a dancer early in her life. At the age of 15, she became the premier dancer of the Royal Ballet of Cambodia. At the age of 18, she was granted the title of \"prima ballerina\".\n\nShe then toured the world as the principal dancer of the Royal Ballet with Queen Kossamak, performing in public. In the past the ballet had been performed only before royalty to commemorate their dynastic ancestors and to honour the gods. For her dancing ability, her father Norodom Sihanouk cast her in his first feature-length film \"Apsara\" in 1966.\n\nBuppha Devi served as Deputy Minister of Culture and Fine Arts from 1991–1993, she was advisor to the Royal Government in charge of Culture and Fine Arts from 1993–1998, she was Vice President of the Cambodian Red Cross from 1993–1997, she was President of the Cambodian-Chinese Association in the year 2000, and served in Prime Minister Hun Sen's cabinet as the Minister of Culture and Fine Arts from 1998–2004.\n\nBuppha Devi married her first husband in 1959 at the age of fifteen. Her four total marriages produced five children:\n1) Norodom Norinractevong\n2) Sisowath Monichivann\n3) Bruno Jacques Forsinetti \n4) Sisowath Chivanmonirak\n\n"}

She was a champion of the controversial 'cyclol' hypothesis for the structure of proteins.\n\nDorothy Wrinch was born in Rosario, Argentina, the daughter of Hugh Edward Hart Wrinch, an engineer, and Ada Souter. The family returned to England and Dorothy grew up in Surbiton, near London. She attended Surbiton High School and in 1913 entered Girton College, Cambridge to read mathematics. Wrinch often attended meetings of the Heretics Club run by CK Ogden, and it was through a 1914 lecture organised by Ogden that she first heard Bertrand Russell speak. She graduated in 1916 as a wrangler.\n\nFor the academic year 1916–1917, Wrinch took the Cambridge Moral Sciences tripos and studied mathematical logic with Russell in London. In December she was invited to Garsington Manor, the home of Russell's then mistress Ottoline Morell, and there encountered Clive Bell and other Bloomsbury Group members, and in 1917 she introduced Russell to Dora Black who would later become his second wife. From 1917 Wrinch was funded by Girton College as a research student, officially supervised by G.H. Hardy in Cambridge but in practice by Russell in London. When, in May 1918, Russell was imprisoned for his anti-war activities, Wrinch assisted with his writing projects by bringing him books and articles. Wrinch also secured the first publication of Ludwig Wittgenstein's (not yet so named) \"Tractatus\" in a German philosophical journal in 1921.\n\nIn London Wrinch attended the Aristotelian Society, including a debate between D'Arcy Thompson and John Scott Haldane on the nature of physics, biology and psychology, and she became a friend of Thompson. Wrinch spoke to the Society herself on the 'summation of pleasures, and through the Society she encountered Harold Jeffreys and Raphael Demos. In the autumn of 1918 Wrinch registered for graduate study on asymptotic expansions with the applied mathematician John Nicholson at King's College London, started to teach at University College, and continued to work with Jeffreys on the philosophy of scientific method. She moved into a flat in Mecklenburgh Square owned by Russell's then mistress Colette O'Neil. In 1920 Girton awarded Wrinch a four-year Yarrow Research Fellowship with the freedom to work on any area of her choice. In 1920 she was awarded an MSc and in 1921 a DSc by the University of London. Wrinch moved to Oxford in 1922 upon her marriage, where she had a succession of temporary jobs for the next 16 years. She was Lady Carlisle Research Fellow at Somerville College, Oxford and first female Lecturer in Mathematics at the University. in 1929 she was the first woman to receive an Oxford DSc.\n\nWrinch's first paper was a 1917 defence of Russell's philosophy, and between 1918 and 1932 she published 20 papers on pure and applied mathematics and 16 on scientific methodology and on the philosophy of science. At the 1928 International Congress of Mathematics in Bologna she delivered the paper \"On a method for constructing harmonics for surfaces of revolution.\" She also presented on \"Harmonics Associated with Certain Inverted Spheroids\" at the 1932 ICM in Zürich.\" The papers she wrote with Harold Jeffreys on scientific method formed the basis of his 1931 book \"Scientific Inference\". In the \"Nature\" obituary Jeffreys wrote, \"I should like to put on record my appreciation of the substantial contribution she made to [our joint] work, which is the basis of all my later work on scientific inference.\"\n\nFrom about 1932 Wrinch shifted towards theoretical biology. She was one of founders of the Biotheoretical Gathering (aka the 'Theoretical Biology Club'), an inter-disciplinary group that sought to explain life by discovering how proteins work. Also involved were Joseph Henry Woodger, Joseph and Dorothy Needham, C. H. Waddington, J. D. Bernal, Karl Popper and Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin. From then on Wrinch could be described as a theoretical biologist. She developed a model of protein structure, which she called the \"cyclol\" structure. The model generated considerable controversy and was attacked by the chemist Linus Pauling. In these debates Wrinch's lack of training in chemistry was a great weakness. By 1939, evidence had accumulated that the model was wrong but Wrinch continued working on it. However, experimental work by Irving Langmuir done in collaboration with Wrinch to validate her ideas catalysed the principle of the Hydrophobic effect being the driving force for protein folding.\n\nIn 1939 Wrinch moved to the United States. She had a variety of teaching positions at three small Massachusetts colleges, Amherst College, Smith College, and Mount Holyoke College. From 1942 until she retired in 1971 Wrinch held research positions at Smith.\n\nPrior to 1918 Wrinch's Cambridge tutor GN Watson had proposed to her but the feeling was not mutual and she had to ask her father to explain this to Watson; nevertheless Watson later recommended Wrinch as his replacement lecturer at University College London. Around the postwar time of her intellectual closeness to Russell, Wrinch may have had a romantic connection with his brother Frank and probably did have an unhappy attachment with another of his disciples, Raphael Demos. Sources differ on whether Wrinch wanted a romantic relationship with Russell. She was for some years a close intellectual companion of Harold Jeffreys, and some contemporary observers thought them engaged. It may have been the breaking of their engagement that encouraged Jeffreys to enter psychoanalysis, which was at the time fashionable in Cambridge.\n\nIn 1922 Wrinch married her graduate supervisor at King's College London, the mathematical physicist John William Nicholson. The examination for her DSc in 1921 had, unusually, an additional referee, which may have been because of perceptions of a relationship between the two of them. Nicholson was a graduate of Owens College Manchester and also a Cambridge Wrangler. In 1921 he was elected into a Fellowship at Balliol College, Oxford. The couple had one child, Pamela, born in 1927. Wrinch's book on parenthood, dedicated to Russell, was a venture into sociology rather than a manual of child-care. Nicholson's mental health deteriorated in the late 1920s, and in 1930 he was certified as mentally ill and confined in the Warneford Hospital until his death in 1955. In 1937 Wrinch was granted a divorce on grounds of her husband's insanity. From 1930 Wrinch was close emotionally and intellectually to the mathematician Eric Neville in a friendship which lasted until 1961.\n\nIn 1939 Wrinch and her daughter moved to the United States, partly because the chancellor of Oxford University and Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax advised her she would be most useful to the war effort by research and lecturing there. In 1941 she married Otto Charles Glaser, chairman of the biology department and vice-president of Amherst College, and it was in part through him that she was able to obtain teaching positions. In 1944 Glaser was forced to resign as chairman because he had allowed his research assistant to spend time working for Wrinch. Glaser retired in 1948 and died in 1951.\n\nDorothy Wrinch died in Falmouth, Massachusetts on 11 February 1976.\n\nCrowfoot Hodgkin wrote in Wrinch's obituary that she was \"a brilliant and controversial figure who played a part in the beginnings of much of present research in molecular biology.\" On a more personal level, Crowfoot Hodgkin wrote, \"I like to think of her as she was when I first knew her, gay, enthusiastic and adventurous, courageous in face of much misfortune and very kind.\"\n\n\n\n"}

It was released in 1986 by Verve Records and is composed of material recorded between 1967 and 1969.\n\nWhen the Velvet Underground moved from Verve Records (who had released their first two albums) to parent company MGM Records, they signed a two-album deal, releasing their third and eponymous album \"The Velvet Underground\" in March 1969. Later that same year, however, there was a management change and MGM Records' new CEO, Mike Curb, was brought in to try to rescue the financially struggling label. He decided to purge the record company of its many controversial and unprofitable acts. The Velvet Underground quickly became one of the groups blacklisted and were released from their contract. The band had, however, in the meantime recorded fourteen tracks for possible release as their second MGM album. All of these were shelved and forgotten by their record company until the early 1980s.\n\nAs Verve (by then an imprint of Polygram) prepared to re-release the band's three Verve/MGM albums on vinyl and, for the first time, on CD, they found nineteen previously unreleased tracks: five Cale-era tracks and the fourteen \"lost album\" tracks, some of them in two-track mixdown format, some of them even on multitracks. The cream of the nineteen tracks was released in February 1985 on \"VU\"; the rest remained for the time being in the vaults.\n\nIn 1986, Polydor decided to prepare a vinyl box set for European release. Simply titled \"The Velvet Underground\", this box, which was released in June, consisted of the band's first three albums, \"VU\", and an untitled bonus album containing the remaining nine tracks from Polygram's vaults. That untitled album was later separately released on vinyl and CD as \"Another View\".\n\nAn acetate-sourced alternative mix of this album's version of \"Ride into the Sun\", featuring vocals by Lou Reed, has appeared on bootlegs and on the Australian box set \"What Goes On\".\n\nAs the Velvet Underground moved from MGM to Atlantic, they re-recorded two of the songs on \"Another View\", \"Ride into the Sun\" and \"Rock and Roll\", for possible inclusion on \"Loaded\". Only \"Rock and Roll\" made the grade, but two of the \"Another View\" songs would be recycled by Lou Reed during his early solo career: \"Ride into the Sun\" (on \"Lou Reed\", 1972) and \"We're Gonna Have a Real Good Time Together\" (on \"Street Hassle\", 1978).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2211626", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2211626", "title": "Friant Dam", "text": "Friant Dam\n\nFriant Dam is a concrete gravity dam on the San Joaquin River in central California in the United States, on the boundary of Fresno and Madera Counties. It was built between 1937 and 1942 as part of a U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) water project to provide irrigation water to the southern San Joaquin Valley. The dam impounds Millerton Lake, a reservoir about north of Fresno.\n\nThe valley in which Friant Dam and Millerton Lake now lie was once the location of the historic town of Millerton. Millerton was the first county seat of Fresno County. In 1880, the first dam on the San Joaquin River was constructed by the Upper San Joaquin Irrigation Company roughly on the present site of Friant Dam. Built of local rock, the dam was an long, tall structure designed to divert water for the irrigation of . The project was abandoned in the wake of floods that destroyed the dam two years later.\n\nFriant Dam was originally proposed in the 1930s as a main feature of the Central Valley Project (CVP), a federal water project that would involve building an expansive system of dams and canals on the rivers of the Central Valley to provide water for agriculture, with secondary purposes of flood control, municipal supply, and hydroelectric power generation. The CVP was authorized by the 1935 Rivers and Harbors Act, while $20 million of initial funding for Friant Dam was provided by the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935.\n\nInitial surveys of the Friant Dam site were carried out in November 1935 and continued through early 1936. In January 1938, a worker's camp was established near the town of Friant to house the laborers that would ultimately work on the dam. In the middle of the Great Depression, the Friant Dam site saw a huge influx of job seekers, many of whom had to live further away in surrounding cities. More than 50,000 people attended the groundbreaking of the dam on November 5, 1939 in a celebration that is now known as \"one of the greatest in San Joaquin Valley history\".\n\nConstruction of Friant Dam began with blasting and excavation of the dam site to remove more than of loose material above the bedrock. Before any concrete was laid on the dam's main wall, the underlying rock was extensively grouted to fill in 725 holes and seams that might otherwise cause instability in the foundation. The concrete used in the dam's construction was made from sand and gravel excavated from the San Joaquin River floodplain about below the dam. Notably, more than of placer gold – worth $176,000 at the time – were uncovered in the excavation site. A branch line of the Southern Pacific Railroad delivered this material to a concrete mixing plant, which could produce up to of concrete per hour, directly adjacent to the construction site. In July 1940, the San Joaquin River was diverted through a wooden flume so that work on the foundations could begin.\n\nOn July 29, the first concrete was poured into the main body of Friant Dam. In order to keep the structure in line, the dam was built in a series of blocks or forms, each measuring square. Concrete was placed via a massive steel trestle system high and long, along which ran small powered railcars that delivered buckets of concrete from the mixing plant. Two gantry cranes lifted the buckets from the cars and poured them onto the forms. In summer 1941, the labor force reached a peak of 1,500, and the monthly record for concrete placement, at , was set in August. \n\nDuring the dam's construction several Native American burial sites had their graves removed and re-interned.\n\nThe workforce scrambled to complete the main wall of the dam after an act of the War Production Board (WPB) suspended resources in order to assist U.S. military efforts in World War II. The dam was topped out on June 16, 1942, just under two years after the first concrete was poured. However, the spillway gates, the water release valves and the two irrigation canals Friant was intended to support remained unfinished in the wake of the WPB's order.\n\nThe war, however, did not completely halt construction. Less than a year later, the WPB \"[determined] the completion of the Madera Canal and the installation of valves at the Friant Dam, necessary for war-time food and fiber production\" – allowing construction to resume on a limited scale. A pair of control valves were borrowed from Hoover Dam, allowing the closure of the river outlets and Millerton Lake began to fill on February 21, 1944. Work on the Madera Canal, the smaller of the two irrigation canals serviced by Friant Dam (the other, the Friant-Kern Canal, would not be completed for another four years), was completed in 1945 and water ran for its entire length for the first time on June 10, with irrigation deliveries commencing one month later.\n\nThe dam was formally dedicated on July 9, 1949 by California governor Earl Warren, who declared that the water furnished by Friant Dam and its canals would help the San Joaquin Valley to \"become a modern Eden\" as water was released into the partially completed Friant-Kern Canal for the first time. More than three thousand people, mostly residents of the San Joaquin Valley, attended the ceremonies.\n\nFriant Dam's primary purpose is to capture the fluctuating flows of the San Joaquin River and divert the water for irrigation through the Friant-Kern and Madera Canals. The Friant-Kern Canal is long, extending south from the dam to the Kern River near Bakersfield, and has an initial diversion capacity of ; the Madera Canal, which has a capacity of up to , travels north from the dam to the Chowchilla River. Together, these canals provide irrigation water to some of the San Joaquin Valley. In 1990, farmers who received their water from Friant Dam produced more than $1.9 billion worth of 90 different kinds of crops.\n\nMillerton Lake has a capacity of at normal maximum pool, with a surcharge (above spillway gates, but below the dam crest) capacity of approximately for a total capacity of . About , or 32.7% of the reservoir's regular capacity, is reserved for flood control between October and January to protect against rain floods, while between February and July, this is increased to – 75.0% – to provide space for snowmelt floods. The dam is operated to maintain a flow of or less on the San Joaquin River at Mendota, downriver. However, large snowmelt floods often exceed the capacity of the dam and reservoir and force larger releases downstream, potentially causing damage to riverside property and infrastructure.\n\nThe dam is also used to generate up to 25 megawatts (MW) of hydroelectric power. The penstock releasing water into the Friant-Kern Canal is fitted with a Kaplan turbine with a capacity of 15 MW, and the Madera Canal penstock is equipped with a smaller 8 MW turbine. The smallest hydroelectric generator, with a capacity of 2 MW, is located at the outlet works on the base of the dam and produces power from water releases that serve local farms along the San Joaquin River directly downstream from Friant Dam, as well as releases to a fish hatchery below the dam and for wildlife management purposes.\n\nBecause of its relatively small storage capacity relative to the average annual discharge of the San Joaquin River – versus – Friant Dam often has to release excessive amounts of water that could be otherwise used for irrigation or power generation, also causing downstream damage. From 1981 to 2011, an average of was spilled each year because the reservoir was unable to contain it. The USBR has proposed increasing the height of Friant Dam by up to , nearly tripling the reservoir's storage capacity to . A smaller raise would increase storage capacity to , while a raise would increase storage capacity to . The increase in height would also allow for the generation of between 4.7–30.4 MW of additional power.\n\nAnother proposal to increase storage in the upper San Joaquin River basin is Temperance Flat Dam, which would be located in the San Joaquin River canyon upstream of Friant Dam and impound between of water. The proposed dam would stand high above the river, and it would capture most of the floodwater that would otherwise be spilled from Friant Dam. However, Temperance Flat has come under heavy controversy because it would flood a large scenic section of the San Joaquin River gorge, negatively affect wildlife in the river and inundate two upstream hydroelectric power plants, causing a net loss in power generation. The water supplied from such a dam would be very expensive, ranging from $1000–1500 per acre foot (area farmers currently pay about $60 per acre foot). Raising Friant Dam would likely produce similar increases in the cost of irrigation water.\n\nBy diverting most of the San Joaquin River for irrigation, the Friant Dam has caused about of the river to run dry except in high water years when floodwaters are spilled from the dam. The desiccation of the river has caused the degradation of large stretches of riverside habitat and marshes, and has nearly eliminated the historic chinook salmon run that once numbered \"possibly in the range of 200,000 to 500,000 spawners annually\". Reduction in flows has also increased the concentration of pesticide and fertilizer runoff in the river contributing to pollution that has further impacted aquatic species.\n\nOn September 13, 2006, after eighteen years of litigation, environmental groups, fisherman and the USBR reached an agreement on releasing part of the water currently diverted into the irrigation canals into the San Joaquin River in order to help restore the river and its native fish and wildlife. The first water was released on October 2, 2009 at a rate of . By 2014, these \"restoration flows\" will be increased to per year, or , on top of the that is currently released for agricultural purposes. However, the river restoration project will cause a 12–20% reduction in irrigation water delivered from Friant Dam.\n\n\n\n"}

His death, believed by many to have been caused by members of the police, inspired Nobel Prize laureate Dario Fo to write his famous play titled \"Accidental Death of an Anarchist\".\n\nPinelli was born in Milan to Alfredo Pinelli and Rosa Malacarne. His family was working-class in one of the poorest areas of post-World War I Milan. Although he had to work many low income jobs, such as waiter and warehouseman, in order to make ends meet, he nonetheless found the time to read many books and become politically active throughout his youth. Among other political activities, he also worked with the anarchist group which published the weekly paper \"Il Libertario\".\n\nIn 1954, he found work as a railroad fitter. In 1955, he married Licia Rognini, whom he had met at an evening class of Esperanto.\n\nDuring the 1960s, he continued anarchist activism. He organized young anarchists in the Gioventu Libertaria (Libertarian Youth) in 1962. He helped found the \"Sacco and Vanzetti anarchist association\" in 1965. He founded the Ponte della Ghisolfa association (named after the nearby bridge) in 1968.\n\nOn 12 December 1969, a bomb went off at the Piazza Fontana in Milan that killed 17 people and injured 88. Pinelli was picked up, along with other anarchists, for questioning regarding the attack. Just before midnight on 15 December 1969, Pinelli was seen to fall to his death from a fourth floor window of the Milan police station. Three police officers interrogating Pinelli, including Commissioner Luigi Calabresi, were put under investigation in 1971 for his death, but legal proceedings concluded it was due to accidental causes.\n\nPinelli's name has since been cleared, and the far-right \"Ordine Nuovo\" was accused of the 1969 Piazza Fontana bombing (in 2001, three neo-fascists were convicted, a sentence overturned in March 2004; a fourth defendant, Carlo Digilio, was a suspected CIA informant who became a witness for the state and received immunity from prosecution).\n\nCalabresi was later killed by two shots from a revolver outside his home in 1972. In 1988, former \"Lotta Continua\" leader Adriano Sofri was arrested with Ovidio Bompressi and Giorgio Pietrostefani for Calabresi's murder. The charges against them were based on testimony provided, 16 years later, by Leonardo Marino, an ex-militant who confessed to the murder of Calabresi, under order from Adriano Sofri. Claiming his innocence, Sofri was finally convicted after a highly contentious trial, in 1997.\n\nPinelli's death is the inspiration for:\nHints of his death are also in the songs \"Asilo 'Republic\"' by Vasco Rossi and \"Quarant'anni\" by the Modena City Ramblers.\n\n\n\n"}

A spin-off of the \"Disney's One Saturday Morning\" block on ABC (owned by The Walt Disney Company), it featured animated series from Disney Television Animation aimed at children between the ages of 6 and 12. \n\nIn January 1998, UPN began discussions with The Walt Disney Company (owner of rival network ABC) to have the company program a daily two-hour children's block for the network, airing on weekdays (during the morning or afternoon hours) and Sunday mornings.Attempts to reach a time-lease agreement deal with Disney were called off one week after negotiations started due to a dispute between Disney and UPN over how the block would be branded and the amount of E/I programming that Disney would provide for the block; UPN then entered into discussions with then-corporate sister Nickelodeon (both networks were owned by Viacom) to produce the new block. That February, UPN entered into an agreement with Saban Entertainment (then a subsidiary of Fox Family Worldwide, owned jointly by Fox and founder, Haim Saban, who also owned competing block Fox Kids) – which distributed two series already seen on the UPN Kids block around that time, \"Sweet Valley High\" and \"Breaker High\" – to program the Sunday-to-Friday block.\n\nIn March 1998, UPN resumed discussions with Disney and the following month, The Walt Disney Company and UPN came to an agreement to provide Disney-produced programs on the network on weekdays (from 7:00am - 9:00am or 3:00pm - 5:00pm) and Sunday (from 9:00am - 11:00am). The block was originally announced under the working title \"\"Whomptastic\"\", though the name was changed prior to the debut of the block for greater brand identity (incidentally, \"whomp\" was used as a pejorative term in the Disney-produced animated series \"Recess\", one of the series that would end up part of the new block, as a substitute for \"sucks\").\n\nThe new lineup was later renamed \"Disney's One Too\" in July 1999, formatted to serve as a competitor block to ABC's existing children's block \"Disney's One Saturday Morning\". The block debuted on September 6, 1999, replacing UPN Kids, which ended its run the day before (on September 5) after four years. Compared to the format of \"One Saturday Morning\", \"One Too\" varied in that, instead of incorporating hosted segments, short gag segments from the shows featured in the block (such as \"\", \"Doug\" and \"Recess\", all of which – along with a few other series – were originally aired on \"One Saturday Morning\") were usually shown, often preceding the start of each program, and after commercial breaks. The block also featured a different opening sequence, using more futuristic buildings and a theme similar to that used on \"One Saturday Morning\". Many shows previously aired on \"One Too\" continued in reruns on Toon Disney and Disney Channel.\n\nIn September 2002, the \"One Too\" branding was discontinued as a result of the rebranding of the ABC block from \"One Saturday Morning\" to \"ABC Kids\"; although the UPN block was not revived, the Disney.com website referred to it under the title \"Disney's Animation Weekdays\". The block aired for the final time on August 31, 2003, with the time periods being turned over to UPN's affiliates; this left UPN as the only \"big six\" broadcast television network with no children's programming (and would never broadcast one again for the rest of the network's existence until its 2006 shutdown, and one of only two major commercial broadcast networks that never air a children's programming block (the other being Pax TV, which discontinued its \"Pax Kids\" lineup in 2000, before reviving children's programming as I: Independent Television through the 2006 launch of Qubo).\n\nUPN was not the first \"big six\" network to drop children's programming: NBC became the first to remove kids shows entirely in August 1992, when the network launched a live-action block for teenagers called TNBC; children's programming returned to NBC in 2002, through a time-lease agreement with Discovery Kids. In the years since the block was discontinued, all other major broadcast networks, including UPN successor The CW, would gradually abandon children's programming by selling their respective children's blocks to Litton Entertainment, who produces primarily unscripted E/I content targeted primarily at teenagers, or in the case of Fox, removing children's programming entirely. Fox's sister network, MyNetworkTV, has never supplied children's programming as part of its lineup; both networks leave the responsibility of acquiring E/I programming to the affiliates, primarily through the syndicated block Xploration Station in the case of the former.\n\n\n"}

It is also sometimes used to refer to a system of mutual authentication whereby two parties authenticate one another by signing and passing back and forth a cryptographically signed nonce, each party demonstrating to the other that they control the secret key used to certify their identity.\n\nClosed-loop email authentication is useful for simple situations where one party wants to demonstrate control of an email address to another, as a weak form of identity verification. It is not a strong form of authentication in the face of host- or network-based attacks (where an imposter, Chuck, is able to intercept Bob's email, intercepting the nonce and thus masquerading as Bob.)\n\nA use of closed-loop email authentication is used by parties with a shared secret relationship (for example, a website and someone with a password to an account on that website), where one party has lost or forgotten the secret and needs to be reminded. The party still holding the secret sends it to the other party at a trusted point of contact. The most common instance of this usage is the \"lost password\" feature of many websites, where an untrusted party may request that a copy of an account's password be sent by email, but only to the email address already associated with that account. A problem associated with this variation is the tendency of a naïve or inexperienced user to click on a URL if an email encourages them to do so. Most website authentication systems mitigate this by permitting unauthenticated password reminders or resets only by email to the account holder, but never allowing a user who does not possess a password to log in or specify a new one.\n\nIn some instances in web authentication, closed-loop authentication is employed before any access is granted to an identified user that would not be granted to an anonymous user. This may be because the nature of the relationship between the user and the website is one that holds some long-term value for one or both parties (enough to justify the increased effort and decreased reliability of the registration process.) It is also used in some cases by websites attempting to impede programmatic registration as a prelude to spamming or other abusive activities.\n\nClosed-loop authentication (like other types) is an attempt to establish identity. It is not, however, incompatible with anonymity, if combined with a pseudonymity system in which the authenticated party has adequate confidence.\n\n\"See for a list of all computing and information-security related articles\".\n"}

Auber's version is nowadays the least-performed of the three.\n\nThe opera was premiered on 23 February 1856 by the Opéra-Comique at the second Salle Favart in Paris. It was the first work to be staged by that company that did not have a happy ending. It was staged in Liège in 1875, revived at the Opéra-Comique in 1882, and regularly performed in Germany as well as France. However, since the dawn of the twentieth century stagings have become something of a rarity.\n\nIn North America, the opera was performed in 2006 by the Lyric Opera of Los Angeles at the Los Angeles Theatre.\n\nIn 1990, it was staged at the Opéra Comique de Paris with the Picardy Sinfonietta in Amiens conducted by Patrick Fournillier. Next year the live recording of the opera was released by the French label Le Chant du Monde. Another stage performance took place at the Wexford Festival in October/November, 2002.\n\nThe story only loosely resembles the original novel by Prévost (where, for instance, Lescaut is Manon's brother, not her cousin). There is one character – the Marquis d'Herigny – who represents the several wealthy suitors that Manon became involved with in the novel. Some other characters are absent entirely, and others are completely new to this telling of the story.\n\nThe role of Manon Lescaut is a demanding one, with a very high tessitura, extended florid passages and arias of outstanding technical difficulty. Nonetheless, it also presents great opportunities for characterisation and (at least before the appearance of the operas on the same subject by Puccini and Massenet) was one of the staples of the operatic repertoire – not only in France, but also in Germany. The role of the Marquis d'Herigny, written for the famous baritone, Jean-Baptiste Faure, also features several significant solos; but the tenor role of Des Grieux (given two major arias by Massenet and three by Puccini) lacks a major solo, although the character does participate in a series of fine duets, notably at the death of Manon near the end of the opera.\n\nOne number in the score has retained its popularity with coloratura sopranos. This is Manon's solo, \"\", also known as \"\" or the \"Laughing Song\". It is not a free-standing aria – in fact, it forms part of the act 1 finale – but ever since its creation it has been a chosen showcase for the technique of singers such as Adelina Patti (who sang it during the lesson scene in \"The Barber of Seville\"), Amelita Galli-Curci, Joan Sutherland and Edita Gruberová.\n\n\nNotes \n\nSources\n\n"}

His works include ink and oriental water paintings, such as \"Inwangjesaekdo\" (1751), \"Geumgang jeondo\" (1734), and \"Ingokjeongsa\" (1742), as well as numerous \"true-view\" landscape paintings on the subject of Korea and the history of its culture. He is counted among the most famous Korean painters. The landscape paintings that he produced reflect most of the geographical features of Korea. His style is realistic rather than abstract.\n\nJeong was born in the Jongno District of Seoul, in the Cheongun-dong neighborhood, in 1676. Unlike most painters of the time, he was not born into a wealthy family, but a poor yangban family. The eldest son of Jeong shi-ik (1638–1689), Jeong was born on the third day of the first lunar month in 1676 (equivalent to February 16 in the Gregorian calendar). He was a descendant of illustrious and gentry families. His family originally came from Kwangju. Jeong's \"cha\" was Wonbaek and his \"ho\" was Nangok. His best known pen name is Kyomjae, which he chose himself.\n\nThe poverty he experienced in his youth made him pursue his career as a painter. He was proficient at Zhou-I and astronomy, which he learned while serving as a Geomgyosu (兼敎授; professor extraordinaire). He worked at the Bureau of Painting creating landscapes for patrons and clients. In March 1716, at age 41, he started his tenure at a Geomgyosu of Gwansanggam (觀象監, Office for Observance of Natural Phenomena).\nHe was discovered by an aristocratic neighbour who recommended him to the court. He soon gained an official position. Jeong is said to have painted daily, with a prolific output until old age. He died on the 24th day of the third lunar month in 1759 (equivalent to April 20 in the Gregorian calendar).\n\nJeong was one of the most famous Korean painters. He inspired other Korean artists to follow suit, leaving a lasting impact on Korean art of the Joseon era. He was the most eminent painter in the late Joseon Dynasty (1700–1850). Jeong explored the scenic beauty of the capital city of Hanyang (Seoul), the Han River, the East Sea, and the Diamond Mountain. He is the first painter of true-view Korean landscapes. Differing from earlier techniques and traditional Chinese styles, he created a new style of painting depicting the virtues of Korea.\n\nBy the end of the decade, Jeong had developed his own, more realistic style, likely under the influence of the Sirhak movement. This set him apart from the then-prevailing Chinese literati tradition of idealised and abstract landscape art. His grandson, Jeong Hwang (䜁ό, 1737–?), displayed the true-view landscape style in addition to genre painting.\n\nJeong was one of the few known Korean painters to depart from traditional Chinese styles. It is reported that he frequently left his studio and painted the world around him, as he could see it. His paintings are classified as \"Southern School\", but he developed his own style by realistically portraying natural scenes such as mountains and streams with bold strokes of his brush.\n\nA major characteristic of his work is intermixed dark and light areas, created by layers of ink wash and lines. His mountains are punctuated by forests, which in turn are lightened by mists and waterfalls. Vegetation is made from dots, a technique that bears the influence of Chinese painter Mi Fei (1052–1107). Jeong's style would influence generations of Korean artists, and become one of the iconic images of Korean nationalism.\n\n\n"}

He is best known for his role in establishing the Aboriginal Tent Embassy in Canberra in 1972 and for establishing an Aboriginal Legal Service in Redfern in the 1970s. He also co-wrote and acted in the first indigenous Australian stage production, \"Basically Black\".\n\nGary Edward Foley was born in 1950 in Grafton, New South Wales, and spent much of his childhood in Nambucca Heads. He was expelled from school at the age of 15 and arrived in Redfern in 1967. He worked as an apprentice draftsman and became involved in the \"black power\" movement active in that suburb. The movement was inspired by the American Black Panther Party.\n\nFoley played an active role in organising protests against the Springboks in 1971 as a result of the Apartheid policies in South Africa. At one stage, Foley and fellow protester Billy Craigie were arrested for wearing Springbok jerseys outside the team motel in Bondi Junction with the police believing they had been stolen when they had been supplied by former Wallabies player Jim Boyce. As a result of the level of protests against the Springboks, an Australian tour by the South African cricket team later that year was cancelled and the two-decade exile of South African sporting teams commenced.\n\nIn 1972, Foley was appointed a public relations officer in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. He was fired from the Department after just six weeks, after three warnings, and then secretary Barrie Dexter urged ASIO to spy on Foley.\n\nFoley co-founded the Aboriginal Tent Embassy in 1972 outside Parliament House to highlight Aboriginal disadvantage. The Tent Embassy is still in place despite ongoing controversy and has been nominated for the heritage list. It helped raise the profile of Aboriginal issues prior to the election of the Whitlam Government.

The Lovász local lemma allows one to relax the independence condition slightly: As long as the events are \"mostly\" independent from one another and aren't individually too likely, then there will still be a positive probability that none of them occurs. It is most commonly used in the probabilistic method, in particular to give existence proofs.\n\nThere are several different versions of the lemma. The simplest and most frequently used is the symmetric version given below. A weaker version was proved in 1975 by László Lovász and Paul Erdős in the article \"Problems and results on 3-chromatic hypergraphs and some related questions\". For other versions, see . In 2020, Moser and Gábor Tardos received the Gödel Prize for their algorithmic version of the Lovász Local Lemma.\n\nLet \"A\", \"A\"..., \"A\" be a sequence of events such that each event occurs with probability at most \"p\" and such that each event is independent of all the other events except for at most \"d\" of them.\n\nLemma I (Lovász and Erdős 1973; published 1975) If \nthen there is a nonzero probability that none of the events occurs.\n\nLemma II (Lovász 1977; published by Joel Spencer) If\nwhere \"e\" = 2.718... is the base of natural logarithms, then there is a nonzero probability that none of the events occurs.\n\nLemma II today is usually referred to as \"Lovász local lemma\".\n\nLemma III (Shearer 1985) If \nthen there is a nonzero probability that none of the events occurs.\n\nThe threshold in Lemma III is optimal and it implies that the bound \nis also sufficient.\n\nA statement of the asymmetric version (which allows for events with different probability bounds) is as follows:\n\nLemma (asymmetric version). Let formula_5 be a finite set of events in the probability space Ω. For formula_6 let formula_7 denote the neighbours of formula_8 in the dependency graph (In the dependency graph, event formula_8 is not adjacent to events which are mutually independent). If there exists an assignment of reals formula_10 to the events such that\n\nthen the probability of avoiding all events in formula_12 is positive, in particular\n\nThe symmetric version follows immediately from the asymmetric version by setting\n\nto get the sufficient condition\n\nsince\n\nNote that, as is often the case with probabilistic arguments, this theorem is nonconstructive and gives no method of determining an explicit element of the probability space in which no event occurs. However, algorithmic versions of the local lemma with stronger preconditions are also known (Beck 1991; Czumaj and Scheideler 2000). More recently, a constructive version of the local lemma was given by Robin Moser and Gábor Tardos requiring no stronger preconditions.\n\nWe prove the asymmetric version of the lemma, from which the symmetric version can be derived. By using the principle of mathematical induction we prove that for all formula_8 in formula_18 and all subsets formula_19 of formula_18 that do not include formula_8, formula_22. The induction here is applied on the size (cardinality) of the set formula_23. For base case formula_24 the statement obviously holds since formula_25. We need to show that the inequality holds for any subset of formula_26 of a certain cardinality given that it holds for all subsets of a lower cardinality.\n\nLet formula_27. We have from Bayes' theorem\n\nWe bound the numerator and denominator of the above expression separately. For this, let formula_29. First, exploiting the fact that formula_8 does not depend upon any event in formula_31.\n\nExpanding the denominator by using Bayes' theorem and then using the inductive assumption, we get\n\nThe inductive assumption can be applied here since each event is conditioned on lesser number of other events, i.e. on a subset of cardinality less than formula_34. From (1) and (2), we get\n\nSince the value of \"x\" is always in formula_36. Note that we have essentially proved formula_37. To get the desired probability, we write it in terms of conditional probabilities applying Bayes' theorem repeatedly. Hence,\n\nwhich is what we had intended to prove.\n\nSuppose 11\"n\" points are placed around a circle and colored with \"n\" different colors in such a way that each color is applied to exactly 11 points. In any such coloring, there must be a set of \"n\" points containing one point of each color but not containing any pair of adjacent points.\n\nTo see this, imagine picking a point of each color randomly, with all points equally likely (i.e., having probability 1/11) to be chosen. The 11\"n\" different events we want to avoid correspond to the 11\"n\" pairs of adjacent points on the circle. For each pair our odds of picking both points in that pair is at most 1/121 (exactly 1/121 if the two points are of different colors, otherwise 0), so we will take \"p = 1/121\".\n\nWhether a given pair (\"a\", \"b\") of points is chosen depends only on what happens in the colors of \"a\" and \"b\", and not at all on whether any other collection of points in the other \"n\" − 2 colors are chosen. This implies the event \"\"a\" and \"b\" are both chosen\" is dependent only on those pairs of adjacent points which share a color either with \"a\" or with \"b\".\n\nThere are 11 points on the circle sharing a color with \"a\" (including \"a\" itself), each of which is involved with 2 pairs. This means there are 21 pairs other than (\"a\", \"b\") which include the same color as \"a\", and the same holds true for \"b\". The worst that can happen is that these two sets are disjoint, so we can take \"d\" = 42 in the lemma. This gives\n\nBy the local lemma, there is a positive probability that none of the bad events occur, meaning that our set contains no pair of adjacent points. This implies that a set satisfying our conditions must exist.\n\n"}

It was also the third largest provider of cost-sensitive telecom services sector in Ireland, behind the incumbent operators eir and BT Ireland. It had an estimated 50,000 land-line customers and 18,000 broadband subscribers. Smart operated several services:\n\n\nBackbone services were available to users in parts of Dublin, Cork, Dundalk, Limerick, Letterkenny, Galway, Sligo, Waterford, Wexford, Portlaoise, Mullingar, Carlow, Cavan, Drogheda, Killarney, Tralee and Clonmel.\n\nAt the end of Quarter 1, 2006 there were 322,000 broadband subscribers in Ireland, 35% of internet subscription. Broadband accounted for 19% of all internet subscriptions.\n\nSmart was also a bidder for the Irish mobile operator Meteor following the decision of its parent company to sell all international mobile operators; however on 21 July 2005 it was announced Smart Telecom had withdrawn, leaving the company to be bought by eir, the largest telecoms operator in Ireland, and owner of the local loop throughout the entire country.\n\nOn 16 November 2005 Smart Mobile was offered the country's fourth 3G mobile phone network licence. Vodafone Ireland, O2 Ireland and 3 Ireland already had secured a 3G mobile phone network licence. Acceptance of the licence would have required Smart Mobile to launch its services by 30 April 2007, with 33 percent demographic coverage by 31 October 2009 and 53 percent coverage by 2011.\n\nThe 3G spectrum access fee was set at €114.3 million, with an annual spectrum fee of €2.2 million and an administrative fee of up to €300,000 a year. Taking on a 3G licence would have required substantial capital investment by Smart.\n\nOn 9 November 2005 Smart Telecom announced that it had raised €55.2 million in new funding. This involved a placing of new ordinary shares at a price of €0.20 per share and a debt equity conversion of €10.8 million.\n\nBut this licence was withdrawn in February 2006 by Comreg due to a failure by Smart to provide a €100 million performance guarantee bond in a form acceptable to it within the specified deadline. There was a significant drop in the companies share price subsequently. Smart appealed the decision.\n\nSmart Holdings Ltd lost a bid to sponsor the weather forecast on RTÉ to Glanbia on 7 April 2006. The High Court ruled that its referential bid – based on a formula equivalent to the highest bid received +5% was not valid, because RTÉ terms of offer did not permit this.\n\nIn September 2007, Smart announced their takeover of e-Nvi, a Dublin-based Triple play provider. It also announced that it was investing in an MPEG-4 head end for its own Triple play service; the vendor was confirmed as Thomson.net in October 2007.\n\nHaving head-hunted 49 managers from eir to promote and market broadband door-to-door, some up to five months earlier, the Chief executive of Smart Telecom, Oisin Fanning fired 26 of them abruptly on 31 August 2006. This took place in the context of unmet sales targets of 64,000 sign-ups, aggravated by Smart being unable to get its equipment into many Eir exchanges which meant that Smart had no product to sell in many parts of Ireland.\n\nSmart Telecom (SMR.L) shares traded at 9c in early September 2006, less than two-thirds of their flotation price. Sales for 2006 reached €60 million – up from €45 million in 2005. However losses of €23 million in 2005 were eclipsed by losses of €35 million in 2006.\n\nLater prospects were defined by the achievement of substantial growth in broadband sales volume and eliminating losses, heralded promises which stakeholders, including Seán Quinn, were waiting patiently to emerge.\n\nOisin Fanning, chief executive resigned from this position on 9 September 2006 on health grounds. Further senior resignations also took place. The acting chief executive, Ciaran Casey, then carried out an in-depth financial review of the company as a further investment of €30 million was sought.\n\nThe chairman of the company, Raymond Kings, stated that Brendan Murtagh, the largest shareholder in the company would continue to provide short-term working capital while longer term funding options were being investigated.\n\nDetails of a strategic review, published on 22 September 2006 meant that the employee cohort would be cut from 348 to c100, additional loan funding was to be provided by major shareholders and the company would divest its payphone and pre-paid call card businesses so as to focus on its corporate and residential broadband businesses.\n\nRevenue in the six months to the end of 30 June 2006 dropped 15% to €20.3 million. There was a 61% increase in administrative costs leading to a loss, before exceptional items, of €17.9 million and an operating loss up to €31 million.\n\nOn 2 October 2006 eir, owed €4m by Smart, including arrears of €1.7m, ceased providing wholesale services to Smart Telecom. The result was that the majority of Smart Telecom's customers could not make outgoing calls (except for emergency numbers). According to RTÉ news at the time almost 45,000 customer voice lines were cut off, and Eir was in the process of disconnecting approximately 17,000 broadband customers. Smart issued a notice on their website stating that full service would be restored as soon as possible but declined to give any date for such a restoration.\n\nShortly afterwards, then-Communications Minister Noel Dempsey called on Eir to reconnect a full telephone service to Smart customers.\n\nComreg then announced an interim measure where phone lines to Smart customers were reconnected and they were given the option to join other providers.\n\nIt was revealed on Friday, 6 October 2006 that BidCo, a company controlled by Brendan Murtagh, its largest shareholder, would purchase all of the company's assets, and would also take on its estimate €40m debt. This would also reportedly allow broadband service to be restored immediately. It was confirmed Smart would dispose of the \"calls only\" packages, but would continue to provide call services to broadband customers.\n\nIn an email to customers on the same day, restoration of telephone and broadband services was announced along with a free upgrade of 3 Mbit/s to all broadband customers for the remainder of 2006 as a token of their appreciation.\n\nSmart Telecom entered examinership in August 2009 with an internal examiner reviewing their debts revenue and business structure. Smart Telecom were in debts of up to €70 million to creditors and in loans.\n\nIt was said that Smart had a fair chance of coming out of examinership but also had 2 new investors that would be willing to invest in the company.\n\nSmart Telecom continued operations as normal with no effects to any of its customers during this period.\n\nIn November 2009, the Irish broadband supplier Digiweb announced their intention to purchase Smart. The full takeover took place in early 2010 and the company was officially dissolved in March 2011.\n\n"}

He has held Spanish citizenship since the late 1980s following marriage to a Spanish woman. He is wanted in Spain for the 1985 El Descanso bombing, which killed eighteen people in a restaurant in Madrid, and (as a witness) in connection with the 2004 Madrid train bombings. He is considered by many as 'the most articulate exponent of the modern jihad and its most sophisticated strategies'.\n\nNasar was captured by Pakistani security forces in 2005 and was rendered to Syria, where he was a wanted man. As of April 2014 he was being held in a Syrian prison.\n\nNasar's full name is Mustafa bin Abd al-Qadir al-Rifa'i (); he is a descendant of Ahmed al-Rifa'i who is the founder of the Rifa'i Sufi order, and his paternal great grandmother was Set Mariam (, which means Lady Mariam). His mother is the daughter of Mohammed Nasar, who is an Egyptian came to Syria with Ibrahim Pasha's campaigns against the Ottoman Empire.\n\nNasar has red hair, green eyes, and a white complexion. He was born and grew up in Aleppo in Syria, and attended four years of university studies there at the University of Aleppo's Department of mechanical engineering. In 1980, he joined the Combatant Vanguard organisation, a radical offshoot of the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood, which was at the forefront in the Islamist uprising in Syria against Hafez Assad's government. Nasar was forced to flee Syria at the end of 1980. He then joined the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood organisation in exile, receiving training at their bases and safe houses in Iraq and Jordan. He is reported to have participated in the uprising of Hama in 1982. He emigrated to France and later to Spain in the mid-1980s.\n\nIn 1987, Nasar and a small group of Syrian friends left Spain for Peshawar where they met Abdallah Azzam, the godfather of the Arab-Afghan movement. Nasar was enlisted as a military trainer at the camps for Arab volunteer fighters, and he also fought at the frontlines against Soviet Union in Afghanistan and the Communist government in Kabul after the Soviet withdrawal in 1988.\n\nNasar met Osama bin Laden in Peshawar and claims to have been a member of his inner circle and working for bin Laden until sometime around 1992, when Nasar returned to Spain.\nIn Peshawar, Nasar became well known under his pen name Umar Abd al-Hakim after he published a 900-page treatise in May 1991, entitled 'The Islamic jihadi revolution in Syria', also known as 'the Syrian Experience' (\"al-tajrubah al-suriyyah\"). The treatise was a vehement attack on the Muslim Brotherhood and constituted an important part of the intellectual foundation for al-Qaida and the jihadi current during the 1990s.\n\nFrom 1985 to 1995 Nasar adopted Spain as his primary place of residence, even though he traveled extensively and spent much time in Afghanistan. In Spain, he married his wife Elena Moreno in 1987 (or 88), who converted to Islam. This marriage allowed him to become a Spanish citizen. They have four children.\n\nAmong his associates there were Imad Eddin Yarkas alias Abu Dahdah, head of al-Qaeda's Madrid cell, who was arrested in November 2001, on suspicion of membership in al-Qaida and of involvement in the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States. He was later acquitted of charges of assisting the 9/11 plotters, but convicted of membership in a terrorist organization.\n\nNasar first moved to London in 1994, and brought his family along in mid-1995. It is possible that he fled Spain because of suspicions he was involved in the 1995 Islamist terror bombings in France. For a time Nasar edited \"al-Ansar\", the most important jihadi magazine at the time, with ties to the Algerian Armed Islamic Group (GIA). Nasar left the journal in 1996 partly due to disagreements with the new GIA leadership in Algeria and partly as a result of a conflict with its chief editor, Umar Mahmud Uthman Abu Umar, better known as Abu Qatada al-Filastini. The latter is widely regarded as al-Qaeda's principal cleric in Europe.\n\nIn 1997, Nasar established a media company called \"Islamic Conflict Studies Bureau\" with Mohamed Bahaiah. Through this media office he facilitated two important media events for bin Laden in Afghanistan, in particular Peter Bergen's famous CNN interview with bin Laden in March 1997. In fact, he served in the days before 9/11 as the facilitator who took Western reporters to meet with Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan.\n\nIn the autumn of 1997 Nasar left London for Afghanistan, operating initially as a lecturer and trainer in the Arab-Afghan camps and guesthouses. He settled there with his family in 1998. In 1999 he formed a media and research center in Kabul and in 2000 he was allowed to open his own training camp, the al-Ghuraba Camp, located in Kargha, near Kabul. Nasar's camp was formally part of Taliban's Ministry of defense, and separate from al-Qaida and bin Laden's organization, whom he had fallen out with in 1998. In a seven-page letter from mid-1998, Nasar launched scathing criticism of bin Laden for the disdain al-Qaeda has shown towards the Taliban leadership of Afghanistan, including Mullah Omar. He is also highly critical of their strategies, and has denounced al-Qaeda's 1998 attacks on the US embassies in East Africa, and the 11 September attack on New York's Twin Towers, which he argues put a catastrophic end to the jihadi cause.\n\nOn 19 January 2009, FBI interrogator Robert Fuller testified during a hearing before Canadian Omar Khadr's Guantanamo military commission that during interrogations in October 2002 Khadr confessed to staying at a Kabul guest house run by \"Abu Musab al-Suri\".\n\nIn September 2003, Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon indicted 35 members of the Madrid cell for its role in the 11 September attacks, including Nasar. In November 2004, the United States Department of State named Nasar a \"Most Wanted Terrorist\" and offered a reward of US$5 million for information about his location.\n\nNasar was reportedly captured in the Pakistani city of Quetta in late October 2005, although exactly where and when is disputed. He was handed over to American custody a month or so after his capture; however, he was not among the 14 high-profile al-Qaeda suspects transferred to the Guantanamo Bay detention camp in late 2006, and there were persistent reports that he was one of the ghost prisoners held in secret detention at the U.S. Navy's Naval Support Facility (NSF) on Diego Garcia.\n\nOn 14 April 2009, Spanish magistrate Baltazar Garzon sent out queries as to Nasar's location.\nDaniel Woolls, writing for the Associated Press, reported that Garzon queried Britain, the US, Pakistan, Syria and Afghanistan. The report stated US officials confirmed that Nasar was apprehended in Quetta, Pakistan, in November 2005.\nThe Spanish newspaper \"El País\" attributed Garzon's query to United States President Barack Obama's announcement that the Guantanamo detention camp and the CIA's black sites would be closed.\n\nIt appears that at some stage Nasar was rendered to Syria, where he was a wanted man. In late 2011 rumours emerged that Nasar had been released from a Syrian jail. This was repeated in early 2012 by a posting on an al-Qaeda-linked web forum.\n\nHowever, in March 2014, al-Qaeda spokesman Adam Gadahn revealed that Nasar is still in prison. In April 2014, al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri also confirmed that Nasar is still in prison.\n\nDue to his prolific writings on strategic and political issues, and his guerrilla warfare experience, Nasar is a popular lecturer and to a certain degree an unofficial adviser for a wide range of jihadi groups in Afghanistan. Organizationally, however, he remained a rather independent figure. While some reports have linked him to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who later led al-Qaeda's component of the insurgency in Iraq, his network of contacts was much wider, and included jihadis from Morocco, Algeria, Libya, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Iraqi Kurdistan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Uzbekistan, and elsewhere. Media reports have also alleged that one of his associates, the Moroccan Amer Azizi (Uthman al-Andalusi), had met 11 September organizers Mohamed Atta and Ramzi bin al-Shibh in Tarragona, Spain weeks before the attacks, but this seems to be incorrect.\n\nNasar is reported to be the mastermind of the 2004 Madrid train bombings as well as the 7/7 London bombings. In a statement released after the attacks, al-Suri said: \"[In my teachings] I have mentioned vital and legitimate targets to be hit in the enemy's countries … Among those targets that I specifically mentioned as examples was the London Underground. [Targeting this] was and still is the aim.\"\n\nNasar's best known work is the 1600-page book \"The Global Islamic Resistance Call\" (\"Da'wat al-muqawamah al-islamiyyah al-'alamiyyah\") which appeared on the Internet in December 2004 or January 2005. In an article in the September, 2006 edition of \"New Yorker\" magazine, author Lawrence Wright wrote that in this book, Nasar:\n\nproposes that the next stage of jihad will be characterized by terrorism created by individuals or small autonomous groups (what he terms 'leaderless resistance') which will wear down the enemy and prepare the ground for the far more ambitious aim of waging war on 'open fronts' ... 'without confrontation in the field and seizing control of the land, we cannot establish a state, which is the strategic goal of the resistance.\n\nThe American occupation of Iraq, he declares, inaugurated a `historical new period' that almost single-handedly rescued the jihadi movement just when many of its critics thought it was finished.\n\nIn early 2014 a top Sharia official in the Syrian jihadist group Al-Nusra Front, Dr. Sami al-Oraydi, acknowledged that his group is influenced by the teachings of Abu Musab Al Suri. The strategies derived from Abu Musab's guidelines to win hearts and minds amongst local Muslim communities include: providing services to people, avoiding being seen as extremists, maintaining strong relationships with communities and other fighting groups, and putting the focus on fighting the government.\n\nFrench political scientist Gilles Kepel says that \"he is part of the second generation of the jihadist movement, the ones who were concerned with the failure of mobilization after 9/11.\" Nasar feels that the failure of the 9/11 attacks to rouse global Muslim outrage was compounded by the failure of the jihadist terror campaign in Iraq, and by subsequent Western success in reducing what was once a global movement into increasingly isolated archipelagos of local movements and causes, says Kepel.\n\nNasar conflicted with bin Laden, and a 2001 email was intercepted in which he wrote that \"We are in a ship that you are burning on false and mistaken grounds,\" accusing bin Laden of having \"caught the disease of screens, flashes, fans and applause.\"\n\nBrynjar Lia of the Norwegian Defense Research Establishment portrays him as the most brilliant and dangerous ideologue of his cohort of radicals, \"a dissident, a critic and an intellectual\" who puts \"hard-nosed realism before religious wish-fulfillment and pragmatic long-term strategies before utopianism.\"\n\nScholars Brian A. Jackson and Bryce Loidolt argue that Mohammad Hasan Khalil al-Hakim's \"Management of Savagery\" and al-Suri's \"Call to Global Islamic Resistance\" led al-Qa'ida to innovate and shift practices.\n\nAbu Musab al-Zarqawi, Mustafa Setmariam Nasar (Abu Musab al-Suri), Abdullah Azzam, Ayman al-Zawahiri, and Osama bin Laden were cited by Abu Khalid al-Suri when he addressed ISIL.\n\nMustafa Setmariam Nasar wrote in support of the East Turkestan Independence Movement and praised the conquest of Kashgar by Qutayba ibn Muslim and Yaqub Beg, praising the latter's buildings of educational institutions for Islam and Mosques and calling him \"Attalik Ghazi\" and a \"good man\" for his war against Buddhists and Chinese. Mustafa Setmariam Nasar had met some Uyghurs in Afghanistan where they trained as mujahidin, and its affiliated al-Fajr Media Center distributes TIP material. Mustafa Setmariam Nasar criticized China for restrictions on religion and Islamic teaching imposed on Uyghurs. The Turkistan Islamic Party's 18th issue of its magazine \"Islamic Turkistan\" published an article on Mustafa Setmariam Nasar's career. The Turkistan Islamic Party's 19th issue of its magazine \"Islamic Turkistan\" contained an article by Abi Khadeejah al-Shami on al-Qaeda member Abu Musab al Suri (Mustafa Setmariam Nasar).\n\nIn June 2010, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula was reported to have published \"Inspire magazine\" – its first English language publication, sprung from the imagination of Anwar al-Awlaki. It contained an article published under the name Abu Mu'sab al-Suri.\nThis article was the beginning of a series entitled \"\"The Jihadi experiences\"\". Further articles in this series appeared in the next 5 issues of Inspire. These excerpts were copied from a translation of \"\"The Global Islamic Resistance Call\"\" which appeared in a biography of Abu Musab al-Suri. \n\n\n"}

The text of Froissart's \"Chronicles\" is preserved in more than 150 manuscript copies. This is one of the most lavishly illuminated examples, commissioned by Louis of Gruuthuse, a Flemish nobleman and bibliophile. Several leading Flemish illuminators worked on the miniatures.\n\nThe four volumes are now in the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris as BnF, MSS Français 2643-6, and contain 110 miniatures of various sizes painted by some of the best Brugeois artists of the day. The page size is approximately 44 x 33 cm, with miniatures of various sizes, from 3/4 page and half-page, to historiated initials. The French text is in two columns and there is extensive marginal decoration of scrolling stems and other plant motifs, with some human and animal figures among them.\n\nLoiset Lyédet did the sixty miniatures in the first two volumes. He was a very successful, if somewhat formulaic, illuminator, working mainly on secular manuscripts for Philip III, Duke of Burgundy (Philip the Good) and his court. He probably used assistants, but it is hard to detect separate hands in his work. \n\nThe last two volumes, which are in general finer, were worked on by the anonymous illuminators known as the Master of Anthony of Burgundy (identified by some writers with Philippe de Mazerolles), the Master of Margaret of York, and the Master of the Dresden Prayer Book, the last as an assistant to the Master of Anthony of Burgundy. These masters are named after prominent works or patrons of theirs. It appears that the project was split in half from an early stage, as the scribes who wrote the text and the style of border decoration (also the work of specialists) differ between volumes 1-2 and 3-4. \n\nThe large miniatures by the Master of Anthony of Burgundy are especially sophisticated in style, and those by the young Master of the Dresden Prayer Book (above) are notable for \"their startlingly ambitious palette and combination of colors, agitated and vibrantly modelled drapery, an apparently inexhaustible range of well-designed figure poses, and challenging placement of figures within complex spaces\" (McKendrick). All the illustrations below are from the first two volumes, unless otherwise stated.\n\nLouis of Gruuthuse (1427–1492) was born and lived in Bruges and was an important member of the court of Philip the Good. He appears to have been the second largest purchaser in the period, after Philip himself, of illuminated manuscripts from the best Flemish workshops, then at their peak of success. He had a book collection totalling about 190 volumes, mostly secular in content, of which over half were contemporary illuminated copies. This made his collection over twice the size of the contemporary English Royal collection. Louis was in fact one of the last people to commission new manuscripts on such a scale; he probably began collecting books in the late 1460s, with many of his major commissions dating from the 1470s. In some cases even from that decade the titles already existed in printed form, and by the end of his life most titles could be bought printed, and Flemish illumination, especially of secular works, was in deep decline. Froissart's Chronicles were not printed until about 1498, in Paris. \n\nHe incorporated portraits of himself in miniatures in several books (but not these volumes); an extra figure, wearing the collar of the Order of the Golden Fleece, appears in his copies but not in similar compositions in other copies of the same works. Many of his volumes, like this set, passed to King Louis XII of France, and are now in the Bibliothèque nationale de France. King Louis painted his arms over those of Louis de Gruuthuse on some pages in this set (and in other books had the Burgundian collar of the Fleece over-painted on the de Gruuthuse figures). The current bindings are later (17th or 18th century), but traces of what were probably the original blue velvet bindings remain.\n\nLike the \"Harley Froissart\" (British Library Harley MSS 4379-4380), which is the most fully illustrated of all illuminated Froissarts, this is an example of a notable resurgence of interest in Froissart's work from the late 1460s onwards; the earliest parts of the Chronicles were by then over a century old, and covered a period beginning 140 years before.\n\nAll miniatures by Loyset Liédet, unless stated. Dates are of the events, not the miniatures.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2211812", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2211812", "title": "Chris Sanders", "text": "Chris Sanders\n\nChristopher Michael Sanders (born March 12, 1962) is an American animation director, film director, screenwriter, producer, illustrator and voice actor. He is best known for co-writing and directing Disney's \"Lilo & Stitch\" (2002) and DreamWorks' \"How to Train Your Dragon\" (2010), both of which he co-wrote and co-directed with Dean DeBlois, and for creating and voicing Stitch in \"Lilo & Stitch\" and every Western-produced work in its franchise. He also directed and co-wrote DreamWorks' \"The Croods\" (2013), along with Kirk DeMicco, and later directed 20th Century Studios' \"The Call of the Wild\" (2020), his live action directorial debut and his first film without a co-director.\n\nSanders was born in Colorado Springs, Colorado. He went to Arvada High School in Arvada, Colorado. He is a 1984 graduate of the California Institute of the Arts.\n\nSanders began his career as a character designer for \"Muppet Babies\". He soon became the head storyboard artist for Walt Disney Feature Animation. He also served as a storyboard artist, artistic director, production designer, and character designer on \"Beauty and the Beast\", \"Aladdin\", \"The Lion King\", and \"Mulan\".\n\nIn the late 1980s, Sanders created an allegorical picture book entitled \"The Big Bear Aircraft Company\", with the subheading \"A book for the big retreat\" clarifying that it was created for a Disney offsite event. \"The Big Bear Aircraft Company\" is a thinly disguised version of Disney itself, and the book is critical of the creative process at the company, which prioritized \"big ideas, figuring they will be big successes\" and noted that if proposed aircraft (i.e., movie ideas) \"don't look the same as the ones [that were] built before, [the boss, Big Bear] gets uncomfortable.\" After handing each idea pitched by the \"visual engineer\" to a writer who \"likes airplanes\" but \"has actually never worked on one before, and couldn't tell you for sure what makes one fly\", the story states the assigned writer \"is guaranteed of making the same mistakes every time. He will make his airplane look like every one he's seen before ...\" In the end, the head of the company, Big Bear, gets an airplane that is \"a lot like last year's; not very inspiring and not very memorable. But people bought it before, and they'll probably buy it again. By playing it safe, he's insured his company's survival.\" However, since it is not the only aircraft company, these policies are destined to leave the company vulnerable to more imaginative competitors \"with its wings of good reputation all shot off.\" The story concludes that Big Bear should instead give the visual engineers \"the two things they need to do their job: Bear's trust and time\" to allow smaller, more innovative ideas to flourish. Years later, to explain his motivation regarding the piece, Sanders wrote about his concern over \"the ever-growing complexity of our films, and what I saw as an emerging pattern they were all cut from\", citing the example that during the story development for \"Mulan\", one of the major concerns was the manner of the villain's death rather than the idea that the villain had to die at all. This in turn motivated him to develop \"Lilo & Stitch\", which he summarized as \"a story about a villain who becomes a hero.\"\n\nIn 1985, Sanders created a character named \"Stitch\" for an unsuccessful children's book pitch. When Sanders was the head storyboard artist for Disney Feature Animation, then-Disney CEO Michael Eisner decided that, in the wake of a number of high-profile and large-budget Disney animated features during the mid-1990s, the studio might try its hand at a smaller and less expensive film. Chris Sanders was approached by Thomas Schumacher to pitch that idea, and Sanders reused the \"Stitch\" character he came up with. The story line required a remote, non-urban location, so Sanders chose Kauaʻi as the location. Stitch became the central character of the 2002 film \"Lilo & Stitch\", which Sanders co-directed and co-wrote with Dean DeBlois. Sanders would also end up voicing the character he created for the film. The film's commercial and critical success spawned a franchise with three films and television series, with Sanders reprising his role of Stitch throughout the original 2002–06 run of the franchise (Sanders did not reprise his role for the English dub of the anime \"Stitch!\" or the English-language-produced Chinese animated series \"Stitch & Ai\", with Ben Diskin taking over the role for both series), as well in several later Disney crossover works such as \"Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep\", \"\", and the \"Disney Infinity\" series.\n\nBy December 2006, Sanders had been removed as the director of the upcoming Disney animated film \"American Dog\" by John Lasseter. By March 2007, Sanders had been negotiating his exit from Disney. After the departure of Sanders from Disney, directing duties were handed to Chris Williams and Byron Howard, and the film was retitled \"Bolt\". Despite his departure from Disney, Sanders continues to voice Stitch in most official Disney media (except for the aforementioned Eastern-produced shows).\n\nBy March 2007, Sanders had moved to DreamWorks Animation and had then taken over as director on \"Crood Awakening\" (later renamed to \"The Croods\"), a project previously in co-production with Aardman Animations before their departure from DreamWorks. At the time, Chris had this to say about the move: \"I've been so anxious to start working on things, and so I talked to a lot of people... I like the way DreamWorks looks at animation. Animation still has a lot of different places to go, and I don't want to miss out on a chance to try some new things with it.\"\n\nOn September 24, 2008, it was reported that Sanders and DeBlois would be screenwriting and directing \"How to Train Your Dragon\" for DreamWorks Animation. The film was released on March 26, 2010 and was well received by critics. It grossed nearly $500 million worldwide. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and Best Original Score at the 83rd Academy Awards. The movie also won ten Annie Awards, including Best Animated Feature.\n\nAfter completing \"How to Train Your Dragon\", Chris returned to \"The Croods\", which was released on March 22, 2013. Sanders shared directing and writing credits with Kirk DeMicco, who had joined in the middle of production. The film proved to be a success, grossing over $500 million. Sanders and DeMicco then worked on \"The Croods\" sequel for three and a half years, before its cancellation in late 2016. However, the sequel was revived in September 2017, although with Joel Crawford replacing Sanders as director.\n\nIn October 2017, it was announced that Sanders would be directing a new film adaptation of the 1903 Jack London novel \"The Call of the Wild\" for 20th Century Fox. During the film's production, Disney, Sanders's former employer, acquired 21st Century Fox on March 20, 2019, thus making Sanders employed by Disney in a non-voice acting role again by proxy of Disney attaining ownership of \"The Call of the Wild\" through 20th Century Fox, which Disney renamed 20th Century Studios in January 2020. \"The Call of the Wild\", which became the first film released under the 20th Century Studios label, was released in February 2020. The film received mixed critical reception, with a 62% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, making it the lowest-received film in Sanders's directorial career thus far, and grossed $107.6 million on a budget of $125–$150 million, becoming Sanders's first directorial box-office bomb.\n\nIn February 2020, it was reported that Sanders would reprise his voice role of Stitch for a direct-to-digital live-action remake of \"Lilo & Stitch\".\n\nSanders is married to Jessica Steele-Sanders. Together, they wrote an illustrated novel, titled \"Rescue Sirens: The Search for the Atavist\" (2015). Sanders also draws the popular webcomic \"Kiskaloo\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2211815", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2211815", "title": "Provisional Government of National Unity", "text": "Provisional Government of National Unity\n\nThe Provisional Government of National Unity ( or TRJN) was a government formed by a decree of the State National Council (, KRN) on 28 June 1945. It was created as a coalition between the Polish Workers' Party (, PPR; Communists) and politicians from close political sphere of Stanisław Mikołajczyk, former Prime Minister of the Polish government-in-exile.\n\nWhen Poland was conquered by Germany in 1939, members of the government escaped to Britain, where they established a government-in-exile, which was recognized by the British government, and controlled the main Polish resistance force, the \"Armia Krajowa\" (Home Army).\n\nIn 1943, the PPR and some other left-wing resistance groups formed the KRN as a national government of Poland, in rivalry to the exile government. In July 1944, the KRN proclaimed the Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland (the \"Lublin Committee\") in territory liberated from Germany by the Soviet Army. The exile government denounced this, but was powerless to interfere, especially after the \"Armia Krajowa\" was largely destroyed in the 1944 Warsaw Uprising.\n\nThe exile government was dependent on the support of the British and American governments, which did not grasp Communist intentions and pressured the exile government to cooperate with the KRN. By the time of the Yalta Conference in February 1945, Soviet forces had overrun nearly all of Poland, giving them and the KRN effective control. The US and Britain tacitly accepted this at Yalta, in return for Stalin's promise of free elections in Poland.\n\nThe Polish exile government still tried to hold out, but was ignored. A group including Stanisław Mikołajczyk, Prime Minister in 1943-1944, broke with the rest of the exiles and began seeking a deal with the Communists.\n\nThe TRJN was a result of negotiations held in Moscow from 17 June to 21 June 1945, between the PPR (Polish Communists), the Soviet Union, and Mikołajczyk, who had created the Polish People's Party (\"Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe\", PSL) as the political vehicle for his participation. The PSL was a centrist organization and continuation of the prewar Polish agrarian movement. The pre-war People's Party also supported Mikołajczyk.\n\nThe TRJN government was composed of:\n\nThe entire government was composed of:\n\nThe exile government did not recognize the TRJN.\n\nThe Communists had no intention of giving the opposition any real power, or carrying out the promised 'free and fair' elections. The members of the opposition that received government positions were kept in check by their deputies and staff, loyal to the Communists, so they had little real power.\n\nOn 21 June, General Leopold Okulicki, former Commander of the Polish Home Army was sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment in Moscow for the alleged sabotage against the Soviet Army. Ten other Poles were given similar sentences in the staged Trial of the Sixteen. On 24 December 1946, Okulicki died in Butyrka prison.\n\nThe TRJN was already bound by the \"Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Help, and Cooperation\" with the USSR which the Provisional Government had signed on 21 April. This treaty formed the basis for Soviet interference in Poland's internal politics for the next 40 years.\n\nOn 5 July 1945, the TRJN was recognized by the United States. It was soon also recognized by the other major Allies, France and the United Kingdom. It was not recognized by the Vatican.\n\nOn 6 July, while the Polish government-in-exile maintained its existence, both the United States and the United Kingdom formally withdrew the recognition of it.\n\nOn 10 July, Osóbka-Morawski announced the expulsion of all Germans from Poland.\n\nFrom 17 July to 2 August, a delegation from the TRJN attended the 1945 Potsdam Conference.\n\nOn 16 August, a Soviet-Polish border agreement was signed in Moscow. Before the end of August, Poland agreed to cede the eastern provinces to the Soviet Union and officially recognized the eastern border based on a slightly modified Curzon line.\n\nOn 16 October, delegates of the TRJN signed the United Nations Charter and Poland became a member of the United Nations.\n\nThe 'free and fair' elections promised by the TRJN were postponed until the Communists were sure they could control the election process. In the meantime, they increased repressions of opposition members, who were bribed, threatened, delegalised, or even murdered. In the words of Gomułka, the goal of the Communists was to be the \"\"hegemon\" of the nation\" and nothing would stop them. On 30 June 1946, they tested their control during the 3xTAK referendum, falsifying the results and claiming 68% support.\n\nTwo great reforms carried out by TRJN were the nationalization decree and the Three-Year Plan (of 1947–49), both issued in 1946. The nationalization decree gave the government control over every enterprise which employed more than 50 people; by the end of the year, 90% of the country's industry was controlled by the government.\n\nThe Communists rigged the Polish legislative elections of January 1947. The new parliament (\"Sejm Ustawodawczy\") replaced the KRN; it named a new government headed by Józef Cyrankiewicz. On 19 January 1947, TRJN was dissolved and passed its prerogatives as the government of Poland to the new government.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2211818", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2211818", "title": "WJMN (FM)", "text": "WJMN (FM)\n\nWJMN (94.5 FM; \"Jam'n 94.5\") is a rhythmic CHR radio station licensed to Boston, Massachusetts, United States, under the ownership of iHeartMedia. Its current slogan is \"Boston's #1 For Hip Hop\", and can be heard as far north as the White Mountains under good conditions, and in portions of Maine, Rhode Island, eastern Connecticut and southeastern Vermont. The station's studios are located in Medford and the transmitter site is in Newton, Massachusetts.\n\nWJMN was originally WHDH-FM: a sister station to, and simulcast of, WHDH (AM). In 1965, to comply with a Federal Communications Commission regulation limiting simulcasting between commonly owned AM and FM stations in the same city, WHDH-FM began separate programming with an automated middle-of-the-road format in stereo. In late 1967, WHDH-FM changed its format to automated progressive rock (predating future FM rocker WBCN by several months), but by late 1969, the station returned to automated beautiful music after a little \"intervention\", allegedly from WHDH Inc.'s chief executive officer, Harold J. Clancy (who did not particularly approve of putting rock and roll on \"MY FM station!\"). Although this format remained until 1975, it was not particularly successful, despite a 1972 attempt to establish a separate identity by changing the call letters to WCOZ (as in \"Cozy\").\n\nOriginally owned by Herald-Traveler Corp., parent of the \"Boston Herald-Traveler\" newspaper, the station was sold to Blair Radio in 1972, and in the 1980s to Sconnix. Several ownership changes followed which eventually resulted in Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia) acquiring 94.5 FM.\n\nIn the summer of 1975, WCOZ announced that it would change its format to an album-oriented rock station under their new name \"WCOZ 94½ FM\", which it did on August 15 of that year. Although automated at first, a team of live announcers was hired, led by Kenny Shelton and program director Clark Smidt. By the end of 1975, WCOZ had live announcers around the clock that also included George Taylor Morris, Leslie Palmiter, Lisa Karlin, Mark Parenteau and Robert Desiderio. WCOZ's format was tightened significantly in 1978, when new Program Director Tommy Hadges arrived from arch rival WBCN. Parenteau simultaneously defected to WBCN at that point.\n\nIn 1980, another new program director, John Sebastian, arrived and made some changes. WCOZ was still a rock station, but its focus was tightened to loud, hard rock (or \"Kickass Rock 'N' Roll!\", according to the station's slogan) with minimal announcer talk and short play list. It was extremely successful, peaking with a 13.1 in the ratings in 1982, but with the changes in rock music during the 1980s, the station's success did not last; its rival WBCN moved past it in the ratings. By late 1983, WCOZ had changed formats to a short lived adult contemporary format.\n\nIn September 1984, the station's call letters were changed to WZOU, and flipped to a top 40 format to compete against WXKS-FM (Kiss 108) as \"Z-94\". PD David Gariano had success with the top 40 format, including original 1984 personalities Mike Morin and Brad Krantz, Uncle Johnny, Jonny \"Rock N Roll\" Anthony, Marc Mitchell, and Scott Brunner. In 1985, Pat McKay and Karen \"The Madam\" Blake joined the morning team. WXKS-FM successfully adapted to a mainstream top 40 format in 1988 after being an urban contemporary for many years, which cut into Z-94's ratings. What also didn't help the station's ratings was the declining popularity of the top 40 format in general in the very late 1980s–early 1990s.\n\nSince its inception on May 11, 1993, \"Jam'n 94.5\" has become one of Boston's most successful radio stations. Even after its sale to Chancellor in 1996, station management decided not to tamper with the format as they see WJMN as part of a winning combination with top 40/CHR sister station WXKS-FM, a formula that continues to the present day. WJMN is also a sister station to country music outlet WBWL.\n\nWhen \"Jam'n\" debuted, the station had a playlist of a balanced mix of R&B/hip-hop, rhythmic pop, and dance product (the same approach was used at WXKS-FM when it made the transition from disco to top 40 in 1982 up until their shift to their current mainstream direction in 1988). However, by the end of 1999, it began to play a variety of music that was along the lines of urban contemporary hits, heavy on the hip-hop to the extent of not playing non-rap rhythmic tracks. This would last until the beginning of 2009, when WJMN began tweaking their musical selection to once again include rhythmic/pop-charting artists like Britney Spears, Justin Bieber, Kesha, Katy Perry, David Guetta, Edward Maya, Adele, and Lady Gaga. This tweaking has sparked a lot of talk on radio message boards and follows a pattern among rhythmic-format stations that have scaled back on the heavy amount of hip-hop in favor of a more balanced approach. This continued until mid 2013, when facing competition from rhythmic AC-formatted WBQT (which features some of WJMN's former airstaff), WJMN has added more hip hop and R&B content and scaled back on dance tracks, but still remains rhythmic. Because of this, several music trades (like Mediabase) and Nielsen Audio have listed WJMN as Rhythmic because the audience it targets is racially mixed and the region's African-American population is not that large.\n\nWJMN's voiceover artist was, at first, Brian James. Since the late 1990s, the station's voiceover artist has been Eric Edwards. \"Jam'n\" morning drive, for the first 2 years, was hosted by John \"J.R.\" Edwards. In February 1995, Baltazar, former night show host at WQHT in New York, took over mornings. Two months later, Pebbles, formerly of WILD, became morning co-host. The duo were very popular among Boston listeners, particularly with younger audiences. Baltazar left the show on October 26, 2001, giving way to the \"Ramiro and Pebbles Morning Show\" when afternoon host Ramiro Torres moved to mornings. Pebbles was unexpectedly let go from the station in December 2012, with mornings then hosted by Ramiro, Santi \"Krazy Kulo\" DeOleo and Ashlee Feldman, under the name \"The Ramiro's House Morning Show\". Ramiro and Santi were let go in July 2015 due to their contracts not being renewed. Frankie Vinci, formerly of station KHTS in San Diego (and also a native of the nearby suburb of Framingham), would join the morning show alongside Feldman, with the show now titled \"The Jam'n Morning Show w/ Frankie & Ashlee.\" On May 12, 2016, WJMN replaced Vinci and Feldman with the syndicated Breakfast Club from sister WWPR-FM in New York.\n\nWJMN also has an HD2 sub-channel that runs a soft adult contemporary format known as The Breeze. It previously broadcast old-school hip hop music from January 27, 2006 to March 1, 2013, and offered a simulcast of sister station WXKS from then until November 2018.\n\nFor a time, Boston was the largest market without an urban-formatted radio station; heritage R&B AM daytimer WILD, which served the area's African-American community since 1967, began airing China Radio International programming in June 2011, and its one-time hip hop sister station WBOT (which later became urban AC WILD-FM), which gave the market its first full-time urban outlet on the FM band in 1999 despite having a weak signal, has been defunct since the summer of 2006, when Radio One (which owned both stations) sold it to Entercom and flipped it to a simulcast of WAAF as WKAF. However, in February 2016, AM station WZBR flipped from a simulcast of WSRO to urban. In January 2017, WKAF flipped back to urban AC, returning that format to the Boston market for the first time since WILD-FM flipped over ten years prior, and 11 months later, became a sister station to WJMN.\n\nWJMN is unrelated to WJMN-TV, a CBS affiliate in Escanaba, Michigan.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2211827", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2211827", "title": "Policja (Poland)", "text": "Policja (Poland)\n\nPolicja () is the generic name for the police in Poland. The Polish police force was known as \"policja\" throughout the Second Polish Republic (1918–1939), and in modern post-communist Republic of Poland since 1990. Its current size is 100,000 officers and ca. 25,000 civilian employees. Among the branches in the force are: Criminal Service, Traffic Police Service, Prevention Service and Supporting Service. Most towns and some villages have their own city guards, which supervise public order and road safety. However, city guards have jurisdiction only over misdemeanors and in cases of crimes may serve only in a supportive role for the state police.\n\nThe force's name, \"Policja\", translates into the English language as Police.\n\nAn individual officer is typically called a ' (plural '); these are not, however, official titles and are not included in the official rank structure, they are simply terms used to refer to any police officer regardless of the rank they may hold. A police station is known as ' or ' both of which translate more or less into English as Police Commissariat. Female officers may be referred to as ', the singular of which is '.\n\nOn the whole, officers' individual ranks are not used by the general public and thus when addressing an officer, it is common to hear the term ' (female - '), Polish for mister/miss used to refer to police officers. On occasion, this may or may not be followed by the term \"\".\n\nIn 1919, with the re-independence of the Polish nation, the state reorganised itself along non-federalist lines and established a centralised form of government. Under the auspices of the new government, a new national police force was formed; this 'Polish State Police' (Policja Państwowa) then existed as the primary law enforcement agency for the entire nation up until the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. During the inter-war period, a number of key law enforcement duties were delegated to other formations, such as the Border Guard and Military Gendarmerie.\n\nWith the end of World War II and the onset of the communist period, the new Soviet backed government decided to radically change the structure of policing in Poland; the state 'Policja' was renamed as the 'Milicja Obywatelska' (Citizen's Militia), a name which was meant to reflect a change in the role of the police, from an instrument of oppression ensuring the position of the bourgeoisie, to a force composed of, and at the service of 'normal citizens'. Ironically the reality turned out to be largely the opposite and the Milicja instead represented a rather state-controlled force which was used to exert political repression on the citizens. The Milicja was, for the most part, detested by the general populace; events such as the police's conduct during the Gdańsk Shipyard Strike and surrounding the Popiełuszko affair, only worsened the people's view of their law enforcement agencies.\n\nAfter the fall of the communist government in Poland, the system was reformed once again, this time reviving the pre-war name of 'Policja' and albeit with a few minor changes, the general system of law-enforcement of the Second Republic.\n\nToday, most common types include various models from Kia (Cee'd model - ca. 4000 in use) Škoda (mainly Octavia), Alfa Romeo, Ford Mondeo, Opel (mainly Opel Astra), Volkswagen, and Toyota, as of 2011 the FSO Polonez (manufactured in Poland) is no longer in use. The Polish police force has, since joining the European Union, been undergoing a thorough restructuring and has in the process acquired a large number of new vehicles; as of 2011 this process is still ongoing and new vehicles are constantly being procured in order to replace ageing old patrol cars as their service lives come to an end. In addition to standard sedan and hatchback model vehicles, the Policja has been investing significant amounts of money in developing their ability to respond to any incident no matter where it may be, this has in turn led to the purchase of a large number of all-terrain 4x4 vehicles and multi-purpose vans and trucks. This expansion in capabilities was a stated requirement of the police force's restructuring program.\n\nBeginning in 2009, the painting scheme is being modified to a silver body design with blue reflective strip, similar to modern German police cars.\n\nTraditionally, vehicles were painted a dark blue color with side doors painted in white, and with white stripes and the word \"POLICJA\" on both sides. Earlier versions (used at the beginning of the 1990s) had a thinner stripe with the word \"POLICJA\" written under it. This design was adopted from the paint scheme used by the communist milicja. Some formerly used vehicles even had visible traces of the word \"POLICJA\" being corrected from \"MILICJA\", with the first two letters in a different shade of white, on a patch of a different shade of blue.\n\nAll uniformed and most non-uniformed officers of the state police are routinely armed. In addition to their firearm, Policja officers carry handcuffs and a number of other pieces of equipment which usually includes a personal radio system for communication with other officers and their police station. Pepper spray is also commonly issued to officers in order to provide them with a non-lethal alternative weapon with which to incapacitate violent suspects.\n\nRiot police, when needs be, are provided with non-ballistic body armour, helmets and shields. Less-lethal weaponry is also used by riot-control units such as shotguns with rubber bullets, tear gas canisters or water cannons. Sometimes they also deploy LRAD units. The strict control of civilian firearms ownership in Poland, only recently liberalized, has significantly aided the police in keeping gun crime to a minimum, and thus the incidence of police firearms use is low.\n\nThe below list is not intended to be a full list of all the vehicles used by the Polish Police, instead it lists the most commonly used vehicles.\n\nThe Policja currently has a total of 16 helicopters at its disposal, these are based in:\n\n\nIn addition to the airborne and land-based patrol units of the Policja, many regional commands, and especially those based near the coast or through which major waterways flow, have maritime units. The largest of police maritime units are currently found on the Vistula river in Warsaw (under the command of the Capital Police) and the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship where there is a large network of lakes and rivers. In coastal areas, maritime law enforcement cooperation also exists between the Policja and the Polish Border Guard.\n\nThe Policja's general commandant is the senior-most officer of the Polish police. The rank of the general commandant (usually General Inspector) is considered to be equivalent to that of a ranking general in the Polish military and this both himself and his subordinate chief inspectors (who are also considered Police 'Generals') are entitled to wear embroidered white eagles, the state symbol, on their uniform lapels.\n\nThe general commandant's office is based in Warsaw's Puławska Street. It is from here that the day-to-day administration and organisation of the Polish police's activities is coordinated. The commandant's office is considered to have jurisdictional supremacy over all its other commands, and voivodeship/municipal commandants are responsible to the general commandant in their capacity as his regional 'executives'.\n\nThe office of general commandant has existed in a number of guises throughout the existence of the Polish police, and whilst the current office came into being following Poland's transformation into a liberal democracy in 1990, the same rank was also used for the highest-ranking officer of the State Police of the Second Republic during the inter-war years. Nowadays, holders of this office are considered to be successors to the commandants of the inter-war state police; commanding officers of the communist-era Milicja Obywatelska \"(Citizens' Militia)\" however, are not considered successors of the original cadre of Policja generals as they exercised authority over an organisation often utilised by the state as an instrument of political oppression.\n\nSince 1990 there have been twelve general commandants of the Policja who have completed their service. General Inspector Marek Papała, the formet holder of the office, was assassinated by a person or persons unknown on 25 June 1998. He was shot in the head with a silenced weapon whilst exiting his car near his home in Warsaw's southern Mokotów district. The commandant's murder remains unsolved and is considered to be one of the most significant outstanding cases under active investigation by the Polish police.\n\nThe Policja is currently divided into a number of different services. Each voivodeship/municipal command has subdivisions within its force. This leaves the police service with a large number of specialised branches which can more specifically target certain types of crime and apply more expert knowledge in the investigation of cases relating to their area of policing. In addition to these specific groups, all police forces retain a majority of officers for the purpose of patrol duty and general law enforcement. \n\nTypically a constituent force of the Policja will contain the following subdivisions within its structure:\n\nThe Policja has highly qualified and well-equipped counter-terrorism formations. The central (national-level) anti-terrorism is BOA KGP (\"Biuro Operacji Antyterrorystycznych Komendy Głównej Policji\", Bureau of Anti-terrorism Operations of The Policja Headquarters), which is part of the Komenda Główna Policji (Policja Headquarters). On a regional level, voivodeship commands have control of smaller units called SPAP (\"Samodzielny Pododdział Antyterrorystyczny Policji\", Independent Anti-terrorism Policja Subunit), these units are responsible for, high-risk arrests, search warrant execution service, hostage rescue operations (only in alarm situations; BOA has priority in this task) and other similar tasks.\n\nBecause of their training and skill level, members of the BOA and SPAP units cooperate with similar special police formations from the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany and other ATLAS members. They also, train with servicemen from Biuro Ochrony Rządu, Straż Graniczna, Agencja Bezpieczeństwa Wewnętrznego, Wojska Specjalne, and most recently with the U.S. Army and 10th CAB's premier special missions company, A/3-10 GSAB WarAngels. \n\nSince the Policja's foundation in its current form in 1990, the service has taken part and continues to participate in a number of international peacekeeping and international police missions around the world. To date the Policja has sent officers to participate in the following international peacekeeping missions:\nIn addition to participating in international missions, the Policja also send delegates to and cooperate with international law enforcement agencies and organisations such as Europol and Interpol. Currently the Polish officers make up the eighth largest staff contingent of Europol; a figure which is expected to rise as the Polish police force becomes more integrated with, and more active within, the organisation. Europol has also become far more important to Poland's policing community in recent years since Poland, in 2007, became a signatory of the Schengen Agreement, allowing for greater European integration, uninterrupted travel, and cross-border police cooperation. To this end, Polish cooperation with the German, Czech, Slovakian and Lithuanian police services has reached an all-time high. Furthermore, the Policja officers have taken part in a number of foreign police officer training and exchange programs, such as Project Lifesaver, which has seen a number of officers sent to the UK to observe and discuss alternative methods of policing abroad.\n\nAs a constituent member of Interpol, the Polish police is expected to adhere to the terms of International arrest warrants and cooperate with the police forces of other nations through formal diplomatic channels. In many cases such cooperation has led to the arrest of high-risk criminals.\n\nThe Polish Police is a centralised police force, organised under one central command in Warsaw and with all officers assigned to one of 17 voivodeship/municipal operations' commands, except in the case that they are specialists working independently for the national commandant.\n\nThe Policja has five training establishments sited within Poland. Four of these training establishments are police schools for enlisted personnel, whilst the fifth is a higher educational institution tasked with the education of officers and senior officials in a range of disciplines and expertises. The four junior colleges are located in:\nThe final police training establishment in Poland is the or Higher Police School in Szczytno (Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship). This school was founded in 1954 as the officer academy of the Milicja Obywatelska, renamed in 1972 to the Higher Militia School, the college finally became the Higher Police School upon Poland's return to liberal democracy in 1990. Since then it has remained the only establishment in the country certified to run courses for commissioned officers of the Polish police, and the officer's commissioning course. All students who attend the Higher Police School are expected to study criminal, constitutional and economic law. In addition to academic studies, officer candidates are trained in modern policing techniques, weapons' handling, and informatics. The college has numerous links with senior police academies in Europe and throughout the wider world.\n\nThe Representative Honor Guard Company () is the ceremonial drill unit of the police. Affiliated with the Representative Honor Guard Regiment of the Polish Armed Forces, it performs public duties and drill and ceremony on behalf of the police force and the President of Poland. In regards to national events, it mainly performs during the annual National Independence Day ceremony in November alongside other honor units on Piłsudski Square.\n\nThe Policja's representative band was first founded in 1968. Its core was composed of a group of several musicians, which gradually expanded. From the beginning, the band improved rapidly, reaching a high artistic level, as reflected in the discretion of the judges at musical contests nationwide. In the years 1984, 1986, 1988, the band won its most prestigious trophy, the Cup of the Minister of Internal Affairs. From the outset, the musicians performed at various national, departmental, religious and state events. The band's musicians have on numerous occasions represented the Polish police outside the country, including concerts in Denmark, Belgium, Czech Republic, Belarus and Russia, yet they still value their well-kept tradition of playing performances for the ordinary residents of Warsaw. The band's musical repertoire includes marches, concert pieces, transcriptions of orchestral music and religious songs, as well as a great deal of other developmental music. Being the official representative band of the Policja, the group's musicians are often invited to play parade music for important events on national holidays such as the 3rd May Constitution Day.\n\nOverall the level of trust in the Policja and its work has increased steadily over the years since 2001. In 2001 only 46% of respondents to a national survey carried out on behalf of the police categorised their work and achievements as 'good', however, by the end of 2009 this figure had grown significantly, and despite small undulations, an average of 72% rated the Policja's work as 'good' or better. This brings the level of trust in the police to around the same level of 64-75% seen in other member states of the European Union.\n\nMuch in the same way as other national police forces, the Policja is sometimes criticised for the methods it employs in maintaining law and order, such criticism is typically voiced by Polish youth. This is most commonly expressed with the acronyms (C)HWDP and JP.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2211838", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2211838", "title": "Laughing Cavalier", "text": "Laughing Cavalier\n\nThe Laughing Cavalier (1624) is a portrait by the Dutch Golden Age painter Frans Hals in the Wallace Collection in London, which has been described as \"one of the most brilliant of all Baroque portraits\". The title is an invention of the Victorian public and press, dating from its exhibition in the opening display at the Bethnal Green Museum in 1872–1875, just after its arrival in England, after which it was regularly reproduced as a print, and became among of the best known old master paintings in Britain. The unknown subject is in fact not laughing, but can be said to have an enigmatic smile, much amplified by his upturned moustache.\n\nThe portrait measures 83 × 67.3 cm (32.7 × 26.5 in) and is inscribed at top right \"Æ'TA SVÆ 26/A°1624\", which expands to \"aetatis suae 26, anno 1624\" in Latin and means that the portrait was painted when the sitter was 26 and in the year 1624. The identity of the man is unknown, and though the recorded 19th-century titles in Dutch, English and French mostly suggest a military man, or at least an officer in one of the part-time militia companies that were often the subjects of group portraits, including some by Hals and later Rembrandt's \"Night Watch\" (1642), in fact he was as likely to be a wealthy civilian. Art historian Pieter Biesboer has theorised the painting possibly depicts Dutch cloth merchant Tieleman Roosterman, the subject of another of Hals' portraits.\n\nThe composition is lively and spontaneous, and despite the apparent labour involved in the gorgeous, and very expensive, silk costume, close inspection reveals long, quick brush strokes. The turning pose and low viewpoint are found in other portraits by Hals and here allow emphasis on the embroidered sleeve and lace cuff. There are many emblems in the embroidery: signifying \"the pleasures and pains of love\" are \"bees, arrows, flaming cornucopiae, lovers' knots and tongues of fire\", while an obelisk or pyramid signifies strength and Mercury's cap and caduceus fortune.\n\nIn general, commissioned portraits such as this rarely showed adults smiling until the late 18th century, though smiling is often seen in tronies and figures in genre painting. But Hals is an exception to the general rule and often showed sitters with broader smiles than here, and in informal poses that bring an impression of movement and spontaneity to his work.\n\nThe effect of the eyes appearing to follow the viewer from every angle is a result of the subject being depicted as looking directly forward, toward the artist's point of view, combined with being a static two dimensional representation of this from whichever angle the painting itself is viewed.\n\nThe painting's provenance only goes back to a sale in The Hague in 1770; after further Dutch sales it was bought by the Franco-Swiss banker and collector the Comte de Pourtalès-Gorgier in 1822. After his death the painting was acquired at the auction of his collection in Paris in 1865 by Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford, who outbid Baron James de Rothschild at more than six times the sales estimate. It was in Hertford's Paris home in 1871, listed as \"portrait d'un homme\" (\"portrait of a man\"), and then brought to London, probably for the purpose of exhibiting it in a large and long loan exhibition of old master paintings at Bethnal Green, which was deliberately sited away from the West End of London to attract the working classes. The exhibition was a huge success and \"A Cavalier\" (the catalogue title) a particular hit with both public and the critics; it played a considerable part in raising the critical estimation of Hals in England. By 1888, when it was again exhibited at the Royal Academy, it had become \"Laughing Cavalier\", though a cleaning in the intervening period (in 1884) may have changed the effect. The critic in the Athenaeum noted a brighter appearance, but also that \"The man smiles rather than laughs\". Hertford's collection was bequeathed to his natural son Sir Richard Wallace Bt., whose widow donated it and his London house to the nation as the Wallace Collection.\n\nThe \"Laughing Cavalier\" is used by McEwan's beer as its logo. It has been modified showing the Laughing Cavalier enjoying the beer.\n\nIn the \"Scarlet Pimpernel\" adventure series by Emma Orczy, \"The Laughing Cavalier\" is a prequel recounting the story of the supposed subject of the painting, who is an ancestor of her main hero, the Scarlet Pimpernel, Sir Percy Blakeney.\n\nThe \"eyes following you round the room\" trope has long been a stand-by in British comedy, used by Pete and Dud in \"The Art Gallery\", among many others, sometimes in the form of a portrait with cut-away eyes that can be used as a peephole.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2211841", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2211841", "title": "Secret Wars II", "text": "Secret Wars II\n\nSecret Wars II is a nine-issue comic book limited series and crossover published from 1985 to 1986 by Marvel Comics. The series was written by Marvel's then Editor-in-chief Jim Shooter and primarily pencilled by Al Milgrom.\n\nThe series was a sequel to original series \"Secret Wars\", published in 1984 and 1985. The series tied-in with issues of other Marvel titles, with each \"tie-in\" featuring a \"Secret Wars II\" logo in the top right hand corner to indicate that it was a part of the overall story. This was the first time Marvel published a story where the reader would have to purchase multiple titles in order to read the entire story.\n\nThe entity that instigated the first Secret War, the Beyonder, visits Earth in search of enlightenment and inevitably comes into conflict with Earth's superhumans and the cosmic entities that exist in the Marvel Universe. At first, the Beyonder tries to figure out the meaning of the simple everyday tasks humans do, such as: eating, sleeping, using the bathroom, etc, then the Beyonder works for a mobster and becomes very powerful and obsessed with gadgets. The Earth's heroes are very suspicious of him and this causes the Beyonder to retreat to a lone island. Mephisto recruits an army of supervillains with boosted strength, but the Thing fights them off after he is given augmented strength as well. The Beyonder falls in love with Dazzler, and tries to start a relationship with Boom Boom, but both turn him down. It is also explained how Doctor Doom, who was killed in the \"normal\" timeline, was able to appear in the first \"Secret Wars\".

It is part of an international organisation that consists of eight priories that form the Order of St John. The organisation is sometimes incorrectly referred to as \"St John's Ambulance\" instead of \"St John Ambulance\".\n\nSt John First Aid training centres were established in Australia in the late 19th century. On 13 June 1883 a public meeting was held in the Melbourne Town Hall to form a local branch of the association. By the end of June 1883, a centre had been established under the leadership of Edward Neild.\n\nThe first division of the St John Ambulance Brigade (now known as St John Ambulance Event Health Services) was established in Glebe, New South Wales in 1903. A division of this organisation is still in operation today and is known as St John Ambulance Glebe Division. After this initial division was established other states followed suit, with divisions being set up in other states soon after. In 1987, the organisation adopted a single public title, \"St John Ambulance Australia\". The cadet movement was established in Australia in 1925 with a division in Glebe, NSW. The first Grand Prior's Badge issued outside the UK went to a cadet from Marrickville Cadet Division in 1933 named Marion Higgins.\n\nThe organisation is divided into the states/territories who have their own boards and oversee the day-to-day running of St John. Some states are also divided into regions, who oversee all branches and report to the state boards. St John Ambulance Australia has three main branches, with each one having its own specific area of operation.\n\nSt John provides volunteer event health & first aid services at events and emergencies. First Aid Services is divided into states, regions and divisions.\n\nEvents covered by St. John Australia include sports, such as the 2006 Melbourne Commonwealth Games, where a team of 500 members treated over 3000 casualties. Other events covered include sporting events, such as the Australian Open, music concerts and community fetes.\n\nSt John EHS volunteers support state emergency management and disaster plans in some states, in conjunction with other organisations like the State Emergency Service.\n\nSt John is the largest first aid training organisation in Australia. Apart from its flagship Provide First Aid (a workplace first aid course), St John also offer instruction in topics such as Advanced Resuscitation, Advanced First Aid, AED (Automated External Defibrillation) and analgesic administration, remote first aid and occupational first aid.\n\nSt John Ambulance in Australia raises funds and recruits staff for the St John Ophthalmic Eye Hospital in Jerusalem. Funds are raised through public donations, and income received from conducting first aid courses and selling first aid kits and merchandise.\n\nSt John Community Care conducts programs that are specific to each state. These activities range from assisting disadvantaged youth, to providing voluntary transport and support programs for the frail and elderly.\n\nIn Western Australia St John Ambulance provides the ambulance service. This service is provided through a combination of paid and volunteer staff. Paid ambulance officers and paramedics are used in the metropolitan areas and larger regional centres. Volunteer ambulance officers are used in regional areas and some outer metropolitan areas.\n\nIn the Northern Territory St John Ambulance provides the ambulance service. This service is provided through a combination of paid and volunteer staff. Paid ambulance officers and paramedics are used in the metropolitan areas and larger regional centres. Volunteer ambulance officers are used in regional areas. Aeromedical role is offered by CareFlight operating an AW 139 out of Darwin.\n\n^ Youth Leaders are adult members who have undertaken a specific leadership course and are ranked above youth but below all adult ranks\n\n\nSt John runs Cadet Divisions for children aged 8–17, this includes Juniors (8-11) and Cadets (11-17). These can be found in most towns or suburbs of major cities in Australia. Examples are Glebe Division and Bathurst Division in New South Wales, Greater Dandenong Division in Victoria and Playford Cadet Division in South Australia.\n\nThe youth program in Australia, focuses on developing young people in a variety of aspects. Young members are taught first aid and participate in youth development and social activities. For cadets, it is also possible to study for various 'badges'. Some of the topics available include counter-disaster, animal care and cookery.\n\nAcross most divisions, youth and cadet divisions meet once a week, in a designated place, to conduct a training night. There is a designated training program for youth and cadet divisions\n\nYouth members within Event and Emergency First Aid Service programs attend public duties to provide first aid at various events to members of the public. These duties include things such as: Big Day Out, Royal Easter Show (NSW), National Folk Festival (ACT), AFL Games (All AFL states), NRL, Super 12, and Rugby Union games, amongst other popular events. There are also many more lower profile events, like local fetes and markets. At these duties, St John members use treatment tools such as oxygen therapy equipment, defibrillators and analgesic gases on top of the standard first aid equipment.\n\nIn most states, new youth members (minimum age 14) will be put through a Senior First Aid Course (SFA) free of charge.\n\nSt John youth also provides leadership opportunities for people of all ages. The program possesses a leadership program and a ranking system similar to the military.\n\nFirst aid competitions are also held each year. In these competitions, cadets (in teams of up to 3, or on their own) are tested on their first aid skill, practical thinking and problem solving ability, and scene management skills. A national competition is held every year, at the National Cadet Camp.\n\nEach state and territory is encouraged to facilitate provision of a youth council, the National Office also facilitates the Australian Youth Council. Broadly, youth councils provide guidance to St John on issues affecting the organisation and its future development, particularly concerning the opinion and interests of young people.\n\nIn 2006, the Australian Youth Council (AYC) restructured to be made up of 16 state/territory representatives (nominated by their state/territory, including the state/territory chairperson and another representative) and 5 National portfolio holders, including a Communications Coordinator, Training and Leadership Coordinator, Research Development Coordinator, Policy Coordinator and Australian Chair. The AYC Chair also sits as a full member of the National Board of Directors for St John Ambulance Australia. The aims of the Australian Youth Council include:\n\n\nThe AYC usually meets in person once or twice a year, usually including the National Conference or Priory in June, and another meeting (Youth Stakeholders Weekend) later in the year, as well as teleconferences during the year which may include either the entire council or the National Team.\n\nYouth councils consist of young people in the organisation who are aged 12 to 25 years.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2211886", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2211886", "title": "Hermann Loew", "text": "Hermann Loew\n\nFriedrich Hermann Loew (19 July 1807 – 21 April 1879) was a German entomologist who specialised in the study of Diptera, an order of insects including flies, mosquitoes, gnats and midges. He described many world species and was the first specialist to work on the Diptera of the United States.\n\nHermann Loew was born in Weissenfels, Saxony a short distance south of Halle (Germany). The Loew family, though not wealthy, was well-placed. Loew's father was a functionary for the Department of Justice of the Duchy of Saxony who later became a \"Geheimer Regierungsrath\" of Prussia. Between 1817 and 1829 Loew attended first the Convent school of Rossleben, then the University of Halle-Wittenberg, graduating in mathematics, philology and natural history.\n\nRecognizing his abilities as a mathematician, the university, on his graduation, appointed him as a lecturer in the same subjects. In 1830 he went to Berlin and gave lessons in different higher grade schools including the \"Kadetten-Schule\" military school. Here he was private tutor to Prince Biron heir to the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia and the young Friedrich Wilhelm Ernst Albrecht von Graefe (1828–1870) later one of the most famous oculists of all times. In 1834 Loew was appointed superior teacher (\"Oberlehrer\") at the Friedrich-Wilhelm-Gymnasium in Posen, known today as St. John Cantius High School in Poznań, Poland where he taught mathematics and natural history. In the same year he married the daughter of senior preacher Ehricht, a favourite sermoniser. Several of Loew's pupils at Posen became scientific celebrities, the most notable being the philosopher Kuno Fischer (1824–1907) and the mathematicians Leo Königsberger (1837–1921) and Lazarus Immanuel Fuchs (1835–1902). That they became such, gifted though they were, must have been due to Loew's extraordinary abilities and his popularity with students.\n\nIn 1841-2 Loew accompanied Heinrich Kiepert (1818–1899), a celebrated geographer, and August Schoenborn to the Near East. The results of this trip were later partly communicated to Hermann Carl Conrad Burmeister (1807–1892), Philipp Christoph Zeller and to Alexander von Humboldt (1769–1859), but the remainder (the greatest part), were used in Loew's own later publications. August Schoenborn, philologist and geographer, was also a professor at the Friedrich-Wilhelm-Gymnasium in Posen, and author of Latin school books. He eventually became Loew's brother-in-law. Humboldt was of course the author of the chattily readable \"Kosmos\", an account of the visible universe, and the most celebrated German naturalist explorer of his day. Many other countries were visited en route including Turkey and Asia Minor.\n\nIn 1848 Loew was elected to the German Parliament in Frankfurt am Main. Elected to the first German Parliament when 40 years old, Loew resisted the separatist longings of the Poles from his outpost (Posen) near the frontier of Poland. He belonged to Heinrich von Gagern's Imperial Party, a grouping which fostered Liberalism in Germany and pursued a policy of fusion for the German states.\n\nDisillusioned by failure to realise German unity and distressed by the death of his 21-year-old daughter from the plague, in 1850, Loew left politics. In 1850 he was appointed director of the royal Realschule Mesritz (a Realschule is a school emphasizing technical and scientific studies). Due to the efforts of Loew, the Mesritz Realschule was later to become a gymnasium (a more classical sort of school, though still scientific). While at Mesritz Loew gave up politics so as not to be in conflict with the educational department, and resisted offers of a seat in the Prussian Landtag (Federal state parliament) for the district of Mesritz-Bomst.\n\nSevere health problems between 1851 and 1854 forced retirement. In 1868 he received a pension and took up the study of Diptera full-time after moving to Guben, Prussia. Here he worked incessantly on Diptera.\n\nIn 1870 he was elected city councillor and vice-president of the city council in Guben and held a seat in the legislature in Berlin for the Sorau-Guben district between 1873 and 1876.\n\nThe imminent end of Loew was signalled on a summer holiday in Blankenburg in Thuringia when he had a paralytic stroke after which he sought treatment in the Diaconissen-Haus in Halle, Saxony, and died, on April 21, 1879. Only three of his seven children survived him. His obituary in the Vassisches Zeitung described him as a \"distinguished pedagogue, naturalist pioneer of German Unity\".\n\nA Lutheran protestant, Loew's motto was \"Gott Helfe\" – God helps or God may help. Loew was an obsessive worker. Something of his nature can be judged from his refusing to eat warm food to pay off the loans incurred during his education, and from his extraordinary calligraphy, with its machine-like precision. There is never any difficulty with reading a Loew label, characteristically justified to the side margins. Loew shared such personality traits with the neurotically-obsessive fellow entomologist Alexander Henry Haliday. \nHermann Loew was undoubtedly the dominant dipterist from the 1840s and the following three decades. Although predominantly a describer — delineating the taxonomically useful characters of more than 4,000 species mainly from the Palaearctic and North America, but also from the Afrotropics and the Far East — Loew made important contributions to higher taxonomy.\n\nHermann Loew is best known with regard to Diptera paleontology for his work with Baltic amber inclusions. He was the first investigator to seriously interest himself in the Diptera of amber and his 1850 work on the amber Diptera from the Baltic region was the major foundation for all future study on amber Diptera.\n\nLoew's personal Baltic amber collection is in the Natural History Museum, London. Types of fossil species based on material in the Klebs Collection are now in Göttingen. Fossil types based on specimens from the Berendt collection are in the Paläontologisches Museum, in the present day the \"Museum für Naturkunde\" (the Natural History Museum of Berlin). Types of recent Diptera are in the \"Museum für Naturkunde\", Berlin, except for the North American species, which are in the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, the South African material, which is in the University of Halle, Zoological Museum, and the Alaskan species, which are in the Zoological Museum in Helsingfors. Other Loew specimens, including types, are in the Natural History Museum in Stockholm and in the Natural History Museum, London (Lepidoptera from Turkey). Small numbers of specimens are in the Natural History Museum in Dublin, Ireland and in the Hope Department of Entomology, University of Oxford.\n\nAside from Diptera collected by Loew himself, mostly from the area around Posen and Meseritz (then in Prussia but now in Poland) and elsewhere in what is now Germany. The collection contains much material collected by other, mostly anonymous German entomologists from Germany and other parts of Europe. There is also material collected in (not by Loew): \"Brasilien, Bismark Arch[ipelago] Ralum, Bogota, Columbien, Chile, Venezuela, Cuba, Carolina, Chile, Sumatra, Soekaranda, Montivide[o], Askhaabad, Transcaspian, Amboine, Klein-Asien-Asia Minor, Arab fel., Andalusia, Griechenland, Santiago, Lapland, N.

The collection, however, contains:\n\n\n\n\nLonger list of works see the references in Sabrosky's Family Group Names in Diptera and also the German version of this page.\n\n\n"}

Full-production E231-0 series trains were subsequently introduced on the Chūō-Sōbu Line (10-car sets) and Joban Line (10+5-car sets). Other variants include the 11-car E231-500 series for the Yamanote Line, and the E231-800 series with 2,800 mm wide bodies and end doors for use on Tokyo Metro Tozai Line inter-running services.\n\nFrom 2000 onward, the first E231-1000 series outer-suburban variant was delivered for use on Utsunomiya Line and Takasaki Line services north from Ueno Station in Tokyo. These trains included transverse seating in some cars and were also equipped with toilets. Production continued into 2006 with trains delivered for use on the Tokaido Main Line south from Tokyo. From 2004 onward, two bilevel Green cars were inserted into all E231-1000 series ten-car sets.\n\n\n\nOriginally, 46 ten-car sets (Sets B1-42, B57, B80-82) were based at Mitaka Depot for use on Chūō-Sōbu Line services, replacing the earlier 103 and 201 series fleet. Sets B1 to B42 were delivered between February 2000 and November 2001. Set B57 was delivered in November 2002. Sets 80 to 82 were delivered between October and November 2006. The first sets entered service on 13 March 2000. These sets each include one \"six-door\" SaHa E230 car (car 5).\n\nOriginally, 17 ten-car sets (101 to 117) and 19 five-car sets (121 to 139) were based at Matsudo Depot for use on Jōban Line services between Ueno and Toride, and also Narita Line services to Narita, replacing the earlier 103 series fleet. The fleet was delivered between November 2001 and February 2005, with the first trains entering service on 3 March 2002.\n\nIn 2015, cars from former Mitaka Depot-based sets B20-B22 were reformed and transferred to the Jōban Line to form two more ten-car sets (118 and 119), bringing the total to 19 ten-car sets.\n\nIn October 2017, cars from former Mitaka Depot-based sets B22 and B5 were reformed as an eight-car set renumbered MU2. This entered service on the Musashino Line in November 2017.\n\nAs E231-500 trains from the Yamanote Line replace the E231-0 trains on the Chūō-Sōbu Line, these trains will be reformed and reallocated as Musashino Line and Hachiko/Kawagoe Line (E231-3000) trains. The six-door cars will be scrapped while six E231-0 series trains will be reformed and remain on the Chūō-Sōbu Line.\n\nThe first reformed E231-0 series Chūō-Sōbu Line train (with 6 motored cars and no six-door car), numbered set B11 and composed of 8 cars of former set B11 and 2 cars of former set B5, completed refurbishment on 24 April 2018 and was entered into service on 21 May 2018. The last non-reformed trains (with 4 motored cars and a six-door car), sets B80 and B82, were removed from service after 13 March 2020.\n\n\n, six ten-car sets are based at Mitaka depot in Tokyo and formed as shown below with six motored (\"M\") cars and four non-powered trailer (\"T\") cars.\n\n, 19 ten-car sets are based at Matsudo depot in Chiba Prefecture and formed as shown below with four motored (\"M\") cars and six non-powered trailer (\"T\") cars.\n\n, 19 five-car sets are based at Matsudo depot in Chiba Prefecture and formed as shown below with two motored (\"M\") cars and three non-powered trailer (\"T\") cars.\n\n, 27 eight-car sets are based at Keiyō Depot and formed as shown below with four motored (\"M\") cars and four non-powered trailer (\"T\") cars.\n\n\nA fleet of 52 11-car E231-500 series was delivered from January 2002 to April 2005 for use on Yamanote Line services, replacing the earlier 205 series fleet. The first trains entered service on 21 April 2002. These trains include D-ATC digital automatic train control, and feature pairs of LCD passenger information screens above each door internally. These screens also show advertisements.\n\nEach 11-car set originally contained two six-door SaHa E230 trailer cars (cars 7 and 10) with six pairs of doors per side and bench seats that were folded up until 10 a.m. on weekdays to provide standing room only during the morning peak. From 22 February 2010, the seats were able to be used during the morning peak. The two six-door cars in each set were subsequently replaced by a new build of four-door trailer cars between February 2010 and August 2011, to standardize door spacing ahead of the introduction of platform doors on all Yamanote Line stations by 2017.\n\nThe new SaHa E231-600 cars (new car 7) incorporated some elements from the newer E233 series (most notably seats and handrails). Meanwhile, the new SaHa E231-4600 cars (new car 10) were built almost fully to E233 series standards; they also have an irregular door spacing corresponding to the driving cars of Keihin-Tohoku Line E233-1000 series sets, which occasionally have to share the same platforms during engineering work. This results in interior seating arranged 3-7-7-5-4, instead of the normal 3-7-7-7-3 arrangement.

Its primary mission is to collect and preserve specimens from the Western Cordillera and Great Plains but collections span a wider taxonomic and geographic range.\n\nAbout 60% of the 120,000 vascular plant specimens are from Montana itself, a state with diverse plant communities, including Great Plains prairies, Great Basin sagebrush steppes, boreal forests, Northern Rockies alpine communities, and the eastern limit of the moist conifer forests of the Pacific Northwest. The non-Montana collections include many duplicate specimens from Wyoming, Idaho, Utah and Nevada.\n\nThe herbarium has a rich history, and its vascular plant collection represents over 100 years of botanical research in Montana, with hundreds of specimens from important early collectors, including C. Bessey, F. D. Kelsey, Marcus Jones and W. N. Suksdorf. That said, however, its greatest strength lies in more recent collections. Over 20,000 (28%) of the Montana vascular plant specimens were collected in the past 30 years by Prof. Klaus Lackschewitz or Peter Lesica. These newer specimens have location data accurate to the nearest square mile, making them a particularly useful resource for ecological and biogeographical studies.\n\n"}

It was established in 1813 by a charter signed by Mayor Philip Schuyler Van Rensselaer and the city council of Albany. In July 2007, the once separate Albany Academy and Albany Academy for Girls merged into The Albany Academies. Both schools retain much of their pre-merger tradition and character and each continues to give diplomas under its own name. Tuition ranges from $13,500 for Preschool, up to $23,100 for grade 12.\n\nThe Albany Academy is the oldest boys day school in the New York Capital Region, chartered in March 1813 to educate the sons of Albany's political elite and rapidly growing merchant class. In the Census three years prior, Albany was the tenth-largest city in the United States, and would remain so through the 1850s due to the prominence of the Erie Canal.\n\nClasses began within months after the charter was granted, offering a college preparatory track (including intensive study of Ancient Greek, and Latin) and an arithmetic-based track to prepare young men for Albany's role as a center of commerce. Two years later, in 1815, a purpose-built building was completed in present-day Academy Park, adjacent to the New York State Capitol. The Federal-style building, now known as the Old Academy and headquarters of the City School District of Albany, was designed by renowned Albany architect Philip Hooker. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its architectural significance and role as home to scientist Joseph Henry's laboratory.\n\nIn 1870, in response to a lack of military preparation institutions in the north during the American Civil War, the Albany Academy adopted the Battalion Leadership Program, instructing the \"cadets\" in military procedure and the art of leadership. In 2005 the school ended compulsory involvement in the program in favor of a House-based leadership program commonly found in English preparatory schools. The four houses, named for prominent historical Academy figures (Beck, Gates, Henry, and Olcott), compete against one another in the fields of academics, athletics, community service, and extracurricular involvement for honor and special privileges awarded to the leading house.\n\nIn 1931, the school moved from its original downtown building in present-day Academy Park to its current location on the corner of Hackett Boulevard and Academy Road, in the University Heights section of Albany. Designed by Marcus T. Reynolds in the neo-Georgian style, the building incorporates many elements of the Old Academy building, namely the main entryway and cupola. The school stands approximately two miles from the city center, allowing students access to the resources of the State University of New York at Albany, Russell Sage College, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, the state capitol, and the state museum and library. The red-brick Academy building's marble cornerstone was laid by the then governor and future president Franklin D. Roosevelt. All grades enrolled in The Albany Academy are housed under the same roof, a point of pride for the Academy Community.\n\nIn 2005, The Albany Academy ended its long standing Army JROTC program. This decision came due to declining enrollment among other factors. Certain military aspects are still available to students, but are all \"electives.\"\n\nIn July 2007, the board of trustees announced that the decision had been made that The Albany Academy and Albany Academy for Girls would merge into The Albany Academies. Enrollment at The Albany Academy had dropped from 479 students in the 2000–2001 school year, to a low of 340 students in 2005. Single-gender education continues under the present form in Lower and Middle Schools, while Upper School students may continue to cross-register for coed classes and certain extracurricular activities.\n\nOn July 1, 2009, the board of trustees announced the appointment of Douglas M. North AA'58, president of Alaska Pacific University, to the position of head of school of The Albany Academies, effective July 2010.\n\nThe main academic building houses 40 classrooms, two libraries, Mac and Windows computer labs, the cafeteria (called the Buttery), the school book store, the auditorium (known as Caird Chapel), the Wellness Center, the Black Box Theater, a darkroom, the Joseph Henry Science Wing, student and faculty lounges, board rooms, art and music studios, the school's archives, and various administrative offices. The school's athletic facilities include 11 team locker-rooms, 1 soccer/lacrosse field, 1 baseball diamond, 1 football field, the 400-meter Robison Track, the Robison Hockey Arena (formerly home to the Albany Cougars, a special needs hockey team who now play at the Albany County Hockey Facility), 6 outdoor tennis courts, the 6-lane, Standish Pool, the Rea Fitness Center, 2 indoor gymnasiums, 2 squash courts, conference rooms, long- and high-jump pits, a discus court, and a shot-put court. Other on-campus facilities include Leonard House, the head of school's residence.\n\nDrawn predominately from a six-county area and from within a radius of , the student body is ethnically, religiously, and economically diverse. The total 2019-2020 school population is 438 boys, including 86 in the Lower School, 100 in the Middle School, and 252 in the Upper School. There is a total of six countries represented in the school. Students are encouraged to actively participate in all aspects of school life; they are expected to conduct themselves responsibly and treat each other and their teachers with respect. Students are responsible for upholding school rules. The Albany Academy adheres to a school-wide honor code. Student Council members, especially seniors, occupy important leadership positions at Albany Academy. Its Leadership Development Program prepares students to hold leadership positions at school and beyond by providing formal classes on leadership, advising/student mentoring, community service, and involvement in co-curricular programs—all within the structure of a British-modeled House System.\n\nThe Albany Academies are accredited by the New York State Association of Independent Schools and recognized by the Regents of the State of New York.\n\nThe Albany Academies are a member of the following associations: the College Board, the Cum Laude Society, the National Association of Independent Schools, the Educational Records Bureau, the Capital Region Independent Schools Association, the Association of Boys' Schools, the Secondary Schools Admission Test Board, and the New England Prep School Athletic Association.\n\nNoted alumni include nine U.S. Congressmen, five Professional Athletes, three College Presidents, two Poets Laureate, one U.S. Supreme Court Justice, and one Medal of Honor recipient:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoted former faculty and administration include inventors, politicians, and seven College Presidents, including four presidents of Amherst College:\n\n\n\n"}

While still at school, he learned how to play the acoustic guitar and, by the time he was 17, he had acquired a used 1960s Fender Stratocaster, which was to become a regular instrument. Many of his musical influences, including Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck, were also associated with this instrument.\n\nScott formed a band with people he had met at school but quickly found work with better-known bands such as \"Bowser Moon\", The Handley Page Group and Zingo, playing about 300 shows a year in the then lucrative nightclub scene.\n\nBryan Adams has described Scott as \"the most underrated guitarist ever\". Scott was introduced to Adams in Ontario in the summer of 1976. As the 1970s were coming to an end, he started doing some recording work for the then-unknown Adams. This proved successful and within a year Scott was touring with Adams. They have been together on stage ever since.\n\nWriting for \"Premier Guitar\", Nashville bassist and producer Victor Brodén wrote: \"Keith Scott [...] is an endless source of inspiration for me. His solos are immediate. And anyone is able to sing them after just one or two listens. He plays the most simple, hooky, major-scale melodies, mixes them with a little blues to make them slightly dirty, and then finishes it all off with a right-hand attack and intent that floors me.\" Brodén added: \"I try to craft my bass lines like Keith crafts guitar solos.\"\n\nThe Gretsch company produced a \"Keith Scott Nashville Gold Top\" signature guitar, to Scott's specifications.\n\n"}

She was 13 years old in 1913 when her parents, David and Bessie () Itzkowitz, brought her to the United States. Her name was changed upon entering the country to Ida Rhodes.\n\nRhodes was awarded the New York State Cash Scholarship and a Cornell University Tuition Scholarship and began studying mathematics at Cornell University only six years after coming to the United States, from 1919–1923. During her time at Cornell University she worked as a nurse's aid at Ithaca City Hospital. She was elected to the honorary organizations Phi Beta Kappa (1922) and Phi Kappa Phi (1923). \nShe received her BA in mathematics in February, 1923 and her MA in September of the same year, graduating Phi Beta Kappa.\n\nRhodes had her first encounter with Albert Einstein in 1922 and encountered him again in 1936 at Princeton, where a group of mathematicians traveled to spend the weekend in informal seminars. \nShe later studied at Columbia University in 1930–31. She held numerous positions involving mathematical computations before she joined the Mathematical Tables Project in 1940, where she worked under Gertrude Blanch, whom she would later credit as her mentor.\n\nIda Rhodes was a pioneer in the analysis of systems of programming, and with Betty Holberton designed the C-10 programming language in the early 1950s for the UNIVAC I. She also designed the original computer used for the Social Security Administration. In 1949, the Department of Commerce awarded her a Gold Medal for \"significant pioneering leadership and outstanding contributions to the scientific progress of the Nation in the functional design and the application of electronic digital computing equipment\".\n\nThough she retired in 1964, Rhodes continued to consult for the Applied Mathematics Division of the National Bureau of Standards until 1971. Her work became much more widely known after her retirement, as she took the occasion to travel around the globe, lecturing and maintaining international correspondence. In 1976, the Department of Commerce presented her with a further Certificate of Appreciation on the 25th Anniversary of UNIVAC I, and then at the 1981 Computer Conference cited her a third time as a \"UNIVAC I pioneer.\" She died in 1986.\n\nIn an unusual case of an old specialized algorithm still in use, and still credited to the original developer, Rhodes was responsible for the \"Jewish Holiday\" algorithm used in calendar programs to this day. While at the National Bureau of Standards (now NIST), she also did original work in machine translation of natural languages.\n\n"}

The village is on The Far North railway line but trains stopped calling at the village in 1960. The railway station is now a private house.\n\nThe village is within the parish of Watten, which has the parish of Bower to the north, that of Wick to the east, that of Latheron to the south and that of Halkirk to the west.\n\nLoch Watten is the largest body of water in Caithness. The name of the village and loch appear to come from the Old Norse \"Vatn\", meaning water or lake, and the loch is famous for its brown trout fishing. The local public house is also named \"The Brown Trout\" after the local produce.\n\nA military camp was built in Watten during World War II, in early 1943, and at the end of the war this became POW Camp 165. This had been described as \"Britain's most secretive prisoner of war camp\" because many prominent Nazis were moved there from POW Camp 21 at Comrie in Perthshire. These prisoners included Gunter d'Alquen, Himmler's chief propagandist, leading U-boat captain Otto Kretschmer, dubbed the \"Wolf of the Atlantic\", and SS-Sturmbannführer Max Wünsche, one of Hitler's top aides. The camp closed in 1948.\n\nWatten was the birthplace of Alexander Bain, inventor of a type of pendulum-regulated electric clock and the fax machine. Bain is commemorated by a carved stone monument outside the village hall. The fax machine is referred to on this monument as \"The Electric Printing Telegraph\".\n"}

He grew up in Kansas City, MO from the age of 10 and also lived in San Diego, California during his teenage years. As of 2016, he resides in New York City.\n\nEldar began playing the piano when he was three years old. The first piece he remembers learning was \"C Jam Blues\". He later took classical lessons and was \"discovered\" at age 9 by the late New York City jazz aficionado Charles McWhorter, who saw him play at a festival in Siberia. The family relocated to Kansas City, drawn there in large part by the city's jazz history. During his Kansas City years, even before reaching his teens, Eldar already started building a reputation as a child prodigy, appearing on Marian McPartland's NPR show, \"Piano Jazz\", when he was only 12 years old, being the youngest performer to appear on her show. Eldar attended Interlochen Center for the Arts in his young teenage years. Eldar attended St. Elizabeth's grade school and the Barstow School in Kansas City. Eventually, the family moved to San Diego where he attended the Francis W. Parker School (San Diego), and then to the Los Angeles area where he attended University of Southern California's Thornton School of Music. Eldar's playing style is characterized by prodigious technique and musicality. \"Downbeat\" noted in a review by Bob Doershuk: \"his command of the instrument is beyond staggering.\" He was signed to Sony Music at 18 and released 5 albums. One of the albums was nominated for a Grammy. Eldar has extensively toured throughout Europe, Asia, North America.\n\nEldar has been variously compared to Art Tatum, Oscar Peterson, Herbie Hancock and more; yet he also seems to absorb harmonic expansiveness from McCoy Tyner and at times the lyrical sensitivity from Bill Evans. Eldar performed at Grammy Awards telecast and was honored the first time in many years as a jazz artist.

After the decline of the Zirids in Ifriqiya as a result of the invasion of the Banu Hilal (since 1051), An-Nasir was able to extend the influence of the Hammadids in the Maghreb. Vassals were installed in Tunis and territory as far as Kairouan came under control. Influence was also built up in the northern Sahara by driving out the Ibadi from Sadrata (1077). With the establishment of Bejaia as a second capital, maritime trade gained importance for the economy. Italian architects and craftsmen were enlisted in the construction of Bejaia. The extensive control of the trade routes led to economic growth and a flourishing of the kingdom. \n\nHowever, the stability of the realm was precarious, since the Bedouin Banu Hilal began to infiltrate the Hammadid state after their conquest of Ifriqiya.

This transferred force to the shoulder, which allowed a longer-lasting and comfortable grip, especially with larger heavier loads. Particularly in cartoons, the bindles' sacks usually have a polka-dot or bandanna design. However, in actual use the bindle can take many forms.\n\nOne example of the stick-type bindle can be seen in the illustration entitled \"The Runaway\" created by Norman Rockwell for the cover of the September 20, 1958, edition of \"The Saturday Evening Post\".\n\nThough bindles are rarely used anymore, they are still widely seen in popular culture as a prevalent anachronism.\n\nThe term bindle may descend from the German word \"Bündel\", meaning something wrapped up in a blanket and bound by cord for carrying (\"cf.\" originally Middle Dutch \"bundle\"), or have arisen as a portmanteau of \"bind\" and \"spindle\".\n\nMore recently, the term has come to be used to define packages of illegal drugs, particularly heroin, in which it typically refers to ten single 'bags' bound together with a rubber band, although this is more commonly called a \"bundle\".\n\n"}

The service is funded by the municipal tax base, and operates similarly to other municipal divisions, such as the Toronto Parks, Forestry & Recreation division, or the Toronto Water division, but retains operational independence from other divisions. While under municipal government control, it is subject to provincial legislation and licensing. It is not the only service provider in its area; private-for-profit medical transport services also provide routine, non-emergency transports and coverage for special events, but the statutory emergency medical system is the only provider permitted to service emergency calls.\n\nThe City of Toronto has operated an ambulance service directly on an uninterrupted basis since 1883, when the City of Toronto Health Department acquired two ambulances to transport those with infectious diseases to the local sanitarium. Full-time emergency ambulance service began in 1888, with the provision of emergency ambulance service by the Toronto Police Force, which eventually operated four horse-drawn vehicles. Prior to these two municipal initiatives, ambulance service was provided for the young city by a variety of means, including both hospital-based and private companies. This 'broad spectrum' approach to service delivery would continue for more than ninety years.\n\nToronto may very well be able to claim to have the first formally trained 'ambulance attendants' in North America, with the Toronto Police Force ambulance service staff receiving five days of formal training in their jobs from the St. John Ambulance Brigade in 1889. Training included first aid skills, anatomy and physiology. Such training for ambulance attendants was unheard of at that time, outside of military circles. The police constables assigned to the ambulance also did regular policing, when not required for ambulance calls. As the city grew and technology progressed, so did the ambulance service. The first motorized ambulance was actually purchased by a local funeral home in 1911, and the Toronto Police Ambulance Service began the conversion from horse-drawn to motorized vehicles in 1913, with the process largely completed by 1918. Over the years, the two City of Toronto departments would have their services supplemented by more than 130 individual ambulance operators, most of them private companies, and in suburban areas by several of the tiny, local fire departments. The two municipal services would finally be merged in 1933, when the Toronto Police Department turned the operation of their ambulances over to the Department of Public Health, and ended their involvement in the City's ambulance service.\n\nThis service would grow again in 1953, as the result of the creation of the municipality of Metropolitan Toronto, dramatically expanding the required service area. Service would continue in this fashion until 1967, when the amalgamated City's suburban fire departments surrendered their ambulances, resulting in the evolution of the Department of Public Health Ambulance Service into the City-operated Department of Emergency Services (DES). Some private companies, and one operated by the provincial government, would continue to operate in 'Metro' Toronto until 1975, although with centralized dispatch services provided by DES.\n\nThe Metropolitan Toronto Department of Ambulance Services was created in 1975, and absorbed the five remaining private ambulance companies and single provincial service, providing a single, unified ambulance service in Metro Toronto. Known colloquially as \"Metro Toronto Ambulance\" or simply \"Metro Ambulance\" (although never its official name) the service provided ambulance services from 1975 to 1998.\n\nMetropolitan Toronto was restructured during 1998, transforming it from a regional government overseeing six member municipalities into a single, unified city, and many municipal and regional services were restructured as a result. Metro Ambulance became Toronto Ambulance then Toronto Emergency Medical Services in order to reflect its evolving role from primarily a provider of medical transportation to an actual provider of medical care.\n\nThe service introduced its first paramedics in 1984 (although experiments in pre-hospital advanced life support actually began in 1969). Toronto EMS introduced many other innovations, including the concept of dedicated ground-based critical care transport ambulances, as well as many specialty support units described in this article, many of which were originally conceived and pioneered by the service.\n\nAs of April 2005, the departments and commissioners were replaced by divisions under the City Manager (and Deputy Managers). Toronto EMS now operates under the city's Emergency Medical Services Division. It is the largest municipal EMS operation in Canada.\n\nOn July 2014, Chief Paul Raftis announced that as part of a rebranding effort, Toronto EMS will change its name to Toronto Paramedic Services. The change follows a national trend and drive for the adoption of Paramedic as the publicly recognized title for prehospital emergency care providers. On October 1, the new name came to effect.\n\nUniforms consist of:\n\n\nOf the 242 vehicles in the Toronto Paramedic Services fleet, 150 are CMVSS / Ontario Standard Type III ambulances. Of these, approximately 100 are in service at any time on a typical, mid-week, day shift. These vehicles are currently supplied by Crestline Coach Ltd. . They are mounted on Chevrolet Express van chassis with boxes custom built by Crestline to suit the needs of the service. The department currently employs Chevrolet Tahoe SUVs for First Response and supervisory vehicles as well as an assortment of fully equipped but unmarked vehicles (Primarily Dodge Caravan and Ford Taurus) for senior management. Toronto Paramedic Services currently operates a fleet of custom built busses and equipment support vehicles for use during mass-casualty or large-scale events. Toronto Paramedic Services operates its own repair facilities, located at the service's Headquarters complex. All maintenance and repair work (with the exception of body work), and all equipment, radio, and medical electronics maintenance and repairs are performed on site by service staff.\n\n2006 Orion Vii\n\nToronto Paramedic Services has 1,207 members including paramedics and other support staff. These are categorized as follows:\n\n\nThe total number of paramedics is 887.\n\n\nToronto Paramedic Services operates its own Communications and System Control Centre (called a Central Ambulance Communications Center or CACC \"Kaack\"), including emergency medical dispatch, patient distribution and system oversight. Toronto Paramedic Services participates in the community-wide 9-1-1 system, and triages emergency calls using the Advanced Medical Priority Dispatch System. The system uses Computer-Aided Dispatch, including Tritech VisiCAD, augmented by PDS and Optima Live software and technology. The service utilizes a satellite-based Automatic Vehicle Locating system in order to ensure that the closest appropriate response resource is consistently sent to each emergency call; all emergency response resources are included. The service utilizes a 700 mHz P25 Phase II trunking radio system for dispatch purposes. The Control Centre has direct landline contact with the 9-1-1 Center, all other emergency services, all acute care hospitals, and all Paramedic Stations. The service utilizes “Language Line” service to provide instant simultaneous translation of emergency calls in more than 140 languages. Toronto Paramedic Services operates the largest EMS Communications Centre in Canada, which was recently accredited as an International Centre of Excellence by the International Academy of Emergency Dispatch.\n\nService is provided to a residential population of approximately 3.2 million people, which rises to approximately 5 million on most business days.\n\nToronto Paramedic Services operates a total of 41 stations, geographically distributed across the of the City of Toronto. Emergency service headquarters (which is shared with Toronto Fire Services, but both services operate independently) is located at 4330 Dufferin Street in Toronto. This facility includes administrative offices, some education facilities, the Communications Centre, Fleet Maintenance, Planning and Operational Support, and Materials Management/Logistics. The service is supplemented by well-developed Paramedic Services in neighbouring communities on three sides, with Lake Ontario providing the southern boundary of the service area. Air ambulance operations are provided within the City of Toronto by Ornge, a privately owned air ambulance contractor, under contract to the Government of Ontario.\n\nBased upon information provided by Toronto Paramedic Services, the service processed in excess of 535,000 calls through its Control Centre in 2007 (the most recent year for which complete data is available), resulting in 223,769 emergency calls being dispatched. Using the AMPDS system, which triages calls by severity for dispatch purposes, the actual dispatch volume by category for that same year was:\n\nThe District 1 Hub is located at 01 Station (1300 Wilson Ave). The Northwest quadrant is bounded roughly by Steeles Avenue to the north, Eglinton Avenue to the south, Yonge Street to the east, and Highway 427 & Mississauga border to the west.\n\nThe District 2 Hub is located at 20 Station (2430 Lawrence Ave E). The Northeast quadrant is bounded roughly by Steeles Avenue to the north, Eglinton Avenue to the south, the Scarborough-Pickering Townline and Rouge River to the east, and Yonge Street to the west.\n\nThe District 3 Hub is located at 30 Station (100 Turnberry Ave). The Southwest quadrant is bounded roughly by Eglinton Avenue to the north, Lake Ontario to the south, Yonge Street to the east, and Etobicoke Creek to the west. \n\nThe District 4 Hub is located at 42 Station (1535 Kingston Rd). The Southeast quadrant is bounded roughly by Eglinton Avenue to the north, Lake Ontario to the south and east, and Yonge Street to the west. \n\nThe District 5 Hub is located at 55 Station (5700 Bathurst St). District 5 has stations in multiple quadrants and is responsible for Toronto Paramedic Services’ special operations teams, which include: Response Units, Critical Care Transport Unit (CCTU), CBRNE, ETF, Bike Unit, and Emergency Support Units.\n\nIn addition to regular operations, Toronto Paramedic Services staffs a Special Operations Division, tasked with the provision of Paramedic services in unusual circumstances. The elements of this unit include:\n\n\nToronto Paramedic Services operates in a system of universal health care, with no one being refused care because they cannot afford it. As a direct result, hospital in-patient beds and Emergency Departments tend to be severely overcrowded, resulting in difficulties for paramedics transferring the care of their patients to hospital staff in a timely manner. Two- to four-hour delays in the transfer of care are commonplace, and six- to eight-hour delays are not unheard of. When this occurs, the service's ability to provide service to emergency calls in a timely manner will often degrade, because of decreased unit availability. Multiple stakeholders and various levels of government are currently seeking solutions to this problem, but have, so far, experienced only limited success.\n\nThe funding for Toronto Paramedic Services occurs as a result of a mixed formula, with fifty percent of funding coming from the municipal tax base and fifty percent from the provincial government. The funding of Toronto Paramedic Services is based upon its census population, not its business day population. As a result, there are always more people requiring EMS services than the system has been funded for.\n\nLanguage barriers and cultural misperceptions in Toronto's multicultural landscape are commonplace for Toronto's paramedics. The service subscribes to Language Line, a simultaneous telephone-based translation service which operates in more than 140 languages. This service is used by Emergency Medical Dispatchers processing 9-1-1 calls, or by paramedics treating patients in the field, on a daily basis. The service also operates its own ethnocultural access program.\n\nThe 'Baby Boom' generation is aging. As it does so, all of those 'boomers' become net consumers of health care, driving up demand for services. Simultaneously, all of those 'boomers' employed by the service in the early 1970s are reaching the end of their careers and retiring. Since subsequent generations are typically much smaller, the service is experiencing difficulty in recruiting suitably trained replacement staff, just as demand for services is increasing.\n\nOver the years, the presence of such a large system and call volume, along with a commitment to consistently capture high quality data, has permitted Toronto EMS to become a 'test-bed' for research projects involving both EMS and emergency medicine. This has resulted in a service which is extremely research-oriented and interested in outcome-based medicine. While this has provided any number of research opportunities for physicians and emergency medicine residents through the Toronto Base Hospital program, it has also permitted paramedics to function as supporting and as lead researchers, and in some cases, as the principal researcher of their own projects. All research conducted at Toronto EMS is pre-approved by the University of Toronto Research Ethics Committee, and the findings of research conducted at Toronto EMS, by both physicians and paramedics, has been published in respected, peer-reviewed, international journals.\n\nToronto paramedics are heavily involved in various community programs and partnerships. Toronto's paramedics are active participants in the community which they serve. At the 'grass roots' level, Toronto's paramedics and EMDs fund a children's breakfast club, ensuring a nutritious breakfast for the children who live in several of the city's housing projects. Paramedics also participate in a variety of other events in the community, including their enthusiastic (and occasionally successful) participation in the dragon boat races staged annually by the city's Chinese community. As another little known fact of community involvement by paramedics, all of the floats in the city's annual Santa Claus Parade (one of North America's largest), are driven by volunteers from Toronto Paramedic Services, including both paramedics and a variety of other staff.\n\nParamedicine in Canada\n\nEmergency Services in Toronto\n\nEmployee association \n"}

The opening titles showed an elderly David Lloyd George walking through the Welsh countryside near Criccieth remembering his Uncle Lloyd baptising the young David George (later Lloyd George) in a mountain stream.\n\nThe series is in 9 hourly parts covering most of the major events of Lloyd George's life from his birth in Manchester in January 1863 until his death in 1945 in Llanystumdwy. The major events of Lloyd George's life are covered in the production including his personal life, specifically the running of two families. The duration of Lloyd George's political career, of over 54 years, combined with the length of the series means that certain periods of history have been skirted over. This is particularly the case with the various Liberal Party splits from 1918 onwards. The historical consultant for the series was the historian A. J. P. Taylor. \n"}

Putin was due to step down as President, after serving two terms, and the Committee intended to work against the election of the Kremlin's chosen successor, whoever that might be.

It is a specific tool used in firemaking.\n\nIn early times, percussion firemaking was often used to start fires. Before the advent of steel, a variety of iron pyrite or marcasite was used with flint and other stones to produce a high-temperature spark that could be used to create fire. There are indications that the \"Iceman\" called Ötzi may have used iron pyrite to make fire.\n\nFrom the Iron Age forward, until the invention of the friction match (ca. 1830), the use of flint and steel was a common method of firelighting. Percussion fire-starting was prevalent in Europe during ancient times, the Middle Ages and the Viking Age.\n\nWhen flint and steel were used, the fire steel was often kept in a metal tinderbox together with flint and tinder. In Tibet and Mongolia, they were instead carried in a leather pouch called a chuckmuck.\n\nIn Japan, percussion firemaking was performed using agate or quartz. It was also used as a ritual to bring good luck or ward off evil.\n\nThe type and hardness of steel used is important. High carbon steels (1060, W1, tool steels, etc.) generate sparks easily. Iron and alloys (like stainless steel, 5160, etc.) is more difficult and generates fewer sparks. The steel must be hardened but softer than the flint-like material scraping off the spark. Old files, leaf and coil springs, and rusty gardening tools are common, re-purposed sources of strikers.\n\nBesides flint, many other hard, non-porous rocks can be used, that can take a sharp edge, such as chert, quartz, agate, jasper or chalcedony.\n\nThe sharp edge of the flint is used to violently strike the fire steel at an acute angle in order to cleave or shave off small particles of metal. The pyrophoricity of the steel results in the shavings oxidising in the air. The molten, oxidizing sparks ignite the fine tinder. Tinder is best held next to the flint and the steel striker quickly slid down against the flint, casting sparks into the tinder. Charcloth or amadou (\"tinder fungus\") is often used to catch the low-temperature sparks, which can then can be brought to other, heavier tinder and blown into flame.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2211969", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2211969", "title": "Administrative centre", "text": "Administrative centre\n\nAn administrative centre is a seat of regional administration or local government, or a county town, or the place where the central administration of a commune is located.\n\nIn countries which have French as one of their administrative languages (such as Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland or many African countries) and in some other countries (such as Italy, cf. cognate \"capoluogo\"), a chef-lieu (, plural form \"chefs-lieux\" (literally \"chief place\" or \"head place\"), is a town or city that is pre-eminent from an administrative perspective. The ‘f’ in chef-lieu is pronounced, in contrast to chef-d'oeuvre where it is mute. \n\nThe capital of an Algerian Province is called a chef-lieu. The capital of a district, the next largest division, is also called a chef-lieu. While the capital of the lowest division, the municipalities, is called agglomeration de chef-lieu (chef-lieu agglomeration) and is abbreviated as A.C.L.\n\nThe chef-lieu in Belgium is the administrative centre of each of the ten Provinces of Belgium. Three of these cities also give their name to their province (Antwerp, Liège and Namur).\n\nLuxembourg is divided into two judicial arrondissements (Luxembourg City, Diekirch), three administrative districts (Luxembourg City, Diekirch, Grevenmacher), four electoral circonscriptions (constituencies), twelve cantons and one hundred and five communes (municipalities; Luxembourgish: \"Gemengen\").\n\nArrondissements, districts and cantons have each a chef-lieu and are named after it. The same is true for each commune which is composed of more than one town or village. Usually (with a few exceptions), the commune is named after the communal chef-lieu.\n\nThe chef-lieu of a département is known as the \"préfecture\". This is the town or city where the prefect of the départment (and all services under his/her control) is situated, in a building known as the prefecture. In every French region, one of the départments has pre-eminence over the others, and the prefect carries the title of \"Prefect of region X…, Prefect of Department Z…\" and the city where the regional prefect is found is known as \"chef-lieu of the region\" or, more commonly, \"Regional prefecture\". The services are, however, controlled by the prefecture of the départment. \n\nThe chef-lieu of an arrondissement, commonly known as the \"sous-préfecture\" is the city or town where the sub-prefect of the arrondissement (and the services directly under his/her control) is situated, in a building called the sub-prefecture. The arrondissement where the département prefecture is located does not normally have a sub-prefect or sub-prefecture, the administration being devolved usually to the \"Secretary-general of the departmental prefecture\", who functions as sub-prefect for the arrondissement. \n\nThe chef-lieu of a canton is usually the biggest city or town within the canton, but has only a nominal role. No specific services are controlled by it. In past decades, there was always a Gendarmerie, a treasurer and a justice of the peace. \n\nThe chef-lieu of a commune is the principal area of the town or city that gives the commune its name, the other areas of the town being called hamlets. French typographers will use a capital for the ‘Le’ or ‘La’ preceding the name of places having ‘chef-lieu of town’ status, and lowercase ‘le’ or ‘la’ for hamlets.\n\nIn the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, the administrative centres are known as \"chief towns\" or \"nahias\". Nahias may be in charge of a sub-district (\"qda\"), a district (\"liwa\"), or a governorate (\"muhafazah\").\n\nThe chef-lieu indicates the principal city of the provinces of New Caledonia. So Nouméa is the chef-lieu of South Province. But the chef-lieu can also mean the principal area within a town. So Wé is part of the town of Lifou, but is the chef-lieu of Lifou. In the Loyalty Islands and the other islands, the name of the chef-lieu differs from that of the name of the town. For the towns of the mainland, the chef-lieu has the same name as the town. Nouméa is a town composed only of Nouméa.\n\nMany of the West African states which gained independence from France in the mid-20th century also inherited the French administrative structure of Departments and Communes, headed by a \"Chief-Lieu\". States still using Chief-Lieu to identify the administrative headquarters of a government subdivision include Senegal, Burkina Faso, Benin, Mali, and Niger. \n\nTaking Niger and Mali as examples, the administrative subdivisions down to the Commune level each have a formal place of administrative headquarters, titled the chef-lieu. The larger portion of the terminology of administrative division is inherited from colonial rule as part of French West Africa, and has survived and been somewhat modified over time. In both nations there have been remarkably parallel histories. With the decentralization process begun in both nations in the 1990s, the chef-lieu has transitioned from the location of the Governor, Commandant, or Prefect and their staff, to the location of Commune, Cercles of Mali/Departments of Niger, and Regional Councils and a variety of decentralized bodies. The \"chefs-lieux\" of a Region, Cercle or Département, is usually also a Communal chef-lieu. Both nations collect these councils in a \"High Council of Collectivites\" seated at the nation's capital. Smaller sub-divisions in Mali's Communes (Villages, Tribal councils, Quarters) are administered from or identified as a \"Place\"/\"Site\" (\"Site\" in French), so the chef-lieu is literally the \"Chief-Place\" even at the lowest level.\n\nIn Russia, the term is applied to the inhabited localities, which serve as a seat of government of entities of various levels. The only exception to this rule is the republics, for which the term \"capital\" is used to refer to the seat of government. The capital of Russia is also an entity to which the term \"administrative centre\" does not apply. A similar arrangement exists in Ukraine.\n\nIn Sweden there are two levels of administrative centre; the local municipal and the regional county.\n\n\"Central locality\" \"(Swedish: \"centralort\")\" is a term commonly ascribed to the settlement that serves as a municipal administrative centre. This level handles the local administrative and political tasks of the surrounding settlements. Since central place theory was the guiding principle during the municipal reform 1962-1977, most municipalities were dominated by a larger urban area where the political seat was located. Most municipalities are named for their central locality, but there are several exceptions.\n\nThere are many deviations from the central locality principle. Some municipalities are dominated by two or more towns of similar size, and sometimes they share the municipal administration, with the municipality having its official address in one of the towns. For example, both Skillingaryd and Vaggeryd are central localities of Vaggeryd Municipality. Conversely, there are municipalities within metropolitan areas. For example, there are twenty-six municipalities within the Stockholm metropolitan area.\n\nThe term \"central locality\" has no legal standing and it is unclear how it should be applied to these municipalities. Some municipalities appointing one or several localities to be the central locality.\n\nA \"residence city\" (Swedish: \"residensstad\") is the town or city which is the political and administrative seat of the county. This level handles the more regional political and administrative tasks of the county, such as healthcare and public transport. The name comes from that this is the town or city where the governor \"(Swedish: \"landshövding\")\" have their residence. There are some exceptions to this, however. In the newer amalgamated \"greater counties\", often referred to as \"regions\", the administrative centre is placed in one of the older \"residence cities\". Examples of this is Malmö in Region Scania and Gothenburg in the Västra Götaland Region.\n\nThe term chef-lieu is applied to the capital of each Swiss canton. In 16 of the 26 cantons, the territory is subdivided into districts. Every district also has a city nominated as chef-lieu and each has a prefect.\n\nThe term chef-lieu is used to designate the capital of each gouvernorat (department). Each of the 24 gouvernorats is subdivided into delegations (districts) which each have a central city as chef-lieu of delegation.\n\nIn the United Kingdom it is the centre of a local authority, which is distinct from a historic county with a county town.\n\n\n"}

Examples include their work against trade deals such as TTIP, or highlighting how UK aid has been used.\n\nMuch of their research is aimed at attempting to demonstrate how corporation power, supported by governments, has an adverse effect on those living in poverty.\n\nIts aims are:\n\nGlobal Justice Now has a network of local groups as well as individual members, and an office in Edinburgh from which Global Justice Scotland is run. It participates in international networks such as the Our World is Not for Sale network on trade and corporate globalisation, and the World Social Forum.\n\nGlobal Justice Now has an associated charity, \"Global Justice Now Trust\", which funds Global Justice Now’s charitable activities.\n\nGlobal Justice Now started in 1969 as 'Action for World Development' (AWD). Many people who were involved in collecting one million signatures on a petition about world development had seen the need for political campaigning which charity law restricted development charities from undertaking. AWD was formally launched by aid agencies such as Oxfam and Christian Aid, and by churches.\n\nThe World Development Movement was formed in 1970, and extended the work of AWD but as a separate body with its own member groups to decide its policies and priorities. Its constitution was subsequently changed to allow individuals as well as local groups to become members.\n\nGlobal Justice Now was a co-founder of the Fairtrade Foundation in 1992, Jubilee 2000 in 1997, the Trade Justice Movement in 2000, and the 2005 anti-poverty mobilisation Make Poverty History.\n\nIn late 2006, Global Justice Now moved its London offices from Brixton to new premises at 66 Offley Road in Kennington, London.\n\nOn the 1st January 2015 the organisation was renamed to \"Global Justice Now\" as part of a wider relaunch.\n\nGlobal Justice Now is campaigning against TTIP, the proposed free trade agreement between the European Union and the United States. It argues that safety regulations, workers’ rights, environmental protection rules and food standards regulations are all threatened by TTIP.\n\nGlobal Justice Now considers climate change to be a climate justice issue. In 2009 they successfully campaigned to stop new coal-fired power stations in Kingsnorth, Kent and Hunterston in Ayrshire because the organisation considered any plans for new coal-fired power stations to be incompatible with plans to tackle climate change.\n\nFrom 2010 Global Justice Now ran a campaign on climate debt opposing the UK government's plans to give money in the form of climate loans to already heavily indebted poor countries in the global South.\n\nGlobal Justice Now entered into a controversial partnership agreement with Ecotricity from which they benefit financially whereby supporters who switch their energy supply to Ecotricity, leads to a payment of up to £60 to Global Justice Now. The owner of Ecotricity, Dale Vince is reported to employ aggressive tax avoidance strategies to minimise his tax obligations. This directly conflicts with Global Justice Now's Tax Justice campaigns to hold corporations to account so they pay their fair share of tax in the countries they operate in. Furthermore, Ecotricity employ G4S Utility Services for their meter reading services, a subsidiary of controversial multinational G4S that is widely reported to be involved in widespread human rights abuses. As a social justice organisation Global Justice Now were criticised for indirectly aiding and abetting human rights abuses as a result of their continued relationship with Ecotricity. In response to complaints about Ecotricity's use of G4S, Dale Vince gave assurances that he would end the contract with G4S Utility Services in 2014 and then reneged on his promise when Ecotricity announced it had renewed its contract with G4S Utility Services for another 4-year period from January 2016 to December 2020.\n\nGlobal Justice Now ended its partnership with Ecotricity in early 2016, following a review over concerns about their association with G4S. The organisation gave assurances that their partnership was set up at a time when Ecotricity were the most ethical option to promote to their supporters who were concerned about the environmental and climate impacts of their energy use. They also added that the termination of the partnership was not triggered by any complaints received nor was there any open or public criticism, as implied by this posting.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2211986", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2211986", "title": "Stockman (Australia)", "text": "Stockman (Australia)\n\nIn Australia a stockman (plural stockmen) is a person who looks after the livestock on a large property known as a station, which is owned by a grazier or a grazing company. A stockman may also be employed at an abattoir, feedlot, on a livestock export ship, or with a stock and station agency.\n\nStockmen who work with cattle in the Top End are known as \"ringers\" and are often only employed for the dry season which lasts from April to October. A \"station hand\" is an employee, who is involved in routine duties on a rural property or station and this may also involve caring for livestock, too. With pastoral properties facing dire recruitment problems as young men are lured into the booming mining industry, young women from the cities are becoming a common sight on outback stations, often attracted by the chance to work with horses. Some stations are now making changes for the employment of women by building female living quarters and installing hydraulic cattle crushes etc. An associated occupation is that of the drover, who, like the shearer may be an itinerant worker, and is employed in tending to livestock while they are travelling on a stock route. \n\nA station trainee is known as a jackaroo (male) or jillaroo (female), and does much the same work as a stockman.\n\nA stockman is responsible for the care for livestock and treatment of their injuries and illnesses. This includes feeding, watering, mustering, droving, branding, castrating, ear tagging, weighing, vaccinating livestock and dealing with their predators. Stockmen need to be able to judge age by examining the dentition (teeth) of cattle, sheep and occasionally horses. Those caring for sheep will regularly have to deal with flystrike treatments, jetting animals, worm control and lamb marking. Pregnant livestock usually receive special care in late pregnancy and stockmen may have to deal with dystocia (abnormal or difficult birth or labour). A good stockman is aware of livestock behavioural characteristics, and has an awareness of flight zone distances of the livestock being handled. Apart from livestock duties a stock person will inspect, maintain and repair fences, gates and yards that have been broken by storms, fallen trees, livestock and wildlife. \n\nA \"head stockman\" is responsible for a number of workers and a range of livestock and property operations including the supervision of operations that includes feeding, mating, managing artificial breeding and embryo transfer programs; managing vehicle and equipment maintenance; repair and maintenance of property structures; supervising and training of staff.\n\nMustering is done with horses or vehicles including all-terrain vehicles (ATV), and some of the large cattle stations use helicopters or light aircraft to assist in the mustering and surveillance of livestock and their watering points. Cattle mustering in the Outback and the eastern ‘Falls’ country of the Great Dividing Range often necessitates days camping out in isolated areas and sleeping in a swag (bedroll) on the ground with limited food choices. Damper is a traditional type of bread that was baked by stockmen during colonial times, or nowadays when the bread supply has been exhausted. It is made with self-raising flour, salt and water and is usually cooked in a camp oven over the embers of a fire. In these areas the days in the saddle are often very long as the cattle have to be mustered and then driven to yards or a paddock where they can be held. After the stock have been yarded they may then require drafting prior to branding, shearing or whatever procedures are required or have been planned.\n\nThe role of the mounted stockmen came into being early in the 19th century, when in 1813 the Blue Mountains separating the coastal plain of the Sydney region from the interior of the continent was crossed. The town of Bathurst was founded shortly after, and potential farmers moved westward, and settled on the land, many of them as squatters. The rolling country, ideal for sheep and the large, often unfenced, properties necessitated the role of the shepherd to tend the flocks. \n\nEarly stockmen were specially selected, highly regarded men owing to the high value and importance of early livestock. All stockmen need to be interested in animals, able to handle them with confidence and patience, able to make accurate observations about them and enjoy working outdoors.\n\nAustralian Aborigines were good stockmen who played a large part in the successful running of many stations. With their intimate bonds to their tribal places, and local knowledge they also took considerable pride in their work. After the gold rushes white labour was expensive and difficult to retain. Aboriginal women also worked with cattle on the northern stations after this practice developed in northern Queensland during the 1880s. A Native administration Act later stopped the employment of women in the cattle camps. Aborigines and their families received the regular provision of food and clothing to retain their labour, but were paid only a small wage. \n\nIn 1911, rural stockmen received only £1 to £1/5/- a week plus keep after a decision was made by the Arbitration Court. The award of 1918 increased wages by up to 50 per cent to a minimum of £2/13/-. Head stockmen received about £1 extra. Stockmen now work under a state or federal award, which is reviewed regularly.\n\nThe employment of mounted workers to tend livestock is necessitated in Australia by the large size of the \"properties\" which may be called sheep stations or cattle stations, depending upon the type of stock. In the inland regions of most states excluding Victoria and Tasmania, cattle stations may exceed 10,000 km² with the largest being Anna Creek Station at 24,000 km² (6,000,000 acres). \n\nStockmen traditionally ride horses, use working dogs and a stockwhip for stock work and mustering, but motorised vehicles are increasingly used. Sometimes the vehicles that are used are four-wheel drive (4WD) \"paddock-bashers\", which are often old unregistered utilities. These vehicles may also be modified by removing the top and fitting roll and bull bars for bull or buffalo catching. \n\nTransportable steel yards are now often carried on a truck to an area where stock-work can be completed without having to drive stock long distances to permanent yards. Stockmen and their horses can be unloaded at these yards and then the cattle can be branded and also transported from these yards if required. Lambs are also often marked in temporary yards as a means of reducing infection.\n\nThe traditional attire of a stockman or grazier is a felt Akubra hat; a double flapped, two pocket (for stock notebooks) cotton shirt; a plaited kangaroo skin belt carrying a stockman's pocket knife in a pouch; light coloured, stockman cut, moleskin trousers with brown elastic side boots. The moleskin trousers have now largely been replaced by jeans. The plaited belt is often replaced by a working stockman or ringer with a belt known as a Queensland Utility Strap which can be used as a belt, neck strap, lunch-time hobble or a tie for a \"micky\". This attire is still used in Australian Stock Horse competitions. Pocket knives may be used to castrate and/or earmark an animal, to bang cattle tails or in an emergency to cut free an animal entangled in a rope or horse tack. Specially designed and cut for riding, oilskin coats are used during wet weather. The horse typically wears a ringhead bridle, a saddle cloth, a leather Australian stock saddle, which may be equipped with a breastplate in steep country, and saddlebag and quart-pot.\n\nA number of equestrian sports are particularly associated with stockmen. These include campdrafting, team penning, tentpegging and polocrosse, as well as working dog trials. The sports are played in local and state competitions and are often a feature of agricultural shows such as the Sydney Royal Easter Show. Stockman challenges are also gaining in popularity across the eastern states of Australia. In this event competitors show their skills by whipcracking, packing a packhorse (to be led around a course), bareback obstacle course, cross country, shoeing and stock handling competing in a single Australian Stock Saddle. The best will compete in a final with a brumby catch and a second final section of a stock saddle buckjump ride where they have to mark out carrying a stockwhip, or a timed obstacle event.\n\nThe role of the stockmen has often been celebrated in various media, with the stockman being generally more highly renowned for his ability to bring down a bullock than an outlaw and for sharp wit rather than sharp shooting. \n\nTwo well-known songs commemorate the death of a stockman, the anonymous \"Wrap me up with my stockwhip and blanket\" and Rolf Harris's \"Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport\". \n\nThrough the 19th and early 20th centuries the writing of balladic poetry was a favoured form of literary expression, and the public recitation of such pieces remains a feature of Australian folk festivals. The majority of the most popular ballads deal with rural subject and many are specifically about stockmen. These works include Adam Lindsay Gordon's \"Bush Ballads and Galloping Rhymes\" which includes \"The Sick Stockrider\", and, most famously, Banjo Paterson's epic poem \"The Man from Snowy River\". \n\n\"The Man from Snowy River\" was to become the source of three movies, one in 1920, and another in 1982 to be followed by a sequel. A TV series followed called \"Banjo Paterson's The Man from Snowy River\".\n\nIn 2002 the story was shown as live musical theatre called \"\". The inspiration for this musical performance came from the Opening Ceremony of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, when the performance opened with 121 stockmen and women riding Australian Stock Horses in a tribute to the Australian pastoral heritage and the importance of the stock horse in Australia's heritage. The pastoral tribute took place to music written by Bruce Rowland, who composed a special Olympics version of the main theme for the 1982 movie \"\"The Man from Snowy River\"\". David Atkins and Ignatius Jones, who were the artistic creators of the opening ceremony of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, were also the co-creators of the musical, \"\". \n\nA further tribute to the stockman derives from the fact that for a number of years the promotions of the Sydney Royal Easter Show have referred to it as \"The Great Australian Muster\". \n\nIn Longreach, Queensland, Australia, a Museum and Memorial called the Australian Stockman's Hall of Fame was established to pay tribute to the pioneers of the Australian Outback.\n\n\n\n"}

As well as attracting around 4000 guests, the conference has historically included the largest evangelical student conference in Europe.\n\nWord Alive is billed as \"a Bible holiday week inspiring and refreshing the whole body\". There is a full adult programme throughout the day along with activities focussed for children and youth. There is also a specially tailored 'Student Track' conference which is one of the largest Christian student conferences in Europe. The Student Track joins the main programme for the morning Bible Readings, the centrepiece of Word Alive, during which the main speaker for the week gives an in-depth bible study. \n\nThere are a variety of sessions available throughout the day – Bible studies, seminars, activity groups and worship meetings – all designed to equip children, young people, students and adults to serve their church and reach the world with the good news of Jesus Christ. Later in the evening there is an 'After Hours' programme featuring contemporary worship, film nights, live interviews, comedy nights, gigs, as well as the highly anticipated Cèilidh.\n\nThe majority of guests stay in the on-site accommodation (chalets) provided at the holiday centre, with options for either self-catering or dinner, bed and breakfast.

It is located near the A379 road between Kingsbridge and Dartmouth, and lies within the South Devon Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). In 1901 the population of the civil parish was 527, decreasing to 473 in 2001, and decreasing further to 434 at the 2011 census. The parish is surrounded clockwise from the north by the parishes of Blackawton, Strete, Stokenham and East Allington.\n\nSlapton was recorded in the Domesday Book as \"Sladone\". The Collegiate Chantry of St Mary was founded in 1372 or 1373 by Sir Guy de Brian. The Tower Inn and West tower remain and the tower has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building. The Church of St James dates from the late 13th or early 14th century, and is also grade I listed.\n\nThe nearby beach is a coastal bar (see below), known as Slapton Sands. In 1944, during World War II, it was part of the site of Exercise Tiger, a rehearsal for the Invasion of Normandy which was attacked by German E-Boats and also saw a large number of friendly fire deaths. A Sherman tank that was sunk in this action has been recovered and now stands on the road behind the beach at nearby Torcross. Part of Exercise Fabius took place a week after Exercise Tiger on Slapton Sands. The beach itself is not sand, but consists of small smooth pebbles ranging in size from ¼ inch to several inches.\n\nBehind Slapton Sands is Slapton Ley, a nature reserve and example of serial or ecological succession — the process whereby open water becomes reed bed and eventually, as silt and leaf litter builds up, woodland. The beach itself is a bar: the material that makes up the beach was pushed up by the rising sea levels during the Flandrian transgression after the last glacial period (from 10,000 to 5,000 years ago). A similar process formed Chesil Beach. Beaches formed like this are reworked by coastal processes now but are not supplied by enough material to recreate them, should material be removed. This had terrible consequences nearby at Hallsands where most of the beach was removed as building material for Devonport dockyards, leaving the village exposed to storms. It was struck by a storm in 1917 and most of the village was washed away, although no villagers were killed.\n\nFurther north, the beach is known as Strete Gate and at the northernmost end is Pilchard Cove. The southern end of the beach is known as Torcross Sands. A length of beach about south of Pilchard Cove is regularly used by naturists.\n\n\n"}

It served mainly mine traffic, running north from Webbville through Grayson to Riverton (now part of Greenup) on the Ohio River and Chesapeake and Ohio Railway.\n\nThe Kentucky Improvement Company was chartered in December 1866 and renamed January 1, 1870 to the Eastern Kentucky Railway. The first section, from Riverton south to Argillite, opened in 1867. Further extensions took it to Hunnewell by 1870, Grayson in 1871, Willard by 1874 and Webbville in 1889. At Hitchins, between Grayson and Willard, the line junctioned with the Elizabethtown, Lexington and Big Sandy Railroad, an east-west branch of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway.\nThe Consolidated Southern Railway was a plan in the 1880s to extend the EK south as part of a through line to Hickory and Statesville, North Carolina, also using the never-built Norfolk and Cincinnati Railroad and part of the Chester and Lenoir Railroad.\n\nThe EK went bankrupt in 1919, and the part south of Grayson was reorganized in 1928 as the Eastern Kentucky Southern Railway. That company stopped operations in January 1933, and the tracks were removed soon after.\n\nThe EK is featured in the children's book \"A Ride with Huey, the Engineer\" (1966) by Jesse Stuart. The book \"Eastern Kentucky Railway\" by Terry L. Baldridge was published in September 2007\n\nThe old alignment parallels KY 1 north of Argillite. From Argillite south to Hunnewell, the alignment except the tunnels has been used for KY 207. KY 3306 mostly follows the path west to Hopewell, and from there south to Grayson it runs along KY 1. From Grayson to Hitchins, the alignment was used for KY 773, including two old truss bridges now used as one-lane road bridges. (Part of the old grade of the Elizabethtown, Lexington and Big Sandy Railroad west of the EK is erroneously named EK Railroad Drive.) Finally, from Hitchins to Webbville, the railroad once again followed KY 1; an old alignment includes another remaining truss bridge, that one with no floor.\nThe railroad had eight tunnels; all but the Argillite Tunnel, south of Argillite, have been flooded. The north end of Argillite Tunnel formerly could be seen from KY 207 where it curves to avoid the hill that the tunnel passes through. But the entrance was buried for safety reasons in 2017.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2212054", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2212054", "title": "Nisab", "text": "Nisab\n\nIn Sharia (Islamic Law) niṣāb (نِصاب) is the minimum amount that a Muslim must have before being obliged to zakat. Several hadith have formulas for calculating niṣāb, the most prominent of which declares that \"No Zakāt is due on wealth until one year passes\". Zakat is determined based on the amount of wealth acquired; the greater one's assets, the greater the tax. Unlike income tax in secular states niṣāb is not subject to special exemptions.\n\nIn Islam, niṣāb is 20 dinārs for gold and 200 dirhams for silver based on the original 1 to 10 exchange rate. The dinār is a gold coin weighing one mithqal (4.25 grams) and the dirḥam is a silver coin weighing 0.7 mithqal (2.975 grams). The niṣāb is applicable to the cumulative stock of dinārs, dirḥam and any other zakatable valuables, such as merchandise that has been in store for at least one year. As long as the total value of the zakatable valuables exceeds the value of the niṣāb, zakat must be paid.\n\nThe value of the niṣāb is calculated in dinār coins and dirḥam coins. The relation between 20 dinārs and 200 dirḥams which is part of the definition of niṣāb reflects the contemporary exchange value between the dinār and the dirḥam of 1 to 10 in the early days of Islam. In later times the exchange rate between the two Sharia coins changed according to market values, and so exchange rates of 1 to 11 and 1 to 12 are seen in early fiqh literature. This exchange rate has varied even more in the last few centuries. The shift in exchange rate meant that in later times 20 dinārs became more expensive in market value than 200 dirḥams. Despite this the definition of niṣāb has not been altered throughout Islamic history, and therefore a choice is created between the value of 20 dinārs and the value of 200 dirḥams. Both values are accepted in Shariah, and so one can choose to pay the value of either of them.\n\nThe value of one dinār is not identical to the value of the gold content of one dinār, and likewise with the silver in a dirḥam. There is also difference in value between dinārs depending on their quality and their acceptability. Although all gold or silver coins and products must be exchanged by weight and not by value in order to prevent riba al-fadl, different coins may have different market values as is reflected in the fiqh literature when it is said that some coins are not popular (makruhi)[See Imam Malik's al-Muwatta]. The value of the dinār and dirḥam are thus different from their respective gold and silver content. This represents a problem to modern Muslims because dinār and dirḥam coins are difficult to obtain.\n\nSome modern scholars have accepted that since dinārs and dirhams are no longer readily available the best solution is to calculate the niṣāb using a mithqal of pure gold as a reference. Although this is not an exact calculation it is considered a valid approximation given current circumstances.\n\nIn some countries Muslim communities have minted their own dinārs and dirhams following the original standards. These coins are used both as a method for general payment and specifically to pay zakat.\n\nIn order to be liable for zakat a Muslim must possess wealth in excess of the niṣāb level for one lunar year (354 days). This year begins on the date the wealth is obtained; so long as the assets are in its owner's possession at the beginning and end of the lunar year the zakat tax is applicable. In many modern societies niṣāb is considered equivalent to a governmentally determined \"poverty threshold.\"\n"}

He went on to attend the University of Arkansas, where he played fullback for the Razorbacks alongside a pair of tailbacks, James Rouse and E. D. Jackson, in Ken Hatfield's wishbone offense. Foster wore #18 for his entire time at Arkansas (1987-1989). Foster helped the Razorbacks win back-to-back Southwest Conference championships in 1988 and 1989, making consecutive trips to the Cotton Bowl Classic in Dallas on New Year's Day. Both teams would finish with a 10-2 record, and were ranked in the final polls top 15. After only three collegiate seasons, he decided to forgo his senior year after Hatfield left to coach Clemson, and entered the 1990 NFL Draft. He was selected by the Pittsburgh Steelers with the 19th pick of the 5th round (128th overall) by Chuck Noll. Foster was 5'10\", weighed 223 lbs, and wore #29 for the Steelers.\n\nBarry Foster’s NFL career was cut short because of injuries. For his career, he carried the football 915 times for 3,943 yards, a 4.3-yard per carry average, caught 93 passes for 804 receiving yards, scored 28 touchdowns, and went to 2 Pro-Bowls. His 1,690 rushing yards in 1992 is still the Steelers single season rushing record. Foster was known in the 90's as \"The NFL's Other Barry.\", a reference to himself and Barry Sanders.\n\nIn 1990, Foster was used primarily on special teams during his rookie season. It was during this first season that he made a catastrophic blunder in a game that Steelers played against the 49ers on October 21. He was positioned to receive a kick-off, but did not field the kick because he thought that the ball would be downed by the coverage team, not realizing that the dead ball rule only applies to punts and that the kick was a de facto fumble when he didn't secure it. The result was a San Francisco recovery that eventually lead to a Steelers loss. This is one of the handful of times in NFL history that a player neglected to field a kick-off on the return team.\nHis second NFL season, in 1991, started out with a 121-yard rushing game with a 56-yard touchdown run against the Buffalo Bills in week 2 but he sprained his ankle a few weeks later and missed five games.\n\nIn 1992, Barry Foster got the Bill Cowher era going in Pittsburgh after two seasons on the bench. Foster got the starting nod and rushed for a Steelers single season record 1,690 yards and also broke Franco Harris's team record for 100-yard games in a season with 12, that also tied Eric Dickerson's NFL record for 100-yard games. He was voted to the Pro Bowl that year and also scored 11 touchdowns. Foster finished 1992 as the AFC top rusher and second to Emmitt Smith by 23 yards for the rushing title.\n\nIn 1993, Foster's season started off strong, but injuries limited him to 711 yards in nine games with eight touchdowns. Despite the injuries, Foster still made the Pro Bowl for the second year in a row.\n\nIn 1994, Foster played 11 games (again limited due to injuries) and gained 851 yards. During a September 18, 1994 game against the Indianapolis Colts, he rushed for 179 yards on 31 carries and a touchdown. He added three catches for another 13 yards – giving him more yards than the entire Colts’ offense. The game was billed as Barry Foster versus Marshall Faulk, but it was no contest. “He (Faulk) wasn't the challenge,” said Foster. “I respond to the challenge the defense gives me\". The injury to Foster that year opened the door for rookie running back Bam Morris to take over.\n\nThe 1994 AFC Championship game would not only be Foster's last game in a Steeler uniform, but his last NFL game. Trailing the San Diego Chargers 17-13, the Steelers were mounting the go-ahead drive. On the last play of the game, a fourth down and goal from the three-yard line, Foster was in primarily as a blocker for Neil O'Donnell, but when San Diego sent no pass rush Foster ran out of the back field to become an eligible receiver on a short underneath route. The throw from O'Donnell was delayed and gave San Diego linebacker Dennis Gibson the chance to reach over Foster and bat the ball to the ground as Foster was falling to the turf of Three Rivers stadium. That play ended the Steelers' season. O'Donnell later stated that Foster was his fourth read on that play.\n\nIn 1995, Barry Foster had become expendable due to his contract, the rise of Bam Morris and the signing of former 1,000-yard running back Erric Pegram. Pittsburgh traded Foster to the expansion Carolina Panthers but he was cut in training camp when he failed a physical, after which he retired.\n\nLater that season, Foster came out of retirement to sign with the Cincinnati Bengals after the injury to their first round draft pick Ki-Jana Carter in the pre season. But two days after signing a $1 million contract, Foster changed his mind and left the Bengals. Foster, age 26, out of football since the Carolina Panthers released him before the 1995 season began, complained that he felt like \"a 60-year-old running back\" after his first workout in pads with the team. He later returned his reported $300,000 signing bonus to the Bengals, left town, and retired again a few days later without playing a game. He announced that he had saved his money and had enough to retire.\n\nSince Foster retired from the NFL, he became the running backs coach at DeLay Middle School and is currently an Assistant Principal at Grand Prairie High School in Grand Prairie, Texas.\n\n\"Note: G = Games played; Att = Rushing attempts; Yds = Rushing yards; Avg = Average yards per carry; Long = Longest rush; Rush TD = Rushing touchdowns; Rec = Receptions; Yds = Receiving yards; Avg = Average yards per reception; Long = Longest reception; Rec TD = Receiving touchdowns\"\n\n\nFoster has been Married to Teray M.

He represented the FR Yugoslavia national team at the 1998 FIFA World Cup. He was most recently managed Inter Zaprešić.\n\nPetrović made his professional debut with Budućnost in 1987 under coach Stanko Poklepović. In Petrović's second season at Budućnost, the team included the likes of Niša Saveljić, Anto Drobnjak, Dejan Savićević, and Predrag Mijatović. During Petrović's time at Budućnost, the team finished in ninth place in the 1987–88 season, fourteenth in the 1988–89 season, and tenth in the 1989–90 season.\n\nPetrović moved to Dinamo Zagreb in 1990, where he played as a right back. In June 1991, Dinamo changed their name to HAŠK Građanski. In HAŠK Građanski's short 1991–92 UEFA Cup campaign, Petrović scored all three of HAŠK Građanski's goals over two legs played against Trabzonspor. He scored two penalties in the first leg played on 17 September 1991, which HAŠK lost 2-3 to Trabzonspor. He scored another goal in the second leg played on 2 October 1991, which HAŠK tied 1-1. In spite of Petrović's goalscoring form, HAŠK were eliminated from the UEFA Cup losing to Trabzonspor on aggregate.\n\nPetrović joined Sevilla in November 1991, with his transfer from HAŠK Građanski costing the Spanish team 500,000 DM. HAŠK Građanski had agreed on Petrović's transfer as part of a package with Davor Šuker, who joined Sevilla simultaneously. At the time, La Liga teams could field only up to four foreigners on the pitch, and Sevilla already had two foreign starters in Iván Zamorano and Pablo Bengoechea. With the addition of Šuker, Petrović was meant to be Sevilla's fourth foreign starter, although he initially enjoyed little playing time. Gradually, coach Víctor Espárrago began bringing him off the bench, and in a breakthrough performance, Petrović made an assist in Sevilla's 1-0 win against Real Murcia in the 1992 Copa del Rey Round of 16. On 22 March 1992, Petrović scored his only goal in a league match with Real Burgos, with Sevilla winning 3-2. However, after the departure of coach Espárrago, a markedly dry spell followed, especially when Sevilla signed Diego Maradona in the summer of 1992. Therefore, he was quick to sign for Dutch club FC Den Bosch that summer.\n\nPetrović joined FC Den Bosch in 1992 while his father was living in nearby Heusden as a guest worker. This circumstance seemed to be a deciding factor in his move to Den Bosch, as it was widely regarded that he could have easily played for a more competitive team. Den Bosch director Chris van der Laar commented that Petrović was \"too good for Den Bosch\". In spite of Petrović's good reception, Den Bosch struggled in the 1992–93 season and ended up relegated back to the second tier at the end of the season. After a 5-0 loss against Feyenoord in May 1993, Den Bosch coach Hans van der Pluijm noted that \"[Petrović] is playing three classes better than the rest of the team.\" He was eager to join RKC Waalwijk in 1994. It was at this club which he excelled as an attacking right-back, and he scored 13 goals in total of 2 seasons before joining Dutch giants PSV Eindhoven in 1996.\n\nPetrović joined PSV Eindhoven in the summer of 1996. He was a regular starter during the 1996–97 season, when PSV won the Eredivisie that season under coach Dick Advocaat. In his second season at the club, however, he proved a difficult player to manage and he was also involved in a spat with team captain Arthur Numan. Towards the end of Petrović's time at PSV, coach Advocaat was critical of his smoking habits. In the fall of 1997, Petrović accepted a lucrative offer from the Urawa Red Diamonds, which estranged him from the rest of the club. He insisted that he did not wish to leave PSV, but that the offer could not be ignored since ten of his relatives were living off of his money in Yugoslavia. Petrović played a total of 35 games for PSV. He played his last game for PSV on 5 November 1997, in a Champions League match against Newcastle United at St James' Park.\n\nIn 1997, he moved to Japan to play for Urawa Red Diamonds before returning to RKC Waalwijk in 2000 where he finished his playing career.\n\nPetrović made his debut for the national team of Yugoslavia on 12 September 1990 in a match against Northern Ireland. Yugoslavia was subsequently banned from the Euro 1992, the 1994 FIFA World Cup, and the Euro 1996 due to FIFA suspending Yugoslavia following the international sanctions against Yugoslavia. Petrović would play for Yugoslavia again five years after his debut, for the qualification to the 1998 FIFA World Cup.\n\nPetrović was a regular of the Yugoslav national team throughout the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualification. On 28 October 1997, the night before the first leg of the qualifying play-off against Hungary, Petrović received a death threat by an anonymous phone caller. The caller gave Petrović twelve hours to leave Yugoslavia before being killed. In the time preceding the death threat, Petrović had been subject to a whispering campaign that suggested he once played for the Croatian national team during the breakup of Yugoslavia, before Croatia became an official FIFA member. Petrović strongly denied this, and teammate Savo Milošević accused some journalists of jeopardizing Petrović's life by spreading fake news about him. Petrović went on to play for Yugoslavia at the 1998 FIFA World Cup.\n\nAfter the rumors were spread, Petrović took several opportunities to explain how the media identified him. When a Dutch journalist asked Petrović about his nationality considering the breakup of Yugoslavia, Petrović insisted on his identity as a Yugoslav. He explained himself with the following:\nOn 21 August 2006 Petrović was appointed as the new head coach of Portuguese team Boavista F.C.. In his first match as manager, Boavista won 3-0 against Benfica. However, he resigned in October 2006 after only a month and a half in charge. The following 2007–2008 season Petrovic managed RKC Waalwijk to a second place in the Dutch 2nd division and failed to gain promotion to the Eredivisie. In the 2008–2009 season he was Martin Jol's assistant at Hamburger SV.\n\nOn 28 July 2010 West Ham United confirmed Petrović as the assistant manager to manager Avram Grant. On 23 November 2010, West Ham parted company with Petrović after less than four months. Upon his departure he made controversial comments about the Premier League questioning its quality.\n\nOn 17 March 2015, Petrović was named the assistant manager at Sunderland, but was sacked on 4 October later that year.\n\nIn the beginning of June 2019, Botev Plovdiv introduced Petrović as the new head coach of the club. Following his recommendations the club signed Marko Pervan, Philippe van Arnhem and Rodney Klooster. After a long run of poor results, on 16 October, Petrović was sacked. Shortly after that Philippe van Arnhem and Rodney Klooster were also released. In 12 games under his guidance Botev Plovdiv won only twice, achieved 3 draws and lost 7 matches, last 4 of which in a row.\n\nIn the beginning of January 2020, Inter Zaprešić introduced Petrović as the new head coach. On 10 April 2020, following the COVID-19 pandemic, Petrović terminated the contract with the club.\n\n"}
{"id": "2212076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2212076", "title": "Scammell", "text": "Scammell\n\nScammell Lorries Limited was a British manufacturer of trucks, particularly specialist and military off-highway vehicles, between 1921 and 1988.\n\nScammell started as a late-Victorian period wheelwright and coach-building business, G Scammell & Nephew Ltd in Spitalfields, London. George Scammell, the founder, was joined by his nephew Richard and Richard's sons Alfred and James. By the early 1900s, the firm had become financially stable, providing maintenance to customers of Foden steam wagons. One such customer, Edward Rudd, had imported a Knox Automobile tractor from the United States, and impressed with its low weight/high hauling power had asked Scammell if they could make a similar model of their own.\n\nHowever, the outbreak of World War I in 1914 stopped the project and presented itself as a turning point in road transport history. Mechanical transport was seen to work, proving its vast potential beyond doubt to forward-thinking companies such as Scammell. George Scammell's great nephew, Lt Col Alfred Scammell, was injured and invalided out of the army, and he was able to apply the practical experience he had gained during the war and began developing the articulated six wheeler. Percy G Hugh, chief designer, conceived the idea and at the 1920 Commercial Motor Show, 50 orders were taken for the new design. The vehicle's very low axle weight allowed it to carry payload legally at , rather than being limited to 5 mph.\n\nScammell started production of the 7.5-ton articulated vehicle in 1920. Needing to move to new premises, Scammell & Nephew floated a new company, Scammell Lorries Ltd in July 1922, with Col Scammell as Managing Director. The new firm built a new factory at Tolpits Lane, Watford, next to Watford West railway station on the branch line from to . The original company remained in business in Fashion Street, Spitalfields refurbishing and bodybuilding until taken over in 1965 by York Trailer Co.\n\nIn 1929, Scammell designed and manufactured the \"100 Tonner\" low loader. Only two were produced; the first was delivered to Marston Road Services, Liverpool, for the transportation of steam engines to Liverpool docks. Scammell were also looking for new markets, and diversified into four- and six-wheel rigid (nonarticulated) designs. The 'Rigid Six-wheeler' found some success and, with its balloon tyres, at last permitted sustained high-speed, long-distance road operation.\n\nIn 1934, Scammell produced the three-wheeled Mechanical Horse, designed by Oliver North to replace horses in rail, postal and other delivery applications. This featured automatic carriage coupling and the single front wheel could be steered through 360 degrees. It was sold in three- and six-ton versions. The three-tonner was powered by a 1,125-cc side-valve petrol engine and the six-tonner by a 2,043-cc engine. Karrier had introduced a similar vehicle, the Cob, four years earlier.\n\nFrom 1937, a Citroën Traction Avant powered version was made under licence in France, by Chenard-Walcker-FAR, known as the Pony Mécanique. This continued in production, in various versions, until 1970.\n\nIn the late 1940s, the Mechanical Horse was superseded by the Scammell Scarab, with similar features, but a much less angular cab and now with a 2,090-cc, side-valve petrol engine in both models and a diesel version with a Perkins engine.\n\nThe company mainly concentrated on articulated and rigid eight-wheeler lorries, from the 1920s. One vehicle not in those lines that became well-known was the 6×4 Pioneer. This was an off-highway, heavy haulage tractor, first produced in 1927. It showed outstanding cross-country performance due to the design that included the patent beam bogie rear axle, with of vertical movement for each of the rear wheels. This design was the work of Oliver Danson North. The Pioneer proved popular in the oil field and forestry (logging) markets, and formed the basis of the British Army's World War II R100 30-ton tank transporter. With the outbreak of war, development of new vehicles stopped and production concentrated on military Pioneers for use as artillery tractors, recovery and transporter vehicles.\n\nPost war, foreign competition and rationalisation of the UK manufacturers led to Scammell coming under Leyland Motors in 1955. This provided access to ready-made components within the Leyland group, allowing the replacement of the \"lightweight\" range with the:\nBoth the tractor units could be configured up to 50 tons (50.8 Tonnes or 55 short tons), and complemented by the full range of Scammell trailers made at the Moor Park works, allowed the company to continue production in specialist and military markets.\n\nIn the 1960s, Scammell contracted Giovanni Michelotti to design its cabs, resulting in a series of glass-reinforced plastic \"spring\"-like designs. The first to be redesigned was the Routeman, followed by the Handyman. In 1967, the 'Scarab' was replaced by the 'Townsman', which also had a GRP body. The factory also designed the 6x4 Contractor equipped with a Cummins 335 engine, Lipe clutch and Fuller semi-automatic gearbox, that went into production in 1964. Offered with a choice of Leyland 24 tonne or Scammell 30 and 40 tonne bogies, the Contractor was popular in the UK for 240+ ton GTW operation, overseas heavy haul, and with the military for tank transport.\n\nIn 1964, Scammell assembled 38 BUT RETB/1 trolleybuses for use in Wellington, New Zealand.\n\nScammell launched the three-axle 6x4 Crusader at London's 1968 Earl's Court Commercial Vehicle Show. The truck was designed for high-speed long distance transport, typically to cover 250,000 miles a year. The truck included a 'repair by replacement' philosophy to cut downtime and the consequences of unscheduled maintenance. The drive line included a 9.3-litre GM Detroit Diesel 8V71N two-stroke diesel engine, rated at 273 bhp. This drove through a Fuller RoadRanger 16-speed constant-mesh gear box, to an Albion double-drive and two-spring bogie, using double reduction and cross lockable drive axles. The final reduction took place in the hubs to give better ground clearance under the differential housings. Scammell used the same rear bogie on its highly successful 24-ton Double Drive Routeman 8x4 tipper chassis, launched at the same exhibition. As most contemporary 32-ton and maximum capacity trucks in the UK had engine power ratings of between 150 and 220 bhp, the Crusader's 273 bhp attracted immediate attention, much of it unfavourable from deeply conservative operators.\n\nWith active encouragement from Walter Batstone, then transport engineering boss at British Road Services, Scammell quickly developed a two-axle model, powered initially by a Rolls-Royce Eagle six-cylinder diesel engine, rated at 220 or 280 bhp, depending on customers' preferences. This new model appeared at the November 1969 Scottish Motor Show at Kelvin Hall.\n\nScammell went on to develop a heavy haulage model, the Samson, basically a four-axle 8x4 Crusader. It sold in limited numbers in a specialised market sector.\n\nThe 1970s started with a reorganisation of the Leyland Group, with heavy haul after the closure of the old Thornycroft works in 1972 concentrated on the newly named Scammell Motors site at Watford. The Thornycroft 6x4 Nubian heavy dumptruck was the first transfer inwards, regularly adapted for the military, followed by the lighter LD55 6x4 dumptruck.\n\nIn the late 1970s, the Contractor Mk2 was developed, together with the Scammell Commander tank transporter for the British Army. Fitted with the Rolls-Royce CV12TCE 26-litre, 48-valve dual-turbocharged 625 hp intercooled V12 diesel engine, semi-automatic gearbox and Scammell 40-ton bogie, it was plated at 100 ton+ GTW. Because it was intended as part of the strategy to defend West Germany's eastern Iron Curtain border against tank attack, it was designed to achieve the same acceleration and braking performances as a contemporary commercial 32 tractor. Both tractors were brought into production within the newly built \"moving line\" construction shop, which gave Scammell a modern state-of-the-art factory. The Commander fleet came into operation in 1983.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Leyland Group decided to develop two new tractors: the overseas bonneted Landtrain; the UK forward control Roadtrain. Scammell was contracted to develop the Landtrain, which used the same cab and bonnet as the Commander replacement, the S24. Equipped with Cummins NT 350 or 400 engine, the S24 could be specified from 40 tonnes GVW to more than 200 tonnes GTW. Scammell also gained the contract to develop and build the eight-wheeled version of the Roadtrain, the Constructor8. This also allowed Scammell to develop and produce the complementary S26 range of heavy-haul 4x2, 6x2 and 6x4 tractors, which was a parts-bin build from the Roadtrain and 24 components.\n\nIn 1986, Scammell tendered for the British Army hooklift DROPS tender, using the newly developed 8x6 variant of the S24. This was equipped with a Rolls-Royce 350 engine, ZF automatic gearbox and Kirkstall axles. However, shortly after winning the contract to supply 1,522 such vehicles, Leyland group was bought by DAF of the Netherlands. DAF elected to build the S26 DROPS at the Leyland plant in Lancashire, and to close the Watford factory.\n\nDAF closed the plant in July 1988. It sold the site for redevelopment, and further sold the rights to manufacture (but not the rights to the name nor the premises) of the S24, Nubian, Crusader, and Commander to Alvis Unipower. They opened a new plant in West Watford, offering ongoing support and spare parts for Scammell vehicles.\n\nThe Tolpits Lane site was redeveloped into a housing estate, the Vale Industrial Estate, and a business park. Tenants include the Camelot Group.\n\n\nConstructor 6WD\nContractor 8X4\nS24 6WD\nS26 6WD\nS26 8WD\n\nThe Rigid 6 and Rigid 8, for the number of wheels, were produced from 1937 to 1958.\n\nThe Showtrac was a short-wheelbase 4x2 ballast tractor, one of the few vehicles ever designed specifically for fairground use. It could be supplied with a rear body (with half-height roller shutter access doors), winch, and dynamo with the ballast block underneath. Eighteen were built, to varying specifications (not all had the body fitted, for example), between December 1945 and September 1948. Seventeen have been preserved. There are many look-alike Scammell tractors, but genuine Showtracs had a special \"Showtrac\" badge on the radiator, and a full-width cab.\n\nThe Handyman initially used a glass-fibre cab designed by Scammell – for the Mark 2 and 3 versions a new Michellotti-designed \"cheesegrater\" fibreglass cab as used on the 2nd and 3rd versions of the Routeman Rigid was fitted.\n\nEarly versions were equipped with Scammell's own \"gate-change\" gearbox but subsequent versions were fitted with AEC and David Brown gearboxes.\n\nEngines fitted included the Leyland 680, Gardner 150 and Rolls-Royce 220.\n\nThe Trunker was a three-axle version of the Handyman.\n\nThe Contractor was a 6x4 tractor used by various operators including the Australian Army as a tank transporter or as heavy haulage, usually engineering plant for the Royal Australian Engineers. The Australian military units were configured with 335HP Cummins diesel engines and pneumocyclic gearboxes. While one of the trials vehicles which served in the Vietnam War was branded with the Scammell name, most of the remaining units were branded Leyland. Two trailer specifications were used, a 24-wheel float with 16 wheel dolly trailer for transporting the Australian Centurion tank or US Patton tank in Vietnam. The other trailer was a 40 Ton 12 wheel Steco folding goose neck trailer for the engineering plant.\n\nThe Crusader was a 4×2 or 6×4 tractor that used a Motor Panels-supplied steel cab, available in sleeper- or day-cab forms. It had the option of Detroit Diesel, Cummins, Rolls-Royce or Leyland engines.\n\nThe Crusader was used by the British Army as a 6×4 tow-truck (with EKA underlift equipment) and as a 6x4 tractor unit normally used for towing 35–tonne plant trailers or 30–tonne tank bridge transport trailers. A recovery variant was also in use. The British Army replaced the Crusader in the late 1990s by a Seddon Atkinson tractor unit with a 40–tonne plant trailer and a specialist tank bridge transporter.\nMany have seen use in the heavy haulage industry due to their incredibly strong chassis.\n\nThe military specification vehicles were usually equipped with 15-speed Fuller gearboxes and an 8–tonne capstan winch.\n\nThe Commander was introduced as a tank transporter in 1978. Designed in the late 1970s, they replaced the Thornycroft Antars in the British Army beginning with the delivery of the first one on 30 March 1984 followed by others totaling 125 units. The 6×4 units could carry a load of 65 tonnes and were used to transport Challenger II tanks. Used during the Gulf War, they were retired in 2002 and replaced by the Oshkosh M1070F HET.\n\nThe Commander is powered by the 26.7L Rolls-Royce/Perkins CV12 TCE twin turbocharged diesel engine that produces approximately and is coupled to an Allison automatic transmission. The Scammell Commander CV12 engine is very similar to the ones used in the Challenger 1 and 2 main battle tanks but with an increased power output of around 1,200 bhp 895 kW. Designed to tow loads up to 65 tonnes, the Commander tows a special semi-trailer onto which tanks can be tail-loaded using a hydraulic 20–tonne capacity winch. A prominent bonnet houses the vehicle's Perkins (Rolls-Royce) CV 12 TCE V12 and although the Commander is powered by the Perkins/Rolls-Royce engine, other types were also proposed – one of the prototypes used a Cummins KTA 600 diesel. The cab has provision for up to three or four passengers and there is space for two bunks behind the front seats. Due to the front axle lock angle, the Commander is highly maneuverable and can negotiate a 'T' intersection with only 9.15 meters between the walls.\n\nIn 1988 the Leyland group including Scammell company was bought by DAF, the rights to the Commander were sold Unipower Ltd, who opened a new plant in West Watford.\n\nIn 1990 during the operation Desert Storm 70 Scammell Commander heavy tank transporters were used to transport 40 types of various military cargo. Each of the vehicles was on the road 17 hours a day during a 4-month period and on average each vehicle traveled 270 km a day on the desert roads. Most of the 125 British Army Commanders were based in Belgium and Germany, with only a few in the United Kingdom.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2212080", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2212080", "title": "Thames Rowing Club", "text": "Thames Rowing Club\n\nThe Thames Rowing Club (TRC) is the joint third-oldest non-academic rowing club on the Thames and is in Putney, London. It was founded in 1860, the same year as Twickenham Rowing Club. The TRC clubhouse is situated on Putney Embankment and was constructed in 1879 with several later additions.\n\nAs at July 2019, Thames had won events at Henley Royal Regatta 80 times. \n\nThames is one of the founding clubs of Remenham Club; a social club for rowers, with a clubhouse and grounds on the Henley Royal Regatta course. Thames hosts Cambridge University Women's Boat Club for their winter Tideway training ahead of the Women's Boat Race, and on race day itself. Thames also houses the Boat Race's media centre and administrative office.\n\nThe club colours are red, white and black in stripes, the white stripe lying between the red and black and being of half their width.\n\nThames Rowing Club was founded under the name City of London Rowing Club and according to its first rules, its objects were 'organised pleasure or exercise rowing'. The earliest surviving minutes of a club meeting are dated January 1861 but are headed 'City of London Rowing Club. Founded 1860', and 1860 is commonly accepted as the year of foundation, the same year as Twickenham Rowing Club. Three academic institutions aside, this makes it the third oldest rowing club on the Thames.\n\nThe initial members were chiefly clerks and salesmen working in London's textiles trade around Fore Street and St Paul's Churchyard. At least one of the early meetings is known to have taken place in the Lord Raglan public house in St Martin's-le-Grand. The club had boats at Simmons Boathouse (the building currently occupied by Chas Newens Marine) and a room at the Red Lion Hotel at the foot of Putney High Street. There were very few members at first, but the numbers rapidly increased, and in 1862, when club races were first started, the club numbered nearly 150.\n\nIn 1862, the club sought and gained the permission of Frank Playford, the only traceable member of \"The Thames Club\" which had rowed on the Tideway in the 1840s, to rename itself \"The Thames Rowing Club\".\n\nBy 1864 a growing interest in competition led to the club’s first recorded win, in a four-oared race against the Excelsior Boat Club of Greenwich. The club also put on a crew for the Metropolitan Junior Eights, started in 1865, and followed this up the next year by securing the Challenge Cup for Junior Eights at the first Metropolitan Regatta.\n\nIn 1870 the Club won at Henley Royal Regatta for the first time, taking the Wyfold Challenge Cup from the Oscillators Club of Surbiton and the Oxford Etonians in a race that, according to the Rowing Almanack, was ‘a pretty hollow affair, the Thames crew winning as they pleased from first to last.’ Over the next twenty years, Thames had its first great flowering, with 22 wins at Henley by 1890, including four victories in the most prestigious event, the Grand Challenge Cup for eights.\n\nIn 1877 the Thames Boathouse Company (Limited) was formed for the purpose of providing a boat and club house for the club. Money was raised by means of shares, the club and the company being kept quite distinct. The construction of the present Thames boathouse on a site about 300 yards above that of London Rowing Club followed and the building was completed in 1879 at a cost of over £3000.\n\nThames, under its captain James Hastie, was now established as a mainstay of amateur rowing in London, and as a rival to its Putney neighbour London Rowing Club. In 1879 Thames, like London, was one of the founder clubs of the Metropolitan Rowing Association which later became the (defunct) Amateur Rowing Association (ARA).\n\nThis early period was the time of the great Victorian amateur. Many Thames members were keen on all sports and the club itself also had an influence beyond rowing:\n\nIn December 1867, Thames organised a two and a half mile handicap steeplechase or paperchase similar to a cross-country race around Wimbledon Common as part of the oarsmen’s winter training. These are generally accepted as the first open cross-country events to have taken place in Britain. One eventual result was the foundation of the Thames Hare and Hounds in October 1868, the first cross-country club, which would itself go on to an illustrious history.\n\nAnother addition to rowing training was boxing, with a ring frequently set up in the hall at the clubhouse. George Vize, a member of five winning crews at Henley, became amateur heavyweight champion of Britain in 1878 and a founder member of the Amateur Boxing Association. Boxing finally disappeared after the First World War, when the coach Steve Fairbairn ended it because of the damage caused to oarsmen’s hands.\n\nFrom the late 1890s into the first decade of the 20th century, Thames suffered a decline but recovered as the decade wore on, notably through the efforts of Julius Beresford and Karl Vernon.\n\nAfter the First World War, Thames came under the influence of the coach Steve Fairbairn. Fairbairn was an Australian graduate of Cambridge, with boundless charisma and innovative (and highly controversial) views on training and technique. He was one of the major influences on the club and on the sport in general, becoming generally accepted as the father of modern rowing. Under his tutelage in the 1920s, and that of Julius Beresford, Thames reached new heights. Fairbairn left the club for London Rowing Club in 1925. The precise reasons are unclear but undoubtedly a clash with Julius Beresford was partly at the root: the two coaches, despite holding similar views on technique, were unable to get on. Under Beresford, Thames won four events at Henley in both 1927 and 1928, something which no club replicated in the 20th century.\n\nAt the same time, Thames was home to Britain’s greatest ever single sculler. Jack Beresford (son of Julius) took Silver at the 1920 Amsterdam Olympics in an epic race with Jack Kelly, before going one better with Gold at Paris in 1924. He won the Diamond Sculls at Henley four times and the Wingfield Sculls for the Amateur championship of Great Britain a record seven times. Then, with Thames crews, he took three further Olympic medals: Silver in the eight in Antwerp, 1928, Gold in the coxless four in Los Angeles, 1932 and Gold in the double scull in Berlin, 1936. It would be 60 years before Steve Redgrave bettered his record.\n\nAlthough never again reaching the heights of the late 1920s, Thames continued to be successful through the thirties and then, after the Second World War, into the forties and fifties. However, in the early sixties the club began to experience a marked decline in membership and standards. By the early seventies Thames had very few active members and came close to bankruptcy. The club went for 47 years from 1956 without a win by a men's crew at Henley Royal Regatta.\n\nFinally in 2003, Thames achieved an emphatic win in the Wyfold Challenge Cup which was repeated in 2006. This success was further compounded in 2015 when Thames won the Thames Challenge Cup for club eights, the first time the club had done so since 1934. This was followed in 2016 by a win in the Visitors' Challenge Cup for intermediate coxless fours. In 2017, there was an unprecedented achievement: two Thames crews reached the final of the Thames Challenge Cup, with Thames A beating Thames B by 5 lengths. The following year, Thames retained the Thames Challenge Cup, and won the Britannia Challenge Cup for the first time in its history, setting a course record in the process.\n\nIn 1972, Thames became one of the first British rowing clubs to admit women and rapidly became the powerhouse of women's rowing, a position it retains to this day. Thames women have represented Great Britain at every Olympic Games since Los Angeles; most recently Elise Laverick won Bronze in the double scull at the Beijing Olympics in 2008 and the Athens Olympics in 2004 and sisters Guin Batten and Miriam Batten won Silver in the quadruple scull at the Sydney Olympics. Since the founding of Henley Women's Regatta in 1987, the Club has won there 55 times with the most recent wins being the elite lightweight pair and senior lightweight single scull in 2017.\n\nRowing by older oarsmen (and more recently oarswomen) has been a part of the club's activities throughout its history, but has increased since the 1970s in line with more national and FISA (international) Masters Competition now on offer. A group of casual and veteran men came into existence in the 1970s; separate groups of masters oarsmen and women of different ages have since arisen from time to time.\n\nThe TRC clubhouse is situated on Putney Embankment between Rotherwood Road and Festing Road, approximately 400 metres from the Putney end of the Championship Course. Its neighbouring clubs are Vesta Rowing Club and Imperial College Boat Club. As such, the club's training water is the tidal stretch of the Thames (known as the tideway); the club commonly trains upstream as far as Richmond Lock and less commonly downstream as far as Westminster Bridge.\n\nThe clubhouse itself was constructed in 1879 with several later additions. In 2005, the club opened a new building behind the clubhouse, named in memory of former Club President and benefactor Alan Burrough, providing additional training facilities and boat storage. In May 2011, work began on substantial alterations and improvements to the clubhouse. These works were completed in November 2011.\n\nThames Rowing Club's stated focus is on racing and competition but it is also open to complete beginners. Thames appears to have one of the largest active memberships of any UK rowing club; this membership being split approximately equally between male and female.\n\nSince first admitting women in 1973, the club has gained a strong reputation in women's rowing, with over 50 wins since 1988 at Henley Women's Regatta, most recently Elite Lightweight Coxless Pair and Senior Lightweight Single Scull in 2017. Thames has also frequently won pennants in the Women's Eights Head of the River Race. Thames' men's squad have also performed strongly in recent years, with wins in the Club and Intermediate events at Henley Royal Regatta and two wins of the Vernon Trophy at the Head of the River Race for the fastest tideway club. Thames also has a junior squad and additionally provides facilities to London Youth Rowing. Masters (Veteran) Rowing at Thames is very strong, at all such levels, both men and women, regularly competing and winning at the FISA World Masters Regatta.\n\nAs at July 2017, Thames had won events at Henley Royal Regatta 78 times. The most recent wins were the Thames Challenge Cup for men's club eights in both 2017 and 2015, the Visitors' Challenge Cup for intermediate men's coxless fours in 2016, the Wyfold Challenge Cup for men's club coxless fours in 2006 and 2003, and the Remenham Challenge Cup for women's open eights in 2005. The club also had a member in each of the composite crews which won the Remenham Challenge Cup in 2008 and 2009.\n\nThe current Head Coach is Sander Smulders, who took over from former Head Coach, Ben Lewis, in the season beginning in 2019. Under Sander, is the Men's coach, Jeroen van der Kall, who joined from Okeanos R.S.V.U. at the start of the 2019 season, and Women's coaches, Jamie Low and Ellie Garratt-Smith.\n\nThames was one of five clubs which retained the right until 2012 to appoint representatives to the Council of British Rowing. The others were Leander Club, London Rowing Club, Oxford University Boat Club and Cambridge University Boat Club.\n\n\n\n"}

The PCA emerged in 1920 as an extension the French Communist Party (PCF) and eventually became a separate entity in 1936 (Gilberg, 1988, p. 242), despite this it was recognized by the Comintern in 1935. Its first congress was in Algiers in July 1936, where it was the PCA's headquarter.\n\nIn 1955 the party was banned by the French authorities. The party then oriented itself towards the national liberation movement.\n\nPCA obtained legal status in 1962, and in the same year, it was banned and dissolved. The Algerian communists later regrouped as PAGS.\n\nThe general secretaries of PCA were Benali Boukort from 1936 to 1939, Ouzegane during the underground central committee, Bouhali from 1947 to 1949 and Bachir Hadj Ali from 1949.\n\nThe PCA had at the beginning a lack of political sensibility with the colonized aspirations. That is attributed to the majority of its members (between 12,000 and 15,000) being Pieds-Noirs. The PCA supported the Blum–Viollette proposal and Setif´s repression of 1945.\n\nHowever, some Muslims were attracted to the PCA. Some of them were: Ben Ali Boukurt, Ahmed Akkache and the general secretary Bachir Hadj Ali. The PCA additionally had trouble gaining traction since it had lost most of its proletariat base. During the first world war, as France's men were mostly employed along the western front, tens of thousands of Algerians, displaced from the countryside moved to France to take advantage of the labor shortage. A saying emerged that \"l’Algerie est une societe dont le proletariat est en France.\" Essentially, Algeria's proletariat was in France. The First World war had another affect, it increased union membership, leading to a doubling of Algiers Trade Union membership. This only continued as the ranks of displaced workers flooded Algeria's cities from the countryside. However, ties remained with the rural communities in which they had lived for generations. As these people joined the communist party, their networks allowed the party to expand into areas not typically considered its territory. Yet the division that dominated Algerian Society also affected the supposedly egalitarian Communist Party, the division of ethnicity effected the Algerian communist party as well. Additionally, since the party was so tied to France, there were different ideas about how to pursue the Comintern's call for peoples to free themselves around the world. A major part of the Algerian communist party believed that first a revolution must take place in France, and then Algeria could have hers. Leon Trotsky, as well as many other notable internationalists called this a continuation of the slave mentality.\n\nAt the beginning of the Independence War, the PCA was damaged. The Muslim members wanted to join the nationalists, but not the Europeans. That ambiguity was due to the PCF's equivocal positions.\n\nIn 1956 the Central Committee of the PCA voted to join the Revolution maintaining its independent internal administration.\n\nDuring the War, some members of the PCA distinguished themselves. Henri Maillot was killed while providing arms to the Nationalists and serving the \"Maquis Rouges\". Henri Alleg, as many others, was arrested and tortured, he was the editor of the \"Alger Republicain\".\nThe PCA collaborated with the \"Front de Libération Nationale\" (FLN), and there were accusations from the communists of discrimination and to put them in more dangerous situations by purpose.\n\nThe PCA did not adopt a position in the postwar conflict between the \"Gouvernement provisional de la République algérienne\" (GPRA) and the Political Bureau. By 1962 the PCA and its newspaper \"al-Hurriya\" were suppressed and banned .\n\nAt the beginning of Ben Bella´s government the Algerian communists still exercised influence through publications such as \"Révolution africaine\". During the military coup of Boumediene in 1965 the remnents of the PCA were eliminated. Communists later reorganized during 1966 as the \"Parti de l´Avant-Garde Socialiste\" (PAGS).\n\nDuring the liberation war, in 1955 the PCA created combatant units called \"Combattants de la Libération\". At 1956 the PCA and the FLN made an agreement in which it integrated the PCA combatant force to the National Liberation Army (ALN), separating from the leadership of the party that remained in Algiers. By 1962, after finished the independence war, Communist were attracting members to the party and publishing \"Alger Républicain\", so the FLN with fear about this, banned the PCA, but they tolerated the communists themselves.\n\nBen Bella's constitution of 1963 put the FLN as the only legal party. A curious fact is that FLN took people from the PCA later to work on state, because they were prepared and educated. At 1965 some of the leaders of the PCA, with the left wing of the FLN created an Organization to combat the military coup of Boumediene, the \"Organization de la résistance populaire\" (OPR).\n\nPCA appeared at 1920 as an extension of the PCF. PCF was mainly French, European. PCA was against French domination, and it tried to be more Arab by his separation, at least in the wish. Comintern supported the anti-imperialist fights on that times. However, PCA followed the political leadership of the PCF, what it made turn back on the demands of independence. By 1939 both PCA and PCF were banned, damaging the space for communism.\n\nWith the massacres of 1945 by the settlers, the PCA and PCF weren't quick to condemn the massacre. However, the fight against Fascism gave the PCF a good status.\n\nAfter the Second World War and the massacre, the PCA started a campaign against the state repression, because of nationalists in the party, sometimes radicalized. This make the PCA takes politics more autonomous to the PCF. At the Cold War, the PCF put the focus on the North American imperialism, while the PCA focused on the French imperialism. When liberation war started, the PCA was banned again in 1955 and repressed.\n\n\n\n"}

It also publishes the \"Nature-\"titled research journals, \"Nature Reviews\" journals (since 2000), society-owned academic journals, and a range of open access journals, including \"Scientific Reports\" and \"Nature Communications\". Springer Nature also publishes \"Scientific American\" in 16 languages, a magazine intended for the general public. In 2013, prior to the merger with Springer and the creation of Springer Nature, Nature Publishing Group's owner, Holtzbrinck Publishing Group, bought a controlling stake in Frontiers. \n\nBefore Springer Nature was formed in 2015, Nature Research (as the Nature Publishing Group) was a part of Macmillan Science and Education, a fully owned subsidiary of Holtzbrinck Publishing Group.\n\nNature Research employs more than 800 people in its offices in London, New York City, San Francisco, Seoul, Washington, D.C., Boston, Tokyo, Paris, Berlin, Munich, Madrid, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Delhi, Melbourne, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, São Paulo and Basingstoke.\n\nAs of September 2016, Nature Research publishes 148 academic journals.

However, articles are presented using the digital rights management system ReadCube (which is funded by the Macmillan subsidiary Digital Science), which only provides \"read-only\" access, and does not allow readers to download, copy, print, or otherwise distribute the content. Additionally, links to these articles can only be generated by \"Nature\" subscribers and a group of selected media outlets—but the links can be publicly distributed through online articles and social networks afterwards. Providers can also provide annotations on the linked articles. The move was designed to counter the trend of \"dark sharing\", while leveraging ReadCube to provide analytics. While considering it a compromise between fully restricted access, critics do not consider this to be a true open access scheme due to its restrictions on use and distribution.\n\nIn 2011, Nature launched its first line of electronic textbooks for the college market, starting with \"Principles of Biology\", which was adopted by California State University.

He grew up and attended school in South Central Los Angeles, graduating from Mid City Alternative Magnet School.\n\nIn the 8th grade, Marshall broke his leg during a football game he was playing with friends and spent the better part of the year being homeschooled while he recuperated, first at Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, and later at home where he spent several months in a full body cast. Marshall later credited this period in his life for preparing him for musical study, as the forced inactivity calmed down his naturally hyperactive personality thus giving him the focus and patience he would need in order to develop as a musician.\n\nMarshall began playing guitar in his teens, counting as musical influences P-Funk (Parliament Funkadelic), Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Brian Setzer of the Stray Cats, Prince, Django Reinhardt, Steven Hufsteter, Matthew Ashman from Bow Wow Wow, the Clash, Michael Jackson, the Talking Heads, Björk, and the Isley Brothers, among many others.\n\nAfter high school, Marshall worked briefly as a messenger for downtown Los Angeles law firms. He has also taught guitar at Los Angeles City College and The Musician's Institute.\n\nAfter performing around Los Angeles with a variety of musicians, Marshall began getting work as a session musician, appearing on recordings for artists such as Tone Loc, Etta James, and Sting. In 1988, he and his brother Lonnie Marshall formed a band they called Marshall Law. They signed a development deal with Island records and recorded a demo for them. The band broke up having only released two tracks on a Ska Parade compilation. After the breakup, Lonnie formed Weapon of Choice. Marshall continued to perform locally in Los Angeles and briefly led his own band, Alpha Jerk, before disbanding it to join the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1992. Marshall Law reunited in 2006 and released an album, \"another X-cuse\".\n\nMarshall joined the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1992 to replace lead guitarist John Frusciante, who quit in the middle of the band's worldwide Blood Sugar Sex Magik Tour. He toured extensively with the band during his tenure as their guitarist and played the Lollapalooza festival of that year. Anthony Kiedis later praised Marshall for being \"a quick study\" and never letting them down onstage. Despite not playing on the recorded songs, Marshall appeared in both of the \"Breaking the Girl\" and \"If You Have to Ask\" music videos.\n\nMarshall's last concert performance with the Red Hot Chili Peppers was the February 9, 1993, but they appeared at the 1993 Grammy Awards ceremony on February 24 to perform \"Give It Away.\" Kiedis later revealed that the group were unable to find the right chemistry with Marshall in their songwriting, specifically Flea. Despite their efforts to collaborate, they found Marshall was not a suitable writing partner. For this reason, Marshall was released from the band and was replaced by Jesse Tobias, who was soon replaced by Dave Navarro.\n\nOn April 14, 2012, the Chili Peppers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Since he did not play on any albums, Marshall was not inducted as a member; however, drummer Chad Smith thanked Marshall along with other former members for their contributions to the band.\n\nAfter his departure from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Marshall joined Macy Gray's band, playing guitar on her releases: \"On How Life Is\" (1999), \"The Id\" (2001) and \"The Trouble With Being Myself\" (2003). As a member of Gray's band, Marshall toured extensively, internationally and in the United States. In 2010, he performed with her at a benefit concert for Haiti.\n\nMarshall contributed to three Weapon of Choice releases: \"Highperspice\" (1996), \"Illoominutty (2002)\" and \"Color Me Funky\" (2004), and appeared on the recordings of Moloko and Poe. He co-wrote a song which was recorded by Rod Stewart in 2003. Other artists he has recorded or performed with include: Chaka Khan, The Prodigy, George Clinton and Parliament Funkadelic, Ice Cube, Björk, Jodeci, Lisa Marie Presley, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, the Circle Jerks and Carlos Santana.\n\nMarshall continued to perform on his own and to work on solo projects, independently producing and releasing four cds: \"Memories of Amnesia\" (2001), \"Fantaseality\" (2003), \"Pleasures of the Funky\" (2005) and \"Heaven's Ghetto\" (2009).\n\nHe self-published a book of poetry in 2008, titled \"B.A.D. Words: the alphabet music of Ah'Reek Marshall\". In 2011, he released a children's book, Bumble-Bee Yourself, a collaboration with illustrator Mimi Kang.\n\nIn 2011 Arik released a music video for \"True To The Almighty\" a single from his Memories of Amnesia cd. He is currently working on a music video for \"Heaven's Ghetto\" single, When the Sound Starts Moving.\n\nMarshall appeared on \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"The Rosie O'Donnell Show\" with Macy Gray. He performed at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards and the 1993 Grammy Awards shows with the Red Hot Chili Peppers.\n\nHe appeared on the \"Simpsons\" episode \"Krusty Gets Kancelled\" as part of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' cameo appearance.\n\nHe appeared in 2002's \"Spider-Man\" movie in a cameo appearance with Macy Gray.\n\nHe acted in and wrote the soundtrack to an Academy Award-winning USC student film, \"Peace & Quiet\". In an interview in 2007, Marshall said of the film, \"I played a mulatto punk-rocker who destroys this old guys suburban home...right in front of him!

The pair were Robert Moog's sales representatives on the U.S. West Coast and were instrumental in popularizing the Moog synthesizer during the late 1960s. As recording artists for Warner Bros. Records in the early 1970s, they released the critically admired albums \"In a Wild Sanctuary\" and \"Gandharva\".\n\nHaving met each other through session work, Paul Beaver and Bernie Krause began collaborating in 1966. Both were drawn to the creative potential of electronic musical instruments. \n\nIn June 1967, Beaver and Krause set up a booth at the Monterey Pop Festival, demonstrating their newly purchased electronic synthesizer, one of the first constructed by Robert Moog. They served as the Moog company's sales representatives on the U.S. West Coast. As such, the pair were able to exploit the growing fascination among rock and pop musicians for the new synthesizer sounds, an interest that was partly influenced by these artists' consumption of hallucinogenic drugs, and the increasingly generous advances they received from their record companies. At Monterey and over the following few years, Beaver and Krause sold the instrument to a number of American pop and rock acts. Beaver introduced Micky Dolenz of the Monkees to the Moog, which became a featured instrument on the band's 1967 album \"Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones Ltd.\" Beaver himself performed on the track \"Star Collector\". In addition, he led workshops at the Beaver & Krause LA studio attended by film composers and session keyboardists.\n\nAmong the other pop and rock artists introduced to the Moog by Beaver and Krause, as part of a vogue that emerged in the late 1960s, were the Byrds, the Doors and Simon & Garfunkel. Krause sold a Moog III to George Martin, producer of the Beatles, and another to George Harrison during the latter's 1968 visit to California, where Harrison was producing an album by Apple Records artist Jackie Lomax. Harrison used the instrument to generate his 1969 solo album \"Electronic Sound\" for the Apple spin-off label Zapple. Side two of this disc consisted of an edited treatment of Krause's initial Moog demonstration, which, according to Krause, Harrison had recorded without his consent.\n\nThe duo were also in demand as film and television soundtrack performers. Among the films featuring music played on the Moog by one or both of the pair were: \"The Graduate\", \"In Cold Blood\", \"Point Blank\" and \"Cool Hand Luke\" (all 1967); \"Rosemary's Baby\", \"Candy\" and \"I Love You, Alice B. Toklas\" (1968); \"They Shoot Horses, Don't They?\" (1969); and \"Catch-22\", \"Performance\" and \"Love Story\" (1970). On these soundtrack projects, Beaver and Krause's contributions were based on other composers' work and vision. According to an announcement in \"Billboard\" magazine, the \"first major film\" to feature a score written by Beaver & Krause was \"The Final Programme\" in 1973.\n\nIn 1968, Beaver & Krause released an album for Mercury Records imprint Limelight Records, \"Ragnarok\". Following their success in popularizing the Moog, they signed with Warner Bros. Records. They recorded three albums for the company: \"In a Wild Sanctuary\" (1970), \"Gandharva\" (1971) and \"All Good Men\" (1972). Writing for \"Saturday Review\" magazine in 1970, Ellen Sandler described \"In a Wild Sanctuary\" as \"a powerful ecological statement in movement and sound\". \"Gandharva\" was partly recorded in Grace Cathedral in San Francisco and included musical contributions from Gerry Mulligan, Bud Shank, Mike Bloomfield and Ronnie Montrose. The album was marketed as \"the score to a non-existent film\" and reflected Hindu mythological themes.\n\nAccording to authors Trevor Pinch and Frank Trocco, the technique used on the \"Wild Sanctuary\" track \"Spaced\"—whereby a single note appears to approach listeners from a distance before resolving in a dramatic chord—was \"copied by a famous Marin County film company\" to introduce its cinema presentations. In Krause's 1998 autobiography, \"Into a Wild Sanctuary: A Life in Music & Natural Sound\", he says that this well-known sound logo begins on the same first note (a G pedal tone) as \"Spaced\", splits into an eight-tone glissando with four notes rising and four descending, and ends on the same open (D Major) chord.\n\nThe duo ended with Beaver's premature death in January 1975, at age 49. At the time he was working on a revised version of \"The Nonesuch Guide\", having released a solo album, \"Perchance to Dream\".<ref name=\"Ankeny/AM\"></ref> Krause then released two solo albums of his own: \"Citadels of Mystery\" in 1979 and \"Gorillas in the Mix\" in 1988. He also scored music and/or effects for many films, including \"Apocalypse Now\", on synthesizer.\n\nKrause subsequently specialized almost exclusively in the recording and archiving of natural soundscapes from wild habitats worldwide and became a major influence in the introduction to bioacoustics of the fields of soundscape ecology and ecoacoustics. In 2014, he collaborated with Richard Blackford, former composer-in-residence at Balliol College Oxford, to compose a symphony titled \"The Great Animal Orchestra Symphony for Orchestra and Wild Soundscapes\", commissioned and performed by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales. The symphony echoed the pioneering ecoacoustic approach of Beaver & Krause's \"In a Wild Sanctuary\", and featured the first full orchestration combining wild soundscapes performed live as a component of orchestration.\n\n"}
{"id": "2212110", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2212110", "title": "Roman Catholic Diocese of Awgu", "text": "Roman Catholic Diocese of Awgu\n\nThe (Roman Catholic) Diocese of Awgu (\"Dioecesis Auguensis\") in Nigeria was created on July 5, 2005, when it was split off from the Diocese of Enugu. It is a suffragan diocese of the Archdiocese of Onitsha. Its first bishop is John Ifeanyichukwu Okoye. The St. Michael Archangel Parish Church in Awgu is the largest church in the diocese and will therefore become its cathedral.\n\nThe Diocese covers an area of 1,310 km² of the Enugu State, covering the local government areas: Awgu, Agbogugu, Inyi, Ndeabor, Nnenwe, Owelli and Oji Rivers (except the parish of Ukwuoba). Neighboring dioceses are Enugu to the north, Abakaliki to the east, Umuahia to the south and Awka to the west.\n\nThe total population in the diocese is 600,000, of which 360,000 are Roman Catholic. The diocese is subdivided into 42 parishes.\n\nFurther Information\n\nThe people of Awgu geographical circumscription were a deeply religious people; who before the advent of\nChristianity in Igboland had a common religious heritage of\na belief in One, Unseen, Omnipotent God. This Almighty\nGod was referred to as Ali Awgu (the Awgu earth goddess).\nNo wonder such popular expressions as \"Ali Awgu Chewe\nNwawu\" (Ali Awgu protect your child) is common among\nAwgu people. This belief and sense of Sacred in this Ali\nAwgu is peculiar to Awgu people. This belief and sense of\nsacred in this Ali Awgu is peculiar to Awgu religious\ntradition permeated and prevailed over the social, moral,\nspiritual, mutual and stereological background of the\npeople before the beginning of the Christian religion.\nThe remotest beginning of the Catholic presence in the\nAwgu division dates back to the acts of the French catholic\nMissionaries that came to Eastern Nigeria under Fr. J. E.\nLutz in 1885 pitching their first tent at Holy trinity in\nOnitsha. The evangelical activities of these French Holy\nGhost missionaries spread to Enugu Section and\nconsequently to Awgu sub-section by the early years of 20th\ncentury. The missionary development in Awgu came\nmainly from Eke town in Udi division, and partly from\nUturu in Okigwe. What we call Awgu Diocese today is\ntherefore a historical effect of synthetic, missionary roles\nand contributes from Eke and Uturu Catholic Missions.\nAs early as 1912, Chief Onyeama (the warrant paramount\nChief of Eke town) in his bid to attract Western Education\nfor his children and people, had gathered a handful of\npeople (Catechumen) amidst the already existing Anglican\nadherents that were found around Eke and Abor towns.\nDiocesan Directory 7.\nHis invitation to the Catholic Missionaries brought Fr.\nJoseph Shanahan to Eke in 1914; who laid the first\nfoundation of the old Eke Parish/School out of which\nsprang the spread of other Catholic Missions in the current\nEnugu part of Eastern Nigeria. As the incumbent and first\nBishop of Awgu, Rt. Rev. Dr. J. I. Okoye wrote in his B.D.\nThesis, Christianity in Mbanabo, its Advent growth, and\nFuture, \"It was indeed at Eke that the religious tree which\nspread its branches to other parts of Enugu Diocese was\nplanted, watered and nurtured\". Eke Parish was the cradle\nof the faith that has today become the Diocese of Nsukka,\nAbakaliki, Makurdi, Oturkpo, Ogoja, and Enugu. It was in\n1921 that the Roman Catholic Mission set up a School/Church at Oke-Oli Ali-Awgu (St. Michael's Awgu)\nwhich attracted over 100 converts in less than one year.\nThey were received and harbored by Late Chief Chukwunta\nNwachumolie. The first teacher to St. Michael's\nSchool/Church, Awgu, one Mr. Ofodiamah from Ogwashi\nuku of the present Delta State of Nigeria. And the first Holy\nMass at St. Michael's Awgu was at Oke-Ali-Ohaja Awgu by\nRev. Fr. Grandin.\nOn the other hand, the missionary movement into Awgu\nfrom Uturu, Okigwe was orchestrated by the\nexistence/construction of railway line from Enugu to Port\nHarcourt in 1915. This made that Ndeabor Railway\nStations a whirlpool of so many itineraries, mercantile and\neven evangelical interactions. This created and provided a pastoral relationship between St. Michael's Awgu and the\nRoman Catholic Mission at Uturu, Okigwe (which was\nnearer to Awgu than Eke) which was already established in\n1912. In 1926, Rev. Fr. Treich, the first priest to minister to\nthe faithful at St. Michael's Church, Awgu from Uturu\nprepared Catechumen who received their First Holy\nDiocesan Directory 8.\nCommunion on 21 October 1926. However, given the\nfoundation of another Church in Awgu region at Mmaku,\nwhich was raised to a parish status in 1922, St. Michael's\nAwgu was under Mmaku Parish until 1948 when she was\nmade a parish too. Out of these two sources (Eke and\nUturu), the church continued to spread in Awgu areas with\njoyful yet uneasy circumstances, on both sides of the\nmissionaries and mission converts. There were days of\nthug-of-war between native ancestral religion and\nChristianity and of oscillation of people from old traditional\ncivilization and the emerging one that is Christian and\nexotic. Given limited pastors and prevalent pressures from\nconflicting old and new faiths, it was really martyrdom like\nand heroic to be a Christian then. But it was out of these\nrocky roots that today we rejoice to the harvest of a young,\nbuoyant and vibrant Awgu ecclesiastical circumscription.\nAwgu was created a diocese by Pope Benedict\nXVI on the 8th of July, 2005. On the 29th day of September,\nit was canonically erected and Most Rev. John\nIfeanyichukwu Okoye ordained and enthroned as its first\nbishop.\n\n"}

In his two seasons with the Kansas City Chiefs, Delaney set four franchise records that would stand for more than 20 years.\n\nHe was a two-time All-American athlete for the Northwestern State Demons football team, as well as a track and field star. Delaney played two seasons with the Chiefs and was chosen as the AFC Rookie of the Year in 1981 by United Press International.\n\nDelaney died on June 29, 1983 while attempting to rescue three children from drowning in a pond in Monroe in northeastern Louisiana. He was posthumously awarded the Presidential Citizen's Medal from U.S. President Ronald W. Reagan. While not officially retired, his jersey number while playing for the Chiefs, No. 37, has not been worn since his death.\n\nThe third of Woodrow and Eunice Delaney's eight children, Delaney was born in Henderson, on October 30, 1958, and attended Haughton High School in Bossier Parish in northwestern Louisiana. Discouraged by his father from pursuing his dreams of playing football, Delaney became the starting wide receiver by his junior year at Haughton. Major Division I schools that scouted him included Grambling State, Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana State.\n\nDelaney played for Division I-AA's Northwestern State Demons from 1977 to 1980. After telling his coach of his willingness to play football at the collegiate level, Delaney switched to the running back position. He went on to be an All-American selection in 1979 and 1980. While at Northwestern State, Delaney met his future wife, Carolyn, and they had two children by his senior year.\n\nOn October 28, 1978, Delaney carried the ball 28 times and gained 299 yards for Northwestern State against Nicholls State University with 263 of the yards coming in the game's second half. Delaney's rushing stats in the second half of the game are an NCAA record. In the same game, he scored four touchdowns, one of which was on a 90-yard run, as he led his team to a 28–18 victory.\n\nDelaney finished his career at Northwestern State with 3,047 yards rushing, 31 touchdowns, and 188 points. In 1980, his senior season, he was ranked eighth in the nation in all-purpose rushing yards. On November 22, 1980 he played his last game at Northwestern State and the school retired his jersey, number 44, at halftime. Delaney was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1997.\n\nAt Northwestern State, Delaney also starred in track. In high school, he ran the 100 yard dash in 9.4 seconds and was on the Northwestern State track and field team, which won the NCAA 400-meter relay in 1981. He holds the school 200 meter dash record with a time of 20.64 seconds.\n\nDelaney was selected in the second round of the 1981 NFL Draft by the Kansas City Chiefs. United Press International named him Rookie of the Year of the American Football Conference for the 1981 NFL season after he rushed for 1,121 yards, set four club records, and averaged 80.9 yards a game. Delaney's effort helped propel the Chiefs to a 9–7 record, the team's first winning season since 1973. In his rookie season, he was selected to the Pro Bowl after setting Chiefs records for most yards in a season (1,121), most yards in a game (193 vs. Houston), most consecutive 100-yard-plus games (three) and most 100-yard games in a season (five).\n\nAfter coming off the bench to record 101 rushing yards in his initial NFL action at New England, he ran for 106 yards and registered 104 receiving yards in his first professional start against Oakland. In the Chiefs' October 18, 1981 game against the Denver Broncos, Delaney broke loose for a 75-yard touchdown run, but an offside penalty caused the play to be restarted from five yards back. On the second play after the penalty, Delaney scored an 82-yard touchdown, the longest rushing play from scrimmage in the 1981 NFL season.\n\nFollowing Delaney's record-setting 196-yard rushing performance against the Houston Oilers on November 15, 1981, Oilers defensive end (and future Pro Football Hall of Famer) Elvin Bethea was quoted in saying:\n\nA strike by NFL players and an eye injury limited Delaney's playing time in the 1982 NFL season. He underwent surgery to repair a detached retina, and only registered 380 rushing yards in the eight-game shortened season, which the Chiefs finished with a 3–6 record. Delaney averaged 4.6 yards per carry, 9.1 yards per reception, and registered 1,811 all-purpose yards during his career with three touchdowns.\n\nDelaney had a lifelong history of helping others, and once paid for the funeral of a former teacher whose family could not afford a proper service. On June 29, 1983, Delaney, who was living in nearby Ruston, went with friends to Critter's Creek, an amusement center at Chennault Park in Monroe, Louisiana. While reportedly discouraging swimming children from venturing too far out in a pond, Delaney dove in to save three children who were screaming for help, floundering in a water hole left by recent construction work. The water hole, which covered two acres and was six feet deep, was not intended for swimming but to add to the park's aesthetics. Despite his inability to swim, Delaney nevertheless tried to rescue the children. One child managed to get out of the water without harm and another was taken to an emergency room where he later died; police recovered the body of Delaney and the remaining child. The amusement park has since been closed to the public.\nThree thousand people attended Delaney's burial and memorial service on July 4 which was held in the sweltering heat of the Haughton High School gymnasium. Many fanned themselves with fans provided from the funeral home to combat the oppressive heat. President Ronald Reagan honored Delaney with the Presidential Citizens Medal on July 15, and it was presented to Delaney's family by Vice President George H. W. Bush. Reagan's words were:\n\nFor the 1983 NFL season, the Chiefs honored Delaney by wearing a circular patch bearing a gold eagle and the number 37 on the upper-left chest of their uniforms. Haughton High School also made a park, Joe Delaney Park, in his memory. The NCAA posthumously awarded Delaney the NCAA Award of Valor in 1984. Louisiana Governor Dave Treen presented the Louisiana State Civilian Bravery Award to Delaney's family following his death.\n\nDelaney's heroism is honored through an award for one of the NFL's best running backs who also demonstrates admirable character and unselfishness, traits that were embodied by Delaney. The award is given annually by ProFootballTalk.com.\n\nNorthwestern State's football permanent team captains award, the Joe Delaney Memorial Leadership award, is named in his honor, as is the annual spring football game (\"Delaney Bowl\") and a golf tournament that generates support for the athletic program. A permanent shrine honoring him sits under the home stands at Northwestern State's Turpin Stadium and his number 44 jersey hangs in the football offices. In Virginia, the Delaney Athletic Conference took its name to honor his memory in the fall of 1983, and today 13 Virginia private high schools comprise the DAC.\n\nA group of Chiefs fans in Kansas City formed the \"37Forever Foundation\", which works with the American Red Cross to provide swimming lessons for underprivileged children. The Kansas City Chiefs unofficially retired Delaney's jersey number 37 following his death, and he was elected to the team's Hall of Fame in 2004. His name is included in the Chiefs' ring of honor at Arrowhead Stadium. Delaney is also the uncle of LSU wide receiver Terrace Marshall Jr.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2212134", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2212134", "title": "Fabled Lands", "text": "Fabled Lands\n\nFabled Lands is a series of fantasy gamebooks written by established gamebook authors Dave Morris and Jamie Thomson and published by Pan Books, a division of Macmillan in the mid 1990s. Cover art was by Kevin Jenkins with Russ Nicholson and Arun Pottier providing maps and illustrations.\n\nOriginally planned as a twelve-book series, only six were released between 1995 and 1996 before the series was cancelled. The first two books were also printed under the name \"Quest\" in the U.S. by publishers Price Stern Sloan. Beginning in July 2015, the makers of Fabled Lands launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund completion of Book Seven; the Kickstarter campaign hit its base target within the first 45 minutes it was online.\n\nThe books are now back in print and available on Amazon as of December 2010. \n\nTwo iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch applications were developed by Megara Entertainment. The first app, based on \"The War-Torn Kingdom\", included new colour art and original coloured in art from Russ Nicholson, and was released on January 20, 2011. The second app was released in June, 2011. Following Megara's decision to withdraw from app development in 2012, digital rights reverted to the authors and the apps were withdrawn from sale.\n\nA Fabled Lands Role Playing Game and 12 source books based on the original game books were planned to be written by Shane Garvey and Jamie Wallis of Greywood Publishing, however only the core book and the first source book (titled \"Sokara - The War-Torn Kingdom\") were released. The RPG rules were based on the original rules of the game books but expanded to accommodate an adventuring party in a pen-and-paper roleplaying context, rather than as a gamebook experience for a solo player. The RPG and first of the source books were released in mid-2011.\n\nThe books deviated from other mainstream gamebooks (such as the Fighting Fantasy or Lone Wolf series) in a number of ways. The most notable of these was the open-ended, free roaming gameplay. Other gamebooks gave the character a linear quest, with some leniency in how they went about accomplishing it; when they completed the quest, the gamebook ended. The Fabled Lands series gave the player an entire fantasy world to roam around in, doing whatever they wished with no limits or linearity; there was no set quest and there is no way to \"finish\" the series (unless the player dies). There are hundreds of quests in the six books that were published, of varying lengths. The player is free to pursue these at their leisure, or spend their time doing entirely different things - wandering, trading, exploring or building up their abilities.\n\nEach book contained a different geographic area of the Fabled Lands, and the player could easily travel between regions by switching to another book. The books became increasingly difficult as they progressed, with tougher enemies and harder quests; this was to account for the player becoming more powerful as they went through each book.\n\nOther differences between previous gamebook series included:\n\nAlthough the final six books in the series have never been published (or even written), Dave Morris has indicated in the past that he is interested in reviving the series:\nOn September 13, 2010, Dave Morris indicated that the series had a possible chance of a revival on his blog, saying, in response to a fan query about the future of the fabled lands and particularly the book \"The Serpent King's Domain\", \"My lips are sealed, though I will say that Frank Johnson, the head of Fabled Lands LLP, was throwing those same words around last week. He might even have thrown in a labyrinth and some legions :)\". In a later announcement, Morris indicated that the publisher was willing to greenlight the production of books 7-12 of the series, provided that the reprintings of books 1-6 each sold approximately ten thousand copies.\n\nIn 2015, Book 7 of the series, titled \"The Serpent-King's Domain,\" was funded successfully via a Kickstarter campaign. Series creators Morris and Thomson did not write Book 7, but were involved with the Kickstarter campaign, and Thomson appeared in-person in a promotional video for the Kickstarter campaign. Paul Gresty wrote Book 7, and Mikaël Louys and Richard S. Hetley co-produced. Russ Nicholson returned to provide illustrations and Kevin Jenkins returned to create the cover of Book 7. A playable demo of Book 7 was made available to the public for free download via the Kickstarter campaign page. In 2016, Morris revealed the map of Ankon-Konu, the setting for Book 7, on the Fabled Lands blog. Book 7 is currently available for purchase at Amazon.com.\n\nThe Fabled Lands system was fairly simple, as with most other gamebooks. The player has six basic attributes:\n\n\nThe player's initial score in each of these six attributes is determined by their chosen profession. There are six different professions to choose from: Warrior, Mage, Priest, Rogue, Troubadour and Wayfarer (a wandering traveller, most similar to Rangers in other fantasy systems). Each profession is proficient or weak in different abilities; for example, Priests have high SANCTITY but low COMBAT scores, and Wayfarers have high SCOUTING but low CHARISMA scores. The player has opportunities to increase these abilities throughout the books by completing quests. For example, after successfully tracking down a wild boar in a forest, the player can roll two dice, and if they score higher than their SCOUTING ability they can increase it by 1. No ability can be raised higher than 12, or drop below 1.\n\nWhen the player is given the opportunity to use an ability, the task is given a Difficulty rating. The player rolls two dice and adds their score in the ability; to succeed in the task, they must score higher than the difficulty. For example, a player wishes to calm down an angry innkeeper. This might have a CHARISMA score of 9, and the player's CHARISMA ability is 3. The player would have to roll 7 or higher to succeed. It is possible to obtain \"blessings\" in various abilities from different shrines and temples, which allow the player to reroll failed ability rolls. These work once only, however, and cost money.\n\nCombat in the Fabled Lands is an extension of ability rolls; the enemy's DEFENSE is the Difficulty, and the player uses their COMBAT skill to try to defeat their opponent. The amount the player rolls above the enemy's DEFENSE is how many Stamina points the enemy loses.\n\nThe player's own DEFENSE score is equal to their Rank + their COMBAT score + the bonus for any armor they are wearing (if any). Their own Stamina score is given when they begin playing, and can be increased by going up in Rank (which gives them 1d6 Stamina).\n\nThe player's starting Rank is equal to the number of the book they begin in (e.g. a player starting in \"The War-Torn Kingdom\" begins at 1st Rank, while a player starting in \"Lords of the Rising Sun\" begins at 6th Rank). The player can increase Rank by performing extremely difficult tasks, such as slaying a dragon or defeating three samurai in unarmed combat (the book will tell the player when they can increase in Rank).\n\nThe player can carry up to 12 possessions, which are marked in bold text (e.g. \"gold compass\"). Some items give ability bonuses - for example, an \"amber wand (MAGIC +1)\" or a set of \"splint armour (DEFENCE + 4)\". The player can carry unlimited amounts of cash.\n\nThe series feature a number of smaller quests, which can help the player increase their personal might, status and wealth. Many of these, however, are profession-specific: In the \"War-Torn Kingdom\", for instance, only a Wayfarer will get the Chief Druid's mission on the Druid's Isle, while in \"The Plains of Howling Darkness\" only a Rogue may claim the title of 'Nightstalker'.\n\n\"Sokara, a nation at war with itself\"\n\nSet in the land of Sokara, shortly after a civil war in which the king was overthrown in a military coup. This background provides the book's two major quests; the player can choose to either help the heir to the throne and his band of partisans regain power, or assist the new leader General Grieve Marlock in crushing the last few pockets of resistance.\n\nOther quests involve assassinating the king of the rat-men infesting the sewers in the city of Yellowport, looting treasure from the lair of Vayss the Sea Dragon, delivering packages between the druids of the City of Trees and the Forest of Larun, defeating the Black Dragon Knight in combat to the death and rescuing a trapped god from the summit of Devil's Peak.\n\n679 sections, \n\n\"Golnir, a wealthy land steeped in curious folklore\"\n\nSet in the prosperous kingdom of Golnir, wealthy from its rich agriculture. A common complaint readers had about the second book was that it was far more difficult to find quests than in the first book. There are still several major quests, however, including slaying a dragon for the Baroness Ravayne (the ruler of Golnir), searching for magical artefacts for the wizard Estragon, bringing to justice a murderer on behalf of his victim's ghost, finding the key of stars to gain access to a treasure filled tomb in the Forest of the Forsaken and making a map of the northern mountains.\n\nThe quests in the second book have a more whimsical, fairy tale nature to them than those in the first book. This gives Golnir a very strong Merry England atmosphere.\n\n786 sections, \n\n\"Swashbuckling adventure on the high seas\"\n\nSet in the Violet Ocean, which separates the northern continent of Harkuna from the southern continent of Ankon-Konu. Travel is severely restricted without a ship, making it a difficult book to start off in, particularly for less experienced gamebook readers. \"Over the Blood-Dark Sea\" is also one of the first in the series to feature regular danger - the player is almost always at risk of pirates, storms and even sea monsters. \n\nKey quests include assassinating Amcha, king of the pirates, enrolling at a wizard's college in the city of Dweomer to learn magic, searching for buried treasure on hidden islands and climbing the enormous mountain on Starspike Island. \n\n718 sections, \n\n\"The desolate wastes of the Great Steppes\"\n\nSet in the Great Steppes, an environment of grasslands, plains and tundra similar to Siberia and Mongolia. Key quests include liberating the Citadel of Veris Corin for the King of Sokara (closely linked with quests in \"The War-Torn Kingdom\"), releasing the King of Harkuna from his prison underneath the Rimewater (closely linked with quests in \"The Court of Hidden Faces\") and killing the immortal tyrant Kaschuf (based on the legend of Koschei the Deathless) who rules over the village of Vodhya (which requires the player to find and release his soul, hidden on an island in \"Over The Blood-Dark Sea\").\n\nThis was the first book in the series to introduce the concept of a harsh environment - out on the Steppes, the player must make constant SCOUTING rolls in order to find enough food, and on the northern steppes the player loses one point of stamina a day from the cold, unless they have a wolf pelt to keep warm.\n\n710 sections, \n\n\"Exotic intrigue in Uttaku and Old Harkuna\"\n\nSet in the nation of Uttaku (similar to the Byzantine Empire), which is occupying the kingdom of Old Harkuna (similar to the lands of Arthurian legend). If the player frees the king of Old Harkuna from his prison in \"The Plains of Howling Darkness\", the king can reclaim his land, end the Uttaku occupation and restore prosperity. There is also an abandoned castle in Harkuna which the player can rebuild and claim for himself. Most other major quests involve undertaking tasks for the Uttakin government (the titular Court).\n\nThe book takes its title from Uttaku's court of ruling nobles, who wear elaborate masks as a status symbol and to hide their faces. The king himself is born without a face at all.\n\n723 sections, \n\n\"Imperial Akatsurai, land of samurai and ninja\"\n\nSet in a land which is an obvious parallel of classical Japan of the Heian period. Much like \"The War Torn Kingdom\", a revolution is occurring. The self-proclaimed Shogun Yoritomo has declared himself in charge of the eastern seaboard, while the young Imperial Sovereign Takakura rules the country nominally, with real power being in the hands of the chancellor, Lord Kiyomori, who remains in control of the western seaboard. The country is on the brink of a civil war (like Japan during the Genpei War to which the names \"Yoritomo\" and \"Kiyomori\" allude). Although the player can undertake quests for both sides of the revolution, the two forces never actually begin war as they do in the first book.\n\nOther major quests involving retrieving a tatsu pearl from a great dragon, exploring Kwaidan Forest to learn the secrets of the tengu, and venturing into the Black Pagoda.\n\n750 sections, \n\n\"The lost tribes of the Feathered Lands\"\n\nSet in the jungles of the southern continent of Ankon-Konu, a land similar to South America. \n\nThis book was not published in the 1990s, but in 2018 after a successful Kickstarter campaign. It was written by Paul Gresty. The spirit realm, Elaz Carnquen, hangs closely over this world, which allows you travel into the spirit realm and engage in spiritual comba using a new value called \"Nahual.\" Due to the excessive heat of Ankon-Konu, many types of armor (such as plate armor) handicap the player's COMBAT value if worn, and other types of armor (such as cotton armor) provide lower defense bonuses without handicaps to a player's COMBAT value. Quests include activating the titan at Borotek, restoring order at Ruined Tarshesh over who was to blame for its fall, defeating the Serpent King, Namagal (which requires some mini-quests on its own), and merging with the verdant spire, which allows dominance over the land itself.\n\n1200 sections, \n\n\"The harsh deserts of western Ankon-konu\"\n\nThis book was never published, but it would have been set in the Desert of Bones, in Ankon-Konu. This presumably would have been the Fabled Lands' equivalent of the Sahara. Notes from David Morris indicate the region is home to genii and inspired by the Thousand and One Arabian Nights. It also featured the Blue Grasslands, which according to information in the first six books is populated by blue-skinned nomads - descendants of the Uttakin featured in \"The Court Of Hidden Faces\" - and tribes like the Golden men and their flying arks. Other locations would have been the City of Stargazers, and the Country of the Hidden Ones - judging from information in the first six books, and the names on the map, it would have been similar to the Himalayan countries of Nepal, Tibet and Bhutan.\n\nThe phrase 'the lone and level sands' appears in Shelley's poem \"Ozymandias\".\n\n\"Chrysoprais and the Sea of Stilts\"\n\nThis book was never published, but it would have been set (as the subtitle implies) in the western locations of Chrysoprais and the Sea of Stilts.\n\nChrysoprais presumably would have been very similar to India; the names on the maps have an Indian flavour (for example, the Crimson Fort rather than the Red Fort). Also, a few clues are left in the first six books regarding the culture of Chrysoprais - for example, in the Japanese-inspired land of Akatsurai featured in \"Lords of the Rising Sun\", there is a religion following the \"Sage of Peace\" which is clearly based on Buddhism. If the player fails in a quest relating to the Sage of Peace, they can travel west to \"the saint of Vulture Peak\" (found in Chrysoprais) to seek redemption and enlightenment. This suggests that people in both Chrysoprais and Akatsurai worship the Sage of Peace; in real life, Buddhism originated in India and later spread to Japan.\n\n\"Philosopher kings of the west\"\n\nThis book was never published, but would have been set in the western lands of Atticala. Atticala was clearly inspired by Ancient Greece; the map of the Fabled Lands reveals this, as many of the towns have Greek-sounding names and are symbolised by Greek architecture.\n\nThe name \"Atticala\" is also similar to \"Attica\", a region of Greece.\n\n\"Danger in the heart of a vast metropolis\"\n\nThis book was never published, but was to have been set in the city of Dangor in the mysterious \"Forbidden Realm.\" It is not known how the book would have been structured to fit within a single city - all other Fabled Lands books were spread over an entire landscape, with many cities and towns in between.\n\nVery little is known about Dangor, except that it is situated at the top of cliffs hundreds of metres high called \"The Golden Cliffs.\" Dangor's harbour is apparently at the very top of these cliffs, with the rest of the city. In \"Over The Blood Dark Sea\", the player can read the account of a Sokaran sailor in the library of Dweomer. He recounts of how his ship waited for three days at the bottom of the cliffs, while a mountain climber took their documents to the port authorities above. When all was found to be in order, \"grapples were lowered and secured and the whole vessel was winched up to the docks a thousand feet above.\"\n\nDangor may have been inspired by the near East, as it is symbolized by what appears to be a near Eastern palace on the map.\n\n\"The ultimate journey\"\n\nThis book was never published, but it would have been set in the underworld of the Fabled Lands. Whether the authors intended for this to be a series of caves and caverns or a literal Hell (or both) is uncertain; there are many entrances to the twelfth book throughout the first six. Some of these are through caves and tunnels, while others are through magical gateways, by falling off the edge of the world (in both of these instances the player is told that they will arrive in \"Hell\"), or even board a ship in a celestial harbor.\n\nA series of magical gateways found throughout the books allows the player to travel instantaneously to the many cities of the Fabled Lands, including those in books that were never published. One of these was called \"Erebus\" and sent the player to the twelfth book. In Greek mythology, Erebus was a god associated with the underworld.\n\nScott Malthouse of \"The Trollish Delver\" gave the \"Fabled Lands\" series a positive review based upon a playthrough of Book 1, remarking that \"Fabled Lands is nothing short of astonishing. It presents a living world that you can do pretty much what you want in. With other books added to your repertoire there is seemingly no end to the adventures that you can have in this fantasy world.\"\n\nSteve Faragher reviewed the \"Fabled Lands\" series for \"Arcane\" magazine, rating it a 5 out of 10 overall. Faragher comments that \"All in all, these books represent a pleasant but ultimately unchallenging diversion for younger players. A better option would be to get someone older to run a simple \"AD&D\" game.\" \n\nByron Alexander Campbell of \"Entropy\" magazine gave the \"Fabled Lands\" series a more positive review based upon a playthrough of Book 5, remarking \"It’s not perfect, of course – there’s a bit too much ticking and erasing boxes, especially when death is always so close on your heels – but damn if it’s not satisfying. For reasons I can’t quite describe, being able to trace roads and geographic features on a map and read my way through those same locations, but full of people, weather and birdsong, just feels great... One of the most enticing things about Fabled Lands is the way that every book provides a way in. Each book is a microcosm of the same world, and while they get progressively more challenging with each successive release, there is nothing narratively that compels you to read them in order.\"\n\nIn 1996, the authors decided to use their experience with gamebooks to enter the computer games industry – taking the Fabled Lands series with them. They started work at Eidos Interactive on an MMO. Eidos was sceptical as to whether an MMO could be successful, but was interested to see what might happen, and set the authors up with a team to research the relevant technology. The team's plans for the game were extremely ambitious for the late 1990s, as the Fabled Lands MMO was supposed to include an advanced AI that acted as a digital gamesmaster, tailoring the experience for each player. \nThe game was never released; according to Morris and Thomson, this was caused by their own over-ambitious designs, colleagues who didn't understand their ideas and the general poor management of game design and development at the time.\n\n\n"}

Chimel then began announcing duties for the company in 1989, working mostly televised B-Shows or non-televised house shows and filling in for Howard Finkel whenever necessary, including appearances on \"Raw\".\n\nChimel was the \"SmackDown!\" ring announcer from its inception in 1999. He was also the ring announcer at \"SmackDown\" brand pay-per-views from 2002-2007. He defeated Howard Finkel for the rights to be \"SmackDown!\" announcer in 1999 in a tuxedo match.\n\nOn Kurt Angle's final episode as \"SmackDown\" General Manager in 2004, he demanded Chimel to come into the ring and give an apology to him; Chimel complied but then was fired by Angle. He was almost immediately re-hired by Vince McMahon.\nFrom 2005 to 2007 Chimel was involved in a mini-feud with Mr. Kennedy, who claimed that Chimel was not announcing his name with the proper respect that it deserved. This feud included Chimel being punched, being \"told to take a bow\" (hit in the groin), and having a doughnut shoved in his mouth by Kennedy.\n\nOn the December 22, 2006 episode of \"SmackDown\", he announced The Boogeyman as victorious too enthusiastically and caught his attention. The Boogeyman forced worms into his mouth as a result. Chimel ran away from the ring afterwards. This was a storyline for Chimel to take some time off to rest his nagging back injury and spend more time with his family. ECW announcer Justin Roberts was the ring announcer of \"SmackDown\" until Chimel returned on April 13, 2007.\n\nIn 2007, Chimel swapped ring announcing duties with Justin Roberts, becoming the ring announcer for the \"ECW\" brand. Chimel began announcing on WWE Superstars, and made his first appearance on the April 30, 2009 episode. After Justin Roberts left SmackDown to become the new ring announcer for the Raw brand, Chimel left ECW and returned to SmackDown for his second stint as ring announcer. He then became the announcer of the ECW brand when the last ECW announcer, Lauren Mayhew, quickly left the WWE, before returning to SmackDown.\n\nDuring this time, Chimel began to gain a reputation for his announcements for Edge, who had recently dubbed himself \"The Rated-R Superstar\". During these announcements, Chimel's voice would frequently crack while saying the word \"superstar\". This would become something of a running joke on WWE TV, leading to Chimel making guest appearances solely to announce Edge.\n\nHe was demoted from SmackDown when former Raw announcer Lilian Garcia returned to the WWE in December 2011. At the December 27 taping of \"SmackDown\", \"NXT\", & \"Superstars\", it was revealed that Chimel would be announcing for \"NXT\" and the \"SmackDown\" portion of \"Superstars\", replacing the departing Eden Stiles. Chimel announced for \"NXT\" until the end of the final season of its original run.\n\nHe was the ring announcer for \"Main Event\" as well as for WWE live events until June 24, 2014, and he was the ring announcer for the short-lived \"Saturday Morning Slam\". He briefly returned to \"Raw\" on September 9, 2013, and \"SmackDown\" on September 13, 2013, to announce the returning Edge to the ring. On November 16, 2013 at a WWE live event in the United Kingdom, Chimel delivered a stunner to Curtis Axel after Axel forced Chimel to announce that Axel was still the Intercontinental Champion following Axel's win over R-Truth. Afterward, Chimel was kissed by one of the Bella Twins. On the May 14, 2014 episode of \"Main Event\", Tony was attacked by Alicia Fox during her meltdown after she lost to Emma. On the December 29 episode of \"Raw\", Chimel returned to announce Edge and Christian. He would also announce their appearances on the December 30 episode of \"Main Event\" and the January 2, 2015 episode of \"SmackDown.\"\n\nChimel later took a hiatus from announcing with WWE. During the hiatus, he announced at house shows only.\n\nChimel returned to WWE television on the December 28, 2015 edition of \"Raw\". He would return at Fastlane 2016 to introduce Edge and Christian. Chimel has since been reserved, only to introduce Edge whenever he appeared on television.\n\nChimel once again returned to WWE television on November 15, 2016 during the 900th episode of SmackDown. At this appearance, he did his trademark introduction of Edge, before the Cutting Edge segment. Chimel returned during Beth Phoenix's induction in the 2017 WWE Hall of Fame to announce her husband Edge's name.\n\nChimel now works primarily behind the scenes for WWE, working as a production manager and as part of the ring crew.\n\nChimel appears in the video games WWE Day of Reckoning 2, WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006, WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2007, WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008, WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2009, WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2010, WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2011, WWE '12, WWE Wrestlefest, WWE '13, WWE 2K15 as part of the \"One More Match\" & \"The Hall of Pain\" DLC packs, and WWE 2K16 for SmackDown! in the 3:16 Showcase.\n\nChimel named his son Joey after Joey Marella, a referee and the adopted son of Gorilla Monsoon, who was killed in an automobile accident. He was once taken out by stretcher after being superkicked by Shawn Michaels ringside during his Iron Man match against Bret Hart at WrestleMania XII in 1996.\n\n"}

Founded in 1947, NYSAIS is the second largest state association of independent schools in the United States. As of July 1, 2019 its member schools enrolled approximately 83,024 students. It was established \"\"to protect independent schools from obstructive legislation and regulation\"\". NYSAIS accredits member schools, provides professional development, and works with community leaders to support the needs and interests of independent schools throughout the state. NYSAIS is a member of the National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS) as well the International Council Advancing Independent School Accreditation (ICAISA).\n\n\"The New York State Association of Independent Schools promotes the independence, well-being, and public understanding of, and respect for, New York independent schools and serves as an accrediting body chartered by the New York State Board of Regents.\"\n\nTo accomplish its mission, the New York State Association of Independent Schools:\n\n\nThe New York State Association of Independent Schools is governed by a Board of Trustees which meets on a regular basis, including an annual meeting at Mohonk Mountain House on the first Wednesday of November. In 2019-2020, the President of the NYSAIS Board of Trustees is Jane Foley Fried, Head of School, The Brearley School, New York City. Dr. Mark W. Lauria has been Executive Director of NYSAIS since 2009.\nPast Presidents of NYSAIS include James Dawson (Professional Children's School), Jody Douglass (Buffalo Seminary), Scott Gaynor (Stephen Gaynor School), Stephen Watters (Green Vale School), Stephen M. Clement III (The Browning School), Rick Bryan (Nichols School), Drew Castertano (Millbrook School), Dorothy A.

Shafer, President of the Packer Collegiate Institute in Brooklyn sent out a letter to ten colleagues at other New York independent schools to discuss the founding of an association for New York independent schools. Those who received the letter were;\nThe New York State Association of Independent Schools held its first official meeting on October 8, 1947, at the Albany Academies. At the meeting on October 8, 1947, it was moved by Mr. Bradlee and seconded by Mr. Amos that they \"set up the nucleus of a State organization (and) that the name be the New York State Association of Independent Schools (whose) membership...shall be limited to those elementary and secondary schools organized under a State charter as non-profit institutions.\"\n\nThe first Annual Meeting of NYSAIS was held on January 18, 1949, at the Emma Willard School in Troy. The first officers were Paul Shafer (President), Anne Wellington (Vice-President), and Harry E. P. Meislahn (Secretary-Treasurer). The first guest at a NYSAIS meeting was Dr. Henry V. Gilson, New York's Associate Commissioner of Education.\n\nOn October 25, 1968, NYSAIS was incorporated under a provisional charter granted by the New York State Board of Regents. The provisional charter required that NYSAIS draft a constitution and that a Board of Trustees be established. This was accomplished at the 20th Annual Meeting which was held on November 12, 1968, at Schrafft's Motor Inn in Albany. At this meeting, President Walter Clark announced the appointment of the first Executive Director, Appleton A. Mason Jr., who had previously served as the Headmaster of the Lake Forest Country Day School in Lake Forest, Illinois. The first official office for NYSAIS was at Appleton Mason's home in Loudonville, New York.\n\n\nNYSAIS has four membership categories:\n\n\nAccording to the NYSAIS Charter, issued on February 25, 1984, the association has \"\"authority to evaluate and accredit schools in the State of New York (which) is conferred by charter from the Regents of the University of New York.\"\" All good schools continually evaluate their performance by means of their own devising, but the view a school takes of itself needs periodically to be supplemented by an external view, one that brings a perspective the school cannot command.\n\nFormal evaluation combines self-scrutiny with external review by a committee of peers, both processes being guided by the NYSAIS Manual for Evaluation and Accreditation. \"The Manual gives structure, direction, and scope to the undertaking that goes beyond that which a school might ordinarily elect. The external review brings observations, comments and suggestions possible only for those who are not immersed in the daily concerns of a school’s life.\"\n\nThe object in evaluation is to assist the school to better realize its objectives, to support rather than to inspect and to enhance the school's unique character rather than to impose a common design. Thus, a school is evaluated in terms of its own purposes and objectives, not those of some remote authority.\n\nThe accreditation of the NYSAIS schools is overseen by the NYSAIS Commission on Accreditation, chaired by Bart Baldwin (St. Luke's School). The past chairs were Kate Turley (City and Country School) and William G. Morris, Jr. (Friends Academy). The NYSAIS Associate Directors who oversee NYSAIS Accreditation are Dr. Judith Sheridan and George Swain.\n\nNYSAIS is a member of the International Council Advancing Independent School Accreditation (ICAISA).\n\nNYSAIS organizes conferences, workshops, and residential institutes for teachers, school heads, trustees, assistant and division heads, business and financial managers, and administrators. Most of the residential conferences are held at Mohonk Mountain House in New Paltz or the Carey Center for Global Good in Rensselaerville.\n\nNYSAIS professional learning includes approximately 95 multi-day residential conferences and day-long workshops including the Beginning Teachers Institutes (BTI), Experienced Teachers Institutes (ETI), Emerging Leaders Institutes (ELI), Division Leaders Institute (DLI), the Justice, Equity, and Diversity Institute, as well as topical workshops and conferences for teachers and administrators. Some are collaborative efforts with neighboring state associations of independent schools. NYSAIS professional development provides timely opportunities for education and networking. NYSAIS residential professional learning is directed by Associate Director, Barbara Swanson. The NYSAIS institutes and workshops are directed by Associate Director, Marcy Mann.\n\nThe NYSAIS Experienced Leaders Advising Schools (ELAS) program is a mission-driven initiative established in 2012 to meet a growing need from member schools. ELAS provides high-impact, low-cost advising and mentoring in areas such as governance, leadership, and long-term planning. ELAS advisors (referred to as ELAS Ed-visors) include retired heads of school and senior administrators. ELAS Ed-visors have extensive experience in independent school management and assist NYSAIS schools in finance and investment, fundraising, strategic planning, board structure, governance, succession planning, school leadership, and accreditation. Built upon a solid foundation of best practices combined with current research, each Ed-visement will be custom-designed to meet the specific needs of your educational community. The ELAS program is directed by the NYSAIS Associate Director for Evaluation and Accreditation, Judy Sheridan.\n\nIn 2010, participants at the NYSAIS Think Tank identified the need to create a professional development program for emerging leaders in NYSAIS schools. In 2011, NYSAIS launched the NYSAIS Emerging Leaders Institute (ELI) with 16 cohort members. The program is directed by George Swain, Director for Evaluation and Professional Learning, and Marcy Mann, Associate Director for Professional Learning. The current cohort includes participants from a diverse range of backgrounds and independent schools across New York State. Admission to the 2-year program is competitive and must include the strong endorsement of one's current Head of School.\n\nSuccessful completion of this hybrid learning program involves full participation in residential conferences, one-day workshops and online seminars in addition to independent work throughout the two-year cohort experience.

The district, serving the western section of the San Fernando Valley and the eastern Conejo Valley in Los Angeles County, consists of 14 public schools serving the cities of Agoura Hills, Calabasas, Hidden Hills, Westlake Village, and several small portions of the West Hills section of Los Angeles.\n\nIts largest school is Agoura High School, with approximately 2,400 students.\n\nLVUSD includes the following schools:\n\n\nBy the 1940s, the territory that is now the Las Virgenes district was divided among four one-room schools, each with its own school district:\n\nIn 1947, these four districts merged to form the Las Virgenes Union School District. A new Las Virgenes union grade school was built to replace the old schools; this has since become A.E. Wright Middle School, named after Arthur E. Wright, a childless English immigrant with only an eight-grade education, who nonetheless took an interest in local education, was elected to the Liberty school board, and was instrumental in forming the union school district.\n\nAll the one-room school districts' territories had been annexed into Los Angeles City High School District on August 18, 1921, and until the 1960s, the teenagers of these grade school districts attended Canoga Park High School. However, the creation of Los Angeles Unified School District in 1961 took away the vast majority of the high school district, leaving only the territory of the Las Virgenes and Topanga grade school districts. The high school district renamed itself West County Union High School District, but had no high school left in its territory. Topanga School District voted to join L.A. Unified the next school year, leaving West County with the same border as Las Virgenes Union School District as of July 1, 1962, and California law made coterminous grade school and high school districts automatically become a unified school district, thus creating Las Virgenes Unified School District.\n\nThough L.A. Unified was required to provide high school education to Las Virgenes for three years, California law mandated that, if a unified school district did not establish its own high school by September 1965, the district would be annexed to an adjacent district with a high school. In January 1963, LVUSD residents had already voted down construction financing by very narrow margins, and many residents were still advocating a merger into a bigger district. If financing had been voted down again, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors would have had to choose an adjacent district to annex LVUSD territory into: L.A. Unified, Oxnard, Santa Monica, or Simi. However, in the April 16, 1963 election, the voters approved the bond issue and state aid authorization — the latter by only four votes — which allowed LVUSD to build Agoura High School and three grade schools.\n\nWhen the district was created, its offices were located on the grounds of the Round Meadow Elementary School in Calabasas. They were then moved in 1974 to 30961 West Agoura Road in Westlake Village, and again in 1990 to a two-story building at 4111 North Las Virgenes Road, next to the A.E. Wright Middle School.\n\nLVUSD annexed the community of Bell Canyon in Ventura County, California in 1987.\n\nCommunity members formed a school foundation, The Foundation for Las Virgenes Schools, in 2010 in response to the dramatic loss of State funding for public education. The mission of the foundation is to provide general financial support for the public schools in the Las Virgenes Unified School District.\n\n\n \n"}
{"id": "2212160", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2212160", "title": "Angelica Catalani", "text": "Angelica Catalani\n\nAngelica Catalani (10 May 178012 June 1849) was an Italian opera singer, the daughter of a tradesman. Her greatest gift was her voice, a soprano of nearly three octaves in range. Its unsurpassed power and flexibility made her one of the greatest bravura singers of all time. She also worked as a singing teacher. Her pupils included Laure Cinti-Damoreau and Fanny Corri-Paltoni.\n\nCatalani was born on 10 May 1780, at Sinigaglia, where her father was a tradesman. \nAbout the age of 12 she was sent to the convent of Santa Lucia at Gubbio, near Rome, where her beautiful voice soon became a great attraction. \nIn its full freshness, according to Fétis and all other authorities, it must have been one of extraordinary purity, force, and compass, going as far as G in altissimo, with a sweet clear tone. This exquisite quality was allied to a marvellous truth and rapidity of execution. \nNo singer has ever surpassed, or perhaps equalled, her in chromatic scales, whether in velocity or precision.\n\nOn leaving the convent, into which she had been introduced by the Cardinal Onorati, and where the congregation could frequently not be prevented from openly applauding her splendid notes in the services, she found herself, owing to the sudden impoverishment of her parents, compelled to perform in public. \nHer musical education had been but ill cared for in the convent, where she passed three years; and she had contracted bad tricks of vocalisation, which she never entirely overcame, even after hearing such great models as Luigi Marchesi and Girolamo Crescentini. \nOne of her faults was that she could never execute certain passages without a very perceptible oscillation of the lower jaw, which made them, instead of being even and smooth, sound like a succession of staccato passages on the violin. \nIn spite of this fault, which was indeed more within the criticism of connoisseurs than of the public generally, her voice was so full, powerful, and clear, her intonation so pure and true, and her instinctive execution of difficult and brilliant music so easy and unfaltering, that her singing had a charm which has scarcely ever been equalled, and her very first steps in a theatrical career were marked by the most extraordinary success. \nWhen she began, the favourite style was that of expressive and pathetic song, and in this she never produced the effect which she subsequently made in bravura. \nThus at Paris she failed comparatively in a tender song of Piccini's, 'Se'l ciel mi divide,' though shortly after, she created the greatest enthusiasm by her 'Son regina,' by an air of Rode's with variations, concerti for the voice, and other pieces of the most florid execution.\n\nIn 1795, at the age of 16, she obtained her first engagement at La Fenice at Venice, and made her début as Lodoiska in the opera of that name by Mayer. Her face, figure, and voice, assured her success, a success which grew day by day, and lasted for nearly thirty years. In the season of 1798, she sang at Leghorn with Crivelli, Marchesi, and Mrs. Billington; the year after, at La Pergola in Florence, in Nasolini's 'Monima e Mitridate'; and, in 1801, at Milan, in the 'Clitemnestra' of Zingarelli, and Nasolini's 'Baccanali.' In these early efforts her effect was not due to method or skill; it was her superb voice that carried all before her. From Milan she went to Florence, Trieste, Rome, and Naples, exciting everywhere the same astonishment and admiration.\n\nHer reputation now reached the ears of the Prince Regent of Portugal, who engaged her, with Elisabetta Gafforini and Crescentini, to sing at the Italian Opera there, and she arrived about the end of the year 1804. Her salary was 24,000 cruzados (£3,000) - the equivalent of £292,458.41 in 2018.\n\nSome writers have said that she derived very great advantage from the instruction of Crescentini, which, indeed, seems more than likely; but Fétis, on the authority of Crescentini himself, contradicts this statement categorically, affirming that Crescentini told him that he had endeavoured to give her a little advice, which she had seemed incapable of understanding. \nDuring her stay in Portugal, Catalani made the acquaintance of Paul Valabrègue, the French attaché at Lisbon and former French captain, and they married in 1804. \nHer husband, appears to have had no ideas beyond helping his talented wife to gain the utmost possible amount of money on every occasion, and spending it for her afterwards. \nFrom their marriage dates one of the worst of the many speculations that have been based on the capital of a grand voice and great personal charm. \nThey went first to Madrid, and then to Paris, where she sang only in concerts, but where she gained even more fame than before.\n\nOn October 26, 1805, Mme. Catalani signed her first engagement (in the possession of the writer) with F. Goold and W. Taylor, manager and proprietors of the King's Theatre in the Haymarket, for the season from September 15, 1806, to August 1807, at a salary of £2,000 sterling, with 'a further sum of £100 sterling to defray the expenses of her journey to London,' and also 'one Benefit Night free of expense in the month of March, at which a new opera shall be performed.' \nBefore crossing, however, she gave concerts at Madrid and Paris, by which she gained large sums of money, and created a deep impression; indeed, Napoleon offered her an engagement from which she had some difficulty in escaping, in order to fulfil that at the King's Theatre. \nAt the moment of her arrival in London, Grassini and Mrs. Billington had just retired; and, as Lord Mount-Edgcumbe says, \nThe opinions of all good judges were nearly the same with the above; but the public was led completely away by her marvellous powers. She made her début December 15, 1806, in the 'Semiramide' of Portogallo, composed for her expressly.\n\nShe appeared also in 'Mitridate,' 'Elfrida,' and most unwillingly in 'La Clemenza di Tito,' for the strict time required in Mozart's music, and the importance of the accompaniments, were not suited to her style. \nShe was, however, the singer who introduced to the English stage his 'Nozze di Figaro,' in which she played Susanna to admiration. \nIn the 'Orazi' she performed the part of the first soprano, Curiazio, that of the first woman being filled by Ferlendis. \nIn 'Didone' she caused the rôle of Enea to be sung by Madame Dussek, who was entirely unfitted for it; and, in another opera, she made Madame Dussek act the first woman's part, choosing for herself that of the primo uomo. Subsequently, she assumed also the place of prima buffa, and succeeded equally well in that line; singing with greater simplicity and ease, she was by some preferred in comic opera. \nHer face and figure suited both styles; for her handsome countenance was capable of great varieties of expression. Her gains soon became enormous. She was the great attraction of Goold's management, and her engagements entailed on the theatre an expense surpassing anything before experienced.\n\nMr. Waters, in a pamphlet which he published, gives the total amount received by her from the theatre in 1807, including benefits, at £5,000, and her total profits that year, with concerts, provincial tour, etc., at £16,700,—an immense sum to be received in such a period for the services of a single artist. \nThat she sometimes found a difficulty in getting payment is not surprising, especially from such a manager as Taylor. \nEbers relates that, on one occasion, she refused to sing unless a debt of £1,000 due to her was paid; and that he gave security for this, of which he had ultimately to pay every farthing. She received as much as 200 guineas for singing 'God save the King' and 'Rule Britannia,' and at a single festival £2,000. \nHad she practised the least economy she must have amassed a very great fortune; but this she did not do. \nIt is said, for example, that the consumption of beer by her servants during a single year amounted to £103. \nMore serious causes, however, contributed to dissipate these riches as fast as she gained them; for her husband was passionately addicted to gambling, and lost vast sums at play. She remained seven years in England, where she finally succeeded in becoming the only singer of eminence, and led in both lines; but one singer does not constitute an opera, though Valabrègue used to say 'Ma femme et quatre ou cinq poupées,—voilà tout ce qu'il faut.' \nNeither would her disposition endure the possibility of rivalry, nor the extravagance of her increasing demands allow any manager to engage other singers.\n\nShe quit the theatre at the end of the season of 1813, having first endeavoured (unsuccessfully) to purchase it, and so become sole proprietor, sole manager, and sole singer. After leaving this stage, she for many years never trod any other, except at Paris, where she obtained the management of the Italian opera, with a subvention of 160,000 francs; but the undertaking was not fortunate. \nOn the return of Napoleon, in 1815, she left Paris, going first to Hamburg, and afterwards to Denmark and Sweden, and exciting everywhere the wildest admiration and enthusiasm. \nShe returned to France, after the Restoration, by the Netherlands and Belgium. \nOn her arrival at Paris, she resumed the direction of the Théâtre Italian, and established the same ruinous system which had destroyed, for a time, opera in London. \nEvery expense of scenery, orchestra, and chorus, was curtailed, and every singer of worth excluded, in order that the entire receipts might go, with the subvention, into the purse of Valabrègue. \nThis was not all. \nTo suit this state of things the operas were arranged in such a manner that little of the original but the name remained. \nThe rest consisted of variations by Rode, and similar things, with the famous 'Son regina,' interpolated in place of the concerted pieces and songs which had been cut out. \nIn May 1816, Catalani left her opera in the hands of managers, and went to Munich to give some concerts and representations. \nThence she proceeded to Italy, and only returned to Paris in August 1817.\n\nIn the next April she left her opera entirely, and resumed her wanderings. \nHaving engaged Mme. Gail to accompany her, as Pucitta had done in London and Paris, she started for Vienna. \nNo sooner had they arrived than she quarrelled with her companion, who returned to Paris. Catalani continued her tour alone, and it lasted nearly ten years. \nIn 1824, she returned to London, performing a certain number of nights with no regular engagement. \nShe reappeared in 'Il Nuovo Fanatico per la Musica,' an opera by Mayer, arranged for her. 'Her powers were undiminished, her taste unimproved.' \nShe next continued her wanderings on the continent. \nIn 1826, an attempt was made by Ebers to engage her, but the terms proposed by her were so exorbitant that it was impossible to consider them seriously. \nHer voice was, however, no longer what it had been, especially in the highest part of her register. \nThough still beautiful, flexible, and strong, it was losing gradually a little of these qualities. \nIn turn she visited Germany, Italy, and Paris once more, where she sang without success; then Poland, Russia, and the north of Germany again in 1827. \nAbout this time she sang for the last time at Berlin, and resolved to cease singing in public.\n\nBut she revisited England once more in 1828, and sang at the York Festival. Lord Mount-Edgcumbe heard her the same year at Plymouth, and describes her as having lost, perhaps, a little in voice, but gained more in expression: as electrifying an audience with her 'Rule Britannia;' and as still handsome, though somewhat stout. \nAfter a time, she retired to a villa which she had bought in the neighbourhood of Florence. \nOn the stage, she is described as having always produced an unnatural impression, owing to an invincible nervousness, which made her exaggerate the effects she wished to create. She said herself, that it was as painful to her to sing in the theatre as it was delightful to perform at a concert.\n\nShe never lost her simplicity and purity of manners, nor her piety, modesty, and generosity. Her charitable deeds were innumerable, and the amount of money earned by her in concerts for such purposes alone has been estimated at 2,000,000 francs. \nAt her residence she founded a school of singing for young girls.\n\nCatalani died of cholera at Paris, June 12, 1849.\n\nCatalani's sister-in-law, Adelina, was also a soprano, though of far less note. She was known variously as \"la cognate della famosa\" and \"la Catalani juniore\" to distinguish her from her far better-known relative.\n\n\n"}

Unlike Oldfield's albums released prior to \"Earth Moving\", the album contains no instrumental tracks.\n\nOldfield used several vocalists on the album, including his then girlfriend, Anita Hegerland. The album's music was performed mainly with synthesizers. It was the first time Oldfield recorded an album without an instrumental piece; each track being vocal-based pop and rock songs. Oldfield's only other album free of instrumentals to date is 2014's \"Man on the Rocks\".\n\nThe final track, despite appearing to be a lengthier piece, consists of two short, apparently unconnected songs, combined into one track, with a noticeable pause in between. According to Oldfield, the album was made with the full understanding of his recording company, Virgin Records, which demanded he create more commercially oriented material than his previous albums. After recording \"Earth Moving\" Oldfield wanted to move away from 'computerised music' and return to real musicians and instruments; this is evident in his next album, \"Amarok\".\n\nAccording to an interview Mike Oldfield and Anita Hegerland gave on the television programme \"Good Morning Britain\", the song \"Innocent\" was inspired by their young daughter Greta, who appears in the song's music video. In the programme, Oldfield and Hegerland performed an acoustic version of the song, Hegerland singing and Oldfield playing the guitar.\n\n\"Earth Moving\", \"Innocent\" and \"(One Glance Is) Holy\" were released as singles.\n\n\"Earth Moving\" is the first album on which Oldfield used PRS guitars, having previously used Gibson guitars. Synthesizers on the album include a Fairlight Series III and various instruments made by Roland and Korg (including an M1). The album was recorded using an Atari 1040ST with C-Lab Notator software, a Harrison Series X console, a Studer A8800 tape deck with Dolby SR noise reduction, an Ampex Grand Master tape and ATC SCM200 monitors.\n\nAll tracks written by Mike Oldfield.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The analysis showed that \"L. hispana\" has a large genetic distance between the two species and that there was allopartic speciation from \"L. coridon\". \"L. slovacus\" seems to show that there was sympatry with \"L. coridon\" but the genetic analysis could not prove this hypothesis, so the researchers made the conclusion that this particular species was a local population that has an atavism of bivoltinism.\n\nThe expansion of the species travels from western Europe into eastern Europe from the ice-age refugium into the Balkans. The starting point for the expansion is in western Hungary traveling into the Balkans and then into Brandenburg and Poland. This expansion shows that are two routes due to the changes in gene allele frequencies and the degree of homogeneity of the species.\n\nThe two routes are:\n\n1.) Starting in the western tip of Hungary traveling into north-eastern Hungry along the Hungarian Mountains into eastern Slovakia\n\n2.) Starts in western Hungary and travels along the eastern Alps into western Slovakia and Czech Republic\n\nThe expansion caused there to be two unique genetic populations that were separated by mountain ranges. And the expansion also caused the movement of species that were only found in warmer areas to move into new habitats that were previously cooler in temperature and did not have the biotic components to support these new species.\n\n\"Lysandra coridon\" has a wingspan of . These small butterflies present a sexual dimorphism. This species' physical appearance can be described as males having pale silvery-blue upperside of the wings with a submarginal line of grey spots on the hindwings and a thin brown and white chequered fringe. Females have dark brown upperside of wings, with marginal orange spots and also with chequered fringes. The underside of the wings show a light ochre colouration, several dark spots surrounded by white, a submarginal line of black marks, a series of marginal orange spots on the hindwings and a blue dusting near the body.\n\nAs with many blue butterflies, separation from similar species in the field is on the underside markings. Aberrations are common.\n\n\"L. coridon\" Poda (81 c, d). male above light blue green with a silvery glitter, the black margin of the forewing broad, the hindwing with dark dots at the margin. The underside light violet-grey on the forewing, brownish on the hindwing, variegated with white and bearing yellowish red submarginal spots; both wings very densely ornamented with ocelli. Female above russet grey-brown, beneath earth-brown and like the male with very numerous ocelli. The area of distribution is essentially smaller than in most Blues, being apparently entirely restricted to Central and South Europe. The species occurs from England, Pommerania, and St. Petersburg southwards to Spain, Italy and Brussa, and from the Pyrenees to Orenburg. Although the species is very uniformly developed, quite a number of forms have been provided with names, being partly based on very minute differences. We deal first with the variation of the upperside. — \"hispana\" H.-Schiff. (= \"arragonensis\" Gerh.) [now full species], from Spain, is paler with the distal margin more strongly spotted. — \"apennina\" Z. (81 d) [now full species] is on the whole paler, the dark marginal border of the forewing being lighter in consequence of an intermixture of the ground-colour; from Italy. — The Greek form \"graeca\" Ruhl-Heyne is quite similar. — \"rezniceki\" Bartel, from Northern Italy, is a transition to the previous; according to the description the upperside of the males is still paler. — \"albicans\" H.-Schiff. (81 d) [now full species] is the lightest form, which is almost white above; it flies on limestone in Spain, sometimes as the only form, sometimes in the company of \"hispana\" (Ribbe). — \"caucasica\" Led. (= \"ossmar\" Gerh.) [now full species] (81 e) extends on to the Asiatic continent, flying in Armenia and at the Black Sea. The upperside of the male is brighter blue. — In specimens from the Taurus Mts. even a slight violet sheen is present, especiallv in the outer area of the wings; this is \"corydonius\" H.-Schiff. (= olympica Led.) (81 d).[now full species \"Lysandra corydonius\" (Lederer, 1870)] — The blue colour of the male may occasionally appear also in the female, being sometimes restricted to the base — ab. \"semibrunnea\" Mill. (= \"semi-syngrapha\" Tutt) — sometimes occupying the whole upperside: ab. \"syngrapha\" Kef. (= \"mariscolore\" Gerh.)(81 d). On the other hand the blue upperside of the male may dulled by a grey suffusion: ab. \"suffusa\" Tutt. Other accidental forms are males with red spots at the margin above: ab. \"suavis\" Schultz, and females with such spots: ab. \"aurantia\" Tutt. In ab. \"inaequalis\" Tutt the glossy blue colour forms irregular streaks on a dark ground. In ab. \"marginata\" Tutt the black margin is broadened. In ab. \"fowleri\" South the margin is white instead of black, while in ab. \"punctata\" Tutt the margins are spotted. ab. \"calydonius\" Lowe has the ground colour darkened and the black borders enlarged. — Equally variable as the upperside is the under surface. The ground-colour beneath may be very dark (especially in certain females) or remarkably pale; the latter is the case in ab. \"pallida\" Tutt. The ocelli may be distorted into rays: ab. \"striat\"a Tutt. Some of the ocelli may be united: ab. \"tiphys\" Esp. They may be increased in number: ab. \"luxurians\" Courv., or they may be reduced (ab. \"privata\", \"unipuncta\", \"impuncta\") or all be absent: ab. \"cinnus\" Hbn. (= \"sohni\" Ruhl) (81 d). Moreover, all these variations may be more or less slightly developed or vestigial (ab. \"semiaurantia\", \"caeruleomarginata\"etc.), or various aberrational characters may be combined in one individual, as for instance in ab. \"parisiensis\" Gerh., which is an ab. \"syngrapha\" with the ocelli as in ab. \"tiphys\", etc. — Egg greenish\nwhite, with minute pale reticulation, the meshes being hexagonal. Larva bright blue-green, beneath paler, the dorsal line appearing dark owing to the dorsal vessel, accompanied by chains of yellow spots, a similar but duller row of spots above the abdominal legs. Until June on \"Hippocrepis\", \"Coronilla\", \"Astragalus\", \"Vicia\", etc. Visited by \"Formica flava\", which is attracted by the dorsal gland. Pupa rather slender, smooth, dirty yellowish brown, with dark dorsal line and on the wing-cases pale smears, free on the ground, often under stones. The butterflies occur from June till August, being rare in some places,exceedingly abundant in others; they are everywhere found in particular localities. They have a rapid flight, which is also more sustained than in most other Blues, and go early to sleep, settling for the night with closed wings on stalks of grass or on the top of flowers while it is yet full day-light. This offers the best opportunity for collecting aberrations, since the ocelli of the underside are so clearl visible that onecan pick out without difficulty and put into the cyanide bottle what one requires.\n\nThis species can be found in the Palearctic ecozone (west Europe, south Europe, central Europe, Asia Minor, south Urals, northwest Turan). The range of \"L. coridon\" occurs throughout Central Europe, and is endemic to Europe. There are a few exceptions to where it is located in Central Europe, it is not found in the countries of Ireland, Scotland, Scandinavia, the Netherlands, the Iberian Peninsula (exception of it being found in the northern provinces of Iberian), the Mediterranean islands (found in Corsica and Sardinia), and most of southern Italy.\n\nThis particular species of butterfly has a preference for dry calcareous grasslands, at an elevation of above sea level. This species also has a preference towards grasslands that have short grass with many flowering plants. \"L. coridon\" is a sedentary organism which means that they do not travel very far within their habitat range. These individuals have the tendency to stay within their habitat patch rather than do long migrations to find new habitats.\n\n\"Note that information on this species applies to Great Britain and some details may not be consistent with the species in other parts of its range.\"\n\nThis species only produces one generation per year making them a univoltine, which means that this species only breeds once per year and will only produce one set of offspring.\n\n\"L. coridon\" is monophagous, which means that they only feeds on one specific species of plant. The larvae or caterpillars of this species feed on the leaves of horseshoe vetch (\"Hippocrepis comosa\") upon which the larvae feed.\n\nWhen they are ready they pupate on the ground within the leaf litter of the host plants.\n\nThe caterpillars are attend by several different ants of the genera \"Myrmica\", \"Lasius\", \"Formica\", \"Plagiolepis\", \"Tetramorium\", \"Aphaenogaster\" and \"Tapinoma\".\n\nThis butterfly is usually seen on the wing from June to October.\n\nIn the research into the effects of trophic interaction and fragmentation it was found that there are no known parasitoids that are specialized to this species, but there are other parasitoids that are related to other species that are part of the family Lycaenidae which will sometimes predate this species. It could be a viable option that the parasitoids that did predate upon this species became extinct due to the fragmentation of their habitat in the past.\n\nThis would be physical features of the environment that separate populations of the same species. One type of would be mountain ranges which separate west and east population of \"L. coridon\", and this separation causes there to be changes in the allele frequency of both population and there can be mixing of these populations only when there is an area that is connected.\n\nAnother type would be the loss of habitat which can lead to large habitat areas being fragmented, this loss can occur due to human interaction with the ecosystem in way that isolates populations of the species. The loss of habitat changes the number of individuals that the area can support or blocks the population off from a larger population. The limiting number of individuals in the population or the isolation can cause a decrease in the heterogeneity of population and leads to a decrease in fitness.\n\nHabitat fragmentation causes conservation efforts to be difficult because it has to be decided what areas get protect or have the best possible chance of helping increase a population without damaging the overall fitness of the population, so great care is taken when selecting what areas will be protected.\n\nAccording to IUCN Red List for Threatened Species, this particular species is of Least Concern, and this is due to this species not having a significant decline in population in the last ten years, which would be a decline by 25% in the number of adults.\n\nSince this species is of Least Concern there are few conservation efforts being put forth. But in certain areas that have been having large decline or had large decline implemented conservation efforts. This species is considered by researchers to be an indicator species of calcareous grassland habitat quality and could also be a good model organism to help develop conservation programs for more At Risk species.\n\nAll three countries have done research into the conservation of the calcareous grassland. Protecting this species would also lead to helping protect higher trophic level individuals that are located in this ecosystem.\n\nThe chalkhill blue experienced a significant decline in population number in the 1950s. There was a rise in population between 1981 and 2000. In this time period there was a significant increase in numbers and this led to the stabilization of the population in the 1990s. The UK Biodiversity Action Plan had monitoring plans in place to see these changes and the data that was collected during that time period showed that the increase in population number came from the use of controlling grazing levels, conservation designation, and agri-environment schemes entry and management. These practices improved the quality of the habitats that were located in the United Kingdom.\n\nBoth Germany and Poland came up with action plans such as that if conservation efforts where to take place that the ideal area for protection would be large habitats that were interconnected with other Grassland habitats that were fragmented, and had a high abundance of the juvenile host plant located within it or had the ability to support a large number of plants.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2212166", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2212166", "title": "Hessian fabric", "text": "Hessian fabric\n\nHessian (pronounced ), burlap in the US and Canada, or crocus in Jamaica is a woven fabric usually made from skin of the jute plant or sisal fibres, which may be combined with other vegetable fibres to make rope, nets, and similar products. Gunny is similar in texture and construction.\n\nHessian, a dense woven fabric, has historically been produced as a coarse fabric, but more recently it is being used in a refined state known simply as jute as an eco-friendly material for bags, rugs and other products.\n\nThe name \"hessian\" is attributed to the historic use of the fabric as part of the uniform of soldiers from the former Landgraviate of Hesse and its successors, including the current German state of Hesse, who were called \"Hessians\".\n\nThe origin of the word \"burlap\" is unknown, though its earliest known appearance is in the late 17th century, and its etymology is speculated to derive from the Middle English \"borel\" (\"coarse cloth\"), the Old French \"burel\" and/or the Dutch \"boeren\" (\"coarse\"), in the latter case perhaps interfused with \"boer\" (\"peasant\"). The second element is the English word \"lap\", \"piece of cloth\".\n\nHessian was first exported from India in the early 19th century. It was traditionally used as backing for linoleum, rugs, and carpet. \n\nIn Jamaica and certain parts of the Caribbean (where it is only known as Crocus), many labourers who used to work on the plantations were not often given pleasant materials with which to make clothes. Some had access to cotton which was spun, woven, cut and sewn into serviceable clothing (often called homespun) whilst others had to make do with clothing fashioned from roughly hewn sacking. labourers used their resourcefulness to recycle discarded sacking and fashion them into garments that although fairly uncomfortable by all accounts provided protection from the heat and dust. A traditional costume of Jamaican Maroons uses fabric very similar to this material as a way of drawing an affinity and pay homage to the resourcefulness and creativity of their labourers who gained freedom. For the rest of the population, it was used to make bags for carrying loads of coffee and other items, edible or not.\n\nHessian is often used to make gunny sacks, and to ship goods like coffee beans and rooibos tea. It is breathable and so resists condensation and associated spoilage of contents. It is also durable enough to withstand rough handling in transit; these properties have also led to its use for temporary protection as wet covering to prevent rapid moisture loss in the setting of cement and concrete in the construction industry. Hessian is also commonly used to make effective sandbags; hessian sacks filled with sand are often used for flood mitigation in temporary embankments against floodwaters or field fortifications.\n\nThe transportation of agricultural products often involves bags made from hessian jute fabric. Hessian jute bags (commonly known as gunnysacks) are used to ship wool, tobacco, and cotton, as well as foodstuffs such as coffee, flour, vegetables, and grains. Hessian jute's ability to allow the contents of bags to breathe makes it excellent for preventing or minimizing rotting due to trapped moisture. In some cases, hessian can even be specially treated to avoid specific kinds of rot and decay.\n\nHessian is also often used for the transportation of unprocessed dry tobacco. This material is used for much the same reasons as it would be used for coffee. Hessian sacks in the tobacco industry hold up to 200 kg (440lb) of tobacco, and due to hessian's toughness, a hessian sack can have a useful life of up to three years.\n\nHessian is used to wrap the exposed roots of trees and shrubs when transplanting and also for erosion control on steep slopes. One major advantage of hessian jute fabric is that, because it is made entirely from natural vegetable fibers, it is completely biodegradable.\n\nThis property also makes it extremely useful in landscaping and agricultural uses that require incorporating fabric support into outdoor projects. Landscape designs that include tree transplantation often rely on hessian jute to ensure that young trees arrive at the planting venue intact and unharmed. This is achieved by wrapping hessian jute fabric around the roots and soil of a tree shortly after digging it from its original location. The breathability of the fabric allows sufficient aeration of the soil, and the hessian's moisture-resistant properties prevent excess water from accumulating and allowing the growth of mold, mildew, or other types of rot. Once planted, young trees may require the protection of hessian jute to ward off mice and other rodents that might otherwise eat their bark and compromise their structure. To keep rodents at bay, landscapers often wrap swathes of hessian jute around the trunks of young trees of all varieties.\n\nIn addition to protecting from animals, hessian jute also has the capacity to protect trees from excessive sun and wind. By building windbreaks from hessian jute, landscapers can exert some control over the environment in which young trees grow, thus maximizing their chances of growing to maturity so that they can withstand more intense weather conditions.\n\nFor planting grass, on areas that have steep slopes or high levels of soil erosion, a layer of hessian jute tacked on over grass seeds can prevent seeds from being moved by rain, runoff, or wind. Landscapers can use this fabric for many uses due to its strength, durability, moisture resistance, and protective properties.\n\nDue to its coarse texture, it is not commonly used in modern apparel. However, this roughness gave it a use in a religious context for mortification of the flesh, where individuals may wear an abrasive shirt called a cilice or \"hair shirt\" and in the wearing of \"sackcloth\" on Ash Wednesday. During the Great Depression in the US, when cloth became relatively scarce in the largely agrarian parts of the country, many farming families used burlap cloth to sew their own clothes. However, prolonged exposure to the material can cause rashes on sensitive skin.\n\nOwing to its durability, open weave, naturally non-shiny refraction and fuzzy texture, ghillie suits for 3D camouflage are often made of hessian. It was also a popular material for camouflage scrim on combat helmets during World War II. Until the advent of the plastic \"leafy\" multi-color net system following the Vietnam War, burlap scrim was also woven onto shrimp and fish netting to create large-scale military camouflage netting.\n\nHessian has been used by artists as an alternative to cotton or linen as a stretched painting or working surface. In horror fiction, it is commonly used as a mask and as a mask for victims of beheading.\n\nHessian bags are often deployed as sandbags as a temporary response to flooding. Because of their material, they can either be reused or can be composted after use. Agencies like the State Emergency Service in Australia and Technisches Hilfswerk in Germany often deploy sandbags, and these are found in the majority of their emergency response vehicles. Plastic bags have been used as a substitute, but SES units have found hessian bags to be more versatile as they can be used in a variety of rescue applications: as an edge protector for rope rescue operations, for use as padding on slings used in animal rescue or used to dampen and beat out bush-fires.\n\nHessian fabric is often used as smoker fuel in beekeeping because of its generous smoke generation and ease of ignition.\n\n"}

He then joined BOAC and flew Lockheed Constellations for that airline in the late 1940s/1950s.\n\nRoberts, who was born in Durban, South Africa, enjoyed success with a number of songs in the 1950s and 1960s and wrote songs for several films. He released several LPs and EPs of his own material, often featuring what were, for the time, slightly risqué lyrics. One of his most popular and amusing compositions that he recorded himself was entitled \"The Ballad of Bethnal Green\", which was also recorded by Beatrice Lillie. \n\nRoberts was five times the winner of an Ivor Novello Award, four for songwriting and one for services to the British Music Industry. He co-wrote the 1955 UK chart-topper, \"Softly, Softly\", as sung by Ruby Murray, and \"Lay Down Your Arms\" by Anne Shelton, which reached No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart in 1956.\n\nRoberts died in August 1975 in Dartmouth, Devon, England.\n\n\n\n\nSingles: featuring recordings not issued on albums\n\nEPs\n\nMany of Roberts' recordings were made available in the United States. \"Merry Christmas You Suckers\" was issued with an alternative title of \"And A Happy New Year\".\n\nAlthough most the albums were only issued in mono, it appears that the studio albums at least were recorded in stereo. The tracks from \"Strictly For Grown Ups\" that are included on \"The World of Paddy Roberts\"\" are in stereo, leading to the assumption that the whole album was recorded that way (but never issued that way). \"Songs for Gay Dogs\" was issued in stereo for the first time in 2006 when released on CD which indicated that \"...But Not in front of the Children\" was also recorded that way.\n\nThe musical director on most recordings was Dennis Wilson. The exceptions being \"Songs For Gay Dogs\" (Peter Knight), \"Funny World\" (Ronnie Aldrich), \"Live at the Blue Angel\" (Barry Morgan) and \"Doctor Dolittle\" (Cyril Stapleton). The director for \"Love Is A Wonderful Thing\" / \"Send For Me\" was Johnny Pearson. There is no director listed for his MFP album.\n\nAll Decca Material with the exception of \"...But Not in front of the Children\" and \"Funny World\" was produced by Hugh Mendl.\n\n\n\"Strictly For Grown Ups\" has also been released without \"Paddy Roberts Tries Again\", but with various other Roberts compositions sung by others on MCSR 3046.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2212179", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2212179", "title": "Taboo (musical)", "text": "Taboo (musical)\n\nTaboo is a stage musical with a book by Mark Davies Markham (extensively rewritten for the Broadway production by Charles Busch), lyrics by Boy George, and music by George, John Themis, Richie Stevens and Kevan Frost.\n\nSet in an abandoned London warehouse, the partly imagined story of a group of club 'names' set in the location of what was the city's most fashionable nightclub, the now-legendary \"Taboo\" (1985–87) of the title, which was the creation of Leigh Bowery. Boy George is featured as one of the club's regulars, but in reality, George rarely attended. The show also focuses on George's life prior to and after achieving fame.\n\nThe show premiered in London's West End at the newly opened Venue Theatre on January 29, 2002. Comedian/talk show host Rosie O'Donnell was so enamoured with it that she decided to finance a Broadway production. After 16 previews, it opened on November 13, 2003, at the Plymouth Theatre where, hampered by mostly scathing reviews, it closed after 100 performances. The cast, directed by Christopher Renshaw, included Boy George (credited under his real name, George O'Dowd), Euan Morton, Luke Evans, Dianne Pilkington, Raúl Esparza, Sarah Uriarte Berry, Jeffrey Carlson, and Brooke Elliott. O'Donnell reportedly lost her entire $10 million investment in the project. O'Donnell said in a 2007 interview about Leigh Bowery that she will take \"Taboo\" back to Broadway in the future.\n\nIn September 2012, director Christopher Renshaw revived the show in a \"site specific\" form in Brixton Clubhouse in South London. The production was based on the original show with book by Mark Davies, but included several changes to the original storyline.\n\nIn this production, Paul Baker revived his Olivier Award winning role of Philip Sallon, and was joined by Samuel Buttery as Leigh Bowery and Niamh Perry as Kim. George was played by newcomer Matthew Rowland, and other roles were played by Adam Bailey, Owain Williams, Michael Matus, Alistair Brammer, Alex Hammond, Zeph Gould, Jennifer Hepburn, Daniella Bowen, and Katie Kerr as Big Sue.\n\nMost of the songs stayed the same, but Boy George and Kevan Frost penned the new song \"No Need To Work So Hard\" to replace \"Independent Woman\", and the show's finale was \"Come On In From the Outside\", which had previously been part of the Broadway show.\n\nThe following characters were added:\n\nSince the plot no longer took the company to India, the role of Guru Dazzle was dropped.\n\nThe show was such a success that it was extended to run beyond its initial Christmas deadline. This made the show require a cast change, so the second company included:\n\nAll joined existing company members in their previous roles.\n\nThe production won the 2013 Whatsonstage.com Awards award for Best Off West-End Production.\n\nThe second company continued its successful run, and eventually closed on Sunday 31 March 2013 after having done 213 performances.\n\nThree members of the company did all 213 performances of the show - Andrew Holton (Company Manager), David Morgan (Wardrobe Supervisor), and Marcin Weber (Sound Engineer).\n\nThe show is based partly on the New Romantic scene of the 1980s. At its core is the life and career of colourful pop star Boy George (who rose to global prominence in the early 1980s with his band Culture Club) and his contemporaries, including performance artist and club promoter Leigh Bowery, pop singer Marilyn, Blitz nightclub host Steve Strange (later of the electro-pop group Visage), and Philip Sallon, punk groupie and Mud Club promoter. Although George was intimate with the central figures, artistic license around relationships and time frames was taken for continuity; for example, Bowery never attended the Blitz nightclub, as he was living in Australia at the time.\n\nThe show begins with Philip Salon introducing us to all the New Romantics in London's Soho district (\"Freak/Ode To Attention Seekers\").\n\nNext we enter the James family home where Billy lives with his mom, Josie, and dad, Derek who is unemployed thanks to the Thatcher era. Billy's dad starts ranting about Billy been a waste of space and starts to mock him because he wants to be a photographer. Billy finally snaps and decides it's time to leave home and move to London and discover himself. He packs his bag and says goodbye to his long suffering mom and leaves (\"Safe In the City\").\n\nBilly is in London. Whilst walking around the streets he runs into a cross-dressing drug dealer named Petal, but Phillip drags Billy away from him. Philip tells Billy he knows of a place where he can stay, a squat with a few other people living there.\n\nOn arriving at the squat Billy is met by the fiery Kim, a punk looking girl who wants to be a fashion designer. She says he can't live there as it's full, but George, her roommate, decides Billy can stay with them. George is wearing heavy makeup and what can only be described as a white toga; Billy is fascinated by him. George explains to Billy that his father is a builder so he was never happy with how George turned out, but his mother is a different story. Billy goes to the kitchen with Kim whilst George reflects on his mother's unconditional love towards him (\"Stranger In This World\"). When Billy reenters the room George kisses Billy taking him by surprise and Billy runs off.\n\nAt the local night club we meet Steve Strange who is acting as bouncer. Kim, Billy, Philip, and George arrive at the club for a big night out. Billy is fascinated by the club's patrons and begins to take pictures of everyone. Steve Strange premieres his new hit record \"Fade To Grey\", but the rest of the revelers are sick of hearing the song so they pull the plug halfway through his performance. Petal turns up dealing drugs but the bouncer kicks him out after a disturbance. The audience is then introduced to another popular face on the New Romantic scene, Marilyn, a man who dresses like Marilyn Monroe (\"Genocide Peroxide\"). We then meet Jane who works for the magazine ID, she asks George for a quote about the New Romantic scene and he gives one.\n\nDuring the night we go into the men's bathroom at the club to find Leigh Bowery, an outrageous fashion designer and performance artist who traveled from his home land, Australia, to be a part of the New Romantic scene. He explains to the audience that he can't get enough of boys with pretty faces. Billy enters the bathroom and is amazed by Leigh's outlandish look (\"I'll Have You All\"). Leigh is instantly attracted to the good looking photographer and gives him his number.\n\nTime has swiftly moved on and Kim and Billy are closer than ever. Billy is taking pictures of Kim modeling her latest creations. The two are falling for each other (\"Love Is a Question Mark\"). Just when they are about to take their actions further, George comes home and makes a scene by flirting with Billy and insisting he should be with him. George and Kim start to argue with each other. Billy is sick of it and runs off.\n\nOut on the street late at night, cross-dressing drug dealer Petal is selling drugs (\"Shelter\"). Billy walks the streets after running out on Kim and George bumps into Petal. He expresses his disgust at Petal's dealing and almost winds up getting attacked by Petal but luckily Billy manages to get away.\n\nBilly's mom is on the phone with Kim and the two talk about their love for Billy. Josie just wants to know that her son is ok. Kim reassures her that he's fine. On her own Kim starts to question whether Billy will still like her even if she removes all her makeup and opens up to him, a prospect terrifying to her (\"Pretty Lies\").\n\nWhen Billy sees Kim without the make up he is shocked out how beautiful she looks. Kim apologizes for her and George arguing and explains it's just how they are and that they love each really. Kim explains to Billy that she is a virgin, and before you know it the two are in the bedroom and couldn't be happier.\n\nGeorge, annoyed that Billy wants to be with Kim instead of him, joins Marilyn and heads down to Selfridges, a department store, to do some shopping. George tells Marilyn that he's met a drummer who wants him to sing in his band, Marilyn is excited for him, if not a little jealous. After a quick run in with the sales girl who is disgusted at the appearance of both men the two discuss their fantasies of being famous (Guttersnipe).\n\nJosie is at home missing Billy and wondering where her life went so wrong, she doesn't love her abusive husband anymore, the only night out she gets is down the local pub, and her life is just going in no direction (Talk Amongst Yourselves). Josie then calls Billy, but he's out and Phillip answers the phone instead. He invites Josie down to London to come and see Billy at Philips club and Josie wholeheartedly decides to go and visit her son.\n\nIts time for George to record his demo with his new group Culture Club and the session goes well, apart from the producer stopping one song after realizing that George was singing about another man. So he records a different song to keep the producer happy (Do You Really Want To Hurt Me). Culture Club start to rise to fame and their single hits number 1. Billy sees George at the club and tries to talk to him but after George felt Billy picked Kim over him George isn't so forthcoming. Eventually George lets Billy take his picture and Billy flirts outrageously, but it appears he is just using George.\n\nGeorge runs into Jane who used to work for ID magazine now works for the Sun, Jane never used to give him any attention in ID magazine but now he's a star she's begging him for an interview. Jane storms out and as she does Billy bumps into her and tells her he's got some pictures of George and asks if the paper would buy them. Jane isn't interested but, she hands Billy her card if he ever has any juicy stories about George and leaves.\n\nBilly tries to talk to George again and asks if he could put a word in for him at his record company to be a photographer. George annoyed that Billy has barely asked him how he is, leaves annoyed. Billy not knowing what to do calls Leigh Bowery who told him to call if he was ever at a loose end. Leigh tells him to come round and that he will make Billy's dreams a reality. Leigh is entering his latest creation in to a talent contest called the Miss Mud Day Queen Ball and wants Billy to model for him. Leigh tells Billy that he can get him in front of the camera instead of behind it, he just has to do everything Leigh tells him to.\n\nWhen Billy gets to Leigh's house, Leigh and his slaves begin to give Billy a makeover to turn him in to a star of the New Romantic scene (Touched By The Hand Of Cool). Leigh tells Billy he will make him the talk of the town and proceeds to call everyone telling them that Billy is now one of his models and will be in the show. Rumors also start to fly that Billy is sleeping with Leigh, which get back to Kim leaving her heartbroken (Church Of The Poisoned Mind).\n\nIt's the day of the Miss Mud Day Queen Ball and Leigh's collection wins the contest, modeling it is Billy now nicknamed Spartacus. Leigh also announces he is opening a club called Taboo. In walks Kim and Billy's mother, shocked at what they see and Leigh makes Kim believe that the two have been sleeping with each other. Kim is outraged and his mother is disappointed in him and the two leave Billy alone (Stranger In This World Reprise).\n\nTaboo is now open and everyone who is anyone is there (Everything Taboo). Kim and Josie, who has decided to leave Billy's dad and stay with Kim in London, go to the club to see what all the fuss is about. Whilst at the club Josie and Kim decide to team up and create a fashion line of their own and rent a flat from Philip who is with them. Billy is now hanging out with Boy George and Kim sees them together and presumes that they are sleeping together. Billy tries to apologise to Kim about the Leigh Bowery incident but Kim doesn't want to hear it, she claims that he is just using people who can help his career. Billy tells Leigh he doesn't want to work as his model anymore as he's unhappy and wants Kim back and Leigh calls him ungrateful. Josie tells Billy she is ashamed of him and annoyed at what he's done to Kim.\n\nGeorge now deeply affected by fame has begun to take drugs specifically with Petal and Marilyn at the club. George gives Billy drugs and Billy asks George if he can work at Virgin Records and be the official Boy George photographer. George agrees and tells Billy to go to Virgin and tell them that he's working for George now and Billy is thrilled.\n\nJosie and Kim are at home and their business is starting to take off. Josie is like a new woman full of ambition, shes found a true friend in Kim and in Philip. Then there's a knock at the door and it's Josie's husband, Derek. He wants her to come home but Josie stands up to him. He takes an instant dislike to Philip and Kim and verbally abuses them causing Josie to kick him out. Josie is shocked she has just stood up to him after all these years (Independent Woman).\n\nBack in George's Apartment he and Marilyn are having a drug binge and George's habit has gotten completely out of control. Billy enters annoyed at George after going to Virgin Records expecting a job but realizing George had not set it up. He tells George enough is enough and that he's killing himself with the drugs (I See Through You). Billy storms out with Marilyn leaving George alone.\n\nWalking home from the shop Philip sees Josie's husband at the bus stop. Philip tells Derek that Josie did the right thing ending it with him. Derek beats Philip up in the street and spits on him, leaving Philip bruised and bloodied (Petrified).\n\nLeigh's live in helper Sue, opens a giant curtain to reveal that Leigh has installed himself behind a sheet of glass as a work of art at an art gallery. He explains to the audience that he is art (Ich Bin Kunst). After his performance art Sue tells Leigh that he needs to go to the hospital for a check up, but Leigh won't go, he's obviously scared about his HIV positive status.\n\nBilly has been away to New York to photograph Marilyn's first concert to launch his debut single. When he arrives in London he goes to see his Mom, Kim, and Philip. Kim still refuses to talk to Billy. Billy tells her that he can't stop thinking of her and apologizes for sleeping with George. Kim starts to come around but unfortunately her efforts are wasted as George turns up at the house and has a go at Billy for leaving him and going to New York with Marilyn. George collapses in a heap on the floor. Josie and Kim are shocked at Billy for knowing that George was abusing drugs and not trying to help him.\n\nBilly meets up with Jane and gives her pictures of George using drugs and the full story about his addiction. He takes no money, he does it thinking that it will push George to get help. The story breaks and the media is outrage at George.\n\nGeorge is arrested for possession of drugs and the seriousness of his addiction hits him. George, Steve Strange, Marilyn and Billy all ponder how they have his rock bottom. George reflects how quick his life is falling apart, Marilyn thinks about his failed career, Steve realizes he's a has been, and Billy is riddled with guilt over what he has done to George (Out Of Fashion).\n\nAt the hospital Leigh lays dying of AIDS, his trusted friend Sue is the only with him when he dies (I'l Adore)\n\nBack on the street of London Petal is still dealing drugs, annoyed Billy tries to stop him selling to a young boy and ends up in fight with Petal. The dealer pulls a knife on Billy but just in the nick of time George turns up to rescue him. The two talk about everything what has happened and the mistakes they have made. Billy apologizes for informing the media about Georges addiction, but George tells him that Billy revealing the story saved his life (Pie In The Sky).\n\nBilly tells George how he's going to India to take some time to study with the Hare Krishners and that George should join with him if he'd like. So George, Billy, Philip, Kim, and Josie all go travel to India. After a few weeks the group decides to go home after finding the answers they were looking for, but Billy decides he's going to stay for a while and take some time to think (Bow Down Mister).\n\n\n\nEncore:\n\nEncore:\n\nTwo cast recordings exist for the stage musical \"Taboo\": The first, published in 2002, features the original West End cast, and a second album was published in 2004 featuring the original cast of the Broadway production.\n\n"}

He played college football for the University of Miami, won the Heisman Trophy in 1992, and was a member of the Miami Hurricanes' national championship teams of 1989 and 1991. A seventh-round pick in the 1993 NFL Draft, he was a member of several NFL teams, but never became a regular starter as a pro. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2010.\n\nTorretta was born in Pinole, California. He graduated from Pinole Valley High School, where he was a standout high school football quarterback for the Pinole Spartans.\n\nTorretta accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Miami, where he played for the Miami Hurricanes football team from 1989 to 1992.\n\nAs a quarterback for the Hurricanes, Torretta spent his first two seasons mostly on the bench behind then starting quarterback Craig Erickson, with his only significant playing time coming with three starts in 1989 after Erickson injured his throwing hand. During that span, however, the then-unknown Torretta lit up San Diego State for 485 yards, setting a school record for most passing yards in a game that was only broken on September 29, 2012 by Stephen Morris.\n\nIn his first year as a starter, Torretta garnered further attention by stealing the show in a nationally televised 1991 game versus the Houston Cougars and their Heisman-frontrunning quarterback, David Klingler. As Miami's defense cut down Houston's run-and-shoot offense, Torretta put on the performance that many expected out of Klingler en route to a 40–10 victory; Klingler's lone touchdown pass in the game came with three seconds left in the fourth quarter against Miami's third-string defense, long after the game was decided. Torretta went on to lead Miami to a fourth-quarter comeback win on the road versus #1 Florida State and ultimately to an undefeated season and a co-national championship.\n\nTorretta passed for more than 3,000 yards his senior year in 1992 on his way to winning the Heisman and the Davey O'Brien Award that season. He also won the Walter Camp Award, the Maxwell Award, the Johnny Unitas Trophy and the Chic Harley Award. One of the key games of the season came against West Virginia when he threw for 363 yards and two touchdowns in the 35–23 victory. His career as quarterback at Miami was hugely successful, with Torretta leading the team to 26 wins and only one loss.\n\nIn the 1993 Sugar Bowl, Torretta's Hurricanes were dominated by the Alabama Crimson Tide's defense. Alabama won the game, 34–13, and the national championship.\n\nDespite his collegiate-level success, Torretta was not a top NFL draft pick, and his NFL career was fairly unremarkable. He was not selected until the Minnesota Vikings took him in the seventh round in the 1993 NFL draft and then did not play him at all that year. In 1994, Torretta was on the Vikings' roster, and then was picked up by the Detroit Lions. As was the case in 1993, he failed to play at all in 1994, serving the entire season in a backup role with the Lions.\n\nIn 1995, Torretta moved to NFL Europe and was also on the roster for the San Francisco 49ers and Detroit Lions but was again relegated to backup roles. He was cut by the 49ers in 1996 and subsequently picked up by the Seattle Seahawks. His only chance to play in an NFL game came in the 1996 season finale when he came off the bench for the Seahawks against the Oakland Raiders. He immediately threw a 32-yard touchdown pass to Joey Galloway that put Seattle ahead, leading the team to victory.\n\nIn 1997, Torretta was on the roster for Seattle and later the Indianapolis Colts but again did not play. After the 1997 season, he retired from the NFL.\n\nTorretta followed his NFL career with a position at Wachovia Securities as a Senior Financial Advisor.\n\nHe is Chairman/CEO of Touchdown Radio, broadcasting an NCAA game of the week on national radio. He is also an NCAA football expert on Sirius/XM channel 91—College Sports Nation.\n\nTorretta is Vice President for GAMCO Asset Management, working with Institutional clients nationwide and working out of the firm's Palm Beach office.\n\n"}

He was involved in the founding of the long-running comic \"2000 AD\" in 1977.\n\nGosnell was working as a sub-editor in IPC's competition department when Pat Mills asked if he would be interested in working on \"Action\" where he wrote \"Dredger\" and \"The Suicide Club\". It was during this period that he read an article in the \"Evening Standard\" on the forthcoming sci-fi films in the late seventies and concluded that a science-fiction comic would complement the other genres the company was publishing. He suggested it to managing editor Jack Le Grand who turned it down, but mentioned it to Mills who suggested Gosnell write his ideas down in a memo, which Mills then passed on to John Sanders, head of the Youth Group in IPC. Sanders recalls Gosnell from those years:\n\n\"Gosnell wrote lots of memos and Le Grand stuffed lots of them. I liked talking to Gosnell. He was a better ideas man than he was an editor, and there is always a place for someone like him. Gosnell was enormously noisy, enormously enthusiastic. He was a great guy to have around because he was always bubbling. Good ideas men often create dissent. You have to give them space to do that.\"\n\nSanders liked the ideas and passed it over to Mills to develop into a dummy issue to show to the IPC Board. After it was approved Mills brought Gosnell onto the staff in an official capacity as he recalls \"I felt I owed Kelvin something for suggesting the idea in the first place, for which he hadn't been paid. I asked for him to be appointed editor designate. His input was valuable on strips like \"M.A.C.H. 1\" and \"Dan Dare\", because of his technical and science fiction knowledge.\" Kevin O'Neill, who was the art assistant in the early days, recalls the discussion between Mills and Gosnell \"They had these ranting conversations, lots of swearing and cursing... Pat and Kelvin had a poisonous, venomous hatred of cosy editorial chats seen in the like of \"Valiant\", that sort of kindly 'Uncle Editor' stuff. They wanted to do the opposite of that, an irreverent sort of editorial figure.\" Gosnell suggested either \"an imperious intelligent alien or a computer\" and it was the former that met with the most approval. They then bought a latex Neanderthal mask, added a pony tail, a brooch (for the Rosette of Sirius) and Gosnell put it on with a grey jumpsuit with silver stripes to complete the outfit. Tharg's alien slang also largely came from Gosnell based on \"invented swearwords from his schooldays.\"\n\nMills resigned after the first 16 issues, partly because of the interference from senior management, and handed the reins to Gosnell. Nick Landau moved over from \"Action\" to become Gosnell's chief sub-editor. Gosnell relied more on Landau when he had to oversee the launch of \"Starlord\", and the eventual merger of the title into \"2000 AD\", which saw Landau swap places with \"Battle\" sub-editor Steve MacManus. Gosnell eventually resigned from his editorship over friction with managing editor Bob Bartholomew, during the time of the launch of \"Tornado\" (1979), with MacManus being promoted to editor. Gosnell would continue to work on \"Tornado\" as both editor and freelance writer during its short run.\n\nOn the writing front Gosnell is best known for his three adaptations of Harry Harrison's \"The Stainless Steel Rat\", illustrated by Carlos Ezquerra and serialized in 1979, 1980 and 1984 in \"2000 AD\". He also co-wrote the 1977 series of \"Dan Dare\" for that weekly comic. Kelvin also worked for the Dutch comic strip weekly \"Eppo\" for a number of years, writing \"Storm\", with art by Don Lawrence, and \"Rud Hart\", art by Belgian artist Gilbert DeClerq.

Based upon parallax measurements from the Hipparcos astrometry satellite, it lies at a distance of about from the Sun.\n\nThe two components are designated Beta Draconis A (officially named Rastaban , the traditional name of the system) and B.\n\n\"β Draconis\" (Latinised to \"Beta Draconis\") is the system's Bayer designation. The designations of the two components as \"Beta Draconis A\" and \"B\" derive from the convention used by the Washington Multiplicity Catalog (WMC) for multiple star systems, and adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU).\n\nIt bore the traditional name \"Rastaban\", which has also been used for Gamma Draconis. This name, less commonly written \"Rastaben\", derives from the Arabic phrase \"ra's ath-thu'ban\" \"head of the serpent/dragon\". It was also known as \"Asuia\" and \"Alwaid\" , the latter from the Arabic \"al-ʽawāʼidh\" \"the old mother camels\". In 2016, the IAU organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN approved the name \"Rastaban\" for the component Beta Draconis A on 21 August 2016 and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names.\n\nBeta Draconis is part of the asterism of the Mother Camels (Arabic \"al'awa'id\"), along with Gamma Draconis (Eltanin), Mu Draconis (Erakis), Nu Draconis (Kuma) and Xi Draconis (Grumium), which was later known as the \"Quinque Dromedarii\".\n\nIn Chinese, (), meaning \"Celestial Flail\", refers to an asterism consisting of Beta Draconis, Xi Draconis, Nu Draconis, Gamma Draconis and Iota Herculis. Consequently, the Chinese name for Beta Draconis itself is known as (, ).\n\nThe binary system consists of a bright giant orbited by a dwarf companion once every four millennia or so.\n\nCompared to the Sun, Beta Draconis A is an enormous star with six times the mass and roughly 40 times the radius. At this size, it is emitting about 950 times the luminosity of the Sun from its outer envelope at an effective temperature of 5,160 K, giving it the yellow hue of a G-type star. The spectrum matches a stellar classification of G2 II, with the luminosity class of II indicating it is a bright giant. It is about 67 million years old.\n\n"}

The male has brilliantly colored wings that give it its name.\n\nThe male has the upper side wings a brilliant sky blue, with a fine black line round the edge and a white margin. The female is chocolate brown with a few blue scales near the base, and with orange spots, bordered by blue scales, around the edge of the hind wing. The fringes are chequered both sexes.

(81 c) [now a full species]. Also in Europe occur occasionally specimens with traces of some submarginal dots an the hindwing above, without the other characters of \"punctifera\"; Aigner-Abafi named this form ab. \"parvipuncta\". If such dots are present on the forewing, we have ab. \"puncta\" Tutt. The ocelli of the underside may either be so enlarged that some become confluent (\"confluens\" Aign., \"striata\" Tutt), or they may become obsolete: ab. \"krodeli\" Gillm. (= \"cinnides\" Stgr., \"adonis\" Hbn. pt.) (81 c). The specimens in which only the usually present basal ocelli of the forewing are absent are ab. \"sapphirus\" Meig. — Egg semiglobular, with the top some-what impressed, pale green, reticulated with white. Larva bright leaf-green, with dark dorsal stripe accompanied by small orange yellow spots, which form two subdorsal lines; similar yellow stripes on the sides; head black. Until April and again in the summer on \"Hippocrepis\" and \"Coronilla\". Pupa green or brown,\nwith a dark stripe on the Idaek, on or close to the ground. The butterflies are on the wing in May and June and again in August, in the South a third time in September and October. They love open places, fallow ground, young plantations and sunny slopes; they rest in day-time with open wings and sleep on Umbels, Thistles, and Scabious, also on stalks of grass, keeping the wings tightly closed. When disturbed they fall with a jump into the grass. They are common at their flight-places in most districts and occur in mountains up to 7000 ft.\n\nGerman entomologist S. A. von Rottemburg described the Adonis blue in 1775 as \"Papilio bellargus\", noting it was very rare locally but came to his garden in June.\n\nThe preferred habitat of the Adonis blue is calcareous grasslands with hot and dry conditions. This is because the larva feeds on horseshoe vetch (\"Hippocrepis comosa\") which is largely restricted to these habitats. This plant flourishes on sheep-grazed pastures and disappears after a few years when cattle graze. Sometimes human-created landforms provide refuges for the plant and the butterfly; an example of this is on Martin Down in Dorset, where horseshoe vetch only occurs on ancient earthworks with thin calcareous soils.\n\nThe Adonis blue is at the most northerly edge of its range in Britain and has always been restricted to the warmer dry calcareous grasslands of southern England. It has been declining over the last fifty years because its habitat has been disappearing through changing agricultural practices; over the whole of Britain there has been a decline of over 90% in numbers since 1950. It has been lost from Cambridgeshire, Essex, Suffolk, and the Chilterns; its strongholds are Dorset, Wiltshire, Sussex and the Isle of Wight. There are efforts from conservation organisations and local Biodiversity Action Plans to encourage the populations of chalk-grassland butterflies through managed grazing programs. The recent hot and dry weather associated with climate change seems to be beneficial for this species by making more habitats suitable. In 2006 it had returned to a site in the Cotswolds in Gloucestershire, where it had vanished 40 years previously.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2212221", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2212221", "title": "Antoine Wiertz", "text": "Antoine Wiertz\n\nAntoine Joseph Wiertz (22 February 1806 – 18 June 1865) was a Belgian romantic painter and sculptor.\n\nBorn in Dinant from a relatively poor family, he entered the Antwerp art academy in 1820. Thanks to his protector Pierre-Joseph de Paul de Maibe, a member of the Second Chamber of the States-General, king William I of the Netherlands awarded an annual stipend to Wiertz from 1821 onwards. Between November 1829 and May 1832, he stayed in Paris, where he studied the old masters at the Louvre.\n\nIn 1828, Wiertz came out second in the competition for the prestigious \"Prix de Rome\" which he attained on his second attempt in 1832; it enabled him to go to the French Academy at Rome, where he resided from May 1834 until February 1837. Upon his return, he established himself in Liège with his mother.\n\nDuring his stay in Rome, Wiertz worked on his first great work, \"Les Grecs et les Troyens se disputant le corps de Patrocle\" (\"Greeks and Trojans fighting for the body of Patroclus\", finished in 1836), on a subject borrowed from book XVII of Homer's \"Iliad\". It was exhibited in Antwerp in 1837, where it met with some success. Wiertz submitted the work for the Paris \"Salon\" of 1838, but it arrived too late and was refused.\n\nAt the Paris \"Salon\" of 1839, Wiertz showed not only his \"Patrocles\", but also three other works: \"Madame Laetitia Bonaparte sur son lit de mort\" (\"Madame Laetitia Bonaparte on her deathbed\"), \"La Fable des trois souhaits—Insatiabilité humaine\" (\"The fable of the three wishes—Human insatiability\") and \"Le Christ au tombeau\" (\"Christ entombed\"). Badly hung and lit, his entry elicited indifference on the part of the public, and provoked sarcasm among the critics. This second humiliation led to a profound rancour against art critics and against Paris, as expressed in his virulent pamphlet \"Bruxelles capitale, Paris province\".\n\nIn 1844, Wiertz painted a second version of his \"Patrocles\" on an even bigger scale than the first (the 1836 version measures 3.85m by 7.03m; the 1844 version 5.20m by 8.52). The Rome version is now in the Museum of Walloon Art in Liège, the 1844 in the Wiertz Museum in Brussels.\n\nAfter the Paris disaster, Wiertz veered more and more to the excessive. A fine example is the monumental \"La Chute des Anges rebelles\" (\"The Fall of the rebellious Angels\", 1841), on an arched canvas of 11.53m by 7.93m.\n\nThe death of his mother in 1844 was a terrible blow to the artist. He left Liège in 1845 to settle in Brussels for good. During this period he painted a confrontation of Beauty and Death, \"Deux jeunes filles—La Belle Rosine\" (1847), which remains perhaps his most famous work.\nDissatisfied with the shiny effect of oil painting, he developed a new technique combining the smoothness of oil painting with the speed of execution and the dullness of painting in fresco. This technique of \"mat painting\" entailed the use of a mixture of colours, turpentine and petrol on holland. \"La Lutte homérique\" (\"The Homeric struggle\", 1853) was the first big-scale painting executed in this technique. However, the components used in this technique are responsible for the slow decay of the works produced with it.\n\nMany of his works from the 1850s have a social or philosophical message, often translated in delirious imagery, like \"Faim, Folie et Crime\" (\"Hunger, Madness and Crime\", 1853), \"La Liseuse de Romans\" (\"The Reader of Novels\", 1853), \"Le Suicide\" (\"The Suicide\", 1854), \"L'Inhumation précipitée\" (\"The premature burial\", 1854), \"Le Dernier Canon\" (\"The last gun\", 1855).\n\nWiertz was also a fine portrait painter, who made self-portraits at various ages. As a sculptor, he produced his most important project towards the end of his life: a series of plasters representing \"Les Quatre Âges de l'Humanité\" (\"The Four Ages of Humanity\", 1860–1862), reproduced in marble for the Wiertz museum by Auguste Franck.\n\nInfluenced mainly by Rubens and the late Michelangelo, Wiertz' monumental painting often moves between classical academism and lurid romanticism, between the grandiose and the ridiculous. Although his work was often derided as \"art pompier\", his pictorial language nevertheless preannounced symbolism and a certain kind of surrealism, two currents that would be very strong in Belgian painting.\n\nAfter difficult negotiations with the Belgian government, Wiertz was able to realize his dream to turn his last studio into a museum for his works. The Belgian State bought a piece of land and funded the construction of a huge hall to accommodate the painter's monumental works. In exchange, Wiertz donated all his works to the Belgian State, with the express proviso that they should remain in his studio both during and after his lifetime.\n\nWiertz died in his studio. His remains were embalmed in accordance with Ancient Egyptian burial rites and buried in a vault in the municipal cemetery of Ixelles.\n\nA copy of one of Antoine Wiertz's works, the statue of \"The Triumph of Light\" was once prominently located high on San Francisco's Mount Olympus between the Haight-Ashbury and Corona Heights. It had been presented to the city of San Francisco by Adolph Sutro in 1887. Over the years due to lack of care and maintenance the statue fell into disrepair. By the late 1930s, even the history and origins of the statue were no longer common knowledge in San Francisco, and by the mid-1950s, the statue disappeared. All that remains today is the pedestal and base of the monument.\n\n\nThe Antoine Wiertz Museum is now one of the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium. It is located in the Leopold district of Brussels, near the Luxembourg railway station, today overshadowed by the European Parliament complex. The Rue Wiertz runs from the museum through the Parliament complex, in an unintended echo of Wiertz' call for Brussels to become the capital of Europe.\n\nContemporary opinions of the museum and the works therein are mixed:\n\n"}

Established in 1888, it is the oldest and largest zoological park in Texas and is managed by the non-profit Dallas Zoological Society. It is home to over 2,000 animals representing 406 species. It is an accredited member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), and is a member of the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA).\n\nSince 2009, when the Dallas City Council voted unanimously to turn the zoo over to private management under the DZS, attendance and community support for the zoo has surged. In 2015, the zoo achieved an all-time annual attendance record of 1 million+ visitors. The Dallas Zoological Society is supported by over 25,510 membership households and growing.\n\nThe zoo was established in 1888. The zoo's first purchase was two deer and two mountain lions for $60 from a private seller in Colorado City, Colorado. The animals were placed in pens and put on display in City Park. In the 1890s, the Dallas City Council approved funding for the zoo and more animals were purchased and added to the zoo's collection. The zoo called City Park home until 1910, when it was relocated to Fair Park. In 1912, the zoo moved to in Marsalis Park which the city had purchased in 1909, from which it has expanded to its current size. Under the leadership of Zoo Commissioner William H. Atwell, the zoo acquired many more animals as well as exhibits. In the 1920s, a special Zoo Commission was created by the city and the collection was further developed with the acquisition of numerous specimens from game hunter and trapper Frank Buck. In the Depression Era of the 1930s, the facilities at the zoo underwent extensive renovation funded by the Works Progress Administration.\n\nThe Dallas Zoological Society was established in 1955 to support the zoo.\n\nBy the 1960s, the zoo was a popular and profitable attraction. In 1966, the zoo displayed over five hundred species of animals. However, by the 1980s, attitudes began to change from the profit driven display of animals toward science and the humane treatment of animals strongly advocated by the AZA. More emphasis was put on saving endangered species and breeding animals in captivity. The Dallas Zoo cooperated with this program and was accredited in 1985. Around the same time, Zoo Director Warren J. Iliff proposed an addition to be known as the Wilds of Africa. Herbert W. Reimer, a New York architect, designed the Wilds of Africa with a \"zoogeographic grouping\" of African animals. In addition to a nature trail, he further envisioned a slow moving monorail that visitors could ride and observe as if on safari. Two bond measures, amounting to $30.4 million, brought the expansion from the drawing board in 1983 to its opening in June 1990.\n\nOn June 14, 1996, rail and bus service arrived at the zoo. Dallas Zoo station opened on the first phase of the . The connection to DART made getting to the zoo significantly more convenient.\n\nIn 1997, the Kimberly-Clark Chimpanzee Forest exhibit opened to the public.\n\nOn May 8, 1999, the , $4.5 million ExxonMobil Endangered Tiger Habitat opened.\n\nOn September 3, 2008, the zoo announced it had received the largest gift in its 120-year history, a $5 million donation from Harold Simmons. This donation, as well as other factors, allowed the zoo to fast track the construction of the Giants of the Savanna habitat.\n\nOn August 12, 2009, the Dallas City Council voted unanimously to turn the zoo over to private management. On October 1, 2009, the zoo's management responsibilities, animals, and employees were officially turned over to the Dallas Zoological Society.\n\nOn May 28, 2010, the Giants of the Savanna habitat opened to national acclaim.\n\nOn April 1, 2015, the Dinosaur exhibit opened hosting over 20 animatronic dinosaurs.\n\nThe zoo is divided into two major regions: ZooNorth and Wilds of Africa. ZooNorth is the original and oldest section of the zoo. The Wilds of Africa region was constructed seventy-eight years after ZooNorth and is accessed from ZooNorth via a tunnel beneath Clarendon Drive. It includes Giants of the Savanna, which was opened in 2010. Visitors can download the Dallas Zoo iPhone app to assist them in navigating the zoo. The zoo app is free and provides information about hours, admission, parking, directions, animals, membership, educational programs, and special events, as well as maps. The zoo is the first in the United States to offer visitors such an app in both English and Spanish.\n\nZooNorth is the original and oldest section of the zoo. It features a wide range of exhibits such as the Otter Outpost, Galápagos tortoises, and Bug U!. The Hill, one of the original parts of the zoo, was closed as many of the animals there were moved to the new Giants of the Savanna exhibit. One of the more recent additions to ZooNorth is the Wildlife Amphitheater. The Wildlife Amphitheater is home to SOAR! A Festival of Flight. Primate Place features monkeys, with species from Africa and South America. ZooNorth is also home to the Pierre A. Fontaine Bird & Reptile Building where visitors are encouraged to learn about endangered reptiles, amphibians, and what can be done to save them.\n\nThe ExxonMobil Endangered Tiger Habitat is a , $4.5 million habitat that opened on May 8, 1999 and resembles a forest in the process of regrowth after logging. A glass viewing area and pathways allow the visitor to observe Sumatran tigers and Malayan tigers. The tigers' lush exhibits feature sun and shade, shallow pools with deep channels, running streams with hot rocks, perching rocks, and climbing/clawing trees. The observation area of the exhibit consists of two buildings; House of Tiger and House of Man, designed in the Thai pole house style. The complex acts as a bridge spanning the Valley of the Tiger placing the visitors in the center of the tiger's landscape.\n\nThe Lacerte Family Children's Zoo in ZooNorth is home to the Nature Exchange, the JC Penney Discovery House, the UnderZone, a petting zoo, and pony rides. It also features an artificial creek that children are encouraged to splash around in.\n\nAn exhibit that teaches children about the zoo's extensive collection of invertebrates (i.e. a termite colony, honey bee colony, Texas leafcutter ants, black widows, and brown recluse spiders).\n\nThe other half of the zoo is the Wilds of Africa. Opened in 1990, it was the first exhibit to feature all of the major habitats of Africa. Visitors can visit the rain forests, mountains, woodlands, rivers, deserts, and bush of Africa. The Nature Trail takes visitors through the rain forest past two large, naturalistic gorilla habitats. Nile crocodiles, wattled cranes, and a few other animals are seen before the Forest Aviary. In the middle of the forest is the Kopje, home to rock hyraxes, klipspringers, and meerkats. The rain forest/watering hole is also home to hippopotamus and okapi, which the zoo, in the case of the latter, is famous for in both its breeding and research. About 20 percent of okapi in zoos in the U.S. and Japan can trace their lineage back to it.\nPenguin Cove is home to about a dozen African penguins. The penguins can be seen above and under the water as they walk and swim around their exhibit.\n\nThe Kimberly-Clark Chimpanzee Forest exhibit opened in 1997. Visitors can observe the chimpanzees from the open air viewing station or from the floor-to-ceiling observation windows. Chimpanzee Forest features a waterfall, stream, climbing structures, trees and rocks that are heated in the winter and cooled in the summer. Another feature is an artificial termite mound where the chimpanzees can fish with long sticks for special treats, such as peanut butter and honey. In addition to their food from the zoo commissary, there are more than 40 edible plants in their area for them to forage on.\n\nOriginally opened in 1990, the Gorilla Research Center is a habitat featuring a lush naturalistic landscape. The habitat was designed in a way that encourages the gorillas to roam freely in an environment that replicates, as closely as possible, their native equatorial forest habitat. The exhibit includes two areas, separated by a wall, which provide enough room for two gorilla troops. The exhibit closed in 2004 and reopened in 2006 after undergoing a $2.2 million renovation to raise the exhibit walls from 12 feet to 15 feet and add a visitor's center. The visitor's center is known as the Gorilla Research Station. It features high vantage points and floor-to-ceiling windows where visitors can interact with the gorillas and have their questions answered by on site gorilla guides. The habitat is currently home to two gorilla troops; a bachelor troop and a family troop. The bachelors are named Juba, B'wenzi, Shana, and Zola. Juba and B'wenzi came to the Dallas Zoo in 2011 and Shana and Zola, half-brothers, arrived in 2013. The family troop members are Subira, the silverback, Madge, and her daughter, Shanta, and Megan. The goal was for former silverback Patrick and one of the females to breed but in September 2013 the plan was abandoned due to Patrick's lack of interest in reproducing.\n\nCrocodile Isle allows visitors to view Nile crocodiles from behind glass. Visitors can watch crocodiles swim, lounge in the sun, and even devour their food at public feedings.\n\nThe Forest Aviary contains colorful and exotic birds native only to Africa in a habitat featuring a wooded landscape, rock cliffs, and a tranquil stream.\n\nThe Wilds of Africa Adventure Safari is a 20-minute, one-mile, narrated monorail ride, which travels around the watering hole (hippopotamus) rain forest (okapi), mountain (Nubian ibex), woodlands (Grévy's zebra), river (waterbuck, greate white pelicans, Goliath herons, blue cranes), arid desert (scimitar-horned oryx, addra gazelle), semi-arid desert (addax, gemsbok, ostrich) and bush (gerenuk, black crowned cranes, greater kudu, Thomson's gazelle, marabou storks) exhibits. The monorail features aerial views of the Simmons Hippo Outpost, Chimpanzee Forest, Nile crocodile, and Penguin Cove exhibits, which are also accessible via the Nature Trail. The monorail originally opened in 1990 but after two decades of use and over a million passengers, the attraction began to show its age with aging infrastructure and several electrical outages that left passengers stranded on the tour. The final incident in August 2014 prompted zoo officials to shut down the attraction for evaluation. Following the evaluation the DZS decided a $3 million renovation was in order. On March 25, 2016, the Monorail Safari reopened as the Wilds of Africa Adventure Safari featuring a new sound system, an upgraded station, air-conditioning, upgraded mechanical and electrical components and new graphics on the individual cars. Additionally, a diesel powered tug is now on standby to nudge the trains back to the station in the event of a power failure.\n\n\nPhase II of the Wilds of Africa, Giants of the Savanna, opened on May 28, 2010. This is an expansion to the current Wilds of Africa, and features four female African elephants, a large herd of reticulated giraffes, African lions, South African cheetahs, impala, Grant's zebras, ostriches, guineafowl, warthogs, red river hogs and the newest attraction African Wild Dogs. Visitors have the opportunity to feed lettuce leaves and rye crackers to the herd of giraffe at the Giraffe Feeding Station. Five of the eleven acres are dedicated to the eight African elephants; Jenny, Gypsy, Kamba, Congo, Tendaji, Mlilo, Zola, Ajabu. The elephants' facilities are state of the art with padded floors and a community room with seven feet of dirt that allows the pachyderms to indulge their natural inclination for digging. The exhibit is the first in North America to mix elephants with giraffes, zebras, ostriches, impala, and guineafowl.\nAlso in the exhibit is a pride of four lions and a family of three cheetahs. In between the lion and cheetah exhibits, there is a \"Predator Encounter\" area where the keepers give educational talks.\nClimate controlled rocks draw the lions to a floor-to-ceiling bay window at the Serengeti Grill, where they sit or lay within mere inches of diners.\nOn March 11, 2016, five new African elephants arrived from Swaziland in order to escape a drought. Two years later, Nolwazi and her daughter Amahle were transferred to Fresno Chaffee Zoo in Fresno, California.\n\nOn October 6, 2011, the zoo received special recognition from the Association of Zoos and Aquariums for the Giants of the Savanna Habitat. The $32.5 million habitat is the first in North America, as well as one of the first on the planet, to combine a variety of large species in a single exhibit in order to re-create the landscape of the African savanna.\n\nThe zoo is highly proactive in species preservation and conservation efforts and participates in over 40 Species Survival Plans (SSP) with the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. The following is a list of the Species Survival Plans (SSP) that the zoo is involved with\n\n\nThe zoo supports many conservation projects including Okapi Conservation - Epulu Research Station, Zaire, International Rhino Foundation, Chimp Haven, Bushmeat Crisis Task Force, Gray's Monitor Lizard In The Philippines, Taxon Advisory Groups (Tag), Bowling For Rhinos, and the Thailand Hornbill Project - Adopt A Hornbill Nest. In addition to conservation, sustainability efforts by the zoo include growing bamboo and cabbage to function as part of the landscape aesthetic throughout the zoo. The overgrowth is harvested and used as food for the zoo's herbivores.\n\nThe zoo collects and recycles cell phones through a program called ECO-CELL. The objective of both the zoo and ECO-CELL is to reduce coltan mining. Coltan is a raw material used in the manufacturing process of cell phones and it is mined almost exclusively in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The mining results in a loss of habitat for gorillas, elephants, okapi and many others. For every cell phone recycled through ECO-CELL, the zoo receives a donation to its conservation fund. ECO-CELL has partnerships with over 110 zoos and is a member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA).\n\nSafari Nights is the zoo's concert series that takes place on eight consecutive Saturday nights during the summer season.\n\nRunning For Rhinos is a 1k or 5k run to raise money to help protect rhinos in the wild. The event features door prizes, massages, awards, and foods.\n\nHalloween Nights at the Dallas Zoo is a four night event held every October just days before Halloween.\n\nZoo To Do is the zoo's annual fundraising gala. Patrons of this exclusive event have the opportunity to view the animals, enjoy food from some of Dallas’ top chefs, bid on auction items, and dance.\n\nDollar Day at the zoo is held one day in July and one day in November. The zoo shows its appreciation to the community for its support with $1 admission all day. Families can look for dollar deals on food, drinks and gifts throughout the zoo.\n\nIn Spring 2017, hippos returned to the zoo for the first time since the death of their last hippo 15 years back with the opening of Simmons Hippo Outpost. In February 2016 ground was broken on the $13.5 million, 3.5 acre immersive habitat that houses three Nile hippos; one male and two females. The habitat features an overlook deck and an underwater viewing area as well as be visible from the Wilds of Africa Monorail Safari.\n\nThe Dallas Zoo Conservation Education & Science Center is a proposed facility that will be located adjacent to ZooNorth. The facility will be a teaching laboratory for conservation of the world ecology systems and will be LEED certified silver level category. It will include research, teaching and interpretive facilities, and will become the new entrance to the zoo. This project is currently in the design phase and on hold pending funding.\n\nThe nearest DART station is Dallas Zoo on the . The zoo is also served by bus routes 19, 515 and 522.\n\nEvery Monday and Tuesday, from March through December, the zoo offers $2 off admission to visitors who present their same-day DART pass at the Dallas Zoo ticket booth.\n\nOn March 18, 2004, a gorilla named Jabari scaled a retaining wall and injured four visitors. He was fatally shot by a police SWAT team after being pursued by zoo employees through the Wilds of Africa exhibit. This incident prompted several zoos to create or enhance emergency response teams to deal with escaped animals. The Jake L. Hamon Gorilla Research Center was redesigned with new landscape, taller walls, and expanded viewing areas for visitors, including an air conditioned visitor center with floor-to-ceiling windows, videos, and on-site “gorilla guides” to answer questions and point out interesting facts. The exhibit is home to two gorilla troops.\n\nOn November 17, 2013, one of the male lions, either Dinari or Kamaia, killed Johari, one of the three lionesses. Witnesses to the tragedy say that it appeared that both of the male lions were simply roughhousing with Johari. Apparently one of the males seized Johari by the neck, cutting off her oxygen supply. Witnesses said they didn't know Johari had been killed until she went visibly limp. By then, zoo keepers were on the scene throwing meat into the habitat in an attempt to distract the two brothers. Dallas Zoo officials later confirmed that Johari sustained no other wounds and was killed quickly by the bite she suffered to the neck. A reason for the attack was not immediately determined.\n\nOn January 7, 2014, The Dallas Zoo announced that Kamau, a six month old cheetah cub, died from a bout of pneumonia. He and his brother, Winspear, were both sick with the illness, and Kamau suddenly worsened and went into cardiac arrest. He could not be revived. The two cubs were originally born at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Front Royal, Virginia.\n\nOn July 28, 2015, a giraffe calf named Kipenzi died when she broke her neck after accidentally running into the edge of her herd's enclosure. Kipenzi was born into fame after her birth was broadcast and streamed live on Animal Planet.\n\nOn October 10, 2018, a hippo named Adhama suddenly died, according to the zoo. They said that the hippo became ill, and later found him unresponsive. An examination revealed that Adhama had severe enteritis, which is the acute inflammation of the intestines. Earlier in the year, Boipelo, the mate to the deceased hippo, gave birth to their calf, but it died of natural causes moments after birth. In 2019, Adhama became the late father to Boipelo's second calf, Adanna. She was named after her father.\n\nOn June 17, 2019, Witten, a one year old giraffe, suddenly died during a medical exam. While under anesthetics, he stopped breathing, and the zoo staff could not revive him. The zoo said he was due to be transported to Canada in September, and they were doing his examinations. He was named after current Dallas Cowboys tight end Jason Witten.\n\nOn July 4, 2019, Ola, an 8 year old African painted dog recently obtained by the Dallas Zoo, was found dead in her back enclosure. She died after her pack mates, Mzingo and Jata, attacked her and delivered wounds that were fatal. Ola was transported from the Columbus Zoo a few weeks prior to her death, and seemed to get along well with her packmates. The Dallas Zoo said on Twitter the dogs were only exhibiting natural behavior, and they did nothing wrong.\n\nOn November 4, 2019, the Dallas Zoo announced that Hope, a twenty-three year old western lowland gorilla, had passed away without warning. The zoo reported that the gorilla family was suffering from a bout of gastrointestinal issues, and while the cause of death was not immediately confirmed, a necropsy found Hope's colon severely inflamed. Hope became famous when she gave birth to Saambili, the first gorilla baby the Dallas Zoo had in twenty years. According to the zoo, Saambili and her family were \"understandably shaken\" and were taken off the habitat for a period of time to recover.\n\nOn March 27, 2020, the Dallas Zoo revealed on social media that silverback gorilla Subira had died of heart failure. He had a cough that was being monitored; zoologists believed he had \"nothing more of a common cold\". A necropsy revealed that Subira had a cardiovascular disease. The zoo had worked closely in research on how to prevent heart disease in male gorillas, which is the number one cause of death in them. It was also said that Subira was healthy and examinations confirmed nothing was wrong. The zoo has said he did not catch coronavirus, a disease causing a worldwide pandemic. Subira was the second gorilla death at the zoo in four months following the death of Hope in November 2019. Before his death he fathered two children, Saambili and Mbani. He was the only full-grown silverback in the group, which contains three female gorillas and one baby male: Megan, Shanta, Saambili, and Mbani.\n\n"}

It moved from a group established to challenge the leadership of the party from the left to the vanguard of Tony Blair's drive to modernise the party's organisation and policies.\n\nThe LCC was established in 1978 to co-ordinate the efforts of the Labour left. As such it was extremely broad including, for instance, members of the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy, Labour Briefing, and the fiercely anti-Trotskyist National Organisation of Labour Students (NOLS).\n\nIn 1981, the LCC supported the campaign of Tony Benn against Denis Healey for the deputy leadership of the party, but many were deeply unhappy with Benn's campaign and approach and the LCC began to evolve into a body aiming to rescue the party from the mess it found itself in as the SDP split and Benn's campaign imprinted an image of extremism in the minds of the voters.\n\nThe anti-Trotskyism of NOLS was central to this period as they were able to successfully outmanoeuvre the far-left groups, having developed their skills in the bitter struggle of the Clause Four Group with Militant in the student movement.\n\nIn 1983, the LCC organised a conference, After the Landslide, to examine the lessons from the party's catastrophic defeat of that year: the tone the conference set, that organisational and political modernisation and change were essential, was to become the dominant theme in the party's internal life in the following decade. Robin Cook became the LCC's principal voice in parliament and Peter Hain was a prominent voice outside Westminster. Cherie Booth was also an active member, serving on the LCC executive.\n\nUnder Neil Kinnock's leadership the LCC became fully engaged in the struggle against Militant and the LCC was broadly supportive of the leadership, though it backed John Prescott's unsuccessful 1988 challenge to deputy leader Roy Hattersley.\n\nThe defeat of Militant left the group without a real cause and membership began to decline, although it sponsored the launch of a new discussion journal, \"Renewal\", in 1993 and firmly repositioned itself as a group of modernisers rather than on the soft left.\n\nIn 1998, with New Labour now in power, the LCC voted to wind itself up.\n\n"}

It was built and originally run by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), the Hollywood studio. The main architect of the cinema was Thomas W. Lamb of New York City, and D. W. Ditchburn (Senior partner of the architectural firm \"Ditchburn Mistry and Bhedwar\") of Mumbai was the associate architect.\nIt was one of the main sites targeted in the \" 2008 Mumbai Attacks \"\n\nMetro is located in the Dhobitalao area of Mumbai. The Art Deco cinema opened on 5 June 1938, and initially exhibited movies made by MGM. The interior, floors, walls, ceilings as well as the furniture, was in shades of red and pink. The marble foyer and staircases led up to murals executed by students of the J. J. School of Art, under the director Charles Gerard. Among the famous invitees was Gregory Peck. And if the films were classy, so was the audience at Metro. The ushers wore suits and the soda fountain provided excellent bar snacks and service. In 1955 Metro was the venue for the first Filmfare Awards night.\n\nIn 1970, the cinema was taken over by the Gupta family and with Indianisation came the era of screening Hindi films and flashy, glittering, star-studded premieres. Raj Kapoor's Bobby set the trend and when RK released \"Satyam Shivam Sundaram\" in typical monsoon fury, the guests were delighted when the young Kapoor brothers — Randhir, Rishi and Rajeev — opened their car doors, held umbrellas over their heads and led them inside.\n\nIt soon became Bollywood's most famous red-carpet theatre. The star presence at Metro became so huge that most often riot police had to be called in at film premieres.\n\nDespite such achievements, Metro could not stand up to the multiplex invasion, it was becoming difficult to fill up the 1,491 seats.

In contrast to characters' standard looks until then, \"Blaze of Glory\" depicted them as grizzled, weather-beaten cowboys and gunfighters, wearing less stylized, more historically appropriate outfits than their classic ones. \"Blaze of Glory\" retconned some of the Marvel Western stories of years past as being dime novel fictions of the characters' actual lives.\n\nSeries' writer John Ostrander declared:\n\"Blaze of Glory\" was originally intended to be released as two forty-eight page issues, as writer John Ostrander revealed in a 1998 interview:\n\nSometime between the date of this interview and the date of publication, the decision to split the two issues into four regular sized issues was made.

A local Indian tribe agrees to ask a warrior they know to help. Reno Jones then sets of with a man named Marcel Fournier to contact others for help.\n\nJones locates the Rawhide Kid who is performing as a part of Buffalo Bill's Wild West show.

After this conversation, the Two-Gun Kid talks to a Mr. Riley, a man who was once the masked outlaw known as the Tarantula. Their conversation reveals Riley to be the man behind the attacks. He wants the land on which Wonderment sits for a smelting plant he plans to build. This conversation also makes it clear that there is no legal avenue to save Wonderment. Later that night in the hills above Wonderment, Red Wolf agrees to give his aid.\n\nTwo days later, Reno Jones recruits the Outlaw Kid.

She was born in Hebron, Connecticut on December 18, 1814 but later settled in Litchfield, Ohio. There she worked as a lecturer for the Western Anti-Slavery Society and Ohio Women's Rights Association. At the end of the American Civil War she moved to Washington, D.C., to help work with the unemployed freedmen. Much of her work was done through the Freedmen's Bureau, where she worked as an assistant to the assistant commissioner and as an agent. Griffing was also active in several women's rights organizations. She died in Washington, D.C. on February 18, 1872.\n\nJosephine White was born in Hebron, Connecticut on December 18, 1814 into a prominent New England family. Her father, Joseph White Jr., was a representative in Connecticut's state legislature, while her mother was the sister of portrait painter Samuel Lovett Waldo. Despite the relative fame of her family, little is known of her childhood in Connecticut. In 1835, at the age of twenty, Josephine married Charles Griffing, and in 1842 they moved to Litchfield, Ohio where they had five daughters. Three of them - Emma, Helen, and Josephine Cora - survived to adulthood.\n\nWhile living in Litchfield, the Griffings became involved with some of the radical organizations that were thriving in Ohio's Western Reserve. By 1849, both Charles and Josephine were active members of the Western Anti-Slavery Society, and by 1851 they were traveling agents, preaching \"no union with slaveholders.\" Griffing also began going on lecture tours on abolitionism throughout the West, becoming one of the most prolific anti-slavery speakers in the region. She also wrote articles for \"The Anti-Slavery Bugle\", a newspaper published out of Salem, Ohio. The Griffings opened up their home as a stop on the Underground Railroad. During the Civil War, Griffing acted as the western agent for the Women's Loyal National League, a feminist organization that worked to outlaw slavery in every state.\n\nDuring the Civil War, Griffing was struck by the plight of the recently freed slaves, especially those who were fleeing to Washington, D.C. Determined to help the freedpeople establish themselves, Griffing and her three daughters moved to Washington, D.C. in 1864, while her husband remained in Ohio. Why her husband remained behind is uncertain. Griffing became an agent for the National Freedmen's Relief Association of the District of Columbia, where she opened up two industrial schools for freedwomen in order to teach them marketable skills such as sewing. These schools were also designed to inculcate freedwomen with the values of the Northern white middle class. In Griffing's words, \"the Industrial School furnishes an opportunity for instruction in social science, and domestic relations, as well as the higher forms of Industry, and a marked change is observable in personal tidiness, good manners, and in the control and government of young children - whom some of the mothers are obliged to bring with them to the Rooms.\" While in Washington, Griffing also used her political influence to lobby Congressmen for more direct aid for the formerly enslaved people of Washington. Through her lobbying of Radical Republican members of Congress, such as Benjamin Wade and Charles Sumner, Griffing became instrumental in establishing the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands, more commonly known as the Freedmen's Bureau. In June 1865, as reward for her work in helping to create the Freedmen's Bureau, Commissioner Oliver Otis Howard appointed Griffing the assistant to the assistant commissioner for Washington, D.C.\n\nDespite Griffing's prominence in the Freedmen's Bureau, she and the male leaders of the organization often conflicted over how best to aid the freedpeople of Washington. Griffing argued that the freedpeople required direct aid, such as food, clothes, and fuel, and that the Bureau's main goals should be to provide material aid for those living in Washington. This aid, according to Griffing, was necessary for the freedpeople to become financially stable, and once that occurred they could obtain jobs and support themselves. However, men involved in freedpeople's aid organizations disagreed with Griffing's claims. They often supported the ideals of free labor; these men encouraged self-reliance and the signing of labor contracts so that freedpeople could survive financially without assistance as quickly as possible. Griffing openly spoke out about the lack of direct aid, claiming that 20,000 freedpeople in Washington, D.C. were suffering for lack of rations and supplies and that the Bureau men would not help them. The agents of the Bureau denied her statement, despite the evidence supporting her argument. By November 1865, Commissioner Howard revoked Griffing's appointment due to these conflicts, stating that \"this Bureau has not received any funds from Mrs. Griffing and does not assume responsibility of the collections she is making.\"\n\nEven with this setback, Griffing continued to help better the lives of the freedpeople. She worked with her government contacts to help freedpeople find jobs in the north, and sometimes travelled with them to make sure they arrived safely. The Freedmen's Bureau worked with Griffing on this project, providing barracks in Rhode Island, offices in New York City, and fund for rent and other necessary expenses. By 1867, Griffing was working for the Freedmen's Bureau once more, this time as an agent for the Capitol Hill and Navy Yard districts. Throughout her tenure, Griffing fought for increased aid for the freedpeople, as well as continuing her efforts at finding employment for African Americans in the north. She also kept contact with her associates in the federal government and in private aid organizations in order to obtain as much aid as possible for the destitute of Washington, D.C. Griffing worked as an agent for the Freedmen's Bureau until it ran out of funding and was forced to stop providing aid in late 1869. She continued working to aid freedpeople through the National Freedmen's Aid Association of the District of Columbia until her death in 1872.\n\nIn addition to her work for the freedpeople of Washington, D.C., Griffing was also a women's rights activist. In the 1850s, Griffing became involved with women's rights organizations, making contact with women like Susan B. Anthony who would inspire her to fight for the rights of women as well as African Americans. Throughout the 1850s, Griffing joined various feminist organizations, such as the Ohio Women's Rights Association, which she became the president of in 1853. Shortly after President Abraham Lincoln gave the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, Griffing joined the Women's Loyal National League as a lecturing agent, where she helped collect thousands of signatures for a women's antislavery petition that was eventually presented to the United States Congress by Charles Sumner. Griffing was also active in the temperance movement that was popular amongst many feminist activists during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.\n\nWhile in Washington, D.C., Griffing maintained her dedication to women's rights and the cause of suffrage. In 1866 she helped found the American Equal Rights Association, whose purpose was to promote equality and suffrage for all people no matter their race or sex; she also served as its first vice-president. Griffing became the president of District of Columbia woman suffrage association in 1867, where she helped monitor guide suffrage activities in Washington, D.C. In 1869, along with Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and other prominent reformers, Griffing joined the National Woman Suffrage Association and acted as its corresponding secretary.\n\nJosephine Griffing died in 1872, with her cause of death listed as \"consumption.\" She was 57 at the time, and was survived by her husband and her three daughters.\n\n"}
