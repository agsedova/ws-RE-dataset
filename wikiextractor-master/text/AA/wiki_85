St-Laurent\" is a Canadian Coast Guard Heavy Arctic Icebreaker. \"Louis S. St-Laurent\"s home port is St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador and is stationed there with other vessels of the coast guard.\n\nNamed after the twelfth Prime Minister of Canada, The Right Honourable Louis St. Laurent, PC CC QC LLD DCL LLL BA. The vessel is classed a \"Heavy Arctic Icebreaker\" and is the largest icebreaker and flagship of the CCG.\n\n\"Louis S. St-Laurent\" is based at CCG Base St. John's in St. John's, Newfoundland. The vessel's current operation tempo consists of summer voyages to Canada's Arctic where she supports the annual Arctic sealift to various coastal communities and carries out multi-disciplinary scientific expeditions. During the winter months, \"Louis S. St-Laurent\" sometimes operates in the Gulf of St. Lawrence to aid ships in transiting to Montreal, Quebec, although she usually only serves this assignment during particularly heavy ice years.\n\n\"Louis S. St. Laurent\" was launched 3 December 1966 by Canadian Vickers Limited at Montreal, Quebec and commissioned in October 1969.\n\nFrom 8–22 September 1969 \"Louis S. St-Laurent\" sailed on the expedition in the Northwest Passage. She was assisted by and the United States Coast Guard vessels and .\n\nDuring 1976 \"Louis S. St-Laurent\", Captain Paul M. Fournier in command, made a partial transit of the Northwest Passage traveling from east to west, through Lancaster Sound, Peel Sound, and Victoria Strait.\n\nIn 1979 \"Louis S. St-Laurent\", Captain George Burdock in command, made a full east to west transit of the Northwest Passage. She assisted CCGS \"Franklin\", and circumnavigated North America.\n\n\"Louis S. St-Laurent\" underwent an extensive and costly modernization at Halifax Shipyard Ltd. in Halifax, Nova Scotia between 1988–1993 which saw her hull lengthened as well as new propulsion and navigation equipment installed.\n\nThe modernization program was controversial as the government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney had initially proposed building a class of mega icebreakers (the Polar 8 Project) for promoting Canadian sovereignty in territorial waters claimed by Canada; had made an unauthorized transit of Canada's Northwest Passage in 1985 early in Mulroney's administration, provoking a strong nationalist out-cry across the country. However, budget cuts in the late 1980s saw proposed expansions of the coast guard and armed forces scrapped. In compensation to the coast guard, the government opted to modernize the largest icebreaker in its fleet, \"Louis S. St-Laurent\".\n\nOn 22 August 1994 \"Louis S. St-Laurent\" and USCGC \"Polar Sea\" became the first North American surface vessels to reach the North Pole.\n\nIn the summer of 2006, CBC TV's \"\" broadcast from \"Louis S. St-Laurent\" in a special series focused on climate change.\n\nThe vessel was originally scheduled to be decommissioned in 2000 however a refit extended the decommissioning date to 2017. In the 26 February 2008 federal budget, the Government of Canada announced it was funding a $721 million \"Polar Class Icebreaker\" (named ) as a replacement vessel for \"Louis S. St-Laurent\". However, this mooted replacement vessel has been continually delayed compelling the life of \"Louis St. Laurent\" to be significantly extended. \n\nIn 2014, with , \"Louis S. St-Laurent\" performed a cruise to the Arctic to map the undersea continental shelf. The two vessels were slowed by thick ice conditions.\n\nAt 1:30 a.m. on 2 April 2015, \"Louis S. St-Laurent\", arrived near Burgeo, Newfoundland and Labrador to take the damaged Canadian Coast Guard vessel under tow. \"Ann Harvey\", which had run aground near Burgeo, was already being towed by the lifeboat CCGS \"W.G. George\" when the icebreaker arrived. \"Louis S. St-Laurent\" took over the tow and brought \"Ann Harvey\" into Connoire Bay where Royal Canadian Navy divers could inspect the ship.\n\nIn 2016 \"Louis S. St-Laurent\" was deployed to the Arctic carrying an international team of scientists mapping the sea floor. The first leg of the mission was a voyage to Norway mapping the Atlantic. This was to be followed by a 47-day leg to the North Pole. Travelling with the Swedish icebreaker \"Oden\", \"Louis S. St-Laurent\"s mission to the Arctic was the last of three performed in order to define Canada's claim to the Arctic continental shelf. While mapping during transit to the north, the scientists aboard the ship discovered a chain of 25–30 undersea volcanoes off the coast of Greenland.\n\nOn 22 March 2019, and \"Louis S. St-Laurent\" were dispatched to aid the tanker which had damaged a rudder in heavy ice and lost steering southwest of Port-aux-Basques, Newfoundland. \"Captain Molly Kool\" towed the vessel further out to sea to await the arrival of a tugboat, which would take the tanker to Sydney, Nova Scotia for repairs.\n"}

{"id": "1894183", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1894183", "title": "Christian country music", "text": "Christian country music\n\nChristian country music (sometimes marketed as country gospel, gospel country, positive country or inspirational country) is music that is written to express either personal or a communal belief regarding Christian life, as well as (in terms of the varying music styles) to give a Christian alternative to mainstream secular music. Christian country music is a form of Christian music and a subgenre of both Gospel music and Country music.\n\nLike other forms of music the creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of Christian country music varies according to culture and social context. It is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes with a positive message, or as an entertainment product for the marketplace. However, a common theme as with most Christian music is praise, worship or thanks to God and/or Christ.\n\nMany Christian country organizations have been around for a great number of years. The oldest of all of these organizations is the International Country Gospel Music Association which was founded in 1957. These organizations were founded to further artists careers much in the same manner as the GMA, NARAS or CMA. Many of these organizations have yearly conventions which hosts music showcases and awards shows. The CCMA was sued by the CMA for award name right infringement. The CCMA renamed their awards show after a federal judge ruled that they could no longer use the name. The new name is the ICM Music Awards' which stands for \"Inspirational Country Music\".\n\nRadio personality Bob Wilson was one of the first radio personalities to see the potential of the genre. His weekly show \"Gospel Country Round-up\" aired for many years playing southern and Christian country music. Many Christian country stations today are going the way of Internet stations. That is a positive move for this genre, however, because there are few terrestrial radio stations that play a strictly Christian country format. Many mainstream country stations only have a weekly Sunday Country Gospel show.\n\nChristian country has several syndicated programs. The \"Country Gospel Countdown\" has broadcast since 1984 and syndicated since 1988, \"The Country Parson\" radio program, broadcast since 1995 and has been syndicated since 1998. \"Today's Cross Country\" with Marty Smith, broadcast since 1995, syndicated since 1996. \"Ken's Country Radio Show\", The \"Radio Hour\", \"Country Messenger\", \"The Ranch\" radio show on KKUS, and Canadian produced \"Riverside Country\". The Country Gospel Music Guild also airs a weekly radio program while \"Circuit Rider Radio\" airs on conventional and satellite radio worldwide.\n\nOther syndicated weekend shows that feature Inspirational and Positive Country music are \"Power Source Top 20\", and finally, the \"American Christian Music Review\" for United Stations Radio Networks. These programs are aired nationwide weekly on both Country and Southern Gospel radio stations.\n\nAM/FM and Internet stations that play Christian Country Music, 90.5 KJIC Christian Country Radio, CBN Cross Country, HLE Radio, Heaven's Country, 89.9 Today's Christian Country.\n\nMany secular country music artists have recorded country gospel songs or have performed them on their radio and television programs. From 1956-1960, two network shows usually concluded with a gospel number, which was popular with viewers: \"The Tennessee Ernie Ford Show\" and Red Foley's \"Ozark Jubilee\".\n\nOther shows like \"Hee Haw\", the Barbara Mandrell and the Mandrell Sisters Show, and the Statler Brothers implemented the same programming style. For instance, \"Hee Haw\" featured a gospel song at the end of each of its shows; series stars Roy Clark, Buck Owens, Grandpa Jones and Kenny Price would sing either a traditional hymn or a newer one well known by mainstream country and Christian country audiences, and the segment itself served as a balance to the show's loony, corn-style humor.\n\n\"The Grand Ole Opry\", the longest running radio show and one of the most popular country music shows, has always included gospel music as a part of its program.\n\nIn the past, most Christian country music was recorded by groups with southern gospel flair like the Oak Ridge Boys, Mercy River Boys, The Cook Family Singers, Red Sovine, The Louvin Brothers and The Carter Family. Eventually, more mainstream country artists—ranging from Loretta Lynn and Dolly Parton to Alabama and Alan Jackson—recorded gospel albums while continuing to record secular music. Johnny Cash, a devout Christian despite living a troubled life, recorded several best-selling gospel albums and always included a Christian song in his concerts. Ray Stevens, a musician known primarily for his comedy and novelty recordings, also recorded an album of Christian music and mixed Christian themes in his serious (\"Everything is Beautiful,\" stressing unity) and novelty (for instance, \"Mississippi Squirrel Revival,\" which had a theme of repentance) mainstream releases. \n\nAlthough The Oak Ridge Boys began releasing secular country songs in the late 1970s, they always maintained their gospel roots by recording religious material and performing gospel songs in their concerts, as well as releasing songs stressing Christian values and family unity. The Mercy River Boys released their debut album, Breakout (Canaan Records) in 1979, firmly establishing the new Christian Country genre. Don Cusic (Billboard Magazine, Vol. 90, No 31), credits Canaan Records for creating a band to crossover into country music, improving “what is essentially a good product (gospel) and made it become commercially viable.” The Mercy River Boys charted hits in Country, Southern Gospel and on traditional Gospel formats. Other gospel groups followed the Oak Ridge Boys and the Mercy River Boys into Christian Country music.\n\nAt times, gospel and Christian-themed songs earned mass mainstream appeal. Among the most popular of these songs included \"Why Me\" by Kris Kristofferson (1973, a plea for God's guidance and forgiveness), \"The Seeker\" by Dolly Parton (1975, a spiritual), \"One Day at a Time\" by Cristy Lane (1980, co-written by Kristofferson), \"Three Wooden Crosses\" by Randy Travis (2003, where a prostitute gives birth to a man who eventually becomes a preacher), \"Long Black Train\" by Josh Turner (2003, about resisting temptation from Satan and following the Lord instead); \"Jesus Take the Wheel\" by Carrie Underwood (2005, where a woman turns to Christ) and \"When I Get Where I'm Going\" by Brad Paisley (2006, about the afterlife).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1894221", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1894221", "title": "Brian Larsen", "text": "Brian Larsen\n\nBrian Larsen (born April 9, 1986, in Laurel, Maryland) is a multi-instrumentalist, singer, record producer, entrepreneur and business executive. Larsen has released ten albums, eight under the name \"Twilight's Moon\" and two under his own name, 2009's \"Breaking \"and 2012's \"Building\". In late 2012, it was announced that Larsen's eleventh album would be titled \"Being\" and is to be released in 2020.\n\nBorn in Laurel, Maryland, a small suburb of Washington, D.C., Larsen was the fourth and youngest son in his family. Larsen's first forays into songwriting took place while he was still in elementary school. Inspired by his older uncle, Bryon Moore, who achieved success in music through his popular South Carolina band Uncle Mingo.\n\nIn 1996, Larsen officially formed Twilight's Moon with schoolmates Trevor Hunter, Alex Masonis, and Andrew Jones, though Masonis and Jones left the band less than a year later over creative control disputes. Hunter and Larsen continued recording, with Hunter assuming Jones' role as drummer and Larsen assuming Masonis' role as keyboardist. Hunter vacated his role as performer, agreeing instead to concentrate on acting as Larsen's manager, and in response, Larsen agreed to assume all musical roles within the band.\n\nThe album, \"Pi\", was released in September 1998 and sold several hundred copies. Larsen immediately began recording \"The Classics\", a disc composed solely of original and interpreted classical songs. The album was released in February 1999 to positive reviews but poor sales. The next year, Larsen began writing and recording demos for what would eventually become \"The Slope\", his first internationally distributed album. The album was released on August 3, 2000 to mixed reviews, but became a modest hit thanks to the instrumental track \"Zoo II\".\n\nLarsen returned to the studio to record a follow-up album with the specific intention of recording tracks that were more radio-friendly. The resulting album, \"ClockWork\", was released on January 23, 2001, and featured a guest performance from Larsen's uncle, Bryon Moore. Overall, the album received a positive commercial and critical response. Inspired by this success, Larsen performed live in support of the album but quickly returned to the studio to record a follow-up album using digital recording equipment. That album, \"Emergency Exit\", was received even more enthusiastically by critics and fans alike, being called \"the beginning of Larsen hitting his musical stride\" and \"the best Twilight's Moon album to [that] point\" by noted critic Steven Thomas Erlewine.\n\nAfter the release of \"Emergency Exit\", Larsen took an extensive vacation from the music industry while attending high school. He released \"Close to Me\", a five-track EP, on his 16th birthday, but stated on his website that he intended to begin work on an album of trance music. That album, \"Electric\", took nearly two years to complete, but was met with great commercial success upon its release in 2003, supported by the album's self-titled single as well as the track \"Casino\", both of which received rotation in American and Asian dance clubs.\n\nDemand for a new album led to Larsen recording his first original tracks of rock music in two years. \"Broken Windows\", a mixture of original tracks and cover songs, was released on December 23, 2003, to mixed reviews. Some critics criticized Larsen for his use of cover tracks on the album. B-sides from the \"Broken Windows\" sessions were collected and released as \"Mind Candy\" in early 2004. Similar to the quick follow-up of \"Emergency Exit\" to \"ClockWork\" (spaced ten months apart), Larsen indicated that his desire was to release a follow-up album to \"Broken Windows\", tentatively titled \"The Last of the Romantics\", sometime in late 2004. Writer's block and Larsen's involvement in other projects stalled the album, however, and its release date was pushed back several times. In June 2005, the album was listed on Amazon.com as being available for pre-order, selling enough copies to enter Amazon.com's best-sellers list before the release date was changed once more. Several singles have been officially released from the album, however, including \"In the Fall\", \"In the Summer\", \"Goodnight\", \"I Tried\", and \"In the Meantime\", all of which have received significant downloads on Larsen's official website and MySpace. A six-song EP, \"In the Meantime\", was released in August 2007.\n\nOn October 10, 2007, Larsen announced on his official website that he intended to disband Twilight's Moon and stated that he was in the process of writing and recording music under his own name. The resulting album, \"Breaking\", was released on August 4, 2009 to mostly positive reviews. In the summer of 2009, Larsen assembled a permanent touring band composed of guitarist Anne Muntuerto (of the Philippines-based band Cattski), bassist Devon Eason, and session drummer Lydia Lewis. Brian and his band toured the United States through the end of 2009, and Larsen (sometimes accompanied by Muntuerto) toured the country again, performing acoustic version of his songs during the first half of 2010, including a Los Angeles charity concert on the evening before the 52nd Grammy Awards to benefit victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake.\n\nIn 2010 Larsen announced via his Twitter account that he was in the process of writing and recording his 10th album. In November 2010, a YouTube video was released announcing that the album would be titled \"Building\". It was released on April 17, 2012 and was Larsen's first album to earn a Parental Advisory warning for explicit lyrics. In late 2012, Larsen announced via a YouTube video that he was in the process of recording another album of new material, to be released in early 2014. It was later announced that the album would be titled \"Being.\"\n\nIn 2014, Larsen created the company RestoraPet with Kenny Kramm, the founder and former CEO of FLAVORx. The company develops and manufactures over the counter supplements for dogs, cats, and horses. The products were invented and researched by Larsen, who has a background in chemistry and pharmacology. He is a current Executive MBA student at the University of Virginia Darden School of Business.\n\n"}
{"id": "1894226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1894226", "title": "John Jackson (English boxer)", "text": "John Jackson (English boxer)\n\nJohn Jackson (28 September 1769 – 7 October 1845) was a celebrated English pugilist of the late 18th century. He became the 17th bare-knuckle boxing champion of all England on 15 April 1795, when he defeated Daniel Mendoza.\n\nJohn Jackson was born 28 September 1769 to a middle class Worcestershire family of builders who disapproved of his choice of boxing as a profession.\n\nIn his boxing prime, Jackson stood 5'11\" or 1.80 meters and weighed 195 pounds or 14 stone. His symmetry in frame and muscular development made him a prized model for sculptors and painters. However, he was said to have a sloping forehead and ears that stuck straight out from the sides of his head.\n\nHe was considered an exceptional amateur boxer prior to 1788. On 9 June 1788, around age nineteen, Jackson defeated William Futrell at Smithham Bottom, England, in a bout lasting one hour, seven minutes. Futrell was a giant of a man, undefeated, and held a string of 18 victories, when he faced the younger Jackson.\n\nIn his second bout on 12 March 1789, against John Ingleston, on a rainy day at Ingatestone, England, he lost in five rounds, in a bout lasting twenty minutes and suffered a broken leg, not entirely uncommon during the brutal English bouts of the late 18th century. His injury was likely caused by a slip from the muddy ground. Many present believed Jackson would have won the bout if not for his unfortunate accident. Likely distressed by his injury, he announced his retirement after his loss, but would return six years later in his most important win.\n\nJackson won the championship of all England at age twenty-six in a fight on 15 April 1795, defeating the 16th all England champion Daniel Mendoza, the first English Jew to hold the title. The historic bout took place on a stage at Hornchurch in Essex. Heavyweight Jackson was five years younger, taller, and heavier than the middleweight Mendoza. The bout was only Jackson's third professional fight, but Mendoza's age, recent months in prison, and years of punishment in the ring gave the advantage to Jackson, the fresher and less battered combatant. Due to his lack of experience, Jackson was a 10-1 underdog in the betting.\n\nThe challenger won in nine rounds, paving the way to victory by muscling Mendoza into the corner of the ring, grabbing his hair, and pummeling his head with uppercuts using his free hand. Mendoza managed to come back up to scratch after this, but was soon knocked out. Jackson beat him into submission by the end of the 9th round. Mendoza asked for a foul for Jackson's hair-pulling, but it was ruled to be legal. Many other pugilists, such as James Figg and Jack Broughton, shaved their heads to avoid the possibility of this, until hair-pulling was eventually banned in boxing. Mendoza's managers asked for a rematch, but Jackson refused and retired after his win the following year.\n\nIn 1796, Jackson announced his retirement from the ring, officially vacating the boxing championship of England. His successor was shorter, lighter, Thomas Owen, who won the title on 14 November 1796 against William Hooper in a 40-round match in Harrow, England.\n\nWith the recognition his new title brought, Jackson created a boxing academy for gentlemen at 13 Bond Street, in the West End of London, where he also resided, around 1803. Jackson is credited with a scientific style of boxing, which he taught at his academy three times a week during the London Season. His style was partly patterned after the revolutionary scientific boxing style of Daniel Mendoza, which was described in Mendoza's book, \"The Art of Boxing\", published in 1789. It required adopting a posture of a slightly bent body, with head and shoulders forward, and knees slightly bent and at ease. Demonstrated above by Mendoza, the fists were held well up for defense in a position called the \"guard\". The left straight jab was used to keep an opponent at a distance and protect from an attack. Jackson created rules in the fights he managed which included using fists alone, rather than scrapping with the entire body, and made hair holding and kicking illegal. Up to fifty rounds could be fought, however, and gloves, though available, were not used regularly until 1867. Most brutally, rounds were un-timed and ended only when one combatant was down.\n\nJackson's academy was popular with the nobility and gentry and became a profitable business. His friend, the famed English poet George Gordon Byron, known as Lord Byron, an avid boxing fan, related in his diary that he regularly received instruction in boxing from Jackson. Jackson also profited from providing exhibitions for English and foreign lords and celebrities. Included among those for whom he arranged exhibitions were the Emperor of Russia, the King of Prussia, the Prince of Wales, and the Prince of Mecklenburg. Jackson's introduction of the sport to English and European royalty, made boxing a more admired and to some extent accepted sport in England. Jackson was charitable and held benefits for numerous charities, once raising £114 for a Portuguese town destroyed by the French, and later £132 for the benefit of British prisoners in France.\n\nIn 1814, he helped to establish an organization similar to the modern Boxing Commission. First formed at the Thatched House Tavern, the \"Pugilistic Club\", collected subscriptions from wealthy patrons and sponsored fights several times a year. For each fight, a Banker was appointed to hold the purse as well as many side bets that might be made. Jackson was often nominated to be Banker. As a result of his work with the \"Pugilistic Club\" arranging fights, he is credited with helping to keep the sport honest in a time when bouts were often fixed.\nJackson lived in comfort after his boxing career and worked as the proprietor of the Cock Hotel, a coaching inn in Sutton on the London to Brighton turnpike road. The inn served the needs of travellers, for food, drink, and rest, and was also a resting stop for those travelling by coach. The London to Brighton stagecoach began in 1760, and the Cock Hotel was the 9am stop for coaches leaving the city.\nIn 1821, Jackson was asked to supply a force of unarmed men to preserve order at King George IV's Coronation, where he also served as a page. With his boxing connections, he selected 18 prizefighters to protect the King, and to keep back those unauthorized to attend.\n\nWhen Jackson died, on 7 October 1845, at his home at 4 Lower Grosvenor St. West, in the Mayfair section of London, he was said to be holding the hand of his beloved niece and adopted daughter, Elizabeth. His remains were interred in Brompton Cemetery, London. He was honored with a monument with a carved lion on his tomb costing upwards of £400 which was provided by his many friends and admirers.\n\nIn recognition of his boxing skills, he was inducted into the Ring Boxing Hall of Fame in 1954 and the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1992.\n\nByron referred to Jackson as the \"Emperor of Pugilism\", and the leading prizefight reporter, Pierce Egan, writing in \"Boxiana\" declared him to be the \"fixed star\" of the \"Pugilistic Hemisphere\".\n\nIn the artist Thomas Lawrence's 1797 exhibition at the Royal Academy, an enormous painting of \"Satan Summoning his Legions\", shown to the right, was based upon a giant portrait of the muscular Jackson.\n\nJackson features as a character in \"Rodney Stone\", a Gothic mystery and boxing novel by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.\n\nHe and/or his boxing academy are frequently mentioned in Georgette Heyer's Regency romances.\n\nThe characters of boxing opponents Jackson and Daniel Mendoza have minor but important roles in the 1942 British film \"The Young Mr. Pitt\".\n"}
{"id": "1894246", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1894246", "title": "Clock network", "text": "Clock network\n\nA clock network or clock system is a set of synchronized clocks designed to always show exactly the same time by communicating with each other. Clock networks usually consist of a central master clock kept in sync with an official time source, and one or more slave clocks which receive and display the time from the master.\n\nThe master clock in a clock network can receive accurate time in a number of ways: through the United States GPS satellite constellation, a Network Time Protocol server, the CDMA cellular phone network, a modem connection to a time source, or by listening to radio transmissions from WWV or WWVH, or a special signal from an upstream broadcast network. Some master clocks don't determine the time automatically. Instead, they rely on an operator to manually set them.\n\nClock networks in critical applications often include a backup source to receive the time, or provisions to allow the master clock to maintain the time even if it loses access to its primary time source. For example, many master clocks can use the reliable frequency of the alternating current line they are connected to.\n\nSlave clocks come in many shapes and sizes. They can connect to the master clock through either a cable or a short-range wireless signal. In the 19th century Paris used a series of pneumatic tubes to transmit the signal. Some slave clocks will run independently if they lose the master signal, often with a warning light lit. Others will freeze until the connection is restored.\n\nMany master clocks include the capability to synchronize devices like computers to the master clock signal. Common features include the transmission of the time via RS-232, a Network Time Protocol, or a Pulse Per Second (PPS) contact. Others provide SMPTE time code outputs, which are often used in television settings to synchronize the video from multiple sources. Master Clocks often come equipped with programmable relay outputs to synchronize other devices such as lights, doors, etc.\n\nOne of the driving factors in developing clock networks was the broadcast industry. Television, in particular, operates on a very strict schedule, where each second of airtime is planned ahead of time and must be executed precisely. A central clock system allows a television station's master control and production personnel to work within that schedule. A clock network synchronized to the standard UTC time also allows different television facilities to coordinate their activities without complicated out-of-band signaling. It also provides accurate timing to equipment in stations that are becoming increasingly automated.\n\nWhile television broadcasters were some of the first users of clock networks, the equipment is becoming increasingly useful in other industries. For example, the National Emergency Number Association issued directive NENA-04-002, offering standards in timekeeping for 911 dispatch centers throughout the United States. Other common clock network users include airports and schools.\n\nOne of the first clock networks was installed by Charles Shepherd for the Great Exhibition, held in London in 1851. Shepherd's technology was then installed at the Royal Greenwich Observatory, and a replica of his Shepherd Gate Clock outside the gate is still working, the original being severely damaged in a WWII air raid.\n\nIn the period before the universal availability of A.C. mains or atomic clocks, many clock networks were installed using a highly accurate pendulum clock as a master clock. This clock resembled a longcase clock, but had a very robust mechanism and a less ornate case. Electrical contacts attached to the mechanism generated minute, half minute and sometimes one second electrical pulses which were fed to the slave clocks on pairs of wires. The devices driven could be wall clocks, employee time clocks, tower clocks and occasionally clock chiming mechanisms. Some master clocks were set up to control the frequency of a generating authority's mains output; others, in the UK, were arranged to synchronise themselves with the Greenwich Time Signal pips.\n\nThere is a hierarchy of clocks in a network, reflecting their quality.\nFor example:\n\n\n"}

It was announced in early May 2005 and on October 25, 2006, the Board of Directors voted to make Apache Harmony a top-level project. The Harmony project achieved (as of February 2011) 99% completeness for J2SE 5.0, and 97% for Java SE 6. The Android operating system has historically been a major user of Harmony, although since Android Nougat it increasingly relies on OpenJDK libraries.\n\nOn October 29, 2011 a vote was started by the project lead Tim Ellison whether to retire the project. The outcome was 20 to 2 in favor, and the project was retired on November 16, 2011.\n\nThe Harmony project was initially conceived as an effort to unite all developers of the free Java implementations. Many developers expected that it would be the project above the GNU, Apache and other communities. GNU developers were invited into and participated during the initial, preparatory planning.\n\nDespite the impression given by the preparatory planning, it was decided not to use the code from GNU Classpath, and that Harmony would use an incompatible license; therefore blocking the collaboration between Harmony and existing free Java projects. Apache developers would then write the needed classes from scratch and expect necessary large code donations from software companies. Various misunderstandings at the start of the project, and the fact that major companies like IBM proposed to give large amount of existing code, created some confusion in the free Java community about the real objectives of the project.\n\nOne major point of incompatibility between the GNU Classpath and Apache Harmony projects was their incompatible licenses: Classpath's GNU General Public License with the linking exception versus Harmony's Apache License.\n\nOn April 10, 2007, the Apache Software Foundation sent an open letter to Sun Microsystems CEO, Jonathan Schwartz regarding their inability to acquire an acceptable license for the Java SE 5 Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK), a test kit needed by the project to demonstrate compatibility with the Java SE 5 specification, as needed by the Sun specification license for Java SE 5. What makes the license unacceptable for ASF is the fact that it imposes rights restrictions through limits on the \"field of use\" available to users of Harmony, not compliant with the Java Community Process rules.\n\nSun answered on a company blog that it intended to create an open source implementation of the Java platform under GPL, including the TCK, but that their current priority was to make the Java Platform accessible to the GNU/Linux community under GPL as quickly as possible.\n\nThis answer triggered some reactions, either criticizing Sun for not responding \"in a sufficiently open manner\" to an open letter, or rather Apache Software Foundation; some think that ASF acted unwisely to aggressively demand something they could have obtained with more diplomacy from Sun, especially considering the timescale of the opening class library.\n\nSun released the OpenJDK in May 2007, along with a specific license to allow to run the TCK in the OpenJDK context for any GPL implementation deriving substantially from OpenJDK. This does not cover Apache Harmony, which is not GPL-licensed. On December 9, 2010, the Apache Software Foundation resigned from the Java Community Process Executive Committee, in protest over the difficulty in obtaining a license acceptable to Apache for use with the Harmony project.\n\nThe virtual machine that is used in Google's Android platform (Dalvik up to version 4.4, and its successor, Android Runtime (ART)) uses a subset of Harmony for the core of its Class Library. However, Dalvik does not align to Java SE nor Java ME Class Library profiles (for example J2ME classes, AWT and Swing are not supported).\n\nAndroid 7.0 \"Nougat\" replaced Harmony with OpenJDK.\n\nOn October 11, 2010, IBM, by far the biggest participant in the project, decided to join Oracle on the OpenJDK project, effectively shifting its efforts from Harmony to the Oracle reference implementation. Bob Sutor, IBM's head of Linux and open source, blogged that \"IBM will be shifting its development effort from the Apache Project Harmony to OpenJDK\". On March 2011, IBM's Tim Ellison announced that he resigned as Project Management Chair for Harmony After IBM's disengagement, the project's activity level greatly declined.\n\nOn October 29, 2011, a poll was started on the harmony-dev mailing list by the project lead Tim Ellison whether to retire the project. The outcome on November 3, was 20 to 2 in favor of retirement. On November 16, 2011, the Apache Software Foundation board of directors passed a motion to terminate the project. One director, Larry Rosen, cast a \"no\" vote, based on the timing rather than the merits of the proposal; it was otherwise unanimous. The project was retired on November 16, 2011.\n\nAt the start, Apache Harmony received some large code contributions from several companies. Development discussions have taken place on open mailing lists. Later, the Apache Software foundation mentors put a lot of effort\ninto bringing the development process more in line with \"the Apache way,\" and it seemed that their efforts were successful.\n\nApache Harmony was accepted among the official Apache projects on October 29, 2006.\n\nThe Dynamic Runtime Layer virtual machine consists of the following components:\n\n\nThe project provided a portable implementation that ease development on many platforms and operating systems. The main focus was on Windows and Linux operating systems on x86 and x86-64 architectures.\nThe expected donations from software companies were actually received. The Apache Harmony now contains the working code, including the Swing, AWT and Java 2D code which were contributed by Intel.\n\nThe Harmony project currently achieve (as of February 2011) 99% completeness for JDK 5.0, and 97% for Java SE 6.\n\nThe progress of the Apache Harmony project can be tracked against J2SE 1.4 and Java SE 5.0. Also, there is a branch for Harmony v6.0 in development for Java SE 6.0.\n\nApache Harmony developers integrate several existing, field-tested open-source projects to meet their goal (not reinventing the wheel). Many of these projects are mature and well known and other parts of the library needed to be written from scratch.\n\nThis is a list of existing open source components that are used in the Apache Harmony project; some of them were in use before the project started.\n\nHarmony is currently less documented than the alternative free Java implementations. For instance, in GNU Classpath every method of the central CORBA class (ORB) has the explaining comment both in the standard abstract API class and implementation. In the Yoko project, used by Harmony, most methods both in the standard declaration and implementing class were undocumented at the end of October 2006. Also, GNU Classpath supported both older and current CORBA features (same as Sun's implementation). Harmony, differently, left the central method of the older standard (codice_1) fully unimplemented.\n\nA complete implementation of the Java platform also needs a compiler that translates Java source code into bytecodes, a program that manages JAR files, a debugger, and an applet viewer and web browser plugin, to name a few. Harmony currently has the compiler, appletviewer, jarsigner, javah, javap, keytool, policytool, and unpack200.\n\nHarmony currently has seven virtual machine implementations that run Harmony Class Library, all of which were donations by external groups:\n\nIn the end of November 2006, the language support provided by these virtual machine was still incomplete, and the build instructions recommended to use IBM's proprietary J9 instead to run the class library test suite. However, this is not necessary anymore (as of July 2007).\n\nAs for the rest of the project, DRLVM virtual machine development has now stalled (as of May 2011).\n\nSince its conception, Harmony grew in its ability to execute non-trivial Java applications. , supported applications include:\n\n\nHowever, Harmony's incomplete library prevented it from launching some other applications:\n\n\n\n"}

Indeed, until 2005, the Labor Party had never come close to winning a Palmerston-based seat in the history of the Assembly. However, Brennan is located in what had long been reckoned as a particularly conservative area even by Palmerston standards, and it was the CLP's safest seat after the 2001 election. Denis Burke, who served as Chief Minister of the Northern Territory from 1999 to 2001 and had just been reelected as Opposition Leader a few months before the election, was not expected to have any difficulty holding the seat in the foreseeable future. However, in a shock result that had not been predicted by any prominent commentator, much less either candidate, Brennan fell to the ALP candidate, James Burke, at the 2005 election—only the second time that a major-party leader in the Northern Territory had been toppled in his own electorate.\n\nBurke's victory was short-lived, as Peter Chandler regained the seat for the CLP at the 2008 election. Chandler picked up a massive swing in 2012, seemingly reverting Brennan to its traditional status as a safe CLP seat.

Moving with his family to Continental Portugal, he settled in Colares, near Sintra, where he soon showed his unusual skills in music, and in playing and composing works for the piano.\n\nIn Berlin he had lessons from Xaver Scharwenka and Philipp Scharwenka before studying with Franz Liszt at Weimar in 1885 and with Hans von Bülow two years later. In the following years he undertook many concert tours all round the world. Although he was renowned for his virtuosity he was also dedicated to the music of J. S. Bach and Beethoven - playing all of the latter's 32 piano sonatas in a series of concerts in Lisbon in 1927. He also included lesser known composers in his recitals, playing, for example, works by Charles-Valentin Alkan at the Wigmore Hall in London in 1903. He also made a number of transcriptions of Alkan's pedalier pieces into two hand versions.\n\nVianna da Motta was also close to his fellow virtuoso Ferruccio Busoni, and wrote the programme notes for Busoni's major series of piano concerto concerts in Berlin.\n\nVianna da Motta was also a composer in his own right, including orchestral works (one of them a symphony) as well as piano pieces. On 25 October 1906, Motta recorded ten piano rolls for Welte-Mignon including three of his own compositions. He was Director of the Lisbon Conservatory from 1919 to 1938.

His first teacher was his father. He made his debut at the Academy of Music in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at age 4. At age 7, Schelling traveled to Europe to study. He was admitted to the Paris Conservatoire. While in Europe he worked with many great masters including Percy Goetschius, Hans Huber, Richard Barth, Moritz Moszkowski and Theodor Leschetizky.\n\nAt the age of 20 in 1896, he began studying with Ignace Paderewski and was his only pupil for three years.

The first concert was held March 27, 1924. The concerts were designed to encourage the love of music in children. They combined the orchestra's performance with a lecture about one aspect or another of the orchestra or the music itself with a picture or demonstration, so that children were exposed to a variety of stimuli. The concerts were highly appreciated by children, as well as their parents. Schelling held these concerts in New York, and also took them on the road.

Admitted a solicitor in 1828, he practised briefly in London, becoming a disciple of Edward Gibbon Wakefield in connection with his colonization schemes. Hanson joined \"The Globe\" as a political critic early in 1837. In 1838 he went with Lord Durham to Canada as assistant commissioner of inquiry into crown lands and immigration. Hanson worked with Dominick Daly in Canada.\n\nIn 1840, on the death of Lord Durham, Hanson settled in Wellington, New Zealand. He there acted as crown prosecutor, but in 1846 moved to South Australia. On his arrival in the colony of South Australia in 1846, Hanson immediately set up a legal practice. He served as Advocate-General and Attorney-General for the colony before election to the seat of City of Adelaide in 1857.\n\nIn 1851 Hanson was appointed advocate-general of the colony, initially as a temporary replacement for the ailing William Smillie, made permanent when Smillie died. He took an active share in the passing of many important measures, such as the first Education Act, the District Councils Act of 1852, and the Act of 1856 which granted constitutional government to the colony. In 1856 he was attorney-general in the first ministry under Boyle Travers Finniss; becoming premier himself in 1857. Among the acts passed were the first patents act, an insolvency act, a partial consolidation of the criminal law, and the Torrens real property act, though he was at first opposed to this measure. He also passed an act legalizing marriage with a deceased wife's sister, the first of its kind in the Empire, but the royal assent was refused on this occasion.\n\nAfter leaving parliament, Hanson replaced Sir Charles Cooper as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of South Australia in 1861. He was knighted in 1869 by Queen Victoria when he visited England, and was acting Governor of South Australia for 1872–73. In his spare time Hanson gave much time to theological studies. His publications include \"Law in Nature and Other Papers\" (1865), \"The Jesus of History\" (1869), \"Letters to and from Rome\" (1869), \"The Apostle Paul\", and the \"Preaching of Christianity in the Primitive Church (1875)\". \n\nHe was elected the first Chancellor of the University of Adelaide; the first vice-chancellor was Augustus Short.\n\nHe died in Australia on 4 March 1876.\n\nFreemasonry was an integral part of Hanson's personal life. He was elected as a member and initiated into the Craft on 27 November 1834 in London when The Lodge of Friendship, a Lodge especially founded to become South Australia's first Lodge, held its very first meeting. Later he was to rise in position within the Lodge, which still exists to the present day, and ultimately served as its Master.\n\nHis summer residence, Woodhouse, near Piccadilly, South Australia, is today owned by the South Australian Scout Association, and used for Scout leader training and private functions and accommodation; the extensive grounds are used for camping and outdoor adventuring.\n\nRichard's brother William Hanson (1810–1875) was an architect and engineer who played a decisive role in the early history of South Australia's railways and waterworks.\n\nHanson married the widow Ann \"Annie\" Scanlon (perhaps Scanton), née Hopgood (died 1895) at his home, Sturt Street, Adelaide, on 29 March 1851.\n\nThe following places in South Australia were named after him:\n\n\n\n"}

He was author of \"A Categorical Manifesto\" and founder and Editor-in-Chief of the \"Journal of Consciousness Studies\". His development of institution theory impacted the field of universal logic. Standard implication in product fuzzy logic is often called \"Goguen implication\". Goguen categories are named after him.\n\nGoguen received his bachelor's degree in mathematics from Harvard University in 1963, and his PhD in mathematics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1968, where he was a student of the founder of fuzzy set theory Lotfi Zadeh.\n\nHe taught at UC Berkeley, the University of Chicago and University of California, Los Angeles, where he was a full professor of computer science. He held a Research Fellowship in the Mathematical Sciences at the IBM Watson Research Center, where he organised the \"ADJ\" group. He also visited the University of Edinburgh in Scotland on three Senior Visiting Fellowships.\n\nFrom 1979 to 1988, Goguen worked at SRI International in Menlo Park, California. From 1988 to 1996, he was a professor at the Oxford University Computing Laboratory (now the Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford) in England and a Fellow at St Anne's College, Oxford. In 1996 he became professor of Computer Science at the University of California, San Diego.\n\nGoguen's research interests included category theory (a branch of mathematics), software engineering, fuzzy logic, algebraic semantics, user interface design, algebraic semiotics, and the social and ethical aspects of science and technology.\n\nLotfi Zadeh viewed Goguen's 1968 approach to \"The Logic of Inexact Concepts\" as seminal in the field of fuzzy logic. Goguen's PhD dissertation \"Categories of fuzzy sets\" was the first work to apply category theory to fuzzy logic, and led to Goguen categories being named after him.\n\nGoguen's research in the 1970s was one of the earliest approaches to the characterisation of computational automata from a categorical perspective. Goguen's research with Thatcher, Wagner and Wright (also in the 1970s) was one of the earliest works to formalise the algebraic basis for data abstraction.\n\nIn the early 1990s Goguen and Rod Burstall developed the theory of institutions, a category-theoretic description of logical systems in computer science. Institution theory impacted the development of universal logic and became one of its most studied aspects. The term \"Carnapian Goguenism\" is used to refer to the application of institutions to ontologies.\n\nGoguen also studied the philosophy of computation and information, formal methods (especially hidden algebra and theorem proving), and relational and functional programming. He wrote a retrospective of his work and its context, \"Tossing Algebraic Flowers Down the Great Divide\".\n\nGoguen was a practitioner of Tibetan Buddhism. Specifically, since the early 1970s he was a student of Chögyam Trungpa and, after his death in 1986, of his son Sakyong Mipham. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, he was a faculty member of the science program at the Naropa Institute in Boulder, Colorado.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1960, EUROCONTROL currently has 41 member states and is headquartered in Brussels, Belgium, with local sites in Brétigny-sur-Orge, France for its R&D activities, the Institute of Air Navigation Training (IANS) a training centre in Luxembourg, and the Maastricht Upper Area Control Centre (MUAC). The organisation employs approximately two thousand people and operates with an annual budget in excess of half a billion Euro.\n\nAlthough EUROCONTROL is not an agency of the European Union, the EU has delegated parts of its Single European Sky regulations to EUROCONTROL, making it the central organisation for coordination and planning of air traffic control for all of Europe. The EU itself is a signatory of EUROCONTROL and all EU member states are presently also members of EUROCONTROL. The organisation works with national authorities, air navigation service providers, civil and military airspace users, airports, and other organisations. Its activities involve all gate-to-gate air navigation service operations: strategic and tactical flow management, controller training, regional control of airspace, safety-proofed technologies and procedures, and collection of air navigation charges.\n\nThe EUROCONTROL Convention was signed in 1960 and ratified in 1963. Before the Convention entered into force in 1963, there were already indications that the matter of national sovereignty would complicate the full implementation of the organisation's founding mission. The first European plan for a harmonised air traffic control (ATC) system, proposed in 1962, was beset by the refusal of both France and Britain to comply, largely due to reasons closely linked with their national military airspace control. The other four original members (the Federal Republic of Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg) agreed in 1964 to set up a single international air traffic control centre to manage their upper airspace, settling in the Dutch city of Maastricht.\n\nThe European Parliament at the time expressed concern about the lack of clear intergovernmental agreements to ensure common air traffic control services across the continent. In 1979, EUROCONTROL signed a working cooperation agreement with the European Commission, attempting to create a synergy of EUROCONTROL's technical expertise and EU's regulatory authorities. Several initiatives originating in this period become a lasting element of the organisation, such as the EUROCONTROL forecasting service, which became STATFOR, as well as the Aeronautical Information Service. By 1986, the pressures on the European ATC network was so big that a new, wider mandate was already being considered for EUROCONTROL, with much of the initiative coming from ECAC’s Ministers of Transport. Subsequently, ECAC urged all of its member states to join EUROCONTROL.\n\nA revised EUROCONTROL Convention was signed in 1997, renewing the organisation's optimism for greater political support, surpassing the original vision of the 1960 Convention. In June 1998, Eurocontrol, the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Commission (EC) also signed an agreement formalising cooperation in the realm of satellite navigation systems and services. In 1999 the European Commission presented its plan for a Single European Sky (SES) to the European Parliament, followed by two High Level Groups (HLG). The HLG reports on SES led to the establishment of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and reinforced the European Commission's role as the sole European aviation safety regulator, while acknowledging EUROCONTROL's technical expertise in the implementation of said regulations.\n\nThe early 2000s were marred by several fatal accidents in Europe, such as the 2001 Linate Airport disaster and the 2002 Überlingen mid-air collision, both of which were related to air traffic navigation shortcomings. The pressure was further compounded by the September 11 attacks, increasing the need for a rapid Europe-wide regulatory and coordinating body. By May 2003, EUROCONTROL and NATO had signed a memorandum of cooperation, followed by a similar memorandum with the European Commission in December 2003. In February 2004, EUROCONTROL started work on first mandates from the European Commission and in April 2004, it adopted the Single European Sky Regulations (Package 1). In March 2006, the European Commission's Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) Program was launched by the Stakeholder Consultation Group (SCG) under EUROCONTROL's aegis.\n\nEUROCONTROL provides a set of different services:\n\n\nEUROCONTROL's Maastricht Upper Area Control Centre (MUAC), ICAO designator EDYY, located at Maastricht Aachen Airport, provides air traffic control for traffic above 24,500 ft over Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and north-west Germany. In 2017 it became the first multinational, cross-border civil-military air navigation service provider since it integrated the military air traffic control of the German and Dutch upper airspace.\n\nIt is the third busiest upper area Area Control Centre (ACC) in Europe after the London Area Control Centre and Karlsruhe ACC in terms of traffic numbers, but the first in terms of flight hours and distance.\n\nMUAC has put in operation innovative technology and productivity enhancements: a new generation Flight Data Processing System, Integrated Flow Management Position, the Short Term Conflict Alert (STCA), Controller Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC) and stripless controller working positions.\n\nTypically, air traffic control sectors at MUAC can handle 55 or more flights per hour. The average flight duration is approximately 21 minutes and typically 80% of the traffic is climbing from or descending to the major European airports of London, Paris, Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Berlin.\nMaastricht UAC has undoubtedly one of the most complex airspace structures in the world and the traffic flow (up to 5,670 aircraft a day) can be disrupted by the many surrounding military airspaces.\n\nTo be considered for membership of EUROCONTROL, a country must meet \"all\" of the following criteria:\n\n\nIn addition to membership, EUROCONTROL also concludes the so-called Comprehensive Agreements, which enhances the organisation's cooperation with non-European countries that are closely tied to the continent's aviation network.\n\n\n"}

When developers draw diagrams of object-oriented software, they usually follow the UML notation. On the other hand, it is often debated whether those diagrams are needed at all, during what stages of the software development process they should be used, and how (if at all) they should be kept up to date. The primacy of software code often leads to the diagrams being deprecated.\n\nRound-trip engineering refers to the ability of a UML tool to perform code generation from models, and model generation from code (a.k.a., reverse engineering), while keeping both the model and the code semantically consistent with each other. Code generation and reverse engineering are explained in more detail below.\n\"Code generation\" in this context means that the user creates UML diagrams, which have some connected model data, and the UML tool derives from the diagrams part or all of the source code for the software system. In some tools the user can provide a skeleton of the program source code, in the form of a source code template, where predefined tokens are then replaced with program source code parts during the code generation process.\n\nThere is some debate among software developers about how useful code generation as such is . It certainly depends on the specific problem domain and how far code generation should be applied. There are well known areas where code generation is an established practice, not limited to the field of UML.\n\nThe idea of completely leaving the \"code level\" and starting to do \"programming\" directly from the UML diagram level (i.e., design level) is quite debated among developers . That is the vision for Model-driven architecture (MDA). This idea is not in such widespread use compared to other software development tools like compilers or software configuration management systems.\n\nAn often cited criticism is that the UML diagrams lack the detail that is needed to contain the same information as is covered with the program source: Jack W. Reeves states that the final embodiment of the design lies in the source code. (His often quoted statement that \"the Code \"is\" the design\" has been misinterpreted to mean that there is no need for intermediate- and high-level software-design artifacts, such as UML diagrams or software-requirements documents).\n\n\"Reverse engineering\" in this context means, that the UML tool reads program source code as input and \"derives\" model data and corresponding graphical UML diagrams from it (as opposed to the somewhat broader meaning described in the article \"Reverse engineering\").\n\nSome of the challenges of reverse engineering are:\n\nXML Metadata Interchange (XMI) is the format for UML model interchange. XMI does not support UML Diagram Interchange, which allows the importation of UML diagrams from one model to another.\n\nA key concept associated with the model-driven architecture initiative is the capacity to transform a model into another model. For example, one might want to transform a platform-independent domain model into a Java platform-specific model for implementation. It is also possible to refactor UML models to produce more concise and well-formed UML models. It is possible to generate UML models from other modeling notations, such as BPMN, which is itself a UML profile. The standard that supports this is called QVT for Queries/Views/Transformations. One example of an open-source QVT-solution is the ATL language built by INRIA.\n\n\n"}

This is in reference to the three horns found on the heads of males.\n\nThe specific name, \"jacksonii\", is a Latinized form of English explorer and ornithologist Frederick John Jackson's last name, who was serving as the first Governor of Kenya at the time.\n\nThe English word chameleon (also chamaeleon) derives from Latin \"chamaeleō\", a borrowing of the Ancient Greek χαμαιλέων (\"khamailéōn\"), a compound of χαμαί (\"khamaí\") \"on the ground\" and λέων (\"léōn\") \"lion\". The Greek word is a calque translating the Akkadian \"nēš qaqqari\", \"ground lion\".\n\nThe three subspecies, including the nominate, are:\n\nJackson's chameleons are native to woodlands and forests at altitudes of in south-central Kenya and northern Tanzania. In these areas, the rainfall is seasonal but exceeds per year. Day temperatures are typically , and night temperatures are typically . In Tanzania, it is known only from Mount Meru in the Arusha Region, which is the home of the relatively small endemic subspecies \"T. j. merumontanus\". Jackson's chameleon is more widespread in Kenya, where it is even found in wooded areas of some Nairobi suburbs. The subspecies \"T. j. xantholophus\" (native to the Mount Kenya region) was introduced to Hawaii in 1972 and has since established populations on all main islands and became invasive species there. This subspecies has also been introduced to Florida. In Hawaii, they are found mainly at altitudes of in wet, shady places. Historically this population was the primary source of Jackson's chameleons for the exotic pet trade in the United States, but exports from Hawaii are now illegal. This has been done to prevent opportunists from willfully establishing further feral animal populations to capture and sell them.\n\nJackson's chameleons are sometimes called three-horned chameleons because males possess three brown horns: one on the nose (the rostral horn) and one above each superior orbital ridge above the eyes (preocular horns), somewhat reminiscent of the ceratopsid dinosaur genus \"Triceratops\". The females generally have no horns, or instead have traces of the rostral horn (in the subspecies \"T. j. jacksonii\" and \"T. j. merumontanus\"). The coloring is usually bright green, with some individual animals having traces of blue and yellow, but like all chameleons, they change color quickly depending on mood, health, and temperature.\n\nThese are small to medium-sized chameleons. Adult males reach a total length (including tail) of up to and females up to , but more typical lengths are . They have a saw-tooth shaped dorsal ridge and no gular crest. They attain sexual maturity after five months. The lifespan is variable, with males generally living longer than females.\n\nThe largest subspecies of Jackson's chameleon is \"T. j. xantholophus\", which has been captively bred since the 1980s.\n\nJackson's chameleons live primarily on a diet of small insects. They also prey on centipedes, isopods, millipedes, spiders, lizards, small birds, and snails in their native habitat.\n\nThere is a threat of devastating impact of introduced invasive Jackson's chameleons to native ecosystems in Hawaii. They were found with mainly insects in their stomachs: planthoppers \"Oliarus\", grasshoppers \"Banza\", casebearing caterpillars \"Hyposmocoma\", beetles \"Oodemas\", dragonflies \"Pantala\" and others. Holland et al. (2010) proved that they also prey on snails in Hawaii. Their prey includes land snails \"Achatinella\", \"Auriculella\", \"Lamellidea\", \"Philonesia\", \"Oxychilus alliarius\". They are swallowing whole snails (including shells). Jackson's chameleons introduced to Hawaii are a substantial threat to native biodiversity of invertebrates and a serious threat especially to endemic species, such as critically endangered O'ahu tree snails (genus \"Achatinella\").\n\n\"T. jacksonii\" are less territorial than most species of chameleons. Males will generally assert dominance over each other through color displays and posturing in an attempt to secure mating rights, but usually not to the point of physical fights.\n\nMost chameleons are oviparous, but Jackson's chameleon gives birth to offspring soon before they are ready to hatch from their egg sac; eight to thirty live young are born after a five- to six-month gestation. The subspecies \"T. j. merumontanus\" gives birth to five to ten live young.\n\nIn captivity, Jackson's chameleons require high humidity, and are in general very needy of colder temperatures during the night. Too much heat, or excessive humidity, can cause eye infections and upper respiratory infections in these animals. In captivity, the Jackson's chameleon can be expected to live between five and ten years.\n\n"}

Eight of the club's top-earning players - known as the 'Ashton Gate Eight' - saved the club by ripping up their contracts and taking redundancy. On 6 February 1982 Bristol City played Fulham at Ashton Gate in the first match following the departure of the eight senior players. The team was populated with several young reserve team players, including an 18-year-old Newman.\n\nHaving been with the club at this low point, Newman was a key figure in improving the club's fortunes. Playing predominantly in central midfield and defence, he helped the club win promotion to Division 3 in 1984, win the Freight Rover Trophy in 1986 and achieve a further promotion, to Division 2, in 1990.\n\nAfter a decade at Ashton Gate, Newman was sold to Norwich City for £600,000 in the summer of 1991. He was a member of the Norwich team that finished a club record third in the FA Premier League in 1992–93 and went on to play a part in the defeat of Bayern Munich in the following season's UEFA Cup. He had also helped them reach the semi-finals of the FA Cup in his first season at Carrow Road.\n\nDuring his time with Norwich, Newman was initially used in 1991–92 as a central midfielder, where he managed to score several important goals. He even deputised as a forward covering for injuries. He was ultimately primarily played in central defence in the majority of games for Norwich, particularly later on in his career. Newman was noted for his determination, versatility and a very hard (if not always accurate) shot.\n\nDuring a dead ball competition at Wembley in 1994, it was found that Newman had the hardest shot in the league at the time.\n\nHe stayed at Norwich until the end of the 1997-98, when new manager Bruce Rioch decided not to renew his contract. He then signed for Southend United, and later worked on the coaching staff at Roots Hall, as well as having a spell as assistant manager.\n\nTowards the end of the 2002–03 season, Newman signed as cover for Chelmsford City. In July 2003, Newman signed for Gorleston. In October 2004, Newman was appointed caretaker manager of Gorleston.\n\nAfter his playing days, Newman became a manager in the lower leagues of English football. He had a short time spell at Southend United before being appointed assistant manager to Steve Thompson at Cambridge United in December 2004. Following Thompson's departure from an unsuccessful spell which led to Cambridge's relegation from the Football League, Newman was appointed manager in May 2005.\n\nNewman built a squad with very little money and showed his abilities in scouting little-known players. He also gained the support of the majority of Cambridge fans, earning him the nickname of 'Buzz Lightyear', owing to his facial likeness to the character from the motion-picture Toy Story. Some fans even set up a fan site (see below), and wore Buzz Lightyear masks in homage to him.\n\nHowever, he was sacked following United's 3–1 defeat by Exeter City on 1 September 2006 that left the club second-bottom of the Conference.\n\nThe following month, the new Bournemouth manager Kevin Bond appointed Newman as his assistant. Newman also played for the Bournemouth reserves team. Most of the time, it was when Reserve Team Manager Eddie Howe played a youthful side to help stabilise the defence. Occasionally, he was included in Bournemouth first team, being named a sub in the match against Carlisle after the team had only 14 fit first team players. He made his Bournemouth début away to Bristol Rovers in a Football League Trophy South Section Area Second Round match, appearing as a substitute. Bournemouth went on to win the match 1–0. Newman was sacked along with Kevin Bond and Eddie Howe in September 2008.\n\nNewman is currently head of Manchester City's Spanish scouting team.\n\n"}

Later involvement in 2008 Bangalore serial blast. He is under judicial custody in relation with the 2008 Bangalore serial blasts. But his involvement is unproven as of yet as trials are still being held. Allegations against Mahdani are yet to be proved.\n\nAt a young age, Mahdani(Maudany) began delivering sermons at a local mosque in the Kollam district. His oratorical skills were well received, and he soon built up a following.\nHe subsequently formed the Islamic Seva Sangh (ISS) and later launched the PDP.Communist Party of India (Marxist) forged alliance with PDP at various elections in Kerala state. The PDP also won a few seats in the council elections.\n\nAbdul Nasser Mahdani delivered a speech at Chengara Adivasi Protest in support of the struggle in May 2008. He declared the objective of Muslim-Dalit-Adivasi Unity under the banner of \"Power to Avarnas and Liberation to The Oppressed\"\n\n\"I am a committed Muslim and every Muslim has the obligation to support the poor, Adivasis and Dalits...It is my duty to stand by you to fight for your rights..If needed, to be a martyr dying for this cause..\"\n\n\"Freedom has not been achieved so far; to those cannot give proper education to their children, to Dalits and enslaved people of this country, to those innocent people- who were massacred at Bhiwandi, Assam, Gujarat, Jamshedpur, Guwahati, Varanasi, Ayodhya- to the minority communities, to the dispossessed and deprived, to those landless and poor, to those who have no land to bury their dead …When the 50th anniversary of Indian independence day of \"Masters\" is being celebrated, I have declared that the Subalterns of this country have not yet attained independence...\"\n\nWith the aim of providing legal and financial aid to PDP chairman Abdul Nasser Madani, who has been arrested in connection with the Bangalore blast case, to wage legal and political battle, Justice For Madani Forum was constituted under the aegis of various Muslim organisations on 25 August 2010. The Justice for Madani Forum demanded that the Bangalore blast case, in which PDP leader Abdul Nasser Madani, has been listed as an accused, should be probed by any agency outside the state of Karnataka, preferably by the National Investigating Agency (NIA).\n\nThe documentary by K.P Sasi (son of K Damodaran) expands on how Madani was framed.\n\nThe Kerala assembly on 16 March 2006, passed a unanimous resolution seeking the release of Abdul Nasser Mahdani, on humanitarian grounds.\n\nMahdani had set up the Islamic Seva Sangh in 1989. It was banned in 1992 for alleged subversive act SIMI, Jamath Islami and Shiv Sena following the Babri Masjid demolition.\n\nInvestigators allege that suspected south India commander of the Lashkar-e-Taiba Thadiyantavide Nazeer came into militancy through ISS founded by Madani. Nazeer is suspected to have established links with LeT and was picked up by Bangladeshi authorities and handed over to BSF on the Meghalaya border.\nIn connection with the Bangalore blast case, Police have presented phone records to the court proving that Madani contacted the main accused Nazeer several times before and after the blast. Phone calls were made from a number registered in Madani's wife Soofiya's name. According to the police, after orchestrating the blasts Nasir went in hiding at Madani's office at Anvarssery. However Madani's advocate B V Acharya has contended that it is \"only a make believe theory to implicate Madani\".\n\n\nHe was alleged in the Coimbatore serial bomb blasts case held on 14 February 1998, that killed 58 people. Mahdani was imprisoned for nine years as an under trial. However, Mahdani was acquitted of all charges. Mahdani charged that there is a hidden political agenda in connecting him with the Coimbatore blast case.\n\nMahdani is lodged in Karnataka jail and is in judicial custody for his involvement in the 2008 Bangalore serial blasts and similar incidents in Ahmedabad, Surat and Jaipur. Two persons were killed and 20 injured when the blasts rocked the cyber city at nine locations in 2008. As per former Karnataka state Home Minister late V S Acharya, Mahdani also allegedly admitted role in the 2010 Bangalore stadium bombing on 17 April 2010, which he had denied earlier. This assertion regarding the confession of Mahdani was rejected by Mahdani's counsel and said that the allegation baseless and devoid of facts, and is politically motivated. After a court issued a fresh non-bailable warrant, he proffered to surrender so as to avoid 'unpleasant situations' when he was to be arrested. On 11 February 2011, the Karnataka High Court had rejected Mahdani's plea. The High Court had said, \"There is seldom ever that direct evidence is there in such cases. Conspiracy by very nature is hatched in complete secrecy otherwise the whole purpose will be frustrated. The testimonies of witnesses, G Prabhakar, KB Rafeeq and KK Yoganand were quoted in the judgement dismissing the bail plea. At the final hearing Justice Markandey Katju uttered that he was wondering as to \"how a person on a wheel chair could pose a threat if released on bail.?\" Finally the Supreme court bench was divided on granting bail to Mahdani and posted the matter to chief justice of India to form a new bench to decide on the plea. In March 2013 Mahdani was granted a 5-day interim bail to attend his daughter's (shemeera maudani) wedding and to visit his ailing father. On 21 October 2013, the Supreme court of India directed the Karnataka Government to immediately shift Mahdani to a private hospital for treatment. The court also allowed his wife to be along with him as a bystander during his stay in the hospital. On 24 July 2017, his bail application for attending his son's marriage on 9 August was rejected by NIA court. In response to this,his party PDP called for state wide harthal in Kerala on 26 July 2017.\n\nThe testimony of Rafeeq, who had worked in the Lakkeri estate as a labour and was arrested by SIT in 2008 reads, \"I have seen strangers visit the estate. Among them was a man wearing a cap. I had seen him only on television. I realised that the man was Mahdani.\" Some of the Bharatiya Janata Party and RSS workers said they had not seen Mahdani in the area.\n\nMurder attempt case\n\nMadhani has been named the first accused in a case registered in 2013 relating to the alleged attempt in 1998 to murder RSS ideologue P Parameswaran and Father KK Alavi, a convert into Christianity from Islam. The case relates to Madhani offering money to murder RSS think-tank Bharatiya Vichara Kendram Director P Parameshwaran and Father Alavi. Madhani dismissed the charges and said he is not involved in this. Madhani alleged political conspiracy against him. In September 2015, Crime Branch had submitted to the court that Parameswaran and Alavi had stated that they had never faced any attempt on their life as alleged in the complaint. And no evidence could be obtained to substantiate this allegation against Mahdani.\n\n"}

The flag's appearance varied greatly depending on where it was made: different manufacturers produced Federation Flags with darker or lighter shades of blue for the cross background; using five-pointed stars instead of eight; or positioning the stars in different places. \n\nThe Eureka Flag, flown by rebels at the Eureka Stockade in 1854, was reportedly influenced by designs such as the Federation flag. \n\nWhile the Federation Flag proved popular and was widely used on the East Coast of Australia for over 70 years, it was never officially adopted. It was especially popular among proponents of Australian Federation and was also used as an unofficial ensign by the merchant marine. In 1884 Lord Derby of the Colonial Office banned the use of the Flag at sea, possibly because of its similarity to the White Ensign.\n\nIn the 1880s and early 1890s it was used as a symbol of the political movement towards Federation, with groups like the Australian Natives' Association and the Australian Federation League using it to promote national consciousness of their push for Federation, under the slogan \"One People, One Destiny, One Flag\".\n\nThe flag was a favourite of Australia's first Prime Minister, Sir Edmund Barton, who asked that a variant be considered for approval along with the competition-winning Blue Ensign. The Colonial Office rejected the Federation Flag, issuing Barton a mild rebuke. The Australian government received approval to fly the Blue Ensign in 1903, but the Australian Federation Flag was still being flown by Australian citizens as late as the 1920s.\n\nIt is still used in Sydney Central Railway Station main hall.

Waddell's signs may indicate non-organic or psychological component to chronic low back pain. Historically they have also been used to detect malingering in patients with back pain. While testing takes less than one minute, it has been described as time-consuming and alternatives have been proposed.\n\nWaddell, \"et al\". (1980) described five categories of signs:\n\nAny individual sign marks its category as positive. When three or more categories were positive, the finding was considered clinically significant. However, assessing the patient on the basis of overreaction has raised concerns regarding observer bias and idiosyncrasies related to the patient's culture. Consequently, a practitioner may assess the patient on the remaining four categories, with two or more positive categories being considered clinically significant.\n\nOne or two Waddell's signs can often be found even when there is not a strong non-organic component to pain. Three or more are positively correlated with high scores for depression, hysteria and hypochondriasis on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory.\n\nAlthough Waddell's signs can detect a non-organic component to pain, they do not exclude an organic cause. Clinically significant Waddell scores are considered indicative only of symptom magnification or pain behavior, and have been misused in medical and medico-legal contexts. Waddell's signs are not considered a \"de facto\" indicator of deception for the purpose of financial gain.\n\nIn a 2003 review, Fishbain, \"et al\". stated that Waddell's signs do not reliably distinguish organic from psychological pain but instead tend to underestimate the amount of pain that is actually experienced. In a 2004 review, Fishbain, \"et al\". concluded, \"there was little evidence for the claims of an association between Waddell signs and secondary gain and malingering. The preponderance of the evidence points to the opposite: no association\".\n\nIn 2010, a neuroanatomical basis of Waddell's signs has been proposed which argues that since the brain is organic, and even society is composed of a group of organic beings, the term \"nonorganic\" should be replaced by a term put forward by Chris Spanswick in 1997, \"behavioral responses to physical examination.\" With the possible exception of cogwheel rigidity, these are best understood as neuroanatomical maladaptations to long-continued pain and, as Waddell and colleagues have stressed, do not indicate faking or malingering but rather that there are psychosocial issues that mitigate against successfully treating low back pain by lumbar discectomy, and which in themselves require other treatment.\n"}

The term is most often used to indicate a distinctive time period either before or after the beginning of a century or both before and after.\n\nWhere no specific century is stated, the term usually refers to the most recent transition of centuries.\n\nIn British English the phrase 'the turn of the nineteenth century' refers to the years immediately preceding and immediately following 1801, 'the turn of the twentieth century' to the years surrounding 1901, and so on.\n\nIn American English it isn't so clear cut. According to the \"Chicago Manual of Style\" online Q&A, there is no common agreement as to the meaning of the phrase \"turn of the \"n\"-th century.\" For instance, if a statement describes an event as taking place \"at the turn of the 18th century,\" it could refer to a period around the year 1701 or around 1800, that is, the beginning or end of that century. As a result, they recommend either using only \"turn of the century,\" and only in a context that makes clear which transition is meant, or alternatively to use a different expression that is unambiguous. \"Turn of the century\" commonly meant the transition from the 19th century to the 20th century; however, as the generations living at the end of the 20th century survived into the 21st century, the specific number of the referenced century became necessary to avoid confusion.\n\n"}

It most often includes the extinct groups Temnospondyli and Lepospondyli. The first tetrapods were all amphibians in the physiological sense that they laid their eggs in water, and are colloquially sometimes referred to as labyrinthodonts or stegocephalians. In this scheme, batrachomorphs composed one branch of these early amphibians, while the reptiliomorphs composed the other. While the actual phylogeny of the modern amphibians is not well understood, their ancestors are descended from one line of batrachomorphs. All other living tetrapods (reptiles, birds and mammals) are descended from one branch of reptiliomorphs, the amniotes. Amniotes achieved dominance, while all other reptiliomorphs and most batrachomorphs have gone extinct.\n\nThe name Batrachomorpha was coined by the Swedish palaeontologist Gunnar Säve-Söderbergh in 1934 to refer to ichthyostegids, temnospondyls, anthracosaurs, and the frogs. Säve-Söderbergh held the view that salamanders and caecilians are not related to the other tetrapods, but had developed independently from a different group of lobe-finned fish, the porolepiformes. In this view amphibians would be a biphyletic group, and Batrachomorpha was erected to form a natural group consisting of the \"true amphibians\" (i.e. frogs in Säve-Söderberghs view) and their fossil relatives. The salamanders and the Lepospondyli was consigned to \"Urodelomorpha\".\n\nFriedrich von Huene adopted it as a superorder of his subclass \"Eutetrapoda\" (the lower tetrapods exclusive of the urodeles) and included the orders Stegocephalia (here including a number of Labyrinthodonts and anurans). Erik Jarvik, who took over Säve-Söderberghs work and shared his view of the origin of salamanders, used the term more informally, but in a wider sense, to include the ancestral osteolepiform fishes.\n\nThough never a majority view, the notion that tetrapods had evolved twice, together with the usage of the term batrachomorpha, lingered until genetic analysis started confirming the monophyly of living amphibians in the 1990s. Jarviks classification is no longer followed, all living amphibians and their fossil relatives now being classified together in the group Lissamphibia.\n\nMichael Benton adopted the term Batrachomorpha to include all living amphibians and extinct relatives more closely related to amphibians than to reptiles. In his scheme, Batrachomorpha is a subclass of Amphibia, containing the following orders:\n\nThe other groups of tetrapods considered more closely related to amniotes are put in the subclass Reptiliomorpha.\n\nThe phylogenetic relationships of Paleozoic tetrapods have not yet been worked out with certainty, and the validity of Batrachomorpha as a clade depends on where other amphibians and early amniotes fit on the evolutionary tree. The actual content of Batrachomorpha as cladistically defined is therefore uncertain, and in some phylogenies the clade is redundant (e.g. Laurin 1996).\n\nBatrachomorphs are distinguished by a number of features in the skeleton, including a flat or shallow skull, a fused skull roof with no cranial kinesis, exoccipital-postparietal contact on the occiput, and four or fewer fingers on the hand.\n\nBenton contrasts Batrachomorphs with Reptiliomorphs; both are stem-based clades; the former constitutes the \"amphibian\" evolutionary radiation, the latter the contemporary proto-reptilian and early amniote evolution.\n\nIn the appendix to Vertebrate Palaeontology, which combines cladistic and linnaean rankings, Benton has given Batrachomorpha the rank of Subclass in his 2001 edition and Class in the 2004 edition.\n\n"}

{"id": "1894503", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1894503", "title": "Shangyu District", "text": "Shangyu District\n\nShangyu District () is a district of the prefecture-level city of Shaoxing in the northeast of Zhejiang province, China. At the 2010 census, its population in the built-up (\"or metro\") area was 779,412, up from 722,523 in the 2000 census. Shangyu is roughly fifty kilometers from north to south and about thirty kilometers from east to west. It makes up about one-fourth of the area of Shaoxing prefecture. Shangyu District is not part of the Hangzhou-Shaoxing built-up area as some countryside still prevent the city from being conurbated until now.\n\nSubdistricts:\n\nTowns:\n\nTownships:\n\nShangyu's urban center, Baiguan, is located where the Cao'e River flows out of the hilly area that makes up more than half of the county, into flat alluvial land bordering Hangzhou Bay. This river, and the Cao E Temple () next to it, are named after a fourteen-year-old girl who became famous in 143 AD for her filial devotion. She died in the river trying to retrieve the body of her father (Cao Xu) who drowned while officiating at a ceremony in honor of Wu Zixu who himself was famous for his filial piety.\n\nBaiguan is about east of Shaoxing's urban center. The railroad from Hangzhou to Ningbo passes through Baiguan, and the new superhighway between Hangzhou and Ningbo skirts Baiguan. Within Shangyu, just northwest of Baiguan, the Hangzhou-Ningbo highway (mostly east-west) intersects with a superhighway that goes south to the seacoast and then down the coast, through Wenzhou and Fuzhou, all the way to Guangzhou.\n\nIn the name \"Baiguan\" () “bai” means “hundred” and “guan” means an imperial civil service official. The city came to be called this when it became famous for producing many scholars who became officials by passing the imperial civil service examination.\nIn the tragic legend of the Butterfly Lovers, the young lady was from Shangyu and the young gentleman was from Shaoxing.\n\nTwo books by Zhang Jinhuan () published by the Zhejiang University Press deal with porcelain (mostly celadon) produced in the Cao'e River Valley in Shangyu starting in the Eastern Han dynasty:\nShangyu Yue Kilns () (2007) , and\nYue Porcelain Gems () (2009) .\n\nWu language, also known as Jiang Nan, Wu Yue, Jiang Dong language. Three thousand years of history from the Zhou Dynasty. In China, Wu language are distributing in Zhejiang, southern part of Jiangsu, Shanghai, southern part of Anhui and Fujian province. The population who use this language is about ninety million.\n\nPeople in Shangyu are use Wu language as major communication way in daily life. This language retains many ancient tones and words, culture value of research Chinese development is very high. It is a vivid expression of the thinking way and life style of the people who live in the south of the Yangtze River. More than one hundred cities led by Shanghai, make up Wu city group and Jiangnan culture circle that have similar value recognition, creating huge treasure through unity and mutual aid. Yangtze river delta region became the richest area in the whole China, Shangyu district is one of important part in it.\n\nPutonghua (Standard mandarin) is the general language of China, it takes Beijing pronunciation as the standard pronunciation, northern dialect as the basic dialect. Shangyu is located in the south of China, so these two languages are very different, but to enhance communication among all ethnic groups and promote the cohesion of the Chinese nation, the government started popularizing Putonghua on a national scale from 2005. Therefore, people in Shangyu using Wu language as daily communication and using Putonghua in schools or travel to other places.\n\nSteamed pork with preserved vegetables ()\n\nCook pork firstly with star anise and soy sauce, then cover the pork with the pickled vegetables, finally steamed together in the specific pot. It tastes delicious but not greasy due to heavy fat, smooth and chewy. For the nutrition value, Pork have high quality protein and essential fatty acid, preserved vegetables have high concentration carotene and magnesium.\n\nFermented bean curd ()\nIt is a traditional folk food that has been spread for thousands of years in China. Because of its good taste, high nutrition and specific smell, the special flavor of eating is loved by the Chinese people. Fermented bean curd can be divides to three categories that are red, white and green. \"Red hot\", \"Rose\" and \"Sweet spicy\" are characteristics of fermented bean curd, which are only produce in Shangyu district. Bean curd make from beans and yellow wine. Because of its good taste, high nutrition and specific smell, the special flavor of eating is loved by the Chinese people. Fermented bean curd can be divides to three categories that are red, white and green.\n\nIt cover the culture and memory of Shangyu people from childhood. It is the best food for breakfast.\n\nAs for the cook methods, every family have different ways to do it depend on taste and mom's requirements\n\nYellow rice wine ()\nYellow rice wine used rice, millet as raw materials, the general alcohol content is 14% - 20%, belongs to low degree brewing wine. Yellow rice wine has high nutrition value, contains 21 kinds of amino acids, eight kinds of essential amino acids that the human can't synthesis must rely on food intake are all exist in yellow rice wine. “Marden red” is the most famous yellow rice wine in Shangyu, this kind of wine buried in the soil when girls born, after about 18 years, as present to husband on the wedding.\n\nShangyu has a long history, the inscriptions on oracle bones have already recorded “Shangyu” which is 3000 years ago. Therefore, many human landscapes were existed in history and keep until now.\nSouthern part of Shangyu are hilly and mountain area, natural landscapes like quaternary glacier and fruit trees are famous here.\n\nFengming Mountain ()\n\nFengming mountain is located in the town of Fenghui, about far from town center. Scenic area is about 2.4 square kilometers, the “overhanging rocks and waterfall” and “one-thousand-year-old vine” are most popular and shocked landscapes. In addition, Taoist literatures named here are “the ninth great holy land” because alchemy ancestor and the Taoist patriarch Wei Boyang was born and concocted pills of immortality in this mountain, finally write down the book “Zhou yi shen tong qi”, which has great and unique contribution to the study of ancient chemistry and health science.\n\nGong Mountain ()\n\nGong mountain located in Songxia town, cross Yixian County, Xiuning County and Huizhou District. The area is about 1078 square kilometers. Gong mountain is one of the most famous three mountains in Zhejiang province. Sunrise, strangely-shaped pines, rocks, sea of clouds, hot springs are \"five beauties\" that all tourists love them. In addition, Gong mountain with important scientific and ecological value of study the change and development of geologic structures.\n\nThe Famen Temple ()\n\nFaning Temple, renowned for storing the veritable finger bone of the Shakyamuni Buddha, is located in Shangyu of Zhejiang province. Faning Temple was established in the Eastern Han Dynasty (25–220) for spreading Buddhism. The most representative structures in the temple are the Faning Temple Pagoda and Faning Temple Museum. Many royal treasures and jewelry were found here because Buddhism was supported by dominators in ancient China. Faning Temple was the royal temple during the Sui and Tang Dynasty. Emperors in Sui and Tang believed that enshrining and worshiping the bone of Shakyamuni would bring richness and peace to the land and people. So, the finger bone was stored carefully, which was housed in the underground palace.\nGlaciers of Fuzhi mountain ()\n\nFuzhi mountain located in the border area of Shangyu, Shengzhou and Yuyao city. The elevation of Fuzhi mountain is 861.3 meters, cloud and mist around the mountain almost whole year, and a stone river rolling with the slope. The existence of stone river duo to the quaternary glacier movements.\n\nThe large scale of the fourth stone glaciers in Shangyu, the richness of the ancient glacial kinds and located in such low latitudes and low altitude area is rare all over the word, which is called the world wonder. Discovery results has proved that in the early Quaternary period of about 2.9 to 3 million 500 thousand years ago, this area did have a large scale of ancient glacial movement. It can provide important practical data for the study of quaternary geological history, climate and environmental evolution in east Asia and the world. On the other hand, because of the unique sceneries of the stone glacier and the ice terrace that high ornamental value in Fuzhi mountain become an awesome tourist resource.\n"}
{"id": "1894504", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1894504", "title": "Brain implant", "text": "Brain implant\n\nBrain implants, often referred to as neural implants, are technological devices that connect directly to a biological subject's brain – usually placed on the surface of the brain, or attached to the brain's cortex. A common purpose of modern brain implants and the focus of much current research is establishing a biomedical prosthesis circumventing areas in the brain that have become dysfunctional after a stroke or other head injuries. This includes sensory substitution, e.g., in vision. Other brain implants are used in animal experiments simply to record brain activity for scientific reasons. Some brain implants involve creating interfaces between neural systems and computer chips. This work is part of a wider research field called brain-computer interfaces. (Brain-computer interface research also includes technology such as EEG arrays that allow interface between mind and machine but do not require direct implantation of a device.)\n\nNeural implants such as deep brain stimulation and Vagus nerve stimulation are increasingly becoming routine for patients with Parkinson's disease and clinical depression, respectively.\n\nBrain implants electrically stimulate, block or record (or both record and stimulate simultaneously) signals from single neurons or groups of neurons (biological neural networks) in the brain. The blocking technique is called intra-abdominal vagal blocking. This can only be done where the functional associations of these neurons are approximately known. Because of the complexity of neural processing and the lack of access to action potential related signals using neuroimaging techniques, the application of brain implants has been seriously limited until recent advances in neurophysiology and computer processing power. Much research is also being done on the surface chemistry of neural implants in effort to design products which minimize all negative effects that an active implant can have on the brain, and that the body can have on the function of the implant. Researchers are also exploring a range of delivery systems, such as using veins, to deliver these implants without brain surgery; by leaving the skull sealed shut, patients could receive their neural implants without running as great a risk of seizures, strokes, or permanent neural impairments, all of which can be caused by open-brain surgery.\n\nResearch in sensory substitution has made significant progress since 1970. Especially in vision, due to the knowledge of the working of the visual system, eye implants (often involving some brain implants or monitoring) have been applied with demonstrated success. For hearing, cochlear implants are used to stimulate the auditory nerve directly. The vestibulocochlear nerve is part of the peripheral nervous system, but the interface is similar to that of true brain implants.\n\nMultiple projects have demonstrated success at recording from the brains of animals for long periods of time. As early as 1976, researchers at the NIH led by Edward Schmidt made action potential recordings of signals from rhesus monkey motor cortexes using immovable \"hatpin\" electrodes, including recording from single neurons for over 30 days, and consistent recordings for greater than three years from the best electrodes.\n\nThe \"hatpin\" electrodes were made of pure iridium and insulated with Parylene, materials that are currently used in the Cyberkinetics implementation of the Utah array. These same electrodes, or derivations thereof using the same biocompatible electrode materials, are currently used in visual prosthetics laboratories, laboratories studying the neural basis of learning, and motor prosthetics approaches other than the Cyberkinetics probes.\n\nOther laboratory groups produce their own implants to provide unique capabilities not available from the commercial products.\n\nBreakthroughs include: studies of the process of functional brain re-wiring throughout the learning of a sensory discrimination, control of physical devices by rat brains, monkeys over robotic arms, remote control of mechanical devices by monkeys and humans, remote control over the movements of roaches, the first reported use of the Utah Array in a human for bidirectional signalling. Currently a number of groups are conducting preliminary motor prosthetic implants in humans. These studies are presently limited to several months by the longevity of the implants. The array now forms the sensor component of the Braingate.\n\nMuch research is also being done on the surface chemistry of neural implants in effort to design products which minimize all negative effects that an active implant can have on the brain, and that the body can have on the function of the implant.\n\nAnother type of neural implant that is being experimented on is Prosthetic Neuronal Memory Silicon Chips, which imitate the signal processing done by functioning neurons that allows peoples' brains to create long-term memories.\n\nIn 2016, scientists at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign announced development of tiny brain sensors for use postoperative monitoring, which melt away when they are no longer needed.\n\nIn 2016, scientists out of the University of Melbourne published proof-of-concept data related to a discovery for Stentrode, a device implanted via the jugular vein, demonstrated the potential for a neural recording device to be engineered onto a stent and implanted into a blood vessel in the brain, without the need for open brain surgery. The technology platform is being developed for patients with paralysis to facilitate control of external devices such as robotic limbs, computers and exoskeletons by translating brain activity. It may ultimately help diagnose and treat a range of brain pathologies, such as epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease.\n\nDARPA has announced its interest in developing \"cyborg insects\" to transmit data from sensors implanted into the insect during the pupal stage. The insect's motion would be controlled from a Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) and could conceivably survey an environment or detect explosives and gas. Similarly, DARPA is developing a neural implant to remotely control the movement of sharks. The shark's unique senses would then be exploited to provide data feedback in relation to enemy ship movement or underwater explosives.\n\nIn 2006, researchers at Cornell University invented a new surgical procedure to implant artificial structures into insects during their metamorphic development. The first insect cyborgs, moths with integrated electronics in their thorax, were demonstrated by the same researchers. The initial success of the techniques has resulted in increased research and the creation of a program called Hybrid-Insect-MEMS, HI-MEMS. Its goal, according to DARPA's Microsystems Technology Office, is to develop \"tightly coupled machine-insect interfaces by placing micro-mechanical systems inside the insects during the early stages of metamorphosis\".\n\nThe use of neural implants has recently been attempted, with success, on cockroaches. Surgically applied electrodes were put on the insect, which were remotely controlled by a human. The results, although sometimes different, basically showed that the cockroach could be controlled by the impulses it received through the electrodes. DARPA is now funding this research because of its obvious beneficial applications to the military and other areas\n\nIn 2009 at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Micro-electronic mechanical systems (MEMS) conference in Italy, researchers demonstrated the first \"wireless\" flying-beetle cyborg. Engineers at the University of California at Berkeley pioneered the design of a \"remote controlled beetle\", funded by the DARPA HI-MEMS Program. This was followed later that year by the demonstration of wireless control of a \"lift-assisted\" moth-cyborg.\n\nEventually researchers plan to develop HI-MEMS for dragonflies, bees, rats and pigeons. For the HI-MEMS cybernetic bug to be considered a success, it must fly from a starting point, guided via computer into a controlled landing within of a specific end point. Once landed, the cybernetic bug must remain in place.\n\nIn 2012, DARPA provided seed funding to Dr. Thomas Oxley, a neurointerventionist at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, for a technology that became known as Stentrode. Oxley’s group in Australia was the only non-US-based funded by DARPA as part of the Reliable Neural Interface Technology (RE-NET) program. This technology is the first to attempt to provide neural implants through a minimally invasive surgical procedure that does not require cutting into the skull. That is, an electrode array built onto a self-expanding stent, implanted into the brain via cerebral angiography. This pathway can provide safe, easy access and capture a strong signal for a number of indications beyond addressing paralysis, and is currently in clinical trials in patients with severe paralysis seeking to regain the ability to communicate.\n\nIn 2015 it was reported that scientists from the Perception and Recognition Neuro-technologies Laboratory at the Southern Federal University in Rostov-on-Don suggested using rats with microchips planted in their brains to detect explosive devices.\n\nIn 2016 it was reported that American engineers are developing a system that would transform locusts into \"remote controlled explosive detectors\" with electrodes in their brains beaming information about dangerous substances back to their operators.\n\nNeurostimulators have been in use since 1997 to ease the symptoms of such diseases as epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, dystonia and recently depression.\n\nCurrent brain implants are made from a variety of materials such as tungsten, silicon, platinum-iridium, or even stainless steel. Future brain implants may make use of more exotic materials such as nanoscale carbon fibers (nanotubes), and polycarbonate urethane.\n\nBrain implants are also being explored by DARPA as part of the Reliable Neural-Interface Technology (RE-NET) program launched in 2010 to directly address the need for high-performance neural interfaces to control the dexterous functions made possible by DARPA’s advanced prosthetic limbs. The goal is to provide high-bandwidth, intuitive control interface for these limbs, in order to achieve their full potential to improve quality of life for wounded troops.\n\nIn 1870, Eduard Hitzig and Gustav Fritsch demonstrated that electrical stimulation of the brains of dogs could produce movements. Robert Bartholow showed the same to be true for humans in 1874. By the start of the 20th century, Fedor Krause began to systematically map human brain areas, using patients that had undergone brain surgery.\n\nProminent research was conducted in the 1950s. Robert G. Heath experimented with aggressive mental patients, aiming to influence his subjects' moods through electrical stimulation.\n\nYale University physiologist Jose Delgado demonstrated limited control of animal and human subjects' behaviours using electronic stimulation. He invented the \"stimoceiver\" or \"transdermal stimulator\", a device implanted in the brain to transmit electrical impulses that modify basic behaviours such as aggression or sensations of pleasure.\n\nDelgado was later to write a popular book on mind control, called \"Physical Control of the Mind\", where he stated: \"the feasibility of remote control of activities in several species of animals has been demonstrated [...] The ultimate objective of this research is to provide an understanding of the mechanisms involved in the directional control of animals and to provide practical systems suitable for human application.\"\n\nIn the 1950s, the CIA also funded research into mind control techniques, through programs such as MKULTRA. Perhaps because he received funding for some research through the US Office of Naval Research, it has been suggested (but not proven) that Delgado also received backing through the CIA. He denied this claim in a 2005 article in \"Scientific American\" describing it only as a speculation by conspiracy-theorists. He stated that his research was only progressively scientifically motivated to understand how the brain works.\n\nRecent advances in neurotechnologies and neuroimaging, along with an increased understanding of neurocircuitry, are factors contributing to the rapid rise in the use of neurostimulation therapies to treat an increasingly wide range of neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Electrical stimulation technologies are evolving after remaining fairly stagnant for the past 30 years, moving toward potential closed-loop therapeutic control systems with the ability to deliver stimulation with higher spatial resolution to provide continuous customized neuromodulation for optimal clinical outcomes.\n\nEthical questions raised include who are good candidates to receive neural implants and what are good and bad uses of neural implants.\nWhilst deep brain stimulation is increasingly becoming routine for patients with Parkinson's disease, there may be some behavioural side effects. Reports in the literature describe the possibility of apathy, hallucinations, compulsive gambling, hypersexuality, cognitive dysfunction, and depression. However, these may be temporary and related to correct placement and calibration of the stimulator and so are potentially reversible.\n\nSome transhumanists, such as Raymond Kurzweil and Kevin Warwick, see brain implants as part of a next step for humans in progress and evolution, whereas others, especially bioconservatives, view them as unnatural, with humankind losing essential human qualities. It raises controversy similar to other forms of human enhancement. For instance, it is argued that implants would technically change people into cybernetic organisms (cyborgs). It's also expected that all research will comply to the Declaration of Helsinki. Yet further, the usual legal duties apply such as information to the person wearing implants and that the implants are voluntary, with (very) few exceptions.\n\nOther concerns involve vulnerabilities of neural implants to cybercrime or intrusive surveillance as neural implants could be hacked, misused or misdesigned.\nSadja states that \"one's private thoughts are important to protect\" and doesn't consider it a good idea to just charge the government or any company with protecting them. Walter Glannon, a neuroethicist of the University of Calgary notes that \"there is a risk of the microchips being hacked by third parties\" and that \"this could interfere with the user's intention to perform actions, violate privacy by extracting information from the chip\".\n\nBrain implants are now part of modern culture but there were early philosophical references of relevance as far back as René Descartes.\n\nIn his 1641 \"Meditations\", Descartes argued that it would be impossible to tell if all one's apparently real experiences were in fact being produced by an evil demon intent on deception. A modern twist on Descartes' argument is provided by the \"brain in a vat\" thought experiment, which imagines a brain, sustained apart from its body in a vat of nutrients, and hooked up to a computer which is capable of stimulating it in such a way as to produce the illusion that everything is normal.\n\nPopular science fiction discussing brain implants and mind control became widespread in the 20th century, often with a dystopian outlook. Literature in the 1970s delved into the topic, including \"The Terminal Man\" by Michael Crichton, where a man suffering from brain damage receives an experimental surgical brain implant designed to prevent seizures, which he abuses by triggering for pleasure. Another example is Larry Niven's science fiction writing of wire-heads in his \"Known Space\" stories.\n\nFear that the technology will be misused by the government and military is an early theme. In the 1981 BBC serial \"The Nightmare Man\" the pilot of a high-tech mini submarine is linked to his craft via a brain implant but becomes a savage killer after ripping out the implant.\n\nPerhaps the most influential novel exploring the world of brain implants was William Gibson's 1984 novel \"Neuromancer\". This was the first novel in a genre that came to be known as \"cyberpunk\". It follows a computer hacker through a world where mercenaries are augmented with brain implants to enhance strength, vision, memory, etc. Gibson coins the term \"matrix\" and introduces the concept of \"jacking in\" with head electrodes or direct implants. He also explores possible entertainment applications of brain implants such as the \"simstim\" (simulated stimulation) which is a device used to record and playback experiences.\n\nGibson's work led to an explosion in popular culture references to brain implants. Its influences are felt, for example, in the 1989 roleplaying game \"Shadowrun\", which borrowed his term \"datajack\" to describe a brain-computer interface. The implants in Gibson's novels and short stories formed the template for the 1995 film \"Johnny Mnemonic\" and later, \"The Matrix Trilogy\".\n\nPulp fiction with implants or brain implants include the novel series \"Typers\", film \"Spider-Man 2\", the TV series \"\", and numerous computer/video games.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is a piercing done at the rear rim of the vulva, in the area of frenulum labiorum pudendi. Many women do not have a pinchable flap of skin in the area, and are not suited for this piercing. If the correct anatomy is present, placement and piercing tends to be relatively easy.\n\nThe fourchette piercing is most similar in location to the male guiche piercing. It requires a pinchable flap of skin at the rear rim of the vulva. Piercers should not pierce into the vaginal tissue or vaginal canal as the vaginal tissue often rejects the piercing. \n\nMany piercers are not willing to do this piercing. The fourchette is a rare piercing which requires the proper anatomy. Many women do not have the pinchable flap of skin, making the fourchette impossible.\n\nHealing time is relatively quick, as with all piercings in the genital area. Healing time is usually around four to six weeks. Hygiene is usually a concern; with the piercing's proximity to the anus, the wearer must ensure the area is well cleaned following defecation.\n\nMany wearers have reported that this piercing is prone to stretching on its own. Discomfort with intercourse has been reported by some wearers , whereas some may find it quite pleasurable. Migration and rejection of this piercing are fairly common.\n\n"}
{"id": "1894530", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1894530", "title": "Gopalpur, Odisha", "text": "Gopalpur, Odisha\n\nGopalpur is a coastal town and a Notified Area Council on the Bay of Bengal coast in Ganjam district in the southern part of Odisha, India. Today it is a commercial port, a famous sea beach and a tourist destination around 15 km from Berhampur. The reconstruction of an all weather port including new berths is under development.\n\nAs of 2001 India census, Gopalpur had a population of 6663. Males constitute 50% of the population and females 50%. Gopalpur has an average literacy rate of 59%, lower than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 59%, and female literacy is 42%. In Gopalpur, 12% of the population is under 6 years of age.\n\nGopalpur also has an ancient, commercial port, now lying in ruins. Under the ownership of the Soraine family the village grew in wealth, from an obscure little fishing village, Gopalpur became a prominent trading port. The family built the port, the lighthouse and the Albert Hotel and established both a local fishing industry and a trade route with Burma.\n\nThey also established the bylaw allowing any villagers who could build a house, with a perimeter and light a fire in the fireplace overnight, could then keep the land and house (on the backwaters) as their own.\n\nDuring the British rule family squabbles and disputes resulted in much being transferred to British missionaries. The Albert Hotel now locked in ownership battles and lying derelict is the last remnant of those squabbles.\n\nDuring the days of British East India Company The East India Company built large warehouses and godowns because the trade with Burma had picked up and it had become a trading point for rice from Rangoon.\n\nVictor Soraine returned to India from England and built BetVic house where he retired, surrounded by memories of childhood and his family legacy. His final wish was granted when he was buried in his ancestral lands just a few years ago.\n\nGopalpur has reverted to being a quiet, relaxed place but with one major difference — it is one of India's most sought after beaches, with a distinct charm of its own.\n\nBarely 16 km away from Brahmapur, the commercial hub of southern Odisha and close to the border of Andhra Pradesh, is the tiny town of Gopalpur on the Bay of Bengal. This languorous beach with coconut groves, casuarinas and gentle sand dunes is deserted for miles.\n\nRenovated in the 1970s at the initiative of the Odisha government, the jetties were supposed to revive the trading activities of Gopalpur port. The old jetty in Gopalpur is tourist attraction point, which was a major point for trade and commerce in medieval times. The sailors of those time started their journey from this jetty to Indonesia and Rangoon across the Indian Sea. Once the renovation of new jetty completed it will become an important port of south Odisha. It's a wonderful drive-in for the people and from the beach, a vast expanse of deep blue sea and the horizon can be seen. Another thrilling sight is the long stretch of cashew nut trees. Cashew nuts are processed here and exported. A major landmark of Gopalpur-on-Sea is its lighthouse. The view from the top is splendid and one can see at a glance the entire town of Gopalpur.

The first phase of the programme (referred to as TECL I) ran from 2004 to June 2008. The second phase (TECL II) started in March 2009 and run for three years.\n\nIn South Africa the TECL I was essentially an executing agency for key elements of the national Child Labour Programme of Action, as partner to relevant government Departments, and in collaboration with organised employers, organised labour and NGOs.\n\nTECL II involves more limited programme activities with a limited set of government departments and other stakeholder.\n\nKey projects of TECL I in South Africa were four sets of pilot projects aimed at addressing work-related activities of children that are likely to affect their development detrimentally. \n\nThe pilot projects address the following three issues or groups of issues, one of which is addressed in this report:\n\nThe implementation of these pilot projects commenced in late 2005, and they were all concluded in 2007 or 2008.\n\nEducation policy and child labour\n\nResearching child labour in commercial agriculture\n\nRecent studies have shown that Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland (referred to as the BLNS Countries) all have cases of child labour, although the nature and incidence differ between the countries. See in this regard:\n\nAll these countries have ratified the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999, which identifies worst forms of child labour, including the commercial sexual exploitation of children, forced labour, children used by adults in the commission of crime, child trafficking and other forms of very hazardous work. The Convention requires of states that ratify the convention to take immediate ‘time-bound measures’ to secure the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour.\n\nThe countries have some policies and programmes in place to help eliminate child labour, but none of them as yet have comprehensive strategies to address these issues specifically. \n\nIn 2006-2008 the BLNS countries plan to put in place national Action Programmes on the Elimination of Child Labour (APECs).\nThe process is expected to involve extensive consultation with stakeholders at national level and also in the regions or districts, and is described in more detail below. It is led by the various Ministries responsible for labour and is assisted by the programme Towards the Elimination of the worst forms of Child Labour (TECL).\n\nProgramme Advisory Committees on Child Labour, representing government departments, organised labour and business, and civil society guide the development and implementation of the programme.\n\nThe \"second phase\" of the programme will involve the publication of a \"discussion document\" on child labour in these countries. It will consolidate information available on child labour in these countries and include an analysis of existing policy and identification of any possible policy gaps. \n\nThe discussion document will form the basis of a \"detailed consultation process\", the \"third phase\" of the programme. This will be on what action steps should be put in place in a concerted effort to eliminate child labour, focusing on worst forms of child labour.\n\nAfter having obtained input on suggested actions that should be taken, these proposals will be negotiated directly with the suggested implementing department. The aim will be to draw up a list of actions that will be taken, which implementing agencies have agreed to.\n\nAll these activities culminated in early 2008 in the national endorsement of Action Programmes on the Elimination of Child Labour (APEC) in Botswana, Namibia and Swaziland. Although endorsed by national forums of stakeholders, including representatives of key government ministries, these programmes are expected to be tabled at cabinet level during 2008. \n\nAdoption of the Lesotho APEC is also expected during 2008. Implementation of the action programmes will follow their adoption.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1894535", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1894535", "title": "Sleeping Dogs (film)", "text": "Sleeping Dogs (film)\n\nSleeping Dogs is a 1977 New Zealand dramatic action-thriller film, based on the book \"Smith's Dream\" by C. K. Stead, directed by Roger Donaldson, and produced by Donaldson and Larry Parr. Featuring Sam Neill, Clyde Scott and Warren Oates it is notable for being the first feature-length 35mm film produced entirely in New Zealand. The film was a major success critically and commercially and launched the career of Sam Neill, who later went on to do international works such as \"Jurassic Park\", \"The Piano\", \"Hunt for The Wilderpeople\", and \"Peaky Blinders\".\n\nA political thriller with action film elements, it follows the lead character \"Smith\" (Neill) as New Zealand plunges into a police state as a fascist government institutes martial law after industrial disputes flare into violence. Smith gets caught between the special police and a growing resistance movement and reluctantly becomes involved. Often named one of the best New Zealand films of all time, it is considered a classic and a landmark in the new wave of cinema in the country, helping to change New Zealand cinema from small, melodramatic, derivative films to the modern reels that make the country known in the industry today.\n\nFollowing the break-up of his marriage caused by his wife's affair with another man named Bullen, Smith arranges to live on the Coromandel Peninsula on an island owned by a Maori tribe. Meanwhile, political tension escalates as an oil embargo leaves the country in an energy crisis. Tension boils over into a civil war and guerrilla activity. However, Smith and his dog enjoy a peaceful island life, having little interaction with the rest of society.\n\nSmith's idyllic life is shattered when a bomb is exploded in a nearby town, and police arrive on his island to arrest him and search for illegal weapons. After they find a cache of explosives that Smith had been unaware of, he is taken to a police station where he is imprisoned, interrogated and tortured. The dog is last seen swimming after the boat that Smith is being taken away in. Smith recognizes one policeman as a former schoolmate, Jesperson, who then takes over the interrogation. Jesperson reveals that the Government regard Smith as a key leader of the guerillas and offers expulsion from New Zealand in return for a confession, or alternatively trial by a military tribunal with a likely death sentence.\n\nDuring a prison transfer, Smith deliberately forces himself to vomit to confuse his captors and escapes. He then flees the city, finding work at a small camp ground and love with a local girl. Happy to be outside the civil war again, Smith blends in until a US Army unit arrives and takes over the camp ground. Smith clashes with Willoughby, the commander of the US forces, who suspects Smith of being a rebel sympathiser. The arrival of Bullen, who is now a senior leader of the underground guerrilla movement, complicates matters further. As the US forces capture and kill more rebels, Smith is unwillingly drawn into participating in an attack on the military unit by Bullen.\n\nFleeing the scene of the successful attack, Smith and Bullen are pursued by Government forces and cornered in a nearby forest. After Government forces surround the guerrillas and bomb their encampment, Smith and Bullen escape, only to be cornered by Jesperson and his elite squad. After Bullen is fatally wounded, Smithwishing an end to what is happeningdeliberately provokes Jesperson into shooting him.\n\n\nThe scene in which Sam Neill (\"Smith\") escapes the police van and runs off into the crowded street was filmed without formal permission from the police. When Neill's stunt double ran from the van, an off-duty police officer tackled him, mistaking the stuntman for a real criminal attempting to escape custody. The stuntman had to point out the camera crew to get the officer to release him.\n\nIn the scene where Warren Oates steps out of his jeep and meets \"Smith\", he is actually holding a page of the script, fearing that he'd forget the lines. Oates acted as if the paper was a list of directions to the motel.\n\nThe riot scenes in which police with batons and shields beat back protestors closely mirrored actions of police and protestors four years later during the 1981 South African National Rugby team – the Springboks' – tour in New Zealand, which sparked anti-apartheid protests.\n\nRNZAF A-4 Skyhawks also featured in the film courtesy of the permission obtained through AVM Siegert.\n\n\n"}

It was held on July 4, 1923, in the town of Shelby, Montana, USA.\n\nIn 1922, oil was discovered in Shelby, making it the only city in northern Montana to have the material.\n\nBecause of the California economy and the influence of the Hollywood film industry, many people traveled west with dreams of becoming rich and famous. Shelby had a train service, and the town's officials thought it would be wise to try to make the city an economic and tourist center. The money would be provided by revenues that the oil found in the area would bring. Multiple bank branches had opened there since the discovery, and many families would move in, or, at least, pass by and spend their money as tourists, according to plans.\n\nThe first stage on this plan, which failed in great part because of the Dempsey vs. Gibbons fight, was to bring a fight for the world heavyweight boxing title to town. Dempsey was a member of the \"Big Five\", alongside Red Grange, Bobby Jones, Bill Tilden and Babe Ruth. Being an idol all over the United States made Dempsey an attraction. The fact that his manager, Jack Kearns, and his promoter, Tex Rickard, to whom many refer today as \" the Don King of his era\", were also famous, made city officials even more convinced that a large crowd would visit Shelby for the fight, in hopes of seeing Kearns and Rickard as well as the fight. Shelby also figured people would be attracted to running into Dempsey in town, or maybe another member of the \"Big Five\", should they make it to Montana to see the fight. There were no television networks so whoever wanted to see the fight live would have to go to Shelby.\n\nOfficials chose Tommy Gibbons, whose brother Mike was better known as a former world champion, to challenge Dempsey. But Gibbons proved the plan's first failure, as he was unknown except to boxing fans. Gibbons was strong, but not in Dempsey's level.\n\nThinking patriotism would play a part in the promotion, the city chose July 4, the United States' independence day. A large arena was built over a farm. The area is now known as \"Champion's Field\".\n\nKearns asked Shelby officials to guarantee him and the champion an advance for their traveling costs, as airplanes were available at the time but not safe, and train travel to Montana from the more populated areas of the United States took up to a week (it is said that Dempsey and Kearns took a week to get there by train). He also asked for the champion to have a guaranteed purse. So Kearns convinced Shelby to commit money or lose the fight to somewhere else.\n\nGibbons, while not a champion, was a professional and he needed money as well. He reportedly took 150,000 dollars to fight Dempsey.\n\nShelby officials, again believing they would be the beneficiaries, agreed to every demand by both boxers and their management and promotional teams. Area banks were to provide the money to stage the event. Dempsey was received at the train station by thousands of residents, which gave the city officials even more hope that the fight would be a success.\n\nThe fight was scheduled for the then almost regular distance of 15 rounds. Dempsey was considered an aggressor: He had dropped Jess Willard seven times in the first round before winning the title from Willard by stopping him in round three, retaining the title with knockouts over Bill Brennan and Georges Carpentier, among others. Because of this, the fight was thought to be a possible action bout, but instead it was quite strategic. Dempsey constantly threw punches to Gibbons' head, with Gibbons trying to attack Dempsey's body. As a consequence, Gibbons was able to duck many of Dempsey's shots. Dempsey's mobility, however, made it hard for Gibbons to punch Dempsey's stomach and ribs.\n\nThere were some isolated moments of action: Dempsey is said to have had Gibbons hurt in round seven, but he could not score a knockout. Gibbons landed hard punches to Dempsey's chin once in a while, but Dempsey shrugged the punches off. In the end, Dempsey retained the title with a 15-round unanimous decision.\n\nThe aftermath was worse than the fight for Shelby: a large arena, the size of a football field, had been built. Since most of Shelby's residents and those of nearby cities could not afford ticket prices set so that the city could come up with the money guaranteed to the participants, only 7,702 paying fans showed up, making the fight one of the biggest economical disasters in boxing history. An estimated 13,000 people got to see the fight free.\n\nFour banks in Shelby went bankrupt in the months following the fight. The town's dreams of prosperity went away with them.\n\nTaking advantage of the crowds brought to town for the boxing match, two rodeos were held. One rodeo was produced by the Knight and Day Stampede Company out of Alberta, as the Shelby Stampede and was staged in the world's largest rodeo arena. This rodeo arena was built in a circular design that had seating for 20,000 people. The Knight and Day Stampede Company was a partnership between millionaire ranchers Raymond Knight of Raymond, Alberta and Addison Day of Medicine Hat, Alberta. Another rodeo, the Marias Fair and Rodeo was held at the same time but on the other side of town. These rodeos, like the boxing match, were not financially successful. The world's largest rodeo arena was torn down after the crowds went home.\n\nA town hall building for Shelby was built in just two months in 1923 to serve as headquarters for media for the fight. The building survives and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n"}

Gaze also coached the Melbourne Tigers for 35 years, including 22 seasons in the National Basketball League (NBL), winning two league championships, in 1993 and 1997. He was the NBL Coach of the Year in 1989, 1997 and 1999, and is second all-time in the number of coaching wins in that league. Gaze is a member of the Australian Basketball Hall of Fame, as both a player and coach, and is an associate member of the Sport Australia Hall of Fame. He has also been inducted into both the FIBA Hall of Fame and the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, as a coach.\n\nGaze is the son of Albert J. Gaze and Avis M. Gaze. He has two older brothers, Barry and Tony, who is a former coach of the Australian national women's basketball team, the Opals. He married Margaret in 1962, with the couple having a daughter, Janet Gaze-Daniels (born 8 July 1964), who works in recreation management, and a son, Australian basketball legend Andrew Gaze (born 24 July 1965). As the GM of the Victorian Basketball Association (until his retirement), the Gaze family lived in the official GM's residence, which was attached to the back of the Albert Park Basketball Stadium. Gaze's nephew, Mark (Tony's son), played for Australia, under Lindsay's coaching, at the 1982 FIBA World Championship and went on to play in 182 NBL, games from 1983 to 1991. He is also the great-uncle of Mark Gaze's daughter, Kate Gaze, who played for the Canberra Capitals, in Australia's Women's National Basketball League.\n\nLindsay Gaze and his brothers were raised by his mother, after his parents separated soon after moving from Adelaide to Melbourne, in the early 1940s. As a youth, he played tennis, basketball and Australian rules football and was his school captain in tennis and football. Lindsay and Barry Gaze played in the Victorian Football Association for Prahran, and they were both selected as members of an Australian rules team that played an exhibition match during the 1956 Melbourne Summer Olympics, although Lindsay didn't take the field.\n\nIt was in basketball that Gaze would make his mark in the Summer Olympic Games. In 1958, he chose to pursue a career in basketball, rather than football (and a promising engineering career) and although still playing, became the first full time basketball administrator of the Victorian Basketball Association, accepting the position of General Manager. Lindsay Gaze held the position until his retirement in 2005, during which time the number of registered players in Victoria rose from around 2,000 in 1958 to over 200,000.\n\nHe was selected for the senior Australian basketball team for the 1960 Bologna Pre-Olympic Tournament, which was the first Australian basketball team to travel overseas to compete for a place at the Summer Olympics. Gaze soon established himself as one of Australia's leading basketball players, establishing an international reputation, when he was selected as a member of the All-Star Five at the 1962 Philippines Invitational Basketball Tournament.\n\nGaze represented Australia during the 1960 Bologna, 1964 Yokohama, and 1968 Monterrey Summer Olympics world qualification tournaments, but Australia only qualified to compete at the 1964 Games. He developed a reputation as a fanatical trainer, training two or three times a week with his club and at home. Gaze also coached the Australian national under-16 and under-18 squads, during his playing career.\n\nHis reputation for training led to his appointment as a coach of the Melbourne Tigers (MBA) in 1970, and also of the senior men's Australian basketball side in 1971, which he went on to coach at four Summer Olympic Games, in 1972, 1976, 1980 and 1984.

{"id": "1894570", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1894570", "title": "Metroid Prime Pinball", "text": "Metroid Prime Pinball\n\nMetroid Prime Pinball is a pinball video game themed after the \"Metroid\" series. The game uses the graphical style and various story elements from \"Metroid Prime\". It was developed by Fuse Games for the Nintendo DS handheld game console, and released by Nintendo in North America and Australia in 2005, in Japan in 2006, and in Europe in 2007. \"Metroid Prime Pinball\" uses the basic mechanics of pinball, along with typical pinball items. New mechanics are introduced, such as wall jumping and the ability to fire weapons. The Nintendo DS's touchscreen can be nudged with a finger to alter the pinball's trajectory while in motion.\n\nThe initial idea for a video game that presented the \"Metroid\" series in a pinball setting came to Kensuke Tanabe after he learned that Fuse Games had previously worked on \"Mario Pinball Land\", another pinball video game. Recalling that the series' protagonist, Samus, can morph into a ball, Tanabe was convinced that the \"Metroid\" universe could be adapted to a pinball setting. The game was sold with a Rumble Pak accessory for the Nintendo DS, marking the first time the accessory was available for the Nintendo DS.\n\n\"Metroid Prime Pinball\" received generally positive reviews. Critics praised the game's transposition of the \"Metroid\" series into a pinball video game, but criticized its lack of variety. \"Metroid Prime Pinball\" sold 6,228 copies during its debut month of October 2005 in the United States, and over 15,000 units in Japan as of May 2008.\n\n\"Metroid Prime Pinball\" uses the basic mechanics of pinball, complete with an assortment of typical pinball items including flippers, spinners, bumpers, and ramps. In addition, new mechanics are introduced, such as enemies that wander around the table, wall jumping, and the ability to fire weapons. The Nintendo DS's touchscreen can be used to nudge the pinball table and alter the ball's trajectory. The game consists of six pinball tables, each inspired by a different area of \"Metroid Prime\". Each table is shown across both screens of the Nintendo DS. Only two tables are initially available for play: Pirate Frigate and Tallon Overworld. After playing either of the first two tables, the player unlocks two more tables: Phendrana Drifts and Phazon Mines. In either table, the player must battle a boss to complete it.\n\nDuring the course of the game, the player must acquire twelve Artifacts, which are prizes that are awarded after completing objectives such as winning minigames or beating bosses. Once having acquired twelve Artifacts, the player is granted access to a table called the Artifact Temple, which places six balls on the table at the same time. To complete the table, twelve different targets must be hit with the balls while they are bombarded by attacks from Meta Ridley, one of the antagonists of the \"Metroid Prime\" series. If all of the balls are lost, the table ends; the player does not lose any of the twelve Artifacts already collected but is forced to revisit another table and complete it before being allowed a second attempt at the Artifact Temple. Upon completing the Artifact Temple, access is granted to the final table, Impact Crater. After the player defeats the Metroid Prime creature on the Impact Crater table, the game unlocks a higher difficulty level, Expert mode.\n\nThe game also features a \"Single Mission\" mode which confines players to a single board. The Pirate Frigate and Tallon Overworld boards challenge players to earn a high point score, as in real pinball; on the other tables players are ranked by the time taken to complete a mission. In addition to the single-player mode, the game features a multiplayer mode, which requires only one copy of the game and allows up to eight players to compete in a race to reach a target score. The mode uses a seventh table, Magmoor Caverns, that does not appear in the single-player mode.\n\nWhile making \"Metroid Prime Hunters\", a \"Metroid\" first-person shooter video game for the Nintendo DS, Nintendo producer Kensuke Tanabe came up with the idea to make a pinball game based on the \"Metroid\" series as Fuse Games finished \"Mario Pinball Land\", another pinball simulator based on a Nintendo property. Tanabe felt like the \"Metroid\" universe fit into such a setting due to series protagonist Samus being able to morph into a ball, and Fuse agreed that the license was \"a great fit for pinball\", accepting to work on the game. Fuse Games then received some assets from \"Metroid Prime\" developers Retro Studios, and collaborated with the \"Hunters\" team at Nintendo Software Technology to elaborate on specific aspects of \"Metroid Prime Pinball\", such as Samus's wall climbing and shooting abilities. Head of development Adrian Barritt said that in \"Metroid Prime Pinball\" the team tried to fix criticisms raised about the difficulty of \"Mario Pinball Land\", creating a \"more beginner friendly\" game.\n\nNamed \"Project Code: Metroid Pinball\" while in development, the first gameplay footage from the game was released on May 17, 2005 at the E3 convention. Nintendo of America revealed on August 22, 2005 that the game, by then titled \"Metroid Prime Pinball\", would be sold with the Rumble Pak accessory, which can be plugged into the Game Boy Advance slot of the Nintendo DS. When the Rumble Pak is installed, the Nintendo DS shakes whenever the pinball in the game hits an object. This was the first time that the Nintendo DS version of the Rumble Pak was introduced. It was first sold exclusively with \"Metroid Prime Pinball\" before becoming available as a standalone product from Nintendo.\n\nNintendo DS games that use the device's top and bottom screens as one continuous screen are harder to control because of a gap in the middle, sometimes called a visual \"dead zone\"; objects in this area are not visible. The developers of \"Metroid Prime Pinball\", a game which takes advantage of both screens, resolved this problem by placing a second set of pinball flippers at the bottom of the upper screen to give players a reference to work with. The tabletops in the game use pre-rendered artwork for graphical effects, including Samus's Morph Ball, which uses renderings of images at several different angles to provide a smooth animation. To simulate the appearance of a real pinball game from a player's point of view, the tabletop in \"Metroid Prime Pinball\" was tipped back. The game offers players the ability to nudge the table, a technique used in pinball games to influence the ball's movement. This is achieved by touching the Nintendo DS's bottom touchscreen with a finger and pushing it in the direction that the player wants to nudge the tabletop. The game's soundtrack was composed by Kenji Yamamoto and Masaru Tajima, with audio effects from the \"Metroid Prime\" series are borrowed by the game to provide a \"CD-like\" music experience. The voice of the Power Suit was provided by Lorelei King.\n\n\"Metroid Prime Pinball\" was released by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS in North America on October 24, 2005, in Australia on December 1, in Japan on January 19, 2006, and in Europe on June 22, 2007. 6,228 copies were sold during its debut month of October 2005 in the United States, and over 15,000 units were sold in Japan as of May 2008.\n\nIt was given \"generally favorable reviews\", according to the review aggregator website Metacritic. Despite early skepticism over the quality of a pinball video game themed after the \"Metroid\" series, reviews praised the integration of the two in \"Metroid Prime Pinball\". \"Nintendo Power\" called the game a \"fully realized and well-tuned hybrid of pinball play and Metroid Prime atmosphere\", and the \"Official Nintendo Magazine\" named it one of the better recently released pinball games. GameZone believed that the game appeals to anyone who is a fan of pinball games or the \"Metroid Prime\" franchise, to which \"Play\" magazine attested, adding that the game embodies the \"Metroid Prime\" series well.\n\nAppreciating the game's pinball gameplay, 1UP.com thought that its \"Metroid\" motif did not add much more to the game. Nintendo World Report felt differently; they were impressed with the game's \"top-notch graphics and sound that believably invoke the \"Metroid\" series\". They also appreciated the pinball innovations introduced in the game that incorporate features from the series, concluding, \"This game really does feel like a seamless, if unlikely, merging between classic arcade pinball and the creepy-cool Metroid Prime series.\" The sentiment was shared by GameSpot's Greg Kasavin, who was convinced that pinball was an excellent medium to simulate the challenging struggles found in the \"Metroid\" series, noting that the game \"pulls it off very well\" by being faithful to the main series. Bryn Williams of GameSpy was impressed after playing the game; he noted that it was one of the more interesting gaming sessions that anyone can have on the Nintendo DS. \"Metroid Prime Pinball\"s gameplay was lauded by reviewers. Craig Harris of IGN appreciated Fuse Games' work on the game, praising the graphics, audio, and gameplay, along with its \"pick-up-and-play\" element that made it easy for people with varying levels of skill to play. X-Play felt the same way, noting that the simple controls and \"short bursts of gameplay\" make \"Metroid Prime Pinball\" a perfect handheld video game. In addition, they asserted that the game has great value because of the included wireless multiplayer mode, which allows up to eight players to play the game with just one game card.\n\nA few critics were negative about \"Metroid Prime Pinball\". The reviewer from the \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" video game magazine found it hard to see the pinball while playing the game, especially when it was in the area between the top and bottom Nintendo DS screens. With a limited selection of game modes, \"GamePro\"s Rice Burner was disappointed with the game, and concluded that because every game mode features the same tabletops, \"Metroid Prime Pinball\" lacked variety, which \"Game Informer\"s reviewer agreed with, noting that he would have had more fun with the game if he \"had access to a little more content\". The minigames were criticized by Game Revolution, which claimed that there were too many minigames that were only of average quality. Furthermore, it asked the game's developer, Fuse Games, to spend more time making a great pinball game rather than several minor minigames, requesting \"a character-based game that's great at pinball rather than a fence-riding jack of all trades that is master of none\". Eurogamer had a different experience, finding that the minigames provided more entertainment than the main game, which they remarked was a \"cardinal sin in pinball\". They also criticized the tilt feature for being unintuitive and difficult to use. The reviewer for GamesMaster felt that \"Metroid Prime Pinball\" was directed more towards \"Metroid\" fans than pinball aficionados, calling it a \"flashy but insipid\" game.\n\n"}

It is based on the interaction of an external field with the electric dipole moment of the sample, often expressed by permittivity.\n\nIt is also an experimental method of characterizing electrochemical systems. This technique measures the impedance of a system over a range of frequencies, and therefore the frequency response of the system, including the energy storage and dissipation properties, is revealed. Often, data obtained by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is expressed graphically in a Bode plot or a Nyquist plot.\n\nImpedance is the opposition to the flow of alternating current (AC) in a complex system. A passive complex electrical system comprises both energy dissipater (resistor) and energy storage (capacitor) elements. If the system is purely resistive, then the opposition to AC or direct current (DC) is simply resistance. Materials or systems exhibiting multiple phases (such as composites or heterogeneous materials) commonly show a universal dielectric response, whereby dielectric spectroscopy reveals a power law relationship between the impedance (or the inverse term, admittance) and the frequency, ω, of the applied AC field.\n\nAlmost any physico-chemical system, such as electrochemical cells, mass-beam oscillators, and even biological tissue possesses energy storage and dissipation properties. EIS examines them.\n\nThis technique has grown tremendously in stature over the past few years and is now being widely employed in a wide variety of scientific fields such as fuel cell testing, biomolecular interaction, and microstructural characterization. Often, EIS reveals information about the reaction mechanism of an electrochemical process: different reaction steps will dominate at certain frequencies, and the frequency response shown by EIS can help identify the rate limiting step.\n\nThere are a number of different dielectric mechanisms, connected to the way a studied medium reacts to the applied field (see the figure illustration). Each dielectric mechanism is centered around its characteristic frequency, which is the reciprocal of the characteristic time of the process. In general, dielectric mechanisms can be divided into relaxation and resonance processes. The most common, starting from high frequencies, are:\n\nThis resonant process occurs in a neutral atom when the electric field displaces the electron density relative to the nucleus it surrounds.\n\nThis displacement occurs due to the equilibrium between restoration and electric forces.\nElectronic polarization may be understood by assuming an atom as a point nucleus surrounded by spherical electron cloud of uniform charge density.\n\nAtomic polarization is observed when the nucleus of the atom reorients in response to the electric field. This is a resonant process. Atomic polarization is intrinsic to the nature of the atom and is a consequence of an applied field. Electronic polarization refers to the electron density and is a consequence of an applied field. Atomic polarization is usually small compared to electronic polarization.\n\nThis originates from permanent and induced dipoles aligning to an electric field. Their orientation polarisation is disturbed by thermal noise (which mis-aligns the dipole vectors from the direction of the field), and the time needed for dipoles to relax is determined by the local viscosity. These two facts make dipole relaxation heavily dependent on temperature, pressure, and chemical surrounding.\n\nIonic relaxation comprises ionic conductivity and interfacial and space charge relaxation. Ionic conductivity predominates at low frequencies and introduces only losses to the system. Interfacial relaxation occurs when charge carriers are trapped at interfaces of heterogeneous systems. A related effect is Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars polarization, where charge carriers blocked at inner dielectric boundary layers (on the mesoscopic scale) or external electrodes (on a macroscopic scale) lead to a separation of charges. The charges may be separated by a considerable distance and therefore make contributions to the dielectric loss that are orders of magnitude larger than the response due to molecular fluctuations.\n\nDielectric relaxation as a whole is the result of the movement of dipoles (dipole relaxation) and electric charges (ionic relaxation) due to an applied alternating field, and is usually observed in the frequency range 10-10 Hz. Relaxation mechanisms are relatively slow compared to resonant electronic transitions or molecular vibrations, which usually have frequencies above 10 Hz.\n\nFor a redox reaction\nR formula_1 O + e, without mass-transfer limitation, the relationship between the current density and the electrode overpotential is given by the Butler–Volmer equation:\n\nwith\n\nThe curve formula_7 is not a straight line (Fig. 1), therefore a redox reaction is not a linear system.\n\nIn an electrochemical cell the faradaic impedance of an electrolyte-electrode interface is the joint electrical resistance and capacitance at that interface.\n\nLet us suppose that the Butler-Volmer relationship correctly describes the dynamic behavior of the redox reaction:\n\nDynamic behavior of the redox reaction is characterized by the so-called charge transfer resistance defined by:\n\nThe value of the charge transfer resistance changes with the overpotential. For this simplest example the faradaic impedance is reduced to a resistance. It is worthwhile to notice that:\nfor formula_11.\n\nAn electrode formula_12 electrolyte interface behaves like a capacitance called electrochemical double-layer capacitance formula_13. The equivalent circuit for the redox reaction in Fig. 2 includes the double-layer capacitance as well as the charge transfer resistance. Another analog circuit commonly used to model the electrochemical double-layer is called a constant phase element.\n\nThe electrical impedance of this circuit is easily obtained remembering the impedance of a capacitance which is given by:\nwhere formula_15 is the angular frequency of a sinusoidal signal (rad/s), and formula_16.\n\nIt is obtained:\n\nNyquist diagram of the impedance of the circuit shown in Fig. 3 is a semicircle with a diameter formula_18 and an angular frequency at the apex equal to formula_19 (Fig. 3). Other representations, Bode plots, or Black plans can be used.\n\nThe ohmic resistance formula_20 appears in series with the electrode impedance of the reaction and the Nyquist diagram is translated to the right.\n\nUnder AC conditions with varying frequency ω, heterogeneous systems and composite materials exhibit a universal dielectric response, in which overall admittance exhibits a region of power law scaling with frequency. formula_21. \n\nPlotting the Nyquist diagram with a potentiostat and an impedance analyzer, most often included in modern potentiostats, allows the user to determine charge transfer resistance, double layer capacitance and ohmic resistance. The exchange current density formula_4 can be easily determined measuring the impedance of a redox reaction for formula_23.\n\nNyquist diagrams are made of several arcs for reactions more complex than redox reactions and with mass-transfer limitations.\n\nElectrochemical impedance spectroscopy is used in a wide range of applications.\n\nIn the paint and coatings industry, it is a useful tool to investigate the quality of coatings and to detect the presence of corrosion.\n\nIt is used in many biosensor systems as a label-free technique to measure bacterial concentration and to detect dangerous pathogens such as Escherichia Coli O157:H7 and Salmonella, and yeast cells.\n\nElectrochemical impedance spectroscopy is also used to analyze and characterize different food products. Some examples are the assessment of food–package interactions, the analysis of milk composition, the characterization and the determination of the freezing end-point of ice-cream mixes, the measure of meat ageing, the investigation of ripeness and quality in fruits and the determination of free acidity in olive oil.\n\nIn the field of human health monitoring is better known as bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and is used to estimate body composition as well as different parameters such as total body water and free fat mass.\n\nElectrochemical impedance spectroscopy can be used to obtain the frequency response of batteries.\n\nBiomedical sensors working in the microwave range relies on dielectric spectroscopy to detect changes in the dielectric properties over a frequency range. The IFAC database can be used as a resource to get the dielectric properties for human body tissues.\n\n"}

{"id": "1894607", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1894607", "title": "Rules of the road in China", "text": "Rules of the road in China\n\nTraffic law in China is still in its nascent stage (see Road Traffic Safety Law of the People's Republic of China). Therefore, the rules of the road in China are understood to mean both the codified and uncodified practices, procedures and norms of behavior generally followed by motorists, cyclists and pedestrians in the mainland of China.\n\nThe first traffic regulations for China went into effect on August 6, 1955. 59 articles formed the \"City Traffic Regulations\" (), promulgated by the Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China. It was vague and terse, however, and punishments for violators were relatively light.\n\nIn 1988 the regulations were revisited, but the result was still a traffic \"administrative regulation\" (中华人民共和国道路交通管理条例). There still was no \"law\" to control traffic.\n\nThe first expressway traffic regulations surfaced on March 26, 1990, under the title \"Interim Regulations for Expressways\". These were strengthened later on in the 1990s, when a new regulation (albeit temporary) took effect, banning \"new drivers\" (PRC licence holders for less than a year) from the expressways.\n\nThe Road Traffic Safety Law of the People's Republic of China represented a huge breakthrough. It instituted higher fines, compulsory vehicle insurance, and a point system for penalties, among other reforms. The bill was passed with Hu Jintao in power in late October 2003 and took effect on all of mainland China on May 1, 2004.\n\nExcept for a brief period during the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976) when the government encouraged people to drive on the left (for symbolic/ideological reasons), the convention has been to drive on the right. In practice, however, driving to the left into oncoming traffic is not uncommon in China, nor is it as stigmatized and penalized as it is in other countries. This is especially true of bicyclists, electric bicycles, and motorcycles who—unless physically prevented by barriers—are almost equally likely to be found riding on the right, left or straight down the middle of lanes of traffic.\n\nRight-of-way (Simplified Chinese: 先行权, Pinyin: xiānxíngquán, \"Lit: “first go rights\"”) is defined as such in all Chinese dictionaries, however, most Chinese drivers’ understanding of this concept is markedly different from those in societies with a strong tradition of the rule of law. Compared to the western understanding of right-of-way, which refers to the legal right to proceed forward in a vehicle without fear of being found at fault for causing a collision, right-of-way in China means, for all intents and purposes, that the person who is in the way (first) has the right unless road signs otherwise dictate. In practice, this translates into motorists and cyclists turning or merging straight into the path of other traffic believing that the onus is on the other person to avoid a collision. \n\nWhen the right-of-way is unclear (such as at unmarked intersections) it is common practice for drivers in many parts of the world to make eye contact with each other and use nods or hand gestures to either exert or defer right-of-way. The opposite applies in China, where people actively avoid eye contact, and in fact \"turn away\" from the person whose progress they are impeding so as to communicate their intention to proceed regardless. \n\nGiven the relatively recent introduction of a law technically requiring motorists to stop at a red light, it is not surprising that drivers frequently disregard traffic lights and proceed on red. The frequency of this occurrence varies according to time and place. A crowded intersection at midday with police presence results in drivers diligently observing the law, while a desolate intersection at 1 A.M. is sure to witness cars and trucks speeding through red lights without pause.\n\nPedestrians are especially in a difficult situation. In cities such as Beijing, new \"self-service\" traffic lights provide pedestrians with easy access across the road—just push a button, wait, and go when the light changes. Unfortunately, unless these traffic lights come with supervising cameras connected to the police, some drivers are likely to pass through these as well, making the pedestrian buttons rather pointless.\n\nCrossings with no camera of any kind are likely to have chaotic traffic, as neither police nor technology are present to enforce the law.\n\nA substantial change in the new Road Traffic Safety Law of the People's Republic of China is a new requirement which forces drivers to stop at red lights even if there is a crossing only to the left (no crossing to the right), thereby outlawing straight-ahead at red lights that was permitted at an intersection with no crossing to the right. Drivers, however, still can turn right at red lights, unless signs prohibit this.\n\nFinally, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, some battalions of Red Guards would gather at traffic lights, forcing drivers to stop at the green light and go once it had turned red – supposedly because red was the colour of Communism. Due to some traffic light systems being unmanned, drivers at these crossings would often go at the green light – causing collisions where a neighboring lights system was hijacked and all the drivers were going at red. Officially, the idea of \"Red lights mean go\" was never adopted by the regime.\n\nA long-standing tenet has been for the larger vehicle involved in a collision to assume responsibility, e.g., if a car collides with a bicycle the car driver is at fault. If a bicycle and pedestrian collide it is the bicyclist's fault. Practically, this understanding emboldens pedestrians and cyclists to take liberties with cars and trucks, impeding their progress by moving into the flow of traffic under the assumption that larger vehicles will give way. This notwithstanding, the incidence of vehicle-pedestrian collisions is on the decline, despite the fact that the new Road Traffic Safety Law of the People's Republic of China allows for only one case in which drivers are not at fault for hitting a pedestrian—that is, if the pedestrian purposely violates traffic laws.\n\nIn highly regulated cities, that employ thousands of traffic cameras and facial recognition technology, drivers are highly considerate to pedestrians. In crosswalks without traffic lights, drivers will come to a stop for pedestrians. Besides government-led enforcement measures, a report-for-reward program exists whereby persons reporting traffic offences will receive a reward upon successful conviction (often 20-100 CNY). Given high proliferation of smartphones, reporting rates are high. In most towns and cities without much oversight, very few drivers will slow down when approaching a pedestrian crossing. Even fewer will actually stop for pedestrians waiting to pass by.\n\nRoad rage is uncommon in China. This is possibly due the fact that Chinese motorists have fewer expectations that other drivers will offer to \"give way\" and have a less legalistic/absolute view of traffic procedures. Road rage is not completely absent, however. A few cases have been witnessed in Beijing: they include assault with golf clubs, car chases and the like. Sometimes the police will intervene; those who commit extreme physical assault can often expect to be prosecuted criminally. In compliance with the Chinese criminal code, a case of road rage resulting in death will often see the offender receive the death penalty. A recent example was the Yao Jiaxin murder case.\n\nOfficially, all traffic collisions must be reported to the police. Exempt are cases where only minor damage was done to the vehicle, with nobody hurt, injured or killed. Cases of self-damage (e.g., driving into a tree) officially need to be reported to the police, but in reality, few people bother. This, however, indicates a waiver of responsibility for the insurance company.\n\nWhen a collision occurs between two vehicles it is almost always resolved by the payment of money by one party to the other on the spot, with or without any admission of fault. After initial indignation or recalcitrance, one or both parties will demand financial compensation. It is supposed that either party considers the socio-economic status and occupation of the other, and the desirability of saving face. Eventually one party will relent, and they will bargain down to an agreeable amount of compensation.\n\nAnother feature of a traffic collision in China is that in many cases, neither party will move their vehicle from the position that it came to rest following the collision, regardless of its effect on the flow of traffic. It is a justifiable fear of many Chinese motorists not to move their vehicle from the scene of a collision because recent traffic law changes have provided for hefty penalties in the event of a hit-and-run. A driver found guilty of hit-and-run forfeits his or her license for life, and any party to a collision who flees the scene is subject to severe sanctions.\n\nA vehicle with a government or military plate are not subject to the \"Road Traffic Safety Law of the People's Republic of China\" (中华人民共和国道路交通安全法); they may run red lights, drive in the wrong direction or weave in and out of traffic. Communist party officials and People's Liberation Army members are also exempt from paying road tolls and adhering to parking regulations. According to Xinhua News Agency, \"police officers are also reluctant to pull over drivers of military vehicles even if the drivers are breaking the law\", which is the reason behind an emerging trend where individuals purchase counterfeit military registration plates to avoid being pulled over by police. Xinhua reported in 2008 that since July 2006, over 4,000 fake military vehicles and 6,300 fake plates have been confiscated, and criminal gangs involving 5,000 people have been apprehended; under Chinese law, those caught driving under fake registration plates are fined up to 2,000 RMB, and counterfeiters can be jailed for up to three years.\n"}

{"id": "1894640", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1894640", "title": "Avenue Foch", "text": "Avenue Foch\n\nAvenue Foch () is an avenue in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, France, named after World War I Marshal Ferdinand Foch in 1929. It is one of the most prestigious streets in Paris, and one of the most expensive addresses in the world, home to many grand palaces, including ones belonging to the Onassis and Rothschild families. The Rothschilds once owned numbers 19-21.\nThe avenue runs from the Arc de Triomphe southwest to the Porte Dauphine at the edge of the Bois de Boulogne city park. It is the widest avenue in Paris and is lined with chestnut trees along its full length.\n\nThe Avenue was constructed during the reign of Emperor Napoleon III, as part of the grand plan for the reconstruction of Paris conducted by Napoleon's Prefect of the Seine, Baron Haussmann. It was designed to connect the Place d'Etoile with another important part of Haussmann's plan, the Bois de Boulogne, the new public park on the west end of the city. The original plan, by Jacques Hittorff, who had designed the Place de la Concorde decades earlier, called for an avenue forty meters wide between the modern Avenue Victor Hugo and the modern Avenue de la Grand Armée. Haussmann scrapped this plan and instead called for an avenue at least one hundred meters wide, wider than the Champs-Elysées between the Arc de Triomphe and the new Bois de Boulogne. Its purpose was to provide an impressive grand approach for fashionable Parisians to promenade from the center of the city to the Park in their carriages, to see and be seen. It was to be called the Avenue de l'Impératrice, the Avenue of the Empress, for the Empress Eugenie, the wife of Napoleon III.\n\nThe Avenue was built by Jean-Charles Alphand, the chief engineer of the Service of Promenades and Plantations of Paris, who also designed the Bois de Boulogne, the Bois de Vincennes, Parc Monceau, the Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, and other parks and squares built by Napoleon III. The iron fences and lamps were designed by the architect Gabriel Davioud, who designed all the distinctive ornamental park architecture of Paris during the period, from fountains and temples to gates and fences. The final design consisted of a central avenue one hundred twenty meters wide and 1300 meters long, flanked by sidewalks for pedestrians, riding paths for horsemen, and crisscrossing alleys, shaded by rows of chestnut trees and decorated along its full length by ornamental lawns and gardens with exotic flowers and plants. It was, in fact, an extension of the Bois de Boulogne, and connected directly with the avenues and paths of the park.\n\nIt opened in 1854, was immediately popular with Parisians, but it did not keep its name for long. After the downfall of Napoleon III in 1870, the name was changed from Avenue de l'Impératrice to avenue du Général-Uhrich, and then 1875 to Avenue du Bois de Boulogne. It was changed again in 1929 to Avenue Foch, after the hero of the First World War, who died in that year.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the street was nicknamed « avenue Boche » by the Parisians (\"Boche\" being a slang word for \"German\"). The headquarters of the Gestapo was located for a time at number 72, and the office of Section IV B4 of the Gestapo, the Juden Referat, which was responsible for the arrest and deportation of French Jews to the concentration camps, had its office at 31 bis Avenue Foch. British agent Peter Churchill was tortured on the fifth floor of number 84. He survived the war.\n\nThe gardens of Avenue Foch occupy a space of 6.62 hectares, in the space 1200 meters long and 140 meters wide. In addition to the four thousand trees that line that avenue, the garden was originally planted with 2,400 different species of trees and plants, making it, as Alphand wrote, \"a kind of arboretum.\" Many of the original trees can still be found in the gardens, including a chestnut tree from India, 4.7 meters in circumference; from 1852, an elm tree from Siberia, 3.8 meters in circumference (1852); and a giant Catalpa tree 3.5 meters in circumference (1852).\n\nThe gardens contain a monument to their creator, Jean-Charles Alphand, designed by architect Jules Formigé, with sculpture by Jules Dalou. The monument was dedicated 14 December 1899.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1894644", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1894644", "title": "Petter Dass", "text": "Petter Dass\n\nPetter Pettersen Dass (c. 1647 – 17 August 1707) was a Lutheran priest and the foremost Norwegian poet of his generation, writing both baroque hymns and topographical poetry.\n\nHe was born at Northern Herøy (Dønna), Nordland, Norway. His father was a merchant originally from Dundee, Scotland, Peter Dundas who had established himself as a trader along the northern Norwegian coast. His mother was Maren Falch (1629–1709) whose father had been the local bailiff, a large land owner in Helgeland and manager for the Dønnes estate of Henrik Rantzau. His father died in 1653, when Petter was 6, and the children were cared for by relatives and friends. His mother remarried, but Petter remained with his mother's sister, Anna Falck, who was married to the priest at Nærøy.\n\nAt 13, Petter began attending school in Bergen, and later studied theology at the University of Copenhagen. He was lonely during his years in Copenhagen, but intellectually stimulated. After his years in Copenhagen, he returned to Norway and became a tutor in Vefsn. He fathered a child out of wedlock, and had to travel to Copenhagen and seek pardon from the Danish king. In 1689, he was appointed parish priest at Alstahaug Church. His parish was quite large covering an area which included the villages of Hattfjelldal, Vevelstad, Leirfjord, Vefsn, Herøy, Dønna, Nesna, Hemnes and Rana.\n\nHe was also a writer of texts and hymns. Most of his writings were not published until after his death. His most famous work is the versified topographical description of northern Norway, \"Nordlands Trompet\" (\"The Trumpet of Nordland\"), and some psalms still in use, most prominently \"Herre Gud, ditt dyre navn og ære\" (\"Good Lord, thy precious name and glory\"). In the Faroe Islands, which were Norwegian until 1814, his Bibelsk Viise-Bog and Katechismus-Sange have continued to be used among folk singers until the last decades of the 20th century.\n\nThe only existing portrait of Petter Dass is traditionally believed to be one found in the Melhus church in Norway. However, the claim is hotly disputed, with some historians who studied the painting concluding that Dass is most likely not the subject. Several modern statues and bust of Petter Dass have been erected in Norway, including a bas-relief by Norwegian sculptor Ambrosia Theodora Tønnesen (1859-1948) at the Bergen Cathedral. The community of Sandnessjøen has a modern statue of Petter Dass located prominently in the town centre.\n\nPetter Dass was deeply mourned after his death, and many fishing vessels of Northern Norway carried a black cloth in their sail for 100 years after his death, as a sign of mourning. He is still the subject of folklore of Nordland. There is, for example, a legend of how he fooled the devil to carry him to Copenhagen to preach for the king.\n\nPetter Dass Chapel (\"Petter Dass-kapellet\") is located in Husøya, the administrative centre of Træna municipality, in Nordland county, Norway. The chapel was opened on 28 June 1997 as a memorial of Petter Dass.\n\nPetter Dass Prize (\"Petter Dass-prisen\") is an annual award extended by the Norwegian newspaper \"Vårt Land\". the prize was first granted during 1995. It is awarded in recognition of a person or organization that has helped to put the Christian faith on the agenda in society.\n\nThe Petter Dass Medal (\"Petter Dass medaljen\") is an award given annually by Nordlændingernes Forening in Oslo to people from Northern Norway that have distinguished themselves in their work for the region's development. The society is a fraternal association of people that have emigrated from the counties of Nordland, Troms, and Finnmark. Nordlændingernes Forening was founded by the Norwegian educator, clergyman, and engineer Ole Tobias Olsen (18 August 1830 – 6 July 1924) and the Norwegian theologian and hymn writer Elias Blix. In honor of the society's 50th anniversary in 1912, a commemorative medal was first established in memory of Petter Dass.\n\nThe Petter Dass Museum (\"Petter Dass-museet\") in Alstahaug municipality in Nordland county, Norway was established in 1966 and is currently a division of Helgeland Museum. The opening of the new museum building took place during Autumn 2007, 300 years after the death of Petter Dass. The facility inspires the teaching, research, artistic creative work, study and contemplation, and dialogue about culture and values. Since 1983, Petter Dass has also been honored with the traditional Petter Dass days at Alstahaug.\n\nNoted Norwegian Classical songwriter Edvard Grieg included the words of Petter Dass in his composition \"Fisherman's Song\" (\"Fiskervise\". 1894) from 7 Barnlige Sange, Op.61. More recently Norwegian folk singer, Jack Berntsen has written songs based on poems by Petter Dass and Norwegian playwright Lars Berg wrote the play \"Petter Dass\" (1967). \"Mit navn er Petter Dass\", a music album published in 2008 with lyrics by Petter Dass, was written by Kari Bremnes with her brothers Lars and Ola.\n\n\n\n"}

Mel and Sue gained widespread popularity in March 1997 when they launched a lunchtime chat show on Channel 4, \"Light Lunch\", where celebrity chefs cooked lunch for the duo's celebrity guests. The show returned for a second series in 1998.\n\n1998-1999 The duo moved to a more prime-time evening slot and the show was renamed \"Late Lunch\".\n\nIn 1999, Mel and Sue were signed by ITV and hosted a comedy panel game for the network called \"Casting Couch\", in a prime late evening slot, but it fared poorly in the ratings and was not recommissioned after its initial 6-episode run. ITV created Casting Couch as a vehicle to showcase Mel and Sue's comedic talents as a duo. In each episode, the pair form two teams under the guidance of team captains Chris Moyles and Tamara Beckwith, with regular guest celebrities Marcus Brigstocke and Kevin Day, and two guest celebrities.\n\nMel and Sue were announced as new co-presenters on Channel 4's \"\" breakfast TV show in January 2003. The pair appeared together again with Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders in a French & Saunders \"Mamma Mia\" comedy sketch for Comic Relief in 2009. The double-act was less active in this period, while Mel had children.\n\nPerkins confirmed on \"Friday Night with Jonathan Ross\" that the duo would be working together on something new in 2010. Their new show, a baking competition series, \"The Great British Bake Off\", ran for six years on the BBC. It began on BBC Two in August 2010, and after four series it was moved to BBC One for its fifth series in 2014 and a sixth in 2015. On Richard Herring's Leicester Square Theatre Podcast in 2015, Perkins said she had been reluctant to work on Bake Off, but agreed on the condition that the BBC offered Mel the chance to share the presenting role.\n\nIn January 2015, Mel and Sue launched a new ITV daytime chat show called \"Mel and Sue\", the show features appearances from celebrity guests, audience interaction and cookery, this time with members of the public being nominated to appear as the guest chef.\n\nIn September 2016, when it was announced that \"The Great British Bake Off\" would be moving to Channel 4 in 2017, Mel and Sue said that they would not be a part of the channel move and be stepping down as hosts of the show after the 7th edition.\n\nIn October 2016, it was confirmed that Mel and Sue would become the presenters of \"Let's Sing and Dance for Comic Relief\" for BBC One in March 2017. On 23 July 2017, it was confirmed that Mel and Sue would host a new version of \"The Generation Game\" for BBC One.\n\nMel and Sue's paired radio credits began with appearances by Mel on Sue's BBC Radio 4 comedy panel show series The 99p Challenge in 2000, then in 2002 they made a show for BBC Radio 2 titled \"Mel And Sue's Comedy Breakdown\", a six-part series exploring the best of comedy, and BBC Radio 4's, \"The Mel and Sue Thing\", a six-part series that also aired in 2002 and was later released on BBC CD.\n\nTheir first show at Edinburgh Fringe was in 1993 and it was called \"Naked Brunch\" according to the Telegraph and \"Naked Lunch\" according to the Independent. In 1994 Mel and Sue performed a show at Edinburgh called \"Kittens Go Grrrrr\" and in 1996 their show was called \"Planet Pussycat\". Their style was noted by The Independent as character comedy. As well as performing live as a duo in their early stand-up days, Mel and Sue embarked on a UK national tour from 1995 - 1996. When they appeared on Room 101 together, one of their choices was one of their dates from this tour - in Leighton Buzzard. They chose this because of the fact that they had a such a bad audience there. \nOnce their television career was in full swing, in April and May 1999 they toured the country again with their show, \"Mel & Sue: Back to Our Routes\" which was \"a hilarious stage show that captures the submersive brilliance of their smash-hit TV show\" according to the show's promotional material. One reviewer remarked: \"Mel and Sue on stage is virtually the same as the TV incarnation, except they don't have any guests.\"\n\n"}

On 9 April 1981 he fatally stabbed his mother Maria 32 times, and his father, a police officer, who had refused to lend him their car. He hid their bodies in the bathtub covered in water and lime to delay the discovery of the murders and fled with his father's service pistol. \n\nHe then fled from Mestre, but an investigation into the murders of the Succo couple immediately connected them to the son, who was arrested two days later at the exit of a pizzeria in San Pietro al Natisone, not far from the border with Yugoslavia, after he had briefly returned to the crime scene.\n\nAfter Succo was caught, he was judged mentally ill and sentenced to ten years in a psychiatric prison in Reggio Emilia. While serving his sentence, he was a model prisoner who studied geology at the University of Parma.\n\nAfter serving five years of his sentence, on May 15, 1986 while on freedom privileges, Succo escaped from the psychiatric hospital. He evaded police and escaped to France by rail, using fake documents and changing his surname to \"Kurt\". In the next few years, he committed numerous crimes, including burglary, rape and murder. In France, he killed two women, a physician, and two police officers. He kidnapped, hijacked, and terrorized people in three European countries. He was considered Public Enemy number one by France, Italy, and Switzerland.\n\nAfter being recognized by a student in Aix-les-Bains on April 6, Succo returned to Italy. On 28 February 1988 he was caught in Mestre, his hometown. On March 1, 1988, in the course of an escape attempt, he fell from the roof of the Treviso prison. \n\nHe committed suicide in his cell in Vicenza, in the \"San Pius X\" prison on May 23, 1988, suffocating himself with a plastic bag.\n\nIn 1988, Bernard-Marie Koltès wrote a play (\"Roberto Zucco\") loosely based on Succo's life and crimes. French journalist Pascale Froment wrote a non-fiction account of Succo's crimes that appeared as \"Je te tue. Histoire vraie de Roberto Succo assassin sans raison\" in 1991, and it served as the basis for the 2001 film \"Roberto Succo\" directed by Cédric Kahn. French police officers criticized the film for allegedly glorifying Succo. Froment's book was reissued in 2001 under the title \"Roberto Succo\".\n"}
{"id": "1894665", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1894665", "title": "Unity of invention", "text": "Unity of invention\n\nIn most patent laws, unity of invention is a formal administrative requirement that must be met by a patent application to become a granted patent. Basically, a patent application can relate only to one invention or a group of closely related inventions. The purpose of this requirement is administrative, as well as financial. That is, the requirement serves to preclude the option of filing one patent application for several inventions, while paying only one set of fees (filing fee, search fee, examination fee, renewal fees, and so on). Unity of invention also makes the classification of patent documents easier.\n\nWhen a patent application is objected to on the ground of a lack of unity, it may be still considered for patent protection, unlike in the case where the invention is found to be lacking novelty. A divisional application can usually be filed for the second invention, and for the further inventions, if any. Alternatively, a patent prosecutor may make a technical argument that there is unity of invention. \n\nUnder European patent practice and case law, lack of unity (of invention) can appear either \"\"a priori\"\", before the prior art was examined, or \"\"a posteriori\"\", after the prior art was examined. An \"a posteriori\" lack of unity usually results from a lack of novelty or inventive step of the subject-matter of one independent claim.\n\nUnder the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), an international application, which is also called PCT application, \"shall relate to one invention only or to a group of inventions so linked as to form a single general inventive concept\". If the requirement of unity of invention is not met, the International Searching Authority (i.e., the patent office in charge of carrying out the international search) \"is entitled to request the applicant to pay an additional search fee for each invention beyond the first which is to be searched\". \n\nIn reaction to such a request from the International Searching Authority (ISA), the applicant may pay all or some of the requested additional search fees, and the International Searching Authority (ISA) then establishes the international search for all or some of the inventions or groups of inventions, respectively. The applicant may also decide not to pay any of the additional search fees, and, in such case, the ISA does not carry out a search for the inventions or groups of inventions for which no search fees have been paid. The international search report (ISR) is then established only for the first claimed invention. \n\nIf the applicant disagrees with the ISA’s finding of lack of unity of invention, the additional fees may be paid under protest. In the protest procedure, the applicant files a reasoned statement explaining why it considers that the requirement of unity of invention has been complied with, or that the number of additional fees required is excessive. After payment of the additional search fees and, if required, of a protest fee, the protest is examined by a review body. If the review body finds the protest justified, it orders the total or partial reimbursement of the additional search fees, and, if applicable, the protest fee, to the applicant. When, for instance, the European Patent Office acts as ISA, the review body in charge of examining the protest consists of three members: \"the head of a directorate, normally the head of the directorate by which the invitation to pay additional fees was issued, an examiner with special expertise in unity of invention and, normally, the examiner who issued the invitation.\" \n\nIn U.S. patent law, applications that claim more than one distinct invention may be subject to restriction to a single invention, and the applicant may prosecute the remaining invention(s) by filing a divisional application(s). A \"restriction requirement\" will typically present the different inventions based on the claims within the application, and the applicant may elect which invention he would prosecute.\n\n"}
{"id": "1894668", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1894668", "title": "Tiger Leaping Gorge", "text": "Tiger Leaping Gorge\n\nTiger Leaping Gorge () is a scenic canyon on the Jinsha River, a primary tributary of the upper Yangtze River. It is located north of Lijiang City, Yunnan in southwestern China. It is part of the Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan Protected Areas World Heritage Site.\n\nLegend says the name comes from a hunted tiger escaping by jumping across the river at the narrowest point (still wide), using the rock in the middle.\n\nAt a maximum depth of approximately 3,790 meters (12,434 feet) from river to mountain peak, Tiger Leaping Gorge is one of the deepest and most spectacular river canyons in the world. The inhabitants of the gorge are primarily the indigenous Naxi people, who live in a handful of small hamlets. Their primary subsistence comes from grain production and hikers.\n\nAround in length, the gorge is located where the river passes between the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain and the Haba Snow Mountain in a series of rapids under steep cliffs.\n\nAdministratively, the river in this area forms the border between Yulong Naxi Autonomous County of Lijiang City (right bank) and Shangri-La County of Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture (left bank).\n\nThe gorge is not considered navigable. In the early 1980s, four rafters attempted to go down the gorge and were never seen again. In 1986, the first known successful attempt to sail through the gorge was made by the first expedition to float down the entire length of the Yangtze, starting at the river's high source at the Gelandandong glacier lake.\n\nThe area was officially opened to foreign tourists in 1993, but had attracted adventurous backpackers already in the 1980s. Officials plan to improve the existing trails and roads, bringing tour buses and more development. These plans arouse highly varied reactions among the local population, from strong opposition to strong support.\n\nNatural crystals are mined from areas in and surrounding the Tiger Leaping Gorge.\n\nTiger Leaping Gorge weather is generally mild, with abundant rainfall and plenty of sunshine. It has an average annual temperature between 13°C (55 F) and 20°C (68 F), without too much change from spring to winter. In summer, the temperature just falls between 10 - 26°C (50 - 79 F) low because of the continuous rain. Coming to winter, the high mountains block the cold air from northern China, so it is still as warm as spring for most of the days.\n\nSpring:\n\nMarch and April are best months to hike in Tiger Leaping Gorge for comfortable weather with temperatures up to 20°C. Take a light jacket. May is even more warmer than April and there are more blooming flora.\n\nSummer:\n\nIt's the rainy season of Tiger Leaping Gorge from June to September. The heavy rain may result in the gorge being closed on certain days.\n\nAutumn:\n\nThe scenery from mid-autumn to November is also excellent. Usually dry and sunny, bring a long-sleeve, light sweater and a coat.\n\nWinter:\n\nA good time to hike the gorge for the sunny weather, dry and clear. It's cold at night and chilly at morning.\n\nBest time to visit\n\nTiger Leaping Gorge hike can be undertaken at any time around the year as it enjoys a mild climate even in winter (5-15 degrees Celsius), but the temperature difference of a day is great. Most of the days are sunny and dry; however, it rains a lot during the rainy season from July to September and there is some risk that paths could be blocked due to landslides. Check the Tiger Leaping Gorge Weather Forecast before you visit.\n\nHiking the length of the gorge is possible. The hiking path (\"the high road\") is well-maintained and marked, although sometimes narrow, and at times impassable due to heavy rains, and is used by the Naxi as part of everyday life. This trail is longer than the lower road, approximately , but is more varied. It features a variety of micro-ecosystems, waterfalls, and a fair number of guesthouses for trekkers. These guesthouses are not well heated, which combined with the unpredictable nature of high mountain weather makes this trek unadvisable during the rainy season.\n\nThe lower road, stretching about from Qiaotou through the Gorge, is a stretch of pavement (until recently a simple mule track) crossed by several waterfalls, and frequently beset by rockslides. Some portions of the road have been known to disappear into the river below. The road follows the Yangtze, so there are more views of the river, and a stronger sense of being in a gorge than on the upper trail. Where the high road descends to meet the lower road, one can climb down to the river near the Tiger Leaping Stone, the point at which the tiger is said to have leaped. In July 2010, the Chinese government closed the gorge to visitors because a new lower road was being built. Consequently, there were no government officials to charge the 50 yuan fee to enter the trail. Locals requested a 10 yuan fee to enter the trail. Many trekkers still hiked the high road in spite of its closure. Some buses continued to travel the low road, although landslides frequently caused travel delays.\n\nAlthough Tiger Leaping Gorge is an essential part of the Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan, a World Heritage Site since 2003, the Chinese government floated proposals for a hydroelectric dam on the Jinsha River in 2004. The Yunnan provincial government scrapped the project in 2007.\n\nDetails of the scrapped project follow: Construction had begun on the other 12 dams of the same project which lie just outside the boundaries of the heritage area, even though it had not been approved by the State Council.\nMedia reports suggested that the Lijiang city government waived standard procedures in order to facilitate the project.\n\nThe project would displace up to 100,000 people to the north, mainly the Naxi minority, to a Tibetan area with harsh climate and unfamiliar crops as barley and potatoes as staples, virtually stop the flow of the upper Yangtze River, and irreparably alter the landscape of the Tiger Leaping Gorge. The project was abandoned in December 2007. This project was also related to the Three Gorges Dam and the South-North Water Transfer Project, which would cause massive environmental damage and the destruction of thousands of cultural sites.\n\n\n"}

While having a history of civil vessel construction, Kockums' most renowned activity is the fabrication of military corvettes and submarines.\n\nKockums worked with Northrop Grumman and Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft (HDW) to offer a \"Visby\"-class corvette derivative in the American Focused Mission Vessel Study, a precursor to the Littoral Combat Ship program. It competed with several other concepts, including Norway's Skjold class (part of a Raytheon led group).\n\nAs a result of the Swedish shipyard crisis which heavily affected the industry during 1969–1985, due to heavy competition from the Far East and the 1973 oil crisis, Kockums was placed under the control of the Swedish state through the state-owned company Svenska Varv and its successor company Celsius AB from 1979 until 1999. Having implemented a highly advanced variety of the Stirling engine for low noise submarine propulsion, Kockums was considered to have strategic value for the Swedish Navy. During the period of state ownership, Kockums acquired Karlskronavarvet , the operator of the Karlskrona shipyards, in 1989. In 1999, following the acquisition of Celsius AB by Saab, Kockums was sold to the German shipbuilding company HDW. In 2005, HDW was bought by the German industrial conglomerate Thyssen Krupp. The time after 1999 was rife with conflicts between Kockums' only Swedish customer, the Defence Materiel Administration (FMV), and Kockums' German owners. The Swedish view was that the technical advancements made in collaboration between Kockums and FMV ought to be used to create a new generation of submarine for lucrative export: the A26 submarine. On the German side, the A26 project was said to be regarded as a high-risk project that could lead to uncontrollably growing costs. Superficially, the major source of conflict seemed to be that neither ThyssenKrupp nor FMV would accept carrying unforeseen development costs. As several technical innovations to be implemented in the A26 were kept in classified status at the FMV, ThyssenKrupp argued that the implied costs were too difficult to predict. This deadlock persisted for months until the FMV decided to cancel the order of the A26 submarines.\n\nGlobally, the conflict also concerned the general business strategy. ThyssenKrupp insisted that Kockums ought to discontinue large submarine construction and to focus on the development of small submarines. Meanwhile, anonymous sources from inside Kockums claimed that ThyssenKrupp's goal in acquiring Kockums was never to reach synergies with HDW, but only to eliminate its main competitor.\n\nWhen the Crimea crisis erupted in March 2014, Sweden's defence interests in the future of Kockums came under closer scrutiny. The turning point was described by the chairman of the Swedish parliament's Standing Committee on Defense (SCD), Peter Hultquist:\nIn the search for a partner to develop the next generation of submarines, the FMV approached the SAAB Group. During autumn 2013, Saab tried to reach an agreement to buy Kockums from ThyssenKrupp. ThyssenKrupp demanded to keep its monopoly position in the A26 deal, which Saab refused to accept, causing the negotiations to fail. Saab responded by approaching Kockums' engineers, offering them employment at Saab Naval Systems. Thyssen Krupp tried in vain to keep its engineers at Kockums, proposing an extra month's salary.\n\nThe hostility towards ThyssenKrupp reached a new level during the Kockums equipment repossession incident on 8 April 2014. As per protocol, two military trucks accompanied by armed soldiers entered the Kockums shipyard in Malmö to reclaim all materiel and equipment belonging to the Defence Materiel Administration (Sweden), FMV, as well as all secret blueprints and images. By orders from a manager, Kockums staff tried to sabotage the repossession by locking the gates with the repossession crew and escort still inside. According to a spokesperson from FMV this is the first time they have had to forcefully repossess equipment.\n\nShortly after, ThyssenKrupp initiated discussions to sell Kockums to Saab. The deal was finalized on 22 July 2014, making Saab the new owner of Kockums.\n\nAustralia: In November 2014 Saab formally made a bid in SEA 1000, the Royal Australian Navy's replacement program for the six Collins-class submarines still in service. Defence Minister David Johnston stated that \"\"We need to decide quickly and whatever we do decide will be in the best interests of the entire nation\".\"\" \"The Australian Government had been ready to buy the more expensive \"Sōryū\"-class submarine offered by the Japanese Maritime Self Defence Force; however, internal opposition had forced the government to have an open tender for the multi-billion-dollar program. Australia subsequently selected Naval Group (formerly DCNS) France and their Shortfin Barracuda submarines to replace the Australian Collins class.\n\nIn December 2014 it was announced that leading global Dutch shipbuilder Damen Shipyards entered into an agreement with Saab to develop, offer, and build next-generation submarines, initially focusing on the planned replacement of 4 Walrus Class submarines currently used by The Royal Netherlands Navy.\n\nThe shipyard formerly possessed a 138-metre high crane, known as the Kockums Crane, built in 1973/74 and capable of lifting 1500 tons, making it the largest crane in the world when it was installed in 1974. The crane was not used much because of the Swedish shipyard crisis of the late 1970s and 1980s. It was used the last time in 1997 for lifting the foundations of the high pillars of the Oresund Bridge.\n\nThe crane was sold the first time in the early 1990s to the Danish company Burmeister & Wain, but the company went bankrupt shortly thereafter. It was later sold to a Korean company, Hyundai Heavy Industries. The crane was a landmark of Malmö from its time of construction until its dismantling before being shipped to Ulsan in South Korea in the summer of 2002.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was born in Rakvere, Estonia.\n\nVaska was educated at the Baltic University in Hamburg, Germany (1946) and subsequently at the University of Göttingen (1946–1949), where he received his \"Vordiplom\" (equivalent to the American B.S. degree). He pursued his Ph.D. in inorganic chemistry at the University of Texas in the United States (1952–1956). He was a postdoctoral fellow at Northwestern University (1956–1957) where he conducted research on magnetochemistry. In 1957 he took a position as Fellow at the Mellon Institute in Pittsburgh, where he remained until 1964. During that time, the Mellon Institute housed a number of future chemical luminaries, including Paul Lauterbur and R. Bruce King. Vaska moved as an associate professor to Clarkson University in Potsdam, New York, where, from 1990 to his death, he was professor emeritus of chemistry. His brother Vootele Vaska is a philosopher. He died in Basking Ridge, New Jersey in 2015, aged 90.\nVaska published \"ca.\" eighty journal articles on the coordination chemistry of transition metals, homogeneous catalysis, and both organometallic and bioinorganic chemistry. His years at Mellon were especially productive. With J.W. Di Luzio in 1962 he first described the iridium compound which became known as Vaska's complex, \"trans\"-IrCl(CO)[P(CH)] Working with a series of coworkers, he demonstrated that this iridium(I) complex undergoes a variety of reactions with small molecules. For example, it oxidatively adds H to give a dihydride. He subsequently discovered that his complex reversibly bound O, which was then a startling achievement. He discovered the main reactions of oxidative addition, a process that is central to homogeneous catalysis in organometallic chemistry. He demonstrated a number of important substituent effects on the oxidative addition, such as the greater reactivity of Ir(I) \"vs.\" Rh(I) and the stabilization of oxidative adducts by iodide \"vs.\" chloride.\n\nAmong his awards are the Boris Pregel Award for Research in Chemical Physics (New York Academy of Sciences) in 1971 and election in 1981 as a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science for \"pioneering work in transition metal organometallic chemistry and synthetic oxygen carriers\".\n"}

It shares this location with the European Bioinformatics Institute. It was established in 1992 and named after double Nobel Laureate, Frederick Sanger. It was conceived as a large scale DNA sequencing centre to participate in the Human Genome Project, and went on to make the largest single contribution to the gold standard sequence of the human genome. From its inception the Institute established and has maintained a policy of data sharing, and does much of its research in collaboration.\n\nSince 2000, the Institute expanded its mission to understand \"the role of genetics in health and disease\". The Institute now employs around 900 people and engages in five main areas of research: Cancer, Ageing and Somatic Mutation; Cellular Genetics; Human Genetics; Parasite and Microbes; and the Tree of Life.\n\nIn 1993 the then 17 Sanger Centre staff moved into temporary laboratory space at Hinxton Hall in Cambridgeshire.\nThis site was to become the Wellcome Genome Campus, which has a growing population of around 1300 staff, approximately 900 of whom work at the Sanger Institute. The Genome Campus also includes the Wellcome Trust Conference Centre and the European Bioinformatics Institute. A major extension of the campus was officially opened in 2005; the buildings accommodate new laboratories, a data centre and staff amenities. In discussing the name of the centre, Sanger (still alive when the centre was opened) told John Sulston, the founding director, that the centre \"had better be good.\" Sulston commented, \"I rather wished I hadn’t asked.\"\n\nThe Sanger Institute's sequencing staff handle millions of DNA samples each week. The Institute \"capitalises on leading-edge technologies to answer questions unanswerable only a few years ago\". The advances in technology allow the Sanger Institute to carry out sequencing of the genomes of individual humans, vertebrate species and pathogens, at an ever-increasing pace and reducing cost. The Institute has more than 100 ongoing pathogen sequencing projects. The output of the Sanger Institute is around 10 billion bases of raw sequence data per day.\n\nBioinformatic databases resources are one of the outcomes of research programmes that the Sanger Institute is involved in. Those hosted by the Sanger Institute include:\n\nSeveral databases were initiated at the Sanger Institute but are now hosted elsewhere:\nScientific research at the Sanger Institute is organised into five Scientific Programmes, each defining a major area of research with a particular biological, disease or analytic focus. The current Programmes at the Sanger Institute are Cancer, Ageing and Somatic Mutation, Cellular Genetics, Human Genetics, Parasites and Microbes and Tree of Life. Studies from all programmes provide insights into human, pathogen, cellular evolution, the phenotypic and hence biological consequences of genome variation and the processes which cause mutations.\n\nProvides leadership in data aggregation and informatics innovation, develops high-throughput cellular models of cancer for genome-wide functional screens and drug testing, and explores somatic mutation's role in clonal evolution, ageing and development. This Programme includes the Cancer Genome Project.\n\nExplores human gene function by studying the impact of genome variation on cell biology. Large-scale systematic screens are used to discover the impact of naturally occurring and engineered genome mutations in human induced pluripotent cells (hIPSCs), their differentiated derivatives and other cell types. It is one of the founder programmes driving the creation and organisation of the international Human Cell Atlas initiative.\n\nThe Institute's research in human genetics focuses on the characterisation of human genetic variation in health and disease. Aside from the Institute's contribution to the Human Genome Project, researchers at the Sanger Institute have made contributions in various research areas relating to disease, population comparative and evolutionary genetics. In January 2008, the launch of the 1000 Genomes Project, a collaboration with scientists around the globe, signalled an effort to sequence the genomes of 1000 individuals in order to create the \"most detailed map of human genetic variation to support disease studies\". The data from the pilot projects was made freely available in public databases in June 2010. In 2010, the Sanger Institute announced its participation in the UK10K project, which will sequence the genomes of 10,000 individuals to identify rare genetic variants and their effects on human health. The Sanger Institute is also part of the International Cancer Genome Consortium, an international effort to describe different cancer tumour types. It is also part of the GENCODE and ENCODE research programmes to create an encyclopaedia of DNA elements.\n\nThe Programme applies genomics to population-scale studies to identify the causal variants and pathways involved in human disease and their effects on cell biology. It also models developmental disorders to explore which physical aspects might be reversible.\n\nInvestigates the common underpinning mechanisms of evolution, infection and resistance to therapy into bolster understanding of bacteria, viruses and parasites, with a particular interest in malaria. It also explores the effects of genome variation on the biology of host-pathogen interactions, in particular host response to infection and the role of microiotia in health and disease. All the genomes after sequencing are made available at the web-based onsite-maintained database, GeneDB.\n\nThe Tree of Life Programme was created in 2019 to investigate the diversity of complex organisms found in the UK through sequencing and cellular technologies. It also compares and contrasts species' genome sequences to unlock insights into evolution and conservation. This Programme will play a leading role in the Darwin Tree of Life Project, a UK-wide initiative to sequence the genomes of all 66,000 complex species (eukaryotes) in the British Isles.\n\nMuch of the Sanger Institute's research is carried out in partnership with the wider scientific community; over 90 percent of the Institute's research papers involve collaborations with other organisations. Significant collaborations include:\n\nThe Sanger Institute has a programme of public engagement activity. The programme aims to make complex biomedical research accessible to a range of audiences including school students and their teachers, and local community members.\n\nThe Communication and Public Engagement programme aims to \"encourage informed discussion about issues relevant to Sanger Institute research\" and \"foster a community of researchers who can engage effectively with different audiences\". The Institute hosts visits for more than 1,500 students, teachers and community groups per year. Visitors may meet scientific staff, tour the Institute and its facilities, and participate in ethical debates and activities. The programme also offers professional development sessions for teachers of GCSE and post 16 science through the national network of Science Learning Centres, and by hosting visits for groups interested in updating their knowledge in contemporary genetics. Videoconferencing into the Sanger Institute is also offered for Science Learning Centres, Science Centres and schools.\n\nScientific and public engagement staff also collaborate on and contribute to national projects such as the UK's \"InsideDNA\" traveling exhibition and the \"Who am I?\" gallery at The Science Museum. They also participate in public events such as the Cambridge Science Festival.\n\nThe Institute operates two PhD training programmes: a four-year course for basic science graduates, and a three-year course for clinicians. The four-year course requires students to rotate around three different laboratories in order to broaden their scientific horizons before choosing a PhD project. Each student is required to choose at least one experimental and one informatics-based rotation project. Institute houses approximately 50 pre-doctoral students, all of whom are registered at the University of Cambridge.\n\nAccording to Companies House the five officers of the parent company Genome Research Limited are Henry Parkinson, Kay Elizabeth Davies, Rolf Dieter Heuer, James Cuthbert Smith, David Lindsay Willetts. According to the Sanger website Henry Parkinson is head of legal.\n\n the Sanger employs around 900 people, and is led by Michael Stratton. Notable scientific staff, faculty and alumni are listed below:\n\n a faculty of 32 scientists lead hypothesis-driven research, seeking answers to biomedical questions. Among others, these include Dominic Kwiatkowski, Nicole Soranzo, Michael Stratton, Sarah Teichmann and Matthew Hurles. The institute also has a number of Associate Faculty members, International Fellows and Honorary Faculty. These include Adrian Bird, Ewan Birney, Chris Ponting, Fiona Powrie, Stephen O'Rahilly and Wolf Reik, among others.\n\nThe Sanger Board of Management are guided by the scientific advisory board whose members include Professor David Altshuler, Professor Anton Berns, Professor David J. Lipman, Professor Kevin Marsh and Professor Sir Paul Nurse.\n\nPrevious faculty members at the Sanger include:\n\n\nJohn E. Sulston was the founding Director of the Sanger Institute. Sulston was instrumental in the choice of the Hinxton site for the Institute and remained there as Director until the announcement of the completion of the draft human genome in 2000. Sulston graduated from the University of Cambridge in 1963 and completed his PhD on the chemical synthesis of DNA in 1966. He shared the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Robert Horvitz and Sydney Brenner, two years after standing down as Director of the Institute.\n\nIn 2000, Allan Bradley left his appointment as Professor at the Baylor College of Medicine, in the US, to take up the position as Director of the Sanger Institute. Bradley wanted to build on the achievements made by the Sanger Institute in the Human Genome Project by \"concentrating on gene function, cancer genomics, and the genomes of model organisms such as the mouse and the zebrafish\". Bradley received his BA, MA and PhD in Genetics from the University of Cambridge.\n\nIn 2010, Bradley stepped down from his leadership role to form a startup company, but remains on the faculty of the Institute as Director Emeritus. Mike Stratton, who is a leader of the Cancer Genome Project and the International Cancer Genome Consortium, was appointed Director of the Sanger Institute in May of that year.\n\nThe Sanger Institute was opened in 1993, three years after the inception of the Human Genome Project, and went on to make the largest single contribution to the gold standard sequence of the human genome, published in 2004. The Institute was engaged in collaborations to sequence 8 of the 23 human pairs of chromosomes (1, 6, 9, 10, 13, 20, 22, and X). Since the publishing of the human genome, research carried out at the Institute has developed beyond sequencing of organisms into various biomedical research areas, including studies into diseases such as cancer, malaria and diabetes.\n\nIn August 2018 it was reported that an investigation was under way into allegations of bullying of staff and gender discrimination made against senior management of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, including the director. The investigation, carried out by the barrister Thomas Kibling from Matrix Chambers, concluded in October 2018 and cleared Stratton of any wrongdoing, while listing areas for improvement in the workings of the Sanger Institute. The findings and the independence of the investigation were disputed.\n\nIn October 2019 it was reported that the institute had manufactured a medical tool with the intent of monetising it despite not having ethical nor legal approval to do so and having been made aware by Stellenbosch University and internal whistleblowers.\n"}

Measuring 4 μm wide to 8 μm high, an enamel rod is a tightly packed, highly organized mass of hydroxyapatite crystals, which are hexagonal in shape and provide rigidity to the rods and strengthen the enamel. In cross section, it is best compared to a keyhole with the top, or head, oriented toward the crown of the tooth and the bottom, or tail, oriented toward the root of the tooth.\n\nThey range from 5 million to 12 million in number. (5 million in mandibular lateral incisor and 12 million in maxillary first molars).\n\nEnamel rods are found in rows along the tooth. Within each row, the long axis of the enamel rod generally is perpendicular to the underlying enamel-dentine junction. In permanent teeth, the enamel rods near the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) tilt slightly more toward the root of the tooth than would be expected. Knowing the orientation of enamel is very important in restorative dentistry because enamel unsupported by underlying dentin is prone to fracture and usually is avoided.\n\nThe arrangement of crystals within each enamel rod is highly complex. For the most part, the enamel crystals are oriented parallel to the long axis of the rod. The further away the crystals are from the central axis, the more their own orientation diverges.\n\nThe area around the enamel rod is known as interrod enamel. Interrod enamel has the same composition as the enamel rods. Nonetheless, a histologic distinction is made between the two because crystal orientation is different in each. The crystals lie nearly perpendicular to the enamel rod.\n\nBecause of inter-woven network of rods, teeth can resist masticatory forces up to 20-30 pounds per tooth. \n\n(1)Permanent tooth:- At edges/cusps=\"\"vertically\"\"..In Cervical region=\"\"apically\"\"..\n\nPrimary tooth:- From the dentinoenamel junction(edge/cusps)= oblique... in the cervical third of the crown =\"\"horizontally\"\"..\n"}
{"id": "1894710", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1894710", "title": "Football pitch", "text": "Football pitch\n\nA football pitch (also known as a football field) is the playing surface for the game of association football. Its dimensions and markings are defined by Law 1 of the Laws of the Game, \"The Field of Play\". The pitch is typically made of natural turf or artificial turf, although amateur and recreational teams often play on dirt fields. Artificial surfaces must be green in colour.\n\nAll line markings on the pitch form part of the area which they define. For example, a ball on or above the touchline is still on the field of play, and a foul committed over the line bounding the penalty area results in a penalty. Therefore, a ball must completely cross the touchline to be out of play, and a ball must wholly cross the goal line (between the goal posts) before a goal is scored; if any part of the ball is still on or above the line, the ball is still in play.\n\nThe field descriptions that apply to adult matches are described below. Because of the role of the British football associations in the history of the game, the dimensions of the field of play were originally formulated and expressed in imperial units. Since 1997, the Laws of the Game have preferred metric units, with imperial equivalents given only in brackets. Because the actual values have, in general, not changed since the early twentieth century, they tend to be round numbers in imperial units (for example the width of the goal, unchanged since 1863, is 8 yards or 7.32 metres). Use of the imperial values remains common, especially in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe pitch is rectangular in shape. The longer sides are called touchlines. The other opposing sides are called the goal lines. The two goal lines must be between wide, and be the same length. The two touchlines must be between long, and be the same length. All lines on the ground must be equally wide, not to exceed . The corners of the pitch are marked by corner flags.\n\nFor international matches the field dimensions are more tightly constrained; the goal lines must be between wide, and the touchlines must be between long.\n\nAlthough the term \"goal line\" is often taken to mean only that part of the line between the goalposts, in fact it refers to the complete line at either end of the pitch, from one corner flag to the other. In contrast, the term \"byline\" (or \"by-line\") is often used to refer to that portion of the goal line outside the goalposts. This term is commonly used in football commentaries and match descriptions, such as this example from a BBC match report: \"Udeze gets to the left byline and his looping cross is cleared...\"\n\n\"Goals\" are placed at the centre of each goal-line.\nThese consist of two upright posts placed equidistant from the corner flagposts, joined at the top by a horizontal crossbar. The inner edges of the posts must be apart, and the lower edge of the crossbar must be above the ground. Nets are usually placed behind the goal, though are not required by the Laws.\n\nGoalposts and crossbars must be white, and made of wood, metal or other approved material. Rules regarding the shape of goalposts and crossbars are somewhat more lenient, but they must conform to a shape that does not pose a threat to players. Since the beginning of football there have always been goalposts, but the crossbar wasn't invented until 1875, before which a string between the goalposts was used.\n\nA goal is scored when the ball crosses the goal line between the goal-posts, even if a defending player last touched the ball before it crossed the goal line (see own goal). A goal may, however, be ruled illegal (and void by the referee) if the player who scored or a member of their team commits an offence under any of the laws between the time the ball was previously out of play and the goal being scored. It is also deemed void if a player on the opposing team commits an offence before the ball has passed the line, as in the case of fouls being committed, a penalty awarded but the ball continued on a path that caused it to cross the goal line.\n\nThe football goal size for a junior match goal is approximately half the size of an adult sized match goal.\n\nFootball goals were first described in England in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. In 1584 and 1602 respectively, John Norden and Richard Carew referred to \"goals\" in Cornish hurling. Carew described how goals were made: \"they pitch two bushes in the ground, some eight or ten foote asunder; and directly against them, ten or twelue [twelve] score off, other twayne in like distance, which they terme their Goales\". The first reference to \"scoring a goal\" is in John Day's play \"The Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green\" (performed circa 1600; published 1659). Similarly in a poem in 1613, Michael Drayton refers to \"when the Ball to throw, And drive it to the Gole, in squadrons forth they goe\". Solid crossbars were first introduced by the Sheffield Rules. Football nets were invented by Liverpool engineer John Brodie in 1891, and they were a necessary help for discussions about whether or not a goal had been scored.\n\nTwo rectangular boxes are marked out on the pitch in front of each goal.\n\nThe \"goal area\" (colloquially the \"\"six-yard box\"\"), consists of the rectangle formed by the goal-line, two lines starting on the goal-line from the goalposts and extending into the pitch from the goal-line, and the line joining these. Goal kicks and any free kick by the defending team may be taken from anywhere in this area. Indirect free kicks awarded to the attacking team within the goal area are taken from the point on the line parallel to the goal line (the \"six-yard line\") nearest where the infringement occurred; they cannot be taken any closer to the goal line. Similarly drop-balls that would otherwise occur closer to the goal line are taken on this line.\n\nThe \"penalty area\" (colloquially \"\"The 18-yard box\"\" or just \"\"The box\"\") is similarly formed by the goal-line and lines extending from it, but its lines start from the goalposts and extend into the field. This area has a number of functions, the most prominent being to denote where the goalkeeper may handle the ball and where a foul by a defender, usually punished by a direct free kick, becomes punishable by a penalty kick. Both the goal and penalty areas were formed as halfcircles until 1902.\n\nThe \"penalty mark\" is in front of the very centre of the goal; this is the point from where penalty kicks are taken.\n\nThe \"penalty arc\" (colloquially \"the D\") is marked from the outside edge of the penalty area, from the penalty mark; this, along with the penalty area, marks an exclusion zone for all players other than the penalty kicker and defending goalkeeper during a penalty kick.\n\nThe \"centre circle\" is marked at from the \"centre mark\". Similar to the penalty arc, this indicates the minimum distance that opposing players must keep at kick-off; the ball itself is placed on the \"centre mark\". During penalty shootouts all players other than the two goalkeepers and the current kicker are required to remain within this circle.\n\nThe \"half-way line\" divides the pitch in two. The half which a team defends is commonly referred to as being their half. Players must be within their own half at a kick-off and may not be penalised as being offside in their own half. The intersections between the half-way line and the touchline can be indicated with flags like those marking the corners – the laws consider this as an optional feature.\n\nThe arcs in the \"corners\" denote the area (within 1 yard of the corner) in which the ball has to be placed for corner kicks; opposition players have to be away during a corner, and there may be optional lines off-pitch 9.15 metres (10 yards) away from the corner arc on the goal- and touch-lines to help gauge these distances.\n\nGrass is the normal surface of play, although artificial turf may sometimes be used especially in locations where maintenance of grass may be difficult due to inclement weather. This may include areas where it is very wet, causing the grass to deteriorate rapidly; where it is very dry, causing the grass to die; and where the turf is under heavy use. Artificial turf pitches are also increasingly common on the Scandinavian Peninsula, due to the amount of snow during the winter months. The strain put on grass pitches by the cold climate and subsequent snow clearing has necessitated the installation of artificial turf in the stadia of many top-tier clubs in Norway, Sweden and Finland. The latest artificial surfaces use rubber crumbs, as opposed to the previous system of sand infill. Some leagues and football associations have specifically prohibited artificial surfaces due to injury concerns and require teams' home stadia to have grass pitches. All artificial turf must be green and also meet the requirements specified in the FIFA Quality Concept for Football Turf.\n\nFootball can also be played on a dirt field. In most parts of the world, dirt is only used for casual recreational play.\n\n"}

They represent the incremental pattern of enamel, the successive apposition of different layers of enamel during crown formation.\n\nWhen viewed microscopically in cross-section, they appear as concentric rings. In a longitudinal section, they appear as a series of dark bands. The presence of the dark lines is similar to the annual rings on a tree. They are named after Swedish anatomist Anders Retzius.\n\nIn the longitudinal section of a tooth. these lines appear near the dentin. They bend obliquely near the cervical region. They curve occlusally near the cuspal regions or the incisal regions.\n\nProduced during the second stage of enamel calcification, also known as the maturation stage, ameloblasts produce matrix and enamel at the rate of 4 micrometers per day; however every fourth day there is a change in development. Brownish lines, the striae of Retzius, develop as a result of a change in the growth process. Macroscopically, these lines can be seen on the labial surface or lip side of anterior or front teeth as horizontal lines on the tooth crown, also known as perikymata or \"imbrication lines\" .\n\nEvenly spaced Retzius lines indicate a 6- to 11-day cycle of enamel formation.\n\nOccasional darker striae or grooves of Retzius result from systemic disturbances in the human body. For example, a fever can cause some lines to appear darker than those surrounding them. Normally, amelogenesis involves a period of enamel matrix formation and a rest period. In case of any disturbance, the rest periods are prolonged and occur close to one another. Consequently, the line of Retzius appears broader and much more prominent, often presenting a brownish colour under the microscope. The neonatal line is the darkest band, which represents the disrupted enamel formation due to the stress of being born.\n\nIt is also said to occur due to periodic bending of enamel rods.\n\nThe formation of the striae of Retzius results from a constriction of Tomes' processes when the activity of ameloblasts – cells only present in laying down enamel – is narrowed in conjunction with an increasing process of interrod enamel development. The striae of Retzius often extends from the Dental-enamel junction to the outer surface, ending in shallow pits known as perikymata.\n\nLines of Retzius (think age bands like tree growth rings) – Stria (A)\n\nSeveral diagrams and photographs of these lines (and others) appears in a document published by the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology on their website:\n"}

{"id": "1894767", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1894767", "title": "Eidophor", "text": "Eidophor\n\nAn Eidophor was a television projector used to create theater-sized images from an analog video signal. The name Eidophor is derived from the Greek word-roots \"eido\" and \"phor\" meaning 'image' and 'bearer' (carrier). Its basic technology was the use of electrostatic charges to deform an oil surface.\n\nThe idea for the original Eidophor was conceived in 1939 in Zurich by Swiss physicist Fritz Fischer, professor at the \"Labor für technische Physik\" of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, with the first prototype being unveiled in 1943. A basic patent was filed on November 8, 1939 in Switzerland and granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (patent no. 2,391,451) to Friederich Ernst Fischer for the \"Process and appliance for projecting television pictures\" on 25 December 1945.\nDuring the Second World War, Edgar Gretener worked together with Fischer at the Institute of Technical Physics to develop a prototype. When Gretener launched his own company \"Dr. Edgar Gretener AG\" in 1941 to develop encyphering equipment for the Swiss army, he stopped working on Eidophor. Hugo Thiemann took over this responsibility at the ETH.. After six years of work on this project at the ETH, Thiemann moved together with the project to the company \"Dr. Edgar Gretener AG\", which was licensed by the ETH to further develop Eidophor, following Fischer’s death in 1947.\nAn original August 1952 magazine article in the Radio and Television News credits the development of the Eidophor to Edgar Gretener. \nFollowing the Second World War, a first demonstration of an Eidophor system as a cinema video projector was organized in the Cinema Theater REX in Zurich to show successfully a TV broadcast on April 1958. An even more promising perspective was the interest of\nParamount Pictures and 20th Century Fox which experimented with the concept of \"theatre television\", where television images would be broadcast onto cinema screens. Over 100 cinemas were set up for the project, which failed because of financial losses and the refusal of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to grant theatre owners their own UHF bands for presentation.\n\nEidophors used an optical system somewhat similar to a conventional movie projector, but substituted a slowly rotating mirrored disk or dish for the film. The disk was covered with a thin film of transparent high-viscosity oil, and through the use of a scanned electron beam, electrostatic charges could be deposited onto the oil, causing its surface to deform. Light was shone on the disc by a striped mirror consisting of strips of reflective material alternating with transparent non-reflective areas. Areas of the oil unaffected by the electron beam would allow the light to be reflected directly back to the mirror and towards the light source, whereas light passing through deformed areas would be displaced and would pass through the adjacent transparent areas and onwards through the projection system. As the disk rotated, a doctor blade discharged and smoothed the ripples in the oil, readying it for re-use on another television frame.\nThe Eidophor was a large and cumbersome device and not commonly used until there was a need for good-quality large-screen projection. This opportunity arose as part of the NASA space program, where the technology was deployed in mission control.\n\nEidophors were also used in stadiums by touring music groups for live event visual amplification.\n\nSimple Eidophors produced black-and-white images. Later units used a color wheel (equivalent to the color television standard CBS tried to bring to the market against RCA/NBC's FCC-approved NTSC system, and today's DLP projection system) to produce red, green, and blue fields. The last models produced used separate red, green, and blue units in a single case. The Eidophor was 80 times brighter than CRT projectors of the time. The last Eidophors were able to project colour images of up to 18 metres in width. \n\nAdvances in projection television technology in the 1990s brought about the end of the Eidophor. An early prototype of a new type of projector with limited resolution using a passive matrix-addressed Liquid Crystal Display was shown at a conference in San Francisco by Swiss engineer Peter J. Wild already in 1972. The new devices, using active matrix addressing of LCDs were smaller and cheaper and produced results comparable with Eidophor. Current technologies include liquid-crystal display (LCD) and digital light processing (DLP) projectors, both of which produce superior results from easily portable devices.\n\n\n\n"}

For decades, the village used to operate as the hub of agricultural production and animal farming for the entire peninsula providing employment opportunities to thousands of people that would come to work in the local farms from very far away.\n\nThe renowned 18th century Greek philosopher Vikentios (Vincenzo) Damodos (1700–1752), son of a local aristocrat (Francesco Damodon), was born in the village and inaugurated a Philosophical and Theological School there upon its return from abroad. Under the conditions prevailing in the Ottoman Empire, all higher education had to be undertaken abroad. Damodos studied law in the Flaginian School in Venice and philosophy in the Collegio Veneto in Padova. Returning to his native village, he worked as a lawyer and he taught philosophy, rhetoric, and Greek literature for 32 years. He is considered one of the most influential Greek Renassainance figures and one of the prominent intellectuals and teachers of the period. He is the author of more than 140 works.\n\nHis considerable output of work on logic, rhetoric, physics, metaphysics, ethics and theology, printed in Athens as recently as 1940 and represented here. This work is still on traditional lines. That is to say, it relies, in its discussion of the nature, the subject-matter and the parts of moral philosophy, mainly on Aristotelian terms and concepts: the discussion of the summum bonum is, from this point of view, a relatively minor difference. For all that, and didactic though it is, the work stands on its own feet. It is reasoned, it pays careful attention to definition (for example, of various senses of 'good ' and of ' end '), it has something of its own to say about common sense as a kind of moral sense, and it hangs together. A section on the passions of the soul is obviously Cartesian in inspiration. Damodos's style is a pellucid, simple Greek, in strong contrast to the artificiality and archaism of Mavrokordatos, and the tortuosity of the third representative of this period, Eugenios Voulgaris.\n\nDamodos was among the first Greek intellectuals that questioned the absolute power of men and priests in the local society and, contrary to the established practice, made use of a simplified idiom (predecessor to the modern Greek language-Dimotiki) in order to deliver his lectures to the local population in a much more effective and direct manner.\n\nImbued with the new ideas of the Western Enlightenment, he produced the first Greek handbook of dogmatic theology. This was an innovation in the Orthodox world, where previously, although “Confessions of Faith” had been produced on the Western\nmodel in response to pressure from the West, there had not been any attempt at a systematic exposition of doctrine on rational principles. Damodos's model was the Jesuit Denis Pétau's De theologicis dogmatibus. While declaring his desire to follow “the God-bearing Fathers, and be guided by them” (Yannaras 2006, 101), Damodos reflects Western\nintellectualism rather than a patristic outlook. Damodos's Dogmatics only circulated in manuscript but it set the precedent for later works of the same kind by Eugenios Voulgaris and others, right up to the authoritative manuals of Christos Androutsos\n(1907) and Panayiotis Trembelas (1959–1963).\n\nOne of the remotely controlled telescopes operated by the National Observatory for Education 'EUDOXOS' has taken the name 'Vikendios Damodos' (TVD) and it is a specially made Ritchey-Cretien 0.51m equatorial reflector. EUDOXOS is the oldest Greek center for Robotic Astronomy and the Official Observatory of the Secondary Education System of Greece and operates since 1999 at an altitude of 1040m on Mount Ainos in Kefallonia. In the relevant announcement in November 2007, the following was stated:\n\n\"TVD honors the Cephalonian Humanitarian Vikendios Damodos from Havriata Pallis Kefalonia who created one of the earliest and most famous Greek original schools of Philosophy, Orthodox Theology and Physical Sciences of the 18th century, in his village in Kefalonia. As many Cephalonians did during the Venetian rule of the island, V. Damodos studied in the Universita di Padova and before his return he lectured in the Hellenic educational establishment of Venice.\"\n\nThe majority of the population is farmers, producing olives, grapes (stafida) and vegetables in the fertile fields, numerous vineyards, fruit orchards and olive groves, surrounding the village. The wine produced in the area is of a rare Robola quality due to the fertile green valley of moshato grape vineyards located next to the village. The flat lands along with hills cover the area around Chavriata while the mountains dominate the northern part. Part of the area around the village is also characterised by strange alluvial outpourings of sandy, grey soil. These scrubby wastelands have little or no cultivation on them.\n\nThe village is generally renowned for its special intellect and several academics originate from there. Its inhabitants are people with a keen sense of humor, a great deal of creativity, and a long musical tradition. The local population speaks a particular idiom that uses a wide variety of terms of Italian origin.\n\nOne of the most successful business dynasties in the construction and car sale sectors in Western Greece originates from this unique village.\n\nAn impressive point about the village is that almost 90% of its inhabitants carry the same surname (\"Moschopoulos\").\n\nThe village has experienced severe emigration, particularly to Canada and to the United States.\n\nThe nearest places are ordered clockwise\n\n\nAbout 1 km further on the road forks, one can find the impressive \"Holy Moni Kipoureon\" (\"Kipouria\") which offers a scenic view of the Ionian Sea, especially during the sunset. The landscape of the Monastery is reminiscent of the \"Caroulia\" of Mount Athos. This in combination with its spiritual treasures makes the Monastery an attraction for visitors.\n\nIts location is on a precipitous bluff that juts out over the deep blue sea (700m over the sea). The last and only monk, father Eusevios, that still lives there welcomes its visitors offering them local specialities. He has rebuilt most of the monastery buildings by himself, from the early 1990s.\n\nThe Monastery was built in the 17th century on the edge of a vertical solid rocky cliff high above the sea and owes its name to the numerous gardens in the area (kipos-garden). The founder of the Monastery was the Paxian Monk Chrisanthos Petropoulos and it is dedicated to the Annunciation of the Virgin. In a short period of time, it became a monk Monastery with the monk population reaching 80 in its peak years. Many distinguished clergymen emerged from this Monastery. Local earthquakes destroyed the monastery several times. In 1915 a French cruiser bombed the Monastery, mistaking its smoking chimney for an enemy vessel.\n\nWithin the Monastery one can worship the miraculous icon of the Annunciation as well as the sculls of the founders of the Monastery, Chrisanthos, Konstantios and Efronios. A piece of the Holy Cross offered to the Monastery by the Russian Prince Vladimiros Dolgoroukis in 1862 is also kept in the Monastery. An elegant glass jar holds St Dimitrios' Myrovlitos holy myron from the 7th AC century.\n\nOne can also worship various Saint's relics as well as saint Paraskevi's miraculous icon, a unique treasure of the destroyed Tafios Monastery. Holy relics, rare post-Renassaince, post-Byzantive and Italian-Cretan icons and items of faith can be found in the church which was built within the monastery area.\n\nAt a crossing after the village of Havriata, on a country lane that looks a lot like a tundra with no trees, only stones, shrub and a constant wind, at the most western part of Greece, one can find a historical, well-designed lighthouse of international value. It is located southwest of the village which is near \"Cape Gerogompos\".\n\nIt was manufactured in 1907 by British engineers and played an important role especially during the Second World War. It was destroyed by the German troops at their retirement from the island and was rebuilt in 1947. The altitude of the tower is 13 metres and it has a 58-metre radius of light. It used to belong to the Greek Navy and access to its premises used to be prohibited but nowadays it operates automatically.\n\n\n"}

Despite heavy investment and an order of 12 destroyers and a number of submarines (of which 2 destroyers were in initial stages of construction), development ceased due to the Second World War while in 1944 the facilities were virtually destroyed by Allied bombing. Operation started in 1957 when Greek business tycoon Stavros Niarchos purchased the ruined shipyard and rebuilt and expanded its facilities; since then the company has built many civilian and military ships.\n\nMilitary constructions include Greek-designed fast patrol boats and gunboats, as well as frigates, fast attack crafts, submarines, etc. based on French or German designs. A company division is involved in metal and machinery constructions, including specialized constructions for the Greek industry, structures and platforms for offshore drilling, cranes, etc. A special branch has also been created since 1986, for the mass production of various types of railcars (diesel and electric) and railroad cars (passenger and freight), mostly on German designs.\n\nThe company was bought in 2002 by a group of German investors under the industrial leadership of the German shipyard Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft (HDW), later a subsidiary of the German ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems.

The vessel was ordered on 23 June 2000 and construced by Navantia in Spain. The ship was launched on 23 November 2007 and commissioned on 29 November 2009. Named for Helge Ingstad, a Norwegian explorer, the \"Fridjtof Nansen\" class are capable of anti-air, anti-submarine and surface warfare. The frigate has been used as an escort for ships carrying chemical weapons to be destroyed. On 8 November 2018, HNoMS \"Helge Ingstad\" collided with the tanker in Norwegian waters just outside Sture Terminal. \"Helge Ingstad\" was severely damaged in the collision and beached. On 13 November 2018, the ship sank where she had run aground and became a constructive total loss. She was raised in a salvage operation from 27 February 2019 to 3 March 2019. In June 2019 after it was deemed uneconomical to repair her, it was decided that she would be scrapped.\n\nThe design of the s began in 1997. Based on the design, Izar (later Navantia) of Spain and Lockheed Martin were chosen to construct the vessel. The class is designed for operational flexibility with each ship capable of anti-air, anti-submarine and surface warfare. This was done to allow vessels of the class to operate with more ease in international operations. The \"Fridtjof Nansen\"-class frigates measure long overall with a beam of and a draught of . The frigates have a standard displacement of .\n\nThe frigates are propelled by one bow thruster and two controllable pitch propellers powered by a CODAG system with one GE LM2500 gas turbine rated at and two Bazán Bravo 12V diesel engines rated at . This gives the frigates a maximum speed of and a range of at . The ships are fitted with a landing pad for one NH90 helicopter.\n\nThe class are armed with an octuple launcher for Kongsberg Naval Strike Missiles for surface warfare. The launcher is located amidships, behind the forward superstructure. For anti-air warfare, the \"Fridjtof Nansen\"s are equipped with an octuple American Mk 41 vertical launch system for 32 RIM-162 ESSM surface-to-air missiles located ahead of the forward superstructure and aft the single-mounted OTO Melara Super Rapid gun. The ships also mount two twin-mounted torpedo tubes for Sting Ray torpedoes, each mount slotted amidships on either side of the aft superstructure. The frigates also mount depth charges, four Browning M2HB heavy machine guns, four Protector (RWS) (Sea PROTECTOR) and two Long Range Acoustic Devices.\n\nFor sensors, the frigates are equipped with a Lockheed Martin AN/SPY-1F 3-D multi-function radar, Reutech RSR 210N air/sea surveillance radar, Sagem VIGY 20 electro-optical director, MRS 2000 hull-mounted sonar, Captas MK II V1 active/passive towed sonar and two Mark 82 fire-control radar. The \"Fridjtof Nansen\" class use the Aegis combat system and Link 11 and is fitted for Link 16/22 combat data systems. For signal defence, the class operates the Terma DL-12T decoy launcher and Loki torpedo countermeasure systems. The vessels have a complement of over 120 personnel.\n\nThe ship was ordered for construction on 23 June 2000 by Norway and built by the Spanish shipbuilders Navantia at Ferrol, Spain. The vessel was the fourth of the \"Fridtjof Nansen\" class to be constructed, and was laid down on 28 April 2006. Construction had been delayed by disputes over quality control. The frigate was launched on 23 November 2007 and named for the Norwegian explorer Helge Ingstad. \"Helge Ingstad\" was commissioned in the Royal Norwegian Navy on 29 September 2009.\n\nFrom December 2013 to May 2014, \"Helge Ingstad\" was one of the escort ships for merchant vessels carrying chemical weapons from Syria to be destroyed.\n\nOn 8 November 2018, while returning from a NATO exercise, she was navigating inshore waters north of Bergen at speeds of up to . Starting from around 03:40 there was a watch handover on board \"Helge Ingstad\", during which three oncoming vessels were noted. After radio communication was established, and upon being asked to alter course to starboard, to avoid the , 112,939 t, Maltese-flagged oil tanker \"Sola TS\", escorted by VSP \"Tenax\", which had just left its berth, \"Helge Ingstad\" believed the vessel calling them to be one of the oncoming vessels they were tracking on radar. Assuming the tanker, slow moving and with its bright deck lights obscuring its navigation lights, to be part of the shore installation, the frigate intended passing it before altering course moving near her starboard channel margin. By the time they realised their error they were within of \"Sola TS\" and it was too late to avoid a collision. Preben Ottesen, the ship's commanding officer, stated that he was asleep in his cabin when the collision happened, and was in fact woken by the collision. \n\nThe collision caused severe damage to \"Helge Ingstad\", which lost control of engine and steering, with a large breach along her side from the starboard torpedo launchers to the stern. The vessel grounded and continued to take on water, through the propeller shaft and stuffing boxes. Seven sailors were injured in the incident. By late morning she had developed a severe list to starboard with most of the stern submerged. Despite damage control efforts the vessel sank in the early hours of 13 November, with only small sections of the superstructure remaining above water. The (alleged) failure of the vessel’s watertight integrity led to an immediate safety alert to designers Navantia, calling on them to advise operators of similar vessels on any necessary measures to address safety. This is the first incident of such scale in the Royal Norwegian Navy since 1994, when was lost after it ran aground.\n\nUnlike \"Helge Ingstad\", \"Sola TS\" only suffered minor damages in its front and was never in danger of sinking. She was able to continue to her destination after the incident. The tanker subsequently sailed to a shipyard in Gdansk for repairs and was back in regular service by late December 2018.\n\nFollowing the frigate's sinking, a local fish farming company, which had had to move fish from the area due to spill of diesel oil from the vessel, claimed one million kroner (US$ 116,000) in damages from the Ministry of Defence.\n\nThe Norwegian Navy inspected \"Helge Ingstad\" by the Norwegian Blueye Pioneer underwater drone. Poor weather hampered salvage operations through December 2018; with the planned date to raise the ship being delayed until late January 2019. \n\nThe lifting operation began on 26 February 2019. On 27 February 2019, due to weather concerns, the partially raised ship was moved to a location which is better protected from the elements, where further salvage work took place. The ship and the two heavy lift vessels (Rambiz and Gulliver) reached the Semco Maritime yard at Hanøytangen on 28 February 2019. Boarding parties consisting of some 300 people, including around 100 members of \"Helge Ingstad\"s original crew, assisted in pumping out the remaining water so that the ship could be placed on a barge and fully salvaged. Helge Ingstad was successfully placed on a barge on 2 March 2019 \"Boa barge 33\" carrying \"Helge Ingstad\" arrived at the Haakonsvern naval base on 3 March 2019.\n\nIn May 2019 the cost of repairing the frigate was estimated at 12 billion NOK (approximately EUR 1.2 billion), implying that it would be cheaper to build a new ship. However, restarting production for just one ship could result in a disproportionally high per-ship cost.\n\nThe Accident Investigation Board Norway (AIBN) and the Defence Accident Investigation Board Norway (DAIBN) immediately began a joint investigation, with the involvement of the Marine Safety Investigation Unit of Malta. On 29 November 2018 the AIBN published their preliminary accident report together with two interim safety recommendations. It recommended that the Norwegian military authorities investigate the findings of the preliminary report with a view to implementing any necessary safety measures, and that the shipbuilder Navantia investigate relevant aspects of the design of the frigate and whether other ships might be similarly affected. The watertight condition of the ship was guaranteed by the 13 watertight bulkheads. Seven compartments were damaged as a result of the collision but initially the ship remained afloat. No one intervened to break the chain of errors. If the commander had observed COLREGS the collision would not have occurred.\n\nOn 14 May 2019 it was reported the cost of repairing \"Helge Ingstad\" would exceed US$1.4 billion, according to the Forsvaret, nearly three times the original cost to build her.\n\n\n"}

The songs on the album are musically re-worked and lyrically re-written songs that had been demoed in the late 1980s, but never officially released.\n\nOne of the main reasons behind the making of \"Souls of Black\" was so that Testament could participate in the European Clash of the Titans tour with Megadeth, Slayer and Suicidal Tendencies, which began just prior to the album's release. Guitarist Eric Peterson explained to \"Guitar World\" magazine, \"We kind of rushed out \"Souls of Black\" just to get on the bill, because we didn't want to miss the tour and our label said we had to have an album out.

In the first part, Cytowic describes his chance encounter during a dinner party on February 10, 1980 with MW, the \"Man Who Tasted Shapes.\" Cytowic describes how his host reported that \"There aren't enough points on the chicken!\" and how this chance comment led to Cytowic's investigations of the neurological phenomenon of synesthesia. Early chapters include background information on how the brain is organized, drawn mainly from Paul D. MacLean's Triune Brain theory. Cytowic describes MW's synesthesia, noting the consistency of his reports, that such experiences are \"generic\" and consistent over time. Chapters dealing with more scientific theories, data and experimentation are alternated with autobiographical and more personal chapters describing the historical details of Cytowic's investigations into synesthesia. \nIn order to explore the biological basis of synesthesia, Cytowic describes experiments in which he tested how MW's synesthesia was reduced by MW's daily routine of stimulants such as nicotine and caffeine and depressants such as alcohol. In more intensive investigations of the effects of different psychoactive substances, Cytowic notes that stimulants, including a dose of amphetamine decreased the strength of MW's synesthesia, while amyl nitrite increased the strength of MW's synesthesia. For example, MW reports that mint feels like a cool glass column, but that amyl nitrite led him to feel as if he were placing his hand among many glass columns. Cytowic also summarizes work done with functional neuroimaging which showed unusually low cortical activation in MW. Based on these results, Cytowic proposes a theory in which synesthesia is a result of unusual processing in the limbic system and an overall decrease in cortical activation.\n\nIn later chapters, Cytowic reports on his efforts to make synesthesia more widely known, on the experiences of many other synesthetes who have contacted him, and how synesthesia affects their lives. Cytowic describes how an article about his work on synesthesia in the tabloid \"The National Enquirer\", a publication which is \"not known to help one's career\" led to his first contacts with synesthetes beyond MW These personal accounts of synesthesia, described here in more autobiographical style, also form the basis of Cytowic's more detailed scientific book, \"Synesthesia: A Union of the Senses.\" Additionally, Cytowic discusses the links between synesthesia and memory, as first noted in Alexander Luria's book \"The Mind of Mnemonist\" about Solomon Shereshevskii, a Russian mnemonist who also experienced fivefold synesthesia.\n\nIn the second part of the book, entitled \"Essays on the Primacy of Emotion\", Cytowic presents a number of his reflections on what the phenomenon of synesthesia means for traditional neuroscientific and neurological practice, how anomalous findings can lead to major scientific discoveries, and the role that emotion plays in our understanding of the world around us.\n\n"}

The cover protects the loads from the weather—dry cement would be very hard to unload if mixed with water in transit, while grain would be likely to rot if exposed to rain. However, they are unsuitable for perishables such as fruit or meat—these are transported in refrigerator cars, where they can be kept at low temperatures, as well. Similar to an open hopper car, covered hoppers tend to contain two to four separated bays. Each of these can be loaded and emptied individually, with access at the top to load the materials and visible chutes at the bottom for unloading.\n\nCovered hoppers in North American service have been built by most of the freight car manufacturers of the 20th century. Originally, boxcars were used for the transport of bulk materials, but these had many disadvantages. Not having been specifically designed for this, it was very hard to use any form of bulk material handling to load or unload them. Also, a large amount of product was liable to be lost, either during loading or unloading, or in transit–since the cars had to be boarded up, rather than using the doors, to enclose the products.\n\nHoppers with bays are used for different purposes; two-bay hoppers are used for the most dense loads (such as sand), while four-bay hoppers are more suited to lighter loads. This is due to axle load limits—for example, dry cement is very heavy in bulk quantities, and a four-bay hopper of sand would be very likely to exceed these limits, while also having problems with increased strain upon the central span. Therefore, by trading off cubic capacity, two-bay hoppers are able to transport these heavy loads. As technology has advanced, some of the heavier loads formerly assigned to two-bay hoppers have been assigned to larger, more efficient three-bay hoppers.\n\nLarge unit trains of various grain crops are a common sight in North America, reaching up to 125 cars long. These predominantly haul grain from the large farming areas of the Great Plains to various markets, but a number of unit trains originate from other major farming areas, such as Illinois and Indiana. These trains may originate from a single grain elevator, or may be marshaled in a yard from various locals (short trains which serve nearby industries). The destinations tend to be large flour mills or ports (for export), or they may be split up and delivered to multiple locations. The empty cars may return as a whole train, or may be sent back in smaller quantities on manifest trains (trains which carry just about any type of freight). These trains are used primarily for hauling products such as corn, wheat and barley.\n"}

Gorgon is also a member of the Royal Family of the Inhumans, a race of superpowered beings that inhabit the hidden city of Attilan.\n\nGorgon is portrayed by Eme Ikwuakor in \"Inhumans\" TV series.\n\nThe character debuted in \"Fantastic Four\" #44 (Nov. 1965) and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby.\n\nThe son of archivist Milena and architect Korath (brother of the previous king Agon), Gorgon Petragon is a cousin of king Black Bolt and a member of the Royal Family of the Inhumans. As is custom among the Inhumans, Gorgon was exposed to the Terrigen Mists as a teenager, gaining increased strength, while his feet were transformed to hooves, capable of generating highly destructive seismic waves. As an adult, Gorgon became Black Bolt's personal bodyguard and is responsible for training youths recently exposed to the Terrigen Mists in the use of their newly acquired powers and abilities.\n\nGorgon first leaves the Inhuman city of Attilan to rescue Medusa (suffering from amnesia at the time), who became lost in the outside world. This leads to a battle with the Fantastic Four, who rescued Medusa from the supervillain team the Frightful Four. After making contact with the outside world, Gorgon and the rest of the Royal Family have several encounters with the Fantastic Four over the years, seeking their aid against foes such as Black Bolt's brother Maximus, Psycho-Man, and the Sphinx.\n\nWith several other Inhumans, Gorgon also battles the master villain Mandarin, helps free Maximus, journeys to America to search for the missing Black Bolt, and battles Magneto. Over the years, and with continued exposure to the outside world, Gorgon has many adventures, usually taking place in the company of fellow members of the Royal Family.\n\nSignificant moments for Gorgon include defying the Attilan Genetics Council and helping to hide the pregnant Medusa (with Black Bolt's child) on Earth; and arguing with Black Bolt over the use of Alpha Primitives as slaves. He leads an Inhuman force down to Earth to gain the return of the Terrigen Mists. This goes badly as many human captives are slain by an impatient Inhuman named Jolen. This sparks a war between Earth and the Inhumans, and Gorgon is captured. He is subjected to the Terrigen Mists again. This amplifies Gorgon's powers and change him into a true beast with a lion-like head, claws, and uncontrollable rages. As with the other Inhumans, he leaves the Moon to assist them in taking over the Kree empire. He is later seen with his more humanoid appearance.\n\nIn the \"Inhuman\" storyline, he is shot in the spine by NuHuman named Lineage, he is paralyzed waist down and cannot use his powers.\n\nAs part of the \"All-New, All-Different Marvel\", Gorgon joined the diplomatic mission created by Medusa to oversee the diplomatic relations and handle the recovery efforts of the newly transformed Inhumans. During this time, Gorgon rode around in a special wheelchair. His paralysis is later cured by NuHuman Panacea.\n\nDuring the \"Inhumans vs. X-Men\" storyline, Gorgon and Crystal are ambushed by Magneto.\n\nGorgon's superhuman powers are a result of exposure to the mutagenic Terrigen Mist. Gorgon now has bull's legs and hooves and can create intense shockwaves equivalent to a powerful earthquake. He also possesses enhanced strength and durability, although like all Inhumans he has a weaker immune system than that of an average human.\n\nGorgon was exposed to Terrigen Mists a second time by Pentagon officials. He then appeared larger and stronger and behaved more brutishly. These changes gradually faded.\n\nIn \"Amalgam Comics\", Big Gorgon – a combination of DC Comics' Big Bear and Marvel's Gorgon – is a member of the superhero group the Un-People in the Amalgam Comics universe.\n\nIn \"Earth X\", like many of his fellow Inhumans, the Gorgon of Earth X has undergone a further mutation and possesses the head of a bull.\n\nIn \"Marvel Zombies\", the first time the zombified Gorgon is seen, he is part of a horde of super-zombies attempting to eat the last few known humans left on Earth. They fail; the humans are safely escorted to another reality. Later, it is seen that the entire Inhuman Royal Family has been zombified and has traveled to Kingpin's domain to eat of his human clones. Machine Man attacks and Gorgon tries to retaliate by stamping the ground, but his leg instantly falls off.\n\nIn the \"Ultimate Marvel\" reality, Gorgon is female (the sister of Medusa and Crystal) and possesses the added ability to hypnotize people.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1894873", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1894873", "title": "Eye movement", "text": "Eye movement\n\nEye movement includes the voluntary or involuntary movement of the eyes, helping in acquiring, fixating and tracking visual stimuli. A special type of eye movement, rapid eye movement, occurs during REM sleep.\n\nThe eyes are the visual organs of the human body, and move using a system of six muscles. The retina, a specialised type of tissue containing photoreceptors, senses light. These specialised cells convert light into electrochemical signals. These signals travel along the optic nerve fibers to the brain, where they are interpreted as vision in the visual cortex.\n\nPrimates and many other vertebrates use three types of voluntary eye movement to track objects of interest: smooth pursuit, vergence shifts and saccades. These types of movements appear to be initiated by a small cortical region in the brain's frontal lobe. This is corroborated by removal of the frontal lobe. In this case, the reflexes (such as reflex shifting the eyes to a moving light) are intact, though the voluntary control is obliterated.\n\nSix extraocular muscles facilitate eye movement. These muscles arise from the common tendinous ring in the orbit, the eye cavity, and attach to the eyeball. The six muscles are the lateral, medial, inferior and superior rectus muscles, and the inferior and superior oblique muscles. The muscles, when contracting, cause movement of the eyeball, by pulling the eyeball towards the muscle. For example, the lateral rectus is on the lateral side of the eyeball. When it contracts, the eyeball moves so that the pupil looks outwards. The medial rectus causes the eyeball to look inwards; the inferior rectus downwards and the superior rectus upwards. The superior oblique muscle and inferior oblique muscle attach at angles to the eyeball.\n\nMost muscles not only move the eye in a cardinal direction, but also slightly rotate the pupil.\n\nThe muscles are supplied by the oculomotor nerve, with the exception of the superior oblique, which is supplied by the trochlear nerve, and the lateral rectus, supplied by the abducens nerve.\n\nThree antagonistic pairs of muscles control eye movement: the lateral and medial rectus muscles, the superior and inferior rectus muscles, and the superior and inferior oblique muscles. These muscles are responsible for movement of the eye along three different axes: horizontal, either toward the nose (adduction) or away from the nose (abduction); vertical, either elevation or depression; and torsional, movements that bring the top of the eye toward the nose (intorsion) or away from the nose (extorsion). Horizontal movement is controlled entirely by the medial and lateral rectus muscles; the medial rectus muscle is responsible for adduction, the lateral rectus muscle for abduction. Vertical movement requires the coordinated action of the superior and inferior rectus muscles, as well as the oblique muscles. The relative contribution of the rectus and oblique groups depends on the horizontal position of the eye. In the primary position (eyes straight ahead), both of these groups contribute to vertical movement. Elevation is due to the action of the superior rectus and inferior oblique muscles, while depression is due to the action of the inferior rectus and superior oblique muscles. When the eye is abducted, the rectus muscles are the prime vertical movers. Elevation is due to the action of the superior rectus, and depression is due to the action of the inferior rectus. When the eye is adducted, the oblique muscles are the prime vertical movers. Elevation is due to the action of the inferior oblique muscle, while depression is due to the action of the superior oblique muscle. The oblique muscles are also primarily responsible for torsional movement.\n\nThe brain exerts ultimate control over both voluntary and involuntary eye movement. Three cranial nerves carry signals from the brain to control the extraocular muscles. These are the oculomotor nerve, which controls the majority of the muscles, the trochlear nerve, which controls the superior oblique muscle, and the abducens nerve, which controls the lateral rectus muscle.\n\nIn addition to the movement of muscles, numerous areas in the brain contribute to involuntary and voluntary eye movement. These include providing the conscious perception of vision, as well as areas that facilitate tracking.\n\n\nEye movement can be classified according to several systems:\n\n\"Vergence movement\" or convergence is the movement of both eyes to make sure that the image of the object being looked at falls on the corresponding spot on both retinas. This type of movement helps in the depth perception of objects\n\n\"Pursuit movement\" or smooth pursuit is the movement the eyes make while tracking an object's movement, so that its moving image can remain maintained on fovea.\n\nThe eyes are never completely at rest: they make frequent fixational eye movement even when fixated at one point. The reason for this movement is related to the photoreceptors and the ganglion cells. It appears that a constant visual stimulus can make the photoreceptors or the ganglion cells become unresponsive; on the other hand a changing stimulus will not. So the eye movement constantly changes the stimuli that fall on the photoreceptors and the ganglion cells, making the image clearer.\n\nSaccades are the rapid movement of eyes that is used while scanning a visual scene. In our subjective impression, the eyes do not move smoothly across the printed page during reading. Instead, they make short and rapid movements called \"saccades\". During each \"saccade\" the eyes move as fast as they can and the speed cannot be consciously controlled in between the fixations. Each movement is worth a few minutes of arc, at regular intervals about three to four per second. One of the main uses for saccades is to scan a greater area with the high-resolution fovea of the eye. Research conducted by the University of South Australia in partnership with the University of Stuttgart has revealed the relationship between eye moment and personality traits that AI can read.\n\nThe visual system in the brain is too slow to process that information if the images are slipping across the retina at more than a few degrees per second. Thus, to be able to see while we are moving, the brain must compensate for the motion of the head by turning the eyes. Another specialisation of visual system in many vertebrate animals is the development of a small area of the retina with a very high visual acuity. This area is called the fovea, and covers about 2 degrees of visual angle in people. To get a clear view of the world, the brain must turn the eyes so that the image of the object of regard falls on the fovea. Eye movement is thus very important for visual perception, and any failure can lead to serious visual disabilities. To see a quick demonstration of this fact, try the following experiment: hold your hand up, about one foot (30 cm) in front of your nose. Keep your head still, and shake your hand from side to side, slowly at first, and then faster and faster. At first you will be able to see your fingers quite clearly. But as the frequency of shaking passes about 1 Hz, the fingers will become a blur. Now, keep your hand still, and shake your head (up and down or left and right). No matter how fast you shake your head, the image of your fingers remains clear. This demonstrates that the brain can move the eyes opposite to head motion much better than it can follow, or pursue, a hand movement. When your pursuit system fails to keep up with the moving hand, images slip on the retina and you see a blurred hand.\n\nThe brain must point both eyes accurately enough that the object of regard falls on corresponding points of the two retinas to avoid the perception of double vision. In most vertebrates (humans, mammals, reptiles, birds), the movement of different body parts is controlled by striated muscles acting around joints. The movement of the eye is slightly different in that the eyes are not rigidly attached to anything, but are held in the orbit by six extraocular muscles.\n\n\nWhen reading, the eye moves continuously along a line of text, but makes short rapid movements (saccades) intermingled with short stops (fixations). There is considerable variability in fixations (the point at which a saccade jumps to) and saccades between readers and even for the same person reading a single passage of text.\n\nEye movement in music reading is the scanning of a musical score by a musician's eyes. This usually occurs as the music is read during performance, although musicians sometimes scan music silently to study it, and sometimes perform from memory without score. Eye movement in music reading may at first appear to be similar to that in language reading, since in both activities the eyes move over the page in fixations and saccades, picking up and processing coded meanings. However, music is nonlinguistic and involves a strict and continuous time constraint on an output that is generated by a continuous stream of coded instructions.\n\nEye movement in scene viewing refers to the visual processing of information presented in scenes. A core aspect of studies in this area is the division of eye movements into the rapid movement of the eyes (saccades), and the focus of the eyes on a point (fixations). Several factors can influence eye movement in scene viewing, including the task and knowledge of the viewer (top-down factors), and the properties of the image being viewed (bottom-up factors).\nTypically, when presented with a scene, viewers demonstrate short fixation durations and long saccade amplitudes in the earlier phases of viewing an image. This is followed by longer fixations and shorter saccades in the latter phases of scene viewing processing. It has also been found that eye movement behaviour in scene viewing differs with levels of cognitive development - fixation durations are thought to shorten and saccade amplitudes lengthen with an increase in age.\n\nWhere eye movements fixate is affected by both bottom-up and top-down factors. Even an initial glimpse of a scene has an influence on subsequent eye movements.\nIn bottom-up factors, the local contrast or prominence of features in an image, such as a large contrast in luminance or a greater density of edges, can affect the guidance of eye movements.\nHowever, the top-down factors of scenes have a greater impact in where eyes fixate. Areas containing more meaningful features, or areas where colour aids the discrimination of objects, can influence eye movements. Images which are related to previous images shown can also have an effect.\nEye movements can also be guided towards items when they are heard verbally at the same time as seeing them.\nCross-culturally, it has been found that Westerners have an inclination to concentrate on focal objects in a scene, whereas East Asians attend more to contextual information.\n\nAverage fixation durations last for about 330 ms, although there is a large variability in this approximation. This variability is mostly due to the properties of an image and in the task being carried out, which impact both bottom-up and top-down processing.\nThe masking of an image and other degradations, such as a decrease in luminance, during fixations (factors which affect bottom-up processing), have been found to increase the length of fixation durations. However, an enhancement of the image with these factors also increases fixation durations.\nFactors which affect top-down processing (e.g. blurring) have been found to both increase and decrease fixation durations.\n\n\n\n\nThe following terms may be used to describe eye movement:\n\n\n"}

The road begins at the Schuylkill Expressway in Fairmount Park, running as a freeway also known as the Roosevelt Boulevard Extension or the Roosevelt Expressway through North Philadelphia, then transitioning into a twelve-lane divided highway that forms the spine of Northeast Philadelphia to its end at the city line.\n\nHistorically, Roosevelt Boulevard is a part of the Lincoln Highway, the first road across America, which ran for from Times Square in New York City to Lincoln Park on the Pacific Ocean in San Francisco, California.\n\nToday, Roosevelt Boulevard is designated as US 1 (north of the Roosevelt Expressway), US 13 (between Hunting Park Avenue and Robbins Street), and Pennsylvania Route 63 (between Red Lion and Woodhaven Roads).\n\nThe road is notorious for two intersections which have been designated the second and third most dangerous intersections in the country by State Farm Insurance, at Red Lion Road and Grant Avenue respectively. The dangerous reputation of the road led to installation of the first red light cameras in Philadelphia in 2004. The road has been the scene of numerous pedestrian casualties and studies are underway to allow pedestrian traffic to be separated from vehicular traffic.\n\nThe Roosevelt Boulevard Extension, also known as the Roosevelt Expressway, begins at the Schuylkill Expressway in Fairmount Park adjacent to the Philadelphia city line, as an expressway also known as the Roosevelt Boulevard Expressway U.S. Route 1. It crosses the Schuylkill River via the Twin Bridges and runs eastward through the neighborhoods of East Falls and Hunting Park. The Roosevelt Expressway interchanges with Broad Street (Pennsylvania Route 611) and ends at an interchange with US 13 (Roosevelt Boulevard), at which point US 1 merges onto the Roosevelt Boulevard and continues northeast along with US 13.\n\nThe Roosevelt Boulevard begins at an intersection with Hunting Park Avenue, continuing northeast as a part of US 13. The road crosses Broad Street (PA 611) before US 1 (Roosevelt Expressway) merges in at an interchange and Roosevelt Boulevard becomes a 12-lane surface arterial with local and express lanes and at-grade intersections, carrying US 1 and US 13.\n\nThe road continues east through Hunting Park and Feltonville, where it curves and starts running in a northeasterly direction. It meets Oxford Avenue (Pennsylvania Route 232) at a large traffic circle known as Oxford Circle (the express lanes pass through the circle via an underpass). The road carries northbound U.S. Route 13 one more mile until it splits off onto Robbins Street and Levick Street (both one-way streets). The road continues to a large interchange with Cottman Avenue (Pennsylvania Route 73) and the Roosevelt Mall. The traffic circle with Holme and Solly Avenues known as the Pennypack Circle was rebuilt and no longer exists. There is access to both Solly and Holme Avenues from the local lanes both north and south bound. It continues past Pennypack Park and Northeast Philadelphia Airport, passing through two notoriously dangerous intersections with Grant Avenue and Red Lion Road.\n\nThe road continues northeast, interchanging with Woodhaven Road (Pennsylvania Route 63), then narrowing as it approaches its end at an intersection on the Philadelphia-Bucks County border. After 2 traffic light intersections in Trevose in Bensalem Township, U.S. 1 continues as a freeway to the north.\n\nSeveral SEPTA City Bus routes operate along portions of Roosevelt Boulevard, with routes , and following the boulevard for a significant distance. The Route 1 bus runs along the entire length of Roosevelt Boulevard as part of its route between 54th Street and City Avenue in West Philadelphia and Parx Casino and Racing in Bensalem. The Route 14 bus follows Roosevelt Boulevard north of Bustleton Avenue as part of its route between the Frankford Transportation Center to the south and the Neshaminy Mall and Oxford Valley Mall to the north. The Route R bus follows Roosevelt Boulevard south of Pratt Street as part of its route between the Wissahickon Transportation Center and the Frankford Transportation Center. The portion of Roosevelt Boulevard north of Bustleton Avenue is also served by the Boulevard Direct, a limited-stop bus route between the Frankford Transportation Center and the Neshaminy Mall. The Boulevard Direct offers improved travel times compared to traditional bus service along Route 14, with more frequent service and several bus stops located on the far side of intersections to improve performance.\n\nThe Roosevelt Boulevard Subway is a proposed SEPTA subway line that would run along Roosevelt Boulevard. The route was first proposed in 1913 as part of the Broad Street Subway line from Adams Avenue. Its construction has been considered at a variety of points in Philadelphia's history. Last studied in detail in 2003, a plethora of alignments and construction options were considered; including within the median of a highway that would replace the Boulevard, an alternate route that would follow and replace the current Fox Chase Line of SEPTA Regional Rail, and an at grade route that would function similarly to the city's subway-surface network. A largely underground alignment under the Boulevard was chosen that would have left the current Broad Street Line at Erie, using an already extant flying junction with the express tracks. It would have then tunneled to Roosevelt Boulevard and been constructed cut and cover until Blue Grass road near the northern edge of Philadelphia. From there its would have been on an elevated structure until almost reaching the county line. Additionally a cut and cover extension of the Market-Frankford Line was to be constructed under Bustleton Avenue until intersecting with the Boulevard. Cost estimates ranged between $2.5 and $3.4 billion in year 2000 dollars. Largely dependent on if constructing all stations in open cuts, rather than strictly underground, was feasible. It was estimated to draw 124,523 daily boardings, approximately the current ridership of the Broad Street Line, and divert 83,300 daily automobile trips. The project however did not move forward due to lack of local financing. \n\nAlternatively, an enhanced bus route similar to Pittsburgh's Martin Luther King Jr. East Busway (a BRT system) could also be implemented in its place.\n\nProposed in 1903 by Mayor Samuel H. Ashbridge as part of the City Beautiful movement, the 300-foot-wide thoroughfare originally extended from Broad Street to the Torresdale neighborhood, and was first named Torresdale Boulevard, then Northeast Boulevard in 1914 when the road was completed. On its extension to Pennypack Creek in 1918, it was finally renamed to Roosevelt Boulevard, in honor of Theodore Roosevelt. The road was designated U.S. 1 in 1926, and was extended through Philadelphia to neighboring Bucks County in the post-World War II years.\n\nThe Roosevelt Expressway was built to connect the boulevard with the nearby Schuylkill Expressway (I-76).\n\nIn 1998 a series of gang-related criminal rock throwing attacks on cars driving near Ridge Avenue, Henry Avenue and Fox Street \"terrorized\" Philadelphia drivers.\n\nIn 2000, by act of the state legislature, the Boulevard was designated the \"Police Officer Daniel Faulkner Memorial Highway\" in memory of Daniel Faulkner, a Philadelphia police officer whom Mumia Abu-Jamal was convicted of having slain in the line of duty in 1981. The designation is alongside the roadway's official name of Roosevelt Boulevard.\n\nThere have been several plans to change the boulevard into an expressway-like artery, like the Roosevelt Expressway itself, and construct a subway underneath the boulevard, but no such plans have been acted upon.\n\nToday, Roosevelt Boulevard is among the most congested arteries in the country. According to a 2001 report by State Farm Insurance, the second- and third-worst intersections in the country are both found on the Boulevard, at Red Lion Road and Grant Avenue, respectively, only a mile apart from each other. Red light cameras have been installed at these intersections, as well as Cottman Avenue, and have been operational since June 1, 2005. New cameras installed at the intersections with 9th Street, Mascher Street, Levick Street, Rhawn Street, Welsh Road, and Southampton Road became operational in summer 2007. Additional plans include adding cameras at Devereaux Avenue and Tyson Avenue. On June 1, 2020, speed cameras were activated along Roosevelt Boulevard, with a 60-day warning period before fines are issued.\n\nThe entire route is in Philadelphia, Philadelphia County.\n\n\n"}

During the succession crisis in the 15th century, Shinkurō became associated with the Imagawa clan via the marriage of his sister to the Imagawa head, who led an army to Kyoto. Through this relationship Shinkurō quickly established a base of power in Kantō.\n\nHis son wanted his lineage to have a more illustrious name, and chose Hōjō, after the line of regents of the Kamakura shogunate, to which his wife also belonged. So he became Hōjō Ujitsuna, and his father, Ise Shinkurō, was posthumously renamed Hōjō Sōun.\n\nThe Late Hōjō, sometimes known as the Odawara Hōjō after their home castle of Odawara in Sagami Province, were not related to the earlier Hōjō clan.

L. \"Fatman\" McCabe is a Hawaii-born, tough former HPD officer turned Los Angeles district attorney. He is teamed with a handsome, happy-go-lucky special investigator named Jake Styles. They often clash due to their different styles and personalities. \"Fatman\" hardly travels anywhere without Max, his pet bulldog. The show was set in Los Angeles during the first season. After the end of \"Magnum, P.I.\", the show was moved to Hawaii. The second and third seasons and half of the fourth season were filmed in Honolulu.

It is an industrial city in an area where coal mining is an important industry. The entire city has a population of 2.2 million.\n\nThe presence of such a large coal industry has given Jincheng a reputation for air pollution and in recent years the local government has invested heavily to promote better air quality in the city. This includes tree-planting, establishing and maintaining large parks and ecological reserves, shutting down or relocating some of the worst-polluting factories, and the generalized use of coalbed methane which burns much cleaner than coal.\n\nJincheng has a long history. During the Warring States period, Zhao, Wei and han divided the land of Jinguo and settled the Late Jin monarch in Qinshui County of Jincheng. At the end of the Warring States period, the famous battle of Changping broke out between Qin and Zhao, which was in Gaoping City of Jincheng. After the first emperor of Qin unified the six countries, China was divided into 36 Shire , and most of Jincheng and Southeast Shanxi belonged to ShangdangShire . After the Han Dynasty and the Wei Dynasty, Jincheng has always belonged to Shangdang Shire and Pingyang Shire . To the Sixteen States, West Yan Murong Yong set up JianxingShire in the south of ShangdangShire , which is also the beginning of Jincheng becoming a Shire today. After that, Jianxing Shire changed its name several times. It was changed to Jianzhou in the Northern Wei Dynasty, and then to Zezhou in the Sui Dynasty, until it was upgraded to Zezhoufu in the Qing Dynasty. They are basically consistent with the five counties under the jurisdiction of Jincheng today. Until the period of the Republic of China, Yuan Shikai issued a policy to change all Chinese State into counties.\n\nJincheng is located in the southeast corner of Shanxi province. The prefecture-level city covers an area of 9,490-square-kilometers. It has 188,920 hectares of cultivated land.\n\nJincheng has a rather dry, monsoon-influenced humid continental climate (Köppen \"Dwa\"), with cold and very dry winters, and hot, humid summers. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from in January to in July, and the annual mean is . Typifying the influence of the East Asian Monsoon, over tow-thirds of the annual of precipitation occurs from June to September.\n\nJincheng has considerable mineral resources, notably coal. Coal-beds account for more than 56% of the total area. Most of this is anthracite, a very valuable type of coal with few impurities. The anthracite in Jincheng makes up more than a quarter of the total in China and half of the total for Shanxi province. Jincheng also has a large coal mine methane field which was discovered in Qinshui county in 2001.\n\nBoth anthracite and coal mine methane were mainly produced by Jincheng Anthracite Mining Group.\n\nJingcheng also has a major Foxconn manufacturing campus which is known for production of over 3 billion RMB / year of fiber optic parts.\n\n\nJincheng does not have a commercial airport, although the nearby cities of Zhengzhou, Changzhi and Luoyang do.\n\n"}

It was ported to the Apple II, Atari 5200, Atari 8-bit family, ColecoVision, Commodore 64, MSX, and ZX Spectrum. \nThe player uses a helicopter backpack and other tools to rescue victims trapped deep in a mine. The mine is made up of multiple screens using a flip screen style.\n\nSega released a version of the game for its SG-1000 console in Japan in 1985. While the gameplay was identical, Sega changed the backpack from a helicopter to a jetpack.\n\nThe player assumes control of Roderick Hero (sometimes styled as \"R. Hero\"), a one-man rescue team. Miners working in Mount Leone are trapped, and it's up to Roderick to reach them.\n\nThe player is equipped with a backpack-mounted helicopter unit, which allows him to hover and fly, along with a helmet-mounted laser and a limited supply of dynamite. Each level consists of a maze of mine shafts that Roderick must safely navigate in order to reach the miner trapped at the bottom. The backpack has a limited amount of power, so the player must reach the miner before the power supply is exhausted, in which the player restarts the level from the beginning if that happens.\n\nMine shafts may be blocked by cave-ins or magma, which require dynamite to clear. The helmet laser can also destroy cave-ins, but far more slowly than dynamite. Unlike a cave-in, magma is lethal when touched. Later levels include walls of magma with openings that alternate between open and closed requiring skillful navigation. The mine shafts are populated by spiders, bats and other unknown creatures that are deadly to the touch; these creatures can be destroyed using the laser or dynamite.\n\nSome deep mines are flooded, forcing players to hover safely above the water. In later levels, monsters strike out from below the water. Some mine sections are illuminated by lanterns. If the lantern is somehow destroyed, the layout of that section becomes invisible. Exploding dynamite lights up the mine for a brief time.\n\nPoints are scored for each cave-in cleared and each creature destroyed. When the player reaches the miner, points are awarded for the rescue, along with the amount of power remaining in the backpack and for each remaining stick of dynamite. Extra lives are awarded for every 20,000 points scored.\n\nIn a review of the ColecoVision port, \"Electronic Games\" wrote, \"Activision has wisely used the superior graphics of the CV units to provide a breathtaking underground panorama,\" and concluded, \"Congrats Activision! \"H.E.R.O.\" is a real champion.\"\n\nIn the June 1987 issue of \"Zzap!64\", Julian Rignall wrote—of the C64 version—\"\"HERO\" looks awful, sounds terrible but plays absolutely beautifully.\"\n\n\"H.E.R.O.\" is included in the retrogaming compilation \"Activision Anthology\".\n\nIn 1985, \"ANALOG Computing\" published a clone called \"R.O.T.O.\" for the Atari 8-bit family.\n\n"}

The valley begins on the northern rim of the Argyre basin, and cuts through several craters, before ending at Holden crater.\n\nUzboi Vallis is believed to have been formed by running water. It is believed that layers were formed on the floor of Uzboi Vallis (as shown in the HiRISE image below) when drainage was blocked by the impact that formed Holden Crater to the north. Eventually the lake in the area of Uzboi Vallis went high enough to overtop the rim of Holden. The water then eroded the deposits to expose the layers as they are today. The sediments that make up the layers appear to be coarse in size, suggesting they were probably formed by a rapid flow.\n\nIt has been suggested that Uzboi, Ladon, Margaritifer and Ares Valles, although now separated by large craters, once comprised a single outflow channel flowing north into Chryse Planitia. The source of this outflow has been suggested as overflow from the Argyre crater, formerly filled to the brim as a lake by channels (Surius, Dzigai, and Palacopus Valles) draining down from the south pole.

The first of the \"X\" series, it is a space trading and combat simulator game, mostly set in the fictional X-Universe. Upon release, it was frequently compared to the older Elite.\n\nAn expansion, X-Tension, was released in 2000. Four full sequels have since followed: \"\" in 2003, \"\" in 2005, \"\" in 2008 and \"\" in 2018. \"X: Beyond the Frontier\" and \"X-Tension\" were released in together as \"X-Gold\" in 2000. A novel, \"Farnham's Legend\", is based on the plot of \"X: Beyond the Frontier\".\n\nSet in the year 2912, in the 30th Century, the player takes the role of Kyle Brennan, an Earth test pilot for the \"X-Shuttle\", better known as the \"X-Perimental Shuttle\", which has the ability to jump from one part of the universe to another via a wormhole without requiring a jumpgate.\n\nDuring the test jump, something goes drastically wrong and Brennan ends up in an unknown part of space. He encounters an alien race, the Teladi, a highly capitalist, profit-focused culture. Finding Kyle helpless, they repair his ship and loan him some money. They also give hints on trading in the X Universe, and may tell him (if he asks) about the Argon and other alien races in the X-Universe. The X Universe is a network of sectors linked by jumpgates. With his jumpdrive destroyed, and no idea how to return to Earth, Brennan finds himself stranded, alone and indebted to an alien race.\n\nThe player is free to choose how to continue the game, and if or when to pursue the main plot.\n\nThrough trade and exploration, Brennan eventually encounters the Argon—a race who appear human. However, it quickly becomes clear that the Argon have no knowledge of Earth, and most dismiss Brennan as a crank when he claims to be from Earth.\n\nHe is subsequently led to a group of scientists and scholars known as the Goner, which is an organisation dedicated to preserving information about Earth. He works with them to discover the forgotten history of the Argon - that they are descended from humans who were cut off from Earth centuries ago in a war with rogue machines known as the Terraformers. After convincing the Argon that Earth is real, Brennan works with them - specifically, with Ban Danna, Head of the Argon Secret service - to prevent the Terraformers, now known as the Xenon, from developing a super-weapon.\n\nDepending on his status with the different X-Universe races, Brennan finally forms an alliance to attack the Xenon forces and destroy their super-weapon, thus completing the game. However Kyle is stranded in the new sector of the Galaxy unable to return to earth, the Argon federation welcome him into their ranks and offer him the means to make himself comfortable in his new home.\n\nThere are fifty-four star systems in the X Universe, and within each one there are numerous installations. There is at least one space station in each system, and they range from ordinary factories like solar power plants to shipyards. By trading with them the player makes a profit, which allows one to upgrade the X-Perimental Shuttle with new weapons, better shields, and increased cargo space.\n\nIt is possible to trade within a single system, but the player can earn credits much quicker by exploring other systems via the jump gates. Eventually, the player will be able to buy factories and thus earn much greater income.\n\nAlthough each system has at least one planet, it is not possible to land on any of them. Factories, space stations, and other installations are located far from the planets and stars.\n\n\"X: Beyond the Frontier\" received \"average\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.\n\nThe game was praised for its open-ended gameplay and the large number of systems to explore. The economy in the X Universe is dynamic, with the price of goods varying with supply and demand. For example, selling a large amount of one particular product to a single station will result in the price for further consignments dropping in proportion to their demand.\n\nThe atmospheric musical score of the game was also praised, as was the varied dialogue one can have with many different aliens. However, several reviews complained that the voice acting, while atmospheric, was hard to understand and could make it difficult to follow the plot.\n\nThe game was also praised highly for its \"spectacular background graphics\", such as \"gorgeous colored lighting effects and the highly detailed rotating planets\".\n\nHowever, the game received criticism from some for giving the player so little equipment to start with. For example, the X-Perimental loses its weapons in the accident that brings it to the X Universe. These can be purchased once the player acquires sufficient credits to do so. Until then, the player is defenseless. The ship is also quite slow, and traveling between installations at first takes a long time. A time-accelerator device reduces the transit time, but it needs to be found and purchased, which means the game moves at a frustrating \"snail's pace [for] the first 10-20 minutes\". Still, \"[a]fter as little as an hour of gameplay, with some shrewd trading... you should be able to outfit your X ship with a pair of lasers ... and the time-accelerating 'singularity time distortion engine,'\" said one review\n\nThe combat system was lightly criticized as \"being more of a goal to be overcome than a challenge to be relished\", especially given the \"suicidal as hell\" \"kamikaze\" nature of enemy pilots, who appear constantly to wish to ram the player. A final criticism was the game's \"skimpy manual\", which leaves the player to work out most things for themselves. However, others felt \"the documentation was extremely well done\" and that \"the game actually uses your complete ignorance of what's going on around you to add a sense of adventure and mystery to the tale.\"\n\n\"X-Tension\" (2000) was released as an expansion to \"Beyond the Frontier\"; however, many gamers and reviewers consider it more a \"sequel\" than an \"add-on\". It follows on after the story in \"Beyond the Frontier\", with \"the evil Xenon vanquished\" and the player \"still stranded light years from home.\" The player once again takes control of Kyle Brennan, who now has \"time to kill\" as his X-perimental ship is reverse-engineered. The player is given a ship, some credits, and left to make his own way in the X Universe. In a canon aspect, the events of this game would be assumed to see the player start a business empire, which would become Terracorp in the .\n\nThere is no overarching plot in \"X-Tension\". It is an open-ended, sandbox game, filled with \"microquests\". The player is free to choose \"to be a trader with an unarmed Argon Lifter... or a bounty-hunter ... armed to the teeth with plasma throwers.\"; free to choose \"where [they] want to go, what to trade in and who to pick on\". Egosoft's Managing Director, Bernd Lehahn, described \"X-Tension\" as \"[a] space game that allows you to live freely in a virtual universe and do whatever you want to do. At least that's our goal.\"\n\nThe graphics were improved for \"X-Tension\", adding new effects and scenery, and removing \"visible seams which blighted many of these backdrops in the original game.\". The musical score was also extended, and the X Universe was expanded to a total of ninety systems.\n\n\"X-Tension\" addressed many criticisms of the original game. The player's craft is pre-equipped with some upgrades - weapons and a time-accelerator - so that players can defend themselves from the beginning, although the weapons you start out with are useless against most of enemy ships. The player can leave the ship and space walk in a space suit, purchase new ships from shipyards, and even capture enemy ships that can be flown by the player.\n\nThe in-game interface was expanded to include new features, including an automatic navigation system that allows the player \"to easily access information about any sectors\" visited, and includes \"a full map of the galaxy showing everywhere you have been.\" When combined with some upgrades and equipment, this system allows the player to monitor the X-Universe's economy, traffic and prices remotely, \"an incredibly useful new feature which makes trading far less hit and miss than it was in the original game.\" The interface also allows the players to control many of their assets - factories and ship tasks - remotely. They no longer need to land at a factory to adjust it, nor even to be in same region of space.\n\nOne criticism shared by both games was the combat system; while improved in \"X-Tension\", it could still be summed up as \"unremarkable.\" Notably, Egosoft's Managing Director, Bernd Lehahn, mentioned appealing to \"the 'Wing Commander audience'\" as a high priority in the design of 2005 sequel \"X: Reunion\". He defined this as \"people who... expect a story and cool fighting missions\" but who may be won over to \"the freeform gameplay and the advantages that a realistic economy adds to such a game.\"\n\nThe extension pack received \"favorable\" reviews, although no aggregate score exists.\n\n\n"}

It was called \"Six-Five Special\" because of the time it was broadcast – it went out live at five past six on Saturday evening. It began immediately after the abolition of the Toddlers' Truce, which had seen television close between 6pm and 7pm so children could be put to bed.\n\nJack Good was the original producer. Josephine Douglas and (initially) disc jockey Pete Murray were its presenters, with Murray using the catchphrase \"Time to jive on the old six five\". Its resident band was Don Lang and his Frantic Five. The show opened with film of a steam train accompanied by the programme's theme song, played and sung by the Bob Cort Skiffle Group, which began with the words \"The Six-Five Special's comin' down the line, The Six-Five Special's right on time ...\"\n\nBBC executives originally wanted a magazine format; however, Good wanted a show with music and lots of movement. The original sets were dispensed with and the empty studio space filled with the milling audience and performers. Television at that time was completely live as recording technology was limited, so once the programme started everything ran in an impromptu way. The running order was sketched out on Friday morning, and then only one complete run-through happened immediately before transmission on Saturday evening.\n\nThe show was originally scheduled to last just six weeks but, as a result of its popularity, the series became open-ended. The BBC interfered with Good's vision of the show by including educational and information elements, which Good wanted to drop, as they diluted the music. The relationship between Good and the BBC became strained, and he resigned in early 1958.\n\nGood joined the ITV company ABC to create \"Oh Boy!\", the show he'd wanted to make. It featured non-stop music and lost the public-service-inspired elements as part of its more frenzied pace, trouncing \"Six-Five Special\" in the ratings. The BBC, never keen on the show, took this as vindication and pulled it from the schedules. It was to be half a decade before \"Top of the Pops\" restored BBC coverage of contemporary popular music in general and \"pop\" in particular.\n\nAmong the artists on the show were Petula Clark, Jim Dale, Johnny Dankworth, Terry Dene, Lonnie Donegan, Russ Hamilton, Cleo Laine, Joan Regan, Finlay Currie, boxer Freddie Mills, Wee Willie Harris, Jimmy Lloyd, Marty Wilde, the Dallas Boys and Tommy Steele.\n\nComedy performers included Trevor Peacock, who was also a script writer for the show, Spike Milligan and Bernie Winters.\n\nA spin-off film was released in 1958, scripted by Norman Hudis and directed by Alfred Shaughnessy. It centred around a young woman's quest for stardom - she was played by up-and-coming musical star Diane Todd. It featured performances from Lonnie Donegan, Dickie Valentine, Jim Dale, Petula Clark, Russ Hamilton and Joan Regan, among others, and featured comic relief from Mike and Bernie Winters.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1894931", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1894931", "title": "Plymouth Breakwater", "text": "Plymouth Breakwater\n\nPlymouth Breakwater is a stone breakwater protecting Plymouth Sound and the anchorages near Plymouth, Devon, England. It is wide at the top and the base is . It lies in about of water. Around 4 million tons of rock were used in its construction in 1812 at the then-colossal cost of £1.5 million (equivalent to £ today).\n\nIn 1806, as the Napoleonic Wars impended, Lord St. Vincent commissioned John Rennie and Joseph Whidbey to plan a means of making Plymouth Bay a safe anchorage for the Channel Fleet. In 1811 came the order to begin construction; Whidbey was appointed Acting Superintending Engineer. This task required great engineering, organizational and political skills, as the many strictly technical challenges were complicated by the significant resources devoted to the project, from which various parties evidenced a desire for advantage. Nearly 4,000,000 (four million) tons of stone were quarried and transported, using about a dozen ships innovatively designed by the two engineers. A paper to the Royal Society suggests that Whidbey found many fossils as a result of the quarrying necessary to the breakwater.\n\nThe foundation stone was laid on Shovel Rock on August 8, 1812. It followed a line over Panther Rock, Shovel and St. Carlos Rocks, and was sufficiently completed by 1814 to shelter ships of the line. Napoleon was reported as commenting that the breakwater was a grand thing, as he passed by it on the way to exile on St. Helena in 1815. Severe storm damage in 1817 and 1824 prompted a change in the profile and height. John Rennie died in 1821; his last work in connection with the breakwater was to draw up proposals for a lighthouse. Whidbey continued to work on the breakwater and other engineering projects, including the breakwater's lighthouse, until retirement around 1830; the work was completed by Rennie's sons, George and Sir John.\n\nPlymouth Breakwater Lighthouse stands on the western tip of the breakwater. Designed for the Admiralty by Walker & Burgess, construction of the granite tower began on 22 February 1841 and was completed on November 9th 1843; William Stuart was superintendent of the works. The light became operational in June 1844; soon afterwards a horse-drawn omnibus was driven along the breakwater from end to end, with a full complement of passengers accompanied by a military band. On completion, management of the light was transferred to Trinity House.\n\nA beacon was placed at the eastern end of the breakwater, consisting of a spherical cage on a pole; the cage was designed as a refuge for six shipwrecked sailors.\n\nThe lighthouse had been provided with a second-order catadioptric lens array by Henry Lepaute of Paris; it showed a fixed red light with a white sector indicating an anchorage to the north-east (later the colours were reversed). Since 1854 a second white light has also been displayed, from a window lower down in the tower, indicating a channel between two hazards: the Draystone and the Knap; it used a small, sixth-order dioptric lens.\n\nBy 1867 a 7 cwt bell had been installed at the lighthouse to serve as a fog signal. In 1879 a larger (32 cwt) bell was installed, and the old bell was transferred to Gunfleet Lighthouse. (The new bell had previously been in use at Start Point lighthouse, where a fog siren had replaced it two years earlier). The bell sounded four strokes every minute in foggy weather. The following year, the light was made occulting (being eclipsed for three seconds every half minute).\n\nIn 1920 the lighthouse was converted to run automatically on acetylene gas. Following departure of the resident keepers, the light was monitored from the Trinity House fog signal station at nearby Penlee Point.\n\nOversight of the lighthouse was passed from Trinity House to the Ministry of Defence in 1993. The bell remained in use until 1994, when it was replaced by an electronic fog horn. The main light currently flashes once every ten seconds, white with a red sector to the north-east; the subsidiary white light has an isophase characteristic, two seconds on, two seconds off.\n\nIn 1860, a Royal Commission, established by Lord Palmerston, produced a plan for the defence of Plymouth and other Royal Dockyards. The Breakwater Fort was designed to defend the entrances to Plymouth Sound in conjunction with forts and batteries on either shore. Designed by Captain Siborne, work on the oval masonry sea fort started in 1861 and the main structure was completed in 1865. It has its foundations on Shovel Rock and is 35 yards inside the Breakwater. After several changes in plan, the fort was finally armed in 1879 with fourteen 12.5-inch and four 10-inch rifled muzzle-loading guns in armoured casemates. Although the fort had been disarmed before World War I, it served as a signal station, and from 1937, an anti-aircraft training school. It was finally released by the military in 1976.\n\n\n"}

A guard known for his three-point shooting, House played for nine NBA teams in 11 seasons in the league. He was a member of the Boston Celtics team that won the NBA championship in 2008.\n\nEddie was born in the city of Berkeley, California, and was raised primarily in Union City, California, where he attended James Logan High School. House transferred to Hayward High School because he was forbidden from playing on the Logan varsity team in his freshman year. At Hayward, House was named All-Hayward Area Athletic League and All-Eastbay in both his junior and senior years, and graduated in 1996. He wanted to play for University of California, Berkeley, but coaches of that school felt that House wasn't ready for a major college basketball program, and recommended that House begin at a junior college.\n\nHouse attended Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona, on a full-ride scholarship. He is the all-time scoring leader at ASU with 2,044 points in his career, and is the only player to score more than 2,000 points. He, Ike Diogu, and James Harden are the only three Sun Devils to be named Pac-10 Player of the Year, and he was the fifth Sun Devil to be voted onto the All-Conference team twice.\n\nHe also is the career record-holder at Arizona State for field goals and steals, and set the single-season scoring average record for the school with 23.0 points per game in 1999–2000. During that season he was named Pac-10 \"Player of the Week\" a record-tying four times (matched only by Ed O'Bannon, Chris Mills, Gary Payton, and Quincy Pondexter).\n\nHouse set a single-game Arizona State record with a 61-point effort in a 111–108 double-overtime victory against the California Golden Bears on the road in his senior season. It also was a memorable homecoming of sorts for him, as he had starred in high school for nearby Hayward High School. House also set a record in the game with 18 made free throws in 19 attempts. House is the first Pac-10 player to notch four 40-point games in one season as he had 61 vs. Cal, 46 vs. San Diego State, 42 vs. Penn State and 40 vs. UCLA. He also posted eight 30-point games that same season and set ASU records in points (736) and points per game (23.0). Also led the team in assists (111) and steals (74), as the 74 steals is tied for second on ASU single-season list. He is one of only three players to average in double figures in four consecutive seasons at Arizona State since it joined the Pac-10.\n\nDuring his career at Arizona State, House went 0-8 against the University of Arizona Men's Basketball team. During the 2014 Fiesta Bowl, House gave a motivational speech to the Boise State Football team on the importance of beating the Arizona Wildcats, Boise State's opponent. Incidentally, the Broncos won 38-30.\n\nIn the NBA, House was known for his three-point shooting.\n\nHe was selected by the Miami Heat in the second round (47th overall) of the 2000 NBA draft. He played in Miami for three seasons before leaving for the Los Angeles Clippers in free agency. After just one year in Los Angeles, House was traded to the Charlotte Bobcats. He then spent the 2004–05 NBA season playing for Charlotte, Milwaukee Bucks and Sacramento Kings. The following season House was signed by the Phoenix Suns; they reached the Western Conference Finals before losing to the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nOn August 17, 2006, he signed a one-year, $1.5 million deal with the New Jersey Nets.\nOn August 9, 2007, he signed a one-year, $1.5 million deal with the Boston Celtics. He joined a cast of all-stars dubbed as the Big Three – Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen. The team won the 2008 NBA Finals with House playing as a backup guard for either Ray Allen or Rajon Rondo. He played a pivotal role in the team's comeback victory in Game 4, knocking down two clutch three-pointers down the stretch. On July 23, 2008, he re-signed with the Celtics on a 2-year, $5.6 million deal, with the second year as player's option. During the 2008–09 regular season, he broke Danny Ainge's Celtics team record for best 3-point percentage in a season by shooting 44.4%.\n\nOn February 18, 2010, House, Bill Walker and J.R. Giddens were traded to the New York Knicks for Nate Robinson and Marcus Landry.\n\nIn July 2010 House's agent said that the guard agreed to terms on a $2.8 million, two-year contract with the Miami Heat.\n\nOn April 13, 2011, vs the Toronto Raptors, House scored a career high 35 points, beating his career NBA record by four points. The Heat made the 2011 NBA Finals and were defeated by the Dallas Mavericks in six games.\n\nOn June 30, 2011, House exercised an option clause in his contract, agreeing to a one-year, $1.4 million extension with the Heat. On Christmas Eve he was waived by the Heat.\n\nHe is the son of Edward House and Deborah Buck, and has two brothers, Diallo Buck and Mychal House. During his rookie season with Miami in 2000–01, he married the sister of professional basketball player Mike Bibby. The couple has three sons, Jaelen, who is currently playing basketball for Arizona State University, and twins Kaden and Kalek and are now divorced.

During that same period, he ran his own promotion in Winnipeg, the Olympia Wrestling Club. After he shut down the Olympia Club to pursue non-wrestling ventures, but he rejoined the larger Madison Club in the 1960s to become one of that promotion's top heels. He bought the Madison Club in 1967 and merged it with the American Wrestling Association in 1968.\n\nTomko acted as the AWA's Winnipeg promoter from 1966 through to the mid-1970s, and he was credited with launching the career of Roddy Piper. He also competed sometimes in Stampede Wrestling under a mask as Cosmo #1, and later wrestled without the mask in Stampede and in Vancouver's NWA All Star Wrestling as \"Crazy Legs\" Leroy Hirsch. In 1972, he started up another independent promotion called Central Canadian Championship Wrestling, which he ran in Manitoba cities and towns outside Winnipeg. He made use of mostly local talent, although he occasionally also brought in big-name stars for special appearances.\n\nTomko later left Winnipeg and headed to Vancouver, where he bought Sandor Kovacs' ownership stake in NWA All Star in 1977. While promoting the Vancouver territory, he began pushing himself as All Star's top star under the ring name Master Sergeant Tomko in the early-1980s (despite his age, being physically past his prime, and lacking wrestling skills) and gave himself almost all of All Star's championships (including the Vancouver version of the NWA Canadian Heavyweight title) at various points.

The ergastulum was usually built as a deep, roofed pit below ground level, large enough to allow the slaves to work within it, and containing narrow spaces in which they slept. Ergastula were common structures on all slave-using farms (latifundia). The etymology is disputed between two possible Greek roots: \"ergasterios\" \"workshop\" and \"ergastylos\" \"pillar to which slaves are tethered.\"\n\nThe ergastulum was made illegal during the reign of Hadrian, as part of a series of reforms to improve conditions for slaves.\n\nColumella in his \"Res Rustica\" states that an underground ergastulum should be as healthful as possible, and should be lit by windows with narrow bars which are far enough from the ground that it is not possible to reach them by hand.

The term \"runcible\", used for the phrase \"runcible spoon\", was invented for the poem.\n\n\"The Owl and the Pussy-cat\" features four anthropomorphic animals – an owl, a cat, a pig, and a turkey – and tells the story of the love between the title characters who marry in the land \"where the Bong-tree grows\".\n\nThe Owl and the Pussy-cat set out to sea in a pea green boat with honey and \"plenty of money\" wrapped in a five-pound note. The Owl serenades the Pussy-cat while gazing at the stars and strumming on a small guitar. The Owl describes the Pussy-cat as beautiful.

They sail away for a year and a day to a land where bong trees grow and discover a pig with a ring in his nose in a wood. They buy the ring for a shilling and are married the next day by a turkey. They dine on mince and quince using a \"runcible spoon\", then dance hand-in-hand on the sand in the moonlight.\n\nPortions of an unfinished sequel, \"The Children of the Owl and the Pussy-cat\" were published first posthumously, during 1938. The children are part fowl and part cat, and love to eat mice. \n\nThe family live by places with strange names. The Cat dies, falling from a tall tree, making the Owl become a single parent. The death causes the Owl great sadness. The money is all spent, but the Owl still sings to the original guitar.\n\n\n\n"}

It can penetrate as far inland as , reaching York in the early evening.\n\nIn Perth, the capital city of Western Australia, the wind is named the Fremantle Doctor because it appears to come from the nearby coastal city of Fremantle, and it brings welcome relief from the summertime high temperatures.\n\nThe Fremantle Doctor often cools the Perth suburbs by several degrees, whilst nearer the coast the wind can be quite strong, often blowing between 15 and 20 knots and making afternoon beach visits unpleasant.\n\nOn days when the wind fails, the afternoon temperatures of Perth suburbs are considerably higher, often exceeding , although this is also attributable to the influence of a strong easterly wind blowing in hot desert air from the arid interior of the state.\n\nThe Fremantle Doctor is strongest in December and January, when the temperature differential between the land and ocean is greatest. In February and March the breeze is not as strong, because the ocean is a bit warmer. Though October and November are not as warm, the ocean is cooler, resulting in the sea breeze in these months.\n\nOther months have a weak or non-existent Fremantle Doctor. In the winter months, the land is usually cooler than the ocean, and this sometimes results in the weaker land breeze in the early morning.\n\nWhen the Fremantle Doctor first arrives it is from the west-south-west direction.\nLater when it is at maximum strength, the direction is usually from the southwest or south-south-west. By the early evening, the direction is from the south. This change in wind direction is due to the Coriolis Effect. Other factors, like the prevailing wind of a particular day, can also have an effect on the direction.\n\nA wind rose showing the different wind directions for Perth can be found at the Bureau of Meteorology's website.\n\n\n\n"}

He served as Attorney-General under Chief Minister Clare Martin, and for some years was occasionally tipped as a potential successor to Martin. He resigned from the ministry and from parliament in August 2006, citing health reasons.\n\nToyne was born and raised in Victoria. He initially spent time as a professional athlete, twice coming third in the Stawell Gift, winning five Victorian championships over 400 and 800 metres, and breaking world records over 550 metres and 600 yards. However, he later studied science and education at the University of Melbourne with the intent of becoming a teacher. He graduated in 1972, and spent several years teaching at Flemington High School. In 1975, Toyne founded the Kensington Community School, and spent four years working on the project.\n\nToyne left the Melbourne school in 1980, and not long after, relocated across the country to the Northern Territory. He took a particular interest in community education projects aimed at the indigenous community of the Territory, developing several programs and serving stints as both a teacher and an administrator. Toyne also worked as a consultant to the Perron government from 1990 to 1994.\n\nToyne began to take an interest in a political career, and when Labor Party Opposition Leader Brian Ede resigned from parliament in mid-1996, Toyne nominated to replace him as the ALP candidate for Stuart at the subsequent by-election.

Two years later, Toyne was appointed as the party whip when Clare Martin's ascendancy to the leadership sparked a cabinet reshuffle. By this point, Toyne was becoming an increasingly prominent figure in Northern Territory politics, and at the 2001 election, was easily re-elected, winning more than 70% of the vote. When that same election saw the ALP win their first victory in the history of the Assembly, new Chief Minister Clare Martin appointed Toyne to the ministry, most notably as Attorney-General. Toyne received a further promotion when unpopular Health Minister Jane Aagaard was dumped in October 2003, and he was called upon as her replacement.

The spoon is normally decorated with symbols of love, and was intended to reflect the skill of the carver. Due to the intricate designs, lovespoons are no longer used as functioning spoons and are now decorative craft items.\n\nThe lovespoon is a traditional craft that dates back to the seventeenth century. Over generations, decorative carvings were added to the spoon and it lost its original practical use and became a treasured decorative item to be hung on a wall.\n\nThe earliest known dated lovespoon from Wales, displayed in the St Fagans National History Museum near Cardiff, is from 1667, although the tradition is believed to date back long before that. The earliest dated lovespoon worldwide originates from Germany, and is dated as 1664.\n\nThe lovespoon was given to a young woman by her suitor. It was important for the girl's father to see that the young man was capable of providing for the family and woodworking.\n\nSailors would often carve lovespoons during their long journeys, which is why anchors would often be incorporated into the carvings.\n\nCertain symbols came to have specific meanings: a horseshoe for luck, a cross for faith, bells for marriage, hearts for love, a wheel supporting a loved one and a lock for security, among others. Caged balls indicated the number of children hoped for. Other difficult carvings, such as chains, were as much a demonstration of the carver's skill as a symbolic meaning.\n\nAlthough the Welsh lovespoon is the most famous there are also traditions of lovespoons in Scandinavia and some parts of Eastern Europe, which have their own unique styles and techniques when it comes to the Lovespoon.\n\nToday lovespoons are given as wedding and anniversary gifts, as well as birthday, baby gifts, Christmas or Valentine's Day gifts. They are now mostly seen as a folk craft.\n\nIn old times, newly married couples in Norway ate with linked spoons to symbolize the linkage of their marriage. Often the spoons and chain were made from a single piece of wood, emphasizing wood-carving craftsmanship.\n\nSimilar linked spoons can be found in some ethnographic museums.\n\nA design for making linked spoons was published in \"Popular Science\" in 1967.

He studied at Rush Medical College where he graduated in 1913. Fishbein served for 18 months as a resident physician at the Durand Hospital for Infectious Diseases.\n\nHe joined George H. Simmons, editor of The \"Journal of the American Medical Association\" (\"JAMA\"), as an assistant and advanced to the editorship in 1924, a position he maintained until 1950. He was on the cover of \"Time\" on June 21, 1937. In 1938, along with the AMA, he was indicted for violating the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. The AMA was convicted and fined $2,500 but Fishbein was acquitted.\n\nIn 1961 he became the founding Editor of \"Medical World News\", a magazine for doctors. In 1970 he endowed the Morris Fishbein Center for the study of the history of science and medicine at the University of Chicago. Its first activity was a lecture series taking place in May of that year. Allen G. Debus served as director of the Center from 1971 to 1977. Fishbein also endowed a chair at the university for the same subject, a chair taken up by Debus in 1978. The 7th floor in Shoreland Hall at the University of Chicago was known as Fishbein House, using the Fishbein name as its namesake. \n\nHe died on September 27, 1976 in Chicago, Illinois. He was survived by two daughters, Barbara Fishbein Friedell and Marjorie Clavey, and his son, Justin M. Fishbein.\n\nHe was also notable due to his affinity for exposing quacks, notably the goat-gland surgeon John R. Brinkley, and campaigning for regulation of medical devices. His book \"Fads and Quackery in Healing\", debunks homeopathy, osteopathy, chiropractic, Christian Science, radionics and other dubious medical practices.\n\nIn 1938, Fishbein authored a two-part article \"Modern Medical Charlatans\" in the journal \"Hygeia\" which criticized the quackery of Brinkley. Brinkley sued Fishbein for libel but lost the case.

Traditionally, these objectives have been accomplished either by a party convention, a vote of members of parliament, or some form of electoral college. OMOV backers claim that OMOV enhances the practice of democracy, because ordinary citizens will be able to participate. Detractors counter that allowing those unversed in the issues to help make decisions makes for bad governance.\n\nThe first OMOV leadership selection process in Canada was held by the Parti Québécois, ending on 29 September 1985.\n\nIn English-speaking Canada, the principle of OMOV has for years been a major commitment of Vaughan L. Baird. Long a proponent of the election process that empowers all members of a party to choose their leaders, Baird was instrumental in having the provincial constituency of Morris, Manitoba successfully put forward the principle of OMOV to the provincial Progressive Conservative Party on 5 November 1985. Immediately after the Morris victory, Baird wrote to every national and provincial party in Canada and urged them to do the same. Soon after, the Manitoba Liberal Party adopted the principle. Alberta PCs used the method in electing Ralph Klein as their new leader in December 1992.\n\nThe Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba adopted the process in early 1987, but the party hierarchy later had it revoked. Though again adopted by the party in 1994, OMOV was revoked a second time in November 1995. Finally, on November 17, 2001, with only three votes in opposition, OMOV was passed by the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba.\n\nAlso in 1995, the New Democratic Party moved some way towards OMOV when they developed a series of regional primary elections prior to their convention. In the subsequent contest, his party went further adopted a modified OMOV process for the 2003 NDP leadership election in which the vote was calculated so that ballots cast by labour delegates had 25% weight in the total result, while votes cast by all party members on an OMOV had a weight of 75%. When the federal Liberal government changed the election finances law, soon after Jack Layton won the NDP's leadership in the modified OMOV election on January 23, 2003, the party implemented full OMOV for its next leadership convention.\n\nThe Bloc Québécois first used OMOV in its 1997 leadership election.\n\nIn 1991, the Alberta Progressive Conservatives changed its rules for selecting a party leader, moving from a traditional delegate-based leadership convention to an OMOV system. Four party leaders were chosen using this system: Ralph Klein (1992); Ed Stelmach (2006); Alison Redford (2011); and Jim Prentice (2014). However, the Alberta PC party ended this system in 2016 after OMOV came under criticism.\n\nThe Conservative Party of Canada uses a weighted OMOV system in which all ridings are accorded an equal number of points and those points are distributed to candidates proportionately to how party members in that riding vote. The Canadian Alliance used a pure OMOV system but in merger negotiations with the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada it was agreed to adopt the weighted system used in the 1998 Progressive Conservative leadership election in order to encourage leadership candidates to seek support across the country.\n\nIn 2009, the Liberal Party of Canada adopted a weighted membership vote in which each riding counts equally in the final tally. This is not a one-member, one vote system because, by definition, members have a variable number of votes depending on the riding they live in. However, it is similar to one member, one vote in that every party member is entitled to cast a ballot. The 2009 convention was conducted according to the old rules. However, as this convention did not feature a contested race but was a ratification of Michael Ignatieff's leadership, the last example of a full-blown delegated federal leadership convention being the 2006 convention that elected Stéphane Dion.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the methods of selecting party leaders gradually developed as parliamentary parties took shape and grew more rigid over time, in some cases many decades after their counterparts elsewhere in the Commonwealth – for example, the Conservative Party did not adopt a formal method for choosing its leaders until 1965. Traditionally, members of Parliament have usually played a major role in selecting a party leaders, based largely on the belief that since a leader had to work closely with his or her parliamentary party, their views on who the leader should be had to be paramount. In recent years, all major parties have implemented reforms to allow ordinary party members a say in the choosing of a new leader, while still allowing MPs a central role in the leadership selection process.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats are the most longstanding example of a national UK party using the one-member, one-vote voting system. It has been used since the party's foundation in 1988. Rather than having a 'runoff', the Liberal Democrats use the Alternative Vote system of preference voting. Liberal Democrat MPs have no special voting rights when choosing the leader – however, a prospective candidate must be a sitting Liberal Democrat MP with the support of at least ten percent of the parliamentary party in order to stand in a leadership election.\n\nUntil 1981, the Labour Party leader was chosen by a secret ballot of Labour MPs. One-member, one-vote for the election of the party's leader was first proposed at Labour's Wembley Special Conference in 1981, but was opposed by Tony Benn, who instead initiated an electoral college comprising different interest groups in the party: a trade union section comprising 40% of the total vote, consisting of block votes cast by union General Secretaries, another section of 30% comprising the Parliamentary Labour Party (Labour MPs) and a further 30% for active party members in Constituency Labour Parties (CLPs). \n\nParty leader Neil Kinnock attempted, but failed, to introduce one-member, one-vote in 1984. His successor, John Smith partially introduced a new one-member, one-vote system by abolishing the trade union block vote in the selection of Labour parliamentary candidates, and by giving union members paying the political levy (in the trade union section of Labour's electoral college) a direct vote in the party's leadership elections. He introduced the change at the Labour Party Conference in 1993, and was verbally supported in winning votes for it at the Conference by then-Shadow Cabinet member John Prescott. \n\nA complete one-member, one-vote voting system (as originally proposed by both Neil Kinnock and John Smith) was introduced in 2014 by Labour leader Ed Miliband. All Labour Party members are now entitled to vote for the Leader and Deputy Leader of the party as part of an electoral college which includes MPs, members of the European Parliament and trade unions.\n\nIn January 1998, the one member, one vote principle was adopted as part of the series of reforms of the Conservative Party. MPs choose two candidates to go to a vote by all Conservative members.\n\nThe system was first used by the Conservatives in the 2001 leadership election to replace William Hague. A run off by various candidates led to Iain Duncan Smith and Kenneth Clarke being put forward to a vote of all Conservative members, where 79% of the 328,000 eligible members voted. Duncan Smith became the new Leader of the Conservative Party with 61% of the votes (155,933 votes). Kenneth Clarke obtained 39% of the votes (100,544 votes).\n\nIn the 2003 leadership election no ballot took place, since Michael Howard was unopposed in standing to replace Duncan Smith. The two candidate run off was employed again two years later, when David Cameron was chosen by the Conservative members as their new leader over David Davis. Cameron had 134,446 votes compared to Davis’ 64,398 votes, making a total number of 198,844 votes.\n\n"}

During the 20th-century period of decolonisation and the struggles for national sovereignty, from the late 1940s onwards this phrase became widely used in developing countries where majority populations sought to gain political power in proportion to their numbers. The slogan was notably used by the anti-apartheid movement during the 1980s, which sought to end white minority rule in South Africa.\n\nIn the United States, the \"one person, one vote\" principle was invoked in a series of cases by Warren Court in the 1960s. Applying the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution, the Supreme Court majority opinion (8-1) led by Chief Justice Earl Warren in \"Reynolds v. Sims\" (1964) ruled that state legislatures needed to redistrict in order to have congressional districts with roughly equal represented populations. In addition, the court ruled that, unlike the United States Congress, both houses of state legislatures needed to have representation based on districts containing roughly equal populations, with redistricting as needed after censuses.\n\nThis phrase was traditionally used in the context of demands for suffrage reform. Historically the emphasis within the House of Commons was on representing \"areas\": counties, boroughs and, later on, universities. The entitlement to vote for the Members of Parliament representing the constituencies varied widely, with different qualifications over time, such as owning property of a certain value, holding an apprenticeship, qualifying for paying the local-government rates, or holding a degree from the university in question. Those who qualified for the vote in more than one constituency were entitled to vote in each constituency, while many adults did not qualify for the vote at all. Plural voting was also present in local government, whereby the owners of business property qualified for votes in the relevant wards.\n\nReformers argued that Members of Parliament and other elected officials should represent citizens equally, and that each voter should be entitled to exercise the vote once in an election. Successive Reform Acts by 1950 had both extended the franchise eventually to almost all adult citizens (barring convicts, lunatics and members of the House of Lords), and also reduced and finally eliminated plural voting for Westminster elections. Plural voting for local-government elections outside the City of London was not abolished until the Representation of the People Act 1969.\n\nBut, there were two significant exceptions:\n\nThe City of London had never expanded its boundaries and, with many residential dwellings being replaced by businesses, and the destruction of The Blitz, after the Second World War the financial district had barely five thousand residents altogether. The system of plural voting was retained for electing the City of London Corporation, with some modifications.\n\nWhen Northern Ireland was established in 1921, it adopted the same political system then in place for the Westminster Parliament and British local government. But the Parliament of Northern Ireland did not follow Westminster in changes to the franchise from 1945. As a result, into the 1960s, plural voting was still allowed not only for local government (as it was for local government in Great Britain) but also for the Parliament of Northern Ireland. This meant that in local council elections (as in Great Britain) ratepayers and their spouses, whether renting or owning the property, could vote while company directors had an extra vote by virtue of their company's status. However, unlike the situation in Great Britain, non-ratepayers did not have a vote in local government elections. The franchise for elections to the Parliament of Northern Ireland had been extended in 1928 to all adult citizens who were not disqualified, at the same time as the franchise for elections to Westminster. However, University representation and the business vote continued at Stormont to 1969, while they were abolished for Westminster (including Westminster seats in Northern Ireland) in 1948. University representation still exists in Seanad Éireann, the upper house of the Oireachtas (parliament) of the Republic of Ireland. Historians and political scholars have debated the extent to which the franchise for local government contributed to unionist electoral success in controlling councils in nationalist-majority areas.\n\nBased on a number of inequities, the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association was founded in 1967. It had five primary demands, and added the demand that each citizen in Northern Ireland be afforded the same number of votes for local government elections (as stated above, this was not yet the case anywhere in the United Kingdom). The slogan \"one man, one vote\" became a rallying cry for this campaign. The Parliament of Northern Ireland voted to update the voting rules for Stormont elections, which were implemented for the 1969 Northern Ireland general election, and for local government elections, which was done by the Electoral Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1969, passed on 25 November 1969.\n\nThe United States Constitution requires a decennial census for the purpose of assuring fair apportionment. Reapportionment has generally been conducted without incident with the exception of the reapportionment that should have followed the 1920 Census, which was effectively skipped pending resolution by the Reapportionment Act of 1929. Congressional seats have been reapportioned based on population changes between states. State legislatures initially established election of congressional representatives from districts, often based on traditional counties or parishes which preceded founding of the new government. The question arose as to whether the state legislatures were required to ensure that congressional districts were roughly equal in population and to draw new districts to accommodate demographic changes.\n\nSome states redrew their U.S. House districts every ten years to reflect changes in population patterns; many did not. Some never redrew them, except when it was mandated by a change in the number of seats to which that state was entitled in the House of Representatives. In many states, this led to a skewing of influence for voters in some districts over those in others. For example, if the 2nd congressional district eventually had a population of 1.5 million, but the 3rd had only 500,000, then, in effect – since each district elected the same number of representatives – a voter in the 3rd district had three times the voting \"power\" of a 2nd-district voter. Alabama's state legislature resisted redistricting from 1910 to 1972 (when forced by federal court order). As a result, rural residents retained a wildly disproportionate amount of power in a time when other areas of the state became urbanized and industrialized, attracting greater populations. Such urban areas were under-represented in the state legislature and underserved; their residents had difficulty getting needed funding for infrastructure and services. They paid far more in taxes to the state than they received in benefits in relation to the population.\n\nThe Constitution includes the result of the Great Compromise resulting in representation for the US Senate. Each state was equally represented in the Senate with two representatives, without regard to population. The Founding Fathers considered this principle of such importance that they included a clause in the Constitution to prohibit any state from being deprived of equal representation in the Senate without its permission; see Article V of the United States Constitution. For this reason, \"one person, one vote\" has never been implemented in the U.S. Senate, in terms of representation by states.\n\nWhen states established their legislatures, they often adopted a bicameral model based on colonial governments. Many copied the Senate principle, establishing an upper house based on geography - for instance a state senate with one representative drawn from each county. By the 20th century, this often led to state senators having widely varying amounts of power, with ones from rural areas having votes equal to senators representing much greater urban populations.\n\nActivism in the Civil Rights Movement to regain the ability of African Americans in the South to register and vote highlighted other voting inequities across the country. In 1964-1965, Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 were established, restoring the voting rights of African Americans. Numerous court challenges were raised, including in Alabama due to the lack of reapportionment, for decades.\n\nIn the United States Supreme Court held in a 4-3 plurality decision that left to the legislature of each state the authority to establish the time, place, and manner of holding elections for representatives.\n\nHowever, in the United States Supreme Court under Chief Justice Earl Warren overturned the previous decision in Colegrove holding that malapportionment claims under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment were not exempt from judicial review under , as the equal protection issue in this case was separate from any political questions. The \"one person, one vote\" doctrine, which requires electoral districts to be apportioned according to population, thus making each district roughly equal in population, was further cemented by Warren Court in the landmark cases that followed \"Baker\", including which concerned the County Unit System in Georgia, which concerned state legislature districts, which concerned U.S. Congressional districts and which concerned local government districts.\n\nThe Warren Court's decision which was upheld in . said states may use total population in drawing districts.\n\nUnder the 'M.P.V. System', however, no one person or voter has more than one effective vote for one office. No voter's vote can be counted more than once for the same candidate. In the final analysis, no voter is given greater weight in his or her vote over the vote of another voter, although to understand this does require a conceptual understanding of how the effect of a 'M.P.V. System' is like that of a run-off election.

It was founded in 1847 and conducted under the tradition of the Franciscan Friars of the Third Order Regular. The university is situated on in the forests and farmland of Loretto.\n\nSaint Francis College was established in 1847 by six Franciscan teaching Brothers from Mountbellew, Ireland, who had been given land in Loretto by Michael O'Connor, the first Bishop of Pittsburgh, to establish a school. The university was one of the first Catholic universities in the United States and the first Franciscan college in the nation. Although it originally only admitted males, it became one of the first Catholic Universities to become co-educational. Loretto is the site of the first English-language Roman Catholic settlement established west of the Allegheny Front, in what is now the United States, by Demetrius Augustine Gallitzin in 1799.\n\nIn 2001 Saint Francis College was approved to change to become a university by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and renamed to Saint Francis University.\n\nSaint Francis University enrolls approximately 1,658 undergraduate students (of whom 1,392 are traditional students and 266 are continuing education students) and 527 graduate students. The university offers 25 undergraduate majors and 7 graduate fields of study (including Physical Therapy, in which the university awards a doctorate) to its students. The university maintains an average graduation rate of 70.3%.\n\nThe main building for the Southern Alleghenies Museum of Art, which also has a number of smaller facilities across the local region, is located on campus. Also on the campus are The DiSepio Institute for Rural Health and Wellness, the Center for the Study of Occupational Regulation (CSOR), Center for Watershed Research & Service, and The Institute for Contemporary Franciscan Life.\n\nImmergrün Golf Course is a semi-private, nine-hole, regulation-length 3,234-yard, par-36 course on rye grass located on the campus of Saint Francis University at 105 Saint Elizabeth Street. Immergrün has not been altered since Donald Ross built it for the steel magnate Charles M. Schwab in 1917.\n\nSaint Francis University also runs a campus at Ambialet France in the Midi-Pyrénées. All classes are in English.\n\nAthletically, Saint Francis competes in the NCAA's Northeast Conference. Their nickname is the Red Flash. The University has a total of 22 varsity sports teams, with nine men's teams and 13 women's programs all competing in NCAA Division I. Men's sports include basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, tennis, and track & field competing in the Northeast Conference and volleyball, which competes in the Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association (EIVA); while women's sports include basketball, bowling, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track & field and volleyball which compete in the Northeast Conference and field hockey which competes in the Atlantic 10 Conference (A-10). Saint Francis University will be adding Women's Water Polo in 2016-2017 school year as its 23 varsity sport at the Division 1 level. \nIn addition to this, there are also two club sport teams, ice hockey and baseball.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1895037", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1895037", "title": "Vauxhall Cresta", "text": "Vauxhall Cresta\n\nThe Vauxhall Cresta is a British car which was produced by Vauxhall from 1954 to 1972. The Cresta was introduced in 1954 as an upmarket version of the Vauxhall Velox, itself a six-cylinder version of the Vauxhall Wyvern. The Cresta models were the E (1954–1957), PA (1957–1962), PB (1962–1965) and PC (1965–1972). The Viscount (1966–1972) was an upmarket Cresta PC.\n\nThe Vauxhall Velox had been introduced in 1948, with a new version in 1951. The Cresta E version, launched in 1954, had the same 2262 cc six cylinder engine in the same state of tune but scored over the Velox in having a choice of leather or fabric upholstery, optional two tone paintwork, a heater as standard, a small electric fascia mounted clock, a cigar lighter, a lamp automatically illuminating the boot when opened and a vanity mirror on the inside of the front passenger's sun visor along with a special ornamental badge above the V (for Vauxhall) badge on the nose of the car. A radio was optional.\n\nIn October 1955 a facelift model with deeper front and rear screens was introduced. The balanced drop windows were replaced by ones with proper winding mechanisms, there were interior trim improvements, separate amber rear flasher lights and windscreen washers became standard. A new chrome plated grille with fewer vertical slats replaced the earlier diecast version. This model was assembled in New Zealand, alongside the Wyvern and Velox, with 840 being built in 1956, according to a local owners' group with access to copies of the GM Petone plant ledgers. More changes were made in October 1956, with a new grille with horizontal bars, higher compression ratio engine, electrically operated windscreen wipers (replacing the camshaft driven system) and changes to the body trim and two tone colour scheme. In June 1957 the Cresta received a redesigned engine of the same capacity based on the deeper block design introduced in four-cylinder form in the Victor F series in March of that year.\n\nA Cresta tested by the British magazine The Motor in 1956 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 20.2 seconds. A petrol consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £931 including taxes.\n\nThe PA Cresta, announced 2 October 1957, is probably the best-known version. It mimicked the American fashion for tail-fins, wrap-around windows and white-wall tyres, taking its cues from the 1957 model Buick Special announced twelve months before the Cresta, though understated compared to the Cadillacs and Buicks of the time. All factory-built PAs were four-door saloons: the estate cars were converted by Friary of Basingstoke, Hampshire and are rare today.\n\nThe PA Cresta had independent front suspension using coil springs and an anti-roll bar with a rigid axle and semi-elliptic leaf springs at the rear. The Lockheed brakes used drums all round. Carried over from the last of the E series cars, the 2,262 cc six-cylinder engine had pushrod-operated overhead valves and a compression ratio of 7.8:1 (a low compression 6.8:1 version was available); it produced at 4,400 rpm. A single Zenith carburettor was used. The transmission had three forward speeds.\n\nIt was well equipped with leather and nylon upholstery for its bench front and rear seats and woven pile carpet. A heater was fitted as standard. The radio remained an option on the home market. Other options included fog lamps, reversing light, locking filler cap and external mirrors. In order to keep the front floor clear to seat six people the handbrake lever was mounted under the dashboard and the gearchange lever was column mounted. The car could be ordered painted in either single or two tone colours.\n\nA PA tested by the British magazine \"The Motor\" in 1958 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 16.8 seconds. A petrol consumption of was recorded. The test car cost £1073 including taxes of £358. They tested the 2.6 Litre version with overdrive in 1960 and found the top speed had increased to , acceleration from 0- to 15.2 seconds and fuel consumption improved to . The test car cost £1077 including taxes of £317. The car without overdrive cost £1014.\nAustralian assembly of the PA Cresta began in May 1958 by General Motors Holden. Subsequent models were assembled up until 1965.\n\nIn August 1959 the Cresta was given a facelift, with a new, larger, grille and the replacement of the three piece rear window with a single wrap around screen. The previous ribbed roof panel was replaced with a smoothly contoured version (with structural revisions to the C pillars and rear parcel shelf area to retain structural strength). The Vauxhall flutes on the front wings finally disappeared, replaced by a straight chrome side moulding which was also the division point for the two tone colour scheme. Further changes came in August 1960 with the introduction of a new engine of square dimensions (bore and stroke were both 82.55mm) with a redesigned, longer, cylinder block and a capacity of 2651cc. A further increase in compression ratio to 8.0:1 and larger valves in wedge shaped combustion chambers contributed to a power output of 95bhp at 4,600rpm. Increased diameter wheels allowed larger brakes to be fitted, but these were still of the drum type (Ford had introduced front disc brakes as an option on the rival Zephyr/Zodiac models in September 1960 and would make them standard in June 1961). \n\nExternally, there was a redesign of the rear lights, with shallower units replacing the elongated oval ones of the previous versions. The direction indicators, previously in the rear tail fins were now incorporated in the main lamp unit and the fins were now solid with a V for Vauxhall badge. The rear bumper was now a higher mounted straight topped design. The front sidelights and direction indicators, previously separate were now in a combined housing and there were redesigned wheel trims and hub caps. Inside, a redesigned fascia with a padded top and a horizontal speedometer was featured. In October 1961 the final updates to the PA series were made. Front disc brakes became an optional extra (four months after Ford had made them standard on the Zephyr/Zodiac). Separate front seats became an option to the standard bench and there was now wood trim to the fascia and door cappings. The PA Cresta continued in production in this form until replaced by the PB series in October 1962.\nDuring the 1970s many PA Crestas were modified and customised. The model was very popular with fifties revivalists; many were driven by teddy boys and were very much seen as part of the rock 'n' roll image. A 1960 PA Cresta features in the 1981 video for \"Ghost Town\" by The Specials, in which the band are wearing '50s-style clothing.The Specials Ghost Town Car can now be seen in The Coventry Music Museum.\n\nToday the PA Cresta is a recognised classic, with the other variants perhaps less appreciated but gaining recognition. One famous PA owner in the late 1950s was Don Lang.\n\nThe PB was a major styling revision, completely eliminating the tailfins, with a flat bonnet and generally more conservative styling taking its cues from the Victor FB introduced the previous year and with which it shared its doors. The engine was the same straight six as the last of the PA series and although the compression ratio was increased to 8.5:1, power output remained at 95 bhp. Front disc brakes were now fitted as standard. In October 1963 an estate conversion was made available, the work carried out by Martin Walter Ltd. of Bedford Dormobile fame and fully approved by Vauxhall. The conversion featured a steel-framed glass fibre roof extension and tailgate. The rear doors with squared-off window frames were straight from the factory-built Victor estate. In October 1964 the engine was increased in capacity to 3293 cc by virtue of a larger, 92 mm, bore in combination with the original 82.55 mm stroke. Power increased to 115 bhp at 4,200 rpm. The model received a new full-width chrome grille incorporating the headlights and there was a full-length chrome strip along the body sides.\n\nThe gearbox was still three-speed with column change but an overdrive was available. As standard, the 3.3-litre cars had a three-speed column-change gearbox, with a four-speed floor-change unit as an option. Three-speed hydramatic automatic transmission was available with both engines but this was changed to the two-speed Powerglide unit towards the end of the 3.3-litre PB run. Servo-assisted brakes, with discs at the front, were fitted. Minor changes to gearing and the option of power steering were introduced early in 1965 and the PB series continued until replaced by the PC models in October of that year.\n\nAustralia continued to locally assemble the PB Cresta. New Zealand fully imported the PB Cresta from Britain. \n\nThe last of the series, the PC, was introduced for the London Motor Show in October 1965. No longer offered as a lower specification Velox version, it was designated PCS (standard), PCD (Deluxe) and PCE (Executive), this last having its own name, 'Viscount'. It was a different car, larger and styled with the coke-bottle look that would also be seen in the FD Victor series: it now resembled a slightly smaller Chevrolet Impala. It was similar to the Australian Holden HR, but larger and better trimmed, and featured the 123 DIN/142 SAE hp 3.3-litre straight-six engine for its entire seven-year production run. Though a small-block V8 would have dropped straight in, this option was never offered in Europe. Initially, the three-speed column-shift manual transmission was standard with optional overdrive; four-speed manual and two-speed Powerglide were also optional. Later cars, from about 1971, came with four-speed manual or three-speed automatic, both having floor shift and bucket seats. The De-Luxe version had four headlamps instead of the two fitted on the (much rarer) base models.\n\nGeneral Motors Holden assembly of the Cresta ended in 1965, therefore the PC Cresta was not sold in Australia. \n\nGeneral Motors New Zealand ran its own assembly line in Petone (1966-67) and Trentham, near Wellington, to 1971. Up until 1966 the Cresta was fully imported from Britain. From 1966 the Petone plant began locally assembly of the Cresta. The one 'base' Cresta model built changed very little during that time and did not receive the facelift that appeared on the UK market late in 1970 as the 1971 model. The only option was the 2 speed Powerglide. However, at some point in production (1970) the brake system was upgraded to a tandem master cylinder to improve the braking, and this upgrade became a standard fitment on the New Zealand models. A few twin-headlamp Cresta Deluxe, Viscount and estate car versions were also imported, built-up, from the UK.\n\nThe facelifted model, never offered in New Zealand, had twin headlamps as standard and a more integrated dash panel. Floor shift, rather than column change, was also standard.\n\nIn January 1967 domestic market deliveries began of the Vauxhall Cresta estate car. This vehicle resulted from a conversion by Martin Walter of Folkestone, a firm better known for their (primarily Bedford based) Dormobile motorhome conversions. The estate version was higher than the saloon due to a combination of heavy-duty rear suspension, an increase in the outer diameter of the tyres (to 7.00-14 in from 5.90-14in) and the modified roof line. The Cresta estate was initially offered in the UK at £1,507, which represented a price premium of around 40% over the equivalent saloon. The long established Humber Hawk estate and recently introduced Ford Zephyr estate carried UK sales prices of £1,342 and £1,379 respectively. The Cresta estate offered a load platform length of which increased to an impressive when the back seat was folded down, but Vauxhall's contender was never priced to be a big seller and the last estate cars were made in 1968.\n\nIntroduced early in June 1966, with the same engine and mechanical components as the Cresta PC, the Viscount was the super de-luxe version of it. It was supplied as standard with power steering, electric windows, reclining seats, a vinyl roof, walnut dashboard, inertia reel seat belts front, and even a heated rear window. Areas of the grille and headlamp surrounds were blacked out to give a classier look and the tail-lights had a chrome overlay. The dark green, blue or maroon paintwork featured simulated, hand painted coachlines, along each flank, to give the car a coachpainted appearance. The outer pair of the quad, five inch, sealed beam headlamps were twin filament, giving the car four main beams. The Viscount also came with wider tyres and rims than the Cresta (7.00-14in on 5\" rims rather than 5.90-14in on 4.5\" rims). All PC 3.3 had twin tail-pipes. The standard transmission option was GM's Powerglide 2-speed automatic system, but a four speed manual gearbox was available, initially on the UK market at a saving of £85: elsewhere the manual gear box was a no-cost option. In the third quarter of 1970 the two-speed Powerglide automatic was replaced with a GM 3-speed automatic transmission.\n\nSome South African versions were fitted with a Chrysler V8 as an option - one of the rare times a General Motors product used a direct rival's engine.\nThe British version of the Vauxhall Viscount automatic with the 2-speed Powerglide transmission was road tested by Motor ref.33/66 on 3 September 1966. A maximum (best) top speed of 100mph was recorded with 0-60 mph in 14.5secs, Standing quarter mile in 20.3secs. Overall mpg was 15.6. The later automatic Viscount model, with the 3 speed Strasbourg GM transmission, ought to have improved on these acceleration figures, especially at the lower speeds. \n\nIn the 1950s and 60s Queen Elizabeth II used a bespoke PA \nFriary Estate, and later a PC version of the Cresta as personal transport. The Queen's PA Friary estate forms part of The Royal Car Collection at the Sandringham Exhibition & Transport Museum.\n"}
{"id": "1895040", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1895040", "title": "Unaccusative verb", "text": "Unaccusative verb\n\nIn modern linguistics, an unaccusative verb is an intransitive verb whose grammatical subject is not a semantic agent. In other words, it does not actively initiate, or is not actively responsible for, the action of the verb.\n\nAn unaccusative verb's subject is semantically similar to the direct object of a transitive verb or to the subject of a verb in the passive voice.\n\nExamples in English are \"the tree fell\"; \"the window broke\". In those sentences, the action (falling, breaking) can be considered as something that happened to the subject, rather than being initiated by it. Semantically, the word \"tree\" in the sentence \"the tree fell\" plays a similar role as it does in a transitive sentence, such as \"they cut down the tree\", or its passive transformation \"the tree was cut down\".\n\nUnaccusative verbs thus contrast with unergative verbs, such as \"run\" or \"resign\", which describe actions voluntarily initiated by the subject. They are called \"unaccusative\" because although the subject has the semantic role of a patient, it is not assigned accusative case.\n\nIn nominative–accusative languages, the accusative case, which marks the direct object of transitive verbs, usually represents the non-volitional argument (often the patient). However, for unaccusative verbs, although the subject is non-volitional, it is not marked by the accusative.\n\nAs Perlmutter points out, the same verb such as \"slide\" can be either unaccusative or unergative, depending on whether the action was involuntary or voluntary.\n\nThe term \"unaccusative verb\" was first used in a 1978 paper by David M. Perlmutter of the University of California, San Diego. According to Perlmutter himself, the terms \"unaccusative\" and \"unergative\" were both invented by the linguist Geoffrey K. Pullum.\n\nAs mentioned above, the unaccusative/unergative split in intransitive verbs can be characterized semantically. Unaccusative verbs tend to express a telic and dynamic change of state or location, while unergative verbs tend to express an agentive activity (not involving directed movement). While these properties define the \"core\" classes of unaccusatives and unergatives, there are intermediate classes of verbs whose status is less clear (for example, verbs of existence, appearance, or continuation, verbs denoting uncontrolled processes, or motion verbs).\n\nA number of syntactic criteria for unaccusativity have also been identified. The most well-known test is auxiliary selection in languages that use two different temporal auxiliaries (\"have\" and \"be\") for analytic past/perfect verb forms (e.g. German, Dutch, French, Italian; even Early Modern English). In these languages, unaccusative verbs combine with \"be\", while unergative verbs combine with \"have\".\n\nFrom one language to another, however, synonymous verbs do not always select the same auxiliary, and even within one language, a single verb may combine with either auxiliary (either depending on the meaning/context, or with no observable semantic motivation, sometimes depending on regional variation of the language). The auxiliary selection criterion therefore also identifies core classes of unaccusative and unergatives (which show the least variation within and across languages) and more peripheral classes (where variation and context effects are observed).\n\nOther tests that have been studied involve passivization (see Impersonal passive voice), \"ne\"/\"en\" cliticization in Italian and French, and impersonal, participial, and resultative constructions in a wide range of languages.\n\nFor example, in Dutch and Turkish, unergative verbs can be used in impersonal passive constructions, but unaccusative verbs cannot. In the following example from Dutch, the verb is unergative, describing a voluntary action, and can be made passive:\n\nBut a sentence with an unaccusative verb, such as \"The concert lasted a long time\", cannot be made passive.\n\nIn Japanese, the grammaticality of sentences that appear to violate syntactic rules may signal the presence of an unaccusative verb. According to transformational models of grammar, such sentences contain a trace located in the direct object position that helps to satisfy the mutual c-command condition between numeral quantifiers and the noun phrases they modify (Tsujimura, 2007).\n\nModern English only uses one perfect auxiliary (\"have\"), although archaic examples like \"He is fallen/come\" reflect the use of \"be\" with unaccusative verbs in earlier stages of the language.\n\nThe identification of unaccusative verbs in English is therefore based on other criteria. For example, many unaccusatives alternate with a corresponding transitive construction where the unaccusative subject appears in direct object position:\n\nUnaccusative past participles can be used as nominal modifiers with active meaning, while unergative past participles cannot:\n\nFinally, unaccusative subjects can generally be modified by a resultative adjunct. This is a property shared by direct objects and passive subjects, but not shared by the subjects of unergative and transitive verbs.\n\nWhile \"\"to die\"\" has been classiffied as an unaccusative verb, like \"\"to fall\"\" and \"\"to arrive\"\". Dąbrowska (2016) noted that \"\"to die\"\" is an example of \"Unaccusative Mismatch\", because \"\"to die\"\" behaves:\n\nPerlmutter (1978) gives examples of various types of unaccusative verbs. He emphasises that the following categories are not definitive, but that alternative classifications are possible.\n\n(a) The verb \"be\" with adjectives:\n\n(b) Those where the grammatical subject is semantically a Patient: \n\n(c) Predicates of existing and happening:\n\n(d) Non-voluntary verbs of appearance, sound, smell, etc.:\n\n(e) Aspectual predicates:\n\n(f) Duratives: \n\nHe points out that some verbs can be used in either unaccusative or unergative clauses. If the action is deliberate or willed, the clause is unergative:\n\nThe derivation of the core properties of unaccusative constructions from a set of principles is one of the topmost issues of the agenda of modern syntax since the seminal work by Perlmutter 1978 (cf. Burzio 1986 and Hale-Keyser 2003 for landmark proposals). More specifically, the first approach arrived at an important consequence constituting an analogy between English passive voice constructions and unaccusative constructions whereas in the second approach a more radical theory was proposed based on the analysis of expletive \"there\" stemming from the sentences with the copula suggested in Moro 1997.\n\n\n"}

For example, in some Romance languages, such verbs use different auxiliaries when in compound tenses.\n\nBesides the above, unergative verbs differ from unaccusative verbs in that in some languages, they can occasionally use the passive voice.\n\nIn Dutch, for example, unergatives take (to have) in the perfect tenses:\n\nIn such cases, a transition to an impersonal passive construction is possible by using the adverb \"er\", which functions as a dummy subject and the passive auxiliary :\n\nBy contrast, Dutch ergative verbs take (\"to be\") in the perfect tenses:\n\nIn that case, no passive construction with is possible.

The game features a new graphics engine, a much expanded Universe and 60 different flyable ships, along with a number of new missions available to the player. Unlike the expansion pack, \"\", which was almost entirely open-ended, \"X2: The Threat\" has a clear background story involving an aggressive alien race known as the Khaak. However, the game remains open-ended and the players are free to pursue the plot at their own pace, if at all.\n\nThe player takes the role of Julian Gardna, a Pirate and thief. Early on, the Khaak, a hostile alien race, emerge to threaten the X-Universe. The player is asked to undertake a series of missions to uncover their origins, their intentions, and to determine their connection to his missing father. Ultimately, Julian must fight off a massive attack by Khaak, rescuing numerous other characters in the process.\nKey non-player characters include:\nDue to the expense of completing the plot, the players are periodically prompted to break away from the plot and increase their resources through trade and other open-ended play.\n\nX2 is set within the X-Universe, which consists of 130 sectors connected by two-way jumpgates. The main area of each sector typically contains several stations and at least one gate. The game is open-ended allowing the player to go where they like, when they like, doing whatever they like; a player is limited only by their in-game status and resources. As such, a driving force of the game is to acquire credits, the universal currency and status.\n\nUsing credits, a player can buy wares from a station. These wares may then be flown to another station where they can be sold, ideally for a higher price. However, prices vary - from minute to minute, second to second - depending on demand. The less of a ware there is, the higher its price. As such, the X-Universe has a truly dynamic market-driven economy. A player can capitalize on emergent trends to make vast profits; or as easily, can waste money and time on a bad cargo choice. As a player builds profits they can buy equipment, weapons, ships and stations. The player can acquire an unlimited number of ships and stations, of varying size, shape and function. The player can build factories to produce goods (including weapons and shields) to sell or consume. As the factories require resources, the player can set up ships to perform trading tasks for factories such as buying resources from other stations or selling the product.\n\nThe game contains numerous races. Several races feature a full economy and can be interacted with by the player through trading, reputation and missions. Several hostile races limit the amount of interactivity to combat. Reputation between the player and the social races can be built up through missions, defending their space, or trading in their space. The reputation affects how these individuals of that races respond to the player, and what kind of missions are offered. A player status is categorized according to 'Mercantile' skill, 'Combat' skill, and a 'Notoriety' ranking for each race.\n\nAn expansion pack called \"X2: The Return\" was in development but was cancelled in favour of X3.\n\n\"X2: The Threat\" received \"average\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Many reviewers praised the graphics and the amount of freedom offered to the player. Common complaints were that the game, like its predecessors, was quite slow-paced and had a steep learning curve.\n\nIGN gave the game an average review, praising the visuals and display, but expressing frustration with elements of gameplay. Wrote IGN, \"there are better places to go for trading simulations, and better places to go for space combat. \"X2\"s ambitions in trying to meld both themes ended up falling short of what most people would find entertaining... its complexity [as a trading simulator] is wasted when the money is really made with only one type of product.\" GameSpot referred to the game as a \"diamond in the rough\" for patient players, as well as \"extremely ambitious but not very accessible.\" \"Eurogamer\" criticized the game for being for \"hardcore fans only\" because of its complexity, also calling it a \"superbly ambitious game which achieves much of what it sets out to do.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1895060", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1895060", "title": "Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories", "text": "Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\n\nGrand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories is an action-adventure game developed in a collaboration between Rockstar Leeds and Rockstar North, and published by Rockstar Games. It was released in October 2005, for PlayStation Portable, it is the ninth game in the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series and was preceded by \"Grand Theft Auto Advance\" and succeeded by \"\".\n\nA port for PlayStation 2 was released in June 2006 in North America. At the time of release, the recommended retail price of the PS2 port was around half the price of the PSP version. The PS2 port does not feature the custom soundtrack ripping capability, in comparison to its PSP counterpart. It was also released for iOS, Android and Fire OS devices in December 2015, February 2016, and March 2016, respectively.\n\nSet in the fictional Liberty City, the game is a prequel to \"Grand Theft Auto III\", taking place three years prior, in 1998. It features many returning characters, including the game's protagonist, Toni Cipriani, a high-ranking member of the Leone Crime Family, who first appeared in \"GTA III\" as a character who gave missions to protagonist Claude. The game's story revolves around Toni's return in Liberty City after a long absence and his rise in power within the Leone Family, working to earn the respect and trust of his boss, Salvatore Leone. It also offers background for some of the characters, gangs, and locations featured in \"GTA III\".\n\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\" is an action-adventure game set in an open world environment and played from a third-person perspective. Liberty City's layout is largely similar to \"Grand Theft Auto III\", but it also incorporates elements found in \"Grand Theft Auto III\"'s successors, such as more indoor environments, clothing changes, and motorcycles. In keeping with recent \"Grand Theft Auto\" games, the player has more flexibility in terms of moving the camera around for viewing surroundings (\"Grand Theft Auto III\" is noticeably limited in that respect). Things that are omitted from the game are the ability to climb and the ability to swim – contact with deep bodies of water is instantly fatal. The overall game's open world, as it is based upon the original Liberty City layout, is considerably smaller than that of \"San Andreas\".\n\nDifferently from \"GTA III\", motorcycles are usable in the game. Though flyable aeroplanes and helicopters can be found in \"Vice City\" and \"San Andreas\", flyable aeroplanes cannot be found in \"Liberty City Stories\", and helicopters are only accessible through certain exploits.\n\nThe PSP version of \"Liberty City Stories \"has a multiplayer mode, for up to six players through Wi-Fi ad-hoc mode (same area). The game features seven modes of wireless multiplayer gaming, in which various pedestrian and character models are from the single player mode avatars. These multiplayer modes were removed in the PS2 and mobile versions.\n\n\"Liberty City Stories\" takes place in 1998 within the fictional Liberty City, and forms part of the \"3D Universe\" canon of the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series. Set three years before the events of \"Grand Theft Auto III\", the setting features several areas that are different from the 2001 setting, including locations that are being constructed, or facilities and buildings that are no longer around in the future setting. An example of this is the district of Fort Staunton, which represents a virtual version of a \"Little Italy\" district, before events in the game later lead to it becoming a construction site in 2001.\n\nLike previous Grand Theft Auto games, \"Liberty City Stories\" features an array of notable actors in its cast. Several characters from \"Grand Theft Auto III\" make appearances in the game, receiving notable changes in appearance and lifestyles to reflect who they were in 1998. Although Frank Vincent returns to reprise his original role in both \"Grand Theft Auto III\" and \"\", other returning characters from \"Grand Theft Auto III\" were voiced by new actors. For instance, Fiona Gallagher replaced Debi Mazar as Maria Latore, and Will Janowitz replaced Kyle MacLachlan as Donald Love.\n\nIn 1998, Leone mobster Antonio \"Toni\" Cipriani returns to Liberty City, after having been abroad following a murder he committed for the Leone Family. Upon his return, Don Salvatore Leone welcomes him back, before assigning him to work under another Leone mobster, Vincenzo \"Lucky\" Cilli. At the same time, Toni finds his mother disapproves of his rank in the Leone family, and is forced to stay away from her when she calls a hit on him. After Toni escapes being arrested on a job, he quickly discovers Vincenzo seeks to take his place within the Leone family. When Vincenzo tries to murder him, Toni kills him in retaliation. With Vincenzo dead, Salvatore assigns work to Toni, including looking after his trophy wife Maria.\n\nToni soon uncovers evidence that Sicilian Mafia underboss Massimo Torini is orchestrating plans for minor gangs to take control of Leone territory, whilst they're engaged in a war with the Sindacco Family and the Forrelli Family. After helping to escort Salvatore downtown as problems arise, Toni earns his trust and becomes a made man, causing his mother to call off the hit on him. Toni soon finds himself entrusted with killing the city's mayor, controlled by the Forellis, and assisting media mogul Donald Love into becoming his replacement. However, Donald goes bankrupt after he loses to his rival Miles O'Donovan, who promptly has Salvatore arrested on several charges soon after his election. Toni remains loyal to him, and assists him by killing Don Paulie Sindacco, as revenge for having Salvatore arrested, effectively ending the Sindaccos. He then destroys Fort Staunton for Donald, allowing him to rebuild his fortune for the future, while weakening the Forellis.\n\nWith the Leone Family now the strongest and sole-surviving Mafia family in Liberty City, Salvatore soon finds himself targeted by his rivals, forcing Toni to protect him before his trial. Upon being released on bail, Salvatore quickly deduces that Torini organized the mob war and rigged the mayoral elections. Suspecting he will likely kidnap O'Donovan to prevent the charges against him being dropped, Salvatore tasks Toni with handling the matter, who rescues O'Donovan and kills Torini. Salvatore then convinces the mayor he is in the Leones' debt and demands him to grant his family protection. He later reveals that Torini was working for his uncle, who wanted to weaken his nephew's control over the city for not paying him tribute. With his uncle no longer a threat, Salvatore and Toni settle in with controlling the city.\n\nAs stated in an IGN preview, \"Rockstar dropped Renderware in favor of a brand new in-house engine to best utilize the resolution, texture density and particle effects of the PSP\". Until the release of \"Liberty City Stories\", RenderWare had been the game engine behind every 3D game in the \"Grand Theft Auto III\" era. \"Liberty City Stories\" used Image Metrics for the game's facial animation.\n\nIn April 2013, the game was released on PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Network using the PlayStation 2 backward compatibility.\n\nAn enhanced port of the game, with touchscreen controls, real-time lighting, high-definition textures and draw distance, was released in December 2015 for iOS, February 2016 for Android and March 2016 for Fire OS.\n\n\"Liberty City Stories\" features ten radio stations, which consist of a mix of both licensed music and tracks created specifically for the game, and talk radio stations. A feature for the PSP version of the game is the ability to listen to custom soundtracks.\n\nTo implement the custom soundtrack feature, Rockstar placed the application called \"Rockstar Custom Tracks v1.0\" on the official site under the \"Downloads\" section. This then gave people the chance to use the custom soundtracks feature. The application is based on Exact Audio Copy.\n\n\"Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories\" received \"generally favorable\" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic.\n\nIn the United States, the PlayStation 2 version of \"Liberty City Stories\" had sold 1 million copies by February 2007. In the United States alone, \"Liberty City Stories\" PSP release sold 980,000 copies and earned $48 million by August 2006. During the period between January 2000 and August 2006, it was the 16th highest-selling game launched for the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS or PlayStation Portable in that country. As of 26 March 2008, \"Liberty City Stories\" sold 8 million copies according to Take-Two Interactive. The PlayStation Portable version of \"Liberty City Stories\" received a \"Double Platinum\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 600,000 copies in the United Kingdom. ELSPA gave the game's PlayStation 2 version a \"Platinum\" certification, for sales of at least 300,000 copies in the region.\n\nThe PlayStation 2 port was criticised for lacking improvement, the same portable coding and removing certain features from the PSP version.\n"}
{"id": "1895063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1895063", "title": "Sharavati", "text": "Sharavati\n\nSharavati is a river which originates and flows entirely within the state of Karnataka in India. It is one of the few westward flowing rivers of India and a major part of the river basin lies in the Western Ghats. The famous Jog Falls, located about 24 km from Sagara, are formed by this river. The river itself and the region around it are rich in biodiversity and are home to many rare species of flora and fauna.\n\nThe river Sharavati originates at a place called Ambutheertha in the Thirthahalli taluk. According to ancient legend, the god Rama shot at the ground with his Ambu (translates to bow and arrow) because his wife, Sita, was thirsty. When his arrow hit the ground, water poured out (translates to Thirtha) and quenched her thirst. Because the river, according to the legend, originated with this event, the river is called \"Sharavati\" as \"Shara\" translates to arrow.\n\nThe total length of the river is around and it joins the Arabian Sea at Honnavar in Uttara Kannada district. On its way, the Sharavati forms the Jog Falls where the river falls from a height of 253 m. The river is dammed at Linganamakki; the portion of the river above the dam is upstream and the remaining is downstream. The major tributaries of the river are Nandihole, Haridravathi, Mavinahole, Hilkunji, Yennehole, Hurlihole, and Nagodihole. Sharavati river basin falls into two districts of Karnataka namely Uttara Kannada and Shimoga. The upstream river basin is extended to two taluks i e Hosanagar and Sagar. The entire basin has an area of . with upstream being . and the downstream being .\n\nThe river basin mainly consists of Pre-Cambrian rocks. The two major groups of rocks found in the Sharavati river basin are the Dharwar system and the peninsular gneiss.\n\nSoils in the Sharavati basin are mainly lateritic in origin and tend to be acidic and reddish to brownish in colour. The various type of soil found here are clay loamy, clayey, clayey-skeletal, and loamy. Four soil orders are found in the upstream river basin: ultisols, alfisols, inceptisols and entisols.\n\nWith a major part of the river lying in the Western Ghats, the Sharavati river basin receives a large amount of rainfall. Mean annual rainfall ranges from 6000 mm in the western side to 1700 mm in the eastern side of the basin. About 95% of the rainfall is received during the month of June to September (July being the rainiest) when the southwest monsoon is at its peak. There is some rainfall in the post monsoon season in the form of thundershowers mostly during October and some rainfall also occurs during the summer months of April and May.\n\nApril is usually the hottest month with the mean daily maximum temperature at 35.8C\nand the mean daily minimum at 22.2C.\n\nDuring the morning, the relative humidity exceeds 75% for most times of the year. During the months of monsoon, the relative humidity during the afternoons is approximately 60%. During the driest months (January to March), the relative humidity in the afternoon is less than 35%.\n\nThe Linganamakki dam located in the Sagar taluk has a length of and was constructed across the Sharavati river in 1964. It was designed to impound 4368 million cubic meter of water in an area of around , submerging of wetland and of dry land, the remaining being forest land and wasteland. The dam's height is above sea level. The total capacity of the reservoir is 152 TMC (Thousand Million Cubicfeet). It has a catchment area of nearly . It receives water mainly from rainfall and also from the \"Chakra\" and \"Savahaklu\" reservoirs, which are linked through Linganamakki through a canal. The water from Linganamakki dam flows to Talakalale Balancing Reservoir through a trapezoidal canal with a discharge capacity of 175.56 cubic metres per second. The length of this channel is about 4318.40 m with a submersion of . It has a catchment area of about . The gross capacity of the reservoir is 129.60 cu meters.\n\nThe Gerusoppa dam project was completed in 2002 with the main purpose of generation of electricity. It was constructed near the Gerusoppa village in the Uttara Kannada district. It has a height of 56 metres and a length of 545 metres.\n\nThe Power House on the right bank of the Gerusoppa dam consists of four Francis-type turbines coupled to the generating units of 60 MW each. The units are configured to operate at a design head of 47.5 m. An outdoor switchyard is located between the toe of the dam and the power house. Power from the outdoor yard is evacuated through a 220 kV double circuit transmission line connected to the state grid at Talaguppa.\n\nThe Gerusoppa Project is a KPC project and the Civil Chief Engineer at the time of completion of the project was K L Krishnamurthy. This is one of the projects constructed by R. N. Shetty under the name Naveen Mechanised Construction Company Private Limited. The Present Chief Engineer (Electrical) is Shivaji . The main power house was constructed by Mr.Chinna Nachimuthu.\n\nJog Falls is the highest waterfall in India if the single drop water fall and the volume of water are considered for height. Otherwise, it is the third highest waterfall in India. The first highest is Kunchikal Falls about 455 meters(1493 ft), and the second highest is Barkana Falls about 259 meters (850 ft); all three are located in Shivamogga district. The Sharavati river plunges 253 meters (830 ft) into a deep gorge here in four different segments called as \"Raja\", \"Roarer\", \"Rocket\" and \"Rani\". The volume of water that reaches Jog Falls is controlled upstream by the Linganamakki dam, and the falls are at their mightiest when water is released from the dam.\n\nThe Sharavati river basin is rich in biodiversity. In a survey conducted in the basin, 23 amphibians belonging to the families of Bufonidae, Ichthyophiidae, Microhylidae, Ranidae and Rhacophoridae were recorded. Of these, 15 species are endemic to the Western Ghats. The river lends its name to the following species of fish that have been discovered in its waters:\n\n\nRecently two new species of diatoms were discovered from Hirebhaskeri Dam of Sharavati River.\n\nA part of the Sharavati river basin was declared as a wildlife sanctuary on 20 April 1972. Spread over an area of , it has dense evergreen and semi-evergreen forests. Linganamakki reservoir, with an area of , is a part of this sanctuary. The remaining area has been divided into core zone (74.33 km.), buffer zone (170.67 km) and tourism zone (57.53 km). The altitude in the sanctuary varies from 94 m to 1102 m, the highest point being Devarakonda on the southern edge of the sanctuary. Temperatures range from 15° to 38 °C and the mean annual rainfall is 4500 mm.\n\nThe sanctuary has mainly evergreen, semi-green and some moist deciduous forests. Trees in the evergreen forest include species such as \"Dipterocarpus indicus\", \"Calophyllum tomentosum\", \"Machilus macrantha\", \"Caryota urens\" and \"Aporosa lindleyana\". In the semi-evergreen and moist deciduous forests, common species include \"Lagerstroemia lanceolata\", \"Hopea parviflora\", \"Dalbergia latifolia\", \"Dillenia pentagyna\", \"Careya arborea\", \"Emblica officinalis\", \"Randia\" sp., \"Terminalia\" sp. and \"Vitex altissima\".\n\nThe sanctuary is a refuge of the endangered lion-tailed macaque. Other mammals include tiger, leopard (black panther), wild dog, jackal, sloth bear, spotted deer, sambar, barking deer, mouse deer, wild boar, common langur, bonnet macaque, Malabar giant squirrel, giant flying squirrel, porcupine, otter and pangolin. Reptiles include king cobra, python, rat snake, crocodile and monitor lizard. Some of the avian species found in the sanctuary include three species of hornbill, paradise flycatcher, racket-tailed drongo and Indian lories and lorikeets.\n\nHonnemaradu is an island on the reservoir formed by the Linganamakki dam. It is located in the Sagar taluk of Shimoga district. This place is good for water sports and hence attracts its enthusiasts. Some of the water sports possible here are canoeing, kayaking and wind surfing. Bird-watching enthusiasts also visit this place.\n\n"}
{"id": "1895068", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1895068", "title": "Pitting corrosion", "text": "Pitting corrosion\n\nPitting corrosion, or pitting, is a form of extremely localized corrosion that leads to the creation of small holes in the metal. The driving power for pitting corrosion is the depassivation of a small area, which becomes anodic while an unknown but potentially vast area becomes cathodic, leading to very localized galvanic corrosion. The corrosion penetrates the mass of the metal, with a limited diffusion of ions. The mechanism of pitting corrosion is probably the same as crevice corrosion.\n\nThe more conventional explanation for pitting corrosion is that it is an autocatalytic process. Metal oxidation results in localized acidity that is maintained by the spatial separation of the cathodic and anodic half-reactions, which creates a potential gradient and electromigration of aggressive anions into the pit. For example, when a metal is present in an oxygenated NaCl electrolyte, the pit acts as anode and the metal surface acts as cathode. The localized production of positive metal ions in the pit gives a local excess of positive charge which attracts the negative chlorine ions from the electrolyte to produce charge neutrality. The pit contains a high concentration of MCl molecules which react with water to produce HCl, the metal hydroxide, and H+ ions, accelerating the corrosion process. In the pit, the oxygen concentration is essentially zero and all of the cathodic oxygen reactions take place on the metal surface outside the pit. The pit is anodic and the locus of rapid dissolution of the metal. The metal corrosion initiation is autocatalytic in nature however its propagation is not.\n\nThis kind of corrosion is extremely insidious, as it causes little loss of material with the small effect on its surface, while it damages the deep structures of the metal. The pits on the surface are often obscured by corrosion products.\n\nPitting can be initiated by a small surface defect, being a scratch or a local change in composition, or a damage to the protective coating. Polished surfaces display higher resistance to pitting.\n\nPitting Corrosion is defined by localized attack (microns - millimeters in diameter) in an otherwise passive surface and only occurs for specific alloy / environment combinations. Thus, this type of corrosion typically occurs in alloys that are protected by a tenacious (passivating) oxide film such as stainless steels, nickel alloys, aluminum alloys in environments that contain an aggressive species such as chlorides (Cl-). In contrast, alloy / environment combinations where the passive film is not very protective usually will not produce pitting corrosion. A good example of the importance of environment / alloy combinations is carbon steel. In environments where the pH is less than 10, carbon steel does not form a passivating oxide film and the addition of chloride results in uniform attack over the entire surface. However, at pH greater than 10 (alkaline) the oxide is very protecting and the addition of chloride results in pitting corrosion.\n\nBesides chlorides, other anions implicated in pitting include thiosulfates (SO), fluorides and iodides. Stagnant water conditions favor pitting. Thiosulfates are particularly aggressive species and are formed by partial oxidation of pyrite, or partial reduction of sulfate. Thiosulfates are a concern for corrosion in many industries: sulfide ores processing, oil wells and pipelines transporting soured oils, Kraft paper production plants, photographic industry, methionine and lysine factories.\n\nCorrosion inhibitors, when present in sufficient amount, will provide protection against pitting. However, too low level of them can aggravate pitting by forming local anodes.\n\nA single pit in a critical point can cause a great deal of damage. One example is the explosion in Guadalajara, Mexico on April 22, 1992, when gasoline fumes accumulated in sewers destroyed kilometers of streets. The vapors originated from a leak of gasoline through a single hole formed by corrosion between a steel gasoline pipe and a zinc-plated water pipe.\nFirearms can also suffer from pitting, most notably in the bore of the barrel when corrosive ammunition is used and the barrel is not cleaned soon afterwards. Deformities in the bore caused by pitting can greatly reduce the firearm's accuracy. To prevent pitting in firearm bores, most modern firearms have a bore lined with chromium.\n\nPitting corrosion can also help initiate stress corrosion cracking, as happened when a single eyebar on the Silver Bridge, West Virginia failed and ended up killing 46 people on the bridge in December, 1967.\n\n\n"}

The song, a slightly tongue-in-cheek salute to the glamour and excitement of a life in show business, is sung in the musical by members of \"Buffalo Bill's Wild West\" Show in an attempt to persuade Annie Oakley to join the production. It is reprised three times in the musical.\n\nThe song is also featured in the 1954 movie of the same name, where it is notably sung by Ethel Merman as the main musical number. The movie, directed by Walter Lang, is essentially a catalog of various Berlin's pieces, in the same way that \"Singin' in the Rain\"—which starred Donald O'Connor as well—was a collection of Arthur Freed songs. There was also a disco version of the song made during the 1970s, with Merman reprising her singing role in \"The Ethel Merman Disco Album\". The song became one of Ethel Merman's standards and was often performed by her at concerts and on television.\n\nOther singers to have recorded the song include Judy Garland, The Andrews Sisters (with Bing Crosby and Dick Haymes), Frank Sinatra, Harry Connick Jr. (from \"Come by Me\", 1999), Susannah McCorkle, Mary Hopkin, and Bernadette Peters. The Andrews Sisters version with Bing Crosby and Dick Haymes was recorded on March 19, 1947 and was the only version to reach the Billboard charts, albeit briefly at No. 25.\n\nIn his liner notes for Susannah McCorkle's version of the song on her \"Ballad Essentials\" album Scott Yanow writes \"usually performed as a corny razzle-dazzle romp, that piece was drastically slowed down by Susannah who performed all of its known lyrics, including stanzas that show Irving Berlin's lyrics were actually quite touching and meaningful\".\n\nTenor saxophonist Sonny Rollins did a rendition of the tune on his 1956 Prestige album, \"Work Time\".\n\n\n"}

The village lies about north of Cherhill and east of the town of Calne.\n\nThe Church of England parish church of St Swithin, in the southwest of the village, is from the late 12th century, when it belonged to Bicester priory. Work from the 12th and 13th centuries survives in the nave while the tower and clerestory are from the 15th. The finely-carved stone screen is also 15th-century and is described by Pevsner as \"what remains in one's memory\". In 1865 Henry Woodyer added the north porch and rebuilt the chancel with its side-chapels; the east window by Hardman is from the same time.\n\nThe church was designated as Grade I listed in 1960. Today it forms part of the Oldbury Benefice, a group of five rural parishes.\n\nThe rectory built c. 1840 was sold in 1968.\n\nIn 1997, Compton Bassett church gained notoriety when a local resident, 65-year-old Midge Mather, broke into the church and cut through the bell ropes because she could not stand the noise of the bells. It took her upwards of two hours after breaking down the doors to cut the ropes and when she got home she rang the police and told them what she had done. She was given a Conditional Discharge for her actions.\n\nA manor house stood at Compton Bassett in 1553. A later house with a courtyard, standing in 1659, was later called Compton Bassett House. In 1672 the courtyard was built over to form a rectangular house with corner towers, having white stone walls. The house was encased in brick in the 19th century, probably by George Heneage Walker-Heneage, Member of Parliament for Devizes 1838-1857. Its parkland extended south and west into Cherhill parish, and in 1830 a half-timbered lodge was built at the western entrance.\n\nThe house was demolished in the early 1930s, and in 1935 its stable block was converted to a house, also called Compton Bassett House.\n\nRAF Compton Bassett was opened as a communications training station in 1940, on farmland between Compton Bassett and Calne. Like nearby RAF Yatesbury, it continued in the post-war years before closing in 1964. The housing around the station continued to be used by RAF staff working at RAF Lyneham and other westcountry RAF bases, and in the 1980s by American service personnel stationed at US airbases such as Fairford and Greenham Common. The housing has now been sold to private buyers.\n\nThe former site of RAF Compton Bassett is now known as Lower Compton, after the petitioning by residents for a separate name, since it lies two miles from the village of Compton Bassett.\n\nThe village has a pub, the \"White Horse Inn\". There is no school; the small school of 1854, later a National School, closed in 1964 owing to the low number of pupils.\n\nThe travel writer Henry Maundrell was born in Compton Bassett in 1665. Major Clement Walker Heneage, awarded the Victoria Cross, was born here in 1831.\n\nArchitect Sir Norman Foster owned Compton Bassett House until 1992, and in 2008 it was bought by pop star Robbie Williams.\n\nIn May 2013, the comedian Michael McIntyre purchased a property in the village.\n\n"}

The company operates 19 development studios worldwide, and publishes games with a special focus on the mobile games market. Formerly a public company traded at the Paris Bourse, Gameloft was acquired by media conglomerate Vivendi in 2016.\n\nGameloft was founded by Michel Guillemot, one of the five founders of Ubisoft, on 14 December 1999. By February 2009, Gameloft had shipped over 200 million copies of its games since its IPO, as well as 2 million daily downloads of its games via the App Store for iOS. Gameloft's chief financial officer (CFO), Alexandre de Rochefort, noted that the company's games generated about 400 times more revenue on iOS than on Android, partially because Google did not develop its Google Play storefront to \"entice customers to actually buy products\"; as a result of which Gameloft heavily cut its investments in Android games development in November 2009. In July 2010, Gameloft instead attempted to sell Android games directly through its website, avoiding the use of Google Play.\n\nIn a May 2011 keynote, de Rochefort stated that he wanted to avoid moving the company to the NASDAQ stock exchange, as the U.S. games market appeared to be nothing more than a large economic bubble, especially when seeing Zynga's present total stock value.\n\nGameloft's games have often been accused of being clones of other properties; when asked about it at the November 2011 Consumer Electronics Show, chief executive officer (CEO) Michel Guillemot stated \"The videogame industry has always played around a limited number of themes. There is maybe one new idea a year.\" In response to many users commenting on Guillemot's remarks, Levi Buchanan of IGN defended Gameloft, stating that its games were usually well-polished, in contrary to the original concepts' games.\n\nBy July 2014, Gameloft announced that they would focus more strongly on quality than on quantity, as was stated to have previously been the case.\n\nIn April 2013, Texan company Lodsys filed a lawsuit against Gameloft, among other mobile game developers, for infringing its patent on in-app purchases. Similar lawsuits were previously intervened by Apple Inc., who claim to have licensed the technology from Lodsys for usage in its App Store.\n\nIn February 2012 and February 2016, Gameloft penned publishing contracts with GREE, Inc. and GungHo Online Entertainment, respectively, to facilitate its presence in the Asian market.\n\nIn October 2015, French media conglomerate Vivendi announced that they had acquired a 6.2% stake in Gameloft's stock, which was quickly raised to 10.2% a few days later. By February 2016, Vivendi had acquired 30% in the company, and launched a hostile takeover bid. In accordance with French law, Vivendi started a tender offer to acquire further shares.\n\nFollowing the announcement, Gameloft's board of directors strongly advised shareholders against selling stock to Vivendi to avoid the hostile takeover. By May 2016, Vivendi had won over the majority of shareholders, enabling them to move forward in the takeover.\n\nThe acquisition was completed on 1 June 2016, with Vivendi having acquired 56%, an absolute majority over Gameloft's ownership. Employees of Gameloft were presented with an open letter welcoming them to the new parent company's family.\n\nAnalysts believed that the takeover was just the first step towards also purchasing Ubisoft, another video game venture founded by Guillemot and his brothers, although Vivendi only held a 17.7% minority in that company at the time. In response to Vivendi's actions, Guillemot announced that he would step down from his company and join his brother Yves Guillemot at Ubisoft to prevent it from also being taken over. Guillemot later clarified that his stepping-down would take effect on 29 June.\n\nOn 8 June, the Guillemot brothers announced that they were regretfully selling their ownership in Gameloft to Vivendi. The transaction awarded Vivendi another 21.7% in Gameloft's capital. After Guillemot departed from Gameloft on 29 June, Vivendi set up a new board of directors for the company, with Vivendi's present chief operating officer (COO), Stéphane Roussel, appointed Gameloft's chairman and CEO, and Gameloft's previous CFO, de Rochefort, additionally taking over the management of the company's 39 subsidiaries. At that point, Vivendi owned 95.94% of Gameloft's share capital.\n\nGameloft is headquartered at 14 rue Auber, in the 9th arrondissement of Paris.\n\nGameloft operates 19 video game development studios worldwide. In July 2011, Glenn Watson, lead programmer of Gameloft's Auckland offshoot, stated that the company's management created a \"constant sense of urgency\" at its studio, having employees regularly work 12- to 14-hour days. A new studio in New Orleans was opened in August 2011, taking of advantage of tax breaks granted by the government of Louisiana in July 2009 to establish 150 new jobs. On 29 January 2013, Gameloft's India studio in Hyderabad was closed midway through the workday, leaving 250 people unemployed. Between June and August 2015, Gameloft's Tokyo location made roughly 80 people, effectively being closed. Additionally, on 8 July 2015, all operations at the company's New York City office were halted, and as many as 100 employees were laid off. Shortly after, in September 2015, Gameloft's Seattle studio was closed down and its 15 employees were let go. The studio was opened just a year prior to its closure. Seven studios were closed in total in 2015. Guillemot stated that these actions were taken to accommodate its \"ambitious cost reduction program\", instantiated after the company saw a net loss of in the fiscal year that ended on 30 June 2015. In January 2016, Gameloft opened a Nigerian marketing office for regional expansions, however, shut down its Auckland studio, firing roughly 160 employees. At the time, Gameloft Auckland was New Zealand's largest video game studio. Gameloft's Valencia, Spain location was shuttered in April 2016. In July 2017, Gameloft appointed John-Paul Burke as country manager for its subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Gameloft UK later closed in December 2019.\n\nIn October 2019, Gameloft announced a partnership with mobile operator Telecom Italia to open TIM I Love Games, a games subscription service for Android and iOS, exclusive to Italy and TIM Italy customers.\n"}

The church is located a few kilometres north of the centre of the village of Rollag. \n\nRollag Stave Church was probably originally built in second half of the 12th century. It was first mentioned in written sources in 1425. Rollag Stave Church is decorated with a mixture of artistic expressions from a series of periods from the early Middle Ages.\n\nThe church has been remodeled several times with not much left of the original building. Originally, the church had been a simple church with a rectangular nave. It was rebuilt around 1660 into a cruciform church. A new apse was added in 1666. This choir was replaced and enlarged in 1670. The transept was constructed in 1697–1698. A gallery was added in 1702. The sacristy was rebuilt in 1739. Around 1760, an additional lining wall was placed on top of the structure and the church was extended to the west. A Baroque pulpit was added in 1763.\n\nArchitect and art historian Herman Major Schirmer conducted surveys of Rollag Stave Church in 1911 while he chaired the Society for the Preservation of Ancient Norwegian Monuments.

He first came to prominence in the late 1950s as the right-hand-man of producer Phil Spector and went on to work with the Rolling Stones and Neil Young, among others. He also worked extensively in film scores, notably for films such as \"Performance\", \"The Exorcist\" and \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\". In 1983, he won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for co-writing \"Up Where We Belong\".\n\nBorn in Chicago, Illinois, United States, and raised on a farm in Newaygo, Michigan, Nitzsche, son of German immigrants, moved to Los Angeles in 1955 with ambitions of becoming a jazz saxophonist. He was hired by Sonny Bono, who was at the time an A&R (artists and repertory) executive at Specialty Records, as a music copyist. While there Nitzsche wrote a novelty hit called Bongo Bongo Bongo. Nitzsche wrote with Bono the song \"Needles and Pins\" for Jackie DeShannon, later recorded by the Searchers. His instrumental composition \"The Lonely Surfer\", entered \"Cash Box\" on August 3, 1963 and reached No. 37. \n\nHe became arranger and conductor for producer Phil Spector, and orchestrated the Wall of Sound for the song \"River Deep, Mountain High\" by Ike and Tina Turner. Nitzsche worked with Earl Palmer, Leon Russell, Roy Caton, Glen Campbell, Carol Kaye and Hal Blaine in The Wrecking Crew, the backing band for many pop acts such as the Beach Boys and the Monkees. Nitzsche arranged the title song of Doris Day's \"Move Over, Darling\" that was a successful single on the pop charts of the time.\nWhile organizing the music for the \"T.A.M.I. Show\" television special in 1964, he met the Rolling Stones and went on to play keyboards on their albums \"The Rolling Stones, Now!\" (\"The Rolling Stones No. 2\" in the UK), \"Out of Our Heads\", \"Aftermath\" and \"Between the Buttons\" as well as on their hit singles \"Paint It, Black\" and \"Let's Spend the Night Together\"; he also wrote the choral arrangements for \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\". In 1968 he introduced the band to slide guitarist Ry Cooder, a seminal influence on the band's 1969–1973 style.\n\nOn several Rolling Stones records, he was credited as player of the \"Nitzsche-phone\". In an obituary on \"Gadfly Online\", former Rolling Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham explained the credit:\n\nI made that up for the credits on those Stones albums—it was just a regular piano (or maybe an organ) mic'd differently. It was all part of this package that was created around the Stones. People believed it existed. The idea was meant to be: \"My god, they've had to invent new instruments to capture this new sound they hear in their brains.\" And they were inventing fresh sounds with old toys—therefore, it deserved to be highlighted—it was the read-up of creation, of imagination—getting credit for a job well done.\nHe collaborated with Neil Young, beginning with producing \"Expecting to Fly\" by Buffalo Springfield. In 1968, Nitzsche and Cooder co-produced Young's eponymous solo debut with David Briggs. As he was moving from baroque to hard rock, Young hired Nitzsche for The Stray Gators, the session musicians behind Young on \"Harvest\" (1972) and \"Time Fades Away\" (1973).\n\nNitzsche played electric piano with Crazy Horse throughout 1970. Despite frequent clashes with Billy Talbot and Ralph Molina, Nitzsche remained with the band after Young left in 1970. Nitzsche produced the band's 1971 self-titled debut album and sang lead vocal on \"Crow Jane Lady\". He left Crazy Horse after the album's commercial failure.\n\nWhile remaining prolific throughout the 1970s, he began to suffer from depression and problems connected to substance abuse. His relationship with Young began to deteriorate during the 1973 support tour for \"Harvest\" that yielded \"Time Fades Away\". During rehearsals, drummer Kenneth Buttrey demanded a salary of $100,000 to compensate for lost session work, leading Nitzsche (with support from bassist Tim Drummond) to prevail upon the singer to extend this salary to the other band members. Although Young reluctantly agreed, Nitzsche thought Young never got over it. He frequently spewed obscenities into his vocal mike (leading Young's sound engineers to disconnect it) and often quarreled with David Crosby, who joined the tour's final dates to assist with vocal harmonies. After he publicly castigated Young in a 1974 interview, the two men became estranged for several years and collaborated only sporadically. Later that year, he was dropped from the Reprise roster after recording a song criticizing executive Mo Ostin. This period culminated in his arrest for allegedly breaking into the home of and then raping ex-girlfriend Carrie Snodgress, formerly Young's companion, with a gun barrel on June 29, 1979. Snodgress was treated at the hospital for a bone fracture, cuts and bruises and had 18 stitches. The charge of rape by instrumentation (which carries a five-year sentence) was dismissed.\n\nIn 1979, Nitzsche produced Graham Parker's album \"Squeezing Out Sparks\". Nitzsche produced three Willy DeVille albums beginning in the late 1970s: \"Cabretta\" (1977), \"Return to Magenta\" (1978) and \"Coup de Grâce\" (1981). Nitzsche said DeVille was the best singer he had ever worked with.\n\nNitzsche began to concentrate more on film music rather than pop music in the mid-1970s, becoming one of the more prolific film orchestrators in Hollywood during the period. In 1983, he received the Academy Award for Best Song for co-writing \"Up Where We Belong\" (from the 1982 film \"An Officer and a Gentleman\") with Will Jennings and Buffy Sainte-Marie. Nitzsche had also worked on film scores throughout his career, such as his contributions to the Monkees movie \"Head\", the theme music from \"Village of the Giants\" (recycling an earlier single, \"The Last Race\") and the soundtracks for \"Performance\" (1970), \"The Exorcist\" (1973), \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" (1975), \"Hardcore\" (1979), \"The Razor's Edge\" (1984) and \"Starman\" (also 1984). He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Score and a Grammy for his contributions to \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\", his first of many studio projects with Scott Mathews.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, an inebriated Nitzsche was seen being arrested in Hollywood in an episode of the television show \"Cops\" after brandishing a gun at some youths who had stolen his hat. Attempting to explain himself to the arresting officers, he is heard exclaiming that he was an Academy Award winner. In 1997, he expressed interest in producing a comeback album for Link Wray, although this never materialized due to their mutually declining health.\n\nIn 2000, Nitzsche planned to work with Mercury Rev on \"All Is Dream\". Nitzsche intended to produce and orchestrate the record, having praised the band's 1998 album \"Deserter's Songs\", but he died before pre-production.\n\nNitzsche met his first wife, singer Gracia Ann May, while he was working for Capitol Records. His second wife was Buffy Sainte-Marie , with whom he co-wrote Academy Award winning song for 1982, \"Up Where We Belong.\" He also had a relationship with actress Carrie Snodgress.\n\nNitzsche suffered a stroke in 1998 which ended his career. He died in Hollywood's Queen of Angels - Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in 2000 of cardiac arrest brought on by a recurring bronchial infection. His interment was at Hollywood Forever Cemetery. He was survived by one son.\n\n\nWith Crazy Horse\n\nWith The Rolling Stones\n\nWith Neil Young\n"}

Following his work at Tufts, he wrote the 2006 book \"Good and Real: Demystifying Paradoxes from Physics to Ethics\", in which he defends a rigorously mechanistic materialism.

{"id": "1895101", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1895101", "title": "Al-Barakat", "text": "Al-Barakat\n\nAl-Barakat, or Al-Barakaat (), which means \"Blessings\" in Arabic, is a group of companies established in 1986 in Somalia. The firm is involved in the modern form of \"hawala\", an informal value transfer system and remittance method. By 2001, Al-Barakat had outlets in 40 countries, and was the country's largest private employer. It handled about $140 million USD a year from the Somali diaspora, and also offered phone and internet services.\n\nAfter the 9/11 attacks in United States, the US government listed Al-Barakat as a terrorist entity, seized its assets, and detained several people associated with the company. The firm's shut down placed an enormous strain on Somalia's economy, as a majority of residents were dependent on remittances sent by relatives based abroad. In 2006, the US and UN officially removed Al-Barakat from their blacklists, finding that there was no evidence of the company's involvement in funding of any terrorist activities. In 2014, a ceremony was held to mark the relaunching of the firm.\n\nAs of 20 October 2018 the Al-Barakat group of companies is sanctioned by the US Office of Foreign Assett Controls, and remains on the US watchlists. https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=379\n\nOn 12th February 2020, Barakaat Group of companies were entirely removed from the sanctions list by U.S Office of Foteign Assets Control (OFAC). This deletion completes a long process of delistings that spanned two decades and begun at the UN Sanctions Committee \nto finally conclude in early 2020 at OFAC for Owners, Executives, and\nMember Comapanies of the Group.\n\nAl-Barakat first began operations in 1986. It rose to prominence after the start of the civil war in Somalia in 1991, when money transfer business, known as \"hawalas\", had become the only way for expat Somalis to send funds to their relatives in the absence of a formal banking system.\n\n\"Hawalas\" is an ancient money transfer system, which uses gold, fuel, foodstuffs and electronics as a way of balancing the books between operators (\"hawaladas\") in different nations. Migrant workers can send money home to relatives by depositing money with a local \"hawalada\", who then instructs an agent to hand over the money in the recipient's country of residence.\n\nAfter the September 11, 2001 attacks, the effects of anti-terrorist financing measures of the US government and other participating countries were disastrous for Al-Barakat.\n\nThe Al-Barakat network subsequently came under attack, as the US government claimed that \"hawala\" brokers may have helped fund terrorist activities by funneling millions of dollars from the United States to the terrorist organizations, including Al-Qaeda. Shortly afterwards in 2001, the US authorities shut down Al-Barakat Bank's overseas money remittance channel, labeled the bank \"the quartermasters of terror\", and listed it as a terrorist entity.\n\nHowever, despite numerous investigations, nothing was found to link Al-Barakat to terrorist activities as was outlined by the 9/11 Commission. By early 2003, only four criminal prosecutions had been filed and none involved charges of aiding terrorists. The 9/11 Commission Report later confirmed that the bulk of the funds used to finance the assault on the Twin Towers were not sent through the \"hawala\" system, but rather by inter-bank wire transfer to the SunTrust Bank in Florida. Nevertheless, the Al-Barakat network was severely impacted, and millions of Somalis were still cut off from funds transferred to their relatives that remained frozen pending conversion of the UN blacklisting.\n\nAdditionally, several captives that were housed in extrajudicial detention in the Guantanamo Bay detainment camps in Cuba were held because Joint Task Force Guantanamo (JTF-GTMO) intelligence analysts asserted that they had some kind of connection to Al-Barakat. Among these captives were Mohammed Sulaymon Barre and Ilkham Turdbyavich Batayev.\n\nWeaknesses in the case attempting to associate Al-Barakat with terrorist groups emerged early on, after thorough investigations were carried out in the firm's headquarters and branches. The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, also known as the 9/11 Commission, which was set up on November 27, 2002, \"to prepare a full and complete account of the circumstances surrounding the September 11 attacks\", including preparedness for and the immediate response to the attacks, cited no direct evidence that Al-Barakat was involved in terrorist funding. Additionally, the FBI agent who had led the second U.S. delegation said diligent investigation in the UAE revealed no \"smoking gun\" evidence — either testimonial or documentary — showing that Al-Barakat was funding AIAI or al-Qaeda. In fact, the U.S. team could find no direct evidence at all of any real link between Al-Barakat and terrorism of any type. The two major claims, that Bin Ladin was an early investor in Al-Barakat and that the firm diverted a certain portion of its money through its system to AIAI or Al-Qaeda, could not be verified. Jumale and all the Al-Barakat witnesses denied any ties to al-Qaeda or AIAI, and none of the financial evidence the investigators examined directly contradicted these claims. Moreover, some of the claims made by the early intelligence, such as the assertion that Jumale and Bin Ladin were in Afghanistan together, proved to be wrong.\n\nIn October 2009, Al-Barakat's Swedish branch was removed from the United Nations' list of terrorist organizations. The company had been on the list for the past eight years, and had had its bank account funds frozen. According to the Swedish Public Radio broadcaster SR, the UN did not explain why it had elected to remove Al-Barakat from its terror list. However, it has been suggested that the change in the European Union's position regarding the many organizations that were included on the UN terror list on weak grounds might have influenced the UN's position. Al-Barakat was subsequently able again to access its bank account funds.\n\nOn 17th Feb 2012, all of the Al-Barakat companies were finally removed entirely. The case against the firm was also closed, as it was delisted by the UN Security Council al-Qaida Sanctions Committee. The delisting included Al-Barakat group of companies owner and CEO Mr. Ahmed Nur Jim'ale, along with all of the 17 listed entities associated with Al-Barakat Group of Companies. Among the latter were Barakat Bank of Somalia, Al-Barakat Exchange and Barakat Telecommunications Company.\n\nOn 30 June 2016, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) completely removed Mr. Ahmed Nur Jim'ale from its listing and this completes the cycle of delisting process of Al Barakaat Group owner from International Sanctioning bodies.\n\nFurther, on 12th February 2020, OFAC delisted All Barakaat related companies as well as the last listed executive from this group of companies Mr. KAHIE, Abdullahi Hussein. \n\nIn 2014, a ceremony was held to mark the relaunching of the Al-Barakat firm.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1895117", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1895117", "title": "Dido, Queen of Carthage (play)", "text": "Dido, Queen of Carthage (play)\n\nDido, Queen of Carthage (full title: The Tragedie of Dido Queene of Carthage) is a short play written by the English playwright Christopher Marlowe, with possible contributions by Thomas Nashe. It was probably written between 1587 and 1593, and was first published in 1594. The story focuses on the classical figure of Dido, the Queen of Carthage. It tells an intense dramatic tale of Dido and her fanatical love for Aeneas (induced by Cupid), Aeneas' betrayal of her and her eventual suicide on his departure for Italy. The playwrights relied on Books 1, 2, and 4 of Virgil's \"Aeneid\" as primary source.\n\n\n\"Dido\" is based on books 1, 2 and 4 of The \"Aeneid,\" but the author makes several deviations from this material. Pigman draws attention to how imitators 'exploit... the historical distance between a text and its model', leading to 'crucial departures from, sometimes criticisms of, the model'. Stump suggests that these changes in \"Dido, Queen of Carthage\" make a mockery of Aeneas. They notably include: \n\nJupiter is fondling Ganymede, who says that Jupiter's wife Juno has been mistreating him because of her jealousy. Venus enters, and complains that Jupiter is neglecting her son Aeneas, who has left Troy with survivors of the defeated city. Aeneas was on his way to Italy, but is now lost in a storm. Jupiter tells her not to worry; he will quiet the storm. Venus travels to Libya, where she disguises herself as a mortal and meets Aeneas, who has arrived, lost, on the coast. He and a few followers have become separated from their comrades. He recognises her, but she denies her identity. She helps him meet up with Illioneus, Sergestus and Cloanthes, other surviving Trojans who have already received generous hospitality from the local ruler Dido, Queen of Carthage. Dido meets Aeneas and promises to supply his ships. She asks him to give her the true story of the fall of Troy, which he does in detail, describing the death of Priam, the loss of his own wife and his escape with his son Ascanius and other survivors.\n\nDido's suitor, Iarbas, presses her to agree to marry him. She seems to favour him, but Venus has other plans. She disguises Cupid as Aeneas's son Ascanius, so that he can get close to Dido and touch her with his arrow. He does so; Dido immediately falls in love with Aeneas and rejects Iarbas out of hand, to his horror and confusion. Dido's sister Anna, who is in love with Iarbas, encourages Dido to pursue Aeneas. Dido and Aeneas meet at a cave, where Dido declares her love. They enter the cave to make love. Iarbas swears he will get revenge. Venus and Juno appear, arguing over Aeneas. Venus believes that Juno wants to harm her son, but Juno denies it, saying she has important plans for him.\n\nAeneas's followers say they must leave Libya, to fulfil their destiny in Italy. Aeneas seems to agree, and prepares to depart. Dido sends Anna to find out what is happening. She brings Aeneas back, who denies he intended to leave. Dido forgives him, but as a precaution removes all the sails and tackle from his ships. She also places Ascanius in the custody of the Nurse, believing that Aeneas will not leave without him. However, \"Ascanius\" is really the disguised Cupid. Dido says that Aeneas will be king of Carthage and anyone who objects will be executed. Aeneas agrees and plans to build a new city to rival Troy and strike back at the Greeks.\n\nMercury appears with the real Ascanius (a.k.a. Cupid) and informs Aeneas that his destiny is in Italy and that he must leave on the orders of Jupiter. Aeneas reluctantly accepts the divine command. Iarbas sees the opportunity to be rid of his rival and agrees to supply Aeneas with the missing tackle. Aeneas tells Dido he must leave. She pleads with him to ignore Jupiter's command, but he refuses to do so. He departs, leaving Dido in despair. The Nurse says that \"Ascanius\" has disappeared. Dido orders her to be imprisoned. She tells Iarbas and Anna that she intends to make a funeral pyre on which she will burn everything that reminds her of Aeneas. After cursing Aeneas' progeny, she throws herself into the fire. Iarbas, horrified, kills himself too. Anna, seeing Iarbas dead, kills herself.\n\nThe play was first published in 1594, a year after Marlowe's untimely death in Deptford, by the widow Orwin for the bookseller Thomas Woodcock, in Paul's Churchyard. The title page attributes the play to Marlowe and Nashe, and also states that the play was acted by the Children of the Chapel. That company of boy actors stopped regular dramatic performance in 1584, but appears to have engaged in at least sporadic performances in the late 1580s and early 1590s, so that scholars give a range of 1587–93 for the first performance of \"Dido\".\n\nThe nineteenth-century scholar Frederick Gard Fleay attempted to delineate the collaborators' respective shares in the text, and assigned to Nashe these portions – Act I, scene i (second part, after line 122); Act III, scenes i, ii, and iv; Act IV, scenes i, ii, and v; — and the rest to Marlowe. However, subsequent critics have not concurred in this assessment, most notably the investigations of Knutowski, R.B. McKerrow, and Tucker Brooke found very little that they felt could be credited to Nashe. While Frederick S. Boas admitted a few details had parallels in Nashe's published works and some words or meanings are found in Nashe's works but not otherwise used by Marlowe, \"the scenes in which these passages and phrases appear have, as a whole, the stamp of Marlowe.\" Some critics have virtually ignored the participation of Nashe — yet the presence of a collaborator may help to explain the play's divergences from Marlowe's standard dramaturgy. No other play by Marlowe has such a strong female lead character, and in no other \"is heteroerotic passion the centripetal force of the drama's momentum.\"\n\nThe 18th-century English composer Stephen Storace wrote an opera titled \"Dido, Queen of Carthage\" (1794) — alleged, by his sister Anna (Nancy) Storace, for whom the title role was written, to have been his greatest work – which largely set Marlowe's play to music. It was also the only one of Storace's works to have been completely sung throughout, with no spoken dialogue. However, the work was never published, as Storace's impresario Richard Brinsley Sheridan wished to retain control over productions of it. A single copy was kept at the Drury Lane Theatre, to prevent pirated versions appearing elsewhere – and the opera is presumed to have been lost in the 1809 Drury Lane Theatre fire, since nothing of it has survived.\n\nAn adaptation of the play was broadcast on BBC Radio 3 on 30 May 1993, the 400th anniversary of Marlowe's death, along with \"The Massacre at Paris\", directed by Alan Drury and Michael Earley and featuring Sally Dexter as Dido, Timothy Walker as Aeneas, Jeremy Blake as Iarbas, Ben Thomas as Achates, Teresa Gallagher as Anna/Juno and Andrew Wincott as Cupid.\n\n\n"}

It is a modern adaptation of freighting, in which dogs were used as freight animals to move cargo. Many breeds participate in this sport, with dogs being separated into classes by weight. Sled dog and bull breeds excel within their respective weight classes, having been historically bred to pull sleds and carts as working dogs, respectively. \n\nThe dog is hitched to the cart or sled with a specially constructed harness designed to spread the weight and minimize the chance of injury. Since IWPA's organization in 1984, no dogs have been hurt in competition.\n\nDog weight pulling competitions are sanctioned by various non-profit organizations. In North America the International Sled Dog Racing Association has sanctioned contests in association with their races. The International Weight Pulling Association was organized in 1984 to promote the heritage of the working dog. IWPA operates in North America.\n\nSince 2000, the American Pulling Alliance has also offered sanctioned competitions in North America as well as Europe. The United Kennel Club also includes Weight Pull as one of their dog sports. Alaskan Malamute Clubs in the UK, and Australia offer sanctioned weight pull competitions based on the Alaskan Malamute Club of America's weight pull rules. Other breed clubs also offer weight pull, such as American Dog Breeders Association. In the 2010s other organizations started offering sanctioned competitions, such as National Working Dog Association. In 2012, GPA (Global Pulling Alliance) was formed to focus on educating the general public about the sport of weight pulling as a positive outlet for active canines across the globe. GPA holds competitions in 6 countries; United Kingdom, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Philippines, Ireland, and the United States, and continues to add to their list as the sport grows in popularity. Other organizations are springing up in Europe and Asia as the sport becomes increasingly more popular.\nBulgaria also has started to promote the sport by a club called Weight Pulling & Sporting Dogs Bulgaria. Since 2014 Lithuania has a dog weight pulling club called \"Weight Pulling Lithuania\". \n\nThe activity has being criticised for cruel or harmful by animal rights activists.\n\n"}

Saint Augustine in \"City of God (De Civitate Dei)\" (14.24) mentions some performers who did have \"such command of their bowels, that they can break wind continuously at will, so as to produce the effect of singing.\" Juan Luis Vives, in his 1522 commentary to Augustine's work, testifies to having himself witnessed such a feat, a remark referenced by Michel de Montaigne in an essay.\n\nThe professional farters of medieval Ireland were called braigetoír. They are listed together with other performers and musicians in the 12th century \"Tech Midchúarda\", a diagram of the banqueting hall of Tara. As entertainers, these braigetoir ranked at the lower end of a scale headed by bards, fili, and harpers.\n\nOne late medieval flatulist is mentioned in an entry in the 13th-century English \"Liber Feodorum\" or \"Book of Fees\". It lists one Roland the Farter, who held Hemingstone manor in the county of Suffolk, for which he was obliged to perform \"\"Unum saltum et siffletum et unum bumbulum\"\" (one jump, one whistle, and one fart) annually at the court of King Henry II every Christmas. The \"Activa Vita\" character in the 14th century allegorical poem Piers Plowman appears to number farting among the abilities desirable in a good entertainer in general, alongside storytelling, fiddling, or playing the harp. This poem translates to \"As for me, I can neither drum nor trumpet, nor tell jokes, nor fart amusingly at parties, nor play the harp.\"\n\nIn Japan, during the Edo period, flatulists were known as \"heppiri otoko\" (放屁男), lit. \"farting men.\"\nAlso see He-gassen (屁合戦) for Edo-period art scrolls depicting \"farting competitions\".\n\n\n\n"}

It is the most pacifist group in Japan of seven religious movements surveyed by Robert Kisala. The main practice of Nichiren Buddhism is to chant \"Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō\". Nipponzan-Myōhōji monks, nuns and followers beat hand drums while chanting the \"Daimoku\", and walk throughout the world promoting peace and non-violence.

{"id": "1895180", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1895180", "title": "Graham Berry", "text": "Graham Berry\n\nSir Graham Berry, (28 August 1822 – 25 January 1904), \nAustralian colonial politician, was the 11th Premier of Victoria. He was one of the most radical and colourful figures in the politics of colonial Victoria, and made the most determined efforts to break the power of the Victorian Legislative Council, the stronghold of the landowning class.\n\nBerry was born in Twickenham, near London, where his father, Benjamin Berry, was a licensed victualler. He had a primary education until 11 years old, then became an apprentice draper. In 1848 he married Harriet Ann Blencowe, \nwith whom he had eleven children.\n\nIn 1852 he migrated to Victoria, and went into business as a grocer in Prahran, then as a general storekeeper in South Yarra. His business skills and Victoria's booming economy soon made him a wealthy man. After his first wife's death he married Rebekah Evans in 1871; the couple had seven children of their own. At his death, Berry was survived by eight of the children from his first marriage and all seven of the children from his second marriage.\n\nIn Victoria, Berry, by voracious reading, acquired the education he had missed in England, and taught himself economics, literature and philosophy. But all his life he retained a broad London accent, which many Victorian conservatives found offensive or amusing. In Parliament he once asked the Speaker: \"What is now before the 'Ouse?\" To which the Leader of the Opposition interjected: \"An H!\" He developed a powerful rhetorical style modelled on that of his hero Gladstone, equally effective in the rough-house of the colonial Parliament or on the hustings. The conservative newspaper \"The Argus\" conceded: \"His oratory might not be polished: it certainly was not—but it was passionate, and it told.\" Noted for his humour, Berry was nevertheless a tough and determined politician.\n\nBerry was elected to the Legislative Assembly for East Melbourne at a by-election in 1861, as what \"The Argus\" called \"an extreme liberal.\" At the general election later in the same year he switched to Collingwood, then famously the most radical electorate in the colony. He was re-elected in 1864, but his criticism of James McCulloch's government during the tariff crisis of 1865 led to his defeat in that year's snap election.\n\nIn 1866 Berry moved to Geelong, where he started a newspaper, the \"Geelong Register\", as a rival to the established \"Geelong Advertiser\". Using the paper as a platform, he was elected for Geelong West in February 1869. In 1877 he switched to Geelong, which he represented until February 1886. He was briefly Treasurer in John MacPherson's government in 1870. When Charles Gavan Duffy formed a strong liberal government in June 1871, Berry again became Treasurer. He was a convinced protectionist, and steered a bill for increased tariffs through the Parliament.\n\nAfter the conservative interlude of the Francis and Kerferd governments, Berry assumed leadership of the liberals and became Premier and Treasurer in August 1875. But the liberal majority in the Assembly was unreliable, and in October the government's budget was defeated and Berry resigned. He asked the Governor, Sir George Bowen, for a dissolution, but was refused. He then campaigned across the colony in opposition to the third McCulloch government. At the May 1877 election, with the powerful backing of the Melbourne \"Age\" under David Syme, he won a huge liberal majority in the Assembly and returned to office at the head of a radical ministry.\n\nBerry's election manifesto proposed a punitive land tax designed to break up the squatter class's great pastoral properties – about 800 men at this time owned most of Victoria's grazing lands. He also advocated a high tariff to foster local manufacturing, which threatened to harm the importing and banking interests. He promised that if the Council, which was elected on a limited property-based franchise, blocked his program, it would be \"dealt with according to its deserts.\" He described the Council as \"a chamber which robs the people of the gold in the soil and the land God gave them.\" Given that there was no mechanism in the Victorian Constitution to override the Council, this was taken by conservatives to be a threat of revolutionary violence.\n\nBerry was a devoted constitutional liberal and had no plans for illegal measures. But the Councillors were sufficiently alarmed to pass a modified version of Berry's land tax bill, despite the urgings of the ultra-conservative former Premier Sir Charles Sladen to reject it outright. Berry, emboldened, next introduced a bill for the payment of members of the Assembly, which the trade unions were demanding so that working class candidates could be elected. Berry \"tacked\" the bill to the Appropriation Bill so that Council could not reject it without paralysing the Colony's finances. The Council resented this blackmail and at Sladen's urging declined to pass the bill, laying it aside.\n\nWith the two Houses deadlocked, Berry embarked on a public campaign of \"coercion\" against the Council. \"We coerce madmen\", he said, \"We put them into lunatic asylums, and never was anything more the act of madmen than the rejection of the Appropriation Bill.\" To bring matters to a head, on 8 January 1878 (\"Black Wednesday\") Berry's government began to dismiss public servants, starting with police and judges, arguing that without an Appropriation Bill they could not be paid. Berry next brought in a bill to strip the Council of its powers, which the Council of course rejected.\n\nFor the next two years Berry clung to office while the colony was gripped with class conflict, including huge torchlit processions through Melbourne sponsored by \"The Age\" (pro-Berry) and \"The Argus\" (anti-Berry) – although, remarkably, there was almost no violence. Almost no legislation was passed and the administration ground to a halt as funds ran out. Berry's next tactic was to pass a bill through the Assembly stating that finance bills did not need to be passed by the Council, but would become law when passed by the Assembly. Bowen thought this bill unconstitutional, but signed it on Berry's advice. When the Colonial Office learned of this, Bowen was recalled and the bill overturned.\n\nFinally a compromise was reached, the payment of members bill was passed, and the sacked public servants were reinstated. Berry then introduced another bill to reduce the powers of the Council. When this was rejected, he decided to appeal directly to London. In 1879 Berry and another leading liberal, Charles Pearson, travelled to London to try to persuade the British Government to amend the Victorian Constitution in such a way as to reduce the power of the Council. Unfortunately for them, the Conservatives under Benjamin Disraeli were in power, and the Colonial Secretary, Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, refused to agree to Berry's requests.\n\nReturning to Melbourne empty-handed, Berry was welcomed by huge crowds, but the popularity of his government was declining and his majority in the Assembly was crumbling under the strain of the crisis. He tried to pass another bill to amend the Constitution, but in December 1879 it failed by one vote to gain the necessary two-thirds in the Assembly. Berry then resigned, and at the subsequent election he was very narrowly defeated. The conservatives under James Service formed a weak government, which resigned in June 1880, leading to another election, which the liberals won, though not as convincingly as they had done in 1877.\n\nBerry returned as Premier, and formed a much more moderate ministry than the one which had fallen in 1879. Both sides were exhausted by the struggle, and in July 1881 a modest reform bill was passed, including some reforms of Council elections, but no concessions on the essential powers of the Council. Berry, feeling he could do no more, resigned, and Bryan O'Loghlen formed another weak conservative government. Later Berry accepted office as Chief Secretary and Postmaster-General in a coalition government led by Service, from 1883 to 1886.\n\nIn 1886 Berry resigned from Parliament and was appointed Victorian Agent-General in London, then an important and prestigious post. He was also appointed Executive Commissioner to the Colonial and Indian Exhibition, for his services in connection with which he was created K.C.M.G., becoming Sir Graham Berry. He was lionised as a liberal hero in London. Berry was one of the representatives of Victoria at the Colonial Conference held in London in 1887, and took a prominent part in its proceedings. For his services in connection with the Paris Exhibition of 1889 he was appointed a Commander of the Legion of Honour by the French Government. Berry was also awarded the Order of the Crown of Italy.\n\nAlthough he was now 70, he was not yet done with politics. Returning to Melbourne in 1892, just as the great post-gold rush economic boom was collapsing and the colony entering a severe depression, he was elected for East Bourke Boroughs at the May 1892 elections. He was Treasurer in William Shiels's Liberal government, but the days of reforming liberalism in Victoria were over for the time being and he resigned in January 1893. In October 1894 he was elected Speaker, a post he held until September 1897, when he finally retired.\nBerry was granted a pension by Parliament, and devoted the remainder of his life to supporting the cause of Australian Federation. In 1897 he was elected a Victorian delegate to the Constitutional Convention which drafted the Australian Constitution, mainly because of the support of \"The Age\". At 75, however, he was too frail to contribute much except his prestige as one of the country's liberal heroes. He retired to the seaside with his enormous family, and died at St Kilda in 1904. He was given a state funeral and eulogised by Prime Minister Alfred Deakin.\n\n\"The Age\" editorialised on Berry's death: \"Sir Graham Berry had ten years of such storms as might well have daunted one less resolute. But he lived to see the triumph of almost all the great reforms he had fought for.\" This was not strictly true, since the conservative domination of the Legislative Council lasted unbroken for nearly a century after his death, but Berry certainly deserved to be remembered as the most determined radical politician in 19th century Victoria.\n\nBerry appears as a minor character in the 2003 film \"Ned Kelly\", played by Australian actor Charles Tingwell. Berry is portrayed as receiving Kelly's now famous Jerilderie Letter and reading it out loud to the officers in charge of the hunt, though in reality, Berry was never sent the letter, nor was it ever intended to be sent to him.\n\n"}

On 10 April 1653, he was made commandeur to replace flag captain Abel Roelants when Lieutenant-Admiral Maarten Tromp used \"Brederode\" as his flagship. In the Battle of Scheveningen, Tromp was killed. Kortenaer kept Tromp's standard raised to keep up morale (this was habitual for the Dutch on such occasions) and took command of his squadron. On 21 October 1653, Kortenaer was promoted to captain. In the years after the war, he often commanded squadrons as commodore when flag officers were absent.\n\nIn the Battle of the Sound (8 November 1658), serving as flag captain on \"Eendragt\", he beat off every Swedish attack while his commanding officer, Lieutenant-Admiral Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam, was debilitated by gout. After this heroic conduct against the Swedish, Kortenaer was promoted to vice-admiral on 8 May 1659 and knighted by Frederick III of Denmark in the Order of the Elephant. On 29 January 1665, shortly before the Second Anglo-Dutch War, he was made lieutenant-admiral of the Admiralty of de Maze. He wasn't given command of the confederate Dutch fleet because he was a supporter of the House of Orange. A British intelligence report stated, \"He is the best man they have\".\n\nDuring the Battle of Lowestoft on 13 June 1665, Kortenaer commanded the van and was second in overall command behind Van Wassenaer. He was fatally wounded early in the battle on \"Groot Hollandia\" by a cannonball hitting his hip and buried in Rotterdam in a marble grave memorial engraved with a poem by Gerard Brandt:\n\nSeveral ships of the Dutch navy have been named \"Kortenaer\" after the admiral, \n\n"}

As leader of the Croatian Social Liberal Party through the 1990s he remains to date the only Leader of the Opposition not to have been from either the Croatian Democratic Union or the Social Democratic Party.\n\nBudiša was born in Drniš, Croatia, Yugoslavia. He was one of the radical student leaders during the Croatian Spring in the 1970s. For his activities he was later sent to Lepoglava prison by Communist authorities. Before the arrival of democracy he worked as a librarian. In 1989 he was one of the founders of Croatian Social Liberal Party and later its leader. During the 1990 elections his party joined Coalition of People's Accord and fared badly, including Budiša who failed to win a seat.\n\nIn August 1991, during the war, Budiša became a minister in war-time cabinet of Franjo Gregurić. In February 1992, he was the first ministers to break ranks, being opposed to the constitutional laws guaranteeing political autonomy of ethnic Serbs in exchange for their formal recognition of Croatian sovereignty. He announced his decision to resign during televised session of the Croatian Parliament, and thus became rallying point for many Croatians dissatisfied with the policies of Franjo Tuđman.\n\nAlthough he lost the presidential election of 1992 to Tuđman, he confirmed his status of opposition leader, beating many other, presumably more charismatic leaders like Savka Dabčević-Kučar and Dobroslav Paraga. His HSLS party also fared relatively well at those elections and later had even better results few months later on Chamber of Counties, regional and local elections, when HSLS reached its zenith.\n\nIn 1995, the united opposition won local elections for Zagreb and HSLS suggested a mayor. However, Franjo Tuđman abused his powers - starting the Zagreb Crisis - and blocked four HSLS mayors suggested, including Budiša.\n\nThis rise of HSLS proved to be short-lived. On the 1995 parliamentary elections many of its voters switched to rejuvenated Social Democratic Party of Croatia (SDP) and a centrist coalition. Still, HSLS remained the strongest opposition party in the lower house of the parliament. Two years later, the dissipation continued on local elections. Budiša reacted by floating plans for coalition government with Tuđman's Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), hoping to attract their voters. This led to a split with Vladimir Gotovac and creation of Liberal Party who opposed the HDZ's right politics.\n\nAfter that Budiša finally realised that the only way to get power lies in a broad coalition of all opposition parties, including SDP. He and Ivica Račan signed the coalition agreement in 1998 and convincingly won at the 2000 parliamentary election.\n\nThis triumph was marred by Budiša losing to Stjepan Mesić on the presidential elections held two weeks later. Budiša, who tried to woo followers of Franjo Tuđman during the second round, was embittered by this defeat and this led to his party turning increasingly right-wing and later squabbles with his government coalition partners. This resulted with him resigning from the post of president of HSLS on 12 July 2001 over dispute with SDP about whether to send Croatian generals to ICTY. Jozo Radoš was chosen to act instead of him.\n\nBudiša was resentful of having no post in the new government and publicly forced Račan to dismiss Goran Granić, the deputy prime minister and HSLS party member in order to put Budiša at that position, at which he remained for only a short time.\n\nOne of the points on which Budiša clashed with Mesić (and later Račan) was cooperation with ICTY. All this escalated in 2002 when Budiša and his party left the government in an unsuccessful bid to force new elections. The ultimate result was yet another fragmentation of his party and the formation of the Party of Liberal Democrats who supported the government.\n\nBack in opposition, Budiša first quit his party, and dramatically returned a year later - which was seen as a staged event - and then tried to return to power by forming a centre-right bloc together with the new Democratic Centre of Mate Granić. On 2003 parliamentary elections, this bloc fared badly, winning only three seats, with neither for the two party leaders. Although those three seats later proved crucial in helping Ivo Sanader to form a parliamentary majority, Budiša, like Granić, took responsibility for the disaster and on 17 December 2003 resigned party leadership. In 2009 after Darinko Kosor became the HSLS president, Budiša made a short comeback to politics and in the 2011 parliamentary elections he led the HSLS election list as number one in the IX. electoral district but in the elections HSLS didn't manage to win any seats in the parliament for the first time In Croatian parliamentary history. Soon after he left the party and retired from politics.\n"}

The NHL added two teams this season, a second team in Montreal, the Montreal Maroons and the first U.S. team, the Boston Bruins. Six teams each played 30 games.\n\nThe NHL regular-season champion Hamilton Tigers did not participate in the playoffs, as their players demanded to their owner, Percy Thompson, that they would not participate in the NHL championship series unless they received an additional $200 each for the extra six games played that year. Under their contracts, the Tigers players were to receive the same amount of money no matter how many games they played from December 1, 1924, to March 31, 1925 (even though the season started on November 29, 1924). NHL President Frank Calder was not amused, stating that the players would be fined or suspended if they did not play in the final series, but the players stated that they would rather retire than advantage be taken of them. The day of the final game of the Semi-Final, Tiger Shorty Green met with Calder to try to reach an agreement, but to no avail. The players were all suspended and fined $200 each, therefore eliminating themselves from the playoffs.\n\nBecause of the suspension, the semi-final playoff series between Montreal and Toronto became the NHL championship series. The Montreal Canadiens won the series and faced off against the Victoria Cougars of the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL) for the Stanley Cup. Victoria won the series, the last non-NHL team to win the Cup.\n\nPrior to the start of this hockey season, the Pacific Coast Hockey Association folded and two of its teams, the Vancouver Maroons and Victoria Cougars, joined the Western Canada Hockey League. This meant that after three seasons of having three leagues compete for the Stanley Cup, there were once again only two.\n\nAt the November 1924 NHL meeting, the NHL approved two new franchises, including its first franchise in the United States of America. Charles Adams of Boston was granted a franchise. The NHL also granted a second franchise for Montreal to James Strachan and Donat Raymond. Applications from New York City, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia were shelved.\n\nA new trophy was added for the 1924–25 NHL season. The original Lady Byng Trophy was donated by Lady Byng, wife of Governor General Viscount Byng of Vimy, to be handed out to the player who showed the best sportsmanship and gentlemanly conduct combined with performance in play. She presented it to Frank Nighbor of the Ottawa Senators.\n\nThis was the first season for the Montreal Maroons and Boston Bruins, the Bruins becoming the first American NHL team. It was also the last season for the Hamilton Tigers, which would dissolve at season's end. The number of games played per team was increased from 24 to 30.\n\nA new arena, the Montreal Forum, was built to house the Maroons. However, the Montreal Canadiens played in it first. Because the Canadiens' home rink, Mount Royal Arena, couldn't produce ice, the November 29th home opener against the Toronto St. Patricks was moved to the Forum. The Canadiens beat the St. Patricks 7–1, before 9,000 fans. A NHL attendance record of 11,000 was set on December 27, when the Maroons hosted the Canadiens.\n\nThe Maroons leaned on two former Ottawa Senators, Punch Broadbent and Clint Benedict they picked up from Ottawa before the season but still managed only fifth place. Broadbent scored a pair of goals in the Maroons' first ever victory, a 3–1 victory over Ottawa at the Forum in Montreal. Broadbent scored five goals in a game on January 7 as Montreal defeated the Tigers 6–2 in the Abso-Pure rink in Hamilton.\n\nOn December 17, goaltenders Jake Forbes of Hamilton and Alex Connell of Ottawa engaged in the first ever scoreless tie in a regular season game in NHL history.\n\nJust before the end of the season, the Bruins, which finished in last place, had a modest winning streak. First, they beat the Montreal Canadiens 3–2 March 3. Normand Shay scored the winning goal on a two on one break at 16:39 of the third period as Jimmy Herbert shot and then Shay pounced on the rebound and put it by Georges Vezina. The game was rough and referee Jerry Laflamme meted out quite a few penalties, including four minors to Lionel Hitchman of Boston. Howie Morenz starred in a losing cause with two goals. The Bruins then defeated the league-leading Hamilton Tigers 2–0 in their next game as Doc Stewart played well in goal.\n\nWith an increase in the number of NHL teams, the NHL changed its playoff format by having the second and third place teams play a two-game \"total goals\" series to see who played the number one seed for the NHL championship. The NHL champion would go on to play the winner of the Western Canada Hockey League for the Stanley Cup. As it happened, the Tigers, the first-place team went on strike, and the winner of the series between the second and third place teams, Montreal, became the NHL champion and played for the Cup.\n\nThe third seed Montreal Canadiens played against the second seed Toronto St. Patricks in a total goals series. The winner of that series was to go on and play the first seed team, the Hamilton Tigers. But it was not to happen that way. During the total goals series, the Hamilton players demanded $200 each for the extra six games played during the regular season and the league threatened to suspend the players and the team. Last-ditch efforts to reach a compromise failed and the Tigers were suspended. It was suggested that the Ottawa Senators be included in the playoffs, but Charlie Querrie and Leo Dandurand cited a fourth-place finish didn't qualify Ottawa a playoff berth and it was decided that Montreal and Toronto played for the league title. NHL president Frank Calder announced that the Canadiens played home games at the Forum, but Leo Dandurand said that they would be played at Mount Royal Arena unless it were necessary to move to the Forum, citing home games were home games, and the Canadiens played better in front of their own fans. Calder backed down from his stand. Montreal won the series against Toronto and earned the right to play for the Stanley Cup.\n\nIn the Western Canada Hockey League, the third place Victoria Cougars won its league championship faced the Montreal Canadiens for the Stanley Cup. The series was played in Patrick Arena in Victoria, except for game two, which was played at Denman Arena in Vancouver to gather greater fan support and more income. Victoria beat Montreal three games to one, out-scoring the Canadiens 16 to 8. Victoria was the first (and only to date) non-NHL team to win the Stanley Cup since the NHL's founding.\n\n\"Note: GP = Games played; G = Goals; A = Assists; Pts = Points\"\nThe NHL introduced its second individual award, the Lady Byng Trophy, named after its donor, Lady Byng, wife of Canada's Governor-General.

{"id": "1895211", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1895211", "title": "Robert Kane (philosopher)", "text": "Robert Kane (philosopher)\n\nRobert Hilary Kane (born 1938, Boston) is an American philosopher. He is Distinguished Teaching Professor of Philosophy at the University of Texas at Austin, and is currently on phased retirement.\n\nHe is the author of \"Free Will and Values\" (1985), \"Through the Moral Maze\" (1994), and \"The Significance of Free Will\" (1996: awarded the 1996 Robert W. Hamilton Faculty Book Award). He also edited the \"Oxford Handbook of Free Will\" (2004) and has published many articles in the philosophy of mind and action, ethics, the theory of values and philosophy of religion.\n\nKane studied philosophy from 1956 to 1960 at Holy Cross College (B.A. 1960), from 1958 to 1959 at the University of Vienna, and from 1960 to 1964 at Yale University (M.A. 1962, Ph.D. 1964).\n\nKane is one of the leading contemporary philosophers on free will. Advocating what is termed within philosophical circles \"libertarian freedom\", Kane argues that \"(1) the existence of alternative possibilities (or the agent's power to do otherwise) is a necessary condition for acting freely, and (2) determinism is not compatible with alternative possibilities (it precludes the power to do otherwise)\". It is important to note that the crux of Kane's position is grounded not in a defense of alternative possibilities (AP) but in the notion of what Kane refers to as ultimate responsibility (UR). Thus, AP is a necessary but insufficient criterion for free will. It is necessary that there be (metaphysically) real alternatives for our actions, but that is not enough; our actions could be random without being in our control. The control is found in \"ultimate responsibility\".\n\nUltimate responsibility entails that agents must be the ultimate creators (or originators) and sustainers of their own ends and purposes. There must be more than one way for a person's life to turn out (AP). More importantly, whichever way it turns out must be based in the person's willing actions. As Kane defines it,\n\nIn short, \"an agent must be responsible for anything that is a sufficient and necessary reason (condition, cause or motive) for the action's occurring.\"\n\nWhat allows for ultimacy of creation in Kane's picture are what he refers to as \"self-forming actions\" or SFAs — those moments of indecision during which people experience conflicting wills. These SFAs are the undetermined, regress-stopping voluntary actions or refrainings in the life histories of agents that are required for UR. UR does not require that \"every\" act done of our own free will be undetermined and thus that, for every act or choice, we could have done otherwise; it requires only that certain of our choices and actions be undetermined (and thus that we could have done otherwise), namely SFAs. These form our character or nature; they inform our future choices, reasons and motivations in action. If a person has had the opportunity to make a character-forming decision (SFA), he is responsible for the actions that are a result of his character.\n\nRandolph Clarke objects that Kane's depiction of free will is not truly libertarian but rather a form of compatibilism. The objection asserts that although the outcome of an SFA is not determined, one's history up to the event \"is\"; so the fact that an SFA will occur is also determined. The outcome of the SFA is based on chance, and from that point on one's life is determined. This kind of freedom, says Clarke, is no different than the kind of freedom argued for by compatibilists, who assert that even though our actions are determined, they are free because they are in accordance with our own wills, much like the outcome of an SFA.\n\nKane responds that the difference between causal indeterminism and compatibilism is \"ultimate control — the originative control exercised by agents when it is 'up to them' which of a set of possible choices or actions will now occur, and up to no one and nothing else over which the agents themselves do not also have control\". UR assures that the sufficient conditions for one's actions do not lie before one's own birth.\n\nIn his book defending compatibilism, \"Freedom Evolves\", Daniel Dennett spends a chapter criticising Kane's theory. Kane believes freedom is based on certain rare and exceptional events, which he calls self-forming actions or SFA's. Dennett notes that there is no guarantee such an event will occur in an individual's life. If it does not, the individual does not in fact have free will at all, according to Kane. Yet they will seem the same as anyone else. Dennett finds an essentially \"indetectable\" notion of free will to be incredible.\n\nKane is one of several philosophers and scientists to propose a two-stage model of free will. The American philosopher William James was the first (in 1884). Others include the French mathematician and scientist Henri Poincaré (about 1906), the physicist Arthur Holly Compton (1931, 1955), the philosopher Karl Popper (1965, 1977), the physicist and philosopher Henry Margenau (1968, 1982), the philosopher Daniel Dennett (1978), the classicists A. A. Long and David Sedley (1987), the philosopher Alfred Mele (1995), and most recently, the neurogeneticist and biologist Martin Heisenberg (2009), son of the physicist Werner Heisenberg, whose quantum indeterminacy principle lies at the foundation of indeterministic physics.\n\nKane's model goes beyond Daniel Dennett's by trying to keep indeterminism as late as possible in the process of deliberation, indeed as late as the decision itself in the SFAs (Self-Forming Actions). Kane's followers, Laura Waddell Ekstrom, Richard Double, and Mark Balaguer, as well as the philosopher Peter van Inwagen, agree that chance must be the direct cause of action. This makes them all radical libertarians, as opposed to those who limit chance to the early deliberative stages of the decision process, such as James, Popper, Margenau, Doyle and Martin Heisenberg, who are conservative or modest libertarians, following the two-stage models proposed by Dennett and Mele.\n\nIn his 1985 book \"Free Will and Values\", aware of earlier proposals by neurobiologist John Eccles, Popper, and Dennett, but working independently, Kane proposed an ambitious amplifier model for a quantum randomizer in the brain - a spinning wheel of fortune with probability bubbles corresponding to alternative possibilities, in the massive switch amplifier (MSA) tradition of Compton.\n\nHe says\n\nWhat I would like to do then, is to show how an MSA model, using Eccles' notion of critically poised neurons as a working hypothesis, might be adapted to the theory of practical, moral and prudential decision making.\nBut Kane was not satisfied with his solution. In the end he did not endorse it. He said it did not go far enough because it does not fully capture the notion of ultimate responsibility (UR) during rare \"self-forming actions (SFAs). It is merely a \"significant piece in the overall puzzle of a libertarian freedom.\" He explains that the main reason for failure is\nKane admits his basic failure is his location of indeterminism in the decision process itself. This makes chance the direct cause of action. He was actually quite bleak about the possibilities for a satisfactory libertarian model. He felt\n\"that any construction which escaped confusion and emptiness was likely to fall short of some libertarian aspirations - aspirations that I believe cannot ultimately be fulfilled.\" \nBut Kane claims that the major criticism of all indeterminist libertarian models is explaining the power to choose or do otherwise in \"exactly the same conditions,\" something he calls \"dual rational self-control.\" Given that A was the rational choice, how can one defend doing B under exactly the same circumstances?\" Kane is concerned that such a \"dual power\" is arbitrary, capricious, and irrational.\n\nKane's latest suggestion for his occasional self-forming actions argues that the tension and uncertainty in our minds stirs up \"chaos\" that is sensitive to micro-indeterminacies at the neuronal level.\nAll free acts do not have to be undetermined on the libertarian view, but only those acts by which we made ourselves into the kinds of persons we are, namely the \"will-setting\" or \"self-forming actions\" (SFAs) that are required for ultimate responsibility.\n\nNow I believe these undetermined self-forming actions or SFAs occur at those difficult times of life when we are torn between competing visions of what we should do or become. Perhaps we are torn between doing the moral thing or acting from ambition, or between powerful present desires and long-term goals, or we are faced with difficult tasks for which we have aversions.\nSince he is primarily interested in cases of \"liberty of indifference,\" the strong indeterminism he introduces raise the objection of loss of agent control, but Kane says the agent can beforehand decide to assume responsibility whichever way she randomly chose. This seems more like rationalization than reason, but Kane defends it.\n\"Suppose we were to say to such persons: 'But look, you didn't have sufficient or conclusive prior reasons for choosing as you did since you also had viable reasons for choosing the other way.' They might reply. 'True enough. But I did have good reasons for choosing as I did, which I'm willing to stand by and take responsibility for. If these reasons were not sufficient or conclusive reasons, that's because, like the heroine of the novel, I was not a fully formed person before I chose (and still am not, for that matter). Like the author of the novel, I am in the process of writing an unfinished story and forming an unfinished character who, in my case, is myself.'\" \n\n\n\n"}

It is one of the best-preserved temple complexes in Egypt. The area was used as the sixth Nome of Upper Egypt, south of Abydos.\n\nThe whole complex covers some 40,000 square meters and is surrounded by a hefty mudbrick enclosed wall. Dendera was inhabited in prehistory, a useful oasis on the banks of the Nile. It seems that pharaoh Pepi I (ca. 2250 BC) built on this site and evidence exists of a temple in the Eighteenth Dynasty (ca 1500 BC). The earliest extant building in the compound today is the Mammisi raised by Nectanebo II – last of the native pharaohs (360–343 BC). The features in the complex include: \n\nNearby is the Dendera necropolis, a series of mastaba tombs. The necropolis dates from the Early Dynastic Period of the Old Kingdom to the First Intermediate Period of Egypt. The necropolis runs the eastern edge of the western hill and over the northern plain.\n\nThe dominant building in the complex is the Temple of Hathor. The temple has been modified on the same site starting as far back as the Middle Kingdom, and continuing right up until the time of the Roman emperor Trajan. The existing structure began construction in the late Ptolemaic period, and the hypostyle hall was built in the Roman period under Tiberius.\n\nLayout elements of the temple are:\n\nDepictions of Cleopatra VI which appear on temple walls are good examples of Ptolemaic Egyptian art. On the rear of the temple exterior is a carving of Cleopatra VII Philopator (the popularly well known Cleopatra) and her son, Ptolemy XV Philopator Philometor Caesar (Caesarion), who was fathered by Julius Caesar. \n\nThe sculptured \"Dendera zodiac\" (or \"Denderah zodiac\") is a widely known relief found in a late Greco-Roman temple, containing images of Taurus (the bull) and the Libra (the balance). A sketch was made of it during the Napoleonic campaign in Egypt. In 1820 it was removed from the temple ceiling by French colonizers and replaced with a fake. There is controversy as to whether they were granted permission by Egypt's ruler, Muhammad Ali Pasha, to do so, or whether they stole it. The real one is now in the Louvre. Champollion's guess that it was Ptolemaic proved to be correct, and Egyptologists now date it to the first century BC.\n\nThe subterranean \"Hathor temple tombs\" total 12 chambers. Some reliefs are dated to as late as the reign of Ptolemy XII Neos Dionysos. The crypts reportedly were used for storing vessels and divine iconography. An opening in the \"Flame Room\" floor leads to a narrow chamber with representations on the walls of the objects which were kept in them. In the second chamber, a relief depicts Pepi I offering a statuette of the god Ihy to four images of Hathor. In the crypt, reached from the \"throne room\", Ptolemy XII has jewelry and offerings for the gods.\n\nHathor Temple has a relief sometimes known as the Dendera light because of a controversial fringe thesis about its nature. The \"Dendera light\" images comprise five stone reliefs (two of which contain a pair of what fringe authors refer to as lights) in the Hathor temple at the Dendera Temple complex located in Egypt. The view of Egyptologists is that the relief is a mythological depiction of a djed pillar and a lotus flower, spawning a snake within, representing aspects of Egyptian mythology.\n\nIn contrast to this interpretation, there is a fringe science suggestion that it is actually a representation of an Ancient Egyptian lightbulb.\n\nThe ceiling of the Hathor Temple was cleaned in a careful way that removed hundreds of years of black soot without harming the ancient paint underneath. Spectacular ceiling painting was exposed in the main hall, and some of the most vibrant and colourful paintings dating from antiquity are now visible.\n\nThe Dendera complex has long been one of the most tourist-accessible ancient Egyptian places of worship. It used to be possible to visit virtually every part of the complex, from the crypts to the roof. However, the highest part of the roof of Hathor temple has been closed since 2003. The second stage of the roof was closed in November 2004, after a tourist got too close to the edge and fell to her death on the bedrock below.\n\n\n"}

From 2004 to March 2009, Middelhoff was chairman of the supervisory board of Arcandor (previously KarstadtQuelle), and CEO of the company.\n\nThomas Middelhoff was born in Düsseldorf, Germany, the son of a textile businessman. He studied business at the University of Münster and received his doctorate at the Institute for Marketing under the supervision of Heribert Meffert. While at university, he was already working in his father's textile business. After graduating he was given a high post in the company.\n\nIn 1986 he moved to Bertelsmann, a multinational media corporation based in Germany, as assistant manager of the graphic firm in Gütersloh. In 1990, he became a member of the board of directors of Bertelsmann.\n\nMiddelhoff recognized the potential of the new digital media early. He made small investments into Firma Pixelpark in Berlin among others, on Bertelsmann's behalf. As an early believer in the rapid development of the Internet, he suggested a large financial participation of Bertelsmann in America Online (AOL) when it was still a young company, and created the joint venture AOL Europe, with a financial holding of $50 million for a 5% stake. This investment was extremely successful and would later influence Middelhoff's ascent in the company to chairman of the board. In May 1995, he became a member of the governing board of AOL, and during his time in this position Middelhoff became a \"close friend\" of AOL's founder, Steve Case.\n\nIn 1995, Bertelsmann and AOL started the joint venture AOL Germany. From November 1998 to July 2002, Middelhoff was the CEO of Bertelsmann. During this time it increased its internet activities by starting the online media portal BOL (Bertelsmann Online), which was sold to in 2002. But Bertelsmann soon stepped back from these online engagements, selling its shares of AOL-Europe back to Time Warner, which had merged with AOL in 2001. In January 2000 Middelhoff declined a directorship at AOL and resigned from the supervisory board of the corporation.\n\nBesides his position at the Bertelsmann group, Middelhoff has been a member of the Board of Trustees of the non-profit Bertelsmann Stiftung, too (2000–2002).\n\nBeginning in 2003, Middelhoff coordinated the European affairs of the holding company Investcorp. The German businesses of the corporation included and Callahan. After APCOA Parking was taken over by Investcorp in 2004, he was appointed to its supervisory board.\n\nSince 2003 Middelhoff has also been a member of the board of The New York Times Company responsible for the compensation committee. As a confidant of Madeleine Schickedanz, he became the chairman of KarstadtQuelle AG's supervisory board in June 2004 and its CEO in May 2005. KarstadtQuelle was renamed Arcandor in 2007.\n\nMiddelhoff was removed from his position as CEO of Arcandor and Thomas Cook Group in March 2009, following a significant decrease in Arcandor's share prices since he had taken the position in 2005. Three months later, German justice minister Brigitte Zypries announced an investigation into alleged fraud on Middelhoff's part, following allegations of inflated prices for lease agreements involving a firm in which he and his wife were shareholders. Arcandor declared bankruptcy in the following week. In 2014, Middelhoff was convicted on criminal charges related to his activities while head of Arcandor; he was sentenced to three years' imprisonment.\n\nMiddlehoff served 3 years in prison for Arcandor-related crimes.

Active in radio, stage, television and film, he was best known for his role in the BBC Television drama series \"Lovejoy\".\n\nDudley Sutton was born in Kingston upon Thames , and educated at a boys' boarding school at Lifton Park, Devon. He served in the Royal Air Force as a mechanic before enrolling in the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, from which he was later expelled for responding to rock-and-roll.\n\nSutton became known after unusual roles in two films directed by Sidney J. Furie. He played a frustrated teenager accused with his friends of murder in \"The Boys\" (1962) and a gay biker in \"The Leather Boys\" (1964), both parts showing his potential for offbeat screen personae. At a reunion of the three surviving stars of the earlier film in London on 17 September 2017, Sutton related that he felt himself privileged that these movies had dealt with two matters close to his heart: the iniquity of the death penalty, and gay rights. On stage, he played the title role in the first production of Joe Orton's \"Entertaining Mr Sloane\" (1964). From 25 May 1966, he appeared in \"Tango\", a play by Slawomir Mrozek at the Aldwych Theatre alongside Patience Collier, Peter Jeffrey, Mike Pratt, and Ursula Mohan under director Trevor Nunn.\n\nSutton appeared in many films during his career, including \"Rotten to the Core\" (1965), \"Crossplot\" (1969), \"The Devils\" (1971), \"Madame Sin\" (1972), \"The Pink Panther Strikes Again\" (1976), \"Fellini's Casanova\" (1976), \"Edward II\" (1991), and \"The Football Factory\" (2004).\n\nAmong his many television appearances were his roles as Tinker Dill in \"Lovejoy\" (1986 and 1991–94) – whose friendship with Lovejoy, the title character, and expertise in the antique trade was the backbone of the show – as Mr Carter in the \"Beiderbecke Trilogy\" and as Oleg Kirov in \"Smiley's People\" (1982). He also featured in \"The Sweeney\" episode \"Golden Boy\" and in a Christmas special episode of \"Porridge\" (1976) as the somewhat-unstable, prison trustee-turned-hostage-taker Reg Urwin, with Ronnie Barker and Richard Beckinsale.\n\nIn 1999, he appeared in the BBC Radio play \"Cosmos the Mystic Dog\". In 2004, he made an appearance in the soap opera \"EastEnders\" for sixteen episodes, playing Wilfred Atkins, a conman.\n\nIn 2003, Sutton found inspiration from the internet \"where apparently people say that every time you masturbate God kills a kitten\". From that statement, he developed a comic piece about \"a young man's emotions and feelings, from the moment he's a baby tugging at his cock onwards.\" In August 2003, he performed the one-man \"Killing Kittens\" show at Edinburgh's Underbelly. \n\nSutton followed up \"Killing Kittens\" with a second autobiographical show \"Pandora's Lunchbox\" in 2006. Following a performance as William Blake in Peter Ackroyd's BBC television series \"The Romantics\", Sutton joined the cast of \"Albion Rising\" at St Giles in the Fields Church, London, in April 2007. He reprised the role in the film of the same name in 2009.\n\nSutton had a small role in the British teenage drama \"Skins\" as Freddie's granddad. He also appeared in the episode of \"Holby City\" broadcast on 15 March 2011 as a patient who fell down an escalator in a shopping centre. In 2012, he featured in the video \"Once And For All\" by Clock Opera.\n\nSutton also appeared in episode three of the BBC comedy series \"Family Tree\" (\"The Austerity Games\"), which was first broadcast in July 2013, and was a guest star in episode three of the BBC series \"Boomers\" in 2014. He played William Makepeace in \"Emmerdale\" in 2014.\n\nIn 2015 he appeared as a Roman Catholic rector in the BBC TV series \"Father Brown\" episode 3.6 \"The Upcott Fraternity\". He also appeared in three episodes of the BBC's day time show, \"Doctors\", in August 2015. He narrated the 2016 documentary \"The Future of Work and Death\". In November 2017 he played the lead role in a video for the Tom Chaplin song \"Midnight Mass.\"\n\nHe married American actress Marjorie Steele in 1961; she had previously been married to the millionaire producer Huntington Hartford. Sutton and Steele had one child together, but divorced in 1965. He married a further 3 times.\n\nSutton died of cancer on 15 September 2018 at the age of 85. He is survived by three children, Peter, Barnaby and Fanny.\n\n"}

For post-1870 locomotives, see Locomotives of the Highland Railway.\n\nThe first locomotive superintendent was William Barclay, who was a nephew of Alexander Allan. The locomotives supplied initially were classic Allan designs, small 2-2-2s and 2-4-0s, outside cylindered and with external framing and (initially at least) not even a weatherboard to protect the enginemen. It was later decided that a cab was essential to protect them from winter weather. Only four of the Barclay era locomotives, all rebuilt by Jones, were still in service at the time of the Grouping in 1923.\n\nThe first locomotives were two 2-2-2s were supplied by Hawthorns and Company of Leith in 1855, and a second pair delivered in 1857. Cylinder dimensions were , and driving wheel diameters were . The boiler pressure was originally , later being revised to .\n\nThey were :\nIn around 1869, nos. 3 and 4 were scrapped, and their driving wheels were used by Stroudley to rebuild nos. 1 and 2 as 2-4-0s. No. 1 was withdrawn within a few years, but no. 2 received a more extensive rebuild, gaining a larger boiler and cylinders, and lasted until 1899.\n\nA batch of seven 2-4-0s with bore x stroke cylinders and driving wheels were supplied by Hawthorns between 1858 and 1859 for goods service. Boiler pressure was originally , later increased to .\nIn 1873 Jones rebuilt no. 10 as a 4-4-0 to counter flange wear problems on the Dingwall & Skye line. He used the Adams bogie arrangement and replaced the cylinders with new ones of bore and stroke. This engine was effectively the prototype for the F Class built from 1874 onwards. In 1875 a second locomotive (no. 7) was similarly rebuilt, although this seems to have been a trial for new features adopted for the Skye bogies. The other 5 locomotives of this batch remained as 2-4-0s but were rebuilt with cabs and longer ( stroke) cylinders between 1875 and 1880. All were withdrawn between 1893 and 1899.\n\nA pair of 2-2-2s with cylinders was supplied by Hawthorns in 1862. Driving wheels were 6 foot 0 inches, boiler pressure was originally 100 lb/square inch, later increased to 120 lb/square inch. They were the first locomotives supplied with cabs from new.\n\nNo. 13 was withdrawn in 1890. In 1871 no. 12 was rebuilt by Jones as a 2-2-2T for branch line work, in which form it survived until 1898.\n\nTwo 2-4-0s were supplied by Hawthorns in 1862. They were similar to but slightly larger than the earlier batch, and were fitted with cabs from new. They were:\n\nLater they were rebuilt with , bore x stroke, cylinders and driving wheels. No. 15 was withdrawn in 1893, while no. 14 lasted until 1901 (having been renumbered 6 and then 49).\n\nIn 1862 the Findhorn Railway was taken over, along with its sole locomotive, a Neilson and Company 0-4-0ST locomotive dating from 1860. It had wheels and cylinders. \n\nIt was sold to a contractor in 1872.\n\nA small 0-4-0T was built by Hawthorns in 1863 for the Burghead branch line. It had driving wheels and inside cylinders.\n\nAs built, it proved to be rather unstable and was therefore converted to an 0-4-2T by Stroudley. It later became a stationary engine to power the Lochgorm works sawmill. It returned to traffic as no. 1A in 1898, and was finally withdrawn in 1902.\n\nTen 2-4-0s were supplied by Sharp, Stewart and Company in 1863. They had cylinders, boilers and driving wheels.\n\nThe next year, Sharp, Stewart supplied ten more, with the stroke increased to but otherwise identical.\n\nAll were rebuilt by Jones between 1874 and 1893, gaining cylinders, and having their driving wheels increased to by means of applying thicker tyres. Withdrawals commenced in 1896, but nos. 27, 37 and 42 survived into LMS ownership.\n\nThree batches of 2-2-2s were supplied in 1863/64. They all had boilers and cylinders with a stroke. Driving wheels were .\n\nTwo were built by Hawthorns in 1863 with cylinders:\n\nSix more were built by Neilson and Company in 1863 with bore cylinders. They were all converted to bore at an unspecified later date.\n\nA further batch of ten was built by Neilson in 1864. They had inch bore cylinders.\n\nWith increased traffic, especially over the Perth line, heavier locomotives were needed, but the company was short of money. Jones responded by following Stroudley's example of rebuilding 2-2-2s as 2-4-0s. No. 29 was the first to be rebuilt in 1871, and by 1893 all except no. 32 had been so converted. Cylinder dimensions were increased to . Seven locomotives received larger boilers between 1881 and 1896, and the others were withdrawn between 1897 and 1900. The reboilered examples lasted longer, and no. 35 was still in service (latterly renumbered 35A) at the Grouping.\n\nDuring William Stroudley's tenure as locomotive superintendent from 1865–69 only one new locomotive was built. This was No. 56, an 0-6-0ST built at the Highland Railway's Lochgorm works in Inverness in 1869. This is generally considered the basis of the LB&SCR \"Terrier\" locomotives he produced later in his career. Two similar locomotives were built under Jones' in 1873 and 1874. They had wheels and cylinders. The boiler of the first is believed to have come from no. 3.\n\nThey were classified as class R in Peter Drummond's 1901 classification scheme.\n\nNo. 56 was rebuilt by Jones in 1895, and the other two were similarly rebuilt by Drummond in 1897. Alterations included thicker tyres to increase the wheel diameter to , and the provision of larger bunkers. No. 16 was later renumbered 49. All three passed to the LMS in 1923; who removed the names when applying LMS livery.\n\nAs will be apparent, the original numbering scheme was a simple chronological sequence, although Stroudley tank no. 16 was built as a replacement for the original Findhorn branch engine and received its number. In later years, new locomotives took some of the early numbers, and surviving early engines were either renumbered or given an 'A' suffix.\n\nRenaming of locomotives was common in the early years, and only the first name is recorded here. Part of the reason for multiple engines having the same name was that names were applied to locomotives used on an appropriate part of the line. If an engine was reallocated then the name was moved to another. The name \"Bruce\" was commonly used for Highland Railway locomotives (five bore it all told), and contrary to common opinion it is not in memory of King Robert the Bruce but of the Hon. C. T. Bruce who was Chairman of the company from 1885 to 1891 (and had earlier been Chairman of the Inverness and Perth Junction Railway).\n\nFeatures that arrived during the 1860s and stayed until the Peter Drummond days were the louvered chimneys and counter-pressure brake.\n\nThe chimney was really a pair of concentric ones. It is usually considered to have been adopted to aid forward visibility for the driver (a rather different pattern of smoke deflector), but there is some evidence that the real reason was to reduce the chance of lineside fires (rather like the prominent 'stacks' of early United States designs).\n\n"}

The airborne operation was personally ordered by Adolf Hitler, planned and executed by Mors, and approved by General Kurt Student.\n\nOn the night between 24 and 25 July 1943, a few weeks after the Allied invasion of Sicily and bombing of Rome, the Grand Council of Fascism voted a motion of no confidence against Mussolini. On the same day, the king replaced him with Marshal Pietro Badoglio and had him arrested.\n\nHitler's common procedure was to give similar orders to competing German military organizations. He ordered the \"Hauptsturmführer\" Otto Skorzeny to track Mussolini, and simultaneously ordered the paratroop General Kurt Student to execute the liberation.\n\nMussolini was being secluded around Tyrrhenian Sea islands by his captors – first to Ponza, then to La Maddalena, where Skorzeny's men were almost attempting an operation. Intercepting a coded Italian radio message, Skorzeny used the reconnaissance provided by the agents and informants (counterfeit notes with a face value of £100,000 forged under Operation Bernhard were used to help obtain information) of \"SS-Obersturmbannführer\" Herbert Kappler to determine that Mussolini was being imprisoned in Gran Sasso massif, a remote and defendable mountain plateau, on which was built a hotel linked with a cable car.\nOn 12 September 1943, Skorzeny and 16 SS troopers joined the \"Fallschirmjäger\" to rescue Mussolini in a high-risk glider mission. Ten DFS 230 gliders, each carrying nine soldiers and a pilot, towed by Henschel Hs 126 planes started between 13:05 and 13:10 from the Pratica di Mare Air Base near Rome.\n\nThe leader of the airborne operation, paratrooper-Oberleutnant Georg Freiherr von Berlepsch, entered the first glider, while Skorzeny and his SS troopers sat in the fourth and fifth glider. To gain height before crossing the close-by Alban Hills, the leading three glider-towing plane units flew an additional loop. All following units considered this manoeuvre unnecessary and preferred not to endanger the given time of arrival at the target. This led to the situation that Skorzeny's two units arrived first over the target.\n\nMeanwhile, the valley station of the funicular railway leading to the Campo Imperatore was captured at 14:00 in a ground attack by two paratrooper companies led by Major Harald Mors, who was commander-in-chief of the whole raid. They also cut all telephone lines. At 14:05, the airborne commandos landed their ten DFS 230 gliders on the mountain near the hotel; one crashed, causing injuries.\n\nThe \"Fallschirmjäger\" and Skorzeny's special troopers overwhelmed Mussolini's captors—200 well-equipped \"Carabinieri\" guards—without a single shot being fired; this was also due to the fact that General Fernando Soleti of the Italian African Police, who flew in with Skorzeny, told them to stand down. Skorzeny attacked the radio operator and his equipment and stormed into the hotel, followed by his SS troopers and the paratroopers. Ten minutes after the beginning of the raid, Mussolini left the hotel, accompanied by the German soldiers. At 14:45, Major Mors accessed the Hotel via the funicular railway and introduced himself to Mussolini.\n\nSubsequently, Mussolini was to be flown out by a Fieseler Fi 156 STOL plane that had arrived in the meanwhile. Although under the given circumstances the small plane was overloaded, Skorzeny insisted on accompanying Mussolini, thus endangering the success of the mission. After an extremely dangerous but successful take-off, they flew to Pratica di Mare. There they continued immediately, flying in a Heinkel He 111 to Vienna, where Mussolini stayed overnight at the Hotel Imperial. The next day he was flown to Munich and on September 14, he met Hitler at Führer Headquarters Wolf's Lair in near Rastenburg.\n\nThe operation granted a rare late-war public relations opportunity to Hermann Göring, with German propaganda hailing the operation for months afterward. The landing at Campo Imperatore was in fact led by First Lieutenant von Berlepsch, commanded by Major Mors and under orders from General Student, all \"Fallschirmjäger\" officers; but Skorzeny stewarded the Italian leader right in front of the cameras.\n\nAfter a pro-SS propaganda coup at the behest of \"Reichsführer-SS\" Heinrich Himmler and propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, Skorzeny and his special forces of the \"Waffen-SS\" were granted the majority of the credit for the operation.\nSkorzeny gained a large amount of success from this mission; he received a promotion to Sturmbannführer, the award of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and fame that led to his \"most dangerous man in Europe\" image.\n\nWinston Churchill himself described the mission as \"one of great daring\".\n\n"}

Prosperous, County Kildare, a recently founded (1780) cotton-manufacturing village, was attacked shortly after the outbreak of the 1798 rebellion at 2 a.m on 24 May 1798 by a rebel force about 60 strong which targeted the British garrison consisting of Cork militia and a detachment of a Welsh regiment, the \"\"Ancient Britons\"\".\n\nThe rebel entry into the village was preceded by the infiltration of a small vanguard who, possibly aided by female sympathizers within, scaled the walls of the militia barracks, killed the sentries and opened the gate. The barracks was quickly surrounded and attacked by hundreds of rebels who repulsed an attempt by the militia to break out, killing the militia commander, Captain Swayne. The remainder of the garrison were trapped in the upper barracks which was then torched causing the desperate soldiers to leap from windows onto the waiting pikes. About 40 of the military were slain but the next day, members of the \"Ancient Britons\" participated in the retaliatory massacre of 34 suspected United Irishmen at Dunlavin Green, County Wicklow.\n\nProsperous remained under rebel control until 19 June when retaken by troops under the command of Colonel Stewart who boasted of destroying \"this receptacle of rebellion\".\n"}

The novel won multiple awards, including the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1985, was nominated for the 1984 National Book Award, and was made into a television movie in 1993.\n\nUnmarried fifty-four-year-old Virginia Miner (Vinnie), a professor at Corinth University who specializes in children's literature, is off to London for another research trip. She loves England and likes to feel that she fits in well there. She is hoping to produce an important new book about playground rhymes. However, she finds that her work has been trashed by a critic, L. D. Zimmern of Columbia, for whom she imagines monstrous dooms.\n\nThe author makes a point of telling us that Vinnie is not beautiful — perhaps rather homely — but that she has had her share of affairs nevertheless, and a brief marriage. Although she enjoys these flings, she has stopped believing that falling or being in love is a good thing.\n\nA 'pro' at long flights, her serenity is ruffled by her seatmate, a garrulous married man from Tulsa, Chuck Mumpson. She puts him off by giving him \"Little Lord Fauntleroy\" to read. But smoking, drinking, loudly American Chuck is persistent, and ends up contacting her in London. He has been inspired by \"Little Lord Fauntleroy\" to want to trace his own family history. Vinnie slowly becomes involved with his project, and then with him.\n\nMeanwhile, her young colleague Fred Turner has left his wife, Roo, at home for his own sabbatical in London, where he is researching John Gay. Fred and Roo have quarreled and he fears the marriage is over. He consoles himself with the affections of a beautiful TV actress, Lady Rosemary Radley, who gives him the entree into London high life. The exquisite but not so young Rosemary has never managed to have a really successful love relationship—though she is not resigned to this, as Vinnie is. Although Fred is very much in love with her, he cannot give her the commitment she wants, since he must return to Corinth to teach summer school. Rosemary also has a concealed side to her personality that her friends wish to keep hidden from the public, and from journalists including contributors to \"Private Eye\", who lampoon her as \"Rosalie Raddled\". When Fred encounters this side of her, the friends close ranks and shut him out.\n\nQuite by accident and with the encouragement of Chuck, Vinnie becomes an emissary for Fred's estranged wife in an improbable midnight walk on Hampstead Heath. What makes this favor more challenging for Vinnie is that Roo's father is the nefarious critic L. D. Zimmern.\n\nJust as she begins to think Chuck's affections have cooled, because of his silence of several days duration, Vinnie is visited by his daughter who describes his sudden death while climbing the stairs of a small town hall. When an English friend speaks condescendingly of Chuck, Vinnie realizes with surprise that he loved her and she loved him. She returns to her life in Corinth, solitary and unloved, but altered for having loved and been loved.\n\n\nThe novel won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1985, and was made into a made-for-TV movie. \"Foreign Affairs\" was also nominated for the 1984 National Book Award for fiction and the 1984 National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction.\n\nIn 1993, \"Foreign Affairs\" was made into a TV movie written by Chris Bryant.\n\n"}

The centre of their homeland is in the Great Victoria Desert, at Tjuntjunjarra, some east of Kalgoorlie, perhaps the remotest community in Australia. The Pila Nguru were the last Australian people to have dropped the complete trappings of their traditional lifestyle.\n\nThey maintain in large part their traditional hunter-gatherer lifestyle within the territory, over which their claims to Native title and associated collective rights were recognised by a 28 November 2000 Federal Court decision. In 1997, an art project was started in which indigenous paintings became part of the title claim. In 2005, a major exhibit of their works in London brought the artists widespread attention.\n\nSpinifex people speak south western dialects of the Wati language division of the Pama–Nyungan languages. The name \"Pila Nguru\" is an abbreviation of \"Anaṉgu tjuta pila nguru\" (\"people-land-spinifex-from\", or people from the land of the spinifex) and reflects an identity rooted in a sense of tenure of territory rather than a strictly linguistic classification.\n\nThe contemporary centre is found on the southern edge of the Spinifex homelands. The arid desert which forms the environment where the Pila Nguru live has tree varieties like mulga, western myall and casuarina as well as varieties of cassia, sandalwood and spinifex. Spinifex grasses (porcupine/hummock grasses) dominated communities over 22% of the traditional Australian landmass, and the arid desert areas contain some 35 species. The variety called \"soft spinifex\" or, in pidgin English bush araldite is \"Triodia pungens\", prized for its cementing qualities. The general term in Western desert languages for the plant is \"tjanpi\", the plain where it grows is \"pila\", the plant itself, in the Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara languages was \"tjapura\", while the Spinifex resin extracted from it is called \"kiti\".\n\nSpinifex grasses were worked to produce cakes of resin that had four basic uses: (a) as a waterproofer, by caulking any wooden object employed for carry around water; (b) as a putty to fill holes or fissures in work materials; (c) as an adhesive to bind materials when making tools, weaponry and ceremonial objects; and (d) as a basic stuff for moulding beads, figurines and other assorted objects. These resin products are commodities also, used as gifts and as important tradewares between tribes.\n\nThe grasses were cut with stone halfway down the stem. The gathered grass was flailed with a stick to obtain spinifex dust, which then was winnowed and \"yandied\", \"yandi\" referring to a \"luandja\", a softwood winnowing dish for grass seed: the cleaned seeds were then tipped into another type of dish, called \"ivirra\", worked further with a particular rocking movement and shaking and then heated over stone to yield around 8 cubic metres yielding 600 grams.\n\nThe resin, thus extracted from varieties of triodia was a key ingredient for binding the stone blades to native hafted adzes, which were of two types, tula and burren, the former, the type used by spinifex people, using the distal edge, the other the lateral edge, for working materials. The materials for the tula adze were obtained by knapping tula flakes to form \"slugs\" or blades, the tool being then employed for woodwork, to hollow out yandis or fashion boomerangs and spears.\n\nThe only artificial dwelling was a \"wiltja\" or windbreak.\n\nIn evaluating the Pila Nguru claim to native title in 2001, the Federal Court of Australia's Chief Justice Michael Black stated that archaeological evidence indicated a nomadic presence in the Western desert dating back some 20,000 years. There was rapid demographic expansion over most of Australia during the Holocene climatic optimum (9,000-6,000, extending through much of the arid zones. According to Scott Cane the residual debris of artifact use peppering the desert landscape is extremely dense, attesting to a very long period of habitation.\n\nWhite incursions into the Pila Nguru homelands started around the 1910s, with the granting of options on pastoral leases, which however failed to be realized. By the 1930s, profiting from the proximity of the Trans-Australian Railway (T.A.R), which had been completed just over a decade earlier, missionaries strove to undertake evangelistic pastoral work in the area, establishing a mission in Warburton but the extremities of trying to live there rendered their activities difficult, and the native lifestyle managed to survive, with the retention of many customary ways. In times of drought during the 1920s down to 1942, itinerant Anangu sought out provisions from the Karonie T.A.R on the Cowarna Downs, where the government had established a rations depot, with food distributed on a monthly basis. It was gradually overtaken by the depot at Cundeelee from 1939, which was closed in 1942. Two other depots distributing rations to those in need existed: one at Zanthus T.A.R, the other halfway between Cundeelee and .\n\nBy the 1950s, so little was known about these people that the British chose the Nullarbor for nuclear weapons testing, as they believed it to be devoid of people.\n\nWhen graded roads were built for the Giles Weather Station (part of the Weapons Research Establishment) during 1952–1955, officials learned that indigenous people - probably then around 150 - lived west of the sites. Scouting just east of this area to find suitable locations for radiation sensors that would measure the fallout, Len Beadell records stumbling on an \"Aboriginal Stonehenge\", a geometrical pattern of upturned shale slabs extending for a distance of 60 metres. An officer, the expert bushman Walter MacDougall was sent to warn them of the impending tests. A total of nine small hydrogen bombs ranging up to 25 kilotons were tested at Emu Junction (2 tests, 1953) and Maralinga (7 tests, 1956–1957). Given that only one officer and an assistant were assigned to warn the Spinifex people who lived across an enormous area far to the west of the test sites, many of the Spinifex were never informed, nor did they leave the area. Officially, all were forced to leave their lands and were not allowed within 200 km of ground zero. Officials made a leaflet drop, but the Spinifex could not read the leaflets and were wary and afraid of the aircraft.\n\nIn the later stages of the bomb trials, MacDougall discovered that up to 40 Spinifex people may have been hunting over the eastern portion of the prohibited Maralinga area while the tests were being conducted, moving as far east as Vokes Hill and Waldana. One family of twelve were the nearest people, living at \"Nurrari Lakes\" less than 200 km west from Maralinga. Although close enough to hear the larger bombs explode, they were healthy several years after the tests.\n\nThe Australian Royal Commission was unable to determine if Maralinga Tjarutja or Pila Nguru people had been exposed to damaging levels of radiation from fallout, due to the lack of medical records and medical centres. Maralinga bomb plume maps show prevailing northerly winds during tests, whereas the Spinifex lands are 300 km to the west of Maralinga. The closest group was at Nurrari Lakes about 180 km west. Scott Cane's otherwise definitive native title study, \"Pila Nguru\" (2000), contained almost no details as to how bomb testing radiation affected the Spinifex people.\n\nIn 1997 the Spinifex Arts Project was begun to help document the Native Title claims. Both Native Title paintings, the Men's Combined and the Women's Combined, document the entire Spinifex area; they show the claimants' birthplaces and express the important traditional stories that cross and give shape to the area.\n\nThe Spinifex people were the second tribe in Western Australia to receive recognition of their Native Title land rights in 2000,\nin accordance with Section 87 (agreement) of the Commonwealth Native Title Act 1993. The ruling, by the Federal Court of Australia, in a case brought by a third party on behalf of the Spinifex People, found that agreement had been reached between the applicants and the two named respondents: the State Government of Western Australia and the Shire of Laverton, over a sector of land encompassing around 55,000 km.\n\nThis territory - which was designated as either unallocated land or park reserve, and contained no pastoral leases - lies to the north of the lands of the Nullarbor peoples, to the east of the people in the Pilki area and to the south of the Ngaanyatjarra Lands, the eastern boundary being formed by the South Australian border. Apart from the area of two Nature Reserves, the only specific \"other interests\" identified within the territory was for public right-of-way along an existing road which traversed some of the territory.\n\nThe Native Title claim was made by twenty-one families constituting the current Spinifex people. Some People of the Spinifex had begun returning to their land from around 1980. From 2001 many of those who left to live at the Christian missions have since returned to their homelands and the Unnamed Conservation Park Biosphere Reserve (now Mamungari Conservation Park). In 2004 the government turned over the pristine wilderness area of 21,000 sq/km jointly to the Pila Nguru and the Maralinga Tjarutja.\n\nSpinifex art began as what Philip Batty called \"intercultural debris\", reflecting their experience of the impact of the outside world. The genre of what the Pila Nguru call \"government paintings\" were visual documents created to furnish evidence of their land title, to be produced in court.\n\nA theatrical performance, \"Career Highlights of the Mamu\", covering the tribal experience during the period of the atomic tests was performed by Roy Underwood and several other Spinifex people in Hamburg in 2002.\n\nIn early 2005, the Spinifex people became famous for their solo and group artworks, due to the effect of a major art exhibition of their work in London. Their boldly-coloured \"dot paintings\" are not the usual polished commodities produced by many northern tribes for sale to a non-Aboriginal art market, but are authentic works that the Spinifex People have made for their own purposes.\n\n\n"}

Responding to accidents or dangerous rescues in an \"emergency room on wheels\" with directions via biophone from medical personnel back at the hospital, the paramedics performed Advanced Life Support (ALS) techniques to stabilize injured, ill, and dying patients before transporting them to a medical facility.\n\nTo train for their parts, the actors, Randolph Mantooth along with Kevin Tighe, \"...sat in on paramedic classes\" (although they never took any written exams) \"and rode out on extensive ride-a-longs with LACoFD\". In an interview with Tom Blixa of WTVN, Mantooth said that the producer wanted them to train so that they would at least know the fundamentals and look like they knew what they were doing on camera. Mantooth mentioned that unless you take the written course you are not a paramedic and that \"if anyone has a heart attack, I'll call 911 with the best of them\". According to authors Richard Yokley and Roxane Sutherland who wrote the book, \"Emergency! Behind the Scenes\", the show \"Emergency!\" is an important chapter in television history.\n\nAt the time of the series' world premiere in 1972, there were only 12 paramedical units in North America located in four municipalities. Ten years later, more than half of all Americans were within ten minutes of a paramedic rescue or ambulance unit, due to the influence of the show. The program introduced audiences from all over the world to the concept of pre-hospital care, along with fire prevention and CPR.\n\nThe show ran six seasons (129 episodes) with seven two-hour television movie specials including the pilot film (\"The Wedsworth-Townsend Act\"). with a national audience that averaged 30 million viewers each week. Mantooth directed two episodes of \"Emergency!\"; \"The Nuisance\" (1976) and \"Insanity Epidemic\" (1977), and also directed the television movie \"Greatest Rescues of Emergency\" (1978). Mantooth and Tighe did many of their own stunts in the early years with the rule of thumb, \"if you could see our faces, it was us doing the stunts; if you couldn't, it was our stunt doubles.\" He was offered an opportunity after Emergency! went off the air to be an actual firefighter, but decided to continue with acting.\n\nNearly 30 years after \"Emergency!\" debuted, the Smithsonian Institution accepted \"Emergency!\" memorabilia into its American History Museum in the public service division and not entertainment on May 16, 2000. Items inducted at the Smithsonian included their uniforms, scripts, helmets, turnouts, biophone, and defibrillator.\n\nIn conjunction to the induction of the equipment from \"Emergency!\" at the Smithsonian, Project 51 was created in an effort to raise funds for a children's burn charity, and exhibit the restored squad around the country. Mantooth, along with Marco Lopez, Tim Donnelly, Ron Pinkard and Mike Stoker embarked on a 10-city tour with the squad to raise funds for charity on their way to Washington, D.C. with their final destination being the Smithsonian. Project 51 folded after the equipment was inducted into the Smithsonian and the funds were distributed to burn centers, fire education projects, and museums.\n\nIn 2012, Mantooth and Tighe were presented with the traditional white leather cairns helmets by the Los Angeles County Fire Department as Honorary Fire Chiefs of the department. The honor was bestowed on the men for their contributions to the fire service and emergency medicine through educating and inspiring kids and adults to be firefighters, EMTs, or paramedics. The series contributed to the revolution in emergency medicine and mobile health across the country.\n\nThe series was placed into syndication in 1977 as \"Emergency! One\" to some local stations in the late 1970s. It was called \"Emergency! One\" because the show was still filming new episodes in the United States. After the show ended, the name reverted to \"Emergency!\" The show was sold overseas and aired in a number of countries, including Germany where it was renamed \"Notruf California\", in addition to being dubbed in Spanish in the United States.\n\nIn the late 1990s and 2000s, \"Emergency!\" began airing on cable and digital sub-channels networks that included TV Land, RTV, MeTV, and Cozi TV. \"Emergency!\" spun off an animated version called \"Emergency +4\" aired on NBC Saturday mornings from 1973 to 1976, with Mantooth and Kevin Tighe voicing the animated characters of John Gage and Roy DeSoto. \"Starship Rescue\" aired in 1973 to promote NBC's fall lineup of Saturday morning programs focusing on \"Emergency!\" and \"\" and it was hosted by Mantooth and Tighe. Tighe and Mantooth also presented the work of firefighters and paramedics from the Los Angeles County Fire Department on the NBC Saturday morning children's series \"Go!\".\n\nMantooth's and Tighe's likeness were used for games, puzzles, lunch boxes, action figures and comic books connected to the series. The comic books for Emergency focused on the primary actors from Rampart Hospital, along with Johnny and Roy. The four comic books, and four magazines, were issued by Charlton Comics in 1976. Some of the issues were drawn by John Byrne and Neal Adams. \"Emergency! +4\" and \"Emergency!\" both had coloring books that were created to promote the series to young viewers using the likenesses of the five principal characters. Viewmaster released a series of reels that had film stills of the show arranged in a story or photo montage.\n\nMantooth and Kevin Tighe's characters John Gage and Roy DeSoto appeared on another Robert A. Cinader created series, \"Sierra\". The series focused on National Park Service Rangers stationed in the Sierras. Mantooth and Tighe appeared in the episode, \"Urban Rangers\". Mantooth's character appeared on a crossover episode of \"Adam-12\" called \"Lost and Found\".\n\nThe on-screen camaraderie between Mantooth and Tighe, as well as their friendship with both London and Troup, carried over to real life as well. Before London's and Troup's deaths, all four remained close friends after the series came to a close, and Tighe served as a best man at Mantooth's second wedding in 2002.\n\nWhile talking with Tom Blixa of WTVN, Mantooth said that at first it was a little intimidating working with Robert Fuller, Bobby Troup and Julie London, because they were all big stars but after doing a series with them for seven years they all became like family. In the same interview while discussing happenings behind the scenes and blooper reels, Mantooth said there was \"a lot of salty language though\"...\"and we learned every bad word from Julie London\"...”I love her to death but she herself said 'I'm a broad'\". In a 2013 interview with the Tolucan Times, Mantooth said of his decades-long colleague, \"Julie London was a mentor to all of us. She let the words work for her, rather than emoting; that’s all anybody needed.\"\n\nIn addition to Mantooth working as an actor for over forty years, he has remained an advocate of firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, and other emergency medical providers. He does speeches and personal appearances each year at events across the country, discussing the \"inside story of the development of the television series \"Emergency!\" and its impact on the EMS system development\". Having worked closely with the nation's first certified firefighter/paramedics, who served as technical advisors on the set of \"Emergency!\". Mantooth brings a perspective and insight into the startup and history of pre-hospital treatment in the field. He worked alongside influential men who made a difference ... men he greatly admired ... the late Robert A. Cinader, creator and executive producer of \"Emergency!\", and the man known as the Father of Modern Emergency Medical Services, close friend and mentor, the late James O. Page. According to A.J. Heightman, Editor-in-Chief, Journal of Emergency Medical Services (JEMS), \"Randy Mantooth is one of the strongest reminders of how America turned the dedicated delivery of basic emergency care into a systematic approach to EMS and Advanced Life Support\".\n\nMantooth's dedication to promoting and advocating for the fire service and EMS is shown through personal reasons, \"I owe an incredible debt to firefighters, EMTs, and paramedics... so that's a debt that no one can really pay back, but you can try. That's why it's so important for me to do what I do.\" Mantooth references his own life being saved from carbon monoxide poisoning at home during the run of \"Emergency!\", in addition to paramedics and a flight nurse saving his sister's life after she was involved in a car accident.\n\nHe serves as spokesperson for the International Association of Firefighters (IAFF) on Health and Safety. He has been honored over the years with numerous awards and recognition, most recently the James O. Page Award of Excellence from the International Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC), EMS section. He is a lifetime member of the National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians (NAEMT) and a lifetime member of the Washington D.C.-based Advocates for EMS. He \"accepts the accolades with gracious deference to those he considers our true heroes\". Mantooth serves as honorary chairman and spokesperson for the non-profit County of Los Angeles Fire Museum Association.\n\nMantooth's work as an advocate for firefighters and EMT also extended to the Native peoples. In May 2012, he filmed an Emergency Preparedness video to be distributed to tribal leaders with Monte Fronk in Minnesota at the Mille Lacs Ojibwe Reservation. The project was funded through a public health education grant through the University of Minnesota. Mantooth served as moderator recently in a project done in conjunction with the Los Angeles County Fire Museum, \"Pioneers of Paramedicine\", and is an effort to document and record the history of the paramedicine program. Originally filmed in 2001, with additional scenes filmed in 2013, this features discussions with four doctors: Eugene Nagel, M.D. from Miami; Leonard Cobb, M.D., Seattle; J. Michael Criley, M.D., Los Angeles; and Walter Graf, M.D., in Los Angeles. These doctors pioneered the idea of mobile medicine and paramedics based on early ideas in Northern Ireland and Russia.\n\nMantooth appeared in the miniseries adaptations of Taylor Caldwell's 1968 novel \"Testimony of Two Men\" (1977) and John Jakes' novel \"The Seekers\" (1979–80). The adaptation of \"The Seekers\" featured Mantooth in the starring role as Abraham Kent.\n\nThrough the 1980s, Mantooth made guest-star appearances on a number of televisions series including \"Charlie's Angels\", \"Fantasy Island\", three appearances on \"The Fall Guy\", \"Dallas\", \"Murder, She Wrote\" and \"L.A. Law\".\n\nHe moved back to New York where he explored a new direction in his career with daytime soap operas, earning him four Soap Opera Digest Award nominations. He played Clay Alden on \"Loving\" from 1987–1990. It was during this time, that the character, Clay Alden, was actually Alex Masters. Mantooth described the character as a \"good guy with an edge.\"\n\nMantooth left \"Loving\" for personal reasons in 1990, before returning to the show in 1993, this time in the role of Alex Masters. The series was later revamped and titled \"The City\", lasting for two more years before folding in 1997. His character, Alex Masters, did several crossover episodes on \"One Life to Live\" in 1997.\n\nHe appeared on \"General Hospital\", \"One Life to Live\" and \"As the World Turns\", where he played both good guys and villains. In 2003, Mantooth joined the cast of \"As the World Turns\" as a temporary replacement for Benjamin Hendrickson in the role of Hal Munson. When Hendrickson left the series in 2004, Mantooth returned to the series as Munson, in a recurring position until Hendrickson returned to the program in 2005. In 2007, Mantooth landed the recurring role of Kirk Harmon on \"One Life to Live\".\n\nBesides his work on daytime in the 1990s, Mantooth starred in television movies such as \"White Cobra Express\" and portrayed Bing Tupper in both the movie \"Before the Storm\" and the series \"Under Cover\".

{"id": "1895358", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1895358", "title": "Alan Wake", "text": "Alan Wake\n\nAlan Wake is an action-adventure survival horror video game developed by Remedy Entertainment and published by Microsoft Studios, released for the Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows. The story follows best-selling thriller novelist Alan Wake as he tries to uncover the mystery behind his wife's disappearance during a vacation in the small fictional town of Bright Falls, Washington, all while experiencing events from the plot in his latest novel, which he cannot remember writing, coming to life.\n\nIn its pacing and structure, \"Alan Wake\" is similar to a thriller television series, with episodes that contain plot twists and cliffhangers. The game itself consists of six episodes, and the storyline is continued by two special episodes, titled \"The Signal\" and \"The Writer\", that were made available as downloadable content (DLC) within the same year of the game's release. Together, they make the first season of a possibly longer story. Additionally, a six-episode live-action web series called \"Bright Falls\" acts as a prequel to the game, and a number of related books also expand upon the \"Alan Wake\" story.\n\nChiefly written by Sam Lake, \"Alan Wake\" took over five years to create—an unusually long development time in the game industry. The game was originally developed as an open-world survival game as an anti-thesis to Remedy's prior linear \"Max Payne\" games, but struggled over three years in merging the gameplay with the action-thriller story they wanted to tell. After an intense two-month period, the team reworked the game to be a more traditional linear game broken into an episodic approach but which better supported the planned narrative structure and capable of reusing much of the open world assets already built. The game received positive reviews from critics, and is often praised for its visuals, sound, narrative, pacing, and atmosphere. \"Alan Wake\" was awarded the first spot in \"Time\" magazine's list of the top 10 video games of 2010. \"Alan Wake's American Nightmare\", a full stand-alone title, was released in February 2012 on the Xbox Live Arcade service. A sequel was in development but was cancelled. However, the scrapped sequel became the foundation and inspiration of Remedy's next title, \"Quantum Break\".\n\n\"Alan Wake\" is described by Remedy as \"the mind of a psychological thriller\" and \"the body of a cinematic action game\" put together. In interviews, the game's creators hold that the game does not belong squarely in the survival horror video game genre. The game is primarily set in the fictional idyllic small town of Bright Falls, Washington. The main gameplay happens in various areas of Bright Falls – such as the forest, a national park, or a farm – during the night time; these are punctuated by calmer, non-combative sequences set during the day.\n\nThe player controls the eponymous protagonist Alan Wake. In the game, a \"darkness\" is taking over humans, animals and objects. These enemies, dubbed the \"Taken\", are murderous shadows that attack Wake, wielding weapons of their own, ranging from mallets and knives to shovels and chainsaws. They vary by speed, size, and the amount of damage they can take, and some can teleport between short distances. Besides the Taken, the player must combat flocks of possessed ravens and animated objects. When enemies are close, Alan can perform a slow-motion cinematic dodge maneuver.\n\nThe Taken are protected by a shield of darkness, initially rendering them impervious to attack; they can only be injured with a firearm after exposure to light, which burns the darkness away. This puts significant emphasis on flashlights in conjunction with conventional weapons, such as a revolver or shotgun. Flashlight beams act as a reticle. The handheld lights Wake can carry can be boosted, which destroys the darkness faster, but also reduces the light's battery level. Besides the conventional shooter gameplay need for reloading ammunition, the player must also insert fresh batteries into the flashlight when they run out, or wait for it to recharge slowly. The strength of the darkness protecting an enemy can vary among the Taken. The amount of darkness remaining is represented by a corona of light that appears when aiming at an enemy, and a stronger darkness may recharge over time. When a Taken is finally destroyed, it disappears.\n\nThe player is often encouraged to take advantage of environmental light sources and placing, and to use other light-based weapons and accessories, such as flare guns, hand-held flares and flashbangs. Wake can use searchlights to take out massive waves of Taken. Streetlights and other light stands can provide a safe haven, which the Taken cannot enter, and will regenerate the character's health faster. Otherwise, health regenerates slowly with time, when not taking any damage. In certain sections of the game, it is possible to use a car to traverse between locations in Bright Falls. When in a car, the player can run down Taken on the road, or boost the vehicle's headlights to destroy them.\n\nA major element of gameplay is the optional discovery and collection of manuscript pages from Alan Wake's latest novel—\"Departure\". Although Wake does not remember writing this book, its storyline seems to be becoming real around him. These readable manuscript pages are scattered around the game world, out of chronological order; they often describe scenes that have yet to occur and act as warning and instructions for proceeding through upcoming challenges. Other optional collectibles include coffee thermos flasks scattered around the game world (100 in all), as well as discovering television sets which show different episodes of the fictional \"Night Springs\" series, radios airing talk and music from Bright Falls' local radio station, and textual signs around the town. The radio shows and signs provide a deeper understanding of the town's history and culture. The game's downloadable content episodes introduce other collectibles such as alarm clocks.\n\nAlan Wake (voiced by Matthew Porretta) is a bestselling crime fiction author suffering from a two-year stretch of writer's block. He and his wife Alice travel to the small mountain town of Bright Falls, Washington for a short vacation on the advice of Alice and Alan's friend and agent Barry Wheeler. Before their arrival, Alan has a nightmare about shadowy figures who try to kill him, before an ethereal figure interrupts the dream and teaches him how to use light to fight the shadows.\n\nUpon arrival in Bright Falls, Alan goes to retrieve the keys and map to their rented cabin from Carl Stucky, the cabin's landlord, but encounters a mysterious old woman, who tells him that Stucky had fallen ill and she was entrusted to give Alan the keys. The woman directs Alan and Alice to a cabin on an island in the middle of Cauldron Lake, a volcanic crater lake. As they unpack, Alan finds that Alice arranged the trip to help break his writer's block, arranging for him to see a Bright Falls psychologist named Dr. Emil Hartman, and leaving a typewriter in the cabin for him. Alan is infuriated and storms out of the cabin, but rushes back when he hears Alice crying for help. Alan returns to the cabin just as Alice is being dragged into the lake's waters by a mysterious force. Alan dives into the water after her, blacking out as he submerges.\n\nAlan regains consciousness a week later, apparently having driven his car off the road, but with no memory of how he got there. He attempts to reach a nearby gas station, but his progress is hampered by murderous, shadowy figures resembling those in his dream. While fighting the shadows with light, Alan repeatedly encounters an ethereal figure in a diving suit similar to the one from his dream, which leaves behind pages of a manuscript entitled \"Departure\", ostensibly written by Alan, which he has no memory of writing. Alan soon discovers that the events of the manuscript are coming true, and that the shadowy figures, or \"Taken,\" are townsfolk possessed by a dark force. After killing a possessed Carl Stucky and reaching the gas station, Alan tries to alert Sheriff Sarah Breaker of his wife's disappearance, but Sarah states that there has been no island or cabin in Cauldron Lake for years after it sunk following a volcanic eruption years prior. Alan is taken to the police station, and Barry arrives in Bright Falls in search of him.\n\nAlan receives a call from a man purporting to be Alice's kidnapper, demanding the pages of \"Departure\" in exchange for her. Meeting at a nearby national park, Alan witnesses the kidnapper at the mercy of the mysterious old woman, confessing that he never actually had Alice. Alan and the kidnapper are then attacked by a dark tornado, which hurls Alan into Cauldron Lake. He awakens in the lodge overlooking Cauldron Lake under the care of Hartman, who claims that Alan is suffering a psychotic break, with the supernatural phenomena being fabrications of his imagination. Alan attempts to escape the lodge as the shadowy force starts to attack it, learning in the process that the fake kidnapper was employed by Hartman to lure Alan to him. Hartman tries to stop Alan from escaping, and gives the impression that he is aware of the supernatural events surrounding the lake. Barry helps Alan to escape the lodge before the shadow subsumes it and all those inside.\n\nAlan and Barry gradually begin to learn the truth about Cauldron Lake from the other townsfolk. An entity known as the Dark Presence (taking the form of the old woman, Barbara Jagger) is trapped within the lake, attempting to escape by using the lake's power to turn fiction into reality. It had previously tried this with a poet named Thomas Zane — the figure in the diving suit — but Zane was able to resist its will and used his writings to cause the volcanic eruption that sank the island, stranding himself within the lake. The Dark Presence has grown strong enough to start to influence the townspeople and create the forces that have pursued Alan. That night, as Alan and Barry take shelter, they get drunk on moonshine, and Alan starts to recall memories of being forced to write \"Departure\" during the prior week, realizing that the Dark Presence is now trying to use his writings to escape, and is holding Alice within the lake in order to coerce him.\n\nAlan and Barry are arrested by an FBI agent, but the Taken assault the police station and drag the agent away. Sarah, now convinced of the Dark Presence's existence, helps Alan and Barry reach Cynthia Weaver, a hermit who knew Thomas Zane and prepared countermeasures for the Dark Presence's return. She leads them to the \"Well-Lit Room,\" containing a light switch known as the Clicker, which, through the power of Alan's writings, possesses the narrative ability to destroy the Dark Presence. Alan returns to Cauldron Lake alone and dives in, finding himself in a surreal alternate dimension known as the Dark Place, where thoughts and ideas become reality. Alan encounters Jagger and destroys her with the Clicker; realizing he must maintain balance in the story, Alan completes \"Departure\" by freeing Alice, but strands himself in the Dark Place in the process. Finishing \"Departure,\" Alan writes the final line - \"It's not a lake, it's an ocean.\" \n\nContinuing from the end of the main game, Alan finds himself in a surreal version of Bright Falls and realizes he is still trapped in the Dark Place. Zane directs Alan to follow a signal through a cell phone in order to \"focus\" and guide himself through the Dark Place. While navigating the realm's shifting, dreamlike topography, Alan encounters television screens depicting a more maniacal version of himself, who uses the power of the Dark Place to narrate circumstances that plunge Alan into danger, sending hordes of Taken after him. Alan also encounters an ethereal version of Barry, a figment of his subconsciousness, who helps guide Alan safely across the abstract landscape.\n\nZane eventually reveals that Alan himself is the cause of his current circumstance; the maniacal version of Alan on the television screens is an irrational aspect of Alan consumed by fear, his frenzied thoughts affecting the subjective world of the Dark Place. Alan encounters a monstrous conglomeration of televisions, through which the irrational Alan tries to kill him. Alan defeats the televisions, but wakes up back in the cabin again, and realizes he is still trapped. \n\nStill trapped in the Dark Place, Alan regains consciousness and accepts that he is the cause of the insanity he is experiencing, regaining his memories in the process. Zane tells him that the \"irrational Alan\" is still inside the cabin, controlling the Dark Place; the \"rational Alan\" must regain control in order to have any chance of escaping the Dark Place. Zane directs Alan to a lighthouse across the increasingly surreal landscape of the Dark Place, while the irrational Alan attempts to stop him by creating delusions of Alice, manipulating the landscape, and sending armies of Taken after him. Alan eventually outwits his other self and reaches the lighthouse, passing through it to reach the cabin.\n\nAs Alan nears the cabin, the imaginary Barry reappears and tells Alan that he will have to reject all the illusions before he can face off against the insane version of Alan, including the apparition of Barry. Alan is forced to confront Taken versions of Barry and the other townsfolk, defeating them all and reentering the cabin. The irrational Alan is in a paranoid state on the cabin floor; when Alan touches him, the two are made whole again. Alan realizes that he cannot let himself fall into a delusional state again for fear of never being able to escape, and returns to the typewriter to start a new story—\"\"Return\"\".\n\nBy 2003, the Finnish studio Remedy Entertainment had created the critically acclaimed \"Max Payne\" (2001), and its sequel, \"\" (2003). After shipping \"Max Payne 2\", Remedy Entertainment spent some time \"recovering from the crunch\", and started coming up with different concepts for a new project. Among these was the concept for \"Alan Wake\". Early on, this was based on trying to tell a deeper narrative story than what \"Max Payne\" had been, influenced by works of Stephen King and David Lynch, in particular \"Twin Peaks\", and approached as a television episodic format to tell the story of the action-thriller. The basic elements of the narrative were set early on: Alan Wake as a successful writer finds himself in the small town of Bright Falls where due to supernatural events his writings have come to life to attack him.\n\nTo further distance this next game from the linear style of \"Max Payne\", Remedy planned Bright Falls as a free-roaming, sandbox-style open world city, similar to those seen in the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series. They developed a semi-automatic system to help generate this open world using biomes and other features based on their research on the Pacific Northwest where Bright Falls was set. For example, this tool allowed them to path a road across the game world, upon which the tool would make sure no vegetation would appear near the road though added sprout of grass near its edges, and would add approach ditches and other features along the sides of the roads to simplify the world creation. Remedy also wanted cinematic action, so light and darkness was to play a significant factor in the game, which was first built into a dynamic day-and-night cycle. The game would have been more like a survival game; during daylight hours the player would collect resources, such as gasoline to run portable generators to run lights, as to protect and defend the player-character at night. According to Remedy's creative director Sam Lake, this approach created numerous difficulties in establishing a story and narrative for the thriller to explain how the gameplay elements tied together with the supernatural events. For example, Lake said one idea was based on the supernatural events tied to the no-longer dormant volcano under Cauldron Lake, which would have led to the evacuation of Bright Falls and left Alan dealing only with the supernatural forces.\n\nThe game, still designed around this open-world approach, was announced at E3 2005 in June for \"the next generation of consoles and PCs\", and was shown to the press behind closed doors in the form of a tech demo. Remedy also used this demo to gain publisher interest. By 2006, Remedy announced they had partnered with Microsoft Game Studios to publish the game exclusively for Microsoft's Xbox 360 video game console and then-current Windows Vista PC operating system. \n\nRemedy still continued to struggle with merging the open-world survival gameplay and story, now further complicated with Microsoft's involvement and suggestions for improvement, which Lake compared to a \"too many cooks\" situation. They were now missing various publisher milestones as they tried various changes to the open-world format with no clear resolution. Roughly three years into development, the team recognized they needed to stop and refocus on what the core elements of the gameplay was to be. According to Lake, Remedy took the leads from each department to form a \"sauna\" group, making them work in a room together to lock down the gameplay that \"Alan Wake\" should have without losing much of work they had already done, \"with all the heat and pressure on us\". This took about two months but from it came the revised gameplay loop, which they were able to reapply to the existing open-world setting they had, breaking it apart into linear chapter-sized levels for the final game and adding some additional assets as needed. This allowed some levels to be used for daytime that would be used to advance the story, letting the player talk to NPCs and explore the area, and others for the night levels that were predominately action-based, and even with some levels having both daytime and nighttime versions. This change better supported the thriller narrative as well. Other key gameplay ideas that came out from this period were the ideas for the Taken and how the player would fight them, how these enemies would appear and the in-game signals the player would see and hear to prepare, and the use of lit safe havens between combat. Lake stated that because they kept as much of the previous open-world elements they already built in this rework, this helped to give \"a sense of realness\" to the game world. Oskari Häkkinen, the head of franchise development at Remedy during \"Alan Wake\"s development, said that retaining the open world map, with features planned and rendered in the distance, gave them a means to provide landmarks to give a sense of direction to the player, gave the ability to create foreshadowing in the narrative, and generally helped with overall cohesion of the game world.\n\nThe first screenshots depicted the character of Alan Wake in much different attire, as well as a different layout for the town of Bright Falls, compared to the released game.\n\nAccording to Lake, the character of Alan Wake was also intended to be the opposite of Max Payne. While Max was a cop and thus suited to an action game, Remedy wanted Alan to be atypical of an action hero, making him a writer, partially influenced by King, that became involved in the events and forced into action. Near the end of the game's development, Alan's story started to become a metaphor for Remedy's work on the game itself, according to Lake: Alan's past work as a novelist was based on a fictional police detective (mirroring Remedy's \"Max Payne\"), but now struggled with writing something different (representing their troubles in finding the vision for \"Alan Wake\"). \n\nThe game's enemies were designed by drawing concept art and then pouring water over them to make them feel \"Just a bit off\". For the character of Alan Wake himself, Remedy used \"concept photos\" as opposed to more traditional concept artwork. All the characters featured in \"Alan Wake\" were based on real life models. Ilkka Villi and Jonna Järvenpää, the models for Alan and Alice Wake, respectively, are the only Finnish models in the game; all other models were American. Voice overs were provided by native actors from Japan and America for their respective regions. \n\nAfter four years of having repeatedly demonstrated the Microsoft Windows version, in 2009, Remedy confirmed that at that point the game was being developed exclusively for the Xbox 360 and the decision to make a PC version was in Microsoft's hands. The game was announced as \"done\" and undergoing final polishing in August 2009. The game eventually went gold on 7 April 2010, and was released in May.\n\nAfter the game's release in 2010, Remedy said that bringing the game to the PC was \"not on the cards at the moment.\" However, nearly two years after its release, Remedy was able to secure the rights to publish a PC version.\n\n\"Alan Wake\" was influenced by and often alludes to certain films, TV shows, and books, as well as paying homage to a number of artists and works. Remedy has explained the shared themes and ideas between the game and other existing works of popular culture as \"taking something familiar to people as an element, and building something of your own, and hopefully something [that is] unique in games, but still familiar from other forms of entertainment.\"\n\nBestselling author Stephen King was a major inspiration for \"Alan Wake\". The main character as a writer whose work is coming true is a theme that has been explored by King in a number of his works. Wake's narration directly alludes to King on several occasions, including the game's opening line, in which he quotes a Stephen King essay. The game also pays homage to the film \"The Shining\" (based on King's novel of the same name) with a hedge maze area similar to the iconic maze in the film, among other references, as well as King's novel \"Christine\", with one of the in-game cars resembling her. King himself was asked for permission to use his quote. He also received copies of the game as a \"thank you\", but was unable to try them out because he does not own an Xbox. In addition to King's work, Lake has cited the stories of Bret Easton Ellis and Neil Gaiman as influences, as well as Mark Z. Danielewski's \"House of Leaves\".\n\nIn the game there are a number of television sets that can be found around the town in different places. They can be switched on and a short episode of the fictional series \"Night Springs\" will be played, which is influenced by the television series \"The Twilight Zone\", created by Rod Serling in the late 1950s. Alfred Hitchcock is also cited as an inspiration, with the flocks of birds that often attack the protagonist being influenced by his classic horror film \"The Birds\".\n\nThe game's setting, Bright Falls, draws much inspiration from the early 1990s TV show \"Twin Peaks\", which was set in the titular town; both fictional small towns in the state of Washington. To research the Pacific Northwest setting for the game, a Remedy team travelled to the area and drove about 2000 miles between Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia, Canada, over two weeks, bringing back over 60,000 photographs and videos of various natural settings and Americana of the small towns in the area. Among towns they visited included Astoria, Oregon and North Bend, Washington, the latter where \"Twin Peaks\" was filmed, as well as locations used around Seattle for the film \"The Ring\". Even after returning to Finland, the Remedy team contacted Microsoft, located in Washington, for help with additional photographs.\n\nIn its structure, the story of \"Alan Wake\" plays out similarly to a mystery television program, where each episode brings another piece of the puzzle to the main ongoing story, yet have a distinct plot of their own. As such, \"Alan Wake\" is organised into episodes, which include narrative and plot devices normally used in TV, such as cliffhangers at the end of the episodes. A prominent borrowing from television is the \"Previously on \"Alan Wake\"...\" recap sequence that opens each episode, and serve to \"refresh the player's memory and point to things that will become relevant shortly.\" A different song plays at the end of every episode, imitating certain TV shows that feature different music during each episode's closing credits.\n\nThe main game itself is divided up into six episodes. Additionally, two \"special features\", titled \"The Signal\" and \"The Writer\", have been released as downloadable content (DLC). Together, \"Alan Wake\" and its DLCs constitute the \"first season\" of a bigger story. The main game is designed to have a satisfactory ending with the main character reaching his goal, while the DLCs form a two-part special that further expands on the game's story by \"[continuing] the fiction and [serving] as a bridge between seasons.\" While the game's developers have expressed interest in following \"Alan Wake\" up with a season two (i.e., a sequel), no plans have been announced about this.\n\nRemedy Entertainment chose the TV series storytelling format to establish a certain stylisation and pacing. The developers felt that watching episodes of certain TV shows – such as the heavily serialised series \"Lost\" – in the form of released box sets, at the viewers' pace, was a \"natural way of 'consuming media'\", and that this episodic format was a better fit for a long game. Remedy lauded \"Lost\" for its pacing as a thriller TV show.\n\nWhile Remedy had wanted to use the episodic release format, with each of the above episodes released digitally over time, Microsoft instead pushed Remedy to release the main game as a full product on retail disc. Phil Spencer, head of Xbox Game Studios, said in 2020 that at the time, Microsoft was concerned about if the episode format would work and its revenue potentials, projecting there would be declining sales with each successive episode, and instead believed a single release was likely more profitable. Spencer said that since then, they recognized this was likely a bad decision as it forced them into a certain way of thinking with respect to monetization.\n\nA number of real-life brands and products appear in \"Alan Wake\". The game's developers have expressed that they tried to \"be very conservative and attentive towards gamers\" with their use of product placement, and that they aimed \"to make the world feel more real rather than put ads in-your-face.\"\n\nExamples of such marketing include collectable Energizer batteries and lithium batteries to insert into the player's hand-held lights. The phone service provider Verizon Wireless is another prominent brand in \"Alan Wake\": besides Verizon branded mobile phones appearing on screen, there is a 30-second Verizon commercial viewable on one of the game's interactive TVs, as well as an allusion to the company's famous advertising line \"Can you hear me now?\" during a phone conversation in \"The Signal\" DLC. Additionally, billboards around Bright Falls advertise both Energizer and Verizon. Ford and Lincoln automobiles are also featured in the game.\n\nSeveral Microsoft related brands also appear in the game. Alan and Alice Wake's car shows that it has the Microsoft-powered Ford Sync in-vehicle entertainment system. An Xbox 360 console can be seen in one section of the game, with the box of the fictional \"Night Springs\" video game next to it, which are collectibles in \"The Writer\" DLC episode. In multiple sections of the game, Microsoft Tag bar codes can be seen; these can be scanned in real life by the user with the appropriate software on their mobile device. When scanned, these tags redirect players to a phone number with the voicemail from one of the game's character, or to a Verizon-sponsored web site where users gain access to exclusive \"Alan Wake\" extras for their console. This functionality is only available in the United States.\n\nThe game's score is composed by Petri Alanko. The soundtrack features the song \"War\" by Poets of the Fall, from the band's fourth studio album, \"Twilight Theater\". Sam Lake said that the song \"...is a prominent part of the \"Alan Wake\" soundtrack and the theme also links strongly to the game's storyline.\" Poets of the Fall also perform two original songs, \"Children of the Elder God\" and \"The Poet and the Muse\", under the name Old Gods of Asgard. The band wrote the ending theme to Remedy's previous game, \"\", called \"Late Goodbye\", which is based on a poem written by Lake. \"War\", however, was not written specifically for \"Alan Wake\". \"Haunted\" by Poe plays at the end of the second episode. \"Space Oddity\" by David Bowie plays over the end credits. Anomie Belle's \"How Can I Be Sure\" is featured in the third episode. \"Coconut\" by Harry Nilsson is played several times during game. On 20 July 2010, an official soundtrack consisting of 18 tracks was released.\n\n\"Alan Wake\" was first released exclusively for the Xbox 360 video game console. The game was scheduled to be released on 18 May 2010 in North America, and on 21 May in Europe. When the game went gold on 7 April 2010, the European release date was moved up a week. Therefore, the game was released in Europe first, on 14 May 2010, and then in North America on 18 May, as originally scheduled. On 23 November 2010, \"Alan Wake\" was released on the Games on Demand service of Xbox Live. On 16 February 2012, a version of the game for Microsoft Windows was released.\n\n\"Alan Wake\" was also released in a limited collector's edition, packaged in a case resembling a hardcover book. The collector's edition contains the game, a book titled \"The Alan Wake Files\", and an exclusive soundtrack CD. It also features a developer commentary, and lends access to virtual items for Xbox 360, such as themes and Avatar clothes.\n\nDespite the cancellation of the PC version at the same time as the Xbox 360 release as a result of Microsoft's decision, Remedy's Oskari Häkkinen stated that \"PC gaming is part of Remedy's heritage\" and that the developers still wanted to release a PC version of the game. Remedy continued pressing Microsoft to allow the creation of a PC version, eventually gaining it in mid-2011; Häkkinen attributed Microsoft's agreement partially to their repeated requests, but as well as Remedy's good standing with Microsoft, and the time factor, having the PC version be available ahead of \"American Nightmare\". Development of the PC version began in earnest, with a small team from Remedy working with Finnish independent developer Nitro Games. Instead of starting from the scrapped PC version, the team worked from the Xbox 360 code and added in new features to take advantage of more powerful elements on modern PC machines. Core to the PC version was to make sure that the game played well using typical keyboard and mouse controls in addition to a controller, and to assure the graphics exceeded the limitations of the Xbox 360; Matias Myllyrinne, Remedy's CEO, stated that these elements were important, as \"If this is not tuned to perfection, all the visuals are lost and the emotional touchstones are missed\". The PC version was completed in about five months, and the game formally announced to the public in December 2011.\n\nThe game, which includes the main game and both DLC chapters, was released on the Steam platform on 16 February 2012. Within 48 hours, Remedy announced that revenue from sale of this version surpassed their development and marketing costs for the game. A retail PC version, distributed by Nordic Games, was released on 2 March 2012, in both a regular edition and a Collector's edition, containing a soundtrack disc, \"The Alan Wake Files\", and other special content. The PC retail release for the United States was released on 24 April 2012, being distributed by Legacy Interactive.\n\nIn December 2013, Remedy and Xbox released a special collector's edition of the hit horror game, loaded with new content on the disc, including a 44-page digital comic book with art by Gerry Kissell and Amin Amat, and written by Remedy Entertainment's Mikko Rautalahti, who also wrote the script for the video game.\n\nA promotional live-action tie-in web series/miniseries titled \"Bright Falls\" was made available a few weeks before the game's release on the web and the Xbox Live service. The six episodes of \"Bright Falls\" were co-written and directed by Phillip Van, and they serve as a prequel to the game, set in the eponymous town before Alan Wake arrives there. The main character in the series is Jake Fischer (played by Christopher Forsyth), a newspaper reporter who visits the town on business.\n\nA number of characters are shared between \"Bright Falls\" and \"Alan Wake\", including diner waitress Rose, Dr. Emil Hartman, radio host Pat Maine and Alan Wake himself, who appears briefly in the final episode. The actors who play these characters also serve as voice actors and physical models for the characters in the game. The episodes were filmed in rural areas of Oregon and Washington, trying to match settings with the in-game locations as best as possible, according to Van.\n\nThe web series begins as Jake Fischer arrives in Bright Falls to interview Dr. Hartman on his new book, an assignment from his publication agency. After a series of encounters with local townspeople, Jake soon finds himself the victim of long periods of lost time and black outs. He finds himself waking up in the middle of a forest and other locations where he had not been previously. He also develops an aversion towards lights and daytime. The longer he stays in Bright Falls, the more violent his behaviour becomes. When he realises this, he tries to duct-tape himself to a refrigerator and recording videotape himself in his sleep to see what might be causing the behaviour. It is implied that he is being completely taken over by the Dark Presence, to the point of murdering several people. He then vanishes, just before the arrival of Alan and Alice Wake.\n\nDuring 2010, two \"special feature\" episodes of \"Alan Wake\" were developed and released as downloadable content (DLC) on the Xbox Live service, which serve to bridge the gap between the game's ending, and a possible sequel.\n\nThe first of the two, titled \"The Signal\", was released on 27 July 2010. David Houghton of GamesRadar+ said it was one of the best segments of the game, but worried that it made the main game feel comparatively less impressive.\n\nThe second episode, \"The Writer\", was released on 12 October 2010. Erik Brudvig of IGN called it a must-buy for anyone that already purchased \"The Signal\", and said it satisfyingly closed out the game's story. He did feel that both DLCs were pricey for the amount of content they provided.\n\nThe limited collector's edition of the game includes a 144-page book called \"The Alan Wake Files\", which expands on the storyline of the game. A novelisation of \"Alan Wake\" was written by Rick Burroughs. An art/making of book, entitled \"Alan Wake: Illuminated\" is also available.\n\n\"Alan Wake\" received \"generally favorable\" reviews on both platforms according to review aggregator Metacritic.\n\nMichael Plant from \"The Independent\" gave the game a score of 5/5. He praised \"Alan Wake\" for its \"flawless pacing\", which \"ensures a compulsive experience\". The editing and plot were also received very positively, making the game \"the kind of experience the current console generation was made for.\"\n\n\"The Daily Telegraph\" rated the game 9/10 with editor Nick Cowen being impressed by its \"stunning\" look, stating the town of Bright Falls and its surrounding environment to be \"authentic\" in terms of architecture, vegetation, weather and lighting. He described the atmosphere as being able to \"...turn on a dime from feeling safe and serene to one of choking menace and foreboding...\". Combat mechanics and plot were also praised with the first making \"the player feel constantly under threat.\" and the latter being described as one of the game's \"strongest assets\". Criticism included the quality of the facial animation and the relatively short length of the game.\n\nDirk Lammers said the game kept \"players on the edge of their seats\", giving a final score of 4 out of 4 in his review for the Associated Press. Matt Greenop from \"The New Zealand Herald\" rated the game 5/5 and praised the game's \"excellent pace\" due to its episodic format. He also praised the \"chilling\" storyline, \"brilliant environments\" and concluded the game to be \"one of the most innovative and entertaining titles so far this year.\" William Vitka from the \"New York Post\" graded it B+, praising the game for its \"scary atmosphere\", music, graphics and \"surprising level of complexity\" in combat, but commented negatively on the game's animation and storyline.\n\nBrian Crecente, editor-in-chief of Kotaku, praised the general use of light as a gameplay-mechanic. He commented on the episodic structure, saying it made the player feel satisfied even after short gameplay sessions. He also praised the overall storyline, having played the final episode thrice in a row, saying: \"For the first time in my life, I have experienced something that plays like a game but has the impact of a movie... Alan Wake is a powerful ride, an experience bound to leave you thinking about it and wanting more for days after its completion.\" He criticised the game for not providing enough information about Wake and his wife, despite being \"packed with memorable people\", but concluded that the game \"redefines interactive storytelling\".\n\nTom McShea criticised the game for lacking \"surprising, memorable gameplay moments\" in his review for GameSpot, but hailed it for its \"fresh\" story-telling, great original as well as licensed music, \"subtle\" lighting effects, which, along with the soundtrack, \"create a disturbing atmosphere\", \"satisfying\" combat system and \"clever\" inclusion of collectibles, giving a final score of 8.5/10.\n\nIGN's Charles Onyett scored the game 9/10, providing it with the \"Editors' Choice Award\". He described it as \"hard to put down once you have started\", and appreciated the game for its episodic structure, \"interesting\" story-telling mechanic, lighting effects, soundtrack and combat system, which he described as \"fast and responsive\", but criticised the writing as \"uneven\". The game received high marks for its \"strong atmosphere\", \"fun gameplay\", and \"great visuals\", but lost some due to its \"weak ending\".\n\nTom Orry from VideoGamer.com also awarded a score of 9/10, praising the game for its \"clever narrative\", \"incredible atmosphere\" and soundtrack which he described as \"one of the best and most memorable I've ever heard in a video game\". GameTrailers gave the game an 8.6/10. The review praised the game's presentation for \"selling you completely on its twisted nightmare\", and providing a \"genuine sense of dread\". Eurogamer's Ellie Gibson awarded a score of 7/10, stating that although she did not consider the game to be very original, she found it accessible and undemanding, with a \"neat combat mechanic\".\n\nChris Kohler from Wired magazine was more critical and gave it 6/10, saying \"when presented with an infinite number of possible resolutions, any answer is going to feel arbitrary. Alan Wake starts strong but finishes weak. Neither the gameplay nor the story deliver on their potential by the time the credits roll\". Kohler, however, praised main character, certain gameplay decisions and \"unique story\".\n\n\"Alan Wake\" has received a number of nominations and awards for its achievements in video gaming in 2010. Editors of \"Time\" magazine rendered \"Alan Wake\" the best video game of 2010. In its Best Xbox 360 Games of 2010 list, IGN awarded \"Alan Wake\" \"Best Horror Game\", and also nominated it for \"Best Story,\" \"Coolest Atmosphere,\" \"Most Innovative Gameplay,\" and \"Best Character\" (for the character of Alan Wake). The game was nominated in the \"Best Xbox 360 Game\" category at the 2010 Spike Video Game Awards, and received three nominations at the 2nd Annual Inside Gaming Awards in the categories \"Best Narrative,\" \"Best Sound Design\" and \"Most Compelling Character\" (for Alan Wake). GameSpot's Best Games of 2010 Awards featured seven nominations for the game, including \"Best Story\" and \"Best Writing/Dialogue,\" and won the reader's choice award for \"Best Original IP.\" IGN ranked it No. 61 in their \"Top Modern Games\" ranking.\n\nThe game's soundtrack has won Best Score – European at the 2010 Annual Game Music Awards, with the panel stating \"Breaking composer Petri Alanko's expansive score for the critically acclaimed Alan Wake captured the hearts of gamers and stand-alone listeners alike with its intimate orchestrations and psychological explorations.\"\n\n\"Alan Wake\" was released the same week as \"Red Dead Redemption\", and thus initial sales were slow; NPD Group stated sales for the first two weeks reached 145,000 units while \"Red Dead Redemption\" had reached 1.5 million during the same period. However, in the months that followed, it gained more sales traction through word-of-mouth.\n\nIndustryGamers reported in December 2011 that sales of \"Alan Wake\", currently reported at 330,000 by NPD Group, were omitting about 900,000 units digitally redeemed during the Xbox's 2011 Holiday Bundle, in addition to an additional 170,000 global units, bringing the total sales to around 1.4 million.\n\nOn 13 March 2012, Remedy Entertainment announced that the game has passed 2 million copies sold, including Xbox 360 and PC. On 23 May 2013, Remedy creative director Sam Lake announced that the game and its standalone follow up had sold 3 million copies. On 25 March 2015, Remedy's CEO Matias Myllyrinne tweeted that the franchise had sold over 4.5 million units. The following month a Polygon story on the game's prototype for a sequel mentioned that \"Alan Wake\" had sold more than 3.2 million copies.\n\nAccording to a report, \"Alan Wake\" was the second most illegally copied Xbox 360 game of 2010, with more than 1.1 million downloads. It includes an amusing feature where if \"pirated\", the character wears an eye patch during the game.\n\nDue to expiring music licenses, all digital and retail versions of \"Alan Wake\" were pulled from purchase from the various storefronts as of 15 May 2017, though Remedy offered a large discount for the title in the days prior to removal. The removal does not affect those who already own the game, nor does it impact the availability of \"Alan Wake's American Nightmare\", though that title will likely be affected similarly when its own licensing deals expire.\n\nHowever, by October 2018, Remedy had been able to rework the music licensing details with Microsoft's help, and the game was made available again on Windows storefronts, with the original music tracks. Remedy is currently working to also secure the rights for the Xbox platform in the near future.\n\nAt \"Alan Wake\"s release, Remedy had intended for a sequel; developer Oskari Häkkinen stated that Remedy saw the game as \"Season 1\" and its DLC was to \"bridge the gap to what we're working towards.\" Häkkinen stated they were not directly working on a sequel at that time, as Microsoft had focused them to complete the DLC. Writer Mikko Rautalahti adds the story is \"bigger than one game\" and the sequel would be \"weird and wonderful\".\n\nIn May 2011, leaked information led to Remedy confirming they were working on a new \"Alan Wake\" project, but affirmed it was not a full sequel. This was ultimately revealed to be \"Alan Wake's American Nightmare\", a short standalone game released in 2012 that follows Alan's adventures after the first game that they wanted to release on the Xbox Live Arcade platform. The Remedy team had looked at a project borrowing from zombie and monster films like \"From Dusk till Dawn\", and wanted to create more of a sandbox mode for players to fight off waves of enemies (which became the game's Arcade mode, \"Fight Till Dawn\"); they then worked these elements into Alan's story, keeping the theme of \"The Twilight Zone\" to progress the story.\n\nIn May 2013, a new game by Remedy was announced at the Xbox One event called \"Quantum Break\", before explaining the following day that a sequel to \"Alan Wake\" had been postponed. Despite their love of the property and initially beginning work on a sequel, \"Alan Wake\" was not financially successful enough to receive the funding they needed to continue developing the sequel at the time. In April 2015, Polygon published an article describing the development process of \"Alan Wake 2\" that started shortly after the first game released. \"Alan Wake 2\" already had a working prototype and Remedy was prepared to pitch the game to Microsoft. However, according to Sam Lake, Remedy's founder, Microsoft wanted something else and development of the sequel has shifted to \"Quantum Break. \"Most of the ideas for \"Alan Wake 2 \"were implemented on \"American Nightmare\", like the game's location, the Arizona Desert, and the concept of Taken enemies with special abilities.\n\nIn July 2018, Remedy CEO Telo Virtala stated that any further sequels to \"Alan Wake\" would require Microsoft Studios' approval as the publishing rights holder, though Remedy otherwise owns all other IP rights to the series. Virtala stated: \"Considering our history... Alan Wake was really interesting but it was a collaboration with Microsoft. Due to certain reasons, it never got a sequel.\" Director of communications Thomas Puha stated in April 2019 that Remedy had briefly returned to work on an \"Alan Wake\" property about two years prior, but the effort did not work out, and the company is presently booked for the next few years, between their own new game \"Control\", supporting Smilegate on its game \"CrossFire\", and another new project. Puha said that the only limited factor for them to work on an \"Alan Wake\" sequel was \"time, money, and resources\".\n\nIn July 2019, Remedy fully acquired the rights to \"Alan Wake\" from Microsoft, including a one-time royalty payment of about for the game series' past sales.\n\nFollowing \"Alan Wake: American Nightmare\", Remedy released \"Quantum Break\" in 2016, and then \"Control\" in 2019. \"Control\" is based on a fictional Federal Bureau of Control that seeks out paranormal activity and secures objects that may be behind these \"Altered World Events\" (AWEs). \"Control\" has several Easter eggs to \"Alan Wake\", with the events of Bright Falls being treated as an AWE for the Bureau. Elements of \"Alan Wake\", such as Alan himself, the typewriter and cabin, and the Clicker, are mentioned directly by in-game memos within \"Control\". \"Control\"s second paid DLC, titled \"AWE\", will be \"what the [Federal Bureau of Control] has been investigating regarding Alan Wake\".\n\nIn September 2018, Remedy Entertainment and Contradiction Films announced plans to develop a live-action \"Alan Wake\" series, with Peter Calloway as the showrunner and Remedy's Sam Lake as executive producer. Contradiction Film's Tomas Harlan had seen \"Alan Wake\"s potential as a television series, in part that the game was constructed in episodic chapters and presented in a linear fashion, and had spoken to Lake about it several times, and in 2018 began to start on a firm planning process, which including bringing Calloway on board during the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2018. The show plans to use concepts from the scrapped \"Alan Wake 2\", as well as building upon what the first game and \"American Nightmare\" provided; Harlan does not expect the series to be in lock-step with the game and while Alan Wake would be the central character of the show, they would spend more time developing his companions from the game. The group planned to shop the show around to networks in October.\n\n"}

It was invented between 1920 and 1922 by Osman Yusuf Kenadid, the son of Sultan Yusuf Ali Kenadid and brother of Sultan Ali Yusuf Kenadid of the Sultanate of Hobyo.\n\nWhile Osmanya gained reasonably wide acceptance in Somalia and quickly produced a considerable body of literature, it proved difficult to spread among the population mainly due to stiff competition from the long-established Arabic script as well as the emerging Somali Latin alphabet developed by a number of leading scholars of Somali, including Musa Haji Ismail Galal, B. W. Andrzejewski and Shire Jama Ahmed. \n\nAs nationalist sentiments grew and since the Somali language had long lost its ancient script, the adoption of a universally recognized writing script for the Somali language became an important point of discussion. After independence, little progress was made on the issue, as opinion was divided over whether the Arabic or Latin scripts should be used instead.\n\nIn October 1972, because of the Latin script's simplicity, its ability to cope with all of the sounds in the language, and the widespread existence of machines and typewriters designed for its use, made President Mohamed Siad Barre require it for writing Somali instead of the Arabic or Osmanya scripts. Barre's administration subsequently launched a massive literacy campaign designed to ensure its sole adoption, which led to a sharp decline in use of Osmanya.\n\nThe direction of reading and writing in Osmanya is from left to right. Letter names are based on the names of letters in Arabic, and the long vowels \"uu\" and \"ii\" are represented by the letters \"waaw\" and \"yaa\", respectively.\n\nOsmanya script was added to the Unicode Standard in April 2003 with the release of version 4.0.\n\nThe Unicode block for Osmanya is U+10480–U+104AF:\n\n\n\n"}

Four of them also won the Triple Crown. The most famous loser in the Wood Memorial was Secretariat, who finished third in 1973. \n\nThe winner of the Wood Memorial has not won the Kentucky Derby since 2000, in part because several became injured in the weeks between the two races.

{"id": "1895372", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1895372", "title": "Rabbit at Rest", "text": "Rabbit at Rest\n\nRabbit at Rest is a 1990 novel by John Updike. It is the fourth and final novel in a tetralogy, succeeding \"Rabbit, Run\"; \"Rabbit Redux\"; and \"Rabbit Is Rich.\" A related novella, \"Rabbit Remembered\", was published in 2001. \"Rabbit at Rest\" won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1991, the second \"Rabbit\" novel to garner that award.\n\nThis novel is part of the series that follows the life of Harry \"Rabbit\" Angstrom from 1960 to 1990. \"Rabbit at Rest\" focuses on the years 1988–89. Harry, nearly 40 years after his glory days as a high school basketball star in a mid-sized Pennsylvania city, has retired with Janice, his wife of 33 years, to sunny Florida during the cold months, where Harry is depressed, dangerously overweight and desperate for reasons to keep on living.\n\nUnable to stop nibbling corn chips, macadamia nuts and other junk food, Rabbit nearly dies after a heart attack while sunfishing with his nine-year-old granddaughter, Judy. In a \"redemption\" of the drowning death of his infant daughter Rebecca in the earlier novel \"Rabbit, Run\", he saves Judy from drowning during their sunfishing afternoon.\nHe is distracted from his own existential worries by the acts of his drug-addicted son, Nelson, to whom Janice (the actual owner of the Angstroms' wealth) has given control of the family's thriving business, a Pennsylvania Toyota dealership. The discovery that Nelson has been stealing from the company to support his drug habit causes Harry to lose the family business. Despite his multiplying difficulties, Rabbit manages to take solace in the presence of Judy, who has matured into a beautiful and charming young lady, reminding him of his high-school glory days. He is less attached to his four-year-old grandson Roy, who seems wary and fearful of Rabbit, much like Nelson.\n\nWhile recuperating from heart surgery, Rabbit recognizes a nurse, Annabelle Byer, as his illegitimate daughter by his old girlfriend, Ruth. He spends time with her without identifying himself as her likely father. Then, his long-term mistress, Thelma Harrison (wife of his high-school nemesis Ron), dies of lupus. Ron confronts Harry at Thelma's funeral, but the men later reconcile over golf. Harry also encounters Cindy Murkett at the funeral, a woman he had once been obsessed with, and is saddened to see she has become an obese and bitter divorcee.\n\nAfter Nelson comes back from a treatment program, and Janice begins work as a real estate agent, the family finds out that Harry has had a one-night stand with Pru, Nelson's wife, on the night after he was released from the hospital. Janice's anger over this betrayal prompts Harry to escape to Florida. While in hiding, Harry has a heart attack shortly after winning a one-on-one basketball game with a local youth (echoing the opening of \"Rabbit, Run\" in which Harry impulsively joins a group of teenagers playing basketball). Nelson and Janice reach Harry's bedside while he is still alive. Janice forgives him for his infidelities and he reconciles with his son. His personal business now largely resolved, Rabbit dies.\n\nThe novel deals with the passage of time, and generational change. Harry's decline mirrors the decline of the United States which, in the period the novel is set, lacks what Harry saw as its animating purpose: the Cold War.\n\n"}

It is the third novel of the tetrology that begins with \"Rabbit, Run\", continues with \"Rabbit Redux\", and concludes with \"Rabbit at Rest\". There is also a related novella, \"Rabbit Remembered\" (2001). \"Rabbit Is Rich\" was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the National Book Award for Fiction in 1982, as well as the National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction in 1981. The first-edition hardcover \"rainbow\" dust jacket for the novel was designed by the author and is significantly different from the horizontal-stripe designs deployed on the other three Rabbit novel covers. Subsequent printings, however, including trade paperbacks, feature the stripe motif with stock images of a set of car keys or an image of a late-1970s Japanese automobile.\n\nThis third novel of Updike's \"Rabbit\" series examines the life of Harry \"Rabbit\" Angstrom, a one-time high school basketball star, who has reached a paunchy middle-age without relocating from Brewer, Pennsylvania, the poor, fictional city of his birth. Harry and Janice, his wife of 22 years, live comfortably, having inherited her late father's Toyota dealership. He is indeed rich, but Harry's persistent problems—his wife's drinking, his troubled son's schemes, his libido, and spectres from his past—complicate life. Having achieved an opulent lifestyle that would have embarrassed his working-class parents, Harry is not greedy, but neither is he ever quite satisfied. Harry has grown smitten with a country-club friend's young wife. He worries about Nelson, his indecisive son, a student at Kent State University. Throughout the book, Harry wonders whether his former lover, Ruth, ever gave birth to their illegitimate daughter.\n\n"}

It was more of a series of maneuvers and skirmishes than an actual battle and casualties were negligible.\n\nIn the initial stages of the campaign, Union Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans's Army of the Cumberland induced the Confederate Army of Tennessee under Gen. Braxton Bragg to evacuate the city of Chattanooga, Tennessee. Rosecrans dispatched three corps on three different roads toward northwestern Georgia. The corps on the center road was the XIV Corps under Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas, which moved just across the border to Trenton, Georgia, and prepared to move on to Lafayette in pursuit of Bragg. Lafayette was the present location of Bragg's army. Due to misinformation and poor intelligence, Rosecrans was convinced that Bragg was demoralized and was retreating to Dalton, Georgia, farther to the southeast. But once he realized that the Union forces had separated and were vulnerable, Bragg intended to attack Thomas, halt his advance, and defeat him.\n\nThomas's corps raced forward, seized the important gaps in Missionary Ridge and Pigeon Mountain, and moved out into McLemore Cove. Maj. Gen. James S. Negley's division, supported by Brig. Gen. Absalom Baird's division, was moving across the mouth of the cove on the Dug Gap road when Negley learned that Confederate units were concentrating around Dug Gap. Moving through determined resistance, he closed on the gap, withdrawing to Davis' Cross Roads in the evening of September 10 to await the supporting division.\n\nBragg had ordered Maj. Gen. Thomas C. Hindman with his division to assault Negley in the flank at Davis's Cross Roads, while Maj. Gen. Patrick Cleburne's division forced its way through Dug Gap to strike Negley in front. Hindman was to receive reinforcements for this movement, but most of them did not arrive. The Confederate officers, therefore, met and decided that they could not attack in their present condition. The next morning, however, fresh troops did arrive, and the Confederates began to move on the Union line. The supporting Union division had by now joined Negley, and, hearing of a Confederate attack, the Union forces determined that a strategic withdrawal to Stevens Gap was in order. Negley first moved his division to the ridge east of West Chickamauga Creek, where it established a defensive line. The other division then moved through them to Stevens Gap and established a defensive line there. Both divisions awaited the rest of Thomas's corps. All of this was accomplished under constant pursuit and fire from the Confederates.\n\nAfter his abortive attempt to attack one isolated Union corps, Bragg turned his attention to the corps to his north, the XXI Corps under Maj. Gen. Thomas L. Crittenden, setting the stage for the bloody Battle of Chickamauga on September 19.\n\n\n"}

The mineral spessartine should not be confused with a type of igneous rock (a lamprophyre) called spessartite.\n\nSpessartine's name is a derivative of Spessart in Bavaria, Germany, the type locality of the mineral. It occurs most often in granite pegmatite and allied rock types and in certain low-grade metamorphic phyllites. Sources include Australia, Myanmar, India, Afghanistan, Israel, Madagascar, Namibia, Nigeria, Mozambique, Tanzania and the United States. Spessartine of an orange-yellow has been called \"Mandarin garnet\" and is found in Madagascar. Violet-red spessartines are found in rhyolites in Colorado and Maine. In Madagascar, spessartines are exploited either in their bedrock or in alluvium. The orange garnets result from sodium-rich pegmatites. Spessartines are found in bedrock in the highlands in the Sahatany valley. Those in alluvium are generally found in southern Madagascar or in the Maevatanana region.\n\nSpessartine forms a solid solution series with the garnet species almandine. Well-formed crystals from this series, varying in color from very dark-red to bright yellow-orange, were found in Latinka, Rhodope Mountains, Kardzhali Province, Bulgaria. Spessartine, like the other garnets, always occurs as a blend with other species. Gems with high spessartine content tend toward a light orange hue, while almandine prevalence induces red or brownish hues.\n"}

It has the chemical formula of CaAl(SiO) but the calcium may, in part, be replaced by ferrous iron and the aluminium by ferric iron. The name grossular is derived from the botanical name for the gooseberry, \"grossularia\", in reference to the green garnet of this composition that is found in Siberia. Other shades include cinnamon brown (cinnamon stone variety), red, and yellow. Grossular is a gemstone.\n\nIn geological literature, grossular has often been called \"grossularite\". Since 1971, however, use of the term grossularite for the mineral has been discouraged by the International Mineralogical Association.\n\nHessonite or \"cinnamon stone\" is a common variety of grossular with the general formula: CaAlSiO. The name comes from the (hēssōn), meaning \"inferior\"; an allusion to its lower hardness and lower density than most other garnet species varieties.\n\nIt has a characteristic red color, inclining to orange or yellow, much like that of zircon. It was shown many years ago, by Sir Arthur Herbert Church, that many gemstones, especially engraved gems (commonly regarded as zircon), were actually hessonite. The difference is readily detected by the specific gravity, that of hessonite being 3.64 to 3.69, while that of zircon is about 4.6. Hessonite has a similar hardness to that of quartz (being about 7 on the mohs scale), while the hardness of most garnet species is nearer 7.5.\n\nHessonite comes chiefly from Sri Lanka and India, where it is found generally in placer deposits, though its occurrence in its native matrix is not unknown. It is also found in Brazil and California.\n\nGrossular is found in contact metamorphosed limestones with vesuvianite, diopside, wollastonite and wernerite.\n\nA highly sought after variety of gem garnet is the fine green Grossular garnet from Kenya and Tanzania called tsavorite. This garnet was discovered in the 1960s in the Tsavo area of Kenya, from which the gem takes its name.\n\n\"Viluite\" is a variety name of grossular, that is not a recognized mineral species. It is usually olive green though sometimes brownish or reddish, brought about by impurities in the crystal. Viluite is found associated with and is similar in appearance to vesuvianite, and there is confusion in terminology as \"viluite\" has long been used as a synonym for wiluite, a sorosilicate of the vesuvianite group. This confusion in nomenclature dates back to James Dwight Dana. It comes from the Vilyuy river area in Siberia.\n\nGrossular is known by many other names, and also some misnomers; \"colophonite\" – coarse granules of garnet, \"ernite\", \"gooseberry-garnet\" – light green colored and translucent, \"olyntholite\"/\"olytholite\", \"romanzovite\", and \"tellemarkite\". Misnomers include \"South African jade\", \"garnet jade\", \"Transvaal jade\", and \"African jade\".\n\nVermont has grossular garnet as its state gemstone. \n\n\n"}

He was also a columnist for the New York \"Daily News\" from 1987 to 2016. He frequently co-hosts the radio and television program \"Democracy Now!\" with Amy Goodman.\n\nGonzález was born on October 15, 1947 in Ponce, Puerto Rico to Juan \"Pepe\" González, who was a veteran of the Puerto Rican 65th Infantry during World War II, and Florinda Rivera González. González was raised in East Harlem and Brooklyn. After a period as editor of his high school newspaper, the \"Lane Reporter\", González attended Columbia College and graduated in the mid-1960s. At Columbia College he was active in the anti-Vietnam War movement and played a leading role in the protests that shut down the college in spring 1968 as one of three \"Strike Central\" representatives on the strike coordinating committee. In the student strike that followed the police riot that ended the occupation he continued in this role and in negotiations at the apartment of Eugene Galanter. He was a member of Students for a Democratic Society and a founding member of the New York City branch of the Young Lords, serving on its first central committee as its Minister of Education.\n\nIn 1981, he was elected president of the National Congress for Puerto Rican Rights, a political organization that concentrated on registering Latino voters.\n\nAfter just a couple of weeks into studying journalism at Temple University, González's instructor encouraged him to apply for a post at the instructor's other workplace the \"Philadelphia Daily News\". González application led him to become a clerk in 1978; however, within months he quickly was employed as a full-time reporter. In 1987 González landed a job as a reporter for \"The Village Voice\". However, soon after returning to New York González was offered his own column and better salary at the \"New York Daily News\" and so he chose to work there instead.\n\nWhilst working for the \"New York Daily News\", González won his first George Polk Award in 1998 for \"unflinching\" investigative reporting.\n\nHe is former president of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, for which he created the Parity Project, an innovative program designed to help news organizations recruit and retain Hispanic reporters and managers. In 2008, The National Association of Hispanic Journalists inducted González into the organization's Hall of Fame.\n\nIn addition, he has been named by \"Hispanic Business Magazine\" as one of America's most influential Hispanics, as well as earning a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Hispanic Academy of Media Arts and Sciences.\n\nFor two years, González was the Belle Zeller Visiting Professor in Public Policy and Administration at Brooklyn College/CUNY, with an appointment in both the Department of Puerto Rican and Latino Studies, as well as the Political Science Department.\n\nIn December 2006, he reported the results of an exclusive interview with the purported \"Fourth Man\" who was present at the scene on November 25 when plainclothes NYPD officers shot and killed Sean Bell.\n\nHe has written extensively on the health effects arising from the September 11 attacks and the cover-up of Ground Zero air hazards in columns in the New York \"Daily News\". He was the first reporter in New York City to write on the health effects arising from the September 11, 2001 attacks.\n\nGonzález was awarded the 2010 Justice in Action Award from the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, and in 2011 won the George Polk Award a second time for a series of columns in the New York \"Daily News\" which exposed criminal acts connected with Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s CityTime project, a new computerized payroll system, leading to the federal indictment of four consultancies for fraud.\n\nGonzález's and Goodman's voices were used (uncredited) over news footage concerning Hurricane Katrina in the opening montage of New Orleans at the beginning of the action-drama film \"Streets of Blood\" (2009).\n\nGonzález has cited a prime motivating force in his work has been, \"a sense about the unjust treatment of people\".\n\nIn 2015, the New York City chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists inducted González into its New York Journalism Hall of Fame, along with Max Frankel, Charlie Rose, Lesley Stahl, Paul Steiger, and Richard Stolley.\n\nSince 2018 he has held the post of Professor of Professional Practice at Rutgers University-New Brunswick in the School of Communication and Information.\n\nGonzález has written four books:\n\nGonzález is also the co-author, with Joseph Torres, of \"News for All the People: The Epic Story of Race and the American Media\" (2011, ), a history of the American media with special focus on media outlets owned and controlled by people of color, and how they were suppressed—sometimes violently—by mainstream political, corporate and media leaders.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1895420", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1895420", "title": "House Made of Dawn", "text": "House Made of Dawn\n\nHouse Made of Dawn is a 1968 novel by N. Scott Momaday, widely credited as leading the way for the breakthrough of Native American literature into the mainstream. It was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1969, and has also been noted for its significance in Native American anthropology.\n\nWith 198 pages, \"House Made of Dawn\" was conceived first as a series of poems, then replanned as stories, and finally shaped into a novel. It is based largely on Momaday's firsthand knowledge of life at Jemez Pueblo. Like the novel's protagonist, Abel, Momaday lived both inside and outside of mainstream society, growing up on reservations and later attending school and teaching at major universities. In the novel Momaday combines his personal experiences with his imagination – something his father, Al Momaday, and his mother taught him to do, according to his memoir \"The Names\".\n\nDetails in the novel correspond to real-life occurrences. Momaday refers in his memoir \"The Names\" to an incident that took place at Jemez on which he based the murder in \"House Made of Dawn\". A native resident killed a New Mexico state trooper, and the incident created great controversy. Native American beliefs and customs, actual geographical locations, and realistic events also inspired elements in \"House Made of Dawn\". According to one of Momaday's letters:\n\nAbel is a composite of the boys I knew at Jemez. I wanted to say something about them. An appalling number of them are dead; they died young, and they died violent deaths. One of them was drunk and run over. Another was drunk and froze to death. (He was the best runner I ever knew.) One man was murdered, butchered by a kinsman under a telegraph pole just east of San Isidro. And yet another committed suicide. A good many who have survived this long are living under the Relocation Program in Los Angeles, Chicago, Detroit, etc. They're a sad lot of people.\n\nAccording to one historian, the novel is highly accurate in its portrayal of a peyote service, though in southern California such services normally take place in the desert, not the city.\n\nIn 1972, an independent feature film based on \"House Made of Dawn\" by Richardson Morse was released. Momaday and Morse wrote the script. Larry Littlebird starred. Considered a \"classic\", NMAI went to great efforts to preserve the film, now housing all film elements in its film and media archives, which provide study copies.\n\n\"House Made of Dawn\" begins with the protagonist, Abel, returning to his reservation in New Mexico after fighting in World War II. The war has left him emotionally devastated and he arrives too drunk to recognize his grandfather, Francisco. Now an old man with a lame leg, Francisco had earlier been a respected hunter and participant in the village's religious ceremonies. He raised Abel after the death of Abel's mother and older brother, Vidal. Francisco instilled in Abel a sense of native traditions and values, but the war and other events severed Abel's connections to that world of spiritual and physical wholeness and connectedness to the land and its people, a world known as a \"house made of dawn.\"\n\nAfter arriving in the village, Abel attains a job through Father Olguin chopping wood for Angela St. John, a rich white woman who is visiting the area to bathe in the mineral waters. Angela seduces Abel to distract herself from her own unhappiness, but also because she senses an animal-like quality in Abel. She promises to help him leave the reservation to find better means of employment. Possibly as a result of this affair, Abel realizes that his return to the reservation has been unsuccessful. He no longer feels at home and he is confused. His turmoil becomes clearer when he is beaten in a game of horsemanship by a local albino Indian named Juan Reyes, described as \"the white man.\" Deciding Juan is a witch, Abel stabs him to death outside of a bar. Abel is then found guilty of murder and sent to jail.\n\nPart II takes place in Los Angeles, California six and a half years later. Abel has been released from prison and unites with a local group of Indians. The leader of the group, Reverend John Big Bluff Tosamah, Priest of the Sun, teases Abel as a \"longhair\" who is unable to assimilate to the demands of the modern world. However, Abel befriends a man named Ben Benally from a reservation in New Mexico and develops an intimate relationship with Milly, a kind, blonde social worker. However, his overall situation has not improved and Abel ends up drunk on the beach with his hands, head, and upper body beaten and broken. Memories run through his mind of the reservation, the war, jail, and Milly. Abel eventually finds the strength to pick himself up and he stumbles across town to the apartment he shares with Ben.\n\nBen puts Abel on a train back to the reservation and narrates what has happened to Abel in Los Angeles. Life had not been easy for Abel in the city. First, he was ridiculed by Reverend Tosamah during a poker game with the Indian group. Abel is too drunk to fight back. He remains drunk for the next two days and misses work. When he returns to his job, the boss harasses him and Abel quits. A downward spiral begins and Abel continues to get drunk every day, borrow money from Ben and Milly, and laze around the apartment. Fed up with Abel's behavior, Ben throws him out of the apartment. Abel then seeks revenge on Martinez, a corrupt policeman who robbed Ben one night and hit Abel across the knuckles with his big stick. Abel finds Martinez and is almost beaten to death. While Abel is in the hospital recovering, Ben calls Angela who visits him and revives his spirit, just as he helped revive her spirit years ago, by reciting a story about a bear and a maiden which incidentally matches an old Navajo myth.\n\nAbel returns to the reservation in New Mexico to take care of his grandfather, who is dying. His grandfather tells him the stories from his youth and stresses the importance of staying connected to his people's traditions. When the time comes, Abel dresses his grandfather for burial and smears his own body with ashes. As the dawn breaks, Abel begins to run. He is participating in a ritual his grandfather told him about—the race of the dead. As he runs, Abel begins to sing for himself and Francisco. He is coming back to his people and his place in the world.\n\n\"House Made of Dawn\" produced no extensive commentary when it was first published—perhaps, as William James Smith mused in a review of the work in \"Commonwealth\" LXXXVIII (20 September 1968), because \"it seems slightly un-American to criticize an American Indian's novel\"—and its subject matter and theme did not seem to conform to the prescription above.\n\nEarly reviewers such as Marshall Sprague in his \"Anglos and Indians\", \"New York Times Book Review\" (9 June 1968) complained that the novel contained \"plenty of haze\" but suggested that perhaps this was inevitable in rendering \"the mysteries of cultures different from our own\" and then goes on to describe this as \"one reason why [the story] rings so true.\" Sprague also discussed the seeming contradiction of writing about a native oral culture—especially in English, the language of the so-called oppressor. He continues, \"The mysteries of cultures different from our own cannot be explained in a short novel, even by an artist as talented as Mr. Momaday\". The many critics—such as Carole Oleson in her \"The Remembered Earth: Momaday's \"House Made of Dawn\"\", \"South Dakota Review\" II (Spring 1973)—who have given the novel extended analysis acknowledge that much more explanation is needed \"before outsiders can fully appreciate all the subtleties of \"House Made of Dawn\".\" Baine Kerr has elaborated this point to suggest that Momaday has used \"the modern Anglo novel [as] a vehicle for a sacred text,\" that in it he is \"attempting to transliterate Indian culture, myth, and sensibility into an alien art form, without loss.\"\nHowever, some commentators have been more critical. In reviewing the \"disappointing\" novel for \"Commonweal\" (September 20, 1968), William James Smith chastised Momaday for his mannered style: \"[He] writes in a lyric vein that borrows heavily from some of the slacker rhythms of the King James Bible ... It makes you itch for a blue pencil to knock out all the intensified words that maintain the soporific flow\" [link added]. Other critics said it was nothing but \"an interesting variation of the old alienation theme\"; \"a social statement rather than ... a substantial artistic achievement\"; \"a memorable failure,\" \"a reflection, not a novel in the comprehensive sense of the word\" with \"awkward dialogue and affected description\"; \"a batch of dazzling fragments\".\n\nOverall, the book has come to be seen as a success. Sprague concluded in his article that the novel was superb. And Momaday was widely praised for the novel's rich description of Indian life. Now there is a greater recognition of Momaday's fictional art, and critics have come to recognise its unique achievement as a novel. Despite a qualified reception the novel had succeeded in making its impact even on earlier critics though they were not sure of their own responses. They found it \"a story of considerable power and beauty,\" \"strong in imaginative imagery,\" creating a \"world of wonder and exhilarating vastness.\" In more recent criticism there are signs of greater clarity of understanding of Momaday's achievement. In his review (which appeared in \"Western American Literature\" 5 (Spring 1970)), John Z. Bennett had pointed out how through \"a remarkable synthesis of poetic mode and profound emotional and intellectual insight into the Indians' perduring human status[\"] Momaday's novel becomes at last the very act it is dramatizing, an artistic act, a \"creation hymn.\"\n\n\nCritic Kenneth Lincoln identified the Pulitzer for \"House Made of Dawn\" as the moment that sparked the Native American Renaissance. Many major American Indian novelists (e.g. Paula Gunn Allen, Leslie Marmon Silko, Gerald Vizenor, James Welch, Sherman Alexie and Louise Erdrich) have cited the novel as a significant inspiration for their own work.\n\nOriginally published by Harper & Row, editions have subsequently been brought out by HarperCollins, the Penguin Group, Econo-Clad Books and the University of Arizona Press.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Vaginal lubrication can be removed by using herbal aphrodisiacs, household detergents, antiseptics, by wiping out the vagina, or by placing leaves in the vagina besides other methods. Dry sex is associated with increased health risks.\n\nRemoving or preventing vaginal lubrication through practices associated with dry sex increases friction during intercourse, which may be perceived as increased vaginal tightness, and enhanced sexual pleasure for the male partner. Some men who insist on dry sex regard \"wet\" women to be unchaste. Dry sex can be painful for men and women. Dry sex is common in Sub-Saharan Africa and it has also been reported in Suriname among Afro-Surinamese women.\n\nThe practice has been linked to the high incidence of HIV/AIDS infection in South Africa. The practice is regarded as increasing the risk of transmitting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) for both partners, including HIV in a number of ways. Increased friction during intercourse can cause lacerations in vaginal tissue. Drying the vagina also removes the natural antiseptic lactobacilli which combat sexually transmitted diseases. Furthermore, dry sex increases the risk that a condom will break because of the increased friction. It may also result in vaginal inflammation and/or traumatic lesions which in turn may increase the transmission of STDs in other ways.\n\n"}

First licensed on March 18, 1922, it was one of the United States' first broadcasting stations.\n\nThe station airs a news/talk radio format that is simulcast on WBT-FM 99.3 and the HD2 digital sub-channel of co-owned 107.9 WLNK. WBT is owned by Entercom, one of the largest radio stations operators in America. Studios and offices are at One Julian Price Place on West Morehead Street, just west of Uptown Charlotte, co-located with the city's CBS television affiliate, WBTV, which is currently owned by Gray Television but at one time had common ownership with WBT Radio.\n\nWBT broadcasts full-time with 50,000-watts at 1110 kHz, as a Class A clear-channel station. Its transmitter is located in the southern part of the city off Nations Ford Road. During daylight hours it uses a non-directional antenna and is audible in a significant portion of the Carolinas, including cities as far away as Greensboro and Winston-Salem, North Carolina and Spartanburg and Columbia, South Carolina. At night it uses a directional antenna that limits its signal toward the west, in order to avoid interfering with KFAB in Omaha, Nebraska, the other Class A station on the frequency. Even with this restriction, its nighttime signal reaches most of the eastern half of North America. For many years, WBT boasted that it could be heard \"from Maine to Miami\" at night.\n\nOn weekdays, WBT airs mostly locally produced talk shows and offer podcasts of these shows on its official website. News, weather, and traffic reports are heard each half-hour.\n\nWBT begins each weekday with a four-hour morning drive time newscast hosted by Bo Thompson called \"WBT's Morning News\". Thompson and former North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory host a one-hour talk show immediately following the morning news. Vince Coakley, former WSOC-TV news anchor and North Carolina Congressional candidate, hosts from 10 am to noon. Brett Winterble hosts the late afternoon show and a one-hour newsmagazine called \"Charlotte at Six\" is anchored by Mark Garrison. The rest of the weekday schedule is made up of nationally syndicated hosts including Rush Limbaugh, Dave Ramsey, Mark Levin and \"Coast to Coast AM with George Noory\".\n\nWeekends feature shows on money, health, real estate, technology, cars and home repair, some of which are paid brokered programming. Syndicated shows include \"The Tech Guy with Leo Laporte\" and \"Cigar Dave\". Some hours begin with ABC Radio News.\n\nSince 2005, WBT has been the flagship station of the Carolina Panthers football team. It also was the Panthers' radio flagship from the team's 1995 inception until 1999. WBT was the flagship of the Charlotte Hornets from the team's debut in 1988 until the team moved to New Orleans in 2002. From 1991 to 1995, WBT was the Charlotte-area home of the Duke Blue Devils. It was also the Charlotte home of the University of North Carolina Tar Heels from 1977 to 1991 and again from 1995 to 2006. The Tar Heels returned to WBT in 2012.\n\nAs with many early radio stations, there is a limited amount of information about WBT's origins. Wesley Wallace's 1962 review of the history of North Carolina radio reported being frustrated \"by the absence or inaccessibility\" of information, noting that \"Broadcasters have been too busy acting in the present tense to take much thought of the past; hence they have discarded much of the memorabilia of broadcasting's earlier days.\"\n\nWBT was first licensed as a broadcasting station on March 18, 1922. However, the station traces its history to earlier broadcasts made in a joint effort by Fred Laxton, associated with General Electric, Earle J. Gluck, a Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company engineer and Frank Bunker, a Southern Bell Telephone Company employee. During World War I a ban was in place that suspended amateur radio transmissions. In late 1919 the ban was lifted, and all three became licensed radio amateurs. Most amateurs at this time used spark transmitters that could only transmit the dots-and-dashes of Morse code, however, Laxton managed to acquire a scarce vacuum tube from General Electric, which made audio transmissions possible.\n\nThe three decided to set up a transmitter in an abandoned chicken coup located behind Laxton's home at 2462 Mecklenburg Avenue, with a microphone line running to the home's living room. Laxton's daughter later remembered being drafted as a child to repeatedly count into the microphone for the early test transmissions. These initial transmissions eventually were expanded into the playing of phonograph records, which resulted in enough interest from local amateurs, as well as technically advanced members of the general public, that a regular schedule of broadcasts was established. In late 1920 the station was issued an Experimental radio station license to Fred Laxton, located at his home address, with the call sign 4XD.\n\nThe growing interest in radio led to the December 1921 founding of the Southern Radio Corporation, located in the Realty Building, in order to sell radio parts and equipment. The initial officers were Fred Laxton, president, J. B. Marshall, vice president, and Frank Bunker, commercial engineer in charge. It was also announced at this time that the company planned to installed a transmitter and rooftop antenna at the Realty building, to be used for \"sending out concerts, big speeches and other entertainment to those who own home outfits within a radius of 200 miles from Charlotte\".\n\nInitially there were no specific standards in the United States for radio stations making transmissions intended for the general public, and numerous stations under various classifications made entertainment broadcasts. However, effective December 1, 1921, the Department of Commerce, the regulators of radio at this time, adopted a regulation that formally created a broadcasting station category, and stations were now required to hold a Limited Commercial license authorizing operation on wavelengths of 360 meters for \"entertainment\" broadcasts or 485 meters for \"market and weather reports\" (833 and 619 kHz).\n\nThe Southern Radio Corporation was issued a \"provisional\" broadcasting station license, with the randomly assigned call letters WBT, on March 18, 1922, which authorized broadcasts on the 360 meter entertainment wavelength. WBT made its first broadcast four days later on March 22. The next day's \"Charlotte Observer\" reported that: \"Erected by the Southern Radio corporation of this city and attached to the Realty building, this station, officially designated as WBT, operating on a 360 meter wavelength, this station will arrange musical concerts, addresses on various subjects and will give nightly programs for the benefit of approximately 20,000 receiving stations within a hearing radius. The first program was given last night and several stations in this section are known to have picked up the Victrola music broadcasted.\" This article further described the \"wireless telephone broadcasting station\" as \"the first station that has been erected and put in active operating condition in the Carolinas. A station has been erected at State college in West Raleigh, but it did not work properly and it will probably be a few weeks before it will be in a position to do any broadcasting.\" On April 11, following a successful inspection by the Fourth Radio District inspector, Walter Van Nostrand, Jr on April 4, 1922, the license's \"provisional\" qualifier was removed.\"\n\nIn October 1925, Fred Laxton sold the Southern Radio Corporation to the Carolina States Electric Company for approximately $50,000, while retaining control of WBT. However, the next month the station was sold to Charlotte Buick automobile dealer C. C. Coddington, who would promote both the radio station and his auto dealership with the slogan \"Watch Buicks Travel\". The station was moved to the top of the Coddington building, although Coddington later moved the transmitter site to farm property he owned on Nations Ford Road in south Charlotte, where it remains today.\n\nOn November 11, 1928, under the provisions of the Federal Radio Commission's General Order 40, WBT was assigned to a \"clear channel\" frequency of 1080 kHz, which gave it exclusive national nighttime use of that frequency. In 1929 C.C. Coddington sold WBT to the two-year-old CBS Radio Network. In subsequent years a series of power increases raised the station's from 5,000 watts to the maximum permitted, 50,000 watts. The 50,000 watt transmitter was dedicated on August 12, 1932.\n\nIn 1925, Freeman Gosden and Charlie Correll started a comedy show carried by WBT that was a forerunner to \"Amos and Andy\". Russ Hodges, later famous as the radio voice of the New York/San Francisco Giants, was sports editor of WBT for a time in the late 1930s, leaving in 1941 for Washington, D.C.\n\nDuring the Golden Age of Radio, WBT carried the CBS schedule of dramas, comedies, news, sports, soap operas, game shows and big band broadcasts to listeners in the Carolinas and at night, around the Southern United States. One musical program was \"Arthur Smith and the Crackerjacks\". Smith, best known for writing the song that became the \"Deliverance\" theme \"Dueling Banjos\", went to work at WBT at age 20 at the invitation of station manager Charles Crutchfield. He played guitar and fiddle for musical programs on WBT before getting his own show. Crutchfield believed that Charlotte, not Nashville, could have ended up being the country music capital because of the station's early \"Briarhoppers\" and \"Carolina Hayride\" shows, which may have inspired \"The Grand Ole Opry\".\n\nIn March 1941, as part of the implementation of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement, WBT was shifted to 1110 kHz, where it has been ever since. During the previous November 11, 1928 frequency reassignments, two midwestern stations, WBBM in Chicago and KFAB in Omaha, Nebraska, were placed on the same frequency, 780 kHz, which meant they had to synchronize their programming during nighttime hours. In order to eliminate this restriction, in 1944 a reassignment plan was announced that moved KFAB to 1110 kHz, which in turn required WBT to start operating with a directional antenna at night, to limit its signal toward KFAB. In order to mitigate the nighttime coverage loss, in July 1947 a 1,000 watt \"booster\" transmitter, located five miles northeast of Shelby, North Carolina, was authorized \"for benefit of nighttime listeners west of Charlotte\". (Use of the booster transmitter ended sometime in the early 1960s.)\n\nNew FCC regulations forced CBS to sell WBT when the network reached the maximum number of stations it could own. In 1945, it was acquired by the Jefferson Standard Life Insurance Company, forerunner of Jefferson-Pilot, and became its flagship station. After the sale, it remained a CBS affiliate. In 1947, an FM sister station at 99.9 MHz was put on the air. But that WBT-FM was discontinued in the mid-1950s and is not same as today's WBT-FM 99.3, which first went on the air in 1969 as WCMJ, owned by the York-Clover Broadcasting Company. In 1949, Jefferson Standard signed on Charlotte's first television station, WBTV.\n\nGrady Cole was WBT morning host for 32 years, replaced in 1961 by Ty Boyd, who hosted the morning show until 1973, playing such artists as Duke Ellington, Peggy Lee and Petula Clark. Then he moved to WBTV to host television shows. He returned to WBT in 2008 to co-host the morning show while its regular hosts took time off.\n\nWBT was the number one station in Charlotte for many years. Among its employees were Charles Kuralt and Nelson Benton. But by 1970, WBT was down to number nine in the ratings, and national advertisers wanted ratings to improve. Jefferson Standard did not like the idea of change, but the company brought in researchers to show what programming Charlotte wanted. WBT let go 28 staffers and spent $200,000 on changes that included new studios. It also canceled many programs that advertisers supported but which didn't attract enough listeners.\n\nOn March 15, 1971, WBT switched to adult contemporary music during the day. Rob Hunter and H. A. Thompson were new DJs. Bob Lacey started at WBT in 1972 with a nighttime talk show \"Lacey Listens\". Two years later, WBT had reached number one again, reaching the highest Arbitron numbers on record to this day. Around the same time, the station dropped its longtime affiliation with the CBS Radio Network and joined ABC Radio. WBT won \"Billboard\" adult contemporary station of the year in 1976 and 1978. In 1979, \"Hello Henry\" Boggan began his nighttime talk show.\n\nIn 1978, Marty Lambert became Jeff Pilot, the traffic reporter for WBT and WBCY. Lambert became assistant program director and music director in 1982.\n\nWBT dropped its ABC affiliation in favor of NBC Radio in 1987. Talk programming continued to increase on WBT through the 1980s, mostly at night. Larry King, on the Mutual Broadcasting System, moved from WSOC and stayed on WBT until 1987, when WBT decided its new NBC affiliation needed to take priority over other networks. Bruce Williams' syndicated financial advice show, part of the \"NBC Talknet\" block, replaced King. WBT expanded \"Hello Henry\" and its \"Sports Huddle\" program.\n\nFor their entire 14 years in Charlotte, starting with the inaugural 1988–89 season, WBT aired the games of the original NBA Hornets franchise.\n\nWBT made changes to its format on December 10, 1990, hoping to attract more women. The station dropped James K. Flynn, Thompson and Tom Desio, generating numerous protests. Don Russell had hosted \"Russell & Flynn\" in the morning; the show was renamed \"Russell & Friends\". John Hancock became midday host, and WBTV personalities Mike and Barbara McKay began an afternoon program. Boggan, whose show had run in the afternoon, returned to his evening slot, replacing Desio, but was sometimes pre-empted by sports programs. WBT also switched its network affiliation from NBC back to CBS on December 21\n\nOn September 3, 1991, WBT dropped the McKays and became the 400th station to air \"The Rush Limbaugh Show\", which had already been heard in the Charlotte area on WADA in Shelby, WSIC in Statesville and WHKY in Hickory.\n\nIn 1995, Jefferson-Pilot bought WBZK-FM 99.3 in Chester, South Carolina to provide a simulcast signal that better served the western part of the market at night. At this time the FM station's call letters were changed to WBT-FM. That same year the station began airing games of the NFL Carolina Panthers inaugural season until 1999, returning as the team's flagship station in 2005.\n\nLincoln Financial Group bought Jefferson-Pilot in 2006. The merged company retained Jefferson-Pilot's broadcasting division, renaming it Lincoln Financial Media. In January 2008, Lincoln Financial sold WBT-AM/FM and WLNK to Greater Media of Braintree, Massachusetts. Lincoln-Financial then sold its three television stations, including WBTV, to Raycom Media—thus breaking up Charlotte's last heritage radio/television cluster. Greater Media had long wanted to expand into the fast-growing Charlotte market; its owner had wanted to buy WBT after hearing its signal at night on Cape Cod.\n\nAlso in 2006, WBT lost the North Carolina Tar Heels to all sports WFNZ. Sales director Steve Sklenar said the games pre-empted John Hancock's show and, during the ACC Tournament, Rush Limbaugh. WBT wanted the games, Sklenar said, but the pre-emptions cost the station advertising revenue. The Tar Heels had aired on WBT from 1977 to 1991, and returned to the station in 1995. According to Cullie Tarleton, who ran the station at that time, putting the Tar Heels on WBT was largely the idea of longtime coach Dean Smith, who wanted to tell recruits from New England that their parents would be able to listen to the games.\n\nOn May 5, 2012, WBT signed back on with the Tar Heel Sports Network to be Charlotte's main carrier of the Tar Heels. After WRFX carried night basketball games for several years, WNOW-FM took over up until this year. With this switch back, games can now be heard all up and down the Eastern Seaboard at night, as WBT's clear channel signal can be heard from \"Maine to Miami\".\n\nOn June 8, 2012, WBT announced that \"The Brad and Britt Show\", hosted by Brad Krantz and Britt Whitmire of WPTK in Raleigh, would be taking over the afternoon slot from Vince Coakley effective July 2. Krantz and libertarian Richard Spires had a show on WBT prior to 2003. In June 2013, the show moved to 6pm-9pm; Hancock would take over the 3pm-6pm afternoon drive slot.\n\nOn November 15, 2013, both WBT and WBTV were dedicated with a North Carolina historic marker at the corner of Tryon Street and Third Street. The Wilder Building, which was demolished in 1983, hosted the WBT's studios from 1924–1955. The sign reads \"WBT/WBTV – Oldest broadcast stations in North Carolina established 1922. WBT radio long hosted live country music. WBTV sign-on, July 15, 1949. Studios here until 1955.\"\n\nOn March 3, 2014, WBT again dropped CBS News and returned to ABC News. In making the move, the station cited the stronger resources ABC's reporters provides to WBT's local programming compared to CBS and Fox News Radio.\n\nOn July 19, 2016, Greater Media announced that it would merge with Beasley Media Group. Because Beasley already had the maximum number of stations in the Charlotte market with 5 FM's and 2 AM's, WBT-AM-FM and WLNK were spun off to a divestiture trust, eventually going to a permanent buyer. On October 18, 2016, Entercom announced that it would purchase WBT AM/FM and WLNK, plus WFNZ. Upon the completion of the Greater/Beasley merger on November 1, Entercom began operating the stations via a time brokerage agreement, which lasted until the sale was consummated on January 6, 2017.\n\nWBT's diamond-shaped antennas account for three of only eight operational Blaw-Knox towers in the United States. In the morning hours of September 22, 1989, the high winds from Hurricane Hugo severely damaged two of WBT's towers and nearly killed then Chief Engineer, Bob White. The FCC approved WBT to operate at 25,000 watts with a non-directional pattern for the next year while the two damaged towers were rebuilt.\nA single tower radiates the transmitter's full power during the day. The station's daytime coverage area is not as large as that of other 50,000-watt stations due to the area's poor ground conductivity. Even so, it provides grade B coverage as far as the fringes of the Columbia, Upstate and Piedmont Triad areas. Under the right conditions, it can be heard as far east as Fayetteville and as far north as Durham.\n\nAt night, power is fed to all three towers in a directional pattern to protect KFAB in Omaha, Nebraska, which also operates on 1110 AM and employs a similar directional pattern that protects WBT to the east. Even though WBT must direct its signal north-south as a result, it can still be heard in parts of 22 states (including much of the country east of the Mississippi River) as well as portions of Ontario and Quebec with a good radio. It can also be heard in some Caribbean islands.\n\nDespite its clear-channel status, WBT was long plagued by marginal nighttime coverage in some parts of the Charlotte area, especially the western portion, due to the need to adjust its signal at sundown to protect KFAB. To solve this problem, WBT operated a synchronous booster signal in Shelby from 1947 to the early 1960s. In 1995, then-owner Jefferson-Pilot bought WBZK in Chester, South Carolina, located 40 miles southwest of Charlotte, to provide a better signal to the western part of the market at night. WBZK's calls became WBT-FM. In 2012, sister station WLNK added a simulcast of WBT on its HD2 digital subcarrier.\n\nPast hosts include \"Hello Henry\" Boggan, Ty Boyd, Grady Cole, Mike Collins, \"Rockin'\" Ray Gooding, Bob Lacey, Jason Lewis and H.A. Thompson.\n\nDon Russell is the station's longest-tenured personality, having worked at the station on six separate occasions since the 1970s. He currently hosts the weekend version of \"Charlotte's Morning News\".\n\nFrom 2009 until March 31, 2011, Pete Kaliner hosted a local program in the 9-midnight slot, but was fired in a cost-cutting move by Greater Media. Neal Boortz's syndicated show was heard on tape delay from 9pm-1am; however, this was a temporary move as nationally syndicated host and former WBT personality Jason Lewis began to be heard on the station from 9-midnight (on a three-hour delay from his live broadcast) beginning in May 2011.\n\nNearly two months after Kaliner's departure, Tara Servatius' contract was not renewed; Doug Kellett and Wayne Powers filled the 3-6pm slot on an interim basis while the station searched for a replacement. On June 22, 2011, former WSOC-TV lead anchor Vince Coakley, who had done fill-in work at WBT before, was named Servatius' replacement in the 3-6pm timeslot. Coakley left after a little over a year and was replaced on July 2, 2012 by Brad Krantz (a former WBT host) and Britt Whitmire, formerly of WZTK. Krantz and Whitmire, in turn, were fired by the station on June 11, 2014, and were replaced by John Hancock, who moved up from evenings (6-9pm) and a 6pm local news hour hosted by Mark Garrison and a local show with former WFNZ host Brett Jensen from 7pm-10pm. Coakley, who became the Republican candidate for North Carolina's 12th District U.S. House seat in 2012, returned to the station in 2017.\n\nIn December 2012, morning co-host Stacey Simms left Charlotte's Morning News to spend more time with her family. On January 14, 2013, Charlotte native Doc Washburn, most recently a morning host at WFLF-FM in Panama City Beach, Florida, debuted in the 9pm-1am slot, bringing local talk to the timeslot for the first time in nearly two years, replacing Lewis and the retired Boortz. The show would be replaced by the nationally syndicated America Now with Andy Dean in May 2013; Washburn remained with the station as a fill-in host.\n\nFollowing Entercom's takeover of WBT via LMA on October 31, 2016, Keith Larson, the station's longtime 9am-noon host, was fired. The station ran a rotation of fill-in hosts while searching for his replacement before hiring former WPTF Raleigh morning host Scott Fitzgerald for the slot. Scott was released in November 2017.\n\n\n"}

Located in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, the park is managed by the National Park Service. The GNMP properties include most of the Gettysburg Battlefield, many of the battle's support areas during the battle (e.g., reserve, supply, & hospital locations), and several other non-battle areas associated with the battle's \"aftermath and commemoration\", including the Gettysburg National Cemetery. Many of the park's 43,000 American Civil War artifacts are displayed in the Gettysburg Museum and Visitor Center.\n\nThe park has more wooded land than in 1863, and the National Park Service has an ongoing program to restore portions of the battlefield to their historical non-wooded conditions, as well as to replant historic orchards and woodlots that are now missing. In addition, the NPS is restoring native plants to meadows and edges of roads, to encourage habitat as well as provide for historic landscape. There are also considerably more roads and facilities for the benefit of tourists visiting the battlefield park.\n\nAttendance in 2018 was 950,000 a decline of 86% since 1970. The five major Civil War battlefield parks operated by the National Park Service (Gettysburg, Antietam, Shiloh, Chickamauga/Chattanooga and Vicksburg) had a combined 3.1 million visitors in 2018, down 70% from 10.2 million in 1970.\n\nThe park was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966.\n\nThe 1864 Gettysburg Battlefield Memorial Association and later veteran's associations acquired land for memorials and preservation (e.g., the 72nd Pennsylvania Infantry Monument tract with the statuary memorial depicted on the 2011 America the Beautiful Quarter dollar). Federal acquisition of land that would become the 1895 national park began on June 7, 1893, with 9 monument tracts of each and a larger 10th lot of from the Association, as well as from Samuel M Bushman. In addition to land purchases, federal eminent domain takings include the Gettysburg Electric Railway right-of-ways in 1917 (cf. 1896 United States v. Gettysburg Electric Ry. Co.). Donated land included 160 acres from the 1959 Gettysburg Battlefield Preservation Association and from the W. Alton Jones Foundation. The Gettysburg Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit philanthropic, educational organization that operates in partnership with the National Park Service to preserve Gettysburg National Military Park and the Eisenhower National Historic Site, and to educate the public about their significance. (e.g., the Foundation raised funds for and built the new Museum and Visitor Center, opened in 2008, and secured funds for the creation of a new cannon shop that daily preserves the nearly 400 cannons representing actual artillery lines on the battlefield. In addition, the Gettysburg Foundation has provided approximately $20 million in direct support of the National Park Service just since 2009. The Visitor Center houses the Gettysburg Museum of the American Civil War and the 19th century, painting in the round, the Gettysburg Cyclorama)\n\nThe park officially came under federal control on February 11, 1895 with a piece of legislation titled, “An Act To establish a national military park at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.” This piece of legislation officially allowed the transfer of the deed for the park to go from the Gettysburg Battlefield Memorial National Park Association, to the Secretary of War.\n\nIn February 2009, The David Wills House where Lincoln completed his Gettysburg Address was added to the national park by Public Law 106-290 and is operated by Gettysburg Foundation. In 2010, an effort to expand the amount of the federally-owned GNMP land failed in Congress.\n\nThe Park has been a highly symbolic venue for memorials and remembrance. On November 19, 1963 a parade and ceremony was held in Gettysburg commemorating the centennial of President Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, given less than five months after the Battle of Gettysburg. The actor, Raymond H. Massey, playing the role of President Lincoln arrived by 1860's period steam train at the Gettysburg station. He rode, in the parade as did Lincoln, on horseback to the National cemetery where actor Massey gave the President's famous address (this time for brevity, Edward Everett's preceding two hour speech was not read). The parade followed the same route that President Lincoln and Gov. Andrew G. Curtin took 100 years before. Former President Dwight D. Eisenhower—who lived nearby—was there accompanied by Gov. William W. Scranton. The attendance at the 1963 commemoration was lower than the 20,000 to 30,000 persons who attended the original address by President Lincoln in 1863. Thousands of photographers attended the 1963 event while U.S. Air Force aircraft passed overhead. Also attending the event were the 28th Division of the Pennsylvania National Guard headed by Maj. Gen. Henry F. Fluck, the U.S. Marine Band, and the 3rd Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard) of the U.S. Army. The parade ended at the rear entrance into the Gettysburg National Cemetery.\n\nThe Gettysburg National Military Park is administered in the North Atlantic - Appalachian region, also known as the Northeast region.\n\nFormer and Current Superintendents of the Gettysburg National Military Park.\n\n\nAs the Gettysburg National Military Park increases in popularity it has run into ecological changes caused by this popularity and also natural causes.\n\nThere are an estimated annual 2 million people visiting the park a year, and with this large influx of visitors concerns have arisen on its effects on the environment. Natural areas like wooded areas, thickets and wetlands, have been stressed by pollution caused by traffic, and the issue of invasive species threatening the ecology of the park.\n\n\nAll of the following are filed under Gettysburg, Adams County, Pennsylvania:\n"}

They are high on the cliffs of the west Mutou Valley under the Flaming Mountains, and most of the surviving caves date from the West Uyghur kingdom around the 10th to 13th centuries.\n\nThere are 77 rock-cut caves at the site. Most have rectangular spaces with rounded arch ceilings often divided into four sections, each with a mural of the Buddha. The effect is of entire ceiling covers with hundreds of Buddha murals. Some murals show a large Buddha surrounded by other figures, including Turks, Indians and Europeans. The quality of the murals vary with some being artistically naive while others are masterpieces of religious art. The murals that best represent the Bezeklik Thousand Buddha Caves are the large-sized murals, which were given the name the \"Praṇidhi Scene\", paintings depicting Sakyamuni’s \"promise\" or \"praṇidhi\" from his past life.\n\nProfessor James A. Millward described the original Uyghurs as physically Mongoloid, giving as an example the images in Bezeklik at temple 9 of the Uyghur patrons, until they began to mix with the Tarim Basin's original Indo-European Tocharian inhabitants. Buddhist Uyghurs created the Bezeklik murals. However, Peter B. Golden writes that the Uyghurs not only adopted the writing system and religious faiths of the Indo-European Sogdians, such as Manichaeism, Buddhism, and Christianity, but also looked to the Sogdians as \"mentors\" while gradually replacing them in their roles as Silk Road traders and purveyors of culture. Indeed, Sogdians wearing silk robes are seen in the \"praṇidhi\" scenes of Bezeklik murals, particularly Scene 6 from Temple 9 showing . The paintings of Bezeklik, while having a small amount of Indian influence, is primarily influenced by Chinese and Iranian styles, particularly Sasanian Persian landscape painting. Albert von Le Coq was the first to study the murals and published his findings in 1913. He noted how in one of the Caucasian-looking figures with green eyes, wearing a green fur-trimmed coat and presenting a bowl with what he assumed were bags of gold dust, wore a hat that he found reminiscent of the headgear of Sasanian Persian princes.\n\nThe Buddhist Uyghurs of the Kingdom of Qocho and Turfan were converted to Islam by conquest during a ghazat (holy war) at the hands of the Muslim Chagatai Khanate ruler Khizr Khoja (r. 1389-1399). After being converted to Islam, the descendants of the previously Buddhist Uyghurs in Turfan failed to retain memory of their ancestral legacy and falsely believed that the \"infidel Kalmuks\" (Dzungars) were the ones who built Buddhist monuments in their area.\n\nThe murals at Bezeklik have suffered considerable damage. Many of the temples were damaged by local Muslim population whose religion proscribed figurative images of sentient beings; all statues were destroyed, some paintings defaced and others smeared with mud, the eyes and mouths were often gouged out due to the local belief that the figures may otherwise come to life at night. Michael Dillon considered Bezeklik's \"Thousand Buddha Caves\" are an example of the religiously motivated iconoclasm against depiction of religious and human figures. Pieces of murals were also broken off for use as fertilizer by the locals. During the late nineteen and early twentieth century, European and Japanese explorers found intact murals buried in sand, and many were removed and dispersed around the world. Some of the best preserved murals were removed by German explorer Albert von Le Coq and sent to Germany. Large pieces such as those showing Praṇidhi scene were permanently fixed to walls in the Museum of Ethnology in Berlin. During the Second World War they could not be removed for safekeeping, and were thus destroyed when the museum was caught in the bombing of Berlin by the Allies. Other pieces may now be found in various museums around the world, such as the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Tokyo National Museum in Japan, the British Museum in London, and the national museums of Korea and India.\n\nA digital recreation of the Bezeklik murals removed by explorers was shown in Japan.\n\n\n\n"}

Associated minerals include prehnite, danburite, babingtonite, epidote, native copper, calcite, quartz and zeolites. It is common in the copper deposits of the Lake Superior region of Michigan. It occurs as a secondary mineral in mafic igneous rocks often filling vesicles along with zeolites in basalt. Unlike most localities throughout the world, the occurrence of datolite in the Lake Superior region is usually fine grained in texture and possesses colored banding. Much of the coloration is due to the inclusion of copper or associated minerals in progressive stages of hydrothermal precipitation.\n\n\"Botryolite\" is a botryoidal form of datolite.\n\n"}

The mineral occurs mainly in metamorphosed clay-rich sediments and felsic igneous rocks. It has the general formula AMSiO[OH], where the A sites can contain large cations such as Ca, Sr, and rare-earth elements, and the M sites admit Al, Fe, Mn, Fe, or Mg among others. However, a large amount of additional elements, including Th, U, Be, Zr, P, Ba, Cr and others may be present in the mineral. The International Mineralogical Association lists four minerals in the allanite group, each recognized as a unique mineral: allanite-(Ce), allanite-(La), allanite-(Nd), and allanite-(Y), depending on the dominant rare earth present: cerium, lanthanum, neodymium or yttrium.\nAllanite contains up to 20% rare-earth elements and is a valuable source of them. The inclusion of thorium and other radioactive elements in allanite results in some interesting phenomena. Allanite often has a pleochroic halo of radiation damage in the minerals immediately adjacent. Also highly radioactive grains of allanite often have their structure disrupted or are \"metamict\". The age of allanite grains that have not been destroyed by radiation can be determined using different techniques.\n\nAllanite is usually black in color, but can be brown or brown-violet. It is often coated with a yellow-brown alteration product, likely limonite. It crystallizes in the monoclinic system and forms prismatic crystals. It has a Mohs hardness of 5.5–6 and a specific gravity of 3.5–4.2. It is also pyrognomic, meaning that it becomes incandescent at a relatively low temperature of about 95 °C.\n\nIt was discovered in 1810 and named for the Scottish mineralogist Thomas Allan (1777–1833). The type locality is Aluk Island, Greenland, where it was first discovered by Karl Ludwig Giesecke.\n\n"}

Taliaferro\n\nWalter Robertson Taliaferro (September 9, 1880 – October 11, 1915) was a pioneer aviator in the U.S. Army who died in a flying accident. After his first and last \"loop the loop\" in a Curtiss tractor biplane, the plane suddenly dove into San Diego Bay, killing him instantly.\n\nTaliaferro was born on September 9, 1880, in Campbell County, Kentucky. He served as an enlisted man in the artillery for seven years before being commissioned as an officer in the 21st infantry in 1908. He did surveying work in the Philippine Islands and in 1913 was detailed to the Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps, for pilot training.\n\nTaliaferro was married to Leicester Sehon. He died on October 11, 1915, in San Diego. He was buried in San Diego at the Mount Hope Cemetery.\n\nCamp Taliaferro in Texas was named in his honor, as was Camp Taliaferro in San Diego.\n\nTaliaferro made an aviation distance record, flying 220 miles in about 3.5 hours. With Lieutenant Joseph E. Carberry, he set a new American altitude record for a plane carrying two persons of about 7,000 feet, although it was only a month until Carberry and another reached 11,690 feet. Taliaferro also achieved a flight endurance record in September 1915 of 9 hours and 45 minutes, before he ran out of fuel.\n\nThe \"San Diego Union\" on October 12, 1915, wrote:\n\n\"Cause of Taliaferro's Death Plunge Mystery to Airmen. Tragic Fall Into Bay Follows Loop in Sky by Daring Birdman.\" \n\nLieutenant Walter R. Taliaferro, junior military aviator and holder of the American record for sustained flight for pilot alone, was killed at 11:15 o'clock yesterday morning when he fell from a height of 200 feet in military biplane No. 30. He fell into the bay in forty feet of water at a point about three-quarters of a mile due west of the municipal pier and only a few hundred feet from where Lieutenant Henry Post was killed when he plunged from a height of 100 feet in his wrecked biplane February 9, 1914. Although the military tractor in which Lieutenant Taliaferro met his untimely death remained on the surface of the bay, a crumpled mass of wreckage, for fully three minutes after it struck, both pilot and machine found a resting place on the bay bottom several minutes before a rescue boat arrived on the spot and up to an early hour this morning, neither the dead army aviator nor the biplane had been brought to the surface. The fatal aeroplane accident, the first that has occurred to United States army aviators stationed at the military aerodrome at North Island in twenty months, came as the climax to a series of looping the loop performed by Lieut. Douglas P. Netherwood, Walter G. Kliner and Walter Taliaferro. Only a few minutes previous to the fatal accident Lieutenant Netherwood and Kiner, each piloting No. 30, looped the loop. Lieutenant Taliaferro ascended at 11 o'clock and after circling for fifteen minutes attempted the first and last loop he ever made. He succeeded in his achievement and was in the act of making a long sweeping volplane to the hangars when the big military tractor was seen to plunge like a plummet towards the bay. The sound of the impact of the machine with the water could be plainly heard from a quarter of a mile. The wings were seen to crumple and then the machine slowly sank beneath the waters of the bay, the tail being the last to disappear. That Lieutenant Taliaferro either was instantly killed by the shock of impact or else rendered unconscious by his rapid fall, is the belief of Army aviators. They based their opinion on the fact that the aviator made no attempt to unbuckle the strap which held him in securely to his seat in the enclosed body of the tractor, and to scramble to temporary safety on top of the upper wing. The machine struck while the engine was still running, a section of the propeller, which struck the water at the same instant as the left end of the upper wing, being sheared off. It is believed that the engine became unseated at the moment of impact and that Lieutenant Taliaferro was crushed between the heavy motor and the back of the enclosed body. The exact cause of death, however, will not be known until the body is recovered. A fleet of steam launches from the cruiser San Diego soon were on the scene of the accident, followed by the signal corps patrol launch Pronto, which, owing to someone's failure to fill the fuel tanks, was unable to leave the North Island dock until too late to render assistance to the stricken aviator. Dragging operation began at 11:30 o'clock and continued without interruption all day and night. First Class Gunner's Mate J. Seagraves, R. Jackson, F.E. Williams and I.F. Krantz each took turns during the afternoon in attempting to locate the wrecked aeroplane by walking along the bay bottom while equipped in diving suits. Just before sunset, Gunner's Mate Krantz came to the surface with a piece of the aeroplane's wing and propeller and at one time grappling hooks obtained an insecure hold. The swift tide, however, dashed all hopes by swinging the aeroplane down the channel before the officers could be sent down to attach a line. Aided only by the light of the stars a squad of twenty-five blue-jackets form the cruiser San Diego, under the command of Lieut. S. H. Lawton, continued drag operations throughout the night. One of the first persons to reach the scene of the accident was Barry Kelly, member of the San Diego Rowing Club, who was rowing on the bay in a shell. Barry picked up a part of the propeller blade, which he found floating in the water over the spot where the tractor went down. Later in the day he turned it over to Capt. Arthur Cowan, head of the signal corps aviation school. The piece evidently was the one that was sheared off when the biplane first struck the water. E.R. Watson, a member of the board of education and his nephew Miles Strafton, were eyewitnesses of the fatal accident. \"We had been following the movements of the aeroplane for several minutes\", said Watson. \"It seemed to be flying along nicely until it suddenly pitched forward and plunged toward the bay, striking near beacon No. 10. When the aeroplane struck, a sharp sound like the firing of a gun occurred. If Lieutenant Taliaferro was not killed by the fall, I believe he might have been saved, if a fast motor boat had started from the station camp as soon as the machine hit the water.\" Officer Harold Reams of the San Diego police department was aboard the cruiser San Diego and saw Lieutenant Taliaferro fall. He bore out the statements of other witnesses that a speedy motorboat probably would have saved Lieutenant Taliaferro or at any rate prevented him from going into a watery grave. \"I can give no explanation of the accident until the machine is recovered\", said Captain Cowan, head of the signal corps aviation school. \"Lieutenant Taliaferro was one of the most skilled aviators in the army while No. 30 was one of the best aeroplanes we had on the school.\" Lieutenant Taliaferro was born in Kentucky on September 9, 1880. He served as a private, corporal and a sergeant in the one Hundred Tenth coast artillery from September 12, 1901, to September 8, 1908, reaching the grade of Second Lieutenant in the Twenty-first infantry August 2, 1908. He had been attached to the aeronautical branch of the army since the birth of aviation, as aviator and instructor. He had been in the air 195 hours since he attained the rank of junior military aviator, and had the distinction of making more flights than any two aviators in the United States army. Lieutenant Taliaferro's most notable achievement in the world of aviation was made September 17, 1914 when he broke the American sustained flight record for pilot alone by remaining aloft 9 hours and 11 minutes. He would have remained aloft fully two hours more on this record-breaking flight had not a break occurred in his gasoline supply, necessitating volplaning to the ground. The machine in which Lieutenant Taliaferro was killed was a Curtiss military tractor, equipped with a 95 horsepower engine. It as specially equipped for looping the loop. Lieutenant Taliaferro completed the fortieth loop made by the machine when he fell to his death yesterday. Thirty of the loops attributed to tractor No. 30 were made by Sergeant William Ocker and Corporal Albert Smith on September 24 last. Lieutenant Taliaferro was married to Miss Leicester Sehon in this city April 29 last, the wedding being one of the big society events of the year. The widow was prostrated last night. Failure of navy divers to bring her husband's body to the surface was carefully kept from her. A brother, Lucien H. Taliaferro, is attached to the field artillery, stationed at Eagle Pass, Tex. He was notified of his brother's untimely death by the war department last night. Failure of the navy divers and patrol launches to find the wrecked plane is attributed to the fast ebbing tide running between 11 and 12 o;clock yesterday. Oil floating on the surface of the bay pointed out to rescuers where the aeroplane had sunk, but when divers were sent down, they reported that the machine was nowhere in sight. Grappling hooks attached to long hawsers were then towed back and forth across the channel by motor boats from the cruiser San Diego. Nightfall, however, saw their efforts unavailing and the work was pursued throughout the night with officers of the signal corps aviation school assisting in directing the work. Arrangements for the funeral of Lieutenant Taliaferro will be held in abeyance until the body is recovered.\nArnold, \"History of Rockwell Field\", 39, 50–51. quoted in Wallace R.

The village is about above sea level. In 1870-72, John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales described Shutford like this:\n\n\"SHUTFORD, a chapelry in Swalcliffe parish, Oxford; 5 miles W of Banbury r. station. It has a postal pillar-box under Banbury. Acres, 640. Real property, £2,840. Pop., 386. Houses, 98. The living is annexed to Swalcliffe. The church was repaired in 1841. There are chapels for Wesleyans and Primitive Methodists.\" \n\nThe name Shutford is derived from Scytta's Ford. In the fourteenth century the village was quite large. 20 people were assessed for tax in 1327. In 1377 there were 86. A fire in 1701 destroyed 24 houses. Some houses were rebuilt and modernised. In 1774 71 houses were recorded. In the Middle Ages there were 3 manors in Shutford. The manor house appears to have been built in the 16th century. In the Civil War, Viscount Saye and Sele supported the Parliamentarians. Plush \nand shag weaving was established in 1747 and became the village's main claim to fame.\n\nThe Church of England Parish Church of Saint Martin dates from the 12th century, when it was built in the transitional style between Norman and Early English Gothic. The north aisle, two bays of the arcade between this aisle and the nave, and the lower stage of the bell tower survive from this period. In the 13th century the north aisle was extended eastwards with an Early English Gothic third bay. In the 13th or 14th century the nave was rebuilt in the Decorated Gothic style. The south windows, porch and doorway, chancel arch and east window all date from this period. The Perpendicular Gothic windows of the north aisle and the upper stage of the bell tower were added later. The church building was restored in 1841. Since 1955 it has been a Grade II* listed building.\n\nShutford had a Methodist chapel. It is now a private house.\n\nIron Age barrows in the neighbouring villages of Sibford Gower and Swalcliffe, as well as the remains of an extensive Romano-British settlement, suggest that the area was inhabited from an early time. Shutford was not mentioned in the Domesday Book but was recorded as a settlement in the twelfth century under the name \"schiteford\".\n\nNearby Madmarston Hill, a late Iron Age hill camp, is the earliest known settlement in the (Banbury) hundred. It was probably occupied from the 2nd century B.C. until the 1st century A.D. when it appears to have been deserted, except for a brief period in the 4th century. The site was extensively excavated in 1957-58.\n\nShutford also lies close to what is now known as Swalcliffe Lea and was one of the largest Roman occupation sites in the county, covering 50 acres. The site was occupied throughout the Roman period and possibly earlier. The settlement which was quite large in the 1st century A.D. seems to have declined in the second but flourished again in the late third and fourth centuries. From the 14th to the 17th centuries a medieval hamlet called the Lea stood on the site all traces of which have now disappeared. The site was excavated by the Oxford University Archaeological Society in 1958. A villa in the field to the south east of the township site and immediately to the east of Lower Lea farmhouse was excavated in 2000.\n\nThe manor house was built in the last quarter of the 16th century and is the main house of the former East Shutford parish. Built by Sir Richard Fiennes, the MP for Banbury, between 1580 and 1600. A distinguishing feature is the tall\nstaircase tower. Although the Fiennes family never lived at the Manor it is said that just before the outbreak of the Civil War the Parliamentarian William Fiennes, Lord Saye and Sele drilled soldiers in the upper storey of the house (then one large room).\n\nIn 1928 the architect Walter Tapper added a western extension and northwest wing. The manor house was once owned by the Saye and Sele family, whose seat is now from Shutford at Broughton Castle.\n\nFrom about 1750 Shutford was part of the Banbury area's plush industry. Banbury was the centre for dyeing, marketing and distributing, but yarn was sent out to surrounding villages where it was woven. In 1841 two thirds of all plush weavers in the country lived in the Banbury area and, of these, about a quarter were in Shutford. By 1850 the industry in the rest of the Banbury area was declining under competition from power loom weavers in Coventry. However, Shutford remained in the plush trade by concentrating on the skilled manufacture of high quality plush for liveries, upholstery and furnishings. By 1910 the only handwoven livery plush manufacturer in the world, Wrench's, based in Shutford supplied plush for the coronation of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia in 1896, produced decorations at Windsor Castle for Queen Victoria and specially made liveries for royal courts all over Europe and for the embassies of China, Japan, Persia and the United States. Despite a disastrous fire at the factory in 1913, the industry was revived and enjoyed a degree of prosperity between the wars. After the Second World War, however, with supply, demand and labour problems, the owners decided to reluctantly sell up in 1948.\n\nFrom the collapse of the plush industry to the 1960s Shutford declined, losing its school, its public house, and for a time having no Vicar.\n\nProperty and street names such as Weavers Row, Weavers Cottage and The Weavers Shop give an indication of the village's illustrious past.\n\nSince this short period of economic decline, all of the derelict buildings have been rebuilt and restored and many new houses added to the village, predominantly built with traditional Hornton stone. One focus of the village is the George and Dragon free house pub and restaurant. Many successful small businesses now operate from the village. It has a cricket club and thriving community association which organises sports days, carol singing, fetes and concerts in St Martin's Church. Shutford also has a Women's Institute. The small Post Office in Ivy Lane closed in 2005, and Shutford is now served by nearby .\nSibford Gower post office.\n\n\n"}

After looking at sites in Dallas, Fort Worth, Waco, Austin, Wichita Falls and Midland, three sites were established in 1917 in the Fort Worth vicinity (known as the \"Flying Triangle.\"), those being Hicks Field (#1), Barron Field (#2), and Benbrook Field (#3).\n\nCanadians named the training complex Camp Taliaferro after Walter Taliaferro, a US aviator who had been killed in an accident. Camp Taliaferro was headquartered under the direction of the Air Service, United States Army, which had an administration center near what is now the Will Rodgers Memorial Center in Fort Worth, Texas.\n\nTaliafero Field No. 3 was used by the Royal Flying Corps from October 1917 to April 1918 as a training field for American and Canadian pilots. It was then turned over to the Air Service, United States Army. The Americans renamed the field Carruthers Field after Cadet W. K. Carruthers, who was killed at Hazelhurst Field, New York, when he was struck by a revolving propeller on 18 June 1917. At some point after July 1918 it was renamed Benbrook Field by the United States Army.\n\nThe Benbrook Field station area was located south of Mercedes Street in Benbrook. It occupied the area west of Winscott Road, being bordered on the west by Walnut Creek. A railroad spur connected with the Texas & Pacific line across Walnut Creek. Most of the 34 buildings and hangars were located in an area generally bounded by Mercedes Street on the north, Winscott Road on the east, Cozby North Street on the south, and Walnut Creek on the west.\n\nBenbrook was used as an aerial gunnery school for American & Canadian students. One particular Canadian aviator, Captain Vernon Castle, was already world-renowned as the famed dance team of Vernon & Irene Castle. Regrettably, he was killed in a plane crash at Benbrook Field during training exercises. Some witnesses believed that he deliberately crashed in order to avoid hitting another plane, and saved their lives. His burial was witnessed by thousands of mourners, who sadly watched the flagged draped casket pass in downtown Fort Worth. Even today, there is a street in Benbrook named in his honor.\n\nTraining units assigned to Benbrook Field:\n\nBenbrook Field was closed at the end of April, 1919 and the buildings dismantled. Following the closure, the land was purchased by William Monnig and was used as a dairy. Today, the entire area has been redeveloped into what is now the Benbrook Lakeside subdivision. Intermixed within the houses are small, broken, isolated concrete slabs, the remainders of wartime buildings and hangars. The last remaining building was an ammunition warehouse west of U.S. 377 that was demolished in 2004 to facilitate future commercial development. Today a Texas historical marker for the airfield is located north of Mercedes Street, across the street from the Church at Benbrook as a memorial to the fliers of Benbrook Field.\n\n"}

Welch grew up with his Aunt Sadie in Chester-le-Street, County Durham. After learning to play the guitar, he formed a Tyneside skiffle band called the Railroaders when he was fourteen. His Rutherford Grammar School friend Brian Rankin (later to be known as Hank Marvin) joined the group and they travelled to London in 1958 for the final of a talent competition. Although they did not win, they joined with members of other entrant bands and formed the Five Chesternuts with Pete Chester (born 1942), son of comedian Charlie Chester, on drums.\n\nOn moving to London, Bruce and Hank Marvin briefly operated as the Geordie Boys before enlisting in an outfit called the Drifters.\n\nIn September 1958 Welch and Marvin joined the Drifters, later to become the Shadows, as Cliff Richard's backing band. As well as success with the Shadows, Welch acted as producer for (among others) Richard and songwriter for his ex-fiancée, Olivia Newton-John. He also released a solo single, \"Please Mr. Please\", which was not commercially successful, though the song has been covered by several recording artists (most notably Newton-John, who would take it into the top 10 of the US pop and country charts in 1975).\n\nWelch wrote several number 1 hit singles for Richard and for the Shadows. Among tunes or songs written or co-written by Welch are the Shadows' hits \"Foot Tapper\", \"Theme for Young Lovers\", and \"The Rise and Fall of Flingel Bunt\", Marvin Welch & Farrar's \"Faithful\" and \"My Home Town\", and Cliff Richard hits \"Please Don't Tease\", \"In the Country\", \"Summer Holiday\", \"I Love You\" and \"I Could Easily Fall (In Love With You)\".\n\nHe was the musical consultant for the West End musical \"Buddy – The Buddy Holly Story\".\n\nAfter the Shadows disbanded in 1990, with Marvin deciding to tour with his own band, Welch's plans for his own tours did not fully materialise until 1998, when he formed Bruce Welch's Shadows (originally called 'Bruce Welch's Moonlight Shadows' – a name that was dropped after 1998). The group featured former Shadows bassist Alan Jones and keyboardist Cliff Hall, with Bob Watkins on drums. Phil Kelly and Barry Gibson (owner of Burns Guitars) shared lead guitar duties until Gibson's departure in 2000.\n\nIn 1998, he produced \"Shadowmania\", a one-day show comprising various Shadows tribute bands, with his own band topping the bill. Due to the event's success he presented it annually until 2012, missing only 2004 and 2009 due to tours with the reformed Shadows. At Shadowmania 2011 he included a 'Tribute to Jet Harris', who had died from cancer in March of that year. At Shadowmania 2012, Phil Kelly could not appear because of illness and was replaced by session guitarist-songwriter Daniel Martin, and Justin Daish, leader of The Shadowers (Jet Harris' final backing band).\n\nHe was appointed OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in the 2004 Birthday Honours list for services to music.\n\nWelch lives in Richmond, London.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was the U.S. correspondent for the French political-investigative weekly Bakchich, for which he also wrote a weekly column, and he was also the Contributing Editor for International Affairs of Gay City News. Scott Tucker has called him \"not only a left-wing critic of sexual and political conformism among sectors of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender movements, but ... also one of the notable public intellectuals of the civil libertarian left.\"\n\nAn early member of the Dump Johnson movement, Ireland was recruited for the staff of the presidential campaign of the man who became the anti-war candidate of the Dump Johnson movement, Senator Eugene McCarthy, for whom Ireland coordinated the Mid-Atlantic region of states. Following the 1968 Democratic National Convention (at which he coordinated McCarthy's labor support and helped organize demonstrations by Convention delegates against police brutality targeting anti-war demonstrators) Ireland went to Long Island to help run the successful campaign for Congress by Allard Lowenstein, considered the principal founder of the Dump Johnson movement.\n\nAfter a stint as a journalist on the \"New York Post\", when it was still owned by Dorothy Schiff, and then on the Community News Service (a short-lived wire service providing news of the black, Latino, and other minority racial communities), he resigned to manage the successful 1970 anti-Vietnam war campaign for Congress by Bella Abzug, making her the first left radical to be elected to the U.S. House of Representatives since Vito Marcantonio. He also managed Abzug's 1976 campaign for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senator from New York, which Abzug narrowly lost by 0.10 per cent of the vote to Daniel Patrick Moynihan.\n\nIreland played a studio executive in Woody Allen's Stardust Memories.\n\nHaving already worked briefly at the \"New York Post\" and Community News Service, Ireland returned full-time to journalism in 1977. In an obituary, Micah Sifry wrote that \"It was said that he could have been the 'next Jimmy Breslin,' but I think Dougie was too pure about his politics to ingratiate himself with enough people to win that label.\" Among his notable articles was a 1978 expose, daring for the time, of violence against gay men in the Ramble, known as a cruising area in Central Park in New York City.\n\nHe lived for ten years in France, writing on European politics and culture for various publications, including English language Paris city magazine, Paris Passion magazine; and he continued to write frequently about French and European politics and foreign affairs. Ireland was an assiduous promoter in the United States of the work of the prolific young French philosopher Michel Onfray.\n\nIreland was a columnist for \"The Village Voice\", the \"New York Observer\" \"New York\" magazine, and the Paris daily \"Libération\", among other publications. He was also a contributing editor of \"POZ\", the monthly for the HIV-positive community, of the magazine In These Times, and the French satirical news website Bakchich. In the late 1990s, he was a contributor to The Nation. Sifry, a colleague of his at the time, wrote that \"I think one of my most trying experiences as a young editor was being in the middle of his push to publish a damning indictment\" of then-President Bill Clinton\", \"and the editors' \"discomfort with his ferocity and willingness to infer the worst from a mixed bag of solid facts and not-so-solid surmises.\" However, Sifry added that Ireland \"was more right than not ... in the grand sense.\"\"\n\nSince mid-2005, Ireland was the Contributing Editor for International Affairs of Gay City News, the largest LGBT weekly newspaper in New York City and in the U.S.\n\nIreland's reporting on Iran in the several years after 2005 drew harsh rebuttals from a number of Iranian activists, as well as from Scott Long, director of the LGBT Rights Program at Human Rights Watch. They charged that Ireland and Gay City News generally were uncritical in relying on sources who maintained that two young men hanged in Mashhad, Iran in mid-2005 –– after being convicted of raping an underage boy at a time when they themselves were underage –– had in fact been involved in consensual sex. Long and some other human rights advocates criticized activists and reporters, including Ireland and controversial British campaigner Peter Tatchell, saying they were engaging in unwarranted speculation about the motives for the case.\n\nIreland continued to produce articles claiming a pattern of \"anti-gay\" executions in Iran. However, no professional human rights organization ever endorsed these claims, or identified any recent case of persons sentenced to death for consensual homosexual conduct in Iran. Long and others became increasingly critical, charging that Ireland and others were making claims without evidence, and imputing a Western gay identity to Iranians coming from a very different cultural experience. The conflict between Long on one side and Ireland and Tatchell on the other side was at times vitriolic and led to a 2010 episode in which Human Rights Watch and Long apologized in writing to Tatchell. However, Long remained a critic of Ireland to the end, faulting him for relying excessively on single sources in his reporting, for intolerance toward Islam and for failing to understand complex international situations. In particular, Long claimed that Ireland had unduly promoted the career of the flamboyant Russian activist Nikolai Alekseev while ignoring other Russian groups. Alekseev had a record of erratic behavior and supporting far right-wing causes, and later engaged in anti-Semitic outbursts. Scott Tucker writes that \"In his reports on the Russian gay movement, and especially of gay activist Nikolai Alexeyev, I found [Ireland] less reliable... When he became increasingly confined by illness, he could not pretend to be a truly investigative journalist.\"\n\nHe was born in Duluth, Minnesota and later lived in Port Hueneme, California, where his father worked in the information office of the Naval Battalion Construction Center.\n\nIreland developed polio as a child as the result of his Christian Scientist parents refusing to allow him to receive the polio vaccine.\n\nAfter nights out drinking with writers like Christopher Hitchens and Gore Vidal, Ireland gave up liquor.\n\nIn his final years, Ireland suffered from diabetes, kidney disease, severe sciatica, and weakened lungs and progressive muscle deterioration related to childhood polio. He also survived at least two major strokes. He often felt too ill to leave his apartment or have company. Ireland died in his East Village home on October 26, 2013.\n\nIreland's partner was Hervé Couergou. He died of AIDS in 1996.\n\nA severe critic from the left of President Bill Clinton's presidency, Ireland for three years wrote a syndicated Clinton Watch column. He wrote extensively in opposition to President George H. W. Bush's Gulf War, as well as President George W. Bush's Iraq War and War in Afghanistan.\n\nAt an early age, Ireland was part of the early 1960s American New Left. He was a member of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), and was elected to its National Council in 1963 at the age of 17. He also spent a year on the SDS national staff, as Assistant National Secretary, in 1963-64. Ireland dropped out of SDS in 1966 to devote his time to electoral organizing against the Vietnam War. As a staff member of the New Jersey Industrial Union Council AFL-CIO and the United Auto Workers Region 9-A, in 1967 he helped to organize the National Labor Leadership Assembly for Peace to oppose the Vietnam War.\n\nHe was involved in the Gay Activists Alliance (GAA) and Gay Liberation Front (GLF).\n\n"}
{"id": "1895519", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1895519", "title": "Organoboron chemistry", "text": "Organoboron chemistry\n\nOrganoborane or organoboron compounds are chemical compounds of boron and carbon that are organic derivatives of BH, for example trialkyl boranes. Organoboron chemistry or organoborane chemistry is the chemistry of these compounds. \n\nOrganoboron compounds are important reagents in organic chemistry enabling many chemical transformations, the most important one called hydroboration.\n\nThe C-B bond has low polarity (the difference in electronegativity 2.55 for carbon and 2.04 for boron), and therefore alkyl boron compounds are in general stable though easily oxidized.\n\nIn part because its lower electronegativity, boron often forms electron-deficient compounds, such as the triorganoboranes. Vinyl groups and aryl groups donate electrons and make boron less electrophilic and the C-B bond gains some double bond character. Like the parent borane, diborane, organoboranes are classified in organic chemistry as strong electrophiles because boron is unable to gain a full octet of electrons. Unlike diborane however, most organoboranes do not form dimers.\n\nSimple organoboranes such as triethylborane or tris(pentafluorophenyl)boron can be prepared from trifluoroborane (as the ether complex) and the ethyl or pentafluorophenyl Grignard reagent. The borates (RB are generated via addition of R-equivalents (RMgX, RLi, etc.) to RB). \n\nAlkenes insert into B-H bonds of boranes in a process called hydroboration. The process involves anti-Markovnikov addition. Hydroboration of alkenes or alkynes with borane (BH) or borane equivalents leads to the conversion of only 33% of the starting olefin to product after oxidation or protonolysis—the remaining olefin is incorporated into boron-containing byproducts. One organoboron reagent that is often employed in synthesis is 9-BBN. Hydroborations take place stereospecifically in a \"syn\" mode, that is on the same face of the alkene. In this concerted reaction the transition state is represented as a square with the corners occupied by carbon, carbon, hydrogen and boron with maximum overlap between the two olefin p-orbitals and the empty boron orbital.\n\nMetal-catalyzed C-H Borylation reactions are transition metal catalyzed organic reactions that produce an organoboron compound through functionalization of aliphatic and aromatic C-H bonds. A common reagent in this type of reaction is bis(pinacolato)diboron.\n\nBoron–carbon bonds are polarized toward carbon. Thus, the carbon attached to boron is nucleophilic. This property is harnessed to transfer one of the R groups to an electrophilic center either inter- or (more often) intramolecularly.In the latter case, the nucleophilic R group is able to undergo 1,2-migration towards an electrophilic carbon attached to boron. The resulting reorganized borane can then be oxidized or subjected to protonolysis to afford organic products:\n\nIn organic synthesis the hydroboration reaction is taken further to generate other functional groups in the place of the boron group. The hydroboration-oxidation reaction offers a route to alcohols by oxidation of the borane with hydrogen peroxide or to the carbonyl group with the stronger oxidizing agent chromium oxide.\n\nCarbon monoxide is found to react with trialkylboranes. What follows is a 1,2-rearrangement whereby an alkyl substituent migrates from boron to the carbon of the carbonyl group. Homologated primary alcohols result from the treatment of organoboranes with carbon monoxide and a hydride.\nAsymmetric allylboration demonstrates another useful application of organoboranes in carbon–carbon bond formation. In this example from Nicolaou's synthesis of the epothilones, asymmetric allylboration (using an allylborane derived from chiral alpha-pinene) is used in conjunction with TBS protection and ozonolysis. Overall, this provides a two-carbon homologation sequence that delivers the required acetogenin sequence.\n\nBorane hydrides such as 9-BBN and L-selectride (lithium tri-sec-butylborohydride) are reducing agents. An example of an asymmetric catalyst for carbonyl reductions is the CBS catalyst. This catalyst is also based on boron, the purpose of which is coordination to the carbonyl oxygen atom.\n\nTrialkylboranes, BR, can be oxidized to the corresponding borates, B(OR). One method for the determination of the amount of C-B bonds in a compound is by oxidation of RB with trimethylamine oxide (MeNO) to B(OR). The trimethylamine (MeN) formed can then be titrated.\n\nBoronic acids RB(OH) react with potassium bifluoride K[HF] to form trifluoroborate salts K[RBF] which are precursors to nucleophilic alkyl and aryl boron difluorides, ArBF. The salts are more stable than the boronic acids themselves and used for instance in alkylation of certain aldehydes:\n\nOrganoboron compounds also lend themselves to transmetalation reactions, especially with organopalladium compounds. This reaction type is exemplified in the Suzuki reaction, which involves coupling of aryl- or vinyl-boronic acid with an aryl- or vinyl-halide catalyzed by a palladium(0) complex,\n][\\text{Base}] R1-R2}\\\\\nThis reaction is an important method for making carbon-carbon bonds.\n\nAmong the most studied classes of organoboron compounds have the formula BRH. As discussed above, these compounds are used as catalysts, reagents, and synthetic intermediates. The trialkyl and triaryl derivatives feature trigonal planar boron center that is typically only weakly Lewis acidic. Except for a few very bulky derivatives, the hydrides (BRH for n = 1 or 2) exist as dimers, reminiscent of the structure of diborane itself. Trisubstituted derivatives, e.g. triethylboron are monomers.\n\nCompounds of the type BR(OR) are called borinic esters (n = 2), boronic esters (n = 1), and borates (n = 0). Boronic acids are used in Suzuki reaction. Trimethyl borate, which is debatably not an organoboron compound, is an intermediate in the production of sodium borohydride.\n\nBoron is renowned for forming cluster compounds, e.g. dodecaborate [BH]. Many organic derivatives are known for such clusters. One example is [B(CH)] and its radical derivative [B(CH)]. Related cluster compounds with carbon vertices are called carboranes are. The best known is orthocarborane, with the formula CBH. Although they have few commercial applications, carboranes have attracted much attention because they are so structurally unusual. Anionic derivatives, dicarbollides, e.g., [CBH] are ligands that behave like cyclopentadienide.\n\nIn borabenzene, one CH center in benzene is replaced by boron. These compounds are invariably isolated as adducts, e.g., CHB-pyridine. The cyclic compound borole, a structural analog of pyrrole, has not been isolated, but substituted derivatives known as boroles are known. The cyclic compound borepin is aromatic.\n\nBoryl anions have the formula RB. Nucleophilic anionic boryl compounds have long been elusive but a 2006 study described a boryllithium compound, which reacts as a nucleophile: Organometallic compounds with metal to boron bonds, (i.e., M–BR), are known as boryl complexes. Related ligands are borylenes (M–B(R)–M).\n\nThe absence of lithium boryl compounds is notable because in other period 2 elements lithium salts are common e.g. lithium fluoride, lithium hydroxide lithium amide and methyllithium. The gap highlights the very low electronegativity of boron. Reaction of base with a borohydride RBH does not result in deprotonation to the boryl anion RB but to formation of the boryl anion RBH(base). This reaction product has a complete octet. Instead the boryl compound is prepared by reductive heterolysis of a boron-bromide bond by lithium metal. The new boryl lithium compound is very similar to and isoelectronic with N-heterocyclic carbenes. It is designed to benefit from aromatic stabilization (6-electron system counting the nitrogen lone pairs and an empty boron p-orbital, see structure A) and from kinetic stabilization from the bulky 2,6-diisopropylphenyl groups. X-ray diffraction confirms sp2 hybridization at boron and its nucleophilic addition reaction with benzaldehyde gives further proof of the proposed structure.\n\nAlkylideneboranes of the type RB=CRR with a boron – carbon double bond are rarely encountered. An example is borabenzene. The parent compound is HB=CH which can be detected at low temperatures. A fairly stable derivative is CHB=C(SiMe) but is prone to cyclodimerisation.\n\nNHCs and boranes form stable NHC borane adducts. Triethylborane adducts can be synthesised directly from the imidazolium salt and lithium triethylborohydride. Members of this compound class are investigated for use as reagent or catalyst.\n\nChemical compounds with boron to boron double bonds are rare. In 2007 the first neutral diborene (RHB=BHR) was presented by Gregory Robinson of the University of Georgia. Each boron atom has a proton attached to it and each boron atom is coordinated to a NHC carbene. The parent structure with the additional carbene ligands is diborane(2).\n\nA reported diboryne is based on similar chemistry.\n\nTEB – Triethylborane was used to ignite the JP-7 fuel of the Pratt & Whitney J58 variable cycle engines powering the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird.\n"}

{"id": "1895540", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1895540", "title": "Fluvial terrace", "text": "Fluvial terrace\n\nFluvial terraces are elongated terraces that flank the sides of floodplains and fluvial valleys all over the world. They consist of a relatively level strip of land, called a “tread,” separated from either an adjacent floodplain, other fluvial terraces, or uplands by distinctly steeper strips of land called “risers.” These terraces lie parallel to and above the river channel and its floodplain. Because of the manner in which they form, fluvial terraces are underlain by fluvial sediments of highly variable thickness.\n\nFluvial terraces are the remnants of earlier floodplains that existed at a time when either a stream or river was flowing at a higher elevation before its channel downcut to create a new floodplain at a lower elevation. Changes in elevation can be due to changes in the base level (elevation of the lowest point in the fluvial system, usually the drainage basin) of the fluvial system, which leads to headward erosion along the length of either a stream or river, gradually lowering its elevation. For example, downcutting by a river can lead to increased velocity of a tributary, causing that tributary to erode toward its headwaters. Terraces can also be left behind when the volume of the fluvial flow declines due to changes in climate, typical of areas which were covered by ice during periods of glaciation, and their adjacent drainage basins.\n\nThere are two basic types of fluvial terraces, \"fill terraces\" and \"strath terraces.\" Fill terraces sometimes are further subdivided into \"nested fill terraces\" and \"cut terraces.\" Both fill and strath terraces are, at times, described as being either \"paired\" or \"unpaired\" terraces based upon the relative elevations of the surface of these terraces.\n\nFill terraces: Fill terraces are the result of an existing valley being filled with alluvium. The valley may fill with alluvium for many different reasons including: an influx in bed load due to glaciation or change in stream power which causes the valley, that was down cut by either a stream or river, to be filled in with material (Easterbrook). The stream or river will continue to deposit material until an equilibrium is reached and it can transport the material rather than deposit it. This equilibrium may last for a very short period, such as, after glaciation, or for a very long time if the conditions do not change. The fill terrace is created when the conditions change again and either a stream or river starts to incise into the material that it deposited in the valley. Once this occurs benches composed completely of alluvium form on the sides of the valley. The upper most benches are the fill terraces. As it continues to cut down through the alluvium the fill terraces are left above the river channel (sometimes 100 m or more). The fill terrace is only the very highest terrace resulting from the depositional episode; if there are multiple terraces below the fill terrace, these are called \"cut terraces\".\n\nCut terraces: Cut terraces, also called \"cut-in-fill\" terraces, are similar to the fill terraces mentioned above, but they are erosional in origin. Once the alluvium deposited in the valley has begun to erode and fill terraces form along the valley walls, cut terraces may also form below the fill terraces. As either a stream or river continues to incise into the material, multiple levels of terraces may form. The uppermost being the fill terraces and the remaining lower terraces are cut terraces.\n\nNested fill terraces: Nested fill terraces are the result of the valley filling with alluvium, the alluvium being incised, and the valley filling again with material but to a lower level than before. The terrace that results for the second filling is a nested terrace because it has been “nested” into the original alluvium and created a terrace. These terraces are depositional in origin and may be able to be identified by a sudden change in alluvium characteristics such as finer material.\n\nStrath terraces: Strath terraces are the result of either a stream or river downcutting through bedrock. As the flow continues to downcut, a period of valley widening may occur and expand the valley width. This may occur due to an equilibrium reached in the fluvial system resulting from: slowed or paused uplift, climate change, or a change in the bedrock type. Once downcutting continues the flattened valley bottom composed of bedrock (overlain with a possible thin layer of alluvium) is left above either a stream or river channel. These bedrock terraces are the strath terraces and are erosional in nature.\n\nPaired and unpaired terraces: Terraces of the same elevation on opposite sides of either a stream or river are called \"paired terraces\". They occur when it downcuts evenly on both sides and terraces on one side of the river correspond in height with those on the other side. Paired terraces are caused by river rejuvenation. \"Unpaired terraces\" occur when either a stream or river encounters material on one side that resists erosion, leaving a single terrace with no corresponding terrace on the resistant side.\n\nFluvial terraces can be used to measure the rate at which either a stream or river is downcutting its valley. Using various dating methods, an age can be determined for the deposition of the terrace. Using the resulting date and the elevation above its current level, an approximate average rate of downcutting can be determined.\n\n"}

The film adaptation \"Storm Boy\" won the Jury and Best Film prizes at the 1977 AFI Awards.\n\nStorm Boy likes to wander alone along the fierce deserted coast among the dunes that face out into the Southern Ocean. After a pelican mother is shot, Storm Boy rescues the three chicks, and nurses them back to health. He names them Mr Proud, Mr Ponder and Mr Percival. After he releases them, his favourite, Mr Percival, returns. The story then concentrates on the conflict between his lifestyle and the externally imposed requirement for him to attend a school, and the fate of the pelican.\n\nThe 1976 film adaptation \"Storm Boy\" won both the Jury Prize and Best Film at the 1977 Australian Film Institute Awards. The film starred David Gulpilil in the role of Finger Bone and Greg Rowe in the title role.

Henry trained at the Birmingham School of Speech and Drama, which was followed by eight years at the Birmingham Rep. Between 1975 and 1988, he played his best-known role of Benny Hawkins, a handyman in \"Crossroads\". British Forces in the Falklands Island called the local islanders Benny, after Henry's character, as many of them wore Benny-style woolly hats.\n\nIn 1977, Henry recorded \"Benny's Theme\" with the Mayson Glen Orchestra, on Pye Records. It peaked at no. 39 in the UK Singles Chart in January 1978. He was in character as Benny in the song, but spoke rather than sang.\n\nHenry made a guest appearance on the Central Television games show \"Bullseye\", presented by Jim Bowen, on 11 February, 1985. He scored 215 and raised £215 for charity.\n\nHis country-boy style gained him the part of Peter Stevens in \"The Archers\" for a time. Henry's post-\"Crossroads\" career included minor stage roles and running a nightclub in Whitchurch, Shropshire, but in 1994 he returned to television briefly in a tribute to \"Crossroads\", called \"30 Years On\". In a 2002 interview, Henry declared that the public still loved Benny and that during a shopping trip, he returned to his car to find someone had left a piece of paper on it saying \"Benny, we miss you\".\n\nHenry appeared in the episode \"Stoppo Driver\" in \"The Sweeney\" playing a gangster.\n\nIn 2004, he returned to acting on TV in an episode of the British medical soap opera \"Doctors\". He then played regular character Frank, a baker's delivery man and later attempted rapist, in the seventh and penultimate series of the ITV1 prison drama \"Bad Girls\".\n\nReturning to the stage, in 2009, he appeared in a touring version of \"Run for Your Wife\" and the following year portrayed Tony Hancock in the play \"Hancock's Finest Hour\".\n\nThe slang phrase \"throwing a benny\" refers to someone having a temper tantrum and may originate from Henry's \"Crossroads\" character.\n\nComedian Ronnie Barker revealed in his later years that he had suggested Henry be cast as the character Lennie Godber opposite Barker in the sitcom \"Porridge\", but Richard Beckinsale was chosen instead by the television producer.\n\nIn October 2017, Henry appeared on \"Celebrity Pointless\" alongside Shaun Williamson. They won the jackpot.\n\nPaul and his wife Sheila had a son, Anthony, and a daughter, Justine, who died as a result of a traffic collision at the age of 19.\n"}

{"id": "1895589", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1895589", "title": "UNITED for Intercultural Action", "text": "UNITED for Intercultural Action\n\nUNITED for Intercultural Action is a European network against nationalism, racism, fascism and in support of migrants and refugees, in which over 560 organisations from 48 European countries cooperate. UNITED was founded in 1992 (officially registered as charitable organisation under Dutch law in 1993) and provides a forum for active solidarity and cooperation between a wide variety of organisations in Europe and their activists across European borders.\n\nUNITED defines itself as pan-European tool to strengthen and cross-link grassroots organisations and their actions to improve their socio-political impact. The idea of the UNITED network was born by participants of two anti-racist European youth seminars in Strasbourg in 1992. At these occasions, the need for a European-wide info- and networking system was expressed against the background of the most violent and massive xenophobic riots that took place in Germany after the Second World War: the riot of Rostock-Lichtenhagen August 22–24, 1992.\n\nThe work of UNITED mainly focuses on the coordination of European-wide awareness-raising campaigns, organisation of international conferences and the maintenance of an info-system and network structure. UNITED coordinates following annual campaigns:\n\nUNITED has participatory status at the Council of Europe, is often an elected member of the Advisory Council on Youth of the Council of Europe and has since 1997 special consultative status with the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) of the United Nations.\n\nIn 1966, the General Assembly of the United Nations declared March 21 the International Day for the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination as a reaction to the murder of 69 anti-apartheid demonstrators in Sharpeville, South Africa, in 1960.\n\nThe first European-wide Action Week Against Racism on occasion of 21 March was organised by UNITED in 1993. Since then, UNITED coordinates the European-wide Action Week Against Racism on an annual basis with the aim to create public attention by stimulating and integrating different activities under the umbrella of a common campaign. UNITED doesn't organise campaign activities, but produces and freely provides so-called “campaign tools” and documents the campaign activities. The campaign activities are organised by independent organisations and groups all over Europe. UNITED collect these activities in an online map available at www.weekagainstracism.eu.\n\nIn several countries, the idea of the annual Action Week Against Racism successfully developed into self-reinforcing tendencies, whereby local NGOs started to stimulate national action weeks. Since 2001, annual International Weeks Against Racism (German: \"Internationale Wochen gegen Rassismus\") developed in Germany – the main organisers of this campaign are the German NGOs Interkultureller Rat in Deutschland and Gesicht Zeigen. Semaine d'Actions Contre le Racisme, a Montreal-based NGO, organises a Canada-wide action week against racism since 2000. Other major groups that followed the idea and promoted the action week against racism around 21 March are the European Network Against Racism (ENAR) or Football Against Racism in Europe (FARE). Despite the fact that different national action weeks developed throughout time, all focus around 21 March and are related in their message.\n\nIn 2001, a special UN General Assembly Resolution was adopted to declare the former African Refugee Day as the International Refugee Day as an expression of solidarity with Africa, which hosts the most refugees. The General Assembly noted that 2001 marked the fiftieth anniversary of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, and that the Organization of African Unity (OAU) had agreed to have the International Refugee Day coincide with African Refugee Day on 20 June.\n\nUNITED coordinates an annual campaign around this date. This campaign aims to highlight the issues of refugees from a non-governmental perspective. The message of the campaign is carried by the monitoring results of the ongoing monitoring project Fatal Realities of Fortress Europe.\n\nOn 9 November 1938, Nazi Germany started a pogrom against Jewish people. Jewish homes were ransacked, as were shops, towns and villages, as SA stormtroopers and civilians destroyed buildings with sledgehammers, leaving the streets covered in pieces of smashed windows—the origin of the name \"Kristallnacht\", which freely translated means the Night of Broken Glass. 91 Jews were killed, and 30,000 Jewish men – a quarter of all Jewish men in Germany – were taken to concentration camps, where they were tortured for months, with over 1,000 of them dying. Around 1,668 synagogues were ransacked, and 267 set on fire. In Vienna alone 95 synagogues or houses of prayer were destroyed.\n\nThe \"Kristallnacht\" pogrom is seen as the symbolic beginning of the systematic eradication of Jewish people which had started with the discrimination and exclusion of the German Jews since 1933 and which eventually led to the murder of millions Jewish people and so-called \"enemies of the German state\": homosexuals, criminals and \"asocial\" people, members of diverse religious communities, people with mental disabilities, political ‘offenders’ such as communists and socialists, Spanish republican refugees, and minorities like Roma and Sinti and others.\n\nSince 1995, UNITED coordinates an annual pan-European campaign on occasion of the 9 November, called International Day against Fascism and Antisemitism. Hereby, the approach is two-fold: while one part of the campaign aims to commemorate victims of the \"Kristallnacht\" pogrom and, more broadly, victims of the Holocaust and of fascism throughout history; another part focuses mostly on contemporary issues of racism, antisemitism, right-wing extremism and neo-fascism. The campaign is joined by many different groups with independent actions which are collected by UNITED in an online map available at www.dayagainstfascism.eu.\n\nSince 1993 UNITED has been monitoring the deadly results of the building of 'Fortress Europe' by making a list of the refugees and migrants, who have died in their attempt of entering the 'Fortress' or as a result of Europe's immigration policies. UNITED receives this information from newspapers, journalists, organisations working in the field of refugee and migrant issues, private researchers and governmental organisations. The figures given can only be taken as an indication of the true number of deaths. Each case published by UNITED is documented in the UNITED archives and the scientific part of the documentation can be requested by researchers and journalists to use it for their studies.\n\nBy 2011, more than 15,181 deaths have been documented. The so-called \"List of Deaths\" plays an important role in UNITED's annual Refugee Day campaign and is also used as lobby tool. To measure the magnitude of the \"war on migrants\", OWNI – an online information and news platform – built an interactive map as an electronic memorial for these tragedies. The \"List of Deaths\" was also used in several art projects.\n\nThe European Address Book Against Racism is an annual publication that holds contact details and working-field information of organisations active within the scope of UNITED. The printed edition 2011 contained addresses of more than 2,480 organisations and magazines and 155 funding institutions. The searchable online version contains over 4,500 entries.\n\nThe Calendar of Internationalism is published several times a year and holds information on events and trainings related to UNITED's working filed. There is also a weekly updated online version of the Calendar.\n\nOn a regular basis, UNITED publishes Information Leaflets written by experts and activist within the UNITED working field.\n\nI CARE - Internet Centre Anti Racism Europe is a web-portal featuring discussions and live reports on antiracism activities, mainly within Europe. ICARE is an information disseminator for the European NGO-community working in the fields of anti-discrimination, human rights, antisemitism, diversity and immigration, with a focus on anti-racism. ICARE is a NGO community networking system, an environment where large and small organizations can work on local, national, regional and international issues. The purpose of ICARE is the empowerment of democratic, non-violent Human Rights and antiracism work by offering information and reporting on events taking place, by facilitating communication, advocacy, campaigns and actions and by stimulating intersectional and international co-operation of NGOs.\n\nI CARE started on 1 October 1999 as a cooperation project of UNITED for Intercultural Action and the Magenta Foundation. The aim was to create a portal for anti-racism on Internet. Although the Internet opened-up the possibilities for collaboration with organisations worldwide, the decision was to focus on Europe, as both founding organisations basically work within a European context and because specific aspects of racism are still very much related to In \"Real Life\" culture, policies and practices. In September 2005 ICARE became a Magenta Foundation-only project.\n\nICARE reported from the 2001 UN World Conference against Racism (WCAR) in Durban, offering critical appraisal of the conference – which included the judgment \"that racism was allowed to run rampant\" and that \"[w]hat happened in Durban [in 2000] should never happen again.\"; the website continued to track developments regarding the Durban Review Conference 2009.\n\nIn 2010, ICARE set out to establish a new service, the ICARE Hate Crime News. This service contains articles (English only) about hate-motivated incidents and crimes in the 56 Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) participating States and is updated almost every day with items from 'regular' news sources. Next to individual research, ICARE Hate Crime News makes use of crowdsourcing to collect incident reports. I CARE's secretariat states to monitor all contributions in order to be in line with universally recognised human rights standards. Incident reports need to be written in English language and include source and, if available, web location. For the definition of \"hate crime\", ICARE points to the working definition that was developed by the OSCE – Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR). ICARE Hate Crime News contains articles from 1 January 2010.\n\nUNITED cooperates with the International Institute of Social History (IISH), which is a research institute located in Amsterdam. The UNITED secretariat, also located in Amsterdam, has collectssince 1992 documentation of a wide range of European anti-racist and anti-fascist groups and of organisations in support of migrants and refugees since 1992. The archive was transferred to the IISH in 1998. It consists of correspondence with the connected organizations; questionnaires concerning the start of the network and documents concerning campaigns; documentation on ca. 300 anti-racist and anti-fascist groups and organizations; and documents relating to conferences organised by UNITED, with correspondence, documents concerning preparation, subventions, participants and accommodation.\n\n\n"}

Traditionally a 'big day out' for the finalist's supporters, it was the less prestigious of the two cups. It began as a 55 over a side game, but was later reduced to 50. The winning team in the first cup final in 1972, Leicestershire won £2,500, the losing finalists Yorkshire £1,000 and Chris Balderstone, winner of the man of the match – the coveted 'Gold Award' – £100.\n\nTwenty teams were organised into four zonal groups in its original format with the games played at the start of the season in May. The (then) seventeen first-class counties were joined by three other teams, Minor Counties (North), Minor Counties (South) and Cambridge University who alternated with Oxford University. Each team played the others in the group, the winners of each game awarded three points plus, in its first year, a bonus point for bowling their opponents out. The first two teams in each group went on to contest a quarter-final knock-out stage. Groups were set up to create 'derby' games.\n\nin 1975, the Oxford and Cambridge university sides combined to form an Oxford & Cambridge team which competed in every season thereafter. In 1976 the groupings were reorganised to remove the geographical element and the Minor Counties were divided into East and West instead of North and South. Scotland entered the competition in 1980 and the Minor Counties were reduced to one combined team. Durham joined the competition in 1992, having become a first-class county; Ireland joined in 1994 and the competition was streamlined to a straight knock-out cup. Mike Atherton's Combined Universities side almost reached the semi-finals in 1989 and Ireland defeated Middlesex eight years later.\n\nThe final was played at Lord's, initially in mid-July, but latterly in late June. Viv Richards of Somerset made the highest score in a final, an unbeaten 132. Ken Higgs of Leicestershire took a hat-trick (Alan Butcher, Pat Pocock and Arnold Long) against Surrey in the final of 1974, but still ended on the losing side. Other notable performances in its later days include Mark Alleyne's century for Gloucestershire in 1999, 112 from Aravinda de Silva as Kent lost in 1995, and Ben Hollioake's 115-ball 98 for Surrey in 1997.\n\nThe highest total ever recorded in the group matches was the 388 scored by Essex against Scotland in 1992. Graham Gooch scored 127 as Scotland lost by 272 runs.\n\nAt a B & H Cup group game at Worcester on 24 May 1979, the Somerset captain Brian Rose declared after one over with the score at 1 for 0. Worcestershire scored the required 2 runs in 10 balls. The declaration was done to protect Somerset's run-rate so they could qualify for the next round. After a special TCCB vote, Somerset were ejected from the competition for bringing the game into disrepute.\n\nThe Benson & Hedges Cup's later years coincided with increasing concern about the quantity of one-day cricket in England and Wales. A ban on tobacco advertising deprived the cup of its sponsor and it was wound up in 2002 in favour of the Twenty20 Cup, first held the following year. The format of the Friends Provident Trophy echoed the Benson and Hedges Cup as teams competed in a group stage before going on to knockout rounds.\n\nThe umpires in the last final had faced each other as players in the first final 30 years before: John Hampshire for Yorkshire and Barry Dudleston for Leicestershire.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The regiment traces its origins to the 18th century and has fought in every major campaign of the British Indian Army and the Indian Army, including the two world wars.\n\nThe Kumaon Regiment, established at Ranikhet in 1917, still gets its recruits from the Kumaon : of the Kumaon division and other mixed recruits from the plains\n\nThe troop composition has been 80% Kumaonis and 20% mixed class with predominantly Yadavs from plains.\n\nSoldiering has been an important profession of the Kumaonis and the region has a long history of warfare with neighbours, including the Garhwalis and the Gurkhas. The Kumaonis were never fully subjugated by the powerful Muslim dynasties of Delhi. They often offered their martial services as mercenaries, and fought on British side in the Anglo-Nepalese War.\n\nThe Fierce fighting battalions of the Nizam of Hyderabad made up of Kumaonis and men from this region of the himalyan foothills formed a significant part of the strike force of Subhas Chandra Bose's Indian National Army.\nWell before the split from royal gurkha rifles, the kumaonis had been enlisted in the five regiments of Gurkhas belonging to the Bengal Infantry and the Punjab Frontier Force. The Third Gorkha Rifles recruited heavily from the then greater kumaon kingdom(which included parts of terai presently in nepal) the large recruitment of Kumaonis led to this being known the Kemaoon Battalion.\n\nThe Kumaonis were recruited in the military of the East India Company from the early 19th century. They often moved to other states in search of military service, including in the service of the Nizam of Hyderabad.\n\nThe Nizam's Contingent was formed when Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley, brother of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, became Governor-General of India and formed a plan to rid India of French influence. His first action, on arriving in India in 1798, was to effect the disbandment of the Indian units of the Nizam under the command of Monsieur Raymond and officered by non-British Europeans. These soldiers were formed into the British officered Nizam's Contingent that fought at the Battle of Seringapatam in 1799 against Tippu Sultan in the final battle of the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War.\n\nIn 1813, Sir Henry Russell, then British Resident in the court of Nizam of Hyderabad, raised the Russell Brigade comprising two battalions. Later, four more battalions were raised and they were known as the Berar Infantry. In addition, two battalions known as the Elichpur Brigade, were raised by Nawab Salabat Khan, Subedar of Berar, as a part of the Nizam's forces. The men of the Russell Brigade were chiefly Hindus, recruited from Oudh and other parts of Uttar Pradesh. Kumaonis, along with other North Indian classes served in the Hyderabad contingent which was raised, trained and led by British officers under Russell, but paid for by the Nizam of Hyderabad.\n\nBy 1853, at the time of the signing of a treaty between the Nizam and the British, the Nizam's forces consisted of 8 battalions. The force was renamed as the Hyderabad Contingent, and became part of the British Indian Army, subsequently, becoming the 19th Hyderabad Regiment. Over time, the class composition changed to Kumaonis and Ahirs.\n\nDuring World War I, a Kumaon battalion was raised at Ranikhet on 23 October 1917 as 4/39th Kumaon Rifles. In 1918, it was redesignated as 1st Battalion, 50th Kumaon Rifles and a second battalion was raised. These were merged with the Hyderabad Contingent into the 19th Hyderabad Regiment in 1923. The first battalion of the 50th Kumaon Rifles survived to become the 1st Kumaon Rifles, and is today the 3rd Battalion, Kumaon Regiment (Rifles) of the Indian Army. Some units of the Berar and Elichpur infantry were demobilized after World War I. However, the Hyderabad Regiment was again expanded during World War II.\n\nOn 27 October 1945, after the Second World War, the 19th Hyderabad Regiment was renamed as 19th Kumaon Regiment. Post-independence, it has been known as the Kumaon Regiment.\n\nTwo state forces battalions, 4th Gwalior Infantry and Indore Infantry were allocated to the Kumaon Regiment becoming 14 Kumaon (Gwalior) and 15 Kumaon (Indore) respectively.\n\nThe Kumaon Regiment has produced three Indian Army Chiefs: General Satyawant Mallannah Shrinagesh (4 Kumaon), General Kodendera Subayya Thimayya (4 Kumaon) and General Tapishwar Narain Raina (14 Kumaon).\n\nThe senior battalion, 1 Kumaon, originally raised in March 1813, was converted to the airborne role in 1946. It fought with distinction in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947 as 1 Kumaon (Para). It remained a part of the regiment until April 1952 when it was formally inducted into the Parachute Regiment as 3 Para(Russel’s vipers). In 2000, the battalion was converted to special forces as part of the expansion of the special operations forces of the Indian Army, and renamed 3rd Battalion para(special forces) or 3 Para (SF).\n\nOn 1 November 1970, the Naga Regiment was raised and affiliated with the Kumaon Regiment. The class composition of this regiment comprises Nagas, Kumaonis, Garhwalis and Gurkhas.\n\nA Border Scouts battalion was raised and named as \"Kumaon Scouts\".\n\n14 Kumaon (Gwalior), was converted to the mechanised infantry role, and transferred to the Mechanised Infantry Regiment, as its 5th Battalion.\n\nDuring World War I, the first all Kumaoni battalions were raised. The first was formed in 1917 as the 4/39th (Kumaon) Royal Garhwal Rifles and redesignated in 1918 as the 1st Battalion, 50th Kumaon Rifles when it fought in the Battle of Megiddo (1918). A 2nd Battalion was also raised in 1918 but disbanded in 1923. The Hyderabad Contingent, with its mixed Kumaoni, Jats, Ahirs and Deccan Muslims, continued and fought with distinction in the Great War. In 1922, during the Indian Army reorganisation, the six regiments of the Hyderabad Contingent were renamed as the 19th Hyderabad Regiment and infantry companies formed from the Kumaon region replaced many of the Deccan Muslim-based companies. In 1923 the 1/50th Kumaon Rifles joined the 19th Hyderabad Regiment as the 1st Kumaon Rifles. In 1935 the battalion commanders attempted to have the regiment renamed as the 19th Kumaon Regiment, due to the diminishing links to the Deccan and Hyderabad regions. The request was refused.\n\nThe 19th Hyderabad Regiment in 1939 consisted of four regular battalions; the 1st (Russell's), 2nd (Berar), 4th and The Kumaon Rifles. The Hyderabads expanded during the war adding another eight battalions to the 19th Hyderabad Regiment. Two more battalions, the 1st and 2nd Hyderabad Infantry, were raised as part of the Indian State Forces. The battalions of the 19th Hyderabad Regiment fought in the Middle East, North African Campaign, Persia, Battle of Malaya, Battle of Singapore and Burma Campaign.\n\nThe Kumaon Rifles were based in Hong Kong at the beginning of the Second World War but were transferred to the Middle East as part of the 24th Indian Infantry Brigade. The battalion took part in the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran in 1941 under Major-General William Slim. They remained in Persia as part of the garrison throughout the rest of the war.\n\nThe 4th Battalion was part of the 12th Indian Infantry Brigade based in Malaya when the Japanese Army invaded in December 1941. The 4/19th Hyderabads were one of the few battalions in Malaya that were relatively well trained in jungle warfare. Although the battalion performed well in the fighting retreat in north-west Malaya, they were practically annihilated at the disastrous Battle of Slim River on 7 January 1942. The few survivors of the 4th Battalion were withdrawn to Singapore where they took part in the brief defence of the island before it surrendered on 15 February 1942.\n\n1 and 4 Kumaon was dispatched to Jammu and Kashmir to participate in the defence of Srinigar. 4 Kumaon elements were decisive in the Battle of Badgam.\n\nThis was the only battle of the war in which an Indian unit attacked the Chinese, rather than defending. On 14 November 1962, 6 Kumaon attacked and captured Chinese defenses in the Walong sector, Arunachal Pradesh, without any artillery or aerial support.\n\nThe Chinese retaliated with artillery and multiple human wave attacks. The Kumaonis were vastly outnumbered by over 10 to 1, but held their ground and repulsed every attack until all their ammunition was exhausted, without any logistical support. They then engaged in hand-to-hand combat, and fought to the last man and bullet. Five times as many Chinese soldiers died in the battle. The Chinese succeeded in retaking the defences when there was no Kumaoni left standing.\n\nFive Vir Chakras were awarded to soldiers from 6 Kumaon for their actions in the battle; the battalion celebrates 14 November as Walong Day.\n\n120 men of C Company of 13 Kumaon, commanded by Maj. Shaitan Singh, made a last stand at the Rezang La pass on 18 November 1962.\n\nThe area assigned to C Company was defended by three platoon positions, but the surrounding terrain isolated 13 Kumaon from the rest of the regiment. The Indian artillery was located behind a hill feature blocking the line of fire so the infantry had to fight the battle without artillery support. The Chinese suffered no such disadvantage and brought heavy artillery fire upon C Company.\n\nThe Chinese attack, which was expected, came through a dry river bed. It was repulsed with heavy machine gun fire by the Indian soldiers. The Chinese regrouped and attacked persistently with more reinforcements. Maj. Shaitan Singh went from post to post raising the morale of his men and continued to fight even after being seriously wounded. Of C Company's 120 troops, 114 men were martyred, Of the 6 survivors, 5 were severely injured and captured by the Chinese. A memorial in Rewari claims that 1,300 Chinese soldiers were killed in the battle.\n\nMaj. Shaitan Singh posthumously won the Param Vir Chakra for his actions, the second for the Kumaon Regiment (the first being won by Maj. Somnath Sharma). Other soldiers defending Rezang La who were awarded Vir Chakras were Nk. Hukum Chand (posthumous), Nk. Gulab Singh Yadav, L/Nk. Ram Singh (posthumous), Sub. Ram Kumar and Sub. Ram Chander.\n\nTwo Kumaoni Battalions continued to operate against the guerrillas. One Infantry Brigade was ordered to oust the enemy from the area, own side of a river and destroy the bridges.\n\nThe enemy was holding the area with a company of 23 Azad Kashmir and one company of the Pakistani special forces unit - Special Service Group . Lt Col Salick decided to attack the feature with two Companies. It was to be a silent attack, though the battalion had adequate artillery support on call. The leading platoon under Jemadar Ram Singh hit an enemy minefield shortly after midnight on 21 September. Despite being wounded, this brave JCO pressed forward to find a way through the mines.\n\nAt 7.45 AM the assaulting companies resumed the advance. Despite the heavy automatic fire that greeted them, the Kumaonis charged. In the initial assault, Capt (later Maj Gen) Surendra Shah, and his signaller were wounded. The fighting thereafter was fierce and continued for two and a half hours. Capt Shah was wounded a second time but he refused to be evacuated till the battle was over.\n\nThe Kumaonis tenacity ultimately won the day and the hill was in their hands at 10 AM. For conspicuous gallantry in the action, Capt Surendra Shah received Vir Chakra. Another recipient of this award was Nk Chander Singh. In addition to these awards, one officer and two JCOs were Mentioned in Despatches. To commemorate the Kumaonis victory, the hill was named the KUMAON Hill.\n\nIt was a significant achievement as a regular infantry battalion's Kumaoni troops ousted re-enforced enemy positions at significant heights occupied by better equip enemy special forces unit.\n\nAnother Kumaon Battalion captured `Maharajke' in West Pakistan with a fierce attack during the night of 6 and 7 September 1965. On 13 September 1965, the Battalion attacked and captured village Pagowal an enemy stronghold which was 13 miles inside Pakistan . Not content with this, by 23 September 1965 (the day cease fire came into effect) the Battalion had made another deep wedge into Pakistani territory.\n\nNk Ganesh Dutt was awarded Vir Chakra for his conspicuous bravery. The Battalion was also awarded four Mentioned in Dispatches and four Chief of the Army Staff Commendation Cards during these operations and was bestowed with the Theatre Honour ‘ Punjab ’.\nTo preempt Pakistani attacks into India, a Kumaon battalion advanced into the Mandiala Heights in West Pakistan at the end of August 1965. Before they had the chance to set up any defenses, the Pakistan Army began a major offensive in the Chhamb sector during the early hours of 1 September, accompanied by massive artillery shelling targeting the Kumaon battalion's positions. There followed an armoured thrust by two Pakistani armoured divisions. Faced with enemy advancing from 3 sides, the battalion held off for a day and a half. On 2 September, the battalion was ordered to withdraw after they had destroyed four Pakistani tanks. One Vir Chakra was awarded for the action.\n\nKumaon battalions were deployed and fought on both the Eastern and the Western fronts during the war.\n\nThe Indian Army's initiative to hold the Siachen Glacier consisted of units of the Kumaon Regiment and the Ladakh Scouts. It was led by Maj. R.S. Sandhu, who was awarded the Vir Chakra for his leadership. Capt. Sanjay Kulkarni's unit was the first to land on Bilafond La and hoist the Indian tricolour. Kumaon units were instrumental in Indian success in capturing the glacier and repelling Pakistani attempts to retake it.\n\nAnticipating a Pakistani attack on the glacier at the start of the spring thaw in 1984, a full Kumaon battalion led by Lt. Col. (later Brigadier) D.K. Khanna, marched on foot with full packs and equipment for weeks in the dead of the winter across Zoji La, through the world's toughest terrain, highest altitudes and most forbidding climate. To their credit they achieved this without suffering a serious casualty or a single fallout en route. They also became the first battalion to operate as a unit in the Nubra Valley and on the Siachen Glacier.\n\n19 Kumaon was the first battalion to hoist the Indian flag on the Saltoro Ridgeline (at Point 5705, an altitude of 18,717 feet) in the face of enemy fire, thus dominating Gyongla (18,655 feet) which was under enemy occupation. On 29 May 1984, 19 Kumaon lost 19 of its best soldiers, including one officer (2Lt. P.S. Poondir), who had volunteered to obey orders which they fully knew could take them to their certain death. During April and May 1984, 19 Kumaon was spread all through the area of Siachen with Capt. Roshan Lal Yadav at the Indira Col, Maj. Shashi Kant Mahajan and Maj. Darshan Lal Julka on the Central Glaciers (Gyongla, Zingrulma Lagongma, and Layogma Glaciers) and Maj. Rajender Singh Hooda in the Urdelop Glacier. 19 Kumaon was thus the first battalion ever to be spread out so much on the glacier (about 100 km), which, perhaps, no other battalion has been subjected to ever since.\n\nNk. (later Subedar/Honorary Captain) Ram Mehar Singh was awarded the Shaurya Chakra for his gallant role during the move. This turned out to be a vital move that enabled Indian victory in Operation Meghdoot.\n\nKumaon units were deployed to Sri Lanka during Operation Pawan. A Kumaon battalion was the first Indian Army unit to land in Jaffna at the Palali airfield. It successfully cleared the Kokuvil area, and moving to Mallakam. A number of LTTE militants were killed or captured.\n\nAnother battalion was deployed to search and destroy LTTE camps in the Kumurupiddi and Irrakandi areas of the Trincomalee Sector. Among the areas in which Kumaon units were deployed and operated included Kilividdi of Muttur Sector, Sampur, Vellvutturai and Point Pedro.\n\nKumaon units were deployed during Operation Vijay to oust Pakistan Army regulars who had infiltrated the Kargil sector in Ladakh posing as insurgents. In difficult terrain and hostile weather conditions, they cleared and captured a number of altitude features. The regiment was honored with a number of gallantry awards for the operations.\n\n\nOthers:\n\nThe Kumaon Regiment also has affiliated to it three battalions of the Naga Regiment, a Navy ship and an Air Force Squadron.\n\nThe list of battle and theatre honours of the Kumaon Regiment are as follows :\nNagpore – Maheidpoor – Nowah – Central India – Burma 1885-87 – China 1900 – Afghanistan 1919.\nNeuve Chapelle - France and Flanders 1914-15 – Suez Canal – Egypt 19l5-16 – Gaza – Jerusalem – Megiddo – Sharon – Nablus – Palestine 1917-18 – Tigris 1916 – Khan Baghdadi – Mesopotamia 1915-18 – Persia 1915-18 – Suvla – Landing at Suvla – Scimitar Hill – Gallipoli 1915 – Macedonia 1916-18 – E Africa 1914-16 – NW Frontier India 1914-15, 1916–17\nNorth Malaya – Slim River – \"Malaya 1941-42\" – Kangaw – Bishenpur – \"Burma 1942-45\"\n\nThe regiment has won 2 Param Vir Chakras, 4 Ashoka Chakras, 10 Maha Vir Chakras, 6 Kirti Chakras, 2 Uttam Yudh Seva Medals, 78 Vir Chakras, 1 Vir Chakra & Bar, 23 Shaurya Chakras, 1 Yudh Seva Medal, 127 Sena Medals, 2 Sena Medals and Bar, 8 Param Vishisht Seva Medals, 24 Ati Vishisht Seva Medals, 1 PV, 2 PB, 1 PS, 1 AW and 36 Vishisht Seva Medals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The craft was the driving force behind the popularization of beachcats and was recently inducted into the Sailing Hall Of Fame.\n\nIntroduced in 1971, the Hobie 16 is the second largest boat fleet in existence with over 135,000 boats built to date.\n\nThe boat is distinctly recognized for its asymmetric \"banana\" shaped hulls, designed to work without the need for daggerboards so the catamaran could be run up the beach without worry. The rudders kick up automatically by lifting up on the tiller crossbar.\n\nThe Hobie 16 is manufactured in France by the Hobie Cat company, and by the Hobie Cat of America company in the United States.\n\nThe Hobie 16 normally carries two sails, the mainsail and the jib. There is a kit to allow an H16 to fly a spinnaker but this is only class legal for youth racing.\n\nEach hull has two pylons (the forward ones are vented to allow the pressure inside the hull to equalise) and the frame fits onto these pylons. The frame consists of four aluminium alloy beams which slot into four aluminium alloy corner castings and are secured with rivets. The trampoline slots along the inside of the beams and is tensioned by rope or shock cord. \n\nEarlier masts were one piece, of aluminium alloy, but were changed to two pieces with a non-conductive composite fiberglass tip (known as \"comptip\"), after a few people in the United States of America were electrocuted trying to raise masts under power lines and their families sued Hobie Cat. The mast foot casting forms a ball which steps into a cup-shaped shoe riveted onto the forward crossmember and there is a Teflon disk separating the two. The downward compressive force from the mast is partially carried by the crossmember and partially by a stainless steel compression post and tensioned tie rod assembly called a \"dolphin striker\".\n\nThe H16 may be equipped with two trapeze wires either side to allow both the helm and crew to trapeze. \"Cat seats\" can be fitted to allow disabled sailors to sail the H16.\n\nThe rudder assembly consists of a rudder on each hull fitted to a Hobie-patented automatically releasing stock comprising a casting, a cam, and a spring-loaded plunger. This allows the rudders to spring up when they hit ground, to avoid damage. The rudders are connected to two short tillers which are in turn attached via a ball and socket joint to a connecting rod called the tiller bar. The tiller attaches to the centre of the tiller bar and is typically extendable for operation while trapezing.\n\nThe mainsheet has a maximum of a 6:1 purchase and has a traveller that allows movement over the entire aft crossmember of the frame. The jib sheets are of a 2:1 purchase and attach on the front beams with their own two travellers.\n\nThe boat has a 3:1 purchase downhaul (upgradable to 6:1) to tension the mainsail and an outhaul (standard 1:1, upgradable to 2:1) to flatten the mainsail along the boom. Both the mainsail and jib are fully battened.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1895623", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1895623", "title": "History of Swansea", "text": "History of Swansea\n\nThe history of Swansea, Wales covers a period of continuous occupation stretching back a thousand years, while there is archaeological evidence of prehistoric human occupation of the surrounding area for thousands of years before that.\n\nSwansea () – occupying a position at the mouth of the River Tawe and adjacent to an extensive bay at the western end of the Bristol Channel – was the main town of its region for much of the Mediaeval period. In the 18th century, local dignitaries attempted to establish it as a tourist resort. The town achieved greater prominence with the onset of the Industrial Revolution. Mirroring similar population explosions in the South Wales Valleys, Swansea's population rose from 6,000 to 17,000 between the Censuses of 1801 and 1851. Industry grew throughout the 19th century, drastically changing the shape and even geography of the town and its surroundings. In the 20th century, industry declined but the town continued to grow in population. Swansea officially gained city status in 1969.\n\nThe oldest known remains on the Gower Peninsula are the Red Lady of Paviland: human bones dating from 22,000 BC. Later inhabitants also left their mark on the land. Examples include the Bronze Age burial mound at Cillibion and the Iron Age hill fort, Cil Ifor. Isolated prehistoric artifacts have been found in the area the city proper occupies, but there are far more on Gower. The remains of a Roman villa were also excavated on Gower.\n\nBy the late 10th century, the region, including the land around the bay and the Gower, was part of the Welsh kingdom of Deheubarth under Maredudd ap Owain. The Vikings arrived sometime between the 9th and 11th centuries, leaving behind their name for a settlement in the area. The precise nature and location of this settlement are still disputed. Spellings such as \"Swensi\", \"Sweni\" and \"Svenshi\" are found on coins minted around 1140,\n\nThe Welsh name, \"Abertawe\", translates to \"Mouth of the Tawe\". It first appears 1150 as \"Aper Tyui\".\n\nIn the wake of the Norman Conquest and Norman invasion of Wales, Gower became a marcher lordship which included not only the peninsula itself but also the land to the east as far north as the Aman river and east to the river Tawe. This included the site of Swansea town, which was designated the capital of the area. Although Kilvey Hill is to the east of the Tawe, the manor of Kilvey was also associated with Gower. The new Norman lords encouraged English immigration into the area. This immigration was largely from the West Country.\n\nA turf and timber motte and bailey castle was erected in Swansea in 1106 and was assailed by the local Welsh ten years later (and several more times in the following century). The original castle was subsequently rebuilt in stone. The Braose family—memorialised in local placenames and road names today as de Breos—possessed Gower in the 13th century but preferred to live at Oystermouth Castle. The Gower lordship seems not to have been the main priority of most of the family, who took a full share in the robust politics of the day: see Reginald de Braose, John de Braose, and William de Braose for further details.\n\nThe South Wales Coalfield reaches the coast in this region, and coal was being exported by the year 1550, along with great quantities of limestone, quarried in the Mumbles area and on Gower and in high demand as fertiliser. Swansea was already a significant port, and although it was small (perhaps 1000 people in 1560), it had one of the earliest town charters granted in Wales and a constant influx of migrants from the Welsh countryside: this influx occasioned a protest from the borough of Swansea in 1603 (Davies, p267).\n\nThe population at this time was concentrated around the castle and river. Despite small-scale coal mining, the bulk of the area beyond the town was still largely farmland. Swansea Bay was considered an attractive region. In the 18th century, some local notables wanted to direct future development into promoting it as a resort. Their plans were frustrated by the rapid development of industry in the area.\n\nBy weight, more coal than copper ore is needed for the process of smelting copper from the ore, so it is more economical to build the smelter near the coal source. Swansea had very local mines, a navigable river, a nearby supply of limestone (necessary as flux), and trading links across the Bristol Channel to Cornwall and Devon, sources of copper ore.\n\nAs the Industrial Revolution took off, a series of works were built along the Tawe river from 1720 onwards and a series of mines were opened. Initially, the smelting works concentrated on copper. Coal was brought down to them by waggonways and tramways; copper ore was brought on ships which could sail right up to the works; the resulting copper was exported out again. Swansea had become \"\"Copperopolis\"\", processing at its peak as much as 70% of the world’s copper, and the lower Tawe valley became a mass of industry.\n\nMore and more riverside wharfs were built. Tramways, waggonways and railways proliferated and connected the different works and the collieries supplying them. Today's Hafod was originally the village of Vivianstown (Vivian & Sons owned the Hafod Copper Works); and Morriston was founded c. 1790 (the exact date is unclear) by the Morris family who owned the Cambrian Works among other properties. \"\"By 1750, the Swansea district was providing half the copper needs of Britain\"\" (Davies, p 316).\n\nThe Cambrian Works closed down as a smelter but reopened as a pottery in 1764: pottery-making is another industry which requires vast quantities of coal (available locally) and clay and flint (available from the West Country, readily accessible by water). The Glamorgan Pottery was founded in 1813 by the ex-manager of the Cambrian Pottery, right next door to it and in direct competition with it. Not only the managers of the potteries but many of the workers came originally from Staffordshire. Examples of Swansea pottery can be seen today at the Glynn Vivian Art Gallery and at Swansea Museum\n\nOne of the most well-known pieces of Swansea's history began life at this stage: the Mumbles Railway. This started in the first decade of the 19th century as an industrial tramway: a horse pulling a cart along tramplates. It had a specific branch line into Clyne valley where Sir John Morris, one of the railway's owners, owned coal mines. Despite some early journeys made by tourists, it was not until the 1860s that the railway began to carry passengers regularly, by which time it had acquired rails instead of tram plates.\n\nAs the town expanded, gates put up by the local turnpike trust were no longer on the outskirts of town but in the town itself. Originally travel between Swansea and other towns or villages had involved paying tolls. Now, travel around the town itself required toll money. This was naturally an unpopular development, and in 1843, Swansea inhabitants made their own contribution to the Rebecca Riots, burning the Ty Coch gate in St Thomas. In the same year, workers from all the copper works in Swansea went on strike after their wages were cut. They returned to work five weeks later, having failed to restore their wages. The strike must have been born of desperation. It was known that John Henry Vivian, one of the owners of the copperworks, was no supporter of workers' rights: he had blacklisted men involved in earlier disturbances.\n\nCivil disturbances were a regular feature of the 1840s in Swansea. This was the period of the Rebecca Riots, of Chartism in the valleys to the east with the Merthyr Rising and the Newport Rising, and general discontent. Huge crowds would gather when those suspected of involvement in Rebecca activities were brought to the station house, and the riot was provoked when one suspect was arrested on the Sabbath (Molloy). At this time, Colonel James Frederick Love commanded militia who were billeted in Swansea, and (in 1843):\n\n\"Colonel Love had serious problems in deciding how best to stretch his resources. And stretched they were, because it was equally clear that Swansea needed to be strongly garrisoned to cope with violent incursions by unemployed coal and iron workers and discontented country-people, as would Llanelli when the Gwendraeth Valley troubles reached their climax in the following two months. And all the time the Chartist threat hung over the industrial areas to the east.\"\n\nIn this early part of the 19th century, the area which is now Brynmill, Sketty, the Uplands and the university campus was where several of the owners of the \"manufactories\" lived, in large park-like estates well to the west of the Tawe. The workers were crammed along the banks of the Tawe and lived in poor conditions. The prevailing wind carried the smoke from the copper works to the east, towards St Thomas and Kilvey. A contemporary report written by a doctor describing Swansea Valley speaks of a nightmare landscape, \"\"literally burnt\"\" where few plants would grow, dotted with lifeless pools, slag heaps, mounds of scoriae and smoke from the works everywhere. George Borrow, later to write and publish his Wild Wales, visited the town in the same year, describing it slightly less emphatically as \"\"a large, bustling, dirty, gloomy place\"\". He was not convinced that Swansea people were in fact Welsh. \"\"The women had much the appearance of Dutch fisherwomen; some of them were carrying huge loads on their heads.\"\"\n\nThe population of the town of Swansea had already increased from 6000 in 1801 to 17,000 in 1851 (Campbell). By 1881, the borough's population was over 65,000. Much of the growth was due to immigration - in 1881 more than a third of the borough's population had been born outside Glamorgan, and just under a quarter outside Wales.\n\nWriting in 1860, John Murray reports \"To the traveller who crosses the Llandore bridge at night, the livid glare from the numerous chimneys, the rolling, fleecy, white clouds that fill up the valley beneath him, the desolate-looking heaps of slag on either side, might well recalls Dante's line - \"voi che entrate lasciate ogni speranza\" \" and records \"there are no trees, and instead of grass a yellow sickly growth of chamomile scarcely covers the ground\".\n\nThe contrast between the living conditions of workers and their employers the mine-owners and Ironmasters was stark, although entertainment interests sometimes overlapped: both workers and employers flocked to the Swansea horse races, for example, held at Crymlyn Burrows. In addition to the racing, this was also the scene of boxing, gambling, cock-fighting, shows and drinking—apparently the temperance movement had not yet taken hold. Swansea also became a focus for literary and cultural life in South Wales. In 1835 a philosophical and literary society was established, which became the Royal Institution of South Wales in 1841, based in the first purpose-built museum building in Wales. Swansea hosted the annual meetings of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1848 and 1880 (Miskell, 2004).\n\nIn order to allow boats to dock without running aground at low tide and to remain afloat, the \"Float\" was constructed: the Tawe was diverted and a new dock with locks created. Work began in 1852, and the result was New Dock in 1859. Further changes to the docks were proposed, and the town authorities realised the potential grave effect on public health, particular in the riverside St Thomas area. Drinking water came from springs locally but clean water sources were increasingly rare. Cholera broke out in 1832; and again in 1849.\n\nThere was no sewerage system in Swansea until 1857 and the water supply in areas above the reservoir level was \"\"in many cases of a questionable character\"\" (contemporary report quoted by Dean). The Lliw reservoir of 1863 helped provide clean water, but drainage of dirty water was still a problem.\n\nIn 1865, Swansea suffered an epidemic of yellow fever, the only outbreak of that disease on the British mainland. A cargo of copper ore from Cuba was landed in exceptionally hot weather in September, and with it a number of infected mosquitoes. In a month, 27 inhabitants were infected and 15 died.\n\nSwansea saw yet another outbreak of cholera in 1866 and the local authorities were eventually forced by legislation to act. The only way to improve some areas was wholesale slum clearance, and this was the solution imposed in several regions of Swansea, notably Greenhill (current Dyfatty and Alexandra Road area), an area with massive overcrowding and consequent disproportionate incidence of cholera cases. It was populated largely by Irish immigrants, many of whom had fled the potato famines. Several of the landlords of Greenhill making great profits from their rents, and who required recompense for the loss of their properties, were local dignitaries, including Lewis Llewelyn Dillwyn, MP. (Dean)\n\nSewage and pollution were also part of the cause of the decline of the oyster trade centred on Mumbles, also known as Oystermouth. Kilvert's diary described a thriving and ancient industry in 1872; within five years, it had almost completely collapsed.\n\nThe construction of the Taff Vale Railway and the Bute West Dock in the 1840s resulted in Cardiff surpassing Swansea as the principal coal port in South Wales, and by 1871 Cardiff's population exceeded that of Swansea. In the late 19th century, Swansea copper smelters faced increased foreign competition, and some of the leading smelters in the region diversified into other non-ferrous metals. In the ferrous sector, rapid growth in demand for tinplate - particularly in the USA - facilitated a local boom; the imposition of the McKinley Tariff in 1891 caused a significant fall in production, but tinplate continued to be a significant local economic activity into the first half of the 20th century, with demand buoyant during the two world wars.\n\nDuring the second world war, Swansea's Queen's Dock was one end of the world's first test of a full-scale submarine oil pipeline, in Operation Pluto. Swansea was a target for Nazi German bombing raids due to its industries, the port, and railways. By the end of the so-called Three Nights' Blitz, three consecutive nights of particularly intensive bombing in February 1941, the town centre was flattened, along with many residential streets. Rebuilding post-war was in typical British nineteen-fifties style and much of the result is regarded with high favour by neither residents nor visitors. One consequence of the bombing and rebuilding is the movement of the town centre by about half a mile. Pre-war, the town centre was on an axis around High Street and Wind Street. Post-war, Oxford Street and the new road the Kingsway took more prominence.\n\nThe Mumbles Railway was closed in 1960. By 1960, industry in the valley was in steep decline and the landscape was littered with abandoned metalworks and the waste from them. The Lower Swansea Valley Scheme was started: an attempt to reclaim the polluted land into something usable. The Enterprise Zone at Llansamlet is built on part of this land. Further down the river, the Tawe was diverted—again—and the Parc Tawe development sits on top of the old North Dock. The old South Dock area now holds the Leisure Centre and Marina.\n\n\n\n"}

Construction of the stadium began in 1993, and it was complete and ready for the opening ceremony in July 1996, where it hosted track and field events and the closing ceremony. After the Olympics and Paralympics, it was reconstructed into the baseball-specific Turner Field, used by the Atlanta Braves of Major League Baseball for 20 seasons (1997–2016). After the Braves departed for Truist Park, the facility was purchased by Georgia State University, which rebuilt the stadium a second time as Georgia State Stadium, designed for American football.\n\nDuring the week-long athletics program, the stadium bore witness to Donovan Bailey of Canada winning the 100 m in a world record time of 9.84 s; Michael Johnson winning both the 200 and 400 metres titles, breaking the 200 m world record in the process; and France's Marie-José Pérec also winning the 200/400 double. Meanwhile, Carl Lewis won his fourth consecutive Olympic title in the long jump, becoming only the second person, after Al Oerter, to win the same athletics event at four consecutive Games.\n\nAfter the closing ceremony of the 1996 Paralympics, the stadium was officially leased by the Atlanta Braves. Private entities, including NBC and other Olympic sponsors, agreed to pay a large sum of the cost to build Centennial Olympic Stadium (approximately $170 million of the $209 million bill). The Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG) sought to build the stadium in a way that it could be converted to a new baseball stadium, and ACOG paid for the conversion. This was considered a good agreement for both the Olympic Committee and the Braves, because there would be no use for a permanent 85,000 seat track and field stadium in Downtown Atlanta since the 71,000 seat Georgia Dome had been completed 4 years earlier by the state of Georgia and became the home of the National Football League's Atlanta Falcons. The Braves had already been exploring opportunities for a new venue to replace Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium. \n\nThe southwest corner of the Olympic Stadium was built to accommodate the future baseball infield and seating; in the Olympic configuration of the stadium, the seats are not placed next to the oval running track. The southwest part of the stadium also had four tiers of seats, luxury boxes, a facade facing the street, and a roof, whereas the north half of the stadium used a simpler two-tiered seating configuration. During reconstruction, the athletics track was removed and relocated to the field hockey stadium located at Clark Atlanta University, which uses it for athletics and football, and the north half of the stadium was demolished, reducing the capacity to 49,000. Because of the need to fit a track within the stadium in its earlier incarnation, the field of play, particularly foul territory, while not large by historical standards, was nonetheless larger than that of most MLB stadiums built since 1990. Reconstruction was complete in 1997, and the facility was renamed Turner Field. Afterward, Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium, the Braves' previous home and the venue for the Olympics baseball events, was imploded and the site became a parking lot for Turner Field. The Atlanta Fulton County Recreation Authority owned Turner Field, and the Atlanta Braves occupied the revised stadium until the expiration of their lease in 2016; the Braves moved to Truist Park in Cobb County in the following year. Georgia State University acquired Turner Field and its surrounding parking lots in January 2017 for a mixed use expansion of the Georgia State campus, which includes private and student housing, academic, retail, and office space in addition to the redevelopment of the former ballpark into Georgia State Stadium. \n\nThe Atlanta Track Club's annual Father's Day four-mile (6.4 km) road race ends inside the stadium near the warning track where the finish line was located for the Olympics.\n\n"}

{"id": "1895640", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1895640", "title": "Xinjiang coins", "text": "Xinjiang coins\n\nThere are various kinds of Xinjiang coins produced throughout the history of Xinjiang using the styles of contemporary Chinese cash coins as well as Persian and Islamic coinages. As not many records exist from the ancient monarchies of Xinjiang the study of its coinage has determined when which rules reigned and the state of the economy based on metallurgical analyses.\n\nAmong the earliest coins made in the Tarim Basin were the so-called \"horse coins\" of the \"Yu Tian\" kingdom near modern Hotan, also known as the \"Sino-Kharosthi coins of Khotan\". These were struck around the second and third centuries with a horse image on one side and legends in Han (Chinese) and Kharosthi scripts. \n\nCoins with both Chinese and Karoshthi inscriptions have been found in the southern Tarim Basin.\n\nCast coins made in imitation of Chinese coins were also produced in the Tarim Basin. The kingdom of Qiuzi (near modern Kucha) produced coins similar to the Chinese \"Wu Zhu\" pieces (see Kucha coinage).\n\nIn the Chu valley in Central Asia Tang dynasty era Chinese coins continued to be copied and minted after the Chinese left the area.\n\nAn indelible impression was left on eastern Xinjiang's administration and culture in Turfan by the Chinese Tang rule which consisted of settlements, and military farms in addition to the spread of Chinese influence such as the sancai three colour glaze in Central Asia and Western Eurasia, in Xinjiang there was continued circulation of Chinese coins.\n\nThe title Malik al-Mashriq wa'l-Ṣīn was bestowed by the 'Abbāsid Caliph upon the Tamghaj Khan, the Samarqand Khaqan Yūsuf b. Ḥasan and after that coins and literature had the title Tamghaj Khan appear on them and were continued to be used by the Qarakhanids and the Transoxania-based Western Qarakhanids and some Eastern Qarakhanid monarchs, so therefore the Kara-Khitan (Western Liao)'s usage of Chinese things such as Chinese coins, the Chinese writing system, tablets, seals, Chinese art products like porcelein, mirrors, jade and other Chinese customs were designed to appearl to the local Central Asian Muslim population since the Muslims in the area regarded Central Asia as former Chinese territories and viewed links with China as prestigious and Western Liao's rule over Muslim Central Asia caused the view that Central Asia was a Chinese territory to reinforce upon the Muslims; \"Turkestan\" and Chīn (China) were identified with each other by Fakhr al-Dīn Mubārak Shāh with China being identified as the country where the cities of Balāsāghūn and Kashghar were located.\n\nMuslim writers wrote that \"Tamghājī silver coins\" (sawmhā-yi ṭamghājī) were present in Balkh while tafghājī was used by the writer Ḥabībī, the Qarakhānid leader Böri Tigin (Ibrāhīm Tamghāj Khān) was possibly the one who minted the coins.\n\nIn the Turfan Basin, the Buddhist Uyghur Kingdom of Qocho also cast coins in Chinese style, but with Old Uyghur language legends. The preceding city-state of Gaochang made its own coins in Chinese style, with the legend \"Gao Chang Ji Li\" (高昌吉利, \"Gāochāng jí lì\").\n\nIn the Tarim Basin, (in present-day Xinjiang), Islamic, Arabic-language coins were struck under the Kara-Khanid Khanate, Chagatai Khanate, Sayyidiya (Yarkand or Moghul Khanate), and even by the Buddhist Dzungar Khanate. The Dzungars minted pūl (a red copper coin).\n\n \n\nChina's Qing (Manchu) dynasty began casting coins in the far-Western region of Xinjiang (Chinese for \"The New Frontier\", sometimes transliterated as Sinkiang) in 1760, only one year after the Qianlong Emperor's generals conquered the region's capitols of Kashgar and Yarkand. Not only did this primarily Muslim and Turkic-speaking region represent a distinct cultural landscape for the empire, but also a special economic environment. The many differences between the coinages of Xinjiang and the rest of China reflected the special demands of governing this area. The coins cast in Xinjiang were made from copper, rather than the brass used for the rest of the empire's coinage, leading to the nickname \"red cash.\" These copper coins were valued at five of the standard cash, and provided some continuity with the monetary system used under the region's previous rulers, the Dzungar Oirat Mongol Dzungar Khanate. Most of the red cash also displayed mint names in the local Turki language. The coins had writing in Chinese, Manchu, and Turki. Lying far from the empire's center, Xinjiang was somewhat loosely governed by the court, and this is reflected in the great variety of coin types produced, some of them quite innovative. In spite of frequent rebellions and invasions, the coinage of red cash continued on and off through the nineteenth century and into the beginning of the twentieth. The final examples of red cash were cast in 1909 in the name of the Last Emperor, Puyi, using the same casting technology employed by Chinese mints for 2000 years.\n\nThe red cash of Xinjiang are quite popular among Chinese collectors for their abundance of unusual types, and for their connection to the Silk Road and Western Regions history and mythology. Some of the coins of Qing Xinjiang represent surprising breaks from Chinese coinage traditions. Most types are trilingual, and errors were abundant. Among the numerous types of red cash there are both great rarities and common pieces with strong historical significance.\n\nMachine-struck coins were introduced in the late 19th century and at first were produced alongside the cast coins.\n\n\n"}

In the previous election, in 1985, the Social Democratic Party had won a minority government managing to survive in coalition with the Democratic and Social Center and the Democratic Renewal Party, and after the approval of a no-confidence motion from the left-wing parties, with the aid of the Democratic Renewal Party, the government fell and Mário Soares, the President at the time, called for a new election.\n\nThe PSD was elected to a landslide majority government—the biggest that a Portuguese party had ever won in a free election. Although the PSD was very popular going into the election, the size of its victory far exceeded the party's most optimistic expectations. The left-wing Democratic Unity Coalition lost some of its MPs to the Socialist Party and the Democratic Renovator Party lost almost all of its influence, mainly due to its responsibility in the fall of the former government. The right-wing Democratic and Social Center lost almost half of its vote share, due to the effect of tactical voting for the also right-wing, Social Democratic Party.\n\nEuropean elections were held on the same day.\n\nThe Assembly of the Republic has 250 members elected to four-year terms. Governments do not require absolute majority support of the Assembly to hold office, as even if the number of opposers of government is larger than that of the supporters, the number of opposers still needs to be equal or greater than 126 (absolute majority) for both the Government's Programme to be rejected or for a motion of no confidence to be approved.\n\nThe number of seats assigned to each district depends on the district magnitude.

{"id": "1895659", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1895659", "title": "Enjoi", "text": "Enjoi\n\nEnjoi is a skateboarding company that produces skateboard decks as the brand's primary product; the company also manufactures skateboarding accessories and clothing. The company, distributed by Dwindle Distribution, has, since inception, been known for its humorous and satirical designs and has adopted a stylized panda as its logo.\n\nThe company was founded in 2000 by professional skateboarder Marc Johnson with the support of Rodney Mullen—both had previously been teammates in a company founded by Mullen and Steve Rocco (Rocco is the founder of World Industries and co-founded Dwindle Distribution with Mullen), the A-Team (later described by Johnson as \"a completely fabricated team based on marketing\";) In an online interview with the independent skateboard website, 48 Blocks, Johnson explained the dissolution of the A-Team:\nLet's just say that parts of it were weird, but I already had a good friendship with Gershon [Mosley], and of course [Dave] Mayhew from Maple, and Rodney [Mullen] was just awesome in so many different aspects. So the dynamic was fine. I think the problem was the lack of a solid direction, and it seemed to me that A-team ended up being an avenue for some of us to later do projects that felt more natural to us individually. When I called Rodney to quit, it was actually really funny, because we all quit pretty much the same week, but no one told anyone else they were going to quit.\n\nJohnson later revealed that both the panda image and the name \"Enjoi\" were derived from a dream that he experienced. The new company leader proceeded to recruit friends with whom he regularly skated with, including former Maple teammates, Jerry Hsu, Louie Barletta, and Dave Mayhew—Mayhew had also ridden for the A-Team (Mayhew's \"D3\" signature model skate shoe, produced with the Osiris shoe company, is considered the best-selling skate shoe of all time; however, Osiris cofounder/coowner, Tony Magnusson, denied this claim in a 2012 interview) Other professional skateboarders from this era of the company were Bobby Puleo and Chris Cole, who has won the highly regarded \"Skater of the Year\" award twice from \"Thrasher Magazine\" reflecting on the early stage of his career, Cole stated in a 2009 \"Thrasher\" interview:\nI really like enjoi. The brand is a breath of fresh air. I was on the East and detached from any team member so I was kind of a guy who rode the products, but not on the team. Especially ’cause they are a group of friends. I hung out with Marc Johnson a couple times. He was totally cool. I have always been a huge fan of his, so that was great.\n\nHsu was aged 15 when first met Johnson, who was 19 years old at the time. Hsu explained: \"he [Johnson] seemed so much older, than, nineteen. I remember meeting him and thinking he was like twenty-eight, or something; like an older guy, just 'cause of the way he acted.\" Hsu further explained that Johnson became a mentor figure to him and passed on insight that he had gained from being involved in the skateboarding industry. Regarding his time at the helm of the company, Johnson explained:\nI had something to say; every month I had something to say. Whether it was, like, a little weird or dark ... sometimes I would make an ad because I was pissed off that day. I really like what I was doing at Enjoi, almost, almost to a point where it became, like, obsessive. Sitting up and working on, like, a series of board for, like, like, twenty-four hours straight; like, I'm sure a lot of people are, like, \"Oh, didn't you own Enjoi?\" ... no, no, I didn't own shit. I just, like, worked, and did, I laid out ads, I did some catalogue stuff, and I did board graphics ... I don't know if there's a title for it—\"ideas person\"? ... I was so fucking busy, that I didn't have time to skate.\n\nJohnson eventually left the company to join the Chocolate skateboard company. Johnson later explained that the reason for his departure was that double-checking every brand decision \"got really old, really fast.\" Johnson also describes in a 2010 episode of the online episodic series, \"Epicly Later'd\", produced by Vice Media, the period leading up to his decision to leave Enjoi permanently:\n... what am I killing myself for, you know? These guys don't care; they don't care if I fucking take a shit on a board and, and, fucking, put their name on it, and, and, whatever. I'm sure I'll hear some complaints, but ... it just got to the point where \"nothing I do matters.\" And here's the story ... I had just gotten into town, we went filming that night, I got every, I pulled everything out of the car, set up the lights, did the generators and all this. We lit up this ledge. One of the filmers, Matt Eversole, was grumpy 'cause he didn't wanna go filming. there's a bunch of us about to skate and dude takes a fucking piss, on the ledge; it was a painted ledge. He peed all over the fucking ledge. And, I swear to god, this guy, Jesse Erikson, wanted to kill him, right then and there. But I looked at that as a fucking sure sign: \"You don't need to fucking be here anymore! They don't give a fuck about anything you do.\"\n\nHsu has stated, on his behalf, that he did care when Johnson left and explained, \"I knew he was unhappy, because he basically did all of the art direction, and he was being a pro skater, and he also wanted, it was like his little baby, so he was trying to take care of it, you know? And it was too much for him. He just wanted to skate.\" Hsu further stated that he seriously considered leaving Enjoi after Johnson's departure and that \"everyone knew that I wanted to leave\". Eversole subsequently decided that he would assume Johnson's role and, according to Hsu, Eversole and Barletta met with Hsu in order to convince Hsu to remain with the company.\n\nMullen cofounded the Almost skateboard company in 2004 (with fellow professional skateboarder Daewon Song) following his time with Enjoi.\n\nEnjoi released its first full-length video, \"Bag of Suck\", in 2006 and won the Transworld \"Skate Video of the Year\" award in 2007—Jerry Hsu also won the \"Best Video Part\" award at the same ceremony.\n\nEnglish skateboarder Ben Raemers was recruited as an amateur team member in September 2009. An introductory video was included in the \"Fall 09\" catalog.\n\nOn December 17, 2012, an eighteen-minute video, entitled \"Tweak the Beef\", was released by the company in conjunction with \"Thrasher\" magazine. A trailer was released on the \"Thrasher\" website on December 12, 2012, with the following brief: \"The new enjoi video is shrouded in mystery, and there's rumors of total radness. Even we don't know what we're in for. We've got the exclusive premiere, Monday, December 17.\" Upon release, the magazine introduced the premiere of the video with the following blurb: \"If you ain't having fun, then what the hell are you doing? Enjoi these next 18 minutes. They may be your last...\" The video was directed and edited by Enjoi's long-time brand manager, Matt Eversole, and features music from professional skateboarder, Tony Manfre, and American electronic music duo, Glass Candy.\n\nThe video featured new amateur riders, Zach Wallin and Ryan Lay, alongside established riders, Ben Raemers, Clark Hassler, Cairo Foster, Caswell Berry, Louis Barletta, Jerry Hsu, Jose Rojo, Nestor Judkins, and Wieger van Wagenengin. Senior team rider, Hsu, is only featured briefly in the video, with his part incorporated into Barletta's section. Leftover footage from Wallin (\"Zack's Delicious Doggy Bag\"), Barletta (\"Louie's Luscious Linguisa\"), and Foster were also uploaded onto the \"Thrasher\" website.\n\nThe origin of the video's title is alluded to in the introduction of the video, in which Berry is filmed performing a transitional trick known as a \"Roast Beef Grab\". Berry enhances the trick by emphasizing his movement while in the air—referred to as \"tweakage\" by some sections of the skateboarding community. An off-camera voice during the trick can be heard exclaiming \"Beef tweakage!\"\n\nIn a September 2012 interview for the YouTube channel, RIDE, Hsu and Barletta revealed that the company is due to release another video, as filming was occurring at the time of the interview (for the segment, \"The Weekend Buzz\", hosted by skateboarding journalists, Erica Yary and Rob Brink).\n\nFollowing the addition of Jimmy Carlin, a former rider for Jamie Thomas's Mystery brand, on September 3, 2013, Hsu announced his departure from the company. Hsu explained in an interview that was published on October 12, 2013 that his decision was spurred by the departure of longtime brand manager Matt Eversole who, according to Hsu, grew tired of protecting the brand from the profit-driven demands of shareholders. Barletta will take Eversole's place as Enjoi's brand manager and Hsu stated: \"Louie understands what Enjoi is all about, so I think they can still make something really great and I wish them the best.\"\n\nIn May 2014, Carlin stated that he parted ways with Mystery—one of the brands within Jamie Thomas's Black Box Distribution company—without any plan on a future deck sponsor. Carlin explained that he found the work ethic at Black Box too intensive and is pleased that he was able to successfully negotiate a place on the Enjoi team, as he is friends with the other riders.\n\nIn a July 2014 interview with \"Thrasher\" magazine, Foster explained that Eversole continues to work on the Tiltmode Army website, while Berry is struggling with a period of serious injuries.\n\nRaemers was assigned professional status by the brand in early October 2014. A congratulations video was published by CONS, the skateboarding arm of the Converse shoe company, on October 13, 2014, and features Raemers skateboarding in England.\n\nFollowing the publication of a trailer for \"Oververt\" on the brand's YouTube channel on October 8, 2014, the premiere date and location for Enjoi's third full-length video was announced: October 23, 2014, at Montalban Theater in Los Angeles, U.S. Barletta and Raemers appear on the cover of the December 2014 issue of \"Thrasher Magazine\", corresponding with a feature article on the making of the video. At the end of his \"Oververt\" part, Wallin was assigned professional status by Barletta, who surprises him with a \"Wallin\" skateboard deck at the completion of his trick. The corresponding print advertisement featured the tagline: \"help put clothes on zacks back buy his sticking debut pro models!\"\n\nA video released on the YouTube channel of \"Thrasher Magazine\" revealed that Barletta was one of the contenders for the 2014 Skater Of The Year trophy, alongside Ishod Wair and Bobby Worrest, among others. At the conclusion of the video, Barletta revealed that Australian skateboarder Jack Fardell is newly sponsored by enjoi.\n\nThe latest work from the Enjoi team comes in the form of a video series titled Panda Patrol. From 2017–present, the Enjoi team has uploaded a total of 10 videos to the Thrasher Magazine website, Thrasher Magazine YouTube channel, and Enjoi's own website as well. The videos feature the Enjoi team traveling to different areas such as, Taiwan, Lisbon, and Seoul, and vary on episode focus. Some episodes will focus more on a specific skater and other's will focus on the entire team. The first episode was uploaded in 2017 and the most recent was in 2020; the series has not confirmed an official number of episodes, and as of right now is still being produced.\n\nThe brand was criticized by the \"Jezebel\" website in 2004 for a sexist joke written on a clothing label that read: \"dirty laundry keeps women busy.\" They have also been criticized on Amazon and other sites for the Jerry Hsu deck graphic depicting a girl with her arm in a sling and tears in her eyes saying, \"I guess he really loves his enjoi deck more than me.\" The negative implication being that he beat her because she wanted him to value her over skateboarding.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

This colourless solid is used in organic chemistry as a hydroboration reagent. The compound exists as a hydride-bridged dimer, which easily cleaves in the presence of reducible substrates. 9-BBN is also known by its nickname 'banana borane'. This is because rather than drawing out the full structure, chemists often simply draw a banana shape with the bridging boron.\n\n9-BBN is prepared by the reaction of 1,5-cyclooctadiene and borane usually in ethereal solvents, for example:\n\nThe compound is commercially available as a solution in tetrahydrofuran and as a solid. 9-BBN is especially useful in Suzuki reactions.\n\nIts highly regioselective addition on alkenes allows the preparation of terminal alcohols by subsequent oxidative cleavage with HO in aqueous KOH.

{"id": "1895669", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1895669", "title": "Thymelaeaceae", "text": "Thymelaeaceae\n\nThe Thymelaeaceae are a cosmopolitan family of flowering plants composed of 50 genera (listed below) and 898 species. It was established in 1789 by Antoine Laurent de Jussieu. The Thymelaeaceae are mostly trees and shrubs, with a few vines and herbaceous plants.\n\nThis is not intended as a full botanical description, but only as a few notes on some of the conspicuous or unusual traits of the family when \"Tepuianthus\" is excluded. The bark is usually shiny and fibrous. Attempts to break the stem often result in a strip of bark peeling down the side. The number of stamens is usually once or twice the number of calyx lobes. If twice, then they often occur in two well separated series. Exceptions include \"Gonystylus\", which may have up to 100 stamens, and \"Pimelea\", which has only 1 or 2. The floral tube appears to be a calyx or corolla, but is actually a hollow receptacle. This feature is probably unique to Thymelaeaceae. The sepals are mounted on the rim of the floral tube. Stamens may be mounted on the rim or inside. What appear to be petals are actually stipular appendages of the sepals. The fruit is a 1-seeded berry or an achene. The 1-seeded berries have often been mistaken for drupes whenever the seed coat was mistaken for an endocarp.\n\nWhen using a key to the families of flowering plants, Thymelaeaceae are often difficult or impossible to recognize because of equivocal interpretation of the flower parts. Sepals, petals, and staminodes are hard to distinguish, and many keys are ambiguous about whether staminodes should be counted as stamens. Moreover, in \"Wikstroemia\", individual plants often produce anomalous flowers. In these, the nonfunctional organs are much deformed and bear little resemblance to the parts that they represent.\n\nA good collection of pictures of plants in this family has appeared in a scientific paper.\n\nThe family is named for the genus \"Thymelaea\", the name of which is a combination of the Greek name for the herb thyme θύμος (thúmos) and that for the olive ἐλαία (elaía) - in reference to its thyme-like foliage (i.e. minuscule leaves) and olive-like fruit.\n\nThe Thymelaeaceae are in the order Malvales. Except for a sister relationship with Tepuianthaceae, little is known for sure about their relationships with the other families in the order.\n\nUnlike most recent authors, who recognize four subfamilies, B.E. Herber has divided Thymelaeaceae into two subfamilies. He has retained the subfamily Gonostyloideae, but renamed it Octolepidoideae. The other three traditional subfamilies (Synandrodaphnoideae, Aquilarioideae, and Thymelaeoideae) were combined into a Thymelaeoideae s.l.(sensu lato), and reduced to tribal rank, as Synandrodaphneae, Aquilarieae, and Daphneae, respectively. No tribes were designated in subfamily Octolepidoideae, but it was provisionally divided into two informal groups, the Octolepis group and the Gonystylus group. Likewise, no subtribes were designated in the tribe Daphneae, but it was informally divided into four groups: the \"Linostoma\" group, the \"Daphne\" group, the \"Phaleria\" group, and the \"Gnidia\" group. The 45 genera recognized by Herber are grouped as follows. Three genera in Daphneae were placed incertae sedis (not assigned to any particular group or in a separate group by themselves).\n\nThe first molecular phylogeny for Thymelaeaceae was published in 2002. It was based on 2 regions of chloroplast DNA. These were the rbcL gene and the intergenic spacer between the transfer RNA genes trnL and trnF. Forty one species in the family were sampled. In 2008, Marline Rautenbach performed a phylogenetic study in which 143 species in the family were sampled. The sampling in this study was concentrated in the \"Gnidia\" group, but the sampling in the rest of the family was as extensive as in the previous study, or more so. In addition to rbcL and trnL-F data, sequences of the ITS (internal transcribed spacer) region of nrDNA (nuclear ribosomal DNA) were used. All of the clades that were strongly supported in the previous study were recovered with even stronger statistical support.\n\nThe tree below is an excerpt from the Rautenbach (2002) phylogeny. The species of \"Gnidia\" were chosen from among the most common or well known species in a way that shows which clades contain species of \"Gnidia\".\n\nThe circumscription of genera in Thymelaeaceae has always been especially difficult, and is to some degree, artificial. For example, the difficulty of distinguishing \"Daphne\" from \"Wikstroemia\" has been commented upon by Rautenbach and Herber. Several small genera are probably embedded in \"Daphne\" or \"Wikstroemia\", or if \"Daphne\" and \"Wikstroemia\" are intermingled, these small genera might be embedded in both simultaneously. \"Stellera\", for example, is nested within \"Wikstroemia\", at least (see the phylogenetic tree below).\n\nA recent comparison of DNA sequences has established the monophyly of \"Thymelaea\" and the polyphyly of \"Diarthron\", but there was not sufficient sampling in \"Wikstroemia\" and \"Daphne\" to exclude the possibility that \"Thymelaea\", \"Diarthron\", and others might be embedded in them.\n\nThe large genus \"Gnidia\" is polyphyletic and its species fall into 4 separate clades, each of which contains other genera of the family (see the phylogenetic tree below). The type species for \"Gnidia\" is \"Gnidia pinifolia\". If \"Gnidia\" is divided into 4 or more separate genera, the segregate genus which contains \"G. pinifolia\" will retain the name \"Gnidia\". Zachary S. Rogers published a revision of the \"Gnidia\" of Madagascar in 2009 in \"Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden\".\n\nSome of the older treatments of Thymelaeaceae recognize \"Lasiosiphon\" as a separate genus from \"Gnidia\". This distinction was later shown to be artificial. However, Van der Bank et al. (2002) suggested that \"Lasiosiphon\" might be resurrected if redefined. The type species for \"Lasiosiphon\" is \"Gnidia glauca\", formerly known as \"Lasiosiphon glaucus\".\n\nRautenbach used different names from Herber for some of the groups and placed some of the groups at different taxonomic rank, but her phylogeny supports Herber's classification with the few exceptions noted below. The only strongly supported difference (99% (bootstrap percentage) from Herber's classification was that \"Dais\" was found to be sister to \"Phaleria\". The phylogeny casts significant doubt upon the monophyly of the subfamily Octolepidoideae, and upon the monophyly of the informal \"Octolepis\" and \"Gonostylus\" groups, but this result had only weak statistical support. Only a sampling of more species and more DNA from each will determine whether these groups are monophyletic or not. \"Stephanodaphne\" and \"Peddiea\" might need to be transferred to the \"Gnidia\" group, but support was not strong (60% BP) for a clade consisting of the \"Gnidia\" group with \"Stephanodaphne\" and \"Peddiea\". Again, more extensive sampling will be required to resolve this question. Two of the 3 genera placed incertae sedis by Herber (\"Linodendron\" and \"Lasiadenia\") have not yet been sampled and their relationships to other genera remain obscure.\n\nHerber (2003) recognized 45 genera, excluding \"Tepuianthus\" from the family, sinking \"Atemnosiphon\" and \"Englerodaphne\" into \"Gnidia\", \"Eriosolena\" into \"Daphne\", and \"Thecanthes\" into \"Pimelea\". The largest genera and the approximate number of species in each are \"Gnidia\" (160), \"Pimelea\" (110), \"Daphne\" (95), \"Wikstroemia\" (70), \"Daphnopsis\" (65), \"Struthiola\" (35), \"Lachnaea\" (30), \"Thymelaea\" (30), \"Phaleria\" (30), and \"Gonystylus\" (25).\n\n, 50 genera are accepted by the World Checklist of Thymelaceae:\nIn the past, different authors have defined Thymelaeaceae in different ways. For example, John Hutchinson excluded \"Gonystylus\" and its close relatives, as well as \"Aquilaria\" and its close relatives from the family, forming 2 segregate families: Gonystylaceae and Aquilariaceae. But today, the only controversy that still remains over the circumscription of the family is the question of whether \"Tepuianthus\" should be included, or segregated as a separate, monogeneric family. Stevens includes \"Tepuianthus\", but Kubitzki treats Tepuianthaceae as a separate family.\nThe family is more diverse in the Southern Hemisphere than in the Northern, with major concentrations of species in Africa and Australia. The genera are overwhelmingly African.\n\nSeveral genera are of economic importance. \"Gonystylus\" (Ramin) is valued for its comparatively soft, easily worked yellowish wood, but trade in all species in the genus are controlled by CITES. Many genera have inner bark yielding strong fibre suitable for the making of cordage and paper - a fact actually acknowledged in the naming of one of the genera, \"Funifera\" being the Latin for \"bearer (provider) of rope\". The barks of \"Thymelaea\", \"Edgeworthia\" and \"Wikstroemia\" are used in paper-making, while \"Lagetta\" species are known as lacebark for their lacelike inner bark, the attractive appearance of which has led to their being used to make clothing and other utilitarian objects.\n\nMany of the species (e.g. \"Wikstroemia indica\" and \"Stellera chamaejasme\") have actual or potential uses in medicine and are poisonous if eaten, acting as violent purges (e.g. \"Daphne mezereum\"), this toxicity often being related to the plants' containing phorbol esters which, as the name suggests, are also common in the spurge family Euphorbiaceae.\n\n\"Daphne\" is grown (despite the high toxicity of its attractive fruits) for its sweetly scented flowers. Species of \"Wikstroemia\", \"Daphne\", \"Phaleria\", \"Dais\", \"Pimelea\" and other genera are grown as ornamentals.\n\n"}

In this episode Garak and Bashir investigate the identity of a Cardassian boy that had been abandoned on Bajor.\n\nWhen Garak sees a Cardassian boy on Deep Space Nine, he decides to introduce himself, but the boy, Rugal, bites him on the hand. The boy has been raised by Bajoran parents and taught to hate and fear Cardassians. His adoptive parents claim that they do not consider him a Cardassian any more, but allegations of abuse lead to an investigation into the family. Gul Dukat tells Sisko that he is trying to bring orphaned Cardassians back from Bajor and that the discovery of Rugal will strengthen his case. Miles and Keiko O'Brien agree to care for Rugal during the investigation, and Rugal helps Miles overcome his prejudice against Cardassians.\n\nGarak, suspecting (or perhaps knowing) that there is more to this series of events than meets the eye, persuades Bashir to request permission from Sisko for both him and Bashir to obtain a Runabout for travel to Bajor. The request is granted after Dukat informs Sisko that Rugal is the son of a prominent Cardassian civilian politician, Kotan Pa'Dar. Garak and Bashir then travel to an orphanage that took in Cardassian orphans when the occupation of Bajor ended and investigate the orphanage's records. Garak suggests that the situation is tied to a conflict between military and civilian interests on Cardassia (Pa'Dar is a political rival of Dukat, having cost Dukat his position as prefect by ordering the Cardassian withdrawal from Bajor).\n\nBack on the station, Pa'Dar arrives to greet Rugal, but the boy does not remember him and calls Pa'Dar a \"Cardassian butcher.\" Regardless of this, Pa'Dar wants his son back, but Rugal's adoptive father refuses to relinquish him. \n\nA formal tribunal is established headed by Sisko who, by agreement, is seen to be a neutral arbiter. Dukat attends the ensuing hearing. Meanwhile, on Bajor, Garak and Bashir track down the woman who took Rugal in at the orphanage and who remembers that a Cardassian woman attached to Terok Nor (the Cardassian name for DS9) brought Rugal to her.\n\nBashir interrupts the hearing, alleging that Rugal's discovery was part of a conspiracy planned by Dukat all along: that Dukat ordered one of his subordinates to leave Rugal behind knowing that the boy would one day be found and that as a result Pa'Dar would be humiliated. Thus, the plot having been exposed, Dukat storms out of the room and Sisko awards custody of the boy to Pa'Dar, who reassures Sisko that Dukat will never reveal what happened now that he too has been humiliated. Later, Bashir and Garak sit down for lunch, and Bashir asks Garak for the truth about his history with Dukat.

{"id": "1895717", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1895717", "title": "Hahnenkamm, Kitzbühel", "text": "Hahnenkamm, Kitzbühel\n\nThe Hahnenkamm is a mountain in Europe, directly southwest of Kitzbühel in the Kitzbühel Alps of Austria. The elevation of its summit is above sea level.\n\nThe Hahnenkamm (\"German\": rooster's comb) is part of the ski resort of Kitzbühel, and hosts an annual World Cup alpine ski race, the \"Hahnenkammrennen\". The most famous slope on the Hahnenkamm is the classic downhill course, the \"Streif\" (streak, or stripe), which is regarded as the most demanding race course on the World Cup circuit. The course features highly technical, \"fall-away\" turns (reverse bank), many with limited visibility. It also contains several flat gliding sections, immediately preceded by difficult turns, placing a premium on both technical and gliding skills. A run on the mountain's northeast face, the \"Streif\" course, is mostly in the shade in January. It is usually overcast and coupled with fog, the result being \"flat\" lighting which compounds the course's difficulty.\n\nThe \"Hahnenkammrennen\" are the annual races, held since 1931 and a fixture of the men's World Cup since its inception in the 1967 season. The races were originally held in March, and sometimes in early February (1949 & 1951). Beginning in 1953, the races at Kitzbühel have been held in mid to late January, often the week following the Lauberhorn in Wengen, Switzerland, another classic downhill.\n\nSince 1959, the race has been broadcast on Austrian television.\n\nIn 2009, as well as in 2008, the total prize money was €550,000.\n\nThe Hahnenkamm races are currently held in the following disciplines:\n\nTraditionally, the winner of the Hahnenkamm race was determined by the combined results of the downhill and slalom competitions. During the World Cup era, the man most likely to be referred to as \"Hahnenkammsieger\" (champion) is the winner of the prestigious downhill race.\n\nThe Super-G made its debut at Kitzbühel in 1995, and returned as a regular event in 2000, scheduled the day before the downhill.\n\nBecause of challenging weather conditions in January at the top of the mountain, the downhill course is often not run in its entirety. In the decade of 2000–09, the \"Streif\" full course was run in only four of the ten years (2001, 2002, 2004, & 2009). Unfortunately, this often eliminates one of the most exciting jumps in ski racing, the \"Mausefalle\" (mousetrap), seconds from the top of the course. The competitors reach high speeds quickly out of the starting gate on the \"Startschuss\" and fly up to off the steep jump. Upon landing the racers experience a severe compression immediately followed by a sharp left turn, often negotiated unsuccessfully. Speeds entering the turn are .\n\nIn 2006, morning fog at the top of the course forced race organizers to lower the start to the middle of the \"Karusell\" (carousel), below the \"Mausefalle.\" This shortened the length of the course by . The downhill race was cancelled in 2005 and 2007.\n\nIn 2008, strong upwinds at the \"Mausefalle\" caused race officials to lower the start , shortening the course by . This eliminated most of the \"Startschuss\" and its instantaneous speed; the \"Mausefalle\" was accordingly altered to a speed-inducing pitch, rather than a formidable jump and compression. Though Didier Cuche won the race, the 2008 edition is likely best remembered for the high-speed crash of Scott Macartney on the \"Zielsprung\", seconds before the finish, as well as Bode Miller tying for second with Mario Scheiber after riding the safety fencing in the \"Steilhang\" section.\n\nThe full course returned in 2009, for the first time in five years, with Didier Défago of Switzerland winning the race. In addition to having the fastest time, he also had the highest speed on the \"Zielschuss\" at . It was the second consecutive downhill victory for Défago; he won the Lauberhorn downhill the previous week at Wengen to join a handful of skiers to win both classic races in consecutive weeks. It was last accomplished by Stephan Eberharter of Austria in 2002 and had been 17 years since a Swiss racer won both (1992 - Franz Heinzer). The final training run on Thursday saw the serious crash of Swiss racer Daniel Albrecht, again at the \"Zielsprung.\" It resulted in a three-week coma and Albrecht's absence from the World Cup circuit for the remainder of the 2009 season and the entire 2010 season.\n\nThe full course was run in 2010 under clear skies and again won by Didier Cuche, who had also won the Super-G the previous day. The only significant crash was by former champion Michael Walchhofer, who twisted into the net fence at the final left turn, less than 20 seconds from the finish; he was quickly back on his feet. Cuche's downhill victory was his third on the \"Streif,\" his first was in 1998 on a Friday \"extra\" race. The \"Zielsprung\" was significantly moderated in 2010 due to the serious accidents the previous two years.\n\nIn 2011, Didier Cuche won the Hahnenkamm downhill for the fourth time to tie the record with Franz Klammer. A year later, and two days after announcing his retirement at the end of the season, Cuche claimed his third consecutive downhill victory at Kitzbühel and a record fifth total.\n\nDominik Paris claimed the title in 2013 to become the second winner from Italy and the first in fifteen years.\n\nDue to lack of snow in 2014, the lower course was altered. The dramatic \"Querfahrt\" sidehill traverse and speed-inducing \"Zielschuss\" were bypassed; the racers detoured toward the \"Ganslern\" slalom slope, then rejoined the course for the final \"Rasmusleitn.\" This extended the overall length by to and reduced the finishing speed. Hannes Reichelt was the first winner from Austria in eight years.\n\nUpper mountain fog in 2015 forced the start to the Seidlalm jump, the lowest in history. Kjetil Jansrud of Norway won in less than a minute on the lower 50% of the course.\n\nHigh winds in 2016 lowered the start 40 m to the top of \"Mausefalle\". On the full course in 2017, Paris became a two-time winner.\n\nSections of the \"Streif\" downhill course include:\n\n\nThe following is a list of Hahnenkamm downhill winners, with their winning times:\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> pre-World Cup era\n\nEach downhill champion's name is affixed to a gondola car on the \"Hahnenkammbahn\" lift,which extends from the Kitzbühel base to the top of the Hahnenkamm mountain.\n\nIn the open Streif VerticalUp event, first held in 2011, participants race the Streif upwards to the start booth of the ski race, with free choice of equipment (cross-country skis, shoes with spikes, etc).\n\n\n\n"}

Unlike a lava dome, a resurgent dome is not formed by the extrusion of highly viscous lava onto the surface, but rather by the uplift and deformation of the surface itself by magma movement underground. Resurgent domes are typically found near the center of very large open calderas such as Yellowstone Caldera or Valles Caldera, and in turn such calderas are often referred to as \"resurgent-type\" calderas to distinguish them from the more common (but much smaller) calderas found on shield volcanoes and stratovolcanoes.\n\nThe structure that makes a resurgent dome possible is a fracture zone made up of ring faults surrounded by concentric normal faults around the outside of the rings. During initial formation of the caldera these ring faults provide vents for ash-flow eruptions and are the point at which subsidence of the cauldron block occurs. Subsequent magma flows then push the cauldron block back up creating the dome.\n\nIn the monitoring of volcanic hazards, resurgent domes are often intensively monitored, as an ongoing increase in elevation accompanied by seismic activity is certain evidence for magma rising beneath the surface.\n\n"}

{"id": "1895785", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1895785", "title": "The Midnight Express (professional wrestling)", "text": "The Midnight Express (professional wrestling)\n\nThe Midnight Express was a professional wrestling tag team of changing members, mostly under the management of Jim Cornette. The group started in the early 1980s with Dennis Condrey and Randy Rose (and originally Norvell Austin). The late 1980s saw a new incarnation, consisting of Bobby Eaton and Stan Lane, compete in JCP and WCW and briefly feuding with \"The Original Midnight Express\" of Condrey and Rose. In the 1990s, the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) combined Bob Holly and Bart Gunn as \"The New Midnight Express\". A combination of Condrey, Eaton and Lane occasionally compete as the Midnight Express on the independent circuit.\n\nIn 1980 a new team was formed in Southeast Championship Wrestling In an attempt to throw Rose and Condrey off, Austin adopted the masked persona of \"The Shadow\" and together with Brad Armstrong defeated Condrey and Rose for the title on May 4, 1981. After losing the title back to Condrey and Rose on July 27, 1981, Austin turned on Armstrong and joined up with Condrey and Rose to form a stable (group) known as The Midnight Express. In the book \"The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Tag Teams\" Condrey explains that the name did not stem from the movie \"Midnight Express\" (although later versions of the Midnight Express would use the film's theme by Giorgio Moroder as their theme music) but from the fact that they all dressed in black, drove black cars, and were out partying past midnight.\n\nTogether the three men won the AWA Southern Tag Team title in the CWA and invoked a rule that allowed any two of the three men to defend the titles on a given night, so that their opponents never knew what combination to expect. The Midnight Express lost the AWA Southern tag team title to Bobby Eaton and Sweet Brown Sugar before returning to SECW in the spring of 1982. Upon their return to Southeastern Championship Wrestling the Midnight Express quickly regained the Southeastern Tag Team title from Robert Fuller and Jimmy Golden on September 27, 1982. The Express then became involved in a feud with the Mongolian Stomper and his storyline son \"Mongolian Stomper Jr.\", with whom they traded the Southeastern title. The Midnight Express's next challengers were \"Dizzy Ed\" Hogan and local workhorse Ken Lucas. The two team repeatedly traded the title until the Midnight Express, repeatedly using their 3-on-2 advantage to regain the titles, finally reclaimed the championship by the end of July 1983. The Midnight Express's final feud in the SECW was with the local heroes Jimmy Golden and Robert Fuller who managed to drive the group out of SECW. After dropping the Southeastern Tag Team titles to Brad and Scott Armstrong, Austin, Condrey and Rose went their separate ways.\n\nWhen Bobby Eaton was sent to Mid-South Wrestling under promoter Bill Watts as a part of a talent trade it was decided that he should be part of the new version of the Midnight Express. Eaton teamed with former rival Dennis Condrey under the management of Jim Cornette to form a new version of the Midnight Express. The Express had up until this point been a group of wrestlers, but once Eaton and Condrey joined together the Midnight Express worked exclusively as a two-man team. To complement \"Loverboy\" Dennis Condrey, Eaton was nicknamed \"Beautiful Bobby\", a nickname he still uses. The Express was first booked in a storyline with the Mid-South Tag Team champions Magnum T.A. and Mr. Wrestling II. The highlight of the angle saw Eaton and Condrey tarring and feathering Magnum TA in the middle of the ring. Condrey and Eaton won their first tag team championship when Mr. Wrestling II turned on Magnum TA and attacked him during a match, allowing The Midnight Express to walk away with the titles without much opposition. Collectively Dennis Condrey and Bobby Eaton hold the record for the most Tag Team Titles in all of professional wrestling with 53 together; earning the right to be called the most decorated Tag Team of all time. During the Midnight's Express time in Mid-South Wendi Richter was made an honorary member in the Midnight Express by Jim Corrnette. See Title History below.\n\nWith Mr. Wrestling II and Magnum TA splitting up, the Midnight Express needed a new team to defend their newly won title against. This team was The Rock 'n' Roll Express (Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson), whom they started a long-running series of matches that would run well into the 1990s and span several wrestling promotions. The two Expresses had a series of matches which differed so much from the way tag team wrestling was traditionally presented at the time, that it gathered a lot of attention both locally and nationally. The two teams feuded throughout 1984 in Mid-South Wrestling before the Midnight Express left the promotion to work elsewhere. The Midnight Express versus Rock 'n' Roll Express series of matches was so well received by the fans that independent promoters all over the United States still book that match today, 30 years after the rivalry started.\n\nThe Midnight Express had a short stay in World Class Championship Wrestling in Texas where they feuded mainly with The Fantastics (Bobby Fulton and Tommy Rogers). When opportunities in WCCW looked to go nowhere the Midnight Express signed with Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP) in 1985, giving them national exposure through JCP's television shows that were broadcast on SuperStation TBS. Shortly after joining JCP, the Midnight Express reignited their feud with the Rock 'n' Roll Express from whom they won the NWA World Tag team titles in February 1986 on \"Superstars on the Superstation\". Eaton and Condrey lost the titles back to the Rock 'n' Roll Express six months later. Besides feuding with the Rock 'n' Roll Express, Eaton and Condrey also had long-running feuds with The New Breed (Chris Champions and Sean Royal) as well as The Road Warriors (Animal and Hawk). The feud with the Road Warriors included a high profile Scaffold Match at Starrcade 1986, which the Midnight Express lost.\nIn March 1987, Dennis Condrey suddenly left JCP without giving any reason, leaving Eaton without a partner. Bubba Rogers worked a few dates to fulfill obligations, but Dusty Rhodes made the decision to pick Stan Lane who was a singles star in Florida at the time. Tom Prichard was thought about but never officially suggested.\n\nEaton and Lane reached the semi-finals of the Crockett Cup Tag Team Tournament on April 11, 1987 in Baltimore. On May 16, 1987 the combination of Eaton and Lane won the NWA United States Tag team titles for the first time, a title they would win three times during their time together. A year later the team was cheered on despite being heels as they won the NWA World Tag Team Titles from the Horsemen Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard on September 10, 1988 (Anderson and Blanchard left NWA to go to World Wrestling Federation). The Midnight Express's title run only last a little over a month-and-a-half before the Road Warriors (who had recently turned heel on Sting) took the gold from them in a brutal match.\n\nAfter leaving JCP in 1987, Condrey reunited with Rose in the AWA, where they won the AWA World Tag Team Championship, and were managed by Paul E. Dangerously and became known as The Original Midnight Express, since Dennis Condrey and Randy Rose first teamed up in 1980. In 1988, they went to Jim Crockett Promotions. Led by longtime Jim Cornette nemesis Paul E. Dangerously, Condrey and Rose set out to prove they were better than the new version. Condrey's and Rose's surprise appearance gave Dangerously's team the initial momentum in the feud, but the promising feud was cut short when Dennis Condrey left the promotion once more before a \"loser leaves town\" match at Chi-Town Rumble. Rose teamed with Jack Victory and took the pin, leaving the promotion. Cornette contends in a shoot interview that backstage politics and animosity between the Original Midnights, promotion head Jim Crockett and head booker George Scott led to the feud being cooled off and Condrey once again leaving the promotion.\n\nDue to various differences over the direction of the Midnight Express, Cornette, Lane, and Eaton also left JCP for a short while, around the time that Ted Turner purchased the company and it was renamed World Championship Wrestling (WCW). When the issues were resolved, Cornette and the Midnight Express returned to the promotion. In the tournament to determine new World tag team champions, the Midnight Express advanced to the finals before losing to the Freebirds with some assistance from the Samoan Swat Team. They engaged in a feud with the Freebirds and Samoans until the 1989 Great American Bash, where they teamed up with the Road Warriors and Dr. Death Steve Williams to defeat the Freebirds and Samoans in a War Games match.\n\nThe Midnight Express soon turned heel as a result of a feud with the Dynamic Dudes (Johnny Ace & Shane Douglas). Jim Cornette duped the Dudes into thinking he wanted to be their manager but then turned on them during their match against the Midnight Express at Clash of the Champions IX in New York. The Dynamic Dudes gained a measure of revenge when the Midnight Express laid out an open challenge for any team for $10,000. After dispatching of a couple of no-name teams, the Express was challenged by the masked Dynamic Duo, billed from Gotham City, who pinned the Express and unmasked as Ace and Douglas. The feud soon lost steam and was forgotten soon after.\n\nAfter returning to their cheating ways, the Midnight Express started a feud with the up-and-coming team of Flyin' Brian and \"Z-Man\" Tom Zenk over the United States Tag team titles. The Express won the titles from the young team in early 1990, but lost them to The Steiner Brothers (Rick and Scott) three months later. They were then defeated by Halloween Havoc 1990 by Tommy Rich and Ricky Morton. \n\nOn October 29, 1990, the Express showed up to the next round of TV tapings only to discover they were not on the card for any of the show's. Since they were not told ahead of time, Eaton was unable to take the day off to spend time with his wife and children. Cornette, already frustrated over what he perceived as the burial of Lane and Eaton by WCW President Jim Herd, discovered the next day that the Express was booked for four matches at the October 30 taping session and they were to lose all of them. After confronting Ole Anderson, the booker at the time, over the scheduling, Cornette was told to \"go home\" if he disagreed. Calling Anderson's bluff, Cornette walked out of the room and told Lane he was leaving for good. Lane decided that he was going to quit as well, and after they bade goodbye to Eaton (who decided to stay due to his family obligations), both men left and began heading north toward North Carolina; it was not until Anderson came looking for Cornette and Lane later that he realized they had quit. So, for the first time in almost a decade, there was no Midnight Express.\n\nThe Midnight Express name was resurrected by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in the late 1990s when they put a combination of Bob Holly (as \"Bombastic Bob\") and Bart Gunn (as \"Bodacious Bart\") together as \"The New Midnight Express\" with Cornette as their manager — all as part of the \"NWA invasion\" angle. On March 30, 1998, they won the NWA World Tag Team Championship from The Headbangers, but did not achieve much more success in the WWF. Despite the name \"Midnight Express\" and having Cornette in their corner, wrestling fans consider this incarnation of the team as nothing more than a rib by Vince McMahon on Cornette, and in shoot interviews Cornette has indeed indicated that he never considered the team as continuing the lineage of the Midnight Express, since it was not his idea nor his intention to have \"glorified jobbers\" like Gunn and Holly take on the moniker (although Gunn and Holly were both former tag team champions prior to being teamed).\n\nIn 2003, Eaton worked for NWA Mid-Atlantic forming a new version of the Midnight Express with Rikki Nelson. This Midnight Express version was short-lived as Eaton soon started touring on select independent wrestling cards with Dennis Condrey (and sometimes Lane and Cornette) as the Midnight Express instead. On June 7, 2008, they lost to The Rock 'n' Roll Express (Robert Gibson and Ricky Morton) at the NWA 60th Anniversary Show in Atlanta, Georgia. In August 2011, The Midnight Express wrestled their last match as a team together against The Rock 'n' Roll Express at JCW's \"Legends & Icons\" show.\n\n\n"}
