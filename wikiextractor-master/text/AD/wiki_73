Shea was often described as \"America's beloved gospel singer\" and was considered \"the first international singing 'star' of the gospel world,\" as a consequence of his solos at Billy Graham Crusades and his exposure on radio, records and television. Because of the large attendance at Graham's Crusades, it is estimated that Shea sang live before more people than anyone else in history.\n\nGeorge Beverly Shea was born in Winchester, Ontario, Canada, on February 1, 1909, the fourth of eight children of the Rev. Adam Joseph Shea (1872–1946), a Wesleyan Methodist Church—now Wesleyan Church—minister, and his wife, Maude Mary Theodora (Whitney) Shea (1881–1971).\n\nThe Shea family served at the Wesleyan Methodist church in Winchester, Ontario, Canada; Houghton, New York (1917–1921); the Sunnyside Wesleyan Methodist church in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, from 1921; at the Willett Memorial Wesleyan Methodist Church at Midler Avenue, Syracuse, New York; and the Jersey City, New Jersey Wesleyan Methodist church during his youth.\n\nShea himself has said that he became a Christian at the age of five or six, but made a re-dedication to Christ when he was 18:\n\n[T]here were times when I needed to rededicate my life to the Lord Jesus. When I was 18, my dad was pastoring a church in Ottawa, and I was feeling not too spiritual. The church was having a \"special effort,\" as they called it, for a week. I remember that on Friday night Dad came down from the pulpit and tenderly placed his hand on my shoulder. He whispered, \"I think tonight might be the night, son, when you come back to the Lord.\" Whatever Dad did or said, I listened to him and respected him. And, yes, that was the night!\n\nShea rededicated himself to Christ at the Sunnyside Wesleyan Methodist Church in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.\n\nShea was taught to play the violin by his father, and the piano and organ by his mother. Shea's bass-baritone voice brought early recognition and provided many opportunities for him to sing in his father's church. He began singing at religious meetings in the Ottawa Valley.\n\nShea attended Annesley College in Ottawa, before transferring in 1928 to Houghton College (Houghton, New York), where he studied singing with Herman Baker. While studying at Houghton College, Shea sang with the Houghton College Glee Club. Financial difficulties made it necessary for him to terminate his studies in 1929.\n\nAfter leaving college, Shea became a clerk in the medical department in the New York City offices of the Mutual of New York Life Insurance Company, where he worked for the next nine years.\n\nShea married his childhood sweetheart, Erma L. Scharfe (1908–1976) on 16 June 1934. Shea and Erma had two children: Ronnie and Elaine.\n\nShea's children became Christians at an early age. Shea's daughter Elaine became a Christian at the age of 8 during a Billy Graham Crusade at the Cow Palace, San Francisco, California in 1958. In 1959 Ron responded to an invitation by Billy Graham during one of the Crusade meetings in Sydney, Australia and was counseled by Grady Wilson. Erma Shea died in September 1976, and memorial services were held at Western Springs, Illinois on 8 September 1976.\n\nOn 19 December 1985 Shea married Karlene Aceto (1942 -), a 1972 graduate of Montreat College, in Montreat, North Carolina. In a September 2007 interview Shea recalled how he met and married his second wife, Karlene:\n\nIt has been 20 years of bliss. I was a widower for 10 years in a suburb of Chicago and that's a long time. When we were over in Korea in 1984, Billy brought me into his room and said, 'I've been talking to Ruth, my wife, in Montreat this morning on the phone and we think that 10 years is enough,' and so he mentioned Karlene's name. Mr. Graham didn't do the service. We had the pastor of our church here and he put on his nice robe and we were married in Billy's home.\n\nShea, who became a naturalized American citizen in 1941, and his wife, Karlene, lived in Montreat, North Carolina, on the same road as Billy Graham's home.\n\nA centenarian, Shea died on April 16, 2013 at the age of 104 from complications following a stroke. He was buried on the grounds of the Billy Graham Library in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nA reed organ owned by Shea now belongs to Art Robinson.\n\nAs a result of the recommendation of American opera baritone John Charles Thomas (born 6 September 1891 – died 13 December 1960), Shea studied singing under Gino Monaco, Thomas's own vocal coach.\n\nWhile working for Mutual Life in New York City Shea appeared on an amateur hour program hosted by Fred Allen on NBC radio. Despite losing to a yodeler, Shea earned second place, and a spot singing popular music on Allen's program, probably a precursor to Allen's \"Town Hall Tonight.\" Although Shea \"impressed the critics and scores of fans\", he still didn't feel he had discovered a direction for his life.\n\nIn 1933 a network radio director heard Shea sing and arranged an audition to sing popular secular songs for \"Your Hit Parade\", a national program with the Lyn Murray Singers broadcast on the NBC network. Shea passed the audition and was offered a job, but reluctantly turned the position down because he didn't feel right about performing secular music.\n\nShea sang regularly on radio station WHN, and on Erling C. Olsen's \"Meditations in the Psalms\" broadcast on radio station WMCA, as well as doing 30-minute programs from 7-7:30 am on WKBO in Jersey City, New Jersey. Shea also appeared on WKBO's \"the Old Fashioned Gospel Hour.\"\n\nShea sang on the \"Young Person's Church of the Air\" radio program, which had been started by Percy Crawford (1902–60) in Philadelphia in 1931 on Radio station WIP.\n\nShea began his recording career at the U.S. branch of Decca Records after being signed by A & R representative Jack Kapp, who told Shea: \"If you do better than the singer we have in mind, we will give you a contract. If not, you'll have to take the records on yourself. Shea recorded \"Jesus Whispers Peace,\" \"Lead Me Gently Home, Father,\" \"I'd Rather Have Jesus,\" and \"God Understands,\" accompanied by Ruth Crawford (wife of Percy Crawford) on the organ. About 7,000 copies were sold, and they are prized by music lovers today, the majority being Protestant Christians like Shea. \n\nIn 1939 Shea auditioned unsuccessfully for a spot on a CBS radio program that originated in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nWMBI (1939–1944)\nSoon after Dr. Will Houghton, president of the Moody Bible Institute (MBI) offered Shea a staff position with \"duties that included emceeing, interviewing, news-casting, continuity writing, programming, administration, auditioning, and singing\" on radio station WMBI, \"the powerhouse of evangelical radio\", the first non-commercial Christian radio station in America, which was owned and operated by the Moody Bible Institute originally on its campus in Chicago. Initially Shea sang on Houghton's \"Let's Go Back to the Bible,\" from 1939. Later he was also involved in \"Miracles and Melodies,\" which started on 67 radio stations across the USA in 1940, and was broadcast on 187 different stations in 45 US states, Canada, Latin America and China; and in \"Hymns From the Chapel\" each morning at 8:15.\n\n\"Songs in the Night\" (1944–1952)\nOn 2 January 1944 Shea began his ministry as a featured soloist on Billy Graham's \"Songs in the Night\" weekly radio program, which was broadcast live on Sunday evenings for 45 minutes from 10.15pm from the basement of the Village (Baptist) Church at 4475 Wolf Road, Western Springs, Illinois, pastored by Graham, and transmitted on radio station WCFL originating from Chicago, Illinois. The popularity of Shea helped make the previously financially struggling program self-sustaining within weeks. The Drummonds indicate that Shea \"skyrocketed the broadcast into a great success,\" so that soon \"Songs in the Night\" was broadcast twice on Sundays.\n\nAfter eight years Shea turned over his duties on this program to Glenn Jorian so that he could devote his energies full-time to the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA) .\n\n\"Club Time\" (1944–1952)\nIn June 1944 Shea resigned from WMBI to sing gospel on a 15-minute weekday radio program, \"Club Time,\" the second oldest hymn program on commercial radio. \"Club Time,\" initially broadcast on Radio station WCFL, was sponsored by Herbert J. Taylor (18 April 1893 – 1 May 1978), a Christian businessman who headed Club Aluminum of Chicago. According to Cusic:\nShea's job was to host the program and sing several songs, including the favorite hymn of various famous people. It was on \"Club Time\" that Beverly Shea became George Beverly Shea at the insistence of the advertising agency; it seems they felt most listeners were confused by a man named \"Beverly.\" \n\"Club Time\" was broadcast nationally from September 1945 for the next seven years over the ABC Radio and Armed Forces Networks and many independent stations. This show brought Shea national recognition, and by 1951 Shea was the most prominent male soloist in gospel music.\n\nSingspiration (1947)\nBy the summer of 1947 Shea was signed to the Singspiration Sacred Recordings label, which had been founded by Dr. Alfred B. Smith (8 November 1916 – 9 August 2001) in 1941, where he sang on a number of 78 rpm albums, including \"Bass Baritone\" (Singspiration \"Treasure Chest Series\" LP S-100) and \"Lead Me Gently Home, Father\" (Singspiration LP 156).\n\nSummer of 1942\nIn the summer of 1942 Shea took a leave of absence from WMBI to join Word Of Life (WOL) evangelist Jack Wyrtzen for evangelistic crusades in the New York area. He spent this summer traveling throughout New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut, singing at youth rallies while also singing on WHN on Sunday mornings.\n\nYouth for Christ (1942)\nWhen Shea returned to Chicago in September 1942, he talked with Torrey Johnson about conducting youth meetings in that area and soon \"Chicagoland Youth For Christ\" was held in Orchestra Hall on Michigan Avenue, Chicago, with Shea singing and Billy Graham speaking. From this initial concert, Johnson founded Youth for Christ (YFC). Shea sang in YFC rallies across the U.S. and Canada.\n\nAccording to Don Cusic, \"Shea and Billy Graham are the prime examples of an evangelical Christianity with mainstream appeal after World War II. Previously the evangelicals and fundamentalists were on the fringes of American religion; Shea and Graham put it in the mainstream.\" According to David Poling, \"central to Billy's successful ministry are the years of loyal service of people like George Beverly Shea, the first staff member to be hired by Graham back in the Chicago radio days.\" Shea has been involved as a soloist with Billy Graham and his ministry since 1947.\n\nShea first met Billy Graham in 1940 while Graham was pastor of the Village Church in Western Springs, Illinois. In a September 2007 interview Shea recalled how he first met Billy Graham:\n\nOne morning, there was a rap on my office door. I looked out and there was a tall young man with blond hair and we shook hands. He was 21 and I was 31. It was Billy Graham and he had traveled in from Wheaton College on a train just to say 'hello.' He said he listened to my morning hymn show called 'Hymns From The Chapel.' That's how we first got acquainted. I came into this work with Mr. Graham in 1947 after we had exchanged letters and talked on the phone. He said he wanted me to be his gospel singer. I thanked him but told him the only gospel singers I've ever heard about would sing a verse or two and stop and talk a while. 'Would I have to do that?' I asked him. He chuckled and said, 'I hope not.' With that, I said, 'Well, I'd like to come with you.' That was in November of 1947 and I've been with him ever since.\n\nIn 1948 Shea, along with Graham, Barrows and Grady Wilson, formulated a set of ethical guidelines, later designated The Modesto Manifesto, that became the cornerstone of the BGEA. Shea, along with Graham, Barrows, Grady Wilson and George Wilson, is one of the five directors of the BGEA.\n\nShea sang at the unofficial launching of Graham's crusades in the old Armory in Charlotte, North Carolina, in November 1947. His first song was \"I Will Sing the Wondrous Story.\" In the early days of his association with Graham, Shea earned a wage for each meeting.\n\nSince the beginning of Graham's crusade ministry Shea and Cliff Barrows have been the nucleus of the crusade musical team. Barrows is choir director, platform emcee and radio-television program director. They were joined in 1950 by pianist Tedd Smith, and through the years organists Don Hustad and John Innes have provided additional accompaniment.\n\nAs the musical mainstay in Graham's crusades, Shea is often called \"America's beloved Gospel singer.\" In each crusade Shea \"brings a quiet solo immediately preceding ... Graham's message. His solo serves as a transition from the song service into the message.\" Collins indicates: \"Shea's solos set the tone for the preacher's messages. With his full, rich baritone Shea not only charmed audiences, he also touched them with the message of each song he chose.\" Graham said that Shea always prepared his crowds by singing before the message, and he felt the song was more powerful than the sermon. According to Billy Graham in a 2002 interview in \"The Ottawa Citizen,\" \n\nI've been listening to Bev Shea sing for more than 50 years, and I would still rather hear him sing than anyone else I know.\n\nShea himself indicated the importance of his solo: \"Billy looks forward to the solo before the message as a time for people to quiet down and for him to gather strength.\"\n\nShea also made a valuable contribution to the increased effectiveness of Graham's crusades. According to R. Alan Streett:\n\nFor a number of years the entire congregation sang the invitational hymn, until Bev Shea suggested that the choir alone handle the assignment. Shea remembered how he, as an eighteen-year-old lad, was convicted by the Spirit as a choir sang \"Just As I Am.\" He felt the effects of a soft choir number could be used by God to touch people's hearts.\n\nOne day Shea suggested to Graham:\n\nHave you ever thought of saying, \"As the choir sings, you come\"? With just the choir singing there might be more contemplation upon the Holy Spirit's call. Soon after that, for the first time in his growing ministry, he began to say at the close of every service, \"As the choir sings, you come!\"\n\nThe \"Hour of Decision\" radio program was produced in the recording studio of Arthur \"Guitar Boogie\" Smith in Charlotte, North Carolina. On 5 December 1950 the \"Hour of Decision\" radio broadcasts began in Atlanta, Georgia on 150 radio stations. By its fifth week \"Hour of Decision\" had the largest audience of any religious radio program in history. By 1952 Shea sang regularly on this program.\n\nBecause of Shea's weekly singing on the \"Hour of Decision\" radio broadcast since 1950 and his numerous personal appearances, his voice is recognized now in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, South America, and throughout North America.\n\nShea has recorded approximately 500 vocal solos on more than seventy albums (including nine compact discs) of religious music on both the RCA Victor and Word Records labels. Shea has recorded songs with orchestral accompaniment, as arranged and conducted by musical directors, such as Hugo Winterhalter, Ralph Carmichael, Bill Walker, Nathan Scott, Norman Leyden, Jimmy Owens, Kurt Kaiser, Danny Davis, Charles Grean, and Radio City Music Hall organist, Ray Bohr. His albums have been produced by RCA Victor's Steve Sholes, Brad McCuen, Darol Rice, Cliff Barrows, Don Hustad, Bill Fasig, and John Innes.\n\nIn 1951, Shea was signed to RCA Victor Records by Sam Wallace and Elmer Eades, after being \"discovered\" by Paul Barkmeyer. His first album for RCA Victor, released on 10-inch and 12-inch long-playing records and on 45 RPM records, was entitled \"Inspirational Songs,\" produced by Stephen H. Sholes (12 February 1911 – 22 April 1968) and backed by Hugo Winterhalter and his Orchestra. During Shea's first four years with RCA Victor, his records did not recover the cost of recording and pressing, but by the end of the 1950s, he enjoyed major success. After a 24-year association with the label, he left it in favor of Word Records in 1975.\n\nShea is best known for his rendition of \"How Great Thou Art,\" the English translation by Rev. Stuart K. Hine of the Swedish song \"O Store Gud,\" written in 1886 by Rev. Carl Boberg (1859–1940). Arguably Shea's most popular hymn is \"The Wonder of It All,\" the title of which was also used by the University of North Carolina Center for Public Television for their 1998 production of his life story.\n\nIn 1932 Shea composed the tune to \"I'd Rather Have Jesus,\" the words of which were written by Rhea F. Miller (1894–1966), the wife of Dr. Howard Miller, later a general superintendent of the Church of the Nazarene. When RCA Victor signed Shea to a recording contract, \"the song that the company chose to initially spotlight their new singer was \"I'd Rather Have Jesus.\" \nShea also wrote both the lyrics and music for \"The Wonder of It All,\" which was copyrighted originally by Chancel Music in 1956.\n\nShea authored a number of books including an autobiography, \"Then Sings My Soul\" (1968); \"Songs That Lift the Heart\" (1972); \"How Sweet the Sound\" (2004); and \" Stories Behind 50 Southern Gospel Favorites, Vol. 2\" (2005).\n\n\n\nDuring his career, Shea was nominated for ten Grammy Awards, winning on March 15, 1966, the 1965 Best Gospel or Other Religious Recording (Musical) for his album \"Southland Favorites\" (RCA LSP-3440) recorded with the Anita Kerr Quartet.\n\nIn 1978, he was inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame by the Gospel Music Association and for his lifelong contribution to gospel music. On 18 February 1982 Shea was awarded the Gold Angel Award for Country Music award by Religion in Media in Hollywood, California.\n\nThe Christian Holiness Association (now Christian Holiness Partnership) presented Shea its Christian Service Award in 1993. In 1996 the association of National Religious Broadcasters voted Shea into its \"Religious Broadcasting Hall of Fame.\"\n\nOn September 11, 1999, Shea received the Integrity Award from Marketplace Ministries in Dallas, Texas. Shea also received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Gospel Music Association Canada (GMA Canada) in 2004. He was presented the Edwin P. Hubble Medal of Initiative, the highest honor of the city of Marshfield, Missouri in 2007 by friend Reverend Nicholas W. Inman. Shea sang at the dedication of the Billy Graham Library the following day.\n\nOn February 12, 2011, Shea received the 2010 Lifetime Achievement Grammy Award alongside Julie Andrews, Roy Haynes, the Juilliard String Quartet, the Kingston Trio, Dolly Parton and the Ramones at a ceremony held at the Wilshire Ebell Theater in Los Angeles, California.\n\nIn 1956, Shea received an honorary doctorate, the Doctor of Fine Arts, from his \"alma mater\", Houghton College. In 1972, Shea received another honorary doctorate, the Doctor of Sacred Music (D Sacred MUS), from Trinity College (now Trinity International University) of Deerfield, Illinois.\n\nShea is the subject of an authorized biography, \"George Beverly Shea: Tell Me the Story\" by Paul Davis, published on April 15, 2009.\n\nShea and \"How Great Thou Art\" are mentioned in Patricia Cornwell's 1998 best-selling novel \"Hornet's Nest.\" There is an allusion to Shea in Brad Whittington's coming of age novel \"Living with Fred.\" Shea is mentioned in the Christian novel \"The Peacemakers,\" the final volume in Jack Cavanaugh's \"American Family Portrait\" series.\n\n\n\n"}

It was created on February 8, 1962 when Huvadhu Atoll was divided into two districts. Gaafu Dhaalu corresponds to the Southwestern section of this large natural atoll, south of the line extending between the channels of Footukandu and Vaarulu Kandu. The capital of this region was Vaadhoo but it has been changed to Thinadhoo (formerly known as Thenadhoo). There are 153 islands in this district, 10 of which are inhabited. This district is located about 340 kilometres south of the capital Malé.\nNOTE: \"Haa Alifu, Haa Dhaalu, Shaviyani, Noonu, Raa, Baa, Kaafu, etc. (including Gaafu Dhaalu) are code letters assigned to the present administrative divisions of the Maldives. They are not the proper names of the natural atolls that make up these divisions. Some atolls are divided into two administrative divisions while other divisions are made up of two or more natural atolls. The order followed by the code letters is from North to South, beginning with the first letters of the Thaana alphabet used in Dhivehi. These code letters are not accurate from the geographical and cultural point of view. However, they have become popular among tourists and foreigners in the Maldives who find them easier to pronounce than the true atoll names in Dhivehi, (save a few exceptions, like Ari Atoll).\"\n\nHistorically the Huvadu atoll chief had a great measure of self-government. He even had the privilege, not granted to any other atoll chief of the Maldives, to fly his own flag in his vessels and at his residence.\n\nIn January 1959, the three southern atolls: Huvadhu, Fuvahmulah and Addu, were involved in setting up the breakaway United Suvadive Republic which survived until September 1963. The name of the secessionist state was taken from the ancient name of this atoll.\nIn some islands, like Gaddhū, there was opposition to the secession, and by means of threats and arson, the groups of people opposing the Suvadive state were forced to agree.\nHavaru Thinadhoo was burnt down by soldiers sent by then Prime Minister Ibrahim Nasir from Malé during the secession in 1962, after which it was left uninhabited for four whole years.\n\nThe Kaadedhdhoo Domestic Airport, located on the formerly uninhabited island of Kaadedhdhoo was opened in 1993.\n\nIn 2006 the Tourism Ministry of Maldives released the island of Vatavarrehaa for tourist resort development. A 150 bed resort is planned, this is the first resort to be built in Gaafu Dhaalu Atoll.\n\nThere are important Buddhist Archaeological remains in the Islands of Fiyoaree, Gan, Vādū and others. These ruins consist mainly of large ruined stupas. The stupa in Gan was partially explored by Thor Heyerdahl's archaeologists in recent test-excavations. However, all other ruins have not been well researched yet.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2281959", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2281959", "title": "Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill", "text": "Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill\n\nTennessee Valley Authority v. Hiram Hill et al., or TVA v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153 (1978), was a United States Supreme Court case and the Court's first interpretation of the Endangered Species Act of 1973. After the discovery of the snail darter fish in the Little Tennessee River in August 1973, a lawsuit was filed alleging that the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)'s Tellico Dam construction was in violation of the Endangered Species Act. Plaintiffs argued dam construction would destroy critical habitat and endanger the population of snail darters. It was decided by a 6-3 vote, in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of Hill, et al. and granted an injunction stating that there would be conflict between Tellico Dam operation and the explicit provisions of Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act.\n\nThe majority opinion, delivered by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, affirmed the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals decision in granting an injunction. This decision by the Supreme Court to not allow exemptions confirmed that Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act was a strong substantive provision and helped shape federal environmental law. The case is commonly cited as an example of the strict construction-plain meaning canon of construction, and the equitable principle that courts cannot balance equities to override statutory mandates unless on constitutional grounds.\n\nPassed by Congress a large majority in 531-4 vote and signed by Present Richard Nixon on December 28, 1973 with the purpose of protecting and recovering \"imperiled species and the ecosystems upon which they depend,\" the Endangered Species Act provides the strongest federal protection against species loss. The Endangered Species Act requires federal agencies to evaluate if actions taken or permitted by the federal government may harm listed species or the continued existence of listed species or their critical habitat. Once a species is listed as \"endangered\" or \"threatened,\" the ESA prohibits the \"taking\" of listed animals and plants which makes it unlawful \"to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect or attempt to engage in any such conduct.\" Unknowingly at the time, Congress had passed a controversial statute that created a forum which brought into question the merits of government projects and presented a political question of balancing the benefits of species preservation and the economic cost of preservation.\n\nThe Tennessee Valley Authority is a federally owned utility corporation created in 1933 during the Great Depression. At the time of its creation, its mission was to help strengthen economic development of the Tennessee River basin, a region hit with high unemployment where the per capita income was less than half the national average. The publicly owned corporation provides flood control, navigation and land management for the Tennessee River system and assists utilities and state and local governments with economic development. The Tellico Dam project would be the last of 68 dams constructed in the Tennessee River Valley. TVA argued that the project would provide recreational benefits and allow for real estate development along the reservoir.\n\nHiram (Hank) Hill was a second year law student at the University of Tennessee. Hiram Hill was spending time with Dr. David Etnier, a biologist and professor, who had discovered the snail darter while scuba diving in the Little Tennessee River. Hill brought the snail darter to the attention of Zygmunt J.B. Plater, a law professor, and asked if the completion of the Tellico Dam and the potential effect on the fish under the Endangered Species Act would be a suitable topic for an environmental law paper. The plaintiffs in the case were Hill, Plater, and Donald Cohen.\n\nIn previous suits filed by Environmental Defense Fund under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), TVA had been ordered by Judge Robert L. Taylor of the Eastern District of Tennessee to cease dam construction for 16 months until an environmental impact statement had been written. Congress continued to fund the project under the annual Public Works Appropriations Act and Judge Taylor dissolved the injunction after a year and dismissed the NEPA suit.\n\nAfter the discovery of the snail darter, Hiram Hill, Zygmunt Plater, and local attorney Joseph Congleton submitted a petition to the Fish and Wildlife Service to list the snail darter as endangered. In the Federal Register, the FWS ruled that the species was indeed endangered and designated mile 0.5 to 17 of the Little Tennessee River as critical habitat for snail darters. TVA rejected the Fish and Wildlife Service's interpretation of ESA and continued to receive funding for the Tellico Dam.\n\nOn February 28, 1976 Hill et al., filed a citizen's suit seeking an injunction and claimed that TVA was in violation of the Endangered Species Act. Judge Taylor presided over the case and on May 25, 1976 he found that the dam would eliminate the fish and its habitat, but he refused to consider balancing the alternate development of the river, and refused to enjoin completion of the Tellico Dam.\n\nOn January 31, 1977 the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Judge Taylor's decision and issued an injunction forbidding the completion of the dam. During this time TVA petitioned the FWS to remove the snail darter from the endangered species list and also petitioned for a writ of certiorari from the United States Supreme Court.\n\nIt was not disputed by either party that the completion of the dam would eradicate the known population of snail darters. The two issues of the case were as follows:\n\nOn April 18, 1978 TVA argued that an exception to the Endangered Species Act should be granted for balancing of equities. They argued that Congress had already spent $100 million on the project, and that it would not make economic sense to stop the project. TVA argued for an exception to be made in this case since the dam was started prior to the Endangered Species Act being passed and claimed it should be grandfathered in. Another argument made was that since the appropriations committees continued to appropriate funding for the project after knowing it would be detrimental to the snail darter's critical habitat, Congress had implicitly repealed the Endangered Species Act.\n\nSection 7 of the Endangered Species Act offers no exceptions to the jeopardizing of the continued existence of listed endangered species or their habitat. Endangered species should be afforded the highest of priorities no matter the economic costs.\n\nThe majority opinion was made by Chief Justice Burger, joined by justices William J. Brennan, Jr., Potter Stewart, Byron White, Thurgood Marshall, and John Paul Stevens was delivered on June 15, 1978. Burger affirmed that the Endangered Species Act is very clear in its wording:\n\nOne would be hard pressed to find a statutory provision whose terms were any plainer than those in 7 of the Endangered Species Act. Its very words affirmatively command all federal agencies 'to insure that actions authorized, funded, or carried out by them do not jeopardize the continued existence' of an endangered species or 'result in the destruction or modification of habitat of such species . . . .' 16 U.S.C. 1536 (1976 ed.). (Emphasis added.) This language admits of no exception.\n\nBased on the wording of the Act, Congress viewed the value of an endangered species as incalculable. Until Congress decided otherwise, the courts should enforce the law, not allowing violations to continue.\n\nTo TVA's claim that Congress had implied repeal of the Endangered Species Act Burger wrote: \"When voting on appropriations measures, legislators are entitled to operate under the assumption that the funds will be devoted to purposes which are lawful and not for any purpose forbidden.\"\n\nJustices Lewis F. Powell, Jr. and Harry Blackmun agreed with the majority opinion with the wording of the Endangered Species Act, but disagreed that there could not be exception.\n\n...I view it as the duty of this Court to adopt a permissible construction that accords with some modicum of common sense and the public weal.\n\nPowell thought it rationally followed that since the dam construction began before the ESA was passed, the statute did not apply to projects already underway.\n\nJustice William Rehnquist agreed with the District Court in their refusal to issue an injunction.\nHere the District Court recognized that Congress, when it enacted the Endangered Species Act, made the preservation of the habitat of the snail darter an important public concern. But it concluded that this interest on one side of the balance was more than outweighed by other equally significant factors. These factors, further elaborated in the dissent of my brother Powell, satisfy me that the District Court's refusal to issue an injunction was not an abuse of its discretion.

Just because they could issue an injunction, does not mean they had an absolute duty to do so.\n\nEndangered Species Act Amendments of 1978 were introduced by Senators Howard Baker and John C. Culver. The subsequent amendments brought \"some flexibility into the Endangered Species Act\". As part of the amendment Congress created the Endangered Species Committee composed of seven senior officials:\n\nThe committee has the authority to exempt federal agencies from provisions in Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act. An exemption could be granted if a majority of the committee members found:\n\nIf approved, the extinction of a species would be allowed and the agency would be required to implement a mitigation plan.\n\nThe Tellico Dam project was reviewed by the so-called \"God Committee\" on January 23, 1979 and was unanimously denied an exemption based on economic factors. Chairman Andrus stated, \"I hate to see the snail darter get the credit for stopping a project that was ill-conceived and uneconomic in the first place.\" The annual cost of the dam, $7.25 million, exceeded estimated benefits, $6.25 million, in addition to the cost of completing dam construction and also would tie up approximately $40 million in private (agricultural) land values.\n\nDetermined to have the Tellico Dam completed, Senator Baker and Representative John Duncan, Sr. rejected the economic analysis and attached a rider into the Energy and Water Development Appropriation Act in July 1979 directing TVA to complete the construction of the Tellico Dam. The appropriations bill was signed by President Jimmy Carter allowing the project to be completed and a reservoir began to form later in the year. Although that population of the snail darter did not survive, several small populations were later found upstream in the Tennessee River and its tributaries. The snail darter is still on the Endangered Species List, though it was down-graded to \"threatened\" after being successfully transplanted into other river systems.\n\n\n"}

He worked as a model at the Bookings and Ford agencies before beginning his production career. Before that, he had worked in the music industry, first as kid working part-time in record shops, then holding a sales and promotion job at King Records (from 1959 to 1961), and similar positions at RCA and United Artists. He eventually left due to his disgust at the industry's dishonesty. His music career restarted in the late 1960s, with a self-made tape of overlapping songs created for the Fire Island bar and restaurant The Sandpiper.\n\nHe was responsible for the first continuous-mix album side, on Gloria Gaynor's disco album \"Never Can Say Goodbye\", earning him the title of \"father of the disco mix.\" Among some of his other successes in mixing songs are The Three Degrees' \"Dirty Ol' Man,\" MFSB featuring The Three Degrees' \"Love Is The Message,\" B.T.

It was the opening track on both the album and the film \"Purple Rain\". \"Let's Go Crazy\" was one of Prince's most popular songs, and was a staple for concert performances, often segueing into other hits. When released as a single, the song became Prince's second number-one hit on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, and also topped the two component charts, the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Dance Club Play charts, as well as becoming a UK Top 10 hit. The B-side was the lyrically controversial \"Erotic City\". In the UK, the song was released as a double A-side with \"Take Me with U\".\n\nCommon to much of Prince's writing, the song is thought to be exhortation to follow Christian ethics, with the \"De-elevator\" of the lyrics being a metaphor for the Devil. The extended \"Special Dance Mix\" of the song was performed in a slightly edited version in the film \"Purple Rain\". It contains a longer instrumental section in the middle that includes a chugging guitar riff, an atonal piano solo and some muddled samples of the spoken word intro.\n\nFollowing Prince's death, the song re-charted on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 singles chart at number 39 and rose to number 25 by the week of May 14, 2016. As of April 30, 2016, it has sold 964,403 copies in the United States.\n\nThe song was also notable for opening with a funeral-like organ solo with Prince giving the \"eulogy\" for \"this thing called life.\" The introduction's words are overlapped with each other on the single version. The song climaxes with a distinctive drum machine pattern and then features a heavy guitar outro leads, electronic drums, bass and whirring synthesizers and a climatic drum outro. The song's percussion was programmed with a Linn LM-1 drum machine, an instrument frequently used in many of Prince's songs.

Four months after the video was originally uploaded, Universal Music Group, which owned the copyrights to the song, ordered YouTube to remove the video enforcing the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Lenz notified YouTube immediately that her video was within the scope of fair use, and demanded that it be restored. YouTube complied after six weeks—not two weeks, as required by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act—to see whether Universal planned to sue Lenz for infringement. Lenz then sued Universal Music in California for her legal costs, claiming the music company had acted in bad faith by ordering removal of a video that represented fair use of the song.\n\nLater in August 2008, U.S. District Judge Jeremy Fogel, of San Jose, California, ruled that copyright holders cannot order a deletion of an online file without determining whether that posting reflected \"fair use\" of the copyrighted material. In 2015 the court affirmed the holding that Universal was required to consider fair use before sending its initial takedown request.\n\n\n"}

It was released in early 1976, following a four-year hiatus from the music industry during which time she both married and divorced, and lived away from the spotlight. She dedicated the album to her mother.\n\nThe music of \"Smile\" is smooth jazz-pop, and Nyro was reunited with producer and arranger Charlie Calello, who had worked with Nyro on her 1968 opus \"Eli and the Thirteenth Confession\".\n\nMusically, \"Smile\" finds Nyro exploring Chinese culture with traditional Asian instrumentation and lyric allusions, particularly on the mildly controversial \"Children of the Junks\". Elsewhere, she rails against the music industry (\"Money\") and sings of her new laidback lifestyle away from the glare of the media.\n\nDespite her long absence, Columbia Records had re-signed Nyro and the album became a small chart success during 1976, peaking at #60 on the \"Billboard\" 200, then known as the Pop Albums chart. It produced her first full-band tour in 1976, which was documented the following year on the live album \"Season of Lights\".\n\nAfter Nyro's huge burst of creativity between 1966 and 1971, when she recorded five well-received albums and well over 40 original songs, she retreated from the limelight, partly stung by her lack of major commercial success in her own right but also because of the lure of love.\n\nNyro married Vietnam War veteran David Bianchini in 1972 after a whirlwind romance and spent the next three years living with him in a small town in Massachusetts. The marriage ended after three years, during which time she grew accustomed to the country life as opposed to the city life where she had recorded her first five records.\n\nIn 1975, Nyro split from Bianchini and also suffered the trauma of the death of her mother Gilda to ovarian cancer at the age of 49; Laura herself died from the same disease at the same age two decades later. She consoled herself largely by recording a new album, enlisting Charlie Calello, with whom she had collaborated on \"Eli and the Thirteenth Confession\".\n\nMusically, \"Smile\" begins the \"mellow period\" that Nyro stayed with on her studio albums for the rest of her career, although it continues her fascination with mysticism with various exotic instruments and arrangements. The title track, particularly, explores a deep flirtation with Chinese music. Several of the tracks, including \"Children of the Junks\" and \"I Am The Blues\" had been written and sung by Nyro in concert as early as 1971 and 1972 (as evidenced by bootleg recordings) and were later recorded for this album.\n\nAll tracks composed by Laura Nyro, except where indicated.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1999, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Harwich Mariners of the Cape Cod Baseball League.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Devil Rays selected him with the third overall draft pick in the first round of the 2001 MLB amateur draft, and Brazelton made his MLB debut September 13, 2002. In 2004, Brazelton, after being called the second coming of Roger Clemens by Peter Gammons, received the Tony Conigliaro Award.\n\nAfter Stuart Sternberg took over as principal owner of the Devil Rays, Brazelton was traded during the 2005 annual baseball winter meetings to the Padres for third baseman Sean Burroughs.\n\nIn spring training of 2006, Brazelton appeared impressive, going 1–0 with a 1.77 ERA in 5 starts and earned the position of fourth starter in the Padres's four-man rotation, behind Jake Peavy, Chris Young, and Shawn Estes. However, Brazelton's first two starts were disastrous, taking the loss for both while pitching a combined 6 innings and giving up 17 hits and 17 earned runs. Brazelton was then moved to the bullpen and used as a spot reliever where between March 8 and April 19, he pitched 11.1 innings with a 2.31 ERA.

He helped pioneer the remix and 12\" single in America, and was among the most influential New York DJs of the 1970s.\n\nGibbons began DJing in New York in the early 1970s, and was among the first Americans to incorporate techniques from dub reggae production into dance music. In 1975 he began DJing at the Manhattan club Galaxy 21 in 1975; he would become a regular at the club. He left Galaxy 21 in late 1976 after he discovered his sets were being secretly recorded and sold on the black market. Unable to find a new regular club that would accept his sound, he briefly moved to Seattle before returning to New York and DJing haphazardly.\nHe also enjoyed a long association with Salsoul Records at the end of the 1970s. His DJ skills, punctuality and seriousness convinced Salsoul to assign him the remix of \"Ten Percent\", by Double Exposure, even though he had never produced. It became the first commercially available 12-inch single in the world, and his best-known remix. His remix of \"Hit and Run\" by Loleatta Holloway was a surprise hit. He released Salsoul mixes such as \"Disco Boogie: Super Hits for Non-Stop Dancing\" (1976) and \"Disco Madness\" (1979), the latter being the first full-length release by a solo remixer. He also worked on labels such as West End and Gold Mind.\n\nGibbons was largely inactive in the early 1980s, but returned in 1984 with his biggest hit, a mix of Strafe's \"Set It Off\", which became an anthem of the early New York garage scene. In 1986 he released a remix of Arthur Russell's \"Schoolbell/Tree House\" for Sleeping Bag Records. Gibbons became a reborn Christian in the 1980s, but still managed to turn out cutting edge mixes during this period (he simply focused on songs and lyrics that did not offend his beliefs). Despite becoming isolated from the New York dance scene and some of his friends, he was warmly received after he embarked on a small tour of Japan in 1993. He spent his final weeks living alone in a YMCA, and died of AIDS-related symptoms in 1994.\n\nHis remixes were posthumously compiled on the triple-CD compilation \"Mixed with Love\" (2004) and the 2-CD \"Jungle Music\" (2010). The first feature Gibbons' Salsoul mixes of tracks by the likes of Loleatta Holloway, The Salsoul Orchestra, Double Exposure, First Choice, Love Committee and Anthony White among others. \"Jungle Music\" compiles a wider scope of his work.\n\nGibbons, along with hip hop pioneer Kool DJ Herc, was among the first American musicians to apply elements of Jamaican dub production to disco and dance music. Like Arthur Russell, who recorded with him, Gibbons \"used dub as a dislocating device, preventing disco's simple groove from developing under the dancers' feet.\" His mixes focused more on percussion than melody, and \"stretched out the grooves so much that they teetered on the edge of motionlessness.\" He was also among the first to beat-juggle between two copies of the same record. According to AllMusic, \"utterly transformed with the addition of echo/reverb effects borrowed from dub and drum breaks, [his] singles influenced dozens of producers (and DJs).\" Gibbons was known as \"the DJ's DJ\" because his peers would go out of their way to hear him play.\n\nGibbons was an important part of the early 1970s New York City disco underground scene, influencing garage and house music DJs like Frankie Knuckles and Larry Levan. He also laid the foundations for early 1980s experimental Chicago house music. One of the early pioneers of beat-mixing, and known for considerably more skillful mixing than many better-known DJs at the time, he is cited by many early pioneers of the house-music scene as an influence. His \"Disco Blend\" remix of Double Exposure's \"Ten Percent\" was once described by UK DJ Ashley Beedle as providing a \"blueprint for house music\".\n\nThe 1996 album \"Walter's Room\" was Black Science Orchestra's homage to Gibbons, released in London on Junior Boy's Own Records.\n\n\n"}

He was awarded the OBE for services to the Scottish grocery industry in 2005.\n\nA long-time supporter of Dundee United F.C., Thompson bought the club in 2002 and remained chairman until his death in 2008. \n\nBorn in Glasgow, where he attended Hyndland Secondary School, Thompson qualified as an accountant prior to working in managerial positions for Dundee-based Watson & Philip, owners of the VG chain of convenience stores. In 1991, he left them to become founder and chief executive of a similar chain called Morning, Noon & Night. He continued to run the company until selling it to Scotmid in 2004 for £30m.\n\nHe was awarded the OBE in June 2005, in recognition of his services to the Scottish grocery industry and his work as chairman of the Scottish Retail Consortium. As well as the SRC, he has also served on the board of the CBI Council for Scotland, the British Retail Consortium and the Scottish Grocers' Federation. He has also been a recipient of the Scottish Grocery Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nThompson was initially a Motherwell fan, but changed his allegiances and became a supporter of Dundee United when he moved to the Dundee area. He had a lengthy association with the club, and instigated their first ever shirt sponsorship deal, with VG, in the 1980s. He was appointed the club's honorary business consultant but subsequently became estranged from the club's management after falling out with manager and chairman Jim McLean. Thompson spent many years trying to invest in the club, being constantly rebuffed until finally assuming control of Dundee United in September 2002 when he bought McLean's shareholding.\n\nAfter gaining control he invested large sums of money in the team, but initially with limited success. Thompson gained a reputation as a ruthless chairman, sacking five managers in little more than his first four years in charge. He continued to take charge of club affairs personally, despite having been diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2003. Thompson also served as a member of the Scottish Premier League management board. \n\nThe club's fortunes began to improve following the appointment of Craig Levein, who would become a personal friend of Thompson, as manager in October 2006. During the 2007–08 season, Dundee United reached the Scottish League Cup Final, by which time it had become public knowledge that the chairman was terminally ill. Many supporters wore T-shirts bearing a \"One Eddie Thompson\" slogan during the final against Rangers to pay tribute to his efforts on behalf of the club. Also during March 2008, it was announced that the East Stand at United's Tannadice Park stadium was to be renamed after Thompson, following suggestions by supporters.\n\nDuring this period, Thompson reorganised the club to ensure continuity following his death. His son Stephen, already a director, was appointed as chief executive, taking over many of his father's duties. Craig Levein was also appointed to the board as director of football, in addition to his managerial role.\n\nThompson died of prostate cancer on 15 October 2008. His death was announced by Dundee United in a statement: \"It is with great sadness that Dundee United announce the death of chairman Eddie Thompson, who died today after a long illness borne with great fortitude, much bravery and a dogged determination to carry out his responsibilities at Tannadice for as long as possible.\"\n\nHe is survived by his widow, daughter, son, and four grandchildren. His son-in-law was killed in a road accident on 12 October 2008. His role as Chairman of Dundee United Football Club was taken over by his son Stephen.\n\n"}

This results in a natural harbor that is very calm and safe for sea vessels at all times and is not affected by seasonal changes. The four channels are arranged around the atoll as follows: the Kuda channel and the nearby Maa channel are on the north, the Gan channel is on the south, and the broad Villingili channel is on the southeast.\n\nThe islands are protected from the storms and high waves of the Indian Ocean by barrier reefs. Coconut palms, the national tree, are able to grow almost everywhere on the islands of Addu Atoll. There are small lakes, wetlands, and marshy taro fields that are unique to Addu Atoll.\n\nDuring the Second World War Addu atoll was the site of a secret Royal Navy base called HMS Haitan, to take advantage of the deep anchorage and sheltered natural harbour there. Oil tanks and storage facilities were built on Gan island, together with an airstrip and a flying boat base. The base remained unknown to the Axis throughout the early years of the war.\nIn 1957 the base was transferred to the Royal Air Force as RAF Gan, before being closed down in 1975. The island is now the site of Addu's international airport.\n\nThe cosmopolitan white tern (\"dhondheeni\") is found in the Maldives only on Addu Atoll and is seen as a symbol of the islands. Addu Atoll also possesses particularly rich whale and dolphin fauna. A great diversity of species has been found there. Addu Atoll is the only area in the Maldives that was not affected by the 1998 global coral bleaching. The south of the Maldives was spared from the \"too warm\" major ocean currents of (\"El Niño\"). The bright and healthy corals start at the top of \"giris\" and \"thilas\" (about 1 meter [3 ft] under the surface) and slope down with the reef to a depth of or more.\n\n\n\nThe dialect spoken is called \"Addu bas\", and though it has similarities to the \"Mulaku bas\" of Fuvahmulah, it is somewhat different from the official form of the Dhivehi language. Traditionally, Addu bas was widely spoken amongst the educated masses of three different atolls in the south, who adopted it as their lingua franca. It has also been credited with being the most famous and widespread single dialect in the Republic of Maldives. However, when Addu declared independence and recognized itself as the United Suvadive Republic, the Malé language rather than Addu bas was used in official correspondence. Nevertheless, despite the difference in dialects, the written version is common throughout the Maldives.\n\nLong ago Addu City was ruled by families appointed by the sultans in Malé, and may have had a matrilineal system of inheritance; it is very much a man's world today. There was a recent period in Addu history when the status quo changed for a while, when a more matriarchal society developed and women became the breadwinners.\n\nAddu Atoll has some of the earliest known settlements recorded in the country—specifically, on the island of Meedhoo in the far north of the atoll.\n\n"}
{"id": "2282039", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2282039", "title": "Whole life insurance", "text": "Whole life insurance\n\nWhole life insurance, or whole of life assurance (in the Commonwealth of Nations), sometimes called \"straight life\" or \"ordinary life,\" is a life insurance policy which is guaranteed to remain in force for the insured's entire lifetime, provided required premiums are paid, or to the maturity date. As a life insurance policy it represents a contract between the insured and insurer that as long as the contract terms are met, the insurer will pay the death benefit of the policy to the policy's beneficiaries when the insured dies. Because whole life policies are guaranteed to remain in force as long as the required premiums are paid, the premiums are typically much higher than those of term life insurance where the premium is fixed only for a limited term. Whole life premiums are fixed, based on the age of issue, and usually do not increase with age. The insured party normally pays premiums until death, except for limited pay policies which may be paid up in 10 years, 20 years, or at age 65. Whole life insurance belongs to the cash value category of life insurance, which also includes universal life, variable life, and endowment policies.\n\nThe death benefit of a whole life policy is normally the stated face amount. However, if the policy is \"participating\", the death benefit will be increased by any accumulated dividend values and/or decreased by any outstanding policy loans. (see example below) Certain riders, such as Accidental Death benefit may exist, which would potentially increase the benefit.\n\nIn contrast, universal life policies (a flexible premium whole life substitute) may be structured to pay cash values in addition to the face amount, but usually do not guarantee lifetime coverage in such cases.\n\nA whole life policy is said to \"mature\" at death or the maturity age of 100, whichever comes first. To be more exact the maturity date will be the \"policy anniversary nearest age 100\". The policy becomes a \"matured endowment\" when the insured person lives past the stated maturity age. In that event the policy owner receives the face amount in cash. With many modern whole life policies, issued since 2009, maturity ages have been increased to 120. Increased maturity ages have the advantage of preserving the tax-free nature of the death benefit. In contrast, a matured endowment may have substantial tax obligations.\n\nThe entire death benefit of a whole life policy is free of income tax, except in unusual cases. This includes any internal gains in cash values. The same is true of group life, term life, and accidental death policies.\n\nHowever, when a policy is cashed out before death, the treatment varies. With cash surrenders, any gain over total premiums paid will be taxable as ordinary income. The same is true in the case of a matured endowment. This is why most people choose to take cash values out as a \"loan\" against the death benefit rather than a \"surrender.\" Any money taken as a loan is free from income tax as long as the policy remains in force. For participating whole life policies, the interest charged by the insurance company for the loan is often less than the dividend each year, especially after 10–15 years, so the policy owner can pay off the loan using dividends. If the policy is surrendered or canceled before death, any loans received above the cumulative value of premiums paid will be subject to tax as growth on investment.\n\nAlthough life insurance benefits are generally free of income tax, the same is not true of estate tax. In the US, life insurance will be considered part of a person's taxable estate to the extent he possesses \"incidents of ownership.\" Estate planners often use special irrevocable trusts to shield life insurance from estate taxes.\n\nIndividuals may find whole life attractive because it offers coverage for an indeterminate length of time. It is the dominant choice for insuring so-called \"permanent\" insurance needs, including: \n\nIndividuals may find whole life less attractive, due to the relatively high premiums, for insuring:\n\nIn the second category, term life is generally considered more suitable and has played an increasingly larger role in recent years.\n\nBusinesses may also have legitimate and compelling needs, including funding of:\n\n\nWhile Term life may be suitable for Buy-Sell agreements and Key Person indemnification, cash value insurance is almost exclusively for Deferred Comp and S.E.R.P.'s.\n\nLevel premium whole life insurance (sometimes called ordinary whole life, though this term is also sometimes used more broadly) provides lifetime death benefit coverage for a level premium.\n\nWhole life premiums are much higher than term insurance premiums, but because term insurance premiums rise with increasing age of the insured, the cumulative value of all premiums paid under whole and term policies are roughly equal if the policy continues to average life expectancy. Part of the insurance contract stipulates that the policyholder is entitled to a cash value reserve that is part of the policy and guaranteed by the company. This cash value can be accessed at any time through policy loans that are received income tax-free and paid back according to mutually agreed-upon schedules. These policy loans are available until the insured's death. If any loans amounts are outstanding—i.e., not yet paid back—upon the insured's death, the insurer subtracts those amounts from the policy's face value/death benefit and pays the remainder to the policy's beneficiary.\n\nWhole life insurance may prove a better value than term for someone with an insurance need of greater than ten to fifteen years due to favorable tax treatment of interest credited to cash values. However, for those unable to afford the premium necessary to provide adequate whole life coverage for their current insurance needs, it would be imprudent to purchase less coverage than is adequate as whole life insurance rather than purchase an adequate level of term to cover their current need.\n\nWhile some life insurance companies market whole life as a \"death benefit with a savings account\", the distinction is artificial, according to life insurance actuaries Albert E. Easton and Timothy F. Harris. The net amount at risk is the amount the insurer must pay to the beneficiary should the insured die before the policy has accumulated premiums equal to the death benefit. It is the difference between the policy's current cash value (i.e., total paid in by owner plus that amount's interest earnings) and its face value/death benefit. Although the actual cash value may be different from the death benefit, in practice the policy is identified by its original face value/death benefit.\n\nThe advantages of whole life insurance are its guaranteed death benefits; guaranteed cash values; fixed, predictable premiums; and mortality and expense charges that do not reduce the policy's cash value. The disadvantages of whole life are the inflexibility of its premiums and the fact that the internal rate of return of the policy may not be competitive with other savings and investment alternatives.\n\nDeath benefit amounts of whole life policies can also be increased through accumulation and/or reinvestment of policy dividends, though these dividends are not guaranteed and may be higher or lower than earnings at existing interest rates over time. According to internal documents from some life insurance companies, the internal rate of return and dividend payment realized by the policyholder is often a function of when the policyholder buys the policy and how long that policy remains in force. Dividends paid on a whole life policy can be utilized in many ways.\n\nThe life insurance manual defines policy dividends as refunds of premium over-payments. They are therefore not exactly like corporate stock dividends, which are payouts of net income from total revenues.\n\nModified whole life insurance features smaller premiums for a specified period of time, followed by higher premiums for the remainder of the policy.\nSurvivorship life insurance is whole life insurance insuring two lives, with proceeds payable after the second (later) death. The level premium system results in overpaying for the risk of dying at younger ages, and underpaying in later years toward the end of life.\n\nThe over-payments inherent in the level premium system mean that a large portion of expensive old-age costs are prepaid during a person's younger years. U.S. Life insurance companies are required by state regulation to set up reserve funds to account for said over-payments, which represent promised future benefits, and are classified as Legal Reserve Life Insurance Companies. The Death Benefit promised by the contract is a fixed obligation calculated to be payable at the end of life expectancy, which may be 50 years or more in the future. (see non-forfeiture values)\n\nMost of the visible and apparent wealth of Life Insurance companies is due to the enormous assets (reserves) they hold to stand behind future liabilities. In fact, reserves are classified as a liability, since they represent obligations to policyholders. These reserves are primarily invested in bonds and other debt instruments, and are thus a major source of financing for government and private industry.\n\nCash values are an integral part of a whole life policy, and reflect the reserves necessary to assure payment of the guaranteed death benefit. Thus, \"cash surrender\" (and \"loan\") values arise from the policyholder's rights to quit the contract and reclaim a share of the reserve fund attributable to his policy. (see #Example of non-forfeiture values below)\n\nAlthough life insurance is often sold with a view toward the \"living benefits\" (accumulated cash and dividend values), this feature is a byproduct of the level premium nature of the contract. The original intent was not to \"sugar coat\" the product; rather it is a necessary part of the design. However, prospective purchasers are often more motivated by the thought of being able to \"count my money in the future.\" Policies purchased at younger ages will usually have guaranteed cash values greater than the sum of all premiums paid after a number of years. Sales tactics frequently appeal to this self-interest (sometimes called \"the greed motive\"). It is a reflection of human behavior that people are often more willing to talk about money for their own future than to discuss provisions for the family in case of premature death (the \"fear motive\"). On the other hand, many policies purchased due to selfish motives will become vital family resources later in a time of need.\n\nThe cash values in whole life policies grow at a guaranteed rate (usually 4%) plus an annual dividend. In certain states the cash value in the policies is 100% asset protected, meaning the cash value cannot be taken away in the event of a lawsuit or bankruptcy. Also if used and built correctly the cash value can be taken out of the policy on a tax-free basis. \n\nWhen discontinuing a policy, according to Standard Non-forfeiture Law, a policyholder is entitled to receive his share of the reserves, or cash values, in one of three ways (1) Cash, (2) Reduced Paid-up Insurance, or (3) Extended term insurance.\n\nAll values related to the policy (death benefits, cash surrender values, premiums) are usually determined at policy issue, for the life of the contract, and usually cannot be altered after issue. This means that the insurance company assumes all risk of future performance versus the actuaries' estimates. If future claims are underestimated, the insurance company makes up the difference. On the other hand, if the actuaries' estimates on future death claims are high, the insurance company will retain the difference.\n\nNon-participating policies are typically issued by Stock companies, with stockholder capital bearing the risk. Since whole life policies frequently cover a time span in excess of 50 years, it can be seen that accurate pricing is a formidable challenge! Actuaries must set a rate which will be sufficient to keep the company solvent through prosperity or depression, while remaining competitive in the marketplace. The company will be faced with future changes in Life expectancy, unforeseen economic conditions, and changes in the political and regulatory landscape. All they have to guide them is past experience.\n\nIn a participating policy (also \"par\" in the United States, and known as a \"with-profits policy\" in the Commonwealth), the insurance company shares the excess profits (divisible surplus) with the policyholder in the form of annual dividends. Typically these \"refunds\" are not taxable because they are considered an overcharge of premium (or \"reduction of basis\"). In general, the greater the overcharge by the company, the greater the refund/dividend ratio; however, other factors will also have a bearing on the size of the dividend. For a mutual life insurance company, participation also implies a degree of ownership of the mutuality.\n\nParticipating policies are typically (although not exclusively) issued by Mutual life insurance companies. However, Stock companies sometimes issue participating policies. Premiums for a participating policy will be higher than for a comparable non-par policy, with the difference (or, \"overcharge\") being considered as \"paid-in surplus\" to provide a margin for error equivalent to stockholder capital. Illustrations of future dividends are never guaranteed.\n\nIn the case of mutual companies, unneeded surplus is distributed retrospectively to policyholders in the form of dividends. Sources of surplus include conservative pricing, mortality experience more favorable than anticipated, excess interest, and savings in expenses of operation.\n\nWith non-participating policies, unneeded surplus is distributed as dividends to stockholders.\n\nSimilar to non-participating, except that the premium may vary year to year. However, the premium will never exceed the maximum premium guaranteed in the policy. This allows companies to set competitive rates based on current economic conditions.\n\nA blending of participating and term life insurance, wherein a part of the dividends is used to purchase additional term insurance. This can generally yield a higher death benefit, at a cost to long term cash value. In some policy years the dividends may be below projections, causing the death benefit in those years to decrease.\n\nLimited pay policies may be either participating or non-par, but instead of paying annual premiums for life, they are only due for a certain number of years, such as 20. The policy may also be set up to be fully paid up at a certain age, such as 65 or 80. The policy itself continues for the life of the insured. These policies would typically cost more up front, since the insurance company needs to build up sufficient cash value within the policy during the payment years to fund the policy for the remainder of the insured's life. With Participating policies, dividends may be applied to shorten the premium paying period.\n\nA form of limited pay, where the pay period is a single large payment up front. These policies typically have fees during early policy years should the policyholder cash it in.\n\nThis type is fairly new, and is also known as either \"excess interest\" or \"current assumption\" whole life. The policies are a mixture of traditional whole life and universal life. Instead of using dividends to augment guaranteed cash value accumulation, the interest on the policy's cash value varies with current market conditions. Like whole life, death benefit remains constant for life. Like universal life, the premium payment might vary, but not above the maximum premium guaranteed within the policy.\n\nWhole life insurance typically requires that the owner pay premiums for the life of the policy. There are some arrangements that let the policy be \"paid up\", which means that no further payments are ever required, in as few as 5 years, or with even a single large premium. Typically if the payor doesn't make a large premium payment at the outset of the life insurance contract, then he is not allowed to begin making them later in the contract life. However, some whole life contracts offer a rider to the policy which allows for a one time, or occasional, large additional premium payment to be made as long as a minimal extra payment is made on a regular schedule. In contrast, universal life insurance generally allows more flexibility in premium payment.\n\nThe company generally will guarantee that the policy's cash values will increase every year regardless of the performance of the company or its experience with death claims (again compared to universal life insurance and variable universal life insurance which can increase the costs and decrease the cash values of the policy). The dividends can be taken in one of three ways. The policy owner can be given a cheque from the insurance company for the dividends, the dividends can be used to reduce the premium payment, or the dividends can be reinvested back into the policy to increase the death benefit and the cash value at a faster rate. When the dividends paid on a whole life policy are chosen by the policy owner to be reinvested back into the policy, the cash value can increase at a rather substantial rate depending on the performance of the company.\n\nThe cash value will grow tax-deferred with compounding interest. Even though the growth is considered \"tax-deferred,\" any loans taken from the policy will be tax-free as long as the policy remains in force. In addition, the death benefit remains tax-free (meaning no income tax and no estate tax). As the cash value increases, the death benefit will also increase and this growth is also non-taxable. The only way tax is ever due on the policy is (1) if the premiums were paid with pre-tax dollars, (2) if cash value is \"withdrawn\" past basis rather than \"borrowed,\" or (3) if the policy is surrendered. Most whole life policies can be surrendered at any time for the cash value amount, and income taxes will usually only be placed on the gains of the cash account that exceeds the total premium outlay. Thus, many are using whole life insurance policies as a retirement funding vehicle rather than for risk management.\n\nCash values are considered liquid assets because they are easily accessible at any time, usually with a phone call or fax to the insurance company requesting a \"loan\" or \"withdrawal\" from the policy. Most companies will transfer the money into the policy holder's bank account within a few days.\n\nCash values are also liquid enough to be used for investment capital, but only if the owner is financially healthy enough to continue making premium payments (Single premium whole life policies avoid the risk of the insured failing to make premium payments and are liquid enough to be used as collateral. Single premium policies require that the insured pay a one time premium that tends to be lower than the split payments. Because these policies are fully paid at inception, they have no financial risk and are liquid and secure enough to be used as collateral under the insurance clause of collateral assignment.) Cash value access is tax free up to the point of total premiums paid, and the rest may be accessed tax free in the form of policy loans. If the policy lapses, taxes would be due on outstanding loans. If the insured dies, death benefit is reduced by the amount of any outstanding loan balance.\n\nInternal rates of return for participating policies may be much worse than universal life and interest-sensitive whole life (whose cash values are invested in the money market and bonds) because their cash values are invested in the life insurance company and its general account, which may be in real estate and the stock market. However, universal life policies run a much greater risk, and are actually designed to lapse. Variable universal life insurance may outperform whole life because the owner can direct investments in sub-accounts that may do better. If an owner desires a conservative position for his cash values, par whole life is indicated.\n\nReported cash values might seem to \"disappear\" or become \"lost\" when the death benefit is paid out. The reason for this is that cash values are considered to be part of the death benefit. The insurance company pays out the cash values with the death benefit because they are inclusive of each other. This is why loans from the cash value are not taxable as long as the policy is in force (because death benefits are not taxable).\n\n"}
{"id": "2282040", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2282040", "title": "Gospel for Asia", "text": "Gospel for Asia\n\nGospel for Asia (GFA) is a non-profit missions organization, founded by K. P. Yohannan in 1979, focusing on helping the poor and needy in India and Asian countries through the love of God. The organization is located about five miles southwest of Wills Point, Texas, a small community east of Dallas. GFA’s primary aim is to support indigenous missions to \"serve the 'least of these' in Asia\".\n\nGospel for Asia is present in numerous countries, including India, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Laos and Thailand.\n\nGospel For Asia was founded on the convictions of its President, K.P. Yohannan regarding the people in his culture in Asia. Since its beginning in 1980 , K.P. and his wife, Gisela Yohannan, have dedicated their lives to spread the knowledge of Jesus throughout South Asia in hopes that people who have never heard of Jesus would have the option to follow the Christian faith. \nAfter learning more about the time and cost of mission trips in the late 70s and early 80s , K.P., with the help of his wife and friends, developed a way for believers in the west to financially support Christian workers who were born and raised in Asia. K.P. began to tour churches in the U.S. to share this opportunity, and many Christian began to pledge $30 a month to support their own missionary in Asia. \nThe goal of GFA focuses on the formation of missionaries native to the nation the missionary is serving, with special emphasis on Asia. The organization has defined its primary mission field as being those people that live in the 10/40 Window, a rectangular region extending from west Africa to east Asia and between 10 and 40 degrees north longitude. By concentrating on this region GFA ministers to a dense population of largely poor communities that have had limited or no exposure to the Christian faith.\n\nGFA's main focus is to train and equip national missionaries. Yohannan has stated that he does not limit \"national missionaries\" to formal nation-states, instead focusing on differences in culture and language to define nationalities. This approach might result in several specialized missionary groups within a single nation-state, from large cities and regions down to small tribes and villages. In 2018 GFA reported that they have over 16,000 missionaries and church planters in 18 Asian nations.\n\nGospel for Asia raises funds for the building of simple Christian worship centers in small villages to educate new disciples as well as provide a visible meeting place for Christians. However, they have built several large cathedral type buildings in major cities. Examples are St. Thomas Believers Church Cathedral in Thiruvalla and another in an upscale neighborhood Hauz Khas. They claim approximately 16 churches or mission stations are created every day. Similarly, GFA states they distribute native-language bibles and evangelical Christian literature to the region in order to strengthen churches and promote proclamation of the Christian faith. In keeping with their commitment to a simple and cost effective stewardship of donations, GFA is able to distribute 200 tracts of gospel literature for $1.\n\nRadio in Asia is a broadcast that is especially designed to reach Asian communities. Athmeeya Yathra (Spiritual Journey) radio programs reaches more than a billion people and are translated into 11 languages. More than 900 radio stations across North America, Europe and Australia air Road to Reality.[17] Athmeeyayathra Television’s youtube channel provides biblical video content to over 40,000 subscribers in a culturally appropriate manner.\n\nGFA claims to have over 56 bible colleges in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Sri Lanka s with the purpose of training native missionaries within their own dialects and cultures so that they will be effective ministers. The program includes three years of instruction, including field instruction and experience. They claim that over 9000 native missionaries have been trained through these institutions. According to reports, 98 percent of GFA’s Bible college graduates go on to preach in areas previously untouched by the Christian faith, typically establishing a fellowship in these areas within one year of arriving.\n\nBridge of Hope is a child sponsorship program for poor families in underserved communities, especially lower-caste families and Dalits. Child sponsorship provides education, three daily meals, and access to medical care. Education and literacy rates are extremely low in the Dalit communities, as families continue to suffer in a cycle of poverty. GFA’s Bridge of Hope program seeks to relieve some of this suffering through education, physical and spiritual care. Through the Bridge of Hope program, in 2018 over 200,000 women received healthcare training and over 10,000 received vocational training. \n\nMillions in Asia suffer from diseases linked to sanitation and clean water deficiencies. GFA digs wells in communities where water is scarce during parts or most of the year. These wells are built for long-term use near churches, bible colleges or Bridge of Hope centers, and each well is maintained by a local pastor. These wells provide free, clean water to individuals regardless of caste, class, social designation or religion. In 2016, 6,822\nJesus Wells were drilled in communities needing clean water. In 2018, over 10,000 BioSand water filters were given to families in order to provide easier access to clean drinking water.\n\nBeliever's Church owns and operates a variety of hospitals, colleges and public and residential schools. Most of these are for-profit enterprises. Narada News has reported that BC will be expanding their investments by building as many as 500 additional international schools. The list of what is currently operating includes some hospitals and clinics, some colleges, 9 schools located within small towns of southern Rajasthan, and at least four public schools. According to recent reports, GFA distributed over 350,000 mosquito nets and conducted more than 1,000 medical camps in impoverished communities in 2018. \n\nIn 2014, the Believers’ Church purchased the Cheruvally Estate, a 2,268-acre (9.18 km2) rubber estate in Kerala, India as an investment to help fund social work among underdeveloped communities. In mid-2015, the government initially confiscated the land from the Believers’ Church in order to build an airport, but that decision was appealed. After a 3-year long legal battle between the government and the Believers’ Church, it was decided by an Indian High Court that the Believers’ Church has the ownership right of the Cheruvally Estate and the government must pay them for the land if they still choose to build an airport in that location.\n\nGospel for Asia-supported field partners joined forces with the Nepal government to provide disaster relief in the wake of the devastating earthquake that hit Nepal in 2015. The organization helped by providing food, water and medical supplies. Following the initial relief efforts, GFA’s founder K.P. Yohannan met with the Prime Minister of Nepal.\n\nOne of their longest ongoing efforts to date, Gospel for Asia’s Jesus Wells provide clean drinking water to Asian villages with insufficient access to safe, clean water sources. By 2018, the organization helped construct almost 7,000 wells and BioSand water filters. The wells are typically maintained by Gospel for Asia-supported pastors or their church members, preventing the wells from breaking down and ensuring they last for up to 2 decades.\n\nGFA’s Bridge of Hope after-school program assists underprivileged villages through ongoing literacy and education for their boys and girls. This education helps children and their families to overcome generational poverty and avoid the worlds of bonded labor and sex-slave trade. As of now, there are more than 600 of these centers in existence. Students at the centers receive daily education and a nutritious meal, school supplies and uniforms as well as free medical care. GFA is using these centers as a way to alleviate the root causes of impoverishment and gender discrimination in Asian countries as well as inhumane child labor practices.\n\nAccording to reports, in 2018 GFA assisted “more than 70,000 children, free medical services in over 1,200 villages and remote communities, 4,000 wells drilled, 11,000 water filters installed, Christmas gifts for more than 200,000 needy families, and spiritual teaching available in 110 languages in 14 nations through radio ministry.”\n\nIn 2018, flooding in Kerala left over 200,000 Indian people without homes. GFA’s primary field partner saw their Kerala headquarters suffer from severe flooding. Many Bridge of Hope centers also suffered damage. But GFA’s filed partner volunteers delivered medical supplies, clothes, food and fresh water to flooding victims throughout the area. The estimated recovery time from these floods is five years and GFA-supported filed partners plan to assist for as long as necessary.\n\nGFA also contributed to relief efforts after the Easter bombings in Sri Lanka in April 2019. They provided victims with food and other emergency supplies. One of GFA’s supported social workers lost five family members in the bombings. In addition, two bombs were found near GFA-supported offices.\n\nGFA has or had 14 known affiliated LLCs registered in Willis Point, TX as well as national offices in various countries in which they operate mission efforts.\nThe GFA Canada office, established in 1986, is located in Ontario, Canada and provides disaster relief among other humanitarian efforts to communities in India.\n\nIn 2014, a group of over 10 former Gospel for Asia staff members called the GFA Diaspora wrote two letters. While their concerns were mostly regarding GFA leadership, they were also concerned for GFA's donors. \n\nThese letters from former staff, along with their request to meet with the board and discuss the issues, brought about a supposed internal investigation by GFA that was completed by Gayle Erwin, a member of GFA's board. Upon the completion of Erwin's investigation, a report was released. \n\nErwin later admitted, after resigning from Gospel for Asia's board, that the report was dictated to him by GFA's president and founder Moran Mor Athanasius Yohan Metropolitan (formerly known as K. P. Yohannan) who was displeased with Erwin's actual findings and original report. According to Erwin, \"When I first presented the conclusions of my investigation to KP (with David Carroll present) KP glanced at it, declared that he was a speed reader, and began what I will simply call an ugly scene filled with brutal expressions I don’t wish to repeat...\". Erwin's report was discarded and a new report was written and given to the board, which was portrayed as Erwin's own report. Erwin wrote a letter to GFA President K.P. Yohannan on March 17, 2015 after seeing the false report. In this letter, he states \"I think you are well aware that I cannot agree with this letter except for the generic niceties about wanting biblical reconciliation\", and also \"I think you exonerate yourself and GFA.\" \n\nErwin eventually provided his original report to the GFA Diaspora group, along with an apology for allowing the false report to be distributed.\n\nIn September of 2015, GFA lost their 36-year membership in the financial standards advocacy group Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability, with the ECFA reporting that GFA had not met many of their required standards of excellence in financial accountability and governance. \n\nThe ECFA had been conducting and investigation into Gospel for Asia for four months before releasing the results and revoking the organization's membership. The ECFA states that GFA's membership was \"Terminated for failure to comply with: \n\n\nThe ECFA also noted in their report that \"Certain information provided to ECFA by GFA that was crucial to our review was, at least initially, inaccurate.\" and also that \"Certain pertinent information about the compliance issues was not revealed to ECFA by GFA until late in the review process.\". Additionally the ECFA stated that \"We have learned significant information from sources unrelated to GFA that we should have learned directly from GFA.\" In the letter revoking GFA's membership, the ECFA listed seventeen concerns.\n\nThe GFA board responded with a statement that noted \"ECFA's decision was made after conducting a special review of Gospel for Asia, and we respect ECFA's evaluation. Our response was to begin a focused review and to implement the ECFA's recommended improvements\".\n\nIn 2017 Gospel for Asia was accused by Arkansas couple Garland Murphy and his wife Phyllis of raising funds for charity \"while covertly diverting the money to a multimillion-dollar personal empire.\" The couple filed a class action RICO anti-fraud lawsuit against GFA's president and several GFA leaders, seeking to substantiate GFA's claims of where it spent the money donors gave to the organization. The case was settled after three years of court proceedings in which GFA and the plaintiff agreed “all donations designated for use in the field were ultimately sent to the field.” Those entitled to join the class action were those United States residents who donated to Gospel for Asia between the dates of January 1, 2009 and September 10, 2018. Information regarding the lawsuit has been published on the official Murphy v Gospel for Asia website.\n\nThat court case states that in 2013, “Despite GFA’s explicit representations that it would spend in the field 100 percent of every dollar donors designated for the field, GFA spent only $14.9 million of $118.6 million on actual relief efforts, instead spending far more on salaries and overhead,” according to the complaint. \"The Murphys (the plaintiffs), of Bentonville, Arkansas, say that Gospel for Asia raised more than $450 million in donations from the United States alone from 2007 to 2013, much of which Yohannan redirected to his personal empire.\" \n\nOn 4 June 2018 Federal Court Judge Brooks issued an order for GFA to pay for a Special Master to oversee the gathering of evidence for the discovery phase. Judge Brooks stated, \"Therefore, the court finds that the defendants abusive conduct in this case since August constitutes a willful violation of its clear discovery orders.\" In February 2019 Gospel for Asia lost an appeal denying a stay against discovery. \n\nAs Judge Brooks noted, “The fundamental question in this case has always been whether these entities have in fact redirected donated money in violation of promises that were made to their donors around the world.” Gospel for Asia denied the Plaintiffs’ allegations, maintaining all money designated for the field went to the field. GFA denied all misdirection of funds and willful misleading of donors. \n\nAt the end of February 2019 a settlement was announced. Gospel for Asia agreed to pay 37 million dollars to refund donations to 200,000 donors, $12,210,000 in Plaintiff's attorney fees and $750,000 in Plaintiff's attorney’s expenses as expressed in the Final Order and Judgment. According to the settlement agreement, “All funds designated to the field were sent to the field and used for ministry purposes; and no Individual Defendant, as defined herein, received any improper personal gain or enrichment from or related to donated funds.”\n\nThe settlement agreement also concludes that  K. P. Yohannan’s wife Gisela is to be removed from the board of the charity for three years and for Garland Murphy, one of the plaintiffs, to be given a seat and another person appointed to the board acceptable to both Murphy and K. P. Yohannan; in addition a subcommittee of the board which will include Murphy but neither Yohannan nor his son, Daniel Punnose, will produce annual reports for the board, the Judge and the lead counsel for three years.\n\nAlthough the settlement has been reached, GFA maintains that the settlement is not an acknowledgment of guilt.\n\nThere are also alleged problems with the Canada office.\n\nThere is also news that the United Kingdom GFA office has received the attention of the UK Charity Commission, which is their government agency that investigates charity-related fraud.\n\nGospel for Asia's New Zealand office operated out of space provided to them by the church Calvary Chapel Auckland. Once Calvary Chapel became aware of the controversies stirring in the United States, an investigation into GFA's practices was launched. Finding that the work on the field did not at all resemble what GFA had presented to the church and that many for-profit enterprises were run using donated funds, GFA was told to leave the building and the church ceased supporting the ministry. The office in New Zealand was closed for a time, but may now have reopened in a new location. The local staff having resigned amid the controversy, staff from the United States were sent over to keep the doors open.\n\nThere is also considerable controversy in India considering GFA. The Times of India has reported that \"The Believers Church, founded by Moran Mor Athanasius Yohan Metropolitan (formerly known as K. P. Yohannan), and three NGOs associated with it have been barred from bringing in foreign funds to India with the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) canceling their FCRA registrations.\" As of September 2017, GFA provided the requested documents for review to MHA and \"Fr Panthapallil said though the MHA website has advertised that the registrations of the four organisations are cancelled, they are still under revision.\" In August 2017, The Hindu (a newspaper in India) reported that, \"The Church of South India (CSI) has decided to pull out from the Kerala Council of Churches (KCC), an ecumenical forum of non-Catholic Protestant Churches in Kerala, in protest against the KCC decision to provide membership to the Believers Church. The latest development has to be viewed in the backdrop of the controversy over the episcopacy claims of the Believers Eastern Church that its head, K.P. Yohannan, was consecrated by the CSI Church.\" Narada News in India reported concerning that, \"The CSI senate committee probed the issue. They came to the conclusion that their bishop was paid huge sums of money and a luxury car for this. The church sacked bishop KJ Samuel from the CSI for this deed.\" \n\nThere is also been an ongoing court case regarding the illegal filling in of wetlands in order to build the Believers Church Medical College Hospital. GFA has been paying a special tax because a \"substantial\" amount of its income is not used for intended purposes of the fundraising. An Indian court said, \"It is not in dispute that substantial income of the assessee trust was not used by both the assessees for the purposes for which they were formed.\" Moran Mor Athanasius Yohan Metropolitan (formerly known as K. P. Yohannan) says that the claims were politically motivated and that the workings of Gospel for Asia and Believers Church are transparent.\n\nGFA has been criticized for engaging in predatory proselytization while providing aid in the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami. The Hindu American Foundation condemned the organization for pressuring vulnerable tsunami victims to convert to Christianity, setting up illegal unregistered orphanages and forcing orphans recite the Christian prayers several times a day.\n\n\n"}

MedImmune acquired \"FluMist\" when it purchased Aviron in 2002 for US$ 1.5 billion. \"FluMist\" sales totaled US$ 104 million in 2008, US$ 54.8 million in 2007, and US$ 36.4 million in 2006.\n\n\"FluMist\" was approved for children two years of age and older in 2007, but initially was approved only for healthy people ages 5 to 49, a significant limitation because it eliminated a significant market—young children who find injections objectionable. Sales of \"FluMist\" fell short of analysts' expectations for the first two years the drug was sold. \"FluMist\" was initially sold in a frozen form, which was difficult for doctors to store.\n\nMedImmune conducted successful clinical trials for a new generation of \"FluMist\" needle-free vaccine, called CAIV-T, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2007, and is now the form offered on the market.\n\nMolecular Vaccines, Inc. was founded by Wayne T.

On 19 June 2007 AstraZeneca completed the acquisition paying US$ 15.2 billion primarily for its drug development pipeline. Analysts have criticised the take-over, claiming that AstraZeneca paid too much. AstraZeneca chose to merge MedImmune with Cambridge Antibody Technology, which it had acquired in 2006, creating a new biologics division under the MedImmune name. AstraZeneca presented the new MedImmune to investors on 7 December 2007.\n\nIn June 2007, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) began enrolling participants in a Phase 1 H5N1 study of an intranasal influenza vaccine candidate based on MedImmune's live, attenuated vaccine technology.\n\nMedImmune said it was making a significant, rapid response with a vaccine to the novel H1N1 variant of influenza, known as swine flu. In June 2009 it won a Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) contract, worth $90m. Under the contract with HHS, MedImmune will continue to make its seasonal FluMist vaccine and also develop a vaccine targeted specifically at the novel H1N1 virus. MedImmune then won a second contract to test its nasal spray flu technology as a viable treatment for the H1N1.\n\nMedImmune received approval from the U.S. FDA for its intranasal novel H1N1 influenza vaccine in September 2009.\n\nMedImmune has over 120 drugs in development for conditions including lupus, COPD, asthma, and many types of cancer.

{"id": "2282048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2282048", "title": "Parametrization (atmospheric modeling)", "text": "Parametrization (atmospheric modeling)\n\nParameterization in a weather or climate model in the context of numerical weather prediction is a method of replacing processes that are too small-scale or complex to be physically represented in the model by a simplified process. This can be contrasted with other processes—e.g., large-scale flow of the atmosphere—that are explicitly resolved within the models. Associated with these parameterizations are various \"parameters\" used in the simplified processes. Examples include the descent rate of raindrops, convective clouds, simplifications of the atmospheric radiative transfer on the basis of atmospheric radiative transfer codes, and cloud microphysics. Radiative parameterizations are important to both atmospheric and oceanic modeling alike. Atmospheric emissions from different sources within individual grid boxes also need to be parameterized to determine their impact on air quality.\n\nWeather and climate model gridboxes have sides of between and . A typical cumulus cloud has a scale of less than , and would require a grid even finer than this to be represented physically by the equations of fluid motion. Therefore, the processes that such clouds represent are \"parameterized\", by processes of various sophistication. In the earliest models, if a column of air in a model gridbox was unstable (i.e., the bottom warmer than the top) then it would be overturned, and the air in that vertical column mixed. More sophisticated schemes add enhancements, recognizing that only some portions of the box might convect and that entrainment and other processes occur. Weather models that have gridboxes with sides between and can explicitly represent convective clouds, although they still need to parameterize cloud microphysics.\n\nThe formation of large-scale (stratus-type) clouds is more physically based: they form when the relative humidity reaches some prescribed value. Still, sub grid scale processes need to be taken into account. Rather than assuming that clouds form at 100% relative humidity, the cloud fraction can be related to a critical relative humidity of 70% for stratus-type clouds, and at or above 80% for cumuliform clouds, reflecting the sub grid scale variation that would occur in the real world. Portions of the precipitation parameterization include the condensation rate, energy exchanges dealing with the change of state from water vapor into liquid drops, and the microphysical component which controls the rate of change from water vapor to water droplets.\n\nThe amount of solar radiation reaching ground level in rugged terrain, or due to variable cloudiness, is parameterized as this process occurs on the molecular scale. This method of parameterization is also done for the surface flux of energy between the ocean and the atmosphere in order to determine realistic sea surface temperatures and type of sea ice found near the ocean's surface. Also, the grid size of the models is large when compared to the actual size and roughness of clouds and topography. Sun angle as well as the impact of multiple cloud layers is taken into account. Soil type, vegetation type, and soil moisture all determine how much radiation goes into warming and how much moisture is drawn up into the adjacent atmosphere. Thus, they are important to parameterize.\n\nAir quality forecasting attempts to predict when the concentrations of pollutants will attain levels that are hazardous to public health. The concentration of pollutants in the atmosphere is determined by transport, diffusion, chemical transformation, and ground deposition. Alongside pollutant source and terrain information, these models require data about the state of the fluid flow in the atmosphere to determine its transport and diffusion. Within air quality models, parameterizations take into account atmospheric emissions from multiple relatively tiny sources (e.g. roads, fields, factories) within specific grid boxes.\n\nAs model resolution increases, errors associated with moist convective processes are increased as assumptions which are statistically valid for larger grid boxes become questionable once the grid boxes shrink in scale towards the size of the convection itself. At resolutions greater than T639, which has a grid box dimension of about , the Arakawa-Schubert convective scheme produces minimal convective precipitation, making most precipitation unrealistically stratiform in nature.\n\nWhen a physical process is parameterized, two choices have to be made: what is the structural form (for instance, two variables can be related linearly) and what is the exact value of the parameters (for instance, the constant of proportionality). The process of determining the exact values of the parameters in a parameterization is called calibration, or sometimes less precise, tuning. Calibration is a difficult process, and different strategies are used to do it. One popular method is to run a model, or a submodel, and compare it to a small set of selected metrics, such as temperature. The parameters that lead to the model run which resembles reality best are chosen.\n\n"}

Federal Aviation Administration records say it had 134,386 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 148,077 in 2009 and 163,611 in 2010.\n\nThe airport covers 1,281 acres (518 ha) at an elevation of 6,685 feet (2,038 m). Its one runway, 3/21, is 9,201 by 150 feet (2,804 x 46 m) asphalt.\n\nIn 2011 the airport had 29,020 aircraft operations, average 79 per day: 69% general aviation, 22% air taxi, 8% airline, and 2% military. 70 aircraft were then based at the airport: 87% single-engine, 11% multi-engine, and 1% helicopter.\n\nThe airport has three boarding gates, five plane stands, a pre-security restaurant and a gift shop. It has free wi-fi internet terminal-wide.\n\nThe first scheduled airline service to the La Plata County Airport began on November 27, 1946, when Monarch Air Lines initiated flights to Denver with stops at Monte Vista, Canon City, Pueblo, and Colorado Springs, Colorado. Douglas DC-3 aircraft were used. By April 1, 1947, new routes were added to Albuquerque and Salt Lake City, each making several stops en route. Durango would be the connecting hub for the three routes. On June 1, 1950, Monarch was merged into Frontier Airlines (1950-1986) and a new route to Phoenix was added making five stops. The flights to Albuquerque and Salt Lake City had ended in the early 1950s as they were redirected through Farmington, New Mexico which then became Frontier's connecting hub for the four corners states. In 1959 Frontier acquired 44-passenger Convair 340 aircraft and new nonstop flights were added from Durango to Denver as well as new flights to Phoenix and Tucson that only stopped in Farmington. By 1966 the Convair 340s had been upgraded to Convair 580 turboprop aircraft and all of the original Douglas DC-3 aircraft had been retired. Direct flights to Albuquerque were reinstated in 1969. During the summer of 1977, the La Plata County Airport was closed so that the main runway could be extended to handle jet traffic. Frontier Airlines then initiated the first jets to the airport in November, 1977 with Boeing 737 flights to Denver making one stop in Pueblo, Colorado. Weekend flights were also added to Dallas/Fort Worth for the 1977–78 ski season. The flights to Phoenix, still operating with Convair 580s, were discontinued in 1979 and flights to Albuquerque ended in 1981. On June 1, 1982, Frontier had retired its Convair 580 aircraft fleet and was operating all 737 jets at Durango, now with nonstop flights to Denver and return flights stopping in Farmington. More weekend ski season jet flights were added to Dallas/Fort Worth, Houston, Atlanta, and Los Angeles for the 1982–83, 1983–84, and 1984–85 winter ski seasons. The 737 jets to Denver ended on October 1, 1984, and were replaced with Convair 580s operated by Frontier Commuter. Frontier Commuter ended all service in January, 1985 and after Frontier's ski season flights ended by April 1, 1985, all Frontier representation at Durango was discontinued.\n\nSince the beginning of airline deregulation in 1978, many carriers, small and large, have served Durango:\n\nAspen Airways flew to Denver from late 1978 through 1990 using Convair 580s and in 1985 introduced British Aerospace BAe 146-100 jets. In 1986 Aspen became a United Express feeder carrier for United Airlines at the carriers' Denver hub. Aspen also flew to Albuquerque briefly in 1979 and again for the winter 1989–90 ski season.\n\nRocky Mountain Airways briefly flew to Denver in January, 1979 using de Havilland Canada DHC-7 Dash 7s. The carrier returned from 1987 through 1991 operating as Continental Express again using Dash-7s as well as ATR 42s, and Beechcraft 1900Cs.\n\nZia Airlines flew commuter flights to Albuquerque in early 1980 using Handley Page Jetstreams.\n\nDesert Pacific Airlines flew to Los Angeles in 1980 making five stops en route and using Piper Navajos.\n\nSun West Airlines flew to Albuquerque and Phoenix from 1980 through 1984 using Piper Navajos and later upgrading to Beechcraft C99s.\n\nMesa Airlines operated multiple services at Durango. Flights to Albuquerque began in 1983 with Beechcraft C99s, later upgrading to Beechcraft 1900Ds and the Albuquerque flights were operated on and off through 2005. Service to Denver began in 1990 as United Express and continued into 1998 using Beechcraft 1300s and 1900s and later upgraded with Embraer EMB-120 Brasilias and de Havilland Canada DHC-8 Dash 8s. Service to Phoenix began in 1987 and was changed to America West Express in 1992. Beechcraft 1900s, Embraer Brasilia's and Dash-8's were all used. Canadair CRJ-200 regional jets were introduced in 1999. America West Airlines merged into US Airways in 2007 at which time the Phoenix flights began operating as US Airways Express. Then in 2015 US Airways merged into American Airlines which changed the Phoenix flights to American Eagle. All flights were upgraded with Canadair CRJ-900 aircraft a short time later and continue operating today.\n\nPioneer Airlines flew to Albuquerque and Denver in 1982 and 1983 using Fairchild Swearingen Metroliners.\n\nTrans-Colorado Airlines began Durango service in mid 1983 with service to Denver and later added flights to Albuquerque and Colorado Springs using Fairchild Swearingen Metroliners. The carrier became a Continental Express feeder in 1986 and continued the Denver flights through 1988 adding the Convair 580 aircraft as well.\n\nAmerica West Airlines operated mainline Boeing 737 jet service to Phoenix from 1984 through 1991. Some flights would stop at Albuquerque or Grand Junction. The 737 jets were replaced with Dash-8 props from 1991 through 1992 then service was contracted out to Mesa Airlines as America West Express.\n\nBritt Airways followed Rocky Mountain Airways by operating Denver flights as Continental Express from 1991 through 1994 using Beechcraft 1900s and ATR 42s.\n\nGP Express then followed Britt Airways by operating Continental Connection service to Denver from 1994 through 1995 using Beechcraft 1900s.\n\nAmerican Airlines began ski season service during the winter of 1994–95 with flights to Dallas/Fort Worth using McDonnell Douglas MD-80 mainline jets. The service continued for seven winter ski seasons, ending with the 2000–01 season.\n\nReno Air operated one daily flight to Albuquerque which continued on to Los Angeles for the 1996–97 ski season.

The carrier used Dornier 328 prop aircraft. \n\nRio Grande Air flew commuter flights to Albuquerque from 2000 through 2002 using Cessna 208 Caravan aircraft.\n\nUnited Express service to Denver was transferred in 1998 from Mesa Airlines to Air Wisconsin, and Great Lakes Airlines. Air Wisconsin flew Dornier 328prop and British Aerospace BAe-146 jets through 2003. Great Lakes flew Beechcraft 1900Ds through 2001. Mesa Airlines returned with Dash-8 flights to Denver from 2003 through 2010. SkyWest Airlines began United Express flights in 2001 with Embraer Brasilia's and service continues today, now with all regional jets. ExpressJet flew Embraer-145's from 2010 through 2015. Republic Airways began flights in 2012 with Dash-8-Q400's and later upgraded with Embraer 170's and 175's. GoJet began in 2014 with CRJ-700's and Trans States Airlines in 2015 with Embraer-145's, all to Denver. New Saturday only flights were added in the summer of 2019 to Chicago and Houston by SkyWest Airlines.\n\nAmerican Eagle began serving Durango from Dallas/Fort Worth from December, 2001 through September, 2002. The service returned in mid 2011 and has operated year-round since. Embraer EMB-135 and Embraer EMB-145 regional jets were first used. American Eagle service to Phoenix was added in late 2015 operated by both Mesa Airlines and SkyWest after American and US Airways merged. American Eagle service to Dallas/Fort Worth and Phoenix is now solely provided by Mesa Airlines using Canadair CRJ-900 regional jets. Seasonal Saturday only flights during the summer are now flown to Chicago and Los Angeles by SkyWest Airlines.\n\nContinental Express service operated by ExpressJet flew to Houston from December, 2001 through September 2002 then again for the winter 2002–03 ski season using Embraer EMB-145 regional jets.\n\nDelta Connection service operated by SkyWest Airlines flew to Salt Lake City from mid-2006 through late 2008 using Canadair CRJ-200 regional jets.\n\nThe new Frontier Airlines provided service to Denver at first by way of its subsidiary company, Lynx Aviation, using de Havilland Canada DHC-8-402 Q400 prop aircraft from April 22, 2008, through 2011. Service was upgraded in 2012 to Embraer EMB-190 regional jets operated by Republic Airways then upgraded again from 2013 through 2014 using Frontier Airlines mainline Airbus A319s. All service ended on October 25, 2014.\n\nAll flights now are regional jets. American Eagle, flying for American Airlines, has year round nonstops to Dallas/Fort Worth and Phoenix on Canadair CRJ-900s and operates summer weekend seasonal flights to Chicago and Los Angeles. United Express flights nonstop to Denver are flown on Canadair CRJ-200, Canadair CRJ-700, Embraer ERJ-145, and Embraer 175 aircraft.

It is located near the modern city of Yerevan in Armenia. The site was once a fortress and governmental centre with towered and buttressed perimeter walls, massive gates, a parade ground within its walls, and storage rooms that entirely occupied the ground floor. The site of the city, palace and citadel together measure over . The name \"Karmir Blur\" translates to \"Red Hill\" because of the hill's reddish hue. It became this color after the city was set on fire and the upper walls which were made of tuff fell and crumbled because of the heat. After the tuff was heated by the fire, it took on a more intense red color and therefore the hill became red. The lower portions of the walls were left standing after the fire since they were built with a stronger stone. Teishebaini is situated at a height of .\n\nThe city of Teishebaini was built by Rusa II in mid-7th century BC to protect the eastern borders of Urartu from the barbaric Cimmerians and Scythians. Within the city was a governors palace that contained a hundred and twenty rooms spreading across more than , and citadel named the Citadel of Teisheba after the Urartian god of war. The palace was made of stone, with timber ceilings, and timber columns that supported the roof. The construction of the city, palace, and the citadel were not fully finished until the reign of Rusa III, some 50 years later.\n\nAgriculture was essential to the city, as was raising livestock. The Urartians built massive water canals, some of which are still in use to this day. Archaeological excavations have shown that lentils, hemp, peas, sesame, wheat, and barley were some of the grains that were grown in the area, as well as grapes and plums. The grape seeds that had been found were examined further and it revealed that twelve varieties of grape were grown in the surrounding area of Teishebaini during this time. All of these ancient varieties and more are still grown to this day in modern Armenia. Smaller ceramic vessels were also found in excavations and are known to have been used in brewing beer made from barley. Other much larger vessels were used for storing foods and wine. Small circular markings on the sides of the containers near the top indicated the amount that could be stored inside. The vessels were usually buried half-way into the soil which naturally kept foods cool.\n\nThe site was discovered in 1939 after being buried for more than two and a half millennia. A cuneiform inscription had been found three years earlier that led to the discovery of the ancient city. It read, 'Rusa Argishti-hini' which translates to \"Rusa, son of Argishti\" also known as Rusa II. Another set of cuneiform inscriptions were found written upon a bronze belt and bronze bolt, both bearing the words \"Rusa Argishti, fortress of the city of Teishebaini.\" The inscriptions helped date the site and tell who its builder was. In 1941 an ivory statuette of the god Teisheba was found within the citadel. The excavations here are considered as one of the most important archaeological discoveries and findings in the Middle East, the Near East and Asia Minor. Some of the findings include carved ivory, stone, ceramics, metal figurines, pottery and an astonishing wide variety of bronze domestic tools and utensils, military equipment decorated with mythological symbols, forms and animals, daggers, swords, helmets, arrows, quivers, shields of an advanced metallurgy, as well as vases, bracelets, earrings and medallions in gold and varied sets of other jewelry. Pottery found in the site was either painted black or had painted designs such as waves of water.\n\nArchaeological evidence shows that the city of Teishebaini was destroyed by fire sometime around the beginning of the 6th century BC. Numerous fragments of cloth, rope, and other items such as seeds have been found charred from the city's destruction. It is thought that Teishebaini was attacked during the night since numerous human remains have been found, and rooms within the buildings still had everything in them as if the people living within the city's walls had no chance to flee. During the excavations, skeletons were found holding objects of gold in their hands. It is theorized that when the city was set on fire, that residents of the city began either to loot or save their own possessions from the burning buildings as the city was under attack.\n\n"}

Van Leer began playing the piano at age three, taught by his mother, and later received lessons from famed pianists Maria Stroo (later Marja Bon) and Gerard Hengeveld. When he was six, van Leer wrote his first composition \"Uncle Willy\", a tribute to family friend and keyboard teacher Willy Buard who helped pay for his father's flute studies at the Conservatoire de Musique de Genève in Geneva. At eleven, van Leer was given a flute by his father who began teaching his son two years later after he discovered van Leer wished to instead pursue jazz music after he discovered the genre particularly through Miles Davis albums. He said, \"I suppose I wanted to reject what I was brought up on. But then I thought the combination of jazz and classical music could be used in rock.\" With his parents and two brothers, eldest Frank and youngest Maarten, who played the bassoon and piano and flute, respectively, the family would often play music at home together. Van Leer also took up painting, modelling, and performing in plays.\n\nVan Leer attended Hilversum Grammar School where he learned English, French, German, Latin and Ancient Greek. His father was the conductor of the school orchestra, for which van Leer played the harpsichord. He joined the Raoul Angenot Quintet, and at eighteen, won an award at inter-school contests for playing \"Andante in C Major\" by Mozart on flute, singing an original love poem to \"Stella by Starlight\" by Davis, a drama improvisation featuring his own poetry, and an original piano composition titled \"Nooit Zal Ik Vergeten (De Nachten Samen met Jou)\" (\"Never Shall I Forget (The Nights Together with You)\". He then joined the Bob de Lat Quartet, who once came fifth in the annual Hilversum jazz contest. After graduating, van Leer did not feel confident enough to attend a music school, so he studied art history at Amsterdam University which he found \"very dry\". He then learned harmony and counterpoint at the Conservatorium van Amsterdam, but disliked the lessons and left early. This was followed by a degree in the flute and composition at the Conservatoire de Musique de Genève. Van Leer also received tutoring on the piano, orchestration and arrangement with composer and conductor Rogier van Otterloo, and organ with Anthon van der Horst. During his time studying, van Leer participated in plays including those by William Shakespeare and John Webster. Van Leer has cited Steve Winwood, Traffic, Brian Wilson, and The Beach Boys as musical influences who helped inspired him to pursue rock music, with Béla Bartók and Johann Sebastian Bach among his favourite composers.\n\nAround 1967, van Leer recorded \"Nooit Zal Ik Vergeten\" which Phonogram Records released as a 7\" single which received little attention. In December 1967, during his first year at Amsterdam University, van Leer, unhappy with the course, landed a leading role in the Webster play \"The Duchess of Malfi\". At one rehearsal, he learned from radio and television presenter Willem Duys that singer and actor Ramses Shaffy was in the process of hiring a final member to his four-piece backing band and vocal group for his upcoming theatre act, \"Shaffy Chantant\". Van Leer had seen Shaffy's performances before and enjoyed the singing and jazz-oriented songs. After he called Shaffy and insisted he was suitable for the part, van Leer got an audition within the hour and secretly took his mother's car to get there. Had the audition failed, van Leer later said he would have pursued an acting career. With a performance of \"Nooit Zal Ik Vergeten\" at the piano, Shaffy was impressed and added van Leer to the cast which included singer Liesbeth List and pianist Louis van Dijk. \"Shaffy Chantant\" ran for almost one year from February 1968 for six nights a week, and van Leer was paid 114 guilders a week. A recording of the act was released in 1968 by Philips Records; van Leer learned from Shaffy years later that the track \"Jij Bent Nu Daarbinnen\" (\"You Are Now Within\") was about him.\n\nIn 1968, during his time with Shaffy, van Leer recorded his second solo single on Philips, \"Zolang de Wereld Nog Draait\" (\"As Long As the World Still Turns\"), a Dutch-language version of \"Les Bicyclettes de Belsize\" by Engelbert Humperdinck. This landed him an invitation from drummer Hans Cleuver in September 1968 to play the flute with bassist Martijn Dresden and himself on \"Jazz and Poetry\", a program on the Catholic radio station KRO. For several months they performed on the station with van Leer on the piano, organ, and the addition of \"strange\" vocals. Van Leer stayed with Shaffy for his next play \"Shaffy Verkeerd\", which opened in January 1969 and featured singer Anneke Grönloh and performances of \"MacArthur Park\" by Jimmy Webb and \"I Shall Be Released\" by Bob Dylan, two songs that influenced van Leer as it \"Opened my eyes to the use of lyrics. Before that I only really concentrated on instrumental music\". Van Leer's final show with Shaffy was \"Sunset Sunkiss\", which received an album release in 1969 on the Philips label with Cleuver and Dresden in the band. This was followed by several performances from the group at some large venues, including shows at the Holland Festival backed by the Metropole Orchestra, the Carré Theatre, and the RAI Centre.\n\nAfter van Leer left Shaffy's theatre group in mid-1969, he formed a three-piece rock band with Cleuver and Dresden, playing local gigs with a set of covers by Traffic and their own material under the early names of Trio Thijs van Leer and Thijs van Leer and the Rebaptised. They also recorded several radio and television commercials. In November 1969 they were joined by guitarist Jan Akkerman, who had performed with the three on \"Sunset Sunkiss\", and settled on the name Focus, thus completing the first line-up of the band. From December 1969 to June 1970, the four were members of the pit band for the Dutch performance of the rock musical \"Hair\".\n\nFocus released their first album, \"Focus Plays Focus\", better known as its international title \"In and Out of Focus\", in August 1970. Van Leer became a prominent figure in the group, writing the majority of their songs and singing English lyrics. After a line-up change, the band released \"Moving Waves\" (1971) that included their international hit single \"Hocus Pocus\" which featured van Leer's distinct vocals, yodelling, whistling, and scat singing. His influence from the Sufi movement through his mother is displayed in \"Moving Waves\", a piano and vocal composition he wrote when he was sixteen and quotes a teaching from its creator, Inayat Khan. The album closes with \"Eruption\", a 22-minute track that is \"based on a musical idea\" by van Leer who gained inspiration from the operas \"Orfeo ed Euridice\" by Christoph Willibald Gluck and \"L'Orfeo\" by Claudio Monteverdi, combining rock, jazz and classical influences. \"Focus 3\" (1972) includes the band's second hit single \"Sylvia\" and includes van Leer's organ and operatic vocals. Van Leer's classical background is evident on the van Leer/Akkerman penned title track on \"Hamburger Concerto\" from 1974, based on \"Variations on a Theme by Haydn\" by Johannes Brahms.\n\nIn 1969, van Leer played the flute on \"Love Me or Leave Me\" (1969) by Dutch singer Rita Hovink. The following year, van Leer wrote, arranged and conducted music for singer Bojoura for her third album, \"The Beauty of Bojoura\" (1970). She had previously worked with van Leer's trio with Shaffy, singing a cover of \"Frank Mills\" from \"Hair\". Robin Lent used van Leer to play piano and flute on \"Scarecrow's Journey\" (1971), and arranged and played the flute on the Dutch cast production album of \"Oh! Calcutta!\" (1971).\n\nVan Leer headed Focus through several line-up changes, and by early 1976 he and bass player Bert Ruiter was the only remaining original members; the group disbanded in 1978.\n\nIn 2002, van Leer reformed Focus which has since released the albums \"Focus 8\", \"Focus 9 / New Skin\", \"Live In Europe\", \"Focus X,\", \"Golden Oldies\", \"Focus 8.5 / Beyond the Horizon\", \"The Focus Family Album\" and \"Focus 11\".\n\nIn mid-1972, after securing a solo recording deal with CBS Records, van Leer released his first solo album, \"Introspection\". It features a selection of classical pieces by Bach and Gabriel Faure, Focus songs, and original compositions arranged for flute and orchestra by van Otterloo, and soprano vocals by Letty de Jong. \"Introspection\" was a commercial success in the Netherlands, reaching number one for three weeks in early 1973 and earning a gold certification. In late 1975, van Leer released \"Introspection 2\" which spent one week at number one in the Netherlands during a 19-week stay in the top 10. Van Leer continued the album series with \"Introspection 3\", in 1977.\n\nAfter Focus split in 1978, van Leer continued with his solo career and took part in various projects. He formed the rock band Conxi, featuring Dutch and Senegalese musicians, and a rock group Van Leer with an American singer.\n\nIn the early 1980s, van Leer worked and toured with Spanish singer Miguel Ríos playing keyboards and flute on his albums \"Extraños en el escaparate\" (1981), \"Rock & Ríos\" (1982) and \"El rock de una noche de verano\" (1983).\n\nIn 1981, van Leer formed the multi-national band Pedal Point with musicians Tato Gomez and from Chile and Paul Shigihara from Japan. They recorded a double album, \"Dona Nobis Pacem\", based on a composition van Leer had written that he later cited as \"one of the most important compositions of mine\", and a high point of his career in an artistic sense.\n\nIn 1985, van Leer reunited with Akkerman and together recorded \"\" (1985).\n\nVan Leer was one of the artists who recorded the song \"Shalom from Holland\" (written by Simon Hammelburg and Ron Klipstein) as a token of solidarity to the Israeli people, threatened by missiles from Iraq, during the first Gulf War in 1991.\n\nHe also appeared as a guest musician on the album, \"Into the Electric Castle\", by Arjen Anthony Lucassen's musical project Ayreon.\n\nIn 2008, Explore Multimedia released van Leer's first solo album in almost a decade, \"The Home Concert\". The album features recordings made in his living room as he played material for \"Focus 9\". The album is exclusively available online.\n\nOn 13 September 2008, van Leer was made a Knight of the Order of Orange-Nassau for \"special services to music.\"\n\nIn 2010, van Leer performed at a concert with Raccomandata Ricevuta Ritorno to celebrate 40 years of imaginative music\n\nOn 15 May 1972, van Leer married Rosalie Peters. Together they had two children: daughter Bella and son Banten. The marriage ended in divorce by the early 1980s. He subsequently married Thea van der Kaay, ex-wife of Ruud Jacobs, but after twenty years they divorced too. Together they had three children: Eva and Berenice and son Ruben. Presently van Leer lives in Lathum, the Netherlands with his third wife, Annelies Lommen.\n\nSolo albums\n\n\n\n"}

Beginning in 1962 Rudd worked extensively with saxophonist Archie Shepp.\n\nRudd was born in Sharon, Connecticut on November 17, 1935. He attended the Hotchkiss School and graduated from Yale University, where he played with Eli's Chosen Six, a dixieland band of students that Rudd joined in the mid-1950s. The sextet played the boisterous trad jazz style of the day, and recorded two albums, including one for Columbia Records. His collaborations with Shepp, Cecil Taylor, John Tchicai, and Steve Lacy grew out of the lessons learned while playing rags and stomps for drunken college kids in Connecticut. Rudd later taught ethnomusicology at Bard College and the University of Maine.\n\nOn and off, for a period of three decades, he assisted Alan Lomax with his world music song style (Cantometrics) and Global Jukebox projects.\n\nIn the 1960s, Rudd participated in free jazz recordings such as the New York Art Quartet; the soundtrack for the 1964 movie \"New York Eye and Ear Control\"; the album \"Communications\" by the Jazz Composer's Orchestra; and in collaborations with Don Cherry, Larry Coryell, Pharoah Sanders, and Gato Barbieri. Rudd had lifelong friendships with saxophonists Shepp and Lacy, and performed and recorded the music of Thelonious Monk with Lacy.\n\nRudd and his producer and partner Verna Gillis went to Mali in 2000 and 2001. His album \"MALIcool\" (2001), a cross-cultural collaboration with kora player Toumani Diabaté and other Malian musicians, represented the first time the trombone had been featured in a recording of Malian traditional music.\n\nIn 2004, Rudd brought his Trombone Shout Band to perform at the 4th Festival au Désert in Essakane, Tombouctou Region, Mali. In 2005, he extended his reach further, recording an album with the Mongolian Buryat Band, a traditional music group of musicians from Mongolia and Buryatia, entitled \"Blue Mongol\". He also conducted master classes and workshops both in the United States and around the world.\n\nRudd died of prostate cancer on December 21, 2017, at home in Kerhonkson, New York. His archives were donated to the Worcester Polytechnic Institute.\n\nOn June 25, 2019, \"The New York Times Magazine\" listed Roswell Rudd among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The cover art is a pastiche of the artwork used on various \"Sound Effects\" records produced by the BBC during the 1970s. It is their only album co-produced by the band, and contains the only album track co-written by the entire band, \"Music for the Last Couple\". The album was released on 28 November 1980.\n\nPaul Weller is known to have opined \"Sound Affects\" as the best album the Jam released throughout their career; freely admitting the Beatles' \"Revolver\" had been a major influence upon much of the material from the album.\n\nMusical influences noted include post-punk groups such as Wire, Gang of Four, and Joy Division and, particularly evident in Rick Buckler's drumming, Michael Jackson's \"Off the Wall\" album. Frontman Paul Weller said at the time that he considered the album a cross between \"Off the Wall\" and \"Revolver\". In BBC Radio 6 Music's documentary \"The Jam: Made in Britain\", Weller cited it as his favourite Jam album.\n\nThe album features the group's second UK number one single, \"Start!\", built around an almost exact copy of the bassline and a homage to the guitar solo from the Beatles' \"Taxman\", the first track on \"Revolver\". Polydor pushed for \"Pretty Green\" to be the first single released, but Weller insisted on \"Start!\". This involved consulting a few of the band's friends as to what they thought the best release would be. Weller had Polydor A&R man Dennis Munday ask a small peer group of his friends who had been present throughout the recording sessions at the Town House and prior demo recordings at Polydor studios. Given the choice, they chose \"Start!\" as the best single release and the decision was made to release it. The decision was vindicated when \"Start!\" topped the British singles charts in its third week after entering at number 3. \"Pretty Green\" includes a funk bassline and rhythm with melodic guitar breaks and psychedelic sound effects. \"That's Entertainment\" is an acoustic ballad. \"Boy About Town\" and \"Dream Time\" include horns.\n\nIn 2006, \"Q\" magazine placed the album at No. 15 in its list of \"40 Best Albums of the '80s\".\n\nNME ranked \"Sound Affects\" as No. 487 on their list of 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\n\n\"Sound Affects\" spent 19 weeks on the UK album charts, rising to No. 2 in late 1980. In the U.S., the album spent 11 weeks on the \"Billboard 200\" album charts and reached its peak position of No. 72 in February 1981.\n\nThe 2010 rerelease also charted in the UK, reaching No. 63 in November of that year.\n\n\n\"Sound Affects\" was re-issued on 8 November 2010 as a 2 CD Deluxe Edition to celebrate its 30th Anniversary.\n\n\n\nAll songs by Paul Weller except where stated\n\n\nNote ♠ – Tracks previously unreleased\n\n\n"}

Ayala\n\nFrancisco José Ayala Pereda (born March 12, 1934) is a Spanish-American evolutionary biologist and philosopher who was a longtime faculty member at the University of California, Irvine and University of California, Davis. He is a former Dominican priest, ordained in 1960, but left the priesthood that same year. After graduating from the University of Salamanca, he moved to the United States in 1961 to study for a PhD at Columbia University. There, he studied for his doctorate under Theodosius Dobzhansky, graduating in 1964. He became a US citizen in 1971.\n\nHe has been President and Chairman of the Board of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. At University of California, Irvine, his academic appointments included University Professor and Donald Bren Professor of Biological Sciences, Ecology & Evolutionary Biology (School of Biological Sciences), Professor of Philosophy (School of Humanities), and Professor of Logic and the Philosophy of Science (School of Social Sciences).\n\nOn July 1, 2018, Dr. Ayala officially resigned from the University of California, Irvine, due to substantiated sexual harassment claims. His name was removed from the School of Biological Sciences, the Science Library, as well as various graduate fellowships, scholarship programs, and endowed chairs. Details of the charges were made public online on July 20, 2018 in an elaborate 97-page investigative report detailing the sexual harassment that occurred as early as 2003 and as recently as 2018.\n\nHe is known for his research on population and evolutionary genetics, and has been called the \"Renaissance Man of Evolutionary Biology\". His \"discoveries have opened up new approaches to the prevention and treatment of diseases that affect hundreds of millions of individuals worldwide\", including demonstrating the reproduction of \"Trypanosoma cruzi\", the agent of Chagas disease, is mostly the product of cloning, and that only a few clones account for most of this widespread, mostly untreatable South American disease that affects 16 million to 18 million people.\n\nHe served on the advisory board of the now defunct Campaign to Defend the Constitution, an organization that has lobbied in support the separation of church and state. He has been publicly critical of U.S. restrictions on federal funding of embryonic stem cell research. He is also a critic of intelligent design theories, claiming that they are not only pseudoscience, but also misunderstood from a theological point of view. He suggests that the theory of evolution resolves the problem of evil, thus being a kind of theodicy. Although Ayala generally does not discuss his religious views, he has stated that \"science is compatible with religious faith in a personal, omnipotent and benevolent God.\" He also briefly served, in 1960, as a Dominican priest. Ayala does not say whether he remains a religious believer, not wanting to be \"tagged by one side or the other.\"\n\nHe attended the symposium on November 2006. Ayala debated Christian apologist William Lane Craig in November 2009 on the topic of intelligent design.\n\nOn October 18, 2011, the University of California, Irvine (UCI) announced that Professor Ayala would be donating $10 million to the university's School of Biological Sciences. The gift was to be \"$1 million a year for the next decade.\"\n\nSince 2013, Ayala has been listed on the Advisory Council of the National Center for Science Education.\n\nIn June 2018, UCI announced that it had investigated and confirmed the accusations of four women who claimed that Ayala had sexually harassed them. Ayala resigned, without becoming a professor emeritus, and the university removed his name from the School of Biological Sciences, Science Library, and endowed chairs that had been named after Ayala. The complete report of the investigation was made public (and then later removed at the request of people close to the case) on the website of the journal \"Science\", detailing multiple incidents of gender-biased and inappropriate comments and actions towards female faculty and students. The American Association for the Advancement of Science removed his fellowship status because of his actions.\n\nIn 2001, Ayala was awarded the National Medal of Science. On April 13, 2007, he was awarded the first of 100 bicentennial medals at Mount Saint Mary's University for lecturing there as the first presenter for the Bicentennial Distinguished Lecture Series. His lecture was entitled \"The Biological Foundations of Morality\". Other awards he has received include the Gold Honorary Gregor Mendel Medal of the Czech Academy of Sciences, the Gold Medal of the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, the Gold Medal of the Stazione Zoologica in Naples, the President's Award of the American Institute of Biological Sciences, the Scientific Freedom and Responsibility Award and 150th Anniversary Leadership Medal of the AAAS, the Medal of the College of France, the UCI Medal of the University of California, the 1998 Distinguished Scientist Award from the SACNAS, and Sigma Xi's William Procter Prize for Scientific Achievement, 2000. In 2010, he was awarded the Templeton Prize. The science library at UCI was named after him from 2010 to 2018, when his name was removed after substantiated allegations of sexual harassment. Ayala delivered a lecture at the Trotter Prize ceremony in 2011 entitled \"Darwin's Gift to Science and Religion.\" In 2014, UCI named its School of Biological Sciences the Francisco J. Ayala School of Biological Sciences after Ayala. UCI removed his name from the library and school in 2018, after finding that he sexually harassed at least four women.\n\nAyala was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1977. He is a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society. He is also a foreign member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei in Rome, the Spanish Royal Academy of Sciences, the Mexican Academy of Sciences, and the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts.

{"id": "2282099", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2282099", "title": "Francisco Ayala (novelist)", "text": "Francisco Ayala (novelist)\n\nFrancisco Ayala García-Duarte (16 March 1906 – 3 November 2009) was a Spanish writer, the last representative of the Generation of '27.\n\nHe was born in Granada. At the age of 16 he went to Madrid, where he studied Law and Humanities. During those years he published his first two novels, \"Tragicomedia de un hombre sin espíritu\" (\"Tragicomedy of a Spiritless Man\") and \"Historia de un amanecer\" (\"A Sunrise Tale\").\n\nHe got a Ph.D. in Laws at the Universidad de Madrid, where he would also be a teacher. A post-graduate grant allowed him to go to Berlin to study philosophy and sociology from 1929 to 1931, during the advent of Nazism. There, he met the Chilean Etelvina Silva Vargas, whom he married in 1931 and with whom he would later have a daughter, Nina.\n\nHe was a frequent contributor to the \"\" and \"Gaceta Literaria\".\n\nAt the beginning of the Republic he became a lawyer for the Parliament. He was lecturing in South America when the Spanish Civil War erupted; he worked for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs during the war.\n\nDuring the Spanish Civil War his father and his younger brother Rafael were killed by the Nationalists. When the Republican side lost the war, he exiled in Buenos Aires, where he spent ten years. There he worked for the literary magazine Sur, the newspaper La Nación and the publisher \"Losada\". He also founded, along with fellow Spaniard Lorenzo Luzuriaga, the magazine \"Realidad\".\n\nDuring the '50s he moved to Puerto Rico, where he would teach at the Law school in the University of Puerto Rico, invited by Dean Manuel Rodríguez Ramos. He later went to the United States, where he taught Spanish Literature at the Universities of Princeton, Rutgers, New York and Chicago, though he kept close intellectual and cultural bounds with Puerto Rico, where other noted Spaniards, such as Pablo Casals and Juan Ramón Jiménez, were also exiled.\n\nHe returned to Spain first in 1960. From that year onwards he would return every summer and bought a house there, rejoining literary life. In 1976, after Franco's death, he moved to Madrid for good, where he continued his work as a writer, lecturer and journalist. In 1983, at the age of 77, he was elected for the Real Academia Española. He kept on writing to a very old age. In 1988 he received the Premio Nacional de las Letras Españolas. In 1991 he received the Miguel de Cervantes Prize and, in 1998, the Prince of Asturias Award in Literature.\n\nCritics have usually divided Ayala's work in two stages: before and after the Spanish Civil War.\n\nDuring his first stage, before the Civil War, \"Tragicomedia de un hombre sin espíritu\" (\"Tragicomedy of a Spiritless Man\", 1925) and \"Historia de un amanecer\" (\"A Sunrise Tale\", 1926) follow a traditional narrative line. With \"El boxeador y el ángel\" (\"The Boxer and the Angel\", 1929) and \"Cazador en el alba\" (\"Hunter at Dawn\", 1930) he embraced avant-garde prose. Both tale collections feature a metaphorical style, stylistically brilliant, with a lack of interest in the anecdotical and a fascination for the modern world.\n\nAfter a long silence, Ayala begun his second stage in exile with \"El hechizado\" (\"The Bewitched\", 1944), a tale of a Creole man trying to meet King Charles II of Spain (known as \"the Bewitched\"), which became part of \"Los usurpadores\" (\"The Usurpers\", 1949), a collection of seven narrations with the common theme of lust for power. The story is used here as a reflection on the past, in order to better know the present. Ayala gets closer here to Kafka's existential and absurd world, including an implicit critic to the inmorality and stupidity of power.\n\n\"La cabeza del cordero\" (\"The Lamb Head\", 1949) is a collection of tales on the Civil War, where he pays more attention to the analysis of passions and human behaviour than to the relation of outside developments. \"Muertes de perro\" (\"Dog Deaths\", 1958) denounced the situation of a country under a dictatorship, while presenting human degradation in a world with no values. \"El fondo del vaso\" (\"The Bottom of the Glass\", 1962) complements his previous novel, which is commented by several characters. Irony becomes a central resource in this work, though a greater understanding for the human being replaces contempt.\n\nAfter these novels, Ayala kept publishing short tales, such as those collected in \"El As de Bastos\" (\"The Ace of Staves\", 1963), \"El rapto\" (\"The Kidnap\", 1965), and \"El jardín de las delicias\" (\"The Garden of Earthly Delights\", 1971). The latest features a contrast between the satyric objectivity in the first part, \"Diablo mundo\" (\"Devil World\"), and the evocative, subjective and lyrical tone in the second, \"Días felices\" (\"Happy Days\"). These works were followed by \"De triunfos y penas\" (\"Of Triumph and Sorrow\", 1982) and \"El jardín de las malicias\" (\"The Garden of Earthly Malice\", 1988), where he collected six tales written at different times in his life.\n\nAyala was also a prolific essay writer, covering political and social aspects, as well as reflections on Spain's past and present, cinema and literature.\n\nHe wrote his memoirs, \"Recuerdos y olvidos\" (\"Reminiscences and Overlooks\", 1982, 1983, 1988, 2006). He was a member of the \"Academia de Buenas Letras de Granada\". In November 2003 he was proclaimed Honorary Fellow of the association \"Granada Histórica\" at his birthplace. He mentioned that was \"maybe, one of the most beautiful moments in the last stage of my life because, after nearly a century of feeling a granadino across the world, now I feel recognised by the granadinos themselves\".\n\nHis short story \"El Tajo\" (\"The Tagus\") was included in \"Partes de guerra\" (\"War Reports\"), an anthology of tales about the Spanish Civil War by Spanish writer Ignacio Martínez de Pisón.\n\nHe was a member of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts since 1997.\n\nIn 2007 he became the first donor for the \"Caja de las Letras\" (\"Letter Vault\") of the Instituto Cervantes.\n\nFrancisco Ayala died in Madrid, 3 November 2009, at the age of 103. He was cremated at the San Isidro cemetery in Madrid.\n\nHe was survived by his second wife, scholar and translator Carolyn Richmond.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was born in Comilla, East Bengal, British India (now in Bangladesh) in 1945.\n\nBadal Roy was born into a Hindu family in a predominantly Muslim eastern Bengal region of the British empire in the Indian Subcontinent (which later became East Pakistan, then Bangladesh). He speaks the Bengali, English, Hindi, and Urdu languages. His father was a government official who served in the distinguished position of Joint Secretary. His nickname, Badal (meaning \"rain,\" \"cloud,\" or \"thunder\" in the Bengali language), was given to him by his grandfather after he began crying in the rain as a baby.\n\nAn early inspiration for Roy was American popular music, and he particularly enjoyed the music of artists such as Elvis Presley, Pat Boone, and Nat King Cole. His first exposure to jazz came when he saw a concert by Duke Ellington and his 60-member orchestra at the Metropole Hotel in Karachi, West Pakistan in 1959; he and his brother were the only Pakistanis in attendance (the rest of the audience was white).\n\nRoy received a master's degree in statistics. He came to New York City in 1968 to work on a PhD With only eight dollars in his pocket, he began working as a busboy and waiter in various Indian restaurants, including Taste of India and Raga. He later settled in East Brunswick Township, New Jersey.\n\nRoy began playing the tabla at age 10 or 11, under guidance from his maternal uncle in comilla. After coming to New York, he began performing with Steve Gorn at a Manhattan restaurant called Raga, eventually attracting the attention of Miles Davis. Davis invited Roy to join his group, and he recorded on Davis's albums \"On the Corner\" (1972), \"Big Fun\" (1969–72; released 1974), and \"Get Up with It\" (1970–74). Roy subsequently performed and recorded with many leading jazz musicians, including Davis, Dave Liebman, Pharoah Sanders, John McLaughlin, Herbie Hancock, Herbie Mann, Pat Metheny, Lester Bowie, Airto Moreira, Charlie Haden, Purna Das Baul, Yoko Ono, and Ornette Coleman (playing in Coleman's electric band Prime Time). In the 1990s Roy began performing with the Brazilian guitar duo Duofel. He has also collaborated with Ken Wessel and Stomu Takeishi in a fusion trio named Alankar. They currently have one album entitled \"Daybreak\".\n\nRoy has appeared and offered workshops at RhythmFest, the Starwood Festival, and at the SpiritDrum Festival, a special tribute to the late Babatunde Olatunji (co-sponsored by ACE and Musart) with Muruga Booker, Jim Donovan of Rusted Root, Halim El-Dabh, Richie \"Shakin'\" Nagan, Jeff Rosenbaum and Sikiru Adepoju, among others. He often plays with Muruga Booker in the Global Village Ceremonial Band, and with Michael Wolff & Impure Thoughts. In 2004, Roy worked with Richie Havens on the album \"The Grace of the Sun\". In the first half of 2006, Roy travelled to Japan to appear in a tribute for David Baker, his recently deceased recording engineer and friend.\n\nIn addition to tabla, Roy also plays a variety of percussion instruments including shakers, bells, rain stick, and flexatone. His notable students include Geoffrey Gordon.\n\nIn 2008, the album \"Miles From India\", a tribute to Miles Davis on which Roy appeared, received a Grammy nomination.\n\nUnlike many tabla players, Roy does not come from a family of professional musicians and is essentially self-taught, although he studied with his late maternal uncle Dwijendra Chandra Chakraborty as a child, and also studied briefly with Alla Rakha. Consequently, his playing is freer than that of many other tabla players, who adhere more strictly to the tala system of Indian rhythm. He often plays a set of up to eight tabla (tuned to different pitches) and two baya at a time, which he plays melodically as well as rhythmically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In this episode Kira deals with a stubborn farmer who refuses to leave his home which is slated for destruction; Jake and Nog cooperate in a profit-seeking venture.\n\nBajor plans to tap the core of one of its moons to provide energy—a process that will render the moon uninhabitable. An elderly farmer, Mullibok, refuses to evacuate, and Major Kira goes to the moon to investigate. Despite (or perhaps because of) Mullibok's stubbornness, Kira grows fond of him. Over dinner, he describes how he escaped to the moon during the Cardassian occupation of Bajor. Mullibok gets Kira to admit that the Bajorans beat the Cardassians because they \"hung on like fanatics,\" drawing a parallel between their struggle and his.\n\nKira reports her findings to Sisko and to Minister Toran, who is overseeing the project. Toran sends her back with two security guards to remove Mullibok. Kira attempts to reason with Mullibok while he goes about finishing a kiln he has been building. The guards arrest Mullibok's farmhands. Mullibok becomes furious and attacks one of the guards; the other shoots him. \n\nBashir arrives to treat Mullibok's wound, and the farmhands are evacuated to Bajor. Sisko, knowing Toran will be furious, \"recommends\" that Bashir report that Kira must remain on the moon for several more days for humanitarian reasons, at Bashir's recommendation.\n\nIn a parallel story, Jake Sisko and Nog acquire surplus sauce that Quark has been unable to sell. The two make a succession of trades, eventually ending up with a strip of land on Bajor. When they overhear that the government is trying to secure the land for a building project, the pair offer it to Quark for five bars of gold-pressed latinum.\n\nBack on the moon, Kira continues to bond with Mullibok. Sisko visits to remind Kira that her job is in jeopardy for supporting Mullibok. The two talk as Kira works on Mullibok's kiln, and she comes to realize that after years of fighting for the underdog she is now working for the other side. Sisko tells her a runabout is standing by to complete the evacuation.\n\nAfter a night spent caring for Mullibok, Kira awakens to find him putting the final touches on his kiln. Kira tells him he has finished his work and she must finish hers. As long as his cottage stands, Mullibok says, he will remain on the moon. Kira destroys the kiln with her phaser and sets the cottage ablaze. Mullibok declares that he will die if he leaves. \"I won't let you,\" Kira says, and calls the runabout for \"Two to beam up.\"\n\nIn 2018, SyFy recommend this episode for its abbreviated watch guide for the Bajoran character Kira Nerys. They note how this former resistance leader turned diplomat must struggle with her emotions and sense of duty. She is faced with a challenging case of forced relocation pitting the new Bajoran government's plan for development against some citizens.\n\nIn 2019, ScreenRant ranked this one of the top ten episodes for the character Nog, noting his friendship with Jake.\n\nThe episode's plot and character motivations strongly resemble those of the Elia Kazan film, \"Wild River\", in that an aging but strong-willed individualist has made an isolated place his/her own, and is now being forced to abandon that home for a project that will provide cheap energy to a large number of people (a hydroelectric dam in the movie). In both stories, the functionary assigned to get people out of the area soon to be made uninhabitable forms a bond of understanding with the holdout, and each is forced to deal with the other's perspective, without abandoning his/her own. The film ends with the death of the holdout, who loses the will to live away from her island redoubt; the TV episode holds out hope that this can be avoided a while.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2282113", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2282113", "title": "Naringenin", "text": "Naringenin\n\nNaringenin is a flavorless, colorless flavanone, a type of flavonoid. It is the predominant flavanone in grapefruit, and is found in a variety of fruits and herbs.\n\nNaringenin has the skeleton structure of a flavanone with three hydroxy groups at the 4', 5, and 7 carbons. It may be found both in the aglycol form, naringenin, or in its glycosidic form, naringin, which has the addition of the disaccharide neohesperidose attached via a glycosidic linkage at carbon 7.\n\nLike the majority of flavanones, naringenin has a single chiral center at carbon 2, resulting in enantiomeric forms of the compound. The enantiomers are found in varying ratios in natural sources. Racemization of S(-)-naringenin has been shown to occur fairly quickly. Naringenin has been shown to be resistant to enatiomerization over pH 9-11.\n\nSeparation and analysis of the enantiomers has been explored for over 20 years, primarily via high-performance liquid chromatography on polysaccharide-derived chiral stationary phases. There is evidence to suggest stereospecific pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics profiles, which has been proposed to be an explanation for the wide variety in naringenin's reported bioactivity.\n\nNaringenin and its glycoside has been found in a variety of herbs and fruits, including grapefruit, bergamot, sour orange, tart cherries, tomatoes, cocoa, Greek oregano, water mint, drynaria as well as in beans. Ratios of naringenin to naringin vary among sources, as do enantiomeric ratios.\n\nThis bioflavonoid is difficult to absorb on oral ingestion. In the best-case scenario, only 15% of ingested naringenin will get absorbed in the human gastrointestinal tract.\n\nThe naringenin-7-glucoside form seems less bioavailable than the aglycol form.\n\nGrapefruit juice can provide much higher plasma concentrations of naringenin than orange juice. Also found in grapefruit is the related compound kaempferol, which has a hydroxyl group next to the ketone group.\n\nNaringenin can be absorbed from cooked tomato paste. There is 253 mg of naringenin in 10 grams of tomato paste.\n\nThe enzyme naringenin 8-dimethylallyltransferase uses dimethylallyl diphosphate and (−)-(2\"S\")-naringenin to produce diphosphate and 8-prenylnaringenin.\n\n\"Cunninghamella elegans\", a fungal model organism of the mammalian metabolism, can be used to study the naringenin sulfation.\n\nNaringenin has been shown to have an inhibitory effect on the human cytochrome P450 isoform CYP1A2, which can change pharmacokinetics in a human (or orthologous) host of several popular drugs in an adverse manner, even resulting in carcinogens of otherwise harmless substances. The National Research Institute of Chinese Medicine in Taiwan conducted experiments on the effects of the grapefruit flavanones naringin and naringenin on CYP450 enzyme expression. Naringenin proved to be a potent inhibitor of the benzo(a)pyrene metabolizing enzyme benzo(a)pyrene hydroxylase (AHH) in experiments in mice.\n\nNaringenin is being researched as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease. Naringenin has been demonstrated to improve memory and reduce amyloid and tau proteins in a study using a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. The effect is believed to be due to a protein present in neurons known as CRMP2 that naringenin binds to.\n\nNaringenin's potential antibacterial and antifungal behaviour has been investigated. In 1987, it was reported that naringenin had no antibacterial activity against \"Staphylococcus epidermidis.\" This finding was not replicated in a 2000 study in which naringenin was shown to indeed have an antimicrobial effect on \"S. epidermidis\", as well as \"Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus,\" and \"Escherichia coli\". Further research has added evidence for antimicrobial effects against \"Lactococcus lactis\", \"lactobacillus acidophilus\", \"Actinomyces naeslundii\", \"Prevotella oralis\", \"Prevotella melaninogencia\", \"Porphyromonas gingivalis\", as well as yeasts such as \"Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis,\" and \"Candida krusei\". There is also evidence of antibacterial effects on \"H. pylori\", though naringenin has not been shown to have any inhibition on urease activity of the microbe.\n\nNaringenin has also been shown to reduce hepatitis C virus production by infected hepatocytes (liver cells) in cell culture. This seems to be secondary to naringenin's ability to inhibit the secretion of very-low-density lipoprotein by the cells. The antiviral effects of naringenin are currently under clinical investigation. Reports of antiviral effects on polioviruses, HSV-1 and HSV-2 have also been made, though replication of the viruses has not been inhibited.\n\nDespite evidence of anti-inflammatory activity of naringin, the anti-inflammatory activity of naringenin has been observed to be poor to nonexistent.\n\nNaringenin has been shown to have significant antioxidant properties. It has been shown to reduce oxidative damage to DNA \"in vitro\" and in animal studies.\n\nCytotoxicity has been induced reportedly by naringenin in cancer cells from breast, stomach, liver, cervix, pancreas, and colon tissues, along with leukaemia cells. The mechanisms behind inhibition of human breast carcinoma growth have been examined, and two theories have been proposed. The first theory is that naringenin inhibits aromatase, thus reducing growth of the tumor. The second mechanism proposes that interactions with estrogen receptors is the cause behind the modulation of growth. New derivatives of naringenin were found to be active against multidrug-resistant cancer.\n\nNaringenin has been reported to induce apoptosis in preadipocytes.\n\nNaringenin seems to protect LDLR-deficient mice from the obesity effects of a high-fat diet.\n\nNaringenin lowers the plasma and hepatic cholesterol concentrations by suppressing HMG-CoA reductase and ACAT in rats fed a high-cholesterol diet.\n\nNaringenin also produces BDNF-dependent antidepressant-like effects in mice.\n\nIn 2006 it was shown to increase the mRNA expression levels of two DNA repair enzymes, DNA pol beta and OGG1, specifically in prostate cancer cells.\n\nLike many other flavonoids, naringenin has been found to possess weak activity at the opioid receptors. It specifically acts as a non-selective antagonist of all three opioid receptors, albeit with weak affinity.\n"}

NEBS is the most common set of safety, spatial and environmental design guidelines applied to telecommunications equipment in the United States. It is an industry requirement, but not a legal requirement.\n\nNEBS was developed by Bell Labs in the 1970s to standardize equipment that would be installed in a central office. The objective was to make it easier for a vendor to design equipment compatible with a typical Regional Bell Operating Company (RBOC) central office (CO). This would result in lower development costs and ease the equipment's introduction into the network. Telcordia now manages the NEBS specifications. The four then-largest US Telecommunications companies (AT&T, Verizon, BellSouth, and CenturyLink) created the Telecommunications Carrier Group (TCG), a group formed to synchronize NEBS standards across the industry in the US. The TCG checklist specifies the individual NEBS requirements of each of its members in a matrix, making it simple to compare them.\n\n\"NEBS Level 1\" means a very low threshold of equipment hazards and network degradation. NEBS Level 1 addresses the personnel and equipment safety requirements of GR-63-CORE and GR-1089-CORE. Operability requirements are not enforced for NEBS Level 1 certification. It is primarily used for getting prototypes into lab trials. RBOCs require all equipment deployed by CLECs to be NEBS Level 1 certified.\n\n\"NEBS Level 2\" addresses equipment operability in a controlled environment (usually datacenters) that will not be subjected to environmental stress. Because of ambiguity, this level of certification is rarely (if ever) used.\n\n\"NEBS Level 3\" is a term from Bellcore special report, SR-3580, and means the equipment meets all of the requirements of GR-63-CORE and GR-1089-CORE. NEBS Level 3 has strict specifications for fire suppression, thermal margin testing, vibration resistance (earthquakes), airflow patterns, acoustic limits, failover and partial operational requirements (such as chassis fan failures), failure severity levels, RF emissions and tolerances, and testing/certification requirements.\n\n\"NOTE:\" \n\n\nNEBS contains the key industry requirements for how to design and build reliable electronics for telecom network use. It is unique in its focus on telecommunications applications and environments for electronic systems. The proper design, engineering, manufacturing, and workmanship of equipment are critical for long-term use in all environments.\n\nFor \"physical protection\", good engineering practices cover metal surface treatment and contact compatibility, flammability ratings, component marking and traceability, electrical and mechanical integrity, and a variety of process manufacturing issues.\n\nThe RBOCs often require that detail design selection and implementation take into account the various elements of NEBS GR-78, \"Generic Requirements for the Physical Design and Manufacture of Telecommunications Products and Equipment\"\n\nGR-78 has requirements that cover details of design implementation that need to be discussed, reviewed, and implemented, as appropriate, in equipment intended to be NEBS compliant. Topics include, but are not limited to, materials and finishes; electrostatic discharge requirements; printed wiring boards and assemblies; connectors, wire, and cable; product marking and identification; and qualification test procedures. GR-78 also clarifies the industry position on the use of Lead (Pb)-free solder and allows for alternative finishes such as immersion silver, etc.\n"}

{"id": "2282128", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2282128", "title": "Genealogical DNA test", "text": "Genealogical DNA test\n\nA genealogical DNA test is a DNA-based test which looks at specific locations of a person's genome, in order to find or verify ancestral genealogical relationships or (with lower reliability) to estimate the ethnic mixture of an individual. Since different testing companies use different ethnic reference groups and different matching algorithms, ethnicity estimates for an individual will vary between tests, sometimes dramatically.\n\nThree principal types of genealogical DNA tests are available, with each looking at a different part of the genome and useful for different types of genealogical research: autosomal, mitochondrial (mtDNA), and Y-DNA.\nAutosomal tests may result in a large amount of DNA matches (other test persons that the individual may be related to), along mixed male and female lines, each match with an estimated distance in the family tree. However, due to the random nature of which and how much DNA is inherited by each tested person from their common ancestors, precise conclusions can only be made for close relations. Traditional genealogical research, and the sharing of family trees, is typically required for interpretation of the results. Autosomal tests are also used in estimating ethnic mix.\n\nMtDNA and Y-DNA tests are much more objective. However, they give considerably fewer DNA matches, if any, since they are limited to relationships along a strict female line and a strict male line respectively. MtDNA and Y-DNA tests are utilized to identify archeological cultures and migration paths of a person's ancestors along a strict mother's line or a strict father's line. Based on MtDNA and Y-DNA, a person's haplogroup(s) can be identified. Only men can take Y-DNA tests, since women lack a Y chromosome.\n\nThe first company to provide direct-to-consumer genetic DNA testing was the now defunct GeneTree. However, it did not offer multi-generational genealogy tests. In fall 2001, GeneTree sold its assets to Salt Lake City-based Sorenson Molecular Genealogy Foundation (SMGF) which originated in 1999.\nWhile in operation, SMGF provided free Y-Chromosome and mitochondrial DNA tests to thousands.\nLater, GeneTree returned to genetic testing for genealogy in conjunction with the Sorenson parent company and eventually was part of the assets acquired in the Ancestry.com buyout of SMGF in 2012.\n\nIn 2000, Family Tree DNA, founded by Bennett Greenspan and Max Blankfeld, was the first company dedicated to direct-to-consumer testing for genealogy research. They initially offered eleven marker Y-Chromosome STR tests and HVR1 mitochondrial DNA tests. They originally tested in partnership with the University of Arizona.\n\nIn 2007, 23andMe was the first company to offer a saliva-based direct-to-consumer genetic testing. It was also the first to implement using autosomal DNA for ancestry testing, which all other major companies now use.\n\nMyHeritage launched its genetic testing service in 2016, allowing users to use cheek swabs to collect samples. In 2019, new analysis tools were presented: autoclusters (grouping all matches visually into clusters) and family tree theories (suggesting conceivable relations between DNA matches by combining several Myheritage trees as well as the Geni global family tree).\n\nLiving DNA, founded in 2015, also provides a genetic testing service. Living DNA uses SNP chips to provide reports on autosomal ancestry, Y, and mtDNA ancestry. Living DNA provides detailed reports on ancestry from the UK as well as detailed Y chromosome and mtDNA reports.\n\nIn 2019 it was estimated that large genealogical testing companies had about 26 million DNA profiles. Many transferred their test result for free to multiple testing sites, and also to genealogical services such as Geni.com and GEDmatch. GEDMatch said half of their profiles were from the USA.\n\nThe popular consciousness of DNA testing and of DNA generally is subject to a number of misconceptions involving the reliability of testing, the nature of the connections with one's ancestors, the connection between DNA and personal traits, etc.\n\nA genealogical DNA test is performed on a DNA sample. This DNA sample can be obtained by a cheek-scraping (also known as a buccal swab), spit-cups, mouthwash, and chewing gum. Typically, the sample collection uses a home test kit supplied by a service provider such as 23andMe, AncestryDNA, Family Tree DNA, or MyHeritage. After following the kit instructions on how to collect the sample, it is returned to the supplier for analysis. The sample is then processed using a technology known as DNA microarray to obtain the genetic information.\n\nThere are three major types of genealogical DNA tests: Autosomal and X-DNA, Y-DNA and mtDNA.\n\nY-DNA and mtDNA cannot be used for ethnicity estimates, but can be used to find one's haplogroup, which is unevenly distributed geographically. Direct-to-consumer DNA test companies have often labeled haplogroups by continent or ethnicity (e.g., an \"African haplogroup\" or a \"Viking haplogroup\"), but these labels may be speculative or misleading.\n\nAutosomal DNA is contained in the 22 pairs of chromosomes not involved in determining a person's sex. Autosomal DNA recombines each generation, and new offspring receive one set of chromosomes from each parent. These are inherited exactly equally from both parents and roughly equally from grandparents to about 3x great-grand parents. Therefore, the number of markers (one of two or more known variants in the genome at a particular location – known as Single-nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs) inherited from a specific ancestor decreases by about half each generation; that is, an individual receives half of their markers from each parent, about a quarter of their markers from each grandparent; about an eighth of their markers from each great grandparent, etc. Inheritance is more random and unequal from more distant ancestors. Generally, a genealogical DNA test might test about 700,000 SNPs (specific points in the genome).\n\nThe preparation of a report on the DNA in the sample proceeds in multiple stages:\n\nAll major service providers use equipment with chips supplied by Illumina. The chip determines which SNP locations are tested. Different versions of the chip are used by different service providers. In addition, updated versions of the Illumina chip may test different sets of SNP locations. The list of SNP locations and base pairs at that location is usually available to the customer as \"raw data\". The raw data can sometimes be uploaded to another service provider to produce an additional interpretation and matches. For additional analysis the data can also be uploaded to GEDmatch (a third-party web based set of tools that analyzes raw data from the main service providers).\n\nThe major component of an autosomal DNA test is matching other individuals. Where the individual being tested has a number of consecutive SNPs in common with a previously tested individual in the company's database, it can be inferred that they share a segment of DNA at that part of their genomes. If the segment is longer than a threshold amount set by the testing company, then these two individuals are considered to be a match. Unlike the identification of base pairs, the data bases against which the new sample is tested, and the algorithms used to determine a match, are proprietary and specific to each company.\n\nThe unit for segments of DNA is the centimorgan (cM). For comparison, a full human genome is about 6500 cM. The shorter the length of a match, the greater are the chances that a match is spurious. An important statistic for subsequent interpretation is the length of the shared DNA (or the percentage of the genome that is shared).\n\nMost companies will show the customers how many cMs they share, and across how many segments. From the number of cMs and segments, the relationship between the two individuals can be estimated, however due to the random nature of DNA inheritance, relationship estimates, especially for distant relatives, are only approximate. Some more distant cousins will not match at all. Although information about specific SNPs can be used for some purposes (e.g. suggesting likely eye colour), the key information is the percentage of DNA shared by 2 individuals. This can indicate the closeness of the relationship. However, it does not show the roles of the 2 individuals - e.g. 50% shared suggests a parent - child relationship, but does not identify which individual is the parent.\n\nVarious advanced techniques and analysis can be done on this data. This includes features such as In-common/Shared Matches, Chromosome Browsers and Triangulation. This analysis is often required if DNA evidence is being used to prove or disprove a specific relationship.\n\nThe X-chromosome SNP results are often included in Autosomal DNA tests. Both males and females receive an X-chromosome from their mother, but only females receive a second X-chromosome from their father. The X-chromosome has a special path of inheritance patterns and can be useful in significantly narrowing down possible ancestor lines compared to Autosomal DNA – for example an X-chromosome match with a male can only have come from his maternal side. Like autosomal DNA, X-chromosome DNA undergoes random recombination at each generation (except for father to daughter X-chromosomes which are passed down unchanged). There are specialised inheritance charts which describe the possible patterns of X-chromosome DNA inheritance for males and females.\n\nSome genealogical companies offered autosomal STRs (short tandem repeats). These are similar to Y-DNA STRs. The number of STRs offered is limited, and results have been used for personal identification, paternity cases and inter-population studies.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies in the US and Europe use autosomal STR data to identify criminals.\n\nThe mitochondrion is a component of a human cell, and contains its own DNA. Mitochondrial DNA usually has 16,569 base pairs (the number can vary slightly depending on addition or deletion mutations) and is much smaller than the human genome DNA which has 3.2 billion base pairs. Mitochondrial DNA is transmitted from mother to child, thus a direct maternal ancestor can be traced using mtDNA. The transmission occurs with relatively rare mutations compared to the genome DNA. A perfect match found to another person's mtDNA test results indicates shared ancestry of possibly between 1 and 50 generations ago. More distant matching to a specific haplogroup or subclade may be linked to a common geographic origin.\n\nmtDNA, by current conventions, is divided into three regions. They are the coding region (00577-16023) and two Hyper Variable Regions (HVR1 [16024-16569], and HVR2 [00001-00576]).\n\nThe two most common mtDNA tests are a sequence of HVR1 and HVR2 and a full sequence of the mitochondria. Generally, testing only the HVRs has limited genealogical use so it is increasingly popular and accessible to have a full sequence. The full mtDNA sequence is only offered by Family Tree DNA among the major testing companies and is somewhat controversial because the coding region DNA may reveal medical information about the test-taker\n\nAll humans descend in the direct female line from Mitochondrial Eve, a female who lived probably around 150,000 years ago in Africa. Different branches of her descendants are different haplogroups. Most mtDNA results include a prediction or exact assertion of one's mtDNA Haplogroup. Mitochrondial haplogroups were greatly popularized by the book \"The Seven Daughters of Eve\", which explores mitochondrial DNA.\n\nIt is not normal for test results to give a base-by-base list of results. Instead, results are normally compared to the Cambridge Reference Sequence (CRS), which is the mitochondria of a European who was the first person to have their mtDNA published in 1981 (and revised in 1999). Differences between the CRS and testers are usually very few, thus it is more convenient than listing one's raw results for each base pair.\n\nNote that in HVR1, instead of reporting the base pair exactly, for example 16,111, the 16 is often removed to give in this example 111. The letters refer to one of the four bases (A, T, G, C) that make up DNA.\nThe Y-Chromosome is one of the 23rd pair of human chromosomes. Only males have a Y-chromosome, because women have two X chromosomes in their 23rd pair. A man's patrilineal ancestry, or male-line ancestry, can be traced using the DNA on his Y chromosome (Y-DNA), because the Y-chromosome is transmitted father to son nearly unchanged. A man's test results are compared to another man's results to determine the time frame in which the two individuals shared a most recent common ancestor, or MRCA, in their direct patrilineal lines. If their test results are very close, they are related within a genealogically useful time frame. A surname project is where many individuals whose Y-chromosomes match collaborate to find their common ancestry.\n\nWomen who wish to determine their direct paternal DNA ancestry can ask their father, brother, paternal uncle, paternal grandfather, or a paternal uncle's son (their cousin) to take a test for them.\n\nThere are two types of DNA testing: STRs and SNPs.\n\nMost common is STRs (short tandem repeat). A certain section of DNA is examined for a pattern that repeats (e.g. ATCG). The number of times it repeats is the value of the marker. Typical tests test between 12 and 111 STR markers. STRs mutate fairly frequently. The results of two individuals are then compared to see if there is a match. DNA companies will usually provide an estimate of how closely related two people are, in terms of generations or years, based on the difference between their results.\n\nA person's haplogroup can often be inferred from their STR results, but can be proven only with a Y-chromosome SNP test (Y-SNP test).\n\nA single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is a change to a single nucleotide in a DNA sequence. Typical Y-DNA SNP tests test about 20,000 to 35,000 SNPs. Getting a SNP test allows a much higher resolution than STRs. It can be used to provide additional information about the relationship between two individuals and to confirm haplogroups.\nAll human men descend in the paternal line from a single man dubbed Y-chromosomal Adam, who lived probably between 200,000 and 300,000 years ago. A 'family tree' can be drawn showing how men today descend from him. Different branches of this tree are different haplogroups. Most haplogroups can be further subdivided multiple times into sub-clades. Some known sub-clades were founded in the last 1000 years, meaning their timeframe approaches the genealogical era (c.1500 onwards).\n\nNew sub-clades of haplogroups may be discovered when an individual tests, especially if they are non-European. Most significant of these new discoveries was in 2013 when the haplogroup A00 was discovered, which required theories about Y-chromosomal Adam to be significantly revised. The haplogroup was discovered when an African-American man tested STRs at FamilyTreeDNA and his results were found to be unusual. SNP testing confirmed that he does not descend patrilineally from the \"old\" Y-chromosomal Adam and so a much older man became Y-Chromosomal Adam.\n\nMany companies offer a percentage breakdown by ethnicity or region. Generally the world is specified into about 20–25 regions, and the approximate percentage of DNA inherited from each is stated. This is usually done by comparing the frequency of each Autosomal DNA marker tested to many population groups. The reliability of this type of test is dependent on comparative population size, the number of markers tested, the ancestry informative value of the SNPs tested, and the degree of admixture in the person tested. Earlier ethnicity estimates were often wildly inaccurate, but as companies receive more samples over time, ethnicity estimates have become more accurate. Testing companies such as Ancestry.com will often regularly update their ethnicity estimates, which has caused some controversy from customers as their results update. Usually the results at the continental level are accurate, but more specific assertions of the test may turn out to be incorrect.\n\nThe interest in genealogical DNA tests has been linked to both an increase in curiosity about traditional genealogy and to more general personal origins. Those who test for traditional genealogy often utilize a combination of autosomal, mitochondrial, and Y-Chromosome tests. Those with an interest in personal ethnic origins are more likely to use an autosomal test. However, answering specific questions about the ethnic origins of a particular lineage may be best suited to an mtDNA test or a Y-DNA test.\n\nFor recent genealogy, exact matching on the mtDNA full sequence is used to confirm a common ancestor on the direct maternal line between two suspected relatives. Because mtDNA mutations are very rare, a \"nearly\" perfect match is not usually considered relevant to the most recent 1 to 16 generations. In cultures lacking matrilineal surnames to pass down, neither relative above is likely to have as many generations of ancestors in their matrilineal information table as in the above patrilineal or Y-DNA case: for further information on this difficulty in \"traditional genealogy\", due to lack of \"matrilineal\" surnames (or matrinames), see Matriname. However, the foundation of testing is still two suspected descendants of one person. This hypothesize and test DNA pattern is the same one used for autosomal DNA and Y-DNA.\n\nAs discussed above, autosomal tests usually report the ethnic proportions of the individual. These attempt to measure an individual's mixed geographic heritage by identifying particular markers, called ancestry informative markers or AIM, that are associated with populations of specific geographical areas. Geneticist Adam Rutherford has written that these tests \"don’t necessarily show your geographical origins in the past. They show with whom you have common ancestry today.\"\n\nThe haplogroups determined by Y-DNA and mtDNA tests are often unevenly geographically distributed. Many direct-to-consumer DNA tests described this association to infer the test-taker's ancestral homeland. Most tests describe haplogroups according to their most frequently associated continent (e.g., a \"European haplogroup\"). When Leslie Emery and collaborators performed a trial of mtDNA haplogroups as a predictor of continental origin on individuals in the Human Genetic Diversity Panel (HGDP) and 1000 Genomes (1KGP) datasets, they found that only 14 of 23 haplogroups had a success rate above 50% among the HGDP samples, as did \"about half\" of the haplogroups in the 1KGP. The authors concluded that, for most people, \"mtDNA-haplogroup membership provides limited information about either continental ancestry or continental region of origin.\"\n\nY-DNA and mtDNA testing may be able to determine with which peoples in present-day Africa a person shares a direct line of part of his or her ancestry, but patterns of historic migration and historical events cloud the tracing of ancestral groups. Due to joint long histories in the US, approximately 30% of African American males have a European Y-Chromosome haplogroup Approximately 58% of African Americans have at least the equivalent of one great-grandparent (13%) of European ancestry. Only about 5% have the equivalent of one great-grandparent of Native American ancestry. By the early 19th century, substantial families of Free Persons of Color had been established in the Chesapeake Bay area who were descended from free people during the colonial period; most of those have been documented as descended from white men and African women (servant, slave or free). Over time various groups married more within mixed-race, black or white communities.\n\nAccording to authorities like Salas, nearly three-quarters of the ancestors of African Americans taken in slavery came from regions of West Africa. The African-American movement to discover and identify with ancestral tribes has burgeoned since DNA testing became available. African Americans usually cannot easily trace their ancestry during the years of slavery through surname research, census and property records, and other traditional means. Genealogical DNA testing may provide a tie to regional African heritage.\n\nMelungeons are one of numerous multiracial groups in the United States with origins wrapped in myth. The historical research of Paul Heinegg has documented that many of the Melungeon groups in the Upper South were descended from mixed-race people who were free in colonial Virginia and the result of unions between the Europeans and Africans. They moved to the frontiers of Virginia, North Carolina, Kentucky and Tennessee to gain some freedom from the racial barriers of the plantation areas. Several efforts, including a number of ongoing studies, have examined the genetic makeup of families historically identified as Melungeon. Most results point primarily to a mixture of European and African, which is supported by historical documentation. Some may have Native American heritage as well. Though some companies provide additional Melungeon research materials with Y-DNA and mtDNA tests, any test will allow comparisons with the results of current and past Melungeon DNA studies\n\nThe pre-columbian indigenous people of the United States are called \"Native Americans\" in American English. Autosomal testing, Y-DNA, and mtDNA testing can be conducted to determine the ancestry of Native Americans. A mitochondrial Haplogroup determination test based on mutations in Hypervariable Region 1 and 2 may establish whether a person's direct female line belongs to one of the canonical Native American Haplogroups, A, B, C, D or X. The vast majority of Native American individuals belong to one of the five identified mtDNA Haplogroups. Thus, being in one of those groups provides evidence of potential Native American descent. However, DNA ethnicity results cannot be used as a substitute for legal documentation. Native American tribes have their own requirements for membership, often based on at least one of a person's ancestors having been included on tribal-specific Native American censuses (or final rolls) prepared during treaty-making, relocation to reservations or apportionment of land in the late 19th century and early 20th century. One example is the Dawes Rolls.\n\nThe Cohanim (or Kohanim) is a patrilineal priestly line of descent in Judaism. According to the Bible, the ancestor of the Cohanim is Aaron, brother of Moses. Many believe that descent from Aaron is verifiable with a Y-DNA test: the first published study in genealogical Y-Chromosome DNA testing found that a significant percentage of Cohens had distinctively similar DNA, rather more so than general Jewish or Middle Eastern populations. These Cohens tended to belong to Haplogroup J, with Y-STR values clustered unusually closely around a haplotype known as the Cohen Modal Haplotype (CMH). This could be consistent with a shared common ancestor, or with the hereditary priesthood having originally been founded from members of a single closely related clan.\n\nNevertheless, the original studies tested only six Y-STR markers, which is considered a low-resolution test. In response to the low resolution of the original 6-marker CMH, the testing company FTDNA released a 12-marker CMH signature that was more specific to the large closely related group of Cohens in Haplogroup J1.\n\nA further academic study published in 2009 examined more STR markers and identified a more sharply defined SNP haplogroup, J1e* (now J1c3, also called J-P58*) for the J1 lineage. The research found \"that 46.1% of Kohanim carry Y chromosomes belonging to a single paternal lineage (J-P58*) that likely originated in the Near East well before the dispersal of Jewish groups in the Diaspora. Support for a Near Eastern origin of this lineage comes from its high frequency in our sample of Bedouins, Yemenis (67%), and Jordanians (55%) and its precipitous drop in frequency as one moves away from Saudi Arabia and the Near East (Fig. 4). Moreover, there is a striking contrast between the relatively high frequency of J-58* in Jewish populations (»20%) and Kohanim (»46%) and its vanishingly low frequency in our sample of non-Jewish populations that hosted Jewish diaspora communities outside of the Near East.\"\n\nRecent phylogenetic research for haplogroup J-M267 placed the \"Y-chromosomal Aaron\" in a subhaplogroup of J-L862, L147.1 (age estimate 5631-6778yBP yBP): YSC235>PF4847/CTS11741>YSC234>ZS241>ZS227>Z18271 (age estimate 2731yBP).\n\nGenealogical DNA tests have become popular due to the ease of testing at home and their usefulness in supplementing genealogical research. Genealogical DNA tests allow for an individual to determine with high accuracy whether he or she is related to another person within a certain time frame, or with certainty that he or she is not related. DNA tests are perceived as more scientific, conclusive and expeditious than searching the civil records. However, they are limited by restrictions on lines that may be studied. The civil records are always only as accurate as the individuals having provided or written the information.\n\nY-DNA testing results are normally stated as probabilities: For example, with the same surname a perfect 37/37 marker test match gives a 95% likelihood of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) being within 8 generations, while a 111 of 111 marker match gives the same 95% likelihood of the MRCA being within only 5 generations back.\n\nAs presented above in mtDNA testing, if a perfect match is found, the mtDNA test results can be helpful. In some cases, research according to traditional genealogy methods encounters difficulties due to the lack of regularly recorded matrilineal surname information in many cultures (see Matrilineal surname).\n\nAutosomal DNA combined with genealogical research has been used by adoptees to find their biological parents, has been used to find the name and family of unidentified bodies and by law enforcement agencies to apprehend criminals (for example, the Contra Costa County District Attorney's office used the \"open-source\" genetic genealogy site GEDmatch to find relatives of the suspect in the Golden State Killer case.). The Atlantic magazine commented in 2018 that \"Now, the floodgates are open. ..a small, volunteer-run website, GEDmatch.com, has become ... the de facto DNA and genealogy database for all of law enforcement.\" Family Tree DNA announced in February 2019 it was allowing the FBI to access its DNA data for cases of murder and rape. However, in May 2019 GEDmatch initiated stricter rules for accessing their autosomal DNA database and Family Tree DNA shut down their Y-DNA database ysearch.org, making it more difficult for law enforcement agencies to solve cases.\n\nCommon concerns about genealogical DNA testing are cost and privacy issues. Some testing companies retain samples and results for their own use without a privacy agreement with subjects.\n\nAutosomal DNA tests can identify relationships but they can be misinterpreted. For example, transplants of stem cell or bone marrow will produce matches with the donor. In addition, identical twins (who have identical DNA) can give unexpected results.\n\nTesting of the Y-DNA lineage from father to son may reveal complications, due to unusual mutations, secret adoptions, and non-paternity events (i.e., that the perceived father in a generation is not the father indicated by written birth records). According to the Ancestry and Ancestry Testing Task Force of the American Society of Human Genetics, autosomal tests cannot detect \"large portions\" of DNA from distant ancestors because it has not been inherited.\n\nWith the increasing popularity of the use of DNA tests for ethnicity tests, uncertainties and errors in ethnicity estimates are a drawback for Genetic genealogy. While ethnicity estimates at the continental level should be accurate (with the possible exception of East Asia and the Americas), sub-continental estimates, especially in Europe, are often inaccurate. Customers may be misinformed about the uncertainties and errors of the estimates.\n\nSome have recommended government or other regulation of ancestry testing to ensure its performance to an agreed standard.\n\nA number of law enforcement agencies took legal action to compel\ngenetic genealogy companies to release genetic information that could match cold case crime victims or perpetrators. A number of companies fought the requests.\n\nThough genealogical DNA tests are not designed mainly for medical purposes, autosomal DNA tests can be used to analyze the probability of hundreds of heritable medical conditions, albeit the result is complex to understand and may confuse a non-expert. 23andMe provides medical and trait information from their genealogical DNA test and for a fee the Promethease web site analyses genealogical DNA test data from Family Tree DNA, 23andMe, or AncestryDNA for medical information. Promethease, and its research paper crawling database SNPedia, has received criticism for technical complexity and a poorly defined \"magnitude\" scale that causes misconceptions, confusion and panic among its users.\n\nThe testing of full MtDNA and YDNA sequences is still somewhat controversial as it may reveal even more medical information. For example, a correlation exists between a lack of Y-DNA marker DYS464 and infertility, and between mtDNA haplogroup H and protection from sepsis. Certain haplogroups have been linked to longevity in some population groups. The field of linkage disequilibrium, unequal association of genetic disorders with a certain mitochondrial lineage, is in its infancy, but those mitochondrial mutations that have been linked are searchable in the genome database Mitomap. Family Tree DNA's MtFull Sequence test analyses the full MtDNA genome and the National Human Genome Research Institute operates the Genetic And Rare Disease Information Center that can assist consumers in identifying an appropriate screening test and help locate a nearby medical center that offers such a test.\n\nSome genealogy software programs — such as Family Tree Maker, Legacy Family Tree (Deluxe Edition) and the Swedish program Genney — allow recording DNA marker test results. This allows for tracking of both Y-chromosome and mtDNA tests, and recording results for relatives.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2282135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2282135", "title": "Ringbone", "text": "Ringbone\n\nRingbone is exostosis (bone growth) in the pastern or coffin joint of a horse. In severe cases, the growth can encircle the bones, giving ringbone its name. It has been suggested by some authors that such a colloquial term, whilst commonly used, might be misleading and that it would be better to refer to this condition as osteoarthritis of the inter-phalangeal joints in ungulates (Rogers and Waldron, 1995: 34-35).\n\nRingbone can be classified by its location, with \"high ringbone\" occurring on the lower part of the large pastern bone or the upper part of the small pastern bone. \"Low ringbone\" occurs on the lower part of the small pastern bone or the upper part of the coffin bone. High ringbone is easier seen than low ringbone, as low ringbone occurs in the hoof of the horse. However, low ringbone may be seen if it becomes serious, as it creates a bony bump on the coronet of the horse.\n\n\nRingbone usually occurs in the front legs but can also be in the hind legs, and is usually worse in one leg than the other. Ringbone is most often found in mature horses, especially those in intensive training.\n\nHigh ringbone: The horse will have a bony growth around the pastern area, and the pastern will have less mobility. The horse will show pain when the pastern joint is moved or rotated. Early cases will have a lameness score of 1-2 out of 5, with little or no bony swelling seen, although possibly felt when compared to the opposite pastern. Lameness will worsen to a grade 2-3 on a scale of 5 as the ringbone worsens.\n\nLow ringbone: The horse will have moderate lameness (grade 2-3), even in early cases, because of the closeness of the ringbone to the other structures in the hoof. When severe or very advanced, the bony growth will be able to be seen on the coronet.\n\nRingbone is degenerative (unless it is caused by direct trauma). Treatment works to slow down the progress of the bony changes and alleviate the horse's pain, rather than working to cure it.\n\nShoeing: The farrier should balance the hoof and apply a shoe that supports the heels and allows for an easy breakover.\n\nNSAIDs: or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs help to alleviate the pain and reduce inflammation within and around the joints. Often NSAIDs make the horse comfortable enough to continue ridden work, which is good for the horse's overall health.\n\nJoint injections: The pastern joint can be injected directly, typically with a form of corticosteroid and hyaluronic acid.\n\nExtracorporeal shockwave therapy: A high intensity specialized percussion device can help to remodel new bone tissue and decrease pain.\n\nArthrodesis: the fusion of the two bones of the pastern joints eliminates the instability of the joint, and thus the inflammation. This procedure may then eliminate the horse's lameness as well. However, surgical alteration of the joint can promote the growth of bone in the area, which is cosmetically displeasing. Arthrodesis of the coffin joint is usually not performed due to the location of the joint (within the hoof) and because the coffin joint needs some mobility for the horse to move correctly (unlike the pastern joint, which is very still).\n\nInterleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein (IRAP) blocks IL-1 from binding to tissues and inhibits the damaging consequences of IL-1.\n\nMicrocurrent technology: Tissue, including muscle, tendons, ligaments, skin and bone, is formed from a large mass of similar cells that perform specific functions. These cells use tiny sequences of electric current, measured in millionths of an amp, to organise, monitor and regulate a stable state within the body. \nWhen there is injury, damage or disease to a tissue, there is disruption to the normal electrical current within the cells and things fail to work properly. By introducing the correct sequences the body's natural electric circuitry is replicated and kick starts and accelerates normal functioning.\n\nIf the ringbone is close to a joint, the prognosis for the horse's continued athletic use is not as good as if the ringbone is not near a joint. Ringbone that is progressing rapidly has a poorer prognosis as well.\n\nHorses that are not performing strenuous work, such as jumping or working at speed, will probably be usable for years to come. However, horses competing in intense sports may not be able to continue at their previous level, as their pastern joints are constantly stressed.\n\nKing, Christine, BVSc, MACVSc, and Mansmann, Richard, VDM, PhD. 1997. \"Equine Lameness.\" Equine Research, Inc.

{"id": "2282159", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2282159", "title": "Ushak carpet", "text": "Ushak carpet\n\nUşak carpets, Ushak carpets or Oushak Carpets () are Turkish carpets that use a particular family of designs, called by convention after the city of Uşak, Turkey – one of the larger towns in Western Anatolia, which was a major center of rug production from the early days of the Ottoman Empire, into the early 20th century (although these patterns were woven in other regions also).\n\nHistorically Ovshaks were classified as ‘Anatolian Rugs,’ Anatolian literally translating to ‘land of the rising sun.’ Today scholars know much more about Oushaks and are able to classify them as such. ‘Anatolian’ is used as a last resort when a more specific identification cannot be found; at which point ‘Anatolian’ refers to a carpet made in Turkey.\n\nThe level of international popularity attained by Uşak's carpets became such that the word \"Ushak\" is considered an English word of Turkic origin \n\nIn the European markets, the earlier types of Turkish carpets, before the \"star\" type, are now often called \"Lotto carpets\" and \"Holbein carpets\". The terms make reference to their depiction in minute detail in paintings by Lorenzo Lotto and Hans Holbein the Younger, in which they are often placed in a way to brighten the background, and suggest status. The region of Uşak still remains a vibrant center of hand-made carpet weaving today.\n\nThere are many Turkish rugs companies in the US Market. They manufacture carpets and rugs in Turkey and distribute them to US market through major retailers and online channels. Most of the rugs are machine made yet designed with a traditional Ushak look.\n\nAfter the 17th century, Ushaks (Ovshaks), development of Oushak rug weaving is less well known. Late 17th century saw a decline in the Oriental rug market as European consumers tended to purchase rugs of European origin – primarily Aubusson, Savonnerie and Axminster. The wane in the European market meant that Ovshak production declined. Those that were still made throughout the late 18th and early 19th centuries were manufactured for upper-class people in the Turkish territories on Eastern Europe.\n\nTowards the end of the 19th century, when the European market began to be interested in Persian carpets once again, the Ushak (Ovshak) population did not have enough weavers still skilled in the traditional Ovshak craft. Manufactories had to turn to neighboring villages and their craftsmen who still maintained traditional techniques.\n\nUshak carpets, particularly those known as Lotto carpets, are among the later types of Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting, as they were imported by Europeans, where they adorned cathedrals, churches, and the homes of the wealthy and powerful.\n\nUshak (Oushak) rugs are some of the finest Oriental Rugs, so much so that many of the masterpieces of the 15th and 16th centuries have been attributed to Oushak. The popular star and medallion carpets originated in Oushak.\n\nOushak rugs are known for the silky, luminous wool they work with. The dyes tend towards: cinnamons, terracotta tints, gold, blues, greens, ivory, saffron and grays.\n\nThe late 19th century saw the rejuvenation of Oriental rug production, at this time Oushak re-surfaced as a preeminent center of weaving industry. The new Oushak industry saw two major shifts in design: floral patterns in the Persian tradition were incorporated into design and room size, decorative carpets were woven as European standards demanded.\n\nThe late 19th century weavers came from villages outside of Oushak and employed tribal techniques. Paramount to these techniques was the use of larger knots (sometimes less than 30 knots per square inch) and an all-wool foundation. The tribal style fused with the older Ushak/Smyra designs. The merger of the two styles created a new style simply known as late 19th/early 20th century Oushak carpets. The new decorative Oushak, commercially woven, employed a soft red, as its primary color offsetting the large-scale floral motifs from the field in a bright blue. The luxurious quality of the wool (for which Oushaks had always been known) aided the colors luminosity.\n\nApproximately 40 years ago anthropologists did a study on the carpets of the larger mosques of Istanbul (such as the Sultan Ahmet Mosque). What they found was that the floors were covered with hundreds of carpets (sometimes several deep) almost exclusively from the Oushak region.\n\n"}

It handles projects in the spheres of cloud computing, healthcare and life sciences, verification technologies, multimedia, event processing, information retrieval, programming environments, business transformation, and optimization technologies. HRL is the biggest IBM research center outside the US.\n\nEstablished back in 1972 as the IBM Israel Scientific Center, the IBM Haifa Research Lab has grown from three researchers to over five hundred employees, including regular staff members and many students. The IBM Haifa Research Lab is located in a custom-built complex adjacent to the Haifa University campus, with branches in Haifa and Tel Aviv. Current projects include healthcare, cloud computing, formal and simulation-based verification technologies, programming environments, chip design, storage systems, information retrieval, collaboration, and much more.\n\nAt the IBM Haifa Research Lab, twenty-five percent of the technical staff have doctoral degrees in computer science, electrical engineering, mathematics, or related fields. Employees are actively involved in teaching at Israeli higher education institutions such as the Technion (Israel Institute of Technology) and supervising post-graduate theses. Many employees have received IBM awards for achievements and excellence.\n\nSTG incorporates the former Haifa Development Lab and develops advanced technologies for IBM's Systems and Technology Group. The STG Lab in Israel is involved in three major activities: storage technology, de-duplication software, and chip design. \nWorking closely with the Israeli hi-tech community and recent IBM acquisitions in Israel, the STG Lab serves as a focal point for building a storage ecosystem in Israel. The lab also works closely with the XIV team in IBM. Its three main departments are Hardware Development, Storage Systems Development, and Diligent Technologies.\n\nILSL develops software for real-time collaboration , content discovery and text analytics, metadata management , application security , and SOA . The teams work closely with the Lotus, Information Management, Rational, and WebSphere brands in IBM's Software Group.\n\nIn recent years IBM acquired over a dozen Israeli technology companies, which have been subsequently incorporate into IBM R&D Labs in Israel, they include:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2282187", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2282187", "title": "The Prophecy", "text": "The Prophecy\n\nThe Prophecy is a 1995 American fantasy-action-horror-thriller film starring Christopher Walken, Elias Koteas, Virginia Madsen, Eric Stoltz, and Viggo Mortensen. It was written and directed by Gregory Widen, and is the first motion picture of \"The Prophecy\" series including four sequels. The film tells the story of the Archangel Gabriel (Walken) and his search for an evil soul on Earth, and a police detective (Koteas) who unknowingly becomes caught in the middle of an angelic civil war.\n\nThomas Dagget, a Catholic seminary student, loses his faith when he sees visions of a war between angels. Years later, Thomas is a detective with the Los Angeles Police Department. Two angels fall to Earth: Simon briefly enters Thomas' home and warns him of coming events, while Usiel, a lieutenant of the Archangel Gabriel, is killed in an altercation with Simon. Investigating the disturbance, Thomas finds in Simon's apartment the obituary of recently deceased Korean War veteran Colonel Arnold Hawthorne, and a thesis about angels which Thomas himself wrote in seminary. Meanwhile, in Chimney Rock, Arizona, Simon finds Hawthorne awaiting burial and sucks his soul out of his body.\n\nThe medical examiner informs Thomas that Usiel's body has no eyes, no bones, hermaphroditism, and the blood chemistry of a fetus. His personal effects include an ancient Bible, with an expanded Book of Revelation that describes a second war in Heaven and prophecy that a \"dark soul\" will be found on Earth and used as a weapon.\n\nGabriel arrives on Earth. Needing a human helper, Gabriel catches a disappointed Jerry, a suicide, in the moment of his death. Jerry retrieves Usiel's belongings from the police station while Gabriel destroys Usiel's body in the morgue. Finding Hawthorne's obituary, Gabriel and Jerry head for Chimney Rock. Before Gabriel arrives, at the local reservation school Simon hides Hawthorne's soul in a little Native American girl, Mary, who immediately falls ill and is cared for by her teacher, Katherine.\n\nAfter finding Usiel's burnt body, Thomas hurries to Chimney Rock. When Gabriel realizes Hawthorne's soul is missing, he confronts Simon. Hawthorne's soul will tip the balance to whichever side possesses it, and a win for the rebellious angels would make Heaven like Hell with Earth in its thrall. Gabriel tortures Simon, but he refuses to reveal its location, so Gabriel kills him. Mary shows signs of possession by Hawthorne, recounting an incident from Hawthorne's harrowing war experiences in first-person perspective. Meanwhile, Thomas examines Simon's remains and questions Katherine. In Hawthorne's home, he finds evidence of war crimes. Thomas visits a church to reflect in and is shaken by a verbal confrontation with Gabriel.\n\nAt school, Katherine finds Gabriel questioning the children. After he leaves, she rushes to Mary's home and finds Thomas. As Mary's condition worsens, Katherine takes Thomas to an abandoned mine where she had seen Gabriel. They find angelic script and experience together a terrible vision of the angelic war. Returning to Mary, they find Gabriel and Jerry. Thomas kills Jerry, while Katherine distracts Gabriel when her wild gunshot misses him and blows up Mary's trailer home. They take Mary to a Native American site to be exorcised. In a hospital, Gabriel recruits a new unwilling assistant, Rachael, just as she dies of a terminal illness.\n\nLucifer confronts Katherine and tells her that \"other angels\" have taken up this war against mankind, and since then, no human souls have been able to enter Heaven. He knows Gabriel plans to use Hawthorne's soul to overthrow the obedient angels. He also knows that if Gabriel wins the war under his influence Heaven will ultimately devolve into another Hell, which Lucifer considers \"one Hell too many\". Lucifer then appears to Thomas and advises him to use Gabriel's lack of faith against him. When Gabriel arrives and attempts to disrupt the exorcism ritual, Thomas kills Rachael, and he and Katherine fight Gabriel. Gabriel defeats them and moves to kill Katherine.\n\nLucifer appears, encouraging the Natives to complete the exorcism. Lucifer confronts Gabriel, telling him that his war is based upon arrogance, which is evil, making it Lucifer's territory. Lucifer tells Gabriel he needs to go home and rips out his heart. Simultaneously Mary expels out Hawthorne's soul. The \"enemy ghost\" starts to attack Thomas and Katherine, but a bright light from Heaven appears and destroys it. Lucifer asks Thomas and Katherine to \"come home\" with him, but they refuse. Lucifer drags Gabriel to Hell. As morning comes, Thomas comments on the nature of faith and what it means to truly be human.\n\n\nRotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 43% of 23 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 5.1/10. Eric Hansen of \"Variety\" called it \"daring and unique on the one hand, but hard to swallow on the other\". Stephen Holden of \"The New York Times\" wrote that the film is bad enough to end the recent proliferation of religious thrillers. David Kronke of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote, \"Though Widen proves himself capable enough behind the camera, his script here is simply too loopy for him to render it in any credible fashion.\" Mick LaSalle of \"The San Francisco Chronicle\" wrote, \"Yet for all its goofiness, director Widen has made a film with some genuinely creepy moments.\" Owen Gleiberman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" rated it D− and described it as \"an occult freakshow so inert it seems to have been pasted together out of stock footage\".\n\nIt has since become a cult film.\n\nThe film spawned four direct-to-video sequels: \"The Prophecy II\" (1998), \"\" (2000), \"\" (2005) and \"\" (2005).\n\nThe film score by David C. Williams was released on Perseverance Records August 7, 2006. The song \"Breakin' Down\" by heavy metal band Skid Row plays over the closing credits.\n\n"}

It was destroyed in a raging fire (exact time unknown) and soon after, \"The New Market\" was built. Although it was used extensively before the fire, local people rarely mention about this lost market except the elderly, or ones who has lived nearby long enough to know the history of this old market.\n\n\"Binh Tay Market\" is sitting on Thap Muoi Street (Vietnamese: \"Đường Tháp Mười\"), a four street-block span connecting Confucius Street (Vietnamese: \"Đường Khổng Tử\" - old French: \"Quai de Gaudot\") to the North, and Hau Giang Street (Vietnamese: \"Đường Hậu Giang\") to the South, on the edge of District 6. It is the largest marketplace before the road leading West to Mien Tay of Vietnam, via a very important ground transportation hub named \"Xa Cảng Miền Tây\". Despite many wars over the years, \"Binh Tay Market\" has always been a major business hub not only for the local Vietnamese and Chinese, but also for the Vietnamese farmers trading daily goods coming from all directions of South Vietnam.\n\nBình Tây Market was built, or at least heavily financially supported, by a Chinese businessman named Guoyan (郭琰) better known as Quách Đàm, (1863–1927), originally hailing from Chaozhou in Guangdong. Quách Đàm operated his businesses under the trade name of \"Thông Hiệp\", but he was best known by his nickname \"\"Handicapped Thông\"\" among local Chinese. He started out very poor, making a living by recycling garbage and other used material; later, he began to enter into other types of businesses, in which he earned his fortune. There used to be a life-size bronze statue of Thông Hiệp standing right in the center of the Bình Tây Market, surrounded by four bronze lions, and four bronze dragons spitting water into the fountain under in which the statue of Thông was standing. The full size statue of Thông was replaced with a smaller glass altar sometime between 1976 and 1980 for unknown reasons. Nowadays, that statue is located in the Fine Art Museum of Ho Chi Minh city. The four bronze lions and dragons are still standing .\n"}

Following the Fatimid conquest of Egypt, he was dispatched to Nubia by the Fatimid governor Jawhar al-Siqilli in 975  (365 ) or perhaps a little earlier. He left a written record of his mission, the \"Kitāb Akhbār al-Nūba waʾl-Muḳurra wa ʿAlwa waʾl-Buja waʾl-Nīl\" (\"Book of Reports on Nubia, Makuria, Alodia, the Beja and the Nile\"). This is the only surviving eyewitness description of medieval Nubia other than the very brief account in Ibn Ḥawqal.\n\nJawhar, who had led the Fatimid conquest of Egypt, was apparently under the impression that the Nubians, who had previously resisted Islamization, might be persuaded to convert to Isma'ilism, the Islamic doctrine espoused by the Fatimids. He chose as his ambassador Abdallah ibn Ahmad ibn Salim from Aswan (the \"nisbah\" \"al-Aswani\" means \"of Aswan\") presumably because Aswan lay on Egypt's frontier with Nubia and so Abdallah could be presumed to have some familiarity with the country.\n\nIbn Salim travelled through much of Lower Nubia with a large retinue. He celebrated Eid al-Adha with some sixty fellow Muslims. He stayed several months in Dongola, the capital of Makuria. There he persuaded King George II to resume payment of the \"baḳt\", an annual tribute the Nubians had rendered to the Muslim rulers of Egypt since the seventh century. He failed, however, to persuade the king to convert to Islam, although he did engage in a debate at court. He also visited the southern kingdom of Alodia and describes its capital, Soba, in the \"Kitāb Akhbār al-Nūba\". He does not appear to have visited the country of the Beja, however, and his descriptions of it are secondhand.\n\nThe record of Ibn Salim's voyage survives only as excerpts in al-Maqrizi and al-Manufi. The excerpts of al-Maqrizi are quoted and abridged in Ibn Iyas. The original complete work is lost. The \"Kitāb\" seems to have once circulated relatively widely, since it can be detected as a source in several works, such as that of Abu al-Makarim. The \"Kitāb\" is still one of the most important sources on medieval Nubia. He describes the geography, history and contemporary political situation of the \"bilād al-Sūdān\". He describes a quite centralized and prosperous Makurian state. Unlike many other Arab writers, he seems favourably disposed to the Christian kingdoms.\n\n"}

It was developed primarily for internal security or armed reconnaissance purposes. Modeled after Renault's Véhicule de l'Avant Blindé (VAB) armoured personnel carrier, the VBC-90 was engineered in concert with Saviem and Creusot-Loire. One was also built in prototype form by Argentina under license, where it was known as the \"Vehículos de Apoyo y Exploración\". VBC-90s were available with various chassis configurations resembling both the VAB and the Berliet VXB-170.\n\nThe VBC-90 was developed by Renault and Saviem as a specialized reconnaissance and fire support variant of the \"Véhicule de l'Avant Blindé\". It had a very wide turret ring and was manufactured specifically to carry a large-calibre gun system. At least two prototypes had been completed by 1979 and were initially designated \"VCS-90\". The first two had boat-shaped hulls and glacis plates reminiscent of the VXB-170 and VAB, respectively. They essentially resembled six-wheeled variants of these vehicles, albeit with larger turret rings. The third had a more unique hull and a sloping glacis plate. It was this variant which was eventually accepted for production as the VBC-90.\n\nUnlike the VAB, the VBC was not developed to meet a French Army requirement and was intended solely for export to French military clients overseas. Nevertheless, from 1981, the French government ordered 28 VBC-90s for a single squadron of the Mobile Gendarmerie, as a replacement for the ageing AMX-13 light tanks. The last one was delivered in 1984 VBCs produced by Renault for the Gendarmerie were designated \"VBC-90G\". Another 6 were delivered to Oman between 1984 and 1985 as part of a much larger shipment of VABs for the Royal Omani Guard.\n\nOman has since announced it will be phasing out its VBC-90s in favor of the much more heavily armed B1 Centauro. The French gendarmerie phased out its VBCs in the early 2000s.\n\nA simplified VBC-90 variant known as the \"Vehículos de Apoyo y Exploración\" (VAPE) was developed for Argentina by Renault. It was trialled alongside a much heavier model of the ERC 90 Sagaie offered by Panhard, but neither of the two were adopted by the Argentine Army.\n\nIn 2014, Lebanon was lobbying for the purchase of an undisclosed number of VBC-90s. The deal was to be partly financed with military grants from Saudi Arabia but was frozen in 2016 due to tensions between Lebanon and Saudi Arabia.\n\nIt has a steel hull armoured to protect against small arms fire. It has a crew of three, with the driver sitting at the front of the vehicle with three bullet-proof windows provided for the driver. A GIAT TS 90 turret carries the commander and gunner, and carries an armament of a 90 mm cannon with a co-axial 7.62 mm machine gun. 20 rounds of 90 mm ammunition are carried in the turret, with a further 25 rounds in the hull.\n\nIt is powered by a six-cylinder diesel engine mounted at the rear of the hull, driving a 6x6 drive. The vehicle is not amphibious, unlike the VAB on which it was based.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2282202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2282202", "title": "The Gruffalo", "text": "The Gruffalo\n\nThe Gruffalo is a children's book by writer and playwright Julia Donaldson, illustrated by Axel Scheffler, that tells the story of a mouse, the protagonist of the book, taking a walk in the woods. The book has sold over 13 million copies, has won several prizes for children's literature, and has been developed into plays on both the West End and Broadway and even an Oscar nominated animated film.\n\n\"The Gruffalo\" was initially published in 1999 in the United Kingdom by Macmillan Children's Books () as a 32-page hardback edition, was followed six months later by a paperback edition, and subsequently by a small-format board book edition. It was penned for readers aged three to seven, and is about 700 words long. It is written in rhyming couplets, featuring repetitive verse with minor variance.\n\nThe story of a mouse's walk through the woods unfolds in two phases; in both, the mouse uses clever tricks to evade danger. On his way the mouse encounters several dangerous animals (a fox, an owl, and a snake). Each of these animals, clearly intending to eat the mouse, invites him back to their home for a meal. The cunning mouse declines each offer. To dissuade further advances, he tells each animal that he has plans to dine with his friend, a \"gruffalo\", a monstrous creature whose favourite food happens to be the relevant animal, and describes the features of the gruffalo's monstrous anatomy. Frightened that the gruffalo might eat it, each animal flees. Convinced the gruffalo is fictional, the mouse gloats thus:\n\nAfter getting rid of the last animal, the mouse is shocked to encounter a \"real\" gruffalo – with all the frightening features the mouse thought that he was inventing. The gruffalo threatens to eat the mouse, but again the mouse is cunning: he tells the gruffalo that he, the mouse, is the scariest animal in the forest. Laughing, the gruffalo agrees to follow the mouse as he demonstrates how feared he is. The two walk through the forest, encountering in turn the animals that had earlier menaced the mouse. Each is terrified by the sight of the pair and runs off – and each time the gruffalo becomes more impressed with the mouse's apparent toughness. Exploiting this, the mouse threatens to eat the gruffalo, which flees.\n\nThe story is based on a Chinese folk tale of a fox that borrows the terror of a tiger. Donaldson was unable to think of rhymes for \"tiger\" so instead she invented a word that rhymes with \"know\".\n\n\"The Gruffalo\" won the gold award (in the 0–5 years category) of the 1999 Nestlé Smarties Book Prize. It was the UK's best-selling picture book of 2000, won the 2000 Nottingham/Experian Children's Book award, and the \"Blue Peter\" Best Book To Read Aloud award. The audio version won the Best Children's Audio award in the Spoken Book Awards. In November 2009 the book was voted \"best bedtime story\" by listeners of BBC Radio 2. In a 2010 survey by UK charity Booktime, the book came first in a list of children's favourite books.\n\nThe Dean Heritage Centre in the Forest of Dean, England was given permission by author Julia Donaldson, illustrator Axel Scheffler and the publisher's Macmillan Children's Books, London, UK, to create a \"Gruffalo trail\" within the national park.\n\nDuring the time that Julia Donaldson lived in Bearsden, Gruffalo sculptures were installed around Kilmardinny Loch using natural materials, such as a beech tree trunk for the largest one.\n\"The Gruffalo\" has sold over 13 million copies in 59 editions worldwide. Translations include:\n\nThe book was initially sold as an A4 paperback book in 1999, and later as a smaller A5 board book version in 2002. An audiobook version, narrated by Imelda Staunton, was released in 2002, and a jigsaw book version () was published in 2004. The book is also sold packaged with a gruffalo soft toy. At some point in the print run of the hardcover paper page book, the dialogue was subtly changed. There are two different ISBN numbers for the book. However, the older ISBN number that relates to the original text is no longer available.\n\nThe \"Gruffalo song\" was released with the audiobook, as a standalone CD single, and on a musical CD with other songs from Donaldson's books.\n\nDonaldson and Scheffler's sequel, 2004's \"The Gruffalo's Child\" (which tells the story of the gruffalo's daughter, warned by her father of the terrifying mouse) won the \"Best Children's Book\" award in the 2005 British Book Awards.\n\nA Gruffalo Woodland Trail has been created at the Dean Heritage Centre, Soudley in the Forest of Dean, UK. The trail depicts the scenes from the book and has been carved by local chainsaw artists out of local redwood. Other Gruffalo-themed woodland walks in Great Britain include Kilmardinny Loch in Bearsden (mentioned above), Mount Vernon Park in Glasgow, Ardkinglas in Argyll, Whinlatter Forest Park in Cumbria, and several locations managed by Forestry England.\n\nA rideable wheeled Gruffalo children's suitcase is manufactured for Trunki; the case had been featured as a pitch idea on the entrepreneur game show \"Dragons' Den\" but was rejected by the show's judges.\n\nDonaldson and Scheffler have collaborated on many other titles; some feature cameos from the Gruffalo in other guises, including as Christmas tree decoration in Stick Man, a drawing by a child in \"The Snail and the Whale\" and a fish in \"Tiddler\".\n\nA commemorative UK 50p coin featuring \"The Gruffalo\" was issued in 2019.\n\nThe book has been adapted into a 27-minute animated film, which was broadcast on BBC One in the UK on 25 December 2009. This version features Robbie Coltrane in the title role, James Corden as the mouse, Helena Bonham Carter as the mother squirrel narrator, and Rob Brydon as the Snake. The production was animated at Studio Soi in Germany and produced through Magic Light Pictures. The film also has the voices of John Hurt as the Owl and Tom Wilkinson as the Fox. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Short Film (Animated) on 25 January 2011.

It is situated in the Lakes Region of central New Hampshire, in the towns of Alexandria, Bridgewater, Bristol, and Hebron. Its area of places it behind only Lake Winnipesaukee and Squam Lake among lakes located entirely within New Hampshire, and fourth in the state overall, when Umbagog Lake on the Maine border is included.\n\nNewfound Lake has of shoreline. The lake is about wide and long. The deepest point is . Major tributaries include the Fowler River and the Cockermouth River. Its outlet is the Newfound River, flowing through Bristol village into the Pemigewasset River. The lake volume is 98 billion gallons of water.\n\nWellington State Park, containing the largest freshwater swimming beach in the New Hampshire state park system, is a property located on the lake's west shore in the town of Bristol.\n\nBelle Island is a small island near the southern end of the lake. It was given to the state of New Hampshire by Camp Mowglis, a boys' camp located near the northern end of the lake, in 1942. According to a plaque posted on a rock on the island, the camp, known as the School of the Open, gave the island to the state \"to remain perpetually in its natural beauty for a camping area especially for residents of New Hampshire, but for anyone who wants to use it. Take good care of it,\" the plaque reads.\n\nA questionable tradition says that the Native Americans called the lake \"Pasquaney\", meaning \"the place where birch bark for canoes is found\". In 1751, John Kendall and Jonathan Farwell participated in marking the western lands of the Masonian proprietors, where they referred to it as \"Newfound Lake\" or \"Baker's Pond\". Evidently this information did not get to Emmanuel Brown in time for publication of his \"New and Accurate Map of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, and New England\" in 1752, as the lake was left nameless. In 1755, Thomas Jefferys published a \"Map of the Most Inhabited Parts of New England\" with the lake shown, but still without a name. In 1761, a map called the \"Accurate Map of his Majesty's Province of New Hampshire\" detailed the area, again with the lake nameless. In 1766 the New Chester proprietors refer to the lake in printed records as \"Newfound pond\". In 1791, Jeremy Belknap called it \"New Chester Pond\" in his \"History of New Hampshire\". \n\nBristol native Fred Lewis Pattee romantically referred to Newfound by its supposed Indian name in his poem \"Pasquaney Lake\".\n\nThe lake was originally fought over by John Mason and Peter Wheelright, who both claimed they owned a large plot of land with the lake being inside that plot. On November 7, 1629, Mason, a merchant from London, had the land from Newfound Lake to the Merrimack River in Massachusetts granted to him. Six months earlier, Reverend Peter Wheelright bought a large plot of land from native Indians that was similar to the land John Mason received. The argument went to court and lasted for more than one hundred years.\n\nEventually, Mason's sixth heir, John Tufton Mason, won the case and sold the land to a syndicate known as the Masonian proprietors. On September 14, 1753, a syndicate living in Chester, New Hampshire, bought the land from the Mason proprietors, and the land became known as \"New Chester\". On February 12, 1788, the territory was divided up, and the territory north and east of Newfound Lake and the Newfound River was incorporated as Bridgewater. Two thirds of the lake was incorporated as Bristol on June 24, 1819.\n\nIn 1890, the New Hampshire Fish and Game Commissioner stocked 15,000 landlocked salmon into the Fowler River, and in 1898, the NH Fish and Game Commission stocked 40,000 whitefish from Lake Superior.\n\nIn 1889, the state built a fish hatching house located on the Newfound River because of the \"ease with which the trout could be dipped from the spawning beds and stripped of the spawn.\" The house was and could hold 750,000 eggs. In 1897 a larger house was constructed, which held 1,000,000 lake trout eggs, 125,000 brook trout eggs, and 65,000 landlocked salmon eggs all in its first year of operation. After years of declining trout numbers, a screen was built at the outlet of the lake to prevent the fish from swimming down the Newfound River.\n\nToday, 22 species of fish are found in the Newfound Lake watershed:\n\n\nOf these species, six - brook trout, burbot, lake trout, rainbow smelt, round whitefish, and slimy sculpin - were selected as needing special consideration by the 2006 New Hampshire Wildlife Action Plan. Selection is based on a species' population status, integral ecological function, or the ability to extrapolate from it to indicate a healthy aquatic ecosystem.\n\nEvery year between mid-March and early July the lake is stocked with additional fish. In 2011 this included 305 landlocked salmon, with a total weight of , and 1,845 rainbow trout weighing .\n\nNewfound Lake has hosted multiple steamboats in its waters. The first, the \"Pioneer\" owned by Capt. George W. Dow, was placed in the lake in 1865. It was destroyed by fire. In 1878, Edward M. Drake put the \"Cardigan\" on the lake, which plied until 1883. That same year, the \"Lady Helen\" joined it, but was also destroyed in a fire. In May 1900, the \"Stella-Marion\" was launched at Kimball's beach. It freighted mail and passengers until it too was destroyed in a fire on September 2, 1915.\n\nReed Lighthouse, built in 1932, is located on West Shore Road next to the Ledges. Newfound Lighthouse stands at the Paradise Point Lodge on Route 3A in Bridgewater.\n\nThe Newfound Lake Region Association (NLRA) was created in 1971 to protect the waters of Newfound Lake and the surrounding land.

It formed the centrepiece of a estate. Sold to developers in 1965, the estate is now divided between State and private ownership.\n\nOn the piano nobile there are a series of ever grander reception rooms typical of the 1720s. The house was entered by ascending a staircase outside before coming into a large entrance hall which was graced with stucco gilding and pictures of the family. To the left is the dining room which was made out of two smaller rooms. To the right of the hall was the huge staircase itself. This was made of Portland stone and is cantilevered.\n\nStraight on is the Green Drawing Room and was also known as the Saloon because of its position in the house. This was the room that the family used to receive their guests in before leaving and (staying on the left hand side of the house) entering the Red Drawing Room.\n\nThe Print Room is decorated with cut-outs of favourite images, following the fashion of the 1760s. This room is on the right side and is thought to be the only surviving example of this in Ireland from this period.\n\nFurther on is the State Bedroom, which was never used by royalty as such, but by the various viceroys based in Dublin. In it are chairs which were from Venice.\n\nAnother feature of Castletown is the Long Gallery, an long room decorated in the Pompeian manner by O'Reilly in the 1770s in blue, red and gold.\n\nOn William Conolly's death in 1729, his widow Katherine (née Conyngham) continued living in the house and hosting extravagant entertainments there until her own death in 1752. The Castletown estate then passed to Conolly's nephew William James Conolly, MP for Ballyshannon. On William James' death in 1754 it passed to his son Tom Conolly whose wife, Lady Louisa (great-granddaughter of Charles II of England and Louise de Keroualle), finished the interior decoration during the 1760s and 1770s. Lady Louisa had grown up in Carton House, a demesne to the north east of Castletown house. Much of the work on the interior was carried out to designs of William Chambers. She also did extensive work on the grounds; the paths through the forest are still in walking condition although, due to anti-joyrider measures, several of the culverts have broken and the pathways are again subject to flooding. The drainage scheme through the woodland is ingenious, creating dry paths for walking on land that is below the watertable. The ha-ha fence is part of this intricate network.\n\nWhen Tom died in 1803 he left the estate to his wife who on her own death in 1821 bequeathed it to her great-nephew, Edward Michael Pakenham, later the MP for Donegal, on condition he adopted the surname of Conolly. He was succeeded by his eldest son, another Tom Conolly, the eccentric MP for Donegal from 1849 to 1876.\n\nTom's eldest son Thomas inherited Castletown, but after he was killed in 1900 the estate passed to his brother Major Edward Conolly. The Conolly family continued to live in their ancestral house, latterly as the Conolly-Carews, until 1965, when it was sold by The 6th Baron Carew, along with its collections and land, to a Major Wilson for £133,000. Some of the land has been built on, although with some of the estate's features retained amongst the new structures.\n\nThe house was bought in 1967 by Mariga and Desmond Guinness for £93,000 to save it from vandalism, became the flagship of the Irish Georgian Society, and was eventually handed over to the newly established Castletown Foundation.\n\nThe estate was sold on in parts, with held as curtilage around the house, some small quantities retained privately by Desmond Guinness, the forested \"Crodaun Woods\" part sold to what became Coillte and around acquired over time by Kildare County Council. Most of the core estate remains as woods or green space but a large fraction in the south west was developed as \"Castletown Estate\", controversially approaching the main house closely, and taking in the Walled Garden and the orchard (whose wall remains), which were lost. However, some other features, such as the Gazebo, the Steward's House and a mock temple, were retained, after negotiations between developer Janus Securities and the Irish Georgian Society.\n\nThe charitable Castletown Foundation struggled with the financial and operational demands of maintenance and ongoing restoration, and in 1994, following extensive negotiations between the foundation and the State, Castletown House, with its 120-acre residual demesne, was transferred to the Office of Public Works (OPW).\n\nThe OPW continued the programme of restoration, of both house and lands.\n\nAcross the broader former estate, and despite the protection of the house and some estate features, at least one of the outlying features, \"The Gazebo\", was partly demolished, without planning permission, in late 2007. An enforcement notice was served on the developer concerned, and further action is expected.\n\nIn 2012, work began to restore the lake on the lawn between Castletown House and the Liffey, and this was followed in 2016 by work on the pleasure grounds behind and to the west of the house.\n\nCastletown House has opened its doors to various academic and artistic organisations. The first arts organisation to take up residency at Castletown House in 2007 was The Performance Corporation, an Irish site-specific theatre company. The company operates an office from the premises as well as running rehearsals for their productions and hosting an annual international cross-artform residency programme, the SPACE Programme.\n\nThe OPW-Maynooth University Archive and Research Centre was launched by President Mary McAleese in November 2008. It was established to facilitate the care and study of archives and other sources dealing with the history of Irish estates, their houses and inhabitants. It also facilitates research in the decorative arts. This facility marks an exciting new collaboration between the Office of Public Works and Maynooth University. The Archive and Research Centre is located on the second floor of Castletown House. \n\nA weekly parkrun takes place in the parklands of Castletown house every Saturday.\n\nFormer St Patrick's Athletic F.C. and current Kerry goalkeeping coach Mick O'Shea is the current caretaker of Castletown House.\n\nAccess by pedestrians is possible from Celbridge along the former half-mile main drive lined with lime trees. Access by car is from the north beside junction 6 of the N4 / M4 motorway, with a car park near the house. An informal footpath runs along the river Liffey, and a second path runs from the house towards Leixlip, passing the gate lodge designed by Batty Langley.\n\n\n"}

It stars Ronald Mlodzik, who also appears in Cronenberg's \"Crimes of the Future\", \"Shivers\" and \"Rabid\". It was Cronenberg's first feature-length effort, following his two short films, \"Transfer\" and \"From the Drain\". It is a brief feature film, with a running time of a little over one hour.\n\nThe film has a 60% 'fresh' rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nThe film purports to be part of a \"mosaic\" of educational resources by the Canadian Academy of Erotic Enquiry. It documents an experiment by the unseen Dr. Luther Stringfellow. A young man (Ronald Mlodzik) in a black cloak is seen arriving at the Academy, where he joins a group of young volunteers who are being endowed with telepathic abilities which they are encouraged to develop through sexual exploration. It is hoped that telepathic groups, bonded in polymorphous sexual relationships, will form a socially stabilising replacement for the \"obsolescent family unit\". One girl develops a secondary personality in order to cope with her new state of consciousness, which gradually ousts her original personality. As the volunteers' abilities develop, the experimenters find themselves increasingly unable to control the progress of the experiment. They decide to separate the telepaths, which results in two suicides. The final sequence shows the young woman who developed an extra personality wearing the black cloak.\n\nThe film was shot in black and white, and silent because the Bolex camera Cronenberg was using made too much noise. A commentary, purportedly by various followers of Stringfellow's theories, and parodying scientific and metaphysical jargon, was added later.\nThe film was shot at Scarborough College (University of Toronto).\n\nThe film embodies several themes now common within Cronenberg's body of work. The exploration (voluntary or otherwise) of new states of consciousness via sexual experimentation is a major theme in \"Shivers\", \"Videodrome\", \"Dead Ringers\", \"Naked Lunch\", \"M. Butterfly\" and \"Crash\". The idea of telepathy induced by an unknown scientist recurs in \"Scanners\", as does the image of one tormented telepath who uses an electric drill to pierce his own forehead in what \"Stereo\"'s commentary refers to as \"an act of considerable symbolic significance\".\n\nThe film has been included as a special feature in multiple releases of other Cronenberg films, including in standard definition on Blue Underground's Blu-ray release of \"Fast Company\", in high definition on Criterion release of \"Scanners\" and also in high definition on a bonus disc in Arrow Video's UK Blu-ray release of \"Videodrome\", The bonus disc from \"Videodrome\" was later released on its own as David Cronenberg's Early Works.\n\n"}

His massive tome, \"De Synagoga Judaica\" (1st. ed. 1603), scrupulously documents the customs and society of German Jewry in the early modern period.\n\nBuxtorf was the father of Johannes Buxtorf the Younger.\n\nBuxtorf was born at Kamen in Westphalia. The original form of the name was Bockstrop, or Boxtrop, from which was derived the family crest, which bore the figure of a goat (Ger. Bock, he-goat). After the death of his father, who was minister of Kamen, Buxtorf studied at Marburg and the newly founded Herborn Academy, at the latter of which Caspar Olevian (1536–1587) and Johannes Piscator (1546–1625) had been appointed professors of theology. At a later date Piscator received the assistance of Buxtorf in the preparation of his Latin translation of the Old Testament, published at Herborn in 1602-1603. From Herborn Buxtorf went to Heidelberg, and thence to Basel, attracted by the reputation of Johann Jakob Grynaeus and J. G. Hospinian (1515–1575).\n\nAfter a short residence at Basel, he studied successively under Heinrich Bullinger (1504–1575) at Zürich and Theodore Beza at Geneva. On his return to Basel, Grynaeus, desirous that the services of so promising a scholar should be secured to the university, procured him a situation as tutor in the family of Leo Curio, son of Celio Secondo Curione, well known for his sufferings on account of the Reformed faith. At the insistence of Grynaeus, Buxtorf undertook the duties of the Hebrew chair in the university, and discharged them for two years with such ability that at the end of that time he was unanimously appointed to the vacant office. From this date (1591) to his death in 1629 he remained in Basel, and devoted himself with remarkable zeal to the study of Hebrew and rabbinic literature. He received into his house many learned Jews, that he might discuss his difficulties with them, and he was frequently consulted by Jews themselves on matters relating to their ceremonial law. He seems to have well deserved the title which was conferred upon him of \"Master of the Rabbins.\" His partiality for Jewish society brought him, indeed, on one occasion into trouble with the authorities of the city, the laws against the Jews being very strict. Nevertheless, on the whole, his relations with the city of Basel were friendly. He remained firmly attached to the university which first recognized his merits, and declined two invitations from the University of Leiden and Academy of Saumur successively. His correspondence with the most distinguished scholars of the day was very extensive; the library of the university of Basel contains a rich collection of letters, which are valuable for a literary history of the time.\n\n\nBuxtorf did not live to complete the two works on which his reputation chiefly rests, his \"Lexicon Chaldaicum, Talmudicum, et Rabbinicum\", and the \"Concordantiae Bibliorum Hebraicorum\", both of which were edited by his son. The lexicon was republished at Leipzig in 1869 with some additions by Bernard Fischer, and the concordance was assumed by Julius Fürst as the basis of his own Hebrew concordance, which appeared in 1840. \n\nWilhelm Gesenius wrote in 1815 that he considered Buxtorf's Hebrew grammar the best yet written.\n\n\n"}

Airport/Sardy Field covers an area of at an elevation of 7,820 feet (2,384 m) above mean sea level. It has one asphalt paved runway designated 15/33 which measures 8,006 by 100 feet (2,440 x 30 m).\n\nFor the 12-month period ending January 1, 2017, the airport had 42,405 aircraft operations, an average of 116 per day: 51% general aviation, 26% air taxi, 23% scheduled commercial, and <1% military. In March 2019, there were 95 aircraft based at this airport: 66 single-engine, 10 multi-engine, 13 jet, 5 helicopter, and 1 glider.\n\nAspen/Pitkin Co. Airport has more regular service from major carriers than any other regional ski town airport in North America. In the winter, its regular, weekly flights number more than 170 (not including extra flights often run during busy holiday seasons). In addition to regular service from Denver, Aspen sees more than 20 flights a week from Chicago and Los Angeles.\n\nIn 2007, the runway was completely rehabilitated with new grooved asphalt. A partial length parallel taxiway A is located from the runway centerline on the east side of the runway, and serves general aviation on the north end of the airport and the commercial terminal on the south end. The airport meets modified FAA D-III airport reference code standards.\n\nOn April 4, 2011, the airport began a $15.5 million runway extension project which added 1,000 feet of runway length to the existing 8,006 feet long runway. This project was completed on November 2, 2011.\n\nThe Aspen/Pitkin County airport terminal is a single floor facility, which has undergone several renovations since its original construction in 1976. The airport terminal hosts six rental car operations, a year-round guest services operation, and restaurant and gift shop concessions. As of fall 2009, the airport is undertaking a terminal area plan, which is evaluating potential improvements to the existing facility, or the construction of a new facility on or near the existing terminal site. This study is expected to be complete in 2010.\n\nSeveral airport improvements are planned or underway at the Aspen/Pitkin County Airport. An environmental assessment for a proposed extension of to the airport's existing runway was approved by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in June 2010. That same month the Pitkin County Board of County Commissioners approved the land use application for the runway extension project, giving the green light for construction. The extension will be at the south end of the runway and used only for takeoffs to the north. (Due to high terrain south of the airport, the Aspen/Pitkin County airport typically operates in a \"contra-flow\" operation, with arrivals landing to the south and departures taking off to the north.) The runway extension will not alter the airport's existing aircraft wingspan limitation or aircraft weight limit. It will allow existing commercial aircraft to fill more seats on existing flights, seats which can be unavailable due to the high-density altitudes often experienced at the airport.\n\nConstruction on the runway extension project began on April 4, 2011, and was completed on November 2, 2011.\n\nThe airport is also conducting an update of its 2004 Airport Master Plan. This plan, scheduled for completion in late 2011 will update the airport activity forecasts and further evaluate potential improvements to the west side of the airport that were broadly identified in the 2004 Airport Master Plan.\n\nOne of the potential improvements included in the 2012 Updated Master Plan is the construction of a new airport terminal. The new terminal would be an 80,000 square foot, two-story structure with eight boarding gates. If constructed, it will be capable of serving a projected 250,452 enplanements by 2017. The estimate of this new terminal, along with a proposed underground parking structure, is $121.8 million.\n\nPer Title X of the Pitkin County Code, the airport has several unique operating limitations. Due to non-standard runway/taxiway separation, the airport has a aircraft wingspan limitation. Aircraft weight is restricted to maximum certificated gross landing weight or less. For rough guidance, these restrictions preclude aircraft like the current 737 series and larger. The Aspen/Pitkin County Airport also has an airport operating curfew. No aircraft operations are permitted between 23:00 local and 07:00 local. No aircraft departures are permitted after 22:30 local. FAR Part 36 Stage II aircraft operations are not permitted more than 30 minutes after official sunset. For most aircraft operations, especially commercial operations using CRJ-700 planes, aircraft must land to the south but take off to the north. This can lead to occasional delays, cancellations, and weight restrictions depending on wind strength and direction.\n\nThe Aspen/Pitkin County Airport is certificated as a Class I, ARFF Index B commercial service airport under FAR Part 139. The airport's operations department is responsible for daily compliance with FAA Part 139, including daily airport safety inspections, rules and regulations enforcement, and aircraft rescue and firefighting (ARFF). In July 2009, the airport took delivery of a new. Oshkosh Striker 1500 Index B ARFF truck. Mutual aid response to airport incidents is provided by the Aspen Fire Department, Pitkin County Sheriffs Department, Aspen Ambulance, and others.\n\nAirport operations staff operates from the airport's Operations Center, constructed in 2006 on the west side of the airport. This facility houses airport operations and facilities maintenance staff, as well as the airport's fleet of ARFF, snow removal, and other airport equipment.\n\nSkyWest Airlines flies on behalf of American Airlines flying as American Eagle, United Airlines operating as United Express as well as on behalf of Delta Air Lines operating as Delta Connection. \n\nHistorically, the airport was served by a number of airlines over the years including Aspen Airways which introduced the first scheduled passenger jet service into Aspen with the British Aerospace BAe 146-100. Aspen Airways first aircraft were surplus Douglas DC-3s.\n\nBefore initiating jet service, Aspen operated Convair 580 turboprops as well as other prop and turboprop aircraft. Aspen Airways went on to become a United Express carrier and was then subsequently acquired by Air Wisconsin which continued to serve the airport with BAe 146 jetliners operating as United Express. Another BAe 146 jet operator that served Aspen was TriStar Airlines with nonstop service to Los Angeles.\n\nBusiness Express and Mesaba Airlines, both operating as Northwest Airlink, respectively flew the Avro RJ70 and Avro RJ85, later versions of the BAe 146 jet, on seasonal nonstop flights to Minneapolis/St. Paul and Memphis on behalf of Northwest Airlines. Rocky Mountain Airways served Aspen as well with de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter twin-engine turboprops and later with new, 50 passenger DHC-7 Dash 7 four engine turboprops. RMA was the worldwide launch customer for the Dash 7 and was also Aspen Airways primary competitor on the Aspen-Denver route for many years. Rocky Mountain Airways later operated Continental Express feeder service into Aspen with its turboprop aircraft when Continental Airlines operated a connecting hub in Denver. In addition, Mesa Airlines served the airport flying de Havilland Canada DHC-8 Dash 8 turboprops with flights to Denver operating as United Express and also separately as America West Express with Dash 8 flights to Phoenix. Mountain Air Express (MAX) served Aspen as well flying Dornier 328 propjets via a codesharing agreement with Western Pacific Airlines which was based in Colorado. An early commuter airline which served Aspen during the mid-1970s was Western Air Stages operating Handley Page Jetstream propjets with nonstop service to Colorado Springs. In 1982, Wings West Airlines was operating nonstop service on the weekends to Phoenix with Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner \"Metro III\" commuter propjets.\n\nMore recently, Lynx Aviation flying on behalf of Frontier Airlines operated Bombardier Q400 turboprops into Aspen. The Q400 is the latest, largest and fastest version of the Dash 8; however, this feeder service to Denver for Frontier was subsequently discontinued.\n\nGeneral aviation services are provided by Atlantic Aviation, the airport's sole fixed-base operator.\n\n\n"}

He was used sparingly as a squad player by several managers, until Ebbe Skovdahl allowed him to go on loan to Inverness Caledonian Thistle in 1999, where he played as a midfielder, then as a striker. Wyness signed a permanent contract for Caley Thistle in January 2000. However, during his first twelve months at the club he struggled to make an impact, and was eventually transfer-listed by then-manager Steve Paterson. This provided Wyness with a huge incentive to fight his way back into the team and he responded to his transfer listing by beginning to score goals almost immediately. He was eventually taken off the transfer list in December 2000, and soon became a firm favourite of the Caley Thistle supporters.\n\nWyness was Caley Thistle's top scorer of season 2000–01, with 24 league goals. The following season, he netted 18 times in the league and, in season 2001–02, established a strike partnership with Paul Ritchie which resulted in 37 league goals between the two of them that season. In March 2003 he also scored the only goal of the game as Caley Thistle once again sent Celtic crashing out of the Scottish Cup.\n\nWyness's excellent performances in front of goal earned him a move to Heart of Midlothian in the summer of 2003. Wyness found it hard to break into the Hearts team and was only occasionally used by Levein. He fared better under Craig Levein's successor, John Robertson, who had also managed him at Caley Thistle, but when Robertson was replaced by George Burley in 2005 Wyness once again found himself out of favour. He returned on loan to Caley Thistle and he signed a pre-contract agreement in January 2006 to rejoin the Inverness club on a permanent basis. In late May 2006, once his Hearts contract expired, he signed a two-year deal with Caley Thistle.\n\nWyness holds the Inverness Caledonian Thistle scoring record, with a total of 101 goals. He netted his 100th goal for Inverness against his first club, Aberdeen.\n\nIn May 2008, Wyness agreed a two-year deal to join St Mirren. Wyness scored the first goal for the Buddies at their new ground named St. Mirren Park, in a match against Kilmarnock.\n\nOn 25 September 2009 Dumfries club Queen of the South announced Wyness had joined on a three-month loan deal. Wyness netted a debut goal a day later in the 4–1 win away to Dunfermline Athletic that put Queens top of the table. Wyness returned to St. Mirren after making seven appearances and scoring two goals for Queens.\n\nOn 25 January 2010, St. Mirren announced Wyness was free to find himself another club, and he was later released from his contract. Wyness then signed for Second Division club Dumbarton until the end of the 2009–10 season.\n\nWyness then signed for Peterhead for the 2010–11 season.\n\nWyness signed for Elgin City during the 2012 summer transfer window. He scored his first goal for the club in an incredible 7–5 home loss in the first round of the 2012–13 Ramsden's Cup against Arbroath.\n\nAfter Elgin, he went on to play for Buckie Thistle in the 2015/16 season, and then signed for Huntly F.C. in 2016.\n\n"}

It takes place in New York City in the 1990s, and revisits some characters of the original, including Yossarian, Milo Minderbinder and Chaplain Tappman.\n\nThe book has two stories that are interwoven throughout – that of Yossarian in the last stages of his life, and that of Sammy Singer and Lew Rabinowitz, two men from Coney Island who also fought in World War II (the Sammy Singer character makes a brief appearance in \"Catch-22\" as the tailgunner aboard Yossarian's bomber who kept waking up and fainting when he saw Yossarian trying to attend to the wounds of Snowden).\n\nAs with \"Catch-22\", the topic of death is omnipresent, only in this case from (usually) age-related illnesses, in particular cancer (rather than dying in battle, as with its predecessor).\n\nOne notable inconsistency in the book is that although Yossarian was 28 in \"Catch-22\", which took place in 1944, in \"Closing Time\" Yossarian is 68, and the time of \"Catch-22\" is referred to as \"50 years ago\". When asked about the inconsistency in an interview with \"The New York Times\", Heller replied, \"I know, but I decided to ignore it.\"\n\nThere is a man mentioned by Lew named \"Vonnegut\", whom he met while in Dresden.

Bernstein, 1834) and his publication of \"Young Germany\" () established his reputation as a writer among the literary critics of Berlin. He was the author of two Ghetto stories, \"Vögele der Maggid\" and \"Mendel Gibbor\", being one of the originators of this genre of modern fiction.\n\nHe was also a publicist. In 1849 he founded the \"Urwählerzeitung\", in which (in 1851) he published some ultra-democratic articles which brought about his imprisonment. The paper was finally suppressed in 1853, and Bernstein established the \"Volkszeitung\", a journal devoted, like its predecessor, largely to the dissemination of democratic views.\n\nHis \"History of Revolution and Reaction in Prussia and Germany from the Revolution of 1848 up to the present\" (; 3 vols., 1883–1884) was a collection of important political essays. In the middle of the 19th century Bernstein took an active share in the movement for synagogue reform in Germany.\n\nHis multivolume book \"From the field of natural science\" (; 1853-1856), later republished under the title \"Popular Books on Natural Science\" (; 1880), was frequently reprinted and translated into nearly all the languages of Europe.\n\nAlready in the edition of 1855, Bernstein published ideas on space, time and the speed of light which had appeared in the anonymous treatise \"The Stars and the Earth\" () written by 'an unknown clear-sighted thinker.' It was not until 1874 when a new German edition appeared that the name of the author - Felix Eberty - was made public. When this edition was re-published in 1923, Albert Einstein wrote a preface.\n\nA story in volume 16 of Bernstein's \"Naturwissenschaftliche Volksbücher\" about riding along with the electricity travelling through a telegraph wire is often credited with inspiring the 16-year-old Albert Einstein to think about travelling along with a beam of light and seeing it stationary. Such thought experiments eventually led to his famous theory of special relativity.\n\nHe was the uncle of Eduard Bernstein, a Social Democratic theorist and activist.\n\n\n"}

Little was born in Brookline, Massachusetts and attended Harvard University after his secondary education at the Noble and Greenough School. While studying under W. E. Castle, Little began his work with mice, focusing on inheritance, transplants, and grafts. He also was an assistant dean and secretary to the president. His most important research occurred at Harvard, including what some call his most brilliant work, \"A Mendelian explanation for the inheritance of a trait that has apparently non-Mendelian characteristics\". His observations on transplant rejection became codified into the \"five laws of transplant immunology\" by George Snell. Little developed the \"DBA (Dilute, Brown and non-Agouti)\" strain of mice while at Harvard. For his research, he received posthumously the 1978 Cancer Research Institute William B. Coley Award.\n\nLittle received an A.B. from Harvard University in 1910, an M.S. in 1912, and D.Sc. in 1914 in zoology, with special focus in the new science of genetics.\n\nDuring World War I Little served in the U.S. Army Signal Corps, attaining the rank of Major. Following the war he spent three years at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. In 1921 he helped found the American Birth Control League with Margaret Sanger and Lothrop Stoddard.\n\nLittle accepted the post of President of the University of Maine in 1922, becoming at age 33 the youngest university president in the country. While there he started a summer laboratory in Bar Harbor. In 1925 he left to become the President of the University of Michigan. His tenure at the university was controversial due to his outspokenness in favor of eugenics, birth control, and euthanasia. He left Michigan in 1929 in order to devote himself to his research at Bar Harbor. With funding from Detroit car manufacturers he was able to improve the facility for year-round use. He renamed it the \"Jackson Laboratory\" in honor of one donor, Roscoe B. Jackson of the Hudson Motor Car Corporation. Also in 1929 he took on a part-time job as managing director of the American Society for the Control of Cancer (later became the American Cancer Society (ACS)) and served as President to the American Eugenics Society.\n\nFunding for the Jackson Laboratory was extremely limited during the Great Depression, but it received one of the first grants from the newly formed National Cancer Institute in 1938. Little energetically developed both the lab and the ACS, and by 1944 they were shipping 9000 mice a week to other laboratories. The laboratory and all of the livestock were destroyed in the Great Bar Harbor Fire in the Fall of 1947. The lab was quickly rebuilt and most mouse strains were recovered from other labs around the world. By 1950 the lab was maintaining 60 inbred strains, and had developed the F hybrid that became widely used for chemical testing. Little resigned in 1954.\n\nHis last major post, from 1954 to 1969, was as the Scientific Director of the Scientific Advisory Board of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee (renamed Council for Tobacco Research in 1964). In that role he was a leading scientific voice of the tobacco industry and oversaw a USD 1 million research budget that gave grants to hundreds of scientists. In 1959 he refuted his earlier assertion, made as Director of the ACS, that inhaling fine particles is unhealthy, and stated that smoking does not cause lung cancer and is at most a minor contributing factor. A decade later he said, \"there is no demonstrated causal relationship between smoking or any disease.\" In keeping with his earlier research he believed that the main cause of cancer was genetic, not environmental.\n\nLittle died of a heart attack in 1971 in Ellsworth, Maine at the age of 83.\n\nThe C. C. Little Science Building at the University of Michigan was named in his honor. In 2017, five faculty members and an undergraduate student submitted a formal request to University of Michigan President Mark Schlissel to change the building's name because of Little's previous support of eugenics. The building’s sign without Little’s name was replaced on March 29, 2018.\n\n\n\n"}

Early civic leader Francis K. Shattuck donated land for the railroad and its depot, and subsidized the initial construction. Berkeley was the terminus of the line until 1878, when it was extended northwest along Shattuck. The Central Pacific was leased by the Southern Pacific Railroad (SP) in 1885, then transferred to its Northern Railway subsidiary in 1888. The first Berkeley station was a small wooden building at the northwest corner of Center Street and Shattuck; it was replaced in the 1890s by a slightly larger by still modest station.\n\nOn October 26, 1903, the Key System began electric commuter rail operation from Berkeley to the San Francisco ferries - a direct threat to the SP's steam-hauled trains - on a line that paralleled the SP tracks on Shattuck. Around that time, Cal president Benjamin Ide Wheeler and other prominent Berkeley academics lobbied SP president E. H. Harriman for an improved train station to complement John Galen Howard's emerging architectural style for the nearby University of California, Berkeley. Finally, the devastating 1906 earthquake and subsequent rebuilding \"served as a powerful incentive to expedite the project\".\n\nSurveying work began in June 1906; that September, SP management announced their intentions to convert their suburban lines to a frequent electric service to compete with the Key System. The new station, an elegant red brick structure with buff terracotta trim, red tile roof, and a colonnade, opened on April 9, 1908. It was officially designed by SP architect Daniel J. Patterson in a similar style to Émile Bénard's original plans for the university, though the high quality of its design and circumstantial evidence led some historians to believe it was actually designed by Howard. The SP lines were fully electrified in 1911.\n\nDowntown Berkeley opened on January 29, 1973, as part of the extension from MacArthur to Richmond, with service southward to Fremont until the opening of the Transbay Tube and subsequent service to San Francisco later that year. The station was designed by Maher & Martens of San Francisco in collaboration with Parsons Brinckerhoff, Tudor Construction, and Bechtel.\n\nIn 1995, BART changed the name of the station from \"Berkeley\" to \"Downtown Berkeley\" in an effort to minimize confusion between this station and North Berkeley.\n\nA station and plaza renovation project began construction on August 29, 2016 and opened to the public on October 19, 2018. The new plaza includes new lighting, landscaping, drainage, paving, and bus shelters in the overground plaza of the station. The old main rotunda entrance has been removed and was replaced by a glass entrance structure similar to those in Downtown Oakland. The $11.2 million project is funded primarily by BART, with additional funding from the City of Berkeley, Metropolitan Transportation Commission, and Alameda County. A further project to renovate the underground station interior is in the planning stages.\n\nLike most underground BART stations, Downtown Berkeley has two levels: a mezzanine containing the faregates and an island platform with two tracks. Access to the station is provided by five street-level entrances on Shattuck Avenue, with two at Addison Street and Allston Way each and one at the southwest corner of Shattuck Avenue and Center Street. The escalators at the latter were topped by an 24-sided rotunda featuring artwork of the UCB Botanical Garden.\n\n"}

In particular he argued in favor of a variety of conditions collectively contributing to the incidence of disease including: personal state of health, the fermentation of environmental ground water, and also the germ in question. He was most well known for his establishment of hygiene as an experimental science and also was a strong proponent for the founding of hygiene institutes in Germany. His work served as an example which other institutes around the world emulated.\n\nPettenkofer was born in Lichtenheim, near Neuburg an der Donau, now part of Weichering. He was a nephew of Franz Xaver (1783–1850), who from 1823 was a surgeon and apothecary to the Bavarian court and was the author of some chemical investigations on the vegetable alkaloids. After a falling out with a relative he was staying with he briefly entered the theater. He returned to his family to marry Helene Pettenkofer. A stipulation of his marriage was that he pursue another career and was advised to pursue medicine. He attended the Wilhelmsgymnasium, in Munich, then studied pharmacy and medicine at the Ludwig Maximilian University, where he graduated M.D. in 1845.\n\nAfter working under Liebig at Gießen, Pettenkofer was appointed chemist to the Munich mint in 1845. Two years later he was chosen as an extraordinary professor of chemistry at the medical faculty. In 1853 he was made a full professor and in 1865 he also became a professor of hygiene. In his earlier years he devoted himself to chemistry, both theoretical and applied, publishing papers on a wide range of topics. One of his first projects and subsequent publications was in the separation of gold, silver, and platinum. This work derived from his position at the Munich mint and was centered around minimizing the costs of currency conversion by separating the precious metals from one another. The purer elements could then be utilized in other applications. Later in his career he continued published and spoke about the numerical relations between the atomic masses of analogous elements. His theories were early in the development of the Periodic Table. He rejected the current theory of triads and expanded the connections between the elements to larger groupings. He argued that the weights of different elements in a group were separated by multiples of a certain number that varied based upon the group. His work in this area was later cited by Dmitri Mendeleev in his construction of the Periodic Table of Elements. He continued his publications in a wide variety of other fields as well including: the formation of aventurine glass, the manufacture of illuminating gas from wood, the preservation of oil paintings, and an improved process for cement production among other things. The color-forming reaction known by his name for the detection of bile acids was published in 1844. In his widely used method for the quantitative determination of carbonic acid the gaseous mixture is shaken up with baryta or limewater of known strength and the change in alkalinity ascertained by means of oxalic acid. He further provided the experimental proof that the mysterious \"haematinum\" of ancient times was in fact a copper-colored glass.\n\nPettenkofer's name is most familiar in connection with his work in practical hygiene, as an apostle of good water, fresh air and proper sewage disposal. His attention was drawn to this subject by the unhealthy condition in Munich in the 19th century. Specifically he examined the field of hygiene and determined that there was a minimal amount of rigorous research. He was responsible for transitioning the field of hygiene into a research-oriented field. He is further responsible for the acceptance of hygiene as a science to be examined in medical schools and to be taught in specific hygiene departments. In 1865 his petitions to the government were accepted and three departments of hygiene were established in Munich, Würzburg, and Erlangen. By 1882 hygiene was included in examinations for medical students in every major city of Germany. As one of the principal proponents for the field of hygiene in Munich he was responsible for giving presentations to government officials in order to secure funding for public health projects.\n\nOne of the prevailing arguments of the day that Pettenkofer focused on was the relationship between sewage and the health of a population. In one of his first major projects in his home city of Munich Pettenkofer advocated for the development of running water throughout the city. He also emphasized the selection of the Mangfall River, not the readily at hand and highly polluted Isar River, as the source of the city's drinking water. Many of his additions and plans for the city's sewage system are reflected today in the current sewage system layout.\n\nDuring his schooling he studied for a time under Justus von Liebig where he applied his study of chemistry to the study of chemical reactions occurring within the body. This in particular focused on the study of the science of nutrition and the reactions in the body that consumed foods and produced the processes of the body. He further advocated for reform of the food production system used in Munich. He argued that the system for the study of proper cattle feed was more well developed than that for humans and recommended civic funding for studying proper nutrition. He proposed that this study of nutrition was important specifically for the poor and those in strictly controlled environments such as prison because they were most at risk for obtaining sub-par nutrition due to their limited control over their food consumption.\n\nHe further advocated for the construction of more spacious living accommodations. He asserted that there was a strong link between proper circulation of \"good air\" through houses, adequate space for living, and the health of the occupants. His beliefs aligned significantly with the school of thought known as the Miasma theory. He firmly believed that the causes of disease were related to the multitude of environmental factors that the people of Munich were required to live in. Air was of a particular interest to him and he continued to advocate for its relevance to the processes of disease, specifically the spread of cholera. He was also a strong proponent of regular bathing and changing of clothes in its relationship to health through the further regulation of the heat of the body. He advocated that health was the collective responsibility of a city to behave as best they are able to further the health of the general population.\n\nIn addition to the wide number of publications and lectures that he gave on the subject of public health Pettenkofer was also involved in the initiative to create an Institute of Public Health in Munich. He continued research into a variety of fields listed above as head of the Institute of Physiology in Munich from 1857 onwards. After numerous successful audiences with two of the kings of Bavaria he had helped found the first three hygiene departments. In 1879 he finally achieved his goal of the creation of a standalone Institute of Hygiene in Munich. This institution was larger than his previous accommodations in the department of Physiology and allowed him to continue to his research and to gather a large cohort of research students under his teachings. The founding of his Institute of Hygiene drew significant international attention and was considered a model for many later institutions including the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health in Baltimore.\n\nDuring his career his position as a strong proponent of public health at times placed him at odds with his contemporaries, most notably Robert Koch. During his career Koch identified and isolated a large number of bacterial strains and was a supporter of the theory that these germs were the main causes of disease. This placed him at odds with Pettenkofer's broader approach to disease that involved many other environmental factors in addition to the activity of the germ of a disease. The two scientists conflicted most notably over the subject of cholera. In one specific case, Pettenkofer obtained bouillon laced with a large dose of \"Vibrio cholerae\" bacteria from Robert Koch, the proponent of the theory that the bacteria was the sole cause of the disease. He consumed the bouillon in a self-test in the presence of several witnesses on 7 October 1892. He also took bicarbonate of soda to neutralise his stomach acid to counter a suggestion by Koch that the acid could kill the bacteria. Pettenkofer suffered mild symptoms for nearly a week but claimed these were not associated with cholera. The modern view is that he did indeed have cholera, but was lucky to just have a mild case and he possibly had some immunity from a previous episode.\n\nPettenkofer published his views on hygiene and disease in numerous books and papers; he was an editor of the \"Zeitschrift für Biologie\" (together with Carl von Voit) from 1865 to 1882, and of the \"Archiv für Hygiene\" from 1883 to 1894. In addition to his research publications he also gave a significant number of lectures to government officials in order to persuade them to provide funding for civic works and governmental oversight committees to promote and assess the state public health.\n\nThe 1899 handwritten manuscript 'On the self purification of rivers' and Pettenkofer's papers can be found at the archives of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.\n\nIn 1894 he retired from active work, and on 10 February 1901 he shot himself in a fit of depression. He died at his home in the Residenz in Munich. He is buried in the Alter Südfriedhof in Munich.\n\nDuring his lifetime he received numerous accolades. He was presented with the title of \"Honorary Citizen\" of Munich and given a gold medal. His work in hygiene precipitated the creation of the \"Pettenkofer Foundation for Research in Hygiene\" which received funding from the cities of Munich and Leipzig to fund research projects related to Hygiene and Public Health.\n\nIn 1883 he was awarded a hereditary title of nobility and was given the title \"Excellency.\" \n\nIn 1897 he was awarded the Harlen Medal from the British Institute of Public Health.\n\nMax Joseph von Pettenkofer's name features on the Frieze of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. Twenty-three pioneers of public health and tropical medicine were chosen to feature on the School's building when it was constructed in 1929.\n\n\n"}

It is owned and operated by Transport Canada, serving the South Okanagan, Similkameen and West Kootenay areas. Initial examination for the airport's construction began in 1937. The proposed locations were owned by the Penticton Indian Band at that time, but expropriated in 1949.\n\nTemporary public use of the Penticton Regional Airport was approved in 1945, and in 1956, it was given a permanent airport license. It has a runway aligned 16–34, and served approximately 80,000 passengers in 2011. The airport has: a restaurant, car rentals, Weather Office, Canada Customs, Forestry Air tanker base, Helicopter base, and administrative buildings. It has seen two accidents and incidents throughout its history.\n\nThe airport has three scheduled flights to the Vancouver International Airport every day, with one fewer on Sunday, provided by Air Canada Express. There is also a daily flight to the Calgary International Airport provided by WestJet Encore. Penticton Regional Airport terminal underwent an expansion in 2016 to add more departure seating. Car parking is available at the airport. cyyf.ca\n\nInitial examination for the construction of what would become Penticton Regional Airport began in 1937, at two locations. The proposed areas—west of Penticton's city centre and north of the Skaha Lake—were owned by the Penticton Indian Band. The land for the airport was expropriated from the band in 1939 under the War Measures Act, with the preliminary development of the airfield completed in 1941. Because of wartime military air transportation concerns, the airport acted as an emergency landing strip until its tarmac was completed. Rights for a temporary public use airport were secured in 1945 for an operation of 24 hours a day. In 1946, more land was acquired from the Penticton Indian Band for the airport's use.\n\nIn approximately 1942 the aerodrome was listed as RCAF & D of T Aerodrome - Penticton, British Columbia at with a variation of 24 degrees E and elevation of . The aerodrome was listed as \"Under construction - Serviceable\" with one runways as follows:\n\nTrans-Canada Air Lines, now known as Air Canada, and Canadian Pacific Air Lines served Penticton after World War II. In 1956, the airport was granted a permanent license, replacing the temporary permit. The airport's runway was extended in 1959, and a new terminal was built in 1963. In 1968, Canadian Pacific Air Lines extended its services for the airport, scheduling two daily flights, only to be taken over by Pacific Western Airlines the following year. However, in 1988, Canadian Airlines ended this service. That was replaced by Time Air and Air BC airlines; both airlines are no longer active.\n\nAn aviation centre was constructed at the airport in 1976, which included a 12-unit motel, flight training school, and aircraft overhaul shop; the latter is no longer maintained. Later, a helicopter flight and training club was established. In September 2007, Pacific Coastal Airlines began offering daily flights from this airfield to the Vancouver International Airport and Calgary International Airport for a period of twelve months. During this time, the airline served 22,000 passengers at the airport. It has been able to support emergency Boeing 747 landings since the 1970s, but this capability has never been tested; the runway has been used by Airbus 320s, Boeing 727-200s, Boeing 737-400s, Boeing 737-700s, and Cessna 150s.\n\nAccording to statistics, the South Okanagan region is underserved in terms of airports, owing to its population. The Kelowna International Airport provides international flights to 62 commercial destinations daily. South Okanagan is home to 79,475 people, totaling 25 percent of the Okanagan area as a whole. The air travel market of the local area consists of 210,000 passengers yearly. However, in 1990, the Penticton Regional Airport was considered to be the area's primary airport, hence why people questioned the need to expand the Kelowna International Airport at that time, when its runway was in the process of expansion.\n\nThe airport is located at on 3000 Airport Road in Penticton, southwest of city centre, situated off of Highway 97. It is located 73 kilometers (45 mi) north of the Canada–United States border, and opposite the Airport Beach attraction, which is a beach situated in the city. Paid parking, taxis and car rentals are available, but there is no bus service. Car rentals are provided by Budget Rent a Car and National Car Rental.\n\nFood and snacks are available at this airport's terminal, as well as a medical facility, accommodation areas and administrative buildings. There is a restaurant provided at the airport's terminal, Sky High Diner, as well as Canada Revenue Agency and Nav Canada offices. The airport's aircraft obtain their fuel from Spencer Aviation, which is located on site; Shell Canada serves as an aviation dealer for the Penticton Regional Airport. The airfield has a asphalt runway aligned 16–34. This facility maintains a management plan to keep geese off of their runways and properties.\n\nThe Penticton Flying Club operates at the airport, which is a club where children receive a flight in an airplane with the pilot, and learn about the airplanes themselves. In addition, the flight school Southern Skies Aviation is based on site; the school closed in 2011 and was reopened shortly after, when it was bought by Kittyhawk A/C Services. The former is also at the airport, serving as an aircraft maintenance centre. There is a radio navigation aid provided at the Penticton Regional Airport which is used by pilots on aircraft coming from other nearby airports to determine their location. The navigation system is owned by Nav Canada. The local and upcoming weather of Penticton is observed at this airport's weather station. Nav Canada has noted that most of the aircraft winds at the Penticton Regional Airport blow north and south.\n\nThe facility has been recognized as a certified airport by the British Columbia Ministry of Transportation. Transport Canada categorizes a certified airport through a process which ensures that it meets the safety criteria and provides flights to other destinations. Penticton Regional Airport is considered to be a port of entry that serves American fishermen coming to Canada. It has been classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada, and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency. The Penticton Regional Airport employs 247 persons, including its manager David Allen and maintenance workers.\n\nControversy has occurred over airport ownership before. When a transfer of ownership to the city of Penticton was planned, effective March 31, 1999, the Penticton Indian Band protested at the airfield on that same day; this forced three scheduled flights to be canceled. Members of the band stated that the land belonged to them, noted they would \"never relinquish claim to the airport lands\", and expected the airport's ownership to be transferred to them after World War I and World War II. They attempted to conceptualize a different agreement, but Transport Canada suggested the band's claims should be ignored, as it is not a proper government. In response, the Penticton Indian Band blocked road entrance to the airport, and terminal. Transport Canada later announced a six-week break from the ownership situation, and a runway-paving project was placed on hiatus. Based on a suggestion from the Penticton City Council, it was later decided that, if the Penticton Regional Airport be closed, the land may be returned to them, although Transport Canada was against this. , the airport is owned and operated by Transport Canada.\n\nPenticton Regional Airport has historically provided flights to several destinations, including Boeing Field—an international airport located in King County, Washington, that serves the Seattle and Tacoma areas—and the Kelowna International Airport.\n, it offers flights to the Vancouver International Airport, which are provided by Air Canada Express and operated by Jazz Air. These flights are provided three times daily, with the exception of Sunday, when two flights are available. On May 1, 2013, due to feedback from the public, an additional flight to the Vancouver International Airport offered by Air Canada Express was launched. In 2010, the airport garnered 34,946 aircraft movements, while in 2011, it served approximately 80,000 passengers.\n\nOver the years, there have been several attempts to increase destinations serviced from Penticton. And in 2012, local residents attracted the attention of WestJet. Efforts to woo WestJet included the airport being renamed \"WestJetville\" for a day in June 2012 and local residents created a flashmob video. So on October 26, 2014, WestJet operated by WestJet Encore flew its inaugural flight from the Calgary Airport to the Penticton Regional Airport and continues to fly once daily to and from Penticton. Discussion to expand the flight services provided by WestJet Encore from Penticton continue. However, due to insufficient airport safety-related maintenance, as a result of overgrowth disrupting the view of the runway lighting, WestJet cancelled several of their early morning, and late evening flights to and from the airport.\n\nOn December 22, 1950, a Douglas C-47 aircraft operated by Canadian Pacific Air Lines from Vancouver crashed into Okanagan Mountain, some north of Penticton. Later investigation reported that the aircraft was below the minimum altitude permissible through an instrument approach procedure, causing the beyond damageable crash. Two crew members of the 18 total occupants were fatally injured, the remainder survived.\n\nOn January 4, 1973, a Pacific Western Airlines Convair turboprop airliner preparing to take off from Vancouver, British Columbia, for a flight to Penticton with 18 people on board was hijacked by 26-year-old passenger Christopher Kenneth Nielson, who drew a gun and demanded $2 million in cash and to be flown to North Vietnam, threatening to blow up the airliner if his demands were not met. During negotiations at Vancouver International Airport, Nielson allowed the other 13 passengers and one crew member to disembark, leaving three crew members aboard the plane with him. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) then stormed the plane and arrested Nielson, finding that he was armed only with two toy guns. There were no fatalities in the incident.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2282356", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2282356", "title": "Le Monde d'Edena", "text": "Le Monde d'Edena\n\nLe Monde d'Edena (\"The World of Edena\", published in English as \"The Aedena Cycle\") is a series of graphic novels by French artist Jean \"Mœbius\" Giraud. It grew organically out of a promotional album Mœbius made for the French car manufacturer Citroën, called \"The Star\", in 1983.\n\nIn the initial story, Mœbius introduces two genderless protagonists, Stel and Atan, who crash on a barren planet and must traverse it in an old Citroën. They eventually stumble on a camp of interstellar refugees surrounding a mysterious pyramid, and are transported to an unknown world described as a 'Garden of Eden somewhere in another galaxy'.\n\nThe open ending of the Citroën story inspired Mœbius to wonder what would happen next. He plotted out three or four books' worth of stories that were also conceived as the basis of a coherent Mœbius universe, one which crossed over with other major works like \"The Airtight Garage\". In effect, a recurrent character in the series was \"Master [Maître in French] Burg\", Stel's dream guide who aided him in his quest on Edena, which was a palindrome of \"[Major] Grubert\", the main protagonist of \"The Airtight Garage\", and by Mœbius intended to be one and the same person.\n\nMœbius was strongly influenced by the teachings of Jean-Paul Appel-Guéry, whose commune on Tahiti he had joined with his family in the period 1983-1984, and Swiss nutritionist Guy-Claude Burger, as well as his own transient lifestyle (\"The Gardens of Edena\" was drawn in Tokyo and Los Angeles for example, and \"The Goddess\" was begun in France and completed in California, whereas \"Stel\" was begun in California and completed in France). Questions are posed about dreams, nutrition and health, biology and sexuality, the human desire to live in a structured society, and archetypal good and evil. All of these philosophical elements are organically embedded in deceptively 'light' stories. The two protagonists Stel and Atan for example, stemming from a highly industrialized civilization, (re)discover their human sexuality on Edena, brought on by the circumstance that they, cut off from that civilization, are forced to consume natural nutrition, with Atan in the process becoming \"Atana\".\n\nMœbius started out the series by restricting himself to a 'Clear Line' style (Ligne Claire), with minimal details, though in later outings, especially the short stories \"The Still Planet\" and \"The Repairmen\", his signature intricate Mœbius graphic style started to resurface, before returning to his original art style for the last outing in the main narrative, \"Sra\".\n\nWhile Mœbius has received a multitude of (international) awards for his body of work, this series did receive a specific one, the 1991 Spanish Haxtur Award of the Salón Internacional del Cómic del Principado de Asturias, for \"La Diosa\" (The Goddess) in the category \"Best Drawings\". Concurrently, the short story \"The Still Planet\", which, coming in at 25 pages, accounted for half the contents of the comic book \"Concrete Celebrates Earth Day 1990\" (52 pages, Dark Horse Comics, April 1990) in which it was first published, was instrumental in winning the 1991 Eisner Award for \"Best Single Issue\". Noteworthy was, that the story is created as a wordless comic, save for the title, with only the (highly detailed) art intended to tell the story. In this, Moebius repeated the experimental style utilized for the comic that had brought him international renown in the mid-1970s, \"Arzach\". Additionally, the story was under its French title \"La planète encore\" adapted into a French-produced animation short in 2010. Mœbius Production served as a production company, with wife Isabelle Giraud serving as one of its producers. Mœbius himself was one of the two directors of the short.\n\nThe series consists of five parts, each published as a separate volume, plus a sixth volume containing shorter stories \"Seeing Naples\", \"Another Planet\" (=\"The Still Planet\"), \"The Repairmen\" and \"Dying to See Naples\", that are outside of the main narrative:\n\nIn the English language, the series, translated by Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier, has seen publications between 1988 and 1994 by Marvel Comics (under its Epic imprint), Titan Books, Graphitti Designs, and, at a later point in time, by Dark Horse as well, the latter completing the main narrative in translation in 2016, with the short stories following suit in 2018. For particulars on these editions of the series, please refer to the main article.\n\nAll novels have been (re-)released or licensed to foreign publishers in whole or in part by Casterman, in many languages, including French (the original language), Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, Danish, Finnish, German, Dutch and Polish. Some (short) stories have seen serialized prepublication in Casterman's monthly magazine \"\"(À suivre)\"\", as well as in by Casterman licensed foreign comic magazines, but after the magazine went defunct in 1997, new additions were invariably directly released as comic albums.\n"}

His highest first-class score was 148, captaining Wellington against the Australians in 1966–67, out of a total of 365 for 7 on the first day.\n\nSinclair scored three of his six first-class centuries in Tests, though never played in a winning Test side. He captained New Zealand in three Tests (the Second and Third Tests against England in 1965–66, and the First Test against India in 1967–68) and also in the four-match series against the visiting Australian team in 1966–67 and on the brief tour to Australia in 1967–68. He retired from international cricket in 1968 to concentrate on work.\n\nHis highest Test score was 138 against South Africa in Auckland in 1963–64, made in 345 minutes out of a team total of only 263. It was the only century by either side in the three-Test series, and was at the time the highest Test score by a New Zealander in New Zealand. He took two Test wickets in ten overs, both against Pakistan in Lahore in 1964–65.\n\nBecause of his short stature he was sometimes targeted by opposing pace bowlers, but he learned how to handle short-pitched deliveries. He was a neat, tidy batsman notable for his cutting and on-drives. Christopher Martin-Jenkins described him thus: \"Fair-haired and one of the smallest cricketers ever to appear [for] New Zealand, Barry Sinclair was a sound and often fluent right-handed batsman with an indomitable spirit and an excellent field at cover.\"\n\nIn 2010 he was made the inaugural patron of the New Zealand Cricket Players’ Association. In 2015 he was voted a Legend of Wellington Sport.\n\nIn the 2016 Queen's Birthday Honours, Sinclair was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to cricket.\n\nBill Francis, \"In Pursuit of Excellence: The Barry Sinclair Story\", The Cricket Publishing Company, West Pennant Hills, NSW, 2016\n\n"}

The name dates far back into antiquity; it was Pedeme to the Meroitic inhabitants, and Primis to the Romans. The site has a long history of occupation, ranging from as early as the eighth century BCE to 1813 CE, and was an economic, political, and religious center. Originally it was a major city perched on a cliff above the Nile, but the flooding of Lake Nasser after the construction of the Aswan High Dam transformed it into an island and flooded its outskirts. Qasr Ibrim is the only major archaeological site in Lower Nubia to have survived the Nile floods. Both prior to and after the Nile floods, it has remained a major site for archaeological investigations.\n\nHuman habitation at the site dates from the Late Period of ancient Egypt, but it reached its greatest prominence in the Middle Ages, when the area was the home of the Eparch of Nobatia. Qasr Ibrim is the source of the largest collection of Old Nubian documents ever found, including the records of the Eparch. The site was occupied until 1813, when the last occupants were driven out by artillery fire. Today the island is closed to all but archaeologists.\nEgypt's influence in Nubia began around 2,000 BCE, when Egyptian invaded and claimed sovereignty over the area. Many Egyptian artifacts and evidence of Egyptian architecture have been found at Qasr Ibrim. The earliest inscription at the site is a stela, a stone or wooden slab, from the reign of Amenhotep I. The stela was found in a now-ruined Christian Byzantine cathedral at Qasr Ibrim where it had been reused in one of the church's crypts. The stela is now located in the British Museum.\n\nThe site was partly rebuilt \"under the prefecture of Gaius Petronius during Augustus' reign.\" Qasr Ibrim played a key role in Rome's defense of the Aswan region, and was likely held until 100 CE or later. The fortress, constructed by Roman military engineers, was the strongest in the Nile Valley at this time.\n\nDuring Roman times the town was one of the last bastions of paganism, its six temples converting to Christianity two centuries later than the rest of Egypt. It then became one of the main Christian centers in Lower Nubia. Christianity first came to Qasr Ibrim in the 6th century, but had little effect. It wasn't until the city became part of the kingdom of Makuria, in the early 8th century, that Qasr Ibrim became a center for Christianity. This continued even through the fifteenth century when the Makurian kingdom became Islamic. The city held out against Islam until the 16th century, when a unit of Bosnian soldiers, part of the Ottoman army, occupied the site. The Bosnian soldiers stayed on and eventually married into the local Nubian community, using part of the cathedral as a mosque.\n\nTwo churches remain on the site. The Taharqa Church was most likely built between 542-580 CE, this would make it one of Nubia's earliest churches. Like many of the first churches in Nubia, it would have been constructed within the walls of the already present temples. Qasr Ibrim's cathedral was built later, though the date of construction in unclear. Archaeologists currently believe it was constructed in the first half of the eighth century.\n\nThe site was first excavated by David Randall-MacIver and C. Leonard Woolley for the Eckley B. Coxe Expedition for the University of Pennsylvania in 1911. In 1963, excavations were started by the Egyptian Exploration Society and have continued periodically to the present day. Cemeteries found east and west of the main settlement were excavated in 1932 and 1961. There are still areas around the complex that have yet to be excavated, although some sites, including those near the river, were destroyed in floods caused by the Aswan Dam.\n\nThe almost rainless conditions of the area have created excellent preservation of organic materials. Pottery dated to the post-Meroitic period (350-600 CE) shows evidence of both date palm and doum palm residues. Various samples of sorghum dating from between 800 BCE to 1800 CE have also been found at Qasr Ibrim. There are four forms of sorghum that are found on the site. From when the site was settled until around 100 CE only wild sorghum can be found. From 100 CE until around 1500 CE an early form of cultivated sorghum (\"Sorghum bicolor\", ssp. \"bicolor\", race Bicolor) is found. Around 1200 CE an advanced form of sorghum (\"Sorghum bicolor\", ssp. \"bicolor\", race Durra) appears. Between the 5th and 7th centuries CE a transitional race is also present.\n\nThere are believed to be three phases of agricultural history, the Napatan occupation, the Roman occupation, and the Meroitic periods. Listed below are the main crops that have been identified in each phase:\n\nNapatan (mid 8th-mid 7th century BCE):\n\nRoman (25 BCE-mid 1st century CE):\n\nMeroitic (100-300 CE):\n\nThe site has also revealed many archaeozoological remains, though they have not been as heavily studied as the botanical remains. Evidence of a heavily sheep and goat based economy has been found, along with large numbers of juvenile cattle. These cattle remains suggest a meat- and milk-based economy. The cattle could also have been used for religious ceremonies at the Meroitic Temple. The ritually-deposited remains of a domesticated chicken were also found below a house floor, and date to the post-Meroitic period (late 5th to early 6th centuries CE). \n\nQasr Ibrim is known not only for its organic remains, textiles have also been found at the site. During the Roman occupation of the site sandals, textiles, and leather fragments were left behind. Woolen fabrics are believed to have brought to Qasr Ibrim in 23 BCE by the Romans. Cotton fabrics were not introduced until the first century CE by the Meroitic peoples. The un-dyed Meroitic fabrics differ from the wool of the Romans, which has been found in blues and other bright colors.\n\nThe conditions at Qasr Ibrim have also preserved a large number of documents, including Greek, Arabic, Coptic and Nubian. Earlier documents were written on papyrus, though parchment was the preferred material for sacred texts. Paper was not common writing material in Nubia until the twelfth century. The nature of the documents range from a variety of religious and secular texts, including personal letters, and religious documents. These documents show the significance of Qasr Ibrim as a frontier society, and the importance of a vast trade network.\n\n"}

The first fortress was built in 1323. It was the scene of many conflicts between Russia and Sweden and changed hands between the two empires. During World War II, it was heavily damaged. Today it is part of the UNESCO World Heritage site Historic Centre of Saint Petersburg and Related Groups of Monuments. \n\nA wooden fortress named Oreshek () or Orekhov () was built by Grand Prince Yury of Moscow (in his capacity as Prince of Novgorod) on behalf of the Novgorod Republic in 1323. It guarded the northern approaches to Novgorod and access to the Baltic Sea. The fortress is situated on Orekhovets Island whose name refers to nuts in Swedish as well as in Finnish (\"Pähkinäsaari\", \"Nut Island\") and Russian languages.\n\nAfter a series of conflicts, a peace treaty was signed at Oreshek on August 12, 1323 between Sweden and Grand Prince Yury and the Novgorod Republic. This was the first agreement on the border between Eastern and Western Christianity running through present-day Finland. A modern stone monument to the north of the Church of St. John in the fortress commemorates the treaty. In 1333 Novgorodians invited Lithuanian prince Narimantas to govern their north-western domain. Narimantas appointed his son, Alexander Narimuntovich to rule the autonomous Principality of Oreshek. \n\nIn 1348 king Magnus Eriksson attacked and briefly took the fortress during his crusade in the region in 1348–1352. It was largely ruined by the time the Novgorodians retook the fortress in 1351. The fortress was rebuilt in stone in 1352, by Archbishop Vasily Kalika of Novgorod (1330–1352), who, according to the Novgorod First Chronicle, was sent by the Novgorodians after several Russian and Lithuanian princes ignored the city's pleas to help them rebuild and defend the fort. The remnants of the walls of 1352 were excavated in 1969, and can be seen just north of the Church of St. John in the center of the present fortress.\n\nIn 1478 the Novgorod Republic was absorbed by the Muscovy who immediately started to strengthen their border with Sweden. The existing small citadel was demolished and a new stone fortress with seven towers was constructed, which occupied almost the complete island. The old Novgorodian basement was used to construct a new citadel with three towers inside the outer walls. The total length of the walls was about 740 meters. Their height up to 12 meters, and the width at the basement 4.5 meters; The towers were 14-16 meters high and 16 meters in diameter at the basement. This made it the strongest Russian fortress of that period. The residents were forced to resettle on the mainland and most preferred the Southern bank of Neva for safety reasons.\n\nIn 1554-1555, during the Russo-Swedish war, The Swedes laid siege to the fortress, with no success. In response, Muscovites besieged Vyborg, with no success either.\n\nDuring the Livonian war, in 1582 Swedish troops led by Pontus De La Gardie almost captured the fortress. After a row of artillery fire they managed to break into one of the towers, but were later repelled by Muscovites.\n\nThe fort was captured by Sweden in 1611 during the Ingrian War after nine months of siege, when the defenders lost every 9 men of 10. As part of the Swedish Empire, the fortress was known as Nöteborg (\"Nut-fortress\") in Swedish or Pähkinälinna in Finnish, and became the center of the north-Ingrian Nöteborg county (slottslän). During that time very little was done to maintain the fortress in good order, and the experts coming to Nöteborg to do inspections warned the crown of its deterioration. \n\nDuring the Ingrian Campaign of tsar Alexei Mikhailovich in June 1656 the fortress came under a siege by voevoda Potyomkin which lasted until November 1656 with no success.\n\nIn 1702, during the Great Northern War, the fortress was taken by Russians under Peter the Great in an amphibious assault: 440 Swedish soldiers defended the fort for ten days before surrendering. After heavy artillery fire and 13 hours of fighting inside the fortress, the Swedish commandant finally agreed to capitulate on honorable conditions. The Swedes left the fortress with their flags, rifles and four cannons. The Russian forces numbered 12,500 men and sustained a total of 1,500 casualties, compared to 360 for the Swedes.{see Siege of Nöteborg (1702)}. \n\nPeter renamed the fortress to Shlisselburg, a transliteration into the Cyrillic alphabet of Schlüsselburg. The name, meaning \"Key-fortress\" in German, which refers to Peter's perception of the fortress as the \"key to Ingria\".\n\nDuring Imperial times the fortress lost its military role and was used as a notorious political prison. Among its famous prisoners were Wilhelm Küchelbecker, Mikhail Bakunin and, for thirty-eight years, Walerian Łukasiński. Ivan VI was murdered in the fortress in 1764, and Lenin's brother, Aleksandr Ulyanov, was hanged there as well. The prison's buildings and former occupants were described in some detail in I. P. Youvatshev's \"The Russian Bastille or the Schuesselburg Fortress\" (1909) it being informally known as the \"Russian Bastille\"\".\" It is said that immediately after the Russian Revolution of 1917 the prisoners, both political and criminal, were released, and set the prison on fire, but according to Youvatshev the prison had been abolished in 1905.\n\nIn 1928 the fortress was turned into a branch of the Museum of the October Revolution, but in 1939, shortly before the war, it was closed and the exhibits were moved to Leningrad. \n\nShortly before Shlisselburg was occupied by the German troops (8 September 1941), a garrison of 350 Red Army soldiers was sent to the fortress on Orekhovets island to bring supplies and munition to the frontline. The garrison held the abandoned castle for 500 days preventing the Germans from landing there and cutting the last transit route from Leningrad to the mainland. Food and supplies were brought from the northern bank of the Neva which remained under Soviet control. Heavy artillery fire by the Germans destroyed all the buildings inside the fortress and part of the outer towers and walls, but despite numerous attempts the fortress was not captured. During Operation Iskra (18 January 1943) the siege of the fortress was lifted.\n\nThe war completely devastated the fortress. Out of the original ten towers, the fortress retains only six (five Russian and one Swedish). The remains of a church inside the fortress were transformed into a memorial to the fortress's defenders. An archaeological site was established in the fortress during 1968-1975 that excavated what remained from the ancient Novgorodian stone fort dated 1352 and other artifacts. The fortress has been the site of an annual rock concert since 2003. There is also a museum of political prisoners of the Russian Empire and a small collection of World War II artillery. Renovation of the walls and towers is slow, although still underway. A stone monument in memory of the first Russo-Swedish peace treaty (1323) was placed inside the fortress.\n\nTourists can reach the island from May to October via Shlisselburg or from the Northern bank of Neva, via Petrokrepost' railway station with regular ferries that run every 10-15 minutes.\n"}

He was also a recording artist with several hits on the RCA label in the 1960s.\n\nCampbell studied art at Mars Hill College in Mars Hill, North Carolina, after which he began a radio career at WNOX in Knoxville. After a year alongside Roy Acuff on their \"Mid-Day Merry-Go-Round\", he relocated to WDOD in Chattanooga, where he stayed until joining the United States Navy in 1941. At the end of World War II, Campbell returned to WNOX. He left that station for rival WROL where he helped start Knoxville's first country music television show (on WROL-TV), \"Country Playhouse\", that premiered in 1952 and ran until 1958.\n\nAt the close of that show, he moved to Nashville to replace Rod Brasfield on the nationally syndicated Prince Albert segment of the Grand Ole Opry. Shortly after, he signed a contract with RCA Victor and one of his early singles, \"Trouble in the Amen Corner\" reached the 1960 country music Top 25. After an unsuccessful stint with the Starday label, Campbell returned to RCA in 1966 and had three Top 30 singles: \"The Men in My Little Girl's Life\" (1966), \"The Dark End of the Street\" (1968), and \"Tell It Like It Is\" (1968). He was named \"Comedian of the Year\" in 1969 by the Country Music Association.\n\nOne of Campbell's 'signature' routines was to tell stories in \"Spoonerism\" form, with the first letters of words in some phrases intentionally switched for comic effect. The best-known of these stories was \"RinderCella,\" his re-telling of the fairy tale \"Cinderella,\" about the girl who \"slopped her dripper\" (dropped her slipper). Campbell once told the \"RinderCella\" story on an episode of the game show \"Juvenile Jury.\" At the conclusion of the story, host Jack Barry said \"That's one of the funniest stories Carchie Ampbell tells.\" All of Campbell's spoonerism routines borrowed heavily from comedy routines performed by Colonel Stoopnagle on the radio show \"Stoopnagle and Budd\" in the 1930s. (\"Colonel Stoopnagle\" was the stage name of F. Chase Taylor, 1897–1950.)\n\nCampbell also performed a routine with various partners generally known as \"That's Bad/That's Good.\" Campbell would state a troublesome occurrence; when the partner would sympathize by saying, \"Oh that's bad,\" Campbell would quickly counter, \"No, that's good!\", and then state a good result from the previous occurrence. When the partner would say, \"Oh that's good!\", Campbell would immediately counter with \"No, that's bad!\" and tell the new result, and so on.\n\nCampbell was a charter member of the cast of \"Hee Haw\" on CBS-TV from its beginning in 1969, though he also served as a head writer. His regular characterizations included:\n\nOne of his most well-known segments was the song \"PFFT! You Was Gone\", in which he would perform a short verse of original comedy followed by the standard chorus of \"Where oh where are you tonight\", which would conclude with him and a singing partner, often Gordie Tapp, blowing a raspberry at one another or at the camera. In later years, Tapp would be replaced by the episode's guest star, who was mentioned in Campbell's lyrics right before they revealed themselves.\n\nCampbell also recorded several comedy-music albums, which he continued doing during his \"Hee Haw\" years. such as \"Bull Session at Bull's Creek\" with Junior Samples, released the year before \"Hee Haw\" premiered. He frequently performed musical duets with singer Lorene Mann.\n\nIn 1984, Campbell hosted TNN's \"Yesteryear\" interview show. Campbell was an accomplished amateur golfer and built one of the earliest lighted golf courses in the United States. An avid painter, he also owned an art gallery and served on the school board in Knoxville, where he lived until he suffered a fatal heart attack in 1987. He is buried near the town of Powell, Tennessee.\n\nCampbell's childhood home on Main Street in Bull's Gap, Tennessee has been preserved as a memorial, and has been expanded into a \"tourism complex and museum\" which hosts annual \"Archie Campbell Days\" each September.\n\nFollowing Campbell's death, U.S. Highway 11E through Bulls Gap was renamed \"Archie Campbell Highway\" in his memory.\n\n"}

She was the third of the famous Lennox Sisters, and was notable among them for leading a wholly uncontroversial life filled with good works.\n\nBorn Lady Louisa Augusta Lennox, she was the third of the four Lennox sisters portrayed in Stella Tillyard's book \"Aristocrats: Caroline, Emily, Louisa, and Sarah Lennox\" and in the BBC television series based on it. The Lennox sisters were daughters of Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond and Lady Sarah Cadogan. The 2nd duke's father, the first duke, was an illegitimate son of King Charles II of England. \n\nLouisa was still a child when her parents died within a year of each other in 1750 and 1751. After this, Lady Louisa was brought up by her much older sister Emily FitzGerald, Duchess of Leinster, in Kildare. In 1758, aged 15, she married Thomas Conolly (1738-1803), grand-nephew of William Conolly, Speaker of the Irish House of Commons. Her husband, a wealthy land-owner and keen horseman, was also a successful politician who was elected to Parliament as early as 1759. The couple lived in the Palladian mansion Castletown House in County Kildare, the decoration of which she directed throughout the 1760s and 1770s. The Conolly summer residence 'Cliff House' on the banks of the River Erne between Belleek, County Fermanagh and Ballyshannon County Donegal was demolished as part of the Erne Hydroelectric scheme, which constructed the Cliff and Cathaleen's Fall hydroelectric power stations. Cliff hydroelectric power station was constructed on the site of 'Cliff House' and was commissioned in 1950. \n\nThemselves unhappily childless, at that point they took up the welfare of young children from disadvantaged backgrounds as a lifelong project, contributing both money and effort towards initiatives which would enable foundlings and vagabonds to acquire productive skills and support themselves. They developed one of the first Industrial Schools where boys learnt trades, and Lady Louisa took active personal interest in mentoring the students. In middle age, Lady Louisa also virtually adopted her niece Emily Napier (1783-1863), the daughter of her sister Lady Sarah Lennox. Emily, who would spend long months with her aunt in Kildare, married Sir Henry Bunbury, 7th Baronet, and moved to Suffolk, although she remained close to her aunt until her death.\n\nThomas Conolly died in 1803. Upon his death, the major part of his estates, which included Wentworth Castle, passed to a distant relative, Frederick Vernon. Lady Louisa received the Castletown House and estate, as also certain liquid investments and valuable urban properties, which enabled her to live in comfort and continue her activities until her own death in 1821. She willed these substantial properties to a great-nephew, Edward Michael Pakenham (grandson of Thomas' sister Harriet), later the MP for Donegal, \n\n\nIn 1999, a 6-part miniseries based on the lives of Louisa Lennox and her sisters aired in the U.K. It was called Aristocrats (TV mini-series). \n\n"}

In this episode, people's personal thoughts and fantasies begin to manifest right before their eyes. \nQuark advises Constable Odo to lighten up, perhaps in a holosuite. Odo dismisses imagination as inattention to real life. Quark offers to create for him a shapeshifter \"playmate\", to which Odo retorts, \"You're disgusting!\" Seeing the station commander's young son, Jake Sisko, approaching a holosuite, Odo warns Quark he had better not have created any \"playmates\" for him. Quark explains that Jake's program includes famous baseball players from Earth.\n\nDr. Julian Bashir and Lt. Jadzia Dax eat lunch. Julian wants a romantic relationship, but Jadzia politely refuses, pointing out he has also eyed other women. Dax returns to Ops, from where she observes elevated emissions in the nearby Denorius Belt. She and Commander Sisko hypothesize this to be due to the high amount of traffic at Deep Space Nine.\n\nChief O'Brien reads to his daughter Molly the story \"Rumpelstiltskin\" and tucks her into bed.

He instructs his crew that it does not exist, and to stand down from alert status. The crisis is averted. Later, \"Buck Bokai\" appears in Sisko's office, where he explains that he is part of an extended mission of exploration that followed a ship through the Wormhole. His people wanted to see what imagination is really about, in order to learn more about humanoids. The aliens did nothing themselves: they only observed the effects of humanoid imagination. Before leaving, he suggests they may one day return.\n\nThe plot of the script evolved from its original draft when Michael Piller - co-creator of \"\" - wanted to differentiate the episode from a \"\" installment where a holosuite character comes to life, as such 'imagination' became the central theme of the episode. Another modification to the original script came from Colm Meaney's objection to the use of a Leprechaun due to, in his view, the negative connotations and stereotyping of Irish people. This influenced Piller to use the folk character Rumpelstiltskin instead, which during the re-write became the starting point of the new 'imagination' based story line for the episode.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2282400", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2282400", "title": "Highness", "text": "Highness\n\nHighness (abbreviation \"HH\", oral address \"Your Highness\") is a formal style used to address (in second person) or refer to (in third person) certain members of a reigning or formerly reigning dynasty. It is typically used with a possessive adjective: \"His Highness\", \"Her Highness\" (HH), \"Their Highnesses\", etc. Although often combined with other adjectives of honour indicating rank, such as \"Imperial\", \"Royal\" or \"Serene\", it may be used alone.\n\"Highness\" is, both literally and figuratively, the quality of being lofty or above. It is used as a term to evoke dignity or honour, and to acknowledge the exalted rank of the person so described.\n\nAbstract styles arose in profusion in the Roman Empire, especially in the Byzantine. Styles were attached to various offices at court or in the state. In the early Middle Ages such styles, couched in the second or third person, were uncertain and much more arbitrary, and were more subject to the fancies of secretaries than in later times.\n\nIn English usage, the terms Highness, Grace and Majesty, were all used as honorific styles of kings, queens and princes of the blood until the time of James I of England. Thus in documents relating to the reign of Henry VIII of England, all three styles are used indiscriminately; an example is the king's judgment against Dr. Edward Crome (d. 1562), quoted, from the Lord Chamberlains' books, ser. I, p. 791, in Trans. Roy. Hist. Soc. N.S. lOX. 299, where article 15 begins with \"Also the Kinges Highness hath ordered\", 16 with \"Kinges Majestie\", and 17 with \"Kinges Grace\". In the Dedication of the Authorized Version of the Bible of 1611, James I is still styled Majesty and Highness; thus, in the first paragraph: \"the appearance of Your Majesty, as of the Sun in his strength, instantly dispelled those supposed and surmised mists ... especially when we beheld the government established in Your Highness and Your hopeful Seed, by an undoubted title\". It was, however, in James I's reign that Majesty became the official style.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Congress of Vienna in 1815, His/Her Highness (abbreviated HH), became prevalent for reigning dukes and members of their dynasties in Germany (e.g. Anhalt, Brunswick, Nassau, the three Ernestine duchies of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Saxe-Meiningen, and Saxe-Altenburg, as well as Schleswig-Holstein); for cadets of some German grand ducal houses (e.g., Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Oldenburg, Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach); and cadet members of some imperial or royal families (e.g., Russia, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Prussia, Yugoslavia). That custom remains official in the Danish, Dutch and Norwegian dynasties. The \"Almanach de Gotha\" and Burke's Peerage continued to ascribe \"Highness\" to members of deposed dynasties of ducal rank.\n\nAmong the nobility, the \"Almanach de Gotha\" notes that \"Highness\" was accorded to the heads of the families of House of Murat (a royal dynasty during the Napoleonic era), Hohenberg and all members of the House of Ligne.\n\nExample of official holders of the style \"Highness\":\n\nUsually members of an imperial or royal dynasty are addressed as Imperial Highness or Royal Highness (French \"Altesse Impériale, Altesse Royale\"; German \"Kaiserliche Hoheit, Königliche Hoheit\"; Spanish \"Alteza Imperial, Alteza Real\", etc.) respectively.\nGrand Ducal Highness was the treatment accorded cadet princes of those families of ruling grand dukes who did not simply use \"Highness\", \"viz.\" Baden, Hesse-Cassel, Hesse and by Rhine and Luxembourg.\n\nWhile \"Highness\" (\"Hoheit\") was used for rulers of German duchies, the sovereign Dukes of Modena and of Parma were heads of cadet branches of ruling dynasties of higher rank. They and their cadets therefore used the imperial or royal styles borne by members of those houses, respectively the royal House of Bourbon and the imperial House of Habsburg-Lorraine.\nIn modern times Serene Highness (\"Altesse Sérénissime\") is used as the equivalent of the German \"Durchlaucht\". In the 17th century it became the general style borne by the heads of the reigning princely states of the Holy Roman Empire (\"reichsständische Fürsten\"), as \"Illustrious Highness (\"Erlaucht\") became customary for those of the comital houses (\"reichsständische Grafen\", i.e. Counts of the Empire). In 1825 the Imperial German Diet agreed to grant the style \"Durchlaucht\" to the heads of all mediatized princely houses domiciled in Germany elevated to the rank of \"Fürst\" are also styled Durchlaucht. In 1829 the style of Erlaucht, which had formerly been borne by the reigning Counts of the empire, was similarly granted to the mediatized countly families (Almanach de Gotha, 1909, 107).\n\n\"Highness\" was the style accorded to princes of the British Royal Family who were the male-line great-grandchildren of a British sovereign (and the wives/widows of great-grandsons), except the eldest son of the Prince of Wales. In 1917 George V revoked authorization for use of that style.\n\nThe children and grandchildren in the male-line of a British sovereign were and are addressed as Royal Highness (His or Her Royal Highness, abbreviated \"HRH\"), as are the children of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales (decree of 31 May 1898). The sovereign has the right as a legal \"fons honorum\" to grant or revoke use of the style of Highness, as with other styles, titles and honours.\n\n\nVery rarely, the style of \"Highness\" or variations thereof have been used by non-monarchical heads of state, particularly before the 20th century, and often in cases where the distinction between monarchy and republic was blurred. For example, Oliver Cromwell and his wife were styled \"Highness\" upon his elevation to Lord Protector of the Commonwealth; he also enjoyed the style of \"by the Grace of God\", was succeeded by his son, and had even been offered the throne.\n\nIn the Spanish-speaking world, a handful of leaders historically enjoyed the official, if often ephemeral, style of \"Highness\" (Alteza) or variations thereof.\n\nIn Spain, Manuel Godoy, who twice served as Prime Minister from 1792 to 1797 and from 1801 to 1808, was granted the style of \"Most Serene Highness\" (Su Alteza Serenísima) in 1807 by King Charles IV. He had been created \"Principe de la Paz\" (\"Prince of the Peace\") in 1795, but the princely title did not carry the style of \"Highness\" on its own. The former style was possibly derived from the traditional Spanish honorific of \"Excelentísimo Señor\" (The Most Excellent).\n\nBaldomero Espartero, Prince of Vergara, who was regent for Queen Isabella II from 1840 to 1843, and three times served as Prime Minister: in 1837, from 1840 to 1841, and from 1854 to 1856, was created Prince of Vergara in 1872. Espartero had previously declined an offer to the throne following the Spanish Revolution of 1868, which instead went to the Italian Amadeo of Savoy, who in turn bestowed the royal princedom on him.\n\nFurthermore, according to the provisions of Royal Decree 1368/1987 promulgated by King Juan Carlos I in 1987, a Regent of Spain is to enjoy the style of \"Highness\" (as well as protocolary honours equal to those of the Prince of Asturias), unless they were to possess rank conferring a higher style.\n\nDuring the short-lived \"\" uprising of 1809 in modern-day Ecuador, the \"Junta de Gobierno Autónoma de Quito\" (\"Autonomous Government Junta of [the Royal Audiencia of] Quito\"), granted its President, Juan Pío de Montúfar, 2nd Marquis of Selva Alegre, the style of \"Most Serene Highness\", while claiming for itself the collective dignity of \"\"Majesty\"\" (as it purported to be acting in the name of King Ferdinand VII). Selva Alegre's pseudo-monarchical government, which was formed following Napoleon's invasion of Spain in 1808 and lasted for a mere seventy-five days, was considered by both contemporaries and later historians to be a thinly-disguised effort to establish a \"Kingdom of Quito\"; Selva dressed himself in regal vestments, bestowed honours on citizens, and instituted the National Order of San Lorenzo (which was much later revived by Ecuadorian President Camilo Ponce Enríquez in 1959).\n\nAntonio López de Santa Anna, enjoyed the official style of \"Most Serene Highness\" during his eleventh and final tenure as President of Mexico for life from 1853 until his deposal in 1855.\n\nShortly before the inauguration of George Washington as the first President of the United States, then-Vice President John Adams organised a Congressional committee on the matter of the title and style of the President. There Adams agitated for the adoption of the style of \"Highness\" (as well as the title of \"Protector of Their [the United States'] Liberties\") for the President. Others favored the variant of \"Electoral Highness\" or the lesser \"Excellency\", the latter of which was vociferously opposed by Adams, who contended that it was far beneath the presidential dignity, as the executives of the states, some of which were also titled \"President\" (e.g. the President of Pennsylvania), at that time often enjoyed the style of \"Excellency\"; Adams said that the President \"would be levelled with colonial governors or with functionaries from German princedoms\" if he were to use the style of \"Excellency\". On further consideration, Adams deemed even \"Highness\" insufficient and instead proposed that the Executive, both the President and the Vice President (i.e., himself), be styled \"Majesty\", with only which the \"great danger\" of insufficient dignity being attached to the executive could be solved. Adams' efforts were met with widespread derision and perplexion; Thomas Jefferson called them \"the most superlatively ridiculous thing I ever heard of\", while Benjamin Franklin considered it \"absolutely mad\". The proposal came to naught, and American Presidents, from Washington onwards, have eschewed honorific titles and styles altogether and are simply referred to as \"Mr. President\".\n\nIn modern-day Samoa, the O le Ao o le Malo, the Samoan head of state, has since the country's independence enjoyed the title of \"Highness\", as do the heads of the four paramount chiefly dynasties. However, as all of the heads of state, elected by the \"Fono\", the country's parliament (which is itself almost entirely composed of customary chiefs), since independence have been one of the four chiefs, it is ambiguous as to whether the country constitutes a parliamentary republic or a democratic elective monarchy.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, all members of the royal family have the title of Emir (Prince) but sons, daughters, patrilineal granddaughters and grandsons of Ibn Saud are referred to by the style \"His Royal Highness\" (HRH), differing from those belonging to the cadet branches who are styled as \"His/Her Highness\" (HH), and in addition to that a reigning king has the title of Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques.\n\nEmirs of Qatar, Kuwait and UAE also use the style of Your Highness.\n\nAfrican royalty commonly use \"Highness\" to refer to their junior dynasts. Some ranking monarchs also make use of the style. An example of the former is Princess Elizabeth Bagaya of the Tooro Kingdom in Uganda. An example of the latter is the princess' sister-in-law, Queen Best Kemigisa.\n\nRegardless of the official traditions in the various colonial empires, the style is evidently used to render, often merely informally, various somewhat analogous titles in non-western cultures, regardless whether there is an actual linguistic and/or historical link. Furthermore, in North America, some chiefs of certain indigenous tribes or nations use the style of Highness, which may or may not be recognised by their governments.\n\nThe Aga Khan was granted the style of \"His Highness\" by Elizabeth II, Queen of the United Kingdom in 1957 upon the death of his grandfather Aga Khan III. This has been a traditional gesture by British sovereigns since the Aga Khan III allied himself with Britain against Afghanistan.\n\nWhile the actual precedence depends on the rank itself, and sometimes more specifically on the monarchy, rather than on the style of address, the holders tend to end up roughly in the following order of precedence:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2282404", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2282404", "title": "Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India", "text": "Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India\n\nThe Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles of State Policy and Fundamental Duties are sections of the Constitution of India that prescribe the fundamental obligations of the states to its citizens and the duties and the rights of the citizens to the State. These sections comprise a constitutional bill of rights for government policy-making and the behaviour and conduct of citizens. These sections are considered vital elements of the constitution, which was developed between 1947 and 1949 by the Constituent Assembly of India.\n\nThe \"Fundamental Rights\" are defined as the basic human rights of all citizens. These rights, defined in Part III of the Constitution, applied irrespective of race, place of birth, religion, caste, creed, or gender. They are enforceable by the courts, subject to specific restrictions. The \"Directive Principles of State Policy\" are guidelines for the framing of laws by the government. These provisions, set out in Part IV of the Constitution, are not enforceable by the courts, but the principles on which they are based are fundamental guidelines for governance that the State is expected to apply in framing policies and passing laws.\n\nThe \"Fundamental Duties'\n\" are defined as the moral obligations of all citizens to help promote a spirit of patriotism and to uphold the unity of India. These duties set out in Part IV–A of the Constitution, concern individuals and the nation. Like the Directive Principles, they are not enforceable by courts unless otherwise made enforceable by parliamentary law.\n\nThe Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles had their origins in the Indian independence movement, which strove to achieve the values of liberty and social welfare as the goals of an independent Indian state. The development of constitutional rights in India was inspired by historical documents such as England's Bill of Rights, the United States Bill of Rights and France's Declaration of the Rights of Man. The demand for civil liberties formed an important part of the Indian independence movement, with one of the objectives of the Indian National Congress (INC) being to end discrimination between the British rulers and their Indian subjects. This demand was explicitly mentioned in resolutions adopted by the INC between 1917 and 1919. The demands articulated in these resolutions included granting to Indians the rights to equality before the law, free speech, trial by juries composed at least half of Indian members, political power, and equal terms for bearing arms as British citizens.\n\nThe experiences of the Second World War, the unsatisfactory Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms of 1919, and the rise to prominence of M. K. Gandhi in the Indian independence movement marked a change in the attitude of its leaders towards articulating demands for civil rights. The focus shifted from demanding equality of status between Indians and the British to assuring liberty for all Indians. The Commonwealth of India Bill, drafted by Annie Beasant in 1925, specifically included demands for seven fundamental rights – individual liberty, freedom of conscience, free expression of opinion, freedom of assembly, non-discrimination on the ground of sex, free elementary education and free use of public spaces. In 1927, the INC resolved to set up a committee to draft a \"Swaraj Constitution\" for India based on a declaration of rights that would provide safeguards against oppression. The 11-member committee, led by Motilal Nehru, was constituted in 1928. Its report made a number of recommendations, including proposing guaranteed fundamental rights to all Indians. These rights resembled those of the American Constitution and those adopted by post-war European countries, and several of them were adopted from the 1925 Bill. Several of these provisions were later replicated in various parts of the Indian Constitution, including the Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles.\n\nIn 1931, the Indian National Congress, at its Karachi session, adopted a resolution committing itself to the defence of civil rights and economic freedom, with the stated objectives of putting an end to exploitation, providing social security and implementing land reforms. Other new rights proposed by the resolution were the prohibition of State titles, universal adult franchise, the abolition of capital punishment and freedom of movement. Drafted by Jawaharlal Nehru, the resolution, which later formed the basis for some of the Directive Principles, placed the primary responsibility of carrying out social reform on the State, and marked the increasing influence of socialism and Gandhian philosophy on the independence movement. The final phase of the Independence movement saw a reiteration of the socialist principles of the 1930s, along with an increased focus on minority rights – which had become an issue of major political concern by then – which were published in the Sapru Report in 1945. The report, apart from stressing on protecting the rights of minorities, also sought to prescribe a \"standard of conduct for the legislatures, government and the courts\".\n\nDuring the final stages of the British Raj, the 1946 Cabinet Mission to India proposed a Constituent Assembly to draft a Constitution for India as part of the process of transfer of power. The Constituent Assembly of India, composed of indirectly elected representatives from the British provinces and Princely states, commenced its proceedings in December 1946, and completed drafting the Constitution of India by November 1949. According to the Cabinet Mission plan, the Assembly was to have an Advisory Committee to advise it on the nature and extent of fundamental rights, protection of minorities and administration of tribal areas. Accordingly, the Advisory Committee was constituted in January 1947 with 64 members, and from among these a twelve-member sub-committee on Fundamental Rights was appointed under the chairmanship of J. B. Kripalani in February 1947. The sub-committee drafted the Fundamental Rights and submitted its report to the Committee by April 1947, and later that month the Committee placed it before the Assembly, which debated and discussed the rights over the course of the following year, adopting the drafts of most of them by, December 1948. The drafting of the Fundamental Rights was influenced by the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the U.N. General Assembly and the activities of the United Nations Human Rights Commission, as well as decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court in interpreting the Bill of Rights in the American Constitution. The Directive Principles, which were also drafted by the sub-committee on Fundamental Rights, expounded the socialist precepts of the Indian independence movement, and were inspired by similar principles contained in the Irish Constitution. The Fundamental Duties were later added to the Constitution by the 42nd Amendment in 1976.\n\nThe Fundamental Rights, embodied in Part III of the Constitution, guarantee civil rights to all Indians, and prevent the State from encroaching an individual's liberty while simultaneously placing upon it an obligation to protect the citizens' rights from encroachment by society. Seven fundamental rights were originally provided by the Constitution – the right to equality, right to freedom, right against exploitation, right to freedom of religion, cultural and educational rights, right to property and right to constitutional remedies. However, the right to property was removed from Part III of the Constitution by the 44th Amendment in 1978.\n\nThe purpose of the Fundamental Rights is to preserve individual liberty and democratic principles based on equality of all members of society. Dr Ambedkar said that the responsibility of the legislature is not just to provide fundamental rights but also and rather, more importantly, to safeguard them.\n\nThe Fundamental Rights are not absolute and are subject to reasonable restrictions as necessary for the protection of public interest. In the \"Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala\" case in 1973, the Supreme Court, overruling a previous decision of 1967, held that the Fundamental Rights could be amended, subject to judicial review in case such an amendment violated the basic structure of the Constitution. The Fundamental Rights can be enhanced, removed or otherwise altered through a constitutional amendment, passed by a two-thirds majority of each House of Parliament. The imposition of a state of emergency may lead to a temporary suspension any of the Fundamental Rights, excluding Articles 20 and 21, by order of the President. The President may, by order, suspend the right to constitutional remedies as well, thereby barring citizens from approaching the Supreme Court for the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights, except Articles 20 and 21, during the period of the emergency. Parliament may also restrict the application of the Fundamental Rights to members of the Indian Armed Forces and the police, in order to ensure proper discharge of their duties and the maintenance of discipline, by a law made under Article 33.\n\nThe Right to Equality is one of the chief guarantees of the Constitution. It is embodied in Articles 14–18, which collectively encompass the general principles of equality before law and non-discrimination and there is no any other power given to any cast wise e.g., son of king didn't become who is qualify the quality of king is become a king\n\nArticle 15 prohibits discrimination on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth, or any of them. This right can be enforced against the State as well as private individuals, with regard to free access to places of public entertainment or places of public resort maintained partly or wholly out of State funds. However, the State is not precluded from making special provisions for women and children or any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens, including the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. This exception has been provided since the classes of people mentioned therein are considered deprived and in need of special protection.\n\nArticle 16 guarantees equality of opportunity in matters of public employment and prevents the State from discriminating against anyone in matters of employment on the grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth, place of residence or any of them. It creates exceptions for the implementation of measures of affirmative action for the benefit of any backward class of citizens in order to ensure adequate representation in public service, as well as reservation of an office of any religious institution for a person professing that particular religion.\n\nArticle 18 prohibits the State from conferring any titles other than military or academic distinctions, and the citizens of India cannot accept titles from a foreign state. Thus, Indian aristocratic titles and title of nobility conferred by the British have been abolished. However, awards such as the \"Bharat Ratna\" have been held to be valid by the Supreme Court on the ground that they are merely decorations and cannot be used by the recipient as a title.\n\nThe Right to Freedom is covered in Articles 19 to article 22, with the view of guaranteeing individual rights that were considered vital by the framers of the Constitution, and these Articles also include certain restrictions that may be imposed by the State on individual liberty under specified conditions.\n\nArticle 19 guarantees six freedoms in the nature of civil rights, which are available only to citizens of India. These include the freedom of speech and expression, freedom of assembly without arms, freedom of association, freedom of movement throughout the territory of our country, freedom to reside and settle in any part of the country of India and the freedom to practice any profession. All these freedoms are subject to reasonable restrictions that may be imposed on them by the State, listed under Article 19 itself. The grounds for imposing these restrictions vary according to the freedom sought to be restricted and include national security, public order, decency and morality, contempt of court, incitement to offences a&defamation. The State is also empowered, in the interests of the general public to nationalize any trade, industry or service to the exclusion of the citizens.\n\nThe freedoms guaranteed by Article 19 are further sought to be protected by Articles 20–22. The scope of these articles, particularly with respect to the doctrine of due process, was heavily debated by the Constituent Assembly. It was argued, especially by Benegal Narsing Rau, that the incorporation of such a clause would hamper social legislation and cause procedural difficulties in maintaining order, and therefore it ought to be excluded from the Constitution altogether. The Constituent Assembly in 1948 eventually omitted the phrase \"due process\" in favor of \"procedure established by law\". As a result, Article 21, which prevents the encroachment of life or personal liberty by the State except in accordance with the procedure established by law, was, until 1978, construed narrowly as being restricted to executive action. However, in 1978, the Supreme Court in the case of \"Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India\" extended the protection of Article 21 to legislative action, holding that any law laying down a procedure must be just, fair and reasonable, and effectively reading durocess into Article 21. In the same case, the Supreme Court also ruled that \"life\" under Article 21 meant more than a mere \"animal existence\"; it would include the right to live with human dignity and all other aspects which made life \"meaningful, complete and worth living\". Subsequent judicial interpretation has broadened the scope of Article 21 to include within it a number of rights including those to livelihood, good health, clean environment, water, speedy trial and humanitarian treatment while imprisoned. The right to education at elementary level has been made one of the Fundamental Rights under Article 21A by the 86th Constitutional amendment of 2002.\n\n\nRight against Exploitation\n\nThe Right against Exploitation, contained in Articles 23–24, lays down certain provisions to prevent exploitation of the weaker sections of the society by individuals or the State. Article 23 prohibits human trafficking, making it an offence punishable by law, and also prohibits forced labour or any act of compelling a person to work without wages where he was legally entitled not to work or to receive remuneration for it. However, it permits the State to impose compulsory service for public purposes, including conscription and community service. The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976, has been enacted by Parliament to give effect to this Article. Article 24 prohibits the employment of children below the age of 14 years in factories, mines and other hazardous jobs. Parliament has enacted the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986, providing regulations for the abolition of, and penalties for employing, child labour, as well as provisions for rehabilitation of former child labourers.\n\nThe Right to Freedom of Religion, covered in Articles 25–28, provides religious freedom to all citizens and ensures a secular state in India. According to the Constitution, there is no official State religion, and the State is required to treat all religions impartially and neutrally.\n\n\nThe Cultural and Educational rights, given in Articles 29 and 30, are measures to protect the rights of cultural, linguistic and religious minorities, by enabling them to conserve their heritage and protecting them against discrimination.\n\n\nThe Right to Constitutional Remedies empowers citizens to approach the Supreme Court of India to seek enforcement, or protection against infringement, of their Fundamental Rights.\n\nright to privacy\nRight to privacy is the latest right of our country being recently approved by the supreme court of india.\nAccording to this right we are liable to keep our material private and without our permission no one can interfere in our private matter.it applies to all our private material also.\n\nPlease Note- Right to Property was removed from the Indian Constitution in 1978. Now it is not counted as a Fundamental Right.\n\nThe Directive Principles of State Policy, embodied in Part IV of the Constitution, are directions given to the state to guide the establishment of an economic and social democracy, as proposed by the Preamble. They set forth the humanitarian and socialist instructions that were the aim of social revolution envisaged in India by the Constituent Assembly. The state is expected to keep these principles in mind while framing laws and policies, even though they are non-justiciable in nature. The Directive Principles may be classified under the following categories: ideals that the state ought to strive towards achieving; directions for the exercise of legislative and executive power; and rights of the citizens which the State must aim towards securing.\n\nDespite being non-justiciable, the Directive Principles act as a check on the state; theorised as a yardstick in the hands of the electorate and the opposition to measure the performance of a government at the time of an election. Article 37, while stating that the Directive Principles are not enforceable in any court of law, declares them to be \"fundamental to the governance of the country\" and imposes an obligation on the State to apply them in matters of legislation. Thus, they serve to emphasise the welfare state model of the Constitution and emphasise the positive duty of the state to promote the welfare of the people by affirming social, economic and political justice, as well as to fight income inequality and ensure individual dignity, as mandated\n\nArticle 39 lays down certain principles of policy to be followed by the State, including providing an adequate means of livelihood for all citizens, equal pay for equal work for men and women, proper working conditions, reduction of the concentration of wealth and means of production from the hands of a few, and distribution of community resources to \"subserve the common good\". These clauses highlight the Constitutional objectives of building an egalitarian social order and establishing a welfare state, by bringing about a social revolution assisted by the State, and have been used to support the nationalisation of mineral resources as well as public utilities. Further, several legislation pertaining to agrarian reform and land tenure have been enacted by the federal and state governments, in order to ensure equitable distribution of land resources.\n\nArticles 41–43 mandate the State to endeavour to secure to all citizens the right to work, a living wage, social security, maternity relief, and a decent standard of living. These provisions aim at establishing a socialist state as envisaged in the Preamble. Article 43 also places upon the State the responsibility of promoting cottage industries, and the federal government has, in furtherance of this, established several Boards for the promotion of khadi, handlooms etc., in coordination with the state governments. Article 39A requires the State to provide free legal aid to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are available to all citizens irrespective of economic or other disabilities. Article 43A mandates the State to work towards securing the participation of workers in the management of industries. The State, under Article 46, is also mandated to promote the interests of and work for the economic uplift of the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and protect them from discrimination and exploitation. Several enactments, including two Constitutional amendments, have been passed to give effect to this provision.\n\nArticle 44 encourages the State to secure a uniform civil code for all citizens, by eliminating discrepancies between various personal laws currently in force in the country. However, this has remained a \"dead letter\" despite numerous reminders from the Supreme Court to implement the provision. Article 45 originally mandated the State to provide free and compulsory education to children between the ages of six and fourteen years, but after the 86th Amendment in 2002, this has been converted into a Fundamental Right and replaced by an obligation upon the State to secure childhood care to all children below the age of six. Article 47 commits the State to raise the standard of living and improve public health, and prohibit the consumption of intoxicating drinks and drugs injurious to health. As a consequence, partial or total prohibition has been introduced in several states, but financial constraints have prevented its full-fledged application. The State is also mandated by Article 48 to organise agriculture and animal husbandry on modern and scientific lines by improving breeds and prohibiting slaughter of cattle. Article 48A mandates the State to protect the environment and safeguard the forests and wildlife of the country, while Article 49 places an obligation upon the State to ensure the preservation of monuments and objects of national importance. Article 50 requires the State to ensure the separation of judiciary from executive in public services, in order to ensure judicial independence, and federal legislation has been enacted to achieve this objective. The State, according to Article 51, must also strive for the promotion of international peace and security, and Parliament has been empowered under Article 253 to make laws giving effect to international treaties.\n\nThe of citizens were added to the constitution by the 42nd Amendment in 1976, upon the recommendations of the Swaran Singh Committee that was constituted by the government earlier that year. Originally ten in number, the fundamental duties were increased to eleven by the 86th Amendment in 2002, which added a duty on every parent or guardian to ensure that their child or ward was provided opportunities for education between the ages of six and fourteen years. The other fundamental duties obligate all citizens to respect the national symbols of India, including the constitution, to cherish its heritage, preserve its composite culture and assist in its defence. They also obligate all Indians to promote the spirit of common brotherhood, protect the environment and public property, develop scientific temper, abjure violence, and strive towards excellence in all spheres of life. In case of violation of fundamental duties enshrined in the constitution by a citizen including President, Vice President, Speaker, parliament members, state legislative members, etc., it amounts to contempt of the constitution which is punishable under Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971. Supreme court has ruled that these fundamental duties can also help the court to decide the constitutionality of a law passed by the legislature. There is reference to such duties in international instruments such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and Article 51A brings the Indian constitution into conformity with these treaties.\n\nThe fundamental duties noted in the constitution are as follows:\n\nIt shall be the duty of every citizen of India —\n\n\nFewer children are now employed in hazardous environments, but their employment in non-hazardous jobs, prevalently as domestic help, violates the spirit of the constitution in the eyes of many critics and human rights advocates. More than 16.5 million children are in employment. India was ranked 88 out of 159 countries in 2005, according to the degree to which corruption is perceived to exist among public officials and politicians.\nThe year 1990–1991 was declared as the \"Year of Social Justice\" in the memory of B.R. Ambedkar. The government provides free textbooks to students belonging to scheduled castes and tribes pursuing medicine and engineering courses. During 2002–2003, a sum of Rs. 4.77 crore (47.7 million) was released for this purpose. In order to protect scheduled castes and tribes from discrimination, the government enacted the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, prescribing severe punishments for such actions.\n\nThe \"Minimum Wages Act\" of 1948 empowers government to fix minimum wages for people working across the economic spectrum. The \"Consumer Protection Act of 1986\" provides for the better protection of consumers. The \"Equal Remuneration Act\" of 1976 provides for equal pay for equal work for both men and women. The \"Sampoorna Grameen Rozgar Yojana\" (Universal Rural Employment Program) was launched in 2001 to attain the objective of providing gainful employment for the rural poor. The program was implemented through the Panchayati Raj institutions.\n\nA system of elected village councils, known as Panchayati Raj covers almost all states and territories of India. One-third of the total of number of seats have been reserved for women in Panchayats at every level; and in the case of Bihar, half the seats have been reserved for women. The judiciary has been separated from the executive \"in all the states and territories except Jammu and Kashmir and Nagaland.\" India's foreign policy has been influenced by the Directive Principles. India supported the United Nations in peace-keeping activities, with the Indian Army having participated in 37 UN peace-keeping operations.\n\nThe implementation of a uniform civil code for all citizens has not been achieved owing to widespread opposition from various religious groups and political parties. The Shah Bano case (1985–86) provoked a political firestorm in India when the Supreme Court ruled that Shah Bano, a Muslim woman who had been divorced by her husband in 1978 was entitled to receive alimony from her former husband under Indian law applicable for all Indian women. This decision evoked outrage in the Muslim community, which sought the application of the Muslim personal law and in response the Parliament passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 overturning the Supreme Court's verdict. This act provoked further outrage, as jurists, critics and politicians alleged that the fundamental right of equality for all citizens irrespective of religion or gender was being jettisoned to preserve the interests of distinct religious communities. The verdict and the legislation remain a source of heated debate, with many citing the issue as a prime example of the poor implementation of Fundamental Rights.\n\nPer , prompt rendering of the justice by courts is part of animating judiciary. Rendering prompt justice is the foremost purpose of the constitution as enshrined in the Preamble to the constitution also. However the judiciary is failing dismally in this respect by causing inordinate delay considering time of rendering justice in a case arbitrarily is its constitutional liberty. study only\n\nThe Directive Principles have been used to uphold the Constitutional validity of legislations in case of a conflict with the Fundamental Rights. Article 31C, added by the 25th Amendment in 1971, provided that any law made to give effect to the Directive Principles in Article 39(b)–(c) would not be invalid on the grounds that they derogated from the Fundamental Rights conferred by Articles 14, 19 and 21. The application of this article was sought to be extended to all the Directive Principles by the 42nd Amendment in 1976, but the Supreme Court struck down the extension as void on the ground that it violated the basic structure of the Constitution. The Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles have also been used together in forming the basis of legislation for social welfare. The Supreme Court, after the judgement in the \"Kesavananda Bharati\" case, has adopted the view of the Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles being complementary to each other, each supplementing the other's role in aiming at the same goal of establishing a welfare state by means of social revolution. Similarly, the Supreme Court has used the Fundamental Duties to uphold the Constitutional validity of statutes which seeks to promote the objects laid out in the Fundamental Duties. These Duties have also been held to be obligatory for all citizens, subject to the State enforcing the same by means of a valid law. The Supreme Court has also issued directions to the State in this regard, with a view towards making the provisions effective and enabling a citizens to properly perform their duties.\n\n\n"}

It is the largest sailing event in the world, and also one of the largest Volksfeste in Germany, attracting millions of people every year from all over Germany and neighbouring countries.\nKiel Week is held annually in the last week in June, and opens officially on the preceding Saturday with the official \"Glaser\", followed by the \"Holstenbummel\". The \"Soundcheck\" is on the Friday before the official opening; it is a music festival across all the stages within the city. Kiel Week, ends with a large fireworks display at 11 p.m. on Sunday, fired from pontoons or the quays at the Howaldtswerke, visible all across the Bay of Kiel.\nthere are also lots of minigames \nMost ship races begin at the Olympic Harbor of Schilksee, also the centre of most sporting activities during Kiel Week. As Schilksee is located outside of the inner city and most sailing competitions take place yet further out, only some races – mainly of smaller boat types – can be viewed from shore, namely from along the Kiellinie at the west coast of the Bay of Kiel.\n\nKiel Week usually gathers around 5,000 sailors, 2,000 ships, and about three million visitors each year. The event is organized in a joint effort by the Yacht Club of Kiel, the Norddeutscher Regattaverein, the Hamburger Sailing Club, and the Verein Seglerhaus am Wannsee.\n\nWhile Kiel Week started out as a ship racing championship, it has long since become a large festival with many popular bands playing on public stages. They often play for free, although the corporate sponsors (many from the Schleswig-Holstein media and telecommunications industry) usually display their involvement prominently. Most of the stages can be found at the Kiellinie (the western side of the Kieler Förde from the Düsternbrook yacht harbour past the Schleswig-Holstein parliament building to the big inner-city ferry harbour), and as of late, across the Hoernbridge to the Germania harbour and the Hörn. Another area of rich cultural activity in the city centre (Rathausplatz, Holstenbrücke) and the area connecting the city centre with the ferry harbour (Alter Markt, Dänische Straße, Schloßpark). Between the public stages and especially on the \"International Market\" on the Rathausplatz, food specialties from different countries can be eaten. Small street performances and street comedy are performed in many places. A special children's program is available at the \"Spiellinie\".\n\nKiel Week is also one of the largest tall ship conventions in Germany, attracting many German and international traditional ships, mainly sailing ships. Many of them spend the week doing day tours out of Kiel, thus berthing much more in view of the festival visitors than the racing boats at Kiel-Schilksee. More than 100 traditional ships and hundreds of yachts usually participate in the Tall Ships Parade (\"Windjammer‎parade\") on the day before the closing day of the Kiel Week, i.e. usually on the second Saturday of Kiel Week. The Parade was first held in 1972, under the name of \"Operation Sail\", and was organized in celebration of the Olympic Summer Games in Germany that year, whose sailing competitions took place in Kiel. It was the first large gathering of tall ships since the time of the windjammers, and its success led to the annual Parade and to the foundation of the first sail training organization in Germany (Clipper DJS). Today, the Parade is often headed by the \"Gorch Fock\", a sister ship to the German-built \"USCGC Eagle (WIX-327)\".\n\nSince 1948, advertises an annual Kiel Week poster for the festival week. Their design is another example of the cultural positioning and visual-design tradition of the Kieler Woche. In this context represents a jury put together a selection of graphic designers and then invites them to a competition for the corporate design of the festival week. An invitation is already an honor, because the design contest enjoys a high reputation and many designs have been awarded national and international prizes.\n\nAmong other things, the following graphic artists designed for the Kiel Week: Ernst Irmler (1953), Anton Stankowski (1962), Hans Hillmann (1964), Michael Engelmann (1965), Bruno K. Wiese (1971 & 1982), Rolf Müller (, 1972), Otto Treumann (1975), Ruedi Baur (1986), Rosemarie Tissi (1990), Hans Günther Schmitz (1992), Christof Gassner (1993), Siegfried Odermatt (1994), Barbara & Gerd Baumann (1995), Wim Crouwel (1998 ), Fons M.

The motifs are applied to many objects and almost all of these – mostly developed by the competition winner himself – applications reach after a short time collector status.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

She was one of the first female travelers, whose bestselling journals were translated into seven languages. She journeyed an estimated 32,000 kilometers by land and 240,000 kilometers by sea through Southeast Asia, the Americas, Middle East, and Africa, including two trips around the world from 1846 to 1855. She was a member of geographical societies of both Berlin and Paris, but was denied membership by the Royal Geographical Society in London as it forbade the election of women before 1913.\n\nIda Reyer was born in Vienna on 14 October 1797 to a wealthy textile manufacturer named Aloys Reyer. She had five brothers and a younger sister. As a child, she preferred boys' clothing, liked sports and exercise, and received the same education as her brothers under the encouragement of her father. \"I was not shy,\" she wrote in her autobiography, \"but wild as a boy, and bolder and more forward than my elder brothers.\" Her first long journey was a trip to Palestine and Egypt when she was five years old. The influence of this experience remained with her. Following the death of her father in 1806, her mother Anna, disapproving of her previously unconventional upbringing, insisted that she wear dresses and take up piano lessons. After Napoleon Bonaparte conquered Vienna in 1809, some of the French troops were quartered in Reyer's home to Ida's dislike. During the grand review held in Schönbrunn Palace, she protested against foreign occupation by turning her back as the generals rode past.\n\nShe was introduced to contemporary explorers by her tutor, Franz Josef Trimmel, and became particularly interested in \"Robinson Crusoe\" and the writings of Alexander von Humboldt, whom she would later meet in Berlin.\n\nOn May 1, 1820, she married Dr. Mark Anton Pfeiffer, a lawyer in Lemberg (now Lviv, Ukraine). He was 24 years her senior and a widower with a grown-up son. The couple left for Lemberg a week after their wedding. Dr. Pfeiffer was soon forced to resign after uncovering corruption among senior government officials in Galicia and subsequently found it difficult to regain employment. In order to support her family, Ida moved back and forth between Vienna and Lemberg. She gave drawing and music lessons and borrowed money from her brothers.\n\nShe gave birth to two sons in Vienna: Alfred in 1821 and Oscar in 1824. The family's financial situation slightly improved after the death of her mother in 1831. With a small inheritance, she was able to continue her sons' education. She stayed in Vienna with the boys in 1833, while Dr. Pfeiffer remained in Lemberg.\n\nAfter her sons settled in secure employment, Ida Pfeiffer was finally able to fulfill her childhood dream of traveling to foreign places. She later wrote in \"Reise nach dem skandinavischen Norden und der Insel Island im Jahre 1845\" (“Visit to Iceland and the Scandinavian North,” 2 vols., Leipzig, 1845):\n\nWhen I was but a little child, I had already a strong desire to see the world. Whenever I met a travelling-carriage, I would stop involuntarily, and gaze after it until it had disappeared; I used even to envy the postilion, for I thought he also must have accomplished the whole long journey.\nIn 1842, she traveled along the Danube river to Istanbul. From there she continued to Jerusalem, stopping at Gallipoli, Smyrna, Rhodes, Cyprus, Beirut, Caesarea, and Jaffa. She returned to Beirut on 10 July 1842 and sailed for Egypt. She visited Alexandria, Cairo, and the Red Sea before returning home via Rome. Among those she met on the trip was landscape painter Hubert Sattler, the British artist William Henry Bartlett, and the Bohemian botanist, Count Friedrich von Berchtold.\n\nShe published an anonymous account of her journey in \"Reise einer Wienerin in das Heilige Land\" (“A Vienna woman's trip to the Holy Land,” 2 vols., Vienna, 1844). In return, she received 700 guilders to fund her next trip. The book was an instant success. It went through three editions and was translated into Czech in 1846 and English in 1852.\nIn 1845, Pfeiffer set out to Scandinavia and Iceland. In preparation for her travel, she studied English and Danish as well as how to preserve natural specimens and take daguerreotypes. The adventure began on 10 April 1845. She traveled from Vienna to Copenhagen, then boarded the \"Johann\" on 4 May, reaching Hafnarfjörður on the southwest coast of Iceland in eleven days. She rode to Reykjavík on horseback and toured the geothermal area of Krýsuvík. She proceeded to visit the Golden Falls and climb the volcano Mount Hekla. After her return to Denmark, she took a small steamer north to Gothenburg, Sweden and from there, went further north to Norway. \n\nShe came back to Vienna on 4 October 1845 and published her journal the following year: \"Reise nach dem skandinavischen Norden und der Insel Island\" (“Trip to the Scandinavian North and the island of Iceland,” Pest, 1846). English translations of the book appeared in Britain and the US in 1852.\n\nIn 1846, Pfeiffer started on a journey round the world, visiting Brazil, Chile and other countries of South America, Tahiti, China, India, Persia, Asia Minor and Greece, returning to Vienna in 1848. The results were published in \"Eine Frauenfahrt um die Welt\" (\"A Woman's Journey round the World,\" 3 vols., Vienna, 1850). \n\nShe boarded the Danish brig \"Caroline\", sailing southwest from Hamburg out into the Atlantic and across the equator, entering the harbor of Rio de Janeiro on 16 September 1846. Along with Friedrich von Berchtold, she traveled up the Macacu River to Nova Friburgo in southeastern Brazil and ventured deep into the forest, accompanied by a single servant. Upon her return to Rio, she booked a spot on the English barque \"John Renwick\" and set off for Chile, arriving at Valparaiso on 2 March 1847. She then sailed to the island of Tahiti before disembarking in Macao on the coast of China on 9 July. \n\nFor the next two months, she visited temples and villages in Hong Kong, went on a hunting excursion in Singapore, toured Colombo and Kandy, inquired about Bengali traditions in Calcutta, and visited the holy city of Benares. From Delhi, she arranged a bullock cart to Bombay under the advisement of Austrian scholar Aloys Sprenger, passing through Hyderabad and the Daulatabad Fort and the Ellora Caves in Aurangabad.\n\nOn 23 April 1848, she left Bombay for Baghdad, then part of the Ottoman Empire. While exploring the ruins of the ancient city of Ctesiphon, she encountered Prince Emam Qoli Mirza of the Qajar Dynasty. She proceeded to tour the archaeological sites of Babylon, Borsippa, and Nineveh, facilitated by the British Resident Henry Creswicke Rawlinson and Hormuzd Rassam, the British Vice-Consul at Mosul. During the month of Ramadan, she visited local homes in Tabriz, the capital of Azerbaijan (now East Azerbaijan Province in Iran), and was presented to the Vicegerent, Bahman Mirza.\n\nIn August 1848, she set out for Nakhchivan bordering Armenia, and soon joined a caravan heading for Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia. She then crossed the Black Sea into the Russian Empire.\n\n\"A Woman's Journey Round the World\" was published in 1850 in three volumes, two years after Pfeiffer's return to Vienna. English translations appeared in Britain in 1851, followed by Dutch (1852), French (1858), and Russian (1867). The book garnered reviews in major international journals, such as \"Le Constitutionnel\", \"The Athenaeum\", \"The Westminster Review\", \"The Literary Gazette\", \"The Straits Times\", and \"Calcutta Review\".\n\nTo fund her next expedition, Pfeiffer sold 300 guilders worth of specimens to the Royal Museum of Vienna. Carl von Schreibers, director of the Viennese natural history collections, and Austrian archaeologist Josef von Arneth applied for governmental funding on her behalf on the grounds that she had proven herself skilled at procuring rare specimens from far corners of the world. As a result, Pfeiffer was awarded 1,500 guilders . \n\nIn 1851, she set off to Berlin where she was met with an enthusiastic audience. Among them was her childhood hero, Prussian explorer Alexander von Humboldt, whose travels in the Americas inspired a great number of contemporary scientists and naturalists, including Charles Darwin, Henry David Thoreau, John Muir, and Ernst Haeckel. Pfeiffer was also welcomed by German cartographer Carl Ritter who was, at the time, Professor of Geography at the University of Berlin and with whom she would continue to collaborate after her departure. From Hamburg, Pfeiffer set sail to London and met with paleontologist Richard Owen, an outspoken critic of Charles Darwin, geographer Augustus Petermann for his expertise on Africa, and William Bartlett, her traveling companion to Jerusalem. \n\nOn 27 May 1851, Pfeiffer departed for Cape Town, South Africa. She arrived on 11 August and soon sent a box of specimens to Vincenz Kollar, curator of the Natural History Museum in Vienna. She had intended to penetrate deeper into Africa, but her hopes proved impracticable in light of overwhelming expenses. \n\nShe proceeded across the Indian Ocean to the Malay archipelago, spending two weeks in Singapore where she collected a new species of mole cricket in addition to fish, seaweed, and crustaceans. She spent eighteen months in the Sunda Islands, accompanied by Captain John Brooke, the nephew and heir of Sir James Brooke. She visited the Dayaks of Borneo and became one of the first explorers to report on the traditions of the Bataks in Sumatra and the Malukus. Along the way, she encountered Sultan Abdu'l Rashid Muhammad Jamal ud-din of the principality of Sintang, renowned ichthyologist Dr. Pieter Bleeker in Batavia (present-day Jakarta), and Colonel van der Hart at Bukittinggi in West Sumatra. She was granted permission to enter the territories of local villages where she observed dance performances, acquired a finely carved tunggal panaluan, and accumulated a collection of valuable specimens, including ray-finned fish (\"Homalopterula gymnogaster\") and checker barb (\"Puntius oligolepis\").\n\nOn 6 July 1853, she sailed across the Pacific to North America. She arrived on the West Coast of the United States during the California Gold Rush and visited Sacramento, Marysville, Crescent City, Santa Clara, and San Jose before heading south to Central America. After stops at New Granada and Peru, she returned to Guayaquil, the main port of Ecuador. In her book 'A Lady's Second Journey Round the World' she relates some unpleasant experiences in Ecuador. However, the ambassador of the United States Friedrich Hassaurek in his book 4 years among Spanish-Americans criticized this chapters of her book, as he conceived it as interesting as a personal narrative, but full of misconceptions and inaccuracies.\n\nBack in Vienna at the end of July 1855, Pfeiffer completed her narrative, \"Meine zweite Weltreise\" (“My second trip around the world”), published in Vienna in 1856. The English translation, \"Second Journey round the World\", was published by Longmans, followed by editions in Dutch (1856), French (1857), Polish (1860), Russian (1876), and Malay (1877-1907). The book was well received with positive reviews in Austrian and German newspapers, the English \"Edinburgh Review\", and the American literary magazine \"Criterion\".\n\nIn May 1857, Pfeiffer set out to explore Madagascar. Her first stop was Cape Town, South Africa. There, she encountered the French civil engineer and slave trader Joseph-François Lambert. Unbeknownst to Pfeiffer, Lambert had joined Jean Laborde and a few other Europeans in a plot to replace Ranavalona I, the queen of Madagascar, with the more moderate crown prince, Rakoto (the future king Radama II). Pfeiffer unwittingly became part of the conspiracy and was expelled from Madagascar in July 1857 after the queen discovered the attempted coup. \n\nDuring Pfeiffer's passage from the capital of Antananarivo to the coastal port of departure, she had unfortunately contracted a disease (likely malaria) and never fully recovered. She suffered through spells of fever on Mauritius and left for London on 10 March 1858. She then traveled to Hamburg but was struck by a renewed outbreak of vomiting and diarrhea.\n\nIda Laura Pfeiffer died in Vienna on 27 October 1858 in the home of her brother, Carl Reyer. A travelogue describing her final voyage, \"Reise nach Madagaskar\" (“Trip to Madagascar”), was published in Vienna in 1861 in 2 volumes and included a biography written by her son Oscar Pfeiffer.\nDuring her travels, Pfeiffer collected plants, insects, mollusks, marine life, and mineral specimens. Many were sold to Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin and the British Museum, including but not limited to:\n\nThe Naturhistorisches Museum in Vienna purchased 721 specimens from Pfeiffer's collection in Madagascar and Mauritius, including nine species of mammals, fourteen species of birds, twenty-three species of reptiles, three species of crustaceans, fifteen species of mollusks, ten species of spiders, and 185 species of insects.\n\nPfeiffer is referenced as \"Madam Pfeiffer\" in Thoreau's book, \"Walden\". Thoreau talks of how she wore more civilized clothes as she got closer to her homeland.\n\nAlfred Wallace frequently mentioned Pfeiffer in his letters to his sister, to his colleague Henry Walter Bates, and to Samuel Stevens, a natural history agent in London who supported Pfeiffer's collecting expedition to the Americas. In fact, Wallace would visit many of the same places that Pfeiffer did before him, including the Malay Archipelago.\n\nCharles Darwin cited Pfeiffer in his Descent of Man (1871), remarking that \"in Java, a yellow, not a white girl, is considered, according to Madame Pfeiffer, a beauty.\"\n\nIn 1892, the Viennese Society for the Further Education of Women transferred Ida Pfeiffer's remains to a place of honor in the Vienna Central Cemetery. She was the first woman to be admitted to the rows of honored dead.\n\nIn 2000, a street in Munich was renamed as Ida-Pfeiffer-Straße. \n\nIn 2018, the University of Vienna established an \"Ida Pfeiffer Professorship\" in the Faculty of Earth Sciences, Geography and Astronomy.\n\nPfeiffer has been of interest to historians of travel. Works of research on her life include:\n\n\n"}

The name was Austrian botanist Stephan Endlicher's way of honouring an early expert on the coniferous forests of Spain, Capt. Samuel Edward Cook or Widdrington (1787-1856). There are four species, all native to southern Africa, where they are known as cedars or African cypresses.\n\nThey are large shrubs or trees, reaching 5–20 m tall (to 40 m in \"W. whytei\"). The leaves are evergreen and scale-like, except on seedlings, which have needle-like leaves 1-1.5 cm long. The adult scale leaves are arranged in decussate opposite pairs in four rows along the twigs, while the juvenile needle leaves are arranged spirally.\n\nThe male cones are small, 3–6 mm long, and are located at the tips of the twigs. The female cones start out similarly inconspicuous, maturing in 18–20 months to 2–3 cm long and wide, globular to ovoid, with four, thick, woody scales, arranged in two opposite pairs. The cones mostly remain closed on the trees for many years, opening only after being scorched by a wildfire; this then releases the seeds to grow on the newly cleared burnt ground. In \"W. whytei\" the cones open soon after maturity to shed the seed without fire; this species is more sensitive to fire and only grows in moister situations where it is protected from fire. The best adapted to fire is \"W. nodiflora\", which has the ability to re-grow from the roots, as well as by seed.\n\nOne species is widespread in southern Africa, while the other three have restricted ranges, often occurring with or near to the widespread species.\nThe closest relatives of \"Widdringtonia\" are \"Callitris\" and \"Actinostrobus\" from Australia, which differ in their cones and leaves being in whorls of three, not opposite pairs.\n\nThe wood is light, soft and aromatic. It can be easily split and resists decay. It is used to make furniture, indoor and outdoor panelling, and fence posts. That of \"W. whytei\" was particularly valuable as it was available in large sizes, but this species is now endangered and no longer cut to any extent.\n\n"}

The magnetic field typically produced by rare-earth magnets can exceed 1.4 teslas, whereas ferrite or ceramic magnets typically exhibit fields of 0.5 to 1 tesla.\n\nThere are two types: neodymium magnets and samarium–cobalt magnets. Rare-earth magnets are extremely brittle and also vulnerable to corrosion, so they are usually plated or coated to protect them from breaking, chipping, or crumbling into powder.\n\nThe development of rare-earth magnets began around 1966, when K. J. Strnat and G. Hoffer of the US Air Force Materials Laboratory discovered that an alloy of yttrium and cobalt, YCo, had by far the largest magnetic anisotropy constant of any material then known.\n\nThe term \"rare earth\" can be misleading, as some of these metals can be as abundant in the Earth's crust as tin or lead, but rare earth ores are unevenly distributed, not existing in seams like coal or copper, so in any given cubic kilometre of crust they are \"rare\". The major source is currently China. Some countries classify rare earth metals as strategically important, and recent Chinese export restrictions on these materials have led some to initiate research programs to develop strong magnets that do not require rare earth metals. \n\nThe rare-earth (lanthanide) elements are metals that are ferromagnetic, meaning that like iron they can be magnetized to become permanent magnets, but their Curie temperatures (the temperature above which their ferromagnetism disappears) are below room temperature, so in pure form their magnetism only appears at low temperatures. However, they form compounds with the transition metals such as iron, nickel, and cobalt, and some of these compounds have Curie temperatures well above room temperature. Rare-earth magnets are made from these compounds.\n\nThe greater strength of rare-earth magnets is mostly due to two factors:\n\n\n\nSome important properties used to compare permanent magnets are: remanence (\"B\"), which measures the strength of the magnetic field; coercivity (\"H\"), the material's resistance to becoming demagnetized; energy product (\"B·H\"), the density of magnetic energy; and Curie temperature (\"T\"), the temperature at which the material loses its magnetism. Rare-earth magnets have higher remanence, much higher coercivity and energy product, but (for neodymium) lower Curie temperature than other types. The table below compares the magnetic performance of the two types of rare-earth magnets, neodymium (NdFeB) and samarium-cobalt (SmCo), with other types of permanent magnets.\n\nSource: \n\nSamarium–cobalt magnets (chemical formula: SmCo), the first family of rare-earth magnets invented, are less used than neodymium magnets because of their higher cost and lower magnetic field strength. However, samarium–cobalt has a higher Curie temperature, creating a niche for these magnets in applications where high field strength is needed at high operating temperatures. They are highly resistant to oxidation, but sintered samarium–cobalt magnets are brittle and prone to chipping and cracking and may fracture when subjected to thermal shock.\n\nNeodymium magnets, invented in the 1980s, are the strongest and most affordable type of rare-earth magnet. They are made of an alloy of neodymium, iron, and boron (NdFeB), sometimes abbreviated as NIB. Neodymium magnets are used in numerous applications requiring strong, compact permanent magnets, such as electric motors for cordless tools, hard disk drives, magnetic holddowns, and jewelry clasps. They have the highest magnetic field strength and have a higher coercivity (which makes them magnetically stable), but they have a lower Curie temperature and are more vulnerable to oxidation than samarium–cobalt magnets. \n\nCorrosion can cause unprotected magnets to spall off a surface layer or to crumble into a powder. Use of protective surface treatments such as gold, nickel, zinc, and tin plating and epoxy-resin coating can provide corrosion protection; the majority of neodymium magnets use nickel plating to provide a robust protection.\n\nOriginally, the high cost of these magnets limited their use to applications requiring compactness together with high field strength. Both the raw materials and the patent licenses were expensive. However, since the 1990s, NIB magnets have become steadily less expensive, and their lower cost has inspired new uses such as magnetic construction toys.\n\nThe greater force exerted by rare-earth magnets creates hazards that are not seen with other types of magnet. Magnets larger than a few centimeters are strong enough to cause injuries to body parts pinched between two magnets or a magnet and a metal surface, even causing broken bones. Magnets allowed to get too near each other can strike each other with enough force to chip and shatter the brittle material, and the flying chips can cause injuries. Starting in 2005, powerful magnets breaking off toys or from magnetic construction sets started causing injuries and deaths. Young children who have swallowed several magnets have had a fold of the digestive tract pinched between the magnets, causing injury and in one case intestinal perforations, sepsis, and death. \n\nA voluntary standard for toys, permanently fusing strong magnets to prevent swallowing, and capping unconnected magnet strength, was adopted in 2007. In 2009, a sudden growth in sales of magnetic desk toys for adults caused a surge in injuries, with emergency room visits estimated at 3,617 in 2012. In response, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission passed a rule in 2012 restricting rare-earth magnet size in consumer products, but it was vacated by a US federal court decision in November 2016, in a case brought by the one remaining manufacturer. After the rule was nullified, the number of ingestion incidents in the country rose sharply, and is estimated to exceed 1,500 in 2019.\nSince their prices became competitive in the 1990s, neodymium magnets have been replacing alnico and ferrite magnets in the many applications in modern technology requiring powerful magnets. Their greater strength allows smaller and lighter magnets to be used for a given application.\n\nCommon applications of rare-earth magnets include:\n\nOther applications of rare-earth magnets include:\n\nThe United States Department of Energy has identified a need to find substitutes for rare-earth metals in permanent-magnet technology and has begun funding such research. The Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) has sponsored a Rare Earth Alternatives in Critical Technologies (REACT) program, to develop alternative materials. In 2011, ARPA-E awarded 31.6 million dollars to fund Rare-Earth Substitute projects.\n\nThe European Union's ETN-Demeter project (European Training Network for the Design and Recycling of Rare-Earth Permanent Magnet Motors and Generators in Hybrid and Full Electric Vehicles) is examining sustainable design of electric motors used in vehicles. They are, for example, designing electric motors in which the magnets can be easily removed for recycling the rare earth metals.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2282465", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2282465", "title": "List of Grand Dukes of Russia", "text": "List of Grand Dukes of Russia\n\nThis is a list of those members of the Russian Imperial Family who bore the title \"Velikiy Knjaz\" (usually translated into English as Grand Duke, but more accurately Grand Prince). This courtesy title was borne by the sons and male-line grandsons of the Emperors of Russia, along with the style of His Imperial Highness. They were not sovereigns, but members and dynasts of the House of the reigning Emperor.\n\nFor those Grand Dukes who were rulers of Russia, see: \"List of Russian rulers\".\n\nThe title \"Grand Prince\" is the English translation of the Russian \"Великий князь\". The Slavic \"knyaz\" and the Baltic \"kunigaitis\" (both nowadays usually translated as Prince) is a cognate of King.\n\nThe title Grand Prince originated from 9th century when rulers of Kievan Rus' were so styled. In later medieval Russian states (the Rus') it already was used simultaneously by several rulers in the more expanded Rurikid dynasty and additionally by rulers of neighboring Lithuania (Gediminid dynasty).\n\nThe title velikiy knyaz continued as a courtesy title for all or several members of the dynasty, such as the Grand Duke of Russia during Russia's imperial era from the 17th century, although these Grand Princes were not sovereigns. For those Grand Dukes who were rulers of Russia, see List of Russian rulers.\n\nBearing the title \"Velikiy Kniaz\" originally had no specific rules: it traditionally belonged to all dynasts, and additionally, dynasts were created by the act of granting the title to some other heirs. Until the 19th century, the Russian Imperial House was usually in a precarious situation, having often no more than a couple of male dynasts, if even that many. The number to use the title was thus not abundant. Empress Elisabeth of Russia, after all male-line descent had been exhausted, made her sister's son, the future Peter III of Russia a dynast and a Grand Duke, although he was not of male-line descent.\n\nAfter the births of the numerous sons of Nicholas I of Russia, the number of Grand Dukes increased into higher orders of magnitude. This afforded Russia a respite from earlier fragility that had plagued Russian succession, having led even as itself the country to instability. The right to the title was not traditionally limited, and in the 1880s (when there existed well over twenty male dynasts) Alexander III of Russia felt that their high number, if all allowed to use \"Grand Duke\", diminished the prestige of the Imperial House and the weight of the title itself. \n\nAlexander III formalized the use of titles in the Imperial House in 1886 (on 2 July 1886 Julian calendar, 14 July 1886 Gregorian) by such amendment to the succession laws. Grand Duke belonged henceforward only to sons and paternal grandsons of the Emperors of Russia, and Grand Duchess correspondingly only to daughters and paternal granddaughters, as well as to legitimate wives of Grand Dukes.\n\nOne male infant only 9 days old at the time of Alexander's edict thus lost the title. Those Russian dynasts who genealogically were distant from Emperors (as not to be Grand Dukes) were entitled to titulary \"Prince of Russia\". Ioann Konstantinovich of Russia (1886–1918) was apparently the only who lost the grand ducal title accorded by convention at birth but removed by Alexander III. Alexander III's own grandchildren, children of his daughter Xenia Alexandrovna, were not yet born at the time of the edict, and accordingly became \"only\" Princes of Russia from their births, as they were great-grandchildren of Nicholas I (one generation too far) when looking at the male lineage.\n\nThe numbers began to decrease for other reasons too. In the last three decades before the revolution, only a couple of boys were born who were entitled to grand ducal title. After the revolution, particularly morganatic marriages axed numbers of dynasts to increasingly low numbers. Alexander III's edict has led to the situation where there is no longer any descendant to be uncontestedly entitled to grand ducal title.\n\nGreat Prince or Grand Prince would be a more accurate translation of this Russian title, but that term is neither standard nor widely used in English nor in French. In German, however, a Russian Grand Duke was known as a \"Großfürst\", and in Latin as \"Magnus Princeps\". \"Grand Duke\" is the traditional translation of the title \"Velikiy Kniaz\" in languages which do not have different words for prince as a substantive title and prince as a courtesy title. English and French are such languages.\n\nAmazingly enough, after 1918 no such boy was born into the deposed imperial house who would have been entitled to the title grand duke - i.e., had been a male-line grandson of a reigning emperor; although such would have been technically possible, as there lived sons of reigning emperors and their sons would have been so entitled.\n\n\nThe title of sovereign \"Grand Duke\" and it as translation of \"Velikiy Knjaz\" have clearly different meanings. This occurs particularly in languages which do not have different words for prince (1) signifying the non-ruling relatives of a monarch, i.e. as a courtesy title, and (2) prince signifying a monarch (sovereign or like), i.e. as a substantive title, because there Grand Duke usually is (1) the established translation of the post-medieval courtesy title \"Velikiy Knjaz\" (literally: grand prince), and they are not sovereigns, but (2) several other post-medieval grand dukes are, being typically rulers of small states (such as Luxembourg). English and French use the title Grand Duke for both these purposes. In translations and such texts, (2) Grand Duke of Russia may also refer to some or all of the medieval reigning grand princes of the Kievan Rus' and its successor states.\n\nGrand Duke is the usual and established translation in English and French of the Russian courtesy title \"Velikiy Knjaz (grand prince) of Russia\", which from 17th century belonged to members of the family of the Russian tsar, although those Grand dukes were not sovereigns.\n\nNote that a Grand Duke or Grand Duchess as a translation is thus not necessarily associated with a Grand Duchy; see the relevant articles for more information. These post-medieval Russian grand dukes are not associated with a grand duchy.\n\nAny other translation of \"Velikiy Knjaz of Russia\" than \"Grand Duke\" is neither standard nor widely used in English nor in French. In German, however, a Russian Grand Duke is known as a \"Großfürst\", and in Latin as \"Magnus Princeps\".\n\nA Russian Grand Duke or Grand Duchess was an \"Imperial Highness\".\n\n"}

He became a member of the Royal Academy in 1866 and a full academician in 1874.\n\nAs an enthusiastic amateur musician, he helped the career of the young composer Hamish MacCunn by organizing concerts for him in his own studio. MacCunn, who would marry his daughter Alison in 1888, also served as a model for many of his paintings and sketches in various distinctive occasions.\n\nJohn Pettie was born in Edinburgh, the son of Alexander and Alison Pettie. In 1852 the family moved to East Linton, Haddingtonshire. Initially, his father objected to Pettie taking up art as a career, but this was overcome following a portrait by the lad of the village carrier and his donkey. \n\nWhen he was sixteen he entered the Trustees Academy in Edinburgh, working under Robert Scott Lauder with William Quiller Orchardson, J. MacWhirter, William McTaggart, Peter Graham (1836–1921), Tom Graham (1840–1906) and George Paul Chalmers. His first exhibits at the Royal Scottish Academy were \"A Scene from the Fortunes of Nigel,\" one of the many subjects for which he sought inspiration in the novels of Sir Walter Scott, and two portraits in 1858, followed in 1859 by \"The Prison\". To the Royal Academy in 1860 he sent \"The Armourers\"; and the success of this work and \"What d'ye Lack, Madam?\" in the following year encouraged him to settle in London (1862), where he joined Orchardson.\n\nIn 1866 he was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy, and in 1874 received full academical honours in succession to Sir Edwin Landseer. His diploma picture was \"Jacobites, 1745\". Pettie was a hard and rapid worker, and, in his best days, a colourist of a high order and a brilliant executant. In his early days he produced a certain amount of book illustration. His connection with Good Words began in 1861, and was continued until 1864. He painted a portrait of the painter James Campbell Noble RSA and this is exhibited in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh. In 1894 a selection of his work was included in the Winter Exhibition of the Royal Academy. His self-portrait is in the Tate Gallery.\n\nThe National Portrait Gallery has four of his works in its collection.\n\nWith William McTaggart and others, he illustrated \"The Postman's Bag\" (Strahan, 1862), and with John MacWhirter he illustrated \"Wordsworth's Poetry for the Young\" (Strahan, 1863). His principal paintings, in addition to those already mentioned, are:\n\n\n\n\n"}

The station was originally assigned to 89.3 MHz and was granted its first license on February 21, 1950. In 1992, the FCC forced the station to change frequencies to 107.9 MHz.\n\nIn 2004, a new radio station licensed to Radio One to serve Pennsauken, New Jersey and the Philadelphia market (WRNB, now WPPZ-FM) signed on, requiring WHHS to change frequencies again. With Radio One's help, WHHS moved to 99.9 MHz in 2005.\n\nIn 2006, the station began broadcasting live sporting events such as football and hockey, even broadcasting live from the Wachovia Spectrum; the former home of the Philadelphia Flyers and 76ers. The station is continuing to branch out into the community with the effort spearheaded by producing a product that township residents can understand and enjoy while teaching students necessary skills and encouraging creativity. This has been accomplished in many ways; one of which included a 12-hour election day special along with interviews before the elections with such politicians and Congressman Curt Weldon and Congressman elect Joe Sestak.\n\nWHHS celebrated 65 years of the broadcasting in 2014, and held a 24-hour Radiothon which raised funds for the station's future.\n\nOn January 28, 2017, WHHS-FM announced applications for new disk jockeys during the latter half of the remaining school year.\n"}

However, a high court exercises its original civil and criminal jurisdiction only if the subordinate courts are not authorized by law to try such matters for lack of pecuniary, territorial jurisdiction. High courts may also enjoy original jurisdiction in certain matters, if so designated specifically in a state or federal law.\n\nBasically, the work of most high courts primarily consists of appeals from lower courts and writ petitions in terms of Article 226 of the constitution. Writ jurisdiction is also an original jurisdiction of a high court.\n\nEach state is divided into judicial districts presided over by a district and sessions judge. He is known as district judge when he presides over a civil case, and session's judge when he presides over a criminal case. He is the highest judicial authority below a high court judge. Below him, there are courts of civil jurisdiction, known by different names in different states. Under Article 141 of the constitution, all courts in India — including high courts — are bounded by the judgments and orders of the Supreme Court of India by precedence.\n\nJudges in a high court are appointed by the President of India in consultation with the Chief Justice of India and the governor of the state. High courts are headed by a chief justice. The chief justices rank fourteenth (within their respective states) and seventeenth (outside their respective states) on the Indian order of precedence. The number of judges in a court is decided by dividing the average institution of main cases during the last five years by the national average, or the average rate of disposal of main cases per judge per year in that High Court, whichever is higher.\n\nThe Calcutta High Court is the oldest high court in the country, established on 2 July 1862. High courts that handle numerous cases of a particular region have permanent benches established there. Benches are also present in states which come under the jurisdiction of a court outside its territorial limits. Smaller states with few cases may have circuit benches established. Circuit benches (known as circuit courts in some parts of the world) are temporary courts which hold proceedings for a few selected months in a year. Thus cases built up during this interim period are judged when the circuit court is in session. According to a study conducted by Bangalore-based NGO, Daksh, on 21 high courts in collaboration with the Ministry of Law and Justice in March 2015, it was found that average pendency of a case in high courts in India is 3 years. high court look after the issues which are not solved in district court.high court's were first established in three presidency cities of calcutta, bombay and madras in 1862.The high court of delhi came up in 1966.currently there are 25 high courts.while many states have their own high courts, Punjab and haryana share a common high court at chandigarh, and Four northeast states have a common high court at guwahati.some high courts have been benches in other parts of the state for greater accessibility \".\"\n\nThe Madras High Court in Chennai, Bombay High Court in Mumbai, Calcutta High Court in Kolkata and Allahabad High Court in Prayagraj are the oldest four high courts in India.\n\nThe following are the 25 high courts in India sorted by name, year established, Act by which it was established, jurisdiction, principal seat (headquarters), permanent benches (subordinate to the principal seat), circuit benches (functional a few days in a month/year), the maximum number of judges sanctioned and the presiding chief justice of the high court.\n\n\nThough Telangana High Court was established in April 20, 2019 but after the creation of separate Andhra Pradesh High Court on January 1, 2019 the jurisdiction of the former will only be within the state of Telangana .\nSo, though it was established in 2019, when we say Telangana High Court, we should mention the creation day as January 1, 2019 i.e. same as the creation of Andhra Pradesh High Court.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2282524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2282524", "title": "Elliot in the Morning", "text": "Elliot in the Morning\n\nElliot in the Morning is a morning radio talk show hosted by DJ Elliot Segal. It airs weekdays from \"5:48 until 10 something\" on WWDC-FM in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, and on WRXL in Richmond, Virginia. The program was simulcast on WOSC in Ocean City, Maryland from 2003 to 2004, on WCHH in Baltimore, Maryland from May 2008 to November 2009, and on WBWZ in the Hudson Valley of New York until 2017. Beginning in January 2014, the show was briefly simulcast on WOR-AM, while continuing to simulcast on the DC and Richmond stations, with the show originally planning to leave the DC101 studios in January 2014. However, after citing that \"significant changes\" would be needed for the show to succeed in NYC, it was announced that the show would no longer be carried on WOR-AM.\n\nThe format covers a broad spectrum of topics, ranging from in-person or telephone interviews with well-known celebrities, to gross-out stunts involving much of the show's supporting cast. The show has regular telephone interviews with Patricia Murphy (from The Daily Beast), Mark Steines (from Entertainment Tonight) during sweeps and Brandon Noble (former NFL player) during football season.\n\nAs of 2005, \"Elliot in the Morning\" had been the cause of the fifth largest amount of Federal Communications Commission (FCC) fines since 1970, with $302,500 worth of fines leveled at the show. As a result, while the show still frequently involves euphemistic mentions of sexual topics, it is broadcast with a short tape delay, and is occasionally \"dumped\" to canned music for profanity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther former members: Dan Hoffman, Brett Haber, Jared Stern, and David Brody who is credited with giving Flounder his nickname (Because he looked liked Flounder from Animal House) and worked with Elliot at WHTZ.\n\nThe show's most prominent catchphrase has an unusual origin. The technically clean but inexplicably lewd-sounding phrase was conceived when the cast of the show was observing mug shots on the Frederick News-Post website (a local newspaper) for persons caught soliciting prostitutes. One picture that caught their eye was a badly disheveled man with a huge, bushy grey beard named Ronny Kline. Imagining what such a man might say to a woman after performing cunnilingus, the phrase \"smell my face\" immediately sprang to mind.\n\nThe phrase became a kind of \"battle cry\" and has been heavily integrated into the show's promotional material, with bumper stickers, signs, and highly coveted T-shirts. The show's cast and crew have also solicited (or tricked) numerous celebrities into saying the catchphrase for recordings used to promote the show. So far, there are recordings of Aaron Neville, Marguerite Perrin, Hélio Castroneves, Brittany Murphy, Mark Hoppus, Joe Frazier, Paul Stanley, Perry Farrell, Constantine Maroulis, Plain White T's, The Pussycat Dolls, Hulk Hogan, John Basedow, Josh Kelley, Sebastian Bach, Timbaland, Juliette Lewis, Pat McGee, Stephan Jenkins, Chyna, Night Ranger, Jeffrey Ross, \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, and Chris Cornell.\n\nIn February 2000, Elliot related a lewd urban legend involving a woman who performed a sexual act with a live lobster. The show continued uninterrupted, but a message from General Manager Mark O'Brien was repeatedly played on the station later in the day condemning the story and announcing Segal's 'indefinite suspension'. Segal returned to the airwaves two days later. The episode has been replayed on \"Best of...\" versions of the show, with the offending portions censored.\n\nOn the morning of February 8, 2001, Elliot Segal sent Bryan \"Flounder\" Schlossberg to the south fence of the White House, where a gunman had been shot and arrested the previous day, offering passersby to a \"free shot of bush.\" The \"bush\" in question was an anatomical reference in connection to a spread of porn magazines that were on display. Flounder was connected to the airwaves via cell phone when the Secret Service surrounded him and demanded that he hang up the phone. In the end, Flounder avoided being taken into custody, but was however banned from the grounds of the White House indefinitely.\n\nThe morning of May 7, 2002, on D.C. metro area disc jockey Elliot Segal's radio program, DC101's \"Elliot in the Morning\", two sixteen-year-old O'Connell students called to be considered in a contest whose winners were to be cage dancers at an upcoming Kid Rock concert at George Mason University's Patriot Center. Instead, goaded by Elliot, they discussed alleged sexual activity at O'Connell. The students claimed to be eighteen. The two discussed giving oral sex to lines of boys in the hallway and having intercourse in stairwells and closets. They implied these acts occurred during a typical school day. The students, who had used false names on air, were suspended the same day for their comments. The principal addressed the student body on the PA system and discussed the immorality of Mr. Segal's radio show. The following day (May 8), Mr. Segal, angered by the students' suspension, personally insulted the principal on air, making lewd remarks about his family and his sexual activity. He also mocked the school's mission statement, specifically what he considered to be a hypocritical statement that their educational environment is \"rooted in the life of Christ.\" The two days of broadcasting were ruled indecent by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). As a result, in October 2003, sixteen months after the incident, DC101's parent company Clear Channel Communications was fined $55,000.\n\nIn the summer of 2003, Segal conducted an interview with someone he believed to be famous cyclist Lance Armstrong. In reality, the caller was Chad Dukes, currently the co-host of Chad Dukes vs. The World on WJFK-FM in Washington, DC. Dukes stayed in character as Lance Armstrong for over seven minutes on-air without arousing the suspicions of Segal or his co-hosts. When Segal asked Dukes – still in character as Armstrong – what the greatest moment in his career was, Dukes responded that it was \"when The Junkies moved to HFS in the mornings you jack-tool-ass-f, I can't believe you thought this was Lance Arm...!\" Segal abruptly hung up on Dukes in mid-sentence and laughed it off before going to commercial break.\n\nOn November 8, 2007, Elliot Segal announced that Dan Patrick would no longer be contributing to the show.

Similar to Japan's Living National Treasure award, the Fellowship is the United States' highest honor in the folk and traditional arts. It is a one-time only award and fellows must be living citizens or permanent residents of the United States. Each year, fellowships are presented to between nine and fifteen artists or groups at a ceremony in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe Fellows are nominated by individual citizens, with an average of over 200 nominations per year. From that pool of candidates, recommendations are made by a rotating panel of specialists, including one layperson, as well as folklorists and others with a variety of forms of cultural expertise. The recommendations are then reviewed by the National Council on the Arts, with the final decisions made by the chairperson of the National Endowment for the Arts. As of 2019, 440 artists in a wide variety of fields have received Fellowships.\n\nThe program was officially founded in 1982 by Bess Lomax Hawes, the first director of the Folk and Traditional Arts Program at the NEA, following a five-year period of development. In 1982, the monetary award associated with the Fellowship was $5,000; in 1993, it was increased to $10,000 and since 2009, the award amount is $25,000, which is considered \"enough to make a difference, but not enough to go to anyone's head\". Each recipient receives a certificate of honor, the monetary award, and a congratulatory letter from the President of the United States.\n\nThe annual recognition events are held in the Fall and consist of an awards ceremony, a banquet, and a concert that is open to the public. Over the years, the awards ceremony has been held at different locations in the US capitol city, including the NEA headquarters, Ford's Theatre, George Washington University, the Library of Congress, and for the first time at the White House in 1995. Since 2000, the banquet has been held in the Great Hall of the Library of Congress. The concert features musical performances, craft demonstrations, and interviews with the honorees. Masters of ceremonies at the concerts have included folksinger Pete Seeger, actress Ruby Dee, author Studs Terkel, journalist Charles Kuralt, and since 1997 Nick Spitzer, the host of public radio program \"American Routes\". Beginning in 2010, the Fellowship concerts have been streamed live on the NEA website and archived on YouTube.\n\nIn 2000, the NEA instituted the Bess Lomax Hawes Award in conjunction with the Fellowships, \"given to an individual for achievements in fostering excellence, ensuring vitality, and promoting public appreciation of the folk and traditional arts\". The Hawes Award has been given annually since 2000 to recognize \"artists whose contributions, primarily through teaching, advocacy, and organizing and preserving important repertoires, have greatly benefited their artistic tradition. It also recognizes individuals, such as producers and activists, who have comprehensively increased opportunities for and public visibility of traditional artists.\"\n\n\nAwardees have included Native American basket weavers, African American blues musicians, traditional fiddlers, Mexican American accordionists, and all manner of traditional artisans and performers of numerous ethnic backgrounds.\n\nNational Heritage Fellowship winners are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Hayes was distinguished by his \"Masterpiece Theatre diction\" and \"Oxford accent\".\n\nBorn in London, Hayes attended the North-Western Polytechnic, which was evacuated to Luton Modern School during World War II. He attained a black belt in judo before training as a wrestler under Sir Atholl Oakeley, Bt. Wrestling as \"Judo\" Al Hayes, he appeared on the British circuit from the late 1950s to the late 1960s, when he left the United Kingdom and traveled to the United States. He was a blue-eye who battled all of the heavyweight heels of his time, and held the Southern Area Heavyweight Championship for a number of years. He traded heavily on his judo background, and specialised with judo chops and nerve holds. His most famous period was when he fought for Paul Lincoln Promotions as The White Angel, with a massive feud against Dr Death. Death eventually won, and unmasked Hayes. Hayes would later make a homecoming tour of the United Kingdom, including televised matches. During these bouts, he remained a heel and fought his way through most of his former tag partners. It was explained that Hayes had inherited the dreaded \"American style\" in his adopted country.\n\nHayes later went to wrestle in America. In 1972, he defeated Dory Funk Jr. for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship but the decision was changed when Funk's father Dory Funk Sr. attacked the referee after the match. In a fit of anger, the official disqualified Funk Jr., thus inadvertently returning the title to the champion. Hayes also wrestled in brief stints for his future employer the WWWF, battling Bruno Sammartino for the World Heavyweight Championship on occasion.\n\nWhile wrestling for Sam Muchnick in St. Louis during the mid-1970s, Hayes turned heel and adopted the gimmick of the aristocratic \"Lord Alfred\" Hayes. Hayes adopted the role as a manager after he had decided wrestling was taking a toll on his knees. As this character, Hayes later became a manager in the AWA, Florida and later Montreal, managing fellow Brit Billy Robinson, Baron von Raschke, Jimmy Valiant (whom he rebranded as \"King James\" Valiant) and the Super Destroyers. He became notorious for delivering TV interviews in a sneering aristocratic English accent, often sipping cups of tea and wearing a bow tie and frilly shirt.\n\nHayes reverted to babyface and began a feud with fellow manager Bobby Heenan after an incident in November 1979 where Super Destroyer II fired Hayes and replaced him with Heenan. In other territories however, Hayes remained a heel. In Florida in 1980, Hayes began managing Bobby Jaggers while his regular manager Oliver Humperdink was busy acting as Dusty Rhodes' servant for thirty days (after another protege of his, Ivan Koloff lost a match to Rhodes with that stipulation.) When \"Rooster\" Humperdink, who had become a figure of sympathy during his thirty days' servitude, returned to management and attempted to claim back Jaggers, Hayes and another protege Nikolai Volkoff brutally beat on Humperdink, thus starting a feud with Humperdink and Rhodes.\n\nHayes later worked again as a heel manager for Robinson in Lutte Internationale in the early 1980s during Robinson's reign with the Canadian International Heavyweight Championship. Hayes also managed Masked Superstar, around this time.\n\nHayes joined the World Wrestling Federation in 1982. Hayes started as a road agent but then started doing television for McMahon as well, starting work as an interviewer during the December 26, 1983 edition of wrestling at Madison Square Garden. He was a sidekick to Vince McMahon on \"Tuesday Night Titans\", a WWF-style talk show from 1984 to 1986. Hayes became familiar to WWF viewers as a light-spoken Englishman (using a softer accent than during his period as a heel manager) with an uproarious laugh. On \"TNT\", Hayes usually was the victim of several slapsticks; some instances included getting a face-full of powder, being slopped with pumpkin-innards by \"Captain\" Lou Albano, drinking one of Hulk Hogan's diet shakes, then promptly vomiting, being nearly bitten by one of Hillbilly Jim's goats, and getting slapped in the face by \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper. He would later become the introductory announcer on \"Prime Time Wrestling\", on which he would give rousing and complimentary introductions to the face hosts and slightly less flattering but coolly worded intros to Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan. He was once \"taken hostage\" from the show by Sgt. Slaughter and his \"Iraqi\" allies.\n\nHayes appeared at WrestleMania in 1985 where he was the backstage commentator introducing matches and pre-recorded comments by the wrestlers. As Hayes was announcing the upcoming WWF Women's Championship match to the TV audience, he was affectionately kissed on the cheek by his real life friend The Fabulous Moolah as she and her charge, WWF Women's Champion Leilani Kai walked to the ring for Kai's title defence against Wendi Richter (Kai also kissed a visibly blushing Hayes). Moolah would also kiss Hayes full on the lips during an episode of \"Tuesday Night Titans\". At WrestleMania 2, he served as commentator alongside Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura and the \"Mistress of the Dark\" Elvira for the Los Angeles portion of the event. This was the only WWF pay-per-view on which Hayes commentated on the main event (Hulk Hogan vs King Kong Bundy in a steel cage for Hogan's WWF World Heavyweight Championship belt). For the Coliseum Video release of WrestleMania III, Hayes briefly appeared alongside Gorilla Monsoon hyping the event. In 1986, Hayes served as ring announcer for early tapings of \"WWF Wrestling Challenge\".\n\nAs the WWF's video library began to expand, Hayes became a mainstay in many of the releases; such as \"Etiquette With Lord Alfred Hayes\", a short segment on the WWF World Tour 1991 tape, where he attempted to teach table manners to Sensational Sherri and The Brooklyn Brawler. Another great segment on the tape collections took place on the \"Supertape\" series when Lord Alfred Hayes would voice \"The Call of the Action\" in which a match or two would be slowed down and each manoeuvre named and explained (for instance, the audience could learn what a reverse crescent kick was, long before it became more famously known as \"Sweet Chin Music\"). It was also an example of how as late as 1990 or so, professional wrestling was still presented with \"Kayfabe\", the veneer of reality. He later appeared on the video releases of WrestleMania VII where he had a corny \"Love Story\"-like part regarding the reunion of \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage and his former manager Miss Elizabeth following Savage's career-ending loss to The Ultimate Warrior, WrestleMania VIII, and Royal Rumble 1993 where he famously asked to watch Sensational Sherri put on her stockings while interviewing her in her dressing room, prompting Sherri to mockingly call him a \"dirty old man\". He also appeared on some early episodes of \"Monday Night RAW\"). Wrestlemania VII also saw the last Wrestlemania match called by Hayes when he joined Monsoon in calling the Intercontinental Championship match between champion Mr Perfect and challenger the Big Boss Man. This was due to Monsoon's co-commentator for the event Bobby Heenan being Perfect's manager at the time and he was required to be at ringside.\n\nLord Alfred also appeared on many episodes of \"Saturday Night's Main Event\", often performing silly recorded acts with fellow WWF commentator/interviewer \"Mean\" Gene Okerlund. One skit involved Hayes and Okerlund (referred to as \"Jim\" by Hayes despite Okerlund protesting his name was \"Gene\") taking a safari through Africa, encountering many strange sights along the way (Akeem \"The African Dream\" and his manager Slick, Koko B. Ware and his parrot \"Frankie\", The Bushwhackers, and Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts and his pet python \"Damien\").\n\nHayes is known for having spoken the phrase \"Promotional consideration paid for by the following\", which was heard at the end of \"Superstars of Wrestling\" and \"Wrestling Challenge\" syndicated shows. At WrestleMania fan access, fans would ask him to repeat his line.\n\nAs a commentator, Hayes maintained his reserved mannerisms; though not specifically a heel, he would be quicker to give praise to heelish characters, though disapproving of underhanded methods (in one match, after being told by Gorilla Monsoon that the Hart Foundation had \"broken every rule in the book,\" he replied with a conceding \"yes, they've done that\"). He was jokingly referred to by Hulk Hogan as \"Awful Alfred\" during interviews. It was during this time that his hearty uproarious laugh would become his trademark, bursting into laughter after a witty comment by his regular broadcast partner Gorilla Monsoon. He would quietly absorb criticism and insults from heel commentators such as Heenan and The Honky Tonk Man. However, toward the end of his WWF run he quietly shifted to a more heelish style, where he would be quicker to take the sides of heels (such as Owen Hart after he turned on Bret) and quicker to insult the faces (calling Paul Bearer a \"little toad\"). His final famous WWF promo took place in November 1994, when The Headshrinkers did a promo for \"Left Guard Sport stick (a parody of Right Guard Sport Stick)\" and Fatu and Sione (The Headshrinkers) ate the deodorant causing Alfred to keep telling them to stop.\n\nHayes' various roles for the WWF included co-hosting \"All American Wrestling\" with Gene Okerlund and doing commentary for shows at Madison Square Garden with Gorilla Monsoon sporadically from 1984–1990. Hayes' most common broadcast partner was Sean Mooney, whom was paired with Hayes on \"Prime Time Wrestling\", \"WWF Mania\", as well as most all releases for Coliseum Video starting in 1989 until 1993. Hayes and Mooney often participated in comedic skits together, including a \"Star Trek\" parody. Hayes was also the announcer for Bobby Heenan's \"The Bobby Heenan Show\", which aired briefly in the Summer of 1989.\n\nAt one point, he also assisted Edouard Carpentier, Raymond Rougeau and Guy Hauray as a commentator on the French-language broadcasts of the WWF on RDS (Réseau des sports) in the province of Quebec and throughout Canada.\n\nAfter leaving the WWF, Hayes would later appear as a full-on heel commentator alongside Mick Karch, calling the action in 1996 for the short-lived American Wrestling Federation.\n\nHayes retired from the WWF in 1995 after enduring a series of pay cuts. McMahon and the rest of the office were reportedly very upset at the news as Hayes was someone that they didn't want to lose. Around this time he was also involved in a serious car accident. As a result of the accident he suffered gangrene and part of a leg had to be amputated. Hayes was a wheelchair user for the remainder of his life. He spent the last few years of his life in a retirement home, only venturing out of the home to make appearances at wrestling conventions sporadically. He later suffered a series of strokes and died on 21 July 2005 at his home in Texas. On the first episode of \"Monday Night RAW\" to air after his death, WWE paid tribute to Hayes with a ten-bell salute and a video memorial. On 15 November 2010 \"Old School\" edition of \"Raw\", his voice-over was a part of the broadcast.\n\n\n"}

Founded at the University of Illinois in 1925, ΒΣΨ has more than 7,500 initiated members. With 12 chapters and colonies in 8 states, there are currently over 300 undergraduate members. Beta Sigma Psi is centered on three S's: Spiritual, Scholastic, and Social.\n\nThe Purpose of Beta Sigma Psi Fraternity:\n\nTo provide an environment in which the Lutheran college man can grow spiritually, scholastically, and socially. To that end Beta Sigma Psi undertakes programs designed to develop leaders and to aid the individual in assuming a satisfying and useful role in society. Through its alumni and undergraduate leadership Beta Sigma Psi endeavors to assist each member:\n\n\nBeta Sigma Psi was founded as a national fraternity for Lutheran male students on April 17, 1925. The Fraternity had its origins for students at the University of Illinois and has since spread across the United States, primarily in the mid-west.\n\nThe Rev. Frederick William Gustav Stiegemeyer, the son of a pastor, was born on January 16, 1878, in a parsonage in Dubuque, Iowa. Early in his life, he decided to follow his father's footsteps and serve the Lord. He received his college education at Concordia College in Ft. Wayne, Indiana, and prepared for the ministry at Concordia Seminary in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nThe Rev. Stiegemeyer served his congregations faithfully, serving churches in Ohio, West Virginia, and Illinois. In 1911, he accepted a call to St. John's Evangelical Lutheran Church in Champaign, Illinois. As part of his ministry, he was to serve the students at the University of Illinois.\n\nIn the fall of 1919, he organized the Lutheran Illini League with a combination of ten students. At that time their intentions were to do no more than meet once or twice a week for religious instruction and discussion on contemporary issues. In the fall of 1920, now with twenty members, the Lutheran Illini League rented a house, and in early 1921 was reorganized as the Concordia Club.\n\nBy 1923 the group regularly participated in campus activities and then adopted the name \"Concordia Fraternity.\" This was among the circumstances that encouraged some of the members to give serious thought to once again reorganizing and making it a Greek Letter Fraternity. Meetings were held, and plans were laid to organize as a new national fraternity.\n\nThose men who worked on these plans were convinced that they would create a National fraternity that would maintain all the noble aspirations of the Concordia Club founders. Those who shared this conviction were:\n\n\nThese men, considered the founding fathers of Beta Sigma Psi, decided to act in the spring of 1925. Incorporation papers were filed for Beta Sigma Psi National Fraternity on April 17, 1925, in Springfield, Illinois.\n\nThe Concordia Fraternity at Champaign had been in correspondence with the Rev. Paul Schmidt, who had formed a similar organization at Purdue University for students. One month after incorporation papers were filed in Springfield, Illinois, members of Alpha chapter drove to Purdue to help organize Beta chapter. Within months, the first National Council of Beta Sigma Psi was elected.\n\nIn the 1920s, Beta Sigma Psi experienced a prosperous early growth. Gamma chapter at the University of Michigan (1928) and Delta chapter at the University of Nebraska (1929) soon joined Alpha and Beta chapters. By this time, guests from other Concordia Clubs from all around were attending National Council meetings, and Alpha chapter was busy building a new house.\n\nWhen the depression of the 1930s hit, fraternity financing became very difficult, and Gamma chapter was forced to close in 1933. Alpha chapter closed in 1940. During World War II, Beta Sigma Psi had only two chapters, Beta and Delta, with a combined membership of fourteen men. At this time, an undergraduate member named Delmar Lienemann from Delta chapter stepped forward and was elected Secretary-Treasurer. He started his job with nothing more than the National Constitution and a great determination to keep the fraternity alive. Del served Beta Sigma Psi loyally as a volunteer for 22 years, and now the fraternity's highest honor is named for him.\n\nThrough hard work and determination, Beta Sigma Psi survived World War II, and in 1949, Epsilon chapter was established at Iowa State University. Expansion continued over the next few years as Zeta chapter was organized at Kansas State University in 1951, and Eta chapter followed at the University of Missouri–Rolla in 1952. That year at the National Council meeting in Ames, Iowa, the fraternity found another leader who would work with Del for many years. John Hingst, an alumnus of Beta chapter, was elected National President and went on to serve for 14 years in that position. Then in 1955, Alpha chapter was reactivated, and in 1962 Iota chapter was chartered at the University of Missouri – Columbia.\n\nBeta Sigma Psi continued to prosper in the 1960s due to its growing membership, its common faith principles, and the strong leadership of alumni such as John Hingst of Beta chapter and Larry Edwards of Zeta chapter. Throughout the decade, new chapters were formed at several new campuses, including Western Michigan University, Eastern Illinois University, and the University of Minnesota. Growth was so rapid that the fraternity decided to add a full-time staff person. Although Del Lienemann had served faithfully as a loyal volunteer in the role of Secretary-Treasurer, the National Council decided in 1965 that in order for Beta Sigma Psi to become a strong national fraternity, it needed to have a full-time employee. Dick Weiss, an alumnus of Epsilon chapter, was named the fraternity's first salaried Secretary-Treasurer, and the National Headquarters office was moved from Omaha, Nebraska, to St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nIn 1969, Beta Sigma Psi became a full member of the National Interfraternity Conference. The NIC had long been dominated by large national fraternities with 100 or more chapters. Hence, Beta Sigma Psi became the first \"niche\" fraternity to be recognized as a full member of NIC. Soon afterward, other groups representing Latino, African-American, and other religious fraternities sought membership in NIC as well.\n\nThe Rev. Walter E. Rose, the campus pastor at Eastern Illinois University and pastoral adviser to Mu chapter, moved to St. Louis in 1971 to succeed Dick Weiss as Executive Director. At the suggestion of several parents, Rev. Rose helped to form Phi Beta Chi Lutheran Sorority at the University of Illinois. For a time, he served as the executive director of both organizations and is recognized today as a founder of Phi Beta Chi. Phi Beta Chi has since formed several chapters and become a national sorority.\n\nBeta Sigma Psi faced major difficulties from the 1970s through the early 1990s. Around two-thirds of Beta Sig chapters closed during those years. Some closed as a result of the general decline in Greek communities throughout the country. Others closed due to pressures facing many fraternities at that time, including hazing or poor grades. Many closed because the chapter has lost a commitment to the principles of Beta Sigma Psi. The greatest challenge to the fraternity came when Delta chapter, which had the most initiated members of any Beta Sig chapter, was forced to close in 1994.\n\nNew leadership came from Craig Varner of Iota chapter, who was elected national president in 1996. Under his leadership, Beta Sigma Psi created an annual Membership Education Forum and revived its Leadership Academy. Expansion focus shifted from large universities to smaller colleges. With these changes, Beta Sigma Psi led all national fraternities in 1999 with a 97% increase in associate members from the previous academic year.\n\nDuring the first part of the 21st century, Beta Sigma Psi has continued to grow even as the Greek population continues to decline. Delta chapter was rechartered in 2006. The National Fraternity has hired full-time staff members to better serve its collegiate and alumni members. Commitment to the principles of Beta Sigma Psi has been emphasized among the chapters.\n\nThe future of the fraternity is in the hands of its members. Edgar Friedrichs, Beta Sigma Psi's first national president, once observed that \"Beta Sigma Psi was organized as a means of serving the Church – as a means to the end. Let us, therefore, be vigilant lest the means become an end in itself.\"\n\nThe following are the principles every member of Beta Sigma Psi strives to live up to:\n\nWith God's help I will strive to:\n\n\nWith the support and encouragement of the brotherhood within Beta Sigma Psi.\n\nLuther's Emblem – Luther's Emblem or seal consists of a black cross inside of a red heart inside of a rose and represents the Lutheran faith that is represented strongly in the men of Beta Sigma Psi. It is incorporated into the coat of arms and the badge.\n\nThe Badge\nThe Badge of Beta Sigma Psi consists of black cross contained in a heart which is superimposed on a gold rose (Luther's Emblem). The emblem is placed on a shield with the Greek letters Beta Sigma Psi in an arc above the rose. The variation of the badge includes eighteen pearls bordering the shield. The badge is worn by activated members of Beta Sigma Psi.\n\nThe Flag – The Flag of Beta Sigma Psi consists of the Coat of Arms set upon a field of Cardinal red and white with the letters in the upper left quadrant.\n\nThe Banner – The Banner of Beta Sigma Psi consists of the Coat of Arms set upon a field of Cardinal red and white.\n\nThe Gold Rose – The Gold Rose is the official flower of Beta Sigma Psi. The fraternity's national publication and yearly national formal are also named after the flower.\n\nThe organization of Beta Sigma Psi National Fraternity is unique. In order to divide the duties and services, three separate corporations or entities were formed, each with a specific mission, purpose, and Board of Directors. The three corporations are the National Fraternity, the Education Foundation, and the Housing Foundation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeta Sigma Psi Website\n\n"}

He was selected in 1562 as one of the three representatives of the king of France at the Council of Trent. In 1565 he became general advocate to the parlement of Paris, and extended the renaissance in jurisprudence which was transforming French justice.\n\nIn 1573 he was sent by Charles IX of France to accompany as chancellor his brother Henry (afterwards Henry III) to Poland, of which country Henry had been elected king. Pibrac's fluent Latin won much applause from the Poles, but his second visit to Poland in 1575, when sent back by Henry III to try to save the Crown he had deserted, was not so successful. Then he was employed in negotiations with the so-called \"politiques\", and he managed to keep them quiet for a while. In 1578 he became the chancellor of Marguerite of France, queen of Navarre. Although he was fifty, her beauty and intellectual gifts led him to aspire to win her affection; but he was rejected with disdain.\n\nHis oratorical style was rather pedantic, but quotations from the classics had a fresher meaning in his day. He was the friend of Ronsard, de Thou and l'Hôpital, and left, among other literary remains, elegant and sententious quatraines.\n"}

This hypothesis was published in 1911 and inspired the experimental work of Henry Moseley, who found good experimental evidence for it by 1913.\n\nVan den Broek was the son of a civil law notary and trained to be a lawyer himself. He studied at Leiden University and at the Sorbonne in Paris, obtaining a degree in 1895 in Leiden. From 1895 to 1900 he held a lawyers office in The Hague until 1900, after which he studied mathematical economy in Vienna and Berlin. However, from 1903 on, his main interest was physics. Much of the time between 1903 and 1911 he lived in France and Germany. Most of his papers he wrote between 1913 and 1916 while living in Gorssel. He married Elisabeth Margaretha Mauve in 1906, with whom he had five children.\n\nThe idea of the direct correlation of the charge of the atom nucleus and the periodic table was contained in his paper published in \"Nature\" on July 20, 1911, just one month after Rutherford published the results of his experiments that showed the existence of a small charged nucleus in an atom (see Rutherford model). However, Rutherford's original paper noted only that the charge on the nucleus was large, on the order of about half of the atomic weight of the atom, in whole number units of hydrogen mass. Rutherford on this basis made the tentative suggestion that atomic nuclei are composed of numbers of helium nuclei, each with a charge corresponding to half of its atomic weight. This would make the nuclear charge nearly equal to atomic number in smaller atoms, with some deviation from this rule for the largest atoms, such as gold. For example, Rutherford found the charge on gold to be about 100 units and thought perhaps that it might be exactly 98 (which would be close to half its atomic weight). But gold's place in the periodic table (and thus its atomic number) was known to be 79.\n\nThus Rutherford did not make the proposal that the number of charges in the nucleus of an atom might be \"exactly\" equal to its place on the periodic table (atomic number). This is the idea put forward by Van den Broek. The number of the place of an element in the periodic table (or atomic number) at that time was not thought by most physicists to be a physical property. It was not until the work of Henry Moseley working with the Bohr model of the atom with the explicit idea of testing Van den Broek's theory, that it was realized that atomic number was indeed a purely physical property (the charge of the nucleus) which could be measured, and that Van den Broek's original guess had been correct, or very close to being correct. Moseley's work actually found (see Moseley's law) the nuclear charge best described by the Bohr equation and a charge of \"Z\"-1, where \"Z\" is the atomic number. \n\nHenry Moseley, in his paper on atomic number and X-ray emission, mentions only the models of Rutherford and Van den Broek.\n\n"}

The book is, in reality, an intersectional, interdisciplinary analysis of the commission's potential and realized effects on post-Apartheid South Africa.\n\nThe book can be understood as having three main elements: First, it is a collection of accounts from the TRC hearings - direct testimony of the terrible human rights violations on all sides of the struggle against Apartheid. Second, it is an exploration and analysis of political and moral philosophy relevant to, inspired by, and grounded in the TRC (see President Nelson Mandela and Archbishop Desmond Tutu). Third, it is biographical, in terms of the author being extremely honest, open, and self-analytical about her own position and experience relative to the TRC - racially as a white Afrikaner, professionally as a radio journalist, emotionally as someone grappling with her nation's bloody past, and personally as her experiences covering the TRC affect her intimate life.\n\n\"Country of My Skull\" is written as an amalgamation of journalism, prose, personal narrative, and poetry - all of which Krog has been celebrated for - with the goal of capturing the overwhelming moral, emotional, and historical complexity of the Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa.\n\nIn 2004, the book was adapted into the film \"In My Country\" by director John Boorman starring Samuel L.

{"id": "2282667", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2282667", "title": "Mount Royal Tunnel", "text": "Mount Royal Tunnel\n\nThe Mount Royal Tunnel () is a railway tunnel in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The tunnel is the third longest in Canada, after the Mount Macdonald Tunnel and the Connaught Tunnel, and connects the city's Central Station, in Downtown Montreal, with the north side of Montreal Island and Laval and passes through Mount Royal.\n\nThe tunnel was originally proposed by the Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR) to provide access to Downtown Montreal without having to cross the already-congested area south of Mount Royal or the route around it to the east. The cost of the tunnel, along with an expansion to the west coast of Canada, caused CNoR to struggle financially before it was nationalized in 1918. Canadian National Railways (CNR), formed from CNoR and several other lines, took over the just-completed tunnel. When CNR also took over the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) in 1923, access to Ottawa and Toronto along the GTR lines made the tunnel largely redundant, and it was limited mostly to branch lines. The structure gauge of the Mount Royal Tunnel limits the height of bilevel cars to .\n\nUntil 2014, the only trains using the tunnel were commuter trains from Exo's Deux-Montagnes service. From December 2014 to May 2020, it was also used by the Mascouche line, which serves the northeastern part of Montreal Island and the suburbs of Repentigny, Terrebonne, and Mascouche. Exo also considered rerouting its Saint-Jérôme line to Central Station via the tunnel from its current termini at Parc or Lucien L'Allier to save 15 minutes.\n\nOn May 11, 2020, the Mount Royal Tunnel closed for a period of about three years. It is expected to reopen in 2022, exclusively for Réseau express métropolitain services.\n\nThe tunnel was conceived in 1910 by the Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR) as a means to give the company access to downtown Montreal. The only easy routes along the south side of Mount Royal had long been taken by rivals Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) and Grand Trunk Railway (GTR). CNoR wanted to avoid crossing the CPR and GTR lines. Likewise CNoR preferred a direct route as opposed to detouring the railway around the north and east sides of Mount Royal.\n\nTo finance the costly tunnel option, CNoR planned to develop the low-valued farmland north of Mount Royal into a model community which was named the Town of Mount Royal. CNoR also planned a downtown terminal and associated office and retail developments for low-priced lands at de la Gauchetière Street and McGill College Avenue. Several farms which grew the Montreal melon were bought by the builders to make way for the tracks: \"There were two years of preliminary bargaining, after which currency by the satchel full was paid over to the owners of the farms which made the Montreal melons famous, in the purchase of their land. More than $1,500,000 was paid out in that way, with currency, in the rush of land speculation that followed the announcement of the plan. One farmer was paid $117,000 and another\nfarm brought $781,783.\" \n\nIn 1911, the Canadian Northern Montreal Tunnel and Terminal Company was incorporated to build the tunnel and terminal. It was renamed Mount Royal Tunnel and Terminal Company in 1914, and was a wholly owned subsidiary of CNoR. Construction started at the west portal on July 8, 1912. On December 10, 1913, crews from the east and west portals met beneath Mount Royal; they were out of alignment by . The bore measures approximately and has an ascending grade of 0.6% westbound.\n\nCNoR placed an order with General Electric in 1914 for 6 boxcab electric-powered locomotives for use in the tunnel; they were delivered in 1916–1917. Both the locomotives and the electrification were very similar to those of the Butte, Anaconda and Pacific Railway. Lining of the tunnel bore with concrete was completed by 1916 and the 2 parallel standard gauge tracks and 2400 V DC catenary were installed by September 1918. Progress was slowed by the First World War and CNoR's ongoing financial difficulties by the mid-1910s. The first train, with locomotive 601 leading, ran through the tunnel October 21, 1918. The event was little-noticed due to the still-ongoing war and a ban on large public gatherings due to the Spanish flu epidemic.\nOn September 6, 1918, the insolvent CNoR was nationalized by the federal government when its board of directors was replaced by a government appointed board of management, implemented by the Department of Railways and Canals. At the same time, the newly appointed board at CNoR was directed to take over the operation of the government-owned Canadian Government Railways (CGR). On December 20, 1918, the Privy Council issued an order creating the Canadian National Railways (CNR) to operate CNoR, CGR and eventually other bankrupt private-sector railways. Ironically, the Grand Trunk became part of CNR in 1923, giving CNR better routes to Ottawa and Toronto and relegating the tunnel line to branch-line status. Nevertheless, it still remains an essential part of Montreal's regional transport system.\n\nCNR took over the Mount Royal Tunnel at the time of its completion, along with the virtually empty lands which CNoR's owners, Sir William Mackenzie and Sir Donald Mann, had envisioned would become a signature real estate development. CNR developed this area sporadically from the 1930s to the 1960s, interrupted by the Great Depression and the Second World War.\n\nA new terminal, begun in 1931, opened as Central Station on July 14, 1943, resulting in the closure of the \"temporary\" CNoR-era Tunnel Terminal near the same location. Central Station consolidated CNR's passenger terminals in the city and also replaced Bonaventure Station which CNR had inherited from GTR. In the late 1950s, the remainder of the CNoR lands acquired in downtown Montreal during the Mount Royal Tunnel project were developed by CNR. The signature Queen Elizabeth Hotel opened in 1958, followed by the CN (name/acronym change in 1960) headquarters building in 1961 and Place Ville-Marie in 1962.\n\nOn July 1, 1982, CN signed a 10-year agreement with STCUM whereby CN operated the line under contract to STCUM's commuter rail service. On February 12, 1992, Quebec's provincial government announced a $289 million modernization of the Mount Royal Tunnel line, including $130 million awarded to Bombardier for 58 new commuter rail cars. Stations, track, electrification and signalling systems were all upgraded, in addition to the tunnel structure itself.\n\nOn June 2, 1995, the last of the GE boxcab electric-powered locomotives delivered to CNoR in 1916–1917 for use in the tunnel were retired by CN after nearly 77 years of service. Locomotive 601, which in 1918 pulled the first train into the tunnel, under its final number as Canadian National 6711 pulled the last outbound train; on the return trip it assisted sister 6710. The old rolling stock was replaced by 58 state-of-the-art MR-90 electric multiple units built by Bombardier Transportation.\n\nUntil May 2020, commuter trains from Exo's Deux-Montagnes and Mascouche lines used the Mount-Royal Tunnel. Before 1995, Via Rail trains to/from Northern Quebec and the northern route to Quebec City (cancelled in 1990) also used the tunnel, being hauled up by boxcabs pre-1990, and coasting downhill. This practice was eliminated when the catenary and signalling were replaced in 1995. The old catenary was 3000 V DC (upgraded from the original 2400 V DC in the early 1980s) and the new catenary is 25 kV AC. The new signalling is CTC. The ventilation shaft is too small to allow the use of diesel electric locomotives in the tunnel.\n\nOn February 28, 2014, the Réseau de transport métropolitain's predecessor agency (AMT) and CN announced that the AMT had purchased the Deux-Montagnes line from CN for a sum of $97 million. The agreement gives CN trackage rights for freight trains outside two rush-hour exclusive time windows (08:30–15:30 and 20:30–05:30).\n\nAlso in the works is the double-tracking of the line from Bois-Franc to Roxboro-Pierrefonds, which will enable the RTM to significantly increase the number of trains on the line. Currently, there is a second track from Bois-Franc to slightly past Saraguay (about halfway between Bois-Franc and Sunnybrooke at the A13), but it is not electrified and is used by CN freight trains serving industries along Doney spur.\n\nOn December 1, 2014, the Mascouche line opened to passengers. The line uses the Deux-Montagnes line until Jonction de l’Est (between the Montpellier and Mont-Royal stations), where it turns onto the St-Laurent subdivision on the way to Mascouche. Trains are operated with the new dual-powered ALP-45DP locomotives, and are initially run under electric power to the Ahuntsic station where the changeover to diesel is done.\n\n\n"}

Created in 1966, it is to date the oldest event of its kind still active in Africa. Initially biennial alternating with the Carthage Theatre Festival, it became annual in 2014. A directing committee chaired by the Tunisian Ministry of Culture joined together with professionals of the cinema industry is in charge of the organization. \nThe Carthage Film Festival has been designed as a film festival engaged in the cause of African and Arab countries and enhancing the South cinema in general.\n\nThe main prize awarded is the Golden Tanit named after the Phoenician goddess Tanit. Opening and closing ceremonies are held in the Municipal Theater of Tunis.\n\nConceived by filmmaker Tahar Cheriaa and officially launched in 1966 by the Tunisian Minister of Culture, Chedli Klibi, this event, the first of its kind in the Arab world, is primarily intended to highlight the sub-Saharan African and Arab cinema, creating bridges of dialogue between North and South and offering a meeting between filmmakers and moviegoers of all sides. \nThus Klibi said:\n\nMany big names of African and Arab cinema received awards from Carthage before being recognized elsewhere, from the Senegalese Sembene Ousmane (Grand Prize 1966) through the Egyptian Youssef Chahine (Grand Prize 1970) and the Malian Souleymane Cissé (Grand Prize 1982), the Palestinian Michel Khleifi (Grand Prize 1988), Tunisians Nouri Bouzid, Ferid Boughedir, and Moufida Tlatli (Grand Prize 1986, 1990, 1994), the Syrian Mohammad Malas (Grand Prize 1992) to the Algerian Merzak Allouache (Grand Prize 1996).\n\nThe festival's social dimension is found in several Golden Tanit award-winning films, some sadly prophetic like \"Making Of\" (2006) by Nouri Bouzid, featuring Bahta, a 25-year-old unemployed and amateur break dancer recruited by extremists to commit a suicide attack.\n\nIt was at the Carthage Film Festival that FEPACI (Pan-African Federation of Filmmakers) was created in 1970, developing a foundation for South-South film cooperation.\n\nThe Conferences of the last sessions have emphasised the reputation of the event as a reservoir of ideas and gaining momentum, the Carthage Film festival has opened to the world and enriched its programming by hosting works from all backgrounds.\n\nTo better meet the expectations and needs of film professionals, the Carthage Film festival has expanded its scope of action with the introduction of various devices such as the Workshop Project, Master Class, and Producer's Network. Eminent personalities of the arts, writers, filmmakers, critics, have served as juries in various official competitions to award the prestigious Tanit. But the true constant of the Carthage Film Festival remains the adherence of an exceptional audience of loyal and passionate moviegoers. The festival is a real popular event which attracts crowds to theaters and creates in the city of Tunis a considerable animation. Rooted in its Arab and African specificity, this meeting of filmmakers, producers, critics, moviegoers North and South has manage to combine cinema, exchange and festive spirit.\n\nSince the Tunisian Revolution of 2011, the Carthage Film Festival further confirms Tunisia's proximity to Europe and its tradition of dialogue predestines it to become an indispensable hub for North-South and South-South film cooperation.\n\nThe official program includes several sections: the \"Official Competition\" and the \"Panorama section\" that are open to Arab and African films, the \"International section\" which is open to recent movies of high artistic quality, a \"Tribute section\" and a \"Workshop Projects\" designed to encourage the development of Arab and African films projects by granting \"help funds for scenario” and a competitive video section.\n\nThe official Selection \nThe various sections of the Official Competition of the Carthage Film festival each present 12 films.\n\nThe official competition for feature films: \nThis selection with three Tanit (Gold, Silver, Bronze) is the most visible part of the Carthage Film Festival and is the heart of the official selection. Twelve Arab and African films reflect the renewal of cinematographic expression and present original works singular in their aesthetic and their statements.\n\nThe official short film competition: \nAs well as the competition dedicated to feature films, this selection allows to dedicate three Arab and African fiction films in short format (less than 30 minutes).\n\nThe documentary competition \nA Golden Tanit awards the best documentary among twelve Arab and African films. The Prize Tahar Cheriaa for a first work: The Golden Tanit \"Tahar Cheriaa\" awards the first work of a filmmaker presented in the official selection: official Competition, competition of the first Arab and African film.\n\nCarthage Ciné-Foundation: \nThis international selection of twelve school films embodies the diversity of young artists and announces the trends of the future world cinema. A film will be awarded by the international jury.\n\nParallel sections\n\nNew Territories\n\nThis program aims to be a window on recent suggested films, the most innovative and subversive, the most radical and marginal, in a word, on new aesthetic and political experiences, far from any commercial format, media or festival. It seeks to submit the continually renewed ability of cinema to house within it both the issues of its time, the questions of those who make it and their contemporaries as well as the shifting of its artistic, formal and technological expression.\n\nTribute\nEach edition pays tribute to a Tunisian filmmaker and several international filmmakers offering the public a retrospective of their films or debates meetings inspired by their career.\n\nCarthage professional\nTakmil\nThe Takmil workshop, namely \"finish\" in Arabic, which is in its second edition, aims to allows African and Arab films in post-production phase to be evaluated by an international jury of cinema professionals. For three days, working copies are viewed by the jury in the presence of the filmmakers which films have been selected. Screenings will be followed by a discussion allowing each participant to defend his film and benefit from an expertise. \nThe workshop Takmil also aims to be a platform offering visibility to young African and Arab filmmaking. Visibility that will result in particular by the screening of the winning films, an African and Arab premiere during the Carthage Film Festival session following their finishing.\n\nProducers Network \nThe Producers Network hosts Arab and African producers present at the Carthage Film Festival and allows international film professionals to benefit from a series of meetings and specific events designed to encourage international co-production and optimize networking. \nWith a 48-hour program, the Producers Network offers real opportunities to meet with potential partners with financing, co-production, distribution needs...\n\nThe Carthage Film Festival in regions\n\nSince the 2014 session, the Carthage Film Festival has moved between different Tunisian cities. In 2015 ten cities are hosting the festival: Jendouba, Sfax, Mahdia, Tataouine, Nabeul, Béja, Kef, Kairouan, Gafsa and Monastir. The films are divided into three main sections:\n\n"}

It is owned by Radio One and airs an urban adult contemporary radio format. In afternoon drive time, WRNB carries the syndicated D. L. Hughley Show.\n\nWRNB's studios and offices are located in Bala Cynwyd, with the transmitter located in the Roxborough neighborhood of Philadelphia at (). The station is short-spaced with two other co-channel FM stations (see See § Signal note below).\n\nIn the 1940s, 100.3 FM first went on the air in Philadelphia as KYW-FM, the sister station to KYW. KYW-FM later moved to 92.5 MHz. In 1962, WXUR-FM signed on, licensed to the suburban community of Media. It was powered at only 4,200 watts, simulcasting the Christian programming of its sister station WXUR (now WPHE in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania). WXUR-AM-FM were owned by Carl McIntire, a Bible Presbyterian minister. In 1973, the Federal Communications Commission revoked the licenses for both stations, with the FCC ruling that WXUR-AM-FM violated the Fairness Doctrine, refusing to air competing viewpoints. The 100.3 frequency then went dark for eight years. \n\nIn 1981, after a seven-year comparative hearing, the FCC awarded the license to the Greater Media Radio Company, owned by Daniel Lerner. The name referred to the station's city of license, Media, and was not associated with the larger Greater Media, Inc., which locally owned WMGK, WPEN and other stations around the U.S. On November 8, 1982, 100.3 FM returned to the air, this time as WKSZ, \"Kiss 100,\" with a soft adult contemporary format. By 1987, Kiss 100 was the #1 Arbitron-ranked station among women ages 25 to 54. \n\nIn the early 1990s, however, the battle for AC listeners heated up, with WEAZ (now WBEB) becoming the dominant station for soft music in Philadelphia. Kiss 100 lost ground in the ratings, falling to 17th place in 1992. WKSZ tried to combine AC and oldies with what the station called the \"50/50 Mix.\" This failed to turn ratings around, and in 1993, Kiss 100 returned to a playlist of AC love songs.\n\nOn March 15, 1993, at 6 a.m., with the station still struggling, WKSZ became \"Z100,\" flipping to a Top 40 format. The flip came three days after Eagle 106 gave up Top 40 and switched to smooth jazz, creating an opening which WKSZ hoped to fill. New York's WHTZ, located on the same frequency of 100.3 MHz, and calling itself \"Z100\" since 1983, demanded that WKSZ drop the name to avoid listener confusion. After a brief legal battle, the call sign and name were changed to WPLY, \"Y100.\" The station initially had a slight alternative rock lean, but still played other Top 40 hits, including pop and dance. By early 1995, WPLY evolved into a full time modern rock format, which lasted nearly ten years. Through the late 1990s, Y100 leaned towards Modern AC, and would shift towards an active rock lean in 2000. \n\nIn 2000, the station was bought by Radio One for $80 million. Radio One focuses mostly on urban music and didn't plan to program an alternative rock station. The company tried to make a deal to swap formats with Greater Media's WEJM (now WBEN-FM), which, at the time, ran a rhythmic oldies format called \"Jammin Gold,\" which would have better fit into Radio One's portfolio. The deal fell through, and Radio One continued to run Y100 as a modern rock station for nearly five years. While ratings had gone down, the station still was moderately successful.\n\nOn February 24, 2005, at 11:50 p.m., Y100 ended its alternative rock format. WPHI, an urban contemporary station at 103.9 MHz, also owned by Radio One and known as \"103.9 The Beat,\" moved to 100.3 FM. The station at 103.9, in turn, flipped to urban gospel as WPPZ-FM, \"Praise 103.9.\" The last song on \"Y100\" was \"Alive\" by Pearl Jam (which was also the first and last song on WDRE). By 2006, Nielsen BDS/Radio & Records moved WPHI to the urban contemporary panel. Mediabase followed suit in 2011. WPHI-FM's chief rival was WUSL, which had been Philadelphia's long-time Urban Contemporary leader.\n\nIn fall 2005, former rival personality Colby Colb was hired as the Program Director and afternoon host. For the next few years, 100.3 The Beat enjoyed high ratings, helped by Miss Jones in the morning and Colby Colb in the afternoon. Monie Love and Pooch took over mornings in 2005, with other disc jockeys on the station including Micheal Shawn, DJ Touchtone, DJ Jay Ski, Megatron, DJ Bent Rock, Moshay, Toshamakia, DJ JDS, Laiya and Hansoul. In late 2010, WPHI-FM became the Philadelphia home of the Star and Buc Wild Morning Show, syndicated from New York City. The show had actually been heard in Philadelphia in early 2006 on WUSL but had drawn some controversy and was dropped. \n\nOn August 27, 2011, WPHI dropped the \"Beat\" moniker for \"100.3 Philly.\" Radio One was preparing to make another frequency switch, this time moving 107.9 WRNB to 100.3 MHz on September 1st. WRNB was simulcast on both 100.3 and 107.9 until September 2nd, when the WPHI call sign moved to 107.9, adopted the former \"Beat\" format and rebranded as \"Hot 107.9.\" (WRNB would continue to air an Urban AC format after the move.)\n\nOn March 29, 2013, WRNB went jockless and began promoting a \"big announcement\" at 5 p.m. on April 1st. At that time, after playing \"Keep Your Head to the Sky\" by Earth, Wind, & Fire, WRNB flipped to urban oldies as \"Old School 100.3.\" The first song on \"Old School\" was \"Atomic Dog\" by George Clinton. \n\nThe format played Motown, disco, funk, new jack swing, freestyle, and early hip hop from the 1960s to the early 2000s. The new format was designed to better compete with the dominant Urban AC station in Philadelphia, WDAS-FM.\n\nIn November 2014, sister station WPHI moved to a classic hip-hop format. In response, WRNB re-added some current music, although the station continued to focus on older urban hits.\n\nOn October 6, 2016, WRNB moved back to urban adult contemporary music, once more calling itself \"100.3 WRNB,\" and dropping the \"Old School\" reference.\nBeginning in the 1950s, the call sign WRNB was licensed to North Carolina's first full-time rock 'n roll radio station, a 1000-watt outlet in New Bern located at AM 1490 (now sports radio WWNB). WRNB 1490 was also famous for being one of the first radio stations to play Carolina Beach Music.\n\nWRNB is short-spaced to two other co-channel Class B stations: WHTZ \"Z100\" (licensed to serve Newark, New Jersey) and WBIG-FM \"Big 100\" (licensed to serve Washington, D.C.). The cities WRNB and WHTZ are licensed to serve are only 86 miles apart, while the cities WRNB and WBIG-FM are licensed to serve are only 112 miles apart. The minimum distance between two Class B stations operating on the same channel according to current FCC rules is 150 miles.\n\n"}

If correct, this would make Siptah and Seti II half-brothers since both of them were sons of Merneptah.\n\nHe was not the crown prince, but succeeded to the throne as a child after the death of Seti II. His accession date occurred on I Peret day 2 around the month of December.\n\nHistorically, it was believed that Tiaa, a wife of Seti II, was the mother of Siptah. This view persisted until it was eventually realized that a relief in the Louvre Museum (E 26901) \"pairs Siptah's name together with the name of his mother\" a certain Sutailja or Shoteraja.\n\nSutailja was a Canaanite rather than a native Egyptian name which means that she was almost certainly a king's concubine from Canaan. However, Dodson/Hilton assert that this is not correct and that the lady was, instead, the mother of Ramesses-Siptah and a wife of Ramesses II.\n\nThe identity of his father is currently unknown; some Egyptologists speculate it may have been Amenmesse rather than Seti II since both Siptah and Amenmesse spent their youth in Chemmis and both are specifically excluded from Ramesses III's Medinet Habu procession of statues of ancestral kings unlike Merneptah or Seti. This suggests that Amenmesse and Siptah were inter-related in such a way that they were \"regarded as illegitimate rulers and that therefore they were probably father and son.\" However, another interpretation here is that Siptah was regarded as illegitimate by the later 20th dynasty kings since Siptah required the assistance of Chancellor Bay to secure the kingship since he was just another minor son of Merneptah rather than a direct son of Seti II.\n\nA headless statue of Siptah now in Munich shows him seated on the lap of another Pharaoh, presumably his father. The British Egyptologist Aidan Dodson states \nIf Siptah was a son of Seti II, it is unlikely that he would have been considered as an illegitimate king by later 20th Dynasty New Kingdom pharaohs. Due to his youth and perhaps his problematic parentage, he was placed under the guidance of his stepmother—the queen regent Twosret.\n\nSiptah ruled Egypt for almost 6 years as a young man. Siptah was only a child of ten or eleven years when he assumed power since a medical examination of his mummy reveals the king was about 16 years old at death. He was tall at 1.6 metres and had curly reddish brown hair and likely suffered from polio with a severely deformed and crippled left foot.\n\nChancellor Bay publicly boasts that he was instrumental in installing Siptah on the throne in several inscriptions including an Aswan stela set up by Seti, the Viceroy of Kush and at Gebel el-Silsila. A key graffito located at the entrance to the Speos of Horemheb at Gebel el-Silsila depicts Bay standing in a pose of adoration directly behind Siptah, who is making an offering to Amun; a following inscription in the graffito reads:\n\nBay, however, later fell out of favor at court presumably for overreaching himself and last appears in public in a dated Year 4 inscription from Siptah's reign. He was executed in the fifth year of Siptah's reign, on orders of the king himself. News of his execution was passed to the Workmen of Deir el-Medina in Ostraca IFAO 1254. This ostraca was translated and published in 2000 by Pierre Grandet in a French Egyptological journal. Callendar notes that the reason for the king's message to the workmen was to notify them to cease all work on decorating Bay's tomb since Bay had now been deemed a traitor to the state.\n\nSiptah himself is last attested sometime in his 6th regnal Year on a graffito located at the South Temple of Buhen. He likely died in the middle of II Akhet—perhaps around II Akhet 12 of his 6th Year. This assumes a traditional 70-day mummification period if Siptah was buried on IV Akhet 22.\n\nEvidence for his burial on the latter date is recorded in ostracon O. Cairo CG 25792. This ostraca from Deir el-Medina mentions that the Vizier Hori visited the workmen of Deir el-Medina first on II Akhet 24 and second on IV Akhet 19. The final line on the ostracon reads as: \"IV Akhet 22: Burial took place\". Since this event can only refer to a king's burial, the question here is the identity of this king.\n\nHori was appointed vizier around \"Regnal Year 6 II Shemu 6 and I Peret [X]\" of Seti II's reign and held this office through the reigns of Siptah, Twosret and Setnakht and into that of Ramesses III. The ostracon could not refer to Setnakht's death because this king died on I Shemu 25 since his son, Ramesses III succeeded him the next day. Twosret was ousted from power by Setnakht; therefore, the burial does not refer to her either.\n\nSeti II must have died in late IV Akhet or early I Peret—after the 70-day mummification period—since a graffito located above KV14, Twosret's tomb, records his burial on III Peret 11. Therefore, the IV Akhet 22 burial date likely records the burial of Siptah himself. Siptah's death would have occurred sometime around II Akhet 12. Siptah himself would have ruled Egypt for approximately 5 years and 10 months since his predecessor, Seti II, died around the end of IV Akhet and the beginning of I Peret, even if he did not legally assume the throne until the start of II Akhet with the aid of the powerful court official Bay.\n\nAfter his death, Twosret simply assumed his Regnal Years and ruled Egypt as a queen for a year or two at the most. Siptah was buried in the Valley of the Kings, in tomb KV47, but his mummy was not found there. In 1898, it was discovered along with 18 others in a mummy cache within the (KV35) tomb of Amenhotep II. The study of his tomb shows that it was conceived and planned in the same style as those of Twosret and Bay, clearly part of the same architectural design.\n\n"}

He was an attendant to Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos, \"protovestiarites\" (\"Lord of the Imperial Wardrobe\") under John VIII Palaiologos, and a close confidant to Constantine XI Palaiologos. He was an eyewitness of the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, made a slave by the victorious Turks, but ransomed shortly afterwards. Sphrantzes served the surviving members of the Palaiologian family for the next several years until taking monastic vows in 1472. It was while a monk he wrote his history, which ends with the notice of Sultan Mehmed II's attempt to capture Naupaktos, which he dates to the summer of 1477; Sphrantzes is assumed to have died not long after that event.\n\nHe was born in Constantinople, during the Turkish blockade of that city; his godmother was the nun Thomais. In 1418 he was appointed attendant to Emperor Manuel. During his service to the Emperor Manuel, Sphrantzes did many favors for Constantine, developing a strong rapport with the future Emperor for, as he writes, \"my uncle had been his tutor and my cousins and I were his companions, friends, and attendants.\" After the death of Manuel, he became the servant of Constantine and left with him 26 December 1427 when Constantine was appointed Despot of the Morea. \n\nWhen they arrived in the Morea, Constantine made him governor of Glarentza, and Sphrantzes assisted Constantine in the latter's efforts to conquer the remainder of the Morea, but was captured 26 March 1429 in a skirmish outside of Patras and held prisoner until his relationship to Constantine was recognized, and he was paroled back to the Byzantine side to negotiate surrender of the citadel. While traveling to Epirus as an ambassador, to help arbitrate a peace between Carlo II Tocco and his uncle's illegitimate sons over the succession to rule over Epirus, he was kidnapped by Catalan pirates, along with his retinue, and held at Cephalonia until the pirates took the group back to Glarentza where they were ransomed. Upon returning to Constantinople, he was made \"protovestiarites\" and appointed ambassador by the Emperor.\n\nAfter this point, Sphrantzes was a key supporter of Constantine. He attempted to secure Athens for his master in 1435; he negotiated Constantine's second marriage with Caterina Gattilusio in 1440; he was appointed prefect of Mistras in 1446; and most importantly he was sent on an embassy to Georgia and the Empire of Trebizond in search of a third wife for Emperor Constantine. During these duties he married Helena, the daughter of the imperial secretary Alexios Palaiologos Tzamplakon, and the Emperor Constantine was his best man. He was preparing to take his son John (and the larger part of his portable wealth) to the Morea, then to Cyprus, traveling by land \"so that my son could visit the places and learn all those things which would be of use in his life\" when the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II began his siege of Constantinople.\n\nDespite being involved in the defense of the city, George Sphrantzes' account of the siege and capture of Constantinople in 1453 lacks much detail. About the death of Emperor Constantine, he writes simply, \"in this capture my late master and emperor, Lord Constantine, was killed. I was not at his side at that hour but had been inspecting another part of the City, according to his orders.\" Sphrantzes was captured and made a slave, but was ransomed 1 September 1453 then made his way to Mistras. There he obtained protection at the court of Thomas Palaiologos, Despot of the Morea. He managed to go to Adrianople in 1454, ransom his wife, and return to the Morea, while evading the Sultan Mehmed. He served as an ambassador to Venice on behalf of Thomas Palaiologos in 1455. After the downfall of the Peloponnesian Despotate (1460) Sphrantzes retired to the monastery of Tarchaneiotes in Corfu.\n\nBy Helena, he had five children, of whom two sons died in infancy, a third son Alexios died at the age of 5, while John and his only daughter Thamar lived to adulthood; the Emperor Constantine was godfather to both John and Thamar. Following the capture of Constantinople both children had become slaves of some elderly Turks, along with his wife Helena, who treated them well, and then were sold to the Sultan's Mir Ahor, or Master of Horse. However, before Sphrantzes could ransom them from the Mir Ahor, the Sultan learned of them and bought them. \"Thus their wretched mother was left all alone in the company of a single nurse,\" Sphrantzes writes. Sphrantzes records he learned of his son's death, at the age of 14 years and a day short of eight months, December 1453. Much later did Sphrantzes learn of his daughter Thamar's death in the Imperial Harem September 1455, aged 14 years and five months.\n\nAt the monastery he wrote his \"Chronicle\" (Χρονικόν), which, like most Byzantine chronicles, begins with the creation of the world but is more detailed when talking of the history of the House of the Palaiologoi from 1258 to 1476. It is a very valuable authority for the events of his own times. The distinctive traits of his work are loyalty to the Palaiologoi -- Sphrantzes often exaggerated their merits and suppressed their defects -- hatred of the Turks, and devotion to Orthodoxy. Steven Runciman described his work as \"honest, vivid and convincing\" and that Sphrantzes \"wrote good Greek in an easy unpretentious style.\"\n\nThere are editions by I. Bekker (1838) in the \"Corpus scriptorum hist. byz.\", and in J. P. Migne, \"Patrologia graeca, clvi\". The most recent critical edition of Sphrantzes is by Vasile Grecu (Bucharest, 1966), which appeared with a Romanian translation. Sphrantzes was also translated into German in 1954, and into English by Marios Philippides (Amherst, 1980). There is an edition with Italian translation by R. Maisano, Rome 1990 (CFHB 29).\n\nFor centuries it was believed that Sphrantzes wrote two works, one the \"Minor Chronicle\" and the other the \"Major Chronicle\". The \"Major Chronicle\" is more detailed particularly about the siege of Constantinople. But, beginning in 1934, the research of such scholars as J.B. Falier-Papadopoulos, Franz Dölger, and Raymond-Joseph Loenertz demonstrated that the \"Major Chronicle\" was written decades later by Makarios Melissenos (\"Pseudo-Sphrantzes\"), a priest who fled to Naples from a Greek-Venetian island conquered by the Ottomans. Why Melissenos selected Sphrantzes to elaborate and expand upon is not clear.\n\n\n"}

It passes underneath what is now Brockville City Hall, built in 1863–64 as the Victoria Hall, but remodelled after 1904. It was built by the Brockville and Ottawa Railway. The tunnel was designed to provide a rail link from the timber trade of the Ottawa Valley to the Brockville port facilities on the St. Lawrence River ship route.\n\nThe Brockville and Ottawa Railway, incorporated in 1853, ran from Brockville, through Smiths Falls, to Sand Point, near Arnprior, with a branch line from Smiths Falls to Perth. Its first B&OR train left Brockville on January 25, 1859, almost two years before finances permitted completion of the tunnel. The Brockville and Ottawa Railway amalgamated in 1878 with the Canada Central Railway, which was absorbed in 1881 by the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR).\n\nThe rail line through the tunnel was later used by special height-shortened steam engines, and then diesel trains into the mid-1970s. The rails and ties were then sold and removed in the 1980s, and the railway tunnel was no longer used as it was built. In 1982, the tunnel was turned over to the City of Brockville by Marathon Realty, the real-estate wing of the Canadian Pacific Railway.\n\nIn 2016–17, the railway tunnel underwent a major interior rehabilitation to make it possible to travel safely through it on foot. Visitors can now walk from the south portal to the north portal, exiting at the north-end gorge and up a ramp to street level. Prior to the rehabilitation visitors were only able to enter at the south portal and walk a short distance underground.\n\nThe railway tunnel has received thousands of visitors since it opened completely on August 12, 2017. It now features a modern LED coloured light system, which is programmed in various ways, along with a recorded music track playing while one walks through.\n\nAdjacent to the tunnel is a refurbished CPR caboose or van, that was donated in 1987 to the city by the Canadian Pacific Railway. A detailed plaque, in both English and French, describes the details and story of how cabooses were formerly part of every train. Today the caboose operates as an escape room experience.\n\n"}

VEE originally stood for Visual Engineering Environment and developed by HP designated as HP VEE; it has since been officially renamed to Keysight VEE. Keysight VEE has been widely used in various industries, serving the entire stage of a product lifecycle, from design, validation to manufacturing. It is optimized in instrument control and automation with test and measurement devices such as data acquisition instruments like digital voltmeters and oscilloscopes, and source devices like signal generators and programmable power supplies.\n\nA detailed list of features for each version can be found under the References section.\n\nA VEE program consists of multiple connected VEE objects (sometimes called devices). Each VEE object consists of different types of pins, namely data pins, sequence pins, execute pins (XEQ), control pins and error pins. Data pins govern the data flow propagation while sequence pins determine object execution order.\n\nThe pins on the left side of an object are called input pins, whereas the pins on the right are output pins. Two objects, A and B, are connected if the output pin of object A is connected to object B’s input pin. Several connection lines can emanate from a single output pin, but at most one connection line can be attached to an input pin. All data input pins and execute pins must be connected, whereas control pins and output pins can be left unconnected.\n\nKeysight VEE is a dataflow programming language. Within a VEE program, there are multiple connections between objects and data flows through objects from left to right while sequence flows from top to bottom. \nAn object’s execution order is determined by object connections and the data dependency rule. In general, an object with unconnected data input and sequence input pin will operate first. \nIf an object's sequence input pin is not connected, it will execute as soon as data is present on all data inputs. On the other hand, if a sequence input pin is connected, although data is present on all data input pins, the object will hold its execution until the sequence input pin is pinged. This may not be applicable to some non-primitive objects like the Junction and Collector objects. \nFor example, if object A’s sequence output pin is connected, it will fire only after object A has executed and no further execution is possible in the objects descended from the data output pins and error pin of object A.\nSome examples are taken from and can be referred to for further explanation.\n\nKeysight VEE can connect and control a variety of Keysight and non-Keysight instrumentation via multiple interfaces. Keysight VEE supports the following interfaces:\n\nKeysight VEE can interact with other programming languages using the built-in ActiveX Automation Server. Other software development programs such as Visual Basic, C/C++, Visual C# and all .NET compliant languages can call Keysight VEE UserFunctions. Keysight VEE is also integrated with Microsoft .NET Framework (Common Language Runtime and Framework Class Libraries) that provides a multitude of functions and controls that can be used to enhance a program such as adding email capability and accessing databases.\nAccess to over 2500 MATLAB analysis and visualization functions is made possible with the built-in MATLAB Signal Processing Toolbox. The built-in Microsoft Excel library provides direct access to save, retrieve and generate reports in spreadsheets.\n\nKeysight VEE is notable for its capability to deploy unlimited number of runtime programs with no time limitations at no extra cost. These runtime programs could contain a GUI panel and allows interaction with users, presumably operators to execute and control the program and the test execution.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2282767", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2282767", "title": "Bude-Light", "text": "Bude-Light\n\nA Bude-Light was a very bright oil lamp (later, in its modified form, a gas lamp) invented by Sir Goldsworthy Gurney, patented by him on 8 June 1839 and named after Bude, Cornwall, where he lived.\n\nAs first developed, the light worked by introducing pure oxygen into the centre of an Argand burner. It was claimed to be a cheap way of producing a bright light: the unburned carbon in the oil flame burned incredibly brightly and an intense, white light was produced from the weak yellow flame of the oil lamp. In 1838, Gurney reported the results of his initial tests to Michael Faraday, who recommended the proposal to Trinity House for possible use in lighthouses. It was trialled on an experimental basis in Orford Low Lighthouse in 1839, where its flame was observed to be 2.5 times as powerful as a flame of the same size on a conventional oil lamp; its use in lighthouses was not pursued, however, due to high running costs.\n\nThe chair of the parliamentary lighthouse committee, however, Joseph Hume, was involved in the reconstruction of the Palace of Westminster at the time and saw a potential opportunity for their use there. In May of 1839, he presented his lamp to a select committee of the House of Commons; subsequently their use was trialled in the temporary Chamber of the House of Commons (at the time the Chamber was unsatisfactorily lit by large numbers of 15-inch candles, earlier experiments with both Argand lamps and gas lighting having thus far failed).\n\nGurney had claimed (and already demonstrated) that his Bude-Lamp would cost the same to manufacture as a similarly-sized Argand lamp, and yet would produce a light more than twice as powerful while burning a quarter as much oil. There were setbacks during the trials, however: it proved difficult to trim the wicks satisfactorily, without interrupting debates, and managing the flexible tubes which provided the oxygen feed further complicated this procedure. Moreover, obtaining pure oxygen (which Gurney had sought to source from Manganese being mined in Devon and Cornwall) proved to be less straightforward and much more expensive than first thought.\n\nHe therefore began to modify his design, convinced that, by doing so, he would be able to create an 'Atmospheric' Bude-Lamp: by substituting air for oxygen with little detrimental effect. To eliminate the need for maintaining a wick, he explored using coal gas in place of oil. He purified the gas, and impregnated it with vapours of naphtha, turpentine and India rubber; this was then fed through a set of concentric burners designed 'to communicate by conduction and radiation sufficient heat to raise the temperature of the gas to a given point, so as to effect the separation of its charcoal immediately on its leaving the burner, and then […] to bring fresh atmospheric air to the proper points of the flame'. The chemical changes brought about by this precision mechanical arrangement achieved 'an effulgence adequate to every purpose of internal and external illumination'. Self-regulating Atmospheric Bude-Lamps (enclosed in airtight glass containers, with eduction tubes to remove the fumes and heat) were soon successfully installed in the temporary Commons chamber (and operated 'at a cost of only twelve shillings per night, whereas that of the candles previously used there amounted to six pounds eleven shillings per night'); and indeed their use was promptly extended to the parliamentary libraries, lobbies and one of the committee rooms. Gurney went on to market the lamps for use in churches, public buildings, private residences and shops.\n\nDespite his pioneering work in Parliament, however, responsibility for lighting the rebuilt Palace of Westminster was instead divided (for an experimental period) between arch-rivals Sir Charles Barry and Dr David Reid; both their systems proved unsatisfactory, however, and in 1853 Gurney's system was installed. It effectiveness was proved, to the satisfaction of both the Lords and the Commons, and the following year Gurney was placed in sole charge, not only of the lighting but also of heating and ventilating the entire building. His Bude-Light system stayed in use in the Houses of Parliament for over 50 years.\n\nIn the small seaside resort town of Bude a commemorative installation, also referred to as the Bude Light, was erected to mark the millennium and remember Sir Goldsworthy Gurney. Designed by Carole Vincent and Anthony Fanshawe, it is lit internally with fibre-optics and has a small seating area positioned around the light.\n"}

It has been synthesized using non-aqueous solutions. It is assumed to be present when silicon dioxide (silica) dissolves in water at a millimolar concentration level.\n\nThe term \"silicic acid\" has traditionally been used as a synonym for silica, SiO. Strictly speaking, silica is the anhydride of orthosilicic acid, Si(OH). \nThe solubility of silicon dioxide in water strongly depends on its crystal structure. The solubility of amorphous silica at the vapor pressure of solutions from 0 to 250 C is given by the equation\nwhere C is the silica concentration in mg kg and T is absolute temperature in K. This equates to a maximum solubility of about 2 mmol L at ambient temperatures. Attempts to produce more concentrated solutions result in the formation of silica gel. Because the concentration of orthosilicic acid in water is so low, the compounds that are present in solution have not been fully characterized. Linus Pauling predicted that silicic acid would be a very weak acid. \nThe situation changed in 2017, when the orthosilicic acid monomer was obtained by hydrogenolysis of tetrakis(benzoyloxy)silane, (Si(OCHCH), in solution in dimethylacetamide or related solvents. The crystal structure of this compound was determined by X-ray crystallography. Neutron diffraction was also used to determine the location of the hydrogen atoms. Di-silicic acid was synthesized by hydrogenation of its hexa-benzoyloxy derivative, R-SiOSi-R, R=CHCHO. Cyclic trisilicic acid, SiO(OH) and cyclic tetrasilicic acid, SiO(OH) were synthesized by variations of this method.\n\nWith these new discoveries, the term silicic acid has become ambiguous: in addition to the traditionally use as a synonym for silica, SiO, it can now be used for the compound Si(OH). The traditional usage is retained in this article for quotes from cited publication which use it.\n\nThe derivative Si(OH)F has been characterized in aqueous solutions containing silicic acid and the fluoride ion. \nA fluoride Ion selective electrode was used to determine its stability constant.\n\nIn the uppermost water column the surface ocean is undersaturated with respect to dissolved silica, except for the Antarctic Circumpolar Current south of 55°S. The dissolved silica concentration increases with increasing water depth, and along the conveyor belt from the Atlantic over the Indian into the Pacific Ocean.\n\nTheoretical computations indicate that the dissolution of silica in water proceeds begins with the formation of a ·2 complex, which is converted to orthosilicic acid.\n\nThe biogeochemical silica cycle is regulated by the algae known as the diatoms. These algae polymerise the silicic acid to so-called biogenic silica, which is used to construct their cell walls (called frustules).\n\nOutside the marine environment compounds of silicon have very little biological function. Small quantities of silica are absorbed from the soil by some plants, to be then excreted in the form of phytoliths.\n\nSubcutaneous injections of orthosilicic acid solutions (around 1%) in mice were found to cause local inflammation and edema. Peritoneal injections of 0.1 mL of freshly prepared acid were often lethal. The toxicity decreased markedly as the solution aged, to the point that after the solution turned to a gel it had no effects other than mechanical ones. The solutions were equally toxic when administed by intravenous injection, but seasoned or gelled solutions were about as toxic as fresh ones.\n\nResearch concerning the correlation of aluminium and Alzheimer's disease has included the ability of silicic acid in beer to reduce aluminium uptake in the digestive system as well as to increase renal excretion of aluminium. \n\nCholine-stabilized orthosilicic acid (ch-OSA) is a dietary supplement. It has been shown to prevent the loss of tensile strength in human hair; to have a positive effect on the surface and mechanical properties of skin, and on the brittleness of hair and nails; to abate brittle nail syndrome; to partially prevent femoral bone loss in aged ovariectomized rats; to increase the concentration of collagen in calves; and to have a potentially beneficial effect on the formation of collagen in the bones of osteopenic women.\n"}

It was repaired in the 14th century, from which time date the remains of two gates on the southern side.\n\nThe original castle was built shortly after 756 AD by emir Abd ar-Rahman I of Córdoba, as part of a state (\"dawla\") policy to control rich landowners and peasants, as well as to try to govern and protect the Central Marches in the Douro Valley against the Christians to the North. In 965, Caliph al-Hakem II rebuilt and expanded the castle, as attested by an inscription over one of the gates.\n\nGormaz not only controls a contemporary bridge on the Duero, but it is in an area rich, in all directions, in watch-towers also of the middle of the 8th century AD and with some land-owners' towers such as the one that now serves as the belfry of the church of Bordecorex.\n\nThe area is rich in relics from this period, near to Sepúlveda and Segovia to the West, Ágreda to the East, Berlanga de Duero to the Southeast.

Congdon was principally a batsman but also became a useful medium-pace bowler midway through his career.\n\nHis finest moments in Tests were in England in 1973 when he scored 176 at Trent Bridge and 175 at Lord's in successive Tests, and during the determined foray by the Kiwis to the West Indies in 1972, when he took over the captaincy from Graham Dowling.

It carries the Autoroute 25 expressway and passes beneath the main shipping channel in the Saint Lawrence River immediately downstream from the Saint Lawrence Seaway. It surfaces on Île Charron (Îles de Boucherville at entrance/exit #1 of Autoroute 25), then continues by bridge to Longueuil.

Its construction began in 1963 and it opened on March 11, 1967.\n\nIn 1960, the construction of the Trans-Canada Highway (TCH) through Quebec from the Ontario border to Rivière-du-Loup was announced. In Montreal, to avoid having to build a huge bridge that would have disfigured the city and destroyed a neighbourhood, engineers opted for the construction of a tunnel located under the Saint Lawrence River and dug a trench under the river bed and buried the tunnel sections to under the river bed.\n\nThe Longue-Pointe church had to be demolished to make way for the tunnel, and 300 families were expropriated from the village in 1964. The construction was completed in March 1967, just before the opening of Expo 67. Construction cost $75 million.\n\nA major four-year refurbishment of the tunnel is slated to begin in 2020.\n\nEach of the seven tunnel sections weighs , is long, wide and rises to a height of . In total, the bridge–tunnel is long.\n\nThe tunnel was built with sections prefabricated in dry dock and then sunk in the river, below the surface of the water.\n\nIt is one of the largest prestressed concrete structures in the world and is the longest bridge-tunnel in Canada.\n\n\n"}

His albums are composed and produced solely by him, and he usually performs live sets on his own, using preset loops or creating them as he plays.\n\nEven Johansen was born, raised, and resides in Bergen, Norway, but he has also lived just outside the southern Scottish town of Lockerbie, where he recorded his \"On Your Side\" album. Initially, Even was a founding member of the Norwegian rock bands Libido and Chocolate Overdose. During his involvement with Libido, Even conceived a series of songs he thought were inappropriate for the band. His first solo album, \"Quiet & Still\", was released in 2000 under the alias Magnet (in the United States, the album was released under his real name). The name \"Magnet\" originated from when Even was a child with anemia; he was prescribed a special magnetic tattoo on his left shoulder so it could attract iron.\n\nMagnet's second album \"On Your Side\" was released in June 2003 on Ultimate Dilemma to positive critical acclaim. The album features Magnet's duet with Irish singer-songwriter Gemma Hayes on a cover of Bob Dylan's \"Lay Lady Lay\", which was later featured in the 2005 film \"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\". Following European and North American tour dates throughout 2003 and 2004, Magnet signed to Atlantic Records for his third album \"The Tourniquet\", which was released in May 2005 to further positive acclaim. In 2006, he contributed several songs to the soundtrack of the video game \"\".

Their unique heavy western sound has brought attention from both fans and press alike. Since their debut in 1999, Ghoultown has released four CDs, as well as several compilations, movies, short films, a comic book and a video game.\n\nFormed in 1999, by vocalist/guitarist Count Lyle (Solitude Aeturnus, The Killcreeps), Ghoultown recorded its first 3-song EP in October of that same year. Titled \"Boots of Hell\", the EP illustrated the power of the band's Tex-Mex blend while garnering rabid reviews, a fanbase and independent radio airplay. With \"Boots of Hell\" in circulation, the band's early buzz landed them several compilation appearances. The most notable being Skully Records' (NY) \"Gothabilly 2: Rockin' Necropolis\" where they share the bill with some of the best psychobilly acts around the world. As a kick off, the band was invited to participate in the world-release show held at NY's infamous CBGB's on Halloween 2000.\n\nIn early 2001, Ghoultown released their full-length debut \"Tales from the Dead West\". The album, produced by Kol Marshall (Mercyful Fate, etc.), captured the versatility and unique sound of the Texan quintet from the powerful \"Killer in Texas\" to the Doors-esque \"Running From the Sun.\" \"This album already has a place on my best of 2001 list,\" quoted a Harder Beat reviewer who reflected the positive response. Not only were ears turned, but eyes as well as the release pushed the band into new live show territory. With highlight performances such as an Atlanta benefit, which featured Jerry Only of the legendary Misfits as an onstage guest, Ghoultown has played with an amazing variety of bands such as Hank III, Rocket from the Crypt, The Independents, DRI, Bile, Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Flametrick Subs, Dick Dale, Road Kings, Men of Porn, Captured By Robots, Fear, Cruxshadows, and The Misfits.\n\nBy 2002, four of the band's songs were chosen for the soundtrack of the horror-slasher \"American Nightmare\", starring B-movie queen Debbie Rochon (\"Tromeo and Juliet\"). The movie script was subsequently altered to include a Ghoultown performance cameo after the director witnessed the band live, and the video for their track \"Killer In Texas\" was included as a bonus on the DVD.\n\nIn the spring of 2002, the band released their follow-up \"Give 'Em More Rope\", and Angry Planet Records signed an exclusive licensing deal with Netherlands-based Corazong Records to release the Ghoultown U.S. catalog in Europe and Canada. The first Euro-Canadian release was a special version of \"Tales from the Dead West\", which included tracks from their \"Boots of Hell\" EP as well.\n\nIn the late summer, Ghoultown did a 35 date U.S. tour which included performances at NY's CBGBs to The Garage in L.A. The tour was concluded by a performance at one of the world's largest annual entertainment media conventions, Dragon*Con in Atlanta, where the band has performed for the last two years by popular demand.\n\nHitting 2003, Ghoultown's signature tune \"Killer In Texas\" made yet another appearance in a short film called \"Headcheese\" which was released on DVD with a movie called \"Freak\". Appropriately, \"Headcheese\" was filmed in the same location as \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\"... house and all! Spending the first half of 2003 performing, the band toured the midwest and east coast, in addition to numerous Texas area shows. By the end of spring, Ghoultown completed work on songs for two upcoming Jon Keeyes films, \"Slice of Life\" and \"Hallow's End\", the later in which they will also be making a cameo appearance. These are due on the market around Halloween.\n\nIn 2004, Ghoultown released a double disc set, \"Live From Texas!\", which showcased their powerful live show on both CD and DVD. \"Ghoultown puts the grit back into rock 'n' roll with a blazing hellfire vengeance!\" said Horror Garage in praise of the release, which has garnered extremely positive feedback and become the best selling release to date. Also in 2004, the band managed to creep into the video game market where several of their actual gig posters can be seen in the award-winning \"\" PC game.\n\nOctober 2006 saw the release of the full-length Ghoultown album, \"Bury Them Deep\", with a cover painted by illustrator Dan Brereton, creator of \"Nocturnals\".\n\nIn 2008, Ghoultown had two releases: \"Skeleton Cowboys\", a limited edition hand-numbered 7\" vinyl single; and \"Life After Sundown\", a full-length studio album (also featuring cover art by Dan Brereton).\n\nNew album entitled \"Ghost of the Southern Son\" has been released on March 15, 2017.\n\n\nFormer Band Members\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2282887", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2282887", "title": "Tablas de Daimiel National Park", "text": "Tablas de Daimiel National Park\n\nTablas de Daimiel National Park (\"Parque Nacional de las Tablas de Daimiel\") is a wetland on the La Mancha plain, a mainly arid area in the province of Ciudad Real. With an area of about 3,000 ha, the park is the smallest of Spain's fifteen national parks. The protected area is in the process of being expanded outside the original nature reserve to include neighbouring dryland farming areas. The expansion is part of efforts to improve the condition of the wetland, which has been damaged by over-exploitation of water resources.\n\nAs well as having national park status, the site enjoys international recognition, being:\n\nLike other Spanish wetlands, the Tablas de Daimiel had a long tradition of waterfowl hunting. As early as 1325 the infante Don Juan Manuel, in his hunting book (\"Libro de la caza\"), publicised the attributes of the banks of the river Gigüela for falconry. The water resources of the area also provided fishing and power for mills. In 1575, Philip II ordered the compilation of the Topographic Relations which commanded that the Tablas be well looked after. The value of the ecosystem for hunting continued to give the Tablas a certain amount of protection into the 20th century. Although in the 1950s the government promoted land reclamation projects in La Mancha with the aim of reducing the amount of wetland, Franco shot duck in the area and in 1966 the Tablas became a National Hunting Reserve.\n\nIn 1963 the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) launched a project to conserve and manage wetlands, the MAR Project, which drew up a list of wetlands of international importance as a foundation for an international convention on wetlands. The draft called for the protection of wetlands habitats rather than species. The Tablas de Damiel were declared a National Park in 1973. \nIn 1980 the national park was extended and UNESCO included Las Tablas in a biosphere reserve.\nIn 1982 Las Tablas were included on the list of the Ramsar Convention (an international treaty for the conservation and sustainable utilization of wetlands).\nIn 1987 Las Tablas were declared a Special Protection Area for birds (\"Zona de Especial Protección para las Aves\" in Spanish) under the European Union's Birds Directive.\n\nThe park is the last surviving example of floodplain wetlands located in the arid central part of the Iberian peninsula. Being located downstream from the Upper Guadiana Basin, TDNP play an important role in nutrient biogeochemistry.\n\nThe wetland landscape is characterized by recurrent seasonal inundation which until recently was maintained by both river flooding and groundwater discharges.\nThe park's surface is 19.28 km², and the highest inundation comprises around 17 km. TDNP is one of the most important aquatic ecosystems of Spain and was probably the main inland wetland. It is important too because of the great amount of migratory birds that pass by the zone, like ducks and geese.\n\n\"Las Tablas de Daimiel\" are provided with two types of water making an unusual ecosystem: the Guadiana contributes fresh water, while its tributary the Gigüela is brackish.\n\nThe fresh water of the Guadiana favors the growth of the Common Reed (Phragmites australis, Phragmites communis), and the briny water of the Gigüela favors the growth of the marshy vegetation, principally the Great Fen-sedge (Cladium mariscus).\n\nThe Great Fen-sedge abounded extraordinarily, and it was one of the most extensive zones in Occidental Europe.\nThere were groups of Bulrushes (g. Typha, Scirpus lacustris, Scirpus maritimus) and Rush (g. Juncus) in the least deep areas.\n\nCharophytes' grasslands are one of the most characteristic formations of the National Park, formed by different members of genus Chara (Chara hispida, Chara major, Chara canescens), also known locally as \"ovas\", and are able to form an almost continuous tapestry. The only trees present are the tamarisk (Tamarix gallica, Tamarix canariensis).\n\nPurple Heron (Ardea purpurea), Grey Heron (Ardea cinerea), Little Egret (Egretta garzetta), Black-crowned Night Heron (Nycticorax nycticorax), Great Bittern (Botaurus stellaris), Red-crested Pochard (Netta rufina), Northern Shoveler (Anas clypeata), Wigeon (Anas penelope), Northern Pintail (Anas acuta), Common Teal (Anas crecca), Eurasian Hobby (Falco subbuteo), Slavonian Grebe (Podiceps auritus), Black-necked Grebe (Podiceps nigricollis), Black-winged Stilt (Himantopus himantopus), Zitting Cisticola (Cisticola juncidis), Bearded Reedling (Panurus biarmicus)...\n\nWe may find the European freshwater crayfish (\"Austropotamobius pallipes\"), that it was in the past abundant and \nan important source of income for Daimiel's families, today almost extinguished in these waters. \nAfter the introduction of the great predator that the Northern pike (\"Esox lucius\") is, other autochthonous species like the Barbus (\"Barbus barbus\"), the Common carp (\"Cyprinus carpio\"), or the Chub (\"Leuciscus cephalus\") are now endangered species.\n\nIn the spring and the summer we may find amphibians and reptiles like the European tree frog (Hyla arborea), the Perez's\nfrog (Pelophylax perezi), the Common Toad (Bufo bufo), the Grass Snake (Natrix natrix) or the water snake Natrix maura.\n\nAlso we may find mammals like the European Polecat (\"Mustela putorius\"), the Red Fox (\"Vulpes vulpes\"), the European Otter (\"Lutra lutra\"), the Water Vole (\"Arvicola amphibius\"), as well as the ones that live in proximities of the wetlands: the European Rabbit (\"Oryctolagus cuniculus\"), the Cape Hare (\"Lepus capensis\"), the Least Weasel (\"Mustela nivalis\") or the Boar (\"Sus scrofa\").\n\nIn recent years demand for water for agriculture in the area surrounding the park has reduced the amount of wetland. Overexploitation of water resources has caused the water-table to drop. The key aquifer (\"aquifer 23\") has not been able to refill because of the overuse of water created by the “Badajoz (irrigation) Plan” started in 1952, and of the administrative apathy and lack of suppleness faced with cereal farmers lobbies. The quotas assigned to water-users (about 590 million m3 water / year attributed) correspond to nearly twice the amount of renewable water (about 320 million m3 / year available).\n\nFaced with a possible fine from the EU, the Spanish Environment ministry presented in 1995 a transfer project (an aqueduct and miles of pipes between the Tagus and the Mancha Húmeda) to bring water to the upper Guadiana basin. This extra water was to be used strictly for urban water provision and for the protected ecological zones, not for agriculture. But this project was badly received for two main reasons. Firstly because it assumed that the two depleted aquifers had no chance of recovering, and it chose the easy and cheaper immediate solution with no account taken of future water resources. Secondly because it aimed at replacing the natural hydric system, a principle that is too anti-natural to be easily accepted. Various conservation groups expressed the view that the solution should be found within the Guadiana basin.\n\nVarious ecological groups have suggested that the national park's designation as a biosphere reserve (within Mancha Húmeda) should be withdrawn as its ecosystem has been broken. In June 2008, a UNESCO report recommended that the national park lose its biosphere status or, alternatively, that Spain be given an ultimatum to reverse the degradation. In the event, Spain was given time to reverse the degradation.\n\nA Special Upper Guadiana Plan concerning the western Mancha aquifers started in 2008 with a 5 M€ budget, to be operated for 29 years in order to restore the wetlands. The European Union Water Directive demands wetlands to be in proper state by 2015 but it grants some flexibility in particularly difficult cases, as is so for the Tablas of Damiel in particular, and the Mancha Húmeda in general - hence the 2027 limit date. This Plan consists of a water bank system that aims at establishing quotas on the basis of social and environmental grounds while taking into account the water use efficiency.\n\nIn May 2009 a plan was announced to reverse the decline in the wetland area using recycled water. However, some skepticism was shown by environmentalists who noted that the aquifer was not going to be replenished. \nIn the hot summer of 2009, smouldering dry peat fires broke out in the area. Such fires were not a new phenomenon in the region; they had affected the peatlands alongside the Guadiana in previous years, but by reappearing in the National Park, the fires represented another symptom of the wetland's degradation.\n\nEarly in 2010 the situation was improved by heavier rainfall than had been experienced for several years.\nHowever, analysis clearly show that there will be no notable improvement in the situation without considerably reducing the surface of irrigated cereals while maintaining without increase the surface of traditional crops suited to arid conditions (\"agricultura de secano\" in Spanish) and of horticulture (the latter being the most efficient crop in terms of extended water footprint). The Plan also includes buying water rights. This gives scope to use water for the benefit of the national park and also to reassign water quotas in favour of more efficient use than cereal production, including hitherto illegal users, essentially small producers of vines and horticulture which have been found more efficient in water use and generate more income per cubic meter of water used.\n\nStill, in the context of Spain's economic crisis, funds have been lacking for this operation.\n\nEuropean subsidies are attributed in priority to reforesting land after forests were felled for the production of cereals during the preceding generations. Moreover, within the frame of Europe's present Common Agricultural Policy (in 2010) cereals get more subsidies than other crops. A revision of that politic is due in 2013. The choices that will be made then will be determinant for the future of the \"Mancha Húmeda\". Another determining factor is the developing of other local economics such as solar electricity, ecotourism, better quality agricultural products, and environmental services (carbon sinks for example).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2282889", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2282889", "title": "Astaroth (Soulcalibur)", "text": "Astaroth (Soulcalibur)\n\nIntroduced in the original \"Soulcalibur\", Astaroth is a golem created by a cult worshiping the Greek god of war Ares to locate a cursed sword named \"Soul Edge\". Though Astaroth has consistently pursued the sword, his character has changed as the series progresses, eventually transforming into a power hungering creature desiring to consume the sword. Regarded as an iconic character of the series, Astaroth has been noted as fitting a large character stereotype seen in fighting games, featuring strong attacks but slow speed. Astaroth has been described as having easy-to-master gameplay and being popular with fans of strong, hard-hitting characters in fighting games.\n\nAs a character introduced in \"Soulcalibur\", Astaroth's weapon, a giant axe, was decided upon before other aspects of the character were. His design revolved around it, starting with gender, then physical measurements, and lastly background details. Once established, his appearance and movement were fleshed out by the team's concept artist Aya Takemura and rendered as a 3D model by a design team that worked solely on the character. Astaroth was then animated mainly by Nobuko Nimura using motion capture and working directly with the team, while other motion designers created the movements for his grapple attacks. During this phase the team additionally worked with the \"Soulcalibur\" story creators, refining the character's own role in the plot as needed throughout development. \"Soulcalibur IV\" lead programmer Masaaki Hoshino called Astaroth his favorite character, stating that because he is \"so powerful there's always a chance to make a comeback\".\n\nDuring development, a golem devoid of facial features, armed with a sword and shield, and accompanied by a small girl was considered as a possible character, but scrapped. Before finalizing his appearance several other designs were considered, ranging from a Frankenstein's monster-inspired character to a medieval berserker. Despite having a male voice and physical build, Astaroth was referred to as \"it\" in terms of gender for the character's \"Soulcalibur\" background information. However the background information in other character profiles instead refer to him as male, and his background information in later titles followed suit.\n\nAstaroth is shown to be a large, muscular, bald, dark-skinned humanoid with solid white eyes. A black mask wraps around and covers the lower portion of his head, while a black open gorget covers the nape of his neck and spiked spaulders cover his shoulders. Black spiked braces and boots cover his hands to the elbows and feet to the knees respectively, and black garters wrap around the middle of each thigh. A large black belt surrounds his abdomen supporting a fauld and cloth loincloth. Two black straps of leather crisscross the vertical center of his chest from the gorget to the belt, in between which lies his exposed, protruding heart. During development of the design, a flame positioned over his head alongside flaming eyes were considered, but were cut from the finished product. Astaroth stands 7 feet 3 inches tall, making him the largest character with a recorded height in the series.\n\nIn subsequent titles of the series Astaroth's appearance changed, showing more signs of damage and armor loss in \"II\" and in \"III\" shifting to a dark maroon skintone. By \"Soulcalibur IV\", Astaroth's appearance was completely changed, altered to resemble a \"rugged rocky\" golem. Facial features were completely removed, replaced with a large-mawed fractured head design with a headscarf covering the area around his forehead, eyes, and the back of his head. The remaining areas of his body featured several cracks over his build with red veins glowing from within. Large stone spikes jutted from each shoulder, while a similar pair jutted from each knee. Broken metal armor pieces protected his arms, legs, and chest, while a fauld surrounded his waist. Fans reacted negatively to the character's modified appearance once unveiled, complaining it was \"monster-ish\".\n\nIn most \"Soulcalibur\" titles, Astaroth's secondary character models contrast heavily against his primary design. Amongst these have included designs with several bone or spike protrusions from Astaroth's body, to designs inspired by punk fashion. This trend was discontinued in \"Soulcalibur IV\", where his appearance from \"Soulcalibur\" was reused instead. \n\nIntroduced in \"Soulcalibur\", Astaroth is a golem created by a cult of Ares to retrieve the cursed sword known as Soul Edge. Upon finding the blade, Astaroth realizes that it is damaged and allies himself with its wielder Nightmare to harvest living souls necessary to restore the blade, planning to steal the blade once completed. However, before he can complete this task, he is confronted by a survivor of his attacks, Maxi, and is slain. Revived by Ares in \"Soulcalibur II\", Astaroth continues after the sword. However, the cult that created him regards this as a betrayal, and places a curse on the golem to dominate him. Astaroth resists and counterattacks the cult, learning in the process his design is not original but instead modeled after a human being, Rock. To assert himself as unique, Astaroth finds and nearly kills Rock at the conclusion of \"Soulcalibur III\", breaking free of Ares' control and transforming in the aftermath. Now hungering for power, he is offered it in return for servitude to Nightmare during the events of \"Soulcalibur IV\", an offer he accepts with the secret goal of devouring Soul Edge itself. Destroyed instead by Maxi, Astaroth's heart is retrieved by the cult responsible for his creation, and a new series of golems all bearing the name \"Astaroth\" are created from research conducted upon it.\n\nOutside of the main games in the \"Soulcalibur\" series, Astaroth also appears in a Dreamcast VMU mini-game called \"Cannon Dare\", in which the player must shoot him out of a cannon by guessing the correct fuse, and later as a playable character in Namco's \"Pac-Man Fever\". Astaroth also appears briefly in \"\"s Gauntlet storyline, a side story set after the events of \"Soulcalibur IV\", tearing through a forest and challenging the protagonist and allies after they defeat a rampaging Maxi. In the prequel \"Soulcalibur Legends\" a similar prototype golem, Astaroth α, is discovered by game protagonist Siegfried. Upon defeat, he joins Siegfried's party as a playable character.\n\nAstaroth's gameplay was developed around the concept of a powerful fighter that struck at a distance, and has been noted as one of the strongest characters in the \"Soulcalibur\" series, requiring few mistakes to be made when fighting against Astaroth to defeat him. Measures were put into effect to make the character unique by allowing the player to hold attack buttons in order to strengthen attacks, to contrast against other large character fighting styles in \"Soulcalibur\" such as Nightmare's multiple fighting stances.\n\nThough noted as having slow attacks, Astaroth has been described as being an easy-to-learn character capable of dealing high amounts of damage, though his advantages and disadvantages have been described as part of the \"big guy\" role he has in the game's roster. Several of his attacks cover a wide range, while several of his grapple attacks allow room to deal with various defensive measures by opponents. Other attacks such as \"Poseidon Tide\" allow Astaroth to control the opponent's distance from himself while simultaneously dealing damage, with the additional feature of offering defensive measures of their own.\n\nIn 2000, Epoch C-Works released a series of action figures based on characters from the original \"Soulcalibur\", amongst them Astaroth. The semi-posable figure of Astaroth was packaged with equipable weapons from the title. In August 2003, Todd McFarlane Productions released an Astaroth sculpture amongst a set of five based on characters from \"Soulcalibur II\". The immobile figure was modeled after his secondary outfit and stood six inches tall with a base.\n\nAstaroth has been described as one of the \"staple\" and \"stalwart\" characters of the \"Soulcalibur\" franchise by \"GameTrailers\". He has been noted as being a stereotypical large character villain in the series by author Rachael Hutchinson. GameDaily named him one of their favorite heavily muscled characters in video games, noting his strength and the impact of his weapon. \"Insert Credit\" Tim Rogers stated \"It takes a certain kind of gamer to prefer Astaroth\", noting him as a character popular with fans of \"kickass\" or \"evil\" characters. \"The New York Times\" noted his size and appearance alongside Nightmare's as standouts in the series, adding \"they offer characters made for the sort of player who would have preferred Sonny Liston to Muhammad Ali, or Shaquille O'Neal to Michael Jordan\". In 2013, \"Complex\" enlisted the 20 best characters from the series, ranking him the tenth best character.\n\n"}

He received his schooling in Jerusalem at the Greek Orthodox school, at the Anglican Christian Mission Society (CMS) College founded by Bishop Blyth, and at the Zion English College where he read Literature.\n\nLater, Sakakini traveled to the United Kingdom and from there to the United States to join his brother Yusif, an itinerant salesman living in Philadelphia. During his nine-month stay in America, Khalil Sakakini wrote for Arabic literary magazines on the East Coast, and did translations for Professor Richard Gottheil, even though the latter was an active Zionist. He supported himself by teaching Arabic and working in a factory in Maine; he also worked as a street vendor. Upon his return in 1908, Khalil Sakakini worked as a journalist for the Jerusalem newspaper al-Asmai', taught Arabic at the Salahiyya school and tutored expatriates at the American Colony.Sakakini's wife, Sultana, died in October 1939 and was buried in the Greek Orthodox cemetery on Mount Zion. He mourned her for the rest of his days, and wrote poems eulogizing her. His son, Sari, completed his Master's degree at the University of Michigan and returned to Jerusalem, to work for the American consulate.\n\nDuring the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the Sakakinis were one of the last families to leave the Katamon neighborhood. A few days before the city was divided, the Sakakini family fled to Cairo. There, Khalil Sakakini was nominated by the Egyptian writer Taha Hussein to join the Arabic Language Academy.\n\nSari Sakakini's sudden death of a heart attack in 1953 at the age of 39 was a devastating blow. Khalil Sakakini died three months later, on 13 August 1953. Sakakini's two daughters, Dumya and Hala, lived together in Ramallah until their deaths, in 2002 and 2003. The two sisters had long careers in education. Hala Sakakini edited her father's journals, published in 1955, and wrote two memoirs in English, \"Jerusalem and I\" and \"Twosome\".\n\nIn 1909, Khalil Sakakini founded the Dusturiyyah school or National School, which became known for its Arab nationalist approach. Sakakini pioneered a progressive education system: no grades, prizes or punishments for the students, and emphasis being placed on music, education and athletics. He also introduced new methods of teaching Arabic, and made it the primary language of instruction instead of Turkish.\n\nWasif Jawhariyyeh, noted for his memoirs of early 20th century Jerusalem, was a pupil of his in the Dusturiyyah School. He praised Sakakini's education style.\nSakakini led a movement to reform and change into a more Arab approach to what he considered to be a corrupt Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem, and wrote a pamphlet in 1913 titled \"The Orthodox Renaissance in Palestine\", which led to his excommunication from the Greek Orthodox Church. Ottoman authorities arrested him on the last day of Ottoman Rule in Jerusalem in 1917, after he had sheltered a Polish-American Jew and fellow citizen of Jerusalem, Alter Levine. Both were sent to a prison in Damascus. Levine became an enemy when the United States joined the Allies of World War I. Even so, Alter Levine and Khalil Sakakini became close friends during their incarceration. Upon his release, Sakakini boarded for a brief time with Musa Alami, a former pupil, and then joined the Arab Revolt, for which he composed its anthem.\n\nIn 1919, Khalil Sakakini and his wife began to work for the Educational Authority of Palestine in Jerusalem, and Sakakini was appointed head of the Jerusalem Teachers’ College. He later became Inspector for Education in Palestine, a post he held for 12 years, until his resignation in protest of the appointment of a Jew as High Commissioner of the Palestine Mandate, Herbert Samuel. After working as a school principal in Cairo, he returned to Palestine in 1926 and became a school inspector. This allowed him to bring his educational philosophy to the rural villages. At the same time, he wrote political commentaries for the newspapers al-Muqtataf, al-Hilal and al-Siyassa al-Usbu'iyya, composed patriotic poems and spoke at political rallies. In 1925, he founded the Wataniyya school, and in 1938 the Nahda College in Jerusalem. In May 1934, Sakakini built a home in the Katamon neighborhood which was completed in three years. In 1932, he sent his son Sari to Haverford College, Pennsylvania. \n\nThroughout his life Khalil Sakakini embraced European culture. Having a Greek grandmother led to an interest in Greek music and Greek philosophy, and he even nicknamed himself \"Socrates\".\n\nSakakini often expressed humanistic ideas, and had a business card made out to read \"Khalil Sakakini: human being, God willing\". At the same time, he defined himself first and foremost as an Arab, and is hailed as one of the founding fathers of Arab nationalism of the region. He was an advocate of Pan-Arabism and envisaged Palestine united with Syria. He saw Zionism as a great threat already before the First World War and believed that the Jewish right to the land had expired while the Arab right was \"a living one\".\n\nAl-Sakakini, listing some of the punishments to be meted out: bomb and shoot the British and Jewish invaders, torch Jewish fields and orange groves, ambush routine traffic, block roads, derail trains, cut power lines. He continued: \"The battle in Palestine is in full force... Victory is in the hands of God... If we live, we shall live with honor. If we die - we shall die with honor.\n\nDuring the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine, Khalil Sakakini applauded the Arab attacks on Jews, but worried that the violence looked bad in the eye of the public because 'the Jews controlled the newspapers and radio'. Therefore, Sakakini had to conclude, that 'the sword was mightier than the book'. For a grenade attack on a Jewish civilian train, he praised the \"heroes\" responsible. After the attack on Jerusalem's Edison cinema that left three dead, he wrote:\n\"There is no other heroism like this, except the heroism of Sheikh al-Qassam\". \nYet the terrorism still bothered him:\n\"I feel the pain of the troubles, whether they fall on Arabs or on the English or on the Jews. For that reason you will sometimes find me on the side of the Arabs, at others times on the side of the English, and still other times on the side of the Jews. And if there were animals who suffered from even a faint whiff of these troubles, I would sometimes be on the side of the animals.\nKhalil Sakakini also came to believe that Nazi Germany might weaken the British and 'liberate Palestine from the Jew', and therefore supported the Nazis. He wrote that Adolf Hitler had opened the World's eyes to the myth of Jewish power, and that Germany had stood up to the Jews and put them in their place, much like Mussolini had done with the British.\n\nSakakini vehemently opposed allowing Holocaust survivors into Palestine, arguing that a human problem needed to be solved by all humanity. While saddened by events such as the Struma disaster, he felt that the passengers were in fact invaders. An independent Palestinian Arab government should have used force to prevent them from landing, and he felt that while elderly Jews could come to live out their last years as had happened in the past, a thriving Jewish community under British protection should be forbidden. Khalil Sakakini believed that the Holocaust was being exploited parasitically by Jews demanding a homeland in Palestine, who he said would throw the Arabs out as soon as they got their homeland. Due to the Jewish influence in the United States, he believed that their right to vote in that country should be revoked.\n\nSakakini was a lifelong advocate of social reform. He tried to inculcate principles of students' liberation, sex education, socialist and other progressive ideas, and believed in free mingling of the sexes. \nKhalil Sakakini's published work includes educational treatises, poetry collections, literary, philosophical and political essays, and his diaries. A street and a school in Jerusalem are named after him, the Jezzar Pasha Mosque's library in Acre as well as a street in Cairo. His publications are now at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He is buried in the Mar Gerges Cemetery in Cairo.\n\nIn 2001, the Khalil Sakakini Cultural Center successfully petitioned the municipality of Ramallah to rename the main thoroughfare nearest the center after Khalil Sakakini. That same year, the center began editing and publishing the diaries of Khalil Sakakini, which he kept from 1907 to 1952. The first volume of the projected eight volumes was published in 2003. In 2003 too, Sakakini's heirs bequeathed the center his valuable collection of publications, books, and personal effects. These are on display in the foyer of the Khalil Sakakini Cultural Center.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2282933", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2282933", "title": "Atrioventricular block", "text": "Atrioventricular block\n\nAtrioventricular block (AV block) is a type of heart block that occurs when the electrical signal traveling from the atria, or the upper chambers of the heart, to ventricles, or the lower chambers of the heart, is impaired. Normally, the sinoatrial node (SA node) produces an electrical signal to control the heart rate. The signal travels from the SA node to the ventricles through the atrioventricular node (AV node). In an AV block, this electrical signal is either delayed or completely blocked. When the signal is completely blocked, the ventricles produce their own electrical signal to control the heart rate. The heart rate produced by the ventricles is much slower than that produced by the SA node.\n\nSome AV blocks are benign, or normal, in certain people, such as in athletes or children. Other blocks are pathologic, or abnormal, and have several causes, including ischemia, infarction, fibrosis, and drugs.\n\nThe synchronized contraction of the heart occurs through a well coordinated electrical signal pathway. The initial electrical signal originates from the SA node located in the upper portion of the right atrium. The electrical signal then travels through both the right and left atrium, and causes the two atria to contract at the same time. This simultaneous contraction results in the P wave seen in an ECG tracing.\n\nThe electrical signal then travels to the AV node located on the lower portion of the interatrial septum. At the AV node there is a delay in the electrical signal, which allows the atria to contract and blood to flow from the atria to the ventricles. This delay accounts for the ECG period between the P wave and the QRS complex, and creates the PR interval.\n\nFrom the AV nodes, the electrical signal travels through Bundle of His and divides into the right bundle and left bundle, which are located within the interventricular septum. Finally, the electrical signal travels into the Purkinje fibers. The division of the signal into a right and left bundle and then into the Purkinje fibers allows for a simultaneous depolarization and contraction of the right and left ventricles. The contraction of the ventricles results in the QRS complex seen on an ECG tracing.After contraction, the ventricles must repolarize, or reset themselves, in order to allow for a second depolarization and contraction. The repolarization creates the T wave in the ECG tracing.\n\nAn electrocardiogram, or ECG, is used to differentiate between the different types of AV block. In AV block, there is a disruption between the signal traveling from the atria to the ventricles. This results in abnormalities in the PR interval, as well as the relationship between P waves and QRS complexes on the ECG tracing. If the patient is symptomatic from their suspected AV block, it is important that an ECG is also obtained while having symptoms. Physicians may also order a continuous ECG (i.e. Holter monitor or implanted cardiac monitor) to monitor the patient for symptoms and conduction abnormalities over a longer period of time, as AV blocks can be intermittent.\n\nBecause some types of AV block can be associated with underlying structural heart disease, patients may also undergo echocardiogram to look at the heart and assess the function.\n\nLaboratory diagnosis for AV blocks include electrolyte, drug level and cardiac enzyme level tests. Based upon clinical suspicion, the physician may do lab tests to assess for reversible causes of AV block, such as hypothyroidism, rheumatologic disorders, and infections (such as Lyme disease).\n\nThere are three types, or degrees, of AV block: (1) first-degree, (2) second-degree, and (3) third-degree, with third-degree being the most severe. An ECG is used to differentiate between the different types of AV block.\nFirst-degree AV block occurs when there is a delay, but not disruption, as the electrical signal moves between the atrium and the ventricles through the AV node. On ECG, this is defined by a PR interval greater than 200 msec. Additionally, there are no dropped, or skipped, beats.\n\nSecond-degree AV block occurs when the electrical signal between the atria and ventricles is even more impaired than in a first-degree AV block. In a second-degree AV block, the impairment results in a failure to conduct an impulse, which causes a skipped beat.\n\nMobitz I is characterized by a progressive, yet, reversible block of the AV node. On ECG, this is defined by a progressive prolongation of the PR interval, with a resulting dropped beat (the PR interval gets longer and longer until a beat is finally dropped, or skipped).\n\nSome patients are asymptomatic; those who have symptoms respond to treatment effectively. There is low risk of a Mobitz I AV block leading to heart attack and complete heart block.\n\nMobitz II is caused by a sudden, unexpected failure of the His-Purkinje cells to conduct the electrical impulse. On ECG, the PR interval is unchanged from beat to beat, but there is a sudden failure to conduct the signal to the ventricles, and a resulting random skipped beat.\n\nThe risks and possible effects of Mobitz II are much more severe than Mobitz I in that it can lead to severe heart attack.\n\nThird-degree AV block occurs when the signal between the atria and ventricles is completely blocked, and there is no communication between the two. None of the signals from the upper chambers make it to the lower chambers. On ECG, there is no relationship between P waves and QRS complexes, meaning the P waves and QRS complexes are not in a 1:1 ratio.\n\nThird-degree AV block is the most severe of the AV blocks. Persons suffering third-degree AV block need emergency treatment including but not limited to a pacemaker.\n\nThere are many causes of AV block, ranging from a normal variant among people to the result of a heart attack.\n\nFirst-degree AV block and Mobitz I second-degree block are often thought to be just normal, benign, conditions in patients, and do not often result from a severe underlying condition.\n\nMobitz II second-degree block and third-degree AV block are not normal variants, and are associated with an underlying condition. Common causes include ischemia (lack of blood flow and oxygen to the heart muscle) or progressive fibrosis (excessive scaring) of the heart. It is also possible that high degree block can result after cardiac surgery during which the surgeon was in close proximity to the electrical conduction system and accidentally injured it. Reversible causes of Mobitz II and third-degree heart block include untreated Lyme disease, hypothyroidism, hyperkalemia (high levels of potassium), and drug toxicity. Drugs that slow the conduction of the electrical signal through AV node, such as beta-blockers, digoxin, calcium channel blockers, and amiodarone, can cause heart block if they are taken in excessive amounts, or the levels in the blood get too high.\n\nManagement is dependent upon the severity, or degree, of the blockage, the consistency of symptoms, as well as the cause of the AV block.\n\nPatients with first-degree AV block do not have any resulting severe or life-threatening symptoms, such as symptomatic bradycardia or hypotension, and, thus, do not require treatment.\n\nSimilarly, patients with second-degree Mobitz I AV block rarely develop life-threatening symptoms, and patients who are asymptomatic do not require treatment. However, in some cases, patients with Mobtz I block can develop life-threatening symptoms that requires intervention. These patients often respond well to atropine, but make require temporary transcutaneous pacing or transvenous pacing until they are not longer symptomatic.\n\nPatients with second-degree Mobitz II and third-degree heart block are much more likely to have symptomatic bradycardia and hemodynamic instability, such as hypotension. Additionally, there is an increased risk of patients with Mobitz II heart block developing third-degree heart block. Therefore, these patients often require temporary pacing with transcutaneous or transvenous pacing wires, and many will ultimately require a permanent implanted pacemaker.\n\nIf the heart block is found to be caused by a reversible condition, such as Lyme disease, the underlying condition should first be treated. Often, this will lead to resolution of the heart block and the associated symptoms.\n\n"}

{"id": "2282947", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2282947", "title": "Advanced Telecommunications Computing Architecture", "text": "Advanced Telecommunications Computing Architecture\n\nAdvanced Telecommunications Computing Architecture (ATCA or AdvancedTCA) is the largest specification effort in the history of the PCI Industrial Computer Manufacturers Group (PICMG), with more than 100 companies participating. Known as AdvancedTCA, the official specification designation PICMG 3.\"x\" (see below) was ratified by the PICMG organization in December 2002. AdvancedTCA is targeted primarily to requirements for \"carrier grade\" communications equipment, but has recently expanded its reach into more ruggedized applications geared toward the military/aerospace industries as well. This series of specifications incorporates the latest trends in high speed interconnect technologies, next-generation processors, and improved Reliability, Availability and Serviceability (RAS).\n\nAn AdvancedTCA board (blade) is 280 mm deep and 322 mm high. The boards have a metal front panel and a metal cover on the bottom of the printed circuit board to limit electromagnetic interference and to limit the spread of fire. The locking injector-ejector handle (lever) actuates a microswitch to let the Intelligent Platform Management Controller (IPMC) know that an operator wants to remove a board, or that the board has just been installed, thus activating the hot-swap procedure. AdvancedTCA boards support the use of PCI Mezzanine Card (PMC) or Advanced Mezzanine Card (AMC) expansion mezzanines.\n\nThe shelf supports RTMs (Rear Transition Modules). RTMs plug into the back of the shelf in slot locations that match the front boards. The RTM and the front board are interconnected through a Zone-3 connector. The Zone-3 connector is not defined by the AdvancedTCA specification.\n\nEach shelf slot is 30.48 mm wide. This allows for 14-board chassis to be installed in a 19-inch rack-mountable system and 16 boards in an ETSI rack-mountable system. A typical 14-slot system is 12 or 13 rack units high. The large AdvancedTCA shelves are targeted to the telecommunication market so the airflow goes in the front of the shelf, across the boards from bottom to top, and out the rear of the shelf. Smaller shelves that are used in enterprise applications typically have horizontal air flow.\n\nThe small-medium AdvancedTCA shelves are targeted to the telecommunication market; for the lab research operation, some shelves have an open cover in order to make testing easier.\n\nThe AdvancedTCA backplane provides point-to-point connections between the boards and does not use a data bus. The backplane definition is divided into three sections; Zone-1, Zone-2, and Zone-3. The connectors in Zone-1 provide redundant −48 VDC power and Shelf Management signals to the boards. The connectors in Zone-2 provide the connections to the Base Interface and Fabric Interface. All Fabric connections use point-to-point 100 Ω differential signals. Zone-2 is called \"Fabric Agnostic\" which means that any Fabric that can use 100 Ω differential signals can be used with an AdvancedTCA backplane.\n\nThe connectors in Zone-3 are user defined and are usually used to connect a front board to a Rear Transition Module. The Zone-3 area can also hold a special backplane to interconnect boards with signals that are not defined in the AdvancedTCA specification.\n\nThe AdvancedTCA Fabric specification uses Logical Slots to describe the interconnections. The Fabric Switch Boards go in Logical Slots 1 and 2. The chassis manufacturer is free to decide the relationship between Logical and Physical Slots in a chassis. The chassis Field Replaceable Units (FRU) data includes an Address Table that describes the relationship between the Logical and Physical slots.\n\nThe Shelf Managers communicate with each board and FRU in the chassis with IPMI (Intelligent Platform Management Interface) protocols running on redundant I²C buses on the Zone-1 connectors.\n\nThe Base Interface is the primary Fabric on the Zone-2 connectors and allocates 4 differential pairs per Base Channel. It is wired as a Dual-Star with redundant fabric hub slots at the core. It is commonly used for out of band management, firmware uploading, OS boot, etc.\n\nThe Fabric Interface on the backplane supports many different Fabrics and can be wired as a Dual-Star, Dual-Dual-Star, Mesh, Replicated-Mesh or other architectures. It allocates 8 differential pairs per Fabric Channel and each Channel can be divided into four 2-pair Ports. The Fabric Interface is typically used to move data between the boards and the outside network.\n\nThe Synchronization Clock Interface routes MLVDS (Multipoint Low-voltage differential signaling) clock signals over multiple 130 Ω buses. The clocks are typically used to synchronize telecom interfaces.\n\nUpdate Channel Interface is a set of 10 differential signal pairs that interconnect two slots. Which slots are interconnected depends on the particular backplane design. These are signals commonly used to interconnect two hub boards, or redundant processor boards.\n\nThe Base Interface can only be 10BASE-T, 100BASE-TX, or 1000BASE-T Ethernet. Since all boards and hubs are required to support one of these interfaces there is always a network connection to the boards.\n\nThe Fabric is commonly SerDes Gigabit Ethernet, but can also be Fibre Channel, XAUI 10-Gigabit Ethernet, InfiniBand, PCI Express, or Serial RapidIO. Any Fabric that can use the point-to-point 100 Ω differential signals can be used with an AdvancedTCA backplane.\n\nThe PICMG 3.1 Ethernet/Fibre Channel specification has been revised to include IEEE 100GBASE-KR4 signaling to the existing IEEE 40GBASE-KR4, 10GBASE-KX4, 10GBASE-KR, and XAUI signaling.\n\nAdvancedTCA blades can be Processors, Switches, AMC carriers, etc. A typical shelf will contain one or more switch blades and several processor blades.\n\nWhen they are first inserted into the shelf the onboard IPMC is powered from the redundant −48 V on the backplane. The IPMC sends an IPMI event message to the Shelf Manager to let it know that it has been installed. The Shelf Manager reads information from the blade and determines if there is enough power available. If there is, the Shelf Manager sends a command to the IPMC to power-up the payload part of the blade. The Shelf Manager also determines what fabric ports are supported by the blade. It then looks at the fabric interconnect information for the backplane to find out what fabric ports are on the other end of the fabric connections. If the fabric ports on both ends of the backplane wires match then it sends an IPMI command to both blades to enable the matching ports.\n\nOnce the blade is powered-up and connected to the fabrics the Shelf Manager listens for event messages from the sensors on the blade. If a temperature sensor reports that it is too warm then the Shelf Manager will increase the speed of the fans.\n\nThe FRU data in the board contains descriptive information like the manufacturer, model number, serial number, manufacturing date, revision, etc. This information can be read remotely to perform an inventory of the blades in a shelf.\n\nThe Shelf Manager monitors and controls the boards (blades) and FRU in the shelf. If any sensor reports a problem the Shelf Manager can take action or report the problem to a System Manager. This action could be something simple like making the fans go faster, or more drastic such as powering off a board. Each board and FRU contains inventory information (FRU Data) that can be retrieved by the Shelf Manager. The FRU data is used by the Shelf Manager to determine if there is enough power available for a board or FRU and if the Fabric ports that interconnect boards are compatible. The FRU data can also reveal the manufacturer, manufacturing date, model number, serial number, and asset tag.\n\nEach blade, intelligent FRU, and Shelf Manager contains an Intelligent Platform Management Controller (IPMC). The Shelf Manager communicates with the boards and intelligent FRUs with IPMI protocols running on redundant I²C buses. IPMI protocols include packet checksums to ensure that data transmission is reliable. It is also possible to have non-intelligent FRUs managed by an intelligent FRUs. These are called Managed FRUs and have the same capabilities as an intelligent FRU.\n\nThe interconnection between the Shelf Manager and the boards is a redundant pair of Intelligent Platform Management Buses (IPMBs). The IPMB architecture can be a pair of buses (Bused IPMB) or a pair of radial connections (Radial IPMB). Radial IPMB implementations usually include the capability to isolate individual IPMB connections to improve reliability in the event of an IPMC failure.\n\nThe Shelf Manager communicates with outside entities with RMCP (IPMI over TCP/IP), HTTP, SNMP over an Ethernet network. Some Shelf Managers support the Hardware Platform Interface, a technical specification defined by the Service Availability Forum.\n\nTwo new working groups have been started to adapt ATCA to the specific requirements of physics research.\n\n\nWG1 will define rear I/O for AMC modules and a new component called the μRTM. Additions will be made to the μTCA Shelf specification to accommodate the μRTM and to the ATCA specification to accommodate AMC Rear I/O for an ATCA carrier RTM. Signal lines be identified for use as clocks, gates, and triggers that are commonly used in Physics data acquisition systems. \n\n\nWG2 will define a common set of software architectures and supporting infrastructure to facilitate inter-operability and portability of both hardware and software modules among the various applications developed for the Physics xTCA platform and that will minimize the development effort and time required to construct experiments and systems using that platform.\n\nA working group was formed to extend ATCA to non-telecom markets.\n\n\nThe goals of this new working group are to define enhanced features to support double-wide boards; add enhancements to support 600W single-slot boards and 800W double-slot boards; add support for double-sided shelves with full sized boards plugged into both the front and rear of the shelf; and add support for 10Gbs signaling on the Base Interface.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2282952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2282952", "title": "Zuo zhuan", "text": "Zuo zhuan\n\nThe Zuo zhuan (; ), generally translated The Zuo Tradition or The Commentary of Zuo, is an ancient Chinese narrative history that is traditionally regarded as a commentary on the ancient Chinese chronicle \"Spring and Autumn Annals\" (\"Chunqiu\" 春秋). It comprises 30 chapters covering a period from 722 to 468BC, and focuses mainly on political, diplomatic, and military affairs from that era. The \"Zuo zhuan\" is famous for its \"relentlessly realistic\" style, and recounts many tense and dramatic episodes, such as battles and fights, royal assassinations and murder of concubines, deception and intrigue, excesses, citizens' oppression and insurgences, and appearances of ghosts and cosmic portents.\n\nFor many centuries, the \"Zuo zhuan\" was the primary text through which educated Chinese gained an understanding of their ancient history. Unlike the other two surviving \"Annals\" commentariesthe \"Gongyang\" and \"Guliang\" commentariesthe \"Zuo zhuan\" does not simply explain the wording of the \"Annals\", but greatly expounds upon its historical background, and contains many rich and lively accounts of Spring and Autumn period (771476) history and culture. The \"Zuo zhuan\" is the source of more Chinese sayings and idioms than any other classical work, and its concise, flowing style came to be held as a paragon of elegant Classical Chinese. Its tendency toward third-person narration and portraying characters through direct speech and action became hallmarks of Chinese narrative in general, and its style was imitated by historians, storytellers, and ancient style prose masters for over 2000 years of subsequent Chinese history.\n\nAlthough the \"Zuo zhuan\" has long been regarded as \"a masterpiece of grand historical narrative\", its early textual history is largely unknown, and the nature of its original composition and authorship have been widely debated. The \"Zuo\" of the title was traditionally believed to refer to one \"Zuo Qiuming\"an obscure figure of the 5th century BC described as a blind disciple of Confuciusbut there is little actual evidence to support this. Most scholars now generally believe that the \"Zuo zhuan\" was originally an independent work composed during the 4th century BC that was later rearranged as a commentary to the \"Annals\".\n\nNotwithstanding its prominent position throughout Chinese history as the paragon of Classical Chinese prose, little is known of the \"Zuo zhuan\"s creation and early history. Bamboo and silk manuscripts excavated from late Warring States period (c. 300) tombscombined with analyses of the \"Zuo zhuan\"s language, diction, chronological references, and philosophical viewpointssuggest that the composition of the \"Zuo zhuan\" was largely complete by 300. However, no pre-Han dynasty (206AD 220) source indicates that the \"Zuo zhuan\" had to that point been organized into any coherent form, and no texts from this period directly refer to the \"Zuo zhuan\" as a source, though a few mention its parent text \"Spring and Autumn Annals\" (\"Chunqiu\" 春秋). It seems to have had no distinct title of its own during this period, but was simply called \"Annals\" (\"Chunqiu\") along with a larger group of similar texts. In the 3rd century AD, the Chinese scholar Du Yu intercalated it with the \"Annals\" so that each \"Annals\" entry was followed by the corresponding narrative from the \"Zuo zhuan\", and this became the received format of the \"Zuo zhuan\" that exists today. Most scholars now generally believe that the \"Zuo zhuan\" was originally an independent work composed during the latter half of the 4th century BCthough probably incorporating some even older materialthat was later rearranged as a commentary to the \"Annals\".\n\nChina's first dynastic history \"Records of the Grand Historian\", completed by the historian Sima Qian in the early 1st century BC, refers to the \"Zuo zhuan\" as \"Master Zuo's \"Spring and Autumn Annals\"\" (\"Zuoshi Chunqiu\" ) and attributes it to a man named \"Zuo Qiuming\" (or possibly \"ZuoqiuMing\"). According to Sima Qian, after Confucius' death his disciples began disagreeing over their interpretations of the \"Annals\", and so Zuo Qiuming gathered together Confucius' scribal records and used them to compile the \"Zuo Annals\" in order to \"preserve the true teachings.\"\n\nThis \"Zuo Qiuming\" Sima Qian references was traditionally assumed to be the Zuo Qiuming who briefly appears in the \"Analects of Confucius\" (\"Lunyu\" 論語) when Confucius praises him for his moral judgment. Other than this brief mention, nothing is concretely known of the life or identity of the Zuo Qiuming of the \"Analects\", nor of what connection he might have with the \"Zuo zhuan\". This traditional assumption that the title's \"Master Zuo\" refers to the Zuo Qiuming of the \"Analects\" is not based on any specific evidence, and was challenged by scholars as early as the 8th century. Even if he is the \"Zuo\" referenced in the \"Zuo zhuan\"s title, this attribution is questionable because the \"Zuo zhuan\" describes events from the late Spring and Autumn period (c. 771–476) that the Zuo Qiuming of the \"Analects\" could not have known.\n\nAlternatively, a number of scholars, beginning in the 18th century, have suggested that the \"Zuo zhuan\" was actually the product of one Wu Qi (; d. 381 or 378BC), a military leader who served in the State of Wei and who, according to the \"Han Feizi\", was from a place called \"Zuoshi\". In 1792, the scholar Yao Nai wrote: \"The text [\"Zuo zhuan\"] did not come from one person. There were repeated accretions and additions, with those of Wu Qi and his followers being especially numerous...\"\n\nIn the early 19th century, the Chinese scholar Liu Fenglu (; 1776–1829) initiated a long, drawn-out controversy when he proposed, by emphasizing certain discrepancies between it and the \"Annals\", that the \"Zuo zhuan\" was not originally a commentary on the \"Annals\". Liu's theory was taken much further by the prominent scholar and reformer Kang Youwei, who argued that Liu Xin did not really find the \"ancient script\" version of the \"Zuo zhuan\" in the imperial archives, as historical records describe, but actually forged it as a commentary on the \"Annals\". Kang's theory was that Liu Xinwho with his father Liu Xiang, the imperial librarian, was one of the first to have access to the rare documents in the Han dynasty's imperial archivestook the \"Discourses of the States\" (\"Guoyu\" 國語) and forged it into a chronicle-like work to fit the format of the \"Annals\" in an attempt to lend credibility to the policies of his master, the usurper Wang Mang.\n\nKang's theory was supported by several subsequent Chinese scholars in the late 19th century, but was contradicted by many 20th-century studies that examined it from many different perspectives. In the early 1930s, the French Sinologist Henri Maspero performed a detailed textual study of the issue, concluding the Han dynasty forgery theory to be untenable. The Swedish Sinologist Bernhard Karlgren, based on a series of linguistic and philological analyses he carried out in the 1920s, concluded that the \"Zuo zhuan\" is a genuine ancient text \"probably to be dated between 468 and 300BC.\" While Liu's hypothesis that the \"Zuo zhuan\" was not originally an \"Annals\" commentary has been generally accepted, Kang's theory of Liu Xin forging the \"Zuo zhuan\" is now considered discredited.\n\nThe oldest surviving \"Zuo zhuan\" manuscripts are six fragments that were discovered among the Dunhuang manuscripts in the early 20th century by the French Sinologist Paul Pelliot and are now held at the Bibliothèque Nationale de France. Four of the fragments date to the Six Dynasties period (3rd to 6th centuries), while the other two date to the early Tang dynasty (7th century). The oldest known complete \"Zuo zhuan\" manuscript is the \"ancient manuscript scroll\" preserved at the Kanazawa Bunko Museum in Yokohama, Japan.\n\nThe \"Zuo zhuan\" recounts the major political, military, and social events of the Spring and Autumn period from the perspective of the State of Lu, and is famous \"for its dramatic power and realistic details\". It contains a variety of tense and dramatic episodes: battles and fights, royal assassinations and murder of concubines, deception and intrigue, excesses, citizens' oppression and insurgences, and appearances of ghosts and cosmic portents.\n\nThe \"Zuo zhuan\" originally contained only its core content, without any content from or references to the \"Spring and Autumn Annals\". In the 3rd century AD, the Chinese scholar Du Yu intercalated the \"Annals\" into the \"Zuo zhuan\", producing the received format that exists today. The entries follow the strict chronological format of the \"Annals\", so interrelated episodes and the actions of individual characters are sometimes separated by events that occurred in the intervening years. Each \"Zuo zhuan\" chapter begins with the \"Spring and Autumn Annals (Chunqiu)\" entry for the year, which is usually terse and brief, followed by the \"Zuo zhuan\" content for that year, which often contains long and detailed narratives.\n\nThe following entry, though unusually short, exemplifies the general format of all \"Zuo zhuan\" entries.\n\n\"Zuo zhuan\" narratives are famously terse and succincta quality that was admired and imitated throughout Chinese historyand usually focus either on speeches that illustrate ethical values, or on anecdotes in which the details of the story illuminate specific ethical points. Its narratives are characterized by parataxis, where clauses are juxtaposed without much verbal indication of their causal relationships with each other. On the other hand, the speeches and recorded discourses of the \"Zuo zhuan\" are frequently lively, ornate, and verbally complex.\n\nAlthough the \"Zuo zhuan\" was probably not originally a commentary on the \"Spring and Autumn Annals\" (\"Chunqiu\" )a work which was traditionally viewed as a direct creation of Confuciusits basic philosophical outlook is also strongly Confucian in nature. Its overarching theme is that haughty, evil, and stupid individuals generally bring disaster upon themselves, while those who are good, wise, and humble are usually justly rewarded. The Confucian principle of \"ritual propriety\" or \"ceremony\" (\"lǐ\" ) is seen as governing all actions, including war, and to bring bad consequences if transgressed. However, the observance of \"li\" is never shown as guaranteeing victory, and the \"Zuo zhuan\" includes many examples of the good and innocent suffering senseless violence. Much of the \"Zuo zhuan\"s status as a literary masterpiece stems from its \"relentlessly realistic portrayal of a turbulent era marked by violence, political strife, intrigues, and moral laxity\".\n\nThe narratives of the \"Zuo zhuan\" are highly didactic in nature, and are presented in such a way that they teach and illustrate moral principles. The German Sinologist Martin Kern observed: \"Instead of offering authorial judgments or catechistic hermeneutics, the \"Zuo zhuan\" lets its moral lessons unfold within the narrative itself, teaching at once history and historical judgment.\" Unlike the \"Histories\" of Herodotus or the \"History of the Peloponnesian War\" of Thucydideswith which it is roughly contemporarythe \"Zuo zhuan\"s narration always remains in the third person perspective, and presents as a dispassionate recorder of facts.\n\nSeveral of the \"Zuo zhuan\"s most famous sections are those dealing with critical historical battles, such as the Battle of Chengpu and the Battle of Bi.\n\nThe Battle of Chengpu, the first of the \"Zuo zhuan\"s great battles, took place in the summer of 632 at Chengpu (now Juancheng County, Shandong Province) in the State of Wey. On one side were the troops of the powerful State of Chu, from what was then far southern China, led by the Chu prime minister Cheng Dechen. They were opposed by the armies of the State of Jin, led by Chong'er, Duke of Jin, one of the most prominent and well known figures in the \"Zuo zhuan\". Chu suffered a disastrous defeat in the battle itself, and it resulted in Chong'er being named Hegemon (\"bà\" ) of the various states.\n\nThe narrative of the Battle of Chengpu is typical of \"Zuo zhuan\" battle narratives: the description of the battle itself is relatively brief, with most of the narrative being focused on battle preparations, omens and prognostications regarding its outcome, the division of the spoils, and the shifts and defections of the various allied states involved in the conflict. This \"official [and] restrained\" style, which became typical of Chinese historical writing, is largely due to the ancient Chinese belief that ritual propriety and strategic preparation were more important than individual valor or bravery in determining the outcome of battles.\n\nSeveral of the most notable passages in the \"Zuo zhuan\" describe succession crises, which seem to have been fairly common in China during the Spring and Autumn period. These crises often involved the \"tangled affections\" of the various rulers, and are described in a dramatic and vivid manner that gives insight into the life of the aristocratic elite in the China of the mid-1st millennium. The best known of these stories is that of Duke Zhuang of Zheng, who ruled the State of Zheng from 743 to 701. Duke Zhuang was born \"in a manner that startled\" his mother (probably breech birth), which caused her to later seek to persuade her husband to name Duke Zhuang's younger brother as the heir apparent instead of him. The story ends with eventual reconciliation between mother and son, thus exemplifying the traditional Chinese virtues of both \"ritual propriety\" (\"lǐ\") and \"filial piety\" (\"xiào\"), which has made it consistently popular with readers over the centuries.\n\nA number of \"Zuo zhuan\" anecdotes end with brief moral comments or verdicts that are attributed to either Confucius or an unnamed \"junzi\" (; \"gentleman\", \"lordling\", or \"superior man\"). \n\nThese \"moral of the story\" postfaces, which were added later by Confucian scholars, are directed toward those currently in power, reminding them of \"the historical precedents and inevitable consequences of their own actions.\" They speak with the voices of previous ministers, advisers, \"old men\", and other anonymous figures to remind rulers of historical and moral lessons, and suggest that ruler who heed their advice will succeed, while those who do not will fail.\n\nSeveral sections of the \"Zuo zhuan\" demonstrate the traditional Chinese concept of \"fate\" or \"destiny\" (\"mìng\" ), referring either to an individual's mission in life or their allotted lifespan, and illustrates how benevolent rulers ought to accept \"fate\" selflessly, as in the story of Duke Wen moving the capital of the state of Zhu in 614.\nThe \"Zuo zhuan\" has been recognized as a masterpiece of early Chinese prose and \"grand historical narrative\" for many centuries. It has had an immense influence on Chinese literature and historiography for nearly 2000 years, and was the primary text by which historical Chinese readers gained an understanding of China's ancient history. It enjoyed high status and esteem throughout the centuries of Chinese history because of its great literary quality, and was often read and memorized because of its role as the preeminent expansion and commentary on the \"Annals\" (\"Chunqiu\"), which almost all Chinese traditionally ascribed to Confucius. It was commonly believed throughout much of Chinese history that the terse, succinct entries of the \"Annals\" contained cryptic references to Confucius' \"profound moral judgments on the events of the past as well as those of his own day and on the relation of human events to those in the natural order\", and that the \"Zuo zhuan\" was written to clarify or even \"decode\" these hidden judgments.\n\nFrom the Han dynasty (206AD 220) down to the present day, the \"Zuo zhuan\" has been viewed as a model of correct, elegant, and sophisticated Classical Chinese prose. The \"Zuo zhuan\"s great influence on the Chinese languageparticularly on Classical Chineseis evident from the fact that it is the source of more Chinese literary idioms (\"chéngyǔ\" ) than any other work, including the \"Analects of Confucius\". The well-known Qing dynasty student anthology \"Guwen Guanzhi\" included 34 passages from the \"Zuo zhuan\" as paragons of Classical Chinese prose more than any other source. These passages are still part of the Classical Chinese curriculum in mainland China and Taiwan today.\n\nThe 400-year period the \"Zuo zhuan\" covers is now known as the Spring and Autumn period, after the \"Spring and Autumn Annals\", but the \"Zuo zhuan\" is the most important source for the period. This era was highly significant in Chinese history, and saw a number of developments in governmental complexity and specialization that preceded China's imperial unification in 221BC by the First Emperor of Qin. The latter years of this period also saw the appearance of Confucius, who later became the preeminent figure in Chinese cultural history. The \"Zuo zhuan\" is one of the only surviving written sources for the history of the Spring and Autumn period, and is extremely valuable as a rich source of information on the society that Confucius and his disciples lived in and from which the Confucian school of thought developed. It was canonized as one of the Chinese classics in the 1st century AD, and until modern times was one of the cornerstones of traditional education for men in China and the other lands of the Sinosphere such as Japan and Korea.\n\n\n\n"}

It is a zero-configuration service, using essentially the same programming interfaces, packet formats and operating semantics as the unicast Domain Name System (DNS). Although Stuart Cheshire designed mDNS as a stand-alone protocol, it can work in concert with standard DNS servers.\n\nThe mDNS protocol is published as , uses IP multicast User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets, and is implemented by the Apple Bonjour and open source Avahi software packages, included in most Linux distributions. Android contains an mDNS implementation. mDNS has also been implemented in Windows 10, initially limited to discovering networked printers, later becoming capable of resolving hostnames as well.\n\nmDNS can work in conjunction with DNS Service Discovery (DNS-SD), a companion zero-configuration technique specified separately in RFC 6763.\n\nWhen an mDNS client needs to resolve a hostname, it sends an IP multicast query message that asks the host having that name to identify itself. That target machine then multicasts a message that includes its IP address. All machines in that subnet can then use that information to update their mDNS caches. Any host can relinquish its claim to a name by sending a response packet with a time to live (TTL) equal to zero.\n\nBy default, mDNS exclusively resolves hostnames ending with the codice_1 top-level domain (TLD). This can cause problems if that domain includes hosts which do not implement mDNS but which can be found via a conventional unicast DNS server. Resolving such conflicts requires network-configuration changes that violate the zero-configuration goal.\n\nAn mDNS message is a multicast UDP packet sent using the following addressing:\n\nThe payload structure is based on the unicast DNS packet format, consisting of two parts—the header and the data.\n\nThe header is identical to that found in unicast DNS, as are the sub-sections in the data part: queries, answers, authoritative-nameservers, and additional records. The number of records in each sub-section matches the value of the corresponding *COUNT field in the header.\n\nThe wire format for records in the query section is slightly modified from that in unicast DNS, adding the single-bit UNICAST-RESPONSE field.\nAs in unicast DNS, the QNAME field consists of a series of length/value sub-fields called \"labels\". Each label represents one of the dot-separated substrings in a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). The list is terminated by a single null-byte, representing the \"root\" of the DNS.\n\nThe UNICAST-RESPONSE field is used to minimize unnecessary broadcasts on the network: if the bit is set, responders SHOULD send a directed-unicast response directly to the inquiring node rather than broadcasting the response to the entire network.\n\nThe QCLASS field is identical to that found in unicast DNS.\n\nAll records in the answers, authoritative-nameservers, and additional records sections have the same format and are collectively known as Resource Records (RR).\n\nResource Records in mDNS also have a slightly modified general format compared to unicast DNS:\nThe CACHE-FLUSH bit is used to instruct neighbor nodes that the record should overwrite, rather than be appended onto, any existing cached entries for this RRNAME and RRTYPE.\n\nThe formats of the RDATA fields are the same as those found in unicast DNS. However, DNS Service Discovery (DNS-SD), the most common use-case for mDNS, specifies slight modifications to some of their formats (notably TXT records).\n\n\n"}

In 1995, Laurent Brancowitz, Mazzalai's older brother, permanently joined the band on guitar after the end of Darlin', a short-lived band that Brancowitz had formed with Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, who would later form electronic duo Daft Punk. Two years later the band took on the name Phoenix and pressed 500 copies of a single on their own label, Ghettoblaster. Shortly after, they were signed to the Paris-based Source Records. Phoenix quickly became well acquainted with labelmates Air when they acted as their backing band on several UK TV appearances.\n\nPhoenix began releasing singles in 1999, the first of these being \"Heatwave\" and \"Party Time\", the latter of which would eventually appear on their debut album, \"United\". The single \"Too Young\" was released on 22 May 2000, along with remixes of the track by Zoot Woman and Le Knight Club. \"Too Young\" was the band's first single to chart, reaching No. 97 in France and No. 148 in the UK. The band's debut album, \"United\", was released on 12 June 2000. It featured the singles \"Party Time\" and \"Too Young\", with \"If I Ever Feel Better\" being announced as the third single from the album on 22 January 2001, and charting in several countries, reaching No. 12 in France and No. 4 in Italy. \"United\" received positive reviews, although the band did not reach mainstream success. \"Too Young\" was included on the soundtrack for the movie \"Lost in Translation\" (which was directed by Mars' future wife, Sofia Coppola), as well as in the movie \"Shallow Hal\".\n\nShortly after the release of \"United\", Phoenix began work on a second album, recording in 2003 and 2004 and releasing the singles \"Run Run Run\" and \"Everything Is Everything\" in 2004.

French fashion designer Hedi Slimane commissioned a special mix of their song \"Victim of the Crime\", taken from \"Alphabetical\", as the soundtrack to one of his runway shows for menswear clothing retailer Dior Homme.\n\nFollowing \"Alphabetical\", the band toured three continents, playing 150 dates. This tour was followed up with a live album, \"Live! Thirty Days Ago\", released only thirty days after the end of the tour.\n\nAfter their \"Alphabetical\" tour, Phoenix spent time in Berlin during the summer of 2005, making use of Planet Roc studios to produce their third album. On 8 May 2006, the band released the lead single from the album, titled \"Long Distance Call\". American band Paramore would go on to perform a cover of the song live on \"Taratata\", a French TV show. Phoenix's third studio album, titled \"It's Never Been Like That\", was released on 15 May 2006. To promote the release of the album, Phoenix toured the United States and Europe in 2006. The album charted in several countries, reaching even greater success than \"Alphabetical\", although it still did not chart in much of North America. \"It's Never Been Like That\" was re-released in Mexico later that year, with the so-called \"tour edition\" featuring four bonus tracks recorded live in Oslo from the tour. On 11 September 2006, the track \"Consolation Prizes\" was announced to be the second single from \"It's Never Been Like That\".\n\nPhoenix curated a compilation album for French electronic music record and fashion label Kitsuné. It was released on 23 March 2009, and includes music by Elvis Costello, Roxy Music, Kiss, Lou Reed and others.\n\nIn early 2009, around the time of the release of the Phoenix's compilation album for Kitsuné, it was announced that the band would be returning with a new album titled \"Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix\", which would be released on 25 May 2009. The album was recorded in Paris, and was co-produced and mixed by Philippe Zdar of Cassius. \"1901\", a tribute to early Paris, was released on 23 February 2009 on the band's website as a free download. Due to extremely positive reviews, the song was then issued as a retail single and aired for the first time on Australian radio station Triple J. In June 2009, after the release of the album, Phoenix first appeared on the cover of the 62nd issue of \"The FADER\" publication. As the album's popularity rapidly grew, \"Lisztomania\" and \"Lasso\" were issued as the second and third singles from \"Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix\".\n\nAs it became apparent that \"1901\" was Phoenix's biggest success yet, the song was performed live on several TV shows and began to appear everywhere. \"1901\" was featured in the US during Super Bowl XLV in a Green Bay Packers montage, and was also performed on \"Saturday Night Live\" along with \"Too Young\" and \"Lisztomania\" on April 4. Phoenix also performed \"Lisztomania\" on \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\", \"Girlfriend\" on \"The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson\", and \"1901\" on the \"Late Show with David Letterman\", \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" and \"The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien\".\n\n\"Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix\" won Best Alternative Music Album at the 2009 Grammy Awards on 31 January 2010. Shortly afterwards, \"1901\" hit No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" Hot Alternative Songs chart. The album was the first Phoenix album to be certified gold and appeared on numerous \"Best of\" lists at the end of 2010, including \"Rolling Stone\" magazine. In addition, \"1901\" and \"Lisztomania\" were certified platinum and gold, respectively.\n\nFollowing the album's release, Phoenix appeared at various major music festivals, including the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2009, Coachella Music Festival in Indio, California in 2010, the 2010 Bonnaroo Music Festival, the Southside Festival and Hurricane Festival in Germany, the 2010 Lollapalooza Music Festival, the Mile High Music Festival, Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival in San Francisco, California, Rock Werchter 2010 in Belgium, and the 2010 Reading and Leeds Festivals. On 20 October 2010, French electronic music group Daft Punk, composing of guitarist Christian Mazzalai's childhood friends Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, made a special appearance for their show in Madison Square Garden.\n\nAllMusic, a review website, commented favourably on the release of the album. \"Beyond containing the band's best, most efficient songwriting, the album also stands apart from the first three studio albums by projecting a cool punch that is unforced,\" a reviewer commented. Vocalist Thomas Mars, described as \"more bright-eyed and youthful than ever\", is more prominent in these songs, harmonising with the instruments. \"Maybe they've just hit their stride,\" the reviewer said.\n\nPhoenix are the subject of a documentary \"From a Mess to the Masses\" that documents their 2009–10 tour in support of \"Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix\". The film was directed by Antoine Wagner and Francisco Soriano—Wagner was also responsible for directing the \"Lisztomania\" music video. The title of the documentary is a lyrical excerpt from \"Lisztomania\" and the total running time is 52 minutes. \"From a Mess to the Masses\" premiered in Germany and France on the Arte television network on 13 October 2011.\n\nOn 5 April 2011, the band posted a blog update on their website entitled \"Songwriting...\" that revealed CCTV stills of a studio in which the band was working. The band stated in interviews that the album would be a departure from the pop sounds of \"Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix\", and they were trying to create something more experimental. That same year, vocalist Thomas Mars married American screenwriter and director Sofia Coppola, whom he had met while producing the soundtrack to \"The Virgin Suicides\" in 1999.\n\nOn 16 January 2012, the band revealed that they had completed four songs for the fifth album and it was scheduled for a late summer 2012 release, with an autumn tour. Daniel Glass, the founder of Glassnote Records, stated in relation to the material, \"It's very hard to beat \"Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix\", but this could be revolutionary.\" The band then updated its webpage to display the cryptic words \"Pluviôse\" (until the end of March 2012), \"Thermidor\" (from April 2012) and \"Vendémiaire\" (from September 2012)—the words replaced the CCTV still that was published in October 2011. \"Pluviôse\", \"Thermidor\" and \"Vendémiaire\" are three of the months of the French Republican Calendar (also known as the Revolutionary Calendar). Although the band had previously announced that a new album would be released in late summer 2012, no announcement was made about the album's release.\n\nOn 16 January 2013, exactly one year after the announcement that the band had completed four songs for the album, \"Bankrupt!\" was revealed as the title of the fifth album and a teaser was released on the Phoenix website. On 12 February 2013, a redesigned Phoenix website further promoted the \"Bankrupt!\" album, with an official release date of 22 April 2013, published on the website's opening page that features an animated writing sequence. A message from the band is written by an invisible hand, while music plays and states, mostly in English, with some French: \"Dear all, our new album, Bankrupt!, will be released the week of April 22nd. Here [the word \"Here\" is a link to the website page that reveals both the album cover art and the track listing] is the track listing as well as the album cover. Much love \"et à bientôt\" [\"and see you soon\"]. Thomas Branco Mazzalai Deck.\" The cover depicts a color drawing of a peach next to a peach slice, with a pink flower and two green leaves; the track listing included song titles such as the title track, \"S.O.S. in Bel Air\", \"Bourgeois\", and \"Oblique City\". Consistent updates in relation to the fifth album appeared on the band's Facebook page and, from 12 February 2013, the page reflected the aesthetic of \"Bankrupt!\". On 21 January 2013, the page's cover photo was changed to a straightforward pink and black image in which the words \"Phoenix Bankrupt!\" were written in large, bold and black capital letters against a plain pink background. This cover photo was then replaced on 12 February 2013 with an image of the word \"Phoenix\" written in large, bold and white capital letters against a light grey background. A schedule of the major music festivals that Phoenix would perform at in support of the new album was announced and headline positions were confirmed for Germany's Rock am Ring and Rock im Park Festivals, Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, Primavera Sound, and Lollapalooza. The band also appeared at the Beale Street Music Festival in Memphis, Tennessee, and appeared alongside acts such as Beyoncé and Nine Inch Nails at the \"Made in America\" festival during Labor Day weekend in Philadelphia, US.\n\nOn 18 February 2013, the band released \"Entertainment\", the first single from the album. A music video for the song, directed by Patrick Daughters, was released on 7 March 2013. On 28 March, Phoenix started their 2013 tour in Vancouver, Canada, at the Queen Elizabeth Theatre and performed their first concert in two years—the show's set list included \"Sunskrupt!\", a song that combines \"Bankrupt!\" and \"Love Like a Sunset\". Phoenix performed on American television during the next month—on 6 April, Phoenix was the musical guest on \"Saturday Night Live\" and performed \"Entertainment\" and \"Trying to Be Cool/Drakkar Noir\"; on 18 April 2013, the band repeated the two-song set list on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\".\n\nOn 22 April 2013, Phoenix played a rare London show at Shepherd's Bush Empire on the day that \"Bankrupt!\" was released. Mars entered the crowd and sang while immersed in the audience for a large portion of the show; he then climbed up cables to the first-level balcony and \"crowd-surfed\" his way back to the stage. In a review of the performance, music writer Josh Holliday declared: \"And along with peace, love and understanding, what the world needs now is a band we can all believe in as one. That band is Phoenix.\" On 6 May 2013, Phoenix were taped for the thirty-ninth season of live music television series \"Austin City Limits\" (\"ACL\") at Moody Theatre in Austin, Texas, US. Mars again sang from the audience and, at the end, walked onto the mezzanine while singing and thanked the audience along the way. Terry Likona, executive producer of the show, announced that Phoenix would co-headline the two-weekend Austin City Limits Music Festival in October 2013, alongside other big acts such as Kings of Leon, Wilco, and Depeche Mode.\n\nIn media articles on \"Bankrupt!\" after the album's release, Mars provided insight into the circumstances that influenced the creation of the band's fifth album: \"At that time, we started talking about success and not music. I guess it was time to protect ourselves and focus on music again.\" Mars made reference to the period of intensive public attention that occurred in the wake of the Grammy Award-winning \"Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix\", Phoenix's first record to achieve gold certification. Mars also reflected on the benefits of the band's belated success: \"We're lucky that we didn't have a hit single for a while, so when we play live, people are not expecting just one song, and we don't tour as a greatest hits band, which can be sad, I'm sure.\" In a more general sense, Mars also emphasized the importance of the live setting for Phoenix and its relationship to studio work: \"I guess we're perfectionists in the way that when we make an album, we know it's going to last. It's important that it's exactly how we want it to be. But when the record is done, it's all about imperfection. It's all about playing live.\" Phoenix also used the Harrison 4032 solid-state recording console, the same console used on Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\", to mix \"Bankrupt!\". The console was purchased on eBay and shipped to Paris. \"Bankrupt!\" debuted at number 4 on the American \"Billboard\" 200 albums chart and a Phoenix world tour was completed over a large part of 2013.\n\nPhoenix appeared in the 2015 Netflix special \"A Very Murray Christmas\", directed by Mars' wife Sofia Coppola. The group performed a cover of The Beach Boys' \"Alone on Christmas Day\", with Bill Murray providing backing vocals.\n\nIn November 2016, Phoenix mysteriously changed their social media themes to a television holding screen image. They also announced a series of festival appearances in Spain and France. On 4 January 2017, it was announced that they would be in a headlining spot at Governors Ball in New York City the first weekend of June, which would be their first show since 2014. In March they announced to be playing two warm-up shows on April 22 and 23 in Antwerp, Belgium.\n\nOn 1 March 2017, Phoenix again updated social media, teasing new music with a 30-second clip, and announcing multiple tour dates. By 24 April 2017, the band had announced that their sixth album, \"Ti Amo\", would be released on 9 June 2017. Three days later, on 27 April 2017, the band released the album's first single, \"J-Boy\" (an acronym for \"Just Because of You\"). This was followed by the release of the title track, \"Ti Amo\", on 18 May 2017 and the single \"Goodbye Soleil\" on 2 June 2017, a week before the album's release. Phoenix toured worldwide to promote the release of \"Ti Amo\".\n\nThe band performed residency shows in Paris, New York City, Los Angeles, Tokyo, and Mexico City titled, \"A Very Speciale Night with Phoenix\". It featured exclusive merchandise, Phoenix vending machine, gelato (food selection varied at shows), discoteca after party, live music, special guests, and Phoenix sake. \n\nIn 2017, Phoenix collaborated with Tatenokawa, Inc., a brewery from Yamagata Prefecture, Japan, as a tribute for their late friend Toshiro Kuroda, a Japanese restaurateur who ran a store in Paris called Workshop Isse which offered food and sake from Japan. This store was on the ground floor of Christian Mazzalai's apartment building, which is how he became to be friends with Kuroda. During the band's Japan tour while promoting \"Bankrupt!\", Kuroda took the band to visit sake breweries in Japan, one of which was Tatenokawa, Inc.\n\nPhoenix and Tatenokawa, Inc. created Phoenix Sake Collection, which features Tatenokawa Phoenix (also referred to as Rainbow Label) and Sparkling sake. The Sparking sake was created to commemorate the band's 20th Anniversary.\n\nThe collection also featured limited-edition brews: Tatenokawa Junmai Daiginjo, Kaze no Mori Junmai Daiginjo (from Nara Prefecture), and Sohomare Junmai Ginjo (from Tochigi Prefecture). The bottles were wrapped in a hand-dyed washcloth featuring illustrations of the band and sake logo. A portion of the sales were donated to the Japanese Red Cross. \n\n\n\nPhoenix has won:\n\n"}

He only lost one Test series as captain, against Pakistan away, and he became a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1984.\n\nConey was the captain who in 1986, after the England wicketkeeper Bruce French was injured by a Hadlee bouncer, allowed Bob Taylor to leave the sponsor's tent and play as a substitute. New Zealand won that series with the bowling of Richard Hadlee only slightly more potent than the captaincy of Coney. His medium-pace bowling was often used in ODIs, where it yielded 54 wickets, including four for 46 against Sri Lanka in 1985.\n\nDuring his playing days, Coney's height, reach, and reactions as a slip fieldsman, earned him the nickname \"The Mantis\". He wrote \"Playing Mantis: An Autobiography\" in 1986. Along with John Parker and Bryan Waddle, he wrote \"The Wonderful Days of Summer\" in 1993.\n\nIn the 1986 Queen's Birthday Honours, Coney was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to cricket. In 1990, he was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal.\n\nIn 2001 he made a television documentary series, \"The Mantis and the Cricket\", which looked back on New Zealand's cricket history, using interviews with former players and historical footage. The first part follows the 1937 New Zealand Cricket team which toured England with interviews of Walter Hadlee, Merv Wallace, Jack Kerr and Lindsay Weir.\n\nHe now lives in south Oxfordshire and works as a commentator/summariser for Sky TV and Test Match Special, where he is noted for his regular use of the word \"parsimonious\". Coney is trained as a stage lighting designer; in 2008 he lit \"I Found My Horn\", a solo play which has enjoyed runs at the Tristan Bates and the Hampstead theatres.\n"}

The song, coupled with \"Let's Spend the Night Together\", was a number-one hit in the United States and reached number three in the United Kingdom. The song was included in the American version of \"Between the Buttons\" (in the UK, singles were often excluded from studio albums).\n\n\"Rolling Stone\" magazine ranked the song number 310 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\n\"Ruby Tuesday\" was recorded at Olympic Studios in London, England in November 1966 . The session was produced by Andrew Loog Oldham. Brian Jones played the recorder and piano, whilst the double bass was played jointly by bassist Bill Wyman and guitarist Keith Richards.\n\nRichards explained that the lyrics are about Linda Keith, his girlfriend in the mid-1960s:\n\n\"That's a wonderful song,\" Mick Jagger told Jann Wenner in 1995. \"It's just a nice melody, really. And a lovely lyric. Neither of which I wrote, but I always enjoy singing it.\" Wyman states in \"Rolling with the Stones\" that the lyrics were completely written by Richards with help from Jones on the musical composition. However, Marianne Faithfull recalls it differently; according to her, Jones presented an early version of this melody to the rest of the Rolling Stones. According to Victor Bockris, Richards came up with the basic track and the words and finished the song with Jones in the studio.\n\n\"Ruby Tuesday\" was released as the B-side to \"Let's Spend the Night Together\" on January 1967. Due to the controversial nature of the A-side's lyrics, \"Ruby Tuesday\" earned more airplay and ended up charting higher in both the UK and the US. The song topped the American \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart, while reaching number three in the UK's Record Retailer chart, which listed \"Let's Spend The Night Together\"/\"Ruby Tuesday\" as a double A-side.\n\n\"Ruby Tuesday\" was included on the US version of the 1967 album \"Between the Buttons\", while being left out of the British edition, as was common practice with singles in the UK at that time. That summer, the song appeared on the US compilation album \"Flowers\". Due to its success, the song became a staple of the band's compilations, being included on \"Through the Past, Darkly (Big Hits Vol. 2)\" (1969), \"Hot Rocks 1964–1971\" (1971), \"\" (1975), and \"30 Greatest Hits\" (1977), and, in mono, on \"\" (1989).\n\n\"Ruby Tuesday\" was first played live on Brian Jones' last concert tour The Rolling Stones European Tour 1967. The next time was on the Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle Tour in 1989/1990. A concert rendition from this tour was featured on the band's 1991 live album \"Flashpoint\" and released as a single.. This live version was recorded in Japan in 1990 and can be seen on the video release \"Live at the Tokyo Dome\".

{"id": "2283036", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2283036", "title": "Savanna Portage State Park", "text": "Savanna Portage State Park\n\nSavanna Portage State Park is a state park of Minnesota, USA, established in 1961 to preserve the historic Savanna Portage, a difficult trail connecting the watersheds of the Mississippi River and Lake Superior. The portage trail crosses a drainage divide separating the West Savanna River, which drains to the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico, from the East Savanna River, which flows in an opposite direction to the Saint Louis River, Lake Superior and the Great Lakes, and the Saint Lawrence River to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nSavanna Portage was a canoe portage used by Native Americans for centuries before being used by European explorers, fur traders, Voyageurs, \"coureurs des bois\", and missionaries of the 18th and 19th centuries. It was a vital link connecting the Mississippi waterways to the west with the Great Lakes to the east. The portage was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 for having state-level significance in the themes of commerce, exploration/settlement, and transportation. The park which now contains it is located north and east of McGregor, Minnesota, and approximately west of Duluth.\n\nThe park is located on the divide between the watersheds of the Great Lakes and the Gulf of Mexico, both of which drain to the Atlantic Ocean. The area is a low-relief plain which was once a glacial lakebed. During the last phase of the Wisconsinan glaciation, the deteriorating continental glacier left behind connected lakes, known as Glacial Lakes Aitkin and Upham. Formed by the retreat of the Saint Louis Sublobe of the Superior Lobe of the glacier, Lake Upham drained through Lake Aitkin to the Mississippi River. The retreating glacier and the lakes deposited sand and sediments in the lakebed. As the lakes drained these sediments became the present plain.\n\nThe plain at first was drained by the Cloquet River, which then ran west to the Mississippi River. By the process of stream piracy, the smaller Saint Louis River, which runs to Lake Superior, captured the Cloquet River and most of its drainage basin. This left behind the East Savanna River which drains into the Saint Louis River, Lake Superior, the lower Great Lakes, and the Saint Lawrence River, and to the west, the West Savanna River, which is tributary to the Mississippi River.\n\nThe old lake plain is part of the Tamarack Lowlands Subsection within the Northern Minnesota Drift Plains Section of the Laurentian Mixed Forest. Lacustrine sediments deposited by the glacial lake are parent to the present soils of peats, silt, and sand; the peats are in marshes which form large parts of the park. These wet lowlands adjoin rolling hills which are end moraines of the recent glaciation. The moraines are part of the Saint Louis Moraines Subdivision of the Northern Minnesota Drift Plain.\n\nThe plain in the old lakebed provided a low-grade but very swampy overland route across the divide between the East and West Savanna Rivers. Wolf Lake, source of the East Savanna River, is only about east of Savanna Lake on the West Savanna. As Wolf Lake and the upper East Savanna River are quite wet, the route selected for the portage trail departed from the river further downstream, shortening the distance to be traveled through the bog. The portage, some long, starts in the swamp and then goes west in a wooded upland to reach the West Savanna River.\n\nLong used by Native Americans, it became a thoroughfare between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi Valley for explorers, missionaries, and fur traders. Travelers from the east exited Lake Superior near Fond du Lac (\"end of the lake\", or more idiomatically \"head of the lake\", where Duluth is now located), and ascended the steep, rocky, and difficult gorge of the lower Saint Louis River, which falls some from the location of Carlton, Minnesota, through what is now Jay Cooke State Park to its outlet at the lake. Above Carlton travelers proceeded upstream through quieter stretches to the location of Floodwood, Minnesota, where they turned southwest up the sluggish East Savanna River in the bed of Glacial Lake Upham. Coming to a small rise, the travelers commenced the portage, which in its eastern reaches was marshy, mosquito-infested, and among the most unpleasant and even tortuous of all the routes taken by the voyageurs. Struggling waist-deep through the morass of the \"boundless swamp\", travelers eventually reached a hardwood forest, through which the trail ran to the West Savanna River, which drains to Big Sandy Lake and the Upper Mississippi River. In times of low water, the portage was drier but the river became too shallow for canoes, so voyageurs would continue to hike overland to the northeast bay of Big Sandy Lake.\n\nThe portage likely was used by Europeans as early as 1679, when Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut visited a Sioux village at Big Sandy Lake during his exploration of the Lake Superior region and the Upper Mississippi River. Among the portage's users were fur traders who operated in the upper Mississippi River valley. Some went no further than the American Fur Company's large regional trading post on Big Sandy Lake operated by William Aitkin in the 1820s and 1830s, the years of peak usage of the route. Explorers and scientists crossing the portage included David Thompson, British explorer of Canada and North West Fur Company cartographer, in 1798; Zebulon Pike, early explorer of the American west, in 1805; Lewis Cass, American general and explorer, in his unsuccessful 1820 search for the source of the Mississippi River; Henry Schoolcraft, geologist and explorer, who accompanied Cass in 1820 and led an expedition in 1832 to find the Mississippi River's source; Joseph Nicollet, French geographer and cartographer of the Upper Mississippi River, in 1836; and Laurence Oliphant, a British explorer and writer, in 1854. Tourists such as Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin, who crossed in 1863, also used the portage.\n\nWhen the Northern Pacific Railroad, building west from Duluth, reached nearby McGregor in 1870, the portage fell out of use for through traffic, but continued to be used for local trade and access to the interior. The trail's location was traced and marked in 1926 and in the 1940s through the 1960s, and with the use of archaeological techniques, it was more precisely marked in 1981. Most of the route is now maintained as a hiking trail.\n\nThe interest created by investigations into the trail's route inspired creation of Savanna Portage State Park in 1961. At some , it became the third-largest park in the system. It includes within it the Floodwood Game Refuge; the park in turn is nearly surrounded by the Savanna State Forest. It is some long and nowhere more than wide, its shape dictated in part by the portage corridor.\n\nNamed for its open marshy grassland, the park's peat bogs and marshes include sedges and black spruce, tamarack, and white cedar. Uplands host a mixed hardwood and conifer forest of maple, oak, poplar, birch, white pine, and red pine.\n\nLand animals in the area include moose, black bears, deer, timber wolves, coyotes, skunks, amphibians, and wood turtles. Birds include bald eagles, sharp-tailed grouse, warblers, boreal owls from Canada which winter in the area, sandhill cranes, trumpeter swans, and loons.\n\n\n"}

She gathered in Irvine, Ayrshire, a group of followers who broke away from the Relief Church when Hugh White, minister at Irvine, declared Elspeth Buchan(1739-1791) to be a special saint identified with the woman described in Revelation 12.\n\nElspeth Buchan was born in Fordyce, Banff, Elspeth Simpson daughter of John Simpson and Margaret Gordon and married Robert Buchan and hence the name.\n\nThe Buchanites were expelled from Irvine, residents even threatening to drown them in the town's Scott's Loch. Eventually they made their way to Closeburn (north of Dumfries) in 1784, where they prepared to ascend \"en bloc\" at short notice to Heaven. As with many controversial sects in various times and places, they were rumoured by a disapproving society to have practised behaviour that contravened social norms – \"a community of wives\" or \"orgies in the woods\"; but there is no conclusive proof that they did either. They were expelled from Dumfriesshire in 1787 and then settled in various farms in the Crocketford area (Stewartry of Kirkcudbright) before finally settling at Newhouse in the village of Crocketford.\n\nMrs Buchan died of natural causes in 1791, disproving her claim to immortality. The end of the Buchanite saga came in 1846, when the last \"adherent\", Andrew Innes, died. Innes, who lived in the (still existing) Buchanite last abode, \"Newhouse\", Crocketford, had expected a \"resurrection\" of the mummified body of Mother Buchan on 29 March 1841 - the 50th anniversary of her death. He was disappointed and died at \"Newhouse\" in 1846 - a death which coincided with the discovery of Mother Buchan's hidden mummified body. Many Buchanites were buried (or reburied) in a graveyard next to the north-west wall of \"Newhouse\", in the expectation that they would \"ascend\" eventually with \"Lucky\" Buchan.\n\nThe Buchanites are remembered in Scottish literature in the works of John Galt, who was a four-year-old child in Irvine when the sect was expelled. According to Galt's autobiography, he \"with many children also accompanied her, but my mother in a state of distraction pursued, and drew me back by the lug and the horn. [...] [T]he scene, and more than once the enthusiasm of [their] psalm singing, has risen in my remembrance, especially in describing the Covenanters in \"Ringan Gilhaize\".\"\n\nThey are also mentioned - quite negatively - in a letter by Robert Burns: \"[A]bout two years ago, a Mrs Buchan from Glasgow came among them, & began to spread some fanatical notions of religion among them, [...] till in spring last the Populace rose & mobbed the old leader Buchan & put her out of the town; on which all her followers voluntarily quit the place likewise, & with such precipitation, that many of them never shut their doors behind them [...] Their tenets are a strange jumble of enthusiastic jargon; among others, she pretends to give them the Holy Ghost by breathing on them, which she does with postures & practices that are scandalously indecent. They have likewise disposed of all life, carrying on a great farce of pretended devotion in barns, & woods, where they lodge and lye all together, & hold likewise a community of women, as it is another of their tenets that they can commit no moral sin. [...] This My Dear Sir, is one of the many instances of the folly in leaving the guidance of sound reason, & common sense in matters of Religion.\"\n\nThe Buchanites are the subject of a 1937 novella by F. L. Lucas, \"The Woman Clothed with the Sun\", which takes the form of an account, written by a Scottish minister in middle age, of his youthful bewitchment by Elspeth Buchan and of his curious sojourn in the Buchanite communes of Dumfriesshire and Kirkcudbrightshire.\n\nRobert Burns in his \"Interleaved Scots Musical Museum\" noted for the song \"The Beds of sweet Roses\" that \"This song, as far as I know, for the first time appears here in print --- When I was a boy, it was a very popular song in Ayrshire, I remember to have heard those fanatics, the Buchanites, sing some of their nonsensical rhymes, which they dignify with the name of hymns, to this air\".\n\n"}

The vineyard achieved international visibility when one of the winery's Chardonnays was featured in the 1976 wine tasting competition that became known as the Judgment of Paris. Today the winery specializes in Pinot noir.\n\nDavid Bruce Winery was founded during the revival of the Santa Cruz Mountain wine industry between the 1950s and 1970s. Bruce selected his vineyard site because of its proximity to Martin Ray and with the belief that the high elevation and mesoclimate of the area would be well suited for growing the Burgundian wine grapes of Pinot noir and Chardonnay.\n\nIn 1975, British wine merchant Steven Spurrier selected 1973 bottling of David Bruce Chardonnay for his 1976 Paris tasting that would put Californian Chardonnays and Cabernet Sauvignon against their French counterparts from Burgundy and Bordeaux, respectively. While the overall Chardonnay category was won by a Californian wine from Napa Valley, the 1973 David Bruce Chardonnay placed last of the 10 Chardonnays being tasted.\n\n"}

They serve both to identify and embellish the building. They are also called \"stone tablets\" by the Rijksmuseum, which sometimes appends \"from a facade\". A \"wall stone\" is another suggested translation from the Dutch term.\n\nThe content of gable stones may explain something about the house's owner and are a feature of the urban fabric of Amsterdam. Some 2,500 of these stones can still be found in the Netherlands, of which around 850 are in Amsterdam and 250 in Maastricht, while others are also found in cities such as Brussels, Lille and Copenhagen.\n\nGable stones came into use in the 16th century, in the days before house numbers, taking over from hanging signs as a way of simultaneously and memorably identifying and adorning a house.\n\nThe tradition is alive and has moved with the times – new stones are still commissioned, and for instance the Rabobank at Frederiksplein 54 in Amsterdam wistfully commemorates the introduction of the euro with a stone entitled \"De eerste en de laatste gulden\" (The first and the last guilder), created by Zutphen sculptor Hans 't Mannetje.\n\nIn Amsterdam, many gable stones have been conserved by the Vereniging Vrienden van Amsterdamse Gevelstenen (VVAG) or Friends of Amsterdam Gable Stones. \n\nThey normally combine a picture with an inscription, or sometimes just a date. Some illustrate the name or profession of the owner, for instance a quill pen as a badge for an author, or a ship for a sailor. Some are named after notable people (The King of Bohemia) or faraway trading destinations (Königsberg). Some stones act as talismans, quoting from holy scripture. A pious motto repeatedly found on Dutch gable stones is \"Nooit Volmaakt\" (Never Perfect), a testimony to the householder's belief that only God can achieve perfection. Going beyond practicality or superstition, some stones make a joke, usually a visual pun. For instance the \"Batenburg\" stone from Prinsengracht, Amsterdam, shown here puns on the words \"baten\" (to profit) and \"burg\" (castle), which together make up the name of a village near Nijmegen.\n\nA variation on the theme is a tablet bearing a biblical quotation or more worldly motto, but without an image. (Mediaeval builders also often carved mottos in wooden beams or painted them on plaster panels.) An interesting example is the Dutch-language tablet in Österlånggatan in the Hanseatic old town of Stockholm, Sweden. It reads:\n\n"}

The film is a fake documentary that begins as a semi-autobiographical retelling of Shore's early success and dwindling popularity in the late 1990s, after which it documents Shore's (fictional) attempt to fake his own death in order to drum up popularity for his films. It features many cameos.\n\nThe film begins as an autobiographical look at Shore's early professional successes on MTV and as the star of a series of '90s comedies. Shore's film career leads to his taking a starring role in a vehicle on the Fox Network, in which he plays the slacker son of a millionaire. The pilot of the series turns out to be a commercial and critical failure, and Shore becomes a pariah virtually overnight, with his friends distancing themselves from him for fear that it will tarnish their own careers. Shore is ultimately reduced to living in his mother's attic and watching \"BackDoor Sluts 9\" starring his ex-girlfriend, who will no longer see him. He spends his very last $84 on a hooker—who does almost nothing for him and his life simply gets worse and worse.\n\nOne night, Shore is visited by the ghost of his mentor, comic Sam Kinison, who encourages Shore to fake his own death as a means of revitalizing popularity in Pauly Shore films and merchandise. Shore decides to go through with the plan, which initially works: Once word of his \"death\" breaks, celebrities eager for the residual publicity begin appearing on television in large numbers to declare Shore a comic genius and lament his early death. Shore, eager to bask in the publicity, begins appearing in public wearing a disguise; he is quickly outed, arrested, and sent to prison.\n\nIn prison, Shore is attacked by one of his former fans, \"Bucky from Kentucky,\" a redneck whose world view was shattered when he learned that Shore had willingly put his own fans through the ordeal of thinking he was dead. Shore survives the attack, which causes him to realize that even though he was no longer as famous as he once was, he still had fans who loved him. Shore and Bucky have a heart-to-heart about the nature of celebrity, and Shore decides to start his career over.\n\nAfter getting out of prison, Shore sets about making \"Pauly Shore Is Dead\" to chronicle his own rise and fall, using information he has gathered from years in Hollywood to blackmail various B-list celebrities into appearing in cameos; he reserves the information he has on A-list celebrities for the planned sequel.\n\nAs Themselves\n\n\n\"Pauly Shore Is Dead\" received mixed reviews: Rotten Tomatoes gave it a still \"rotten\" 57% rating. Nonetheless they were by far the highest of Shore's film career, well above his universally negatively reviewed vehicles of the 1990s. It was a box office bomb, however, earning just $11,000 after a very limited release to theaters in Sacramento, California. It won the Audience Choice Award from the Slamdunk Film Festival (for Shore's direction).\n\nMusic from the band Staind's album \"Break the Cycle\" is used in the film. Aaron Lewis, vocalist of Staind, also makes an appearance in the film. Eminem and now deceased rapper Proof are in a deleted scene.

{"id": "2283073", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2283073", "title": "Exergaming", "text": "Exergaming\n\nFitness game, exergaming or exer-gaming (a portmanteau of \"exercise\" and \"gaming\"), or gamercising is a term used for video games that are also a form of exercise. Exergaming relies on technology that tracks body movement or reaction. The genre has been credited with upending the stereotype of gaming as a sedentary activity, and promoting an active lifestyle. Exergames are seen as evolving from technology changes aimed at making video games more fun.\n\nThe genre's roots can be found in games released in the late eighties, including the Power Pad (or Family Trainer) released for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1986, and the Foot Craz released for the Atari 2600 in 1987, although both had limited success. Konami's \"Dance Dance Revolution\" (1998) was cited as one of the first major successes of exergaming; when it was ported from the arcade to PlayStation, it sold over three million copies. In the 2000s, a number of devices and games have used the exergame style to much success: the EyeToy camera has sold over ten million units, while Nintendo's \"Wii Fit\" has sold in excess of 21 million copies. By June 2009, health games were generating revenues of $2 billion, largely due to \"Wii Fit's\" 18.22 million sales at the time. The term exergaming entered the \"Collins English Dictionary\" in 2007.\n\nThe genre has been mooted as a way to improve users' health through exercise, but few studies have been undertaken to measure the health benefits. Smaller trials have yielded mixed results and have shown that the respective traditional methods of exercise are superior to their video game equivalents.\n\nExergaming contains elements that were developed in the virtual reality community during the 1980s. The pioneer in this area was Autodesk, which developed two systems, the \"HighCycle\" and \"Virtual Racquetball\". The \"HighCycle\" was an exercise bike that a user would pedal through a virtual landscape. If the user pedaled fast enough, the virtual bike would take off and fly over the landscape. \"Virtual Racquetball\" tracked the position and orientation of an actual racquet that was used to hit a virtual ball in a virtual environment. This environment was shared with another user equipped with another tracked racquet, allowing the two users to play each other over phone lines. In both systems, the users could wear the \"VPL eyephones\", an early head-mounted display (HMD), that would provide more immersion for the user.\n\nThe first true attempt at what would later be called Exertainment was the Atari \"Puffer\" project (1982). This was an exercise bike that would hook up to an Atari 400/800 or 5200 system. Forward speed was controlled by pedaling while steering and additional gameplay was handled by a handlebar-mounted Gamepad. The machine was nearly ready for production with several games (\"Tumbleweeds\" and \"Jungle River Cruise\") when Atari declared bankruptcy and the Puffer project was abandoned. Nintendo also dabbled in this space with the Power Pad, released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1986.\n\nThe first exergaming system released to the market was the 1986 \"Computrainer\". Designed as a training aid and motivational tool, the \"Computrainer\" allowed users to ride through a virtual landscape generated on an NES, while monitoring data such as power output and pedaling cadence. The product had a price that was far too high to be considered as an entertainment product, but was affordable by dedicated athletes. The product continues to this day, where it now runs using Microsoft Windows compatible software with extensive graphic and physiological capabilities.\n\nAlso released for the NES in 1986 was the Family Trainer, which focused on entertainment rather than exercise.\n\nAbout the same time as the Computrainer, Concept II introduced a computer attachment for their rowing machine. This has become their \"eRow\" product and is used for both individual motivation as well as competition in \"indoor rowing leagues\".\n\nDuring the 1990s, there was a surge of interest in the application of \"virtual reality\" technologies to high-end gym equipment. Life Fitness and Nintendo partnered to produce the \"Exertainment\" System; Precor had an LCD-based bike product, and Universal had several CRT-based systems. The Netpulse system provided users with the ability to browse the web while exercising. Fitlinxx introduced a system that used sensors attached to weight machines in order to provide automated feedback to users.\n\nThree issues combined to ensure the failure of these systems in the marketplace. First, they were significantly more expensive than the equivalent models that did not have all the additional electronics. Second, they were harder to maintain, and were often left broken. Lastly the additional expertise required to operate the software was often intimidating to the users, who shied away from the machines out of fear that they would look foolish while trying to master the machine.\n\nUntil 1998, nothing significant happened in the field of videogame exercise. Hardware was still too expensive for the average home consumer, and the health clubs were gun-shy about adopting any new technology. As high-performance game console capabilities improved and prices fell, manufacturers once more started to explore the fitness market.\n\nIn 1998, Konami's Dance Dance Revolution was released along with Andamiro's Pump It Up (video game series) a couple months later.\n\nIn 2000, UK startup Exertris introduced an interactive gaming bike to the commercial fitness market.\n\nExergaming came to the mass media attention at the Consumer Electronics Show when Bill Gates showcased the Exertris Interactive Gaming Bike in 2003, and the following year the same show hosted a pavilion dedicated to video game technology that also worked as sports and exercise equipment.\nThe 2005 release of the brought the first multi-function exergame hardware into the home market. Making the players physical movements into the game's controller. 2006 saw the launch of Gamercize, combining traditional fitness equipment with game consoles. The minimalist approach allows game play to continue only when exercising, turning all game titles into potential exergames.\n\nNintendo's Wii in 2006 brought acceleration detection with the Wii Remote. In late 2007, Nintendo released the exergame Wii Fit, which utilized a new peripheral, the Wii Balance Board. The popularity of the Wii lead to it being used in hospital \"Wiihab\" rehabilitation programs.\n\nThe PCGamerBike appeared at CES in 2007 where it received an Honoree Award. It differs from other exergaming devices in that its pedal motion can be mapped to any key on the keyboard. It also has an optical encoder which detects forward and reverse pedal motion. The Fisher-Price Smart Cycle was another entry in the field.\n\nOther examples of exergaming products include: Positive Gaming iDANCE, iSTEP, Cobalt Flux Blufit, Cyber coach, NeoRacer, Gymkids exercise equipment with interactive technology, some Wii titles such as EA Sports Active, Cybex TRAZER, Powergrid Fitness Kilowatt, Lightspace Play Floor, PlayMotion, Yourself!Fitness, Expresso Fitness S2, i.play, Cyber ExerCycle, VEQTOR Sport Trainer and Sportwall.\n\nThe Kinect (2010) represented a significant advance in how player motion was detected in games, because the player's body became the remote. The exergaming trend within consoles that started with the seventh generation Wii peaked with the Nike+ Kinect Training (2012) & pedometer-pairing Wii Fit U (2013) games. These were followed up in the eighth generation by an exergaming push by Microsoft with the Xbox One launch day Xbox Fitness service (2013), which tracked metrics such as heart rate and correct form while synchronising these metrics with the Microsoft Health. By 2017, Microsoft had pivoted away from Kinect and exergaming on consoles. In 2019, Nintendo released Fitness Boxing, and Ring Fit Adventure for the Nintendo Switch.\n\nMobile phone apps such as \"Zombies, Run!\" (2012), \"Run An Empire\", \"Ingress\" (2013), and \"Pokémon Go\" (2016) have been described as augmented reality exergames.\n\nVR, or Virtual Reality, is now starting to become a major player in the world of Exergaming. Games like Beat Saber, Holodance, OhShape, and others allow players to get good exercise while playing a video game.\n\nLaboratory studies have demonstrated that some exergames can provide light to moderate intensity physical activity.\n\nA 2018 systematic review in the Journal of Medical Internet Research of 10 randomized trials studying the \"Social Effects of Exergames on Older Adults\" found that \"the majority of exergame studies demonstrated promising results for enhanced social well-being, such as reduction of loneliness, increased social connection, and positive attitudes towards others\".\n\nAnother 2018 systematic review of 10 randomised controlled trials of exergaming in overweight children found that they can produce a small reduction in body mass index.\n\nAs of 2016, exergaming for those with neurological disabilities had been studied in around 140 small clinical trials in people of all ages, to see if exergaming can help this group get enough physical exercise to maintain their health. This mode of getting exercise appears attractive in this population from a public health perspective because of its low cost and accessibility. Exergames have the potential to provide moderate intensity exercises in this population, but the evidence was too weak on long-term follow-up to draw strong conclusions.\n\nThere is significant evidence across multiple random controlled trials relating exergaming to improved cognitive functioning in healthy older adults (with a mean age of 69), and attenuated deterioration or improvement in adults with cognitive impairment from neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.\n\nIn addition, studies investigated if exergaming can lead to improvements in cognitive performance in clinical and non-clinical populations such as those who have ADHD and depression. There are first encouraging results, but the empirical evidence still is limited.\n\nWhen making an exergaming system, the manufacturer of a consumer product must make the decision as to whether the system will be usable with off-the-shelf games or if custom software must be written for it. Because it takes longer for a user to move their entire body in response to stimulation from the game, it is often the case that dedicated software must be written for the game to playable. An example of this is Konami's \"Dance Dance Revolution\". Though designed to be played by users moving about on a specially designed dancepad, that game can alternatively be played by pushing buttons with one's fingers using a standard hand-held gamepad. When played with the dancepad at higher levels the game can be quite challenging (and physically exhausting), but if the game is played using the buttons on the hand controller, none of the sequences are physically limited.\n\nNewer systems such as Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Wii use alternative input devices such as the Kinect and PlayStation Move. The Move uses image analysis to extract the motion of the user against a background and uses these motions to control the character in the game. A specifically designed exercise game \"Kinetic\", superimposes animated objects to be punched, kicked, or otherwise interacted with over a video image of the user. The Wii and PlayStation 3 both incorporate motion sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes into the hand-held controllers that are used to direct behaviors within the game.\nResearch projects such as exertion interfaces that investigate the design aspects of these games explore how the technological augmentation that comes with the digital gameplay component can be nurtured for additional benefits, such as utilizing the social power of exercising together even though players are connected only over a network or scaling the number of players, enabling novel exercise experiences not available without the technological augmentation.\n\nExergame resellers have developed fitness centers and specialist room designs with programmes that focus entirely on creating environments for young people using exergaming for fitness. Group fitness programmer Les Mills International has recently launched \"Immersive Fitness\" studios around the globe which combine exergaming with live group fitness classes.\n\nOne of the newest trends is using virtual reality immersion. VR systems have several potential advantages for athletic training; environments can be precisely controlled and scenarios standardized, augmented information can be incorporated to guide performance, and the environment can be dynamically altered to create different competitive situations. High frame rate display technologies for example Head-mounted display can be used to transform the user into any sporting situation e.g. a track cycling veledrome. Natural movements can also be incorporated into the games, for example utilizing an omnidirectional treadmill, such as the Infinadeck. Such a system allows the user to virtually be in the game while allowing 360 degrees of movement. While the technology is new, it is showing promising results in weight management as well as in high participation rates.\n\n"}

Opening the batting in 1984–85 he scored 442 runs at 44.20, including his first century, 130 against Auckland, and he was asked to open the batting for New Zealand in the West Indies at a time when West Indies were at the height of their powers. \n\nRutherford's highest first-class score of 317, scored playing for a New Zealand touring side against a D.B.Close XI at Scarborough in 1986, achieved several records for New Zealand cricket. it contained eight sixes and 45 boundary fours, crossing the boundary rope a record 53 times. The runs were scored in a day – the most runs scored in one day by a New Zealand batsman, and 199 of the runs were scored in one session between lunch and tea. The match was something of a festival occasion, with some elderly players in the fielding ranks, and Rutherford had not played with great distinction in the test matches. It is the highest innings in the history of the Scarborough Festival, .\n\nUpon being dropped from the New Zealand team in 1995, Rutherford moved to South Africa, where he played first-class cricket for five seasons, first for Transvaal and then for Gauteng (which replaced Transvaal in 1994), before finally retiring, scoring a duck in his very last game. \n\nMaking his debut during New Zealand's tour of the West Indies in 1984-85 at the age of 19, Rutherford played in all four Test matches. Facing the West Indian pace attack, he endured a difficult time, scoring 0, 0 (run out without facing a ball), 4 (an edge through the slips), 0, 2, 1 and 5 in the series.\n\nHe was not selected for the tour of Australia in 1985–86, but after scoring 638 runs at 53.16 with three centuries in the Shell Trophy he returned to the Test team when Australia toured New Zealand early in 1986, this time in the middle order, scoring two fifties in the three Tests.\n\nRutherford was a steady feature of the side after his return. However he had a habit of not converting fifties into centuries in Test cricket though he clearly had the ability to do so, as shown by his 35 first-class centuries. He captained New Zealand's team for three years, with two Test wins in 18 attempts in what was a difficult tenure as New Zealand struggled to find a replacement for the retired Richard Hadlee and suffered the decline in power of their only world class batsman, Martin Crowe.\n\nArguably, Rutherford's greatest success came in One Day Internationals where he won ten matches as captain and made his highest international score, with 108 in a losing cause against India. He was a member of the New Zealand side which reached the semi finals of the 1992 World Cup, their 2nd equal best performance in the tournament's history.\n\nIn the 1997 New Year Honours, Rutherford was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to cricket.\n\nRutherford published his autobiography, \"A Hell of a Way to Make a Living\", in 1995. With Mike Crean he wrote a book for young cricketers, \"Ken Rutherford’s Book of Cricket\", in 1992.\n\nAfter retirement from the playing side of the game, he coached the Irish national cricket team.\n\nAfter coaching the Ireland national team for two years he followed his interest in horse racing, returning home to work as head bookmaker for the New Zealand TAB and then filled a similar role in Singapore. Back in South Africa he then worked as chief executive of racing broadcaster Tellytrack. Since 2013 (and ) he is general manager of the Waikato Racing Club. He is also a cricket commentator for Sky Network Television.\n"}

Part of the Local Group of galaxies, it was discovered by E. E. Barnard in 1884 (hence its name), with a six-inch refractor telescope. It is one of the closer galaxies to the Milky Way. It is similar in structure and composition to the Small Magellanic Cloud. It is about 7,000 light-years in diameter.\n\nEdwin Hubble, in the paper \"N.G.C. 6822, A Remote Stellar System\", identified 15 variable stars (11 of which were Cepheids) of this galaxy. He also surveyed the galaxy's stars distribution down to magnitude 19.4. He provided spectral characteristics, luminosities and dimensions for the five brightest \"diffuse nebulae\" (giant H II regions) that included the Bubble Nebula and the Ring Nebula. He also computed the absolute magnitude of the entire galaxy.\n\nHubble's detection of eleven Cepheid variable stars was a milestone in astronomy. Utilizing the Cepheid Period-Luminosity relationship, Hubble determined a distance of 214 kiloparsecs or 698,000 light-years. This was the first system beyond the Magellanic Clouds to have its distance determined. (Hubble continued this process with the Andromeda Galaxy and the Triangulum Galaxy). His distance to the galaxy was way beyond Harlow Shapley's value of 300,000 light-years for the size of universe. In the paper, Hubble concluded the \"Great Debate\" of 1920 between Heber Curtis and Shapley over the scale of the universe and the nature of the \"spiral nebula\". It soon became evident that all spiral nebulae were in fact spiral galaxies far outside our own Milky Way.\n\nAn analysis of Hubble's plates by Susan Kayser in 1966 remained the most complete study of this galaxy until 2002.\n\nIn 1977, Paul W. Hodge extended the list of known H II regions in Barnard to 16. Today, there are over 150 of these regions catalogued in Barnard's Galaxy.\n\n\n"}

He was one of the 438 individuals who were arrested and executed in 1979 following the Iranian Revolution.\n\nNematollah Nassiri was born in 1911 in Sangussar, near Semnan. He received secondary education in Tehran. In 1929 he was enrolled in an army officer school. Nassiri was a classmate of the crown prince, which in turn played an important role in his career.\n\nNassiri began his career in the rank of lieutenant of the 2nd class (rank), quickly moving forward in the ranks of the service in the ground forces.\n\nIn 1949, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel Nassiri became governor of the province of Kerman.\n\nNassiri served as the commander of the Iranian Imperial Guards during the Pahlavi dynasty. He was arrested by the followers of Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh when he delivered two decrees of the Shah to the prime minister. A personal friend of the Shah, Nassiri participated in the 1953 Iranian coup d'état which removed Iranian prime minister Mosaddegh from power in 1953. He was appointed head of SAVAK following the failure of General Hassan Pakravan, the previous director, to prevent the assassination of Prime Minister Hassan-Ali Mansur on 21 January 1965. Nassiri was also made deputy prime minister. He served in the post until 6 June 1978 when he was dismissed by the Shah. Then Nassiri was appointed ambassador of Iran to Pakistan.\n\nThe proximity to the Shah and his entourage allowed Nassiri to quickly become one of the richest people in Iran. By the early 1970s Nassiri was already the richest landowner on the entire coast of the Caspian Sea.\n\nAt the end of January 1965, the Shah appointed him to the post of director of SAVAK, after General Hassan Pakravan was removed from this post - due to the fact that under his leadership, SAVAK was unable to prevent the assassination of Prime Minister Hassan Ali Mansur.\n\nIn his book \"SAVAK – the secret police of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi (1957–1979)\", researcher of the activities of the Shah secret police Vasily Papava so describes the appointment of Nassiri to the post of head of the secret service: “\"There are several explanations for this appointment. Closest to the truth, probably the following. The Shah was concerned about the growing authority of the left-wing forces in the country, represented by the extremist and terrorist organizations “Mujahedin-e Khalq” and “Fadaiyan-e-Khalq”. Pahlavi, also not without reason, was afraid of the growing authority of the military, especially the generals and senior officers, who became “heroes” after the August revolution of 1953. It should be taken into account that in the period of 1950-1960s, in many countries of the region, as a result of a coup d'état, the military came to power who overthrew the \"pro-Western\" secular regimes and established a military dictatorship. That is why the shah needed a new leader of the political police who had left the military environment and was well aware of what measures should be taken to protect the throne from usurping power from the army\"”.\n\nMohammed Reza Pahlavi gave General Nassiri tough instructions - to restore the effectiveness of the SAVAK secret police and to properly serve the monarch.\n\nGeneral Nematollah Nassiri ideally coped with the task set before him by the shah: in the shortest possible time, a rather complex and comprehensive system of total investigation and denunciation was created, which controlled all aspects of the political and public life of Iran.\n\nThe main focus of the activities of the Shah special services was aimed at combating the \"red danger\". At the same time, in 1968, Nematollah Nassiri showed interest in establishing contacts with the USSR through the channels of special services, in particular in the acquisition of “counter-intelligence equipment” in the Soviet Union.\n\nOne of Nassiri’s main achievements as head of SAVAK was the elimination of the Shah’s opponent, General Teymur Bakhtiar, the first director of SAVAK. The development of a special operation plan to eliminate Bakhtiar and its brilliant execution by the SAVAK agents was personally supervised by General Nassiri, directly agreeing with the Shah regarding all the details of this operation. On August 12, 1970, Teymur Bakhtiar was liquidated in Iraq by sent SAVAK agents.\n\nOn June 6, 1978, General Nematollah Nassiri was relieved of his post as head of the SAVAK and appointed ambassador to Pakistan. His place was taken by Lieutenant General Nasser Mogadam, who for many years headed the “Department III” SAVAK.\n\nWith the constant development of the Iranian Revolution, the Shah ordered the Dissolution of SAVAK and Nassiri was called back from Pakistan and was arrested together with 60 other former officials on 7 or 8 of November 1978 including high-ranking officials, such as former director of SAVAK Hassan Pakravan and former Prime Minister Amir-Abbas Hoveyda. When the Shah left Iran on 16 January 1979, Nassiri remained in prison until the fall of Shapour Bakhtiar's government on 11 February.\n\nOn 15 February, Nassiri was arrested by revolutionists and brought in the Refah School with other officials. He was tried in a Revolutionary Tribunal along 24 other individuals for a total of 10 hours and was charged -without any defence or concrete evidence of guilt- with corruption on earth, massacre of people, torture, and treason. He was sentenced to death and confiscation of property at 10 p.m. and after the sentence was confirmed by Ayatollah Khomeini, he was executed by firing squad at 11:45 p.m. on February 15th. \n\n"}

He played for the provinces of Canterbury and Otago and is the most successful Canterbury cricket captain of the modern era. He was made captain of New Zealand on his Test debut and he holds the unofficial record for the most runs (70), from a single over in first-class cricket.\n\nGermon made his first class debut as a 19-year-old for Canterbury against Auckland at Lancaster Park on 5 January 1988. Germon became captain of an underperforming Canterbury side after Rod Latham on 31 December 1990.\n\nUnder Germon's leadership Canterbury went on to unprecedented success in the New Zealand one day game winning the Shell Cup 50 over competition in 1991/92, 1992/93 & 1993/94, two further wins were to follow in 1995/96 & 1996/97. Canterbury also won the New Zealand first class competition the Shell Trophy under his captaincy in 1993/4, 1996/97 and 1997/98. Canterbury also won the one off New Zealand Action cricket trophy in 1992 (Action cricket was a forerunner to Twenty20 and Cricket Max).\n\nGermon holds the records for dismissals for Canterbury with 238 in 76 first class matches. He also scored 2336 runs at an average of 30.74.\n\nGermon's final match for Canterbury was in the 1997/98 Shell Cup final which Canterbury won against Northern Districts. In this match Germon broke the New Zealand first-class record for a tenth wicket partnership when he added 160 with Warren Wisneski, making 80 runs in his final innings. Germon retired from cricket after the match, aged 29.\n\nIn the early 1990s Germon was continually overlooked for the New Zealand side despite his wicket keeping and captaincy abilities \nAfter season 1993/94, in which Germon led Canterbury to victory in both one day and four day competitions and scored a 100 not out playing for a New Zealand XI against the visiting Pakistan side in January 1994, Germon entered the New Zealand side. \n\n\n\nWhile he missed out on the 1994 winter tour to England, Germon was included in the 1994/95 tour to South Africa when he was taken as cover for wicketkeeper/batsman Adam Parore. On this tour Germon made his ODI debut for New Zealand on 8 December against Sri Lanka in a rain affected match at Goodyear Park, Bloemfontein; he kept wicket while Parore played as a specialist batsman. Germon however played very little cricket on the tour.\n\n1994/95 was New Zealand's cricket's centenary season, and it proved a disaster for the New Zealand cricket team. At its conclusion New Zealand broadcater Murray Deaker commented that the only good thing you could say about it from the New Zealand cricket point of view was that it only came once every hundred years.\n\nMarred by substandard performances, disciplinary problems and a cannabis smoking scandal, the season proved a watershed in New Zealand cricket and Glenn Turner was introduced as new coach in 1995, as New Zealand cricket sought about changing the culture within the New Zealand cricket team.\n\nTurner, upon deciding that Ken Rutherford would be replaced as captain, appointed Germon New Zealand wicketkeeper and captain, recognising that Germon had the best captaincy record in New Zealand domestic cricket at the time. Prior to making Germon captain, Turner assessed Germon's wicket keeping abilities consulting with former New Zealand wicketkeepers Barry Milburn and Ian Smith, who both considered Germon to be the best the wicketkeeper in New Zealand at that time. Former New Zealand captain and then senior squad member Martin Crowe also stated to Turner that he thought Germon as better at wicket-keeping than incumbent wicketkeeper Adam Parore.\n\nGermon was to play 12 Test matches and 37 ODIs for New Zealand. Germon's captaincy career was to last less than 2 years. His first test was against India in October 1995 a match which New Zealand lost by 8 wickets. Germon distinguished himself in the match, top scoring for New Zealand in both innings making 48 and 41 runs respectively. \n\nWhile the team did not have significant success under his leadership a steady improvement was made on the performances of the 1994 -95 season. Germon's only test victory as captain came in November 1996 when he captained New Zealand to its first test victory over Pakistan, in Pakistan for 26 years.\n\nESPN cricinfo rates Germon's one day cricket captaincy success rate at 44.44%; this is below his successor Stephen Fleming's 48.04% success rate but represented an improvement on Ken Rutherford's 30% success rate. While New Zealand won only one ODI series, against Zimbabwe during Germon's time in charge, they did win 15 games and drew two.\n\nGermon's first one-day series in charge was against India in India and it resulted in a closely contested series win to India, three games to two. \n\nHe captained New Zealand to its first ever one day victories in the West Indies in 1996 in a closely fought one day series which NZ lost three games to two. There were also series draws against Pakistan in New Zealand 1995/1996 (two all) and England in New Zealand in 1997 (two all).\n\nHe led New Zealand to the final of the 1996 Sharjah Cup competition, defeating competition from new world champions Sri Lanka. New Zealand lost in the final to Pakistan.\n\nHe led New Zealand to the quarter final of the 1996 world cup where despite scoring their highest ever total against Australia (to that point) with 286, they lost. Germon scored his highest ODI score of 89 in that match and finished the 1996 World Cup with a batting average of 63.66, the highest of any New Zealander and any wicketkeeper in the tournament.\n\nAlong with coach Glenn Turner, Germon had wanted to make significant changes to the culture of the New Zealand team, he was faced with opposition from some high-profile players. There was much dissension in the New Zealand team in the tour of the West Indies in 1996, it has been suggested by New Zealand journalists that Chris Cairns and Adam Parore faked injuries to leave the tour early, after the tour Glenn Turner was deposed by New Zealand cricket, it is widely believed that this conflict with high-profile players along with his loss of form led to Germon's sudden dismissal from the New Zealand side in 1997.\n\nWhile Germon's form had slumped, (in Turner's era he had averaged 25 in ODI's with the bat, and 26.80 in tests), in his last ODI against England he made 4 dismissals, former New Zealand wicket keeper Ian Smith saying that he had \"kept like a dream\" in his last match. His dismissal from the New Zealand team was highly controversial. It caused protest, especially in Canterbury. New Zealand convenor of selectors of the time Ross Dykes admitted to receiving hate mail and anonymous phone calls over the issue.\n\nGermon is one of the few wicketkeepers who have played over ten tests and affected more dismissal than conceded byes. He affected 29 dismissals in test cricket and conceded 24 byes.\n\nLee Germon was replaced as New Zealand captain by his Canterbury team mate Stephen Fleming, a player he had tipped as a player for the future in the 1993 \"Who’s who of New Zealand cricket.\"\n\nAfter retiring from cricket in 1998 Germon was persuaded to play cricket again by his former Canterbury coach Denis Aberhart and former New Zealand coach Glenn Turner to play for Otago. Germon was to play for an underperforming Otago team as a batsman between 2000–2002.\nHe chose to play for Otago citing the fresh challenge it offered him. Germon played as a batsman only and did not match his previous achievements as a player.\n\nIn 1998 Germon became the South Island development manager for the Bank of New Zealand before moving on to work at St Andrew's College as its development officer in 2000. In 2004 Germon shifted to Mainland Soccer as CEO for what turned out to be only a 10-month stint before he moved to Nelson to become CEO of the Tasman Rugby Union. In 2009 he returned to his home city of Christchurch to become CEO of Canterbury Cricket. \n"}
{"id": "2283118", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2283118", "title": "Brunonian system of medicine", "text": "Brunonian system of medicine\n\nThe Brunonian system of medicine is a theory of medicine which regards and treats disorders as caused by defective or excessive excitation. It was developed by the Scottish physician John Brown and is outlined in his 1780 publication \"Elementa Medicinae\". It drew on the theories of his teacher William Cullen, but whereas Cullen set out to create a systematic nosology of diseases, Brown argued for a unified model in which all disease was related to stimulation.\n\nAlthough Brown's theory never became very popular in Britain, it had temporary success in America, Italy, and the German-speaking part of Europe.\n\nJohn Brown was born in 1735 and died in 1788, not very long after having written his master work, \"Elementa Medicinae\" (Elements of Medicine) in 1780. He was apparently studied to be a clergyman, but then studied medicine at Edinburgh University, and received his degree at St Andrew's. He commenced his medical practice in Edinburgh, but opposition to his new ideas, as set out in his \"Elementa Medicinae\" resulted in his move to London in 1786.\n\nBrown worked with and studied under one of the foremost medical practitioners and theoreticians of the time, William Cullen. Cullen and Brown, however, had a falling out. Brown was likely influenced by Cullen's ideas on the capacity for nerves and muscles to be excited or stimulated (similar to the work of Haller in Germany on 'irritability'), but Brown looked at the issue of excitation in a broader and more dynamic manner. One scholarly article relates the influence of Galvanism and Mesmerism on Brown's work. Brown himself relates in the Introduction to his magnum opus, \"Elementa Medicinae\", that his ideas came from an attack of gout, but in a period when his dietary intake was less rather than more. Since the cause of gout was then held to be a problem of excess, he was put on a strict vegetable diet with no wine or alcohol for a year, but instead of the promised cure, he had four \"exceedingly violent\" episodes. This led him to consider the effects of different foods and drinks and try a different approach, that of an invigorating or stimulating diet which proved successful. According to the \"Encyclopædia Perthensis\", \"Thus, from personal experience of the inefficacy of the former medical practice in the gout, he was led to review the whole old system of medicine.\"\n\nBrown's \"Elementa Medicinae\" was published in 1780 and followed several years later by Brown's own version in English. Brown did not live to see his work achieve any great acceptance, but in 1795, Dr. Thomas Beddoes, one of the leading physicians of his day, undertook a translation (claiming Brown's was deficient), accompanied by an extensive introduction to explain Brown's system. Beddoes was also a close friend of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and did much to introduce him to Brown's ideas as well as to the various German writings on the Brunonian system, which appeared suddenly after 1795 as well, mainly through the writings of Dr. Andreas Röschlaub. One source states that Beddoes' influence was \"the most likely source\" of Coleridge's plan to go to Germany, and that Coleridge's philosophical interests there were often \"anchored in medical debates.\" (Coleridge, Thomas Beddoes and Brunonian Medicine), Coleridge several times refers to Brown as a genius.\nColeridge then discusses the Brunonian system in lengthy notebook entries from his time in Göttingen.\n\nWhile Brown's Elementa Medicinae had been known in Germany, it was not made available until 1794, when Adam Melchor Weikard, former physician to Catherine the Great of Russia, arranged for its publication in Latin after having had it brought to his attention by Andreas Röschlaub, a medical student (who was himself given a copy in 1793 by a friend). In 1795, Weikard prepared and published a German translation. In 1796, a second German translation, by Christoff Pfaff, appeared and a second edition in 1798 came with a critical review. Röschlaub had also made a translation, but did not publish (in three volumes) until Weikard's second edition went out of print in 1806 which became the standard and last German edition (the year of Hahnemann's pivotal essay on the 'elements' of his new system, \"On A New Principle for Ascertaining the Curative Power of Drugs\"). \nThe introduction of Brown's ideas occurred within a background both of profound natural philosophic turmoil as well as a crisis within German (and generally European) medicine (see Romantic medicine). \nAt the turn of the nineteenth century Brown's work suddenly gained rapid popularity in Germany and Austria, essentially through the efforts of Andreas Röschlaub, and Adalbert Marcus, who ran the hospital in Bamberg in northern Bavaria and worked with Röschlaub to implement Brown's approach clinically. Röschlaub developed an \"Erregbarkeitstheorie\" (excitability theory) essentially on Brunonian principles. Röschlaub showed that Brunonian 'excitability' was different in kind to Haller's more mechanical theory of 'Reiz' (irritability'), which was quite well-known. The difference was that Brown posited an internal excitability which is actualised by the reception of stimuli; the response to stimuli was, therefore, the combined product of the exciting stimuli and the internal excitability. Stimulation does not only come from the outside, but also triggers from within the powers of internal excitability.\nThe emergence of Fichte's philosophy in 1794 provided another context for the reception of Brown's ideas. 'Fichte's \"Wissenschaftlehre\" is the theory of excitability', wrote Novalis, excitedly (Werke 3: 383). Fichte's account of the relationship between the 'I' and the 'not-I' found its biological correlate in the relationship between the organism and its environment. \nHowever, Schelling had initially misunderstood Brown's system as mechanical, but it was Röschlaub who helped him to see its dynamic aspects and applicability within a science of nature (Naturphilosophie). \nSchelling wrote in his \"First Outline of a System of a Philosophy of Nature\" (\"Naturphilosophie\") in 1799 that Brown was \"the first to understand the only true and genuine principles of all theories of organic nature, insofar as he pointed the ground of life in excitability…He was the first who understood that life consists neither in an absolute passivity nor in an absolute capacity, that life is a product of a potency higher than the merely chemical, but without being supernatural.\" (Schelling 1799:68)\n\nAs the main historian of this period in medicine and particularly of Röschlaub's role, wrote: \"This new combination of Brown and Röschlaub's excitability theory with Schelling's Naturphilosophie met an enthusiastic receptionand was very influential not only at the German universities but also on practical medicine.\"\n\nAnother important element was the crisis in German medicine, which came to a head in an article in a public journal by a Doctor Erhard which effectively stripped all pretense of efficacy or rationality from the prevailing 'system' of medicine.\n\nIt was the combination of a receptive natural philosophy and science in Germany towards the end of the 1700s and the deep crisis in German medicine that provided fertile ground for the reception and dissemination of Brown's excitation theory. Röschlaub's main work on the Brunonian system, the \"Untersuchungen\", setting out his and Marcus' experience, came out in 1798 and went out of print quickly, leading to a second edition in 1800. This led to the transformation suddenly of Bamberg \"into an excellent and famous intellectual and medical centre to which students came from as far as America.\" Röschlaub wrote extensively on Brown's system, in particular a journal, known popularly as \"Röschlaub's Magazine\" (\"Magazin der Vervolkommung der theoretishcen und praktischen Heilkunde\", Frankfurt, 10 vols. 1799-1809) \"the main forum of Brunonian medicine.\"\n\nBrown's ideas, as presented and developed by Röschlaub (and Markus) met with strong resistance in some quarters. As William Osler, the renowned Canadian-born physician wrote at the turn of the 20th century: \nOne of the most prominent physicians at the time, Christoph W. Hufeland (1762-1836) was initially also opposed as it seemed to convert the basis of traditional medicine, which he favoured, but later worked to show how Brunonianism and the excitability theory were compatible and even allowed proponents of Brunonianism to publish after 1816 in his influential Journal, himself contributing articles in 1819, 1822, and 1829, now comparing Brown with Galen.\n\nThere was a renewal at this time of interest in the Brunonian system due to the popularity of the French physician Broussais, whose theory was ostensibly based on Brown's system, but rather emphasized the negative side (lowering of energy through blood-letting). However, this renewal was cut short by the assassination on 23 March 1819 of August von Kotzebue, a major literary and conservative political figure, by a radical student. The result was the shutting down by Metternich of all liberal journals, schools and student unions- \"for medicine, this meant a general return to traditionalism and eclecticism.\"\n\nThe 1840s saw a reaction to this repression and an attack on \"intellectual barren medical eclecticism\" with a call for a return to the ideas of Romantic medicine. Carl Wunderlich, the founder of thermometry in Germany, saw Brown and Röschlaub as the genesis of the new \"physiological medicine\" school of which he was a proponent. In 1846, a German doctor and historian, Bernard Hirschel, published a very favourable study of Brunonianism and listed all the relevant literature, \"which remains the best compilation on this subject\" Historiography misrepresented, then denounced, and finally totally ignored Röschlaub.\n\nCurrent science-based Western medical practice does not accept nineteenth century notions of \"excitability\".\n\nAlthough the direct influence of the Brunonian system seemed to end about the mid-1800s its influence, in the form of \"the idea of an active, self-reproducing and self-defending power mediating the organism's general reaction has, since then, never ceased to resonate in German medical thinking. This can be seen in Rudolf Virchow, especially when he was trying to formulate the general principles of cellular pathology.\" Though Virchow tried to downplay it, his approach and ideas owed much to Röschlaub's work with Brown's ideas.\n\nOne of Brown's key ideas was that of the unity of pathology and physiology, the former being an unhealthy departure from the natural rhythms and functions of the latter. This was a major idea taken over by Virchow, but he claimed it as new (the degree to which Virchow borrowed from the Brunonian system through the works of Röschlaub is documented in the major work by Nelly Tsouyoupoulos which is available only in German).\n\n\n"}

After attending gymnasia at Hanover and Kiel, he entered the military academy at Plön in Schleswig-Holstein, but transferred to the German Imperial Navy at Easter 1891. He served first on the training ship , then on the training ship on a voyage to the Americas. He became signal lieutenant of the old ironclad in October 1894, and later transferred in the same capacity to her sister ship .\n\nMüller was promoted to \"Oberleutnant zur See\" and posted to the unprotected cruiser . During \"Schwalbe\"s deployment to German East Africa, he caught malaria, which troubled him for the remainder of his life.\n\nAfter returning to Germany in 1900, Müller served on shore before becoming second gunnery officer of the pre-dreadnought battleship . An appointment to the staff of Admiral Prince Heinrich of Prussia proved to be the turning point to career success. After receiving high praise and assessments from his superiors, he was promoted to the rank of \"Korvettenkapitän\" in December 1908, and assigned to the \"Reichsmarineamt\" (Imperial Navy Office) in Berlin, where he impressed Grand Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz.\n\nAs a reward for his admiralty work in Berlin, Müller was given command of the light cruiser in the spring of 1913. Soon he achieved fame and notoriety in both the German and other imperial powers' newspapers for initiative and skill in shelling rebellious forts along the Yangtze, at Nanking. He was awarded the Order of the Royal Crown (Third Class) with Swords.\n\nAt the outbreak of the First World War, \"Emden\" was anchored in the German base at Tsingtao. She steamed out to sea on the evening of July 31, 1914, and on August 4 she intercepted and captured the Russian mail steamer \"Ryazan\", the first prize taken by the Imperial German Navy (\"Kaiserliche Marine\") in the Great War. \"Emden\" then made rendezvous with the German East Asia Squadron of Admiral Count Maximilian von Spee in the Mariana Islands.\n\nIt was during a conference on the island of Pagan that Müller proposed a single light cruiser of the squadron be detached to raid Allied commerce in the Indian Ocean, while the remainder of Spee's squadron continued to steam east across the Pacific. Müller and \"Emden\" were given the assignment.\n\nIn the following twelve weeks \"Emden\" and Müller achieved a reputation for daring and chivalry unequaled by any other German ship or captain. Müller was highly scrupulous about trying to avoid inflicting non-combatant and civilian casualties. While taking fourteen prizes, the only merchant sailors killed by \"Emden\"s guns were five victims of a bombardment of Madras that targeted British oil tanks and a merchant ship, despite the care Müller had taken to establish lines of fire that would minimise the risk of hitting civilian areas of the city. \"Emden\" also sank the Russian cruiser \"Zhemchug\" and the French destroyer \"Mousquet\" during a raid on Penang in Malaya. Thirty-six French survivors from \"Mousquet\" were rescued by \"Emden\", and when three men died of their injuries they were buried at sea with full honours. The remaining Frenchmen were transferred to a British steamer, \"Newburn\", which had been stopped by the German ship, but not attacked, so as to enable them to be transported to Sabang, Sumatra, in the neutral Dutch East Indies.\n\nWhen \"Emden\" sent a landing party ashore to destroy a radio station at Port Refuge in the Keeling Islands on November 8, 1914, she was finally cornered by the Australian light cruiser HMAS \"Sydney\" and was defeated in the Battle of Cocos by the Australian ship's heavier guns. Müller, with the rest of his surviving crew, was captured and taken to Fort Verdala, Malta. A detachment of his crew which had gone ashore evaded capture and escaped to Germany under the leadership of \"Emden\"s first officer, Hellmuth von Mücke. On October 8, 1916, two days after the German resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare, Müller was separated from the rest of the \"Emden\" prisoners and taken to England, where he was interned at a prisoner of war camp for German officers located at the Midlands Agricultural and Dairy College (now the Sutton Bonington Campus of the University of Nottingham). In 1917 he led an escape of 21 prisoners through a tunnel, but was recaptured. The climate of England disagreed with his malaria, and he was eventually sent to the Netherlands for treatment, as part of a humanitarian exchange of prisoners. In October 1918, a month before the armistice, he was repatriated to Germany.\n\nMüller was awarded the Pour le Mérite (or \"Blue Max\") and finally promoted to \"Kapitän zur See\". In early 1919, he retired from the Navy on grounds of ill health and settled in Blankenburg. He politely refused to write a book detailing his war service and exploits. He was elected to the state parliament of the Free State of Brunswick on an anti-class platform as a member of the German National People's Party. He died at Brunswick suddenly, probably weakened by frequent malarial bouts, on March 11, 1923.\n\n"}

Archaeologists have expressed concerns that tourism encourages particular ways of seeing and knowing the past. When archaeological sites are run by tourist boards, ticket fees and souvenir revenues can become a priority, and the question remains whether a site is worth opening to the public or remaining closed and keeping the site out of harm's way. Damage to irreplaceable archaeological materials is not only direct, as when remains are disordered, altered, destroyed, or looted, but often the indirect result of poorly planned development of tourism amenities, such as hotels, restaurants, roads, and shops. These can drastically alter the environment in ways that produce flooding, landslides, or undermine ancient structures.\n\n"}

{"id": "2283142", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2283142", "title": "Clipper Magazine Stadium", "text": "Clipper Magazine Stadium\n\nClipper Magazine Stadium is a 6,000-seat baseball park in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Its first regular season baseball game occurred on May 11, 2005, in which the Lancaster Barnstormers lost to the Atlantic City Surf, 4-3. The ballpark also hosts the \"Lancaster New Era\" Tournament for midget baseball and the Lancaster-Lebanon League high school baseball championship, and was the site of the 2008 Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference baseball championship. In October 2008, the venue hosted vice-presidential nominee, Sarah Palin, for the\nRoad to Victory rally during the 2008 United States presidential election. Clipper Magazine Stadium was honored as the \"Ballpark of the Year\" by the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball following the end of its 2013 regular season. The award commemorated Barnstormers' staff for their excellence in groundskeeping and stadium operations.\n\nClipper Magazine Stadium also serves as the corporate headquarters for the Atlantic League. The ballpark is named for Clipper Magazine, a local periodical company, which purchased the naming rights for $2.5 million over ten years. This agreement was extended in 2013 through the 2019 season.\n\n44 years before the opening of Clipper Magazine Stadium and the Lancaster Barnstormers' inaugural season, the Lancaster Red Roses entertained baseball enthusiasts for 20 years at Stumpf Field. Efforts for a new stadium and a new team began in 1987, and what was a long sixteen-year battle finally paid off with an announcement in 2003. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania agreed to fund roughly half of the cost with Opening Day Partners and the city of Lancaster covering the remainder. The original plan in 2001 called for a proposed, $20-million ballpark to be constructed on the Diseley Farm site, across from Long's Park in Manheim Township. However, those plans were cancelled because of residential concerns about traffic and political concerns about the use of eminent domain and rezoning. After this plan was terminated, most Lancaster County politicians preferred a downtown ballpark in order to revitalize a run-down neighborhood. The Redevelopment Authority of the County of Lancaster settled on an industrial site on the corner of North Prince and Frederick streets, where a company called Ace Rents existed. Initially, Ace Rents stalled the process, but quickly came to an agreement as they did not want to cause delay. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on April 28, 2004, and Clipper Magazine Stadium was finished just before it opened on May 11, 2005.\n\nWith its brick façade and steel beams, the architecture of Clipper Magazine Stadium alludes to its industrial surroundings. Located in Lancaster's Northwest Corridor, the ballpark faces many downtown factories and is itself constructed over a former rail yard. Coincidentally, this section of Lancaster city (between North Mary and North Charlotte Streets, south of the Harrisburg Pike) was historically known as the \"base ball ground\", circa 1886.\n\nIn July 2007, the Lancaster Barnstormers hosted the Atlantic League All-Star Game at Clipper Magazine Stadium. The league's former North Division won, 8-6.\n\nClipper Magazine Stadium includes 6,000 green, chair-back seats in two levels divided by an open, 360-degree concourse. It also features other seating options such as luxury suites with professional catering, lawn seating that expands the ballpark's seating capacity to 7,500, and bleachers along the left-field wall. Additionally, the venue includes a Kid's Park with a birthday zone, a carousel, jungle gyms, a rock climbing wall, and various inflatables. Cylo's Clubhouse allows for youth to interact with the Barnstormers' bovine mascot, Cylo. Behind Section 13, the stadium features the Little Sluggers Dugout, an enclosed area for nursing mothers with a toddler play area and a television. The local Subaru dealer sponsors an outdoor area complete with Bocce Ball, corn-hole, a life-size Jenga, shuffleboard, ping pong, giant checkers, and a dog kissing booth, and a barbershop corner. The area also features the Broken Bat Craft Beer Deck, which features a wide variety of Central Pennsylvania craft beer choices.\n\nThe Inside Corner Team Store is the official Lancaster Barnstormers' team apparel and souvenir store. It is located at the home-plate entrance and open year-round. \n\nThe Picnic Pavilion features a traditional ballpark menu with an emphasis on items produced in Lancaster County. This emphasis includes Hess's BBQ (a four-time Pennsylvania state barbecue champion), Philly Pretzel Factory soft pretzels, Kunzler hot dogs, beer from the Lancaster Brewing Company, and Turkey Hill ice cream and iced tea. Other regional foods provided at Clipper Magazine Stadium include cheesesteaks and whoopie pies. Next to the Picnic Pavilion is an area with grass and picnic tables simply called \"The Backyard.\" \n\nAside from the entertainment options, the venue depicts Lancaster's professional baseball history with a visual display, to include a mural honoring Richard M. Scott. Scott was a former Lancaster mayor (1974–1979) who initiated the civic effort toward Clipper Magazine Stadium.\nBefore the 2013 Atlantic League season, the Lancaster Barnstormers made a series of improvements to Clipper Magazine Stadium. The first of these was a new playground for children along the third-base line featuring a foam-based protective floor. Other improvements included a renovated picnic area with new tents and a deck comprising synthetic materials instead of wood, a new right-field wall, landscaping beyond the outfield, and computerized irrigation controls.\n\nHome Run Harbor, a 36,000-gallon, artificial pond with 10 bumper boats equipped with water cannons, a small waterfall, and a bridge was added prior to the 2008 season. An estimated 30% of the home runs at the ballpark are hit toward the Home Run Harbor area, making the location a great place to see long-ball action. Safety netting prevented incoming baseballs from injuring patrons of the attraction. The bumper boats attraction was closed after the 2015 season.\n\nThe Lancaster Barnstormers added the Silverball Museum Arcade in time for the 2011 Atlantic League season. It is a coin-free attraction that includes nostalgic arcade games from the 1930s to some of the video games played in the present. Each machine possesses a description of its history and inspiration. The Silverball Museum Arcade also has televisions and multimedia detailing everything pinball.\n\nIn late 2012, an artist named Derek Parker installed his baseball stitches sculpture along Clipper Magazine Stadium's main walkway on North Prince Street. It symbolically links the ballpark to Lancaster city. As the sixth Poetry Paths project completed by Franklin & Marshall College's Writer's House, the stitches also tie professional baseball and the arts. It includes the Le Hinton poem called \"Our Ballpark\" and is part of a $250,000 initiative by the Lancaster County Community Foundation to add art and poetry into Lancaster city's urban environment.\n\nOn New Year's Eve 2010, Clipper Magazine Stadium hosted its first celebration, \"3…2…1! Lancaster.\" The event was coordinated with a concert, fireworks, and the Red Rose drop at nearby Binns Park.\n\nClipper Magazine Stadium is converted to an outdoor public ice-skating rink during the winter months so the Lancaster community can enjoy the ballpark in the off-season. Using state-of-the art equipment, the right field segment of the ballpark is converted to an ice skating rink measuring 135 feet by 85 feet with skate rental available; the concessions serve ballpark fare as well as soup, coffee, and hot chocolate. In 2010, a 26-foot Ice Slide attraction by Avalanche Express was added to the Ice Park.\n\nIn 2012, the Barnstormers held its first annual celebrity softball game, which was hosted by LeSean McCoy, an All-Pro running back on the Philadelphia Eagles and Harrisburg native. The contest pits the Eagles against professional football players from other teams in the National Football League. The 2012 Eagles roster featured Brent Celek, Hugh Douglas, DeSean Jackson, Jeremy Maclin, Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie, Torrey Smith, Michael Vick, and Brian Westbrook. Their opponents included Victor Cruz of the New York Giants, Devin Hester of the Chicago Bears, Cam Newton of the Carolina Panthers, Hakeem Nicks of the New York Giants, Ray Rice of the Baltimore Ravens, and Mike Wallace of the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nAny proceeds collected for the LeSean McCoy Celebrity Softball Game are directed to the LeSean McCoy Foundation, a 501(c)(3) organization that serves to raise funds and awareness for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. LeSean McCoy is motivated by his grandmother's death due to ALS. Additionally, the Foundation also provides for the underprivileged in Central Pennsylvania and Philadelphia. Some of the money collected from the 2012 game provided Christmas toys to the Boys and Girls Club and the Salvation Army, sports gear to the Police Athletic League, a professional football game and a winter vacation for families affected by ALS, winter coats and backpacks containing necessary school supplies for impoverished children, and winter coats for a women's and children's shelter in Philadelphia.\n\nClipper Magazine Stadium has hosted various concerts, including rock musicians Bob Dylan, Bryan Adams, Def Leppard, and Jefferson Starship; country music artists Clint Black, Dwight Yoakam, and Willie Nelson; and smooth jazz instrumentalist Kenny G.\n\nOn July 16, 2009, Clipper Magazine Stadium hosted an exhibition match between the Harrisburg City Islanders and Crystal Palace, an English team based in London. The ballpark's infield was covered with grass sod in order to convert it for the game. Additionally, local soccer training was scheduled at Clipper Magazine Stadium to maximize the soccer pitch's use.\n\nIn August 2015, the venue hosted two professional soccer games. The first featured the Harrisburg City Islanders versus FC Montreal, both members of the United Soccer League. The second match included the Philadelphia Union, a Major League Soccer club, versus Harrisburg.\n\nFor the 2016 season, the Harrisburg City Islanders played 5 regular season games at Clipper Magazine Stadium. The other 10 home games were played at FNB Field on City Island in Harrisburg\n\n"}

Eurostar was previously operated by three separate companies in Belgium, France and the United Kingdom, but this structure was replaced by EIL as a new single management company on 1 September 2010. EIL is owned by SNCF (55%), Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ) (30%), Hermes Infrastructure (10%) and NMBS/SNCB (5%).\n\nEurostar International is the largest customer of Getlink, the owner of the Channel Tunnel.\n\nEurostar International was formed in 1990 as European Passenger Services (EPS), as the division of British Rail responsible for the UK section of the Eurostar operation. Eurostar trains began operating on 14 November 1994, with EPS, NMBS/SNCB and SNCF were each responsible for the running of Eurostar services in their own territory.\n\nOn 1 April 1994, EPS signed a fixed-rate track access contract with Railtrack lasting until 29 July 2052 as part of the plans for Regional Eurostar services.\n\nThe privatisation of British Rail saw ownership of EPS transferred to London and Continental Railways (LCR) in 1996, which is a property development company owned by the Government of the United Kingdom. This was part of the contract agreed with the British Government for LCR build and operate High Speed 1 (HS1) between London and the Channel Tunnel. The company was renamed Eurostar (UK) Limited (EUKL) and was to use the income from EUKL to help finance the HS1 project.\n\nFollowing financial assistance from the government in 1998, LCR was forced to appoint a management contract for EUKL. Bids for the contract were submitted by Virgin Rail Group and Inter-Capital and Regional Rail, a consortium of National Express (40%), SNCF (35%), NMBS/SNCB (15%) and British Airways (10%). The latter was awarded the contract which was to run from 1998 until 2010.\n\nIn January 2009, after the completion of HS1, the UK's Department for Transport took control of LCR and announced its intention to put both HS1 and EUKL up for sale. Deutsche Bahn expressed an interest in EUKL but no sale materialised.\n\nOn 31 December 2009, EUKL was renamed Eurostar International Limited (EIL). On 1 September 2010, the three national Eurostar operators merged into EIL as a single company with a single management structure. Following this change, the ICRR management contract for the UK business was terminated. Once all Eurostar assets were transferred to EIL, the holdings in the company were amended to LCR (40%), NMBS/SNCB (5%) and SNCF (55%).\n\nLCR sold a 30-year concession to operate HS1 in November 2010 to a Canadian consortium of Borealis Infrastructure and Ontario Teacher's Pension Plan for £2.1bn.

The ballpark hosts 70 Patriots games plus some playoff games and other high school and corporate events each year. The ballpark is centrally located in the heart of Somerset County.\n\nTD Bank Ballpark is named for TD Bank, N.A., which purchased Commerce Bancorp in 2009. Formerly called Commerce Bank Ballpark, the original naming rights were sold to the institution in July 2000. The ballpark was originally known as Somerset Ballpark. Its first regular season baseball game was held on June 7, 1999. Since its opening, TD Bank Ballpark has welcomed over 6 million fans through its gates.\n\nConstruction on the ballpark commenced on April 28, 1998 with Epic Construction as the general contractor.\n\nTD Bank Ballpark was opened by then–New Jersey governor Christine Todd Whitman and other New Jersey officials on June 7, 1999.\n\nTD Bank Ballpark is the home of the Somerset County Baseball Tournament and was the home of the Big East Conference Baseball Tournament from 2000-2005. In the off-season, the ballpark has been the site of the Big Apple Circus, most recently in 2016, and other big events. In 2002 and 2003, TD Bank Ballpark was home to the New Jersey Pride of Major League Lacrosse. In 2004, the New Jersey Fire of Pro Cricket played their only season of existence at TD Bank Ballpark.\n\nIn 2000, TD Bank Ballpark hosted the Atlantic League All-Star Game, with a crowd of 7,035.

Bosmont is located in the West Rand of Johannesburg and nearly all of its residents are Coloured.\n\nIt was during the sixties that people of colour were forced to move from areas such as Albertsville, Vrededorp (Fietas) and other areas in and around the inner city to be settled in new designated areas such as Bosmont and Eldorado Park.\n\nThe name of this suburb - BOSMONT is derived from the fact that the street names are named after South African trees of bushes (Bos in Afrikaans, one of the local languages) and Mont (short for Mountain). This has been contracted into Bosmont. Streets running in one direction are named after trees Eg Olywenhout Street. Streets running perpendicular to them are named after mountains Eg. Soutpansburg Str.\n\nAs a result of the Group Areas Act, the Coloured people were forcibly relocated from 1962 to 1974 since Vrededorp was declared a European township in 1936.\n\nThe land for the suburb was proclaimed in June 1954. The township Bosmont and New Monteleo were joined together under the same name Bosmont in 1962. Bosmont was incorporated into the Johannesburg municipal area and developed by the Department of Community Development for Coloured People.\n\nBy June 1962, residents started occupying homes in Bosmont. Bosmont used to enjoy and is still enjoying considerable prestige as an elite suburb in the eyes of the Coloured community and houses there are sought after by those who can afford them.\n\nA significant difference between Bosmont and other predominantly Coloured areas is its large concentration of Cape Malay Coloureds (the largest Cape Malay culture in Johannesburg). Due to this, Islam has become a prominent feature in Bosmont and it also exists in complete peace and harmony with other faiths such as Christianity and Hinduism, however Christianity still remains as the largest religion in Bosmont.\n\nChurches in Bosmont include:\n\nThe majority of Muslims in Bosmont follow the Shafi Madhab. This too is unique in that the majority of Muslims in the Gauteng province of (who are mostly Indian) follow the Hanafi Madhab. Leaders in churches and mosques play a big role in uniting the community to fight crime, drugs, etc.\n\nBosmont is home to four government schools (C.J. Botha High, R.W. Fick High, G.R. Harris Primary and Bosmont Primary) and two private schools (Bosmont Muslim School and St Barnabas High School). Recreational activities are the Bosmont library, various sports grounds (soccer, cricket, basketball and tennis) and the BFA Soccer Stadium.\n\nBosmont has a number of soccer teams, including Aston Villa, Rangers, Universals and Dazzlers. Dazzlers Football Club is the most well-known and popular soccer team from Bosmont. Dazzlers was founded in the South African winter of 1949 in Albertville, Johannesburg, South Africa by Wilfred, ‘Willie’, Mooi and his cousin, Clifford Jousten.\n\nDazzlers Football Club originated with a comic book. Frank Stuart Pepper wrote a comic strip called ‘Danny of the Dazzlers’ which started appearing in ‘The Champion’ in 1948 and continued until the magazine's demise in 1955.\nDazzlers FC played under the TIFA (Transvaal Independent Football Association) which represented Coloured, Indian and African football clubs.\n\nOther activities can be found at the Bosmont Recreation Centre (Ward 82). Activities include Bosmont Clinic, Bosmont Alcoholics Anonymous, Cancer support, Children's afternoon free play, Church groups, Crime forum, Hall hire, Holiday programme, Karate, Modern dance, Senior citizens group, Table tennis, Youth Club\nBosmont also has Chinese, Christian, Hindu, Muslim and Tamil sections in the Bosmont Cemetery.\n\nDistances to other towns close to Bosmont include:\n"}

It lies west of Limavady on the main Derry to Limavady A2 road and is east of Derry. It is designated as a Large Village and in 2001 the population of Ballykelly (excluding Walworth) was 1,827. It lies within Causeway Coast and Glens district.\n\nBallykelly contains some of the most interesting buildings erected in Ulster by the Plantation companies, being largely developed by the London Company of Fishmongers through the 18th and 19th centuries. It features Tamlaghtfinlagan Parish Church, built by Earl Frederick Hervey, 18th-century Bishop of Derry, amongst many traditional buildings. The Presbyterian Church, Drummond Hotel and North West Independent Hospital, were all built by the London Company of Fishmongers. The village enjoys views across Lough Foyle to Inishowen in County Donegal and is bordered by Ballykelly Forest which was the first State Forest in Northern Ireland. Although there are good health and educational facilities available, there is only a limited retail sector relative to the population of the village.\n\nThe village lies within the East Londonderry constituency and is represented by Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) member, Gregory Campbell.\n\nThe village was originally laid out as a Plantation settlement. The development of the nearby World War II airfield greatly enhanced the size and significance of the village. There has been considerable expansion throughout the post-War period, particularly since the 1990s, with a series of private residential developments west of the historic core along Clooney Road.\n\nRAF Ballykelly opened in 1941 as an airfield RAF Coastal Command and closed in 1971, because of the British Government's defence cuts. The station was transferred to the British Army, who renamed it Shackleton Barracks. The Army was due to leave Shackleton Barracks in early 2008. During World War II an RAF bomber aeroplane on a training run clipped a telephone line behind a church in Ballykelly and crashed, claiming the lives of the crew. The aircraft was carrying out a trials mission involving low level parachuting, but a parachute became entangled with the tailplane, putting the aircraft out of control.\n\nDuring the Northern Irish Troubles the Droppin Well bombing occurred in Ballykelly, killing 17 people in a local disco and bar. Although one of the most fatal single incidents of the conflict, it was the only fatal Troubles-related incident to take place in Ballykelly.\n\n\nBallykelly is classified as a village by the NI Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) (i.e., with a population of between 1,000 and 2,250 people). On Census day (29 April 2001) there were 1,836 people living in Ballykelly. Of these:\n\nFor more details see: NI Neighbourhood Information Service\n\nOn Census day in 1800\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Anglican parish of Tamlaghtfinlagan originally was located southwest of the current village. The village is recorded in Papal Bulls of the mid-12th century. The name Tamlaghtfinlagan comes from the Irish for \"the resting place of Finliganus\", one of Columba's monks who was, according to tradition, the founding abbot of the abbey. This abbey building still exists, although in ruins. In the mid-16th century the parish church moved to Walworth. In 1689 it was gutted by the retreating troops of James II following the defeat in the Battle of the Boyne. The current edifice was dedicated in 1795, and is a simple perpendicular church, with three aisles, a small chancel and a gallery, much of which was built by the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers.\n\n\n"}

The first lanthanum C complex was synthesized in 1985 and called La@C. The @ (at sign) in the name reflects the notion of a small molecule trapped inside a shell. Two types of endohedral complexes exist: endohedral metallofullerenes and non-metal doped fullerenes.\n\nIn a traditional chemical formula notation, a buckminsterfullerene (C) with an atom (M) was simply represented as MC regardless of whether M was inside or outside the fullerene. In order to allow for more detailed discussions with minimal loss of information, a more explicit notation was proposed in 1991, \nwhere the atoms listed to the left of the @ sign are situated inside the network composed of the atoms listed to the right. The example above would then be denoted M@C if M were inside the carbon network. A more complex example is K(K@CB), which denotes \"a 60-atom fullerene cage with one boron atom substituted for a carbon in the geodesic network, a single potassium trapped inside, and two potassium atoms adhering to the outside.\"\n\nThe choice of the symbol has been explained by the authors as being concise, readily printed and transmitted electronically (the at sign is included in ASCII, which most modern character encoding schemes are based on), and the visual aspects suggesting the structure of an endohedral fullerene.\n\nDoping fullerenes with electropositive metals takes place in an arc reactor or via laser evaporation. The metals can be transition metals like scandium, yttrium as well as lanthanides like lanthanum and cerium. Also possible are endohedral complexes with elements of the alkaline earth metals like barium and strontium, alkali metals like potassium and tetravalent metals like uranium, zirconium and hafnium. The synthesis in the arc reactor is however unspecific. Besides unfilled fullerenes, endohedral metallofullerenes develop with different cage sizes like La@C or La@C and as different isomer cages. Aside from the dominant presence of mono-metal cages, numerous di-metal endohedral complexes and the tri-metal carbide fullerenes like ScC@C were also isolated.\n\nIn 1999 a discovery drew large attention. With the synthesis of the ScN@C by Harry Dorn and coworkers, the inclusion of a molecule fragment in a fullerene cage had succeeded for the first time. This compound can be prepared by arc-vaporization at temperatures up to 1100 °C of graphite rods packed with scandium(III) oxide iron nitride and graphite powder in a K-H generator in a nitrogen atmosphere at 300 Torr.\n\nEndohedral metallofullerenes are characterised by the fact that electrons will transfer from the metal atom to the fullerene cage and that the metal atom takes a position off-center in the cage. The size of the charge transfer is not always simple to determine. In most cases it is between 2 and 3 charge units, in the case of the La@C however it can be even about 6 electrons such as in ScN@C which is better described as [ScN]@[C]. These anionic fullerene cages are very stable molecules and do not have the reactivity associated with ordinary empty fullerenes. They are stable in air up to very high temperatures (600 to 850 °C).\n\nThe lack of reactivity in Diels-Alder reactions is utilised in a method to purify [C] compounds from a complex mixture of empty and partly filled fullerenes of different cage size. In this method Merrifield resin is modified as a cyclopentadienyl resin and used as a solid phase against a mobile phase containing the complex mixture in a column chromatography operation. Only very stable fullerenes such as [ScN]@[C] pass through the column unreacted.\n\nIn Ce@C the two metal atoms exhibit a non-bonded interaction. Since all the six-membered rings in C-I are equal the two encapsulated Ce atoms exhibit a three-dimensional random motion. This is evidenced by the presence of only two signals in the C-NMR spectrum. It is possible to force the metal atoms to a standstill at the equator as shown by x-ray crystallography when the fullerene is exahedrally functionalized by an electron donation silyl group in a reaction of Ce@C with 1,1,2,2-tetrakis(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-1,2-disilirane.\n\nGd@C(OH), an endohedral metallofluorenol, can competitively inhibit the WW domain in the oncogene YAP1 from activating. It was originally developed as a MRI contrast agent.\n\nMartin Saunders in 1993 produced endohedral complexes He@C and Ne@C by pressurizing C to ca. 3 bar in a noble-gas atmosphere. Under these conditions about one out of every 650,000 C cages was doped with a helium atom. \nThe formation of endohedral complexes with helium, neon, argon, krypton and xenon as well as numerous adducts of the He@C compound was also demonstrated with pressures of 3 kbars and incorporation of up to 0.1% of the noble gases.\n\nWhile noble gases are chemically very inert and commonly exist as individual atoms, this is not the case for nitrogen and phosphorus and so the formation of the endohedral complexes N@C, N@C and P@C is more surprising. \nThe nitrogen atom is in its electronic initial state (S) and is therefore to be highly reactive. Nevertheless, N@C is sufficiently stable that exohedral derivatization from the mono- to the hexa adduct of the malonic acid ethyl ester is possible. \nIn these compounds no charge transfer of the nitrogen atom in the center to the carbon atoms of the cage takes place. Therefore, C-couplings, which are observed very easily with the endohedral metallofullerenes, could only be observed in the case of the N@C in a high resolution spectrum as shoulders of the central line.\n\nThe central atom in these endohedral complexes is located in the center of the cage. While other atomic traps require complex equipment, e.g. laser cooling or magnetic traps, endohedral fullerenes represent an atomic trap that is stable at room temperature and for an arbitrarily long time. Atomic or ion traps are of great interest since particles are present free from (significant) interaction with their environment, allowing unique quantum mechanical phenomena to be explored. For example, the compression of the atomic wave function as a consequence of the packing in the cage could be observed with ENDOR spectroscopy. The nitrogen atom can be used as a probe, in order to detect the smallest changes of the electronic structure of its environment.\n\nContrary to the metallo endohedral compounds, these complexes cannot be produced in an arc. Atoms are implanted in the fullerene starting material using gas discharge (nitrogen and phosphorus complexes) or by direct ion implantation. Alternatively, endohedral hydrogen fullerenes can be produced by opening and closing a fullerene by organic chemistry methods.\nA recent example of endohedral fullerenes includes single molecules of water encapsulated in C.\n\nAccording to state-of-the-art DFT calculations, noble gas endofullerenes should demonstrate unusual polarizability. Thus, calculated values of mean polarizability of Ng@C do not equal to the sum of polarizabilities of a fullerene cage and the trapped atom, i.e. exaltation of polarizability occurs.. The sign of the Δ\"α\" polarizability exaltation depends on the number of atoms in a fullerene molecule: for small fullerenes (formula_1), it is positive; for the larger ones (formula_2), it is negative (depression of polarizability). The following formula, describing the dependence of Δα on n, has been proposed: Δ\"α\" = \"α\"(2\"e\"−1). It describes the DFT-calculated mean polarizabilities of Ng@C endofullerenes with sufficient accuracy. The calculated data allows using C fullerene as a Faraday cage, which isolates the encapsulated atom from the external electric field. The mentioned relations should be typical for the more complicated endohedral structures (e.g., C@C and giant fullerene-containing \"onions\" ).\n\nClosed fullerenes encapsulating small molecules have been synthesized by long sequences of organic reactions. Notable achievements are the synthesis of the dihydrogen endofullerene H@C, the water endofullerene HO@C, the hydrogen fluoride endofullerene HF@C, and the methane endofullerene CH@C by the groups of Komatsu, Murata and Whitby The encapsulated molecules display unusual physical properties which have been studied by a variety of physical methods. As shown theoretically, compression of molecular endofullerenes (e.g., H@C) may lead to dissociation of the encapsulated molecules and reaction of their fragments with interiors of the fullerene cage. Such reactions should result in endohedral fullerene adducts, which are currently unknown.\n\n\n"}

From 1897 to 1899 he went to the \"Openbare Handelsschool\" (a college level business school). After this he started work as an office clerk in Hengelo, but quickly returned to Amsterdam, where he held a succession of similar jobs. In 1905 Nescio married Aagje Tiket, with whom he would raise four daughters. Until his death in a Hilversum sanatorium in 1961, Nescio would remain in Amsterdam.\n\nFrits Grönloh started writing as Nescio, as he wanted to keep his professional career and his writing career separate. All his stories bear witness to the conflict between his career and his ideals, as formed by the turn of the century utopian socialism. In 1900 he had started a commune inspired by Frederik van Eeden's \"Walden\" commune; the commune was wound up in 1903. He still kept his ideals but was no longer personally involved.\n\nInstead he turned to writing, as well as long solitary walks in the countryside around Amsterdam. Not very prolific, much of his writing remained unpublished until after his death, and the stories he did publish went out of print quickly. His decision to use a pseudonym does not help with this: it was only in 1932 that Nescio revealed his true name. This led to a reprint of \"De uitvreter/Titaantjes/Dichtertje\" in 1933, as well as some critical attention.\n\nIt was only after World War II that he became reasonably well known, though his oeuvre is still small, roughly 160 pages. However growing critical appreciation led to him receiving the in 1954, as well as the publication of a new collection of stories just before his death in 1961.\n\nHis name lives on in the form of the \"Nesciobrug\" which enables cyclists and pedestrians to go from Diemen to IJburg over the Amsterdam-Rhine Canal.\n\nNescio was not a prolific writer, and it did not help that none of his stories had any success at publication. His reputation as an important Dutch writer therefore rests solely on three short stories, \"De uitvreter\" (1911), \"Titaantjes\" (1915) and\n\"Dichtertje\" (1918).\n\n\"De uitvreter\" (The freeloader) was first published in the Dutch literary magazine \"De Gids\". The central character is Japi, who wants to be the perfect bohemian, not wanting to do anything with his life but just sit and look at the sea. He is a friend of Koekebakker, the narrator, who thinks Japi is, \"apart from the man who thought the Sarphatistraat in Amsterdam was the most beautiful place in Europe, the strangest person he had known\". He is also friends with an unsuccessful painter, Bavink, who like Koekebakker would return in \"Titaantjes\". Japi sponges off both Koekebakker and Bavink, as well as other friends, but they do not mind greatly, as he is such an innocent.\n\nThe theme of the story is how ideals conflict with the demands of society, which Japi resolves by quietly committing suicide at the end of the book (by stepping from the Nijmegen railway bridge), when it is no longer possible for him to keep pursuing his ideal of doing absolutely nothing. Bavink as an \nunsuccessful painter is the best at not conforming, while the narrator is slowly seduced by material comforts.\n\n\"Titaantjes\" (little titans) was first published in \"Groot-Nederland\". It is a semi-sequel to \"De uitvreter\" and again features Koekebakker as narrator, reminiscing about his time with Bavink, and the newly introduced characters of Hoyer, Bekker, and Kees, when he still had ideals. The opening sentence is \"Boys we were – but nice boys\". The story then leaps ahead several years. Koekebakker is now a successful journalist, while each of the others have failed their ideals in one way or another. Hoyer has given up on changing the world, and works painting portraits. Kees has a blue collar job. Bekker is a mid range official in the SDAP. The most ardent adherent to their youthful ideals, Bavink, went mad after being unable to create the masterpiece he had striven after for so long.\n\n\"Dichtertje\" (little poet) was published in one volume with \"De uitvreter\" and \"Titaantjes\" in a printrun of 500 copies by the art dealer J.H. de Bois. It is the story of an idealistic poet, which unlike the other two stories, is told by Nescio himself. It is slightly daring in its frank discussion of sexual mores and adultery for the time in which it was written, as well as having the \"God of the Netherlands\" on stage.\n\nThe theme of the story is again the conflict between idealistic youth and bourgeois adulthood, with the main character both mourning the loss of his ideals and accepting in his fate as a bourgeois family man.\n\n\nAn English translation of most of Nescio's stories was published in 2012 under the title \"Amsterdam Stories\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2283247", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2283247", "title": "Brendon McCullum", "text": "Brendon McCullum\n\nBrendon Barrie McCullum (born 27 September 1981) is a New Zealand cricket coach, commentator and former cricketer, who played all formats, and also a former captain in all forms. McCullum took quick scoring to Test matches as well, notably recording the fastest test century of all time. He is considered as one of the most successful batsmen and captains of New Zealand cricket. He retired from all forms of cricket in August 2019.\n\nMcCullum is the former leading run scorer in Twenty20 International cricket and is the first and so far only one of the two players to have scored two Twenty20 International centuries and 2000 runs in T20 Internationals (apart from Martin Guptill). He became the first New Zealander to score a triple hundred in a Test, 302 runs against India on 18 February 2014. In 2014, he also became the first New Zealander to score 1000 test runs in a calendar year (1164). The record was bettered by Kane Williamson with 1172 runs in 2015. In his last Test outing on 20 February 2016, McCullum posted the fastest ever Test century, in 54 balls, beating the 56-ball record jointly held by his hero, Vivian Richards and Misbah-ul-Haq, scoring a total of 145 off 79 balls.\n\nMcCullum was the first batsman to score 2 tons in t20I. He was the previous record holder for the highest individual score in a Twenty20 International (123 against Bangladesh in 2012) and third highest individual score in all Twenty20 cricket (158 not out for the Kolkata Knight Riders against the Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2008) which was later surpassed by Aaron Finch (173 against the Zimbabwe for Australian team and Chris Gayle (175 against the Pune Warriors India) for the Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2013 edition of IPL. He played for the Kolkata Knight Riders from 2008–2010 and again from 2012–2013, while in between he played for the Kochi Tuskers Kerala. He played the 2014 and 2015 seasons for the Chennai Super Kings. McCullum was a wicket-keeper until 2013.\n\nOn 22 December 2015, McCullum announced he would retire from international cricket at the end of the southern summer, joining his brother who had earlier that year announced his retirement from all forms of cricket. He is also the highest (170) runs scorer by the captain in his farewell test and first captain to score a century in his farewell test. He retired from all international cricket on 24 February 2016.\n\nHe played professionally with the Otago Volts at provincial level, the Lahore Qalandars in Pakistan Super League, the Brisbane Heat in Australia's Big Bash League and the Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL. McCullum was also involved in the Caribbean Premier League and the Bangladesh Premier League, as well as playing in the Pakistan Super League.\n\nHis brother Nathan McCullum was also a first-class and international cricketer, and their father Stuart McCullum was a long-serving first-class player for Otago. Both Brendon and Nathan attended King's High School in Dunedin.\n\nOn 3 March 2008, before facing England for the test series, McCullum was involved in the State Shield Final versus the Auckland Aces, scoring 170 runs for the Otago Volts to help beat the Aces at Eden Park's outer oval, and helped to chase down a daunting total of 7 for 310, he broke multiple State Shield batting records. He scored the fastest LA hundred off 52 balls, including 14 fours and 5 sixes. With 170 runs in the match, McCullum scored the highest score by any player in a domestic one-day match (Shell or State competitions) overtaking Blair Hartland's previous record.\n\nMcCullum played for Glamorgan in 2006 and he scored 160 opening the batting against Leicestershire in the County Championship. On 24 January 2009, he lined up for New South Wales in the final of Australia's KFC Twenty20 Big Bash. This was an exercise to allow him to be eligible to play for them in the Twenty20 Champions League. This sparked criticism however despite opinion States are permitted to have one overseas player in their squad. McCullum also donated his match fee from the game to Otago Junior Cricket.\n\nOn 16 January 2010 during the 2009-10 HRV Cup, vs Auckland Aces at University Oval, McCullum hit 108 not out off 67 deliveries, which included 10 fours and four sixes to lead Otago Volts to victory with three balls to spare. \nMcCullum reached his 50 off 32 deliveries and his century off 65 deliveries.\n\nFollowing his announcement to retire from international cricket in 2015, he signed with Middlesex for NatWest T20 Blast. His commitment would be for half a season after his stint at IPL, and may return for the Royal London One-Day Cup, provided that Middlesex qualifies for the playoffs.\n\nIn September 2016 he signed with the Lahore Qalandars for the 2017 season of the Pakistan Super League and will be the team's captain.\n\nIn the inaugural Indian Premier League tournament in 2008 he played for Kolkata Knight Riders. On 18 April 2008 in the first ever IPL match, he achieved the highest Twenty20 individual score in an innings, 158* against RCB. This eclipsed the previous record mark of 141, held by Australian Cameron White. Coincidentally, McCullum faced an over from White during the match and scored 24 from it; it was White's only over in that match. This record was eventually broken by Chris Gayle when he piled on 175 runs in IPL 2013. In the same match he also claimed the record for most sixes (13) in a Twenty20 innings, which was later surpassed by Englishman Graham Napier (16).\n\nHe was bought by Kochi Tuskers Kerala in the 2011 IPL auctions. He returned to the Knight Riders in 2012. In the 2014 IPL auctions, McCullum was bought by Chennai Super Kings. He was given the role of opening the innings along with West Indian Dwayne Smith and the pair was considered as the most dangerous opening pair in the league's history. In 2018 he was released by CSK and bought by Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2018. He currently plays for the Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL franchise. As well as that he has made five appearances for Hibiscus Coast Cricket Club of Orewa, New Zealand.\n\nDuring the RCB's season opener against Kolkata Knight Riders during the 2018 IPL season, he reached 9000 runs in all forms of T20 cricket and became only the second player after Chris Gayle to achieve the milestone.\n\nIn 2004, he played in a Test series against England and scored what was then his highest score, an innings of 96 at Lord's. His maiden Test century came several months later when he scored 143 against Bangladesh. He fell just short of his second Test hundred in a game against Sri Lanka when dismissed one short of his hundred. His second century would later come with a run a ball 111 against Zimbabwe.\n\nHe was selected in the 20-man ICC World XI squad for the ICC Super Series in July 2005. On 20 February 2007, he scored 86 not out as New Zealand went on to be the first team to whitewash Australia in a three-match ODI series since 1997. During the innings he partnered with Craig McMillan to score 165, equalling the world record for a 6th wicket partnership.\n\nOn 31 December 2007 he scored 50 from just 19 balls against Bangladesh. He finished his innings with 80 runs from only 28 balls, including 9 fours and 6 sixes with a strike rate of 285.71.\n\nOn 22 December 2015, McCullum announced his intention to retire from International cricket at the end of the southern summer in his home test against Australia, rather than after the 2016 ICC World Twenty20. He played his last ODI match against Australia on 8 February 2016 in which he scored 47 off 27 and New Zealand beat Australia by 55 runs thereby winning the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy 2–1.\n\nOn 22 February 2016, McCullum played his last innings in a Test Match against Australia. He scored 25 off 27, when he was dismissed by Josh Hazlewood one ball after hitting him for a 6. McCullum was given a guard of honour upon entry onto the field, and was given a standing ovation once dismissed. Brendon McCullum on his retirement said that the time was right to quit international cricket and said that he hopefully left and brought some fun and enjoyment and some real culture back into the set-up in the time that he had as captain.\n\nOn 5 April 2009, on day three of the third Test match during India's tour of New Zealand, he displayed an amazing level of alertness in the dismissal of Rahul Dravid. Dravid attempted a sweep shot off Daniel Vettori's bowling, but McCullum saw what Dravid was up to before the ball had even pitched and moved swiftly to his left (Dravid's leg side). Ross Taylor at first slip did the same. The ball came nicely off Dravid's bat, but flew straight into the hands of a waiting Brendon McCullum. A couple of balls earlier, McCullum tried the same thing, but he had been a little slow and Dravid's sweep was kept low. Although there has been some discussion regarding the legality of McCullum's movement before the ball had even pitched, the laws of cricket indicate he was well within his right to do so.\n\nOn 6 November 2009, against Pakistan at Abu Dhabi, McCullum scored his second ODI century of 131 to elevate New Zealand to 303 and win the match to level the series. On 16 February 2010, during the only Test match against Bangladesh, he scored 185, which is the highest score ever by a New Zealand wicket-keeper in Test cricket. He was also involved in the record highest sixth-wicket partnership for New Zealand of 339 runs with Martin Guptill, missing out on the world record by just 12 runs.\n\nOn 27 February 2010, McCullum became the second player to score a T20I hundred, finishing 116 not out, one run short of Chris Gayle's record of 117. On 4 May 2010 McCullum became the first player to score 1,000 T20 international runs. He achieved this feat playing against Zimbabwe in the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 at Guyana.\n\nOn 28 June 2010, McCullum announced that he would not keep wicket for New Zealand in Test matches. He, however informed that he will still keep in 50-overs & T20 over games. He did a fine job in his first innings since handing over the wicketkeeping duties he scored 65 runs and was engaged in a 104 run partnership with Ross Taylor he was promoted to the position of opener in tests rather than his usual number 5 position. McCullum did however have experience of opening the innings because he opens for New Zealand in limited-overs cricket.\n\nOn 21 September 2012 at the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 tournament in Sri Lanka, McCullum scored 123 runs against Bangladesh at Pallekele, setting a new record for the highest Twenty20 International innings, and becoming the first player to score two Twenty20 International centuries. This record was broken by Aaron Finch against England, when he scored 156. However McCullum is one of the two players to have scored two Twenty20 International centuries along with West Indian Chris Gayle.\n\nHe was awarded the T20 Player of the Year by NZC for the 2012-13 season.\n\nIn 2014 at the Basin Reserve in Wellington, McCullum scored 302 runs in the third innings of the second test against India, becoming the first New Zealand batsman to score a triple-century. He shared a 352 run partnership with BJ Watling, then a record sixth wicket stand, rescuing New Zealand from a likely innings defeat. McCullum closed the innings at 680/8d, both the highest ever innings by New Zealand, and the highest ever third innings in Test cricket history.\n\nOn 21 November 2014, McCullum took his first ever wicket at test level, a caught-and-bowled of Pakistan's Sarfraz Ahmed during their second test. On 29 November 2014, McCullum scored a century on day 2 of the third test against the same opposition, in which both teams decided to call off play on the day before as a tribute to Phillip Hughes, and hand-written P.H. under each player's squad number as a further mark of respect. He was bowled out on 202 after hitting ten sixes in his innings, by far a record for New Zealand opening batsman. Two years after his debut as NZ captain, in which the team was bowled out for a paltry 45, Black Caps returned to respectability.\n\nOn 13 December 2014, McCullum was named New Zealander of the Year by the \"New Zealand Herald\" beating out stiff competition from Lane Pilkington due to his continued co-operation with ICC over the match-fixing scandal which resulted in Chris Cairns being charged for lying to court, and also for changing the perception of the Black Caps as easy-beats.\n\nOn the first day of the Boxing Day Test at Hagley Oval, McCullum scored 195 in the first innings against Sri Lanka, which gave him 1000 test runs in a calendar year, becoming the first New Zealander to reach this milestone (1164 at the end of the match, with Kane Williamson at 929), and the fastest test century (in 74 balls), beating his own record against Pakistan in Sharjah. He fell 5 runs shy of his 4th 200+ scores in a calendar year. His 33 sixes in test cricket in a single calendar year is also a world record. It is also worth noting that New Zealand only played 9 test matches in 2014. He also helped to push New Zealand to score 429/7 on day one, the most runs New Zealand had ever scored in a single day of play in test cricket. It ended with an 8-wicket win, which made it 5 test wins out of 9 in 2014, the most wins in a calendar year. He also closed the year with a triple century and two double centuries, the third person to do so after Donald Bradman and Michael Clarke.\n\nOn 3 January 2015 McCullum returned to Basin Reserve, where he scored his triple century against India. While he got a 2-ball duck on a green pitch and three errors as a fielder, he was given a key to Wellington, a symbolic equivalent of \"Honorary Citizen\", in recognition of his heroics the previous year, becoming the third person to receive the honour after Wellington-born Sir Peter Jackson and Sir Richard Taylor, who were recognised by the city for their work on the \"Lord of the Rings\" movies.\n\nFor his performances in the 2014-15 season, he won the Sir Richard Hadlee Medal.\n\nMcCullum also led New Zealand in the 2015 Cricket World Cup, which was co-hosted by New Zealand and Australia. On 20 February 2015, in New Zealand's third Pool A match against England, McCullum scored 77 runs off 25 balls, recording the fastest 50 in World Cup history (51 runs off 18 balls) and the 4th fastest fifty of all time. McCullum led the New Zealand team to their first World Cup final, scoring timely innings in the pool match against Australia and South Africa in the semi-final. The semi-final victory was New Zealand's first after six semi-final losses in the past. In the final against Australia, McCullum was bowled for a duck in just the first over of the match by Mitchell Starc, as New Zealand went on to lose to Australia by 7 wickets. Over the course of the tournament, McCullum was particularly aggressive in both batting as well as his captaincy, contributing to New Zealand reaching the finals. His aggressive starts against the strike bowlers of the opposition team such as James Anderson, Mitchell Johnson, and Dale Steyn favoured the rest of the players to play their natural game.\n\nOn 21 May 2015, McCullum started in his 93rd consecutive test, and batted in his preferred spot at no. 5. On 13 December 2015, on McCullum's 98th consecutive test start, he scored his 100th six hit in test cricket, tying the record by Adam Gilchrist. On 12 February 2016, McCullum started his 100th consecutive test, but was dismissed in both innings by Mitchell Marsh, making Marsh the second person since Jason Gillespie to dismiss him on both innings of 2 test matches.\n\nOn 20 February 2016, in his final test in his adopted home of Christchurch, McCullum became the only member left from the last Trans-Tasman Test in Christchurch in the pre-earthquake AMI Stadium. The third day of the test was the 5th anniversary of the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. He hit his 102nd career six to surpass Adam Gilchrist as the most prolific six-hitter in test cricket. He went on to score a century off 54 balls, beating joint record by West Indian Viv Richard and Pakistani Misbah-ul-Haq's record for the fastest test century by 2 balls. He also became the second player since Jason Gillespie to score a hundred or more in his final test. McCullum also recorded the highest (170) runs scorer by the captain in farewell test and 1st captain to score a ton in farewell test. He also took four catches as a fielder at first slip, deputising for the injured Ross Taylor.\n\nIn September 2018, he was named as the Icon Player for Kandahar's squad in the first edition of the Afghanistan Premier League tournament.\n\nIn July 2019, he was selected to play for the Glasgow Giants in the inaugural edition of the Euro T20 Slam cricket tournament. However, in August 2019 he retired from all forms of cricket.\n\nMcCullum originally played in the side as a wicketkeeper-batsman. His glove work improved during his tenure as the New Zealand wicketkeeper. His batting is good enough to earn him selection for the Black Caps alone, shown by the occasions on which he has been unable to keep but has still been selected as a batsman. He opens the batting for New Zealand in ODIs with steadily improving success. He is an aggressive batsman who is particularly strong over extra cover, often lofting the ball into the stands, and also square-cutting, or square-driving the ball. He is also adept at using the scoop shot, even using it at tests, so much so that McScoop was named after him. In 2010 McCullum hung up the gloves In Test cricket due to continued body strain and became a specialist batsmen in Test cricket, opening the innings in his first match as a specialist batsmen against India in Ahmedabad. He was described as a player \"especially suited to Twenty20 cricket\" when he signed for a five-week stint at Glamorgan in June 2006. The stint included the entire domestic 2006 Twenty20 Cup. He was signed up by the Kolkata Knight Riders of the IPL for $700,000. His contract with the IPL was for three years. In 2016, he was signed by the replacement/expansion team Gujarat Lions for US$1.1 million, making him the highest paid overseas player in the team's foundation squad.\n\nHe has the ability to play the Dilscoop (which was invented by Sri Lankan Tillakaratne Dilshan or precisely the ramp shot, which involves the batsman squatting down and scooping deliveries back over the wicketkeeper's area. The two shots has its own distinction, where Dilscoop is played right above the wicket-keeper's head, but ramp shot can be played in sideways of the wicket-keeper as well. Playing this ramp shot in a Twenty20 International match on 28 February 2010 in Lancaster Park, against Australia, he managed to hit Shaun Tait for two sixes in an over back over Brad Haddin's head, forcing Australia to set a back stop (the fielder near the boundary behind the wicketkeeper or first slip) in his final test match. He can also execute reverse sweep well. He also likes to cut, cover drive, or advance the wicket to punch the ball up for boundaries from a batting stance standing on or outside leg stump.\n\nDuring the Twenty20 World Championship in 2009, the wicketkeeping duties was given to Peter McGlashan. He was seen practicing his medium bowling. McCullum had to decide whether to play for New South Wales, KKR, or Otago in the 1st edition of the Champions League Twenty20. Since KKR did not qualify, he had only to consider playing for either New South Wales or Otago; eventually he had decided to play for Otago alongside brother Nathan McCullum.\n\nIn 2012, BJ Watling became McCullum's replacement as wicketkeeper in Tests, but due to Luke Ronchi's struggles in ODIs, McCullum still remained as wicketkeeper in ODIs and T20s. But by late 2013, McCullum's recurring back problems meant he can no longer perform wicketkeeping duties effectively, he gave up his gloves to Ronchi in ODIs and T20s, and McCullum became a middle order batsman, or as a cover for opening the batting in tests, having batted at 1,2,5–7 in his career, while his fielding position becomes predominantly mid-off, mid-on or mid-wicket, and in his final international matches, he ended at first slip after the injury to Ross Taylor. He is also a very seldomly-used part-time medium pace bowler in tests. He got his first wicket in all forms of international cricket from a caught-and-bowled against Sarfraz Ahmed of Pakistan which ended their first innings in 2014. McCullum was picked for 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup as an opening batsman due to inconsistencies from Martin Guptill and Tom Latham and the emergence of Grant Elliott as a solid option at number five batsman. His role as a pinch hitter saw the team reach their first ever World Cup final. After the World Cup, he returned to his preferred spot at number five for tests. He still occasionally keeps wickets for domestic T20s until 2015.\n\nIn the 2015 Queen's Birthday Honours McCullum was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to cricket. He won the New Zealand Sportsman Of The Year award in 2014, and then the Sport New Zealand Leadership Award in 2016.\n\nIn June 2016, just a few months after his retirement from international cricket, McCullum was honoured with an invitation to deliver the prestigious MCC Spirit of Cricket Cowdrey Lecture. He became only the second New Zealand player ever to have been invited to deliver the Cowdrey lecture, the only other New Zealander being the late Martin Crowe.\n\nHe was appointed as head coach for both Trinbago Knight Riders and Kolkata Knight Riders in August 2019.\n\nMcCullum has since been involved in setting up CricHQ with the company's CEO Simon Baker and former New Zealand cricketer Stephen Fleming. The cricket competition management software and live scoring platform manages the administration of cricket test countries New Zealand, Sri Lanka, South Africa and Zimbabwe with 49 of 105 national governing bodies also use its services from club level upwards. 20 other high-profile cricketing names have invested in the company. In June 2015 it raised US$10m from Singapore private equity firm Tembusu Partners to expand globally.\n\nIn May 2018, he briefly returned to rugby for a month, a game he hasn't played since starting over Dan Carter in high school before retiring, citing diminishing knowledge of the game, and rugby fitness.\n\n\n"}

It had around 100 sites across the globe and employed nearly 35,000 people. In October 2018 is was acquired by French aerospace and defense company Safran.\n\nThe company was founded in 1896 as \"Mallet, Mélandri et de Pitray\" by Maurice Mallet and his associates. In the beginning, the company was involved in the production of hydrogen balloons for sport and tourism.\nIn 1909, the company changed its name to become \"Zodiac\". It then experienced a boom in the construction of airplanes and airships, especially for the Aérostation Maritime (Naval Balloon Command) and through its participation in the war effort. Until the 1930s, 63 airships would leave Zodiac's workshops.\n\nIn 1934, the company created the first prototype inflatable boats, ancestors of the renowned \"Zodiac\", which would contribute to the development of the civil and military inflatable boat industry. \nThe company then benefited from the boom in leisure activities after the Second World War, as well as the French infatuation with recreational boating in the 1960s: Zodiac, therefore, developed inflatable boats for the civil market and gradually gave up the airship market for the more promising water sports market. Zodiac would nevertheless honor a contract in 1966 with CNES (Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales - National Centre for Space Studies) for the production of a meteorological balloon, in the scope of the EOLE project. At the end of the 1960s, the Group reorganized and set up its first sales operation for exporting its products overseas more easily. In 1964 it opened its first subsidiary in Spain - \"Zodiac Española\" - and then \"Zodiac North America\" in 1970.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1970s, Zodiac experienced financial difficulties. Spurred on by its new CEO, Jean-Louis Gerondeau, and with the support of shareholders and the IDI (Institut pour le Développement Industriel - French Institute for Industrial Development), the Group recovered by 1977. In 1983, Zodiac was the first company to be listed on the 'Second Market' of the Paris Stock Exchange. \nThe firm conducted an international development policy and increases its acquisitions, thereby enabling it to position itself in niche markets on a global scale. In 1978, it acquired Aérazur Constructions Aéronautiques and thus re-entered the aerospace market. In 1979, it acquired EFA (Parachutes), which led to the creation of the aerospace segment, and continued its development in marine and aerospace with the acquisitions of Bombard-L'Angevinière (ranked second in inflatable boats), Sevylor (leading French producer of light PVC inflatable structures) in 1981 and Superflexit (flexible tanks) in 1983, as well as the takeover of Parachutes de France (sport parachutes). In 1987, Zodiac acquired Air Cruisers (leader in evacuation slides), Metzeler (inflatable boats), B. Kern, and Europool In 1988, it acquired Pioneer, at the time the second American manufacturer of deceleration and engine braking recovery systems through parachutes.\n\nIn the 1990s, the Group continued its acquisitions, strengthening its aerospace business. In 1998, Monogram Systems (onboard water and waste management) joined, as did the Intertechnique Group in 1999. The latter acquisition significantly increased the aerospace share in the Group's business and later enabled the creation of the Aircraft Systems segment, specializing in on-board systems. \nFrom 2002 to 2006, Zodiac successively acquired ESCO (emergency arresting systems), ICORE (cable protection and interconnect systems), Avox Systems (oxygen systems), C&D Aerospace (cabin interiors), Enertec and In-Snec (telemetry and data recording).\n\nIn September 2007, the Zodiac Group sold its Marine business to a holding company, 72% owned by the American Group Carlyle with 28% being retained by Zodiac, thus creating Zodiac Marine and Pool. \nIn November 2007, Olivier Zarrouati succeeded Jean-Louis Gerondeau as Chief Executive Officer.\n\nAt the beginning of 2008, the Group was renamed Zodiac Aerospace and adopted a new logo. \nAt the end of 2008, Zodiac Aerospace strengthened its position in the cabin interiors segment by acquiring the Dutch company Driessen (leading manufacturer of galleys for single-aisle aircraft and trolleys), Adder (cabin separators) and TIA (electrical equipment for galleys, mainly for the business aircraft market). Zodiac Aerospace continued its acquisition strategy in cabin interiors as well as in systems. In 2010, the Canadian company Cantwell Cullen & Co (cabling and interconnect systems) and the German company Sell GmbH (galleys for wide-bodied aircraft) joined the Group.\n\nThe year 2010 was marked by a takeover bid for Zodiac Aerospace by the French Group Safran. At the beginning of July 2010, Zodiac Aerospace announced that it had been officially approached by Safran and that, having examined Safran's proposal, its Supervisory Board had unanimously decided not to pursue it. For several months, Zodiac and Safran squared up in the media. In November 2010, the AMF (French Financial Markets Authority) summoned Safran to clarify its position: its CEO, Jean-Paul Herteman announced in November 2010 that he had given up his plan to acquire Zodiac Aerospace. \nSince 2011, Zodiac Aerospace has continued its acquisitions: \n\nIn September 2012, Zodiac Aerospace put in place an organization comprising five segments (Zodiac Aerosafety, Zodiac Aircraft Systems, Zodiac Cabin & Structures, Zodiac Galleys & Equipment and Zodiac Seats), complemented by an after-sales service business, Zodiac Aerospace Services.\n\nOn Tuesday, July 14, 2015, an explosion occurred in a prepreg treater at Zodiac Aerospace's Engineered Materials Plant in Newport, Washington, United States. Five individuals were injured as a result of the blast, and people were asked to remain at least 600 meters from the building.\n\nOn 19 January 2017, Safran announced a deal to buy Zodiac at €29.47 per share in cash, with a deal total of almost €10 billion ($10.5 billion).\nIn May 2017, Safran reduced the amount offered to take Zodiac by $1 billion after Zodiac posted an unfavorable earnings forecast. On 19 October 2018, Safran and Zodiac Aerospace signed an agreement for the latter to merge into Safran.\n\nWhen it was founded in 1896, the company was called \"Mallet, Mélandri et de Pitray\". It changed its name several times during the course of its history. In 1899, it became \"Ateliers de constructions aéronautiques Maurice Mallet\" (Maurice Mallet aerospace construction workshops), and nine years later it became \"Société française des ballons dirigeables\" (\"French company of balloons and dirigibles\"). \nIn 1909, the name Zodiac (with an English spelling) appeared in the name \"Société française de ballons dirigeables et d'aviation Zodiac\" (\"French company of balloons, dirigibles, and aviation, Zodiac\"), followed in 1911 by \"Société Zodiac, anciens Établissements aéronautiques Maurice Mallet\" (\"Zodiac Company, formerly Maurice Mallet aeronautical establishments\"). \nIn 1965, the company changed its name to \"Zodiac\".\nThe name Zodiac is associated with the inflatable boats that were developed after the Second World War and made famous by the explorations of Jacques Cousteau and the experiences of intentional castaway Alain Bombard. \nFor this reason, when the Zodiac Group sold its Marine business in 2007, the Zodiac brand was also sold. In accordance with the agreements signed with the acquiring company, the Group took the name of \"Zodiac Aerospace\", which emphasized its refocus on aerospace. \nThis name change was accompanied by the creation of a new logo.\n\nZodiac Aerospace provides equipment for commercial aircraft, regional aircraft, and business aircraft as well as helicopters and spacecraft. The Group consists of 5 operational segments, supported by a service activity.\n\nZodiac Aerosafety brings together businesses that develop on-board and ground safety systems as well as protection and rescue solutions. This segment comprises 5 divisions, mainly located in Europe and the United States. \nZodiac Arresting Systems (EMASMAX®)\n\nThe Zodiac Aircraft Systems segment specializes in onboard systems that provide essential in-flight functions. This segment comprises 7 divisions and is mainly located in Europe (France and Germany) and in the United States. \n\nThe Zodiac Galleys & Equipment segment comprises three divisions, located in Europe (France, Germany and the Netherlands), the United States and Thailand. \n\nThe Zodiac Cabin & Structures segment designs and manufactures cabin interiors for fitting out new aircraft and refitting old aircraft. It is mainly located in the United States. \n\nZodiac Seats designs, manufactures and sells passenger seats (first class, business class, premium economy, and standard economy class) for commercial and regional aircraft as well as technical seats (for aircraft pilots, seats for helicopters, and seats for flight crew). This segment comprises 4 main divisions: \n\nZodiac Aerospace Services is the after-sales service activity of Zodiac Aerospace Group. It has locations in Europe, the United States, the Middle East and Asia.\n\nZodiac Aerospace Group is a Limited Company with an Executive Board and a Supervisory Board. It is managed by the Executive Board, chaired by Olivier Zarrouati and by the Executive Committee. The Supervisory Board is chaired by Didier Domange.\n\nThe products and systems developed by Zodiac Aerospace mainly address the civil aerospace market. \nThey break down into two categories:\n This development is based both on organic growth as well as growth by acquisition.\n\nZodiac Aerospace takes part in research and innovation programs that bring together various industry players. \nZodiac Aerospace also supports innovation through the Jean-Louis Gerondeau Award, created four years ago to reward undergraduates or PhD students of the Ecole Polytechnique, championing a business creation project and encouraging entrepreneurial spirit and innovation.\n\nZodiac Aerospace's fiscal year starts on 1 September and ends on 31 August.\n\nZodiac Aerospace's shares are listed on the Euronext Paris market. As at 29 March 2016, Zodiac Aerospace's share capital stood at €4,515 million euros made up of 289,407,962 shares.\n\n\nFor many years, Zodiac Aerospace has been supporting the Petits Princes association at Group level. The Group also provides support for projects that encourage scientific research, as with \"Wings for Science\" in 2012 for example. Subsidiaries also support local initiatives, mainly in the fields of health and education.\n\nSince 2012, the Group has been supporting the ORA (Observer Relever Analyser - Observe Record Analyze) association through the supply of equipment. The objective of this project is to make a light aircraft available to research laboratories to support scientific work and to inspire young people. In June 2013, the aircraft was displayed at Le Bourget during the Paris Air Show.\n\nAround the world, Zodiac Aerospace's subsidiaries support local initiatives on education and health. For example, two Group entities (Zodiac Galley Inserts and Zodiac Oxygen Systems) gifted equipment to the ORBIS association in 2013; this was used to equip a hospital in an aircraft travelling in troubled countries to care for people with eye problems and to take the latest medical innovations to local doctors.\n"}

The memorial commemorates the Canadian First Division's participation in the Second Battle of Ypres of World War I which included fighting in the face of the first poison gas attacks along the Western Front. Frederick Chapman Clemesha's sculpture, \"the Brooding Soldier\", was selected to serve as the central feature of the monument following a design competition organized by the Canadian Battlefield Monument Commission in 1920.\n\nThe village of Saint Julien and a section of forested land called Saint Julien Wood was at a pronounced bend in the north east sector of the Ypres Salient prior to the Second Battle of Ypres. The area was also the junction between the British and French sectors of responsibility. The Canadian First Division was assigned the most northern section of the British line and to their left, the 45th (Algerian) Division held the southernmost end of the French line. The German Army had brought forward 168 tons of chlorine gas deployed in 5,730 cylinders buried in front of their trenches, opposite Langemark-Poelkapelle, north of Ypres. The Canadians, who had been moved into their positions only a few days earlier were manning the lines for several hundred metres along a front to the southwest of St. Julien when the German Army unleashed the first attack on the Western Front on 22 April 1915.\n\nPushed towards the Allied lines by a wind from the north, the initial gas attack largely drifted to the north and west of the Canadian lines, into the trenches of the French colonial troops of the French 45th (Algerian) and 87th (Territorial) Divisions, of 26th Reserve Corps. The gas drifted across positions largely held French colonial troops who broke ranks and abandoned their trenches after witnessing the early casualties, creating an 8,000 yard (7 km) gap in the Allied line. The German infantry were also wary of the gas and, lacking reinforcements, failed to exploit the break before the First Canadian Division and assorted French troops reformed the line in scattered, hastily prepared positions 1,000 to 3,000 yards apart. In actions at Kitcheners Wood, Mauser Ridge, Pilkem Ridge and Gravenstafel Ridge the Canadians held the line and prevented a German breakthrough until they were relieved by reinforcements on the 24 April.\n\nIn the 48 crucial hours that they held the line, 6,035 Canadians - or one man in every three who went into battle - became casualties; of that number, approximately 2,000 (or one man in every nine) were killed.\n\nAt the end of the war, The Imperial War Graves Commission granted Canada eight sites - five in France and three in Belgium - on which to erect memorials. Each site represented a significant Canadian engagement in the war and for this reason it was originally decided that each battlefield would be treated equally and graced with identical monuments. The Canadian Battlefields Memorials Commission was formed in November 1920 and decided a competition would be held to select the design of the memorial that would be used at the eight European sites. In October 1922, the submission of Toronto sculptor and designer Walter Seymour Allward was selected as the winner of the competition, and the submission of Frederick Chapman Clemesha placed second. The commission decided Allward's monumental design would be used at Vimy Ridge in France as it was the most dramatic location. Originally, Clemesha's 'Brooding Soldier' design was selected for the remaining sites but was later, for a number of reasons, erected only at Saint Julien in Belgium. The remaining six sites at Passchendaele, and Hill 62 in Belgium and Le Quesnel, Dury, Courcelette and Bourlon Wood in France each received an essentially identical Canadian granite block memorial marker, differentiated only with brief inscriptions that describe the battle they commemorate in English and French on their sides. The blocks are situated in small parks that vary in shape and design and are typically situated on key points of the battlefield they memorialize.\n\nThe memorial at Saint Julien was unveiled on 8 July 1923 by Prince Arthur, the Duke of Connaught and the tribute was made by French Marshal Ferdinand Foch, former Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers on the Western Front. In his address, Foch stated; \n\nAfter their completion in the mid-1920s, the sites became links in a chain of memorials that included 900+ Commonwealth cemeteries, making a road of remembrance or via dolorosa.\n\nThe memorial is found on the northern fringe of the village of Saint Julien at the intersection of the N313 road and Zonnebekestraat. During the war, the location where the memorial is located was known as Vancouver Corner. Visible for miles around, the memorial stands 11 metres tall. The 'Brooding Soldier' column rises from a low circular flagstone terrace and is sculpted at its top to form the bowed head and shoulders of a Canadian soldier. The soldier's hands resting are on the butt of his down-turned rifle in the 'arms reversed' position, a pose used as gesture of mourning and respect for the fallen performed at funerals and services of remembrance. Surrounding the column and central terrace are gardens of tall cedars trimmed into the shape of artillery shells and low cut cedars trimmed to look like shell explosions. Some of the soil that nourishes the gardens of the memorial was brought from various locations from across Canada to represent the broad spectrum of Canadian men who fought shoulder to shoulder on the battlefields of 1915.\n\nA replica of Clemesha's St-Julien monument was incorporated into the cenotaph designed by R. W. G. Heughan which was erected in Victoria Park, Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada in 1926.\n\n"}

Founded in 1899, it is the first children's museum in the United States – and according to some, the first one worldwide. It is unusual in its location in what is predominantly a residential area. Housed in a multi-level underground gallery, the museum underwent an expansion and renovation to double its space, reopened on September 20, 2008, and became the first green museum in New York City.\n\nThe museum's collection and exhibitions reflect its long history as well as the changes in children's educational needs over time and the changing environment. Its original focus was the presentation of natural science to children raised in an urban environment, but following World War II, technology and cultural awareness became more important. The underground gallery in which the museum was located following a 1975 move provided the ideal location for arranging evolving exhibits. The museum was not intended to solely attract the interest of a young audience, but rather to engage their minds from a young age. Children contribute extensively in the planning of museum exhibits, and have done so for a significant part of its history.\n\nThe Museum was founded following a proposal from the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences (now the Brooklyn Museum) on December 16, 1899 in the Adams House. The museum operated under the direction of the Brooklyn Institute and received approximately $70,000 in funds from New York City each year to supplement the donations it received. Attendance grew quickly, with monthly visitation exceeding 13,000 by October, 1905.\n\nIn 1929, the museum opened the Smith House annex. Eleanor Roosevelt attended the ceremony. In 1930, the Works Progress Administration supplied hundreds of workers to the museum, which thrived in the Great Depression. Among these workers was Ellis Credle, who painted murals before her career as an author began. By October 1930, monthly visitation had reached 60,000 and by 1939, the museum had received move than 9 million visitors since it opened 40 years prior.\nIn 1968 The Brooklyn Children's Museum opened MUSE, the Bedford LIncoln Neighborhood Museum.\nhttps://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/muse-photographs-8039\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/1968/05/28/archives/museum-beckons-please-do-touch-bedfordstuyvesant-youth-get-new.html\nIn 1975, the museum moved to an award-winning new space, housed underneath Brower Park at St Mark's and Brooklyn Avenues, following the demolition of the Victorian houses that served as its prior home. In 1996, the museum was once again renovated at a cost of $7 million to include miniature amphitheaters and a number of new galleries. Two years later, it became a part of Heart of Brooklyn, a cultural partnership established to promote tourism to Brooklyn.\n\nIn 2005, it was among 406 New York City arts and social service institutions to receive part of a $20 million grant from the Carnegie Corporation, which was made possible through a donation by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.\n\nIn the same year, work began on the $43 million expansion that was to nearly double the size of the museum, and handle more than 400,000 visitors each year. As part of its commitment to environmental integrity and energy efficiency, the institution has taken credit for being the first New York City museum to use geothermal wells for heating and cooling purposes.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/1968/05/28/archives/museum-beckons-please-do-touch-bedfordstuyvesant-youth-get-new.html\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/1964/03/23/archives/2-brooklyn-youths-tune-in-the-stars-on-radiotelescope.html\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/1964/08/10/archives/amateur-digging-pays-anthropological-dividends-students-finding.html\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/1972/06/18/archives/music-muse-set-to-jazz-up-its-exhibit.html\n\n\nhttps://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1962/02/22/80382198.html?pageNumber=23"}

Ryle introduced the phrase in \"The Concept of Mind\" (1949) to highlight the view of Descartes and others that mental and physical activity occur simultaneously but separately.\n\nGilbert Ryle (1900–76) was a philosopher who lectured at Oxford and made important contributions to the philosophy of mind and to \"ordinary language philosophy\". His most important writings include \"Philosophical Arguments\" (1945), \"The Concept of Mind\" (1949), \"Dilemmas\" (1954), \"Plato's Progress\" (1966), and \"On Thinking\" (1979).\n\nRyle's \"The Concept of Mind\" (1949) critiques the notion that the mind is distinct from the body and refers to the idea as \"the ghost in the machine\". According to Ryle, the classical theory of mind, or \"Cartesian rationalism\", makes a basic category mistake, because it attempts to analyze the relation between \"mind\" and \"body\" as if they were terms of the same logical category. This confusion of logical categories may be seen in other theories of the relation between mind and matter. For example, the idealist theory of mind makes a basic category mistake by attempting to reduce physical reality to the same status as mental reality, while the materialist theory of mind makes a basic category mistake by attempting to reduce mental reality to the same status as physical reality.\n\nRyle states that (as of the time of his writing, in 1949) there was an \"official doctrine,\" which he refers to as a dogma, of philosophers, the doctrine of body/mind dualism:\n\nThere is a doctrine about the nature and place of the mind which is prevalent among theorists, to which most philosophers, psychologists and religious teachers subscribe with minor reservations. Although they admit certain theoretical difficulties in it, they tend to assume that these can be overcome without serious modifications being made to the architecture of the theory... [the doctrine states that] with the doubtful exceptions of the mentally-incompetent and infants-in-arms, every human being has both a body and a mind. ... The body and the mind are ordinarily harnessed together, but after the death of the body the mind may continue to exist and function.\n\nRyle states that the central principles of the doctrine are unsound and conflict with the entire body of what we know about the mind. Of the doctrine, he says \"According to the official doctrine each person has direct and unchangeable cognisance. In consciousness, self-consciousness and introspection, he is directly and authentically apprised of the present states of operation of the mind.\n\nRyle's philosophical arguments in his essay \"Descartes' Myth\" lay out his notion of the mistaken foundations of mind-body dualism conceptions, suggesting that to speak of mind and body as substances, as a dualist does, is to commit a category mistake. Ryle writes:\n\nSuch in outline is the official theory. I shall often speak of it, with deliberate abusiveness, as \"the dogma of the Ghost in the Machine.\" I hope to prove that it is entirely false, and false not in detail but in principle. It is not merely an assemblage of particular mistakes. It is one big mistake and a mistake of a special kind. It is, namely, a category mistake. \n\nRyle then attempts to show that the \"official doctrine\" of mind/body dualism is false by asserting that it confuses two logical-types, or categories, as being compatible. He states \"it represents the facts of mental life as if they belonged to one logical type/category, when they actually belong to another. The dogma is therefore a philosopher's myth.\"\n\nArthur Koestler brought Ryle's concept to wider attention in his 1967 book \"The Ghost in the Machine\". The book's main focus is mankind's movement towards self-destruction, particularly in the nuclear arms arena. It is particularly critical of B. F. Skinner's behaviourist theory. One of the book's central concepts is that as the human brain has grown, it has built upon earlier, more primitive brain structures, and that this is the \"ghost in the machine\" of the title. Koestler's theory is that at times these structures can overpower higher logical functions, and are responsible for hate, anger and other such destructive impulses.\n\n\n"}

Women usually experience a painless gush or a steady leakage of fluid from the vagina. Complications in the baby may include premature birth, cord compression, and infection. Complications in the mother may include placental abruption and postpartum endometritis.\nRisk factors include infection of the amniotic fluid, prior PROM, bleeding in the later parts of pregnancy, smoking, and a mother who is underweight. Diagnosis is suspected based on symptoms and speculum exam and may be supported by testing the vaginal fluid or by ultrasound. If it occurs before 37 weeks it is known as preterm PROM otherwise it is known as term PROM.\nTreatment is based on how far along a woman is in pregnancy and whether complications are present. In those at or near term without any complications, induction of labor is generally recommended. Time may also be provided for labor to begin spontaneously. In those 24 to 34 weeks of gestation without complications corticosteroids and close observation is recommended. A 2017 Cochrane review found waiting generally resulted in better outcomes in those before 37 weeks. Antibiotics may be given for those at risk of \"Group B streptococcus\". Delivery is generally indicated in those with complications, regardless of how far along in pregnancy. \nAbout 8% of term pregnancies are complicated by PROM while about 30% of preterm births are complicated by PROM. Before 24 weeks PROM occurs in fewer than 1% of pregnancies. Prognosis is primarily determined by complications related to prematurity such as necrotizing enterocolitis, intraventricular hemorrhage, and cerebral palsy.\nMost women will experience a painless leakage of fluid out of the vagina. They may notice either a distinct \"gush\" or a steady flow of small amounts of watery fluid in the absence of steady uterine contractions. Loss of fluid may be associated with the baby becoming easier to feel through the belly (due to the loss of the surrounding fluid), decreased uterine size, or meconium (fetal stool) seen in the fluid.\n\nThe cause of PROM is not clearly understood, but the following are risk factors that increase the chance of it occurring. In many cases, however, no risk factor is identified.\n\nFetal membranes likely break because they become weak and fragile. This weakening is a normal process that typically happens at term as the body prepares for labor and delivery. However, this can be a problem when it occurs before 37 weeks (preterm). The natural weakening of fetal membranes is thought to be due to one or a combination of the following. In PROM, these processes are activated too early:\n\nInfection and inflammation likely explains why membranes break earlier than they are supposed to. In studies, bacteria have been found in the amniotic fluid from about one-third of cases of PROM. Often, testing of the amniotic fluid is normal, but a subclinical infection (too small to detect) or infection of maternal tissues adjacent to the amniotic fluid, may still be a contributing factor. In response to infection, the resultant infection and release of chemicals (cytokines) subsequently weakens the fetal membranes and put them at risk for rupture. PROM is also a risk factor in the development of neonatal infections.\n\nMany genes play a role in inflammation and collagen production, therefore inherited genes may play a role in predisposing a person to PROM.\n\nTo confirm if a woman has experienced PROM, a clinician must prove that the fluid leaking from the vagina is amniotic fluid, and that labor has not yet started. To do this, a careful medical history is taken, a gynecological exam is conducted using a sterile speculum, and an ultrasound of the uterus is performed. \n\n\nThe following tests should only be used if the diagnosis is still unclear after the standard tests above. \n\nIt is unclear if different methods of assessing the fetus in a woman with PPROM affects outcomes.\n\nLike amniotic fluid, blood, semen, vaginal secretions in the presence of infection, soap, urine, and cervical mucus also have an alkaline pH and can also turn nitrazine paper blue. Cervical mucus can also make a pattern similar to ferning on a microscope slide, but it is usually patchy and with less branching.\n\nOther conditions that may present similarly to premature rupture of membranes are the following:\n\nWomen who have had PROM are more likely to experience it in future pregnancies. There is not enough data to recommend a way to specifically prevent future PROM. However, any woman that has had a history of preterm delivery, because of PROM or not, is recommended to take progesterone supplementation to prevent recurrence.\n\nThe management of PROM remains controversial, and depends largely on the gestational age of the fetus and other complicating factors. The risks of quick delivery (induction of labor) vs. watchful waiting in each case is carefully considered before deciding on a course of action.\n\nAs of 2012, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists advised, based on expert opinion and not clinical evidence, that attempted delivery during maternal instability increases the rates of both fetal death and maternal death, unless the source of instability is an intrauterine infection.\n\nIn all women with PROM, the age of the fetus, its position in the uterus, and its well being should be evaluated. This can be done with ultrasound, Doppler fetal heart rate monitoring, and uterine activity monitoring. This will also show whether or not uterine contractions are happening which may be a sign that labor is starting. Signs and symptoms of infection should be closely monitored, and, if not already done, a group B streptococcus (GBS) culture should be collected.\n\nAt any age, if the fetal well-being appears to be compromised, or if intrauterine infection is suspected, the baby should be delivered quickly by induction of labour.\n\nBoth expectant management (watchful waiting) and an induction of labor (artificially stimulating labor) are considered in this case. 90% of women start labor on their own within 24 hours, and therefore it is reasonable to wait for 12–24 hours as long as there is no risk of infection. However, if labor does not begin soon after the PROM, an induction of labor is recommended because it reduces rates of infections, decreases the chances that the baby will require a stay in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and does not increase the rate of caesarean sections. If a woman strongly does not want to be induced, watchful waiting is an acceptable option as long as there is no sign of infection, the fetus is not in distress, and she is aware and accepts the risks of PPROM. There is not enough data to show that the use of prophylactic antibiotics (to prevent infection) is beneficial for mothers or babies at or near term because of the potential side effects and development of antibiotic resistance.\n\nWhen the fetus is 34 to 37 weeks gestation, the risk of being born prematurely must be weighed against the risk of PROM. Previously it was recommended that delivery be carried out as if the baby was term. A 2017 Cochrane review however found waiting resulted in better outcomes when pregnancy is before 37 weeks.\n\nBefore 34 weeks, the fetus is at a much higher risk of the complications of prematurity. Therefore, as long as the fetus is doing well, and there are no signs of infection or placental abruption, watchful waiting (expectant management) is recommended. The younger the fetus, the longer it takes for labor to start on its own, but most women will deliver within a week. Waiting usually requires a woman to stay in the hospital so that health care providers can watch her carefully for infection, placental abruption, umbilical cord compression, or any other fetal emergency that would require quick delivery by induction of labor.\n\nIn 2017, a review of watchful waiting vs the early birth strategy was conducted to ascertain which was associated with a lower overall risk. Focusing on the 24–37-week range, the review analysed twelve randomised controlled trials from the \"Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register\", concluding that \"In women with PPROM before 37 weeks' gestation with no contraindications to continuing the pregnancy, a policy of expectant management with careful monitoring was associated with better outcomes for the mother and baby.\" \n\nThere is believed to be a correlation between volume of amniotic fluid retained and neonatal outcomes before 26 weeks' gestation. Amniotic fluid levels are an important consideration when debating expectant management vs clinical intervention, as low levels, or oligohydramnios, can result in lung and limb abnormalities. Additionally, labor and infection are less likely to occur when there are sufficient levels of amniotic fluid remaining in the uterus. Serial amnioinfusion in pregnancies with PPROM-related oligohydramnios at less than 26 weeks gestation, successfully alleviates oligohydramnios, with perinatal outcomes that are significantly better than the outcome in those with the persistent condition and is comparable with gestations with PPROM in which oligohydramnios never develops.\n\n\n\nBefore 24 weeks, a fetus is not viable meaning it cannot live outside the mother. In this case, either watchful waiting at home or an induction of labor done.\n\nBecause the risk of infection is so high, the mother should check her temperature often and return to the hospital if she develops any signs or symptoms of infection, labor, or vaginal bleeding. These women are typically admitted to the hospital once their fetus reaches 24 weeks and then managed the same as women with PPROM before 34 weeks (discussed above). When possible, these deliveries should take place in a hospital that has expertise in the management of the potential maternal and neonatal complications, and has the necessary infrastructure in place to support the care of these patients (i.e. neonatal intensive care unit). Antenatal corticosteroids, latency antibiotics, magnesium sulfate, and tocolytic medications are not recommended until the fetus reaches viability (24 weeks). In cases of pre-viable PPROM, chance of survival of the fetus is between 15–50%, and the risk of chorioamnionitis is about 30%.\n\nChorioamnionitis is a bacterial infection of the fetal membranes, which can be life-threatening to both mother and fetus. Women with PROM at any age are at high risk of infection because the membranes are open and allow bacteria to enter. Women are checked often (usually every 4 hours) for signs of infection: fever (more than 38 °C or 100.5 °F), uterine pain, maternal tachycardia, fetal tachycardia, or foul-smelling amniotic fluid. Elevated white blood cells are not a good way to predict infection because they are normally high in labor. If infection is suspected, artificial induction of labor is started at any gestational age and broad antibiotics are given. Caesarean section should not be automatically done in cases of infection, and should only be reserved for the usual fetal emergencies.\n\nThe consequences of PROM depend on the gestational age of the fetus. When PROM occurs at term (after 36 weeks), it is typically followed soon thereafter by the start of labor and delivery. About half of women will give birth within 5 hours, and 95% will give birth within 28 hours without any intervention. The younger the baby, the longer the latency period (time between membrane rupture and start of labor). Rarely, in cases of preterm PROM, amniotic fluid will stop leaking and the amniotic fluid volume will return to normal.\n\nIf PROM occurs before 37 weeks, it is called preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM), and the baby and mother are at greater risk of complications. PPROM causes one-third of all preterm births. PROM provides a path for disease-causing organisms to enter the womb and puts both the mother and baby at risk for infection. Low levels of fluid around the baby also increase the risk of umbilical cord compression and can interfere with lung and body formation of the baby in early pregnancy.\n\nAt any gestational age, an opening in the fetal membranes provides a route for bacteria to enter the womb. This can lead to chorioamnionitis (an infection of the fetal membranes and amniotic fluid) which can be life-threatening to both the mother and fetus. The risk of infection increases the longer the membranes remain open and baby undelivered. Women with preterm PROM will develop an intra-amniotic infection 15–25% of the time, and the chances of infection increase at earlier gestational ages.\n\nPROM occurring before 37 weeks (PPROM) is one of the leading causes of preterm birth. Thirty to 35% of all preterm births are caused by PPROM. This puts the fetus at risk for the many complications associated with prematurity such as respiratory distress, brain bleeds, infection, necrotizing enterocolitis (death of the fetal bowels), brain injury, muscle dysfunction, and death. Prematurity from any cause leads to 75% of perinatal mortality and about 50% of all long-term morbidity. PROM is responsible for 20% of all fetal deaths between 24 and 34 weeks' gestation.\n\nBefore 24 weeks the fetus is still developing its organs, and the amniotic fluid is important for protecting the fetus against infection, physical impact, and for preventing the umbilical cord from becoming compressed. It also allows for fetal movement and breathing that is necessary for the development of the lungs, chest, and bones. Low levels of amniotic fluid due to mid-trimester or previable PPROM (before 24 weeks) can result in fetal deformity (e.g. Potter-like facies), limb contractures, pulmonary hypoplasia (underdeveloped lungs), infection (especially if the mother is colonized by group B streptococcus or bacterial vaginosis), prolapsed umbilical cord or compression, and placental abruption.\n\nMost cases of PROM occur spontaneously, but the risk of PROM in women undergoing a second trimester amniocentesis for prenatal diagnosis of genetic disorders is 1%. Although, no studies are known to account for all cases of PROM that stem from amniocentesis. This case, the chances of the membranes healing on their own and the amniotic fluid returning to normal levels is much higher than spontaneous PROM. Compared to spontaneous PROM, about 70% of women will have normal amniotic fluid levels within one month, and about 90% of babies will survive.\n\nOf term pregnancies (more than 37 weeks) about 8% are complicated by PROM, 20% of these become prolonged PROM. About 30% of all preterm deliveries (before 37 weeks) are complicated by PPROM, and rupture of membranes before viability (before 24 weeks) occurs in less than 1% of all pregnancies. Since there are significantly fewer preterm deliveries than term deliveries, the number of PPROM cases make up only about 5% of all cases of PROM.\n\n"}

It is an industrial area with textile, metallurgical, and glass industries. The houses of Manresa are arranged around the basilica of Santa Maria de la Seu. Saint Ignatius of Loyola stopped to pray in the town on his way back from Montserrat in 1522. He also read in solitude in a cave near the town for a year, which contributed to the formulation of his Spiritual Exercises. As such, the town is a place of pilgrimage for Catholics.\n\nIt is believed the comarcal name \"Bages\" comes from a corruption of the Latin \"Bacchus\" due to the extensive production of wine in the area. The wine was grown mainly in terraced vineyards, and many of these old terraces can be seen today. Wine ceased to be the main product of the area as a consequence of phylloxera, but is still a very important part of the Manresa/Bages economy.\n\nDuring the Napoleonic invasion, the volunteer troops of Manresa (\"sometent\" in Catalan language) defeated the French troops in the Bruch Pass (June 1808), but the retreating French burned and demolished much of the town. After the expulsion of Napoleon's troops, Manresans rebuilt the town using the rubble.\n\n\nIn the 12th century Manresa was said to have contained 500 Jewish families, most of whom lived in a narrow lane called \"Grau dels Jueus,\" near the town hall; their cemetery, still called \"Fossana dels Jueus,\" was outside the city. In the 13th and 14th centuries the Jews there were engaged in manufacturing, trading, money-lending, and in the cultivation of their vineyards and estates.\n\nThe hostility of the Christians towards the Jews, which prevailed throughout Catalonia, was also manifested in Manresa. In 1325 the Christian inhabitants of the town tried to prevent the Jews from baking their Passover bread, so that the latter were obliged to appeal to the King for protection. The Jews in Manresa did not escape the general persecution of 1391, and many of them professed to accept Christianity.\n\nAfter 1414 comparatively few Jews remained in the town, and in 1492 they sold their property for whatever they could get, and left the country. At the beginning of the 15th century Manresa had 30,000 inhabitants; three centuries later it contained barely one-fifth of that number. Several members of the Zabarra (Sabara) family lived in Manresa. The town is not mentioned in the \"Shebeṭ Yehudah.\" \n\nManresa has a humid subtropical (Köppen \"Cfa\"), with cold winters and hot, moderately dry summers, while the rainiest seasons are spring and autumn.\n\nThree bridges cross the Cardener River. The 14th-century basilica of Santa Maria de la Seu stands on a rock above the oldest bridge. La Seu is the principal monument of Manresa. The church we can see today was designed by Berenguer de Montagut who also designed Santa Maria del Mar, Barcelona .The architectural style is characteristic of Catalan Gothic. The work began in 1325, but the church was not finished until the end of the 15th century. The municipal museum is housed in the cloisters of the 17th-century church of Sant Ignasi. This church is part of the Sanctuary Cave of Saint Ignatius (in Catalan \"Cova de Sant Ignasi\"), built over a cave in which Saint Ignatius of Loyola is said to have prayed and meditated.\n\nIndustry in the town covers textile-making, metallurgy, and glass manufacture.\n\nThe Fira Mediterrania in Manresa is held the first complete weekend in November every year. It is the main meeting point and trade fair of the mediterranean world, folk and roots artists with distributors, organisers, agencies, labels, export offices, instrument makers and dealers, journalists and other professionals.\n\nThe original building dates back to the 19th century.\n\nRemodeling was agreed to be needed due to the old building's impractical use in Modern times. At the end of 2004, a competition was held to remodel the building with the aim of easing its disabled circulation.\n\nThe Barcelona-based Add + Arquitectura was selected and the project was completed in 2008. Add partners Manuel Bailo and Rosa Rull were responsible for the design. Bailo and Rull's key move was to partly demolish and extend the rear south-west wall of the town hall in order to implant a new circulation core\n\nThe front of the building maintained its traditional structure but at the rear of the building, the elevator and staircase are encased in a \"cubist cacoon\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttribution\n\n"}

He was the bass guitarist for the Kinks from 1978 until they disbanded in 1997. In 2004, he joined the reunited Zombies, whom he had been closely associated with since the early 1960s, and remained a member until his death in 2018. He was also a member of the Swinging Blue Jeans and the Kast Off Kinks.\n\nRodford was born on 7 July 1941, in St Albans, Hertfordshire, England. In the late 1950s and early 1960s he was a member of the Bluetones, the biggest band in St Albans at the time. Although he did not become a band member at this stage, Rodford was instrumental in helping his younger cousin Rod Argent form the Zombies in 1964. Rodford later joined the Mike Cotton Sound as a bass guitarist.\n\nAlong with Rod Argent, Rodford was one of the founding members of Argent.

Eventually, Rodford joined the Kinks as a bass guitarist in 1978 and played with them until their final disintegration in 1997.\n\nFrom 1999–2001 Rodford appeared in a band that ex-Animals guitarist Hilton Valentine formed, the Animals II, which also featured former Animals drummer John Steel, and keyboardist Dave Rowberry. Rodford continued with this band (which changed its working name to \"The Animals and Friends\" after Valentine left) until joining Argent and Colin Blunstone in the revival of the Zombies.\n\nRodford never played with the Zombies in the 1960s, despite having been closely involved with them. However, he began to play the bass guitar with the band's reincarnation in the early years of the 21st century, with his son Steve on drums.\n\nIn 2008, Rodford joined the Kast Off Kinks, on the retirement of John Dalton, whom he had followed into the Kinks after Andy Pyle. In 2009, Jim Rodford regularly played in \"The Rodford Files\" along with his sons Steve Rodford (Blunstone/Argent band) on drums and Russ Rodford on guitar, plus Derik Timms (mOOn Dogs) on guitar, lap steel, slide and vocals.\n\nIn 2010, the original line-up of Argent reformed and resumed playing in concert. They mounted a short tour including gigs in Frome, Southampton, Wolverhampton, Leamington Spa and London.\n\nOn 20 January 2018, Rodford died after he fell down stairs at his home in St Albans.\n\nRodford met his wife, Jean, at the Pioneer Club, St Albans, in the early days of his music career. They have two sons, Steve, a drummer, Russell a guitarist and a daughter, Paula. Rodford died after a fall on 20 January 2018, at the age of 76, a few days after returning from America where he had played a few gigs with The Zombies.

He served as Ambassador to the United States and then as Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance.

Ultimately, this appointment went to Jamshid Amouzegar, and Ansary became the leader of the Constructionist wing of the Rastakhiz party, which opposed Amouzegar's Progressive wing. Some of Ansary's supporters have seen Amouzegar's appointment as a poor decision in hindsight. Even his now ex-wife Maryam Panahi, to whom his marriage \"came to a bitter end\" according to historian Abbas Milani, has said that \"not appointing Hushang was one of the shah's two biggest mistakes, leading to the revolution.\" In November 1977, Ansary became the director of the National Iranian Oil Company, but resigned one year later and moved to the United States, citing health problems.\n\nDuring his time in the Iranian government, Ansary also maintained a successful career in business. He was the director of an unstable company called Fakhre Iran, which he made profitable and sold to the government. Ansary arrived in the U.S. a very wealthy man and became a U.S. citizen in 1986. After settling in the United States, Ansary started the Parman Group, a holding company for leisure industries, textiles, international trade, and real estate, which included IRI International - a company that makes oilfield equipment. IRI International was sold to National Oilwell Varco in 2005. Ansary was the chairman of Stewart & Stevenson LLC until the company was purchased by Kirby Corp in September 2018.\n\nIn recent years Ansari and Parman have come under scrutiny of the Central Bank of Curaçao and Sint Maarten (CBCS) with regard to financial misappropriations regarding an insurance company operating in the Dutch Caribbean islands of Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten. The CBCS has stated that under shareholder Parman International B.V., in which Ansary is a majority shareholder, ENNIA Caribe Holding and ENNIA Caribe Investments had appropriated 1,5 billion Antillean guilders (approximately $838 million) from ENNIA insurance companies. These insurance companies operate on the islands of Curaçao and Sint Maarten and therefore fall under the supervision of the CBCS. According to the CBCS, the appropriation took place by having the insurance companies invest in shares in another Parman subsidiary, Stewart & Stevenson Inc. When these shares were sold in 2017, although the insurance companies had held 74% of the shares and should have received $558.7 million, they only received $282.2 million and thus lost approximately $273 million. In another transaction, land at Mullet Bay (sint Maarten) was put in the books of the insurance company for 771 million guilders (just under $431 million) although according to Cushman & Wakefield, one of the largest appraisers in the world, the value is only 89 million guilders ($49 million). In August 2018, after negotiations between CBCS and ENNIA and major shareholder Husang Ansary collapsed, Ansary gave instructions to withdraw $100 million in policyholders money from ENNIA. After CBCS placed ENNIA under an emergency measure, the $100 million was returned to ENNIA. The CBCS notes, however, that $50 million came from a private account of Ansary. On January 29, 2019, a United States Bankruptcy Court declared CBCS is entitled to the accounts since based on the emergency measure, CBCS, and not Parman, is effectively managing ENNIA. The accounts had been frozen because Parman and its major shareholder Ansary did not want to confirm that the CBCS is entitled to the accounts. According to the CBCS, the procedures of Parman and Ansary delay the restructuring process of ENNIA, which increases the risk of its policy holders.\n\nAnsary is a devoted Republican, a former friend and business partner of Henry Kissinger, Alexander Haig, and James Baker, served on the National Finance Committee of the Bush-Cheney 2004 Presidential Campaign and is a trustee of the George W. Bush Presidential Library. In 2015, Ansary and his wife donated $2 million to a Super PAC supporting the presidential candidacy of Jeb Bush.\n\nHe was involved in the creation of several medical and educational institutions, such as the University of St. Martin and the James Baker Institute. In February 2014, Ansary supported the \"A Thousand Years of the Persian Book\" Exhibition at the Library of Congress.\n\nAnsary and his wife Shahla are based in Houston, Texas. He has two children, Nina and Nader, and is the brother of Cyrus A. Ansary.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2283425", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2283425", "title": "Thomas C. Mann", "text": "Thomas C. Mann\n\nThomas Clifton Mann (November 11, 1912 – January 23, 1999) was an American diplomat who specialized in Latin American affairs. He entered the U.S. Department of State in 1942 and quickly rose through the ranks to become an influential establishment figure. He worked to influence the internal affairs of numerous Latin American nations, typically focusing on economic and political influence rather than direct military intervention. After Lyndon B. Johnson became President in 1963, Mann received a double appointment and was recognized as the U.S. authority on Latin America. In March 1964, Mann outlined a policy of supporting regime change and promoting the economic interests of U.S. businesses. This policy, which moved away from the political centrism of Kennedy's Alliance for Progress, has been called the Mann Doctrine. Mann left the State Department in 1966 and became a spokesperson for the Automobile Manufacturer's Association.\n\nBorn in Laredo, an American city on the border with Mexico, Mann grew up speaking English and Spanish. His father was a lawyer and a Southern Baptist.\n\nHe attended Baylor University and Baylor Law School, both in Waco, Texas, where he met his wife, the former Nancy Aynesworth. He graduated from law school in 1934 and took a job at his father's law firm. He held various posts, as a lawyer in Laredo, in 1934 to 1942.\n\nMann was rejected from the Navy due to poor vision. He joined the Diplomatic Service, United States Department Of State in 1942, and was deployed to Montevideo in Uruguay to investigate Nazi shipping. In 1943, he was promoted to do this job across Latin America. He was involved in creating the 1945 Act of Chapultepec treaty for mutual defense of trans-American nations.\n\nAfter unsuccessfully coordinating US opposition to Juan Perón in the 1946 Argentine election, he directed US diplomats in Latin America to avoid supporting particular candidates in elections—lest they suffer due to the perceived association. He commented during the 1950 Guatemalan election:\n\nAt election time it is just political suicide to try to defend the United States... I think on the whole people in the other American Republics understand and support us, but it isn't good politics to say so at election time. We are a sort of punching bag during elections. Everybody likes to take a swing at us, and makes sure he does every time you say something.\n\nMann sought military assistance from Latin American countries during the Korean War, commenting \"that if the Bolivians were complaining about spilling their blood for Yankees, a lot of Yankees were also complaining about American blood already being spilled in Korea for Bolivia and other countries of the hemisphere\".\n\nMann believed that nationalism and Communism were related problems, and sought to prevent both as part of efforts to prevent Latin nationalization of resources. In a surprise to many observers, he agreed to secure US aid for Bolivia following the 1952 Bolivian revolution, partly as a reward for the new government's agreement to compensate US tin companies for nationalized assets.\n\nIn 1952, Mann welcomed the incoming Eisenhower administration with a 42-page memo on US relations with Latin America. The memo argued that the main issue for the US in this region was not a Communist invasion, but the problem of US control over \"readily accessible essential strategic materials\". These included vanadium as well as crude petroleum, resources which the US imported mostly from Latin America. Mann advocated swift US intervention to retaliate against nationalizations, as a show of force to deter similar actions by other countries. This memo was a source for NSC 144/1, representing the incoming Eisenhower administration's new policy on Latin America.\n\nIn Guatemala, Mann attended the inauguration of President Jacobo Árbenz Guzmán and pronounced him a communist. Although he resisted early overtures by United Fruit representatives to intervene, he opposed Árbenz's land reform law, fearing that Guatemala would provide a test case for other nations. After the CIA-backed military coup in 1954, Mann was recalled from Greece to Guatemala. He established Norman Armour as the US ambassador and sought to bolster the new military government of Castillo Armas. Mann reportedly gained de facto veto power over Guatemalan policy; after Mann had rejected a new oil law, Armas said he would come to \"no final decision without consulting with Mr. Mann.\"\n\nMann later reflected that US operatives in Guatemala had an \"illusion of omnipotence\", saying in 1975:\n\nWe were on the crest of a wave and nobody, literally nobody on the Hill or anywhere else ever questioned our ability to do anything if we wanted to do it [and] if we were willing to spend the money and the effort to do it.\n\nIn late September 1957 Mann moved to Washington, D.C., to become Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs. Trans-American economic problems had created dissatisfaction and threatened to push Latin American countries away from the US. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles blamed an \"economic war\" waged by Moscow. Vice President Richard Nixon was mobbed by angry protestors in Venezuela and elsewhere. Mann advocated policies of robust economic assistance, establishing the Inter-American Development Bank and promoting low-interest loans financed by the US government. Mann pushed for \"a Marshall Plan for Latin America\" which would also include private finance. Eisenhower concurred, and appointed Mann as Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs in August 1960.\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy promoted the Alliance for Progress, a centrist initiative to support Latin American economies and stave off communism through moderate reform.\n\nMann did not support the Bay of Pigs invasion, which had been planned by the CIA before Kennedy took office. He doubted the possibility of a popular uprising and, with Kennedy, opposed involvement by the US Air Force. He resigned his position at the State Department just weeks before the invasion took place in April 1961. In general, Mann felt that military action against Cuba would be too damaging for the US image. Instead, he supported economic sanctions to create suffering and dissatisfaction among the Cuban poor.\n\nKennedy appointed Mann United States Ambassador to Mexico where he successfully negotiated a settlement of the Chamizal border between the US and Mexican governments, caused by a shift in the Rio Grande.\n\nOn December 14, 1963, new President Lyndon B. Johnson re-appointed Mann Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs. On December 21, Johnson also made Mann the head of the US Agency for International Development (USAID), an organization created by President Kennedy two years earlier. The double-appointment was opposed by the Kennedys and their liberal supporters, including Senator Hubert Humphrey and advisor Arthur Schlesinger Jr.. Schlesinger wrote that Johnson's appointment of Mann constituted \"a declaration of independence, even perhaps a declaration of aggression against the Kennedys.\" Members of the United States corporate establishment, generally felt they had a good relationship with Mann and supported the appointment.\n\nIn March 1964, the new Johnson administration held a three-day policy conference for all U.S. diplomats in Latin America. On March 18, Mann gave a secret speech to U.S. officials which laid out the administration's policy for the region. Mann did not discuss the Alliance for Progress. His policy called for non-intervention against dictators if they were friendly to US business interests, but intervention against Communists regardless of their policies. The content of Mann's speech was leaked to the \"New York Times\". His comments were interpreted as prioritizing US economic interests over political reform, and the thrust of this policy became known as the \"Mann Doctrine\".\n\nLater that month, Mann supported the military overthrow of the democratically elected government in Brazil, claiming a victory against Communism. Mann assisted this takeover directly by diverting US aid to Brazil away from the Goulart's central government. US operatives interpreted the March 18 Mann Doctrine as a \"green light\" for the coup to go forward. After the coup, Mann stated that \"the frustration of Communistic objectives in Brazil was the single most important victory for freedom in the hemisphere in recent years\".\n\nIn Chile, Mann ordered an intensive and coordinated campaign in favor of Eduardo Frei against Salvador Allende in the 1964 elections. In a May 1 memo to Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Mann wrote:\n\nClearly, the September election will be determined by factors which are deeply rooted in the political, economic, and social fabric of the Chilean scene and by the campaign abilities of the major contenders. Given the consequences, however, if this major Latin American nation should become the first country in the hemisphere to freely choose an avowed Marxist as its elected president, the Department, CIA, and other agencies have embarked on a major campaign to prevent Allende's election and to support Frei, the only candidate who has a chance of beating him.\n\nMann described a ten-point plan, which included:\n\nThese efforts were successful in 1964 but reversed in 1970.\n\nIn Bolivia, when General René Barrientos Ortuño led a takeover of the popular Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR) government, which had been in power for twelve years, Mann secured aid for the new military government.\n\nMann later served in Panama during a period of intense agitation waged by Panamanians against the Panama Canal Zone. Mann began some successful negotiations with Panama, but was undercut by Johnson, who did not want to capitulate for political reasons.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, Mann labeled democratically elected President Juan Bosch a communist and supported the US invasion in 1965. In April 1965, Mann personally insisted on the production of a cable which would describe danger to American citizens in the Dominican Republic. At the same time, Mann pressured the military government to crack down on insurgents in Santo Domingo. Mann described the popular rebellion as Communist infiltration enabled by Castro and supported the U.S. invasion as a necessary response.\n\nMann became the Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs in 1965. He resigned from the State Department in 1966 and served as President of the Automobile Manufacturer's Association from 1967 through 1971.\n\nMann was a brother of the late Laredo attorney Samuel Edward \"Ed\" Mann, a 1923 graduate of the University of Texas Law School and an inductee into the prestigious legal honor society, Crossroads . He died on January 23, 1999 in Lubbock, Texas.\n\nMann Road in Laredo is named for the Mann family. Thomas Mann is interred at Laredo City Cemetery.\n\n\n\n"}

He currently runs his own team, Bryan Herta Autosport in the NTT IndyCar Series. His team won the 2011 Indianapolis 500 with driver Dan Wheldon and the 2016 Indianapolis 500 with driver Alexander Rossi. He is the father of IndyCar Series driver Colton Herta.\n\nHerta enjoyed considerable success in the lower formulae, winning the Barber Formula Ford and Barber Saab Pro Series, and dominating the 1993 Indy Lights championship with Tasman Motorsports.\n\nHe graduated to IndyCar racing in 1994 with team owner A. J. Foyt, where he had several promising races before suffering a season-ending injury at Toronto.\n\nIn 1995, Herta was hired to drive for Chip Ganassi Racing. Despite a pole at Phoenix, the association was unsuccessful, with Herta managing only a 20th place in the series standings while his teammate Jimmy Vasser finished 8th. Even so, Herta landed a top ride with Team Rahal for the 1996 season.\n\nDuring the next few years, Herta developed a reputation for his prowess on road courses, especially at Laguna Seca Raceway. In 1996, he was the leader until the last lap, when Alex Zanardi made the spectacular pass through the \"Corkscrew\" chicane and took the victory. Herta, who rarely qualified below the first row at Laguna Seca, finally won two events on the twisty road course in 1998 and 1999. At the height of Herta's career, fan interest in the Shell-sponsored driver was dubbed by team owner David Letterman as \"Hertamania.\"\n\nIn the opening laps of the 1998 event at Elkhart Lake, Wisconsin's Road America circuit, Herta was involved in one of the scariest incidents in the history of North American motor racing. In the road course's fifth turn, Herta got too close to the back of the car of co-owner Rahal, and spun out into a paved runoff area, facing oncoming traffic. A few seconds later, an ESPN camera that had zoomed in on Herta's head pulled back when Herta clenched his fists and put them against the sides of his head. As course workers scattered, Alex Barron slid into the front of Herta's car and rode up on top of it. Both drivers were okay. Herta reported that Barron's car had actually hit his hands, only inches from his face.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2003, Herta drove for a variety of Champ Car teams including Forsythe Championship Racing, Mo Nunn Racing, and PK Racing, but never quite regained his form from the late 1990s. In 2002 Herta drove an F1 car for the first time, piloting a Minardi at the \"Thunder in the Park\" event held at Donington Park. This led to speculation that he would test and even race for Minardi in F1, however this never happened.\n\nAfter dabbling in sports cars, he revitalized his open-wheel racing career by substituting for an injured Dario Franchitti halfway through the 2003 IRL season.\n\nIn just his third IRL start, Herta picked up his first IndyCar Series win at Kansas Speedway for Andretti Green Racing. He was retained in an expanded four-car squad in 2004, usually running development engines. On July 31, 2005, Herta took his second IndyCar Series win, defeating AGR teammate Dan Wheldon in a close finish in the Firestone Indy 400 at the Michigan International Speedway.\n\nIn early 2006, he drove at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca and Fundidora Park for A1 Team USA in the A1 Grand Prix series before returning to Andretti Green for the IRL season.\n\nAs of 2006, Herta has started in the Indianapolis 500 five times (1994–1995, 2004–2006) with three top ten finishes, including a best of 3rd in 2005. Bryan has his helmets painted by AliveDesignCo.com\n\nOn October 31, 2006, Herta was confirmed as a driver for Andretti Green Racing's new Acura Le Mans prototype program for the 2007 American Le Mans Series season. He shared the car with Marino Franchitti, brother of his former teammate Dario Franchitti. On January 3, 2007, it was announced that Dario would also drive a limited ALMS programme with both Marino and Herta. Herta finished the season 7th in driver points with 1 class win. He also drove for A1 Team USA. At the event in Australia, Herta scored a 10th-place finish.\n\nSince retiring from racing, Herta served as a driver coach for Vision Racing and founded a Firestone Indy Lights Series team named Bryan Herta Autosport, which has a technical alliance with Vision Racing's Indy Lights team. In 2009, the team fielded a full-time entry for Daniel Herrington. The team campaigned Sebastian Saavedra for eleven races of the 2010 Firestone Indy Lights season and the Indianapolis 500. In 2011 the team fielded a car for Dan Wheldon in the 2011 Indianapolis 500 which resulted in a stunning victory, and a full-time entry in Indy Lights for Duarte Ferreira.\n\nFor the 2012 IZOD IndyCar Series season, Alex Tagliani ran the 500. The team switched to a Honda powered DW12 in May 2012 for the remainder of the season.\n\nIn 2016 Herta partnered with Michael Andretti as a co-owner and won the 2016 Indianapolis 500. Their car was driven by series rookie Alexander Rossi.\n\nHerta's son, Colton, is also a racing driver, and made his IndyCar debut in 2019 with Harding Steinbrenner Racing. In March 2019, Colton became the youngest ever IndyCar winner in the second round at the Circuit of the Americas.\n\nHerta has two children with his wife Janette, Colton and Calysta.\n\n2 wins, Best championship result: 8th\n\n2 wins, best championship result: 8th\n\n"}
{"id": "2283441", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2283441", "title": "Karamojong people", "text": "Karamojong people\n\nThe Karamojong or Karimojong are a Nilotic ethnic group.They are agro-pastoral herders living mainly in the north-east of Uganda. Their language is also known as Karamojong or Karimojong and is part of the Nilotic language family.\n\nThe Karamojong live in the southern part of the region in the north-east of Uganda, occupying an area equivalent to one tenth of the country. According to anthropologists, the Karamojong are part of a group that migrated from present-day Ethiopia around 1600 A.D. and split into two branches, with one branch moving to present day Kenya to form the Kalenjin group and Maasai cluster. The other branch, called Ateker, migrated westwards. Ateker further split into several groups, including Turkana in present-day Kenya, Iteso, Dodoth, Jie, Karamojong, and Kumam in present-day Uganda, also Jiye and Toposa in southern Sudan all of them together now known as the \"Teso Cluster\" or \"Karamojong Cluster\".\n\nIt is said that the Karamojong were originally known as the Jie. The name Karamojong derived from phrase \"ekar ngimojong\", meaning \"the old men can walk no farther\". According to tradition, the peoples now known as the Karamojong Cluster or Teso Cluster are said to have migrated from Abyssinia between the 1600 and 1700 AD as a single group. When they reached the area around the modern Kenyan-Ethiopian border, they are said to have fragmented into several groups including those that became Turkana, Toposa, and the Dodoth. The group that became known as the Toposa continued to present day southern Sudan; the Dodoth, settled in Apule in the northern part of present-day Karamoja. The Turkana settled in Kenya where they are now and today's Jie of Uganda are thought to have split from them, moving up the escarpment into today's Kotido District. The main body continued southwards, reportedly consisting of seven groups or clans who settled in today's southern Karamoja, eventually merging to become the three clans now existing: the Matheniko in the east around Moroto mountain, the Pian in the south and the Bokora in the west. However, a significant sized group went west and formed the Iteso, the Kumam, and the Langi. It was this group who were said to have used the phrase \"the old men can walk no farther\".\n\nRelated to Turkana: in the Karamojong language, the people and the language have the convenient prefixes ŋi- and ŋa- respectively. Lack of a prefix indicates the land where they live. All the above-mentioned branches from Ateker speak languages that are mutually intelligible. (The Lango in Uganda are also ethnically and genetically close to the ŋiKarimojong, evidenced by similar names among other things, though they adopted a dialect of the Luo language).\n\nThe main livelihood activity of the Karamojong is herding livestock, which has social and cultural importance. Crop cultivation is a secondary activity, undertaken only in areas where it is practicable.\n\nDue to the arid climate of the region, the Karamojong have always practised a sort of pastoral transhumance, where for 3–4 months in a year, they move their livestock to the neighboring districts in search of water and pasture for their animals.\n\nThe availability of food and water is always a concern and affects the Karamojong's interaction with other ethnic groups.\n\nThe dominant feature of Karamojong society is their age system, which is strictly based on generation. As successive generations have an increasing overlap in age, this leads logically to a breakdown of the system, which appears to have occurred after rules were relaxed in the nineteenth century among their close neighbours, the Jie. However, the Karamojong system is flexible enough to contain a build-up of tension between generations over a cycle of 50 years or so. When this can no longer be resolved peacefully, the breakdown in order leads to a switch in power from the ruling generation to their successors and a new status quo. The next changeover is expected around 2013. [Dyson-Hudson, Neville (1966), \"Karimojong Politics\", Clarendon Press, Oxford.\nSpencer, Paul (1998), \"The Pastoral Continuum: The Marginalization of Tradition in East Africa\", Clarendon Press, Oxford (pp. 99–119).]\n\nAs both a rite of passage into manhood, as well as a requirement for engagement, a young Karamojong man is required to wrestle the woman he desires to marry. If he is successful in winning the wrestling match against the woman, he is now considered to be a man and is permitted to marry the woman. This ensures that the man will be strong enough to care for and protect his wife. After a successful match, the dowry negotiations are allowed to commence. In an instance where the young man is unable to defeat the woman in the wrestling match, he will not be considered by his people to be a man and will often leave to marry a woman from a different people-group where a test of strength is not required. If a non-Karamojong man desires to marry a Karamojong woman, he is also required to go through this ceremony.\n\nThe Karamojong have been involved in various conflicts centered on the practice of cattle raids.\n\nThe Karamojong are in constant conflict with their neighbors in Uganda, Sudan and Kenya due to frequent cattle raids. This could be partly due to a traditional belief that the Karamojong own all the cattle by a divine right, but also because cattle are also an important element in the negotiations for a bride and young men use the raids as a rite of passage and way of increasing their herds to gain status. In recent years the nature and the outcome of the raids have become increasingly violent with the acquisition of AK47s by the Karamojong.\n\nThe Ugandan government have attempted to broker deals for weapons amnesties, but the number of cattle the Karamojong have wanted per gun has proved too steep for any meaningful agreement to be made.\n\n"}

It is the fourth song on their 1991 studio album, \"Nevermind\".\n\nWritten by Cobain in 1989, \"Breed\" was originally titled \"Imodium,\" after the anti-diarrhea medicine used by Tad Doyle, lead singer of Seattle rock band TAD, during Nirvana's and TAD's shared European tour. It was first performed live on October 8, 1989 at the Lif Ticket Lounge in Omaha, Nebraska.\n\n\"Breed\" was first recorded in the studio in April 1990 by Butch Vig at Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin, during the recording sessions for what was intended to be the band's second album on Sub Pop, their original label. However, this planned album was cancelled after the band signed with DGC Records shortly after. Vig re-recorded the song during the sessions for what became the band's second album and major label debut, \"Nevermind\", in May 1991 at Sound City Studios in Van Nuys, California. Cobain recorded four vocal takes for the song, with each successive take \"getting worse because he blew his voice out,\" as Vig recalls. The first take was chosen as the master. Both recordings of the song also feature the guitar being panned from one channel to the next during the guitar solo to create what Cobain biographer Charles R. Cross called \"a dizzying\" effect.\n\n\"Breed\" was performed for the last time live at Nirvana's final concert, at Terminal Einz in Munich, Germany on March 1, 1994.\n\n\"Breed\" is an alternative rock song that runs for a duration of three minutes and three seconds. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by BMG Rights Management, it is written in the time signature of common time, with a moderately fast rock tempo of 160 beats per minute. \"Breed\" is composed in the key of F minor, while Kurt Cobain's vocal range spans one octave and three notes, from the low-note of C to the high-note of F. The song follows a basic sequence of F–E–F–A–E in the verses and bridge and D–A–C–B during the refrain as its chord progression. \n\nLyrically, the song addresses themes of teenage apathy and fear within the American middle-class. Stevie Chick of \"Kerrang\" wrote that lyrics such as \"We can plant a house, we can build a tree\" displayed Cobain's \"gift for crafting witty, purposeful nonsense.\"\n\nIn 2015, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked \"Breed\" at number four on their ranking of 102 Nirvana songs, with Julianne Escobedo Shepherd calling it \"one of the most alive songs on \"Nevermind\".\"\n\nIn 2017, to mark what would have been Cobain's 50th birthday, the Phonographic Performance Limited released a list of the top 20 most played Nirvana songs on television and the radio in the United Kingdom, in which \"Breed\" was ranked at number 13.\n\nOn April 24, 2020, the song was performed by American musician Post Malone during his 15-song Nirvana tribute concert, which was livestreamed on YouTube and raised more than $4 million for the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund.\n\nThe \"Nevermind\" version of \"Breed\" appears in the 2007 American action film, \"Shoot 'Em Up\", directed by Michael Davis. It also appears in the video game \"Tony Hawk's Proving Ground\", also from 2007.\n"}

CBH's initial power was only 100 watts and remained at that level for 18 years. In 1947 the station moved to the CBC Radio Building on 5600 Sackville Street. In 1948, the frequency was changed to 1330, and then to 1340 in 1960. In 1963, the station moved to 860 and boosted its power to 10,000 watts.\n\nHowever, CBH had to conform its nighttime signal to protect clear-channel sister station CJBC in Toronto, rendering it practically unlistenable at night in some parts of Halifax. To solve this problem, an FM rebroadcaster, CBHA-FM, was established on 90.5 FM in 1977. While it was only intended to be temporary, the CBC was unable to obtain the funding necessary to upgrade CBH's AM signal. On October 1, 1989, the AM station was shut down, and CBHA-FM became the main CBC station in Halifax.\n\nThe station's local programs are \"Information Morning\" and \"Main Street\", hosted by Jeff Douglas, in the afternoon. Additionally, it produces several programs that air across the Maritimes, including the weekday noon-hour regional program \"Maritime Noon\" and the regional weekend programs \"Weekend Mornings\", \"Maritime Magazine\", \"Atlantic Airwaves\" and \"Maritime Connection\".\n\nShows are produced at studios in the CBC Radio Building at the intersection of Bell Road, Sackville Street, and South Park Street in Halifax. The station serves the Nova Scotia mainland through a network of rebroadcast transmitters, whose schedule is identical to the signal out of Halifax, with the exception of a regional program weekday afternoons from 3:00 to 4:00. The main transmitter in Halifax, as well as the rebroadcaster in Sheet Harbour, air an additional hour of \"Main Street\" during this time.\n\nOn December 10, 2018, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved the CBC's application to operate a new FM transmitter in Digby at 107.1 MHz (channel 296A) with an effective radiated power of 420 watts (non-directional antenna with an effective height of antenna above average terrain of 256.6 metres). The new callsign for the new FM transmitter at Digby will be CBHA-FM-1 and will rebroadcast the programming of CBHA-FM. \n\n"}

It is also an elliptical galaxy, and displays a redshift because it is receding from the Sun at 224 km/s (72 km/s from the Galaxy). The distance to the galaxy is 320,000 light-years and the diameter is 8,400 light-years along its major axis.\n"}
{"id": "2283481", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2283481", "title": "American Gem Society", "text": "American Gem Society\n\nThe American Gem Society (AGS) is a trade association of retail jewelers, independent appraisers, suppliers, and selective industry members, which was founded in 1934 by Robert M. Shipley. Members are held to a high code of ethics with emphasis on consumer protection and education.\n\nThe Society is based in Las Vegas, Nevada, along with the affiliated American Gem Society Laboratories (AGSL) (founded in 1996) and the American Gem Society Advanced Instruments Division (founded in 2004).\n\nThe Society trains and certifies jewelers, gemologists, and jewelry appraisers. Diamond grading is the specialty of the American Gem Society Laboratories and the Society has developed its own cut, color, and clarity standards.\n\nThe AGS was created by Robert M. Shipley. During the 1920s, Shipley was operating quite successfully as a jeweler. However, despite his years in the industry, his lack of expertise regarding gems and jewelry was revealed to him by a pair of his best customers. Humbled by this revelation, Shipley realized that this was a big problem among American jewelers, one which likely accounted for much of the public's distrust for the profession at the time.\nShipley lost his jewelry stores in a divorce and went to Europe, where he completed the Great Britain National Association of Goldsmiths gemological correspondence course. He brought his newfound expertise back to Los Angeles, where he founded his own preliminary course in gemology on September 16, 1930. For the next few years he worked to promote the need for gemological education and train a new breed of \"certified\" jewelers. These jewelers would form the foundation of the Gemological Institute of America (GIA), and later the AGS.\n\nIn its history, the AGS has achieved significant accomplishments within the field of gemology and jewelry.\nAmong these are the following:\n\nA big part of the AGS operation comes in the form of AGS Laboratories, which offers laboratory services to members of the jewelry industry. Primary among these are their diamond grading services. Jewelers are able to have their diamonds scientifically evaluated according to the Four Cs: Color, Clarity, Cut, and Carat Weight. They are then given a diamond grading report, which can be provided to a consumer in order to verify the quality of the diamond they are purchasing.\n\nAdditionally, AGS Laboratories offers laser inscription services. Through the use of a microlaser beam, the laboratory can inscribe a diamond with a serial number, a company logo, or other text on the stone. This service does not affect the quality of the diamond, and is generally performed on the girdle where it can only be viewed with a magnification device.\n\n"}
