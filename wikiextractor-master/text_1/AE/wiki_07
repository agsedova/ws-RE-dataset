In his capacity as Holy Roman emperor the king claimed the exclusive rights of the jurisdiction and taxation of the Jews, and retained responsibility for the protection of their lives and their property. He granted them protection either by a guard or by safe-conduct; chiefly by the latter, for the Jews, being extensive travelers, when they went on long business trips could not always be accompanied by imperial guards. The first instance of the granting of one of these safe-conducts occurred under Louis le Débonnaire (814–840), and a specimen of it may be found among the documents preserved in the \"Liber Formularum\" of that period. According to this document the king grants freedom of travel and exemption from all taxes to three Jews of Lyons \"neque teloneum, neque paravereda aut mansionaticum, aut pulveraticum, aut cespitaticum, aut ripaticum, aut rotaticum, aut portaticum, aut herbaticum prædictis Hebræis exigere præsumant\" (De Rozières, \"Recueil Général des Formules Usitées dans l'Empire des Francs,\" i. 41–43, Paris, 1859–1871; Simson, \"Jahrbücher des Fränkischen Reiches Unter Ludwig, dem Frommen,\" i. 393–396, Leipsic, 1874–76). For such a safe-conduct the Jews were required to pay a certain fee; but this, being understood, is not stated anywhere, as the payment constitutes the only reason for the exemption from other taxes. The stipulations regulating the tolls of Raffelstetten, , issued between 904–906, are to be interpreted in the same manner—the Jews, as privileged merchants, shall not pay more than the regular toll (\"justum theloneum\"). The law expressly states this conforms with the ancient custom (Pertz, \"Mon. Germaniæ Leges,\" iii. 480; Georg Waitz, \"Deutsche Verfassungsgeschichte\", iv. 1, 70, Kiel, 1884; Scherer, \"Rechtsverhältnisse der Juden,\" p. 110, Leipsic, 1901); the same is stated in the charter granted to the Jews of Worms, 1090 (\"Zeitschrift für die Gesch. der Juden in Deutschland,\" i. 139). When the Jews passed under the jurisdiction of the territorial rulers, this principle was acknowledged. Frederick II of Austria, in his law on the Jews, issued 1244, decreed that within the limits of his state they should not pay more than the legal rate of toll—the same rate that all other citizens had to pay (Scherer, l.c. p. 181). As in the stipulations regulating the , and as in the law of Frederick II, only customs duties for goods or slaves were mentioned: therefore a personal tax was unknown.\n\nAs the Jews in increasing numbers passed under territorial jurisdiction, the exemption from personal tax, which was granted them as long as they remained crown property, was no longer respected, for each territorial ruler considered himself entitled to levy taxes on all foreign Jewish subjects who passed through his territory. But these taxes continued as customs duties until, with the growing hostility of the free cities, and with the frequent expulsion from vast territories which became the rule in the fifteenth century, those rulers who had expelled the Jews from their domains determined on the adoption of a policy of keeping them away from their borders. International relations, however, would not permit of the disregard of a passport granted by a foreign ruler to one of his subjects, so when Jews visited a territory in which no Jew was permitted to settle they were subjected to the payment of a toll.\n\nOwing to the weakness of the imperial power of the Holy Roman Empire, Jews expelled from a place could easily settle in the vicinity, and on the strength of their passports do business in the place from which they had been expelled. So the Jews expelled from Nuremberg in 1499 settled in Fürth; those expelled from Nördlingen (1507) settled in ; those who could not gain entrance into the city of Lübeck settled in the village of —all places of settlement within easy walking distance of the cities in which they were denied residence. On the passports issued to them by their respective sovereigns they could engage in trade in the latter places, at least during the day, and, therefore, since the local governments wished to enforce the decrees excluding the Jews, they were driven to adopt new measures (\"R. E. J.\" viii. 212). Administrators soon recognized the financial utility of the Leibzoll, and the territorial rulers in the German empire levied such a toll from all traveling Jews, whether foreigners or their own subjects. In Nuremberg the average annual value of the toll for the last ten years during which Leibzoll was levied (1797–1806) was 2,448 florins (Barbeck, \"Gesch. der Juden in Nürnberg und Fürth,\" p. 106, Nuremberg, 1878).\n\nThe wording of the laws sometimes also suggests an intention of humiliating the Jews. For example, an ordinance of Philip V of Spain (1703) fixes the toll for a wagon-load of merchandise, one head of cattle, or one Jew, when passing over the bridges of Luxembourg, at four sols (\"R. E. J.\" viii. 208). Sometimes the humiliation lay in the form in which the tax was levied. In some places a Jew passing a toll-gate had to cast dice in remembrance of the crucifixion (Grätz, \"Gesch.\" 3d ed., viii. 14); elsewhere, as in Freiberg, in Saxony, Jews were forced to pay for a guard to follow them as long as they remained within the city. Even after the Leibzoll had been officially abolished, as in Austria by Emperor Joseph II in 1782, Jews entering Vienna or staying there for some time had to pay a special tax which differed from Leibzoll only in name. The same may be said of Nuremberg, where Leibzoll was abolished theoretically in 1800, but was levied practically until 1806 under the name of \"Passier- und Eintrittsgeld\". In Warsaw, where the French government had emancipated the Jews, the Russian government re-introduced the Leibzoll under the name of \"Tagzettel\", requiring every Jew entering the city to pay five silver groschen for the first day and three for every additional day he remained (\"Allg. Zeit. des Jud.\" 1862, p. 12).\n\nCertain exemptions from Leibzoll were granted. Under the Austrian law of 1244, corpses were exempt. Albert III, Duke of Austria gave free safe-conduct to three Austrian Jews to bring \"etrogim\" from Triest free of duty in 1389 (Scherer, l.c. p. 535). The Jews living within the territory of the Elector of Mayence were exempted from Leibzoll when they were traveling to attend one of the regular landtags, or to meetings of the district congregations (see Bamberger, \"Histor. Berichte über die Juden der Stadt Aschaffenburg,\" p. 26, Strasburg, 1900). As a mark of special favor, court Jews or mint-farmers were exempt from the payment of such tolls (see Harburg). Later the exemption was extended to manufacturers; and Hirsch David, velvet-manufacturer of Berlin, was exempted by the king (1731) because his business required him to travel frequently (\"Allg. Zeit. des Jud.\" 1902, p. 477). When Meyerbeer went to Vienna, the \"Judenamt\" received orders to treat him \"not as a Jew, but as a cavalier\" (ib. 1847, p. 91). Native Jews were often exempted, for a fixed sum, from paying this toll, but naturally this freed them from it only within the confines of their own country. Thus the Jews of Saxony were exempt from the Leibzoll by an order dated 16 April 1773 (Levy, \"Geschichte der Juden in Sachsen,\" p. 71, Berlin, 1901). The Jews of Berlin compromised with the elector, in 1700, by paying 1,000 ducats annually; this sum (\"Jüdische Presse,\" 22 Aug. 1902) exempted only those who were in the possession of a lawful charter (\"Schutzbrief\"), which had replaced the old safe-conduct (\"Judengeleit\"), and who therefore were called \"vergleitete Juden\" or \"escorted Jews\".\n\nIn December, 1787, Frederick William II of Prussia abolished the Leibzoll in Berlin, and in July, 1788, he abolished it in other places. The abolition of the toll was due largely to the exertions of David Friedländer. In 1791 the Bishop of Salzburg also abolished the toll in his own dominions.\n\nNotwithstanding the liberal spirit which these abolitions showed, the majority of the German states still clung to the tax. With the advent of the French, however, some of them were compelled to abolish the Leibzoll. Early in July, 1798, the French general Cacatte informed the members of the government at Nassau-Usingen that, at the order of the division commander Freitag, the special taxes of the Jews were to be abolished, as they were repugnant to justice and humanity. In consequence of this order the Jews on the left bank of the Rhine were relieved from the payment of Leibzoll. At the conclusion of the peace of Lunéville (21 July 1801) the toll was re-imposed.\n\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century the Jews of Germany found a courageous champion in , who worked persistently for the abolition of this impost. Perceiving that ample resources would be required to carry on his campaign, and not being personally able to command these, he invoked the aid of the German and foreign Jews in 1803, asking them to subscribe to the fund raised for this purpose. He instituted negotiations with the minor German princes at the Diet of Ratisbon (1804), and, aided by Dalberg, the imperial chancellor, succeeded in obtaining free passage for the Jews throughout the Rhine provinces and Bavaria. It was largely due to his efforts that the Leibzoll was abolished in Kurhessen, Hohenlohe, Neuwied, Wied-Runkel, Braunfels, Solms-Rödelheim, and also in Nassau (September, 1806). The emancipation of the Jews from these imposts created much antagonism; and among those opposed to it were such men as Paalzow, Grattenauer, and Buchholz. In the northern Hanse towns the French garrisons compelled the burghers to relieve the Jews from the payment of the Leibzoll, and, notwithstanding much opposition, secured the privilege for the Jews of Hamburg, Lübeck, and Bremen. The Leibzoll was abolished in Brunswick-Lüneburg 23 April 1823, through the efforts of Israel Jacobson, court agent to the Duke of Brunswick. Although the tax had been almost universally abolished, its collection still continued from the Jews visiting Vienna in the reign (1804–1835) of Francis I of Austria. Of the German states, Saxony was the last to abolish it.\n\nUp to 1862 the Polish Jews visiting Russia were treated as foreigners, and as such were not admitted into the interior of the empire. On the other hand, the Russian Jews had great difficulty in entering Poland, and those who went there for business had to pay a \"Geleitzoll.\" In 1826 the representatives of the Jewish community of Kovno petitioned the government for the abolition of the tax, which amounted then to fifteen Polish florins. By order of Emperor Nicholas I this application was referred to the Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich, then Viceroy of Poland, who stated that he considered the abolition of the tax inexpedient, but proposed decreasing its amount and regulating it according to age, sex, and business occupation. He deemed it advisable to introduce a similar tax in Russia, and suggested that each Polish Jew entering Russia, and each Russian Jew entering Poland, should be supplied with a pass descriptive of the place of its issuance, the bearer's business, etc. The local police was to be charged with the inspection of the passes. In consequence of this report, Emperor Nicholas ordered the minister of finance to communicate with the proper authorities, and to draft the regulations for the introduction of the tax in question. After a prolonged correspondence with the Polish authorities the minister found the proposed measure to be inexpedient, not only because of the decrease in the revenues which it would effect, but also because of possible complications and abuses in its enforcement. The \"Geleitzoll\", therefore, remained until abolished by an ukase of 24 May 1862.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2328280", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2328280", "title": "Wisconsin Supreme Court", "text": "Wisconsin Supreme Court\n\nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court is the highest appellate court in Wisconsin. The Supreme Court has jurisdiction over original actions, appeals from lower courts, and regulation or administration of the practice of law in Wisconsin.\n\nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court normally sits in its main hearing room in the East Wing of the Wisconsin State Capitol building in Madison, Wisconsin. Since 1993, the court has also travelled, once or twice a year, to another part of the state to hear several cases as part of its \"Justice on Wheels\" program. The purpose of this program is to give the people of Wisconsin a better opportunity to understand the operations of the state supreme court and the court system.\n\nThe court is composed of seven justices who are elected in statewide, non-partisan elections. Each justice is elected for a ten-year term. Importantly, only one justice may be elected in any year. This avoids the sudden shifts in jurisprudence commonly seen in other state supreme courts, where the court composition can be radically shifted if two or three justices are simultaneously targeted for an electoral challenge based on their views on controversial issues. In the event of a vacancy on the court, the governor has the power to appoint an individual to the vacancy, but that justice must then stand for election in the first year in which no other justice's term expires.\n\nAfter passage of a referendum on April 7, 2015, the chief justice of the court is elected for a term of 2 years by the vote of a majority of the justices then serving on the court, although the justice so elected may decline the appointment. Previous to the change, the justice with the longest continuous service on the court served as the chief justice. Opponents of the referendum called it an attempt to remove longtime Chief Justice Shirley Abrahamson, a member of the court's liberal minority, while supporters called it an effort to promote democracy on the court.\n\n\nIn 2009, the United States Supreme Court decided \"Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co.\", holding 5-4 that a campaign expenditure of over $3 million by a corporate litigant to influence the election of a judge to the court that would hear its case, although legal, was an \"extreme fact\" that created a \"probability of bias\", thus requiring the judge to be recused from hearing the case. Wisconsin had adopted a limit of $1,000 for campaign contributions to judges, but it was unclear when mandatory recusal was required. The League of Women Voters petitioned the Court to require a judge to recuse himself or herself from a proceeding if the judge had received any campaign contributions from a party or entity involved in it. Instead, during its 2009-2010 term and by a 4-3 vote, the Court adopted a rule that recusal is not required based solely on any endorsement or receipt of a lawful campaign contribution from a party or entity involved in the proceeding, and that a judge does not need to seek recusal where it would be based solely on a party in the case sponsoring an independent expenditure or issue advocacy communication in favor of the judge. Voting in favor of the new rule were Prosser, Gableman, Roggensack, and Ziegler. Voting against were Abrahamson, Crooks, and A. Bradley. In the opinion of Justice Roggensack, \"when a judge is disqualified from participation, the votes of all who voted to elect that judge are cancelled for all issues presented by that case. Accordingly, recusal rules . . . must be narrowly tailored to meet a compelling state interest.\" In dissenting, Justice A. Bradley called the decision \"a dramatic change to our judicial code of ethics\" and took issue with the majority's decision to adopt a rule \"proposed by special interest groups.\"\n\nOn June 13, 2011, a confrontation between Justices David Prosser, Jr. and Ann Walsh Bradley occurred in Bradley's chambers. Prosser, Bradley, and the other justices (except N. Patrick Crooks) were discussing the following day's decision that would overturn a ruling blocking the Wisconsin collective bargaining law. Witnesses stated that the incident happened after Prosser had stated that he'd lost all confidence in the leadership of Chief Justice Shirley Abrahamson. Bradley later accused Prosser of putting her in a chokehold. Prosser denied the allegations and asked for \"a proper review of the matter and the facts surrounding it\". The incident was investigated by the Dane County Sheriff's Office. Witnesses to the incident disagreed about what had happened and neither Prosser nor Bradley was charged by a special prosecutor. Ethics charges brought against Prosser based on Bradley's allegations were never adjudicated due to the lack of a quorum on the Court after recusals.\n\nAlthough elections to the Wisconsin Supreme Court are nonpartisan, campaigns for the seats sometimes generate partisan fervor. As a result, elections have become expensive; over $4.3 million was spent in the 2016 race.\n\nOn April 6, 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled, virtually due to the pandemic, that Governor Tony Evers could not delay the state's 2020 primary elections, despite public fears of COVID-19.\n\nOn May 13, 2020, the court ruled 4-3 to strike down Governor Tony Evers' stay-at-home order after a lawsuit by the Republican-led state legislature. The portion of the order that kept all K-12 schools closed for the remainder of the school year remained in effect. The deciding vote to strike down the stay-at-home order was by Daniel Kelly, who had recently lost his bid for re-election to Jill Karofsky.\n\nJustices are elected in nonpartisan elections for ten-year terms. Only one justice may be elected in any year. Justices are elected in the spring election, being the first Tuesday in April. If there are more than two candidates, a spring primary is held on the third Tuesday in February.\n\nMichael Gableman did not seek re-election in 2018. Two county judges, Rebecca Dallet and Michael Screenock, ran for the open seat. A third candidate, Tim Burns, did not make it to the general election in the February 20 primary. Dallet was elected in the April 3 general election.\n\nIncumbent Justice Shirley Abrahamson, who had served on the court for 42 years, did not seek re-election in 2019. Appeals Judge Brian Hagedorn was elected to succeed her in the April 2 general election, and took his seat on the court on August 1, 2019.\n\nOn April 7, 2020, liberal Jill Karofsky defeated conservative incumbent Daniel Kelly as Justice of the Wisconsin Supreme Court. The election was controversially held during the coronavirus pandemic, forcing many voters to vote by mail, wait in long lines for hours, or not participate at all.\n\n\n\n"}

The Type 11 designation was given to this gun as it was accepted in the 11th year of Emperor Taishō's reign (1922). It was first used in 1922 and was the first mortar to be introduced by the Imperial Japanese Army. The mortar was later replaced by the Type 92 battalion gun.\n\nThe Model 11 (1922) 70 mm mortar is exceptional among Japanese mortars in that, although a muzzle-loading weapon, it has a rifled bore. The Japanese marking is \"11th year model high-angle infantry gun\". A monopod, similar to the support of the US 4.2-inch chemical mortar, is another distinguishing feature. The total weight of the weapon is , of which represents the weight of the base plate. The traverse of the piece is 410 mils (23 degrees), and its elevation is 661 to 1,370 mils (37 to 77 degrees). A gunner's quadrant is used to lay in the weapon. It has a level vial, actuated by a knob, a movable arm, and a fixed elevation scale. The elevation scale is graduated in half-degree units from 0 to 55 degrees. The movable arm has a vernier scale which permits readings of 1/16th degree. Before the weapon can be fired, by means of a lanyard attached to a striker arm, a latch pin on the breech end of the tube must be set in its recess.\n\nThe complete high explosive (HE) round consists of a fuze, the shell body, and the propellant charge assembly. The fuze is a point-detonating type, consisting of a two-piece brass body, a booster cup, a detonator holder, and a washer. The steel shell body is threaded at the top to receive the fuze assembly, and at the bottom to accommodate the propellant charge assembly. It is marked with a white band near the base, indicating the body of the shell is made of high grade steel and a red band at the nose, indicating it is filled with black powder. The propellant charge assembly consists of the percussion cap, the propellant powder, and an expanding copper rotating band. The propellant charge is ignited when the firing pin hits the percussion cap. The propellant gases expand the copper rotating band against the rifling in the interior of the barrel; the rifling causes the projectile to rotate and thus increases the accuracy of its flight. The projectile is long and inches in diameter; the complete round weighs . The 70mm mortar was also used to launch an unusual AA mine discharger shell.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2328319", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2328319", "title": "Medium-dependent interface", "text": "Medium-dependent interface\n\nA medium dependent interface (MDI) describes the interface (both physical and electrical/optical) in a computer network from a physical layer implementation to the physical medium used to carry the transmission.\nEthernet over twisted pair also defines a medium dependent interface crossover (MDI-X) interface. Auto MDI-X ports on newer network interfaces detect if the connection would require a crossover, and automatically chooses the MDI or MDI-X configuration to properly match the other end of the link.\n\nThe popular Ethernet family defines common medium dependent interfaces.\nFor 10BASE5, connection to the coaxial cable was made with either a vampire tap or a pair of N connectors. For 10BASE2, the connection to the coaxial cable was typically made with a single BNC connector to which a T-piece was attached. For twisted pair cabling 8P8C, modular connectors are used (often incorrectly called \"RJ45\" in this context). For fiber, a variety of connectors are used depending on manufacturer and physical space availability. \n\nWith 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX, separate twisted pairs are used for the two directions of communication. Since twisted pair cables are conventionally wired pin to pin there are two different pinouts used for the medium dependent interface. These are referred to as MDI and MDI-X (medium dependent interface crossover). When connecting an MDI port to an MDI-X port, a straight through cable is used while to connect two MDI ports or two MDI-X ports, a crossover cable must be used. Conventionally, MDI is used on end devices while MDI-X is used on hubs and switches. Some hubs and switches have an MDI port (often switchable) to connect to other hubs or switches without a crossover cable.\n\nThe terminology generally refers to variants of the Ethernet over twisted pair technology that use a female 8P8C port connection on a computer, or other network device. \n\nThe X refers to the fact that transmit wires on an MDI device must be connected to receive wires on an MDI-X device. \nStraight through cables connect pins 1 and 2 (transmit) on an MDI device to pins 1 and 2 (receive) on an MDI-X device. Similarly, pins 3 and 6 are receive pins on an MDI device and transmit pins on an MDI-X device. The general convention is for network hubs, bridges and switches to use the MDI-X configuration, while all other nodes such as personal computers, workstations, servers and routers use an MDI interface. Some routers and other devices had an uplink/normal switch to go back and forth between MDI and MDI-X on a specific port.\n\nThe requirement of connecting the transmitter of one side to the receiver on the other side and vice versa makes it necessary to always have an \"odd number of crossovers\" between two devices, with an MDI-X port containing an internal crossover. Thus, connecting MDI to MDI-X requires a straight-through cable (one crossover in total). Connecting MDI to MDI (no crossover) or MDI-X to MDI-X (two crossovers) requires a(nother) crossover in the cable to get an odd number. When using more complicated setups through multiple patch panels in structured cabling, the connection can use multiple patch and building cable segments. It is a good idea to have all necessary crossovers on one side, i.e. either on the central hub/switch or on each secondary hub/switch.\n\nTo connect two ports of the same configuration (MDI to MDI or MDI-X to MDI-X) with a 10 or 100 Mbit/s connection (10BASE-T or 100BASE-TX), an Ethernet crossover cable is needed to cross over the transmit and receive signals in the cable, so that they are matched at the connector level.\nThe confusion of needing two different kinds of cables for anything but hierarchical star network topologies prompted a more automatic solution.\n\nAuto MDI-X automatically detects the required cable connection type and configures the connection appropriately, removing the need for crossover cables to interconnect switches or connecting PCs peer-to-peer. As long as it is enabled on either end of a link, either type of cable can be used. For auto MDI-X to operate correctly, the data rate on the interface and duplex setting must be set to \"auto\". Auto MDI-X was developed by Hewlett-Packard engineers Daniel Joseph Dove and Bruce W. Melvin.\nA pseudo-random number generator decides whether or not a network port will attach its transmitter, or its receiver to each of the twisted pairs used to auto-negotiate the link.\n\nWhen two auto MDI-X ports are connected together, which is normal for modern products, the algorithm resolution time is typically < 500 ms. However, a ~1.4 second asynchronous timer is used to resolve the extremely rare case (with a probability of less than 1 in 5×10) of a loop where each end keeps switching.\n\nSubsequently, Dove promoted auto MDI-X within the 1000BASE-T standard and also developed patented algorithms for \"forced mode auto MDI-X\" which allow a link to be automatically established even if the port does not auto-negotiate. This may or may not be implemented on a given device, so occasionally a crossover cable may still be necessary when connecting auto MDI-X to MDI-X (hub or switch), especially when autonegotiation is deactivated.\n\nNewer routers, hubs and switches (including some 10/100, and all 1 gigabit or 10 gigabit devices in practice) use auto MDI-X for 10/100 Mbit connections to automatically switch to the proper configuration once a cable is connected.\n\nGigabit and faster Ethernet links over twisted pair cable use all four cable pairs for simultaneous transmission in both directions. For this reason, there are no dedicated transmit and receive pairs, and consequently, crossover cables are never required for 1000BASE-T communication. The \"physical medium attachment\" sublayer (PMA) provides identification of each pair and usually continues to work even over cables where the pairs are unusually swapped or crossed.\n\n\n"}

McEllistrim the younger succeeded his father when he was elected to Dáil Éireann as a Fianna Fáil Teachta Dála (TD) for the Kerry North constituency at the 1969 general election. At the 1977 general election McEllistrim was elected along with his running mate Kit Ahern. This was the first time that Fianna Fáil had won two seats in the three seat Kerry North constituency. McEllistrim, who was given much credit for this feat, was disappointed not to receive a promotion to a Minister of State.\n\nMcEllistrim became disillusioned with the Taoiseach and party leader Jack Lynch from then and began to believe that Charles Haughey was the right candidate for the party leadership. McEllistrim believed that Lynch was about to retire and was particularly uncomfortable at the thought of George Colley succeeding Lynch. Like his father before him he believed Colley was not right for the role of leader of the party. McEllistrim was particularly vocal with regard to party policy towards Northern Ireland and, as he saw it, Lynch's apparent lack of sympathy towards the northern nationalist community.\n\nMcEllistrim was a member of the so-called \"gang of five\" along with Seán Doherty, Mark Killilea Jnr, Jackie Fahey and Albert Reynolds who started a lobbying campaign in favour of Haughey on the backbenches of the party. After Lynch lost two by-elections in his native Cork he resigned as party leader in December 1979. The leadership contest was called two days later and was a two-way race between Haughey and Colley. Haughey won the leadership contest by a decisive margin and McEllistrim was rewarded by being appointed Minister of State at the Department of Finance with special responsibility for the Office of Public Works. He served as a Minister of State again in 1982, this time at the Department of Fisheries and Forestry.\n\nMcEllistrim lost his seat at the 1987 general election by four votes to Dick Spring. After being nominated to Seanad Éireann he regained his seat at the 1989 general election but did not retain it at the 1992 general election when he lost to constituency colleague Denis Foley.\n\nMcEllistrim died aged 74 on 25 February 2000. His son, Tom McEllistrim, was a TD for Kerry North from 2002 to 2011.\n\n"}

The airport serves as a regional hub for all air travel, from bush carriers to a major U.S. air carrier, Alaska Airlines.\n\nThe National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2015-2019 categorized it as a \"primary commercial service (nonhub)\" airport based on 353,048 enplanements (boardings) in 2012. As per the Federal Aviation Administration, this airport had 378,741 passenger enplanements in calendar year 2008, 337,038 in 2009, and 344,057 in 2010.\n\nDuring World War II, Juneau Airport was used by the United States Army Air Forces as a transport link between the combat bases being established in the Aleutians and airfields in the mainland United States. It was also used by Air Transport Command and facilitated the transport of Lend-Lease aircraft to the Soviet Union via Nome (Marks Army Airfield).\n\nPan American World Airways (Pan Am) was one of the first major airlines to serve Juneau. In 1947, Pan Am was operating daily Douglas DC-4 propliner service to Seattle via a stop at the Annette Island Airport, which served Ketchikan at the time and also flew DC-4 service twice a week nonstop to Whitehorse in the Yukon Territory of Canada with continuing, no change of plane service to Fairbanks, Galena and Nome in Alaska. Pan Am later operated Douglas DC-6B and Boeing 377 Stratocruiser aircraft into the airport. During the 1950s, Pacific Northern Airlines served the airport with Douglas DC-4 and Lockheed Constellation propliners with daily service to Seattle via a stop at Annette Island as well as nonstop to Anchorage and Yakutat and direct to Cordova in Alaska.\n\nThe jet age arrived in Juneau during the early 1960s. In 1963, Pan Am was operating daily Boeing 707 jetliner flights to Seattle via a stop at Annette Island. By 1965, Pacific Northern was operating Boeing 720 jets nonstop to Seattle, Anchorage and Annette Island. In 1967, Pacific Northern was acquired by and merged into Western Airlines, which continued to operate jet service into the airport. By 1968, Western was operating daily nonstop Boeing 720B jet service to Seattle, Anchorage and Annette Island with one stop direct service to Los Angeles. By 1969, Alaska Airlines was operating Boeing 727-100 jet service into the airport on a daily basis with a round trip routing of Seattle - Sitka - Juneau - Yakutat - Cordova - Anchorage - Unalakleet - Nome - Kotzebue. Alaska Air has served Juneau for over 45 years and primarily operated Boeing 727-100, 727-200 and 737-200 jetliners into the airport (including the Boeing 737-200 passenger/freight Combi aircraft) in addition to Boeing 720 jetliners before switching to later model Boeing 737 jets. Besides operating jet service into Juneau, Alaska Airlines also flew smaller prop and turboprop aircraft from the airport in the past including the Convair 240, de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter and two versions of the Grumman Goose amphibian aircraft, being a piston powered model and a turboprop version with the latter being named the \"Turbo-Goose\" by the airline. Alaska Airlines began serving Juneau during the late 1960s following its acquisition of two local air service carriers, Alaska Coastal Airlines, which was based in Juneau, and Cordova Airlines.Other air carriers that served Juneau over the years included Wien Air Alaska and MarkAir, which had both been based in Alaska. Western Airlines also returned to Juneau after ceasing service during the early 1970s. In 1968, Wien was operating Fairchild F-27 turboprop flights into the airport three days a week on a routing of Juneau - Whitehorse - Fairbanks. By 1977, Wien was flying Boeing 737-200 jet service twice a week from the airport on a routing of Juneau - Whitehorse - Fairbanks - Anchorage and by 1979 the airline was operating daily nonstop 737-200 jet flights to Seattle and Anchorage. During the early and mid 1980s, Western was operating daily nonstop Boeing 727-200 service to Seattle. Following its acquisition of and merger with Western in 1987, Delta Air Lines continued to serve Juneau with daily nonstop Boeing 727-200 flights to Seattle and direct, one stop service to Los Angeles into the early 1990s. In 1995, MarkAir operated daily nonstop Boeing 737-400 jet service to Seattle and Anchorage. In 2014, Delta Air Lines returned to Juneau offering first seasonal, and then year round service before leaving the market again at the end of 2016 and now serves Juneau on a seasonal basis. Delta entering the market to compete with Alaska Air resulted in fares to Seattle being reduced almost by half.\n\nJuneau International Airport covers an area of 662 acres (268 ha) at an elevation of 25 feet (8 m) above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 8/26 with an asphalt surface measuring 8,857 by 150 feet (2,700 x 46 m). It also has one seaplane landing area designated 8W/26W, which measures 4,600 by 150 feet (1,402 x 46 m).\n\nFor the 12-month period ending December 31, 2017, the airport had 108,885 aircraft operations, an average of 298 per day: 79% air taxi, 12% general aviation, 8% scheduled commercial, and <1% military. At that time 275 aircraft were based at this airport: 87% single-engine, 1% multi-engine, <1% jet, 10% helicopter, and 1% military.\nAside from providing passenger service, Alaska Airlines also operates Boeing 737-700 jet freighter cargo flight service into Juneau.\n\nBecause of the extreme geography of Southeastern Alaska, land flat enough for airport facilities is at a premium. One of these few areas is the current location of the airport: the Mendenhall Wetlands State Game Refuge, a vastly diverse and ecologically critical region rich with plant life, small mammals, birds, several species of salmon, even black bears and bald eagles. The original airstrip was built in the 1930s, and no environmental impact analysis was performed at that time. The area currently housing the terminal and runways had to be filled in and part of the Gastineau Channel had to be dredged before the airport, in its current incarnation, could be built.\n\nThe airport is the only way in and out of the city, with exception of the Alaska Marine Highway and cargo ships traversing the Inside Passage. In the past, concerns have been raised over the safety of the airport, which is comparatively quite small, with the amount of air traffic it receives. In addition to frequent arrivals and departures from hubs such as Anchorage and Seattle/Tacoma, the airport also has daily and/or weekly service to smaller regional communities, a floatplane runway/docking area, and a heliport. Three major construction projects are planned at the airport within the next few years. An airport terminal renovation project will be the first comprehensive upgrade to the passenger facilities in over twenty years and will provide for better flow through the passenger screening process. The airfield maintenance facilities project will provide much needed room for storage and servicing of snow removal equipment. The runway safety area project will extend the runway at both ends and improve taxiways to meet Federal Aviation Administration requirements.\n\nOn September 4, 1971, Alaska Airlines Flight 1866, a Boeing 727-100, crashed into the easterly slope of a canyon in the Chilkat Range of the Tongass National Forest while on approach to Juneau International Airport. All 111 passengers and crew on board were killed. At the time it was the worst single airplane air disaster in United States history.\n\n"}

The Type 94 designation was given to this gun as it was accepted in the year 2594 of the Japanese calendar (1934).\n\nBy giving the Type 94 an especially heavy and stable mount and bipod, a massive shock absorber group, a powerful projectile, and a lengthy tube and heavy powder charge capacity for long range, Japanese designers intended the weapon to serve as a substitute field or artillery piece that could be hauled in pieces to remote locations, a useful attribute for an army short on transport as well as modern towed large-caliber field howitzers and artillery. The Type 94 had a range of some 4000 yards.\n\nThe Type 94 was encountered throughout the war in China. In the Pacific campaign, it was first used against U.S. forces in the Philippines, and later at the Battle of Guadalcanal. Because of its weight, it was normally employed in static siege or defense situations. Japanese forces sometimes went to great lengths to transport these heavy mortars to remote jungle locations when preparing defensive works.\n\n\n"}

Between 1797 and 1805, the \"Sirius\" was engaged in maintaining the blockade of Napoleonic Europe. She was lost in 1810 when her crew scuttled her after she grounded during the Battle of Grand Port.\n\nThe Admiralty ordered her construction on 30 April 1795, and the keel was laid at the Dudman's yard at Deptford Wharf in September of that year. She was launched on 12 April 1797. The \"Sirius\" class of 1795 was established following the taking of the \"San Fiorenzo\" from the Spanish in 1794, upon whose lines this frigate was based.\n\n\"Sirius\" was commissioned in May 1797 under the command of Captain Richard King. In her first action on 24 October 1798 \"Sirius\" took two Dutch ships, the \"Waakzaamheid\" and the \"Furie\" in the Texel. \"Waakzaamheid\" was under the command of Senior Captain Neirrop. She was armed with twenty-four 9-pounder guns on her main deck and two 6-pounders on her forecastle. She had 100 Dutch seamen aboard her, as well as 122 French troops, and was carrying 2000 stands of arms as well as other ordnance stores. \"Waakzaamheid\" put up no struggle. The sloop shared in the capture.\n\"Furie\" was armed with twenty-six 12-pounders on her main deck and ten 6-pounders on her quarter-deck and forecastle. She had a crew of 153 Dutch seamen, augmented with 165 French soldiers. She was carrying 4,000 stands of arms as well as other ordnance stores. \"Furie\" did exchange fire with \"Sirius\" for about half an hour. \"Sirius\" had only one man wounded. \"Furie\" had eight men killed and 14 wounded. The sloop and the hired armed cutter \"Diligent\" shared in the proceeds of the capture.\n\n\"Sirius\" was among the vessels that shared in the capture on 25 and 28 November of a French brig and sloop. The British vessels included , , and , as well as the hired armed cutters \"Joseph\", \"Fowey\" and \"Dolly\".\n\nThen on 6 January 1800 \"Sirius\" shared with , , and \"Stag\" in the capture of the French brig \"Ursule\".\n\nOn 12 June \"Sirius\" and captured the French privateer \"Vengeur\". She was armed with six long 4-pounders and ten 18-pounder carronades, and carried a crew of 102 men. She was two days out of Bordeaux and sailing for the coast of Brazil. \"Vengeur\" was sailing in company with three letters of marque - a ship, a brig and a schooner - that were bound for Guadeloupe. On 11 June \"Vengeur\" had captured the Jersey-privateer lugger \"Snake\".\n\nOn 3 July \"Sirius\" recaptured the brig \"Cultivator\". \"Indefatigable\" and were in company at the time of the capture. \"Cultivator\", Smith, master, had been sailing from Demerara to London when the French privateer \"Minerve\", of Bordeaux, had captured her.\n\nThe next day, \"Sirius\" and \"Indefatigable\" captured the French ship \"Favori\". Eleven days later, \"Bordelais\" captured the French vessel \"Phoenix\". \"Sirius\" was among the vessels sharing in the prize money by agreement. \"Sirius\" shared in the capture of the French privateer schooner \"Revanche\" on 28 July. The actual captor was \"Uranie\". \"Revanche\" was armed with fourteen 6-pounder guns and had a crew of 80 men. She was 19 days out of Vigo and had already captured and sent in the English brig \"Marcus\", a Portuguese ship, and a Spanish brig that had been a prize to .\n\nOn 11 December \"Sirius\" captured the Spanish merchant brig \"Melchora\", some three miles off Sifarga (Illas Sisargas, some 20 miles west of A Coruña). The brig was 24 hours out of A Coruña on her way to Montevideo when \"Sirius\" captured her. Captain King reported the capture in order to draw attention to the fact that she was the only vessel to have left A Coruña since August. shared in the proceeds of the capture.\n\nOn 26 January 1801, the British frigate \"Oiseau\" encountered the French frigate \"Dédaigneuse\" and gave chase. \"Sirius\" and \"Amethyst\" joined the next day. On the 28th \"Oiseau\" and \"Sirius\" effected the capture while unfavorable winds kept \"Amethyst\" from joining the action. \"Dédaigneuse\" was brought into the Royal Navy as HMS \"Dedaigneuse\". The next day \"Sirius\" was in company with \"Amethyst\" when they captured the Spanish letter of marque \"Charlotta\" of Ferol, 16 hours out of Ferol on her way to Curaçao. The capture took place about six or seven leagues from Cape Belem in Galicia. The hired armed cutter Earl of St Vincent shared in the capture.\n\nOn 29 January captured and destroyed the Spanish privateer \"Intrepido Cid\". \"Sirius\" and \"Amethyst\" shared, by agreement, in the bounty-money.\n\n\"Sirius\" shared by agreement in the proceeds of the capture of the \"Temeraire\" (30 May) and the \"Bien Aimé\" (23 July). In July \"Sirius\" was under the temporary command of Captain J.B. Edwards. In July Commander John Edwards took command temporarily.\n\nIn July–August 1802, \"Sirius\" was under the command of Captain King, who further had command of a small squadron on anti-smuggling duties. The other vessels in the squadron were , , , and .\n\nIn August 1802, Captain William Prowse took command of \"Sirius\".\n\nAfter the resumption of hostilities with France, \"Sirius\" took part in the blockade of Brest.\n\nOn 18 May 1803, \"Sirius\" and captured \"Mere de Familie\". Ten days later \"Sirius\" captured the French ship \"Achille\" and then on 8 June \"Trois Freres\". The capture of \"Aigle\" on 30 May resulted in a preliminary allotment to \"Sirius\"s crew of £6200 in prize money. Two days earlier \"Sirius\" had captured \"Zephyr\". \"Sirius\" shared with \"Nemesis\" the proceeds of the capture of \"Trois Freres\" and \"Aigle\".\n\n\"Sirius\" then was among the vessels sharing in the salvage money from the recapture of \"Lord Nelson\" on 27 August. Similarly, \"Sirius\" shared in the salvage money for , recaptured on 28 October.\n\nOn 15 February 1805, \"Sirius\" recaptured \"Spring\". On 22 July \"Sirius\" participated in Calder's Action (Battle of Cape Finisterre (1805)). She shared in the prize money for the Spanish ships \"St. Raphael\" and \"Firme\", and possibly other vessels as well.\n\nOn 21 October, \"Sirius\" joined the British fleet under Vice Admiral Lord Nelson at Trafalgar. Entering battle to the north of the weather column, her station placed her only a few cable lengths from HMS \"Victory\".\n\nParliament voted a grant of £300,000 to be distributed in September 1806 among the participants of the battle. Other distributions of prize money followed. In 1847 the Admiralty would issue surviving claimants from the battle the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \"Trafalgar\".\n\nOn 25 November, \"Sirius\", and \"Swiftsure\" captured \"Nemesis\".\n\nIn January 1806, \"Sirius\" and the 74-gun were escorting a convoy from Gibraltar when they encountered a French squadron under Admiral Willaumez. The French succeeded in capturing two of the merchant vessels and four of the French fleet unsuccessfully chased \"Sirius\" for two hours, but forcing her to separate from the convoy.\n\nFrom then until 1808 \"Sirius\" served in the Mediterranean. On 17 April 1806 at 2pm \"Sirius\" was five or six leagues off Civitavecchia when Prowse received intelligence that a French force had sailed that morning for Naples. He immediately set out and succeeded in catching up with them just after sunset two leagues from the mouth of the Tiber River. The force consisted of a ship, three corvettes, and five heavy gun-vessels, and they were deployed in line of battle near a dangerous shoal, awaiting \"Sirius\"s attack. The action commenced at 7pm and lasted for two hours before the French ship leading the flotilla struck. The water had been calm so the French had been able to fire well and \"Sirius\" herself was too damaged to pursue when the remainder of the French flotilla withdrew; Prowse was also concerned about the risks of pursuit at night in water with shoals.\n\nThe captured vessel was the \"Bergère\", which was under the command of \"capitaine de frégate\" Charles-Jacques-César Chaunay-Duclos, commodore of the flotilla and member of the Legion of Honor. She was armed with eighteen 12-pounder guns and one 36-pounder \"obusier\", and had a crew of 189 men. Prowse described her as \"remarkably fine Vessel, sails well, and is fit for His Majesty's Service.\" Prowse omitted mention of French casualties, but \"Sirius\" lost nine men killed, including Prowse's nephew, and 20 men wounded, nine dangerously so. This action too qualified the surviving claimants for the Naval General Service Medal, this time with the clasp \"Sirius 17 April 1806\".\n\nBetween April 1808 and January 1809 \"Sirius\" was at Chatham, undergoing repairs. In November 1808 Captain Samuel Pym assumed command of \"Sirius\". On 24 February 1809 he sailed for the Cape of Good Hope and the Indian Ocean.\n\nOn 2 March 1809 \"Sirius\" captured the French schooner \"Mecontent\", and her cargo. In August \"Sirius\" joined a squadron under Commodore Josias Rowley and on 21 September participated in an attack on Saint-Paul, Réunion.\n\n\"Sirius\" and HMS \"Raisonnable\" captured the French frigate \"Caroline\". She was taken into British service as HMS \"Bourbonaise\", there already being an HMS \"Caroline\". The British also recaptured several East Indiamen that \"Caroline\" had captured, and the East India Company's brig \"Grappler\". The land attack succeeded in capturing a number of shore batteries and guns. \"Sirius\" suffered the loss of two marines killed, two marines wounded, and one sailor missing.\n\nThe summer of 1810 saw a campaign against the French Indian Ocean possessions. The British captured the Île Bourbon (Réunion) in July. In August, they turned their attention to Mauritius, where they attempted to land troops to destroy coastal batteries and signals around Grand Port; the attempt turned sour, however, when two French forty-gun frigates, \"Bellone\" and \"Minerve\", the 18-gun corvette \"Victor\", and two East Indiaman prizes entered the harbour and took up defensive positions at the head of the main entrance channel. The French also moved the channel markers to confuse the British approach.\n\nOn 23 August 1810 the British squadron entered the channel. \"Sirius\" was the first to run aground, followed by \"Magicienne\" and \"Néréide\". \"Iphigenia\" prudently anchored in the channel some distance from the action. The French vessels concentrated all their gunfire first against \"Néréide\" and then against \"Magicienne\".\n\nThe battle continued without interruption all night and on 24 August the French boarded the defenceless \"Néréide\". Once the French flag was hoisted on what was left of the foremast of the \"Néréide\", \"Magicienne\" and the \"Sirius\" began an intense cross fire against their enemies. Still, in the evening her crew had to abandon \"Magicienne\", setting her on fire as they left her.\n\nEvery effort to kedge \"Sirius\" off failed; she was firmly aground, making water, and unable to be freed. Pym ordered stores and provisions to be transferred to \"Iphigenia\". When this was complete the men were removed with the last of the crew leaving on the morning of 25 August 1810. As they left they set fire to her; \"Sirius\" exploded at about eleven o'clock, with her hull then briefly drifting off the reef before sinking.\n\nThe Battle of Grand Port was an important victory for the French. With two English frigates taken (\"Iphigenia\" and \"Néréide\"), and two others destroyed (\"Sirius\" and \"Magicienne\"), as well as 1,600 prisoners taken against 150 French dead or wounded, this battle marks the only French naval victory of the Napoleonic Wars.\n\n\"Sirius\" lies in some of water.

In the 1990–91 season Potvin was awarded the Guy Lafleur Trophy as Playoff MVP.\n\nPotvin was drafted in the second round, 31st overall by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 1990 National Hockey League entry draft. In the 1991–92 season, Potvin played 35 games for the St. John's Maple Leafs, compiling a 2.93 GAA. For his efforts, Potvin was awarded the Dudley \"Red\" Garrett Memorial Award (rookie of the year), the Baz Bastien Memorial Trophy as the top goaltender in the AHL and selected to the AHL First All-Star Team. During that season, Potvin was called up to the NHL and saw brief action in 4 games, compiling a 2.28 GAA and a .933 save percentage.\n\nIt wasn't until the 1992–93 season that Potvin became a regular in the NHL. That season he played 48 games, compiling a 2.50 GAA (1st in the NHL) and a solid .910 save %. The rapid acceleration of his development led the coaching staff to establish him as their #1 goaltender and prompted the trade of Grant Fuhr to the Buffalo Sabres. That season, Potvin also backstopped the Maple Leafs to the Stanley Cup conference finals, only to lose to the Los Angeles Kings in a grueling seven game series. His dynamic performance made him a finalist for the Calder Memorial Trophy.\n\nIn the 1993–94 season, Potvin silenced any doubts of a sophomore jinx. He posted 34 wins and a solid 2.89 GAA, including tying Kirk McLean's then NHL record for most wins in October with nine. He was also voted to his first NHL All-Star Game. In the 1993–94 playoffs, Potvin recorded 3 shutouts in the first-round series against the Chicago Blackhawks, all by a 1–0 margin, including the final NHL game ever played at the illustrious Chicago Stadium. He also became the first Maple Leafs goaltender to stop a penalty shot in a Stanley Cup Playoff game, when he stopped Chicago's Patrick Poulin. Potvin again brought his team to the conference finals, this time losing to the Vancouver Canucks in five games.\n\nIn the 1995–96 season, Potvin was selected to his 2nd NHL All-Star Game. However, the Toronto Maple Leafs exited in the first round of the playoffs. The following season, with the aging of the defense corps in front of him, Potvin and the Maple Leafs would miss the playoffs. He would set an NHL record for most shots faced in a season, 2,438, later broken by Roberto Luongo during his stint with the Florida Panthers. In the 1998–99 season, Toronto signed free agent Curtis Joseph, leaving Potvin expendable. He would play in only 5 games due to a knee injury, before he and sixth round pick (Fedor Fedorov) were traded to the New York Islanders for defenceman Bryan Berard and a sixth round pick. Despite the new surroundings, Potvin was unable to reclaim the success he had earlier in his career.\n\nThe next season, Potvin, a second round, and third round draft pick were traded to the Vancouver Canucks for Kevin Weekes, Dave Scatchard and Bill Muckalt. Potvin struggled with the Canucks and in the 2000–01 season he was dealt to the Los Angeles Kings for future considerations. Immediately, Potvin made an impact leading the Kings to the 7th seed, recording 13 wins and 5 losses. He had a remarkable 1.96 GAA and a .919 save %. Potvin led the Kings to a first-round upset of the Detroit Red Wings, and pushed the eventual Stanley Cup Champion Colorado Avalanche to a 7th game in the second round, recording 2 shutouts in that series. Game 6 of that series was a memorable duel between Potvin and Colorado goalie Patrick Roy, which the Kings and Potvin won 1–0 in double overtime.\n\nPotvin again led the Kings to the 2002 playoffs, where they pushed the Colorado Avalanche to seven games (rallying from a 3–1 series deficit) in the 1st round.\n\nIn September 2003, Potvin was signed to a 1-year contract by the Boston Bruins. He backed-up Calder Memorial Trophy Winner Andrew Raycroft during the 2003–04 season. Coincidentally, Raycroft broke Potvin's record for consecutive games played by a Maple Leafs goalie during the 2006–07 season. Early in the 2005–06 season, the Atlanta Thrashers were in talks with Potvin in hopes of signing him after starting goaltender Kari Lehtonen and backup goaltender Mike Dunham went down with injuries. However, Potvin did not have equipment that conformed to the new NHL standards, nor did he wish to accept the two-way contract that was being offered to him, so the Thrashers instead decided to sign Steve Shields.\n\nPotvin currently lives with his wife Sabrina Tardif, and his three children Noemie, Xavier and Felicia Potvin in Magog, Quebec, and is the head coach for the midget AAA \"Magog Cantonniers\".\n\n\n"}

Marie, Ontario, in operation from 1907 until 2006.\n\nThe company was founded in 1907 by three families, the Doran family, the Mackey family and the Fee family. The organizer and operating head of the company was J.J. Doran. Doran, together with co-founders J.J. Mackey and Richard Fee expanded operations throughout Northern Ontario.\n\nConstruction and commencement of its primary facility began in Sudbury as Sudbury Brewing and Malting Co. in 1907. It began to expand in 1911, with the purchase of the Soo Falls Brewing Co. in Sault Ste. Marie, and again in 1913 with the acquisition of Kakabeka Falls Brewing Co. in Fort William.\n\nIn 1919, the company established its Doran's Brewery division in Timmins, and in 1948 it acquired the Port Arthur Beverage Co. in Port Arthur.\n\nAll of the individual breweries operated under their original names until 1960. In that year, all of the brewing operations were consolidated under one management, relinquishing their previous names and becoming known as Doran's Northern Breweries.\n\nDuring its prime, the company's most distinctive product was the \"draft ball\", draft beer packaged in a large plastic ball instead of a conventional metal beer keg.\n\nOn August 31, 1971 the company was purchased by Canadian Breweries, although it continued to operate under the name Doran's Northern Breweries. In July 1977, the Doran's employees purchased the company back from Canadian Breweries, and Northern became the first employee-owned brewing cooperative in North America.\n\nIn 1979, the brewery began marketing its beers in Southern Ontario as well.\n\nIn 2004, the company was purchased by an investment group led by Leo Schotte. Schotte hired a veteran of the brewery business in Canada, William Sharpe, as president. In 2005, the company announced a major rebranding effort, retiring many of its old products in favour of more modern brews and brand identities.\n\nIn 2006 questions were raised at Sudbury and Sault Ste. Marie city councils about tax benefits extended to Northern Breweries and whether the brewery was meeting the conditions of the agreement. One of the conditions was increased hiring at the breweries and there was no evidence that this had taken place. In June 2006, Sharpe appeared before Sault Ste. Marie city council and cited poor sales and lack of investor interest as reasons for the downturn in the company's fortunes. By 2006, the brewery was $7 million in debt and had ceased production at the Sudbury facility. Sharpe left the company in July 2006, and by December the company was defunct.\n\nNorthern Breweries products are no longer being manufactured. A tax sale of its assets took place in 2009.\n\nThe company's facility in Sudbury was acquired in 2010 by Sookram Bus Lines, a local tour and charter bus operator, but owner Druve Sookram put the building back up for sale in 2013 after determining that his plans for the building were not financially feasible. In June 2014, real estate developer Greg Oldenburg acquired the Sudbury facility, announcing plans to convert the building into a loft condominium development. In November 2016, Oldenburg received rezoning approval from the city's planning department to proceed with his conversion plans.\n\nThe facility in Sault Ste. Marie was acquired by Renaissance Place Corporation in 2011, with a mixed condominium and retail project planned for the site, but was damaged by arson in 2013 and has been listed for resale after falling into tax arrears.\n\nNew microbrewery companies have been established in both cities since Northern Breweries' demise, with Stack Brewing launched in Sudbury in 2013, OutSpoken Brewing launched in Sault Ste. Marie in 2014 and Northern Superior Brewing launched in Sault Ste. Marie in 2015.\n\n"}

They were introduced in a series of picture books and later adapted as animated television characters. Lola is an energetic, imaginative little girl; Charlie is her kind and patient older brother who is always willing to help Lola learn and grow.\nThe first \"Charlie and Lola\" book was \"I Will Not Ever Never Eat a Tomato\", published by Orchard Books in 2000. The U.S. edition was published in the same year by Candlewick Press, with the title: \"I Will Never NOT EVER Eat a Tomato\".\nCharlie and Lola's parents, as well as their friends' parents, are often mentioned, but never seen.\n\nFor that first book in the series, Child won the 2000 Kate Greenaway All-Medal Trophy from the Library Association, recognising the year's best children's book illustration by a British subject. For the 50th anniversary of the Medal (1955–2005) it was named one of the top ten winning works, selected by a 2007 panel to compose the ballot for a public election of the all-time favourite.\n\n\n\nVarious colouring books and a magazine are also available in the UK.\n\nThe \"Charlie and Lola\" books have been translated into Welsh under the name \"Cai a Lois\" and into many other languages.\n\nCharlie is the imaginative and helpful brother of Lola. He is 7 years old and has platinum blonde hair like Lola. Charlie is often asked to look after Lola, and he sometimes has to think of creative ways to keep her busy. In both the TV series and the books, he breaks the fourth wall by talking about Lola to the viewers/readers.\n\nLola is an imaginative, quirky 5-year-old girl. Lola is Charlie's little sister and is best friends with Lotta. She is described by her brother Charlie as \"small and very funny\". She likes playing and is full of character.

He resides at the third level in his flat like Charlie who resides on the third level too.\n\nLotta is Lola's best friend who lives nearby. After meeting on their first day at school they became fast friends and spent lots of time together. Lotta usually follows Lola's lead, and is in awe of Lola's brother Charlie, his friend Marv, and Sizzles the dog.\n\nSoren Lorenson is Lola's imaginary friend, rendered as monochrome and translucent. When Lola and Soren are playing, Soren is rather detailed (has the look of a real person only grey and translucent). When someone interrupts them (such as Charlie), Soren still has detail and he becomes more unknown.\n\nMarty Lowe\n\nMarty is Marv's older brother. He doesn't like throwing anything away. Marty does not seem to like people in his room. His voice is heard in\n\"Look After Your Planet\". He exclaims \"Get out of my room, now!\nPlayed by Charlie Avery\n\nMinnie Reader is a classmate and friends with the girls including Lola and Lotta and is very clever.

She has red hair which she wears in pigtails. She also wears a skirt, a long sleeve shirt and striped tights.\n\nJack\n\nJack is Marv's cousin.

Apparently, this is also Søren Lorenson's favourite toy; he plays with it when Lola's not around.\n\nThe Rocket - A class project of Charlie's making, the rocket is a model space rocket that won Charlie a First Place prize in school; he beat Marv and another boy named Harvey. Unfortunately, Lola in her curiosity had a bit of a mishap with it and broke the rocket.

He now belongs to Lola.\n\nThe books have been adapted by Tiger Aspect into a cartoon series, using a collage style of animation which accurately captures the style of the original books. Directed by Kitty Taylor and Claudia Lloyd. 2D cel animation, paper cutout, fabric design, real textures, photomontage, and archive footage are all employed and subsequently animated in a software application called CelAction. The cartoons are also notable for their use of children's voices, rather than adult voice actors, a technique pioneered by the Peanuts television specials.\n\nThe first series of 26 episodes (11 minutes each) was first broadcast on 7 November 2005. The second series of 26 episodes (again, 11 minutes each) started broadcasting on CBeebies on 2 October 2006 (with the morning broadcast also being shown on BBC Two) a third series followed. In the television series, Charlie is seven and Lola is four, and goes to school (her teacher is called Mrs. Hansen). In episodes of both the first and second series, Charlie celebrates his birthday (in \"It's a Secret...\" and \"This Is Actually My Party\"), although this doesn't seem to affect his age in other episodes. The third series, a final 26-episode run, was broadcast in the UK and the US in the 2007-2008 television season. With two special episodes broadcast in 2006 and 2007, a total of 80 episodes were produced.\n\n\"Charlie and Lola's Best Bestest Play\" was first performed at Polka Theatre on 26 April 2008 and has subsequently been performed at the venue again in 2010 and 2012. It will be staged for the first time at Glow, the events and exhibition space at Bluewater in Kent, by Watershed Productions over the Christmas period of 2013.\n\n\"Charlie and Lola's Best Bestest Play\" is based on the characters created by Lauren Child and adapted by Jonathan Lloyd, Artistic Director of Polka Theatre.\n\n\"Charlie and Lola's Favourite and Best Music Record\" was released on 19 March 2007, aimed at parents as well as children. The music is largely a development of existing interstitial and theme music taken from series 1 and 2. There are elements of easy listening, lounge, big band jazz, reggae, bluegrass, eastern European, sci-fi, Latin, classical and film music. There are 17 tracks plus one hidden track, with the programme's theme tune opening and closing the album.\n\nEach track includes spoken word extracts from the series. In many cases, these are manipulated to fit with the musical accompaniment.\n\n\"The Bestest in the Barn\" was released as a single on 12 March 2007. It features Lola and Lotta teaching various animals on their farm how to sing, dance and play music. This is the only track on the album which does not appear in any episode. Lola and Lotta do however appear as farmers in \"I Do Not Ever Never Want My Wobbly Tooth To Fall Out\". They also have a tendency to imagine that animals are capable of developing impressive human skills, as seen in \"We Do Promise Honestly We Can Look After Your Dog\" and \"I Will Not Ever Never Forget You Nibbles\". \"The Bestest in the Barn\" now features on a playlist of CBeebies programme music played throughout CBeebies Land at the Alton Towers Resort.\n\nThe album is a collaboration between various composers and musicians who write and perform for the TV series. Much of the music is programmed but many tracks feature performances by musicians from London-based bands – Menlo Park, Polar Bear and Acoustic Ladyland.\n\nFour of the tracks have been animated by Tiger Aspect Productions: \"The Bestest in the Barn\", \"Sizzles\", \"Batcat\" and \"It's Snowing\". \"The Bestest in the Barn\" video is encoded as an mpeg on the album CD, and all four videos are included as DVD extras on the series 2 DVD collection.\n\n\nTheme Tune written by Tom Dyson and Soren Munk\nProduction & Arrangement with John Greswell\n\nAll other tracks written by John Greswell and produced by Greswell / Taylor for MPM London Ltd.\n\nExcept:\n\n\nDemon Music Group Ltd.\n\nBBC Worldwide Ltd.\n\nAll tracks published by Tiger Aspect / BMG Music Publishing\n\nSleeve Package design by David Mackintosh\n\n\n\"The Bestest in the Barn\", \"Dancing Dogs\", \"Batcat\" and \"It's Snowing\" promos animated by Tiger Aspect Productions.\nTom Beattie, Betti Doherty, Alistair Douglas, Catherine T.

It is the fifth installment in the \"Friday the 13th\" film series. The film is set at a fictional halfway house, where an adult Tommy Jarvis—who killed Jason Voorhees as a child—again fears for his life when a new hockey-masked assailant begins a series of brutal murders. The film features a cameo appearance from Corey Feldman, who portrayed Tommy in the previous film.\n\n\"A New Beginning\" features a high number of on-screen murders. Aside from its gore and violence, the film has also become known for its explicit nudity and sex scenes, as well as frequent drug use. Peter Bracke's book \"Crystal Lake Memories: The Complete History of Friday the 13th\" details that behind the scenes, the production was plagued with hardcore drug use.\n\nShot in California in 1984 on a budget of $2.2 million, \"A New Beginning\" was released theatrically on March 22, 1985, and grossed $22 million at the U.S. box office. The film was initially going to set up a new trilogy of films with a different villain for the series but, after a disappointing reception from fans and a steep decline in box-office receipts from \"Part III\" and \"\", Jason Voorhees was brought back for the next installment \"\" (1986) and has been the main antagonist in the series since. In addition to weak box office returns, most critics gave the film negative reviews.\n\nThe movie begins with Tommy Jarvis (as a child) walking in the woods, where he finds the gravestone of Jason Voorhees. Two boys, Les and Neil, dig Jason out of the grave. Before the two can do can anything else, Jason kills them and goes to kill Tommy. It turns out, however, that it was all a dream of Tommy's.\nFive years after the Jason Voorhees, the youngest survivor, Tommy Jarvis, is tormented by nightmares of Jason, which leads to his internment in numerous psychiatric hospitals. He is transferred to the Pinehurst Halfway House, managed by Dr. Matt Letter and his assistant Pam Roberts. Tommy meets a circle of other teens consisting of lovers Eddie Kelso and Tina McCarthy, the stutterer Jake Patterson, the Goth Violet Moraine, the serious Robin Brown, the compulsive eater Joey Burns, and the young Reggie Winter, whose grandfather works as the facility's cook. The group is disliked by their neighbor Ethel Hubbard, as Eddie and Tina have made a habit of engaging in sexual intercourse on her lawn. For this reason, Matt forbids the group from venturing outside the facility's premises. Vic Faden, another patient in the institute, is gripped by a raptus of madness caused by Joey's impertinence and brutally kills him with an axe, leading to his arrest. That evening, two greasers are murdered by an unseen assailant after their car breaks down, and a diner waitress and her boyfriend are killed the following night. The sheriff hypothesizes that Jason Voorhees is the perpetrator of these murders, despite being killed many years ago, while Tommy himself is rendered a suspicious party.\n\nThe next morning, Eddie and Tina disobediently go into the forest and have sex. They are spotted by Ethel's farmhand Raymond Joffroy, who is killed soon after. While Eddie leaves to go wash off in the creek, Tina is murdered, and the same fate befalls Eddie. Reggie begs his grandfather for a visit to his brother Demon, who has just returned to town, and Pam offers to accompany him while bringing Tommy along. Tommy meets Ethel's son Junior and gets into a fight with him, but then runs away into the forest after realizing his actions. After Pam and Reggie leave, Demon and his girlfriend are slaughtered. Upon Pam and Reggie's return to the institute, they are warned of the disappearance of Matt and Reggie's grandfather. Pam goes to search for them, entrusting Reggie to Violet, Jake and Robin. At this time, Ethel and Junior are killed, as are Jake, Robin and Violet after Reggie falls asleep. Reggie awakens just as Pam returns, and they discover the trio's corpses in Tommy's room. The killer, who has taken on Jason's image, bursts into the house.\n\nAfter a long chase in which Pam and Reggie find the corpses of Matt and Reggie's grandfather, Jason is lured into a barn where he is struck by a tractor. Tommy returns and is attacked by Jason, but he manages to defend himself and escape. Tommy manages to throw Jason from the loft window and kill him. \"Jason\" is revealed to be one of the paramedics (Roy Burns) who arrived at the scene of Joey's murder. The paramedic happened to be Joey's loner father who went insane after his son's death. While recovering in the hospital, Tommy has another hallucination of Jason, but he faces his fears which makes Jason's hallucination disappear. He hears Pam approaching and smashes the window to appear as though he has escaped. When Pam rushes in, Tommy appears from behind the door wearing Roy's hockey mask and wielding a kitchen knife.\n\nJohn Hock appeared as Jason Voorhees in the opening dream sequence because Morga was unavailable when the scene was shot. He also performed the stunt where Roy fell off the barn.\n\n\"Friday the 13th: A New Beginning\" was cast under a fake title, \"Repetition\", and many of the actors in the film were not aware it was a \"Friday the 13th\" installment until after they were cast in their roles. Among the unaware cast was lead actor John Shepherd, who spent several months volunteering at a state mental hospital to prepare for the role, and that he felt \"really disappointed\" to discover that \"Repetition\" was actually the fifth entry in the \"Friday the 13th\" series. Actor Dick Wieand stated that \"It wasn't until I saw \"Part V\" that I realized what a piece of trash it was. I mean, I knew the series' reputation, but you're always hoping that yours is going to come out better\", and director Danny Steinmann stated that he \"shot a fucking porno in the woods there. You wouldn't believe the nudity they cut out.\"\n\nAccording to the DVD box set \"Friday the 13th: Return to Crystal Lake\", Corey Feldman was only able to make a cameo appearance in the film as a result of his involvement as an actor in \"The Goonies\", which was released the same year as \"A New Beginning\". Feldman filmed the inserts of his cameo on a Sunday, as that was his off day of shooting his other film, and the footage was shot in the backyard of his family's home in Los Angeles with a rain machine.\n\nThe film is the only entry in the \"Friday the 13th\" film series to feature a hockey mask design with two blue triangles pointing downward, as opposed to the more common variant of three red triangles, with the lower two pointing upward.\n\nOn January 13, 2012, La-La Land Records released a limited edition 6-CD boxset containing Harry Manfredini's scores from the first six \"Friday the 13th\" films. It sold out in less than 24 hours.\n\n\"Friday the 13th: A New Beginning\" opened on March 22, 1985, on 1,759 screens. The film debuted at number 1 on its opening weekend with a gross of $8,032,883, beating the teen sex comedy sequel \"Porky's Revenge\", the biopic \"Mask\", Berry Gordy's martial-arts action musical \"The Last Dragon\" and the Disney dinosaur fantasy \"\". By the end of its theatrical run, the film would earn $22 million at the domestic box office, placing it at number 41 on the list of 1985's top box office earners. The film faced competition throughout the first half of the year against horror releases \"Cat's Eye\" and \"Lifeforce\".\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, \"Friday the 13th: A New Beginning\" holds a 16% approval rating based on 19 reviews, with an average rating of 3.18/10.\n\nGene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" criticized the film for a perceived lack of originality, writing: \"The new film is not really new. The same killer—a guy wearing a hockey mask and wielding a machete—still haunts a bunch of youngsters, mostly the inmates of a mental hospital,\" and added that there \"is little suspense.\" \"Variety\" wrote: \"The fifth \"Friday the 13th\" film reiterates a chronicle of butcherings with even less variation than its predecessors.\" Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" wrote: \"It's worth recognizing only as an artifact of our culture.\" A review in the British film journal \"Films and Filming\" was critical of its redundancy in comparison to the previous sequels, with the review noting: \"The woods are really spooky...especially when there's one of those giant thunderstorms (and boy! Does that Pam look great in a wet blouse!). And wait till you see what happens when Jason traps this one poor guy in a porta-loo!\"\n\nHenry Edgar of the \"Daily Press\" wrote: \"If you like the others in this series, you'll like this one. If you didn't, stay away. Jason has his own followers, and he seems willing to continue the bloodshed forever.\" Steve Davis of \"The Austin Chronicle\" criticized the film's redundant violence, noting that the film consisted of the \"Same screaming, same endless chases, same breasts, same blood, same axe, same lack of explanation, same ending primed for another sequel. Is there a pattern emerging here? In short: same as it ever was, same as it ever was.\" Scott Meslow of \"GQ\" called the film \"the bloodiest, most deranged\" installment in the series, noting its total of 22 murder sequences. Leonard Maltin awarded the film no stars, writing: \"A clever title (after... \"The Final Chapter\") for more gore galore, as gruesome and disgusting as ever.\"\n\nWriting for \"Slant Magazine\", Jeremiah Kipp wrote: \"There’s more plot than usual, involving Jason survivor Tommy Jarvis wondering if the pileup of corpses can be blamed on Jason, a copycat, or himself. But Agatha Christie this ain’t. The tone is crude, raunchy, and leering, with kill scenes combined with more nudity than usual.\"\n\n\"Friday the 13th: A New Beginning\" was released on LaserDisc in 1986, and on VHS in 1994 by Paramount Home Video. Paramount released it in the United States on DVD on September 25, 2001. In 2009, Paramount reissued its \"Friday the 13th\" films on DVD in \"Deluxe Editions,\" reissuing \"A New Beginning\" on June 16, 2009. This release featured several newly-commissioned bonus materials, including an audio commentary and interviews with the cast and crew.\n\nOn September 13, 2013, Paramount and Warner Brothers co-released the \"Friday the 13th: The Complete Collection\" Blu-ray box set, featuring each of the twelve films; this marked the first Blu-ray release of \"A New Beginning\". Paramount and Warner reissued the film as a standalone double-feature Blu-ray paired with \"\" in 2014. On February 13, 2018, Paramount re-released the film in another box set titled, \"Friday the 13th: The Ultimate Collection\" features only the first eight films of the franchise.\n\n\n"}

It is the largest fresh water island in the British Isles.\n\nInchmurrin is the largest and most southerly of the islands in Loch Lomond. It reaches a height of towards the north and is largely wooded. There is an excellent view of the north end of the loch.\n\nAlong with Creinch, Torrinch, and Inchcailloch, Inchmurrin forms part of the Highland boundary fault.\nInchmurrin was the site of a 7th-century monastery, with a chapel dedicated to Saint Mirin, after whom it was named.\n\nThe island was formerly a deer park of the Dukes of Montrose, who had a hunting lodge built in 1793 and maintained a gamekeeper and his family there. 200 deer are recorded in 1800. There are ruins of a castle, probably built for Duncan, 8th Earl of Lennox whose seat was Balloch Castle at the south end of Loch Lomond. The castle was probably a hunting lodge for the deer park established on the island by King Robert I of Scotland in the early 14th century. After her husband Murdoch Stewart, Duke of Albany, father Donnchadh, Earl of Lennox, and two sons were executed by James I in 1425, Isabella Countess of Lennox retired to the castle on Inchmurrin with her grandchildren.\n\nIn 1417, Iain Colquhoun of Luss was killed here by robbers. Sir John Colquhoun of Luss, governor of Dumbarton Castle, was murdered at Inchmurrin in 1439, during a raid led by Lachlan MacLean.\n\nIn 1617, James VI made his only return visit to Scotland, and included Inchmurrin in his itinerary to go hunting. The Duke of Lennox wrote to the custodian of the island on 23 July 1617, asking for food to be prepared for \"a good nombre of sharpe stomaches\", probably a reference to the hunting trip.\n\nRob Roy raided the island. At one point, his men came to control all the boats on the River Endrick and Loch Lomond, which were later used to remove cattle from Inchmurrin.\n\nInchmurrin was used as a mental asylum, and also unmarried pregnant women were sent here to give birth.\n\nThe English travel writer, H.V. Morton visited Inchmurrin in the 1930s and described it as \"the grassy isle, an island packed with memories.\"\n\nThe island has been owned by the Scott family for over 70 years. They farm it and run self-catering apartments, a cottage, and restaurant. They used to have a sign at the jetty saying, \"You are now entering Scott Country\".\n\nThe World Record for haggis hurling was held by Alan Pettigrew for over 20 years. He threw a 1 lb 8 oz haggis 180 feet, 10 inches on Inchmurrin in August 1984. However this was beaten when a new record was set at 217 feet by Lorne Coltart at the Milngavie Highland Games on 11 June 2011.\n\nAs well as offering self catered accommodation in the form of 3 flats and an 8-person cottage, the island has its own bar and restaurant, open from Easter to October. Inchmurrin is licensed to hold civil ceremonies.\n\nThere is a naturist camp in the north east of the island.\n\n\n"}

It was necessary to employ them in the postal service, as it was almost impossible for Christian letter carriers to deliver letters addressed in Hebrew. Another reason may have been the fact that the Jews, in their relations with the post, were subject to exceptional laws.\n\nThe only detailed notices of Jewish letter-carriers are furnished by the archives of Breslau and Frankfurt; but the position of the letter-carriers in these places was no doubt typical of their status elsewhere. The Jewish letter-carrier, or \"Post-Jude\" in Breslau, is first mentioned in a document dated December 13, 1722, which, however, allows the inference that the office had existed for many years before that date. It was maintained until the Silesian wars, after which time Breslau was no longer included in the imperial postal district of Habsburg.\n\nThe Jewish letter-carrier of Breslau, as he neither took any oath of office nor received any salary, was not really a government official. His whole income consisted merely of the postage paid by the recipients of the letters. As, however, there were no fixed postal rates, the amount received was so small that the letter-carrier had to pursue in addition some other occupation. That the postal authorities tolerated this state of affairs is shown by the fact that when the letter-carrier was absent on other business, his wife was allowed to take his place.\n\nThe first mention of a Jewish letter-carrier in Frankfurt am Main occurs in a decree dating from the middle of the eighteenth century, and setting forth the regulations which the Jews must observe in their relations with the Thurn and Taxis post; but in Frankfurt, too, the office had existed before that time. From 1748 until 1846 it was held by members of the same family, and it was abolished owing to altered conditions. The nephew and assistant of the Jews' letter-carrier who was then in office remained in the Thurn and Taxis service with the same rights and duties, and in 1867 was taken over into the Prussian service.\n\nIn Frankfurt, as in Breslau, the Jewish letter-carrier received no pay, but two kreutzers were collected from the addressee for every ordinary letter, and six kreutzers, for a registered letter. In proportion as international commerce developed and the Jewish interests increased, the income of the letter-carrier became correspondingly larger. The last incumbent of the office had a yearly income of 5,000 gulden, out of which, in very busy times, he had to pay his assistants 150 florins each. Besides, when other posts, such as that of Kassel, became united to that of Thurn and Taxis, he was required to pay Count Thurn and Taxis 400 gulden yearly. He ultimately retired on a pension of 1,600 florins.\n\n"}

The Type 97 designation was given to this gun as it was accepted in the year 2597 of the Japanese calendar (1937). It entered service in 1937. Japanese infantry units often are equipped with 81-mm mortars. The Type 97 81 mm mortar is very commonly used and is referred to by the Japanese as an \"Infantry Gun\", which breaks down into 3 sections for transport. The markings which appear on the base of the barrel read \"97 model small trench mortar.\"\n\nThe modified version used by Imperial Japanese Navy with designation Type 3 mortar was used by naval land forces and as anti-submarine weapon on escort ships since 1943.\n\nThe Type 97 is a smooth bore, muzzle-loading weapon. It has a fixed firing pin in the breech assembly, and the percussion of the propelling cartridge of the mortar shell against the firing pin propels the shell from the mortar. As many as six propellant increments can be attached to the fins of the mortar shell for the purpose of increasing the range. The mortar and its calibre had its origin as almost all 81.4 mm, 82 mm or \"8 cm\" mortars in the French Brandt mle 27 81.4 mm mortar. The improved version Brandt Mle 27/31 had become the basis for copies, near-copies and license-built mortars all over the world. The Brandt mortars themselves were evolved from the British Stokes Mortar of different calibre.\n\nA captured Type 97 mortar, which has been studied in detail, was marked \"Type 97 High-Angle Infantry Gun\". The weapon was manufactured in 1942 in the Osaka Army Arsenal. Although the Japanese weapon closely resembles the US 81-mm mortar, M1, there are several identifying features by which the two can be distinguished. The adjusting nut of the Japanese mortar is on the right bipod leg, while the sight is on the left. Other differences are the buttress-type threads on the traversing and elevating screws of the Japanese weapon, as well as the use of welding to fasten bipod legs to the clevis joint and grease fittings dissimilar to those used by the US model.\n\nThe collimator sight for the Type 97 Japanese mortar is heavier and more complicated than that utilized on the US 81-mm mortar Ml. The Japanese sight examined was made entirely of steel, except for the brass bushings used for the elevating and cross-leveling screws. A US M4 sight may be fitted to the Japanese weapon by shimming the sight bracket slightly.\n\nThe Type 97 mortar examined had an extension fitted to the sight, raising the latter to the level of the muzzle of the mortar. This extension probably was added to permit sighting of the weapon when it was deeply dug in or slightly in defilade. Elevation scale of the sight is graduated in 50-mil intervals from 700 to 1,600 mils, and a micrometer drum enables elevation readings to be made to the nearest mil. The collimator can be traversed in a full circle, and the azimuth scale is calibrated in 100-mil graduations in two sections of 3,200 mils each. As in the case of elevation, a micrometer drum permits azimuth readings to be made to the nearest mil. There is a throw-out lever for rapid traverse of the collimator, which may be placed at an angle of elevation and locked in position by a series of meshing notches. There are no open sights for rough laying of the piece.\n\nAmmunition recovered for the Type 97 thus far is usually the Type 00 (1940) HE shell. This shell is 12.87 inches long and weighs 6.93 pounds, 1 pound of which is the weight of the TNT filler. The fuze is of the instantaneous type, which can be set for delay action, however, by the insertion of a delay pellet in the fuze nose prior to firing. The shell can be fired in the US 81-mm mortar M1, but the range will be about 10 per cent shorter than achieved with the US M43 and M43A shells. A firing test of Japanese shells in the US 81-mm M1 weapon gave the following results that cannot be regarded as wholly conclusive in view of deterioration of the shells. The 81mm mortar was also used to launch an unusual AA Mine Discharger shell.\n\nSpecifications of the weapon are as follows:\n\n"}

Bird lice may feed on feathers, skin, or blood. They have no wings, and their biting mouth parts distinguish them from true lice, which suck blood.\nAlmost all domestic birds are hosts for at least one species of bird louse. Chickens and other poultry are attacked by many kinds of bird lice. Bird lice usually do not cause much harm to a bird unless it is unusually infested as in the case of birds with damaged bills which cannot preen themselves properly. A blood-consuming louse that infests Galápagos Hawks is more numerous on hawks without territories, possibly because those individuals spend more time looking for food and less time preening than hawks with territories.\n\nIn such cases, their irritation may cause the bird to damage itself by scratching. In extreme cases, the infestation may even interfere with egg production and the fattening of poultry. Unlike true lice, bird lice do not carry infectious diseases. Having coevolved with their specific host(s), phylogenetic relationships among bird lice are sometimes of use when trying to determine phylogenetic relationships among birds.\n\nEarlier all chewing lice were considered to form the paraphyletic order Mallophaga while the sucking lice were thought to form the order Anoplura. Recent reclassification (Clay, 1970) has combined these orders into the order Phthiraptera. The bird lice belong to two suborders, Amblycera and Ischnocera, although some members of these suborders do not parasitize birds and are therefore not bird lice.\n\nThe families which parasitize birds are:\n\n"}

During her tenure, the company moved all of its productions to Whitney Hall.\n\nIn January 2006, the company announced David Roth as its next general director. Roth served in the post until his July 2015 death in a car accident. Following interim leadership by William Blodgett, in 2016, Ian Derrer became the company's general director. He is scheduled to conclude his Kentucky Opera tenure in July 2018.\n\n"}
{"id": "2328452", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2328452", "title": "RAF Medmenham", "text": "RAF Medmenham\n\nRAF Medmenham was a Royal Air Force station based at Danesfield House near Medmenham, in Buckinghamshire, England. Activities there specialized in photographic intelligence, and it was once the home of the RAF Intelligence Branch. During the Second World War, RAF Medmenham was the main interpretation centre for photographic reconnaissance operations in the European and Mediterranean theatres.\n\nIn April 1941, an RAF photographic interpretation unit (PIU) moved to Danesfield House, Medmenham, as its previous location at Wembley was short of space, and was renamed the \"Central Interpretation Unit\" (CIU). Later that year the \"Bomber Command Damage Assessment Section\" was absorbed, and amalgamation was completed when the \"Night Photographic Interpretation Section\" of \"No 3 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit\", RAF Oakington, was integrated with CIU in February 1942 and the base was assigned the motto \"Serve and Support\".\n\nDuring 1942 and 1943, the CIU gradually expanded and was involved in the planning stages of practically every operation of the war, and in every aspect of intelligence. In 1945, daily intake of material averaged 25,000 negatives and 60,000 prints. By VE-day, the print library, which documented and stored worldwide cover, held 5,000,000 prints from which 40,000 reports had been produced.\n\nAmerican personnel had for some time formed an increasing part of the CIU and on 1 May 1944 this was finally recognised by changing the title of the unit to the \"Allied Central Interpretation Unit\" (ACIU). There were then over 1,700 personnel on the unit's strength. The title of the unit reverted to \"Central Interpretation Unit\" when the Americans returned home in August 1945.\n\nEarly in 1945, a number of photographic interpreters (PIs) were sent to join the \"British Bombing Research Mission\" in Paris to explore the degree of damage and production interruption caused by Allied bombing in the Resistance areas of the Massif Central and in the ports. They were also tasked with checking PI reports which were eventually related to assessment reports of attacks on German industry. Several PIs were also seconded to the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., to join a detachment of RAF and British Army officers.\n\nSpitfires, without any guns but with a maximum speed of 396 mph at 30,000 feet, were used for photo-reconnaissance missions. The aircraft were fitted with five cameras which were heated to ensure good results (while the cockpit was not). Another key aircraft was the Mosquito which had a cruising speed of 255 mph, maximum of 362 mph and a maximum altitude of 35,000 ft. Thirty-six million prints were made during the war, of which some 10 million, many in 3-D, still survive and are today kept in Edinburgh. A large number of photographic interpreters were recruited from the Hollywood Film Studios including Xavier Atencio. Dirk Bogarde was employed in the Army reconnaissance section as a visual inspector. Two renowned archaeologists also worked there as interpreters: Dorothy Garrod, the first woman to hold an Oxbridge Chair, and Glyn Daniel, who went on to gain popular acclaim as the host of the television game show \"Animal, Vegetable or Mineral?\". Up to 150 women were also employed as PIs.\n\nOf particular significance in the success of the work of Medmenham was the use of stereoscopic images, using a between plate overlap of exactly 60%. Having overcome the initial scepticism of Lord Cherwell to the possibility of the new rocket technology, major operations made possible by the work at Medmanham included, on 17 and 18 August 1943, an offensive against the V-2 rocket development plant at Peenemünde. Later offensives were also made against potential launch sites at Wizernes and 96 other launch sites in Northern France. It is claimed that Medmanham's greatest operational success was \"Operation Crossbow\" which, from 23 December 1943, destroyed the V-1 infrastructure in Northern France. One of the key PI's in the V-weapon detection period was Constance Babington Smith. Babington Smith was also responsible for the Allies' confirmation of the existence of the German Me 163 Komet rocket plane as well as evidence of the test flights of the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter, the scorched grass caused by the rocket and jet engines of both aircraft being visible in aerial photographs taken over Rechlin – \"The German equivalent of Farnborough\".\n\nWith the cessation of hostilities in Europe in May 1945 some sections closed almost immediately, whilst others worked on tasks for the Control Commission in Germany. The several Army sections of CIU were incorporated in September 1946 to become the \"Army Photographic Interpretation Centre (UK)\" (APIC (UK)).\n\nThe CIU was placed under the control of the newly established Central Photographic Establishment of RAF Coastal Command which had replaced the disbanded No. 106 Group RAF and the \"Joint Photographic Reconnaissance Committee\" (JPRC). In August 1947, the unit's name was changed yet again, this time to the \"Joint Air Photographic Intelligence Centre (UK)\" (JAPIC (UK)). In October 1947, APIC (UK) was renamed the \"Army Photographic Interpretation Unit (UK)\", (APIU (UK)) and, although it continued to operate within JAPIC (UK), had special responsibilities to the Director of Military Intelligence. The Officer Commanding APIU (UK) was also deputy commandant of JAPIC (UK).\n\nIn December 1953, the unit was given the title of the Joint Air Reconnaissance Intelligence Centre (United Kingdom), (JARIC (UK)). The personnel of APIU (UK) were absorbed into the establishment of the joint service unit and the Army has continued to provide a number of PIs and supporting staffs in the JARIC establishment. JARIC moved in 1957 from its base at RAF Nuneham Park, near Oxford, to RAF Brampton. In 2012 JARIC was renamed Defence Geospatial Intelligence Fusion Centre (DGIFC) and moved to the other side of Huntingdon to RAF Wyton in 2013.\n\nThe \"Joint School of Photographic Interpretation\" (JSPI) at RAF Chicksands – where PIs for all three British services are now trained – has recently been renamed 'Medmenham Training Wing' in honour of the unit's heritage with Medmenham.\n\nIn 1952, 591 Signals Unit moved to RAF Medmenham from RAF Wythall and stayed until 1955 when it moved to RAF Digby, its current location. It was during its stay at Medmenham that the unit's crest was conceived; a kingfisher watching over the river (Thames), representing the unit's watch over the integrity and security of RAF communications.\n\nOn 3 November 1958, RAF Signals Command (motto: \"Aetherem Vincere\" – \"To conquer the upper air\") was formed at Medmenham by raising No. 90 Group RAF to Command status under Air Vice Marshal Leslie Dalton-Morris. It was a relatively short-lived Command, lasting only until 1 January 1969, when it was absorbed by Strike Command and reduced to Group status. It had five Air Officers Commanding in Chief during its existence.\n\nDuring the Second World War, an organisation known as the \"Post Design Services\" (PDS) was formed at the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE), Malvern, Worcestershire, to provide a direct link between the designers of electronic equipment in the laboratories and the service users in the field. The organisation was manned by civilian scientists (\"boffins\") and serving officers and worked predominantly in the fields of airborne radar and ground-controlled interception (GCI).\n\nIn 1946, PDS was disbanded and a successor organisation, the \"Radio Introduction Branch\" (RIB), was formed at RAF Medmenham. In 1952, the RIB was renamed as \"Radio Introduction Unit\" (RIU) and became responsible for the introduction into service of all airborne and ground radio systems. The unit had a complement of ten officers dealing with airfield approach aids, airborne tail warning, Doppler navigation, weapon aiming and airborne interception for aircraft such as the Javelin, Brigand, Valetta, Venom and Meteor. The unit moved to RAF Benson in 1977.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2328454", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2328454", "title": "McCartney II", "text": "McCartney II\n\nMcCartney II is the second solo studio album by English musician Paul McCartney, released on 16 May 1980. It was recorded mostly alone by McCartney at his home studio in 1979 shortly before the dissolution of his band Wings in 1981. The album is a significant departure for McCartney, as much of it relies heavily on synthesizers and studio experimentation, while its music style ranges from synth-pop and new wave to electronica.\n\nThe album was initially released to mostly unfavourable reviews by critics, though reception has been more positive over the years and the album has become a cult favourite.\n\nAfter the release of what turned out to be Wings' final album, \"Back to the Egg\", McCartney went north to his farm in Scotland to begin some private recordings in July 1979. \"Check My Machine\" samples dialogue from the 1957 \"Merrie Melodies\" cartoon featuring Tweety and Sylvester entitled \"Tweet Zoo\". By sessions' end, he had recorded over 20 songs. With no immediate use for the recordings, he put them aside for the time being and returned to work with Wings to prepare for a UK tour that November and December. Simultaneously with the performances (which included the new \"Coming Up\"), McCartney released his first solo single since 1971, the Christmas-themed \"Wonderful Christmastime\", backed with \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reggae\", which charted at No. 6 in the UK but only No. 83 in the US. The A-side was recorded during the \"McCartney II\" sessions, while its flip side had been cut in 1975. However, upcoming events were about to change McCartney's plans with Wings.\n\nAfter years of visa refusals due to his past arrests for marijuana possession, Japan had finally allowed McCartney, and thus Wings, to perform. It would be the first instance McCartney had performed in the country since he had done so with the Beatles in 1966, and anticipation was running high with Wings' tour completely sold out. However, upon his arrival in Tokyo on 16 January 1980, a search of McCartney's luggage revealed a bag containing 219 grams of marijuana, prompting his immediate arrest and eventually cancelling the tour. After a nine-day jail stay, McCartney was released and returned home to his Scottish farm. Deciding to put Wings on hold while he contemplated his future, he now decided to issue his solo recordings from the previous summer.\n\n\"McCartney II\" was named in follow-up to his debut album \"McCartney\" (1970) because McCartney plays all instruments on both albums; he has also since stated that he had specifically hired a 16-track machine and \"a couple of microphones\" with which to record this album, adding that he had himself alternately played the drums used in several recording in either the kitchen or bathroom in order to achieve the echo he sought on particular songs.\n\nFeaturing arrangements that are heavy on synthesisers, \"McCartney II\" has been said to represent McCartney's \"acceptance of new wave,\" and has been described as \"airless proto-electronica.\" The album is often experimental, with most of its songs having been described as strange \"eccentric synthpop\". Although McCartney denies any direct influences on the album, he admired the \"eccentricity\" and \"not-mainstream attitude\" of Talking Heads' David Byrne.\nMcCartney was also inspired by experimental composers John Cage, Cornelius Cardew and Luciano Berio; McCartney explained: \"I went to their concerts in London because I had plenty of time on my hands so it was the kind of thing I would go and see. Again, just to see what it was about, not necessarily because I was a massive fan. It was more like: what is a prepared piano? Oh, that's what it is. You know, funky stuff like that.\"\n\nAccording to Stephen Dalton of \"The Quietus\", parts of the album are reminiscent of krautrock and \"the whole post-punk disco boom\", and described most of the album as \"an alluringly weird mash-up of trip-hop, Krautrock and synth-pop.\" McCartney said that, \"rather than me emulating anyone, it was more a question of me seeing what I could do with it. And again, not necessarily thinking I was making an album, just to have some time to experiment. These days I would say that with The Fireman project. So I've always been into that – if you go from 'Tomorrow Never Knows' through \"McCartney I\", \"McCartney II\", The Fireman…\" Many of the most synthesised tracks are instrumentals which have been described as ambient; journalist Stephen Thomas Erlewine compared them \"to a sprightly variation\" of the instrumentals from the second side of \"Low\" (1977) by David Bowie, albeit with a warmer, less menacing sound.\n\nLead single \"Coming Up\" – an uplifting dance number – appeared that April with a video (Paul playing all the bandmates, dubbed 'The Plastic Macs', except for the backing singers (played by Linda)) and with two B-sides by Wings: \"Coming Up (Live at Glasgow)\", recorded during Wings' December 1979 show there, and the piano laden instrumental \"Lunch Box/Odd Sox\" (a \"Venus and Mars\" outtake). An immediate UK No. 2 hit, \"Coming Up\" was flipped over for the live Wings version in the US where it became another No. 1 for McCartney, greatly raising hopes for his first solo album proper in years. The live Wings version of \"Coming Up\" was also included as a one-sided 7-inch single in copies of \"McCartney II\" within the US and Canada.\n\n\"Temporary Secretary\" features frantic synthesizer lines and lyrics about requiring a secretary of any skill level for a short period of time. McCartney dubbed the song an \"experiment,\" saying that he found the concept of a temporary secretary humorous. \"Temporary Secretary\" was released as a 12\" single in Britain, backed with the experimental non-album track \"Secret Friend.\" Author Howard Sounes thought it a \"sexy\" track. The single was only released in a quantity of 25,000 copies, failing to make an impact on the charts. The single artwork was created by Jeff Cummins of Hipgnosis. The song was performed live for the first time at the London O2 Arena on 23 May 2015.\n\n\"McCartney II\" was released in mid-May to mostly negative reviews. Many critics found the album, with its experimental, synth-based compositions and its handful of instrumentals, slight. \"Record World\" magazine described the album as \"arguably the least well-received solo work of any Beatle\".\n\nIn the UK the album debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart, McCartney's first number-one since \"Venus and Mars\" in 1975 and EMI reported the album was on track to equal the sales of \"Band on the Run\". The second single from the album, \"Waterfalls\", was also successful in the UK, reaching number nine in the singles chart. In the US, initial sales were strong based on the strength of the hit single \"Coming Up\" and the album reached number three in its second week on the \"Billboard\" album chart where it remained for five weeks. \"Waterfalls\" went virtually unnoticed in the US, only \"bubbling under\" the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 at number 106 for one week. The album quickly dropped down the charts and was off the \"Billboard\" chart after 19 weeks, McCartney's shortest run since \"Wild Life\" and it was one of McCartney's lowest-selling albums in the US to date.\n\nThe initial issue of this album on compact disc featured \"Check My Machine\" and \"Secret Friend\" as bonus tracks. The two songs were originally released as the B-sides of \"Waterfalls\" and \"Temporary Secretary\", respectively. In 1993, \"McCartney II\" was remastered and reissued on CD as part of \"The Paul McCartney Collection\" series with Wings' 1979 hit \"Goodnight Tonight\" added as a third bonus track.\n\nWhen the new remastered version was released on 13 June 2011 as part of the \"Paul McCartney Archive Collection\", the album re-entered the UK charts at number 108.\n\nIn 2003, \"Mojo\" placed the album at number 26 on their list of the \"Top 50 Eccentric Albums\". In 2011, \"NME\" included the album on their list of \"101 Albums to Hear Before You Die,\" whose list entries were selected by different musicians; \"McCartney II\" was picked by Austin Williams of Swim Deep.\n\nIn 2018, \"Pitchfork\" ranked it at number 186 in their list of \"The 200 Best Albums of the 1980s\". They called it a \"strange, guileless wisp of a synth-pop record\" and wrote that although \"[o]riginally derided as a novelty, \"McCartney II\" is now remarkable in its prescience of the lo-fi and bedroom pop movements.\"\n\n\"McCartney II\" was described as an influence on Hot Chip's album \"Made in the Dark\" (2008), especially with songs like \"Wrestlers\", \"Bendable Poseable\", \"Whistle for Will\" and \"We're Looking for a Lot of Love\". \"Now There Is Nothing\" from the band's later album \"In Our Heads\" (2012) has been described as a homage to \"McCartney II\", with their guitarist Al Doyle explaining the song has \"quite deliberately quirky time signature changes and key changes and these sort of very wandering harmonies — very typical of that period and McCartney productions.\" Alexis Taylor of the group has described \"McCartney II\" as one of his favourite albums of all time. The album has also been championed by multiple other musicians such as disc jockey Erol Alkan, Chris Carter of Throbbing Gristle, Gruff Rhys of Super Furry Animals and Ty Bulmer of New Young Pony Club.\n\nThe \"crystalline keyboard motif\" in the intro of \"Frozen Jap\" was described as predicting Kraftwerk's 1981 song \"Computer Love\".\n\"Temporary Secretary\", meanwhile, although dismissed or ignored by critics at the time of release, has more recently acquired a cult following \"as a futuristic milestone in early British electronica\" and is considered a \"cult techno-pop classic.\" In Brazil, the song \"Check My Machine\" became a cult in the Samba rock scene in the 80s.\n\nAll songs written by Paul McCartney.\n\nIn 2011 the album was re-issued by Hear Music/Concord Music Group as part of the second set of releases, alongside \"McCartney\", in the \"Paul McCartney Archive Collection\". It was released in various formats:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n"}

{"id": "2328475", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2328475", "title": "Public Storage", "text": "Public Storage\n\nPublic Storage is an American international self storage company headquartered in Glendale, California, that is run as a real estate investment trust (REIT). It is the largest brand of self-storage services in the US. In 2008, it was the largest of four publicly traded storage REITs. There are more than 2,200 Public Storage self-storage locations in the US, Canada and Europe. It also owns 42 percent of an office parks subsidiary, sells packing supplies, and provides other services. As a REIT, it is owned by real estate investors, who receive more than 90 percent of the company's profits as a return-on-investment.\n\nPublic Storage Inc. was founded in 1972 by B. Wayne Hughes and Kenneth Volk Jr. It grew to 1,000 locations by 1989, using funding from investors in real estate limited partnerships (RELPs). The private company was re-structured as a publicly traded REIT in 1995, when Storage Equities merged with Public Storage and adopted its name. In 2006 it acquired Shurgard Storage Centers in a $5.5 billion transaction. Shurgard has since been spun-out in to a separate publicly traded entity, with Public Storage retaining 36.6% of the company.\n\nThe idea for Public Storage was conceived by Southern California real estate developer B. Wayne Hughes in the early 1970s. During a trip to Texas, he observed that local real estate developers were doing well creating mini-storage facilities outside of Dallas and Houston; he brought the self-storage concept back with him to California. Hughes partnered with Kenneth Volk and the two founded Public Storage in August 1972 with a $50,000 initial investment, at first calling it \"Private Storage Spaces Inc.\"\n\nThe first warehouse was built in 1972 in El Cajon, California. According to Hughes, \"Private Storage Spaces Inc.\" confused people into thinking it was private, so the name was changed to \"Public Storage\" to match the PS acronym. The founders initially planned to build the storage warehouses as a temporary source of income until the land became more valuable and could be redeveloped for another use.\n\nWithin three months, the first location was breaking even with a 35 percent occupancy. The units were rented for a similar price per square foot as apartments or office space, but cost 35 to 50 percent less to build and maintain. A property management subsidiary called Public Storage Management Inc. was formed in 1973. By 1974, 20 locations had been built.\n\nHughes disliked loans, so he financed the purchase and development of new properties primarily through real estate limited partnerships (RELPs). At first, Public Storage built warehouses and sold them to independent RELPs for a development fee. The company's own RELP, called Public Storage Partners Ltd, was formed in 1975 and closed its first deal for $3 million in investments two years later. Public Storage paid cash to acquire property and build a self-storage facility, then used the property's income to pay investors back and earn a portion as profit. Public Storage Inc. also earned revenues from a portion of each deal that was made.\n\nEarly investors earned three to four times their money back due to increasing property values in Southern California, high occupancy rates, and increasing storage rental prices. By the mid-1980s, Public Storage was raising $200 to $300 million in investments each year. The RELP format allowed the firm to continue building more locations in the 1970s and 1980s when most of the industry had halted growth because of higher interest rates on loans. In the mid-1980s, co-founder Volk retired and his interest in Public Storage was purchased by Hughes. \"Forbes\" estimated that by this time the company was worth $800 million.\n\nInvestment funding was used to build mini-storage warehouses beyond California, targeting the 39 largest US cities. The firm opened self-storage locations in close proximity to each other, so the sites could share a development office, and justify local television advertising. The firm's growth slowed in the mid-1980s as new competition increased the cost of property and slowed the increase in rental prices to consumers. Poor weather and difficult labor markets outside of California delayed development projects; the company also made poor investments in office parks. Interest in real estate investing also diminished.\n\nBy the late 1980s, the company opened its 1,000th Public Storage location and the company was three times larger than its nearest competitor in the US market. By 1989, $2.7 billion had been invested from 200,000 investors. Public Storage helped popularize the use of self-storage businesses as a real estate investment vehicle and became one of the longest-running RELP investment vehicles. By 1991, Public Storage had set up more than 150 RELPs and real estate investment trusts (REITs).\n\nAccording to \"Financial World\", by 1989 the real estate limited partnership (RELP) market that Public Storage relied on for funding \"all but vanished\". A book by Public Storage Inc. said the Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduced the tax benefits of RELPs and was followed by \"a tough time for real estate companies.\" In December 1990, five of its partnerships were converted to Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) in December. It also began consolidating its partnerships and acquiring many of the companies in which it held an interest.\n\nStorage Equities was founded by Public Storage in 1980 to purchase self-storage facilities. It was one of 17 self-storage REITs that Public Storage held an interest in. Between 1992 and 1995, Storage Equities paid Public Storage $31 million in management and consulting fees. In 1995, Public Storage and its subsidiaries were merged with its self-storage REIT, Storage Equities Inc., and re-structured as a single REIT called Public Storage Inc. One analyst said the acquisition capitalized on conflict of interest concerns, while Hughes said the merger was set up to alleviate them.\n\nIn 1995, the company spun-off its box, locks, and packing and moving supplies business into the PS Orangeco subsidiary; Public Storage said this was done to avoid the risk of losing the company's tax-free REIT status if too large a portion of the company's business is no longer related to real estate. This frustrated institutional investors that can only invest in real estate companies and could no longer invest in the new non-real estate subsidiaries. By 1998, Public Storage had $141 million in quarterly revenues, $2 billion in assets and 1,200 facilities in 38 states. Later that year, Public Storage acquired a competing storage company called Storage Trust Realty in a $600 million transaction.\n\nPublic Storage grew steadily in the early 2000s and was added to the S&P 500 in 2005. In 2006 it acquired Shurgard Storage Centers in a transaction totaling $5.5 billion, acquiring 624 locations, including 141 in Europe. Public Storage had attempted to acquire the company in 2000 and again in 2005, but its offers were rejected. The company has continued to make numerous acquisitions, such as a March 2010 purchase of 30 locations from A-American Self Storage.\n\nPublic Storage is the largest self-storage brand in the US. As of 2014, there were 2,250 Public Storage locations in North America and 193 locations in Europe; European locations are operated by Shurgard Europe, which Public Storage owns 49 percent of. There are also 2,546 office parks operated by PS Business Parks, which Public Storage owns a 42 percent interest in. The largest self-storage business in Canada is operated by a separate company that is allowed to use the Public Storage brand.\n\nSelf-storage locations tend to be in dense clusters in major cities, especially near freeways and intersections. Public Storage has very few employees for a company of its size. Customer access to each storage location is automated. Some locations have a husband-wife couple that live on-site and are paid close to minimum wage to monitor the facility.\n\nThe contents of a storage unit are put up for auction if the rental fees are not paid for sixty days. Although the TV show \"Storage Wars\" created increased interest in the auctions, most units do not contain anything of substantial economic value. Sometimes auctioning the renter's property can result in disputes between Public Storage and the renter. In 2007, a customer's belongings were auctioned for non-payment while he was serving the US military in Iraq. After receiving negative publicity, Public Storage apologized and gave him $8,000 as compensation for his sold belongings.\n\nIn 2005, Public Storage said in a public filing that there had been \"an increasing number of claims and litigation against owners and managers of rental properties relating to moisture infiltration, which can result in mold or other property damage.\" The company's rental contract says it is not responsible for the storage unit's contents, even if damage is caused by defects in the unit, and \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported that there were \"surprisingly few remedies\" for theft or property damage at self-storage facilities.\n\nMany Public Storage customers have filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau regarding insurance policies sold by Public Storage representatives, after experiencing burglaries of their storage units then having their insurance claims denied. Investigative journalists from TV news stations in California, Kansas, and Washington have reported on difficulties consumers had when filing insurance claims for burglaries with Willis and The New Hampshire Insurance Company, which are affiliated with Public Storage. For example, claims have been denied because the storage unit had an intact lock; affiliated insurance companies cited insufficient evidence of forced entry, though burglars often replace the unit's lock in an attempt to conceal the burglary. Insurance commissioners in two states have criticized the practices of insurance companies affiliated with Public Storage. An ongoing class action lawsuit alleges Public Storage misleads consumers into thinking that insurance premiums are charged at cost, whereas a substantial amount of those premiums are retained as profits by Public Storage. Sales of these insurance policies do have a high profit, but generate less than five percent of the company's total revenue.\n\nPublic Storage is a \"self-administered, self-managed\" real estate investment trust (REIT). A REIT is an organization that primarily purchases and operates real estate investments and returns at least 90 percent of its incomes to investors. It combines the capital of a large number of investors for real estate projects. As of 2008, Public Storage was the largest of four publicly traded self-storage REITs. As of 2013, it had a profit margin of 50 percent, the third-highest in the S&P 500. Public Storage has risen 17% annually, including dividends over the past 20 years (as of Q1 2016). This is a growth rate which is double the S&P 500.\n\nMore than 90 percent of Public Storage's revenues are from its self-storage operations; it also provides insurance, packing products, and has a 44 percent interest in PS Business Parks. In 1984, PS Reinsurance was formed to sell insurance for a storage unit's contents. In 1995, PS Orangeco was created as a subsidiary, selling boxes, packaging, truck rentals, and other moving supplies.\n\nRonald L. Havner, Jr., then-CEO of Public Storage, earned $10.5 million in 2017, 439 times the salary of his company's median worker.\n"}

(JPC) was an American publishing company founded in November 1942 by African-American businessman John H. Johnson. It was headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. JPC was privately held and run by Johnson until his death in 2005. Led by its flagship publication, \"Ebony\", Johnson Publishing was at one time the largest African-American–owned publishing firm in the United States. JPC also published \"Jet\", a weekly magazine, from November 1951 until June 2014, when it became digital only. The company's last chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) was the founder's daughter, Linda Johnson-Rice. In its final years, Johnson Publishing Company sold off assets including its historic 820 S. Michigan Avenue headquarters in 2011, and its publications in 2016. In April 2019, JPC filed for liquidation, ending the company's 76-year run. The historic Ebony/Jet photo archives, which JPC retained after the sale of its \"Ebony\" and \"Jet\" magazines, were sold in July 2019 for $30 million to a group of art and educational foundations to make them available to the public.\n\n Johnson Publishing Company was founded in 1942 by John Harold Johnson, who was working as an office clerk for Chicago-based Supreme Life Insurance Company of America. Using money from a $500 loan he secured off his mother's furniture, Johnson mailed $2 charter subscription offers to members who had life insurance through Supreme Life. In return, He received more than 3,000 completed subscription offers and with the money from that he printed his first publication, \"Negro Digest\", in November 1942. By mid-1943, the monthly circulation of Negro Digest had reached 50,000 copies.\n\n820 S. Michigan Avenue, the iconic building constructed for the Johnson Publishing Company, publishers of Ebony and Jet magazines was designed by John Moutoussamy, was the first African American owned building in Chicago's downtown area. It remains the only Chicago high-rise to be designed by an African American.\n\nJohnson Publishing had several locations throughout its history. The first, which served as its headquarters from 1942 until 1943, was inside the Supreme Life Building at 3501 S. Parkway Ave (later renamed Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive). As the company grew, Johnson then purchased a building at 5619 S. State Street in 1943. Six years later, in 1949, it relocated to 1820 South Michigan Avenue, a former funeral home. In December 1971, the company moved to 820 S. Michigan. \n\nIn the Fall of 2017, the City of Chicago designated the Johnson Building as a city landmark. Shortly thereafter, 3L Real Estate, a developer that specializes in the repurposing of classic real estate, bought the former headquarters from Columbia College Chicago and converted the office space into 150 rental apartments.   \n\nThe iconic, psychedelic Ebony Test Kitchen, used by that magazine's food editors to test recipes, was donated by 3L Real Estate to Landmarks Illinois which in turn transferred it to New York’s Museum of Food and Drink. The original Ebony/Jet sign which sits atop the building has been preserved and serves both as a welcome sign from the air and an anchor for the rooftop deck with sweeping views of Grant Park, Lake Michigan and Chicago's Museum Campus. \n\n3L Real Estate CEO Joe Slezak said it was important to maintain original features when possible and worked with interior designer Elizabeth Watters to keep subtle reminders of the initial decor designed by Arthur Elrod and William Raiser. \"From the lobby, with large swaths of original wood wall paneling, to ottomans reupholstered using material (curtains/rugs) from the Johnson Publishing days, the vibe is oh so ’70s.\"\n\nIn the early 1970s, the company's staff consisted of 300 people; 175 of them were located at the Chicago headquarters while the others worked at branch offices in Los Angeles, New York City, and Washington D.C. Johnson's family held roles within the company. His wife, Eunice W. Johnson, was the founder, secretary, treasurer, and director of the Ebony Fashion Fair. His son, John H. Johnson Jr., served as a staff photographer for both Ebony and Jet magazines from 1975 until his death in December 1981. Johnson's daughter Linda Johnson-Rice served as fashion coordinator of the Ebony Fashion Fair before becoming the company's CEO in 2003.\n\nJohnson once stated, \"I wasn't trying to make history, I was trying to make money.\" According to media historian, Brenna Wynn Greer, he managed to do both. His publications both filled a niche in the market and \"forever changed the popular representation of African Americans.\" It portrayed African Americans as they saw themselves. Its photographs created for photojournalism made history.\n\nIn 1942, The company published their first magazine, \"Negro Digest\". \"Negro Digest\", which was modeled after the Reader's Digest was published from November 1942 until 1951 when it was discontinued in favor of \"Ebony\" and \"Jet\" magazines. The magazine returned to circulation in June 1961 and was later renamed \"Black World\" in 1970. Under the new name, the magazine was published for six years until it was canceled again in 1976. The company began publishing Ebony magazine in November 1945. \"Ebony\" focused on the African American community, culture, and achievements. The magazine quickly became successful, at one time gaining more than 1.3 million readers. After the instant success of \"Ebony\", Johnson created another publication, named \"Jet\" in 1951. \"Jet\", dubbed \"The Weekly Negro News Magazine\", was a mini-size weekly magazine that featured African American entertainers, community issues, public figures and a woman (predominately black) featured as \"Jet's Beauty of the Week\". Beginning in 2011, \"Jet\" magazine went from a weekly publication to bi-weekly, later converting into digital only in July 2014; publishing its last print magazine in June 2014. The company operated a book division, which published books such as \"The New Ebony Cookbook\" and the more controversial \"\".\n\nThe company produced the film \"The Secret of Selling the Negro Market\", which was released in 1954. The film was designed to encourage advertisers to promote their products and services in the African-American media.\n\nThe company produced \"Ebony/Jet Celebrity Showcase\", a spinoff television show from the two magazines. The show debuted on August 1, 1982. It was eventually pulled off the air because Johnson H. Johnson was dissatisfied with the quality of the guests. \"Ebony/Jet Showcase\", a weekly, nationally syndicated TV show hosted by Greg Gumbel and Deborah Crable debuted in September 1985.\nBy the show's third year in 1987, it became the only Black-syndicated program to reach 92 percent of Black U.S television households and 73 percent of U.S. television households, strengthening its position as the No. 1 Black-oriented interview and entertainment show. The last episode of the program aired in October 1993.\n\nFor over 40 years beginning in 1958, The company hosted the Ebony Fashion Fair, a traveling fashion show started by Eunice W. Johnson. The show raised money for scholarships and charities in cities across the United States and Canada. The fashion fair held its last show in 2009 due to the illness and later death of Johnson. In addition, Johnson Publishing produces a line of cosmetics marketed to women of color. Named Fashion Fair Cosmetics, The line was founded in 1973 and at one time was available in over 2,500 stores across the world. A United Kingdom creditor petitioned a judge to force the company to sell its Fashion Fair Cosmetics UK assets in April 2019.\n\nAside from the publications, Johnson Publishing Company purchased WGRT radio station in May 1973 for $1.8 million from Atlass Communications Inc. The company later renamed the station WJPC and began broadcasting on November 1, 1973. WJPC was the first Black-owned radio station in Chicago. WJPC-FM, a predominately R&B and soul station operated from November 1973 until it was sold in December 1994.\nIn May 2009, R.R. Donnelley & Sons Company, which printed Ebony and Jet magazines, had taken out a mortgage against the company's headquarters due to its nonpayment of the magazine's printing bill. The mortgage totaled near $12 million. In July 2011, it was announced that JPMorgan was to become a partner in the company. Then-CEO Desiree Rogers stated that they hold a 'minority stake' and presence on the board.\n\nIn January 2011, the company sold its headquarters of nearly 40 years located at 820 S. Michigan Avenue to Columbia College Chicago. In November 2017, The building was later sold by the college to 3L Real Estate for $10 million and was converted into luxury apartments named 820Michigan. The real estate company stated that Johnson Publishing Company's logo along with its former flagship publication names will remain located on top of the building.\n\nIn March 2015, the company offered the Ebony/Jet photo archives, which span more than 70 years, for sale. The move was made to reduce some of the company's debt. In addition, in June 2016, the company announced the sale of its publications \"Ebony\" and \"Je\"t magazines. The buyer, Clear View Group, a private equity firm based in Austin, Texas, created a new publisher called Ebony Media Corp. The publications concerning the specialty cosmetics business and fashion were retained by Johnson.\n\nOn April 9, 2019, the company filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy liquidation in a U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Chicago, Illinois. The company amount of creditors was listed between 200 and 999. The assets and liabilities listed for the company was between $10 million and $50 million. The company released a statement on their bankruptcy fillings:\n\nThis decision was not easy, nor should it have been. Johnson Publishing Company is an iconic part of American and African American history since our founding in 1942, and the company's impact on society cannot be overstated.\n\nOn April 22, 2019, Mellody Hobson, president of Chicago-based Ariel Investments, and her husband, film maker George Lucas, petitioned to take possession of the Ebony photo archives. They stated that the collection was used as collateral on a $12 million loan that Johnson Publishing received from Capital Holdings V firm, which is owned by Hobson and Lucas, in 2015. In July 2019 as part of the bankruptcy proceedings, the more than 4 million item \"Ebony\" and \"Jet\" archives were auctioned off in Chicago. Winning the week-long auction was the $30 million bid by a consortium of foundations led by the J. Paul Getty Trust, with co-purchasers the Ford Foundation, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. The archives will go to the Getty Research Institute and the National Museum of African American History and Culture to be made digitally available to the public.\n\nIn January 2020 Johnson Publishing Co auctioned off its art collection, the last of its major assets. The 87-piece collection included works by Carrie Mae Weems, Henry Ossawa Tanner, Dindga McCannon and Walter J. Williams. The lot earned just under three million dollars.\n\nIn 2010, Chicago Public Schools and Noble Network of Charter Schools opened Johnson College Prep, a public charter high school in Chicago's Englewood neighborhood which was named in honor of John H. and Eunice Johnson.\n\nThe Chicago History Museum created an exhibition titled \"Inspiring Beauty: 50 Years Of Ebony Fashion Fair\", which was on display from March 2013 until May 2014. The exhibition traveled around the country, including stops at the Museum of Design Atlanta and the Milwaukee Art Museum.\n\nThe Rebuild Foundation held an exhibition for the company called \"A Johnson Publishing Story\" at The Stony Island Arts Bank in Chicago, Illinois. The exhibition, which featured paintings, books, sculptures, furnishings and interior design elements from the 820 S. Michigan Avenue headquarters ran from June 28, 2018 until September 30, 2018. In 2018, An exhibition called \"The Black Image Corporation\" featured photos from the company's archives. The exhibition, which was held at the Martin-Gropius-Bau in Berlin ran from 2018 until July 28, 2019.\n\nThe history of Johnson Publishing Company is featured in Bayer Mack's 2019 documentary, \"\", that chronicles the rise and decline of the black-owned ethnic beauty industry.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The town was renamed \"Kralendijk\" by the Dutch colonial rulers in about 1840.\n\nOn May 10, 1940, 461 Dutch and German citizens were transported to Bonaire and interned in a camp just south of the fort. After World War II, this camp was converted into a hotel, which is now the Divi Bonaire.\n\nKralendijk has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen \"BSh\") with uniformly hot, humid but dry weather due to the divergence between the trade winds and the North American Monsoon, along with a strong drying effect from winds parallel to the coast of South America. There is a short rainy season between October and January due to stronger northeasterly flow during the retreat of the monsoon; however it is erratic and heavily influenced by the Southern Oscillation, frequently failing completely during El Niño years. During La Niña years, however, rainfall may reach up to over a year and over in a month as happened during 1970/1971, 1988/1989, 1999/2000 and 2010/2011.\nThe Tourism Corporation Bonaire has a \"Historical Walking Tour\" brochure that lists 25 historical sites in the downtown area:\nIn addition to the stores on the main street (Kaya Grandi), there is a large food market (Cultimara) and a bakery (Exito) on Kaya L.D.

It connects the Mukhavets River (a tributary of the Bug River) and the Pina River (a tributary of the Pripyat River). \n\nOriginally the canal was named the Royal Canal (), after the King of Poland Stanisław August Poniatowski (), who initiated its construction. It forms an important part of the transportation artery linking the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea. The total length of the canal system from Brest to Pinsk is 196 km (122 mi), including the artificial waterway 105 km (65 mi) long. The canal system comprises:\n\n\nThe drainage area of the canal system totals 8,500 km² (3,300 mi²).\n\nCanal building flourished in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in the late 18th century. Yet many of the early canals are no longer in active service, having been superseded by railroads and highways. The Dnieper–Bug Canal after several enlargements is still providing a convenient inland waterway. Until the 18th century there was a portage between Kobrin and Pinsk as it was a part of the important long-distance trade route from the Black Sea to the Baltic Sea. The names of the Voloka River and the village of Mukhovloki near Kobrin reflect the existence of the ancient portage. People settled along the portage route since ancient times (Trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks). \n\nIn the mid-17th century, Jerzy Ossoliński, Crown Court Treasurer of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was the first to suggest the idea of upgrading the portage to a canal with locks. Yet the work started only 120 years later. In 1770, the canal was planned by the prominent cartographer Franciszek Florian Czaki.\n\nThe canal was built in 1775-1784 during the reign of Stanisław August Poniatowski, the last king of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Originally it was named Kanał Królewski (), after the Polish king, since he was the initiator of the project. Additional work was carried out starting in 1837 by the Russian Empire and completed around 1846-1848. To supply the canal system with water, mainly the canal pound, Beloozerski and Orekhovski watercourses were started in 1839 and completed in 1843. The number of movable weirs between Brest and Pinsk reached 22. As a result, the canal became navigable for bigger vessels, steamers at any time from spring till autumn. In 1847, the Kanał Królewski was renamed the \"Dneprovo-Bugski Canal\".\n\nAfter the construction of the railway along the canal in the late 19th century the canal was used mostly for rafting lumber, exported to western countries. During World War I, the canal was not in use.\n\nDuring the 1920s, it was partly rebuilt anew for the Riverine Flotilla of the Polish Navy (), better known as the \"Pinsk Flotilla\". The Flotilla was the inland branch of the Polish Navy operating in the area of the Pinsk Marshes between the Polish-Bolshevik War and World War II. During the 1920s, two locks were built. \n\nIn 1940, the Soviet authorities initiated a large-scale reconstruction of the canal. A 23 km (14 mi) long stretch of the canal was built near Kobrin to straighten the old canal. Eight locks were built replacing movable weirs.\n\nNavigation on the Dnieper–Bug Canal is interrupted by weirs on the rivers Mukhavets and Bug near Brest, Belarus, the border town. That is the only place that makes impossible, for the time being, the navigation from Western Europe to Belarus and Ukraine through inland waterways. The waterways from the German-Polish border (Oder River, through the Warta, Brda and Noteć rivers, Bydgoszcz Canal, Vistula River, Narew River, Bug River) once used to link the Belarus and Ukrainian inland waterways via Mukhavets River, Dnieper–Bug Canal, Pripyat River and Dnieper River), thus connecting north-western Europe with the Black Sea.\n\nRecently the dam in the Bug, making it impossible for ships to pass, has led to a considerable neglect of the most western part of the Mukhavets; some of the locks have been filled in and Brest Harbor can only be reached by vessels approaching from the east.\n\nMore recently efforts have been undertaken to restore the canal to a class IV inland waterway of international importance. In 2003 the Government of the Republic of Belarus adopted the inland water transport and sea transport development program to rebuild the Dnieper–Bug Canal shipping locks to meet the standards of a class Va European waterway. According to the Belarus government (see report below), four sluice dams and one shipping lock have been rebuilt which allow for the passage of vessels 110 meters (361 ft) long, 12 meters (39 ft) wide with a draught of 2.2 meters (7 ft). It is expected that reconstruction will continue over the next few years.\n\n"}

It was named after Olata Ouae Utina (fl. 1565), a leading chief of the now-extinct Utina tribe of Timucua Indians who occupied the territory along the middle reaches of the St. Johns River in Florida near the present-day site of St. Augustine, Florida.\n\nThe \"Utina\" was laid down on 6 June 1945 at Charleston, South Carolina, by the Charleston Shipbuilding & Drydock Company; launched on 31 August 1945; sponsored by Mrs. Jonathan Yerkes; and commissioned at the Charleston Navy Yard, on 30 January 1946, Lt. A. J. Vetro in command.\n\nSince commissioning, the major portion of \"Utina\"'s long Navy career was spent in the western Atlantic Ocean and in the West Indies. She carried out a variety of towing missions, helping damaged ships into port, towing decommissioned ships to berthing areas, towing targets for gunnery exercises, and the like. Throughout her active career, \"Utina\" was closely associated with the American naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Right after commissioning, she conducted her shakedown training out of that port, and when she completed it, Guantanamo Bay became her home port for over five years. In 1951, she was reassigned to Norfolk, Virginia but continued to deploy each year to the base in Cuba for several weeks of operations—frequently in conjunction with the annual \"Springboard\" fleet exercises held in the West Indies. She was at Guantanamo Bay in February 1964 when Cuban Premier Fidel Castro cut off the base's water supply. When the United States government decided to respond by permanently severing the water link to illustrate the base's self sufficiency, \"Utina\" played an important role by bringing in Guantanamo Bay's first potable water before two large tankers could be activated for the purpose.\n\nThroughout her quarter of a century of service with the Navy, \"Utina\" altered her routine of operations along the eastern seaboard and in the West Indies only twice. In May 1965, she embarked upon her only deployment to the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea. Her missions, however, remained the same though the emphasis shifted to target towing for 6th Fleet surface gunnery exercises. She returned to Norfolk in early October 1965 and resumed 2d Fleet services once more. Her second departure from her primary zone of operations came in June 1967 when she steamed to Iceland to assist USS \"Aeolus\" (ARC-3) in a special project. The tug returned to Norfolk on 13 July 1967 and resumed east coast-West Indies operations for the remaining four years of her career.\n\nOn 3 September 1971, \"Utina\" was decommissioned at Norfolk, and she was transferred, on a loan basis, to the Venezuelan Navy. She was commissioned as \"Felipe Larrazabal\" (R 21) and served in the Venezuelan Navy until December 1977. At that time, she was returned to the United States Navy, retransferred to Venezuela on a sale basis, and her name was struck from the Navy list—all simultaneously. As of the beginning of 1980, she was still active with the Venezuelan Navy.\n\n"}

He is a former tailback and team captain for the University of Southern California Trojans football team. He is the self-proclaimed \"captain of the worst team in USC history.\"\n\nPapadakis's family has long-held ties to USC sports. His father, John (Yiannis), and his brother, Taso, both played football at USC. His maternal grandfather, Dr. Ernest Schultz, played basketball for the Trojans. In spite of the family's close ties to USC, his younger brother Demetrius walked on to crosstown rival UCLA's football team and was a member of the 2008 team. Petros planned to play football for the UCLA Bruins, but the Bruins lost interest in recruiting him and canceled his visit to campus.\n\nPapadakis started his college career at the University of California, Berkeley. He left the Cal Fall football training camp, undetected, in the middle of the night and hitchhiked back to Los Angeles after being homesick after one week.\n\nWhile playing for University of Southern California, Papadakis scored 16 touchdowns. In 1999 and 2000, he was named USC's team captain. However, he broke his foot in August 1999, requiring several operations that caused him to miss that season. After months of rehabilitation, Papadakis returned in 2000. His teammates honored this accomplishment, voting Papadakis that season's \"Most Inspirational Player.\"\n\nIn the 2000 season, USC won its opening game against Penn State in the Kickoff Classic with a score of 29–5 at the Meadowlands. Playing on his repaired foot, Papadakis scored a touchdown and gained 29 yards on 11 carries. The Trojans began the season 3–0 and were ranked 8th in the national polls. But the team collapsed and finished with a 5–7 overall record.\n\nThe Trojans 2–6 conference record in 2000 was the only time the team finished in the last league position. Since his first year in broadcasting, Papadakis has regularly called himself \"the captain of the worst team in USC history\".\n\nDuring his university football career, Papadakis played in the 1998 Sun Bowl, where the team lost to Texas Christian University, scoring a touchdown during this game.\n\nPapadakis's first experience of broadcasting occurred when he was a tailback for the USC football team, where he became a popular interviewee among media in Los Angeles. When questioned about his popularity, Papadakis replied, \"I just feel like the media is starved for somebody to say something different than, 'We really have to play hard this week.' That’s all good stuff, but I deal with that in meetings every day. I deal with that for six hours with coaches.\"\n\nIn 2002 and 2003 Papadakis continued broadcasting on FSN, and took employment as a sideline reporter for FSN's High School Game of the Week. He also became the host of the USC Magazine Show on FSN.\n\nIn 2004, Fox Sports Net hired him to comment on national Pac-10 games alongside Barry Tompkins. Petros had no booth experience when FSN named him its top color analyst.\n\nPapadakis hosted \"Pros vs Joes\" on Spike TV for three seasons. In late 2008, the network announced it would replace Papadakis with former New York Giants defensive end Michael Strahan for the show's fourth season.\n\nFrom 2006 to 2010, Papadakis called a number of games as part of the California State High School Bowl Championship game on FSN.\n\nIn the autumn of 2007, Papadakis appeared on KNBC Channel 4 as Fred Roggin's co-host on \"The Challenge\", which followed NBC's \"Football Night in America\" on Sunday evenings. He has continued on the show since then, recently completing his 11th season on the show with Roggin.\n\nPapadakis has been featured on several television networks including KTLA, VH-1, GSN, ESPN and E!. In 2005, he guest starred on the CBS hit series \"\", where he played a sports talk radio host.\nLater on in life he starred in the T.V. reality show \"Dennis Finds a Husband\".\n\nCurrently, Papadakis provides analysis for Fox Sports on their college football telecasts as well as FS1's \"Fox Sports Live\" studio show.\n\nPapadakis's first regular radio experience came in 1998 while he was a junior tailback at USC.\n\nIn the summer of 2001, Papadakis began working on radio in addition to his TV duties. He co-hosted the weekly \"USC Insider\" with Pete Arbogast on the now defunct station KMPC-1540 AM, called \"The Ticket\". In 2002 and 2003 Papadakis was the sideline reporter for USC games, and in January 2003 hosted the \"Bonus Hour\". Papadakis and Mark Willard co-hosted a show from 9-to-10am on weekdays. Papadakis also became, and remains, a regular guest on the Kevin and Bean morning show on KROQ-FM in Los Angeles.\n\nIn January 2004 \"The Petros Papadakis Show\" began on KMPC. It was produced by Craig Larson and featured Cornelius(CORN DOGG) Edwards and traffic reporter Sabina Mora. Brian Vieira became the show's producer in June 2005. \n\"The Petros Papadakis Show\" was known for Papadakis's musical parodies such as \"I'm 'n Luv (Wit da Clippers)\" and \"I Love Yee Doyers\" (I Love the Dodgers). He was also known for his \"Pop Culture Report\", reporting the news of young celebrities in Hollywood.\n\nPapadakis resigned from his position at 1540 The Ticket in October 2006 to concentrate on his television broadcasting. Within a month of his resignation, KMPC laid off most of its remaining local employees. Sporting News Radio sold its interest in the station on March 30, 2007, and it became a Korean language station.\n\nOn January 8, 2007 Petros returned to AM radio with an afternoon sports program on KLAC, on 570 kHz, a Los Angeles-based station, co-hosting the Petros and Money Show with Matt \"Money\" Smith. Two years later, the show was nationally syndicated because of a merger between Fox Sports Radio and KLAC. The network carried the program nationwide until January 2014, when it was dropped from the national network, but remained as a local show.\n\nIn addition to his other media duties, Papadakis worked part-time for the USC men's basketball team as its public address announcer from 2004–2016.\n\nHe is a graduate of the Christ Lutheran School, Palos Verdes Peninsula High School, and University of Southern California.\n\n"}

{"id": "2328615", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2328615", "title": "Serge Lifar", "text": "Serge Lifar\n\nSerge Lifar (, \"Serhіy Mуkhailovуch Lуfar\"; , \"Sergey Mikhaylovich Lifar\") (, Kiev, Russian Empire15 December 1986, Lausanne, Switzerland) was a French ballet dancer and choreographer of Ukrainian origin, famous as one of the greatest male ballet dancers of the 20th century. Not only a dancer, Lifar was also a choreographer, director, writer, theoretician about dance, and collector.\n\nAs ballet master of the Paris Opera from 1930 to 1944, and from 1947 to 1958, he devoted himself to the restoration of the technical level of the Paris Opera Ballet, returning it to its place as one of the best companies in the world.\n\nLifar was born in Kiev, Russian Empire. His year of birth is officially shown as 1904 (as on a 2004 Ukrainian stamp commemorating his centenary). \nHe was the pupil of Bronislava Nijinska in her ballet studio «School of Movement» in Kiev.\n\nIn 1921 he left the Soviet Union and was noticed by Sergei Diaghilev, who sent him to Turin in order to improve his technique with Enrico Cecchetti.\n\nHe made his debut at the Ballets Russes in 1923, where he became the principal dancer in 1925. Lifar was considered the successor to Nijinsky in the Ballets Russes. He was cast at the age of 21 opposite Tamara Karsavina in Nijinska's \"Roméo et Juliette\" (1926); Karsavina was twice his age. He originated leading roles in three Balanchine ballets for the Ballet Russes, including \"La Chatte\" (1927), with a score by French composer Henri Sauguet and based on an Aesop fable, which featured Lifar's famous entrance in a 'chariot' formed by his male companions; \"Apollon Musagète\" (1928) with a score by Stravinsky depicting the birth of the Greek God Apollo and his encounter with the three muses, Calliope, Polyhymnia, and Terpsichore; and \"Le Fils prodigue\" (\"The Prodigal Son\") (1929), with a score by Sergei Prokofiev, the last great ballet of the Diaghilev era.\n\nAt the death of Diaghilev in 1929, Lifar at the age of 24 was invited by Jacques Rouché to take over the directorship of the Paris Opéra Ballet, which had fallen into decline in the late 19th century. Lifar gave the company a new strength and purpose, initiating the rebirth of ballet in France, and began to create the first of many ballets for that company. These were immediately successful, such as \"Les Créatures de Prométhée\" (1929), a personal version of \"Le Spectre de la rose\" (1931); and \"L'Après-midi d'un faune\" (1935); \"Icare\" (1935), with costumes and decor by Picasso; \"Istar\" (1941); and \"Suite en Blanc\" (1943), which he qualified as \"Neoclassical ballet\".\n\nAs part of his effort to revitalize dance, Lifar thought the basic principles of ballet—specifically the five positions of the feet—denied mobility for the dancer. He codified two additional positions, known as the sixth and seventh positions, with the feet turned in, not out like the first five positions. The sixth and seventh positions were not Lifar's inventions, but revivals of positions that already existed in the eighteenth century, when there were ten positions of the feet in classical ballet; and their use is limited to Lifar's choreographies.\n\nDuring his three decades as director of the Paris Opéra Ballet, Lifar led the company through the turbulent times of World War II and the German occupation of France. Lifar was a collaborationist under the occupation {Franko, \"Serge Lifar and the Question of Collaboration with the German Authorities under the Occupation of Paris (1940-1949),\" in Dance Research 35/2 (Winter 2017): 218-257}. Lifar's postwar trial resulted in his condemnation as a collaborator and his suspension from the national stage. During his absence, Balanchine was hired to replace him.\nReturning to his former position, Lifar's presence was vehemently opposed by the Opera stagehands with the result that he was not allowed to appear on stage nor to consult with technical staff directly on any productions. Nevertheless, he brought the Paris Opéra Ballet to America and performed to full houses at the New York City Center despite protests. Audiences were enthusiastic and had great admiration for the company of dancers. He undoubtedly influenced Yvette Chauviré, Janine Charrat, and Roland Petit.\n\nIn 1958, Lifar was forced into retirement due to a strained relationship with the Opera management. A famous photograph was taken of Lifar leaving the Palais Garnier, after being forced to resign, looking somber and clasping the wings from the costume of Icarus that the character puts on in order to fly.\n\nOn 30 March 1958, at age 52, Lifar faced off against the 72-year-old impresario George de Cuevas in a duel in France. The duel was precipitated by an argument over changes to \"Black and White\" (\"Suite en blanc\"), a ballet by Lifar that was being presented by the Cuevas ballet company. Lifar had his face slapped in public after insisting that he retained the rights to \"Black and White\". Lifar sent his seconds to Cuevas who refused to extend an apology and chose to duel with swords. As duels had been \"technically outlawed\" in the 17th Century, the time and location of the duel were not disclosed to the public. The duel was conducted in front of 50 newspaper photographers and ended with the two combatants in tears and embraces in what \"The New York Times\" wrote \"what may well have been the most delicate encounter in the history of French dueling,\" with the sole injury being a cut on Lifar's right forearm in the seventh minute.\n\nIn 1977 the Paris Opéra Ballet devoted a full evening to his choreography.\n\nHe died in Lausanne, Switzerland in 1986, aged 81, and was buried in Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois Russian Cemetery.\n\nEditions Sauret published his memoirs, titled \"Les Mémoires d'Icare\", posthumously in 1993. The title references one of his greatest roles in the ballet \"Icare\". \"The story of the ballet is based on the ancient Greek myth of Icarus, whose father Daedalus builds him a pair of artificial wings. Disobeying his father's orders, Icarus flies too close to the sun, which melts the wax in his wings and causes him to plunge to his death.\"\n\nThe Serge Lifar Foundation was set up on 23 August 1989 by Lifar's companion, Countess Lillian Ahlefeldt-Laurvig. In 2012, jewels from the Countess' estate were auctioned at Sotheby's, with the proceeds going to the Foundation.\n\nIn the summer of 1994 the First Lifar International Ballet Contest was held on the stage of the National Ukraine Opera. The Sixth Lifar International Ballet Competition was held in April 2006 and the seventh in Donetsk in March–April 2011.\n\n\nIn 1935 Lifar published his \"confessio fidei\" (\"confession of faith\") titled \"Le manifesto du chorégraphe\", proposing laws about the independence of choreography. Some of views include:\nHe also wrote a biography of Diaghilev titled \"Serge Diaghilev, His Life, His Work, His Legend: An Intimate Biography\" published by Putnam, London, 1940.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2328621", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2328621", "title": "Yury Kazakov", "text": "Yury Kazakov\n\nYuri Pavlovich Kazakov () (August 8, 1927 – November 29, 1982) was a Russian author of short stories, often compared to Anton Chekhov and Ivan Bunin. Born in Moscow, he started out as a jazz musician, but turned to publishing his stories in 1952. He attended the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute, graduating in 1958.\n\nReportedly, Yuri Kazakov was born to a worker's family in Moscow and grew up in the old Arbat area, which has today been turned into a tourist attraction but in the mid-1900s was the focal point of Russian culture. \"The year when Yuri was born, 1927, was a time when the relative freedom of the 1920s was being replaced by the Red Terror of the 1930s [and] Yuri's father was arrested when the future writer was six [because] he had failed to inform on a man who described the horrors of collectivization in a conversation.\" \"Kazakov went to a typical Soviet school in the center of Moscow.\" \"When his father disappeared in the Gulag, the family lived in dire need, [but] Kazakov [continued to] stud[y] at an elite vocational school and the Gnesins music school where he played classical music on the double bass.\" \"For a while he performed in orchestras, but eventually abandoned music.\"\n\n\"In 1958 Kazakov graduated from the Maxim Gorky Literary Institute.\" \"By this time he had already written and published several stories, which were appreciated by such established writers as Konstantin Paustovsky, Viktor Shklovsky, and Ilya Ehrenburg.\" It's been said that \"the writer's early works displayed the influence of Russian classical literature, in particular the writer Ivan Bunin, who had emigrated following the revolution and began to be published in Russia widely again only following Stalin's death.\"\n\nAt the end of the 1950s Kazakov traveled to the north of Russia, and the trip became the subject of several new stories. On the strength of a collection of these stories he joined the Writers' Union in 1958. The North remained one of the most important themes in his work, one to which he returned in more difficult times.\" However, the authorities adopted a critical attitude to the new writer and the central literary journals stopped publishing him in 1959.\n\nKazakov emerged as a writer only thanks to the short period in recent Russian history known as the Thaw, but in the mid-1960s, this period gave way to stagnation in culture and public life.\" \"For many years Kazakov worked on a translation into Russian of a Kazakh novel devoted to World War I and the Civil War on the Aral Sea [and] some of his own works were published in Kazakhstan.\"\n\nIn defiance of the situation in the country, Kazakov produced some of his best stories in the 1970s, which dealt with the merging of two souls, the soul of the newborn and the soul of the poet at the end of his life. \"The writer considered simple but important problems of birth and death, suicide and suffering. \"Kazakov penetrated the mind of the child and presented his view of the world.\"\n\nThe writer's formative years passed under the influence of two major factors: Russian classical literature (in addition to Bunin, Kazakov's early prose bore the imprint of the works of Chekhov and Turgenev) and the Thaw.\" Kazakov slowly but surely overcame the influence of the classics and developed his own style and voice in his stories and as to the Thaw, it petered out gradually, but Kazakov did not take the road of the dissidents or many of the other \"men of the sixties\", who vacillated between collaboration with the Soviet regime and fawning on the West.\"\n\nKazakov died on November 29, 1982 and was buried in Vagankovo Cemetery in Moscow. It has been reported that Kazakov was modest and avoided cheap public relations. In one interview Kazakov summed up his life and world outlook: \"We are not great writers, but if we have a serious attitude to our work, then our word will perhaps prompt someone to stop and ponder for at least an hour, for at least a day, the meaning of life. For at least a day! That is so much!\"\n\nKazakov lived in Moscow but spent a good deal of time traveling along the shores of the White Sea, among the provincial towns along the Oka, and in Central Russian Upland and the wooded areas around them. He also spent periods of time with the fishermen of the Russian North. Several of his stories are set in these regions and enhanced by his experiences of life and nature in them.\n\nGeorge Gibian had said that \"Kazakov is worthy of note not because of any 'disaffection' or 'dissidence' [sic], but because what he says about his haunting characters set against an impressively captured nature is penetrating, true and beautiful.\" According to Gibian, Kazakov is distinctive among Russian authors. His work has an intrinsic, intangible quality which makes it unmistakably his. His characters are charged with emotion and tend to have a keen sense of an aspect of nature. Some enjoy the beauty of the visual world, some the scents of the forest, some the sounds of music but all intensely and with heightened senses experience the world around them.\n\n"}

After it was superseded by the Type 94 75 mm mountain gun, it was then used as an infantry \"regimental\" gun, deployed four to each infantry regiment, and referred to as \"\"rentai ho\"\" (regimental artillery). Two gun shields were produced for the weapon, an early type, which folded into thirds, and a late type, which folded in half.\n\nIn Japanese service the gun was crewed by thirteen men, twelve gunners and a squad leader. When the weapon was being fired there would be one aimer, one loader, one firer, one person to swing the guns aim left or right, a man inserting the fuzes into rounds and handing them to the loader, two gunners lying in reserve to the left and right of the gun position, and the squad leader sitting a little distance to the rear of the weapon. The remaining five men would ferry ammunition in relays from the ammunition squad, which would typically be in cover a few hundred meters behind the gun's position.\n\nThe weapon could be transported complete by its thirteen-man squad, or broken down into parts and carried on six pack horses using special harnesses, a seventh horse was used to carry ammunition.\n\nTwo types of impact fuze were available for the Type 97, a 75 mm high explosive round, one with a delay of 0.05 seconds, the second with a delay of 1 second.

{"id": "2328646", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2328646", "title": "Al Held", "text": "Al Held\n\nAl Held (October 12, 1928 – July 27, 2005) was an American Abstract expressionist painter. He was particularly well known for his large scale Hard-edge paintings. As an artist, multiple stylistic changes occurred throughout his career, however, none of these occurred at the same time as any popular emerging style or acted against a particular art form. In the 1950s his style reflected the abstract expressionist tone and then transitioned to a geometric style in the 60s. During the 1980s there was a shift into painting that emphasized bright geometric space that's deepness reflected infinity. From 1963 to 1980 he was a professor of art at Yale University.\n\nBorn in Brooklyn, New York in 1928, he grew up in the East Bronx, the son of a poor Jewish family thrown onto welfare during the depression. Held showed no interest in art until leaving the Navy in 1947. Inspired by his friend Nicholas Krushenick, Held enrolled in the Art Students League of New York. He originally thought about studying in Mexico under the prominent muralist David Siqueiros, who created gigantic pieces that contained intense political material. However, the G.I. accreditation that he planned on using to help with his travels was not accepted at the school he planned on attending. In 1951, using the support of the G.I. Bill, he went to Paris for two years, to study at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière. In Paris, he decided that realism was not for him and moved into abstraction. During the early 50s Avant-garde painters in the United States were receiving fresh inspiration from abstract expressionists such as Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, and Willem De Kooning. Together these artists brought a new way of thinking that influenced Held. He returned to New York in 1953 and married Giselle Wexler, with whom he had a daughter, Mara. After the break-up with his wife, he went to San Francisco where he met the soon-to-be postmodern dancer and choreographer Yvonne Rainer. They moved together to New York in 1956, got married in 1957 to split up in 1959. Then in 1969, he married the sculptor, Sylvia Stone.\n\nThe Galerie Huit in Paris was where his first exhibition was set up in 1952. However, the art scene in New York was starting to gain new popularity and Held moved back there. During one of his solo Abstract expressionist exhibitions in 1959, Held's large-scale paintings of colourful, simple abstract geometric forms gained increasing recognition in America and Europe. In 1962, he was appointed to the Yale University Faculty Of Art (where he would teach until 1980). In 1965, the critic Irving Sandler curated the critically acclaimed \"Concrete Expressionism\" show at New York University featuring the work of painters Al Held and Knox Martin and the sculptors Ronald Bladen, George Sugarman and David Weinrib.\n\nIn 1964, Held was awarded the Logan Medal of the arts and received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1966. Feeling that he'd reached the end of his style's potential, he shifted in 1967 to black and white images that dealt with challenging perspectives and \"spatial conundrums\". Some critics dismissed this work as simply disorienting; others declared it Held's finest achievement to date. By the late 1970s, he had re-introduced colour to his work. In 1988 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1994.\n\nIn his later years, Held earned commissions of up to one million dollars. In 2005, he completed a large, colourful mural in the New York City Subway system, at Lexington Avenue / 51st – 53rd Streets station.\n\nThree of Held's murals were in the original WTC 7 building.\n\nAt age 76, Held was found dead in his villa swimming pool near Camerata, Italy, on July 27, 2005. It is believed he died of natural causes.\n\nThe most distinguishing part of Held's pigment paintings were the thick brush strokes of paint in random directions that are reminiscent of Abstract Expressionism. These strokes were short, gestural and are commonly referred to as action painting. The colors included earth tones that are muted and spread around chaotically. Typical for many of these paintings was no foreground or background and sections were splashed with drips. \nAs time went forward in the fifties, Held began to lengthen his gestures and combined strokes into triangles, circles, and rectangles. This was alluding to the geometric abstractions that started at the end of 1959.\n\nDuring the late 50s gestural painting was something that Held had begun to lose interest in. He and a few other artists such as Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland felt a growing problem emerge. The style had brought a large number of mediocre artists and become overdone for them. By 1960 he had succeeded in finding an alternative method given the label hard edge. In other ways it has been described as post-painterly abstraction, new abstraction, and cool art. The famous exhibition organizer Irving Sandler has been known to characterize it as concrete expressionism. The development of this style also led Held to change his medium from oil to a water-based acrylic. These paintings had vivid colors geometric configurations around positioned throughout the canvas resembling a mural. All of the paintings were nonobjective meaning the artwork does not represent a person, place or thing. \"Untitled\" from 1964, in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art is an example of the artist's hard-edge style.\n\nWith these works Held takes concrete abstraction to its extreme. Around 1961-1966 Held created large abstract letters of the English alphabet. These paintings were given the titles \"The Big ‘N\"', \"The Big ‘X’\", etc. There is a delicate alteration of the letters as Held plays with viewers perception's by changing the figure to the frame. The letters themselves take over the canvas and colors within the works make them seem to lean forward and backward at the same time. It leaves the viewer to think about the ideas of space and form and how dimension plays a key role.\n\nIn 1967 Held felt that he was being limited by the flatness of previous hard edge abstractions. He wanted a way to create more picture space in some way, however painting shapes onto shapes would constantly hide beneath one another. Therefore, Held believed that adding depth and making the shapes appear three-dimensional on the canvas was his best option. The works \"Giza Gate II\" and \"Flemish IV\" are good examples of this style. A representative black-and-white mural of volumetric forms in space, \"Rothko's Canvas\", was commissioned for The Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller Empire State Plaza Art Collection in Albany, NY.\n\nAll of these works are composed in acrylic black and white. The quasi-geometric structures zigzag in all directions making complex shapes usually cubical. Despite the same consistency of content throughout the works each maintain a unique design of their own. Grid like elements started becoming more apparent suggesting structure similar to that of the framework in buildings. The paintings are in a way disorienting with their uncentered patterns and no place to gain perspective. As his art's complexity grew the idea of his art to be deemed minimalistic became less of a dominant label. Another remarkable characteristic of these works is the scale. For example, in Philadelphia during 1976 he painted his two largest murals, \"Order/Disorder\" and \"Ascension/Descension\". Each mural was 13 x 90 feet and stretches throughout an office building.\n\nWhile Held was away from his studio in New York during the 1980s he created a number of watercolor paintings in Rome. The perspective of the shapes created a sense of deep space by expanding into the canvas what seems like forever. These works test imagination with intersecting planes and large to small forms jutting in the picture. Held's visual concept of infinity creates a need for the viewer to look inward on him or herself. Works such as Pachinko make viewers ask questions to understand how huge the structures actually are in relation to one another in the painting and this leads to more questions. The understanding of the forms is dynamic as certain objects could be large and far away or small and near the foreground. The perception of space challenges the audience to see the problem of observing the area around them.\n\nMany of Held's modern artwork includes large symmetric non-objective structures with vivid colors. Using an acrylic medium, he created interlocking scaffolds that overlap with a deep consideration of architecture. The ancient buildings of Rome and the idea of the renaissance inspired Held as he returned to New York. Describing Held's images as \"room\" or \"walls\" makes sense, however, the art is non-objective and those may not be the best words to use. On one hand the work has architectural qualities but at the same time the planes of color are nonrepresentational and in a way cannot be grasped.\nIn 1983, his 15’ by 55’ mural \"Mantegna’s Edge\" was completed in Dallas, Texas. The work is less fragmented and a deeper sense of order compared to some of his other works. Bright colored, grid-like structure exists harmonically in an infinite blue space. Yet, existing within it also is a sense of paradox and complexity.\n\n\n"}

Kish Media was a consortium made up of Tullamore Beta Ltd (Windmill Lane Productions & Paul McGuinness (U2 manager); owners of TV3), the Barry family of Barry's Tea, and Gowan Group. In its infant stages, the channels consortium invested €14 million to fund the project. It was anticipated that Channel 6 would launch further channels including a Channel 6+1 service and a music channel.\nIn 2008, Kish Media announced the channel was for sale. In July 2008, it was confirmed that TV3 had purchased Kish Media for €10 million. The channel continued to broadcast as Channel 6 for a further six months, when TV3 began to promote Channel 6 programming on its main channel.\nThe station's first managing director was Martin Drake, who left the company after just eight months, and after a period under interim CEO Mark Kellett, the channel's top job was taken by Managing Director Michael Murphy, who later left the channel when it was fully transferred to TV3 and integrated into the TV3 Group. In December 2008, TV3 confirmed it would to re-brand Channel 6 to 3e on 5 January 2009. Though 3e shares some of the same shareholders and programmes as Channel 6, there was no formal connection between the two stations, until 2008 when Tullamore Beta took control of the channel.\n\n3e was a replacement for Channel 6, which first broadcast on 30 March 2006. In 2008, it was announced the channel was for sale. In July 2008, it was confirmed that TV3 had purchased the parent company, Kish Media, for €10 million. The channel continued to broadcast as Channel 6 for a further 6 months before it was re-branded as 3e. Prior to its relaunch TV3 began to promote Channel 6 programming on its main channel. Including the 2008 series of I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here, which previously aired on TV3 and subsequently aired on 3e until 2014. Channel 6 Broadcasting Ltd remains a subsidiary of TV3 posting profits of 4million euro in 2015.\nIn December 2008, TV3 confirmed it was to rebrand Channel 6 to 3e on 5 January 2009. The channel would use existing TV3 programming and provide TV3 audiences with a wider range of programming. 3e provides viewers with a mix of US and Australian acquisitions.\nIt is also used as a TV3 replay service featuring repeats of previously broadcast programs on TV3 such as Ireland AM, Xposé and Midday. It was reported on 24 July 2009; TV3 Group sought to change 3e's licensing from the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland.\nOn 29 July 2009, the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland announced that the 3e licence would be licensed under Section 34, rather than Sections 36 and 41, of the Broadcasting Act 2001. This means that 3e is no longer a separate cable and satellite service rather it will be covered by the main terms and conditions of the existing TV3 contract.\n2010–present: <br>\nIn November 2010, the TV3 Group confirmed 3e made financial losses, but returned to a profit in 2011.\nFrom November 2010, 3e began to air in the majority of homes in Ireland as it became one of the test channels on Saorview. By May 2012, the channel became available to 98% of homes in Ireland through Saorview and also available on other digital television providers.\n3e was expected to receive a revamped on-air presentation in November 2014, but it appears that the transition has been either delayed or abandoned.\nOn 9 January 2017, 3e was re-launched as part of a wider repositioning of TV3 Group's networks with the launch of be3. 3e was re-vamped as an entertainment-oriented network aimed towards viewers aged 15–44.\nIn June 2018, it was announced that 3e was rebranded as Virgin Media Two on 30 August 2018, as part of a rebranding of all three TV3 channels under the Virgin Media brand.\n\nWith the announcement that TV3 Group would operate the channel. It was confirmed in December 2008 that TV3 had decided not to recommission the majority of Channel 6's homegrown programming which included \"Night Shift\" which had a cult following. The controversial move to cancel the series was reported in the media with major criticism from music journalists and music fans. Other shows which were cancelled with TV3's acquisition of Channel 6 included music shows \"Day Shift\", \"Pop Scene\", and \"Take 6\", a weekly movie review show.\nFrom 2009, TV3 began to use the channel as a replay service. In late 2010, 3e began producing its own programming which includes \"FYI\" (previously 3e News) and \"Uploaded\". \"FYI\" was subsequently dropped in favour or TV3 News at 8, with bulletins replaced by \"The Thread\".\n3e was made available on Sky Ireland in late 2009. Predecessor Channel 6 was not made available on Sky until 2007 due to a dispute between Kish Media and Sky. On 29 September 2009 TV3 Group and Sky Ireland confirmed that 3e would be moved to 105 its service having been on channel 182 (as Channel 6 and for some time as 3e) prior to this change.\nAs Channel 6 the service was aimed at the 15 to 35 year old demographic. It aired many new US programmes exclusively on the channel with a number of popular re-runs. The channel also re-introduced Music TV back into the Irish market, and successfully return an alternative music programme to Irish TV following the axing of No Disco (RTÉ2) and Pop3 (TV3). The decision by TV3 to drop \"Night Shift\" in 2009 was picked up by alternative music magazine Hot Press and many in the Irish music industry.\nAs 3e TV3 replaced most of Channel 6's homegrown programmes with repeats of Daytime TV from TV3, which it has dropped most of Channel 6 US first runs with US repeats with only \"Family Guy\", \"American Dad\" and \"The Cleveland Show\" airing first runs.\n3e uses the existing staff at TV3 (200 employees) to operate the channel. The channel airs a stripped schedule with very little original programme from any country. Much of 3e's news programmes were dropped in 2015.\nTV3 Group reported on 12 November 2009 that 3e's viewing figures had increased since moving to Sky 105. Its audience share increased by 25% from 0.9% to 1.1% – this brought the channel back to the audience figures received by Channel 6 at the end of 2008. As of 2010, 3e has increased its viewing figures through an increase in live sports. In May 2015 3e had 2.5% of the TV viewing audience.\nIn 2010, 3e's parent company recorded losses at the station during 2009. A pre-tax loss of €5million was reported to the Irish Company Registrars Office (CRO). Kish Media will not look to recoup their €14.5million investment until such time as the channel begins to make profits and when all liabilities at the station are paid as they fall due. It is expected that the channel will move into profit in 2010, however the downturn in the Irish market and falling advertising rates did cause the channel problems during 2009. Revenue was down in 2008 from 2007, while expenses during 2008 had been reduced slightly.\nIn 2009, several rearrangements of the 3e schedule occurred. These included showing repeats of \"Xpose\" and \"Emmerdale\" straight after TV3, followed by putting \"Xpose\" on at 17:30 instead of 18:30 and removing repeat showings of \"Emmerdale\" and replacing them with repeat showings of \"Coronation Street\". Each of the changes failed to ignite 3e audience share, at first a small drop was seen. Xpose was returned to 18:30, while a \"Coronation Street\" omnibus was on a Sunday afternoon, however ultimately both ITV soaps were dropped from the 3e schedule.\nOn 27 June 2016 – 3e began to broadcast as kids programming block – 3Kids. The programming block airs seven days a week from 07:00 to 10:00, which features shows such as Barney & Friends, Origanimals, Teletubbies, Ghosts of Time, The Wiggles, Stella and Sam, and Winx Club among others.\nFrom Monday 9 January 2017, 3Kids moved to sister channel be3. This was part of TV3' major rebrand.\nChannel 6 produced several shows to compete with both RTÉ2's and TV3's youth orientated programming, such as, \"Cois Farraige\" an Irish surfing and surf culture show hosted by Jenny Buckley, \"Access Hollywood\" also hosted by Jenny Buckley, \"Day Shift\" a weekend morning music show, \"Game On\" a video games show, \"Night Shift\" a late night interactive music show hosted by Michelle Doherty, \"Quiz 6\" a phone-in quiz show, where viewers could answer on screen puzzles to win cash and \"Take Six\" a movie show hosted by Taragh Loughrey Grant who was later replaced by Elsa Jones, Sean Munsanje and Serena Bellissimo. Channel 6 had cancelled all but \"Day Shift\", \"Night Shift\", \"Pop Scene\" and \"Take 6\" by the time TV3 had bought the station. TV3 cancelled all of the remaining Channel 6 programmes as it re-branded the channel as 3e.\nWith the launch of 3e the Channel 6 programming was replaced by repeats of TV3's \"XposéXTRA\" and \"The Holiday Show\". Towards the end of 2009 TV3 began to produce more programming \"Xccelerate\" a weekly motoring show for 3e, produced by City Productions for TV3.\nIn 2010 TV3 started to repeat its morning and daytime shows to the channel as repeats. \"Ireland AM\" is repeated on 3e each morning at 10:15, \"The Morning Show\" is repeated the following morning on 3e at 09:25 and \"Midday\" is repeated the following morning on 3e at 08:35. This continued with the introduction of TV3 daytime shows \"The Seven O'Clock Show\", \"Saturday AM\" and \"Sunday AM\".\nOther Irish programming included Uploaded and Tallafornia Uncut which aired in 2012.\nSince 2015 3e largely repeats homegrown programming from TV3, including Red RockBut repeats of Red Rock moved to be3 as of 2017\nAs Channel 6 the channel provided no news and sport, and focused largely on home produced music and review programmes.\nIn 2015 3e dropped its main evening news, and only airs bulletins called \"The Thread\". In September 2017 3e started providing 60 minute news update in the afternoons on 3e, at 13:00, 14:00, 15:00 and 16:00, this is coupled with news programming on both TV3 and be3.\nAlthough designed as an entertainment channel, it started broadcasting news updates shortly after its rebrand to 3e in 2009. \"3e News Update\" is a minute long news broadcast from TV3 News. \"3e News Update\" was broadcast Monday to Friday at 18:59, 19:59, 20:59, and 21:59. The News Updates were presented by TV3 News presenters.\nCEO of the TV3 Group David McRedmond revealed in an interview with Hot Press on Thursday 8 October 2009 that 3e would produce a new news programme targeting a demographic between 15 and 34 years of age. The show will air every evening and it is expected to start broadcasting at the end of October 2009, however the show's launch was put back until the end of November 2009.\n\"3e News\" began broadcasting 23 November 2009 at 18:00. It broadcasts Monday to Friday each week. The main news anchor is Caroline Twohig, The sports anchor is Paul Walsh and the cyber reporter is Cassie Stokes. 3e News renamed as \"FYI\"(Fresh Young Independent) from 10 March 2010. The show's presenters remain on in their current roles and the format of an Interactive news aimed at the 15 to 35 year old age group remains. \"3e News Update\" was replaced with \"FYI. Update\" at 7:58, \"FYI. Online\" at 8:58 and \"FYI. Download\" at 9:58.\nIn July 2014 it was announced that 3e was to drop \"FYI\" to be replaced by a 60-second news similar to the original \"TV3 News Update\" that aired on the channel, the news update will be called \"The Thread\" in reference to their new on-line blogging service .\nIn March 2015, 3e aired 5 nights of specialist topics as part of Debate Week the shows were produced in association with IADT.\nFrom September 2009 TV3 Sport has provided live coverage of the UEFA Europa League (formerly the UEFA Cup) on 3e, the Irish rights for which TV3 shares with Setanta Ireland. BT Sport took these rights from 2015.\nIn 2014 TV3 agreed a deal with UFC to broadcast the \"UFC: Dublin Fight Night\" on 19 July 2014. The fight between Irishman Conor McGregor and Diego Brandão, is the first UFC fight to be broadcast by an Irish FTA TV service.\n3e provided extra coverage to the Rugby World Cup 2015 as part of TV3 rights agreement for the tournament.\nWhen Channel 6 launched the channel offered Irish viewers programming previously unavailable on other Irish channels these included:\n\"Heroes\", \"House\", \"Rachael Ray\", \"My Name is Earl\", \"American Dad!\", \"Dexter\", \"Family Guy\" and \"The Closer\". The channel began to air repeats of other high profiled shows which previously broadcast on other Irish channels these included: \"CSI\", \"Frasier\", \"Friends\", \"Sex and the City\", \"Scrubs\", \"The Sopranos\", \"Swingtown\" and \"The Wire\".\nWhen the TV3 Group re-branded 3e as a successor to Channel 6, many existing programming on TV3 began to air on the channel. One of the first major acquisitions for the channel was the agreement to broadcast ABC's \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" and \"The Middle\". On 15 November 2010, 3e replaced \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" with TBS's \"Conan\".\nTV3 Group signed an agreement with HBO to air the first season of \"In Treatment.

Later in 2008 it moved to Channel 182 on Sky, however it wanted to be further up the EPG. When TV3 bought the channel in 2008 an agreement was reached with Sky to move the channel to 105 a vacant position on Sky Ireland's EPG.

Channel 6 had a wider variety of content and had introduced many new US first runs to Irish TV. While their Irish content was limited to in-studio music programming (Night Shift and Day Shift), many alternative Irish bands had been given the opportunity of appearing to a wider audience. TV3's decision to drop Channel 6's home produced programming caused an outcry from many in the music industry. As 3e and Virgin Media TWO, it has relied mainly on repeats of TV3 programming, US and English programming and many reality programmes, causing the content of the channel to be diminished.\n\nMarch 2006 – January 2009: Channel 6 launched its first set of identifiers (idents) in March 2006 and they remained on the channel up to its re-brand to 3e in January 2009. The presentation package was produced by Cleverality. There were several idents during this period. The 'blue dot' in the centre of the 6 would be transformed from a symbol representing entertainment into the 'blue dot'. Examples of those symbols include, the masks for drama and comedy, film reels, a television set etc.\nJanuary 2009—2015: When re-branded as 3e in January 2009, the new idents were made by Dublin-based Image Now. The 3e idents consists of the 'e' bouncing around the screen next to the '3', one is generic while the other one has the 'e' in flames trying to put them out. A third ident was added in October 2009 for use before soccer matches, it shows the 'e' kicking a football against the '3'. A fourth ident was added in October 2010, which features the 'e' slipping on a banana skin as a pie and rake hits it.\n3e's Christmas idents were made in-house at TV3. Three idents were introduced 'Mistletoe', 'Snowballs' and 'Lights' The new idents were first show on Saturday 19 December.\nTV3 announced a student competition to re-brand the 3e logo, the new idents were expected to launch during \"I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!\" in November 2014.

It is a private, non-profit organization founded in 1988 with the support of the United Nations Development Programme in Vietnam (UNDP) with the aim of providing an education to the children of UN staff and others. It now caters to the children of diplomats, aid workers, businessmen, and other expatriates living and working in Hanoi. Classes range from pre-school to high school, and the IB Diploma is available to students in grade 11 and 12.\n\nAs of May 2018, there were 1123 students with 66 nationalities speaking 44 different languages. The school maintains a 20% cap for any one nationality, which gives UNIS Hanoi a truly international and culturally diverse atmosphere.\n\nThere are teachers from 27 different countries with 88% from the UK, USA, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and Canada. Class sizes at UNIS Hanoi range from 16 to 22 students depending on the grade level with mostly 8 classes per grade level.\n\nFor many years, the school has been housed in a small building attached to the Hanoi-Amsterdam campus (a local Vietnamese high school). In 1999, the campus was moved to the UN buildings in Van Phuc; in 2004 the school was finally moved to the long-awaited, custom-built campus located in a new area on the outskirts of Hanoi proper called Ciputra Hanoi International City. In 2012, the school opened its sports center that included two full-sized covered basketball courts, weight/dance rooms, and several multipurpose classrooms. Along with the opening of the sports center, a new center for the arts was also opened that included among many facilities, including a new theater and a recording studio.\n\nWhen the school was founded in 1988, there were less than 10 students in the first class. Since the late 80s, the school has seen significant growth. Up until 1999, there was no 12th grade. The demographic has changed significantly in the past 5 years, as only a handful of Vietnamese children used to attend the school.\n\nUNIS now offers the full International Baccalaureate program, from the primary level to the Diploma Programme in high school—the first school to do so in Asia. The school is also accredited by the European Council of International Schools, New England Association of Schools and Colleges, Council of International Schools, East Asia Regional Council of Overseas Schools and Western Association of Schools and Colleges while having affiliation with the Asia Pacific Activities Conference.\n\nThe curriculum is international, drawing upon English language programs and the framework provided by the International Baccalaureate Organization. The School has adopted the IB Programmes: Primary Years (K-5), Middle Years (Grades 6-10) and in Grades 11-12, the School has adopted the IB Diploma Programme. It is a rigorous, international university preparatory curriculum with prescribed knowledge, skills, and understandings in each subject area. Participation in the IB Diploma Programme is available to all students at UNIS Hanoi, with more than 90% taking the opportunity and with results consistently above the IBO world averages; the remainder graduate with a UNIS High School Diploma.\n\nInstruction in the world and home country languages, the arts, physical education, and English-as-an-Additional Language supplement a rigorous core curriculum. UNIS Hanoi has a learning support and counseling program at all grade levels. There is an extensive co-curricular programme of sports and activities and a strong commitment to service-learning, reflecting the spirit of the UN ideals and principles. The School has a fully resourced library and media center and has a strong commitment to integrating technology throughout the curriculum with a one-to-one personal computer tablet program for all students from Grades 4-12 and mobile computer labs for students in Discovery through Grade 3.\n\nUNIS divides its extracurricular activities into two main groups: \"After School Activities - ASA\" and \"Community & Service - C&S or CAS\"\n\nAPAC Achievements:\n\n\nUNIS Hanoi is affiliated to, or members of the following organisations:\n"}

It was partitioned between Great Britain and France by the Anglo-French Convention of 1898. \nPeople of Borgu were known as Bariba and Borgawa.\n\nAccording to the Kisra legend known all over Borgu, the petty kingdoms of the country were founded by Kisra, a hero who according to an oral tradition immigrated from Birnin Kisra (\"the town of Kisra\") in Arabia. His brothers are said to have been the founders of the kingdoms of Illo, Bussa and Nikki. Other descendants are believed to have constituted the ruling aristocracy of the Wasangari.\n\nDuring the British colonial era, the area was within the territory claimed by the Royal Niger Company, but rivalry between Britain and France for control of the trade on the River Niger led to occupation of areas by the French, for instance at Illo, and the stationing of the British West African Frontier Force at Yashikera and elsewhere in the region.\n\nThe matter was settled by the Anglo-French Delineation Agreement and later the British Government divided Nigeria into Northern and Southern Protectorates. Borgu became part of the Northern Nigeria Protectorate. British posts were established along the Niger River and at Jebba, Zungeru, Lokoja and Illo, and a mail route was established between them for communication with Britain.\n\nIn spite of their separation by the colonial border there are still many exchanges between the petty kingdoms of Borgu situated in Benin and Nigeria. The three major kingdoms are Bussa, Illo and Nikki. Bussa is traditionally considered to be the spiritual centre of Borgu, Nikki the centre of political power and Illo the commercial emporium.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is generally recognized as hitting an opposing player at or below the other player's knees.

A player is generally assessed a minor penalty for clipping, unless an injury is caused, in which case a major penalty and a misconduct or game misconduct will result. It is one of the most rarely called penalties in the sport.\n\nHistorically, players penalized for clipping are labeled as \"dirty\" players, as clipping is nearly always viewed as attempt to injure an opponent. \n\nAdditionally, Rule 639(a) of the USA Hockey Rulebook states:\n\n“Any player who deliberately leaves his feet and contacts an opponent with any part of his body thereby causing the opponent to trip or fall shall be assessed a minor penalty (Clipping).(Note 3) This rule does not apply to a player who has dropped to his knee(s) to block a shot.”\n\nClipping was instituted as a rule in the National Hockey League in 2002, following a low hit on 26 April by Toronto Maple Leafs forward Darcy Tucker on New York Islanders captain Michael Peca. The hit occurred during a Stanley Cup playoff matchup between the two teams, and Peca was unable to play for the remainder of the season.

With \"Mortadelo y Filemón\", they are the most popular and most translated Spanish comic books. Their name is derived from the Spanish word \"zipizape\", meaning \"turmoil\" or \"chaos.\"\n\nZipi and Zape Zapatilla are two young twins who do poorly in school. Mischievous and energetic, they are fans of soccer. They are distinguished solely by their hair color: Zipi is blond, Zape black-haired. Other featured characters are their father, \"Don Pantuflo Zapatilla\", a professor of Philately and Colombophilia (\"pantuflo/a\" and \"zapatilla\" are both Spanish names for slippers); their mother, the hard-pressed \"Doña Jaimita\"; \"Don Minervo\", their strict teacher; \"Peloto\", the teacher’s pet (and thus the twins’ enemy); \"Sapientín\" (sometimes called \"Pitagorin\", as a reference to Pithagoras), their genius cousin and \"Pepe and Felisa Plómez\", the extremely annoying friends of their parents, whose undesirable visits they try to avoid or cut short.\n\nTheir stories are usually short, about one to eight pages long, but occasionally some are longer, about 44 or 48 pages, like \"El tonel del tiempo\" (The barrel of time) o \"El laboratorio secreto\" (The secret laboratory). They are humorous, based on the twins antics and their effects, since often they backfire spectacularly, including popular culture elements like aliens and mad scientists.\n\nEscobar's stories were published by Editorial Bruguera in the \"Pulgarcito\" magazine, which contained several comic strips. They later got their own magazine, \"ZipiZape\", which also contained several comic strips apart from the title one. The strips were later compiled in softcover and hardcover albums. When Bruguera went bankrupt, its catalog was bought by Ediciones B, the current owners of the characters rights. These classical stories can be found in softcover under the \"Colección Olé\" label and in hardcover under the \"Super Humor\" label.\n\nThe series continues after Escobar's death, now in the hands of cartoonists Juan Carlos Ramis and Joaquín Cera who have put them forward to the 21st century. Zipi and Zape are still domestic terrorists, but now are fans of the UEFA Champions League and make good use of the Internet. Their stories are published directly on hardcover albums under the \"Magos del Humor\" label. Several of these albums are later collected in the wider, hardcover \"Super Humor\" albums.\n\nThe popularity of \"Zipi y Zape\" has resulted in merchandise, including videogames, an animated TV series in 2003 and two live-action movies, \"Las aventuras de Zipi y Zape\", in 1981 and Zip & Zap and the Marble Gang, in 2013.

In the United States, the Minnesota State High School League, North Dakota High School Activities Association, and South Dakota High School Activities Association hold high-school state tournaments in nine-man football.\n\nThe size of the playing field is often smaller in nine-man football than in 11-man. Some states opt for a smaller, 80-yard-long by 40-yard-wide field (which is also used in eight-man and six-man); other states keep the field of play at the standard 100 yards long while reducing the width to 40 yards, some even play on a full-sized playing field (with the 53 1/3 yard-wide field). In games played on 80-yard fields, kickoffs take place from the 20-yard line rather than from the 40-yard line.\n\nA similar nine-man modification of Canadian football is played on the Canadian standard 110-yard field by small schools in the provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta and for small community associations in British Columbia. It is the standard format of play for eight- and nine-year-olds. The format is similar for five-, six-, and seven-year-old flag football, where the field is reduced to 50 yards by 50 yards.\n\nThe rules require that the offense align four players in the backfield and five on the line of scrimmage. A standard I formation has a quarterback, a fullback, a tailback, and five linemen. Usually, the outside linemen are a tight end and a wide receiver, but the alignment varies by formation. The fourth player in the offensive backfield often plays as an additional wide receiver or tight end.\n\nA common defensive formation is the 3-3-2, with three defensive linemen, three linebackers, and two defensive backs with one safety. \n\nThe games are frequently high-scoring because the number of players is reduced by more than the size of the field; thus, fast players usually find more open space to run within the field of play.\n\nSome leagues, like the Sunday Football League in Grand Rapids, Michigan, have used nine-man football as a way of furthering their \"Passion to Play\". They play 16-game seasons and keep full statistics. Their format differs slightly in field size, but formations are similar with the exception of a \"lurker\" in the deep backfield. Typically, the lurker leads the team in interceptions and spies on the quarterback on deep passes.\n\nIn France, most competitions are played nine-man: games and leagues involving 19-year-old players or younger, division 3 (\"Le Casque d'Argent\") and regional leagues. Blocking under the belt is strictly forbidden under nine-man French rules, but the field size remains the same as in standard 11-man American football.\n\nThe junior division (under 18s) of every state in Australia also play nine-man football. The game is played on a full-sized field, with modified timing rules (10-min quarters, running clock except the last 2 min of each half).\n\nIn Norway, division 1 games are traditional 11-man games, while division 2 games are nine-man football. \n\nItaly, Poland and Argentina also have nine-man leagues.\n\nIn Germany, some lower youth classes play in nine-man leagues.\n\nIn Israel, the Israel Football League is a nine-man league.\n\n"}

His opera \"Pomone\" was the first actual opera in French.\n\nBorn in Paris c. 1628, he studied music under Chambonnières. His first position was as organist at the church of Saint-Honoré in Paris. In 1655 he married Marie du Moustier. At this time he came under the patronage of Cardinal Mazarin who was instrumental in his appointment as Superintendent of music to the Dowager Queen Anne of Austria, mother of Louis XIV. Cambert's early works with libretto written by Pierre Perrin were frequently performed at court during this period. However, following the death of the powerful Mazarin, and the Queen's subsequent retirement to a convent, Cambert's position at court was weakened, as new powers came into force at court.\n\nIn 1669 Perrin founded the \"Académie Royale de Musique\", under the auspices of the French King. Cambert was invited to join Perrin in the administration of the project which is considered today to be one of the founding influences of grand opera. However, both Perrin and Cambert were eventually replaced at the academy by Lully. Cambert, furious at the insult, and at the lack of interest in his work shown by the French monarchy, left France in 1673 to pursue his career in England.\n\nIn England he was warmly received at the court of King Charles II, and was quickly appointed to \"Master of the King's Band\". Various pieces by him which had been shunned in France were now performed in London, but while accepted at the English court, he enjoyed little success with the general English public. His operas \"Pomone\", \"Ariane\" and \"Les Peines et les plaisirs de l'amour\" were if anything less to the Anglo-Saxon taste than the French.\n\nCambert died, rather mysteriously, in London. His death was widely reported at the time to be suicide; another widespread theory is that he was poisoned by one of his servants. Some have accused Lully of complicity in Cambert's demise.\n\nGérard Corbiau's 2000 film \"Le Roi danse\" (\"The King is dancing\") portrays a much older-looking Cambert (Johan Leysen) as the archrival of Lully and a symbol of Mazarin's old court Catholic establishment. Disgusted by libertine and pagan Lully, he desperately tries to prevent his rise and their animosity comes to a novel dimension after Cambert's mistress Madeleine Lambert, the daughter of Michel Lambert, marries Lully.\n\n"}

It was recorded in late 1966 and released on Colgems label #102 on January 9, 1967. It displaced the band's debut album from the top of the \"Billboard\" 200 chart and remained at No.1 for 18 weeks—the longest of any Monkees album. Combined, the first two Monkees albums were at the top of the \"Billboard\" chart for 31 consecutive weeks. \"More of the Monkees\" also went to No.1 in the UK. In the U.S. it has been certified quintuple platinum by the RIAA with sales of more than five million copies. \"More of the Monkees\" is also notable for being the first pop/rock album to be the best-selling album of the year in the U.S.\n\nMonkeemania had reached full swing by the time the album was released. The Monkees' second single, \"I'm a Believer\"—included on this album—held the number one position on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and they were about to embark on a highly successful concert tour.\n\nThe release of \"More of the Monkees\" was rushed to capitalize on the band's popularity, catching even its members by surprise. The band learned of the album's existence while on tour in Cleveland, Ohio, discovering it had already been released. They were dismayed by the cover image of them and offended by production overseer Don Kirshner's liner notes, which praised his team of songwriters before mentioning, almost as an afterthought, the names of the Monkees. The band, particularly Nesmith, was also furious about the songs—selected for the record from 34 that had been recorded—leading Nesmith to later tell \"Melody Maker\" magazine that \"More of the Monkees\" was \"probably the worst album in the history of the world\".\n\nThe group began to grow concerned over their musical output, since this album and their debut, \"The Monkees\", featured them limited to just vocals with scattered instrumental contributions. Kirshner had a strict rule that the Monkees were to provide only vocals on his productions, though separate sessions produced by Michael Nesmith himself usually featured Peter Tork on guitar. \"More of the Monkees\" has Nesmith limited to one song as lead vocalist.\n\nWithin weeks of the release of \"More of the Monkees\", Nesmith lobbied successfully with the group's creators, Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider, for the Monkees to be allowed to play their instruments on future records, effectively giving the quartet artistic control. To make his point clear to Kirshner, who was balking at the idea, Nesmith proceeded to punch a hole in the wall of a suite at the Beverly Hills Hotel during a group meeting with Kirshner and Colgems lawyer Herb Moelis, declaring to the latter: \"That could have been your face!\". This outburst came after Moelis snapped to Nesmith, \"You'd better read your contract\", when Nesmith threatened to quit. Kirshner was later dropped from the project altogether.\n\nThe original pressing catalog number is COM/COS 102. When the album was reissued in 1969 the Colgems symbol replaced the word \"Colgems\" on the bottom right-hand corner of the reverse side (Catalog number COS 102 RE). It was standard practice for RCA to add an \"RE\" when any one side of a record sleeve had a revision.

{"id": "2328743", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2328743", "title": "The Four Pennies", "text": "The Four Pennies\n\nThe Four Pennies were an English, 1960s Beat music group, most notable for their 1964 UK chart-topping song \"Juliet\". The Four Pennies were probably the most commercially successful UK vocal/instrumental group that failed to chart in the United States, during the so-called British Invasion.\n\nThe Four Pennies were founded in 1963, and initially consisted of Lionel Morton (vocals, rhythm guitar), Fritz Fryer (lead guitar), Mike Wilshaw (bass, keyboards, backing vocals), and Alan Buck (drums) The group's name was chosen as a more commercial alternative to \"The Lionel Morton Four\", and was decided upon after a meeting above a Blackburn music shop, the shop being situated on \"Penny Street\".\n\nIn their homeland, the group scored a number 47 placing with their first single, 1964's \"Do You Want Me To\". They then became famous for having a number one hit in the UK Singles Chart later in 1964 with \"Juliet\". It was written by group members Fritz Fryer, Mike Wilshaw and Lionel Morton. The ballad was originally intended for release as a b-side (b/w \"Tell Me Girl\"). \"Juliet\" was the only 1964 Number one by a UK group not to chart in America. The US division of Philips Records issued only two of the Four Pennies' singles stateside. Both these singles (\"Juliet\" and \"Until It's Time for You to Go\") were major European hits, but while \"Juliet\" did pick up some airplay on a number of US radio stations, \"Until It's Time For You To Go\" did not. In any event, neither single picked up enough US airplay or sales to chart.\n\nFollowing the UK chart-topping success of \"Juliet\", the Four Pennies racked up subsequent 1964 UK hits with their original \"I Found Out The Hard Way\" and a cover version of Lead Belly's, \"Black Girl\". They also issued an album, \"Two Sides of Four Pennies\", which, as was customary for British acts of the time, mostly ignored their hit singles.\n\nAfter their first single of 1965 did not reach the UK chart, Fryer left the Four Pennies to found a folk trio called Fritz, Mike and Mo. (The single's b-side, \"A Place Where No-One Goes\", found success in Turkey later that year). Fryer was replaced on guitar by David Graham. The revamped quartet then hit the UK chart again with \"Until It's Time for You to Go\", written by Buffy Sainte-Marie. 1966 saw the final UK chart entry for the Four Pennies, with a cover version of Bobby Vinton's \"Trouble Is My Middle Name\". Fryer then returned to the fold, replacing Graham.\n\nThey finished 1966 – and their career – with a non-charting album (\"Mixed Bag\"), and two non-charting singles: UK songwriter Charles Bell's \"Keep The Freeway Open\", and Tom Springfield's \"No More Sad Songs For Me\". By the end of the year, the group had dissolved.\n\n\nOriginal and final line-up:\n\nAlso:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2328748", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2328748", "title": "Nadruvians", "text": "Nadruvians\n\nThe Nadruvians were one of the now-extinct Prussian clans. They lived in Nadruvia (alternative spellings include: \"Nadruva\", \"Nadrowite\", \"Nadrovia\", \"Nadrauen\", \"Nadravia\", \"Nadrow\" and \"Nadra\"), a large territory in northernmost Prussia. They bordered the Skalvians on the Neman (Nemunas) River just to the north, the Sudovians to the east, and other Prussian tribes to the south and west. Most information about the clan is provided in a chronicle by Peter von Dusburg.\n\nIn 1236 Peter of Dusburg wrote that Nadruvia was the location of Romuva, the sacred center of Baltic religion. From Romuva Kriwe, the chief priest or \"pagan Pope\", ruled over the religion of all the Balts. No other sources mention the place. Scientists have considerable doubts if such an organized structure existed.\n\nAs the northernmost clan, Nadruvians were conquered last by the Teutonic Knights, a German crusading military order. In 1230 the Knights set up their base in the Chełmno Land and proceeded to conquer all pagans and convert them to Christianity. The first military encounters between Nadruvians and the Knights began ca. 1255 when the Knights were trying to conquer Sambians, western neighbors of Nadruvians. Dusburg alleges that Nadruvians had several fortresses with strong garrisons. Two distorted names are given (\"Otholicia\" and \"Cameniswika\") and it is very difficult to identify their location. Nadruvians built another castle at Velowe when the Knights reached their lands. Sambians had to surrender in 1277, but the conquest of Nadruvians was delayed by the Great Prussian Uprising that broke out in 1260. The uprising ended in 1274, and Nadruvians fell in 1275. Prussian fortress at Velowe was captured by the Germans and renamed to \"Wehlau\". A handful of Nadruvians retreated into Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The rest were incorporated into the Monastic state of the Teutonic Knights and merged with German Settlers. Eventually, sometime after the 16th century, Nadruvians became extinct.\n\nLinguists offer a few derivations for the name of the clan:\n\n\nWhile most linguists agree that Nadruvians were one of the Prussian clans, some historians argue that they were a separate tribe, more closely related to western Lithuanians than to Prussians. The matter is further complicated by the fact that the area was largely depopulated by the crusades against Prussians and Lithuanians. It was repopulated by bringing colonists from Germany and Lithuania (see Lithuania Minor). Therefore, it is impossible to determine whether Lithuanians originally lived there or migrated later on.\n"}

One of Sensors Unlimited's major customers is NASA. Currently, Olsen is President of GHO Ventures, LLC, in Princeton, New Jersey, where he manages his angel investments, South African winery, Montana ranch, and performs numerous speaking engagements to encourage children – especially minority and female children – to consider careers in science or engineering. He also is a physics professor at Rider University.\n\nOlsen, born in Brooklyn, New York, was the son of an IBEW Local 3 electrician. His mother was a school teacher. He grew up in Bay Ridge and graduated from Ridgefield Park High School, Ridgefield Park, New Jersey in 1962. Olsen initially wanted to be a baseball player but realised from local little league how tough the standard was. Olsen was inspired by his father to become an electrician, always having the education at home to fix things in-house instead of calling a repairman. \n\nAfter being written off as a failure by teachers due to poor grades in high school, Olsen planned to join the United States Army until he was counseled to try college for several months. Through an IBEW Local 3 scholarship, Olsen attempted college, kept his grades high, and graduated \"magna cum laude\" with multiple degrees from Fairleigh Dickinson University. He later graduated with a PhD in materials science from the University of Virginia. He had two daughters (Kim and Krista) and has six grandchildren: Justin Dibsie, Carter Dibsie, Danielle Dibsie, Romina Lapadula, Athina Lapadula, and Oriana Lapadula. \n\nOlsen admits to little business training and believes that for companies making less than 100 million (the smaller companies as he calls them) that success is based more on “intuition, instinct and hard work.” He does credit his success to his graduate science training. “Two of my start-up companies are from the fields I trained in. For instance, my first company EPITAXX (a supplier of optical detectors and receivers for fiber optic telecommunications and cable television networks) relied on my knowledge of physics and material science.” Olsen likes to put his money into high-risk start-ups.\nOlsen founded EPITAXX, a fiberoptic detector manufacturer in 1984 together with Vladimir Ban. It was sold in 1990 for $12 million. He then founded Sensors Unlimited in 1992 with Dr. Marshall J. Cohen. Sensors was sold to Finisar Corp. for $600 million in 2000. It was then repurchased by the management team in 2002 for $6 \nmillion, and sold once more to Goodrich, Corp. in 2005 for $60 million.\n\nHaving flown to the International Space Station (ISS) with Soyuz TMA-7 (launched October 1, 2005, docked October 3) and landed with Soyuz TMA-6 (October 10), Olsen is the third self-funded space tourist to visit the ISS, following Dennis Tito (2001) and Mark Shuttleworth (2002) (all three space tourists flew through Space Adventures, Ltd.). Olsen has made some comments indicating that he is unhappy with the \"space tourist\" designation. The following is from National Geographic's coverage \"Space Launch – Along for the Ride (2007)\": \"Greg: The term space tourist implies that you`ll write a check and you go for a joyride. And believe me that is not the case at all. Narrator: Greg worked hard to get this far, training for two years with the Russian Space Agency.\"\n\nOlsen had to train for a year and a half before being ready to go into space. During a routine x-ray, a black spot was found on his lung. He had to have a monthly medical check to obtain permission to fly. It took 9 months for him to pass the medical.\n\nHe conducted several experiments in remote sensing and astronomy while aboard the space station. Dr. Olsen is a licensed Amateur Radio radio operator holding FCC callsign KC2ONX and spoke to students via ham radio from space through the ARISS project. In an informal presentation at a New Jersey high school, Dr. Olsen estimated the price of his space excursion at US$20 million.\n\n\n\n"}

The audiobooks are presented in unabridged format with the exception of a handful of missing stories from the first book.\n\nAs of 2017, the books had collectively sold more than seven million copies, and appeared on numerous children's best-seller lists. They have collectively been hailed as a \"cultural touchstone for a generation,\" with the original charcoal and ink artwork by Gammell often singled out for praise. They have also frequently been the subject of criticism from parents and social groups who consider them inappropriate for children.\n\nA film adaptation of the same name was released on August 9, 2019.\n\n<onlyinclude></onlyinclude>\n\nTo celebrate the books' 30th anniversary in 2011, HarperCollins re-released the books with new illustrations from Brett Helquist. The new illustrations were generally regarded as more kid-friendly and less disturbing, resulting in widespread criticism from fans of the original. In 2017, the books were re-issued with the original artwork.\n\nThis series is listed by the American Library Association as being the most challenged series of books from the 1990s, and seventh most challenged from the 2000s. It again made the list in 2012. Complaints have typically centered on its violence, disturbing subject matter, and potential unsuitability for younger readers, as well as religious concerns. Critics have called the stories, many of which feature macabre topics such as murder, disfigurement and cannibalism, \"sick...repulsive,\" and \"really disgusting...not appropriate for children.\" The nightmarish artwork by Stephen Gammell has also been a subject of criticism. Among the groups who have attempted to have the book removed from school libraries are local parent groups and Concerned Women for America; defenders have included the American Library Association and The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books.\n\nDefenders of the books have claimed that they are aimed at \"middle-school kids, who are perfectly able to cope with this kind of thing,\" and that the stories \"help children deal with reality by putting faces on what they're afraid of.\"\n\nIn 2019, a documentary about the book series titled \"Scary Stories\" was released. It explores the process of the books' creation (including the artwork and the folkloric inspiration of the stories), their legacy, and the controversy surrounding attempts to ban them. Featured interviews include family members of the deceased Alvin Schwartz, as well as R.L. Stine and several other authors of 1980s and 1990s children's horror. It debuted at Panic Fest in Kansas City.\n\nThe Horror Writers Association announced on February 9, 2018, that they would be compiling a new tribute anthology entitled \"New Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark\", to be edited by Jonathan Maberry, and featuring submissions from HWA members.\n\nIn 2013, CBS Films acquired the rights to the \"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark\" books from 1212 Entertainment who initially optioned the material, with the intent of producing the material as a potential feature film. It was announced in 2014 that writer John August was set to pen the film.\n\nOn January 14, 2016, it was reported that Guillermo del Toro would develop the project for CBS Films, and would also potentially direct. On February 24, 2016, CBS Films hired screenwriting brothers duo Dan and Kevin Hageman to polish the draft written by August, and the script was ultimately credited to the Hagemans, with Del Toro, Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton receiving a \"story by\" credit.\n\nDel Toro produced the film along with Sean Daniel, Jason Brown, and Elizabeth Grave, with Roberto Grande and Joshua Long executive producing. In August 2018, Michael Garza, Austin Abrams, Gabriel Rush, Austin Zajur and Natalie Ganzhorn were cast, with André Øvredal directing.\n\nThe film was released on August 9, 2019, by Lionsgate and CBS Films.\n"}

When it was published in 1994, it caused a considerable uproar for a number of reasons. It also made him well known outside Russia, and provided a detailed look at Soviet intelligence and Soviet internal politics during his years at the top.\n\nIt is a somewhat problematic work for several reasons. For one, it was based in large part on Sudoplatov's memory, 40 years or more after the events which form the bulk of the book. For another, it was written with the help of his son Anatoli and two American writers, Jerrold and Leona Schecter, with Sudoplatov's contributions being a series of interviews, which the others turned into a book. Finally, the Schecters have produced other works on this topic which are problematic.\n\nThe book contains a number of incorrect statements. One example is the misidentification of the source codenamed \"MLAD\" as Bruno Pontecorvo, instead of Theodore Hall. Various reasons for this are possible; for one, as the book was written over 40 years later, Sudoplatov's memory may have been in error. (The transcript of the interview where he made the error records him responding to a question as to whether MLAD was Pontecorvo by saying \"I think so; Yes.\") Also, Hall was at the time unknown in the West, and Sudoplatov may have wished to protect him. Other mis-statements have been attributed to a desire on the part of Sudoplatov (who never changed his allegiance) to cause trouble in the West.\n\nStill, the book contains a great deal of material that is of value, and even critics who note problems with it feel that it has considerable value. For instance, Alexei Kojevnikov wrote that \"Sudoplatov is quite reliable when he writes about his own unit, subordinates and, probably, agents directly connected to it and their assignments.\" Overall, it is important as a rare, detailed, inside view of the Soviet intelligence agencies during their golden era, and of the power struggles at the top of the Soviet system during and just after the death of Stalin.\n\nThe principal source of controversy it engendered was that it stated that a number of Western scientists, including Niels Bohr, Robert Oppenheimer and others, while not agents for the Soviets, had provided (in some cases unwittingly) information that was useful to the Soviet atomic bomb program; this has been deeply disputed.\n\nThe dispute is about very subtle points: there is no question, for instance, that Bohr met with a Soviet intelligence agent, and discussed atomic questions with him (the transcript of the meeting has been made public by the Russian State Archives); the issue is whether anything he said was not merely a repetition of information that was already public, and how much help (if any) Bohr's statements were to the Soviet atomic program. The fact that so many people were involved in creating the text may have subtly changed the meaning of Sudoplatov's statements, which would be a problem when treating such a diffuse topic.\n\nThe book also confirmed that Julius and Ethel Rosenberg had worked for Soviet intelligence, although it pointed out that their role was not very important.\n\nHowever, the material on the atomic espionage is only a small part of the book. It also details many Soviet intelligence operations, mostly those with which Sudoplatov has personal involvement. For the period after Sudoplatov's arrival in Moscow, it also discusses the political machinations, both inside the intelligence services, and at the top of the Soviet Government.\n\nFor instance, the events surrounding the falls of Nikolai Yezhov and Lavrentii Beria are given in considerable detail, as are the events in the Soviet Union leading up to World War II, and Joseph Stalin's reaction to the outbreak of the war.\n\nThe controversy around the atomic information charges led to questions about who had written the book, and whether Sudoplatov had deliberately made misrepresentations.\n\nA number of parties, including Russia's own Foreign Intelligence Service, contended that Sudoplatov exaggerated his own role when writing his autobiography. Members of the Soviet atomic bomb project felt Sudoplatov's claims about the amount of information provided to them by Soviet intelligence denigrated the scientists' role in the creation of Soviet atomic bombs.\n\n"}

As the cactus ages, more ribs may be added and it becomes more cylindrical in shape, growing up to about tall and in diameter. In the wild, globose to cylindrical stem is covered with a whitish flocking of trichomes. Some horticultural varieties lack the flocking.\n\nIn the wild, the cacti flower in early spring, so that their seeds can grow with summer rains. In cultivation this differs, and the plants may flower in summer. Plants produce one or more flowers diameter near the apex; the numerous tepals are creamy yellow, sometimes with an orange or red base. Pollinated flowers develop into a hairy reddish fruit about in diameter. Plants may take up to six years to flower. \"A. myriostigma\" is commonly grown as an ornamental plant in cactus collections.\n\nThis plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. \n\n"}
{"id": "2328816", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2328816", "title": "Caviomorpha", "text": "Caviomorpha\n\nCaviomorpha is the rodent infraorder or parvorder that unites all New World hystricognaths. It is supported by both fossil and molecular evidence. The Caviomorpha was for a time considered to be a separate order outside the Rodentia, but is now accepted as a genuine part of the rodents. Caviomorphs include the extinct Heptaxodontidae (giant hutias) and extant families of chinchilla rats, hutias, guinea pigs and the capybara, chinchillas and viscachas, tuco-tucos, agoutis, pacas, pacaranas, spiny rats, New World porcupines, coypu and octodonts (Vassallo and Antenucci, 2015).\n\nThe first known rodent fossils in South America are represented by the three taxa \"Cachiyacuy contamanensis\", \"C. kummeli\", and \"Canaanimys maquiensis\", as well as teeth from \"Eobranisamys\" sp. (Dasyproctidae) and \"Eospina\" sp., the latter two found also in the Santa Rosa fauna from the late Eocene or early Oligocene. By the late Oligocene, all superfamilies and most families of caviomorphs are present in the fossil record.\n\nDuring this time, South America was isolated from all other continents. Several hypotheses have been proposed as to how hystricognath rodents colonized this island continent. Most require that a small group of these rodents traveled across ocean bodies atop a raft of mangroves or driftwood.\n\nThe most common hypothesis suggests that the ancestor to all modern caviomorphs rafted across the Atlantic Ocean (then narrower) from Africa (Lavocat, 1969; Huchon and Douzery, 2000). This is supported by molecular results, which suggest that the Phiomorpha (as restricted to Bathyergidae, Petromuridae, and Thryonomyidae) are sister taxa to the Caviomorpha. In fact, until the discovery of the Laotian rock rat, all modern hystricognath families were restricted to South America, Africa, or had a range that included Africa (Hystricidae).\n\nThe principal alternative hypothesis is that the caviomorph ancestor arose in Asia and migrated to South America through another continent. Most commonly, North America is cited as the most likely continent (Wood, 1985) as connections between North America and Asia were common via Beringia, and North America appears to have been closer to South America than any other continent at this time. The \"Franimorpha\" were once proposed as a potential North American rodent group that may represent an ancestor to the Caviomorpha, but most modern researchers consider franimorphs to have been protrogomorphous instead of hystricomorphous.\n\nFossil evidence suggests the Entodacrya may have originated in Asia (Marivaux et al., 2004) and this is cited as potential evidence for an Asian origin for Caviomorpha as well. Likewise, Jenkins et al. (2005) argue that their discovery of a hystricognath rodent family (Laonastidae) exclusive to Asia may be further evidence for an Asian origin of caviomorphs.\n\nAlternatively, the caviomorphs may have originated in Asia, but traveled through Africa, Australia and Antarctica, or Africa and Antarctica (noted but not advocated by Huchon and Douzery, 2001). Alternatively they may have originated in Africa and traveled to South America via Antarctica.\n\nNew World monkeys appear to have colonized South America from Africa at a similar time.\n\nCaviomorphs went on to colonize the West Indies as far as the Bahamas, reaching the Greater Antilles by the early Oligocene. This is commonly viewed as another example of oceanic dispersal, although a role for a possible land bridge has also been considered.\n\nCaviomorph rodents underwent an explosive diversification upon arrival into South America. They managed to outcompete other animals in rodent-like niches such as certain South American marsupials. Retaining predominantly herbivorous diets, they expanded their sizes to encompass a range from rat-sized echimyids to the bison-sized \"Phoberomys\". Their ecologies included burrowing gopher-like forms such as tuco-tucos, arboreal forms such as porcupines and certain spiny rats, running forms such as maras, and aquatic forms such as the capybara and nutria (Vassallo and Antenucci, 2015). Habitats range from grasslands (maras), high mountains (chinchillas and chinchilla rats), forest edges (prehensile-tailed porcupines) and dense tropical forests (pacas and acouchis).\n\nAlthough many species of caviomorphs have migrated into Central America since the Great American Interchange, only a single living species, the North American porcupine, has naturally colonized North America north of Mexico (the extinct capybara \"Neochoerus pinckneyi\" also accomplished this feat). The nutria has been introduced into North America and has proven a highly successful invasive species there.\n\n\nNote that some changes to this taxonomy have been suggested by molecular studies. The Dinomyidae may belong to the Chinchilloidea, the Abrocomidae may belong to the Octodontoidea, and the Hydrochaeridae may have evolved from within the Caviidae.\n\n"}

Many record labels practice recoupment, and most new artists have little choice but to accept it since they lack the negotiating power to obtain a better contract.\n\nSuppose that a music label gives a band a $250,000 advance to record an album. The label agrees to do so in return for 90% of the sales. In addition, the label will specify certain standards for production of the album, for example, which studios the band will engage. The label may even hold the advance and make all disbursements on the band's behalf, ensuring the funds are used exactly as agreed. In other words, the $250,000 advance is not simply pocketed by the band -- it is to be spent on album production and the band's reasonable expenses during production. The album is recorded, and sells 200,000* copies at $10 each, yielding $2m. The record company takes 90% of this as agreed, leaving the band with $200,000 of their own. This is the situation without recoupment.\n\nWith recoupment, the label advances the band $250,000 as before. As before, the band (or the label, on the band's behalf) spends substantially all of the advance to produce an album meeting the label's specifications. The album again sells 200,000 copies at $10 each, yielding $2m. The record company takes 100% of the first $250,000 in sales (recouping the $250,000 advance to the band), and 90% of all further sales, as agreed. The band's net is effectively reduced to 0% of the first $250,000 in sales and 10% of the further $1.75m, leaving them with a total of $175,000.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Recoupment deals primarily involve new artists, or those without a proven sales history, so selling 200,000 copies would be fairly unusual. More typically, 10,000 or fewer copies are sold by a new artist.

Its title, a reference to watercolor painting, is a clear reference to the rain. He also wrote \"Três lágrimas\" (Three Teardrops) on that same night, before the rain ended.\n\nDescribing the song in an interview to Marisa Lira, of the newspaper \"Diário de Notícias\", Barroso said that he wanted to \"free the samba away from the tragedies of life, of the sensual scenario already so explored\". According to the composer, he \"felt all the greatness, the value and the wealth of our land\", reliving \"the tradition of the national panels\".\n\nInitially, he wrote the first chords, which he defined as \"vibrant\", and a \"plangent of emotions\". The original beat \"sang on [his] imagination, highlighting the sound of the rain, on syncope beats of fantastic tambourins\". According to him, \"the rest came naturally, music and lyrics at once\". He declared to have felt like another person after writing the song.\n\nBefore being recorded, \"Aquarela do Brasil\", initially named \"Aquarela brasileira\", was performed by the baritone on \"Joujoux e Balangandans\", a benefit concert sponsored by Darci Vargas, then First Lady of Brazil. It was then recorded by Francisco de Morais Alves, arranged by Radamés Gnattali and his orchestra, and released by Odeon Records in August 1939. It was also recorded by , and despite the singer's huge popularity at the time, the song was not a success, perhaps because the song was not adjusted to her tenor voice.\n\n\"Aquarela do Brasil\" took a while to succeed. In 1940, it was not among the top three songs of that year's Carnival in Rio. The president of the jury was Heitor Villa-Lobos, and Barroso, offended that his masterpiece was not on the list, ended his relationship with him. The two men would only speak to each other again fifteen years later, when both received the National Order of Merit.\n\nThe song only became famous after it was included in Walt Disney's 1942 animated film \"Saludos Amigos\", sung by Aloísio de Oliveira. After that, the song became known not only in Brazil, but worldwide, becoming the first Brazilian song to be played over a million times on American radio. Due to the huge popularity achieved in the United States, it received an English version by songwriter Bob Russell.\n\nIt was voted by the Brazilian edition of \"Rolling Stone\" as the 12th greatest Brazilian song.\n\nThis song, because of its exaltation of Brazil's great qualities, marked the creation of a new genre within samba, known as (exaltation samba). This musical movement, with its extremely patriotic nature, was seen by many as being favorable to the dictatorship of Getúlio Vargas, which generated criticism towards Barroso and his work, as if he were kowtowing to the regime. The Barroso family, however, strongly denies these claims, pointing out that he also wrote an anti-Nazi song named \"Salada Mista\" (Mixed salad), recorded by Carmen Miranda in October 1938. Vargas, although not a fascist himself, was as sympathetic to such regimes in the early years of his presidency as the European governments of the time.\n\nThe Department of Press and Propaganda, the official censorship body of the regime, wanted to censor the verse \"terra do samba e do pandeiro\" (\"land of samba and the pandeiro\"), which was seen as being \"derogatory\" for Brazil's image. Barroso persuaded the censors to keep the line.\n\nSome criticism to the song, at the time, was that it used expressions little known by the general public, such as \"inzoneiro\", \"merencória\", and \"trigueiro\" (intriguing, melancholic, and swarthy), and that he was too redundant in the verses \"meu Brasil brasileiro\" (\"my Brazilian Brazil\") and \"esse coqueiro que dá coco\" (\"this coconut palm that produces coconut\"). The composer defended his work, saying that these expressions were poetic effects inseparable from the original composition. On the original recording, Alves sung \"mulato risoneiro\" (laughing mulatto) instead of \"inzoneiro\" because he was unable to understand Barroso's illegible handwriting.\n\nThe Portuguese lyrics are as sung by Francisco Alves (chorus in brackets).<br>\nThe S. K. Russel English version is from the sheet music by Southern Music Publishing Company.<br>\nThe tune of the first four lines of the introduction is the same as the first instrumental break in the Alves version.\n\nThe song has received many successful recordings through the years, being played in many different genres, ranging from its original samba genre to disco. It is one of the 20 most recorded songs of all time.\n\nIn 1943, Spanish-born bandleader Xavier Cugat reached number two on the Best Sellers List and number nine on the Harlem Hit Parade with his version of \"Brazil\". Django Reinhardt recorded \"Brazil\" three times between 1947 and 1953. In 1957, Frank Sinatra recorded the song in \"Come Fly With Me\". He was followed by other successful artists of the time such as Bing Crosby, Ray Conniff, and Paul Anka.\n\nDuring the Brazilian military dictatorship, MPB singer Elis Regina performed what is perhaps the darkest version ever of \"Aquarela do Brasil\", accompanied by a chorus of men reproducing chants of the Native Brazilians. In 1975, American band The Ritchie Family reached number-one on the \"Billboard\" Hot Dance Club Play chart for seven weeks with their disco version of the song.Other successful Brazilian singers such as Antônio Carlos Jobim, Erasmo Carlos, João Gilberto, Gal Costa, and Simone also recorded versions of the song at the same period.\n\nThe song was featured prominently in Terry Gilliam's 1985 film \"Brazil\", which was named after it. It was recorded by Geoff Muldaur for the soundtrack, but parts of the song were also incorporated throughout the orchestral score by Michael Kamen, including a Kate Bush version. Afterwards, in the 1990s, it was recorded by both Harry Belafonte and Dionne Warwick.\n\nIn 2007, singer-songwriter Daniela Mercury, which recorded the most recent cover of the song by a Brazilian artist, was invited to perform the song at the end of the opening ceremony of the XV Pan American Games, held in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nIn 2009, the Recording Academy added the 1942 recording of \"Brazil (Aquarela do Brasil)\" by Jimmy Dorsey & His Orchestra, released as Decca 18460B, to the Grammy Hall of Fame. Jimmy Dorsey was the first to record the song on July 14, 1942 and release it with the English lyrics by Bob Russell sung by Bob Eberly and Helen O'Connell.\n\nAlso in 2009, American band Beirut performed \"Brazil\" for their live DVD \"Beirut: Live At The Music Hall Of Williamsburg\".\n\nITV used a cover of this song by Thiago Thomé as the theme song for their coverage of the 2014 FIFA World Cup which took place in Brazil in June and July 2014. During the tournament's opening ceremony, its first verses were performed live by Brazilian singer Claudia Leitte before being joined onstage by Pitbull and Jennifer Lopez to sing \"We Are One (Ole Ola)\".\n\nFilms\nTelevision programs\n"}

It operated three stations: City Channel Dublin, City Channel Galway, and Channel South. The channel was replaced by RTÉ One +1 on 13 March 2012.\n\nCity Channel was given a licence by the BCI (now the BAI) on 31 January 2005 and began broadcasting in October 2005.\n\nCity Channel was originally launched on the NTL and Chorus cable services in Dublin, Galway and Waterford, however all four services were available on the digital services of UPC Ireland. The company was also granted a licence for a fourth station called City 7, which would have been targeted at Dublin's Eastern Europeans.\n\n\"The Evening Show\" was City Channel's prime time early evening entertainment programme. It was presented by Jimmy Greeley, who also has radio programme on 4fm, and Olive Geoghegan. It was broadcast daily from Monday to Friday at 7pm and covered a wide range of topics. \n\n\"The Guest List\" was City Channel's entertainment programme. Presented by Judy Gilroy and Olive Geoghegan, the show features a strong mix of red carpet, fashion and music events.\n\n\"Gay Nation\" was tailored specifically to the needs and tastes of the Gay Community. Each episode tackled the big issues affecting everyday gay life in Ireland, from marriage equality to job security. The programme aimed to appeal to all sections of the enormously diverse gay population and is presented by Joe Kearney.\n\n\"The Evening Show: Extra\" was a compilation of the best bits of City Channel's flagship programme 'The Evening Show'. Presented by Judy Gilroy, this programme took a look back at some of the most memorable moments of City Channel's flagship show.\n\n\"\"The Warehouse\"\" was a show hosted by newcomer to the presenting scene, Erich King. Each episode featured an interview with a comedian and a band which was great for new talent as bands and comedians were getting the chance to showcase their talent on a regional station, exposing them to many more people than usual. This was a new show to the station and lasted for 5 episodes before the channel closed down in September 2011.\n\nThe company was headed by David Harvey, who also founded the original station and is based in Dublin. \n\nIn August 2007, Liberty Ventures, a subsidiary of Liberty Global, purchased a 35% stake in the company, saying that they were looking to expand the City Channel format to Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nIn January 2010 it was announced that City Channel received €400,000 from its investors. The investment will be used to provide security for any difficult trading that may occur during 2010 for the channel, for a new joint venture with a UK partner and to help their fledgling production company city productions, which currently produces Xccelerate for 3e. It is hoped that such productions can be repeated on City Channel. Like the other Irish channels launched between 2005 and 2008, it has been through a \"major trauma\", Setanta Ireland having closed their UK channels, Channel 6 and Bubble Hits closing down. \n\nIn August 2011, City Channel announced they were in financial difficulties and were to begin to look to restructure their business. In September 2011, it was announced that City Channel will close. Towards the end David Harvey owned 45%, while 35% was owned by Liberty Global owners of UPC Ireland. The channel had hoped to be in the Black by 2008, however the economic climate in Ireland caused problems for the channel since 2009 with advertising sales plummeting by 50%. UPC will continue to broadcast the channel until its closure, and hopes to find a replacement for subscribers.\n\nThe channel ceased all operations on 13 March 2012, when the channel was replaced by RTÉ One +1 on the UPC Ireland EPG.\n\nCity Channel Dublin was the first service to be launched, beginning broadcasting in October 2005. The station carried Dublin-specific programmes such as hourly news bulletins between 16:00 and 22:00 and a number of magazine programmes, in addition to what was available on the other channels.\n\nCity Channel Galway launched in March 2006 after the initial success of the Dublin station. For the most part, the station broadcast the same programmes, with the exception of hourly news bulletins between 18:00 and 20:00, which focused on Galway City and County, and a number of magazine shows.\n\nCity Channel Waterford launched in March 2006 as well, but was expanded and renamed in November 2008 as Channel South, and was available in several counties: Clare, Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford. The station shared a large amount of programming with City Channel, but also produced a number of its own programmes focusing on the south of the country, such as \"South Tonight\", a daily news bulletin.\n\nAlso referred to as City Channel Eastern Europe, City 7 was to be launched in early 2009 and would have screen programmes aimed at the large section of the Dublin community who are originally from Eastern Europe. The company's other stations already carried programmes, such as \"Oto Polska\", which was a partial collaboration with the Polish broadcaster Telewizja Polska.\n\nDue to cutbacks it was delayed until further notice.\n"}

She attracted national and international media attention in August 2005 for her extended antiwar protest at a makeshift camp outside President George W. Bush's Texas ranch—a stand that drew both passionate support and criticism. Sheehan ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 2008. She was a vocal critic of President Barack Obama's foreign policy. Her memoir, \"Peace Mom: A Mother's Journey Through Heartache to Activism\", was published in 2006. In an interview with \"The Daily Beast\" in 2017, Sheehan continued to hold her critical views towards George W. Bush, while also criticizing the militarism of Donald Trump.\n\nSheehan was the 2012 vice-presidential nominee of the Peace and Freedom Party, and received 1.2% of the statewide vote in the 2014 California gubernatorial election.\n\nCindy Sheehan was born Cindy Lee Miller in Inglewood, California, in 1957. Her father worked at the Lockheed Corporation while her mother raised her family. Sheehan graduated with honors from Cerritos College and studied history at UCLA. She worked as a youth minister at St. Mary's Catholic Church in Vacaville, California for eight years, and also coordinated an after-school program for at-risk middle school children for the City of Vacaville. In 1977, she married Patrick Sheehan in Norwalk, California; they had four children, including Casey Sheehan (born in 1979), who was killed in action in Iraq on April 4, 2004. Patrick Sheehan filed for divorce on August 12, 2005, citing irreconcilable differences.\n\nCasey Austin Sheehan (May 29, 1979 – April 4, 2004) was a specialist in the United States Army who was killed by enemy action while serving in the Iraq War. He was the son of Patrick Sheehan, a sales representative, and Cindy Sheehan.\n\nIn May 2000, Casey Sheehan enlisted in the United States Army as a light-wheeled vehicle mechanic, MOS 63B. It has been reported that he may have considered enlisting as a chaplain assistant\nMOS 56M. (Sheehan had acted as an altar server during the Palm Sunday mass on the morning of his death).\n\nNear the end of his active service, the U.S. invasion of Iraq began. Sheehan reenlisted, knowing that his unit would be sent there. Sheehan's division, the First Cavalry Division, was sent to Iraq. On March 19, 2004, Sheehan's Battery C, 1st Battalion, 82nd Field Artillery Regiment, arrived at FOB Camp War Eagle in Sadr City. On April 4, 2004, Sheehan was killed in action after volunteering to be part of a Quick Reaction Force to rescue American troops in the \"Black Sunday\" incident that began the Siege of Sadr City.\n\nCasey Sheehan is buried in Vacaville-Elmira Cemetery in Vacaville, California. In May 2006, the tombstone that Casey's family had been designing and commissioned was finally ready and placed at Casey's grave. Cindy Sheehan paid for the tombstone herself, which is normally the case, stating, \"It is important for the rest of Casey's family to have one... I guess the pain of seeing it etched in marble that he is dead is another pain I will have to deal with.\" Cindy Sheehan maintains that the U.S. government \"should have paid for it because of its responsibility for his death.\" The Sheehan family did not want the furnished monument that the government provides because it didn't reflect Casey's entire life or personality.\n\nCasey Sheehan was awarded the Purple Heart and Bronze Star with V for Valor posthumously for his actions April 4, 2004. The chapel at Fort Hood started a new Knights of Columbus chapter that was named the Specialist Casey Austin Sheehan Council. His mother, Cindy Sheehan, became a prominent antiwar activist after his death.\n\nCindy Sheehan said that she initially questioned the urgency of the invasion of Iraq but did not become active in the antiwar effort until after her son's death. Sheehan and other military families met with President George W. Bush in June 2004 at Fort Lewis, near Tacoma, Washington, about three months after her son's death. In a June 24, 2004, interview with the Vacaville \"Reporter\", published soon after the meeting, she stated, \"We haven't been happy with the way the war has been handled. The president has changed his reasons for being over there every time a reason is proven false or an objective reached.\" She also stated that President Bush was \"sincere about wanting freedom for the Iraqis. I know [he] feels pain for our loss. And I know he's a man of God.\"\n\nSheehan gave another interview on October 4, 2004, stating that she did not understand the reasons for the Iraq invasion and never thought that Iraq posed an imminent threat to the United States. She further stated that her son's death had compelled her to speak out against the war.\n\nFor the presidential inauguration in January 2005, Sheehan traveled to Washington, D.C. to speak at the opening of \"Eyes Wide Open: the Human Cost of War,\" a traveling exhibition created by the American Friends Service Committee that displays pairs of combat boots to represent U.S. military casualties. She also traveled with the exhibition to other locations and donated her son Casey's boots, stating, \"Behind these boots is one broken-hearted family.\"\n\nSheehan was one of the nine founding members of Gold Star Families for Peace, an organization she created in January 2005 with other families she met at the inauguration. It seeks to end U.S. presence in Iraq, and provides support for families of soldiers killed in Iraq.\nSheehan gained international attention in early August 2005, when she traveled to President Bush's Prairie Chapel Ranch, just outside Crawford, Texas, demanding a second meeting with the President. She told members of Veterans for Peace, \"I'm gonna say, 'And you tell me, what the noble cause is that my son died for.' And if he even starts to say freedom and democracy, I'm gonna say, bullshit. You tell me the truth. You tell me that my son died for oil. You tell me that my son died to make your friends rich... You tell me that, you don't tell me my son died for freedom and democracy.\" She also vowed not to pay her federal income tax for 2004 because that was the year her son was killed.\n\nIn 2012, Sheehan was sued by the federal government for failure to pay back taxes. \"I feel like I gave my son to this country in an illegal and immoral war. I'll never get him back,\" Sheehan said. \"And, so, if they can give me my son back, then I'll pay my taxes. And that's not going to happen.\" \n\nOn August 6, 2005, Sheehan arrived at the Crawford Peace House On a bus full of combat veterans, including Camilo Mejía and marched along a dirt road in the direction of The Bush Ranch. Stalled by law enforcement from walking all the way to the front door because the group refused to march as ordered “in the Barr ditch, she created a makeshift camp that would be remembered as the “ditch.” Three miles (5 km) from President Bush's Prairie Chapel Ranch near Crawford, Texas, Sheehan announced her intention to stay (sleeping in a pup tent at night) until she was granted a face-to-face meeting with the president. Sheehan started her protest the day the president started a planned five-week vacation. The encampment was publicized widely by the Mintwood Media Collective on behalf of Gold Star Families for Peace and Military Families Speak Out. A few days later, the media began referring to Sheehan's camp as \"Camp Casey.\" \n\nSheehan spent most of the next four weeks in Crawford. On some days as many as 1,500 supporters visited Camp Casey, including members of the U.S. Congress, as well as several notable actors, singers, and civil rights activists.\n\nGold Star Families for Peace, of which Sheehan is a founding member, released a TV commercial featuring Sheehan, broadcast on Crawford and Waco cable channels near Bush's ranch. The group conducted a walk to a police station just outside Bush's ranch and delivered a bundle of oversized letters written by them to First Lady Laura Bush, appealing to her as a mother to support their movement.\n\nOn August 16, Sheehan moved her camp closer to the Bush ranch after being offered the use of a piece of land owned by a supporter, Fred Mattlage.\n\nIn late August, Sheehan stated that she would continue to campaign against the Iraq war even if granted a meeting with Bush. She also announced the Bring Them Home Now Tour, to depart on September 1 and arrive in Washington, D.C., on September 24 for three days of demonstrations. The tour, which covered 42 cities in 26 states, was publicized by the Mintwood Media Collective, and garnered international media coverage. On the third day, Sheehan and about 370 other antiwar activists were arrested for demonstrating on the White House sidewalk.\n\nSheehan's actions led supporters such as Rev. Lennox Yearwood, CEO of the Hip Hop Caucus, to describe her as \"the Rosa Parks of the antiwar movement.\" Sheehan also gained the label of \"Peace Mom\" from the mainstream media.\n\nIn September 2005, Sheehan moved into the Berkeley, California, home of Stephen Pearcy and Virginia Pearcy, where she lived for just over a year, during which time she wrote two books. Also that month, Sheehan met with Senator John McCain, and later called him a \"warmonger.\" Between 2005 and 2007, Sheehan attended several antiwar events in Sacramento organized by the Pearcys. Also in September 2005, the Bring Them Home Now Tour was organized by Gold Star Families for Peace, Iraq Veterans Against the War, Military Families Speak Out, and Veterans For Peace. Inspired by Sheehan and frequently including Sheehan as a speaker, it was a rolling antiwar protest against the Iraq War, beginning in Crawford, Texas, traveling three routes across the country (with rallies along the way) and culminating in a rally in Washington, D.C., later in September 2005.\n\nOn October 24, 2005, Sheehan said that she planned to speak at the White House and then tie herself to the fence. She and 28 others were arrested in a sit-in at the White House on October 26.\n\nSheehan visited London in early December 2005 and was interviewed by BBC Radio 4 and by \"The Guardian\". On December 10, Sheehan addressed the International Peace Conference, organized by the Stop the War Coalition. Later in the evening, she attended the London Premiere of \"Peace Mom\", a play written by Dario Fo about her, in which the role of Sheehan was played by Frances de la Tour. On December 13, Sheehan traveled to Ireland, where she met Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Dermot Ahern. She voiced her objection to U.S. aircraft refueling at Shannon Airport, stating, \"Your government, even though they didn't send troops to Iraq, are complicit in the crimes by allowing the planes to land and refuel.\"\n\nOn January 31, 2006, Sheehan wore a T-shirt reading \"2,245 Dead. How many more?\" to Bush's State of the Union address and was removed and arrested by Capitol Police.\nOn March 7, 2006, Sheehan was arrested in New York \"after blocking the door to the U.S. Mission to the U.N. offices\" during a protest with Iraqi women against the war.\n\nSheehan and Gold Star Families for Peace were awarded the 'Domestic Human Rights Award' by Global Exchange, an international human rights organization based in San Francisco.\n\nSeveral organizations planned a hunger strike to begin on July 4, 2006; Sheehan stated she would participate. On July 5, Sheehan appeared on MSNBC's \"Hardball with Chris Matthews\" to discuss the war and her upcoming hunger strike. On the show, she called Bush \"the biggest terrorist in the world\" and \"worse than Osama Bin Laden,\" and conceded that she would rather live under Venezuela's Hugo Chávez than Bush. Later that month, Sheehan purchased of land in Crawford, Texas, near Bush's private residence.\n\nOn May 26 and May 28, 2007, Sheehan posted two messages to \"Daily Kos\" announcing that she was leaving the Democratic Party after the Democratic-controlled Congress passed a bill authorizing the continued funding of the war in Iraq. She also submitted her resignation as the \"face\" of the American antiwar movement, stating that she wanted to go home and be a mother to her surviving children. However, on July 3, 2007, in response to President Bush's commutation of Scooter Libby's sentence, she announced her return to activism. She focused on her congressional campaign in 2008.\nIn August 2009, Sheehan protested at Martha's Vineyard during President Barack Obama's stay there. According to ABC News: \"Sheehan invoked Senator Ted Kennedy's passing as part of her message, noting that he was firmly antiwar and how he said his proudest vote as a senator was his 2002 vote against the Iraq war.\" On October 5, 2009, Sheehan was arrested with 60 others at the White House protesting President Obama's continuation of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. She told CNN: \"I think the mood of the country and the mood of our movement is getting a little bit more desperate, and [that] this will be the time to be able to translate our tireless activism and work for peace.\" On December 10, 2009, Sheehan protested on the streets of Oslo, Norway, as President Barack Obama accepted the Nobel Peace Prize. In 2009, she was awarded the US Peace Prize by the US Peace Memorial Foundation for “extraordinary and innovative antiwar activism.\"\n\nOn March 20, 2010, Sheehan was again arrested in front of the White House, along with seven others, after they refused to listen to orders by officers of the United States Park Police to clear the sidewalk on Pennsylvania Avenue. On July 12, Sheehan and four other activists were on trial in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia stemming from the arrests. The government decided not to try three others arrested that day, and had their cases dismissed. Sheehan and two others were acquitted of crossing a police line, while the other two were found guilty.\n\nOn May 2, 2011, Sheehan released a statement indicating that she considers the death of Osama bin Laden to be a hoax, stating: \"If you believe the newest death of OBL, you're stupid.\" She referred to America as a\n\"lying, murderous empire\" and told Americans, whom she called \"brainwashed,\" to \"put [their] flags away.\"\n\nIn October 2011, Sheehan was arrested in Sacramento as part of an anti–Wall Street movement.\n\nAlthough Sheehan agreed to stand as the vice presidential nominee of the Socialist Party USA for the 2012 elections, the party's national convention voted on October 15, 2011, to block her candidacy, on the official grounds that she was not a member of the party. The nomination went to Alejandro Mendoza, of Texas.\n\nIn 2017, when President Donald Trump was expected to announce the sending of thousands of additional troops, Sheehan fears that more opposition to the war will be only because of who occupies the presidency, stating, \"If Trump announces that there will be a continued U.S. military presence or an increased presence, I am afraid any opposition from the 'left' will only be anti-Trump, because, of course, Obama escalated in Afghanistan and maintained that illegal war for the entire eight years of his presidency with not a peep from those same pro-DNC forces.\" Additionally, she believes \"nothing but total withdrawal to give the people of Afghanistan autonomy over their own country will be acceptable\" but said that she's concerned about the sincerity of possible protests.\n\nSheehan hosts a weekly radio show which began in 2009. She has interviewed activists and world leaders, including Howard Zinn, Ray McGovern, Ann Wright, and Hugo Chávez. Sheehan maintains a blog, \"Cindy's Soapbox.\"\n\nIn July 2007, Sheehan announced that she would run against Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi for representative of California's 8th District, based on Pelosi's failure to attempt impeachment of Bush. Up until her run for the U.S. Congress, Sheehan lived outside Pelosi's district, in Dixon, California; however, she moved to San Francisco's Mission District after declaring her candidacy. Earlier, in 2006, she had spoken of ambitions to challenge Dianne Feinstein for her seat in the United States Senate.\n\nSheehan ran on a platform of single-payer health care, media reform, overturning all free trade agreements, repealing the Patriot Act, renewable energy, nationalizing oil and electricity, ending the War on Drugs, legalizing cannabis, ensuring all talks in the Middle East are fair to all parties, ending torture, closing Guantanamo Bay detention camp, overseas commitment to cleaning up Superfund sites, ending deregulation, ending No Child Left Behind, and legalizing same-sex marriage. Sheehan lost the 2008 election to the incumbent Pelosi. In a seven-way race, Sheehan came in second with 46,118 votes (16.14%) to Pelosi's 71.56%.\n\nIn the summer of 2012, television personality Roseanne Barr named Sheehan as her running mate for the presidential nomination of the Peace and Freedom Party in the 2012 presidential election. Barr and Sheehan were nominated by that party as its presidential ticket on August 4, 2012.\n\nOn March 12, 2013 Marsha Feinland, state chair of California's Peace and Freedom Party, made the announcement that the central committee of the party had unanimously endorsed Cindy Sheehan for Governor of California in the 2014 election, should Sheehan choose to run.\n\nCindy Sheehan formally announced her campaign for Governor of California at a news conference Tuesday, August 27, 2013 at the State Capitol in Sacramento.\nSheehan said she planned to unseat incumbent Gov. Jerry Brown, and to bring California \"peace, economic equality and environmental sustainability,\" and reforms through an EPIC (End Poverty in California) program. Her EPIC campaign harkened to the End Poverty in California movement campaign of the 1934 California gubernatorial candidate Upton Sinclair. Sinclair garnered 879,537 votes in that race.\n\nSheehan has, through her own blog, described herself as a socialist. In 2010, Sheehan changed her voter registration in California and became a member of the Peace and Freedom Party.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2328878", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2328878", "title": "August Paulsen", "text": "August Paulsen\n\nAugust Paulsen (July 29, 1871 – March 11, 1927) was a Danish-American businessman noted for his philanthropy in the states of Washington and Idaho.\n\nAugust Paulsen was a Danish immigrant, who arrived in America at the age of nineteen. Paulsen arrived in Spokane in the autumn of 1892, where he would later be regarded as a great asset to the community.\n\nPaulsen initially worked in the dairy industry in Spokane and Wallace, ID. However, his interest lay in the mountains of the Coeur d'Alenes district, where productive mining claims were making hard working miners rich. In 1895, Paulsen managed to save $850 to buy a quarter stake in the Hercules mining claim. Paulsen's partners in the claim included Harry, Eugene, and Jerome Day, three brothers, Charles H. Reeves (Dad Reeves), Levi W. Hutton, Frank Rothrock, Damien Cardoner, and the Markwells. These partners all came from working-class backgrounds like Paulsen, and their mining claim was considered \"essentially a poor man's mine\" as a 1927 article of the \"Spokesman-Review\" notes.\n\nThe partners had very little capital with which to work the mine, so much of the digging, drilling, shoring, hauling and other difficult mining work was done by hand. Paulsen is often credited with keeping the partners together, and keeping focus on working and exploring the mine. Upon manually drilling a 1500-foot shaft, the partners finally exposed a high quality ore body in 1901 that proved to be the best in the district. The Hercules mine provided a full six-percent of the nations lead, and also produced good values in silver. The Hercules mine continued production until its closure in 1925.\n\nWith Paulsen's resultant wealth, he poured millions of dollars into the Spokane region, which still benefits the region today. Paulsen's interest in philanthropy and the civic needs of Washington and Idaho make him a notable character in the history of the Inland Pacific Northwest. He is perhaps best remembered within Spokane for the two downtown buildings he constructed that bear his name. Paulsen died in 1927 and was buried in the Riverside Memorial Park in Spokane, Washington.\n\nThe August Paulsen Building was designed by architects Dow and Hubbell, partners John Kennedy Dow and Clarence Z. Hubbell, and built from 1908 to 1911 by the Fredrick Phair Company. It used the then new form of steel construction which allowed the 11-story building to become the tallest building in Spokane, at the time.\n\nThe Paulsen Medical and Dental Building was designed by Gustav Pehrson and built adjacent to the August Paulsen Building. Built between 1928 and 1929, together they are referred to as the Paulsen Center. The Medical and Dental Building is a 15-story Art Deco style skyscraper, with Spanish Moor styled exterior. This building, not completed until after Paulsen's death, includes distinctive penthouse in which Paulsen family members lived until 2007.\n\n\n"}

It first aired on CBS from September 10, 1966, to September 16, 1967, and continued reruns until September 7, 1968. The series was composed of two unrelated segments, \"Space Ghost\" and \"Dino Boy in the Lost Valley\". The series was created by Alex Toth and produced and directed by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. Sometimes it is alternatively called \"Space Ghost & Dino Boy\", to acknowledge the presence of both shows.\n\nSpace Ghost, along with teenaged sidekicks Jan and Jace and their monkey Blip, fight villains in outer space. Usually, Space Ghost's sidekicks would get captured or trapped by the villains, and Space Ghost would have to defeat the villains and save the day. His enemies included Zorak, Brak and his brother Sisto, Creature King, Black Widow (aka Spider Woman), Lokar, Moltar, and Metallus.\n\n\nDino Boy is a young boy called Todd who parachuted out of a crashing plane with his parents still on board.\n\nHe lands in an unknown South American valley where dinosaurs, cavemen, and prehistoric mammals somehow have survived alongside some strange creatures and various tribes like the Moss Men, the Rock Pygmies, the Worm People and the Vampire Men, amongst others.\n\nDino Boy then meets the caveman Ugh (who saves Dino Boy from a \"Smilodon\" when he first arrives) and his pet baby \"Brontosaurus\" Bronty who become his friends in the episodes to come. The cartoon also features a woolly mammoth named Tusko who Ugh would enlist in certain episodes to help him, Dino Boy, and Bronty out.\n\n\nWith the exception of the final two half-hour shows (the \"Council of Doom\" episodes), each episode featured two Space Ghost segments with one Dino Boy segment between them.\n\nThe final two half-hour shows only feature Space Ghost. Additionally, they feature cameos from characters (such as the Herculoids, Moby Dick, the Mighty Mightor, and Shazzan) that would appear in their own Hanna-Barbera series broadcasts on CBS the following (1967–68) season.\n\n\"Space Ghost & Dino Boy\" were released on multiple VHS tapes in the 1980s put out by Worldvision Home Video and later re-released by GoodTimes Home Video under the Kids Klassics label. The episodes on the VHS tape for \"Space Ghost\" were \"The Heat Thing\", \"Zorak\", \"The Creature King\" and the \"Dino Boy\" episode \"The Worm People\". Worldvision released another VHS tape, \"Space Ghost and Dino Boy: Ghostly Tales\"; this contained the episodes \"The Robot Master\", The Energy Monster\", \"Hi-Jackers\", \"The Lure\", and \"The Schemer\". The \"Dino Boy\" episodes were \"Marooned\" and \"The Red Ants\". These same episodes were released in the UK by The Video Collection.\n\nWarner Home Video (via Hanna-Barbera Cartoons and Warner Bros. Family Entertainment) released \"Space Ghost & Dino Boy: The Complete Series\" on DVD in Region 1 on July 17, 2007.\n\nThe DVD edition presents the episodes on two double-sided DVDs, but alters the order from the original air-date order.\n\nDisc 1\n\nDisc 2\n\nThe TV series was adapted into a comic strip by Dan Spiegle, distributed by Gold Key Comics.\n\nIn 2016, Space Ghost and his allies and Dino Boy played a major role in the DC Comics series \"Future Quest\", that also featured characters from various animated series produced by Hanna-Barbera such as \"Jonny Quest\", \"The Herculoids\", \"Birdman and the Galaxy Trio\", \"Frankenstein Jr. and The Impossibles\" and \"Moby Dick and Mighty Mightor\".\n\n"}

A junction with I-96 in Coopersville is three miles to the north and M-45 in Allendale is three miles south. Westbound Leonard goes to Spring Lake, while eastbound goes to Grand Rapids.\n\nThe first white settler in the community was Dr. George W. Scranton, who went there in 1835. The place was at first known as Scranton. A post office by that name opened on July 11, 1838 with Dr. Scranton as postmaster. The office closed on March 1, 1842. However, another early settler had a more lasting influence on the community. Dr. Timothy Eastman of Maine moved to Grand Haven in 1835, where he established a medical practice. Eastman moved to Scranton in 1842. The state legislature organized Polkton Township, named after U.S. President James K. Polk, on March 19, 1845. The first township meeting took place at Eastman's residence on April 17, 1845. Eastman was elected Township Supervisor for several years afterwards, as well as serving as a county judge and various other township offices and continuing his medical practice. He also became the first postmaster of Polkton on May 28, 1846.\n\nWith his sons, Galen and Mason, Eastman platted the village of Eastmanville in 1855. On March 8, 1856, the name of the Polkton post office was changed to Eastmanville. In 1857, Eastmanville nearly became the county seat, having gained the assent of the County Board of Supervisors, but was unable to secure popular support.\n\nAlthough initially prosperous, Eastmanville was soon outpaced by Coopersville when a railway route developed through that town. Eastmanville had been offered a deal by the Detroit and Milwaukee Railway but turned it down. Benjamin Cooper offered a right-of-way through his 640-acres, provided that the depot on his land was the only one within five or six miles in any direction. A 1941 Michigan Writers Project publication described the community as \"a small colony of summer homes on the north bank of the Grand River.\" (The writers group apparently ignored the permanence of several homes and at least one farm in Eastmanville by characterizing it as constituted of \"summer homes.\")\n\nA carved stone at the northeast corner explains the area's history.\n\n"}

He was an English army general, author, colonial administrator and Member of Parliament for Liverpool.\n\nFollowing the death of his mother, Sarah Wood Douglas, in 1779, Howard was raised by his aunt, Helena Baillie, near Edinburgh. As a boy, he wanted to join the Royal Navy and follow in the footsteps of his father and older brother. His father agreed to take him to sea when he was 13, but Sir Charles died of apoplexy while in Edinburgh just after he arrived to collect Howard in 1789. Howard's guardians thought it better that he serve in the Army instead, and he entered the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, in 1790. He was commissioned Second Lieutenant in the Royal Artillery in 1794, becoming Lieutenant a few months later.\n\nIn 1795 he was shipwrecked while in charge of a draft for Canada, and lived with his men for a whole winter on the Labrador coast. Soon after his return to England in 1799 he was made a Captain-Lieutenant. In his regimental service during the next few years, he was attached to all branches of the artillery in succession, becoming Captain in 1804, after which he was placed on half-pay to serve at the Royal Military College (RMC), then located at High Wycombe. He taught military strategy and was an authority on military and naval engineering. He served intermittently as commandant of the senior department and as inspector general of instructions at the RMC. In 1804, Douglas was appointed to a majority in the York Rangers, a corps immediately afterwards reduced. He remained on the roll of its officers until promoted Major-General. The senior department of the RMC at High Wycombe, of which he was in charge, was the forerunner of the Staff College. Douglas was promoted brevet Lieutenant-Colonel in 1806. He served in 1808–09 in the Peninsular War and was present at the Battle of Corunna, after which he took part in the Walcheren Campaign.\n\nOn the death of his half-brother, Vice-Admiral Sir William Douglas in 1809, he succeeded to the baronetcy. In 1812 he was employed in special missions in the north of Spain, and took part in numerous minor operations in that region, but he was soon recalled, the Home Government deeming his services indispensable to the Royal Military College. He became brevet Colonel in 1814 and CB in 1815. He became a fellow of the Royal Society on 25 January 1816.\n\nIn 1816 appeared his \"Essay on the Principles and Construction of Military Bridges\", in 1819, \"Observations on the Motives, Errors and Tendency of M. Carnots System of Defence\", and in the following year his \"A Treatise on Naval Gunnery\" (of which numerous editions and translations appeared up to the general introduction of rifled ordnance). In 1821 he was promoted Major-General. Douglas's criticisms of Carnot led to an important experiment being carried out at Woolwich in 1822, and his \"Naval Gunnery\" became a standard text-book, and indeed first drew attention to the subject of which it treated.\n\nSir Howard Douglas became Governor of New Brunswick (1823–31). He had to deal with the Maine boundary dispute with the United States of 1828. He also founded Fredericton College (King's College), now known as the University of New Brunswick, of which he was the first Chancellor. He was governor during the Miramichi fire of 1825, and his actions during that crisis increased his popularity with the people of the province. He secured a charter for King's College at Fredericton (later the University of New Brunswick). Some subsequent light is shed on local society in his period of office in the novel \"Lady Rosamond's Secret. A Romance of Fredericton\" (1878) by the Rebecca Agatha Armour.\n\nOn his return to Europe he was employed in various missions, and he published about this time \"Naval Evolutions\", a controversial work dealing with the question of breaking the line. From 1835 to 1840 Douglas, now a GCMG, was Lord High Commissioner of the Ionian Islands, where, amongst other reforms, he introduced a new code of laws. In 1837 he became a Lieutenant-General, in 1840 a KCB, in 1841 a civil GCB, and in 1851 a full general. He was given the colonelcy of the 99th (Lanarkshire) Regiment of Foot from 1841 to 1851 when he transferred as colonel to the 15th (the Yorkshire East Riding) Regiment of Foot, a position he held until his death in 1861.\n\nFrom 1842 to 1847 Douglas sat as a Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Liverpool, where he took a prominent part in debates on military and naval matters and on the corn laws. He was frequently consulted on important military questions.\n\nHis later works included \"Observations on the Modern System of Fortification\". and \"On Naval Warfare With Steam\"\n\nSir Howard Douglas died in Tunbridge Wells. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and one of the founders of the Royal Geographical Society. He was awarded an honorary Doctor of Civil Law from Oxford University. Shortly before his death he declined the offer of a military GCB.\n\nIn 1797, while in Quebec City, Douglas fathered a daughter, Margaret (or Marguerite), but did not marry the mother, Catherine Normandeau. In 1799, he returned to England, and in July of that year he married Anne Dundas, daughter of James Dundas. They had ten children, Major Charles Douglas, James Dundas Douglas, Howard Douglas, General Sir Robert Percy Douglas, 4th Baronet of Carr, Reverend William Frederick Douglas, Ann Douglas, Christina Douglas, Lucy Douglas, Sarah Mary Harcourt Douglas, and Mary Douglas.\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\n\n"}

Rendering techniques vary. Some methods create simple flat images or images with basic shadows. A popular technique uses sophisticated software to approximate accurate lighting and materials. This technique is often referred to as a \"Photo Real\" rendering. Renderings are usually created for presentation, marketing and design analysis purposes.\n\n\n3D renderings play a major role in real estate marketing and sales. It also makes it possible to make design related decisions well before the building is actually built. Thus it helps experimenting with building design and its visual aspects.\n\nArchitectural renderings are often categorized into 3 sub-types: Exterior Renderings, Interior Renderings, and Aerial Renderings.\n\nExterior renderings are defined as images where the vantage point or viewing angle is located outside of the building, while interior renderings are defined as images where the vantage point or viewing angle is located inside of the building. Aerial renderings are similar to exterior renderings however their viewing angle is located outside and above the building, looking down, usually at an angle.\n\nTraditionally rendering techniques were taught in a \"master class\" practice (such as the École des Beaux-Arts), where a student works creatively with a mentor in the study of fine arts. Contemporary architects use hand-drawn sketches, pen and ink drawings, and watercolor renderings to represent their design with the vision of an artist. Computer generated graphics is the newest medium to be utilized by architectural illustrators.\n\nDuring the past 20–30 years, many professional architectural illustrators came from an education in architecture first, then moved into the profession as their (mostly self taught) skills in illustration progressed.\n\nUntil 3D computer modeling became common, architectural renderings were generated by hand. There are still architectural illustrators who create renderings entirely by hand, as well as illustrators who use a combination of hand drawing/painting and computer generated color and/or linework. Common mediums for hand-done architectural renderings include: watercolor, colored pencil, gauche, and graphite or charcoal pencil.\n\n"}

As of 2009 it is the fourth-largest airport within the Houston–Sugar Land–Baytown metropolitan area and serves as a \"reliever\" of traffic to this airport. It handles approximately 250 aircraft operations per day, which include corporate business jet and turboprop flights.\n\nThe airport today serves the area's general aviation (GA) aircraft, serving corporate, governmental, and private clientele. It opened a new Terminal in 2006 with a GA complex, including 99 T-hangars in six buildings.\n\nThe City of Houston maintains Cullinan Park, which occupies of land directly north and west of the Sugar Land Regional Airport, blocking expansion. The airport is surrounded by Sugar Land homes, and there is a highway and rail road track directly south of the airport, which also block its expansion. The former Central Unit, a Texas Department of Criminal Justice prison for males, was closed in 2011. It occupied land zoned for airport expansion.\n\nDr. Donald \"Doc\" Hull was an oral surgeon who established a dental program for the Texas Department of Corrections in the early 1950s. Hull, who commuted across Southeast Texas to provide dental care to prisoners, originally operated aircraft to South Houston Airport and Sam Houston Airport. As it expanded, the City of Houston forced those airports to close. The former Sam Houston Airport was annexed as part of Houston's extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ) and became the Westbury area.\n\nHull decided to develop a regional airport more distant from Houston but to serve the area. In 1952 Hull landed his biplane in a field near Sugar Land. Afterward, with a loan from a friend, Hull purchased the property and developed a small airport.\n\nThe City of Sugar Land purchased Hull Field on December 18, 1990 and renamed the airport as \"Sugar Land Municipal Airport.\" The City of Sugar Land opened an NFCT (non-federal control tower) that it funds and operates. This control tower manages traffic within of Sugar Land Airport from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. daily.\n\nSeveral commuter airlines operated scheduled passenger service into Sugar Land Regional over the years. In the fall of 1979, Commutair was flying a \"cross-town\" shuttle service between the airport and Houston Intercontinental Airport (IAH), with de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter twin turboprop aircraft operating up to twelve round-trip flights a day.\n\nThe Commutair service was replaced by Metro Airlines during the 1980s. In the summer of 1983, Metro, operating as an independent air carrier, was flying up to nine round trips a day between Sugar Land and Houston Intercontinental with Twin Otter aircraft. By early 1985, Metro Airlines had entered into a codesharing agreement with Eastern Air Lines and was flying Twin Otter aircraft as Eastern Express between the airport and IAH with up to eleven round trip flights a day.\n\nIn 1993, Austin-based Conquest Airlines announced it would begin intrastate flights from the airport to Austin, (Mueller Airport), Dallas Love Field (DAL), and San Antonio. By 1994, Conquest had dropped flights to San Antonio but was still operating nonstops to Austin and Dallas. In 1995, the airline was operating three nonstop flights a day to Austin with Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner (Metro III model) propjets. By 1996 Conquest was no longer serving Sugar Land Regional.\n\nThe airport does not have any scheduled passenger airline flights.\n\nSugar Land Regional Airport received its current name in October 2002. The airfield was formerly known as Sugar Land Municipal Airport and Hull Field. It is the fourth-largest airport in Greater Houston as of 2009, receiving annual usage from private planes of more than 100 Fortune 500 companies. TXP, Inc. released a report identifying the airport as \"foremost general reliever airport in the southwest sector\" and \"a catalyst for corporate commerce in the Greater Houston market including the Westchase District, Uptown, and Greenway Plaza.\"\n\nThe airport is the fourth-largest in the Houston area, serving as a reliever for William P. Hobby Airport. As of 2010 Sugar Land Regional is the third-busiest airport in Greater Houston by number of aircraft operations.\n\nSugar Land Regional Airport covers an area of and contains one concrete paved runway designated 17/35 which measures 8,000 x 100 ft (2,438 x 30 m). For the 12-month period ending July 28, 2005, the airport had 90,758 aircraft operations, an average of 248 per day: 95% general aviation, 5% air taxi and less than 1% military. In August 2017, there were 139 aircraft based at this airport: 84 single-engine, 18 multi-engine, 34 jet and 3 helicopter.\n\nThe airport includes the former Stanford Aviation hangar, described by Mimi Swartz of \"Texas Monthly\" as \"impeccably landscaped.\" Flights from the terminal went to Antigua.\n\nUS Customs and Border Protection has a small facility at the airport.\n\n"}

{"id": "2328963", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2328963", "title": "American Wirehair", "text": "American Wirehair\n\nThe American Wirehair is a breed of domestic cat originating in upstate New York. , though the breed is well-known, it is ranked as the most rare of the 41 Cat Fanciers' Association breeds.\n\nThe American Wirehair is a spontaneous mutation of the American Shorthair. It first occurred as a random mutation among a litter of five born to a pair of barn cats in 1966 in Vernon, in upstate New York. This single red-and-white male had wiry fur. The owner of the cats called a local breeder of Rex cats, Mrs. Joan O'Shea, to take a look at the kitten. She bought the kitten for $50, along with one of his normal-coated female littermates, to start a breeding program. The wirehaired male was named Council Rock Farms Adams of Hi-Fi ('Adam' for short), and the female Tip-Top.\n\nBreeding between the two produced wirehaired kittens, many of which were sold off to other interested breeders. As the population grew, cats were exported to Canada, and Germany where they are especially popular. The breed did well, and in 1967 it was recognized by the CFA, and in 1978, it was accepted for championship competition. American Wirehairs have yet to make an appearance in Britain and Australia, among other countries.\n\nAmerican Wirehairs are similar to American Shorthairs, with the exception of a springy, wiry coat, including ear fur, and whiskers. This coat is similar to the wire coats of some dog breeds, such as terriers. Their fur requires little grooming, although lighter cats may require sunblock. Wirehairs are of a moderate, sturdy build, with round heads, high cheekbones, and a pronounced muzzle. Females are generally smaller than males. American Wirehairs display the full spectrum of possible cat coat colors, although Himalayan, Chocolate and Lilac are not accepted for competition.

He is currently the Allen M. Glick Professor of Judaic and Biblical Studies and director of the program in Jewish Studies at Clark University.\n\nFox is perhaps best known for his translation into English of the Torah. His translation is heavily influenced by the principles of Martin Buber and Franz Rosenzweig. Buber in 1962 completed their translation of the Hebrew Bible into German. Fox co-translated their \"Scripture and Translation\" into English with Lawrence Rosenwald of Wellesley College (Weissbort and Eysteinsson 562). The main guiding principle of Fox's work is that the aural aspects of the Hebrew text should be translated as closely as possible. Instances of Hebrew word play, puns, word repetition, alliteration, and other literary devices of sound are echoed in English and, as with Buber-Rosenzweig, the text is printed in linear, not paragraph, fashion. He has argued for the superiority of Biblical translations that preserve or reflect such Hebrew forms, and pushes English farther than does Robert Alter, whose translations are motivated by a similar appreciation of the character of the Hebrew original.\n\nFox's translation of the Torah was published in 1995 by Schocken Books (a division of Random House) as The Five Books of Moses. Fox continues to translate, and in 1999 published Give Us a King!, a translation of the books of Samuel. His translation of the complete Early Prophets (the books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel (revised) and Kings) was published in November 2014 as \"The Schocken Bible: Volume II\".\n\nFox served as a religious consultant on the making of the film \"Prince of Egypt\". In the 1970s, he and Cherie Koller-Fox co-created a board game called \"Expulsion: Jewish Life in Spain from the Golden Age to 1492\", which was shown on the TV show, Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, on November 29, 2016.\n\nHe is the husband of Jewish educator Rabbi Cherie Koller-Fox and father of three children, Akiva Fox, Leora Koller-Fox, and Ezra Fox.\n\n\nWeissbort, Daniel and Astradur Eysteinsson. 2006. \"Translation—Theory and Practice: A Historical Reader\", (pp. 562–568 about Fox).

These facilities were deteriorating, and also would not meet the demands of the post-World War II baby boom. As a result, it was decided to build a new central high school. In July, another meeting was held to determine a location for the new school. Harry Wahlert, who owned the Dubuque Packing Company, donated $250,000 towards the construction of the school. Area parishes were also asked to contribute to the funding. The total cost of construction was approximately $3,250,000.\n\nA parcel across from the intersection of Kane and Chaney Streets near the west end of Dubuque was selected as the site for the school. When construction was finished, it measured over 222,000 square feet (20,600 m). In February 1959, the archdiocese announced that the new school would be named in honor of Harry Wahlert. In August the school was officially opened, and the first classes began in September.\nIn 2005, construction commenced on the Mazzuchelli expansion, which utilized the west wing of Wahlert and a new addition next to the school. This facility opened in 2006, and now serves as the central middle school for all Dubuque residents in the Holy Family Catholic Schools.\n\nWahlert Catholic High School is located at 2005 Kane Street on the east side of Dubuque, Iowa. The campus is in size, with its main entrance near the corner of Kane Street and Chaney Road. The three-story building and its grounds accommodate a chapel, running track, tennis courts, soccer field, and baseball field. The Wahlert portion of the campus occupies the eastern wings of the main building, while Mazzuchelli Middle School occupies the far western wing.\n\nThe main gymnasium was renovated in early 2013.\n\nWahlert High School offers opportunities for participation in 19 interscholastic athletic activities. Many of these sports include freshman, sophomore, and junior varsity levels of competition. Sports currently offered to boys include football, cross country, basketball, wrestling, bowling, golf, tennis, track, soccer, baseball, and swimming (co-op with Dubuque Community Schools). Sports offered to girls include cross country, swimming, volleyball, basketball, bowling, golf, tennis, soccer, and softball. Wahlert's varsity athletic teams compete in the Mississippi Valley Conference.\n\nThe girls' volleyball team has won 17 state championships. The women's cross country program won the 3A state title in 2009, 2010 and 2011; the men also won the 3A state title 2003, 2004 and 2010. Women’s soccer won four state titles and the men won in 2008. Men's tennis teams have won the longest run of titles in state history (6): 2004 through 2009. Men's bowling won 1A state titles in 2010 and 2013.\n\nWahlert has two competitive show choirs, the mixed \"Impulse\" and the womens-only \"Impact\". The school also hosts its own competition, dubbed the \"Key City Classic\".\n\n\n\n"}

Originally part of the municipal borough of Colwyn Bay prior to local government reorganisation in April 1974, it is now a separate community whose population at the 2001 census was 1,862 increasing to 1,923 at the 2011 census. The village can be seen in its entirety from Bryn Euryn.\n\nThe name of the village comes from Welsh language words meaning pig (\"moch\") and town (\"tref\"). The origin of the name is explained in one of the mythological Welsh tales known as the Four Branches of the Mabinogi, which were first written down in the early Middle Ages, but which actually go much further back into the history of oral Welsh storytelling. An incident in one of these tales, \"Math fab Mathonwy\", concerns the theft of a herd of sacred pigs. One of the places where the stolen animals were kept overnight became known as Mochdre (\"Pigtown\") as a result.\n\nThe village of Mochdre is noted for its parish church, which is actually the church of the parish of Llangwstennin as it allegedly sits on the site of the oldest Early Christian church in Wales.\n\nIt is the home of Mochdre Pigs football Club.\n\nMochdre has a place in railway history. Sited on the North Wales Coast Line from Chester to Holyhead, it was the location of experimental trackside water troughs, from which passing steam locomotives could scoop up fresh water supplies without having to stop. The troughs were supplied with water from two square ponds to the south of the railtrack and in the fields of the old Eagles farm.\nThe first infant School in Mochdre was held in the Methodist chapel schoolroom in Chapel Street.\nThe station master's house was on the Llangwstennin side of the railway line. It was a two-storey redbrick building and the stationmaster in the 20s and early 30s was a Mr Stretton who, when the railway station closed, went to live in Tan-yr-allt Avenue, Mochdre. \nAbove Llangwstennin Rectory was a shale quarry. The shale was crushed at the quarry and conveyed by a covered belt conveyor down to a rear residing just north of the main railway line where it was so store in silos to be taken to somewhere in England to extract paraffin wax.\nWhen the only road through Mochdre was along the old highway, Thornton steam lorries carrying ruby bricks used to stop on the bridge over the river and replenish their water tanks.\nThese devices became commonplace around the world, but Mochdre was the first place they were ever used, around October 1860. Ironically the exact spot is now a stretch of the A55 dual carriageway, the railway line having been realigned slightly to the west when this section of the road was built in the mid-1980s. Here too was Mochdre & Pabo railway station, closed originally in January 1917 as a World War I economy measure, reopened in May 1919, and finally closed for good in January 1931. The area has been established an industrial area with much industrial and wholesale retail activity, notably Quinton Hazell, a large automotive accessories manufacturer being their base in the village. Latterly this complex is home to the Quinton Hazell Enterprise Park, incorporating mixed office and industrial accommodation.\n\nMochdre is also the name of the electoral ward, whose boundaries are coterminous with the community. The ward elects a county councillor to sit on Conwy County Borough Council. It is currently (2017) represented by Cllr Adrian Tansley of the Welsh Labour Party.\n\nThe ward also elects or co-opts up to twelve community councillors to Mochdre Community Council.\n\n"}

He has historically borne the nickname, \"\"Le roi d'un jour\"\" (king for a day). \n\nSaul's father was Samuel Judah Katzenellenbogen. Wahl had thirteen children, including the renowned Polish rabbi, Meir Wahl Katzenellenbogen.\n\nWhile no physical evidence exists to prove the veracity of the story that Saul was briefly king of Poland, it has nonetheless gained a firm place in the folklore of the Jewish people. The version of the story set forth in the \"Jewish Encyclopedia\" reads as follows:\n\nAt a point in his life, Lithuanian noble Nicholas Radziwill, wishing to do penance for the many atrocities he had committed while a young man, undertook a pilgrimage to Rome in order to consult the pope as to the best means for expiating his sins. The pope advised him to dismiss all his servants and to lead for a few years the life of a wandering beggar. After the expiration of the period prescribed, Radziwill found himself destitute and penniless in Padua, Italy. His appeals for help were heeded by nobody, and his story of being a prince was received with scorn and ridicule. \n\nHe finally decided to appeal to Samuel Judah Katzenellenbogen, the rabbi of Padua. Katzenellenbogen received him with marked respect, treated him very kindly, and provided him with the means to return to Lithuania. When the time for departure came the prince asked the rabbi how he could repay him for his kindness. To allow Radziwill to repay the favour, Shmuel asked that he help find his son Saul, who years before had left to study in a yeshiva in Poland. Upon his return to Poland he inquired at all yeshivas until he found Saul in Brest-Litovsk. Radziwill was impressed with Saul's intellect and offered to board him in his own castle, where Saul could pursue his studies. Radziwill's court personnel were similarly impressed with Saul, and his reputation spread throughout Poland.\n\nWhen King Stephen Báthory died in 1586, the Poles were divided between wishing to be ruled by the Zamoyski family and the Zborowski. Polish law at that time stated that the throne might not remain unoccupied for any length of time, and that in case electors could not agree upon a king, an outsider should be appointed \"rex pro tempore\" (temporary king). Radziwill proposed that Saul Wahl Katzenellenbogen be appointed temporary king, and Wahl was elected to the office. Traditions disagree as to the length of his reign. Some state that he ruled one night only; others make it a few days.\n\nHistorian Gustav Karpeles writes that \"an historical kernel lies hidden in the legend\" that, he says, \"rests upon an historical substratum\". Nicholas Radziwill, he says, made a widely publicized pilgrimage to Jerusalem. While returning, wrote Radziwill, he was attacked in Italy by robbers and was left in Ancona without any money. His pleas for help were ignored by all except a Jewish merchant, who alone believed his claim that he was a Polish noble. The merchant provided him with funds to return to Poland. Karpeles concludes that Radziwill's narrative is consistent with the narrative of the Jewish tale and that the lone Jewish merchant who had helped Radziwill was Samuel Judah Katzenellenbogen, Saul Wahl's father.\n"}
{"id": "2328999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2328999", "title": "Small Heath", "text": "Small Heath\n\nSmall Heath is an area in South-East Birmingham, West Midlands, England. It is situated on and around the A45 (Coventry Road).\n\nSmall Heath, which has been settled and used since Roman times, sits on top of a small hill. The slightly elevated site offers poor agricultural land, lying on a glacial drift of sand, gravel, and clay, resulting in a heathland that provides adequate grazing for livestock.\n\nThe land therefore seems to have developed as a pasture or common land, on which locals could graze their animals. However, the site lies directly on the route between Birmingham and Coventry, and so was probably used by drovers transporting animals to and from the two cities, and the livestock markets within each.\n\nThe Coventry Road itself was first recorded in 1226, leading from the Digbeth crossing of the River Rea. At this time Birmingham was a medieval market town whilst Coventry was a major city of national importance. In 1745, the Coventry Turnpike was created with tollgates at Watery Lane Middleway, Green Lane, and the River Cole. At Holder Road a milestone showed to London.\n\nThe first recording of Small Heath was noted in 1461, which term applied to a narrow heath between Green Lane and the Coventry Road, where the baths and library were built later. The 1799 opening of the Warwick and Birmingham Canal (now the Grand Union Canal), from Digbeth to Warwick, defined the southern edge of this scattered rural community. In 1852, this definition was enforced with the opening of the Isambard Kingdom Brunel designed Birmingham and Oxford Junction Railway, which follows the same route.\n\nAs Birmingham developed, the wealthy began to look for space outside the crowded inner city. Small Heath, a green site close to and within a fast developing city, began to be developed from 1834 when large houses first appeared east of the Small Heath between Green Lane and Grange Road. The next developments were mainly terraced housing estates laid out for the working classes as far as Charles Road.\n\nThe development of properties in the area was made much easier and cheaper through the extraction of the local clay, which was then locally turned into bricks. The largest local clay pit was located on Cattell Road.\n\nMembers of Holy Trinity Cricket Club, Bordesley had formed the Small Heath Alliance Football Club in 1875 as a way of keeping fit over the winter. After playing in Bordesley Green and Sparkbrook, in 1877 they moved to what became called the Muntz Street stadium, which rented for an initial £5 a year from the family of Sam Gessey, a Small Heath player. The field had a capacity of 10,000 spectators, and was bordered on two sides by developed streets, Muntz Street on the western side, Wright Street to the south; the other two sides of the enclosure adjoined farmland.\n\nAlso serving as the headquarters of the Small Heath Athletic Club, the initial capacity was raised by the addition of a wooden stand and the terracing raised to expand the capacity to around 30,000. In 1895, the football club bought the lease to the ground, which had 11 years remaining, for a sum of £275.\n\nSmall Heath Athletic Club (later called Small Heath Harriers) established its headquarters at the Muntz Street ground from the club's foundation in 1891. Though primarily a cross-country and road-racing club, they also participated in track and field athletics, and during the summer months the athletes were allowed to train on the football pitch. After Birmingham received its city charter in 1889, the club was renamed Birmingham City Football Club.\n\nEventually the ground proved too small for the football club's needs, and rising rents forced the development of a new stadium. The club built a new stadium nearer the city centre, St Andrew's. The last game at Muntz Street was played on 22 December 1906, when Birmingham beat Bury 3–1 in the First Division in front of some 10,000 spectators. St. Andrews hosted its first game in December 1906. Within months the Muntz Street had been demolished, the land cleared and housing built in what became Swanage Road; no plaque commemorates the site, but the street of the same name remains.\n\nBy the outbreak of World War II, BSA Guns Ltd at Small Heath was the only factory producing rifles in the UK. The Royal Ordnance Factories would not begin production until 1941. BSA Guns Ltd was also producing .303 Browning machine guns for the Air Ministry at the rate of 600 guns per week in March 1939 and Browning production was to peak at 16,390 per month by March 1942. The armed forces had chosen the 500 cc side-valve BSA M20 motorcycle as their preferred machine. On the outbreak of war the Government requisitioned the 690 machines BSA had in stock as well as placing an order for another 8,000 machines. South Africa, Ireland, India, Sweden, and the Netherlands also wanted machines.\n\nThe Government passed the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act 1939 on 24 August allowing the drafting of defence regulations affecting food, travel, requisitioning of land and supplies, manpower and agricultural production. A second Emergency Powers (Defence) Act was passed on 22 May 1940 allowing the conscription of labour. The fall of France had not been anticipated in Government planning and the encirclement of a large part of the British Expeditionary Force into the Dunkirk pocket resulted in a hasty evacuation of that part of the B.E.F following the abandonment of their equipment. The parlous state of affairs \"no arms, no transport, no equipment\" in the face of the threat of imminent invasion of Britain by Nazi forces was recorded by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff Field Marshal Sir Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke in his diary entries of the 1/2 July 1940.\n\nThe creation of the Home Guard (initially as the Local Defence Volunteers) following Anthony Eden's broadcast appeal to the Nation on Tuesday 14 May 1940 also created further demand for arms production to equip this new force. BSA, as the only rifle producer in Britain, had to step up to the mark and the workforce voluntarily went onto a seven-day week. Motorcycle production was also stepped up from 500 to 1,000 machines per week which meant a finished machine coming off the production line every 5 minutes. The motorcycle department workforce had been left intact in 1939 due to demand which was doubled following Dunkirk. At the same time BSA staff were providing lectures and demonstrations on motorcycle riding and maintenance to 250,000 officers and men in all parts of the UK.\n\nThe BSA factory at Small Heath was bombed by the Luftwaffe on 26 August 1940 resulting in one H.E.bomb and a shower of incendiaries hitting the main barrel mill, the only one operating on service rifles in the country, thereby causing the unaffordable loss of 750 machine tools but no loss of life. Two further air raids took place on 19 and 22 November 1940. The air raid of 19 November did the most damage, causing loss of production and trapping hundreds of workers. Two BSA night-shift electricians, Alf Stevens and Alf Goodwin, helped rescue their fellow workers. Alf Stevens was awarded the George Medal for his selfless acts of bravery in the rescue and Alf Goodwin was awarded the British Empire Medal. Workers involved in the works Civil Defence were brought in to help search for and clear bodies to get the plant back into production. The net effect of the November raids was to destroy machine shops in the four-storey 1915 building, the original 1863 gunsmiths' building and nearby buildings, 1,600 machine tools, kill 53 employees and another 50+ local residents, injured 89 (30 of them seriously), and halted rifle production for three months. The Government Ministry of Supply and BSA immediately began a process of production dispersal throughout Britain, through the shadow factory scheme.\n\nThere are two large supermarkets, Asda and Morrisons and the outdoor pursuits centre Ackers Trust. There is also a business park that is home to the former Birmingham Cable Company (now Virgin Media), the international CADCAM company Delcam and kitchen appliance repair specialists Repaircare. In recent years, the Coventry Road has attracted a growing increasing number of ethnic fast food restaurants.\n\nUntil 1973, Small Heath was the home of the massive Birmingham Small Arms factory on Golden Hillock Road and Armoury Road, manufacturing amongst other things, bicycles, motorcycles, guns and cars including taxi cabs, dominating the local and national economy. The factory was briefly acquired by Norton Villiers Triumph following their takeover of BSA but closed down, much of it being demolished following the collapse of the British motorcycle industry. A business park now occupies the site whilst the remaining buildings are still used for manufacturing.\n\nOn Coventry Road, many Bangladeshi restaurants have opened, serving traditional Bangladeshi dishes as well as Indian cuisine.\n\nMany mostly terraced houses were built around Small Heath towards the end of the 19th century, and over the next few decades these buildings became the residence of numerous Irish immigrants. In the 20 or so years that followed the end of World War II, the area attracted more immigrants – mostly from the Indian sub-continent. Immigrants from the West Indies also settled in Small Heath, but Pakistani immigrants, including a large majority from Azad Kashmir, were by far the most significant people to settle in the area. House prices have been steadily increasing on a par with other areas within Birmingham.\n\nThe total population of the area is approximately 36,898, based on 2007 estimates. The majority of residents are of South Asian origin, mainly of Pakistani (51%). While people of White British ethnicity form 22% of the population. There are also many East African residents from Somalia and Eritrea who live in Small Heath The majority of residents are also Muslim; and there are many mosques in the area, the largest in Small Heath being the Ghamkol Shariff Masjid which is also one of the largest in the UK.\n\nThere are several parks and green spaces in the suburb, of which the largest (Small Heath Park – formerly known as Victoria Park) occasionally hosts festivals. An episode of \"Charlie's Garden Army\" featured a permanent installation in Small Heath Park. Small Heath is home to Birmingham City Football Club's St. Andrews stadium.\n\nSmall Heath is centred around the Coventry Road that formed part of the main route from Birmingham to Coventry, but the section of Coventry Road that passes through Small Heath was bypassed by a dual carriageway that opened in January 1985.\n\nIt is served by Small Heath railway station on the North Warwickshire Line. The Grand Union Canal also passes through the area. Local transport connections are very good, with a mainline railway station and many bus routes to other parts of the city.\n\nIn the early years, horse-drawn buses ran along the Coventry Road, linking Small Heath with the city centre and with other nearby districts. In 1882, the building of a tramline along the Coventry Road to Small Heath Park was authorised, and four years later, the Coventry Road steam tramway route was opened to a terminus near Dora Road. In the early years of the 20th century, this line was converted for use by electric trams.\n\nSmall Heath is part of the Birmingham Hodge Hill constituency, which is held by Labour MP Liam Byrne. The constituency has a high proportion of people of South Asian origin, and this section of the community has historically supported the Labour Party.\n\nPart of Small Heath now falls in the constituency of Birmingham Ladywood, represented by Labour MP Shabana Mahmood.\n\nIn the BBC1 series \"Peaky Blinders\", Small Heath is the home base of the Shelbys and core members of their gang, the Peaky Blinders.\n\nThe BBC Three series \"Man Like Mobeen\" is set in Small Heath.\n\n"}

Currently it connects the two biggest Czech cities, Prague and Brno, in the future it will link Ostrava and to the Czech–Polish border in Věřňovice (Karviná District) / Gorzyczki (Wodzisław County). It is long, but the planned length is . It is the busiest motorway in the Czech Republic, with maximum AADT 99,000 vehicles per day near Prague.\n\nThe Munich Agreement in 1938 deprived the country of some fundamental road and rail routes. The government hurried works for the preparation of three major infrastructure projects to the new borders, the Německý Brod – Brno railway, the Plzeň – Ostrava road and a 4-lane highway from Prague to Velký Bočkov (on the Czechoslovak – Romanian border). On 23 December 1938 the government issued Decree no. 372/1938 Coll. about construction of motorways an establishment of General Motorway Directorate. Decree presumed construction of east-west motorway in four years.\n\nAs of January 1939, General Motorway Directorate has 108 employees. On 13 January 1939 the project for Prague – Jihlava – Brno – Slovak border was approved as well as start of construction on segments Chodov (now part of Prague) – Humpolec and Zástřizly – Lužná. As result Carpathian Ruthenia prime minister Avgustyn Voloshyn requested Slovak border – Chust segment to be added as well. Construction began on 24 January in Zástřizly in Chřiby mountains on the Zástřizly – Lužná segment. \n\nThe German occupation of Czechoslovakia brought only small technical changes to the project and the construction of another segment Chodov – Humpolec began in May 1939. The increasing demands of World War II slowed down the construction and the works were completely halted in 1942. After the war the works were resumed mainly on major bridges in 1946, but only with a small workforce. \n\nAfter 1948 the works continued. But in January 1949 the segment in Chřiby was abandoned in 1949 and the segment Prague – Humpolec one year later. All 77 km of motorway under construction including 60 bridges remain in disuse.\n\nIn the 1960s, traffic was growing very quickly, and a new plan for a D1 highway Prague – Soviet Union border was formulated. Work on the Prague – Brno section started in 1967, mainly using the old route from first attempt. The 21 km long Prague – Mirošovice segment was completed in 1971, and the 205 km long route to Brno in 1980. \n\nIn the Slovakian part construction started in 1973 with the 14 km long Ivachnová – Liptovský Mikuláš section, together with the construction of the Liptovská Mara dam. The 19 km Prešov – Košice highway was added in 1980. In the late 1980s and the early 1990s the 19 km long Brno – Vyškov segment was built and another 20 km from Liptovský Mikuláš to Hybe in Slovakia.\n\nAlexander Dubček who died in Car crashed in the highway. \n\nAfter the dissolution of Czechoslovakia route changes, construction was no longer planned to Slovakia, but instead to Lipník nad Bečvou (the replacement of the planned route is the R49 expressway). Due to growing traffic near Prague, the first segment to Mirošovice was widened from 4 lanes to 6 lanes and there are similar plans for widening around Brno as well. After the dissolution, no new sections were built. In 2002, construction of an 18 km long extension from Vyškov eastwards started and it was opened in 2005. More extensions eastwards were opened in 2008, 2009 and 2010; in 2011, the motorway reached the junction with R55 expressway and R49 expressway near Hulín, the route curled up to the north to Přerov (and Lipník nad Bečvou).\n\nSimultaneously the segment from Lipník nad Bečvou to Ostrava was constructed during 2004 – 2009 due to historical reasons as Motorway D47, however it was opened as part of D1 highway. The segment from Ostrava to the Polish border (and Autostrada A1) has been opened in late 2012, but only for cars under 3.5 tonnes, because the Polish side had problems with the bridge at Mszana village. From 2014 the bridge is open, and everyone can ride from Ostrava to Polish Border, and further, to Katowice. Přerov – Lipník nad Bečvou segment has been opened in December 2019.\n\nThe only section which is not yet completed is Říkovice – Přerov segment. Construction is yet to be started (planned in November 2021), with expected completion date in 2024.\n\n\n\n"}

(Società Piemontese Automobili). Giovanni's son Giovanni \"Ernesto\" was also influential, co-founding Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili (aka Giovanni Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili) and Fabrica Anonima Torinese Automobili (FATA).\n\nIn 1888, after eight years apprenticeship at his father's watch-making business, Giovanni Battista started building \"Welleyes\" bicycles, so named because English names had more sales appeal. In October 1898 Giovanni Battista and Matteo co-founded Ceirano GB & C and started producing the \"Welleyes\" motor car in 1899. In July 1899 the plant and patents were sold to Giovanni Agnelli and produced as the first F.I.A.T.s - the Fiat 4 HP. Giovanni Battista was employed by Fiat as the agent for Italy, but within a year he left to found Fratelli Ceirano & C., which in 1903 became Società Torinese Automobili Rapid (S.T.A.R.) building cars badged as 'Rapid'. In 1904 Matteo Ceirano left Ceirano GB & C to create his own brand – Itala. In 1906 Matteo left Itala to found S.P.A. (Società Piemontese Automobili) with chief designer, Alberto Ballacco. In 1906 Giovanni founded SCAT (Società Ceirano Automobili Torino) in Turin. In 1919 Giovanni and Giovanni \"Ernesto\" co-founded Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili (aka Giovanni Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili) and in 1922 they took control of Fabrica Anonima Torinese Automobili (FATA).\n\nThree cars were offered in the first year, an 18 hp, a 24 hp and a 50 hp. In 1905 they started making very large-engined racing cars with a 14.8-litre 5-cylinder model which won the Coppa Florio and the year after that the Targa Florio. In 1907 a 35/45 hp model driven by Count Scipione Borghese won the Peking to Paris motor race by three weeks. These sporting successes helped sales dramatically; the company continued to grow. The company experimented with a range of novel engines such as variable-stroke, sleeve-valve, and \"Avalve\" rotary types and at the beginning of World War I, offered a wide range of cars. During the war Itala built aeroplane engines but made a loss producing them.\n\nAfter the armistice car production resumed with models based on the pre war cars such as the Tipo 50 25/35 hp and a re-appearance of the Avalve in the Tipo 55 but financial success eluded the company\n\nFrom 1924 the company was being run under receivership, and they appointed Giulio Cesare Cappa from Fiat as general manager. He produced a new car, the Tipo 61 with 7-cylinder alloy engine, which was well received, but he then decided to return to motor sport producing in 1925 the Itala mod.11, a very advanced single seat racing car with a 1050 cc supercharged V12 engine that developed 60 CV at 7,000rpm. It had front-wheel drive and all-round independent suspension, with a top speed of around , but the car never raced. Two Tipo 61s did take part in the 1928 Le Mans 24 hour race, winning the 2-litre class.\n\nThe company was bought by truck maker Officine Metallurgiche di Tortona in 1929, and a few more cars were made up to 1935. The remains of the company was sold to Fiat.\n\nA distinctive feature of the pre-World War I 50 hp and 90 hp models was their use of a rotary valve. Each valve fed a pair of cylinders and was mounted alongside, rotating parallel to them. Four ports cast into the valve alternately connected ports to the cylinders through the side of the valve to the inlet and exhaust manifolds at bottom and top of the valves.\nLeo Villa began his career as a racing mechanic working on these rotary valve engines for the driver Giulio Foresti. He met Malcolm Campbell, when in 1923, Campbell took over the Itala and Ballot concessions in London. Seeing the publicity potential of racing them at Brooklands, Campbell also bought two of Foresti's race-prepared cars. Foresti and Villa delivered them in person from Paris to Campbell's house at Povey Cross. Impressed by Campbell's wealth and ambitions, Villa accepted an offer to become his permanent mechanic.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2329024", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2329024", "title": "Polygonum arenastrum", "text": "Polygonum arenastrum\n\nPolygonum arenastrum, commonly known as equal-leaved knotgrass, is a summer annual flowering plant in the knotweed family Polygonaceae. It is native to Europe and can be found on other continents as an introduced species and a common noxious weed. Other common names include common knotweed, prostrate knotweed, mat grass, oval-leaf knotweed, stone grass, wiregrass, and door weed, as well as many others, knotweed was first seen in North America in 1809 and is now seen across much of the United States and Canada.\n\nKnotweed develops a deep tap root (it can be as deep as ), does well in compacted soil, and survives drought conditions. The numerous wiry stems grow out from the center of the plant giving it a mat-like appearance. The stems are very long and branching and grow in a zigzag form. The leaves are alternate, oblong, hairless, can be to inches (12 to 37 mm) long, and are bluish-green in color. The leaf stalk is short and closely surrounded by papery stipules on each node. The stem nodes are slightly swollen and look somewhat like \"knots\", thus its common name, knotweed. Flowers, with colors ranging from white to green, are inconspicuous, have no petals, and grow all along the stems. The sepals, however, are pinkish with white edges. Seeds are egg-shaped, dark reddish brown in color, and have a smooth shiny surface.\n\nSome people mistake knotweed for spotted spurge. An easy way to tell the difference is to break off a stem. Spurges contain milky sap; knotweed does not.\n\nSince common knotweed does well in compacted soils, it is most commonly found in driveways, along roadsides and vacant lots, and in walkways, as well as in turf grass (where there is a lot of footpath wear) and in gardens.\n\nCommon knotweed germinates at or near the soil surface in early spring, as soon there is enough moisture, and grows in an upright position before it spreads out like a mat. If mowed, it will still spread and can form a mat as wide as in diameter. The seeds, which grow low to the ground, survive mowing and are not disturbed when stepped on by people and animals.\n\nKnotweed is a weed of waste areas but has been showing up in grain fields, where is becomes problematic because of its prolific seed production and long viability. It is also a host for powdery mildew like \"Erysiphe betae\" and viruses such as beet ringspot and beet curly top virus.\n\nSome sources treat \"Polygonum arenastrum\" as a subspecies or variety of \"Polygonum aviculare\", while others differentiate.\n\nIn the home garden, common knotweed is easy to get rid of by hand pulling. Covering garden beds with landscaping fabric and then mulch is a good way to keep knotweed from taking over. If the seeds do germinate in the mulch cover, they are easy to remove. Herbicides are also an option. Pre-emergent herbicides, those that prevent the seed from germinating, are effective, but the area must first be free of weeds for this type of herbicide to work. Post emergent herbicides, those that kill the growing plant by spraying the green leaves of the plant, may be effective if applied when the plant is very young.\n\nTo prevent this weed, the soil should be aerated and well-drained. Young weeds should be pulled before they set seed.\n\n"}

By 2016, 9.2% of the students were non-Hispanic white, and Nicholson concluded that \"change happened rapidly.\"\n\nIn 1997, 49.2% of the students were low income - Nicholson stated that an increase in poor students was already occurring by then-but this increased to 79.6% in 2016.\n\nAll Irving ISD elementary and middle school students are required to wear school uniforms, a dress code that has been enforced since the 1999-2000 school year. The uniforms consists of a polo shirt and appropriate school pants (navy blue pants, khakis, etc.). The acceptable shirt colors are light blue, white, forest green, navy blue and attending campus school colors. High schools do not have school uniforms but still enforce district dress code. High school students are trusted to wear appropriate attire.\n\nThe Texas Education Agency (TEA) specifies that the parents and/or guardians of students zoned to a school with uniforms may apply for a waiver to opt out of the uniform policy so their children do not have to wear the uniform; parents must specify \"bona fide\" reasons, such as religious reasons or philosophical objections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Lescure was in command of a company of cavalry in the \"Regiment de Royal-Picmont\". In 1791, he married his cousin Victoire de Donnissan de La Rochejaquelein, who was also the cousin of Henri de La Rochejacquelein, another hero of Vendée. Being opposed to the ideas of the Revolution, he emigrated in 1791, but soon returned, and, on the \"Journée du 10 août\", 1792 took part in the defence of the Tuileries Palace against the mob of Paris. The day after, he was forced to leave the capital, and took refuge in the \"château\" of Clisson near Bressuire.\n\nOn the outbreak of the Revolt in the Vendée against the Republic, he was arrested and imprisoned with all his family, as one of the promoters of the rising. He was set free by the Royalists and became one of their leaders. Lescure fought at Thouars in May 1793. At the Battle of Fontenay-le-Comte, he was the first to enter the city and free the Vendéan prisoners inside. He was wounded at the Battle of Saumur in June. After an unsuccessful attack on Nantes, he joined forces with La Rochejaquelein and tried in vain to rally the troops of the dispersed Catholic and Royal Army.\n\nTheir peasant troops, opposed to the French Revolutionary Army General François Joseph Westermann, sustained various defeats, but finally gained a victory between Tiffauges and Cholet on 19 September 1793. He was seriously wounded by a bullet to the head at Tiffauges. The struggle was then concentrated around Châtillon, which was time after time taken and lost by the Republicans. Lescure was killed near the \"château\" of La Tremblaye between Ernée and Fougères.\n"}

It was released in October 1966 by Colgems Records in the United States and RCA Victor in the rest of the world. It was the first of four consecutive U.S. number one albums for the group, taking the top spot on the \"Billboard\" 200 for 13 weeks, after which it was displaced by the band's second album. It also topped the UK charts in 1967. \"The Monkees\" has been certified quintuple platinum by the RIAA, with sales of over five million copies.\n\nThe song \"Last Train to Clarksville\" was released as a single shortly before the release of the album and went to the top of the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart. It was the only hit single from the album. \"I'll Be True to You\" was previously released as a single by the Hollies in January 1965 under the title \"Yes I Will\".\n\nThe album was recorded in several separate sessions around Los Angeles from July 5–25, 1966. Early sessions were produced by the trio of Tommy Boyce, Bobby Hart and Jack Keller; later sessions were produced by Boyce and Hart. Michael Nesmith produced two sessions scheduled around the work done by Boyce, Hart, and Keller.\n\nFamously, the Monkees were not permitted by their management to function as a working band for this album. Although the album cover credits the band as playing instruments (drums for Dolenz; guitar for the other three members), the group's actual contributions were limited almost entirely to vocal tracks. Eight of the original LP's twelve tracks feature one lone Monkee singing lead vocal over instrumentation and backing vocals recorded entirely by a group of session musicians which varies from song to song. Other tracks feature multiple Monkees singing over session players; only on the two tracks produced by Michael Nesmith does a Monkee (Peter Tork) get to play an instrument (guitar). (Nesmith wrote or co-wrote these two tracks.) No tracks on the original LP feature participation from all four Monkees.\n\nThe photos in the \"film strip\" on the left side of the back cover are from two episodes of \"The Monkees\" TV series.

Also included are brief stats on each band member (height, weight, age).\n\nEarly pressings of the LP cover as well as side 1 of the label featured the misspelled song \"Papa Jean's Blues\" (Catalog number COM/COS 101). This was soon corrected as \"Papa Gene's Blues\" (Catalog number COM/COS 101 RE). It was standard practice for RCA to add an \"RE\" when any one side of a record sleeve had a revision. Open copies of both versions are easy to find. In addition when the album was reissued in 1969 the Colgems symbol replaced the word \"Colgems\" on the bottom right-hand corner of the reverse side (Catalog number COS 101 RE2).

His parents had emigrated from London and Yorkshire.\n\nMayne grew up in a waterfront workers' cottage in the High Street, Millers Point on the waterfront right by Sydney Harbour. Sydney Harbour Bridge was built while he was a young child. This area used to be called The Hungry Mile (now Barangaroo) because workers would walk from wharf to wharf looking for a job during the depression. It was one of the earliest areas of European settlement in Sydney and is now a heritage area. Since 2014 Sydney council has been selling off these heritage workers' cottages as they are considered prime real estate. Mayne's father Herbert Mainprize was a waterfront worker and had been a deep-sea diver and torpedo gunner (and welterweight boxing champion) for the British navy. He met Mayne's mother Catherine Jones at a Church Temperance Society meeting in Sydney in 1911, after which he bought his way out of the navy. Catherine's family had a boarding house and a milk run in Millers Point and she was in domestic service. Mayne's other siblings were Margaret, who also went into domestic service, Cathy who was a telephonist, Stanley who was a waterfront worker like their father, and Gladys, who worked in the RAF canteen during World War II.\n\nThe family was forced to move inland to Katoomba, New South Wales, in the Blue Mountains in 1937 because Catherine's asthma was so severe. They set up a boardinghouse in Lurline Road. \n\nWhen Mayne was 19, he began training to become an electrician. During his three-year apprenticeship in Sydney he started taking acting classes including dance classes, and performing in productions at Sydney Town Hall. Catherine Mainprize was very proud of her youngest child, and travelled from Katoomba to see him perform at Sydney Town Hall, but his dad Herbert considered ballet unmanly and didn't talk about Mayne's achievements. \n\nOver the next two years he became fascinated by the theatre and the idea of becoming a dancer, and by the end of 1949 he had worked for the National Theatre Ballet in one of their productions. In early 1950 he signed up with JC Williamson, the foremost theatrical agency in Australia, and changed his surname to Mayne. In mid-1951 he signed a contract with the National Theatre Movement to perform at Tivoli Theatres and that year, age 23, he toured with the Borovansky Ballet—who would later become the Australian National Ballet—in New Zealand in the corps de ballet and in Australian cities, performing at the Theatre Royal in Sydney in December. \"Swan Lake\", \"Petroushka\", \"Giselle\", among other ballets. \n\nIn 1952 he continued as a ballet dancer in the corps de ballet with the Boravansky Ballet to Perth, Brisbane, Adelaide, Melbourne, Western Australia and New Zealand, with the last 'break-up' party in Dunedin, New Zealand, in December.\n\nEarly in 1953 he took the three-month journey by boat, on the \"Orion\", all the way to the UK with a group of friends who were also dancers, and settled in West London.\n\nMayne immediately auditioned for the original London show \"Guys and Dolls\", which opened in 1953 featuring two of the same Broadway stars, and became one of their principal dancers. That year there was a royal command performance and he wrote to his mother Catherine Mainprize: 'I've just had one of the most thrilling nights I've ever experienced in the theatre so I thought I'd sit down and tell you all about it. The royal family were in the show tonight and really your hardened old son was thrilled to the back teeth...The whole trip to England has been worth it if just for tonight.' \n\nMayne was a prolific letter writer and wrote regularly to the Mainprize family back home addressing his letters to 'the whole famdamily'.\n\nMayne met dancer Frances Pidgeon, who everyone called Pidge, in mid-1954, on the set of Cole Porter's musical \"Can Can\", which was also at the Coliseum. Australian dancer Harry Haythorne said of Mayne: 'Also at the auditions were two \"Aussie blokes\"... who stood out as being very upfront, good-humoured... certainly not shy... with no pretentions. They were, of course, Lennie Mayne and his best friend, Australian Jack Hall, both of whom would marry dancers from the show.' Lennie and Pidge married in 1956. \n\nMayne performed as a dancer in the 1955 movie \"Gentlemen Marry Brunettes\" (the follow-up to \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\"), with Jane Russell, and became choreographer for the notorious Astor night club in Piccadilly.\n\nIn 1961 he returned to Sydney for the first time since 1952 with his wife Pidge and had a very joyful reunion with his family. In Sydney he worked as a floor manager for the TV channel ATN Channel 7 on the music show \"Review 61\", while Pidge worked as a dancer in a Sydney night club. They rented a waterfront apartment in Hunters Hill on Lane Cove River, near the harbour. By this time his father Herbert's dementia was well established so he couldn't appreciate his son's success and died six months after he returned. \n\nLennie and Pidge returned to the UK after nearly a year and Lennie became choreographer on a television special called \"The Bing Crosby Show\" in December 1961, among other freelance jobs, including as a dancer in the British film \"Play It Cool\", starring Billy Fury. In 1962 Mayne got on the BBC producers' trainee course but didn't complete it and he returned to freelancing as a choreographer and production assistant. He worked his way up the career ladder and was finally offered a job on staff at the BBC in 1966. By 1968 he was directing \"The Borderers\". \n\nHe is most closely associated with the science fiction series \"Doctor Who\", having directed four serials for the programme: \"The Curse of Peladon\" (1972), \"The Three Doctors\" (1972), \"The Monster of Peladon\" (1974) and \"The Hand of Fear\" (1976). He also directed episodes for numerous BBC series/serials on the 1960s and 1970s, including \"The First Lady\", \"The Troubleshooters\", \"Doomwatch\", \"Warship\", \"The Brothers\", \"\" and \"The Onedin Line\".\n\nMayne drowned following a sailing accident in the English Channel in May 1977 when the sailing boat he was on was hit by a trawler at night. His body was never found. There was a packed memorial service at All Soul's in Langham Place in Regent's Street in London to commemorate Mayne, his achievements and his contribution to the BBC. \n\nMayne has two daughters and four grandchildren.\n"}

Nodal analysis writes an equation at each electrical node, requiring that the branch currents incident at a node must sum to zero. The branch currents are written in terms of the circuit node voltages. As a consequence, each branch constitutive relation must give current as a function of voltage; an admittance representation. For instance, for a resistor, I = V * G, where G (=1/R) is the admittance (conductance) of the resistor.\n\nNodal analysis is possible when all the circuit elements' branch constitutive relations have an admittance representation. Nodal analysis produces a compact set of equations for the network, which can be solved by hand if small, or can be quickly solved using linear algebra by computer. Because of the compact system of equations, many circuit simulation programs (e.g. SPICE) use nodal analysis as a basis. When elements do not have admittance representations, a more general extension of nodal analysis, modified nodal analysis, can be used.\n\n\nThe only unknown voltage in this circuit is V. There are three connections to this node and consequently three currents to consider. The direction of the currents in calculations is chosen to be away from the node.\nWith Kirchhoff's current law, we get:\n\nformula_1\n\nThis equation can be solved with respect to V:\n\nformula_2\n\nFinally, the unknown voltage can be solved by substituting numerical values for the symbols. Any unknown currents are easy to calculate after all the voltages in the circuit are known.\n\nformula_3\n\n In this circuit, we initially have two unknown voltages, V and V. The voltage at V is already known to be V because the other terminal of the voltage source is at ground potential.\n\nThe current going through voltage source V cannot be directly calculated. Therefore, we cannot write the current equations for either V or V. However, we know that the same current leaving node V must enter node V. Even though the nodes cannot be individually solved, we know that the combined current of these two nodes is zero. This combining of the two nodes is called the supernode technique, and it requires one additional equation: V = V + V.\n\nThe complete set of equations for this circuit is:\n\nformula_4\n\nBy substituting V to the first equation and solving in respect to V, we get:\n\nformula_5\n\nIn general, for a circuit with formula_6 nodes, the node-voltage equations obtained by nodal analysis can be written in a matrix form as derived in the following.\nFor any node formula_7, KCL states formula_8 where formula_9 is the negative of the sum of the conductances between nodes formula_7 and formula_11, and formula_12 is the voltage of node formula_7.\nThis implies formula_14 where formula_15 is the sum of conductances connected to node formula_7. \nWe note that the first term contributes linearly to the node formula_7 via formula_15, while the second term contributes linearly to each node formula_11 connected to the node formula_7 via formula_21 with a minus sign.\nIf an independent current source/input formula_22 is also attached to node formula_7, the above expression is generalized to formula_24.\nIt is readily to show that one can combine the above node-voltage equations for all formula_6 nodes, and write them down in the following matrix form\nor simply\nThe matrix formula_28 on the left hand side of the equation is singular since it satisfies formula_29 where formula_30 is a formula_31 column matrix. This corresponds to the fact of current conservation, namely, formula_32, and the freedom to choose a reference node (ground). In practice, the voltage is the reference node is taken to be 0. Consider it is the last node, formula_33. In this case, it is straightforward to verify that the resulting equations for the other formula_34 nodes remain the same, and therefore one can simply discard the last column as well as the last line of the matrix equation. This procedure results in a formula_35 dimensional non-singular matrix equation with the definitions of all the elements stay unchanged.\n\n\n\n"}

She is the senior of the existing Norwegian built square riggers, and for more than 50 years she held a central position in the education and training of young people. She is the second oldest of three Norwegian tall ships, the “Great Trio of Norway”, which besides her includes Statsraad Lehmkuhl and Christian Radich.\n\nConstruction on the Sørlandet was started in 1925 at Høivolds Mek shipyard in the city of Kristiansand on the south coast of Norway based on a £25,000 grant from ship owner O.A.T. Skjelbred. Completed in May 28, 1927, she measured 210 feet in length and 577 gross tons. She was given the name Sørlandet after the Norwegian region from where she originates.\n\nOn her maiden voyage to Oslo in 1927, Sørlandet was inspected by King Haakon and Crown Prince Olav. Later in the same year, she set sail for London with 90 young trainees on board\n\nThe original intention behind mr. SKjelbreds grant was the establishment of a training institution called Sørlandets Seilende Skoleskibs Institusjon for young sailors, and with it the construction of a fully rigged tall ship with a steel hull that could house 80 cadets and their officers. As part of “Sørlandet’s Seilend Skoleskibs Institution,” the Sørlandet played a vital role in the education of young seamen from the southern region of Norway. The young men who received their training onboard disembarques as seamen and went in to service in the Norwegian Merchant Marine or in the Royal Navy.\n\nShe sailed to Chicago to take part in the World Fair in 1933. Being the first Norwegian training ship to cross the Atlantic Ocean, she actually served as the Norwegian pavilion during the exhibition \"Century of Progress\".\n\nThe ship was in continuous service as a training vessel for the Norwegian Merchant Marine until 1939, when World War II started. The same year, she was chartered by the Royal Norwegian Navy and used as a depot ship in the naval port of Horten where the Germans seized her in April 1940. She was damaged during the war and served as an accommodation vessel for German submariners. At the end of the war she was in a degrading condition. She was restored and ready to sail in 1948.\n\nIn 1958 she was equipped with an engine, as one of the last European tall ships.\n\nIn 1974 she was no longer used as a public training vessel and was sold to ship owner Jan Staubo. She was registered in Arendal and laid up at anchor in Kilsund for three years. In 1977 she was again bought by Skjelbreds Rederi A/S and presented as a gift to the city of Kristiansand. She was in great need for repairs, and through governmental and municipal funds, plus extensive voluntary labour and personal donations, she was completely restored.\n\nAfter the repairs of the late 1970s, she was again back in service in July 1980. Some 300 trainees from 10 different nations took part in her international friendship cruises that year. Most of the foreign trainees came from the UK and USA. Both young women and men were that time on accepted.\n\nIn 1981 a foundation was established; \"Stiftelsen Fullriggeren Sørlandet\" has been the owner and operator of the vessel since. From 1980 to 1983 Sørlandet was the only operating Norwegian sail training ship, and the first open to men and women of all ages and nationalities.\n\nSince 1982 she has made several Atlantic crossings, visiting ports in the US and Canada and in the Caribbean. In all these years she has carried out a series of summer cruises in the North and Baltic Sea and visited ports on the European continent. She was also features in an American film shoot for Shearson American express.\nIn 1982, Sørlandet hosted the exhibition \"Women of the Coast\" whilst visiting some 60 seaside destinations along Norwegian shoreline, sailing as far north as Kirkenes. A total of 83,000 people visited Sørlandet during this tour. In 1986 she once again crossed the Atlantic to take part in the 100th Anniversary of the Statue of Liberty in New York City. From 1986 to 1988 about 500 cadets from the Royal Norwegian Navy got their first life-at-sea experience through six-week courses, sailing and training aboard Sørlandet.\n\nIn the latter half of the 1990s she was affiliated with the Royal Norwegian Navy, Norwegian Ship Owners' Association and the local public employment office with which she offered six-week courses in sailing and seamanship to bolster the recruitment of young seafarers.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2014, Sørlandet hosted the Canadian school West Island College International for its program, \"Class Afloat\"; it offered high school and university courses in addition to sail training on board. The foundation established its own high school, A+ World Academy, the following year.\n\nIn keeping with International Maritime Organization (IMO) rules of the 1969 convention that dictate the measurement of vessels of her class, Sørlandet is now 499 gross tons. She is well equipped with air-conditioning but is otherwise in her original condition. The main engine is of 560 HP. In 1980, Sørlandet went through a full restoration. She had extensive repairs in 1988 and again from 2003 to 2007. In the summer of 2012, Sørlandet spent four months in dry-dock at Tuzla, Istanbul, for a major restoration project which included the replacement of many of her riveted steel hull plates, support systems and a complete rebuild of the main ‘Banjer’ area, where students sleep and attend classes. \nShe currently holds class *1A1 E0 in Det Norske Veritas and a worldwide trading certificate for carrying trainees.\n\nIn 2015 the Foundation established its own boarding high school, A+ World Academy. The school is a university preparatory secondary school, and classes are taught onboard while the Ship sails to different locations around the world. The school has a capacity of 60-62 students in grades 11 and 12.\n\nIn the first two years of the school, they undertook a circumnavigation. The school year started in Kristiansand, Norway in August 2015 and sailed to Hong Kong via Portugal, Morocco, Canary Islands, Cape Verde, Tobago, Curaçao, Colombia, Panama, Galapagos, Easter Island, Tahiti, New Caledonia, Fiji, Indonesia and Singapore. The School year ended in June 2016. The second school year started in Hong Kong August 2016 and sailed to Kristiansand, Norway via Vietnam, Brunei, Indonesia, Christmas Island, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Mauritius, South Africa, Namibia, Saint Helena, Brazil, Dominica, Puerto Rico, USA, Azores, France and the Netherlands.\n\nIn the school year 2017/2018 the students are sailing from Kristiansand, Norway to Kristiansand, Norway via the Mediterranean and the Caribbean. \nThe foundation oversees the A+ World Academy from its offices in Kristiansand.\n\nStudents follow an academic program based on Advanced Placement courses and may study subjects such as mathematics, calculus, physics, chemistry, biology, English, Spanish, politics, economics and history.\n\nStudents at the school take an active part in the day-to-day operation of the Ship. They take day- and night watches that include cleaning, maintenance, sail manoeuvring, helming, lookout, galley and safety rounds.\n\nThe Sørlandet has participated in several Tall Ships’ Races, and her merit list is as follows:\n\n\n\n"}

He was of mixed race, with a Creek mother and a fur trader father of mostly Scots ancestry. As the Creek had a matrilineal system of descent and leadership, his status came from his mother's clan.\n\nHe grew up among the Upper Creek in present-day Alabama and, as an adult, became part of the \"Red Sticks\", a group that opposed assimilation and worked to revive traditional practices. During the Creek War (1813–1814), he led Red Sticks warriors and survived the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. To carry out punishment for the crime of an unauthorized land cession, in 1825 Menawa led about 150 lawmenders in an attack on chief William McIntosh, who had signed the Treaty of Indian Springs that year without the consent of the Creek National Council. They killed him, burned his mansion, and confiscated his property, including livestock and 100 slaves.\n\nHe was born at the village of Oakfuskee, located on the Tallapoosa River in present-day Alabama. The site is now covered by the lower part of Lake Martin, created by a dam.\n\nHis mother was a high-status Creek woman and his father a mostly Scots fur trader; such strategic alliances were common, as both cultures believed they benefited. As the Creek were matrilineal, Menawa was reared within the Creek tribe and gained his status from his mother's clan. Her eldest brother would have acted as his mentor, teaching him men's ways and introducing him to the men's societies.\n\nWhen Hothlepoya became the second chief of Oakfuskee, he was given the name \"Menawa\".\n\nDuring the early 1800s, he was one of the principal leaders of the \"Red Sticks\" or Upper Creeks, who worked to revive traditional practices and resisted assimilation to European-American ways. He emerged to lead warriors in the Creek War (1813–1814), which began as a civil war among the Creek people, where strong divisions had arisen with the Lower Creek, who comprised the majority of the population. During this period, the British were already at war against the United States during the War of 1812. They supported the Red Sticks' resistance to United States settlers' incursions into their territory.\n\nMenawa was second in command of the Red Sticks at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in 1814, when they were defeated by General Andrew Jackson commanding militias of Tennessee, Georgia and the Mississippi Territory, as well as allied Cherokee. Menawa was wounded seven times during the battle, but he escaped and survived his wounds.\n\nAfter the war, Menawa continued to oppose the European-American encroachment on Creek lands. Lower Creek chiefs had ceded town lands in 1790, 1802 and 1804. In 1825, Chief William McIntosh, a Lower Creek, was one of several chiefs who signed the Treaty of Indian Springs with the US, ceding most of the remaining Creek land east of the Mississippi River. The tribe had been under severe pressure from Georgia, but the Upper Creek, the majority, continued to oppose such cessions. The Creek National Council had passed a law declaring land cessions a capital crime, and declared the signers of the 1825 treaty to be traitors. It ordered their execution.\n\nOn April 30, 1825, Menawa led a party of 120-150 lawmenders from towns of the ceded land; they executed chief William McIntosh, and Etommee Tustunnuggee, who had alienated communal Creek land without the consent of the National Council. They burned down McIntosh's mansion at Indian Springs, and confiscated his 100 slaves, livestock and produce. Later that day they caught Samuel and Benjamin Hawkins, his sons-in-law and also signatories to the treaty. They hanged Samuel and shot Benjamin, but he escaped.\n\nIn 1826, Menawa was a member of the Creek National Council, led by Opothleyahola, that went to Washington D.C., to protest the Treaty of Indian Springs. The Creek leaders signed the Treaty of Washington (1826) with the US government, which nullified the Treaty of Indian Springs. In this new treaty, the Creek still ceded land to Georgia—in compensation, they received an immediate payment of $217,660 and a perpetual annuity of $20,000. The state of Georgia ignored the new treaty and worked to evict the Creek from their lands.\n\nMenawa is said to have been among the hundreds who died during the general removal of the Creek to Indian Territory in the 1830s. According to the memoirs of Lt Edward Deas, who lead the third detachment of 2,420 Creeks from Alabama to Oklahoma, Menawa is said to have been alive on December 21, 1836 in Little Rock, Arkansas. According to Deas, \"The land party eventually arrived near Little Rock but Tuscoona Harjo, Menawa, and four hundred of their people, refused to travel much farther beyond that that. Menawa was too intoxicated to travel while Harho 'evinced a stubborn obstinate disposition.' \" Menawa is not listed on the muster rolls after the group reached Fort Gibson in Indian Territory on January 23, 1837. Menawa, therefore, possibly died between those two places and his burial place was along the way and is unknown.\n\n"}

{"id": "2329154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2329154", "title": "Madness and Civilization", "text": "Madness and Civilization\n\nMadness and Civilization: A History of Insanity in the Age of Reason () is a 1961 book by the French philosopher Michel Foucault. The book was first translated into English - in an abridged edition - in 1964. A new English translation of the complete 1961 edition, titled History of Madness, was published in June 2006.\n\nFoucault's first major book, \"Madness and Civilization\" is an examination of the evolving meaning of madness in European culture, law, politics, philosophy and medicine from the Middle Ages to the end of the eighteenth century, and a critique of historical method and the idea of history. It marks a turning in Foucault's thought away from phenomenology toward structuralism: though he uses the language of phenomenology to describe an evolving experience of the mad as \"the other\", he attributes this evolution to the influence of specific powerful social structures.\n\nThe book developed out of Foucault's earlier writing on psychology, his own psychological difficulties, and his experiences working in a mental hospital, and was written mainly between 1955 and 1959 while working in cultural-diplomatic and educational posts in Sweden (as director of a French cultural centre attached to the University of Uppsala), Germany, and Poland.\n\nFoucault traces the evolution of the concept of madness through three phases: the Renaissance, the \"Classical Age\" (the later seventeenth and most of the eighteenth centuries) and the modern experience. He argues that in the Renaissance the mad were portrayed in art as possessing a kind of wisdom – a knowledge of the limits of our world – and portrayed in literature as revealing the distinction between what men are and what they pretend to be. Renaissance art and literature depicted the mad as engaged with the reasonable while representing the mysterious forces of cosmic tragedy but the Renaissance also marked the beginning of an \"objective\" description of reason and unreason (as though seen from above) compared with the more intimate medieval descriptions from within society.\n\nFoucault contends that at the dawn of the age of reason, in the mid-seventeenth century, the rational response to the mad, who until then had been consigned to society's margins, was to separate them completely from society by confining them, along with prostitutes, vagrants, blasphemers and the like, in newly created institutions like the General Hospital of Paris all over Europe – a process he calls \"the Great Confinement\".\n\nThe condition of these outcasts was seen as one of moral error. They were viewed as having freely chosen prostitution, vagrancy, blasphemy, unreason, etc. and the regimes of these new rational institutions were meticulous programs of punishment and reward aimed at causing them to reverse those choices.\n\nThe social forces Foucault sees driving this confinement include the need for an extra-judicial mechanism for getting rid of undesirables, and the wish to regulate unemployment and wages (the cheap labour of the workhouses applied downward pressure on the wages of free labour). He argues that the conceptual distinction between the mad and the rational was in a sense a product of this physical separation into confinement: confinement made the mad conveniently available to medical doctors who began to view madness as a natural object worthy of study and then as an illness to be cured.\n\nFor Foucault the modern experience began at the end of the eighteenth century with the creation of places devoted solely to the confinement of the mad under the supervision of medical doctors, and these new institutions were the product of a blending of two motives: the new goal of \"curing\" the mad away from their family who could not afford the necessary care at home, and the old purpose of \"confining\" undesirables for the protection of society. These distinct purposes were lost sight of, and the institution soon came to be seen as the only place where therapeutic treatment can be administered. He sees the nominally more enlightened and compassionate treatment of the mad in these modern medical institutions as just as cruel and controlling as their treatment in the earlier, rational institutions had been.\n\nThe sociologist José Guilherme Merquior argues that while Foucault raises important questions about the influence of social forces on the meaning of, and responses to, deviant behavior, \"Madness and Civilization\" is nonetheless so riddled with serious errors of fact and interpretation as to be of very limited value. Merquior notes that there is abundant evidence of widespread cruelty to and imprisonment of the insane during eras when Foucault contends that the mad were perceived as possessing wisdom, and that Foucault has thus selectively cited data that supports his assertions while ignoring contrary data. Madness was typically linked with sin by Christian Europeans, noted Merquior, and was therefore regarded as much less benign than Foucault tends to imply. Merquior sees \"Madness and Civilization\" as \"a call for the liberation of the Dionysian id\" similar to Norman O. Brown's \"Life Against Death\" (1959), and an inspiration for Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari's \"Anti-Oedipus\" (1972).\n\nKenneth Lewes writes that \"Madness and Civilization\" is an example of the \"critique of the institutions of psychiatry and psychoanalysis\" that occurred as part of the \"general upheaval of values in the 1960s\". Lewes sees Foucault's work as being similar to, but more profound than, Thomas Szasz's \"The Myth of Mental Illness\" (1961).\n\nThe philosopher Gary Gutting writes:\n\n\n"}

They play in the highest Swedish league, Swedish Hockey League (SHL; formerly Elitserien), where they have played the majority of the seasons during the club's existence. The last time they played in the lower division, Allsvenskan, was in 1995. Frölunda have won the national championship title five times, in 1965, 2003, 2005, 2016 and 2019.\n\nThe club was founded on 3 February 1938, as an ice hockey section in Västra Frölunda IF and became independent on 29 March 1984. Prior to the 1995/1996 season, the nickname Indians was adopted. This referring to the successful years of the 1960s, when fans started to call them the \"Wild West\" (Västra Frölunda is West Frölunda in English). But as they didn't want a nickname like cowboys or something with firearms, Indians became the obvious choice.\nOn 16 June 2004, the club shortened the name from Västra Frölunda Hockey Club to Frölunda Hockey Club. \nFrölunda's home venue is the Scandinavium arena in central Gothenburg, which has a capacity of 12,044 people. Frölundaborg is used when Scandinavium is occupied with other events. Frölunda's average home attendance has been the highest in the league for over a decade.\n\nIn 2003 Frölunda became the champions after a 38-year hiatus. The final game in Scandinavium on 7 April against Färjestad BK was ended by late season recruit Tomi Kallio in the third overtime period.\nIn the 2004–05 season, the club's 60th anniversary and 20th as independent club, the team won the league title, by having the best record during the regular season, and the Swedish Championship. That particular year was notable because the National Hockey League had a labour stoppage due to negotiations between the league and the players association. Many professional hockey players who could not play in the NHL chose to play in European or North American leagues. The largest number of professional NHL players were in Sweden during the season, including Gothenburg native Daniel Alfredsson, who joined his hometown club for the season. This increased the quality of play and many observers said that Elitserien was the best league in the world during 2004–05.\n\nFrölunda set a new Elitserien record on 6 April 2006, by winning the Elitserien playoff semi-finals against Linköpings HC 4–3 after trailing the series 1–3. The season ended with a 2–4 defeat against Färjestads BK in the finals. The second game in the finals Ronnie Sundin played his 685th game for Frölunda becoming the player with most career games for the club.\n\nFrölunda is the biggest winner of the Champions Hockey League, with four titles in 2015–16, 2016–17, 2018–19 and 2019–20.\n\n\"This is a partial list of the last five seasons completed by Frölunda.

The number retired were; the number 13 worn by Lars Erik Lundvall, who spent eight seasons with Frölunda, all of them serving as team captain. The number 14 worn by Ronald \"Sura Pelle\" Pettersson, who spent seven seasons with Frölunda before suffering a career-ending injury on 14 December 1967. The duo of Lundvall and Pettersson was one of the reason behind Frölunda's success in the 60's and secured that hockey got a strong foothold in Gothenburg.

With the exception of two seasons, Larsson played for Frölunda his entire professional career.\n\nTwo Frölunda players have been inducted into the International Ice Hockey Federation's Hall of Fame.

Ayres and Company was an Indianapolis, Indiana, department store founded in 1872 by Lyman S. Ayres. Over the years its Indianapolis flagship store, which opened in 1905 and was later enlarged, became known for its women's fashions, the Tea Room, holiday events and displays, and the basement budget store. As urban populations shifted to the suburbs, Ayres established branch stores in new shopping centers in several Indiana cities. Ayres also acquired retail subsidiaries in Springfield, Illinois; Fort Wayne, Indiana; and Louisville, Kentucky. Ayr-Way, the Ayres discount store subsidiary, became the first discount store launched by a full-line department store. By the end of the 1960s Ayres had become a diversified merchandising business with retail department stores, a chain of discount stores, specialty clothing stores, a home furnishings showroom, and a real estate holding company. A long-time Ayres slogan, \"That Ayres Look\", promoted the company as a fashion leader, and by 1972 it had become the oldest continuous retail slogan in the United States.\n\nAssociated Dry Goods acquired Ayres in 1972. After The May Company acquired Associated Dry Goods in 1986, several Ayres stores were closed. The flagship store in Indianapolis was closed in the spring of 1992 as the remaining Ayres operation merged with May's Famous-Barr division. Federated Department Stores, owner of rival Macy's, acquired The May Company on August 30, 2005. On February 1, 2006, L. S. Ayres was dissolved and folded into the newly formed Macy's Midwest division. On September 9, 2006, the L. S. Ayres name was retired as most stores were converted to Macy's.\n\nLyman S. Ayres, who owned a dry-goods store in Geneva, New York, founded a new firm in Indianapolis, Indiana, in 1872, the year in which he bought controlling interest in N. R. Smith and Company, a dry-goods store that was also known as the Trade Palace. The store was located at 26–28 West Washington Street in Indianapolis. The new store, renamed N. R. Smith and Ayres, opened in January 1872. Ayres bought out Smith's interest in the store in 1874. The name \"L. S. Ayres & Co.\" appeared in February 1874 in an Indianapolis newspaper advertisement. In 1875 Ayres relocated the store across the street to 33–37 West Washington Street, where it remained for thirty years as L. S. Ayres and Company. The store called itself a \"First Class One Price Establishment\" and offered merchandise with uniform quality and price, concepts that were unusual for that time. During the first half of the 20th century, Ayres grew to become one of Indianapolis's leading department stores. In Indianapolis its department store competitors were the William H. Block Company, the H. P. Wasson and Company, and L. S. Strauss and Company. Beginning in 1972 the Lazarus department store chain arrived in Indianapolis as it absorbed the Block's stores. All of these stores offered a full line of merchandise, but Ayres was especially known for its women's fashions.\nFor several years prior to his death in 1896, Lyman had been purchasing real estate along Meridian and Washington streets in Indianapolis, where he intended to build a new store at the intersection of these two prominent downtown streets. Designed by the Indianapolis architectural firm of Vonnegut and Bohn, the new eight-story flagship store opened in 1905. The landmark store at One West Washington Street was enlarged several times. The store's first major expansion was completed in 1915 and doubled the store's size and its frontage along Washington Street. Beginning in the 1920s the company acquired property along Meridian Street, south of its main store, and opened the South Building in September 1929. Postwar growth included an eleven-story addition to the flagship store completed after World War II along Meridian Street, adjacent to the South Building. In the 1950s downtown Indianapolis began to deteriorate as businesses moved outside the city center; however, Ayres continued to buy real estate adjacent to its downtown store. The company bought several old buildings near its flagship store, tore them down, created surface parking on the vacant lots, and later built two parking garages to entice suburban shoppers to drive downtown and park near its store.\n\nDespite Ayres's efforts to improve its Indianapolis flagship store, the city's downtown had declined by the 1970s and the West Washington Street store was surrounded by empty lots and vacant buildings. To encourage economic development of the area, Ayres and others invested in two downtown hotel developments in an effort to attract convention and tourism business. Ayres contributed $3.3 million to development of a downtown Hilton Hotel, which later became a Sheraton Hotel, and $50,000 to the Merchants Plaza project, where a Hyatt Regency Hotel and Merchants Bank offices occupied most of its space.\n\nAs urban populations shifted outward to suburban areas, Ayres moved closer to its customers by establishing branch stores in Indianapolis and Lafayette, Indiana. In 1959 Ayres also opened a large warehouse facility and service center on Hillside Avenue in Indianapolis. In 1965 a new branch store opened in the Greenwood Shopping Center, ten miles south of the Indianapolis flagship store. In 1966 Ayres opened a new branch store at Glenbrook Square in Fort Wayne, Indiana. In addition to building new branch stores in Indiana, Ayres acquired a retail subsidiary, The John Bressmer Company in 1958, located in Springfield, Illinois, and created Ayr-Way, a chain of self-service discount stores. In 1969 Ayres expanded into Louisville, Kentucky, with the acquisition of Kaufman-Straus Company, a retail division of City Stores Corporation. The declining downtown Louisville store was not profitable and Ayres closed it within two years of its purchase. In 1973 Ayres installed an Ayr-Way discount store in the downtown Louisville location, but it also failed and closed in 1975. Two suburban Louisville locations were later merged into Ayres's Indianapolis operations. The City Stores deal also included the acquisition of Wolf and Dessauer (W&D), a leading department store in downtown Fort Wayne, Indiana. In the late 1960s Ayres also entered the field of specialty retailing with the establishment of the Sycamore Shops and Cygnet Shops to cater to young adults.\n\nBy the end of the 1960s Ayres had expanded from department stores into a diversified merchandising business that included the Ayres flagship store in Indianapolis and its branches in Indiana, three subsidiary department stores (Bressmer's, Kaufman's, and W & D), a new chain of discount stores (Ayr-Way and Ayr-Way Discount Foods), specialty stores (Sycamore Shops and Cygnet), a high-end home furnishing shop (Murray Showrooms), and a real estate investment company (Murray Investments).\n\nIn 1972 Ayres was acquired by Associated Dry Goods of New York City. Announced on January 26, 1972, the sale, which exchanged Ayres stock for 1.4 million common shares of Associated Dry Goods stock, was equivalent, at that time, to a purchase price of $78.5 million. In 1983 Associated Dry Goods merged Cincinnati, Ohio-based Pogue's with Ayres. Pogue's stores were renamed L. S. Ayres and Company in 1984 and received $7 million in renovations. In 1985 the Louisville, Kentucky-based Stewart Dry Goods stores were absorbed into Ayres. With strong competition from other retailers, declining profits, and a decaying downtown Louisville, the Stewart Dry Goods stores were renamed L. S. Ayres and Company in 1987 and Ayres spent $6.5 million to remodel the downtown store.\n\nIn 1986 Associated Dry Goods was acquired by The May Department Stores Company in a stock swap valued, at that time, at approximately $2.47 billion. Between 1986 and 1990 several Ayres chairmen and CEOs arrived and departed as the May Company tried to improve Ayres's profitability, which also included store closings in Louisville and Cincinnati. In the late 1980s the May Company shuttered the former Pogue's and Stewart's locations, reducing the number of Ayres locations to fourteen. Three Ayres stores in Cincinnati, Ohio, at Tri-County Mall, Kenwood Towne Centre, and Northgate Mall, were sold to J. C. Penney in 1988. All three stores have since been closed or relocated. In April 1991 a May spokesperson announced that the Ayres flagship store would not be a part of Indianapolis's proposed Circle Centre mall. The project, adjacent to the downtown Ayres store, was already under construction. It was no surprise when May announced on October 25, 1991, that the downtown Indianapolis Ayres store would close in addition to three of its Indiana branches. Also in 1991, the Ayres operations merged with the St. Louis, Missouri-headquartered Famous-Barr division of May, although the Ayres nameplate was retained. Parisian opened a store in the Ayres downtown Indianapolis space in 1995; Carson's replaced the Parisian store in 2007 and it closed in 2018.\n\nFederated Department Stores acquired Macy's in 1994 and The May Department Stores Company in 2005. On February 1, 2006, Ayres was subsumed into the newly created Macy's Midwest (now Macy's Central). Most of the Ayres locations became Macy's stores, with the exception of the Eastland Mall store in Evansville and the Greenwood Park Mall and Castleton Square stores in the Indianapolis suburbs, where the existing Lazarus locations were retained as the surviving Macy's store. The Ayres stores at the Greenwood Park Mall and Castleton Square were later demolished.\n\nAyres offered a full line of merchandise and services, but it was especially known for women's fashions and its Tea Room, Christmas events and displays, and the budget store.\n\nThe Tea Room, which operated at the Indianapolis flagship store from 1905 to 1990, served shoppers in a formal setting. Its purpose was to entice shoppers into the downtown store; the restaurant itself never operated at a profit. The local gathering spot also provided informal modeling of store fashions for its diners, who were predominantly women. The menu, which remained consistent for decades, included favorites such as chicken pot pie, chicken velvet soup, and special desserts for children The Tea Room has been re-created at the Indiana State Museum in Indianapolis. Over the years in-store food options at the Indianapolis flagship store also included a soda fountain, a basement coffee and snack bar, and in the 1970s a cafeteria-style tea room on the balcony overlooking the main floor. Ayres branch stores also included cafeterias and tearooms. The downtown Indianapolis Tea Room survived until 1990. The other restaurants closed after Ayres was acquired by the May Company in 1986.\n\nAyres's seasonal departments, events, and displays earned the company media coverage and drew thousands of visitors to Ayres with the hope they would stay and shop. On the night before Thanksgiving in 1947, a bronze cherub appeared on the Indianapolis flagship store's large, outdoor clock at the corner of Meridian and Washington Streets. The three-foot cherub remained on the clock until Christmas, beginning an annual holiday tradition. Ayres was also known for beautiful Christmas decorations, especially its elaborate window displays. Planned months in advance, these holiday windows had a different theme each year. The store expanded its holiday area to include toy displays and a Santa's workshop. After World War II Ayres provided telephone visits with Santa and live television broadcasts. From 1958 through 1961 the Santa Claus Express, a miniature electric train, gave children rides through the store's Christmas display. Beginning in the 1940s the downtown Indianapolis store also provided visits with a costumed Easter Bunny. In 1957 a group of live barnyard animals joined the annual Easter celebration.\n\nThe Ayres Economy Basement concept dates back to the opening of its Indianapolis flagship store in 1905. The Economy Basement, later known as the Downstairs Store and Budget Store, operated differently from those of other retail department stores. The Ayres basement store did not offer cheaply made, inferior goods. Instead, it sold lower-priced items of good quality that served as an entry point for less-affluent customers until they could afford full-priced goods on the upper floors. It also served as a training ground for Ayres managers. By the 1960s the Budget Store had declined and was eclipsed by Ayr-Way, the Ayres discount subsidiary, and changes in shopping trends and pricing. The Budget Store concept was eliminated in the mid-1980s.\n\nThe L.S. Ayres Annex Warehouse, an Italianate-style brick building on Maryland Street, south of the flagship store, was originally called Elliott's Block. Built in 1875 for Calvin A. Elliott, a wholesale liquor merchant, the warehouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.\n\nIn May 1958 the first Ayres branch stores opened in Market Square Shopping Center in Lafayette, Indiana. In August 1958 Ayres opened another branch in the new Glendale Shopping Center at Sixty-second Street and Keystone Avenue on Indianapolis's north side in a joint venture between Ayres and Landau and Perlman, a Chicago developer. Additional branches were opened in Indianapolis and other Indiana markets in the 1960s and 1970s. These included the Greenwood Shopping Center (1965) in Greenwood and Ayres Glenbrook (1966) in Fort Wayne. After Ayres was acquired by Associated Dry Goods, the company opened additional Ayres stores in Indiana shopping malls: Lafayette Square Mall (1973) and Washington Square (1975) in Indianapolis, Scottsdale (1971) in South Bend, Muncie Mall (1977), Southlake (1978) in Merrillville, University Park Mall (1979) in Mishawaka, and College Mall (1982) in Bloomington.\n\nFrom 1919 until the early 1930s Ayres operated two specialty shops during the tourist season at the French Lick Springs Hotel, a resort and spa in southern Indiana. The shops offered gifts, accessories, lingerie, and sportswear. In August 1955 Ayres opened the Boulevard Shop, a boutique in Indianapolis's Marott Hotel. The gift shop moved to a new location in the Stouffer Hotel on Meridian Street in Indianapolis in 1967 and remained there until it closed in the 1980s.\n\nIn 1968 Ayres opened small specialty fashion shops, the Sycamore Shop and Cygnet. The Sycamore Shop catered to young adults and featured traditional clothing and accessories for men and women. The Cygnet Shops were modern fashion stores for young women. The first Sycamore Shop opened in Lafayette Square shopping center in Indianapolis; the first Cygnet Shop opened in Terre Haute, Indiana. By 1971 about a dozen of these shops were operating in suburban malls in Indiana, Ohio, and Kentucky. While the Cygnet Shops closed in 1975, the Sycamore Shops continued to expand, even after The May Department Stores Company acquired Ayres and its parent company, Associated Dry Goods, in 1986. Three Ayres executives purchased the Sycamore Shops from the May company and continued to operate the specialty chain. By 1990 there were 160 Sycamore Shops operating in five states. Sycamore Shops later filed for bankruptcy and forced to liquidate in late 1995 and early 1996.\n\nAround 1914 the Ayres family established Murray Investments, a holding company that owned the store's real estate, which was leased back to Ayres. The subsidiary also provided for future expansions with the acquisition of additional land in Anderson, Indianapolis, South Bend, and Evansville, Indiana. Owned by the Ayres family, Murray Investments merged with L. S. Ayres Company in the late 1960s and provided the company with approximately $3.6 million in equity capital. The merger also increased Ayres family ownership of the company to 67 percent.\n\nIn September 1954 Ayres opened a new wholly owned subsidiary called the Murray Showrooms, which was open only to the interior decorator trade. The Indianapolis showroom, located at 31 West Thirteenth Street, operated like the Chicago Merchandise Mart and was the only one of its kind in Indiana. In 1960 Ayres opened a second location, in the Cincinnati suburb of Kenwood, Ohio, but it underperformed and was closed in 1965. The Indianapolis store survived until the late 1970s and was liquidated in 1982 after the showroom's roof collapsed.\n\nIn 1958 Ayres acquired The John Bressmer Company, located in Springfield, Illinois, and continued to operate the store under the Bressmer name. The modern, six-story downtown store was known for its quality fashions and customer service and became a training ground for Ayres managers. William P. Arnold, who joined Ayres in 1947, became Bressmer's president and moved on to become president and CEO of J. W. Robinson's and president, CEO, and board chairman of Associated Dry Goods. P. Gerald Mills, an Ayres buyer, moved to Bressmer's and later became president of Dayton's, president of the J. L. Hudson Company, and the president of the Dayton-Hudson Corporation. David P. Williams III, who also spent time at Bressmer's, became president of Associated Dry Goods. In 1972 Bressmer's was sold to Associated Dry Goods and became a branch of Stix, Baer and Fuller, an Associated Dry Goods subsidiary. In 1980 the downtown Springfield store closed after a new Stix, Baer and Fuller branch opened on the city's south side.\n\nIn 1969 Ayres acquired two department store divisions from City Stores: Kaufman-Straus, based in Louisville, Kentucky, and the Wolf & Dessauer Company, with two stores in Fort Wayne, Indiana. These stores were later converted to Ayres locations.\n\nAyres developed a discount store format called Ayr-Way in 1961 and opened its first Ayr-Way store at Thirty-eighth Street and Pendleton Pike in Indianapolis on October 13, 1961. This subsidiary was one of the first discount store divisions launched by a traditional department store. The Indianapolis Ayr-Way store opened prior to the first Kmart, which opened in Garden City, Michigan, in March 1962, and the first Target store, which opened in May 1962. Ayres also opened Ayr-Way stores in other cities.\n\nAyres encountered several challenges in establishing and operating the new discount store concept. First, Ayres needed to define a clear brand identity for the new subsidiary and its relationship to the L. S. Ayres store brand. Second, errors in selection of store locations posed challenges. Ayres built discount stores in areas of economic decline or in locations that were not yet sufficiently developed. Finally, Ayres's efforts to establish supermarkets adjacent to its discount stores proved unsuccessful. In fiscal year 1970, two years after their initial introduction, the Ayr-Way food stores, leased and operated by Scot-Lad Foods of Chicago, caused Ayres an after-tax loss of $320,000. Ayres sold its food stores to Scot-Lad Foods in 1970 and concentrated on Ayr-Way's general merchandise.\n\nAfter Associated Dry Goods bought Ayres in 1972, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission objected to the merger because of the anticompetitive effects of its stores in Louisville and Lexington, Kentucky, and in Evansville, Indiana, where Ayr-Way and Stewarts Dry Goods stores were located. There were also two Ayres department stores in Louisville, along with one each in Danville, Illinois and Champaign, Illinois. Under antitrust pressure from the Federal Trade Commission, Associated Dry Goods sold its Ayr-Way discount subsidiary for $19.9 million in 1976 and closed the deal in early 1977. In 1980 the Ayr-Way chain, consisting of 40 stores and one distribution center, was acquired by the Dayton Hudson Corporation (now Target Corporation). The stores were remodeled and reopened as Target stores in 1981.\n\nIn 1872 Lyman Ayres acquired controlling interest the Indianapolis dry-goods business owned by N. R. Smith and Company with an initial investment of $40,000 in sight drafts and notes. In 1874 Ayres bought out Smith's interest in the store and became its sole owner in 1895 after James G. Thomas, who owned a 25 percent stake in the store, retired from the company.\n\nL. S. Ayres and Company was incorporated in 1896 with $200,000 in capital. After Lyman's death in 1896, his son, Frederick M. (Fred) Ayres, was elected company president. Lyman's widow, Maria H. Ayres, became secretary-treasurer and his son-in-law, William B. Wheelock, became vice president. The company remained a family-owned business, with the exception of two Ayres employee shareholders, until the company's initial public offering in the early 1950s. During the 1940s the board was expanded from five to include as many as nine members who represented the interests of the store, the general public, and the Ayres family. In the 1960s and early 1970s Ayres expanded its board of directors to include outside business leaders and additional Ayres executives.\n\n\nThe company's initial public offering was made in the mid-1950s, when Ayres issued 52,250 shares of stock. This offering raised approximately $1 million in capital while the Ayres family retained 85 percent ownership.\n\nAfter its initial stock offering in the 1950s the company's profits grew, with earnings over $47 million in 1956, a company record up to that time. In 1957 profits set another record, more than $50 million in sales, with $1.2 million in net earnings, or $3.09 per common share. In fiscal year 1966 Ayres had sales of $106.3 million, with net income of $3.1 million, or $2.51 per share. On 31 July 1971, after years of annual profits, Ayres reported a quarterly loss of $404,000.\n\nIn the 1980s, after becoming part of Associated Dry Goods, Ayres added new locations, remodeled out-of-date stores, and was a profitable subsidiary. In 1985 the Ayres Glendale branch in Indianapolis ranked second among the 438 Associated Dry Goods stores in profitability. Only the Lord & Taylor flagship store in New York City, another Associated Dry Goods subsidiary, ranked higher. In 1985 Ayres stores enjoyed at least a 60 percent market share in the most of the cities where it operated its stores. However, Ayres stores, with sales of $103 per square foot, lagged behind other May Company subsidiaries.\n\nIn 1971 the ratio of Ayres minority employees to its total employees was reported at around 9 percent. Most of the company's minority employees worked at the downtown stores in Indianapolis and Fort Wayne, Indiana, and Louisville, Kentucky. Indianapolis had the highest percentage of minority employees at 17 percent.\n\nFlora Krauch, the company's first woman executive, arrived at Ayres in 1909 as a buyer and established the store's successful children's department. Beverly Rice became the store's first female vice president in 1969 as a merchandise manager for the Cygnet Shops and women's better apparel. Rice was promoted to vice president and general merchandise manager in 1976 and retired from Ayres in 1983. In 1972 Ayres named Marlene Druien as the first woman store manager. Druien managed the Ayres Dixie Manor store in Louisville, Kentucky. Other women store managers included Florence Elias, a longtime Ayres employee who managed several Ayres branch stores, and Mary Alice Fogarty, who was named manager of the Ayres branch in Lafayette, Indiana, in 1974 and retired from Ayres in 1979.\n\n\n\n"}

It was named after the New Idria Mercury Mine, which closed in 1972, resulting in a ghost town.\n\nThe area is inside Area code 831. It is included in the Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control District and the Panoche Elementary School District. San Benito Mountain, elevation , is located southeast. The nearest city is King City along U.S. Route 101.\n\nThe New Idria Mercury Mine was named in honor of the world's then second largest quicksilver mine in what was then Idria, Austria, now Idrija, Slovenia; (Slovene pronunciation [ĭdrija], California English pronunciation [īdria].) The town grew to support the mining operations, but the mine closed in the 1970s. The town is currently an abandoned ghost town with more than 100 standing buildings, though vandalism has contributed to their deterioration in recent years. According to the US Geological Survey, both Idria (primary) and New Idria (variant) are recognized for federal use in describing the community.\n\nThe community was established to support the mine, which mainly extracted mercury, since cinnabar was abundant in the local rock formations. Mercury mining at the location began in 1854. At one time, the New Idria mines were America's second most productive mines, with the New Almaden mines in the vicinity of San Jose, about northwest, being the first.\n\nThe discovery of mercury ore at New Idria came soon after the discovery of gold in the Sierra foothills, which began the California gold rush. At that time, mercury was important in extracting gold from gold ore. Before the New Idria and New Almaden Quicksilver Mines, the mercury came almost exclusively from Europe.\n\nThe New Idria Mining Company was formed soon after the discovery of cinnabar (quicksilver ore) in the southern Diablo Range of central California in 1854. The town of New Idria began around 1857 and about 300 men were employed at the mine by 1861. The first school opened in 1867 and the New Idria Post Office opened in 1869, with Edward A. Morse as the first postmaster. In 1894, the New Idria Post Office dropped the word \"New\" and the town become known as Idria. The New Idria Quicksilver Mining Company closed in 1972 and the town has since become a ghost town.\n\nNew Idria is a California Historical Landmark (#324) and home of the world’s first Gould Rotary Furnace, which revolutionized ore processing technology worldwide.\n\nOn July 30, 2010, a fire destroyed 13 buildings on the north side of town.\n\nIn 2011, New Idria was re-listed as a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Superfund site, owing to unchecked mercury run-off and contamination. As of June, 2012, the entire section of the former town site on the south side of New Idria/Clear Creek road is fenced-off.\n\nThe New Idria Mercury Mine was initially investigated in the 1990s by the EPA, for possible inclusion on the EPA's National Priorities List, but the site did not rank high enough at that time to be listed. A site reassessment was begun in 2002, and an expanded site assessment begun in 2009, which was concluded in October 2010. In March 2011, the EPA proposed New Idria to its National Priority List. Elevated levels of mercury were found downstream of the town, as well as significant levels of mercury and other heavy metals found within tailings piles on the site. The region has a long history of mining, with asbestos and chromium being mined in addition to mercury; the EPA's 2004 Risk Assessment for the nearby Clear Creek Management Area identified 86 separate abandoned mines in the vicinity.\nThe natural rock formations in the area have been shedding asbestos-rich debris into stream valleys for millions of years The average New Idria rock contains 5-15% by volume short fiber asbestos. The 2010 edition of Rand McNally's \"The Road Atlas\" labels the area immediately south of New Idria as an \"Asbestos Hazard Area\".\n\nThe New Idria Mining District is known for its abundance of rare minerals such as benitoite, named after the San Benito River. Gem quality benitoite is only found in this area of the world. New Idria is also home to serpentinite rock. Many thousands of tectonic events acting on the serpentinite have produced extensive deposits of short-fiber asbestos.\n\n\n"}

A study on madness with comic and tragic elements, it is about a man who believes himself to be Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor. It has been translated into English by Tom Stoppard, among others. Rex Harrison starred in a noted British production which went to Broadway in 1973, though the Stoppard translation was not used in the production. In 2019, it was ranked by \"The Independent\" as one of the 40 greatest plays ever written.\n\nAn unnamed Italian aristocrat falls off his horse while playing the role of Henry IV during carnevale festivities, which take place annually before Lent. After he comes to, he believes himself to be Henry. For the next twenty years, his family, including his sister and now his nephew, Marchese Carlo Di Nolli, maintain an elaborate charade in a remote Umbrian villa, decorated to resemble Henry's imperial palace at Goslar and staffed with servants hired to play the roles of Henry's privy councillors and simulate the eleventh-century court.\n\nDe Nolli's dying mother requests that he bring a doctor, Dionisio Genoni, who is referred to as the latest in a succession to try to cure Henry.

Henry mistakes the disguised Belcredi for the monk Peter Damian and reacts angrily, but is later calmed.\n\nAct two begins with speculation among the visitors about Henry, as well as what he sees in Matilda, who argues constantly with Belcredi. Henry enters once more and his behaviour is increasingly erratic. Once the visitors arrive Henry declares to his councillors that he is not truly mad, but has been aware of the nature of his existence for some time. However he has preferred to stay as he was than to live in the 20th century (the play is set around 1900). His behaviour and speech remain abnormal.\n\nUpon learning of this revelation the visitors confront Henry, who acts angrily to them, particularly Belcredi. At the end of the act he grabs Frida, who is dressed as in the portrait in preparation for the Doctor's plan to shock Henry out of his madness. In the ensuing altercation Henry stabs Belcredi. The visitors flee, and Henry resumes his regal persona as the curtain falls.\nThe play was adapted into the film of the same name.\n"}

He was a Teachta Dála (TD) for over twenty five years.\n\nFahey was born in Clonmel, County Tipperary in 1928. He was educated locally at the Christian Brothers School. Following his education he worked as a farmer, an auctioneer and an insurance broker. Fahey first entered politics in 1950 when he was elected to Waterford County Council. He held his seat on that authority until 1970, and later from 1974 to 1999.\n\nHe was first elected to Dáil Éireann as a Fianna Fáil Teachta Dála (TD) for the Tipperary South constituency at the 1965 general election. It was his second attempt to get elected, having earlier contested the 1961 general election. From the 1977 general election onwards, he was elected for the Waterford constituency. \n\nLike many other TDs, Fahey began to grow disillusioned with the leadership of Jack Lynch by the late 1970s. He and others were particularly concerned that George Colley would succeed Lynch as leader of Fianna Fáil and Taoiseach. Fahey was instrumental in forming the so-called \"gang of five\" with Albert Reynolds, Mark Killilea, Tom McEllistrim and Seán Doherty. This group began to lobby the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party on behalf of Charles Haughey, whom they regarded as a better choice for leader than Colley.\n\nHaughey was the eventual winner of the leadership contest and rewarded Fahey by appointing him Minister of State at the Department of Environment, a post he held from 1979 to 1981. He was not re-appointed in any future Haughey government but remained a Haughey loyalist. Fahey contested the 1989 European Parliament election for the Munster constituency but was not elected. He was annoyed at his running mate in the constituency, and subsequently voted against the proposed Fianna Fáil–Progressive Democrats coalition; this action lost him the party whip. He re-applied for membership of the party in 1990 and was re-admitted. \n\nFahey lost his seat at the 1992 general election. He served out his council term on Waterford City Council, and retired from politics in 1999.\n\nHe died on 18 March 2019, aged 91.\n"}

Stewart was also a significant Christian philanthropist and cofounder of the Bible Institute of Los Angeles (now known as Biola University). He and his brother Milton also anonymously funded publication of \"The Fundamentals\", the foundation document of Christian fundamentalism. Stewart also helped found the Union Rescue Mission in Los Angeles.\n\nStewart was born in northwestern Pennsylvania, and worked for his father who was a tanner. When Edwin Drake discovered oil near Titusville, Pennsylvania in 1859, Stewart tried drilling wells in the same area. After two disastrous attempts, he served a three-year enlistment in the 16th Pennsylvania Cavalry during the American Civil War.\n\nAfter the war, Stewart again tried to drill for oil, but he was still unsuccessful. In 1877, Stewart was introduced to Wallace Hardison (a relative of one of his friends). Hardison agreed to financially support Stewart, so they purchased some land where they hoped to find oil. They enjoyed some moderate success. When John D. Rockefeller started to consolidate oil holdings in the eastern U.S., Hardison and Stewart sold their interests to Standard Oil and moved to California.\n\nStewart and his partner found the success they sought in California. By 1886, the Hardison and Stewart Oil Company was responsible for 15% of all oil production in California. In 1890, they merged their interests with those of Thomas Bard and Paul Calonico to form the Union Oil Company. As president of Union Oil, Stewart heavily invested in new wells and expanded his company's market capitalization from $10 million in 1900 to over $50 million in 1908.\n\nStewart founded the Pacific Gospel Mission (now the Union Rescue Mission) in 1891.

Her mother is German-born Christiane Bieberbach.\n\nAt a rave in 1990, she was noticed by producers Ian Munro, Kevin Dodds and Nigel Walton, who at the time were known as A.S.K., an offshoot of The Spiral Tribe, who at the time was signed to MCA Records UK and had released a single called \"Dream\", when she was invited to appear on stage as their dancer. It was through this meeting that they would form a dance act called Opus III. Their first single, a cover version of the song \"It's a Fine Day\" from their debut album \"Mind Fruit\", was an international success and Top 10 hit on UK Singles Chart, and reached No. 1 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in 1992. A reversed sample of Hawkshaw's singing from this track was used in the Orbital track \"Halcyon\", the music video for which featured Hawkshaw. Opus III also had another US number 1 hit on the same chart in 1994 with \"When You Made the Mountain\", from their second and final album, \"Guru Mother\".\n\nIn a 2009 interview, she recalled her decision to end her association with Opus III, saying she felt that she did not want to be part of a \"commercialized\" act, wanted to go in a different direction, and felt that she did not have sufficient input in writing and production, which led to conflict with the rest of the band; she has also ruled out any plans for a reunion if it ever happens. She has also been critical of the dance music industry more broadly, especially performers lip synching other people's songs, and using original artists' vocals without permission or credit.\n\nAfter the group broke up in 1994, Hawkshaw pursued a solo career and since then has been in demand by other acts in the dance, house, Eurodance, trance, and electronica community, including Tiësto, Delerium, BT, Fragma, Seba, and Paradox, among others.\n\nHer solo single \"Fine Day\" peaked at number 62 in the UK Singles Chart in November 2002.\n\nHawkshaw contributed a track titled \"Telephone Song\" to the children's compilation album \"For the Kids Too!\", released in 2004.\n\nOn 10 October 2005, she released \"Meta-Message\", a collection of older and newer songs, after a growing interest in her out-of-print album, \"O.U.T.\"\n\nThe record label Magnatune released her ambient album, \"The Ice Castle\", in 2008.\n\n"}

He had a trombone sound that was often compared to Tommy Dorsey. Shepard is also known as a photographer, who took behind-the-scenes photographs of many of the top entertainers of the 1960s.\n\nTommy Shepard began playing trombone in his junior year in high school. The next year he won a national solo contest and by the time he was 19 he was on the road with the Ben Bernie Orchestra. After twelve months with Ben Bernie, he enlisted in the United States Army and played in a variety of Army big bands, finally winding up with Wayne King's Orchestra at Fort Sheridan, Illinois, where he played for two years, making V-Discs, working bond rallies and generally supporting the nation's spirits.\n\nReleased from service in 1946, he settled down in Chicago working first at the Chez Paree, then on the staff of the orchestras at NBC, ABC, and finally CBS.\n\nWhile he was at ABC, Shepard was granted six months leave of absence in 1953 to join Stan Kenton on first trombone (his section mates were Frank Rosolino and Bill Russo). The invitation to join Kenton came as a direct result of a rehearsal band that Shepard had formed in 1948. It was a big swinging band that gave some of the top studio musicians in Chicago a chance to perform once a week. Shepard kept the band going until 1953 when he went with Kenton.\n\nIn 1960 Shepard started working in Hollywood and quickly became one of the city's busiest free-lance studio trombone players. He was a regular recording artist for Capitol Records, Reprise Records, and Verve Records during this time. He was also part of the house band for \"The Hollywood Palace\" television show, \"The Joey Bishop Show\" (1967–1969 talk show), and worked in many Hollywood film orchestras.\n\nDuring 1963 Shepard began to document his time working in the Hollywood studios with his camera. His photography brought a new perspective to an era of American music that would end with the British Invasion. His photographs were eventually donated to University of Arizona's School of Music in 2005, where his collection now resides.\n\nIn the 1970s Shepard began leading his own orchestra again, which performed for numerous events in southern California. He also contracted for the Nelson Riddle Orchestra – when Nelson Riddle was unavailable – and led the Nelson Riddle Alumni Orchestra after Riddle's passing. Shepard continued to lead his own orchestra until succumbing to a heart attack, at his home in Indian Wells, California, in 1993. His remains were interred at Coachella Valley Public Cemetery in Coachella, California.\n\nWith Stan Kenton\n\n"}

He studied law at Heidelberg, but on account of ill health spent much of his time from 1850 in travel. \n\nHe was a passionate traveller as well as an attentive observer and a good storyteller. Succeeding to his father's property in 1852, he extended the range of his journeys to Morocco and other parts of Barbary. Before his return home in 1854, he had also visited Egypt, Palestine, and other countries of the Levant. In 1856-1857 he was again in Algeria; in 1858 he reached the cities of Morocco; and in 1860 he succeeded in performing the pilgrimage to Mecca, which he afterwards described in \"Meine Wallfahrt nach Mekka\" (Leipzig, 1865). He had to flee for his life to Jidda without visiting Medina.\n\nHe then visited Aden and Bombay. After some two years of study in Europe, he again began to wander through the coasts and islands of the Mediterranean, repeatedly visiting Algeria. His first book of travel, \"Drei Jahre im Nordwesten von Afrika\" (Leipzig), appeared in 1863. It was followed by a variety of works and essays, popular and scientific. Maltzan's last book, \"Reise nach Südarabien\" (Brunswick, 1873), is chiefly valuable as a digest of much information about little-known parts of South Arabia collected from natives during a residence at Aden in 1870-1871. Among his other services to science must be noticed his collection of Punic inscriptions (\"Reise in Tunis und Tripolis\", Leipzig, 1870), and the editing of Adolph von Wrede's remarkable journey in Hadramut (\"Reise in Hadramaut, &c.\", Brunswick, 1870). \n\nAfter long suffering from neuralgia, Maltzan died by his own hand at Pisa.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2329281", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2329281", "title": "Trophy (countermeasure)", "text": "Trophy (countermeasure)\n\nTrophy (Israel Defense Forces designation מעיל רוח, lit. \"Windbreaker\") is a military active protection system (APS) for vehicles. It intercepts and destroys incoming missiles, rockets, and tank HEAT rounds with a shotgun-like blast. Its principal purpose is to supplement the armour of light and heavy armored fighting vehicles. Developed by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd. of Israel and currently fielding over 1,000 systems to all major Israeli ground combat platforms (Merkava Mark 3 & 4 and Namer APCs), as well as U.S. Abrams M1A1/2, and tested on the Stryker APCs and Bradley AFVs. Trophy protects against a wide variety of anti-tank threats, while also maximizing the vehicle's ability to identify enemy location to crews and combat formation, thereby providing greater survivability and maneuverability in all combat theatres.\n\nTrophy's first production contract was signed in 2007. Safety certification was granted in 2010. First deliveries started immediately afterward. The design includes the Elta EL/M-2133 F/G band fire-control radar with four flat-panel antennas mounted on the vehicle, with a 360-degree field of view. When a projectile is detected, the internal computer calculates an approach vector before the projectile arrives. Once the incoming weapon is classified, the computers calculate the optimal time and angle to fire the counter-measures. The response comes from two rotating launchers installed on the sides of the vehicle which fire a very small number of a MEFPs (Multiple Explosive Formed Penetrators) which form a very tight, precise matrix, aimed at a specific point on the anti-tank projectile's warhead. The system is designed to have a very small kill zone so that it does not endanger personnel near the protected vehicle. \n\nTrophy is a modular system that enables connectivity to other systems, such as soft-kill, C4I systems, remote-controlled weapon stations, etc. The system is designed to work against all types of anti-tank missiles, rockets, and tank HEAT rounds, including handheld weapons such as rocket propelled grenades and recoilless rifles. The system can simultaneously engage several threats arriving from different directions, is effective on stationary or moving platforms, and is effective against both short- and long-range threats. Newer versions of the system include a reloading feature for multiple firings. The Trophy development plan includes an enhanced countermeasures unit to be available in the future for protection against kinetic energy penetrators.\n\nThe primary role of Trophy is defence against missile strikes, particularly for lighter armored personnel carriers, which are very vulnerable to rocket attacks. Since 2011, the system has achieved 100% success in all low and high-intensity combat events, in diversified terrain (urban, open and foliage). The system has intercepted a variety of threats, including the Kornet ATGM, RPG-29, etc. the U.S Army has reported similar success in tests. “I tried to kill the Abrams tank 48 times and failed,” said US Army Col. Glenn Dean. According to Rafael, by 2017, Trophy has accrued over 50,000 operating hours in deployment, bringing the system to a maximum reliability level. In order to ensure minimal collateral damage and low residual penetration, Rafael selected a unique kill mechanism for Trophy, with a surgical effect. The system uses a miniature EFP which penetrates the threat envelope and disintegrates RPGs at a safe distance from the vehicle. In the ATGM's case, the EFP will affect the chemical energy jet, dramatically decreasing its penetration capability into medium-sized platforms. Moreover, it has been proven in tests and wartime, that such a kill mechanism poses an extremely low risk to dismounts around the vehicle, and therefore does not affect usual combined arms tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP). In order to provide thousands of systems to its customers, Rafael established the first Trophy production line in Israel in 2007, which began delivery in 2010. An additional production line was established in the U.S in 2012, which started deliveries in 2015, with a primary purpose of providing Trophy systems to the IDF as part of the FMF (Foreign Military Funding). Both production line will be used for the U.S. contract and others.\n\nTrophy's radar is responsible for searching, detecting, classifying, locating, and reporting potential threats to the vehicle's onboard computer network and beyond to the tactical network, creating a Hostile Fire Detection (HFD) capability, which alerts the crew and formation from incoming threats, and instantly provides the exact shooter location on the existing platform display. If Trophy identifies that the threat is going to miss the platform, it will not activate the countermeasure but will provide the shooter location, enabling instantaneous engagement by the combat team, preventing further attacks. The advantage of the built-in HFD capability in symmetric warfare is its ability to provide enemy tank location as well, enabling the combat team to counter-attack the enemy tank.\n\nThe system is currently incapable of defeating kinetic energy tank rounds. Prior to Rafael's declaration of its Medium-sized vehicle active protection Trophy variant (Trophy MV/VPS), there were claims regarding Trophy HV's size and weight.\n\nPreviously known as \"Trophy Light\", \"Trophy MV/VPS\" was unveiled by Rafael Advanced Defence Systems at Britain’s DSEi 2007. While the standard Trophy was designed for main battle tanks, Trophy MV/VPS is designed for integration with light and medium armoured vehicles, such as the Stryker, Bradley, etc. It is expected to be about 40% less in weight and size of the standard Trophy and cost less while maintaining the same performance and reliability as the Trophy HV variant, this as a result of the use of the same major critical elements - the sensor suite, the mission computer, and the hard-kill mechanism, using the same combat algorithms. It has been reported that Leonardo DRS, Rafael's partner for Trophy in the U.S will provide the modified auto-loader for the system. In the Summer of 2018, Rafael conducted an extensive series of qualification tests for Trophy MV/VPS in Israel, with the presence of over 130 decision makers and technical experts from over 15 countries. The tests were conducted in extreme scenarios, using both rockets and ATGMs. The reported success rate was over 95%. \n\nIn June 2014, Rafael unveiled Trophy LV, a lighter application of the system designed to offer protection to light military vehicles (less than 8 tons) such as jeeps and 4x4s. It weighs , significantly less than other Trophy applications.\n\nIn December 2014, it was revealed that Rafael, IAI, and Israel Military Industries had agreed to jointly develop a next-generation active defense system for vehicles, based on a combination of the Rafael/IAI Trophy and IMI Iron Fist. Rafael will act as the main contractor and system developer and integrator, and IAI and IMI will be subcontractors. The Defense Ministry had pushed the companies to work together and combine their systems.. No progress has been reported since then.\n\nTrophy has been evaluated with extensive testing on a Stryker vehicle for possible adoption by the US Army, and a Canadian LAV III. The Army tested the Trophy system in 2017, to be fielded within two years as an interim capability until the Modular Active Protection System (MAPS) program produces a system. A 193 million dollar contract for Trophy was awarded to Leonardo DRS, Rafael's American partner, in June 2018, in order to equip a significant number of Abrams M1A1/A2 MBTs with Trophy.\n\nFollowing the series of tests of the Trophy system, the IDF Ground Forces Command declared the Trophy operational in August 2009. It was scheduled to be installed in an entire battalion of Israeli Armored Corps tanks by 2010.\n\nOn March 1, 2011, stationed near the Gaza border, a Merkava MK IV equipped with the Trophy system foiled a missile attack aimed toward it and became the first operational success of the Trophy active defence system.\nOn March 20, 2011, a missile was fired at a Merkava MK IV tank equipped with Trophy system inside the Israeli area along the perimeter fence of the Gaza Strip. The system detected the attack, but determined that it did not endanger the tank and did not intercept it; it passed information about the shooting to the crew, who attacked the source of fire.\nOn August 1, 2012, Trophy successfully intercepted an anti-tank missile launched from the Gaza Strip at a Merkava tank near Kissufim junction.\n\nOn July 14, 2014, the Trophy system successfully intercepted a 9M133 Kornet anti-tank missile fired from Gaza at an IDF tank. Since the beginning of the Israeli Operation Protective Edge to July 20, 2014, at least four Israeli tanks of senior commanders were protected by the Trophy system in the Gaza Strip. According to reports from the front, since the beginning of the ground operation, the system successfully intercepted five anti-tank missiles that were aimed at armored IDF vehicles in Gaza. On July 22, 2014, according to a video by a Palestinian group, the Trophy system installed on a Merkava IV tank successfully intercepted an RPG-29 rocket fired at the tank. According to Debkafile, Hamas has tried to stop Israeli tanks with two kinds of advanced guided anti-tank missiles, the Russian Kornet-E, and the 9M113 Konkurs, but Trophy intercepted them successfully. The appearance of near-invulnerable mobile land platforms suggest the current warfare paradigm may need revising.\nTrophy is currently operational on all Merkava Mark-IV tanks of the IDF's 401st Armored Brigade, as well as with the 7th Armored Brigade 75th Battalion new Merkava IV tanks. In July, the Israeli MOD announced it has completed the integration of Trophy on its first brigade company of NAMER APCs. in November 2016 it was announced that the IDF will purchase hundreds more Trophy systems to be installed on almost all of its Merkava 4 MBTs and NAMER APC/IFVs.\n\nNo tanks were damaged during Operation Protective Edge, with the Trophy Active Protection system performing over a dozen interceptions of anti-tank weapons including Kornet, Metis and RPG-29. The system, by identifying the source of fire, on occasion also allowed tanks to kill the Hamas anti-tank team.\n\nGiora Katz, head of Rafael's land division, stated that it was a \"breakthrough because it is the first time in military history where an active defense system has proven itself in intense fighting.\" During the war, Trophy validated itself in dozens of events, protecting tanks and crews over three weeks of high-threat maneuvering operations in built-up areas without a single hit to defended platforms and zero false alarms\".\n\nThe Trophy \"Heavy\" system costs around 900,000 to mount on a Merkava Mk. IVM.\n\n\n"}

The Forum, as it is commonly referred to, is a global event which takes place every 4 years, in a different city each time, and seeks to reunite citizens from a varied range of cultures, languages, religions to foster inter-cultural dialogue and to promote global civil society empowerment. This massive event gathered an approximate 4 million visitors to Monterrey, and was mostly free of charge.\n\nThe Universal Forum of Cultures project was born in 1996 in the city of Barcelona, Spain. The mayor of Barcelona identified that, after the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games, there was a large number of international events that fostered competition. On the other hand, there was no event dedicated to empowering civil society or focused on the celebrations of the arts and culture. The proposal to create such an event was then presented in 1997 to UNESCO by the delegation of Spain, and unanimously approved by all member states represented in the Organization.\n\nIn 1999, UNESCO signed a cooperation agreement with the Forum Foundation, that established the Organization as the chief partner and main sponsor of the event.\n\nIn 2004, Barcelona hosted the first Universal Forum of Cultures: Barcelona 2004, which lasted 141 days and established the event as the major global gathering for arts, culture and dialogues. Upon concluding the 2004 Forum, the Forum Foundation selected the city of Monterrey, Mexico to host the 2007 Forum. Other candidate cities in the race included important venues such as Amsterdam, Montreal, Durban, and Fukuoka.\n\nIn 2005, during UNESCO's 33rd General Conference it was decided that UNESCO would again be the main partner of the Forum providing technical assistance and promotion of the Forum with international governmental and non-governmental organizations (NGO).\n\nThe main objectives of the Universal Forum of the Cultures Monterrey 2007, were the following:\n\nThe Universal Forum of Cultures Monterrey 2007 revolved around 4 Core Concepts or Axis. These 4 topics sum up the vast majority of issues and problems faced by global civil society and will remain, according to experts, the most urgent and relevant working areas for the global community. The 4 Core Concepts of the 2007 Forum were:\n\n\nThe existence of cultural diversity in the world is an undeniable fact. People often coexist with others who share different beliefs, traditions and customs. Forum seeks to provide knowledge of the circumstances in which others live, new ways to see the world, respect our planet, and seek social advancement. Forum allowed us to understand the particular elements which entail the richness of our modern world, and seeks to identify the differences between cultures, to promote a respectful, peaceful coexistence.\n\nSustainability is an issue of major transcendence in the contemporary world, which needs to find new options for economic, social, and cultural development; seeking an improved utilization of natural resources for the benefit of the planet and its inhabitants. Forum took on this sensitive topic not only from an environmental perspective, but from a wide spectrum of approaches.\n\nKnowledge is a human construction designed to organize and convey our experiences in the world. The challenge is learning how to make the best use of it so we can achieve an effective improvement in our quality of life. This topic was proposed by the 2007 Monterrey Forum, as it was not debated in Barcelona 2004.\n\nPaving a way for peace does not only mean preventing armed warfare. In the Universal Forum of Cultures, new dialogues on peace were instituted on all levels. Peace with ourselves and the people around us, peace with our ecosystem, and peace amongst peoples and nations. Keeping in mind at all times that there can be no peace where basic needs have not been satisfied.\n\nThe 4 Core Concepts of the Monterrey 2007 Forum were carried out in 4 separate activities programmes. These were:\n\n\nThe Forum Dialogues took place in the form of lectures, seminars, debates, symposium, international encounters, and other types of activities. The Dialogues were broken down into 8 continuous weeks of events, with more than 350 world level speakers and experts, and carried out in Themed Weeks. That meant, that during each particular week, all the Forum Dialogues were centered in one single topic, tackled from various angles and perspectives. There were 12 main topics, organized in 8 weeks of events.\n\nThe 8 Themed Weeks of Forum Dialogues were:\n\n\nThe 2007 Monterrey Forum did also present 16 grand exhibitions, that allowed the participants to experience the topics and concerns of the modern world via an interactive experience. Many of the Forum Exhibitions were planned and created only for this event. The exhibitions offered at the event were:\n\nThe 2007 Monterrey Forum provided the participants with the opportunity to experience a wide array of Cultural Expressions from all continents of the world. More than 1,000 single events ranging from 189 companies from more than 75 countries, were presented during the 80 days of the event. A promotional video for the Cultural Expressions offer can be viewed in the following link .\nSome of the most relevant shows and performers that were presented during the Forum included:\n\n\nThe 2007 Monterrey Forum also included a series of grand events and spaces for social participation, which took place during the course of the 80-day event.

Carson Mark\n\nJordan Carson Mark (July 6, 1913 – March 2, 1997) was a Canadian-American mathematician best known for his work on developing nuclear weapons for the United States at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Mark joined the Manhattan Project in 1945, and continued to work at Los Alamos under the leadership of Norris Bradbury after World War II ended. He became the leader of the Theoretical Division at the laboratory in 1947, a position he held until 1973. He oversaw the development of new weapons, including the hydrogen bomb in the 1950s. On the hydrogen bomb project he was able to bring together experts like Edward Teller, Stanislaw Ulam and Marshall Holloway despite their personal differences.\n\nIn July and August 1958, and again the following year, Mark was a scientific adviser to the United States delegation at the Conference of Experts on Detection of Nuclear Explosions. He served on the United States Air Force's Scientific Advisory Board, and its Foreign Weapons Evaluation Group. After he retired from Los Alamos in 1973 he served on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards, and was a consultant for the Nuclear Control Institute.\n\nJordan Carson Mark was born in Lindsay, Ontario, July 6, 1913. He had a brother, James, and five sisters, Margaret, Dorothy, Muriel, Frances and Tony. He received a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in mathematics and physics from the University of Western Ontario in 1935, and a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in mathematics from the University of Toronto in 1938, writing his thesis \"On the Modular Representations of the Group GLH(3,P)\" under the supervision of Richard Brauer.\n\nMark taught mathematics at the University of Manitoba, from 1938 until World War II, when he joined the Montreal Laboratory of the National Research Council of Canada in 1943. He came to the Los Alamos Laboratory in May 1945 as part of the British Mission to the Manhattan Project, although he remained a Canadian government employee. He remained at Los Alamos after the war ended, becoming head of its Theoretical Division in 1947, a position he remained in until he retired in 1973. He became a United States citizen in the 1950s.\n\nIn 1947 the Los Alamos Laboratory, under the leadership of Norris Bradbury, was much smaller than it had been during the war, because most of the wartime staff had returned to their universities and laboratories, but it was still the center of American nuclear weapons development, and the Theoretical Division was for many years the center of the laboratory. The Laboratory made great strides in improving the weapons, making them easier to manufacture, stockpile and handle. The Operation Sandstone tests in 1948 demonstrated that uranium-235 could be used in implosion-type nuclear weapons.\n\nMark played a key role in the development of thermonuclear weapons in the early 1950s. A crash program to develop the hydrogen bomb was approved by President Harry S. Truman in January 1950 at Edward Teller's urging before the laboratory had a workable design. This put the laboratory under great pressure. Hans Bethe recalled that \"There was a lot of controversy in Los Alamos in those days, and Carson always was imperturbable and stood in the middle of it and had a balanced judgment.\" When Stanislaw Ulam finally came up with a workable design, it was Mark that he approached first. Mark took the Ulam design to Bradbury, and they put the idea to Teller. \"Teller then completed and extended the invention,\" Bethe noted, \"so, in this case, Carson was the mediator between two people who really didn't like each other.\" \"Within an hour of Carson's ... remarks,\" Teller recalled, \"I knew how to move ahead\". The Teller-Ulam design would become that of all thermonuclear weapons.\nWhen it came to testing the design in the Ivy Mike nuclear test, Mark again had a crucial go-between role. Bradbury placed Marshall Holloway in charge, but Holloway and Teller did not get along. Mark later recalled that:\nThe Ivy Mike test was successful, obliterating an island in Enewetak Atoll in the Pacific on November 1, 1952.\n\nFrank Harlow, who joined the Theoretical Division in 1953, and was appointed as a group leader by Mark in 1959, noted that Mark took a personal interest in the computer systems, then a rapidly developing field. As most weapon research in the 1960s no longer involved the Theoretical Division, Mark branched out, sponsoring research into hydrodynamics, neutron physics and transport theory. He also supported Frederick Reines's research into neutrinos, for which Reines was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1995.\n\nIn July and August 1958, and again the following year, Mark was a scientific adviser to the United States delegation at the Conference of Experts on Detection of Nuclear Explosions. Delegates from Western and Eastern bloc countries discussed detection methods in the context of negotiations that eventually led to the Partial Test Ban Treaty, which banned most forms of nuclear testing. He was committed to preventing nuclear weapons proliferation. He spoke at Pugwash Conferences, and wrote a paper dispelling the myth that reactor-grade plutonium could not be used for nuclear weapons.\n\nMark was member of the American Mathematical Society and the American Physical Society, and served on the United States Air Force's Scientific Advisory Board, and its Foreign Weapons Evaluation Group. After he retired from Los Alamos in 1973 he served on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards, and was a consultant for the Nuclear Control Institute. One of his last papers was on Iraq's nuclear weapons capability.\n\nMark died in Los Alamos, New Mexico, on March 2, 1997, from complications related to a fall. He was survived by his wife Kathleen, daughters, Joan, Elizabeth Mark and Mary, and sons, Thomas, Graham and Christopher, his brother, James and sister Dorothy .\n\n"}

{"id": "2329340", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2329340", "title": "Binsey", "text": "Binsey\n\nBinsey is a hill on the northern edge of the Lake District in Cumbria, England. It is detached from the rest of the Lakeland hills, and thus provides a good spot to look out at the Northern and North Western Fells of the Lake District, as well as the coastal plain and, across the Solway Firth, Scotland. Snaefell on the Isle of Man is also visible on a clear day. It is the northernmost of the Wainwrights.\n\nBinsey stands on the otherwise low-level watershed separating the catchments of the Ellen to the north and the Derwent to the south. A slight ridge connects it to Great Cockup in the main massif of the Northern Fells, two miles to the south east. Binsey itself has a rounded form, but somehow manages to impress the eye more than the similar Great Mell Fell and Little Mell Fell.\n\nThe ‘pudding basin’ shape holds all around Binsey except to the north west where a ridge descends over Whitas Park to a depression containing the remains of a Roman fort. Beyond is St John's Hill (950 ft / 290 m) (called Caermote Hill in Wainwright’s Outlying Fells) which is topped by an earthwork called ‘The Battery’. Finally the ridge descends to the village of Bothel in the Ellen Valley.\n\nBinsey sends out a further spur to the east, culminating in the shapely top of Latrigg (1,030 ft)— not to be confused with Latrigg near Keswick. Beneath Latrigg is Over Water, a large tarn which was raised by damming in 1920 to provide drinking water for Wigton. The outflow of Over Water feeds the Ellen, as does the gloriously named Humble Jumble Gill which drains Binsey's northern flank.\n\nThe hill is largely grass and heather, with only one significant outcrop of rock, West Crag. Flanking the eastern slopes of the fell is a thin belt of mixed woodland and a further plantation sits below West Crag.\nThe summit is crowned by a tumulus whose stones have been raided to produce several small circular wind-shelters. There is also a modern cairn atop the tumulus and a trig point.\nRegarding the view, Wainwright stated: ‘...it is a most excellent station for appraising the Northern Fells as a preliminary to their exploration...it is a viewpoint of outstanding merit.’ Far to the south the Coniston Fells can be seen, almost 25 miles (40 km) away, while to the north the Solway Firth and the hills of Scotland are visible.\n\nA computer-generated summit panorama can be seen here. The furthest point visible on a clear day is the top of Slieve Donard in Mourne, 115 miles (185 km) away.\n\nThe hill is formed from volcanic rocks, namely various sub-units of the Eycott Volcanic Group, which consists of basaltic andesite, andesite and rhyolitic lavas. There are several small disused quarries to the east and north.\n\nThe hill can be climbed by several routes, perhaps most simply beginning in the south-east (Parking on the road between Binsey Lodge and Fell Side Farm), following a track to the summit. An alternative is along a lane from the A591 road, just north of Bewaldeth. From the top of the lane a loop to the left and behind a disused pit will enable the track across the summit to be picked up. Wainwright also lists a further route from High Ireby.\n"}

The open space used by the event is now a public park called the Parc del Fòrum.\n\nThe 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures was organized by Barcelona's city council, the regional government (the Generalitat de Catalunya), the Spanish National Government and UNESCO. It was conceived by its prime mover (Pasqual Maragall, then Mayor of Barcelona) as a way of promoting the city's burgeoning tourist industry in the wake of the 1992 Olympic Games, which were also held in Barcelona. The forum was also politically useful, given the mayor's earlier failure to deliver on a 1996 promise to secure an international exposition for the city.\n\nThe official aims of the 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures included support for peace, sustainable development, human rights and respect for diversity.\nThe forum hosted more than 40 international conventions (participants included Juan Antonio Samaranch, Mikhail Gorbachev, José Saramago, Felipe González, Rigoberta Menchú, Angelina Jolie, Robert McNamara, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, Lionel Jospin, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Romano Prodi and Salman Rushdie, among others), performances, markets, games, 423 concerts, 57 street performances, 44 theatre, dance and cabaret companies, 20 circus acts and over 20 exhibitions.\n\nJosep Acebillo was named Director for Architecture and Infrastructures of the Forum. The events were held at the eastern end of Avinguda Diagonal, a main cross-city artery. The seaside area was developed to house the event. It covered 30 hectares between the Barcelona Olympic port and Sant Adrià de Besòs, and culminated the urban regeneration programme started for the 1992 Olympics. The new site comprises a convention center, central plaza, parks, auditoriums, a new port and a Forum Building (designed by architectural firm Herzog & de Meuron).\n\nIn the framework of this Forum, the 4th Porto Alegre Forum of Local Authorities for Social Inclusion was held, which approved the Agenda 21 for culture on 8 May 2004.\n\nThe forum showed four thematic exhibitions, intended to achieve a renewal of ideas and attitudes toward the 21st century, by undertaking a careful analysis of cultural diversity, sustainable development and the conditions for peace:\n\n\nThe broad business concept shaping the forum was largely drawn up by ESADE. The link between the forum's commercial sponsors and the business school can readily be appreciated by comparing the companies listed on ESADE's Board of Trustees and those featured on the forum's web site. The strong business orientation apparent in the organization of the event gave rise to considerable local controversy in both the run-up to the forum and during the event itself. Several NGOs argued that they were frozen out of the decision-making process as the original Forum concept was radically altered to cater to corporate interests.\n\nThe campaign against the forum took many forms. One of the biggest demonstrations consisted of a seaborne invasion by anti-Forum protesters landing in makeshift rafts. This dealt a serious blow to the event's carefully groomed media image, particularly when Jordi Oliveras, the forum's Director-General was kicked by a demonstrator and Miquel Miró, the Director of Operations, was hit over the head by one of the forum's security guards. The \"invasion\" was widely reported in the press, despite the fact that major newspapers, radio and television stations had been co-opted into the forum under a special media consortium agreement.\n\nThe choice of some speakers at the forum's \"dialogues\" also sparked protest. An article in one of Catalonia's mass circulation dailies argued that Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada (former President of Bolivia and a keynote speaker at a Forum conference on development problems in South America) was a less than ideal choice. Lozada had a major stake in Bolivia's highly polluting Potosi mine and the previous year had taken a flight to Miami while the Bolivian military machine-gunned striking miners at home.\n\nThe forum also attracted the ire of demonstrators when the organizers refused to condemn the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The fact that several of the forum's sponsors had significant stakes in the arms industry further exacerbated protests.\n\nCritics pointed to the $2.3 billion price tag and commercial sponsorship by multinationals ENDESA, Nestlé, Coca-Cola, Telefónica, and Indra with dubious reputations in the Third World. Several groups also criticised the massive property and coastline destruction involved in building the forum site. In addition, many non-governmental organizations (NGOs), including Greenpeace and Amnesty International, withdrew from the forum project in protest. This may explain why the forum fell so far short of its projected attendance figures for the 141-day event. The forum expected 5 million visitors but the official final attendance figure was around 3.5 million. Independent estimates of attendance were significantly lower.\n\nThe central plaza and the open space surrounding forms a public area called Parc del Fòrum, and is now home to several massive events around the year, including the Primavera Sound Festival, Summercase, the Catalonia April Fair and the most popular concerts in La Mercè.\n\n\n"}

It inaugurated her \"Dangerous Angels\" series for young adults.\n\nThe narrative follows the adventures of the eponymous character Weetzie and her best friend Dirk, as well as their friends and relations. After being granted three wishes by a genie, Weetzie discovers that there are unexpected ramifications.\n\nThe story is set in an almost dream-like, heightened version of Los Angeles, aptly referred to as \"Shangri-L.A.\", in an indefinite time period evoking both the 1980s punk craze and the sophisticated glamor of 1950s Hollywood. Block describes issues such as blended families, premarital sex, homosexuality, and AIDS.\n\n\n\"Weetzie Bat\" won the 2009 Phoenix Award from the Children's Literature Association as the best English-language children's book that did not win a major award when it was originally published twenty years earlier. It is named for the mythical bird phoenix, which is reborn from its ashes, to suggest the book's rise from obscurity.\n\n\"Weetzie Bat\" has attracted controversy, including efforts to challenge or ban the book. For instance, in Texas, an organization critiqued Block's \"ideas and views on a variety of issues surrounding alternative lifestyles\" according to the B.G. Censorship Watch of American Libraries. \"Weetzie Bat\" describes gay marriage, children born out of wedlock, abortion, common-law marriage, and the AIDS epidemic, in language that makes it accessible to the pre-teen and early teen reader.\n\nCritics have countered by arguing that books like \"Weetzie Bat\" can provide a vital resource for lesbian, gay, transgender, and HIV-positive teens growing up in what is still largely a homophobic society. Michael Cart states \"Francesca Lia Block's \"Weetzie Bat\" (HarperCollins) is not only a classic of gay fiction but also one of the most memorable of all young adult novels.\" Another critic, Rebecca Platzner, noted that while the material is suggestive, the dialogue that it establishes about these depictions is vital to a developing young adult’s perspectives on difficult social issues.

The network serves as a companion cable channel to the NBCUniversal's flagship broadcast television network NBC and, to some extent, its Spanish language network Telemundo.\n\nAimed at Hispanic Adults between the ages of 18 and 49, the majority of its programming – which is tailored toward bilingual audiences – consists mainly of sports, scripted and reality series, and music programming. The network is headquartered in Miami Springs, Florida, while its master control operations are housed at the CNBC Global Headquarters in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, which serves as master control facilities for most of NBCUniversal's cable networks.\n\nThe network was founded by Empresas 1BC as GEMS Television. In 2001, the network was acquired by Telemundo and re-branded as mun2. The network was renamed NBC Universo in February 2015 to align it with Telemundo's sister English-language network NBC. , NBC Universo's programming was available to approximately 39.326 million pay television households (33.8% of cable, satellite and telco customers with at least one television set) in the United States.\n\nIn January 2017, the \"NBC\" brand was dropped from the network's on-air branding; the network is now simply titled \"Universo.\"\n\nThe network was launched on October 10, 1993 as GEMS Television, under founding owner Empresas 1BC. Cable television provider Cox Cable (now Cox Communications) acquired an ownership interest in the network the following year. The network's programming was aimed towards Latino women.\n\nIn 2001, GEMS was purchased by the Telemundo Communications Group (then a joint venture led by Sony Pictures Entertainment and Liberty Media), and revamped its programming format to target younger viewers; it was renamed mun2 (pronounced \"mundos\", meaning \"worlds,\" a pun on Telemundo and \"dos\", the Spanish word for the number \"2\"), a name chosen with the intent to reflect the \"two worlds\" that Latino Americans live in.\n\nIts initial lineup included programs from Telemundo's then sister company Columbia TriStar Television (now Sony Pictures Television), including repeats of Spanish language adaptations of \"Charlie's Angels\" (\"Angeles\") and \"The Dating Game\" that had aired on Telemundo as part of a failed programming revamp in 1998 in an attempt to counterprogram its rival, Univision. In addition, mun2 ran blocks of programming from the Home Shopping Network's Spanish language network Home Shopping Español (HSE) daily from 12:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time.\n\nThe network's most well known series was the candid reality series \"I Love Jenni\", which featured the life of banda/ranchero singer Jenni Rivera. After her death in a plane crash near Monterrey on December 9, 2012, the final season of the series earned the highest season average of any mun2 original program in its history, reaching a total of 5.5 million people across all of its telecasts during the season's 18-week run. It also ranked as the #1 show among all Hispanic cable networks in every key demographic during its Sunday night premiere. The series on-demand traffic increased, with over eight million video streams on mun2.tv, and over one million video on demand views.\n\nOn December 24, 2014, NBCUniversal announced that it would relaunch mun2 as NBC Universo on February 1, 2015, to coincide with the network's Spanish-language broadcast of Super Bowl XLIX. The relaunch of the network under the NBC name was designed to reflect the broadcaster's commitment to the Spanish-language television market.\n\nEight months prior to the relaunching announcement, at NBCUniversal Hispanic Enterprises and Content's upfront presentation at New York City's Frederick P. Rose Hall on May 13, 2014, the company announced that NBC Universo would be revamping its programming. The new line-up would increase its focus on sports coverage (which included the re-organization of Telemundo's sports division as Telemundo Deportes, a branch of the English-language NBC Sports division), primarily in preparation for its broadcast of the 2016 Summer Olympics and its assumption of Spanish-language cable rights to FIFA tournaments (such as the 2018 FIFA World Cup), which began with the 2015 FIFA U-20 World Cup. In January 2017, the \"NBC\" brand was dropped from the network's on-air branding; the network is now simply titled \"Universo.\"\n\nUniverso's programming consists of sports, original scripted drama series, reality series largely centered on popular Hispanic celebrities, movies, and music videos and music-related magazine programming; it also broadcasts series originating from Telemundo and networks operated as part of sister division NBCUniversal Cable, made up of original series from sister networks Syfy and USA Network, which incorporated Spanish language subtitles. To reflect its audience, Universo does not exclusively air programming in Spanish, airing a mix of shows presented in English, dubbed into Spanish and incorporating Spanish language subtitles, and programs presented interchangeably in both languages.\n\nMusic programming on the network during its existence as mun2 usually consisted of a mix of music video in English and Spanish from a variety of genres. In early April 2009, mun2 introduced two new music video-oriented shows called \"Indie y Nuevo\" (a program focusing more on independent artists, which has since been cancelled) and \"The Urban Tip\" (focusing on R&B, rap and reggaeton videos). In late December 2009, the network dropped its overnight block of infomercials that aired daily from 3:00 to 6:00 a.m. Eastern Time, and replaced it with additional music video programming either in the form of \"Reventon Mix\" (focusing on contemporary Latin party music) or \"Morning Breath\" (featuring a selection of videos from various artists). In January 2010, the network also began broadcasting a weekly block of feature films on Friday nights.\n\nThrough the Telemundo Deportes branch of NBC Sports Group, which superseded Telemundo's sports division Deportes Telemundo upon the current unit's creation within NBC Sports Group in May 2015, Universo broadcasts association football matches from select teams within Liga MX (consisting of home games from C.F. Pachuca), and holds the Spanish play-by-by rights to National Football League (NFL) events by way of NBC Sports' broadcasting agreements with the league.\n\nAs mun2, the network served as the English broadcaster of a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers match between the United States and Mexico on August 12, 2009. mun2 offered a free preview for the day of the match.\n\nAs a result of the former Deportes Telemundo reaching an agreement with FIFA to acquire the Spanish language rights to its tournaments on October 22, 2011, mun2 gained the Spanish language cable television rights to select games to the FIFA Men's and Women's World Cup. The deal, which began with the 2015 Women's World Cup and runs through 2026, includes rights to associated FIFA-sanctioned tournaments (including the Men's U-20 and U-17 World Cups, and the Men's Beach Soccer World Cup); the deal was extended on February 12, 2015, to include rights to the 2026 FIFA World Cup.\n\nIn January 2010, NBCUniversal announced that mun2 would continue to broadcast Mexican soccer games (under the brand \"Fútbol Mexicano\"); most of the games aired to date usually consisted English language simulcasts of Telemundo's \"Fútbol Estelar\" broadcasts. In February 2010, mun2 debuted \"mun2 Sports Arena\", a half-hour sports news program that aired on Sunday evenings. Through NBC Sports' contract to televise the Premier League, the network began airing Spanish-language simulcasts of select matches broadcast in English on NBCSN with the 2013–14 season.\n\nOn July 23, 2013, NBC Sports announced that Telemundo and mun2 would broadcast NASCAR events in Spanish in beginning in 2015, as part of NBC's new rights deal to cover the second half of the Cup Series and Xfinity Series season. As a prelude to the new contract, mun2 broadcast the opening event of the Toyota Series—NASCAR's Mexican series, at Phoenix International Raceway during the weekend of The Profit on CNBC 500 on February 28, 2014.\n\nThrough NBC's rights agreement with the NFL, mun2 carried its first Spanish simulcast of an NFL game, airing a Thanksgiving matchup between the Seattle Seahawks and San Francisco 49ers on November 27, 2014; the re-branded channel has served as the Spanish-language broadcaster of the Super Bowl during years NBC holds the rights. NBC had proposed using Telemundo to act as a Spanish-language simulcast partner for years following its 2001 purchase of the network, but this did not occur until the Premier League agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2329484", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2329484", "title": "Yuli Daniel", "text": "Yuli Daniel\n\nYuli Markovich Daniel (; 15 November 1925 — 30 December 1988) was a Russian writer and Soviet dissident known as a defendant in the Sinyavsky–Daniel trial in 1966.\n\nDaniel wrote and translated works of stories and poetry critical of Soviet society under the pseudonyms Nikolay Arzhak () and Yu. Petrov () published in the West to avoid censorship in the Soviet Union. Daniel and Andrei Sinyavsky were convicted of Anti-Soviet agitation in a show trial, becoming the first Soviet writers convicted solely for their works and for fiction, serving five years at a Gulag camp and prison.\n\nYuli Daniel was born on 15 November 1925 in Moscow, Soviet Union, the son of the Russian Jewish Yiddish playwright M. Daniel (Mark Naumovich Meyerovich, ). In 1942, the 17-year-old Daniel lied about his age and volunteered to serve on the 2nd Ukrainian Front and the 3rd Belorussian Front during Eastern Front of World War II. In 1944, Daniel was critically wounded in his legs and was demobilized from the Red Army. In 1950, Daniel graduated from Moscow Pedagogical Institute (now Moscow State Regional University), and went to work as a schoolteacher in Kaluga and Moscow.\n\nDaniel also published translations of verse from a variety of languages, and like his friend Andrei Sinyavsky, wrote topical stories and novellas which were sometimes satirical or critical of Soviet society but naturally rejected for publication by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) during a time of extreme censorship in the Soviet Union. Daniel and Sinyavsky smuggled their works out of the Soviet Union as \"samizdat\" to France to be published under pseudonyms. Daniel married Larisa Bogoraz, who later also became a famous Soviet dissident.\n\nDaniel's work \"Moscow Speaking\", published in 1959 under the pseudonym Nikolai Arzhak, caught the attention of the KGB, the main security agency and secret police of the Soviet Union. The KGB began investigating Daniel and Sinyavsky's dissident works being published in the West, and soon linked their pseudonyms to their real identities. Daniel and Sinyavsky were placed under constant surveillance and investigation by the KGB for several years.\n\nIn September 1965, Daniel and Sinyavsky were arrested and tried in the infamous Sinyavsky-Daniel trial for their literary works published abroad. The Soviet prosecution could not charge Daniel and Sinyavsky for publishing material abroad or using pseudonyms as both were legal under Soviet Law, instead they were charged with the offense of anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda under Article 70 of the RSFSR Criminal Code.\nBoth writers entered a plea of not guilty, which was unusual for defendants in Soviet show trials. On February 14, 1966, Daniel was sentenced to five years of hard labor for \"anti-Soviet activity\" while Sinyavsky was sentenced to seven years.\n\nIn 1967, Andrei Sakharov appealed on behalf of Daniel directly to Yuri Andropov, at the time Chairman of the KGB. Sakharov was told that both Daniel and Sinyavsky would be released under a general amnesty on the fiftieth anniversary of the October revolution, but this turned out to be false as the amnesty did not apply to political prisoners. Daniel spent four years of captivity at the Dubravlag, a Gulag camp in Mordovia, and one year in Vladimir Prison. \n\nDaniel was released and refused to emigrate, as was customary among Soviet dissidents, and lived in Kaluga before moving to Moscow. \n\nAccording to Fred Coleman, \"Historians now have no difficulty pinpointing the birth of the modern Soviet dissident movement. It began in February 1966 with the trial of Andrei Sinyavsky and Yuli Daniel, two Russian writers who ridiculed the Communist regime in satires smuggled abroad and published under pen names. They didn't realize at the time that they were starting a movement that would help end Communist rule.\"\n\nDaniel and Sinyavsky did not intend to oppose the Soviet Union. Daniel was genuinely worried about a resurgence of the Cult of Personality under Nikita Khrushchev, which inspired his story \"This is Moscow Speaking\", while Sinyavsky affirmed that he believed socialism was the way forward but that the methods employed were at times erroneous. Shortly before Daniel's death, Bulat Okudzhava acknowledged that some translations published under his name had in fact been ghostwritten by Daniel, because he was featured on a blacklist of authors banned from being published in the Soviet Union.\n\nDaniel died on 30 December 1988, and Sinyavsky and his wife Maria Rozanova immediately flew to his funeral from France, where they had emigrated in 1973 after Sinyavsky's release. Daniel was buried in Vagankovo Cemetery, a popular burial place in Moscow for members of the arts community.\n\n\n"}

It was used in Manchukuo against the ill-prepared National Revolutionary Army of the Republic of China and against local warlord forces with considerable psychological effect. However, its ignition system based on a heated electrical wire had reliability issues under cold weather conditions which led to a redesign designated the Type 100 flamethrower in 1940. Both types remained in service during World War II.\n\nBoth the Type 93 and Type 100 consisted of a fuel unit, fuel hose, and flame gun. A modification in the design of the flame gun is the only difference between the two types.\nThe fuel unit consisted of three long, diameter cylinders: two outer fuel cylinders and a central nitrogen pressure cylinder. The total fuel capacity was 12.3 liters. Fuel was a mixture of gasoline and tar. Pressure was controlled by a manually operated needle valve, one on the top of each of the two fuel cylinders. This tank assembly was fitted with straps to permit it to be carried on the operator's back like an infantry pack.\n\nThe fuel hose was made of reinforced rubber tubing, with brass fittings on both ends. The flame gun, three to four feet long, was a diameter tube with a fuel ejection handle located near the hose connection, and a 6 mm (1/4-inch) nozzle with the firing mechanism attached to the other end.\n\nFuel (in the Type 100) was ignited by a blank cartridge fired from a revolver mechanism in the flame gun, which held ten rounds. The fuel ejection handle fired a cartridge when it opened the fuel ejection valve. When the handle was returned to its closed position parallel to the tube, the flow of fuel stopped, and the magazine revolved to place a new cartridge in the firing position. The duration of a continuous discharge was 10 to 12 seconds with a maximum range of 22 to 27 meters.\n\nFlamethrowers were assigned to engineering regiments within each Japanese infantry division. A typical engineering regiment would be equipped with between six and twenty flamethrowers, which were operated by a designated flamethrower company. The Type 100 Flamethrower was primarily used in the early stages of the Pacific War, mostly in the Dutch East Indies, Burma and the Philippines. Type 100-equipped Japanese paratroopers participated in the Battle of Palembang in 1942. There was little need for flamethrowers later in the war since Japan was on the defensive and had few opportunities to attack enemy fortifications. In later stages of the war, the Japanese army attempted to use the Type 100 flamethrower as an anti-tank weapon, largely due to lack of any effective anti-tank guns, and with some success.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2329511", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2329511", "title": "Pretty Noose", "text": "Pretty Noose\n\n\"Pretty Noose\" is a song by the American rock band Soundgarden. Written by the band's frontman, Chris Cornell, \"Pretty Noose\" was released in March 1996 as the first single from the band's fourth studio album, \"Down on the Upside\" (1996). The song reached number two on the \"Billboard\" Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song was included on Soundgarden's 1997 greatest hits album, \"A-Sides\".\n\n\"Pretty Noose\" was written by frontman Chris Cornell. Drummer Matt Cameron said of the song,\nThat song for me was kind of interesting, because we were at the phase where we were just going to demo tunes. So I learned the tune and recorded it, and we ended up using that take. When we recorded that, I had walked to the studio (in Seattle) and my legs were really tired. But to make a long story short, I was trying to get a walking feel on the drum part. So it probably has a little weird shuffle to it probably from that walk that I took to the studio that day.\n\n\"Pretty Noose\" has a distinctive opening wah-wah guitar riff. The song was written in C-G-C-G-G-E tuning, which the bass guitarist Ben Shepherd first introduced to the band with the song \"Head Down\" from \"Superunknown\".\n\nAccording to Cornell, \"Pretty Noose\" is about \"an attractively packaged bad idea ... something that seems great at first and then comes back to bite you.\" Frank Kozik, the director of the song's music video, interpreted the song as \"your average bad-girlfriend experience\", an interpretation which Cornell agreed with.\n\n\"Pretty Noose\" appeared on \"Billboard\" magazine's Hot 100 Airplay chart, reaching the top 40. The song peaked at number four on the \"Billboard\" Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and number two on the \"Billboard\" Modern Rock Tracks chart. It is notable for being the only song by the band to chart higher on the Modern Rock Tracks chart than on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. At the 1997 Grammy Awards, \"Pretty Noose\" received a nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called the song \"updated, muscular prog rock\".\n\nOutside the United States, the single was released in the United Kingdom. In Canada, the song reached the top 50 on the Canadian Singles Chart, and later it charted on the Alternative Top 30 chart where it reached number one and became Soundgarden's first single to top that chart. \"Pretty Noose\" also reached number four on the Canadian Year End Alternative Top 50. \"Pretty Noose\" reached the UK Top 20 and was the last single from the album which charted in the UK Top 20. \"Pretty Noose\" peaked at number 14 in Australia. It reached the top 20 in New Zealand and was a top ten success in Finland.\n\n\"Pretty Noose\" is available as downloadable content for the \"Rock Band\" series as a master track.\n\nThe song was upgraded and made available to download on July 19, 2011, for use in the \"Rock Band 3\" music gaming platform in both Basic rhythm, and PRO mode which takes advantage of the use of a real guitar / bass guitar, along with standard MIDI-compatible electronic drum kits / keyboards in addition to up to three-part harmony vocals.\n\nThe music video for \"Pretty Noose\" was directed by Frank Kozik. Kozik had previously been known for his work on posters and album art. The video blends animation with various scenes of the band members in a bar, an exotic dancer, Cameron riding a motorcycle, Shepherd being arrested, a tattoo parlor, and Cornell in a bedroom. In the original version of the video, Cornell is shown killing a woman. The video was released in May 1996.\n\nCornell said of the music video,\nIt's unlike anything else we've ever done ... In fact, I think it's unlike anything else anyone has ever done. Working with someone like Frank was really interesting because his approach was so fresh—he didn't know the rules that he's supposed to play under. He made the video what it is. It's really interesting and colorful. It's the kind of video that's still fun to look at after you've seen it a few times. That was very important to us. At this point in our lives, part of the challenge is to try new things, not to fall into the pattern of playing it safe. We did that on the video, and we did that on the album too.\n\nMTV refused to show the full video, as it ends with an apparent murder. MuchMusic was given a revised version for its channel. Kozik said that the video was censored because it was \"too heavy\" for the \"dipshits at MTV\". He added, \"They got a dead girl in that lame Stabbing Westward video so I don't understand their problem.\"\n\nAn alternative international version of the music video for \"Pretty Noose\" was released. This version was directed by Henry Shepherd (bass guitarist Ben Shepherd's brother), who had previously co-directed the \"My Wave\" music video for the band. The video simply features the band performing the song live in a studio. The footage is taken from a pre-release European promotional kit for \"Down on the Upside\". The video was released to areas outside the United States, but began to be shown in the United States after Kozik's version debuted.\n\n\"Pretty Noose\" was performed on \"Saturday Night Live\" in May 1996 in support of \"Down on the Upside\". A recording of this performance can be found on the band's 2010 compilation album \"Telephantasm\".\n\nAll songs written by Chris Cornell, except where noted.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n"}

During World War II, he served as a private in the Army. Upon returning, he wanted to become a doctor, until he met entertainer Al Jolson. According to Harmon's autobiography, \"The Man Behind the Nose\", Jolson told him, \"Being a doctor of medicine is honorable, but you'll touch so many more lives as a doctor of laughter!\" Harmon instead attended the University of Southern California, where he majored in theater and performed in the Spirit of Troy marching band.\n\nIn 1956, Harmon purchased the licensing rights to the Bozo character from Capitol Records. Harmon marketed the Bozo property aggressively. By the late 1960s, Harmon had licensed local Bozo TV shows in nearly every major U.S. market, as well as in other countries. Harmon also produced a series of Bozo animated cartoons intended to be shown with the live-action show, performing Bozo's voice himself.\n\nHarmon's animation studio also produced eighteen Popeye The Sailor cartoons in 1960 as part of a larger TV syndication package.\n\nIn 1961, Harmon bought the merchandising rights to the likenesses of Laurel and Hardy. Five years later, he promoted a Laurel and Hardy TV cartoon short series called A Laurel and Hardy Cartoon, the animation work on which was done by Hanna-Barbera Productions. Harmon performed Stanley Laurel's voice in that same series along with Jim MacGeorge in Oliver Hardy's voice. In 1999, Harmon co-produced and co-directed a live-action feature, \"The All New Adventures of Laurel & Hardy in For Love or Mummy\", starring Bronson Pinchot as Laurel and Gailard Sartain as Hardy. Intended as the first of a series, it was released direct-to-video and no sequels were made.\n\nIn 1984 Harmon stood as a write-in candidate in the presidential election with the aim of encouraging people to vote. Only Arizona reported the number of votes he received, which for this state was 21. The total number of write-in votes across the United States was 19,315 or 0.02 percent of the vote. There was a 53.27% turnout.\n\nOn New Year's Day 1996, Harmon dressed as Bozo for the first time in 10 years, appearing in the Rose Parade in Pasadena, California.\n\nHe wrote an autobiography titled \"The Man Behind the Nose: Assassins, Astronauts, Cannibals, and Other Stupendous Tales\", which was published in 2010 by Igniter Books. One of Harmon's alleged ex-wives disputed the veracity of the memoir.\n\nOn July 3, 2008, Harmon died of congestive heart failure in his home in Los Angeles, California.

They are brain signals evoked by sensory stimulation, but usually buried by the ongoing brain activity. Repeating the stimulus multiple times and averaging the signals reduces the uncorrelated ongoing activity and reveals the evoked field. Evoked fields are the magnetoencephalographic equivalent to evoked potentials, which are part of the electroencephalogram.\n\nAn auditory evoked field (AEF) is a form neural activity that is induced by an auditory stimulus and recorded via magnetoencephalography, which is an equivalent of auditory evoked potential (AEP) recorded by electroencephalography. The advantage of AEF over AEP is the powerful spatial resolution provided by magnetic field recording, which AEP lacks. Thus, researchers using AEF often deals with the global responses of the whole brain at the cortical level while focusing on the role of the auditory pathway. The common applications of AEF are prenatal and neonatal hearing screening, cortical pitch perception, language comprehension, and attention.\n\nThe main source of the auditory evoked field is the auditory cortex and the association cortices. The earliest cortical components of AEF is equivalent to the \"middle latency response\" (MLR) of the EEG evoked potential, called the \"middle latency auditory evoked field\" (MLAEF), which occurs at 30 to 50 ms after the stimulus onset. M30 and M50, occurring at 30 and 50 ms after the stimulus onset, correspond to the \"Pa\" and \"Pb\" peaks of MLR. The M50 response was often used to study the correlation of aging and hearing loss. Research has shown that the amplitude of contralateral M50 enlarges with age.\n\nAt 100 ms after stimulus onset occurs the most prominent response in the late latency range, the M100, which corresponds to the N1 peak of the \"auditory long latency response\" (ALR) potential. M100 is the most widely used magnetic field response clinically. In 2007, Lütkenhöner \"et al.\" demonstrated that M100 can be applied to estimate hearing threshold to a higher degree of accuracy.\n\nLonger latency responses after 100 ms are referred as event-related field (ERF) that includes M150, M200, M300 (equivalent of P300), and M400.\n\n"}

In a 30-year political career, served as a Teachta Dála (TD) and Member of the European Parliament (MEP) and also as a Senator.\n\nMark Killilea was born in Tuam, County Galway in 1939. He married Anne Severs in 1966. His father Mark Killilea Snr was a Fianna Fáil TD and a founder-member of the party. Killilea Jnr was educated locally and first held political office in August 1969, when he was elected to Seanad Éireann on the Labour Panel and re-elected in 1973. He failed to be elected to Dáil Éireann on his first attempt when he stood in Galway North-East at the 1973 general election, but at the 1977 general election he won a seat in the new Galway East constituency. The election was a landslide for Fianna Fáil and in particular showed the popularity of the party leader Jack Lynch.\n\nHowever, after just two years Lynch's fortunes had changed. Along with Jackie Fahey, Tom McEllistrim, Seán Doherty and Albert Reynolds, Killilea was one of the so-called \"gang of five\" that lobbied the parliamentary party for support for Charles Haughey in the event of the retirement of Lynch's retirement. This group was determined that the leadership should not pass to George Colley, Lynch's apparent successor. Haughey went on to win the leadership contest and become Taoiseach in December 1979.\n\nKillilea's loyalty was rewarded by being appointed Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. He held this position until Fianna Fáil's defeat at the 1981 general election—at which, after changes in constituency boundaries, he switched to the Galway West constituency. He lost his Dáil seat there at the February 1982 general election, but was elected to the Seanad where he served until 1987. After Ray MacSharry retired from the European Parliament in 1987, Killilea was appointed as his replacement in the Connacht–Ulster constituency. Killilea held the seat at the 1989 and 1994 European Parliament elections, and was elected as Quaestor by his fellow MEPs in 1996. He retired from politics at the 1999 European Parliament election.\n"}

{"id": "2329564", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2329564", "title": "NORAID", "text": "NORAID\n\nNORAID, officially the Irish Northern Aid Committee, is an Irish American membership organization founded after the start of the Troubles in Northern Ireland in 1969. The organization states its mission is to aid in the creation of a United Ireland in the spirit of the 1916 Easter Proclamation and to support the Northern Ireland Peace process. During The Troubles NORAID was known for raising funds for the Provisional Irish Republican Army and other Nationalist community groups. NORAID runs a newsletter titled \"The Irish People\" which provides analysis and coverage of ongoing events in Northern Ireland. \n\nNORAID was organized and directed by Michael Flannery, who in the 1920s was a member of the IRA North Tipperary Brigade.\n\nUnionist politicians and the British, Irish and United States governments have accused NORAID of being a front for the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), and that it was involved in fundraising for IRA arms importation from North America since the early 1970s. This accusation has always been denied by NORAID. NORAID's former leader, Martin Galvin, was banned from the United Kingdom in the 1980s. The charge was also disputed by historian Ed Moloney who stated that the funds raised by NORAID went largely to the families of IRA volunteers, and that Clan na Gael was the principal financial backer of the Provisional IRA.\n\nBy the late 1980s, NORAID was a loose federation of local branches centred on fundraising. Sinn Féin, the political party associated with the IRA, wanted NORAID to expand its activities. At the end of 1988, NORAID agreed to try to broaden its appeal and its executive committee was expanded. Sinn Féin sent an organizer to the United States, and more time and money was devoted to lobbying and propaganda.\n\nThen-president Pat O'Connell said \"Americans are fed up with their own nation's politics. They sure as hell don't want to get involved in Irish politics. They only want to give money for the prisoners and their families, not for political lobbying.\" O'Connell subsequently opened a separate NORAID office in the Bronx.\n\nA letter later published in New York's two Irish weeklies charged that under Martin Galvin and others, NORAID was \"being steered in a direction toward politics and away from its original humanitarian objectives.\" The first name among forty-one signers was Michael Flannery, who in 1986 had quietly resigned from NORAID. Galvin joined Noraid in the early 1970s, and became the committee's publicity director and editor of its weekly newspaper, \"The Irish People.\" He later joined the group's board of directors. Galvin split with Sinn Féin in the mid-1990s over the direction of the Northern Ireland peace process.\n\nNORAID has in the past supported \"Project Children\", a New York-based organization founded in 1975, to provide summer vacations for children from Northern Ireland away from sectarian strife.\n\nIn 1994, Sinn Féin was de-listed as a foreign terrorist organization by the US State Department after the start of peace efforts in Northern Ireland. NORAID was supportive of the peace process and the subsequent Good Friday Agreement and is nowadays highly supportive of Sinn Féin.\n\n<poem>Irish Northern Aid is an American based membership organization that supports through peaceful means, the establishment of a socialist and democratic 32-county Ireland.\nOur Strategy: To develop a broad coalition of supporters for Irish Unity through organizing and educating the public, our members, political leaders, and the media.\nTo support the current Peace Process, including the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement which was endorsed by the vast majority of the Irish people.\nTo support a process of National reconciliation and equality for all the citizens of Ireland.\nMembership: In keeping with the principles of the 1916 Proclamation, Irish Northern Aid is open to anyone who shares these values.</poem>\nIn May 1981, the United States Department of Justice won a court case forcing NORAID to register the Provisional Irish Republican Army as its \"foreign principal\" under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. In his decision, U.S. District Judge Charles S. Haight, Jr. wrote: \"The uncontroverted evidence is that [Noraid] is an agent of the IRA, providing money and services for other than relief purposes.\" NORAID lawyers appealed the decision but lost.\n\nA compromise was reached between federal attorneys and NORAID, allowing it to include with its filings a written statement expressing that the document had been signed under duress and that NORAID maintained that the IRA was not its \"foreign principal\". NORAID resumed filing its financial returns in July 1984.\n\n\n"}

Glen Christie had a population of approximately 80 and was built around a Quarry. Ray is the son of Dorothy and George \"Sonny\" Scapinello. He has one older sister, Dianne, and one younger brother, Dougie. Scapinello played hockey growing up and earned the nickname \"Scampy\" due to his small stature and exceptional skating ability. Despite being a skilled skater, Scapinello never made it into professional hockey, and had stopped playing by the age of 21.\n\nDuring the late 1960s, Scapinello joined the Guelph Referees Association and began officiating games for them while he was working for General Electric. He was invited to the NHL rookie official's camp in 1970 and despite not making the cut, he was invited to officiate in the Ontario Hockey Association. Scapinello spent one year officiating in the OHA before he was again invited to the NHL rookie official's camp. This time he made the cut and at age 24, was hired into the NHL in 1971. Scapinello officiated his first NHL game on October 17, 1971. It took place in Buffalo between the Buffalo Sabres and the Minnesota North Stars.\n\nIn the spring of 1980, Scapinello officiated his first Stanley Cup Finals. This was one of a total of 21 he officiated during his career. It's unknown what number he wore in the 1994-95 NHL season, when the nameplates were changed back to numbers. In 1998, Scapinello was chosen as one of 4 officials to participate in the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. Despite being unprepared, Scapinello and the other officials managed to learn the differences in rules between olympic ice hockey and ice hockey in the NHL. One of the biggest differences for the officials proved to be the rule that required all officials to wear protective helmets while on ice, and this marked the only time in Scapinello's career that he wore one (he was included under a grandfather clause in the NHL; he retired before the clause was revoked and helmets became mandatory for all officials in the 2006-07 season).\n\nScapinello's final regular season NHL game came on April 2, 2004, a game held in Buffalo between the Buffalo Sabres and the Toronto Maple Leafs. Scapinello chose this to be his final game as he wanted to end his career in the same place he started it. Although this was his final regular season game, he participated in the 2004 Stanley Cup Playoffs.\n\nScapinello finally did retire in June 2004 after 33 seasons in the NHL as a linesman. His career includes 2,500 regular season games, 426 playoff games, the Canada Cup, the 1996 World Cup of Hockey, three All-Star games, including the 1979 Challenge Cup and Rendez-vous '87, and 21 Stanley Cup Finals. Of these feats, the most impressive is the fact that he never once missed a game due to injury or illness.\n\nAfter retiring, Scapinello took a part-time job as an officials supervisor in two amateur hockey leagues, the Ontario Hockey League in Canada and the Central Hockey League in the United States. He has also instructed at summer officiating camps, including the North American School of Officiating.\n\nRay is married to Maureen and they have one child, Ryan.\n\nOn June 17, 2008, it was announced that Scapinello would be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame as an on-ice official.\n"}

In a surprise attack, Habsburg Imperial forces routed the Ottoman army which was crossing the river. At the cost of a few hundred losses, the Habsburg forces inflicted thousands of casualties on the Ottomans, dispersed the remainder and captured the Ottoman treasure. As an immediate consequence, the Ottoman Empire lost control over Banat, while in the long run, the Habsburg victory at Zenta was the last decisive step that forced the Ottoman Empire into the Treaty of Karlowitz (1699), ending the Ottoman control of large parts of Central Europe.\n\nAfter the relief of the Habsburg capital in the Battle of Vienna of 1683, Austria enjoyed great success and by 1688 Belgrade and most of the Pannonian Plain was occupied by the Habsburgs. But as the war with the French demanded more troops, and the new grand vizier reorganized and reinvigorated the Ottoman Army, the success ended. Belgrade was recaptured by the Ottomans in 1690 and the following year’s campaign was relatively indecisive. Subsequently, the Ottoman army commanded by Sultan Mustafa II won three consecutive victories at the Battle of Lugos (1695), Battle of Ulaş (1696), and Battle of Cenei (1696).\n\nAt the Battle of Zenta in 1697, the Austrians would be led by Prince Eugene of Savoy in his first independent command; it was to be the first of a series of notable campaigns for the Prince.\n\nPrince Eugene was made commander in chief of the Army in the newly conquered Pannonian Plain on 5 July 1697. His army consisted of 70,000 men at full strength of whom only 35,000 were ready for battle. As the war chest was empty, Eugene had to borrow money in order to pay wages and to create a working medical service.\n\nThe Habsburg Army consisted of German, Austrian, and Hungarian infantry and cavalry forces (approx. 7,000 soldiers). Thanks to Palatine Paul Eszterházy, the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary contributed to Ottoman-Habsburg wars with 20,000 soldiers. Serb light cavalry and Serbian Militia conscripts also took part in the coalition.\n\nWhen news arrived that the Sultan and his army were in Belgrade, Eugene decided to concentrate all his available troops from Upper Hungary and Transylvania and started to move his troops towards Petrovaradin. After the concentration took place, Eugene had an Imperial army of 50,000 to 55,000 men to face the Ottomans. On 18 July, in the village of Kolut, Eugene held a military review of his forces. Soon he left with forces to Petrovaradin via Sombor. During August, Eugene offered battle in the neighborhood of the fortress of Petrovaradin but the Ottomans, attempting to start a siege, refused to engage in battle. In September the Ottomans moved north in an attempt to capture the fortress of Szeged and the Imperial army followed.\n\nThere were few Kuruc cavalries in the Ottoman army under Imre Thököly, however most of them fought alongside the Austrians. Thököly was in charge of the Ottoman cavalry in battle.\n\nAfter the capture of Cafer Pasha (Djafer Pasha) by the imperial cavalry, the plan for the siege of Szeged was abandoned and the Sultan decided to return to winter quarters near Timișoara. When Eugene learned of these movements, he decided to force a battle.\n\nOn 11 September 1697, the Ottoman army began to ford the river Tisa (Tisza, Theiss) near Zenta (Senta), unaware that the Imperial Army was nearby. The Imperial army was able to surprise and attack the Ottoman forces while they were in the process of crossing the river. After an artillery bombardment, many Imperial Dragoon regiments dismounted and proceeded to the moat encircling and engaging the Ottoman camp. Ottoman troops behind the entrenchments retreated in confusion to the bridge, which was now overcrowded. Austrian artillery targeted the Ottoman troops and killed many of them. The left flank of the Imperial army attacked, penetrating between the Ottoman left flank and the bridge, cutting off their retreat. At the same time, Imperial forces attacked from the front and, after engaging in close-quarter fighting, broke through the trenches surrounding the Ottoman camp. Barely a thousand Ottoman soldiers escaped. More than 10,000 Ottoman troops drowned in the Tisa river. Up to 20,000 Ottoman soldiers were killed on the battlefield.\n\nThe battle resulted in a spectacular victory for Austria; at the cost of 500 men they had inflicted the loss of thousands of men, 87 cannons, the royal treasure chest and the state seal of the Ottoman Empire. According to \"Prinz Eugen\" (1960, biography) by Alexander Lernet-Holenia, the startled Austrians even captured a train of camels. The main Ottoman army was scattered and the Austrians gained complete freedom of action in Bosnia, where Sarajevo was sacked.\n\nBy the terms of the Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699, the Austrians forced the sultan Mustafa II to make peace with the Emperor, and to return all the lands of the Kingdom of Hungary (except for Banat and a small chunk of Eastern Slavonia) conquered by the Ottomans in the previous 150 years. The returned territories were partly reintegrated into the Kingdom of Hungary, and partly organized as separate entities within the Habsburg Monarchy such as the Principality of Transylvania, and the Military Frontier.\n\n\n"}

A veteran of numerous Minneapolis rock bands, Dickerson answered Prince's call for a touring musician in the \"Twin Cities Reader\", a local entertainment paper, in 1979. After a 15-minute audition in the back of Del's Tire Mart, Dickerson was picked as guitarist. In 1980 when off the road for Christmas break, Dickerson had a profound conversion experience and became a born-again Christian. Afterwards, performing songs with sexual themes began to trouble his conscience. Even though Dickerson's and Prince's popularity were growing, he desired more and more to quit the band. He contributed songs for Prince's side projects, writing \"He's So Dull\" for Vanity 6, and co-writing \"Wild And Loose\", \"After Hi School\", and \"Cool\" for the Time. Dickerson contributed vocals to \"Little Red Corvette\" and \"1999\" on the \"1999\" album, as well as the guitar solo for \"Little Red Corvette\" that ranked number 64 on \"Guitar World's list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Solos.\n\nFollowing the \"1999\" tour, Dickerson left the band to pursue other options. He was replaced by Wendy Melvoin.\n\nAfter leaving the Revolution, Dickerson formed his own short-lived band, the Modernaires, and toured in support of Billy Idol on his 1984 \"Rebel Yell\" tour, frequently joining Idol onstage. Dickerson appeared in the movie \"Purple Rain\" with the Modernaires, but their song was not released as a single nor on the \"Purple Rain\" soundtrack. A solo recording deal failed to materialize, and in 1987 Dickerson relocated to Nashville to back singer Judson Spence. He also kept busy with session work and producing other artists.\n\nIn 1990, Dickerson was named vice president of A&R with the CCM label Starsong Communications. Four years later he founded his own label, Absolute Records, a Christian rock record company. Artists on his label included Squirt, These 5 Down and Metropolis aka Metropolis America. He released a solo album in the late 1990s entitled \"Oneman\", and then a book, \"My Time with Prince-Confessions of a Former Revolutionary\", which spans from his audition in 1978 until leaving Prince in 1983.\n\nIn 2005, Dickerson released a double CD retrospective collection of his work from 1982 to 1987, including the complete version of the \"classic\" Modernaire. Taken from the film \"Purple Rain\" and featuring Prince on guitars, keyboards and backing vocals, this track was released on vinyl in 2008 by the UK label, Citinite.\n\nAlso in 2005, a three-CD set was released, \"Rock of Ages – Where Classic Hymns Meet Classic Rock!\". This was produced, arranged, recorded and mixed by Dickerson and features powerful guitar riffs. It presented 32 well-known hymns in a rock format, with Dickerson playing many of the instruments. Joining Dickerson on this project was his son, Jordan Dickerson, who contributed drums to many of the tracks and bass guitar on some. Jordan also arranged \"Agnus Dei\".\n\nCurrently, Dickerson manages record label and branding companies Pavilion Entertainment and Pavilion Synergies in Nashville. In 2012 he joined his former bandmates at a full-scale Revolution reunion which was set up by drummer Robert \"Bobby Z.\" Rivkin to raise money and awareness for heart disease; Prince attended the performances but did not participate.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2329621", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2329621", "title": "Cedric Benson", "text": "Cedric Benson\n\nCedric Myron Benson (December 28, 1982 – August 17, 2019) was an American professional football player who was a running back in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Texas Longhorns and was recognized as a consensus All-American. He was selected by the Chicago Bears with the fourth overall pick in the 2005 NFL Draft and also played for the Cincinnati Bengals and Green Bay Packers.\n\nBenson began to emerge as a football stand-out in the eighth grade while attending Abell Junior High School in Midland, Texas, under Coach Chris McKinney. Benson attended Robert E. Lee High School in Midland, Texas, and finished his high school playing career with 8,423 rushing yards (the most in Texas 5A history, largest classification at the time, and the fourth most in Texas high school football history). He led his team to three consecutive State Championships, and rushed for a total of 15 touchdowns in the three championship games. Benson rushed for more than 1,900 yards in only 9 games. He rushed for over 3,500 yards (51 touchdowns) his junior year in an undefeated State and National Championship season. He was the first high school player ever to make the cover of Dave Campbell's Texas Football annual magazine. Benson was also a center fielder on the baseball team. As a senior, in District 4-5A games, he hit .361 with 4 home runs and 14 RBIs.\n\nBenson was drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 12th round (370th overall) of the 2001 MLB Draft. While Benson did not play in the major leagues, he spent his time with the Dodgers playing in their summer league at Vero Beach. He also played with the Gulf Coast League Dodgers. In 25 at-bats he had 5 hits, 1 run, 3 doubles, 2 triples, and 2 RBIs.\n\nBenson attended the University of Texas at Austin, where he was a four-year starter for the Longhorns football team. As a senior in 2004, he received the Doak Walker Award as the nation's top running back and was recognized as a consensus All-American. He finished his college career with 5,540 rushing yards to rank sixth all time in NCAA Division I-A history, and second only to Ricky Williams in Longhorns team history.\n\nHe has often been compared to Williams, due to their similarities in running style, college choice, legal complications, and superficial appearance (roughly the same size and build coming out of college, and both had dreadlocks early in their careers), and the fact that they had both been minor league baseball players.\n\nWhile attending the University of Texas, Benson majored in social work and sociology. During his latter years, he earned membership into the Texas' Athletics Director's Academic Honor Roll, and the Big 12 Commissioner's Honor Roll in fall of 2003. Also, while in college, Benson was arrested twice, once for possession of marijuana and the other for criminal trespass. The marijuana case was dropped after a friend came forward and claimed ownership. He received 8 days in jail for the trespass conviction although he spent no time in jail other than the day of arrest due to overcrowding in Travis County Jail. He was forced to serve a one-half game suspension against Baylor University.\n\n\"Source:\"\n\nThe Chicago Bears selected Benson as the fourth overall pick in the 2005 NFL Draft, making him the highest drafted Bears player since Dan Hampton in 1979. The Bears’ organization and Benson could not come to terms on a contract, causing him to miss the entire Bears' training camp. After a 36-day hold-out, Benson signed a five-year contract worth $35 million. The Bears wished to make Benson their feature running back, but his lengthy contract impasse had caused him to miss a significant portion of practice. Benson claimed that he received a cold reception upon his return because he claimed he would be starting by the third game despite holding out and not practicing. Jay Glazer reported that certain players even attempted to intentionally injure him during drills, though former Bears guard Ruben Brown has denied such claims.\n\nThe team temporarily made Thomas Jones their featured running back for the beginning of the 2005 season. Jones' performance impressed the Bears' coaching staff, and earned him the top spot on the team's depth-chart for the next two seasons. Benson occasionally received playtime, and he rushed for eighty yards on sixteen carries against the New Orleans Saints during his best game. However, shortly afterwards, he suffered a medial collateral ligament sprain and missed most of the remaining season.\n\nAfter the 2005 the Bears considered making Benson the team's starting running back after Jones was unhappy with his current contract status. The team's plans went astray when Benson injured his shoulder after colliding with Brian Urlacher during a routine scrimmage. Although the injury was not serious, it placed Benson on the sidelines for a majority of the preseason.\n\nAlthough Benson fully recovered from his injury, head coach Lovie Smith selected Jones as the Bears' starter. Benson scored his first two touchdowns during week five of the 2006 season, against the Buffalo Bills. In a game against the New England Patriots during week twelve of the season, Benson collided with linebacker Junior Seau, causing Seau to fall down and fracture his forearm.\n\nDays later, Benson challenged Smith's coaching by remarking, \"the NFL is not like high school or college, but the best players don't always get on the field.\" The following week, Benson out rushed Jones and scored a vital touchdown against the Minnesota Vikings on 4th down. However, when asked about it after the game, he said he didn't know that it was 4th down. He began to receive more carries as the weeks progressed, and managed to rush for over 100 yards against the Green Bay Packers.\n\nBenson became the Bears' secondary running back again during the playoffs. In the 2006 NFC Championship game against the New Orleans Saints, Benson scored a fourth-quarter touchdown and totaled 60 yards. Though he was given a majority of the team's carries, his counterpart, Jones, amassed two touchdowns and 123 rushing yards. In the team's following game, Super Bowl XLI, Benson sustained a knee injury in the first half, and missed the remainder of the game.\n\nSmith named Benson as the Bears' starting running back after the team traded Jones to the New York Jets. Benson struggled throughout the preseason, but received enough support from his teammates and coaches to retain his starting position. He amassed only forty-two yards in his first regular season game and committed a costly turnover. However, Benson rebounded with a 101-yard performance during his next start. After several inconsistent games, Benson began to stabilize after the bye week. In one of his best games of the season, Benson rushed for eighty-nine yards and scored one touchdown on eleven attempts. He averaged 5.8 yards in his next game, but sustained a season-ending ankle injury. Benson, who had amassed 647 yards and four touchdowns, was eventually relieved by Adrian N. Peterson.\n\nJerry Angelo, the Bears' general manager, had expressed interest in acquiring a new running back to revitalize the Bears' running game, which finished last in yards in the league. Upon hearing the news, Benson commented, “You all know the competition that goes on around here. It doesn’t matter to me. Maybe somebody else can get some criticism.” On June 9, 2008, Benson was released by the Bears following his second alcohol-related arrest in five weeks.\n\nIn October 2009, Benson confirmed that shortly before he was released by the Bears, he had been diagnosed with Celiac disease.\n\nShortly after the grand jury failed to indict him on both incidents in Austin, Benson signed a one-year, $520,000 contract with the Cincinnati Bengals on September 30, 2008. DeDe Dorsey was placed on injured reserve and Chris Perry was the starter. Benson's season began in a loss to the Dallas Cowboys, rushing 10 times for 30 yards. He became the starting back for the Bengals in Week 7 against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Benson rushed 14 times for 52 yards in his first career start as a Bengal, and ran over Steelers safety Troy Polamalu, giving the Pro Bowler a concussion. In the following 35–6 loss to the Houston Texans, he totaled 49 yards on 13 carries and had two receptions for 20 yards. The Bengals picked up their first victory of the season in a 21–19 game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, with Benson carrying 24 times for 104 yards and a touchdown. Benson hit his stride in the Bengals' three-game winning streak at the end of the season, gashing the Washington Redskins in week 15 with 161 yards from scrimmage, including 88 yards receiving (79 of which came on a screen pass). In week 16, Benson dominated the Cleveland Browns, rushing for 171 yards. In the final game of the season against the Kansas City Chiefs, Benson had 111 yards on 25 carries. In the twelve games he was active during the 2008 season, Benson had 932 yards from scrimmage: 747 rushing and 185 receiving.\n\nA free agent after the 2008 season, Benson visited with the Houston Texans before signing a two-year, $7-million contract with the Bengals on March 3, 2009.\n\nEntering week 8 of the 2009 season, Benson had 164 carries for an NFL best 720 yards (4.4 per carry average). In week 5, he became the first 100-yard rusher against the Baltimore Ravens in 40 games, when he rushed for 120 yards and a touchdown. In week 7, Benson faced his former team, the Chicago Bears, and rushed for a career-high 189 yards and a touchdown.\n\nBenson went on to record his first 1,000-yard rushing season and he set a Bengals franchise record with six games with over 100 rushing yards. He finished the season as the NFL's 8th leading rusher with 1,251 yards, despite playing only 13 games. He then set a Bengals postseason record with 169 rushing yards in their 24–14 loss to the New York Jets.\n\nThe Bengals declined to resign Benson in 2012. Coach Marvin Lewis later recounted how he explained the decision to Benson: \"'Ced, it's not that I didn't think you could do that on the football field, it was the other [stuff] that I got tired of. When I would go to you and say we're going to rotate the backs [and Benson would take it poorly]. I don't need that anymore.'\"\n\nOn August 12, 2012, Benson signed with the Green Bay Packers. The deal was reportedly a one-year contract worth $825,000.\n\nOn October 7, 2012, Benson suffered a Lisfranc injury to his foot and was later placed on injured reserve.\n\nRushing Stats\nReceiving Stats\nBenson's cousin, Aaron, played linebacker for the University of Texas from 2010–2013, but gave up the sport in his redshirt senior year.\n\nBenson had celiac disease and attributed his adoption of a gluten-free diet to giving him more energy.\n\nAfter his NFL career, Benson became a loan originator.\n\nBefore the start of the 2008 season, Benson was arrested for allegedly operating a boat while intoxicated and resisting arrest. On May 3, 2008, the incident occurred near Austin, Texas, by the Lower Colorado River Authority during a late night safety inspection. The official police report cited that Benson had failed a field sobriety test, and became hostile towards the police. The officers arrested Benson, and proceeded to use pepper-spray after he forcefully resisted arrest. Benson was later detained for the night, and charged with boating while intoxicated and resisting arrest.\nBenson later refuted the charges against him, and stated he requested to take a follow-up field sobriety test on land after failing the initial one. Benson has further accused the officers of abusing him, stating, “I’m not handcuffed. I’m not under arrest. I’m not threatening him. I’m not pushing him. I’m not touching him. And he sprays me right in the eye.” He also asserts that officers continuously struck his ankles and feet to prevent him from walking properly. A female passenger on Benson's boat also claims to have witnessed the abuse and called her father out of fear for Benson's safety. Her fiancé, also on the boat, may have dozens of pictures confirming Benson's account.\n\nUpon hearing about the incident, Bears' head coach Lovie Smith stated, “I haven’t had a chance to speak with Cedric yet, but anytime we’re talking about one of our players getting arrested, you’re disappointed in it,” and added “What we’re going to do from here, I’ll go back and try to get as much information as I possibly can and go from there.”\n\nBenson was arrested for driving while intoxicated in Austin, Texas, on June 7, 2008. While returning from a restaurant with his girlfriend, police claim that Benson drove through a red light, and failed a field sobriety test. Police claim he later refused to take a breath or blood test to determine his blood alcohol level. Police proceeded to detain Benson, and later released him on bond. Benson denied the police officers' allegations and insisted that he \"aced\" the field test. Bears general manager Jerry Angelo commented, \"It's unfortunate. Disappointment is too much an often used word when we're talking about Cedric. The No. 1 lesson for every player is protect your job. We're all held accountable for our actions. I'm not going to say any more than that until we know for sure what the facts are.\" On the following Monday, Benson was waived from the Bears. Angelo commented on the release, stating ”Cedric displayed a pattern of behavior we will not tolerate... As I said this past weekend, you have to protect your job. Everyone in this organization is held accountable for their actions.\"\n\nBenson was later ordered by a county judge to put a built-in ignition interlock breathalyzer in his car. He was also told to start drug counseling classes. Benson was cleared of all charges in September, after appearing before two grand juries in Travis County.\n\nOn June 29, 2010, Benson was arrested for assault with injury after reportedly punching a bartender in the face. Benson himself denied committing the crime. Almost a month after the ordeal, the NFL announced that Benson would not be suspended.\n\nOn July 17, 2011, Benson was arrested in Austin, Texas, for a misdemeanor charge of assault causing bodily injury to a family member. He was sentenced to 20 days in jail and ordered to pay a $4,000 fine. Benson was released from jail on September 3, after only five days of his sentence. He received a one-game suspension, enacted in week 8.\n\nOn February 18, 2017, Benson was charged with driving while intoxicated in downtown Austin, Texas. According to court documents, Benson refused to take a field sobriety test and could not recite the alphabet from G to Z nor count past the number 3. Benson was released on the same day after posting bond.\n\nOn August 17, 2019, Benson and a female passenger were killed when his motorcycle crashed with a minivan on RM 2222 in Austin, Texas. Benson and the woman were pronounced dead at the scene, and two passengers in the minivan were injured.\nHe was 36.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2329627", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2329627", "title": "Mens Sana 1871 Basket", "text": "Mens Sana 1871 Basket\n\nMens Sana 1871 Basket is an Italian professional basketball club based in Siena. It is a section of the sports club Polisportiva Mens Sana, founded in 1871.\n\nUnder the name Montepaschi Siena, derived from sponsor Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, the club was a dominant presence in the Italian Serie A, winning five titles in a row from 2006–07 to 2010–11, besides two more titles later revoked by the Italian Federation, whilst also challenging for titles in Europe. \nAfter financial problems caused the club to go bankrupt in 2014, it moved down to the fourth division. In the 2015–16 season it played in the second division.\n\nFor past club sponsorship names, see the list below.\n\nThe parent organisation, Associazione Ginnastica Senese \"Mens Sana in Corpore Sano 1871\", was formed on 16 April 1871 by university students. In the beginning of the 19th century the gymnastics club became a multi-sports club () by adding other sports under its wing.\n\nBasketball was first practiced by the club in May 1907 when - at the Venice Gymnastics competition - teacher Ida Nomi Pesciolini led a women's team in a basketball demonstration. It's claimed this was the first time the game - invented in 1891 - was played in Italy, with Nomi discovering the sport whilst in the United Kingdom and then translating the rules in Italian.\n\nThe official basketball section of the club was established in 1934. However, the club and the organisation as a whole had limited activities until the end of the Second World War in 1945. After that date, basketball was played again, at first by students from the Piccolomini high school.\n\nOn 5 March 1967, Mens Sana played against city rival Costone for a place in the second division Serie B, with the former winning 64–63. \nIn 1973, having lost the previous year, Siena beat Brina Rieti 80–66 to reach the top tier Serie A for the first time.\nDuring the 1974–75 season, Sapori Siena finished fifth in the league thanks to a slow-paced style combined with zone defense as twin towers Carl Johnson and Enrico Bovone dominated the paint.\n\nIn 1978–79, Antonini Siena reached the Serie A quarterfinals, earning a place in the 1979–80 FIBA Korać Cup where they went to the Round of 16.\nOnly two seasons later the side was in the second division again and at the end of the 1986 season it moved down to the third division Serie B Eccellenza.\nSiena would stay there until 1990, returning to the Serie A in 1991 and staying there for good from 1994. At the beginning of the decade, the club had become autonomous from the Polisportiva.\n\nWith coaches like Gianfranco Lombardi, Cesare Pancotto and Valerio Bianchini and players Sandro Dell'Agnello, Sylvester Gray, Larry Middleton and Gerard King the club had solid results, including two Serie A quarterfinals in 1997–98 and 1999–00 and two participations in the FIBA Korać Cup.\n\nIn the summer of 2000, Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, a banking company based in the city, became the majority sponsor of the side.\nThe club, now known as Montepaschi Siena, took a new dimension, first signing Italian international Roberto Chiacig and playing in the 2000–01 FIBA SuproLeague.\nA year later coach Ergin Ataman and players Vrbica Stefanov, Mindaugas Žukauskas, Boris Gorenc and Milenko Topić were added.\nThe team, with the mid-season addition of Petar Naumoski, beat Pamesa Valencia to lift the 2002 Saporta Cup, their first ever title.\n\nIn 2002–03, Montepaschi added guard Alphonso Ford and forward Mirsad Türkcan. For their first season in the Euroleague, Europe's best competition, the Italians reached the Final Four (just the second team to achieve the feat), losing 62–65 to Benetton Treviso, a team that also beat them in the domestic semifinals on the way to the title.\n\nBefore the 2003–04 season, Carlo Recalcati, the Italian national team coach, was chosen in order to win a scudetto (Italian title), with Ford and Turkcan being replaced by David Andersen, Giacomo Galanda, Bootsy Thornton, David Vanterpool and later Michalis Kakiouzis. \nSiena would accomplish that goal, sweeping all of its playoff series 3–0 and claiming their first ever scudetto after toppling Metis Varese, Scavolini Pesaro and Skipper Bologna.\nEarlier, the same Bologna side had impeded their second Euroleague Final Four run, beating Montepaschi 103–102 in overtime.\n\nThe next two seasons put a brake on that success, with the sole addition of the Italian Supercup amidst two quarterfinal eliminations in the league and one Top 16 appearance in the Euroleague.\nSiena native and long serving club member Simone Pianigiani was promoted to the head coach role in 2006 whilst the roster was overhauled. \nMontepaschi went to the quarterfinals of the 2006–07 ULEB Cup (Europe's second tier competition) before losing to UNICS. More importantly, a team led by Rimantas Kaukėnas, Joseph Forte and Terrell McIntyre won 39 of the 44 games they played in the Serie A season (with a 3–0 finals sweep) to earn their second league title.\n\nWith the return of Thornton and the addition of Kšyštof Lavrinovič, Montepaschi reached the 2008 Euroleague Final Four after sweeping their quarterfinals. A 17-point second-half lead against Maccabi Elite Tel Aviv proved insufficient as the Italians lost in the semifinal.\nOn the domestic front, Siena started the season with 18 successive wins and were never challenged in their third title conquest.\n\nIn 2008–09, Siena became the second side to complete a domestic treble after losing just one game on their way to the league, Cup and Supercup titles.\n\nAfter adding Nikos Zisis, Marko Jarić, Malik Hairston and Bo McCalebb, Montepaschi reached another Euroleague Final Four in 2011, overcoming then-top scorer McCalebb's injury and a record 48-point loss to Olympiacos in the quarterfinals game 1. \nHowever, they were again stopped in the semifinals, this time by champions Panathinaikos. \nIn the league they proved unstoppable again, adding a fifth straight Serie A crown and a third straight Cup title to their trophy cabinet.\nIn 2011–12, Montepaschi achieved an unprecedented sixth consecutive Serie A title, adding the Supercup (their fifth in a row) and Cup (fourth) for good measure.\nThe 2011–12 Euroleague saw eventual champions Olympiacos avenge their preceding year's defeat by topping the Italians in the quarterfinals.\nAll the titles won during this season were to be revoked four years later by the Italian Basketball Federation, following an investigation for accounting and fiscal fraud.\n\n2012–13 saw two major changes with a decrease in budget that saw several players leave and a change in coach, with Pianigiani replaced by assistant Luca Banchi.\nMontepaschi wasn't as competitive, being eliminated at the Euroleague Top 16 stage whilst in the domestic league they finished the regular season in fifth place with 12 losses.\nHowever the holders rallied in the playoffs, winning two Best-of–7 series in game 7, against EA7 Emporio Armani Milano and Cimberio Varese before toppling Acea Roma 4–1 in the finals to add title number seven to the Cup they had earlier won. This title too was revoked three years later by the Italian Basketball Federation.\n\nThe next season (2013-2014) saw an ever-contracting budget and a more ordinary roster, Montepaschi found it harder to compete in the 2013–14 Euroleague, alternating between close wins (sometimes on the buzzer) and closer defeats, ending the season with 3 wins and 7 losses. In their final game against Unicaja that would decide who progressed from the group, the Italians were the victims of a buzzer beating shot that eliminated them from the competition.\nThough its financial problems emerged to the fore, with a relegation all but assured due to massive debts, on the court the holders kept fighting, pushing favourites Milan to seven games in the Serie A finals, though they would go on to concede the title.\n\nSoon after, Mens Sana Basket was declared bankrupt amidst debts of 5,4 million euros and the departure of sponsor Montepaschi even if the company had revenue for over 400 million Euro.

It is a municipality and the headquarters of Adoni mandal, administered under the Adoni Revenue Division. In the 2011 census of India, Adoni had a population of 166,344, making it the 16th most populous town in the state with an urban agglomeration population of 184,625.\n\nThe Adoni fort is central to the town's history. In 1780, an observer wrote,\n\nIn the 15th century and early to mid 16th century, Adoni was a fort town of the Vijayanagara Empire. It was controlled by the kinsmen of Aliya Rama Raya, a powerful aristocrat of the Vijayanagara.\n\nIn 1558, during the decline of the Vijayanagara Empire, control of Adoni came to Ali Adil Shah I (1558–1579), the fifth Sultan of the Bijapur Sultanate. Hamilton, in 1820, stated,\n\nIn 1564, the Sultanate of Bijapur lost control of Adoni to Mohammedan rulers.\n\nFrom 1678 to 1688, rule of Adoni lay with Siddi Masud, a wealthy \"Habshi\" (African) from Abyssinia who was a powerful general of Raja Anup Singh of Bikaner, Siddi Masud improved the fort; cleared the surrounding forest; established the townships of Imatiazgadh and Adilabad and constructed the Shahi Jamia Masjid. Siddi Masud was also an avid art collector and a patron of the Kurnool school of painting. In 1688, Adoni was attacked by Firuz Jang, a Mughal general. Siddi Musud surrendered with his courtiers and family.\n\nAt the fall of the Mughal Empire, around 1760, Adoni was ruled by governors appointed by the Nizam of Hyderabad, a Mughal splinter clan. One such governor was Salabat Jung, brother of the Nizam. The French supported the appointment. However,\n\nIn 1786, Adoni was besieged for one month and then captured by Tipu Sultan of the Kingdom of Mysore of South India. On 4 May 1799, Tipu Sultan died at the hands of the English. On 15 June 1800, Arthur Wellesley, Marquess of Wellington, wrote to the resident at Hyderabad about appropriate reparations to the Nizam for English occupation of Adoni. Adoni became one of twenty taluqs and in 1810, the Adoni and Nagaldinna taluqs were combined. In 1817 Adoni, at the beginning of the Third Anglo-Maratha War, the British raised a new battalion from other nearby regiments. By 1842, the military had left Adoni because of the perception that the area was susceptible to cholera and because of the unfavourable rugged surrounding geography. Under British rule, South India was divided into several administrative districts. Adoni fell into the district of Bellary of Madras presidency. On 29 April 1861, the acting district engineer of Kurnool wrote to the chief secretary to government at Fort St George,\nIn 1867, the Adoni and the Bellary Municipal Councils were created. Between 1876 and 1878, a severe El Nino famine affected Adoni and the surrounding areas where nearly one third of the population died.\nIn 1953, after the linguistic reorganisation of the states, Adoni gained its present seat as part of Andhra Pradesh.\n\nAdoni is located at . It has an average elevation of above sea level. The climate is mainly tropical, with temperatures from 31 °C to 45 °C in summer and 21 °C to 29 °C in winter.\nThe soil is black and red.

In the same year, children were between 0 and 6 years of age. In this group, were boys and were girls, giving a gender ratio of 968 per 1000. The average literacy rate was 68.38 percent with literate people. This number was significantly lower than the national average of 73 percent.\n\nThe urban agglomeration had a population of 184,771, of which 92,006 were male and 92,765 were female, giving a gender ratio of 1008 females per 1000 males. Children aged 0 to 6 years numbered 20,517. There were 112,151 literate people giving an average literacy rate of 68.28 percent.\n\nTelugu is an official language of the city. Kannada is the third largest spoken language in the city, second being Urdu.\n\nAdoni is a large producer of cotton and has a substantial ginning and textile industry. The next most important industry is groundnut oil. Adoni is an important trading centre in Andhra Pradesh with a large market situated in the centre of the town.\n\nHistorical Adoni Fort and Shahi Jamia Masjid built in 1660 by Siddi Masud are some of the notable landmarks around the city. Islam järna/Sri Rama Jala is also one of the famous historical landmarks. Now it provides water for the town and also has a pump house.

{"id": "2329635", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2329635", "title": "Diana Nyad", "text": "Diana Nyad\n\nDiana Nyad (née Sneed; born August 22, 1949) is an American author, journalist, motivational speaker, and long-distance swimmer. Nyad gained national attention in 1975 when she swam around Manhattan () and in 1979 when she swam from North Bimini, The Bahamas, to Juno Beach, Florida (). In 2013, on her fifth attempt and at age 64, she became the first person confirmed to swim from Cuba to Florida without the aid of a shark cage, swimming from Havana to Key West (). Nyad was also once ranked thirteenth among US women squash players.\n\nNyad was born in New York City on August 22, 1949, to stockbroker William L. Sneed Jr. and his wife Lucy Winslow Curtis (1925–2007). Her mother was a great-granddaughter of Charlotte N. Winslow, the inventor of Mrs Winslow's Soothing Syrup, a popular morphine-based medicine for children teething that was manufactured from 1849 until the 1930s. She is also a great-grandniece of women's-rights activist Laura Curtis Bullard.\n\nThe Sneeds divorced in 1952, after which Lucy Sneed married Aristotle Z. Nyad, a Greek-Egyptian land developer, who adopted Diana. The family moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where she began swimming seriously in seventh grade.\n\nShe was enrolled at the private Pine Crest School in the mid-1960s, swimming under the tutelage of Olympian and Hall of Fame coach Jack Nelson who, she has said, molested her beginning when she was fourteen years old and continuing until she graduated from high school, as he did with other girls he coached. She won three Florida state high school championships in the Backstroke at 100 and 200 yards (91 and 183 m). She dreamed of swimming in the 1968 Summer Olympics, but in 1966 she spent three months in bed with endocarditis, an infection of the heart, and when she began swimming again she had lost speed.\n\nAfter graduating from Pine Crest School in 1967, she entered Emory University, but was eventually expelled for jumping out a fourth-floor dormitory window wearing a parachute. She then enrolled at Lake Forest College in Illinois, where she played tennis for the \"Foresters\" and resumed swimming, concentrating on distance events. She soon came to the attention of Buck Dawson, director of the International Swimming Hall of Fame in Florida, who introduced her to marathon swimming. She began training at his Camp Ak-O-Mak in Magnetawan, Ontario, Canada and set a women's world record of 4 hours and 22 minutes in her first race, a 10-mile (16 km) swim in Lake Ontario in July 1970, finishing 10th overall. After graduating from Lake Forest College in 1973, with a degree in English and French, Nyad returned to south Florida to continue training with Dawson.\n\nNyad has written four books: \"Other Shores\" (Random House: September 1978) about her life and distance swimming, \"Basic Training for Women\" (Harmony Books: 1981), \"Boss of Me: The Keyshawn Johnson Story\" (1999) about an NFL wide-receiver, and \"Find a Way: One Wild and Precious Life\" (Knopf Publishing Group: 2015). She has also written for \"The New York Times,\" NPR's \"All Things Considered,\" \"Newsweek\" magazine, and other publications. Diana and her best friend Bonnie Stoll (former No. 3 in the world on the Pro Racquetball Tour) have formed a company called BravaBody which is aimed at providing online exercise advice to women over 40, with the two world-class athletes giving direct inspiration and custom-made work-outs. As of 2006, she also delivered motivational talks to groups through the Gold Star speakers agency, for a fee of between $10,000 to $15,000.\n\nNyad formerly hosted the public radio program \"The Savvy Traveler.\" In addition, she was the subject of a short documentary \"Diana\" by the digital channel WIGS in 2012. As of 2006, she was a (long-time) weekly contributor to National Public Radio's afternoon news show \"All Things Considered\" (appearing on Thursdays), as well as the \"business of sport\" commentator for American Public Media's public radio program \"Marketplace\" business news. She was also a regular contributor to the CBS News television show \"Sunday Morning\".\nIn her 1978 autobiography Nyad described marathon swimming as a battle for survival against a brutal foe—the sea—and the only victory possible is to \"touch the other shore.\"\n\nAn analysis of Nyad's ability to dissociate during her marathon swims is covered by James W. Pipkin.\n\nAn independently produced documentary film, \"The Other Shore,\" was released in early 2013, some months before Nyad's first successful swim from Cuba to Florida.\n\nOver two days in 1979, Nyad swam from Bimini to Florida, setting a distance record for non-stop swimming without a wetsuit that still stands today. She broke numerous world records, including the 45-year-old mark for circling Manhattan Island (7 hrs, 57 min) in 1975.\n\n\nSeveral experts who attended the 2011 Global Open Water Swimming Conference in New York City on June 17–19, 2011 expressed their strong belief that Nyad had both the physical ability and, more importantly, the positive mental stamina to be able to complete the Cuba-to-Florida swim: sports physiology studies have shown that in \"extreme\" marathon-type activities mental determination is a more important factor than the physical energy of youth.\n\nBy early January 2010 Nyad began training for a summer attempt to swim from Cuba to Florida. Taking up residence in the Caribbean island of St. Maarten, from January through June, she would go for 8-, 10-, 12-, and 14-hour-long swims every other week. She then moved her training to Key West and, while waiting for favorable weather conditions, she embarked on a 24-hour swim. On July 10, she reserved a 35-foot fishing vessel to take her out to sea. At 8:19 AM she jumped overboard and began swimming back towards Key West, with the boat following her. At 8:19 AM the next day her handlers helped her back on board, still about from land: she said she felt \"tired and dehydrated\" but still \"strong\" and \"easily able to swim another 20 hours without any problem.\"\n\nOn July 10, 2010, at the age of 60, she began open water training in preparation for a 60-hour, 103-mile (166 km) swim from Cuba to Florida, a task she had failed to accomplish thirty years prior. When asked about her motivation, she answered, \"Because I'd like to prove to the other 60 year-olds that it is never too late to start your dreams.\" She was scheduled to make the swim in August/September 2010, but bad weather forced her to cancel; she rescheduled for July 2011. In an October 15, 2010 interview with CNN, Nyad said she was trained and ready to swim by July 23, but a record stretch of high winds and dropping water temperatures prevented her from making the attempt.\n\nWhile training in St. Maarten, she sat for an interview that was published March 25, 2011 by the island's online news agency, \"The Daily Herald\", remarking that \"It's a large operation, like an expedition. We've got about 25 people, navigators, managers, boat crew, weather routers, medical people, shark experts, you name it. That's the time also when the water starts to get to its hottest. I need the hottest possible ocean. As soon as we hit the right forecast, we'll be off to Havana. We won't know the exact starting point probably until the night before. And we don't know exactly where landfall will be...I'd love to wind up in Key West, but it will depend on trajectory of the Gulf Stream.\" Nyad estimated that the cost of her \"expedition\" was about $500,000.\n\nNyad moved her training site from the Caribbean island of St. Maarten to Key West, Florida, in June 2011. She was joined by key members of her support team on June 28, to wait for ideal weather conditions that typically occur only during the summer doldrums in July and August. For the marathon swim to be feasible, two main weather conditions needed to come together at the same time: a combination of low-to-light winds (to minimize sea chop), and water temperatures in the high 80s °F (high 20s/low 30s °C). These relatively \"high\" water temperatures produce a twin challenge: in the first half of her swim the warm water will dehydrate her body, while in the second half her body temperature will drop and she will face potential hypothermia. Nyad had bulked up her physique to about 150 pounds/70 kg (15 pounds/7 kg more than she weighed in 2010) to help counter the loss of body mass during her grueling swim.\n\nNyad was escorted by a paddler in a kayak equipped with an electronic shark repellent known as a Shark Shield.\n\nTo keep Nyad swimming in a straight line, her specially designed, slow-moving catamaran support boat deployed a streamer: a long pole keeps the streamer several yards away from the boat, and the streamer is designed to remain about 5 feet underwater, so that Nyad can swim above it, much like following a lane line in a swimming pool. At night, the white streamer was replaced by a string of red LED lights. Writing in her blog in July 2011, Nyad stated that the development of the submerged guide streamer, in early summer 2011, may be the single greatest aid to her marathon swim. In all of her previous swims, she had trouble keeping the support boat in sight and was prone to veer off-course. Keeping a boat headed in a straight line, in the ocean, while moving at only 1 to 2 knots is very difficult, and her catamaran is equipped with thrusters and a special sea anchor (in case of following seas) to stabilize its course.\n\nSome 33 years after her first attempt in 1978, Nyad entered the water again at Havana on August 7, 2011 at 7:45PM, a CNN news team on board her support ship to provide live coverage of her swim, which involved electronic \"Shark Shields\" but no shark cage. Nyad stopped her attempt early in the morning on August 9 at 12:45AM after 29 hours in the water, after encountering strong currents and winds that pushed her miles off course to the east. Nyad also said she had been suffering shoulder pain since her third hour in the water, but what made her abandon the effort was a flare-up of her asthma, such that, throughout the final hour, she could only swim a few strokes before repeatedly having to roll on her back to catch her breath.\n\nOn September 23, 2011, Diana Nyad began a third attempt at the Cuba-to-Florida swim, again without a shark cage, but had to stop after about 41 hours, about through the passage, because of jellyfish and Portuguese man-of-war stings and after currents pushed her off course. Nyad's October 2011 TED talk described how box jellyfish stings on her forearm and neck caused respiratory distress that eventually caused the swim to end.\n\nOn August 18, 2012, Nyad began her fourth attempt, without a protective shark cage. Nyad and her team ended the swim prematurely at 12:55 a.m. on August 21, 2012, reportedly because of two storms and nine jellyfish stings, after having covered more distance than her three previous attempts.\n\nOn the morning of August 31, 2013, Nyad began her fifth bid to swim from Havana, Cuba to Florida, a distance of about , accompanied by a 35-person support team, swimming without a shark cage but protected from jellyfish by a silicone mask, a full bodysuit, gloves and booties. Before reaching Florida, Nyad broke Penny Palfrey's 2012 distance record for the Cuba to Florida swim, putting Nyad closer to Key West than anyone swimming without a shark cage. At approximately 1:55 pm EDT on September 2, 2013, Nyad reached the beach in Key West, about 53 hours after she began her journey.\n\nWhile not directly questioning the authenticity of her story, some skeptics, including long-distance swimmers, requested the swim's GPS history, surface current, weather, and Nyad's eating and drinking data. The swim's published GPS data was analyzed and graphed on September 8 by \"The New York Times.\" After Nyad's September 10 response to questions and her publishing path data and notes from her navigator and two observers, a University of Miami oceanography professor, Tamay Ozgokmen, confirmed the navigator's assertion that favorable Gulf Stream currents explained Nyad's apparently incredible total velocity during certain portions of the swim. The \"New York Times\" public editor observed on September 19 that the focus had shifted from serious questions about possibly resting aboard a boat, to more technical issues relating to whether her crews' touching her while helping with her protective suit formally rendered the swim an \"assisted\" swim. Nyad had explained that wearing the jellyfish-protection suit was a life-and-death measure that for her superseded the previous \"traditions\" of the sport. On September 12, 2013, Nyad said she would \"wait and see\" if the swim would be officially ratified. As of 2018, the swim has apparently not been ratified.\n\nOn September 10, 2013, Nyad appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. She explained that she started her training in the Caribbean in January 2013 with 12-hour workouts of nonstop swimming and eventually worked up to 14, 18, 20, and 24 hours. Nyad also said that while she swims she remembers Stephen Hawking books, sings, counts numbers and has vivid hallucinations of The Wizard of Oz and the yellow brick road.\n\nOn March 4, 2014, Nyad was announced as one of the celebrities to compete on the 18th season of \"Dancing with the Stars\", in which she finished in last place. She was partnered with professional dancer Henry Byalikov.\n\nIn 1989, Nyad was a guest correspondent on an episode of Unsolved Mysteries about Alcatraz. She assisted on a segment that detailed real-life, current reenactments of both kayakers and a swimmer attempting to traverse San Francisco Bay. \n\nNyad appeared in the Macy Gray music video for the song “Bang, Bang” in 2014.\n\nAlso in 2014, Nyad performed in her solo show (which she had also written) called \"ONWARD – The Diana Nyad story,\", which premiered that year at the NoHo Arts Centre Theater in Los Angeles, directed by Josh Ravetch.\n\nNyad was inducted into the United States National Women's Sports Hall of Fame in 1986. She is also an International Marathon Swimming Hall of Fame Honoree (1978) and an ISHOF Al Schoenfield Media Award recipient (2002). She is a Hall of Famer at her college, Lake Forest College in Illinois, and at her high school, Pine Crest School in Fort Lauderdale.\n\n\n\nNyad has said a factor in her determination while swimming was her anger about, and her desire to overcome, sexual abuse she said she experienced as a child. Nyad has spoken publicly about this issue. Most recently, she candidly described this painful part of her life and her struggle to overcome the pain in an article in the New York Times. Nyad is openly lesbian and is an atheist.\n\nFrom October 8–10, 2013, Nyad participated in \"Swim for Relief\" by doing a 48-hour continuous swim in New York City's Herald Square in a specially constructed, 120-foot long, two lane pool. It raised $105,001.00 for AmeriCares to benefit the victims of Hurricane Sandy.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2329653", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2329653", "title": "Bocci", "text": "Bocci\n\nBocci is a Canadian design and manufacturing company based in Vancouver and Berlin, founded in 2005 by Randy Bishop and Omer Arbel. Bocci specializes in sculptural lighting and large light installations.\n\nThe company began in 2005 after a chance meeting between Randy Bishop and Omer Arbel during New York Design Week. Arbel was exhibiting an early prototype of '14', a cast-glass pendant light and Bishop was attending a candy convention on the floor above. Upon returning to Vancouver, Bishop and Arbel launched Bocci and began production of 14. Bishop currently handles the business side of the company while Arbel is creative director.\n\nBocci currently offers seven families of ambient lighting (14, 16, 21, 28, 38, 57 & 73), two design objets (19 & 25) and one collection of electrical accessories (22). The collections are named numerically to reflect their place in the chronology of Arbel's creative process; very few of his designs have commercial viability, hence the gaps between the series numbers.\n\n\"14\" is a cast-glass pendant fastened by a borosilicate glass lamp holder. It can be suspended by coaxial cable in its chandelier form or fastened to the wall as a surface-mount light. It has been described as giving the effect of \"a candle floating in water\" and is considered a classic piece of Canadian design. 14 received a Red Dot Award and a Good Design Award from the Chicago Athenaeum Museum of Design in 2007.\n\n\"16\" is a new addition to the Bocci collection. It was unveiled as a large outdoor installation on 5 March 2015 at Vancouver's Fairmont Pacific Rim Hotel. 16 has an innovative armature system which carries a low-voltage charge, eliminating the need for interior wiring. The pendants are composed of two halves made by free pouring three separate layers of hot glass: first milk white, then transparent grey, and finally clear. The two halves of the piece contain a flat ring-shaped LED lamp that preserves the leaf-like appearance of the finished product, and the \"leaves\" are attached to a stainless steel armature that may be hung as a chandelier or emerge from the ground in a configuration similar to a tree. 16 is the first piece to use this novel armature system but it will soon be adapted for use in other Bocci collections. 16 will officially debut at Euroluce 2015 in Milan.\n\n\"19\" is an exploration of sand-casting using high copper content brass. A void is made in sand and then filled with molten metal, resulting in a natural overspill that is usually removed in post-production. In the case of 19, the overspill is the highlight of the piece – left raw and oxidized while the centre is polished to a mirror finish. 19 comes in three sizes, each numbered and signed. 19 received a Red Dot Award in 2011.\n\n\"21\" is composed of thin sheets of porcelain draped around a trumpet shaped borosilicate diffuser. The porcelain is allowed to take whatever form comes naturally, and as such each piece is unique. 21 was a finalist for the D&AD Yellow Pencil Award and was awarded \"Best of Year\" by Interior Design Magazine in 2008.\n\n\"22\" is a suite of electrical accessories that eliminate the need for a visible cover plate. Operative components (such as outlets, switches, and ports) are designed to sit flush with any surface they are mounted to. The 22 series won a Red Dot Award, a Yellow Pencil Yearbook Entry and an iF Design Award in 2009. 22 holds US Patent Numbers 7,956,295 and 8,232,482.\n\n\"25\" is a bench that avoids the traditional upholstery technique of covering foam with fabric, relying rather on excess fabric to provide a comfortable seat. The extra cloth is allowed to fold randomly and changes over time with use. At the time of writing 25 had finished its run and is on indefinite backorder.\n\n\"28\" is a hand-blown glass pendant with randomly composed interior satellites, one of which acts as a lamp holder. The satellites are created using a technique requiring inversion of the direction of airflow into glass and the subsequent creation of a vacuum, resulting in a controlled implosion. 28s may be suspended by coaxial cable or copper wire in chandelier form or mounted directly to the wall. They come in a multitude of colours and won a Red Dot Award in 2012, an iF Design Award in 2011, and a Good Design Award from the Chicago Athenaeum Museum of Design in 2010. The collection debuted at Spazio Rossana Orlandi in Milan in 2010 and was later exhibited on a much grander scale at the Victoria and Albert Museum in 2013.\n\n\"38\" is an extreme exploration of the same glass-blowing technique used to create 28. Large glass spheres are filled with random milk-white satellites, some deep enough to house succulents or cacti plants. 38s are suspended with rigid copper tubing. In 2014 Mallett Antiques played host to a large collection of 38s tumbling down the exterior walls of their building on Dover Street. 38 was \"highly commended\" at the Architectural Review Emerging Architecture Awards in 2012.\n\n\"57\" explores a technique similar to that used to create closed-cell foam, but using molten glass, resulting in an irregularly shaped pendant with random interior bubbles. The bubbles are invisible until the lamp is turned on, revealing hidden complexity. 57 premiered during Bocci's first showing at Euroluce in 2013 and has since received a Good Design Award from the Chicago Athenaeum Museum of Design. A large installation of 57 pendants was recently unveiled at the re-opening of Canada House on Trafalgar Square in London on 19 February 2015.\n\n\"73\" previewed at the Paris design exhibition Maison & Objet in January 2015. Glass is blown into a heat-resistant ceramic fabric, creating a unique shape and texture for each piece. 73 is meant to be clustered in groups to emphasize the effect of glass \"clouds.\" 73's full range of application will be shown at Euroluce 2015 in Milan alongside 16.\n\nBocci often participates in large public installations, which allow an ambitious and uninhibited expression of its internal culture and collective ideals. In 2013, 280 of the 28 series glass pendants were suspended in the entrance of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, cascading more than 30 metres down in a tangle of copper wires. In 2014, Arbel worked with Mallett Antiques to infuse their entire showroom with contemporary light installations - examples of 28, 38, and 57 crept through the entire building and spilled out onto Dover Street. Canada's embassy in London was closed for renovations and reopened by Queen Elizabeth II in February 2015 with 157 of Bocci's 57 series highlighting the central staircase. On 5 March 2014, Bocci and Omer Arbel unveiled the new 16 as a large outdoor installation at the entrance to Vancouver's Fairmont Pacific Rim hotel. \nThese ambitious public works appear to have been warmly received. The Royal Architectural Institute of Canada (RAIC) announced on 16 March 2015 that Omer Arbel would be awarded the Allied Arts Medal for 2015 based on the 28.280 at the Victoria and Albert Museum. The award is given once every two years to a Canadian artist or designer for outstanding achievement in artwork designed to be integrated with architecture.\nAfter breaking into Euroluce for the first time in 2013, Bocci is set to show again in April 2015. Euroluce 2015 coincides with Bocci's 10th anniversary and announcement of a major Berlin expansion. Bocci recently signed a 10-year lease on a historic 6-storey courthouse in Berlin's Charlottenburg district, with a central staircase destined to act as a laboratory for more ambitious installations. The Berlin office will also have a fully equipped glassblowing studio meaning Bocci will be in production outside of Vancouver for the first time.\n\nBocci Berlin opened 6 November 2015. The new showroom and 'living archive' features more than 40 rooms showing different products alongside experiments and projects that are not part of the Bocci catalogue. Bocci Berlin will continue the company tradition of in-house manufacturing with the addition of a glassblowing and ceramics studio to the property.\n\n"}

Ptolemy does not list a town for the Epidii, but the Ravenna Cosmography (RC 108.4) mentions \"Rauatonium\", which is assumed to be Southend.\n\nThe name \"Epidii\" appears to include the P-Celtic root \"epos\", meaning \"horse\" (c.f. Welsh \"ebol\", “a foal”). The Q-Celtic equivalent would be \"*ekwos\", which became Old Gaelic \"ech\". It is suggested that they were named after a horse god, whose name could be reconstructed as \"*Epidios\". The Q-Celtic equivalent would be \"*Ekwidios\", which may be the origin of the Old Gaelic name Eochaid. The root \"*ep-anto-s\", 'those who belong to the horse' or 'those who own horses', has also been proposed.\"\"\n\nThe Dagda, a Gaelic god, is often referred to as \"Eochaid Ollathair\".\n\nAlthough their name appears to be Brittonic/P-Celtic, some authorities suggest they were Goidelic/Q-Celtic speakers. Dr Ewan Campbell says \"Ptolemy's source for his Scottish names was probably from the Scottish Central Lowlands, and may have transmitted the Brittonic form of a Goidelic tribal name, or even the external name given to the tribe by Brittonic speakers\". Their presumed territory later became the heartland of the Goidelic kingdom of Dál Riata. Alex Woolf suggests that the Epidii became the Dál Riata, but argues that they were Brittonic-speaking in Ptolemy's time. He also suggests that the Hebrides, called the \"Ebudae\" by Ptolemy, were named after the Epidii.\n\n\n\n"}

It was recorded in 1968 during sessions for the double album \"The Beatles\" (also known as \"the White Album\"), but did not appear on that album.\n\nAn early acoustic demo of \"What's the New Mary Jane\" was recorded in late May 1968, at George Harrison's Esher home. It featured Lennon singing an octave higher than the final cut, placing the chorus at the very beginning as well as throughout, and switching the words \"cooking\" and \"groovy\" in the second verse:\n\nAs opposed to:\n\nAnother member of the Beatles can also be heard shouting \"What's the new Mary Jane? Oh, my goodness!\" near the end of the demo. This variation is notably shorter than the released version, clocking in at around 2:40.\n\nThe final version of this song was recorded on 14 August 1968 during the recording sessions for the Beatles tenth album \"The Beatles\" (aka \"The White Album\"), with Lennon and Harrison being the only band members playing on the track. Four takes were recorded with the final being marked as the best. It was later mixed in mono on 26 September with \"Glass Onion\", \"Happiness Is a Warm Gun\", and \"I Will\" and in stereo on 14 October before being added to the shortlist for the new album. However, during the album's final mixing stage, it was dropped due to time constraints, bringing the album down to 30 songs.\n\nDuring an interview, Lennon commented on \"What's the New Mary Jane\", saying, \"That was me, Yoko, and George sitting on the floor at EMI fooling around. Pretty good, huh?\"\n\nAfter the release of \"The Beatles\", Lennon was still adamant about releasing the song. On 26 November 1969, he and his wife Yoko Ono recorded further overdubs with plans for it to be issued as a single by the Plastic Ono Band alongside another unreleased song at the time, \"You Know My Name (Look Up the Number)\", which was eventually issued as the B-side of the Beatles' \"Let It Be\" single in 1970. When the other Beatles heard of his plans to release a Beatle track under his own band's name, however, the single was pulled. The song was remixed for inclusion on the album \"Sessions\" in 1985, but the album was never released due to objections by the surviving Beatles. The song, more than six minutes long, was not made available until 1996, on \"Anthology 3\". The much shorter first take of the song, without the sound effects added by Lennon and Ono, was later included on the 50th anniversary reissue of \"The Beatles\" in 2018, along with the May 1968 demo.\n\nThe song has three verses and a chorus (\"What a shame, Mary Jane had a pain at the party\") and then about 3 minutes consisting of avant garde sound effects. The track ends with a comment from Lennon: \"Let's hear it, before we get taken away\". (Part of the word \"away\" is cut off.)\n\nIn a 1969 interview with \"NME\", Lennon credited head of Apple Electronics and friend Magic Alex with writing half of the song, though this credit was later revoked without explanation.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2329664", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2329664", "title": "Jean Leclerc (theologian)", "text": "Jean Leclerc (theologian)\n\nJean Le Clerc, also Johannes Clericus (March 19, 1657 in Geneva – January 8, 1736 in Amsterdam), was a Genevan theologian and biblical scholar. He was famous for promoting exegesis, or critical interpretation of the Bible, and was a radical of his age. He parted with Calvinism over his interpretations and left Geneva for that reason.\n\nHis father, Stephen Le Clerc, was professor of Greek in Geneva. The family originally belonged to the neighborhood of Beauvais in France, and several of its members acquired some name in literature. Jean Le Clerc applied himself to the study of philosophy under Jean-Robert Chouet (1642-1731) the Cartesian, and attended the theological lectures of Philippe Mestrezat, François Turrettini and Louis Tronchin () (1629-1705). In 1678-1679 he spent some time in Grenoble as tutor in a private family; on his return to Geneva he passed his examinations and received ordination. Soon afterwards he went to Saumur.\n\nIn 1682 he went to London, where he remained for six months, preaching on alternate Sundays in the Walloon church and in the Savoy Chapel. Due to political instability, he moved to Amsterdam, where he was introduced to John Locke and to Philipp van Limborch, professor at the Remonstrant college. He later included Locke in the journals he edited; and the acquaintance with Limborch soon ripened into a close friendship, which strengthened his preference for the Remonstrant theology, already favorably known to him by the writings of his grand-uncle, Stephan Curcellaeus (d. 1645) and by those of Simon Episcopius.\n\nA last attempt to live at Geneva, made at the request of relatives there, satisfied him that the theological atmosphere was uncongenial, and in 1684 he finally settled in Amsterdam, first as a moderately successful preacher, until ecclesiastical jealousy reportedly shut him out from that career, and afterwards as professor of philosophy, belles-lettres and Hebrew in the Remonstrant seminary. This appointment, which he owed to Limborch, he held from 1684, and in 1725 on the death of his friend he was called to occupy the chair of church history also.\n\nApart from literary work, Le Clerc's life at Amsterdam was uneventful. In 1691 he married a daughter of Gregorio Leti. From 1728 onward he was subject to repeated strokes of paralysis, and he died 8 years later, on 8 January.\n\nHis suspected Socinianism was the cause, it is said, of his exclusion from the chair of dogmatic theology.\n\nIn 1679 in Saumur were published \"Liberii de Sancto Amore Epistolae Theologicae\" (Irenopoli: Typis Philalethianis), usually attributed to Leclerc. They deal with the doctrine of the Trinity, the Hypostatic union of the two natures in Jesus Christ, original sin, and other topics, in a manner unorthodox for the period. In 1685 he published with Charles Le Cène \"Entretiens sur diverses matières de théologie\".\n\nIn 1685 he published \"Sentimens de quelques theologiens de Hollande sur l'histoire critique du Vieux Testament composée par le P. Richard Simon\", in which, while pointing out what he believed to be Richard Simon's faults, he advanced views of his own. These included: arguments against the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch; his views as to the manner in which the five books were composed; and his opinions on the subject of divine inspiration in general, in particular on the Book of Job, Book of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Canticles. Simon's \"Réponse\" (1686) drew from Le Clerc a \"Defence des sentimens\" in the same year, which was followed by a new \"Réponse\" (1687).\n\nIn 1692 appeared his \"Logica sive Ars Ratiocinandi\", and also \"Ontologia et Pneumatologia\"; these, with the \"Physica sive de rebus corporeis\" (1696), are incorporated with the \"Opera Philosophica\", which have passed through several editions. In his \"Logica\", Le Clerc rewrites the Catholic Port-Royal \"Logique\" from a protestant Remonstrant perspective and supplements the \"Logique\" with analyses taken from \"Essay\" of his friend, John Locke.\nIn turn, Charles Gildon published a partial and unattributed translation of Le Clerc's \"Logica\" as the treatise \"Logic; or, The Art of Reasoning\" in the second (1712) and subsequent editions of John Brightland's \"Grammar of the English Tongue\".\nIn 1728, Ephraim Chambers used Gildon's translation of Le Clerc's version of the Port-Royal \"Logique\" as one of his sources when he compiled his \"Cyclopaedia\". John Mills and Gottfried Sellius later translated Chambers's \"Cyclopaedia\" into French. Their translation was appropriated by Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert as the starting point for their Encyclopédie. \nIn particular, the article on définition (1754) in the \"Encyclopédie\" can be traced through this chain of writers, editors, translators, and compilers to the Port-Royal \"Logique\" through the \"Logica\" of Jean Le Clerc.\n\nIn 1693 his series of Biblical commentaries began with that on the Book of Genesis; the series was not completed until 1731. The portion relating to the New Testament books included the paraphrase and notes of Henry Hammond. Le Clerc's commentary challenged traditional views and argued the case for inquiry into the origin and meaning of the biblical books, It was hotly attacked on all sides.\n\nHis \"Ars Critica\" appeared in 1696, and, in continuation, \"Epistolae Criticae et Ecclesiasticae\" in 1700. Le Clerc produced a new edition of the Apostolic Fathers of Cotelerius (Jean-Baptiste Cotelier, 1627-1686), published in 1698. He also edited journals of book notices and reviews: the \"Bibliothèque universelle et historique\" (Amsterdam, 25 vols, 1686-1693), begun with J. C. de la Croze; the \"Bibliothèque choisie\" (Amsterdam, 28 vols, 1703-1713); and the \"Bibliothèque ancienne et moderne\", (29 vols, 1714-1726).\n\nOther works were Le Clerc's \"Parrhasiana ou, Pensées diverses sur des matiéres de critique, d'histoire, de morale et de politique avec la défense de divers ouvrages de M. L. C. par Théodore Parrhase\" (Amsterdam, 1699); and \"Vita et opera ad annum MDCCXI, amici ejus opusculum, philosophicis Clerici operibus subjiciendum\", also attributed to himself. The supplement to Hammond's notes was translated into English in 1699, \"Parrhasiana, or Thoughts on Several Subjects\", in 1700, the Harmony of the Gospels in 1701, and \"Twelve Dissertations\" out of 211. Other works include the collected works of Erasmus, begun in 1703, and \"Harmonia evangelica\", 1700. One of his final works was his three-volume \"Histoire des Provinces-Unies des Pays Bas\", covering the history of the Dutch Republic up to the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht and published between 1723 and 1728.\n\n\n"}

It was established on 24 October 1975, and encompasses an area of . It is the largest park in Costa Rica and protects about a third of the Osa Peninsula. It is widely considered the crown jewel in the extensive system of national parks and biological reserves spread across the country. The ecological variety is quite stunning. National Geographic has called it \"the most biologically intense place on Earth in terms of biodiversity\". Not only is the park very popular with tropical ecologists, a visitor can expect to see an abundance of wildlife.\n\nThe park conserves the largest primary forest on the American Pacific coastline and one of the few remaining sizable areas of \"lowland\" tropical forests in the world. Historically, logging has taken place in lowland areas because those areas are more easily accessible and contain the largest and most economically valuable trees. But those habitats, which feature diverse vegetation, are also usually the richest in biodiversity. So even though approximately half the tropical forests on Earth remain, what is left of the originally rich lowland forests is usually in too small an area to support the original natural biodiversity. Larger animals, especially, need a large habitat free of human activity. Unfortunately this means that even tourism, the economic incentive for Costa Rica and other developing nations to preserve and protect parks such as Corcovado, actually threatens the long-term biodiversity of the park.\n\nWaters of the park are calm and rich in biodiversity. \"Cano Island Biological Reserve\" is one of featured reserves along the coasts. These coasts, such as at Drake Bay, are wintering and breeding grounds for the humpback whales that come each winter. Ballena National Marine Park is specially designed for this species. Other baleen whales also migrate through the area such as Bryde's whale. Dolphins such as spinner and rough-toothed, and smaller cetaceans such as false killer whales and killer whales are seasonal residents/migrants to these areas. Whale watchings for these species are also available. Manatees have been hunted historically in Costa Rica, resulting in today's small numbers left. These gentle mammals can be observed occasionally at areas like Manzanillo Beach, Talamanca, and Limon.\n\nCorcovado National Park is open to the public and can be visited on day trips and for overnight visits, as of February 1, 2014 all Corcovado visitors must be accompanied by certified professional guides. As of August 2014, admission is $15 per person per day for non-Costa Rican residents. Reservations for overnight visits in the park can be made in Puerto Jiménez on the east coast of the peninsula. One may camp (for a maximum of four days) or stay indoors at one of several ranger stations equipped with bunks. If one wants basic meals served, reservations should be made about a week in advance. Take note that researchers get preference over other visitors (though there is usually enough room for self-catering campers).\n\nOne can make day visits into the park from several lodging options on both the north and south entrances to the park, as well as through organized excursions that fly into the park. One can get to the Corcovado National Park via Puerto Jimenez or Drake Bay. These two towns serve as the main entry points to the park. There are two tracks, one coastal and one inland, and four ranger stations in the park where one can stay overnight; three at the park entrances and one at the intersection of the two tracks. One track runs Northwest to Southeast along the coast to La Leona ecolodge, with the Estación Sirena roughly in the middle. The second track runs inland from Estacion Sirena to Estación Los Patos at the Eastern end of the park. One can fly into the park (via chartered aircraft) to Estación Sirena, from where one can follow relatively short loop-trails. Carate (near Estacion La Leona), also has an airstrip and road access from Puerto Jimenez. To walk through the park one needs a reasonable fitness, at least two or three days (except on El Tigre trail which is a one-day hike), good planning and caution. During the wet months (July to November) parts of the park may be closed.\n\nOn February 5, 2015 a new trail into Corcovado was opened in Dos Brazos de Rio Tigre. Sendero El Tigre is the most accessible trail into Corcovado as it is possible to travel to and walk in one day. The trail is 5 miles/8 kilometers long and takes between six and eight hours; depending upon walking speeds and time taken to stop to view wildlife.\n\nOn the coastal track there are several rivers that need to be forded. These rivers can all be very dangerous if forded at high tide or if one is inexperienced in this kind of an environment. Rio Sirena is commonly regarded as the most dangerous of crossings, primarily because it flows directly into the massive Laguna Corcovado in the isolated heart of the park. Bull sharks are present within the river and can sometimes be seen at the river mouth during high tide. American crocodiles are also present within the river, but most are small and recent surveys indicate that the population may be much smaller than initially believed. Spectacled caiman are present further up river and within Laguna Corcovado in larger numbers. Rumors that large American crocodiles are present within Laguna Corcovado are false. The Rio Claro, which is approximately 40 minutes south of Rio Sirena, is said to be safer, although both appear to the naked eye as very similar in size. Small American crocodiles and spectacled caiman are also present within the Rio Claro, albeit in smaller numbers than Rio Sirena. Bull sharks are not believed to be present within the Rio Claro. Despite the presence of these predators, by far the greatest risk you will face while crossing any river is the strong current. Upstream Rio Claro is a popular night swimming spot amongst guides and their groups, therefore it is doubtful that attacks by crocodiles or sharks in this river are a concern. The Rio Madrigal, just north of the park entrance, is much smaller and may be home to spectacled caiman. \n\nThe inland track to Estación Los Patos goes through secondary growth for much of the way, but it is still a beautiful walk with a little more variation and it is easier walking with no sand and no sizable river crossings.\n\nCorcovado is home to a sizable population of the endangered Baird's tapir and even a small population of the very rare harpy eagle. The park's rivers and lagoons are home to populations of both the American crocodile and spectacled caiman, along with bull sharks. Corcovado is also one of the final strongholds of the jaguar within Central America and several other felines are also present, including ocelot, margay, jaguarundi, and puma. All four Costa Rican monkey species can be seen within the park, including the endangered Central American squirrel monkey, white-faced capuchin, mantled howler, and Geoffroy's spider monkey. Other mammals present include two-toed and three-toed sloth, collared peccary, northern tamandua and silky anteater. Poison dart frogs and several species of snake (including the venomous fer-de-lance and bushmaster) are also common within the park.\n\nThe elusive Jaguar is a large, beautiful and potentially intimidating feline but is generally regarded as shy and harmless. They are capable of taking down prey as large as Tapir but appear to be reclusive and uninterested in human activity.\nMost animal sightings can be expected on the coastal track, with scarlet macaws (the largest population in the country) flying overhead, hermit crabs on the beach, pelicans fishing in the sea and, on the sections that go slightly inland, spider monkeys (take care not to get urinated on when they are in a tree overhead), tamandua anteaters, pumas, white faced capuchin monkeys, lineated woodpeckers and coatis (to name just a few). With luck one might even spot a tapir, even though they are nocturnal. Corcovado is also a good place to spot the red-eyed tree frog, as well as the glass frog with its transparent skin, and the enamel-bright poison-arrow frogs. From Estación Sirena one can follow many short tracks, on which one can also take short night-strolls into the forest with a good chance of running into a tapir. They are impressive to see but harmless if left in peace. Jaguars are present and some individuals frequent the beach near Madrigal at night. One is very likely to see their tracks, sometimes very fresh and frequent, but very unlikely to see the actual cat. The most common animal in the park is by far the white-nosed coati, which one can expect to encounter dozens of times on the beach hike between La Leona and Sirena, digging for and feeding on the abundant moon crabs.\n\nOther animals in the park include Central American squirrel monkeys, mantled howler monkeys, both two-toed and three-toed sloths, agoutis, giant anteaters, great curassows, black hawks, spectacled owls, hummingbirds, 220 species of butterflies, golden orb spiders (who build huge webs), otters and raccoons. Four species of sea turtle (green, Pacific ridley, hawksbill, and leatherback) nest on the beaches.\n\nThe abundance in wildlife can in part be explained by the variety of vegetation types, at least 13, including montane forest (more than half the park), cloud forest, jolillo forest (palm swamp), prairie forest, alluvial plains forest, swamp forest, freshwater herbaceous swamp and mangrove, together holding over 500 tree species, including purple heart, poponjoche, nargusta, banak, cow tree, espave and crabwood. Another reason for the diversity (as with all of Costa Rica) is that it lies on a north-south corridor for flora and fauna; part of the \"land bridge\" and wildlife corridor that links the large continents of North America and South America. Corcovado has been merchandised worldwide as one of the places with greatest biodiversity on the planet. In 41800 hectares, Corcovado houses 3% of the world's biodiversity. Two decades ago the National Geographic Society defined it as the most biologically intense place in the world.\n\nBecause of the remoteness of the peninsula, logging started only in the 1960s. By 1975 there were plans for a major international logging operation. Researchers petitioned President Daniel Oduber to protect the area, which he did by making it a National Park. For this he received the Albert Schweitzer Award from the Animal Welfare Institute. The already present goldminers were allowed to stay. By 1986 their number had increased to about 1,000 (not counting their families), who also hunted the wildlife. It was decided to evict them. There is, however, still some illegal mining going on (using more destructive modern mining methods), considered the second invasion, there are about 400 miners currently. It is estimated that 38% of the park (16.000 hectares) have been exploited by gold miners. Illegal logging is not frequent, but the trees that are removed are scarce and essential to the ecosystem.\n\nIncreased tourism has led to an increased presence of humans in the park, which may threaten the long-term survival of the park's larger mammals. To help combat the threat of over-exposure, many agencies and other groups (including Conservation International, The Nature Conservancy, WWF–U.S., rain-forest conservation groups in several countries, Catholic Relief Service, Organization of American States, and the Costa Rican, Danish, Dutch, Swedish and United States governments) have come together to provide aid to the conservation cause.\n\n"}
{"id": "2329708", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2329708", "title": "Scissor doors", "text": "Scissor doors\n\nScissor doors (also called flap doors, wing doors, beetle-wing doors, turtle doors, switchblade doors, swing-up doors, Lamborghini doors, and Lambo doors) are automobile doors that rotate vertically at a fixed hinge at the front of the door, rather than outward as with a conventional door.\n\nThe first vehicle to feature scissor doors was the 1968 Alfa Romeo Carabo concept car, designed by Bertone's Marcello Gandini. The door style was dictated by Gandini's desire for an innovative design, and by his concern over the car's extremely poor rear visibility. In order to reverse the car, the driver would be able to lift the door and lean his upper body out of the hatch in order to see behind the car. The first production car to feature the doors was a Lamborghini, Gandini's Countach; the sports car's wide chassis created similar problems to those found on the Carabo, calling for the unusual door configuration. This sports car was quite impractical for real life, as due to unusual design it was impossible to backup without doors open wide. So, such doors were originally offered as a practical measure that helped the driver. Besides, traditional swing-open doors would make it more difficult to get out of the vehicle due to high door sills. The doors were used on the Countach's successor, the Diablo, on its replacement, the Murciélago, and on a low-production run derivative of the Murciélago called the Reventón. The Centenario is the latest Lamborghini car to feature the trademark doors. Having used the exotic door style for several of its cars, the Italian manufacturer has become synonymous with the implementation of scissor doors, which are sometimes colloquially referred to as \"Lambo doors\".\n\nToday many aftermarket companies are specialized in production of scissor door conversion kits for regular production cars that originally come with regular doors. A common scissor door conversion kit (also known as a \"Lambo-door\" kit) includes model specific redesigned door hinges and gas filled shocks. Such kits are usually bolt-on or weld on and require some modifications to front bumpers and door panels. Original door panels are not replaced, so a vehicle looks standard from the outside, when the doors are closed.\n\n\n\nThere are different types of scissor doors. The conventional type rotates to 90 degrees. Scissor doors can be powered and they usually are.\n\nVLS doors have a scissor door configuration. The biggest difference is that they are designed to initially open slightly outward before opening upward to allow the top edge of the door to clear the door frame and A-pillar. Although butterfly doors also move upwards and outwards, VLS doors are not the same as butterfly doors as VLS doors move outward only a small degree compared to butterfly doors.\n\nAlthough conventional scissor doors rotate to 90 degrees, some can rotate up to 130 degrees; these are commonly used for modified cars. Such scissor doors have the benefit of not obstructing the entrance or exit to the car as much as conventional scissor doors. VLS doors also can be made to rotate to 130 degrees.\n\nSome aftermarket example scissor doors are also designed so they can open either vertically (scissor door) or horizontally (conventional door), as the user chooses. Such doors allow the user to gain the benefits of both types of door, choosing to open the doors in whichever style is best suited to the situation.\n\n"}

One of the world's oldest professional football stadiums, it was built for Bury F.C. in 1885 and has been their home ever since. Currently, the ground is officially known for sponsorship reasons as the Energy Check Stadium but it will soon be renamed the Planet-U Energy Stadium following a deal signed by the club with Leeds-based Planet-U Energy on 19 February 2019.\n\nThe first match to be played at Gigg Lane was a friendly between Bury and Wigan on 12 September 1885, which Bury won 4–3. The first league game was a 4–2 victory over Manchester City on 8 September 1894 in the 1894–95 Football League Second Division. The stadium has had permanent floodlights since 1953, although the first floodlit match to be played there took place in 1889, before the Football League had authorised the use of floodlights in competitive matches.\n\nThe capacity of the ground was once 35,000 and this was achieved when the ground's record crowd attended Bury's FA Cup third round tie against Bolton Wanderers on 9 January 1960. The game ended 1–1 and Bury lost the replay after extra time 4–2. In 1986, Gigg Lane saw its lowest ever crowd of just 461 for a Freight Rover Trophy game against Tranmere Rovers. There has never been a league crowd below 1,000 although the closest to that mark came in 1984 with a crowd of 1,096 against Northampton Town. The highest all-seater attendance at Gigg Lane was recorded when Bury played Manchester City on 12 September 1997, with an attendance of 11,216.\n\nThe ground was renamed the JD Stadium in November 2013 after Bury announced a new sponsorship deal with JD Sports. The deal was ended in July 2015. In 2016 it was announced that the club was looking to build a new 15,000–20,000 capacity stadium in the borough of Bury. Since then, however, there has been a change of club ownership and a new stadium sponsorship deal (see below).\n\nOn 19 February 2019, it was announced that the ground is to be officially renamed the Planet-U Energy Stadium after Bury concluded a five-year sponsorship deal with the Leeds-based renewable energy supplier, Planet-U Energy. The stadium will be powered by 100 per cent renewable energy.\n\nThe stadium's official capacity is 12,500 (currently 11,840 due to segregation in the Les Hart Stand). The South Stand is the largest stand and it was renamed the \"Les Hart Stand\" in the summer of 2010.\nThe stand contains a pattern of blue and white seats that spell out \"\"SHAKERS\"\"\n\nAfter the Taylor Report forced all Football League clubs to switch to all-seater stadiums, the stadium began converting all four sides of the ground in 1993, with the Cemetery End being the final terraced section to be demolished in 1999. The East Stand on the rebuilt Cemetery End has a capacity of 2,500.\n\nThe Manchester Road End (capacity 2,100) was home to the club's electronic scoreboard (obtained from Leicester City's Filbert Street ground after it closed in 2002) until 2011. A new scoreboard was placed in the south-east corner of the ground a few months later.\n\nIn September 2015 a screen was installed in the right-hand side of the Les Hart Stand. On matchdays the club show advertisements, match highlights and the scoreline.\n\nIn November 2015, Bury announced that the Main Stand was to be renamed The Neville Neville Stand in honour of the late English cricketer and friend of the club, Neville Neville.\n\nTowards the end of the 2015–16 season, a fence was constructed between the Cemetery End and the Les Hart Stand in an attempt to stop the rise of hooliganism at the ground. This further separates home and away supporters but it has reduced the stadium's capacity with the consequent loss of 660 seats.\n\nManchester United and Bolton Wanderers have hosted reserve-team matches at the ground.\n\nF.C. United of Manchester shared the ground from the 2005–06 season until 2014. They moved into their own ground for the 2015–16 season. F.C. United set a club record attendance of 6,731 when they played Brighton and Hove Albion in the FA Cup on 8 December 2010.\n\nA couple of teams have moved their \"home\" games to the stadium, including Preston North End for a League Cup tie in 1994. Non-league sides Rossendale United and Radcliffe Borough moved home F.A. Cup ties to Gigg Lane against Bolton Wanderers (in 1971) and York City respectively.\n\nIn 1996, the stadium was used as the filming location for the TV film based on the Hillsborough disaster of 1989, where 96 Liverpool fans died as a result of a crush on the stadium's terraces. Hillsborough was seen as an unsuitable location for the film, partly to avoid causing further distress to survivors and bereaved families, and partly because the appearance of Gigg Lane was more akin to the 1989 Hillsborough than the actual stadium was seven years after the tragedy due to redevelopment.\n\nThe stadium has been used for many sports other than football, such as rugby league (Swinton Lions played at Gigg Lane between 1992 and 2002), cricket, baseball and lacrosse.\n"}

He signed as \"Escobar\", and is most famous for his creation \"Zipi y Zape\", as well as the character \"Carpanta\". He was also an author and a theater actor, as well as one of the pioneers of animation in Spain during the 1920s, and worked on early Spanish animated movies, such as \"La ratita que barría la escalerita\" (“The little rat who was sweeping the little flight of stairs”).\n\nEscobar grew up in Granollers (Barcelona), where his father worked in the post office. In the 1920s, Escobar began to work for Catalan periodicals such as \"Virolet\", \"La Gralla\", \"Diari de Granollers\", and \"Sigronet\", at the same time that he also secured a position in the post office, like his father. In the 1930s, he worked on other magazines, such as \"Papitu\", \"Pocholo\", \"TBO\", \"L'Esquello\", and \"L'Esquella de la Torratxa\".\n\nMember of a union of professional cartoonists, after the Spanish Civil War Escobar was relieved of his postal duties and imprisoned for a year and a half for these activities. He was released in 1940, though his movements were restricted. In prison, Escobar earned a little money drawing caricatures of his fellow prisoners under the pseudonym \"Rebec\" (the Catalan word for \"mischievous\").\n\nOutside from prison, he began working again in comic strips in 1944, and was one of the first collaborators in the magazine \"Pulgarcito\", first published in 1947. He created Zipi y Zape for \"Pulgarcito\" as well as the perpetually hungry Carpanta, a symbol of the misery in postwar Spain. For the magazine known as \"El Campeón\", he created in 1948 the gangsters \"Tres Pelos y Kid Pantera\". His series \"Doña Tula, suegra\" (1951) suffered censorship, due to its presentation of marriage as one problem after another.\n\nIn 1957, Escobar was one of the founders of the independent magazine \"Tío Vivo\", which would later become absorbed by Editorial Bruguera, which was responsible for \"Pulgarcito\" and other magazines, after which time Escobar created \"Filomeno y su taxi Genovevo\" (1963), \"Don Óptimo y Don Pésimo\" (1964) and \"Plim, el magno\" (1969). He continued to work, however, on developing the stories of Zipi y Zape and Carpanta. His characters Zipi y Zape got their own magazine in 1971.\n\nWith Editorial Bruguera's decline in the 1980s, he founded with other artists (such as Ibáñez) the new magazine \"Guai!\", published by Editorial Grijalbo, for which he created the characters \"Terre y Moto\", brothers based on Zipi y Zape. Escobar went back to drawing Zipi y Zape when Ediciones B acquired Bruguera, and continued work on this series until his death.\n\n"}
{"id": "2329720", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2329720", "title": "Matrigel", "text": "Matrigel\n\nMatrigel is the trade name for a gelatinous protein mixture secreted by Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) mouse sarcoma cells produced by Corning Life Sciences. Matrigel resembles the complex extracellular environment found in many tissues and is used by cell biologists as a substrate (basement membrane matrix) for culturing cells.\n\nA common laboratory procedure is to dispense small volumes of chilled (4 °C) liquid Matrigel onto plastic tissue culture labware. When incubated at 37 °C (body temperature) the Matrigel proteins polymerize (solidify) producing a gel that covers the labware's surface.\n\nCells cultured on Matrigel demonstrate complex cellular behavior that is otherwise difficult to observe under laboratory conditions. For example, endothelial cells create intricate spiderweb-like networks on Matrigel coated surfaces but not on plastic surfaces. Such networks are highly suggestive of the microvascular capillary systems that suffuse living tissues with blood. Hence, Matrigel allows them to observe the process by which endothelial cells construct such networks that are of great research interest.\n\nIn some instances researchers may prefer to use greater volumes of Matrigel to produce thick three-dimensional gels. Thick gels induce cells to migrate from the gel's surface to its interior. This migratory behavior is studied by researchers as a model of tumor cell metastasis.\n\nPharmaceutical scientists use Matrigel to screen drug molecules. A typical experiment consists of adding a test molecule to Matrigel and observing cellular behavior. Test molecules that promote endothelial cell network formation are candidates for tissue regeneration therapies whereas test molecules that inhibit endothelial cell network formation are candidates for anti-cancer therapies. Likewise, test molecules that inhibit tumor cell migration may also have potential as anti-cancer drugs. Matrigel is also commonly used to prepare human tumor xenografts in rodents as part of a cancer drug discovery program. Matrigel is mixed with immortalized human cancer cells and the mixture is injected subcutaneously in immunodeficient mice. A human tumor usually forms in two to four weeks. This model system allows a researcher to test an anti-cancer compound in a surrogate host.\n\nThe ability of Matrigel to stimulate complex cell behavior is a consequence of its heterogeneous composition. The chief components of Matrigel are structural proteins such as laminin, nidogen, collagen and heparan sulfate proteoglycans which present cultured cells with the adhesive peptide sequences that they would encounter in their natural environment. Also present are growth factors like TGF-beta and EGF that prevent differentiation and promote proliferation of many cell types. A growth-factor-reduced Matrigel is also available. Matrigel contains other proteins in small amounts and its exact composition can vary from lot to lot. For this reason, Matrigel may not be appropriate for experiments that require precise knowledge of all proteins and concentrations.\n\nMatrigel is also used as an attachment substrate in embryonic stem cell culture. When embryonic stem cells are grown in the absence of feeder cells, extracellular matrix components are needed to maintain the pluripotent, undifferentiated state (self-renewal). One of these matrices that can be used is diluted Matrigel. When used undiluted, Matrigel promotes stem cell growth and differentiation.\n\n"}
{"id": "2329727", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2329727", "title": "Henri Deterding", "text": "Henri Deterding\n\nHenri Wilhelm August Deterding Honorary KBE, (19 April 1866 – 4 February 1939) was one of the first executives of the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company and was its general manager for 36 years, from 1900 to 1936, and was also chairman of the combined Royal Dutch/Shell oil company. He succeeded the founder of Royal Dutch, Jean Baptiste August Kessler, when he died, and made Royal Dutch Shell a competitor to John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil and one of the world's largest petroleum companies. \n\nIn 1920 Deterding was made an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire, for services to Anglo-Dutch relations and for his work in supplying the Allies with petroleum during the First World War.\n\nDeterding was a bitter enemy of the Soviet Union and helped thousands of White Russian exiles.\n\nBorn in Amsterdam in 1866, the fourth child in a family of five, Deterding was the son of a master mariner who died when he was only six, leaving the family in straitened circumstances. However, he was educated up to the age of sixteen at the Higher Citizens' School in Amsterdam.\n\nAfter leaving school, Deterding took a clerical position in the Twentsche Bank, where he developed a remarkable aptitude for handling figures. To avoid the slow promotion of a banking career, he entered an examination for positions in the Netherlands Trading Society of the Dutch East Indies, gained first place, and was appointed to the company's Eastern staff. After some years with the firm, he began to work in the oil industry, which was then in its infancy.\n\nIn May 1896, at the age of thirty, Deterding took a job with the Royal Dutch Oil Company, working with the managing director, J. B. A. Kessler. At the time, Royal Dutch was not a major company, still struggling to make good, and Deterding was instrumental in piloting it through many difficulties. Kessler died in March, 1900, leaving instructions, put in writing shortly before his death, that he wished Deterding to take over from him as general manager.\nSoon gaining the nickname of \"the Napoleon of Oil\", Deterding was responsible for developing the tanker fleet that enabled Royal Dutch to compete with the Shell company of Marcus Samuel. He led Royal Dutch to several major mergers and acquisitions, including the merger with Samuel's \"Shell\" Transport and Trading Company in 1907 and the purchase of Azerbaijan oil fields from the Rothschild family in 1911. In the last years of his life, Deterding was controversial when he became an admirer of the German Nazi Party. In 1936, he discussed with them the sale of a year's oil reserves on credit; the next year, he was forced to resign from the position of general manager, but remained a member of the company's board.\n\nIn 1894, Deterding married firstly Catharina Neubronner, a Dutch woman, with whom he had two sons and a daughter. In 1924 he married secondly Lydia Pavlovna Koudoyaroff (1904–80), a daughter of the White Russian General Paul Koudoyaroff, who had been the mistress of his rival Calouste Gulbenkian, and they had two daughters, including the socialite Olga Deterding. After that marriage ended in divorce, at the age of seventy Deterding married finally Charlotte Mina Knack, a German who had been a secretary in the company, who later became a member of the Nazi Party, but there were no further children. During his second marriage, his English country house was Buckhurst Park at Winkfield in Berkshire, where Mrs Deterding continued to live with her two daughters after the divorce. \n\nThe British newspaper the \"Daily Mail\" mistakenly published Deterding's obituary on 27 June 1924, and the news was copied by \"The New York Times\" under the heading \"Henry Deterding dies at film show; Director General of the Royal Dutch Company Succumbs Suddenly in The Hague\". However, on that day the Dutch envoy in London, René de Marees van Swinderen, said in a letter to the Dutch foreign minister, Herman Adriaan van Karnebeek:\"P.S. I could not resist sending also herewith the obituary in the \"Daily Mail\" dedicated to Deterding, who happily is very much alive.\"\n\nIn 1936, Deterding bought the manor of Dobbin, near Krakow am See, in Mecklenburg, Germany, and moved there. He also had a property in St. Moritz, Switzerland, and was there when he died on 4 February 1939. His body was returned to Dobbin to be buried there, but in 1968 it was moved again, to a grave in Liechtenstein.\n\n"}

The public high school serves the neighborhoods of Pacific Palisades, Palisades Highlands, Kenter Canyon, and portions of Brentwood (including Brentwood Circle). Residents in Topanga, an unincorporated section of Los Angeles County, may attend Palisades or Taft High School.\n\nThe school serves grades 9 through 12. Formerly directly administered by the Los Angeles Unified School District school, the school is now an independent charter school. Its current enrollment numbers 2,903 students. Many students travel long distances to attend Palisades Charter High, which is one of the most highly ranked public high schools in the Los Angeles area.\n\nIn 2005, Palisades was recognized as a California Distinguished School. In 2015, Palisades was named one of America's Best High Schools by \"Newsweek\" and \"U.S. News & World Report\".\n\nPaul Revere Charter Middle School students are allowed to attend as a feeder school.\n\nThe school was founded in 1961. It was built for $6 million on a filled-in canyon. At the time it was the most expensive high school in the LA City Schools. The founding principal was Herbert L. Aigner (died in 2000). The Class of 2012 was the 50th graduating class. \n\nPrior to the founding, the property was called All Hallows Farm and for many years was owned by the Conway family: Hollywood film director Jack Conway; his wife, actress Virginia Conway — daughter of silent screen star Francis X. Bushman — and their two sons, one of whom, Pat Conway became an actor as well. This property was subsequently rented to actress Debbie Reynolds and her husband, singer Eddie Fisher. It was then taken, some years later, by the State by eminent domain to build the high school.\n\nSeveral members of the class of 1965 were profiled in a \"Time\" magazine article, which led to a best-selling 1976 book by class members David Wallechinsky and Michael Medved, \"What Really Happened to the Class of '65?\". The book featured interviews with several members of the class, whose experiences were recounted both individually and in groupings around shared themes such as the Vietnam War and the draft, drug experimentation, and sex. Various teachers from the school also were interviewed, among them English teachers Miss Jean O'Brien, history teacher Mr. Johnson, and Mrs. Rose \"Mama G\" Gilbert, who retired during 2012-2013 after 63 years of teaching. At age 94, Mrs. Gilbert was the oldest active teacher in the LAUSD. The success of the book later inspired a short-lived television dramatic anthology series of the same title, which ran from December 1977 to July 1978 on NBC. The character of Maz Kanata was based on her.\n\nIn 1989 \"20/20\" aired an episode about the students of Palisades High School. Howard Rosenberg of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote that \"Palisades High School is characterized here as both an institution of high academic performance and high drug and alcohol use. What \"20/20\" doesn't ask tonight is how both are possible at the same school.\"\n\nCirca 1992 there were so few students that LAUSD was considering closing the school. Pali High parents, principal Merle Price, and Pali High staff decided to advocate for making the school into a charter school. In 1993 the school, along with three feeder elementary schools, received approval from the Los Angeles Board of Education to become a charter school. This was the first time a group of schools in California became charter schools. The school asked students to abide by a behavior code and instituted new academic programs. By 1998 student enrollment recovered: it had 200 students previously attending private schools.\n\nThis school was the focus of a false email chain letter started around 2002. The message falsely claimed that a satiric message to parents about student truancies and homework problems was actually on the school's answering machine. The message was originally written in response to parent outrage that students who skipped class more than ten days per 90-schoolday semester (not counting legitimate absences, like sickness) could receive a failing grade in that class. This was reported on several web sites, including Snopes, and BreakTheChain.org.\n\nThe campus is bounded by Temescal Canyon Road to the east, Sunset Boulevard to the north, El Medio Street to the west, and Temescal Academy (formerly known as first Temescal Canyon Continuation School and later Temescal High School) to the south.

Hannah\n\nJohn Alfred Hannah (October 9, 1902 – February 23, 1991) was president of Michigan State College (later Michigan State University) for 28 years (1941-1969), making him the longest serving of MSU's presidents. He is credited with transforming the school from a regional undergraduate college into a large national research institution. After his resignation from the university, Hannah became head of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).\n\nA native of Grand Rapids, Hannah was most noted for expanding Michigan State from a respected regional undergraduate-oriented institution into a comprehensive national research university, and for helping to get Michigan State into the Big Ten Conference. He was also the first chairman of the United States Commission on Civil Rights.\n\nHannah became president of Michigan State College in 1941. He thus began the largest expansion in the school's history, with the help of the 1945 G.I. Bill, which helped World War II veterans get an education. During this time the university grew by leaps and bounds to accommodate an ever-growing influx of students. One of Hannah's strategies was to build a new residence hall, enroll enough students to fill it, and use the income to start construction on a new dormitory. Under Hannah's plan, enrollment increased from 15,000 in 1950 to 38,000 in 1965.\n\nWhile he worked on increasing the size of M.S.C.'s student body, Hannah also expanded the institution from a college of regional reputation into a nationally recognized research university. When the University of Chicago eliminated its athletics and resigned from what is now the Big Ten Conference in 1946, Hannah lobbied hard to take its place. The Big Ten finally admitted M.S.C. in 1950. Five years later, on the College's centennial year of 1955, the State of Michigan made it a university. In 1957 he continued M.S.U.'s expansion co-founding Michigan State University–Oakland (now Oakland University) with Matilda Dodge Wilson. The Hannah Hall of Science on Oakland University's campus is named for him. Michigan State University continued to expand throughout the 1960s, completing its newest dormitory in 1967. None have been built since.\n\nBy 1969, Vietnam-era protests had completely reshaped the university. Much of the controversy surrounded Hannah and the University's involvement in Vietnam with the Michigan State University Group (MSUG). Hannah was accused of being responsible for allowing the CIA to involve itself in MSUG. Hannah resigned to become the head of USAID.\n\nThe John A. Hannah Distinguished Professorship at Michigan State University was established in 1966.\n\nAs part of its sesquicentennial celebration, MSU erected a 7-foot bronze statue of Hannah in front of his namesake administration building on September 17, 2004, sculpted by California artist Bruce Wolfe.\n\n"}

It is sometimes paired with angiogenesis, as the first stage of the formation of the vascular network, closely followed by angiogenesis.\n\nIn the sense distinguished from angiogenesis, vasculogenesis is different in one aspect: whereas angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones, vasculogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels, in blood islands, when there are no pre-existing ones. For example, if a monolayer of endothelial cells begins sprouting to form capillaries, angiogenesis is occurring. Vasculogenesis, in contrast, is when endothelial precursor cells (angioblasts) migrate and differentiate in response to local cues (such as growth factors and extracellular matrices) to form new blood vessels. These vascular trees are then pruned and extended through angiogenesis.\n\nVasculogenesis occurs during embryologic development of the circulatory system. Specifically, around blood islands, which first arise in the mesoderm of the yolk sac at 3 weeks of development.\n\nVasculogenesis can also occur in the adult organism from circulating endothelial progenitor cells (derivatives of stem cells) able to contribute, albeit to varying degrees, to neovascularization.

Ó Duilearga prescribed a guideline for gathered oral tradition, for example, insisting that the collected data identified the informant's name and age as well as provenance of material. The Society would not only edit and publish the collected folklore, but endeavor to supply a translation or at least a summary in English or some suitable language. It was a call for the preservation of Irish folklore, and his countrymen heeded the appeal by sending in manuscripts to the Society, and these material would be published in the \"Béaloideas\" periodical.\n\nPublic sentiment mounted that such a grave undertaking should not be left entirely to a voluntary society, and the Irish government established the \"Institiúid Bhéaloideas Éireann\" (The Irish Folk Institute) in 1930, to be headed by Ó Duilearga, with other board members of An Cumann recruited alongside.\n\nA few years later in 1935, the Irish Folklore Commission (\"Coimisiún Béaloideasa Éireann\") was formed by the government when its precursor was deemed inadequate, and a larger larger organization which was better equipped felt needed. Ó Duilearga was appointed honorary director of the Commission, and led its effort.\n\nThe Commission continued its work by that name until 1971 when it was superseded by the Department of Irish Folklore the University College, Dublin. The Department has since served as a repository of the data collected, including the Irish Folklore Collection, which later became the National Folklore Collection, at the UCD Delargy Centre for Irish Folklore and the National Folklore Collection.\n\nThe Commission was responsible for the collection of preservation of Irish folk tradition of all forms, with the additional tasks of catalogueing the material under classification, their study and exposition.\n\nWith funding at a limit, the Commission was often limited to six to nine collectors. While graduate and university students could be of great help as collectors, the Commission was focused on Ireland's diverse populations. They went to fisherman, primary teachers, as well as professional collectors with the idea that \"anyone who does go among the people must go among them as one of themselves and have no high-faluting nonsense about them\".\n\nThe Irish Folklore Commission also made an effort to collect folk music and song. Ó Duilearga professed to not being very musically oriented, and the commission hired Liam de Noraidh as full-time collector, until he had to resign in 1942 due to poor health, and replaced by Séamus Ennis, who used the Ediphone recording devise extensively.\n\nThe Commission was also closely involved with locals, especially Irish-speaking districts. They distributed questionnaires and used media outlets to inform the general public of the Commission. The commission also began making recordings in 1948 of the dwindling number of native speakers of Manx Gaelic on the Isle of Man,\n\nDuring its time, the extensive collecting by the Commission caught the attention of many foreign scholars. With greater recognition, Ó Duilearga's vision for the Commission grew and around the 1950s many scholars were participating by contributing to collections and research.\n\nThe commission owned a substantial collection of Ediphone recordings on cylinders, obtained through purchases (e.g. the Fr. Luke Donnellan folksong collection, acquired 1939) or from full-time music collectors by the time Ennis was hired in 1942, and he began by transcribing them onto paper, later using the Ediphone as recording instrument for field work, some time between 1943 and 1944 perhaps (the circumstances are unclear). The device, despite its shortcomings, did help them to collect lyrics more efficiently. \n\nThe Ediphone was also used to record long folktales, although it could not be utilized in some cases, for example, some of the reciters were uncomfortable in its presence. The Ediphone was also prodigiously heavy, and together with a supply of cylinders, was cumbersome carrying across rough terrain. The Commission could not afford a constant fresh supply of cylinders, so the recordings had to be reused and overwritten after being transcribed.\n\nÓ Duilearga had since the very beginning harbored the design of using the gramophone as recording device, since each vinyl disc was not more durable and far more afforadable than the Ediphone wax cylinders. The problem of the machine's cost, some $500, was obviated when the Edison Company made a present of it free of charge, and the gramophone arrived at the Commission in June 1940. Unfortunately, the Commission at this time was unable to adapt the device for field work, and as WWII had already started, it was also difficult procuring parts from America or England. It would not be until 1947 that the Commission would figure out how to use the gramohphone for collecting folklore in the field. The Commission decided to purchase the necessary sets of mobile recording equipment on its meagre budget, if only to carry out the project of recording the remnants of the Manx language (1948). This had been something of a pet project of Éamon de Valera's, though the politician had been rather sluggish in responding to the pleas of a budget for the proper equipment.\n\nAmong the Irish Folklore Commission's collections are written interviews recorded between 1937 and 1939. Known collectively as \"The School's Collection\", these interviews were conducted by more than 50,000 school children from all primary schools in the South of Ireland. The 1,128 volumes include written accounts are sorted of daily life as well as regional folklore and stories as told by the interviewees. This was instigated by Seán Ó Súilleabháin and Séamus Ó Duilearga, who publicized the scheme and explained to teachers what folklore was and how to properly collect it. They met with principal teachers, who then explained to the children how to collect the folklore for the collection. From September to June, each week the teacher would choose a heading and read out the questions, and the children would copy it down and question their family members and neighbors. In June 1939, Ó Duilearga stated in his annual report that there were collectively 375,660 pages of books from the schools.\n\nThe Dúchas Project was founded by Falls Community Council in 1999, in order to collect experiences and stories of conflict. They imagined it as a tool for learning and conflict resolution in the future. \n\nThe Dúchas Project is an online crowdsourcing effort to digitize and transcribe the National Folklore Collection in order to make it accessible and searchable worldwide. Based online, the project includes (1) both digitized and transcribed volumes of the collection; (2) a search feature to find people, topics, and places mentioned in the collections; (4) an index of Irish surnames, and (5) numerous historical photographs.\n\nTranscriptions of the collection are crowdsourced from around the world, and volunteers transcribe pages from the journal, allowing each page transcribed to become searchable from within the page itself and via internet search databases.\n\n\n\n"}

At that time, the island was approximately [50 m²] in size and only 2.5 metres above the waters of Lake Superior. In 1870, the site was developed by Alexander H. Sibley's Silver Islet Mining Company which built wooden breakwaters around the island to hold back the lake's waves and increased the island's area substantially with crushed rock. The islet was expanded to over 10 times its original size and a small mining town was built up on the shore nearby.\n\nAfter most of the purest ore from the original site had been removed, a second vein was discovered in 1878. By 1883, most of the highest quality silver had been extracted and the price of silver had declined. The final straw came when a shipment of coal did not arrive before the end of the shipping season. The pumps holding back the waters of the lake stopped and in early 1884 the islet's mine shafts, which had reached a depth of 384 metres, were flooded. They would never be de-watered, and the mine's underground operations would never be reopened.\n\nOver the 16 years that the mine was in operation, $3.25 million worth of silver was extracted.\n\nThe houses originally built to house miners are now used as private summer cottages. The general store has been restored, and serves light meals in its tea-room, in addition to selling a variety of knickknacks and basic foodstuffs.\n\nThis is an article written by Syd Hancock, January 21, 1972 on the occasion of Julian Cross's death.\n\nAs recounted by Syd Hancock, Silver Islet is the home of Julian (Jules) Cross, founder of Steep Rock Iron Mine in Atikokan, Ontario. Outside the Atikokan Library & museum is a bronze plaque erected by the Ontario Department of Public Records and Archives to mark the historical significance of the Steep Rock Iron Range. On December 29, 1971, the man who unveiled this plaque, and made possible the Steep Rock story, Julian Gifford Cross, died at the age of 83. Born at Silver Islet on July 25, 1888, only four years after the closing of that historic silver mine, his destiny and the future of many others was inevitably associated with mining.\n\nSleeping Giant Provincial Park has an excellent exhibit in its visitor centre, detailing the structure and history of the mine.\n\nThere is speculation that much silver remains to be recovered at this location, but attempts to reopen the mine in 1919 and the 1970s (reprocessing mine tailings) were not successful.\n\nThe Silver Islet Mine was also where \"Vanners\" were first used commercially to extract metal from low-grade ore. Known as the \"Frue Vanner\" as it was named for W. B. Frue, Superintendent of the Silver Islet Mine, who developed the system, it was first installed at the \"Stamp Mill\" beside \"Frue's Brook\" on the mainland. Modern versions of the Frue Vanner are still in use today.\n\nSilver Islet, specifically the missing coal shipment in 1883, is the subject of the Tanglefoot song \"One More Night\".\n\nSilver Islet is featured as the hometown of Sara, a waitress, in Jane Urquhart's novel \"The Underpainter\".\n\nA miner's perspective is the subject of the song \"Silver Islet\" by Canadian band Poor Angus, on their \"Gathering\" album.\n\nSilver Islet is featured in the song \"My Hometown\" by Burnz n Hell. The song is a tribute to Thunder Bay uploaded to the website Youtube in 2008.\n\nSilver Islet and its history are mentioned in the novel \"The Lightkeepers Daughters\" by Jean E. Pendziwol.\n\n\n\n"}

It now operates primarily as a mining museum. The caves are part of a Natural England designated Site of Special Scientific Interest and the notification includes parts of Clearwell along with Old Bow, Lambsquay and Old Ham mine complexes.\n\nClearwell Caves are a collection of six mines; Clearwell, Old Ham, Lambsquay, Old Bow, Oak Pit, New Dunn. The interconnected cave systems were formed by underground streams from around 180 million years ago. They have been mined originally for ochre, then for iron ore from Iron Age times Circa 100BC increasing from Roman times and extensively in the last century, which considerably enlarged and extended the network of natural caverns. Ochre has been mined here for even longer.\n\nThe nearby scowles at the Secret Forest and Puzzlewood represent shallow surface mines which have been exposed from above and later became entrances to the deeper mines.\n\nClearwell Caves are still worked intermittently to produce coloured ochres for use as natural pigments. These are washed and milled for sale in the mine's own shop. A range of ochre colours are available, from golden yellow to English Reds. Clearwell is also known as one of the few locations where the rare purple ochre may be found.\n\nNine well lit chambers have been made easily accessible to the visitors, with displays throughout. There is a small museum, shop and café. A network of much deeper chambers can be visited in the presence of an experienced guide and with appropriate caving equipment for safety. The upper caves are open to the general public.\n\nParts of the caves were originally opened to the public by Ray Wright (1930-1995) from 1968 and are now managed by his son Jonathan Wright. The caves have been used as a Santa's Grotto at Christmas time for many years, for easter egg hunts and in the summer barbecues, concerts and theatrical performances. One chamber is large enough to permit underground functions, including an annual Halloween Party hosting over 300 people. Parts of the \"Doctor Who\" episodes \"The Christmas Invasion\" (2005), \"The Satan Pit\" (2006) and \"Time of Angels\" / \"Flesh and Stone\" (2010) were filmed in the caves. All the underground scenes of the BBC series \"Merlin\", were filmed in the Caves. The caves have also long been used for filming science fiction scenes, such as in \"Blake's 7\". The caves featured substantially in the children's series \"The Changes\", \"The Jensen Code\" and \"Kidnapped\" among many others. More recently the caves have been featured in episodes of Britannia and His Dark Materials.\n\nClaims of paranormal phenomena at the caves have been made over the years. These include reports of the sound of metal clanging in the distance and reported sightings of an old miner and the sound of footsteps and pick axes working.\n\nThe caves were featured in an episode of \"Words and Pictures\" presented by Michael Hobbs featuring the letter U and the book \"Under the Stairs\" by Fiona Dunbar.\n\nOld Bow And Old Ham Mines\n\n"}

He is generally credited with the development of the first sailing canoes and with popularising canoeing as a sport in Europe and the United States. He founded the British Royal Canoe Club (RCC) in 1866 becoming its first Captain and also founded American Canoe Association in 1880.\n\nMacGregor worked as a barrister in London, and was an accomplished artist who drew all the illustrations in his travel books.\nMacGregor was born in Gravesend to Major Duncan MacGregor, a Scottish soldier, and Elizabeth, the daughter of a Baronet. When he was two weeks old, he was amongst the survivors of the sinking of Kent (1820 EIC ship). His schooling followed his father's postings, and he attended The King's School in Canterbury and Trinity College in Dublin. He graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge, having shown a talent for mathematics. He was known by his peers for his strong Christian faith and although he had aspired to be a missionary and also considered civil engineering, his scientific interests led him to London to study for the Bar, specialising in patent law. During his time in the capital, he became heavily involved with philanthropy and was instrumental in launching the Ragged School movement's Shoeblack brigade. He also became involved with open air missions and was also able to follow his passion for travel. In 1849 he spent nine months exploring southern Europe, Palestine and Egypt. He was introduced to canoeing during a trip to the United States and Canada in 1858.\n\nMacGregor was a champion marksman but turned to boating when a railway accident left him unable to hold a rifle steady.\nThe boat he designed was a 'double-ended' kind of canoe inspired by the Northern American kayaks, but built in Lambeth of lapstrake oak planking, decked in cedar covered with rubberised canvas with an open cockpit in the center. It measured 15 feet long, 28 inches wide, nine inches deep and weighed 80 pounds (36 kg) and was designed to be used with a double-bladed paddle. \nHe named the boat \"Rob Roy\" after the celebrated Scottish outlaw of the same name, to whom he was related.\n\nDuring the 1860s, he had at least seven similar boats built and he sailed and paddled them in Europe, the Baltic and the Middle East. One of those canoes is now based at the National Maritime Museum Cornwall.\n\nThe version he used for his expedition to Egypt, Syria and Palestine in 1868/69 was slightly smaller but was designed so that he could sleep in it. He was accompanied by a dragoman, Hany, and two retainers who maintained the various base camps on the journey. He visited the Nile Delta, the rivers of Damascus, as well as parts of the River Jordan and Kishon River. Whilst exploring the water courses above Lake Hula he was taken prisoner by villagers from Al-Salihiyya who lifted both him and the Rob Roy canoe out of the river whilst he kept them at bay with his paddle. He was responsible for the first scientific survey of the area.\n\nIn 1866, he published \"A Thousand Miles in the Rob Roy Canoe\", which popularised the design and, more importantly, the concept: \"\"in walking you are bounded by every sea and river, and in a common sailing-boat you are bounded by every shallow and shore; whereas, ...a canoe [can] be paddled or sailed, or hauled, or carried over land or water\"\".\n\nThe book was internationally successful; with subsequent books and public appearances, it earned MacGregor more than ten thousand pounds. Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson's 1876 voyage by canoe through the canals and rivers of France and Belgium, published in 1878 as \"An Inland Voyage\", used \"Rob Roy\" canoes.\n\nDied 1892 in Bournemouth.\n\n\n\n"}

Zeiss projectors are designed to sit in the middle of a dark, dome-covered room and project an accurate image of the stars and other astronomical objects on the dome. They are generally large, complicated, and imposing machines.\n\nThe first Zeiss Mark I projector (the first planetarium projector in the world) was installed in the Deutsches Museum in Munich in August, 1923. It possessed a distinctive appearance, with a single sphere of projection lenses supported above a large, angled \"planet cage\". Marks II through VI were similar in appearance, using two spheres of star projectors separated along a central axis that contained projectors for the planets. Beginning with Mark VII, the central axis was eliminated and the two spheres were merged into a single, egg-shaped projection unit.\n\nThe Mark I was created in 1923–1924 and was the world's first modern planetarium projector. The Mark II was developed during the 1930s by Carl Zeiss AG in Jena. Following WWII division of Germany and the founding of Carl Zeiss (West Germany) in Oberkochen (while the original Jena plant was located in East Germany), each factory developed its own line of projectors..\n\nMarks III – VI were developed in Oberkochen (West Germany) from 1957–1989. Meanwhile, the East German facility in Jena developed the ZKP projector line. The Mark VII was developed in 1993 and was the first joint project of the two Zeiss factories following German reunification.\n\n, Zeiss currently manufactures three main models of planetarium projectors. The flagship Universarium models continue the \"Mark\" model designation and use a single \"starball\" design, where the fixed stars are projected from a single egg-shaped projector, and moving objects such as planets have their own independent projectors or are projected using a full-dome digital projection system. The Starmaster line of projectors are designed for smaller domes than the Universarium, but also use the single starball design. The Skymaster ZKP projectors are designed for the smallest domes and use a \"dumbbell\" design similar to the Mark II-VI projectors, where two smaller starballs for the northern and southern hemispheres are connected by a truss containing projectors for planets and other moving objects.\n\nBetween 1923 and 2011, Zeiss manufactured a total of 631 projectors. Therefore, the following table is highly incomplete.\n\n\n"}

It was built in 1950 and in 1965 named after abolitionist Frederick Douglass. In 2007, the bridge was used by 77,000 daily commuters.\n\nThe bridge opened on January 14, 1950 as the South Capitol Street Bridge, though it had previously been called the Victory Bridge by Captain H.C. Whitehurst, the District Director of Highways, because it was the first project started after the war ended. At the time it was the longest bridge in the District of Columbia and one of the longest swing bridges in the world. Work on the bridge began in 1945, being advertised 2 weeks after World War II ended, but was stalled in 1947 for four months while the District asked Congress for more money. \n\nWhat to name the bridge had been a question since before it opened, with people all over the world sending in suggestions. The leading ideas in 1950 were FDR, Theodore Roosevelt, George Washington and Herbert Hoover and Frederick Douglass. One idea suggested in 1950 was Walter Johnson, which would have been prescient since the baseball stadium would be built at the foot of the bridge more than 50 years later. But it was only Douglass who was the subject of an organized movement that submitted a petition with 250 names. It took 14 years, but in 1964 the D.C. Federation of Civic Associations requested that the bridge be named the Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge and on October 18, 1965 the District's Commissioners voted to name it so, making it both one of the first major bridges named for an African-American or a former slave.\n\nThe bridge connects at its southern terminus with Interstate 295 and the Suitland Parkway and thus provides access to downtown from those routes as well as from South Capitol Street and roads connecting to it. As a result, the bridge carries commuter traffic from Prince George's County, Maryland, and from Southern Maryland. The bridge is part of the National Highway System, as are South Capitol Street north of the bridge and the Suitland Parkway.\n\nThe bridge provides a gateway to a former industrial part of the city that was heavily developed in the early 21st century, including the area around the new Nationals Park for the Washington Nationals, which opened March 30, 2008.\n\nThe bridge was re-decked and widened in 1975–1978 to repair damage, build new approaches and to create room for a 5th lane that would be bus-only in the rush hour direction. The work also narrowed the sidewalks. In 1988, the swing gate was replaced and as a result of closures the bus-only lane became an all-user lane again. In 2007, the bridge was closed from July 6 to August 29 for a $27 million renovation project meant to extend its life for 20 years. The northernmost portion of the bridge was lowered to become an at‑grade roadway with a new intersection at South Capitol Street and Potomac Avenue. Nearly three blocks of elevated roadway, which blocked access across South Capitol Street, were removed and replaced with at‑grade intersections that will help knit the neighborhood together. The deck was once again replaced and resurfaced, and new street lights and guard rails were added.\n\nDespite these repairs, the bridge continued to deteriorate faster than maintenance could keep up. Inspectors found that the bridges beams had large corrosion holes in its structural beams which necessitated complete replacement of the bridge.\n\nIn late 2012, officials announced a $906 million plan to replace and realign the bridge. The project will build new interchanges between the bridge and Suitland Parkway, the bridge and Potomac Avenue SW, Suitland Parkway and Interstate 295, and Suitland Parkway and Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue. The current four-lane bridge will be replaced with a $573.8 million six-lane bridge. A traffic circle with a large field (to be used for public gatherings, and suitable for several new memorials) will connect the north end of the bridge with Potomac Avenue SW. A second massive traffic oval on the south end of the bridge will help connect it to Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue, and help expand the city's \"monumental core\" into Anacostia. Reconstruction of the two interchanges was estimated to cost $209.2 million. The remainder of the budgeted funds will help renovate New Jersey Avenue SE and turn South Capitol Street from an industrial corridor into an urban boulevard. The two-year project was to begin in 2013.\n\nAn initial bridge design was submitted to the National Capital Planning Commission and the United States Commission of Fine Arts in summer 2013. The CFA rejected the design in September, called it \"uninspired\". The agency asked for a design with a more \"contemporary approach\" and \"bolder look\".\n\nOn January 29, 2014, the District of Columbia Department of Transportation (DDOT) announced the four construction teams that will be asked to solicit final bids on the bridge demolition and construction:\n\nThe cost of the bridge (which included demolition and construction of the bridge and traffic ovals, but not the Suitland Parkway interchange) was now pegged at $608 million. The new bridge also required the removal of , the Washington Navy Yard's deteriorating museum ship, which would have been landlocked by construction of the new span. Mayor Muriel Bowser budgeted $512.7 million over six years, beginning in fiscal 2016, to begin building the bridge.\n\nOn August 7, 2017, DDOT chose South Capitol Bridge Builders as the contractor team to design and build the new bridge and ovals. The bridge will have six lanes as well as bicycle and pedestrian access, and cost $441 million. South Capitol Bridge Builders estimated that, if all goes well, construction should be finished in December 2021.\n\nDDOT unveiled a new design for the bridge on August 10, 2017. The design is for a long suspension bridge consisting of three sets of parallel white arches. The bridge will have six traffic lanes, and a joint bicycle-pedestrian path on either side of the bridge deck. At both ends of the bridge there will be an esplanade run under the bridge and along the Anacostia River as well as a community park. If the design is approved, the bridge will be the biggest public works project in the history of the District of Columbia, and employ more than 1,300 workers at the height of construction. The federal government will contribute more than $200 million towards the bridge's $441 million cost.\n\nDDOT also said that it hoped to begin work on the bridge in 2018, to help commemorate the bicentennial of Fredrick Douglass' birth.\n\n"}

He consolidated his riders' training and hired staff to manage their coaching and racing.\nDespite not having a racing background, he nurtured ONCE to become one of the biggest teams. His riders included Frenchman Laurent Jalabert and Swiss Alex Zülle; both dominated the Vuelta a España, each winning the general and other classifications. In 1995 Jalabert achieved the trifecta by winning the general classification along with the points and King of the Mountains.\n\nSaiz's next riders included Spaniard Abraham Olano, Igor González de Galdeano and Joseba Beloki. ONCE dominated team time trials in the Tour de France.\n\nAt the end of the 2003 ONCE discontinued sponsorship, saying penetration was 100% in Spain, meaning every Spaniard knew what ONCE was. Saiz brought Liberty Seguros (the Spanish branch of the US company Liberty Mutual) and Würth, a German assembly technology company to be co-sponsor.\n\nDuring the turmoil of the Festina affair during the 1998 Tour de France Saiz withdrew the ONCE-Deutsche Bank team.\n\nOn 17 June 1999 The organisers of the 1999 Tour de France took the unprecedented step of banning teams, team officials and individual riders in the aftermath of the Festina affair. This included both Saiz and Dr Nicolas Terrados team doctor of Team ONCE. The ban was in relation to the actions and behaviour of these teams and riders during the 1998 Tour when Saiz withdrew his riders and said: \nRichard Virenque's lawyers depended on a clause in the UCI's rules, number 1.2.048, which says that tour organisers must say at least 30 days before a race whom they wished to admit. The Tour had not done so. The UCI also obliged the Tour to accept Saiz.\n\nOn 23 May 2006, Saiz was arrested in connection with the Operación Puerto scandals. He resigned and his company, Active Bay, was stripped of its ProTour license, which was awarded to the company backing Astana Team.\n\nSaiz was cleared of damaging public health and managed a restaurant and wedding catering business in his home region of Cantabria for several years. In August 2013, he expressed an interest in returning to cycling.\n"}
{"id": "2329860", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2329860", "title": "Agreement (linguistics)", "text": "Agreement (linguistics)\n\nAgreement or concord (abbreviated ) happens when a word changes form depending on the other words to which it relates. It is an instance of inflection, and usually involves making the value of some grammatical category (such as gender or person) \"agree\" between varied words or parts of the sentence.\n\nFor example, in Standard English, one may say \"I am\" or \"he is\", but not \"I is\" or \"he am\". This is because the grammar of the language requires that the verb and its subject agree in \"person\". The pronouns \"I\" and \"he\" are first and third person respectively, as are the verb forms \"am\" and \"is\". The verb form must be selected so that it has the same person as the subject in contrast to notional agreement, which is based on meaning. For instance, in American English the phrase \"the United Nations\" is treated as singular for purposes of agreement even though it is formally plural.\n\nAgreement generally involves matching the value of some grammatical category between different constituents of a sentence (or sometimes between sentences, as in some cases where a pronoun is required to agree with its antecedent or referent). Some categories that commonly trigger grammatical agreement are noted below.\n\nAgreement based on grammatical person is found mostly between verb and subject. An example from English (\"I am\" vs. \"he is\") has been given in the introduction to this article.\n\nAgreement between pronoun (or corresponding possessive adjective) and antecedent also requires the selection of the correct person. For example, if the antecedent is the first person noun phrase \"Mary and I\", then a first person pronoun (\"we/us/our\") is required; however, most noun phrases (\"the dog\", \"my cats\", \"Jack and Jill\", etc.) are third person, and are replaced by a third person pronoun (\"he/she/it/they\" etc.).\n\nAgreement based on grammatical number can occur between verb and subject, as in the case of grammatical person discussed above. In fact the two categories are often conflated within verb conjugation patterns: there are specific verb forms for first person singular, second person plural and so on. Some examples:\n\nAgain as with person, there is agreement in number between pronouns (or their corresponding possessives) and antecedents: \n\nAgreement also occurs between nouns and their specifier and modifiers, in some situations. This is common in languages such as French and Spanish, where articles, determiners and adjectives (both attributive and predicative) agree in number with the nouns they qualify:\n\nIn English this is not such a common feature, although there are certain determiners that occur specifically with singular or plural nouns only:\n\nIn languages in which grammatical gender plays a significant role, there is often agreement in gender between a noun and its modifiers. For example, in French:\nSuch agreement is also found with predicate adjectives: \"l'homme est grand\" (\"the man is big\") vs. \"la chaise est grande\" (\"the chair is big\"). (However, in some languages, such as German, this is not the case; only attributive modifiers show agreement.)\n\nIn the case of verbs, gender agreement is less common, although it may still occur. For example, in the French compound past tense, the past participle agrees in certain circumstances with the subject or with an object (see \"passé composé\" for details). In Russian and most other Slavic languages, the form of the past tense agrees in gender with the subject.\n\nThere is also agreement in gender between pronouns and antecedents. Examples of this can be found in English (although English pronouns principally follow natural gender rather than grammatical gender):\nFor more detail see Gender in English.\n\nIn languages that have a system of cases, there is often agreement by case between a noun and its modifiers. For example, in German:\nIn fact, the modifiers of nouns in languages such as German and Latin agree with their nouns in number, gender and case; all three categories are conflated together in paradigms of declension.\n\nCase agreement is not a significant feature of English (only personal pronouns and the pronoun \"who\" have any case marking). Agreement between such pronouns can sometimes be observed:\n\nA rare type of agreement that phonologically copies parts of the head rather than agreeing with a grammatical category. For example, in Bainouk:\n\n\"katama-ŋɔ in-ka / katama-ā-ŋɔ in-ka-ā\"\n\n\"river-prox. this / river-pl-prox. these\"\n\nIn this example, what is copied is not a prefix, but rather the initial syllable of the head \"river\".\n\nLanguages can have no conventional agreement whatsoever, as in Japanese or Malay; barely any, as in English; a small amount, as in spoken French; a moderate amount, as in Greek or Latin; or a large amount, as in Swahili.\n\nModern English does not have a particularly large amount of agreement, although it is present.\n\nApart from verbs, the main examples are the determiners “this” and “that”, which become “these” and “those” respectively when the following noun is plural:\n\nAll regular verbs (and nearly all irregular ones) in English agree in the third-person singular of the present indicative by adding a suffix of either \"-s\" or \"-es\". The latter is generally used after stems ending in the sibilants \"sh\", \"ch\", \"ss\" or \"zz\" (e.g. \"he rushes\", \"it lurches\", \"she amasses\", \"it buzzes\".)\n\nPresent tense of \"to love\":\nThere are not many irregularities in this formation:\n\nThe highly irregular verb \"to be\" is the only verb with more agreement than this in the present tense.\n\nPresent tense of \"to be\":\nIn English, defective verbs generally show no agreement for person or number, they include the modal verbs: \"can\", \"may\", \"shall\", \"will\", \"must\", \"should\", \"ought\".\n\nIn Early Modern English agreement existed for the second person singular of all verbs in the present tense, as well as in the past tense of some common verbs. This was usually in the form \"-est\", but \"-st\" and \"-t\" also occurred. Note that this does not affect the endings for other persons and numbers.\n\nExample present tense forms: \"thou wilt\", \"thou shalt\", \"thou art\", \"thou hast\", \"thou canst\".\nExample past tense forms: \"thou wouldst\", \"thou shouldst\", \"thou wast\", \"thou hadst\", \"thou couldst\"\n\nNote also the agreement shown by \"to be\" even in the subjunctive mood.\n\nHowever, for nearly all regular verbs, a separate \"thou\" form was no longer commonly used in the past tense. Thus the auxiliary verb \"to do\" is used, e.g.\" thou didst help\", not \"*thou helpedst\".\n\nCompared with English, Latin is an example of a highly inflected language. The consequences for agreement are thus:\n\nVerbs must agree in person and number, and sometimes in gender, with their subjects. Articles and adjectives must agree in case, number and gender with the nouns they modify.\n\nSample Latin (Spanish) verb: the present indicative active of \"portare\" (\"portar\"), to carry:\n\nIn Latin, a pronoun such as \"ego\" and \"tu\" is only inserted for contrast and selection. Proper nouns and common nouns functioning as subject are nonetheless frequent. For this reason, Latin is described as a null-subject language.\n\nSpoken French always distinguishes the second person plural, and the first person plural in formal speech, from each other and from the rest of the present tense in all verbs in the first conjugation (infinitives in -er) other than \"aller\". The first person plural form and pronoun (\"nous\") are now usually replaced by the pronoun \"on\" (literally: \"one\") and a third person singular verb form in Modern French. Thus, \"nous travaillons\" (formal) becomes \"on travaille\". In most verbs from the other conjugations, each person in the plural can be distinguished among themselves and from the singular forms, again, when using the traditional first person plural. The other endings that appear in written French (i.e.: all singular endings, and also the third person plural of verbs other than those with infinitives in -er) are often pronounced the same, except in liaison contexts. Irregular verbs such as \"être\", \"faire\", \"aller\", and \"avoir\" possess more distinctly pronounced agreement forms than regular verbs.\n\nAn example of this is the verb \"travailler\", which goes as follows (the single words in italic type are pronounced /tʁa.vaj/):\n\nOn the other hand, a verb like \"partir\" has (the single words in italic type are pronounced /paʁ/):\n\nThe final S or T is silent, and the other three forms sound different from one another and from the singular forms.\n\nAdjectives agree in gender and number with the nouns that they modify in French. As with verbs, the agreements are sometimes only shown in spelling since forms that are written with different agreement suffixes are sometimes pronounced the same (e.g. \"joli\", \"jolie\"); although in many cases the final consonant is pronounced in feminine forms, but silent in masculine forms (e.g. \"petit\" vs. \"petite\"). Most plural forms end in \"-s\", but this consonant is only pronounced in liaison contexts, and it is determinants that help understand if the singular or plural is meant. The participles of verbs agree in gender and number with the subject or object in some instances.\n\nArticles, possessives and other determinants also decline for number and (only in the singular) for gender, with plural determinants being the same for both genders. This normally produces three forms: one for masculine singular nouns, one for feminine singular nouns, and another for plural nouns of either gender:\n\nNotice that some of the above also change (in the singular) if the following word begins with a vowel: \"le\" and \"la\" become \"l′\", \"du\" and \"de la\" become \"de l′\", \"ma\" becomes \"mon\" (as if the noun were masculine) and \"ce\" becomes \"cet\".\n\nIn Hungarian, verbs have polypersonal agreement, which means they agree with more than one of the verb's arguments: not only its subject but also its (accusative) object. Difference is made between the case when there is a definite object and the case when the object is indefinite or there is no object at all. (The adverbs do not affect the form of the verb.) Examples: \"Szeretek\" (I love somebody or something unspecified), \"szeretem\" (I love him, her, it, or them, specifically), \"szeretlek\" (I love you); \"szeret\" (he loves me, us, you, someone, or something unspecified), \"szereti\" (he loves her, him, it, or them specifically). Of course, nouns or pronouns may specify the exact object. In short, there is agreement between a verb and the person and number of its subject and the specificity of its object (which often refers to the person more or less exactly).\n\nThe predicate agrees in number with the subject and if it is copulative (i.e., it consists of a noun/adjective and a linking verb), both parts agree in number with the subject. For example: \"A könyvek érdekesek voltak\" \"The books were interesting\" (\"a\": the, \"könyv\": book, \"érdekes\": interesting, \"voltak\": were): the plural is marked on the subject as well as both the adjectival and the copulative part of the predicate.\n\nWithin noun phrases, adjectives do not show agreement with the noun, though pronouns do. e.g. \"a szép könyveitekkel\" \"with your nice books\" (\"szép\": nice): the suffixes of the plural, the possessive \"your\" and the case marking \"with\" are only marked on the noun.\n\nIn the Scandinavian languages, adjectives (both attributive and predicative) are declined according to the gender, number, and definiteness of the noun they modify. In Icelandic and Faroese, adjectives are also declined according to grammatical case, unlike the other Scandinavian languages. \n\nIn some cases in Swedish, Norwegian and Danish, adjectives and participles as predicates appear to disagree with their subjects. This phenomenon is referred to as pancake sentences. \n\n\nIn Norwegian nynorsk, Swedish, Icelandic and Faroese the past participle must agree in gender, number and definiteness when the participle is in an attributive or predicative position. In Icelandic and Faroese, past participles would also have to agree in grammatical case.\n\nIn Norwegian bokmål and Danish it is only required to decline past participles in number and definiteness when in an attributive position. \n\nMost Slavic languages are highly inflected, except for Bulgarian and Macedonian. The agreement is similar to Latin, for instance between adjectives and nouns in gender, number, case and animacy (if counted as a separate category). The following examples are from Serbo-Croatian:\n\nVerbs have 6 different forms in the present tense, for three persons in singular and plural. As in Latin, subject is frequently dropped.\n\nAnother characteristic is agreement in participles, which have different forms for different genders:\n\nSwahili, like all other Bantu languages, has numerous noun classes. Verbs must agree in class with their subjects and objects, and adjectives with the nouns that they qualify. For example: \"Kitabu kimoja kitatosha\" (One book will be enough)\", Mchungwa mmoja utatosha\" (One orange-tree will be enough), \"Chungwa moja litatosha\" (One orange will be enough).\nThere is also agreement in number. For example: Vitabu viwili vitatosha\" (Two books will be enough), Michungwa miwili itatosha\" (Two orange-trees will be enough), \"Machungwa mawili yatatosha\" (Two oranges will be enough).\nClass and number are indicated with prefixes (or sometimes their absence), which are not always the same for nouns, adjectives and verbs, as illustrated by the examples.\n\n\n\n"}

He was a professional racer from 1937 to 1944, winning Milan–San Remo in 1943, the Giro di Lombardia in 1938, and the Tour of the Apennines in 1937. He started a company under his name in 1948.\n\nCinelli was the seventh of 10 children, the son of a small landowner near Florence. He became interested in bicycle technology after mechanical failures in races. Failure to interest manufacturers with his ideas in 1946 led him to start his own company. His brother Giotto was making steel stems and bars in Florence and Cinelli moved the business to Milan, centre of the Italian cycling industry. He made stems, bars and frames but depended on wholesaling for other companies. By his retirement, Cinelli's own goods were half the business. Stems and bars were 80 percent of Cinelli's own sales.\n\nCinelli moved to alloy production in 1963, later than other manufacturers because he was concerned about strength. Annual production of alloy stems and bars rose from 5,000 in the 1950s, to 7,500 in the early 1960s. By 1978 the figure was 150,000. He made no more than 700 frames a year. In 1974, he designed an aerodynamic bike on which Ole Ritter broke his own hour record. The staple product was the Speciale Corsa road model made from 1947. The Speciale Corsa also became known as the \"Super Corsa\" after a supplier sent decals that erroneously said \"Super Corsa\" instead of \"Speciale Corsa.\"\n\nCinelli recently teamed up with San Francisco-based MashSF to create the popular \"Cinelli MASH\" frames, which are widely used in the fixed-gear culture.\n\nThe Cinelli (MILANO) head badge was originally cloisonne (fired glass on brass) and 55mm tall. Shortly thereafter (c.1953) it was hand-painted with enamel and 56mm tall. In approximately 1958 it was reduced in height to 51mm. In 1978, it became a decal. The design featured a knight's helmet, inspired by a family heirloom, with a red lily - symbol of Florence - and a green serpent, symbol of Milan.\n\nThe presidency of the company passed to Antonio Colombo, owner of Columbus tubing, in 1978. In 1997 Cinelli became a division of Gruppo S.r.l.\n\n\n\n"}

Under Hunt's leadership, the Chiefs have made the playoffs seven times, won the AFC West 5 times, ended an 8 game playoff losing streak (an NFL record at the time), and won a Super Bowl.\n\nHunt was born on February 19, 1965. He is the son of Lamar Hunt and the grandson of oil tycoon H.L. Hunt. After graduating from St. Mark's School of Texas, he graduated from Southern Methodist University in 1987, where he was a captain of SMU's nationally ranked soccer team and a two-time Academic All-American. Hunt earned a degree in Business Administration with a concentration in Finance.\n\nHunt worked for two years as an investment banker with Goldman Sachs. He then returned to Dallas and worked with Lamar.\n\nOne of the driving forces behind the creation of Major League Soccer, Hunt helped his father run the Kansas City Wizards until the team was sold in 2006.\n\nHunt remains a member of the league's board of governors and owns the MLS club, FC Dallas, and previously owned the Columbus Crew until 2013.\n\nHunt was named chairman of the Kansas City Chiefs in 2005. Following the death of his father in 2006, he, his sister, and two brothers inherited ownership of the Chiefs. However, Hunt is the operating head of the franchise; he represents the Chiefs at owners' meetings and has the final say on personnel changes.\n\nAfter the Chiefs' loss to the New York Jets in the 2007 season finale, Chiefs general manager Carl Peterson announced that both he and head coach Herm Edwards would return to the Chiefs in 2008. However, Hunt declined to immediately comment on Peterson's status. Hunt spoke out weeks later and stated that the Chiefs were his \"No. 1 priority\" and that \"to have the best chance of success in 2008, having Carl here makes a lot of sense.\" Hunt wanted to avoid having a new general manager come in with a new head coach, and starting from scratch again.\n\nOn December 15, Hunt announced the resignation of Peterson from his positions as general manager, president, and CEO of the franchise effective the end of the season. Prior to the decision, the Chiefs had a combined record of 9–24 under Hunt's leadership since December 23, 2006.\n\nThe official press release stated that Peterson resigned, but Hunt had said the conversation had been ongoing throughout the season. Hunt said his decision to relieve Peterson of duties was not based on what happened the previous day, when the Chiefs lost an 11-point lead in the final 73 seconds and were beaten 22–21 by San Diego, dropping their record to 2–12 on the season. He also said that the fate of head coach Herm Edwards would be settled after the season when a new general manager would be hired. Hunt said he would split the duties previously held by Peterson and have someone in charge of the business side and someone else in charge of football for the franchise.\n\nHunt had kept his search for a new general manager almost entirely leakproof, instructing subordinates that only he was to speak to the situation.\n\nUnder Hunt, Columbus Crew won their first MLS Cup championship on November 23, 2008.\n\nOn January 13, 2009 Hunt hired New England Patriots vice president of player personnel Scott Pioli as the new Chiefs general manager. On January 23 the Chiefs fired head coach Herman Edwards, and Todd Haley was hired as his replacement on February 6.\n\nHaley's first season did not go well but he did a lot better in his second season. Hunt fired Haley on December 12, 2011, after the Chiefs had compiled a 5–8 record during the 2011 NFL season. Even though the team won the AFC West the year before Haley was replaced by defensive coordinator Romeo Crennel mid-Season. Crennel finished his stint as interim head coach with a 2–1 record, including a win over the previously-undefeated, and defending Super Bowl Champions (2011 Green Bay Packers season). On January 9, 2012, Hunt named Crennel the team's permanent head coach. The 2012 Chiefs finished with a 2–14 record, which was the worst in the league and for the first time in franchise history the Chiefs were set to have the first pick in the upcoming Draft. Hunt fired both General Manager Scott Pioli and Head Coach Romeo Crennel following the disastrous 2012 Season. \n\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles decided not to renew Head Coach Andy Reid's contract after a 4–12, the worst of his 13 year tenure. He began exercising other Head Coaching opportunities and was highly coveted due to his success. During his 13 years in Philadelphia, Reid went 130–93–1 and made the playoffs 9 times(including one Super Bowl Appearance). Even though there were 8 available Head Coaching jobs, Reid chose the Chiefs because he had a lot of respect for the Hunt family and the Chiefs Organization. On January 4, 2013 Hunt hired Reid to a 5 year contract. Originally Hunt was going to give Reid full control over all football operations(a similar arrangement to what he had in Philadelphia) but, on January 13, 2013 Hunt hired John Dorsey as General Manager. Previous to this Dorsey had no General Manager experience but was the Director of Football Operations for the Green Bay Packers and had also worked as a scout in Green Bay. Dorsey and Reid both worked for the Packers from 1992 to 1998 so they had been very familiar with each other. Hunt announced that Reid and Dorsey would have equal say in football operations. \n\n\nThe 2013 Chiefs bounced back and finished 11–5, making the playoffs but losing to the Colts in the first round of the playoffs. The Chiefs failed to make the playoffs the following year but did still finish the 2014 Season with a winning record at 9–7. In 2015, Reid's third year the Chiefs improved on their 9–7 record and finished the 2015 Season with a 11–5 record. 2015 saw the Chiefs win their first playoff game in Hunts tenure and the first for the franchise since 1994. The Chiefs however lost in the second round to the New England Patriots ending their season. The 2016 Chiefs finished with a 12–4 record, the best of Hunt's tenure as Head of the franchise and won the AFC West for the second time in his tenure. The Chiefs lost at home in the Divisional Round of the 2017 NFL Playoffs. Hunt fired General Manager John Dorsey on June 22, 2017 due to cap mismanagement. He soon then promoted Co-Director of Player Personnel Brett Veach. The Chiefs won the AFC West again in the 2017 Season and finished with a 10–6 record. They lost in the first round of the 2018 NFL Playoffs. \n\n\nThe 2018 Chiefs finished with a 12–4 record and clinched a first round play off bye for the 2019 Playoffs. The Chiefs won in the divisional round made the AFC Championship for the first time since 1994 and were set to host it for the first time in franchise history. They lost in OT to the Patriots. In 2019 the Chiefs finished with a 12–4 record and again hosted the AFC Championship game. This time however, the Chiefs won their first AFC Championship and brought home the Lamar Hunt Trophy, which was named after Clark Hunt's father Lamar. The Chiefs then went on to win Super Bowl LIV, the second in their history and first in 50 years.\n\nIn addition to the on-field resurgence of the team, Hunt is a leading voice among NFL owners. In 2019, Hunt was named Chairman of the influential NFL Finance Committee after serving as a member for seven years. Hunt is a member and former Chairman of the NFL International Committee, and he also serves on the Management Council’s Executive Committee (CEC) and the Personal Conduct Committee. Hunt was instrumental in securing the NFL’s collective bargaining agreement in 2011, and he was one of six members of the NFL Committee on Los Angeles Opportunities.\n\nHe is married to Tavia Shackles, a former Miss Missouri Teen USA and Miss Kansas USA. The couple have three children. Hunt is a Christian.\n\n\n"}

The road has partial controlled access with a combination of interchanges and at-grade intersections, but without property access for neighboring land-owners. Conceived in 1937, it was built during World War II to provide a road connection between military facilities in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. It fully opened on December 9, 1944 as the Camp Springs highway, so called because it connected Camp Springs (now Joint Base Andrews) in Prince George's County with Bolling Air Force Base. However one lane of the highway was opened in mid-October 1944.\n\nThe Suitland Parkway is long. Its eastern terminus is at Pennsylvania Avenue (Maryland Route 4), just outside the Capital Beltway and near Joint Base Andrews . Its western terminus is at Interstate 295 and the northbound approach to the Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge.\n\nThe parkway was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. It is also part of the National Highway System. The eastern half was a two-lane limited-access road, and the western half a four-lane divided limited-access road. In the 1990s the eastern half was doubled in size to match the western half. At the same time a 2-mile-long trail, the Suitland Parkway Trail, was constructed from Pomeroy Road to Southern Avenue.\n\nThe Suitland Parkway begins at an interchange with I-295 and South Capitol Street in Washington, D.C., heading southeast as a four-lane divided highway. The road intersects Firth Sterling Avenue SE at a traffic light before passing near residential areas as a limited-access road and curving to the south. Just after Firth Sterling Avenue SE, the parkway used to intersect a railroad line at a road crossing. The tracks have been abandoned and removed, but signage for the old railroad crossing can still be seen. The parkway comes to a westbound exit for Sheridan Road SE and an eastbound entrance from Sumner Road SE. that provides access to Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue SE. At the intersection of Sheridan Road SE and Pomeroy Road SE, a bike path begins and runs parallel to the westbound lanes of the parkway through the remainder of Washington, D.C. Past this, the Suitland Parkway curves east through woods and reaches a traffic light with Stanton Road SE. The road curves southeast and comes to a full interchange with Alabama Avenue SE, with access to and from the westbound direction of the parkway provided by Irving Street SE. Following this, the parkway heads east into woods.\n\nAt the bridge that carries Southern Avenue SE over the parkway, the Suitland Parkway enters Prince George's County in Maryland. The road heads northeast into Temple Hills, coming to traffic light with MD 637 north of the Naylor Road station on Washington Metro's Green Line. Left turns are prohibited at the MD 637 intersection. A short distance later, the parkway comes to an interchange with MD 5. Past this interchange, the Suitland Parkway continues east and passes under the Green Line, with the median widening as it continues southeast through woods. The median narrows again as the road comes to an interchange with MD 458 in Suitland near the Suitland station on the Green Line. Past MD 458, the parkway median widens again and the road continues through woodland a short distance to the southwest of the Green Line. The road has an at-grade intersection with Meadowview Drive, which heads south into a residential development, before the subway line passes over the parkway to head south. The Suitland Parkway curves east and the median narrows as the road comes to an interchange with Suitland Road. The road continues east through more woods with nearby development including the incorporated town of Morningside, with the median widening as the road comes to a traffic light with MD 337. It is at this point that southbound MD 337 splits from the westbound Suitland Parkway. The parkway passes under I-95/I-495 without an interchange before northbound MD 337 merges onto the eastbound direction of the parkway via a ramp. At this point, the Suitland Parkway passes to the north of Joint Base Andrews and comes to an interchange that provides access to the north gate of the base. A short distance later, both MD 337 and the Suitland Parkway end at a traffic light with MD 4 in Forestville.\n\nCommercial vehicles, such as trucks, are allowed on the Washington, DC portion of the parkway, but must exit at \nAlabama Ave.\n\n\n"}

Both the board and computer game portray the same basic concept: the players manage ancient Mediterranean civilizations in an effort to move them from the early Bronze Age to beyond the Iron Age. It was published in 1995, shortly before Avalon Hill was bought out by Hasbro in 1998.\n\nThe game play involves a map of the Mediterranean Sea and surrounding lands, where each player controls one civilization chosen from a set of nine: Africa, Asia, Assyria, Babylon, Crete, Egypt, Illyria, Italy (also named Iberia) and Thrace. Players move population units across the board, taking over territories and competing with their opponents for the most sought after land.\n\nOnce your population reaches a sufficient size, you can congregate the units into cities. These cities can later be attacked for valuable plunder and to deal a blow to your opponents' chances of winning. The primary source of damage to players' civilizations comes from calamities rather than warfare. Calamities are somewhat under players' control, and can be managed by purchase of appropriate tools.\n\nBuilding cities allows your civilization to produce commodities such as iron, salt, wine, bronze and spices. For each city you have, you may draw a card from a commodity card deck, numbered one through nine. Those who have the least cities draw first. The more commodities your civilization produces, the more valuable the types of commodities that you can produce. Hidden within each commodity deck are also one or two calamities, such as earthquake, famine, barbarian hordes or civil war, each of which seriously damages your population and destroys your cities. All commodity and calamity cards have identical backs, for trading face down. Some calamities are not tradeable. Most tradeable calamities have consequences to other players and generally the player who traded the calamity is exempt from being chosen.\n\nOnce your civilization accumulates enough commodities, you can trade them with your opponents in order to corner the market on a particular commodity and increase its value. By creating sets of two or more of the same commodity, the value of the commodity increases since the set is worth the imprinted number (1 to 9) times the square of the number of cards the set consists of. To trade, you offer your opponents three (or more) of your commodity cards in exchange for three (or more) of theirs. You must trade the same number of cards. Notably, only two of the trade cards need to be true for a valid trade to take place, which often discourages trading more than three cards.\n\nOnce you collect enough commodities, you can spend them to purchase tools, which range from pottery or astronomy to democracy or monotheism. By acquiring these tools, players' civilizations gain victory points. The tools also give each civilization particular advantages during the gameplay. Tools are divided into categories such as Science, Craft, and Civics. Purchasing a tool of one category normally entitles you to a discount to further purchases in that category and often also entitles you to a discount to the purchase of specific tools. Some tools have prerequisites for purchase.\n\nBy collecting useful tools and maintaining as many cities as possible on the board, your civilization advances through the ages. At the end of each turn, civilizations with enough cities and enough tools in appropriate categories are allowed to advance along the game's turn track, the Archaeological Succession Table (AST). Different civilizations have slightly different entry requirements to the spaces on the AST. A civilization unfortunate enough to end the turn with no cities at all will go backwards on the AST. Once one or more players have reached the end of the AST (for which 2000 victory points and 5 cities are needed), the game ends and the winner is decided based on a calculation of victory points. The majority of victory points come from purchase of tools and progress along the AST. Cities and stock at the end of the game provide a minor boost to victory points, sometimes sufficient to decide a close-fought game.\n\nThe game was commercially unsuccessful, and sold fewer than 20,000 units by April 1998.\n\n\"Computer Gaming World\"s Bob Proctor wrote, \"This game is perfect for those who play the board game, or for those who don't mind long, involving strategy play.\" While he found the game to be \"a good translation of the original\" in its single-player mode, he found its multiplayer options limited.\n\n"}

The Tampa Bay Storm earned their AFL record fifth ArenaBowl title, by defeating the Arizona Rattlers, 43-29. The win was just months after the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers won Super Bowl XXXVII, making Tampa Bay the first metropolitan area to simultaneously hold both NFL and AFL championships.\n\nHall of Fame coach Tim Marcum earned his seventh ArenaBowl title as his Tampa Bay Storm took a first quarter lead and never relinquished it, defeating fellow Hall of Fame coach Danny White's Arizona Rattlers by 14.\n\nThe teams traded scores in the first quarter, but early in the second Tampa Bay lineman Kelvin Kinney scooped up a Sherdrick Bonner fumble – one of four lost Rattler fumbles on the day – and ran 26 yards for a rather controversial touchdown. Though it appeared Kinney had thrown the ball in the air in celebration before crossing the goal line, the touchdown stood, and the Storm took a 20-10 lead. Though Arizona answered with a Bo Kelly touchdown run to close within 20-16, the Storm used two second-half touchdown passes from veteran backup quarterback Pat O'Hara to Lawrence Samuels to keep the Rattlers at bay. The 34-year-old O'Hara, who defeated the Storm in ArenaBowl XII as the quarterback for the Orlando Predators, had thrown only 14 passes all year but was pressed into action when starter John Kaleo was injured in the second quarter. He ran for another score with 10 minutes to play, putting Tampa Bay ahead 43-22 and sealing the victory.\n\nSamuels was named both the game's MVP and Ironman of the Game, as he led all players with five catches for 109 yards and three touchdowns. The game was the first ArenaBowl to be televised by NBC, as ABC had televised the previous five.

{"id": "2329940", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2329940", "title": "Mexican beaded lizard", "text": "Mexican beaded lizard\n\nThe Mexican beaded lizard (\"Heloderma horridum\") is a species of lizard in the family Helodermatidae, one of the two species of venomous beaded lizards found principally in Mexico and southern Guatemala. It and its congener (member of the same genus) the Gila monster (\"Heloderma suspectum\") are the only lizards known to have evolved an overt venom delivery system. The Mexican beaded lizard is larger than the Gila monster, with duller coloration, black with yellowish bands. As it is a specialized predator that feeds primarily upon eggs, the primary use of its venom is still a source of debate among scientists. However, this venom has been found to contain several enzymes useful for manufacturing drugs in the treatment of diabetes, and research on the pharmacological use of its venom is ongoing.\n\nThreatened throughout its range by overcollection and habitat loss, it is a CITES protected species. The Guatemalan beaded lizard (\"H. charlesbogerti\" ) is one of the rarest lizards in the world, with a wild population of fewer than 200.\n\nThe beaded lizards have one close living relative, the Gila monster (\"H. suspectum\"), as well as many extinct relatives in the Helodermatidae, whose genetic history may be traced back to the Cretaceous period. The genus \"Heloderma\" has existed since the Miocene, when \"H. texana\" ranged over most of North America. Because the helodermatids have remained relatively unchanged morphologically, they are occasionally regarded as living fossils. Although the beaded lizard appears closely related to the monitor lizards (varanids) of Africa, Asia, and Australia, the wide geographical separation and unique features not found in the varanids indicate the beaded lizard is better placed in a separate family.\n\nThe species was first described in 1829 by Arend Wiegmann as \"Trachyderma horridum\", but he renamed it \"Heloderma horridum\" six months later. Its generic name \"Heloderma\" means \"studded skin\", from the Ancient Greek words \"hêlos\" (ἧλος)—the head of a nail or stud—and \"dérma\" (δέρμα), meaning skin. Its specific name, \"horrĭdum\", is the Latin word meaning rough or rude.\n\nThe four subspecies of beaded lizard, elevated to full species in 2013, are:\n\nAdult beaded lizards range from in length. They are substantially larger than the Gila monster, which only reaches lengths of . The snout-to-vent length of a beaded lizard averages . The average body mass of an adult beaded lizard is , about 45% heavier than the average mass of a gila monster, with large specimens exceeding . Maximum weight known is Although males are slightly larger than females, the lizards are not sexually dimorphic. Both males and females are stocky with broad heads, although the males' tend to be broader. The beaded lizard's scales are small, beadlike, and not overlapping. Except for the lizard's underside, the majority of its scales are underlaid with bony osteoderms.\n\nTheir base color is black and marked with varying amounts of yellow spots or bands, with the exception of \"H. alvarezi\", which tends to be all black in color. The beaded lizard has a short tail which is used to store fat so it can survive during months of estivation. Unlike many other lizards, this tail does not autotomize and cannot grow back if broken. The beaded lizard has a forked, pink tongue which it uses to smell, with the help of a Jacobson's organ; it sticks its tongue out to gather scents and touches it to the opening of the organ when the tongue is retracted.\nBeaded lizards are found in the Pacific drainages from southern Sonora to southwestern Guatemala and two Atlantic drainages, from central Chiapas to southeastern Guatemala. Their habitats are primarily in the desert, tropical deciduous forests and thorn scrub forests, but are found in pine-oak forests, with elevations from sea level to 1500 m. In the wild, the lizards are only active from April to mid-November, spending about an hour per day above the ground.\n\nThe Mexican beaded lizard \"H. horridum\" is found in Mexico, from Sonora to Oaxaca. The Rio Fuerte beaded lizard (\"H. exasperatum\") is found from southern Sonora to northern Sinaloa. The Chiapan beaded lizard (\"H. alvarezi\") is found in the northern Chiapas and the depression of the Río Lagartero in Huehuetenango to northwestern Guatemala. The ranges of these three species overlap, making them sympatric. The Guatemalan beaded lizard (\"H. charlesbogerti\") is the only allopatric one, separated from the nearest population (\"H. alvarezi\") by 250 km of unsuitable habitat. The Guatemalan beaded lizard is the most endangered of the species, if not of all lizards; it is found only in the dry valley of the Río Motagua in northeastern Guatemala; less than 200 are believed to exist in the wild.\n\nThe beaded lizard is a specialized vertebrate nest predator, feeding primarily on bird and reptile eggs. A semi-arboreal species, it is found climbing deciduous trees in search of prey when encountered above ground. It occasionally preys upon small birds, mammals, frogs, lizards, and insects. Steve Angeli and Robert Applegate, noted captive breeders of the beaded lizard, have remarked that captive specimens do best on a diet of small vertebrates such as mice and rats. Confiscated wild-caught specimens can be made to feed by using egg on the prey item.\n\nThe venom glands of the beaded lizard are modified salivary glands located in the reptile's lower jaw. Each gland has a separate duct leading to the base of its grooved teeth. When biting, the beaded lizard hangs on its victim and chews to get its venomous saliva into the wound. Although its jaw grip is strong, its unsocketed teeth are easily broken off at their bases. The beaded lizard's venom is a weak hemotoxin, and although human deaths are rare, it can cause respiratory failure. It consists of a number of components, including L-amino acid oxidase, hyaluronidase, phospholipase A, serotonin, and highly active kallikreins that release vasoactive kinins. The venom contains no enzymes that significantly affect coagulation. Almost all documented human bites (eight in the past century) have resulted from prodding captive lizards with a finger or bare foot.\n\nWhile invertebrates are essentially immune to the effects of this venom, effects on vertebrates are more severe and varied. In mammals such as rats, major effects include a rapid reduction in carotid blood flow followed by a marked fall in blood pressure, respiratory irregularities, tachycardia, and other cardiac anomalies, as well as hypothermia, edema, and internal hemorrhage in the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, eyes, liver, and kidneys. In humans, the effects of bites are associated with excruciating pain that may extend well beyond the area bitten and persist up to 24 hours. Other common effects of bites on humans include local edema (swelling), weakness, sweating, and a rapid fall in blood pressure. Beaded lizards are immune to the effects of their own venom.\n\nSome compounds in its venom have been shown to have pharmacological properties relating to the possible treatment of diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and even HIV. One compound, a hormone named exendin-3, is marketed by Amylin Pharmaceuticals as the drug exenatide. A study in 1996 revealed that it binds to cell receptors in breast cancer cells and may stop the growth of lung cancer cells.\n\nThe beaded lizard becomes sexually mature at six to eight years and mates between September and October. Males engage in ritual combat that often lasts several hours; the victor mates with the female. The female lays her clutch of two to 30 eggs between October and December, the clutch hatching the following June or July.\n\nYoung lizards are seldom seen. They are believed to spend much of their early lives underground, emerging at two to three years of age after gaining considerable size.\n\nThe beaded lizard is surrounded by myth and superstition in much of its native range. It is incorrectly believed, for example, to be more venomous than a rattlesnake, can cause lightning strikes with its tail, or make a pregnant woman miscarry by merely looking at her. As a result of this superstition, locals often kill the lizard on sight.\n\nThe seldom-seen lizard is poached and sold into the illegal exotic animal trade. It does not reproduce well in captivity, and its scarcity means a high price for collectors. As a direct result, the beaded lizard is protected by Mexican law under the category A (Threatened), and it dwells within the range of several protected areas. In Guatemala, it is protected by national legislation, and part of its range is within protected areas. It is listed on Appendix II of CITES.\n\nFewer than 200 lizards remain in the dry forest habitat of the Motagua Valley, and this species of beaded lizard (\"H. charlesbogerti\") was facing extinction due to local extermination and loss of habitat for agricultural purposes. A conservation effort has been launched known as Project Heloderma to preserve the semiarid habitat of the Motagua Valley by the Nature Conservancy and partners such as ZOOTROPIC, CONAP, the International Reptile Conservation Foundation, Lincoln Park Zoo, Zoo Atlanta, and the San Diego Zoo. This effort has been successful in getting the Guatemalan government to list the beaded lizard under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species as an Appendix I animal, making it illegal to export the species.\n\n\n"}

It got the nickname the \"knee mortar\" because of an erroneous Allied belief that these launchers could be fired by propping its plate against the leg. However, anyone trying to fire it this way would receive a severe bruise (or sometimes a broken thigh bone) from its hefty recoil.\n\nThe Japanese Army, noting that grenades were short-ranged weapons, began efforts to optimize these weapons for close-in infantry fighting. After studying employment of grenades and mortars on the battlefield, the Japanese Army developed hand grenades, rifle grenades, and grenade/mortar shell dischargers (small mortars) suited to warfare in typical short-range combat environments such as urban, trench, and jungle warfare.\n\nAs part of this effort, the Japanese Army had adopted by 1932 a set of fragmentation grenades with almost universal adaptability. The Type 91 fragmentation grenade could be thrown by hand, fired from a spigot-type launcher, or used in a mortar-like grenade discharger, the Type 89.\n\nThe Type 89 Heavy Grenade Discharger was adopted in 1929 but production did not begin until 1932. It differs from the earlier Type 10 grenade discharger in that it has a rifled barrel. The Type 89 could fire two types of grenades or shells: the Type 91 Grenade, which was a normal infantry fragmentation grenade adapted to the Type 89 discharger, and the Type 89 50 mm shell, which was an impact-detonated shell with considerably more explosive power.\n\nWhen fired from the Type 89 discharger, the Type 91 fragmentation grenade was fitted with a propellant base and time fuse. It did not explode upon contact, but was designed to ignite its fuse while in flight. A weak creep spring inside the grenade firing mechanism allowed the firing pin to be thrown back upon launching, igniting a time fuse with a 7-8 second delay. Using this system, the Type 91 grenades could be launched through jungle cover or through small openings without the danger of premature detonation in the event the grenade struck an object on its way to the target. Although the Type 89 could be fired by a single person, it was typically operated with a crew of 3, enabling it to reach a rate of fire of about 25 rounds per minute.\n\nThe Type 89 discharger could also be used with a more powerful impact-detonated shell approaching the power of a light mortar. Weighing approximately two pounds (approx. 900 g), it was known as the Type 89 50mm shell, and was made in high explosive (HE), incendiary and smoke variants. To fire the shell (which had a nose-mounted impact fuse that detonated on contact), it was dropped base-down inside the tube of the discharger. By setting the Type 89 discharger at a fixed angle of 45 degrees, and varying distance to target by adjusting the size of a variable chamber space inside the discharger mechanism (see also the Granatnik wz. 36), soldiers could adjust fire onto multiple targets at varying ranges while firing the contact-detonated 50 mm shell through a single small clearing in the jungle canopy. The method worked equally well when firing from deep trenches or pits, or between various building obstructions when fighting inside a built-up town or city.\n\nWith its curved support plate, the Type 89 was designed to be placed on the ground or against a log or trunk at a fixed firing angle of 45 degrees. However, since it used a spring-loaded, lanyard-operated firing pin mechanism, in an emergency it could fire grenades or shells at point targets while braced horizontally against a tree or building.\n\nThe Type 89 discharger saw service at the Battle of Khalkhin Gol in Manchuria during the Second Sino-Japanese War. During World War II, the weapon was used effectively against the Allied defenders during the Battle of Corregidor in May 1942. It also saw service in Burma and the Pacific islands. Japanese Navy paratroopers carried special containers for the Type 89 clipped to their harnesses to provide fire support right on the landing zone. Allied troops quickly learned to take cover when they heard the weapon's \"pop\" when launching its grenades or shells, in some cases from more than away. \n\nAfter World War II the Type 89 was used by Indonesian National Army and militias against Dutch forces in the Indonesian National Revolution, with copies of the weapon manufactured in Demakijo, Yogyakarta. Others were used by Communist forces during Chinese Civil War and Korean War. Some were also used by the Việt Minh during First Indochina War and by the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2329964", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2329964", "title": "Tunes of Glory", "text": "Tunes of Glory\n\nTunes of Glory is a 1960 British drama film directed by Ronald Neame, based on the 1956 novel and screenplay by James Kennaway. The film is a \"dark psychological drama\" focusing on events in a wintry Scottish Highland regimental barracks in the period following the Second World War. It stars Alec Guinness and John Mills, and features Dennis Price, Kay Walsh, John Fraser, Susannah York, Duncan MacRae and Gordon Jackson.\n\nWriter Kennaway served with the Gordon Highlanders, and the title refers to the bagpiping that accompanies every important action of the regiment. The original pipe music was composed by Malcolm Arnold, who also wrote the music for \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\". The film was generally well received by critics, the acting in particular garnering praise. Kennaway's screenplay was nominated for an Oscar.\n\nThe film, set in 1948, opens in an officers' mess of an unnamed Highland Regiment. Acting Lieutenant Colonel Jock Sinclair (Alec Guinness) announces this will be his last day as commanding officer. The hard-drinking Sinclair, who is still gazetted as a Major despite being in command since the battalion's last full colonel was killed in action during the North African campaign of the Second World War, is to be replaced by the teetotal Lieutenant Colonel, Basil Barrow (John Mills). Although Sinclair led the battalion through the remainder of the war, winning a DSO and MM medals during El Alamein, Monte Cassino, and \"from Dover to Berlin\", Brigade HQ considers Barrow a more appropriate peacetime commanding officer. A drunken Sinclair reveals his frustrations at his lowly rank versus Barrow: \"I've acted Colonel, I should be Colonel, and by God... I will be Colonel!\"\n\nColonel Barrow arrives early and observes the battalion's officers dancing rowdily, including Major Sinclair. Barrow and Sinclair icily swap their military backgrounds. Sinclair joined the regiment as an enlisted bandsman in Glasgow and rose through the ranks, winning the Military Medal and Distinguished Service Order during the war. Barrow by contrast came to the regiment from Eton then Oxford University, both in England, and that his ancestors were colonels of the regiment before him – although Barrow served only a year with the regiment back in 1933 before being posted to \"special duties\", including lecturing at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. He has been fifteen years away from the battalion. When Sinclair humorously recounts he was briefly in Barlinnie Prison for being drunk and disorderly (also in 1933), Barrow reticently mentions his experience as a prisoner in a Japanese POW camp. Sinclair dismissively assumes Barrow received preferential treatment as an officer (\"officers' privileges and amateur dramatics\") but in fact Barrow is deeply psychologically scarred after being tortured by the Japanese, which he does not tell Sinclair who not-so-privately resents his replacement by a \"stupid wee man\".\n\nMeanwhile, Morag (Susannah York), Sinclair's daughter, is observed illicitly meeting an enlisted piper (John Fraser).\n\nBarrow immediately passes several orders designed to instil discipline in the battalion that Sinclair had allowed to slip. Particularly controversial is an order that all officers take lessons in Highland dancing in an effort to make their customary rowdy style more formal and suitable for mixed company. However the unchanged energetic dancing of the officers, led by a drunken Sinclair at Barrow's first cocktail party with the townspeople, incites his anger. An outburst by Barrow only further damages his own authority.\n\nTensions come to a head when Major Sinclair publicly assaults the uniformed piper he discovers with his daughter in a pub – \"bashing a corporal\" as he put it. Barrow decides an official report to the Brigade must be made, meaning an imminent court-martial, even though he is aware the action will further erode his popularity and authority within the battalion. Barrow is eventually persuaded to back down by Sinclair, who promises Barrow that he will support him in the future (\"We'd make a good team.\"). The decision further undermines his authority, as Sinclair's promised support never materializes, and the other officers, notably Captain Alec Rattray (Richard Leech), treat him with a renewed lack of respect. The second in command, Major Charlie Scott, with glacial cruelty, implies that it is Sinclair who is really running the battalion, because he forced Barrow to dismiss the charges against him. Alienated now from both Sinclair's clique and the officers who formerly supported him, from the officers recreation area a shot is heard and investigation confirms that Barrow has shot himself dead (the actual event is unseen).\n\nWith the colonel's death, Sinclair realises he is to blame. He calls the officers to a meeting and announces plans for a grandiose funeral fit for a field marshal, complete with a march through the town in which all the \"tunes of glory\" will be played by the pipers. He lists the tunes he wishes to be played: Scotland the Brave, The Nut Brown Maiden and the Bonnets of Bonnie Dundee. When it is pointed out how out disproportionate the plans are to the circumstances, especially given the manner of the colonel's death, Sinclair insists that it was not suicide but murder. He tells everyone he himself was the murderer and the other senior officers were his accomplices with the exception of the colonel's adjutant.\n\nSinclair suffers a nervous breakdown and is escorted from the barracks while the officers and men salute as he passes during the closing scene.\n\nThe film was initially to be made at Ealing Studios, with Michael Relph as producer and Jack Hawkins playing Sinclair. At the time that it was at Ealing, Kenneth Tynan, then working as a script reader, criticized the first draft screenplay as having \"too much army-worship in it.\" That view was shared by director Alexander Mackendrick. By the time Kennaway rewrote the script, Ealing had lost interest and Hawkins was no longer available. The film was then picked up by the independent producer Colin Leslie, who interested Mills in the project.\n\nAccounts differ as to how the leading roles were cast. Mills wrote that he and Guinness \"tossed for it,\" while Guinness recalled that he had originally been offered the role of Barrow but preferred Sinclair. The role of Barrow might have been too close to that of Colonel Nicholson in \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\"\".\" Sinclair has been described as \"anti-Nicholson.\"\n\n\"Tunes of Glory\" was shot at Shepperton Studios in London. Establishing location shots were done at Stirling Castle in Stirling, Scotland. Stirling Castle is the Regimental Headquarters of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders but in fact James Kennaway served with the Gordon Highlanders. Although the production was initially offered broad co-operation to film within the castle from the commanding officer there, as long as it didn't disrupt the regiment's [Argyll's] routine, after seeing a lurid paperback cover for Kennaway's book, that co-operation evaporated, and the production was only allowed to shoot distant exterior shots of the castle.\n\nDirector Ronald Neame worked with Guinness on \"The Horse's Mouth\" (1958), and a number of other participants were also involved in both films, including actress Kay Walsh, cinematographer Arthur Ibbetson and editor Anne V. Coates. The film was Susannah York's film debut.\n\nWriting in \"Esquire\", Dwight Macdonald called \"Tunes of Glory\" a \"limited but satisfying tale,\" and wrote that \"it is one of those films, like Zinnemann’s \"Sundowners\", which are of little interest cinematically and out of fashion thematically (no sex, no violence, no low life) and yet manage to be very good entertainment.\"\n\nThe film was praised by Bosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\", who wrote \"Not only do Alec Guinness and John Mills superlatively adorn the two top roles in this drama of professional military men, but also every actor, down to the walk-ons, acquits himself handsomely.\"\n\n\"Variety\" called Ronald Neame’s direction \"crisp and vigorous,\" and said that Mills had a \"tough assignment\" to appear opposite Guinness, \"particularly in a fundamentally unsympathetic role, but he is always a match for his co-star.\"\n\nThe film's screenplay, and especially the final scene showing Sinclair's breakdown, was criticized by some critics at the time of release. One critic wrote in \"Sight & Sound\" that the ending was \"inexcusable\" and that the scene is \"far less one of tragic remorse than gauchely contrived emotionalism.\"\n\n\"Tunes of Glory\" has a 73% rating on the Rotten Tomatoes review aggregation site.\n\nJames Kennaway, who adapted the screenplay from his novel, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, but lost to \"Elmer Gantry\". It also received numerous BAFTA nominations, including Best Film, Best British Film, Best British Screenplay and Best Actor nominations for both Guinness and Mills.\n\nThe film was the official British entry at the 1960 Venice Film Festival, and John Mills won the Best Actor award there. That same year the film was named \"Best Foreign Film\" by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.\n\n\"Tunes of Glory\" was adapted for BBC Radio 4's Monday Play by B.C. Cummins in April 1976.\n\n\"Tunes of Glory\" was adapted for the stage by Michael Lunney, who directed a production of it which toured Britain in 2006.\n\n\"Tunes of Glory\" is available on DVD from Criterion and Metrodome. It was released on Blu-ray by Criterion in December 2019 with a 4K digital restoration.\n\nAlfred Hitchcock called \"Tunes of Glory\" \"one of the best films ever made,\" Neil Sinyard writes in \"The Cinema of Britain and Ireland,\" \"so it is curious that the film rarely finds a place in the established canon of great British films.\" It was not included in the list of 100 greatest British films of the century compiled by the British Film Institute in 1999. Sinyard observes that the film came too late to be part of the spate of popular 1950s British war films, and was too dark to be part of that genre. He notes that it seemed \"slightly old-fashioned\" when compared to British New Wave films that came out at the time, such as \"Room at the Top\".\n\n"}

Founded in 16 October 1941 it currently plays in Segunda División B – Group 1, holding home matches at \"Estadio Municipal de Pasarón\", with a capacity of 12,000 seats.\n\nHaving enjoyed its heyday in the 1960s, it even reached the First Division, leading it during November and December 1965. The club was renowned at the top level for its performances against the bigger clubs, especially at home. Due to their history, fanbase, and stadium, \"os Granates\" are considered Galicia's third biggest club, behind Deportivo de La Coruña and Celta de Vigo, despite having spent the majority of recent decades in Spanish football's inferior categories.\n\n\"Pontevedra Club de Fútbol\" was founded in 1941, following the merge of the two top teams in the city at the moment: \"Eiriña\" and \"Alfonso C.F.\" The first president of the new club was Fernando Ponte Conde.\n\nPontevedra promoted to La Liga in 1963 but was relegated a year after, managing to play again in the top flight between 1965 and 1970. During this time the fans coined the motto \"Hai que roelo\", in reference to the difficulties rival teams had when playing a strong side, who achieved a seventh place in 1966, adding an eighth two seasons later; midfielder Ignacio Martín-Esperanza and forwards Neme and Roldán were among the stars of this era, and years following the 1972–73 season saw the team more often than not struggling in lower categories, well into the 2000s.\n\nOn 23 January 2007 Pontevedra was transformed into a \"Sociedade Anónima Deportiva\" (sporting Joint stock company), as required by Spanish law – this was a general measure introduced in order to revitalise the financial situation of professional football clubs. Yet, some risked disappearance as they could not face the cost involved in this transformation from \"private\" to \"stock company\". In the club's case this was made possible after then president, Nino Mirón, had purchased 52 per cent of the stock options; the club then added the letters \"S.A.D.\" to its official name.\n\nThe subsequent stated main goal of Pontevedra was to promote back to Segunda División, with the team having last appearing in the category in the 2004–05 campaign. That season the club finished in the last position among 22 teams. The club qualified for the promotion playoffs for the following three seasons, but failed to go through on each occasion. They were subsequently relegated and spent four seasons in the Galician Tercera División Group, returning to Segunda B via the playoffs after a successful 2014/15 season under the guidance of Luisito. The following season in the Segunda División B, Group 1 the club finished in the 9th position. \n\n\n\nThe traditional colours of Pontevedra are burgundy shirt, blue shorts and burgundy socks. However, during certain periods white shorts and blue socks were also used, and even a blue and burgundy ribboned shirt for a short period of time.\n\nThe current colours are the traditional, with the crest of the club on the left upper part of the shirt. The name of the sponsor (if any) is normally placed in the centre of the shirt.\n\nThe crest is a fusion between the coat of arms of the city of Pontevedra and a football, displaying the name of the city/club and the letters \"CF\". The club has an official mascot called \"Roélio\", a walking bone dressed in the club colours who is a direct reference to the club's motto.\n\nPontevedra plays at the \"Estadio Municipal de Pasarón\". With a 105x68 meters playing field, it was built in 1956 and was partially refitted for the 1982 FIFA World Cup celebrated in Spain; it did not hold any actual games in the tournament, but it benefitted from the general funds allocated to the refurbishment of football stadiums.\nThe stadium used to have a capacity for 16,500, including standing spectators. However, UEFA regulations dictated that all attendants must be seated and, therefore, the stadium went under re-construction. – regardless, \"Pasarón\" was also in need of a general refurbishment, overdue since 1982. The works were completed for the 2010–11 season, with the new capacity being of 10,500 spectators.\n\n\"Pasarón\" is located in the north side of the city (north to Lérez River), at Rúa de Luis Otero s/n, 36005.

The school was founded to provide an international education, while preserving its students' diverse cultural heritages. Today, UNIS has over 1600 students in two locations, serving the United Nations, international and New York communities. The campus in Jamaica Estates, Queens is a K8 school and the Manhattan campus, overlooking the East River, is K12. The school was originally located on East 70th street, before moving around 1970 into two premises on 51st (the Junior School) and 54th street. The senior school was housed on east 11th Street. The main building on 25th street opened in 1972.\n\nUNIS was one of the founding schools of the International Baccalaureate (IB) and was among those awarding the first diplomas. The comprehensive K12 curriculum prepares UNIS students for the IB, and the school's internationally recognized academic standards enables students to go on to study in top colleges and universities in the United States and worldwide.\n\nThe main language of instruction is English and all students study French or Spanish, beginning in elementary school. Arabic, Chinese, German, Italian, Japanese and Russian are also taught beginning in the seventh grade at the Manhattan campus. Additional mother tongues may be studied after school.\nThe school's current Executive Director is Dan Brenner.\n\nUNIS is a member of the Council of International Schools, the International Baccalaureate Organization, the European Council of International Schools, the New York State Association of Independent Schools, the National Association of Independent Schools, the College Board and is registered with the New York Board of Regents as an independent, not-for-profit school.\n\nIn the formative years, UNIS offers a school-designed curriculum, from Kindergarten to Grade 10. Junior and senior students enroll in the International Baccalaureate Diploma (IBDP) or IB Courses, where a wide range of subjects are offered. Within the framework of IB requirements, students have the possibility to choose from over 200 course combinations.\n\nStudents are taught in relatively small classes, with averages of 17 children in kindergarten (JA), 17 in grade 1 (J1), 17 in grade 2 (J2), 19 in grades 34 (J3-J4), and 21 in middle and high school (M1-T4). Emphasis is placed on preparation for the IB exams during High School, for which virtually all seniors sit (full Diploma or Certificate). Children whose parents transfer from abroad to work for the United Nations, Missions to the UN, and Consulates enjoy priority in terms of admission, but admission is not necessarily automatic. All children are required to be interviewed and assessed in person at UNIS, in addition to consideration of official school reports.\n\nThe AEFE categorizes this school as a French international school.\n\nNearly all UNIS graduates matriculate at four-year colleges in the semester following graduation, with a small number choosing a gap year program. A typical year will see 75% to 85% of graduates enrolling at colleges in the United States with remaining graduates attending 20 different universities in thirteen countries outside the U.S.\nEach year, high schoolers organize a conference in the General Assembly Hall of the United Nations and invite other schools. This activity allows students to improve their public speaking and diplomacy skills. It also allows students to engage with real world issues.\n"}

{"id": "2329992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2329992", "title": "Online transaction processing", "text": "Online transaction processing\n\nIn Online transaction processing (OLTP), information systems typically facilitate and manage transaction-oriented applications.\n\nThe term \"transaction\" can have two different meanings, both of which might apply: in the realm of computers or database transactions it denotes an atomic change of state, whereas in the realm of business or finance, the term typically denotes an exchange of economic entities (as used by, e.g., Transaction Processing Performance Council or commercial transactions.) OLTP may use transactions of the first type to record transactions of the second.\n\nOLTP has also been used to refer to processing in which the system responds immediately to user requests. An automated teller machine (ATM) for a bank is an example of a commercial transaction processing application. Online transaction processing applications have high throughput and are insert- or update-intensive in database management. These applications are used concurrently by hundreds of users. The key goals of OLTP applications are availability, speed, concurrency and recoverability. Reduced paper trails and the faster, more accurate forecast for revenues and expenses are both examples of how OLTP makes things simpler for businesses. However, like many modern online information technology solutions, some systems require offline maintenance, which further affects the cost-benefit analysis of an online transaction processing system.\n\nOLTP is typically contrasted to OLAP (online analytical processing), which is generally characterized by much more complex queries, in a smaller volume, for the purpose of business intelligence or reporting rather than to process transactions. Whereas OLTP systems process all kinds of queries (read, insert, update and delete), OLAP is generally optimized for read only and might not even support other kinds of queries. OLTP also operates differently from batch processing and grid computing.\n\nIn addition, OLTP is often contrasted to OLEP (online event processing), which is based on distributed event logs to offer strong consistency in large-scale heterogeneous systems. Whereas OLTP is associated with short atomic transactions, OLEP allows for more flexible distribution patterns and higher scalability, but with increased latency and without guaranteed upper bound to the processing time.\n\nAn OLTP system is an accessible data processing system in today's enterprises. Some examples of OLTP systems include order entry, retail sales, and financial transaction systems. Online transaction processing systems increasingly require support for transactions that span a network and may include more than one company. For this reason, modern online transaction processing software uses client or server processing and brokering software that allows transactions to run on different computer platforms in a network.\n\nIn large applications, efficient OLTP may depend on sophisticated transaction management software (such as CICS) and/or database optimization tactics to facilitate the processing of large numbers of concurrent updates to an OLTP-oriented database.\n\nFor even more demanding decentralized database systems, OLTP brokering programs can distribute transaction processing among multiple computers on a network. OLTP is often integrated into service-oriented architecture (SOA) and Web services.\n\nOnline transaction processing (OLTP) involves gathering input information, processing the data and updating existing data to reflect the collected and processed information. As of today, most organizations use a database management system to support OLTP. OLTP is carried in a client-server system.\n\nOnline transaction process concerns about concurrency and atomicity. Concurrency controls guarantee that two users accessing the same data in the database system will not be able to change that data or the user has to wait until the other user has finished processing, before changing that piece of data. Atomicity controls guarantee that all the steps in a transaction are completed successfully as a group. That is, if any steps between the transaction fail, all other steps must fail also.\n\nTo build an OLTP system, a designer must know that the large number of concurrent users does not interfere with the system's performance. To increase the performance of an OLTP system, a designer must avoid excessive use of indexes and clusters.\n\nThe following elements are crucial for the performance of OLTP systems:\n\n"}

He played college football for the Michigan State Spartans, earning unanimous All-American honors and recognition as the top college wide receiver in the country. The Detroit Lions selected him with the second overall pick in the 2003 NFL Draft, but he was out of the league after only three years due to injuries and off-field issues. He is often ranked as one of the biggest busts in NFL history.\n\nRogers was born and raised in Saginaw, Michigan to a single mother. Rogers lived with his grandfather at age six while his mother served a one-year prison sentence and again during high school when his mother took a night job. At Saginaw High School, Rogers played on the football, basketball, and track teams. In football, he was a three-time all-state honoree.\n\nWhile attending Michigan State University, Rogers played for the Spartans from 2000 to 2002. He broke numerous receiving records. Rogers still holds the school records for most touchdowns in a career with 27, breaking the record held by former Spartans wide receiver Kirk Gibson, and the school record for most receiving yards in a single game with 270. He broke Randy Moss's NCAA record of 13 consecutive games with a touchdown catch. During Rogers' 2002 junior season, he had 68 receptions for 1,351 yards and 13 touchdowns, won the Fred Biletnikoff Award and Paul Warfield Trophy as the best college wide receiver in the nation, and was recognized as a unanimous All-American. His stock went up dramatically in his junior year when, in a game against Notre Dame, he outjumped two defenders to catch a Jeff Smoker pass in the back of the end zone, then managed to keep his left foot in bounds to score a touchdown.\n\n\"Source:\"\n\nThe Detroit Lions selected Rogers with the second overall pick in the 2003 NFL Draft, one pick ahead of University of Miami wide receiver Andre Johnson.\n\nRogers caught 22 passes for 243 yards and three touchdowns during his first five games of the 2003 season, before breaking his clavicle while practicing a speed drill with Dré Bly, leaving him out for the season. On the third play of the 2004 season, against the Chicago Bears, Rogers suffered another broken clavicle, knocking him out for the season. He was so devastated by the injury that the Lions allowed him to go home for the remainder of the season. Years later, Lions general manager Matt Millen said that in hindsight, he made a mistake by letting Rogers be away from the team for an extended period of time.\n\nRogers was suspended for four games in 2005 for a third violation of the NFL's substance abuse policy. As a result of this violation, the Lions filed a grievance, claiming that his drug suspension violated a clause in his contract, which meant Rogers was obligated to return $10 million of the $14.2 million the Lions gave him in bonuses.\n\nUpon his return from suspension, Rogers played only nine games, with three starts, and was declared inactive for four games. He caught 14 passes for 197 yards and one touchdown.\n\nOn September 2, 2006, Rogers was released by the Lions. New coach Rod Marinelli was not impressed with Rogers' humdrum effort during training camp; he said of Rogers' release, \"We picked the men that are right for this football team. It's behind us.\" He worked out thereafter for the Miami Dolphins, New England Patriots, and Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2006. However, he was not signed due to his 40-yard dash times of 4.8 seconds. At his peak, he ran the 40-yard dash in 4.4 seconds.\n\nIn October 2008, an arbitrator hired by the Lions ruled that Rogers had to repay the team $8.5 million. However, Rogers did not repay that money, and the Lions filed a lawsuit against him. In April 2010, U.S. federal judge Julian A. Cook ruled that Rogers had to pay $6.1 million of his signing bonus. In an interview in 2017, regarding the money owed the Lions, Rogers stated that he planned on filing for bankruptcy.\n\nRogers fathered eight children with four women. Two of the children were born before he graduated from high school. As of April 2017, Rogers had lived in Fort Myers, Florida and worked at an auto repair shop.\n\nOn November 11, 2019, Rogers died in Fort Myers at age 38 of liver failure. He had been diagnosed with cancer and was in need of a liver transplant.\n\nFollowing the injuries he suffered during the early part of his career in Detroit, Rogers developed an addiction to the prescription opioid Vicodin, which contains acetaminophen, a product sold over-the-counter as Tylenol but is known to cause severe liver failure when taken in the dosages he alleged were given to him by Lions team physicians.\n\nRogers was arrested in September 2008 and charged with assault and battery of his girlfriend, Naija Washington; the charges were later dropped. In December 2008, Rogers was sentenced to attend drug court or face jail time after violating his probation. In March 2009, Rogers was jailed for violating probation. On September 16, 2009, Rogers was arrested in Novi, Michigan for driving under the influence of alcohol after police found him unresponsive behind the wheel of his car. Rogers was arrested again in Novi on January 5, 2010, after passing out from drinking at a restaurant, which was a violation of a sobriety court order; he was sentenced to 93 days in jail two days later. \n\nHe tested positive for marijuana twice while at Michigan State and a test at the NFL combine detected excess water in his system. Rogers continued to smoke marijuana after his 2004 season-ending injury, which led to his 2005 suspension. In a 2009 interview with ESPN, he said that his hard living contributed to his downfall in the NFL.\n\n"}

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1922 to 1927, and was a cabinet minister in the government of John Bracken.\n\nCannon was born in Southport, Lancashire, England, the son of Reverend J. D. Cannon and Catherine Sakeyne. His grandfather and uncle were mayors of Bolton, Lancashire, and were pioneers in cotton spinning manufacture during the 1850s and 1860s. Cannon was educated at Liverpool College and Harstporpoins College in Sussex, and passed Oxford and Cambridge first-class extension examinations in 1884. He moved to Canada in 1885. In 1888, he married Adah Wigham.\n\nCannon worked as a farmer and served as director of the Belmont Creamery Corporation. He was also a police magistrate, and served as reeve of Strathcona for nine and a half years. He was an active community member, and was for many years closely associated with the Liberal Party. In the early 1920s, he endorsed the decision of the United Farmers of Manitoba (UFM) to field candidates in provincial elections.\n\nCannon ran for the UFM in the 1922 provincial election, and defeated Liberal incumbent James Baird in the constituency of Mountain. The UFM won the election, and formed government as the Progressive Party of Manitoba. Cannon initially served as a government backbencher, and was promoted to cabinet on December 3, 1923 as Minister of Education.\n\nDuring this period, newly selected cabinet ministers were required to resign their constituency seats to seek re-election as provincial office holders. These elections were usually \"pro forma\" affairs in the 1920s, as ministers were not generally opposed by candidates of other parties. Cannon, however, faced a challenge from Conservative candidate George Fraser, whom he defeated without difficulty on December 24, 1923.\n\nOn November 12, 1924, Cannon was given the additional position of Minister of Public Welfare. He resigned the Education portfolio on April 21, 1927, and was named Provincial Secretary and Provincial Lands Commissioner.\n\nCannon was defeated by Liberal candidate Irving Cleghorn in the 1927 provincial election, losing by eighty-four votes. He formally resigned from cabinet on September 9, 1927.\n\nCannon died in Belmont and was buried there.\n"}

It was also responsible for the statutes relating to the formalities of marriage and conduct of civil marriage in Scotland. It administered the census of Scotland's population every ten years. It also kept the Scottish National Health Service Central Register.\n\nOn 1 April 2011 it was merged with the National Archives of Scotland to form National Records of Scotland. All the former department's functions continue as part of the new body.\n\nInitially ministers of the Church of Scotland were responsible for keeping parish records of baptisms and marriages, but only for their own church members. Later the Privy Council of Scotland, following the suggestion of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland enacted that all parish ministers should keep a record of baptisms, burials and marriages. This situation continued until 1854, when Parliament passed an Act transferring responsibility to the State.\n\nThe Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages (Scotland) Act 1854 created the General Register Office of Births, Deaths and Marriages, headed by the Registrar General with the appointment of registrars in every parish. It also provided that the Registrar General should produce an annual report to be forwarded to the Home Secretary to be laid before Parliament, containing a general abstract of the numbers of births, deaths and marriages registered during the previous year. The first general abstract (relating to 1855) was submitted in 1856.\n\nThe parochial and borough divisions in Scotland were adopted as the basis of registration, and the session clerks of the Church of Scotland were, in most cases, appointed as the first registrars under the Act. Where the parish or borough was too large for a single registrar, the sheriff was empowered to divide it into districts. Registers were to be produced in duplicate, and one was to be sent to the Office of the Scottish Registrar General in Edinburgh. Compulsory civil registration began in Scotland on 1 January 1855, and coverage seems to have been complete for marriages and deaths. Birth registration took rather longer to bed down, but by the time of his first annual detailed report, published in 1861, the first Registrar General for Scotland, William Pitt Dundas, claimed that: \"there is good reason for believing that very few births indeed now escape registration.\"\n\nIn 1855 and 1860, two Acts, the Registration (Scotland) Act, 1855 (18 & 19 Vict., c.29) and the Registration (Scotland, Amendment) Act, 1860 (23 & 24 Vict., c.85), were passed which amended some of the sections of the 1854 Act. The original Act had placed considerable burdens on the sheriffs of the Scottish counties, who had already played a role in the taking of decennial censuses. The amending Acts reduced their responsibilities by appointing registration district examiners to inspect the registers. They also made revised provision for the transmission of the parochial registers up to the year 1820 to the General Register Office Scotland (GROS), and the registers for the years 1820–1855 to the custody of the local registrars. These registers were to be retained by the registrars for 30 years, after which they were to be sent to the GROS. \n\nOn 1 April 2011 GROS was merged with the National Archives of Scotland, with which it already had close ties and shared management of the Scotland's People Centre in Princes Street, Edinburgh, to form National Records of Scotland.\n\nFrom 1855 the role of accumulating and publishing statistics from data has fallen to one person. These people were:\n\n\nThe Registrar General was also Deputy to the Lord Clerk Register. The Deputy Clerk Register had to be an Advocate of not less than ten years standing.\n\nWilliam Pitt Dundas was the first holder of the combined post of Deputy Clerk Register and Registrar General from September 1854 until April 1880. His successor, Roger Montgomerie, died six months after his appointment, and Mr Pitt Dundas resumed office for around a year, until the appointment of Sir Stair Agnew KCB. The last person to hold the combined posts was Sir James Patten McDougall KCB, in office from May 1909 to March 1919.\n\nOriginally, this was the supervision of birth, death and marriage registration. It was expanded to include the conduct of the 1861 Census and all subsequent ones (working closely with the Registrar General to ensure consistency) and other statistical functions.\n\nIn 1920 the Registrar General (Scotland) Act 1920 was passed which provided for the appointment by the Secretary of State for Scotland a whole-time Registrar General, Dr James Craufurd Dunlop, (previously Medical Superintendent of Statistics) was appointed.\n\nOn the formation of National Records of Scotland, the positions of Registrar General and Keeper of the Records of Scotland were initially kept separate, but on the retirement of Duncan Macniven in August 2011, George Mackenzie was appointed Registrar General in addition to his existing role as Keeper.\n\n\nNew Register House, which houses the registration side of the former GROS's business, is close to the east end of Princes Street in Edinburgh. It was designed by Robert Matheson, the Clerk of Works at the Office of Her Majesty's Works in Scotland. Initially, the General Register Office had been located in General Register House. The building was erected on its present site near the Old Register House. The site was acquired in 1856 and the building was opened on 30 March 1861, though not completed until 1864 at a total cost of £40,000.\n\nGROS had two other main buildings: Ladywell House, in the Corstorphine area of Edinburgh, where population, household and vital statistics data (including Scotland's census) are housed; and Cairnsmore House on the Crichton Estate in Dumfries, home of Scotland's NHS Central Register. All three buildings are now part of the National Records of Scotland estate.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2330016", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2330016", "title": "Watton-at-Stone", "text": "Watton-at-Stone\n\nWatton-at-Stone is a village in the English county of Hertfordshire, situated midway between the towns of Stevenage and Hertford in the valley of the River Beane. The 2011 census showed a population of 2,272 living in 946 households. Watton-at-Stone is also a civil parish in East Hertfordshire District Council.\n\nThere is little employment directly within the village and it largely serves as a dormitory for commuters to London or to the nearby towns with hourly trains to Moorgate station.\n\nThe village has a primary school and nursery school. The co-educational Heath Mount independent school is located on the outskirts in the private estate of the Grade II* listed Woodhall Park.\n\nThe A602 formerly ran through the centre of the village between Stevenage and Hertford before a bypass was built in 1984 through farmland to the north-east. The section of the road to Hertford was renamed the A119, and the A602 then ran out of Watton-at-Stone to Ware. Watton-at-Stone is served by a railway station on the Hertford Loop Line. The station opened for passengers on 2 June 1924, was closed on 11 September 1939 (though the line continued to run through the village), and reopened on 17 May 1982, paid for partly by public subscription.\n\nA war memorial lies in a field adjoining the church.\n\nIn the village itself there is a small convenience store, café and takeaway restaurant as well as a hairdressers, butcher's shop and two pubs.\n\nThe name Watton first appeared in writing in an 11th-century publication of 10th century Anglo-Saxon wills as \"Wattun\". It was later recorded in the Domesday Book as both \"Wodtune\" and \"Watone\". The origin of the word is uncertain, and is variously ascribed to Old English \"wád\" or woad, and \"ton\" meaning small farming settlement; or \"waden\" meaning ford; or from \"waétan\" meaning watery.\n\nThe suffix -at-Stone dates from the early 13th century and may be derived from the presence of two large examples of Hertfordshire puddingstone, now situated at the former Waggon and Horses public house. However, it is far more likely that the suffix refers to the Roman road (anciently described as a Stone Street) that ran from Verulamium (modern St Albans), fording the River Beane at Watton-at-Stone. The area where the bridge over the railway was built was shown on tithe maps as a common, and the fields to the east and west of this point were named Stoneyfield and Further Stoneyfield. It is deduced that the Roman Road passed through this area, and the later village took its name from the important routeway. In the 1950s, sections of the road agger, composed of large flint nodules, could still be seen at several points in the village; most obviously, the northern boundary of the grounds of Chestnut House preserves the line of the road\n\nArchaeological finds indicate prehistoric activity in the Watton-at-Stone area before the village was established. The earliest finds are Paleolithic hand axes found in the village and also at the Frogmore gravel pit, and there are traces of a Mesolithic site near the roundabout at the northern end of the bypass. Neolithic pits were found off Station Road and several Neolithic or Bronze Age ring ditches are evident in fields surrounding Watton.\n\nTo the west of the village near Raffin Green is a significant late Bronze Age site and Iron Age enclosure in the Great Humphreys field. It was close to here that the Iron Age \"Aston Mirror\" was found, closer to Watton-at-Stone than to the village of Aston, but technically in Aston parish due to the convoluted border. It is now kept at the British Museum. Another Iron Age enclosure was located by Broom Hall Farm, with an adjacent Roman farmstead and also a nearby Roman crematorium from which 27 burials were extracted. A collection of possibly Belgic armour and weaponry was discovered in the mid-19th century by workers digging a drain to the west of the village.\n\nThe origins of Watton-at-Stone are from the construction of the Roman road, which crossed the High Street at the point of the modern milestone. Archaeological evidence suggests significant Roman activity at the roadside, with a probable Roman building near the Rectory and Roman field boundaries off Station Road suggesting some permanent occupation. Watton was possibly a market place trading to travellers as they slowed to cross the River Beane, and the High Street may have been a pre-existing track and therefore the new Roman road formed a crossroads here.\n\nAnglo-Saxon settlers developed Watton further into a village, with evidence of early Anglo-Saxon field boundaries and a crematorium off Station Road. It is likely that the focus of the Anglo-Saxon settlement was on the high ground at Watton Green, overlooking the Roman road and river valley below. There was a possible battle between the Danes and Saxons which took place on a field named \"Danesfield\" to the west of the village, although the field name is the only evidence to suggest this. If a battle did occur here it would most likely to have been in 911 with 1016 suggested as an alternative possible date.\n\nThe Watton manor was anciently held by the Crown but by 1066 the Lord of Watton manor was Alwin Horne, an Anglo-Saxon thegn who owned other lands at Walkern, Sacombe and Middlesex. Alwin Horne is believed to have fought at the Battle of Stamford Bridge under King Harold in 1066 and later that year killed at the Battle of Hastings.\n\nThe Domesday Book shows that the population of Watton village in 1086 was about 90, consisting of 18 households (10 villagers, 4 smallholders and 4 slaves). The manor was worth £5 and it had a mill, woodland with 100 pigs and a meadow. It was jointly held by Derman (of London) and Alward (the noble), who were both moneyers from London. There was an additional manor associated with Watton that had 6 households and a church, which could have been the Woodhall manor. The first mention by name of the Woodhall manor was in about 1130 when it was held by Ralph de Watton.\n\nDerman's great nephew Henry fitz Ailwin, the first Mayor of London, inherited the Watton manor in 1165. He built a hermitage chapel in what is now Chapel Wood and possibly built a new manor house in what is now Well Wood. At about this time, perhaps as a consequence of Henry fitz Ailwin's new buildings, a new manor called Crowborough emerged from the Watton manor. Crowborough was first referenced in 1266 when it was held by Alice de Rivers. Crowborough Hall stood at Watton Green and the moat which surrounded it can still be seen to this day.\n\nHugh Bardolf inherited Watton manor in 1287, later it was held by John Bardolf and Thomas Bardolf with the Bardolf family owning the Watton and Crowborough manors at various times until 1562. During this period the house and chapel in Well Wood and Chapel Wood were abandoned, and so in circa 1520 the Watton manor was renamed Bardolf manor and the manor house moved to what is now Bardolphs Farm. A new manor called Watkins Hall was created and was first known to be held by Thomas Munden in about 1540.\n\nPhilip Boteler (Butler) inherited the Woodhall estate in about 1375 and later descendants to have the title included Philip Butler and John Boteler who held the Watton, Woodhall and Crowborough manors. The three estates were in possession of the Botelers (Butlers) until as late as 1780.\n\nIn 1662 brothers Maurice Thomson and Sir William Thompson, who had grown up in the village, founded Watton's first free school for 20 poor children.\n\nAfter Woodhall was mostly destroyed by fire in 1771, from which an elderly John Boteler was able to escape, building of the new house began in 1775. The notorious Thomas Rumbold took possession of Woodhall in 1777, followed by Paul Benfield in 1793. The estate was then bought in 1801 by Samuel Smith and the Smith family later combined the Watton, Woodhall and Crowborough manors into one and still holds it today.\n\nIn later years, the natural springs in the area once made the village a popular spa town. The village has a number of dwellings dating from early Tudor, such as \"Watton Place\", through to late Georgian constructions.\n\nThe parish church is dedicated to St Andrew and St Mary. It stands on thirteenth century foundations and dates from the early-mid fifteenth century, and is built in the Perpendicular style.\nA chapel was added to the north side of the church in the late fifteenth century. The building is constructed from flint, and is protected by a Grade II* heritage listing.\n\nThe evangelical author and social campaigner Edward Bickersteth was rector of the church for twenty years from 1830 until his death in 1850. His one-time curate was the theological scholar Thomas Birks.\n\nJack Meyer, the Somerset cricketer and founder of Millfield School grew up in the old Georgian red-brick rectory overlooking the cricket field, his father was the vicar of the church.\nIn the summer of 1923, Alan Turing and his family stayed with their friends the Meyer family for six weeks at the rectory, Alan being the founder of computer science and the leading cryptologist at Bletchley Park in World War II. Andrew Hodges in his biography: \"Alan Turing: The Enigma\" tells of how a gypsy fortune teller at the church fête foretold that he would be a genius.\n\nThe locomotive engineer Sir Nigel Gresley lived in Watton House until his death in 1941.\n\nWatton-at-Stone was the childhood home of the actor Rupert Grint, well-known from his role of Ron Weasley in the \"Harry Potter\" film series.\n\nWatton was home to the boxing promoter Frank Warren.\n\nFootballer Harry Toffolo grew up in the village.\n\nThe name is also spelled unhyphenated as Watton at Stone and appears in this form on Ordnance Survey maps. The County Council favours the hyphenated version. Both spellings are equally valid.\n\nLocally, the '-at-Stone' suffix is frequently dropped.\n\n"}

He is the only son and eldest child of billionaire American businessman and former United States presidential candidate Ross Perot.\n\nPerot was born and raised in Dallas, the son of Margot (née Birmingham) and Ross Perot. He graduated from St. Mark's School of Texas in 1977. After graduating from Vanderbilt University, he served in the United States Air Force for eight and a half years.\n\nIn 1982 Perot co-piloted the first flight by helicopter around the world. Using a Bell 206 L-1 Long Ranger II, Perot completed the circumnavigation on September 30, 1982.\n\nPerot serves as chairman of The Perot Group, which manages the various Perot family interests that include real estate, oil and gas, and financial investments. He developed the Fort Worth Alliance Airport and is a large real estate developer. Hillwood's residential division, is building Harvest, a $1 billion, 1,150-acre development in Northlake and Argyle. Hillwood Communities recently kicked off developments including the 1006.5 acres development Pomona in Manvel, TX and the 787-acre Union Park in Little Elm.\n\nFrom 2002-2003, Perot served as chairman of the Texas Governor's Task Force for Economic Growth. In March 2007, presidential candidate Mitt Romney, seeking the Republican Party nomination selected Perot as a member of his Texas finance committee.\n\nPerot was a member of the Board of Directors for Dell Inc. Perot is a board member of Guide IT. He is Chairman of the United States Air Force Memorial Foundation and Co-Chairman of the EastWest Institute. He also sits on the Board of Trustees of St. Mark's School of Texas, Southern Methodist University, and Vanderbilt University. In 2010 \"Forbes\" reported Perot's net worth at $1.5 Billion. Perot was the 1983 recipient of the Langley Gold Medal from the Smithsonian Institution..\n\nIn April 2020, Governor Greg Abbott named Perot to the Strike Force to Open Texas – a group \"tasked with finding safe and effective ways to slowly reopen the state\" amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nPerot purchased the Dallas Mavericks NBA basketball team from original owner Don Carter in March 1996. Under his four-year tenure, the Mavericks made no more progress on the court than they had in Carter's final seasons, and nowhere near what they would do under his successor, Mark Cuban. It was said that he was a basketball novice, or disinterested in the sport and was using his position as team owner to front his projects, most notably Victory Park, which was anchored by the American Airlines Center which opened in 2001. He sold the team to Cuban in January 2000 and the franchise did not have a losing season in fifteen subsequent afterward, winning two Western Conference championships and the 2011 NBA championship.\n\nIn May 2010, Perot, who retained 5 percent ownership, filed a lawsuit against Cuban, alleging the franchise was insolvent or in imminent danger of insolvency. In June 2010, Cuban responded in a court filing maintaining Perot is wrongly seeking money to offset some $100 million in losses on the Victory Park real estate development. The lawsuit was dismissed in 2011, due in part to Cuban asserting proper management of the team due to its recent victory in the 2011 NBA Finals. In 2014, the 5th Circuit Court affirmed that decision on appeal. Following his initial defeat, Perot attempted to shut out Mavericks fans from use of the parking lots he controlled near the American Airlines Center. Perot retains a minority stake in the team, as does his predecessor Carter's estate.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2330043", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2330043", "title": "Xanthoria parietina", "text": "Xanthoria parietina\n\nXanthoria parietina is a \"foliose\", or leafy, lichen. It has wide distribution, and many common names such as common orange lichen, yellow scale, maritime sunburst lichen and shore lichen. It can be found near the shore on rocks or walls (hence the epithet \"parietina\" meaning \"on walls\"), and also on inland rocks, walls, or tree bark. It was chosen as a model organism for genomic sequencing (planned in 2006) by the US Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (JGI).\nThe species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, as \"Lichen parietinus\".\n\nThe vegetative body of the lichen, the thallus, is foliose, and typically less than wide. The lobes of the thallus are 1–4 mm in diameter, and flattened down. The upper surface is some shade of yellow, orange, or greenish yellow, while the lower surface is white, with a cortex, and with sparse pale rhizines or hapters. The vegetative reproductive structures soredia and isidia are absent in this species, however, apothecia are usually present.\n\nThe outer \"skin\" of the lichen, the cortex, is composed of closely packed fungal hyphae and serves to protect the thallus from water loss due to evaporation as well as harmful effects of high levels of irradiation. In \"Xanthoria parietina\", the thickness of the thalli is known to vary depending on the habitat in which it grows. Thalli are much thinner in shady locations than in those exposed to full sunshine; this has the effect of protecting the algae that cannot tolerate high light intensities. The lichen pigment parietin gives this species a deep yellow or orange-red color.\n\n\"X. parietina\" prefers growing on bark and wood; it is found more rarely on rock. Nutrient enrichment by bird droppings enhances the ability of \"X. parietina\" to grow on rock.\n\nThe photosynthetic symbionts, or photobionts, associated with \"X. parietina\" are from the green algal genus \"Trebouxia\". Species that have been found include \"Trebouxia arboricola\" and \"T. irregularis\". Both of these photobionts are known to occur free-living in nature, having been found on bark colonized by \"X. parietina\" as well as on bark not colonized by lichens.\n\nIn one study, the photobiont was shown to occupy 7% of the volume of the thallus. The density of pigmentation of the upper cortex also varies and seems to control the amount of light reaching the algae.\n\nA large number of lichens disperse very effectively by means of symbiotic vegetative propagules such as soredia, isidia and blastidia, and thallus fragmentation. However, \"X. parietina\" does not produce such vegetative propagules, but must establish the symbiotic state at each reproductive cycle. Two oribatid mite species, \"Trhypochtonius tectorum\" and \"Trichoribates trimaculatus\", which are common inhabitants and consumers of \"X. parietina\", are vectors of the photobiont cells. Faecal pellets of both species contain both viable ascospores and photobiont cells, and are suggested to be a common mode of short- and long-distance dispersal of this species.\n\n\"X. parietina\" occurs in hardwood forests in broad, low-elevation valleys, as well as scattered on \"Populus\" and other hardwoods in riparian areas in agricultural and populated areas. It is often associated with high level of nitrogen and favored by eutrophication, and can be often found near farmland and around livestock.\n\nThe species is widespread, and has been reported from Australia, Africa, Asia, North America and throughout much of Europe. In eastern North America and Europe, it is found more frequently near coastal locations. The increases in nitrate deposition as a result of industrial and agricultural developments in southern Ontario, Canada in the 20th century are thought to be responsible for the reappearance of this species in the local lichen flora.\n\n\"Xanthoria parietina\" is a very pollution-tolerant species. In laboratory experiments, this species can tolerate exposure to air contaminants and bisulphite ions with little or no damaging effect. It is also tolerant of heavy metal contamination.\n\nFor these reasons, this species has found use as a biomonitor for measuring levels of toxic elements.\n\n\"X. parietina\" produces an orange colored anthraquinone pigment, parietin, that is deposited as tiny crystals in the top layer of the upper cortex. Parietin synthesis is enhanced by UV-B, and stimulated by photosynthates, such as those provided by the green algal \"Trebouxia\" symbiont. \"X. parietina\" also produces the metabolite 2-methoxy-4,5,7-trihydroxy-anthraquinone.\n\nThe water extract of \"X. parietina\" has good antiviral activity \"in vitro\", inhibiting the replication of human parainfluenza virus type 2. In the past it was used as a remedy for jaundice because of its yellow color.\n\n"}

It currently ranks third in size after Kruger National Park and the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park.\n\nThe original section of the park was founded in 1931, in part due to the efforts of Sydney Skaife, in order to provide a sanctuary for the eleven remaining elephants in the area. The park has proved to be very successful and currently houses more than 600 elephants and a large number of other mammals.\n\nThe original park has subsequently been expanded to include the Woody Cape Nature Reserve that extends from the Sundays River mouth towards Alexandria and a marine reserve, which includes St. Croix Island and Bird Island, both breeding habitat for gannets and penguins, not to mention a large variety of other marine life. Bird Island is home to the world's largest breeding colony of gannets - about 120,000 birds - and also hosts the second largest breeding colony of African penguins, the largest breeding colony being St. Croix island. These marine assets form part of the plan to expand the 1,640 km² Addo National Elephant Park into the 3,600 km² \"Greater Addo Elephant National Park\".\n\nThe expansion will mean not only that the park contains five of South Africa's seven major vegetation zones (biomes), but also that it will be the only park in the world to house Africa's \"Big 7“ (elephant, rhinoceros, lion, buffalo, leopard, whale and great white shark) in their natural habitat.\n\nThe flora within the AENP is quite varied, and like all plant life, is a central factor to the ecological system in place. Several species of rare and endemic plants, particularly succulent shrubs and geophytes are native to the South African region within the AENP. Many species are under environmental pressure, however, and are facing possible extinction.\n\nMore than 600 elephants, 400 Cape buffaloes, over 48 endangered black rhinos \"(Diceros bicornis michaeli)\" as well as a variety of antelope species. Lion and spotted hyena have also recently been re-introduced to the area. The largest remaining population of the flightless dung beetle (\"Circellium bacchus\") is located within the park.\n\nTwo major environmental issues facing the AENP: extinction and overpopulation, which are interrelated. Since the AENP's original mission was to reintroduce certain mega-herbivores, like the African elephant and black rhinoceros, primary ecological efforts were made to preserve mammalian species. However, by overlooking the other contributors to this environmental chain, certain plant species have been subjected to overgrazing and trampling, mostly by the elephants of the park. This overgrazing and trampling not only destroys much of the plant life, but also forces it to adapt its physiology to stimuli that are not inherent to its evolutionary progress. Some biologists argue that it is not herbivorization alone that is threatening the flora, but a number of other ecological factors including zoochory and nutrient cycling. Up to 77 species of South African endemic plant species have been listed as \"vulnerable to elephant browsing.\"\n\nThe Addo Elephant National Park Marine Protected Area and Bird Island Marine Protected Area are associated with the park.\n\nIn 2018 the highest visitor count in the park's 87-year history was recorded. The park received 305,510 visitors between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018 (up from 265,585 in the previous year). International visitors make up 55% of this number, with German, Dutch and British nationals in the majority.\n\nThere is a main camp, featuring a swimming pool, restaurant, flood lit water hole and various accommodation, four other rest camps and four camps run by concessionaires. The main entrance as well as two looped tourist roads in the park are tarred while the others are graveled. There is also an additional access road through the southern block of the park feeding off the N2 highway near Colchester; it joins up with the existing tourist roads in the park.\n\n\n"}

In 1914, Bianchi emigrated to the United States. By 1918, he was an actor in Hollywood with the Arbuckle Company, performing in over 35 silent short comedies by the early 1920s, and then, in such feature-length action comedy-thrillers as \"Play Safe\" (1927). A large excerpt from this movie is included in Robert Youngson's compilation film \"Days of Thrills and Laughter\" (1961).\n\nWith the arrival of sound films, Banks's strong Italian accent forced him to phase out his acting career in favor of working as a gagman and director. He directed Laurel and Hardy in their film \"Great Guns\", under the name \"Montague Banks\".\n\nHe was married to Gladys Frazin. The marriage was not a happy one and they divorced on 29 April 1932 as a result of her abusive behaviour. She subsequently committed suicide in March 1939. He met singer and actress Gracie Fields in 1935, subsequently directed her in four of her films, and they married in March 1940. As an Italian national, he would have been classified as an 'enemy alien' in Britain during World War II. Consequently, he and Fields left the UK for Canada initially, and then the neutral United States in order to prevent his internment. Italian American internment also came into place in the United States during 1941 and 1942, affecting thousands of Italians, but this was eventually relaxed.\n\nHe held dual Italian and U.S. citizenship. He died on the Orient Express train outside Arona, Italy, of a heart attack, aged 52.\n\nIn his home town of Cesena a foundation was created in honor of Banks, entitled the Aula Didattica Monty Banks. It is \"an initiative promoted by the Comune, the course is open to all and provides the opportunity to create videos\".\n\n\n"}

Founded on 22 August 1949, it plays in Segunda División, holding home games at the Estadio Gran Canaria, with a capacity of 32,400 seats.\n\nThe club remains the only one in Spanish football to achieve back-to-back promotions to La Liga in its first two seasons. It had a 19-year run in the competition, ending in 1982–83. They have been promoted to La Liga on three additional occasions since that time (a total of eight additional seasons), most recently from 2015 to 2018.\n\nIts main rivals are Tenerife from said neighbouring island. Las Palmas and Tenerife contest the Canary Islands derby. The two clubs are among the most isolated professional football clubs in Europe, since they play their away games on the distant Spanish mainland.\n\nEven though the club registered with the Royal Spanish Football Federation on 6 June 1949, UD Las Palmas was officially founded on 22 August of that year, as the result of a merger between all five clubs on the island: \"Club Deportivo Gran Canaria\", \"Atlético Club de Fútbol\", \"Real Club Victoria\", \"Arenas Club\" and \"Marino Fútbol Club\". The union was to create a club strong enough to keep Canarian players on the island and not to seek a better career on the mainland.\n\nDebate was held on the name of the club, which it was agreed would not include the names of any of its predecessors. An early option, \"Deportivo Canarias\", was scrapped due to referring to the Canary Islands on a whole rather than the island of Gran Canaria. The name \"Las Palmas\" by itself was also put forward, and then rejected due to the name having already been taken by a defunct club in the city; \"Unión Deportiva Las Palmas\" was finally chosen due to its connection to the union which created the team, and its home city of Las Palmas. The first training session at the new club was held on 16 September 1949.\n\nLas Palmas finished second in their first season in the Tercera División (1949–50), ranking third in the following year's Segunda División to reach La Liga for the first time ever, and became the first Spanish club to achieve consecutive promotions in its first two years of existence. The first season in the top flight ended, however, in relegation, but the team returned to the category in 1954, going on to enjoy a six-year spell.\n\nAfter Las Palmas returned to La Liga at the end of the 1963–64 season, again as champions, the club went on to have their most successful spell in the competition. Managed by Vicente Dauder, they finished third in 1967–68 behind Real Madrid and FC Barcelona, and four club players made the Spain squad which hosted and won the UEFA Euro 1964 tournament; the following season the team fared even better and only lost the league to Real Madrid, and thus qualified for European competition for the first time in its history, appearing in the 1969–70 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup and being knocked out in the first round by Germany's Hertha BSC (0–0 home draw, 0–1 away loss).\n\nLas Palmas player Juan Guedes died suddenly on 9 March 1971 at the age of 28. The next season, French coach Pierre Sinibaldi led the club to the fifth place, with subsequent qualification for the UEFA Cup: after disposing of Torino F.C. and ŠK Slovan Bratislava, the Spaniards bowed out to Dutch club FC Twente; at the end of 1974–75 another team player, Tonono – a defender who played with Guedes – died of a liver infection.\n\nLas Palmas' third appearance in European competition came with the 1977–78 UEFA Cup, where they defeated FK Sloboda Tuzla of Yugoslavia in the first round before falling to the English side Ipswich Town. Under the management of Miguel Muñoz, and with players such as Argentines Miguel Ángel Brindisi, Daniel Carnevali (the first to arrive in 1973), Carlos Morete and Quique Wolff, the club also reached their first final of the Copa del Rey in that year, losing on 19 April to Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium (1–3).\n\nFrom the 1990s onwards, Las Palmas played mainly in the Segunda División, but also spent six years in Segunda División B – the new third level created in 1977 – and, from 2000–02, competed in the top flight. On 3 October 2001 the side managed a 4–2 home win against Real Madrid, with youth product Rubén Castro scoring two goals for the hosts, but the season ended nonetheless in relegation. On the 22 December 2001, Las Palmas played its 1,000th game in La Liga. In the 2009-10 season in Segunda División the club finished 17th, just one point away from being relegated to Segunda División B. On 21 June 2015, Las Palmas was promoted back to La Liga after defeating Real Zaragoza on the away goals rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLas Palmas has used farm teams since 1954, but its official B-team, Las Palmas Atlético, was founded in 1976. A third side was founded in 2006 and reached the highest division of regional football, the \"Preferente\", before folding in 2010 and being re-created the following season.\n\nThe club also had a women's team in the top division between 2009 and 2011. In 2010 Las Palmas founded an indoor football team for the Liga de Fútbol Indoor, staging matches at the \"Centro Insular de Deportes\". There are also some affiliated eams with Las Palmas in the minor leagues in the island some teams are: UD Almenara, UD San Fernando and more. \n\nLas Palmas' badge is a blue shield with yellow scrolls on top with the club's name, city and archipelago. The municipal arms, granted by the city's mayor, feature in the centre of the design. Underneath lie the five crests of the clubs which united in 1949 to create the club: from left to right – Victoria, Arenas, Deportivo, Marino and Atlético; a smaller white scroll above them displays the city motto \"Segura tiene la palma\".\n\nIn Spanish football, many clubs possess royal patronage and thus are permitted to use the prefix \"Real\" in their name and use an image of the Spanish crown. Las Palmas does not have such patronage, but tops its crest with the Spanish crown due to the patronage held by Real Club Victoria.\n\nThe crest is the central emblem of the club flag, a horizontal bicolour with yellow on top and blue underneath. The flag of the island of Gran Canaria uses these colours diagonally.\n\n"}
