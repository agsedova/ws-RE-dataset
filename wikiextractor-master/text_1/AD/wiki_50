{"id": "2251161", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2251161", "title": "Damien: Omen II", "text": "Damien: Omen II\n\nDamien: Omen II is a 1978 American-British supernatural horror film directed by Don Taylor, starring William Holden, Lee Grant, and Jonathan Scott-Taylor. The film was the second installment in \"The Omen\" series, set seven years after the first film, and was followed by a third installment, \"\", in 1981.\n\nThis was Lew Ayres' final film role and the film debut of Meshach Taylor. The official tagline of the film is \"The First Time Was Only a Warning.\" Leo McKern reprises his role as Carl Bugenhagen from the original film. McKern is the only cast member of the series to appear as the same character in more than one installment, although actor Tommy Duggan appears in the first and third installments of the series as different characters.\n\nA week after Robert and Katherine Thorn are buried, archaeologist Carl Bugenhagen learns that their adopted son Damien is alive. Confiding to his friend Michael Morgan that Damien is the Antichrist, Bugenhagen wants him to give Damien's guardian a box containing the means to kill Damien. As Morgan is unconvinced, Bugenhagen takes him to a local ruin to see the mural of Yigael's Wall, which was said to have been drawn by a monk who saw the Devil and had visions of the Antichrist as he would appear from birth to death. Though Morgan believes him upon seeing an ancient depiction of the Antichrist with Damien's face, both he and Bugenhagen are buried alive as the tunnel collapses on them.\n\nSeven years later, the 12-year-old Damien is living in Chicago with his uncle, industrialist Richard Thorn and his wife, Ann. Damien gets along well with his cousin Mark, Richard's son from his first marriage, with whom he is enrolled in a military academy. However, Damien is despised by Richard's aunt, Marion, who sees him as a bad influence on Mark and demands that they be separated. She dies of a heart attack after being visited by a raven in the dead of night.\n\nAt Thorn Industries, manager Paul Buher suggests expanding the company's operations into agriculture; however, the project is shelved by senior manager Bill Atherton, who calls Buher's intention of buying up land in the process unethical. At Mark's birthday party, Buher introduces himself to Damien, invites him to see the plant, and also speaks of his approaching initiation. Buher seemingly makes up with Atherton, who drowns after falling through the ice at a hockey game on a frozen lake the following day.\n\nAn investigative reporter named Joan Hart, a friend of Thorn Museum curator Dr. Charles Warren, arrives in Chicago and attempts to interview Richard. When she asks about his brother's involvement with Bugenhagen, Richard angrily ends the interview. Having recently seen Yigael's Wall herself, Joan is horrified when she visits the academy and sees Damien in person. She drives away in a panic, but her car mysteriously stalls. The raven appears and attacks Joan by pecking out her eyes. She is killed by a semi-truck after wandering blindly into its path.\n\nMeanwhile, at the academy, Damien's new commander, Sergeant Neff, is revealed to be a secret Satanist. Damien learns his true nature, and flees the Academy grounds. Later, Dr. David Pasarian is killed when he and his assistant suffocate from toxic fumes during an industrial accident. The incident injures Damien's class, who were visiting the plant at the time. When Damien alone is found to be unharmed by the fumes, a doctor suggests keeping him in the hospital as a precaution. The doctor discovers that Damien's marrow cells resemble those of a jackal; before he can investigate any further or report his findings, however, he is killed by a falling elevator cable.\n\nMeanwhile, Bugenhagen's box has been found during an excavation of the ruins and delivered to the Thorn Museum. Dr. Warren opens it and finds the Seven Daggers of Megiddo, the only weapons able to kill Damien, along with a letter by Bugenhagen explaining that Damien is the Antichrist. Warren rushes to inform Richard. Mark overhears their conversation and confronts Damien. Reluctantly, and then proudly, admitting to being the Devil's son, Damien pleads with Mark to join him on his rise to power, but Mark's steadfast refusal forces Damien to kill Mark by causing an aneurysm in his cousin's brain.\n\nShaken by his son's death, Richard goes to New York City to see a half-crazed Warren before being taken to the train station where Yigael's Wall is being stored in a cargo carrier. As he sees Damien's image, a switching locomotive impales Warren and crushes him against the carriage, destroying the wall and convincing Richard beyond doubt that Damien is the Antichrist. Upon his return, Richard has Damien picked up from his graduation at the academy while taking Ann to the museum. When they find the daggers in Warren's office in the Thorn Museum, Ann uses them to kill Richard, revealing herself to be a Satanist who \"always belonged to him\". Having heard the altercation from an outside corridor, Damien wills a nearby boiler room to explode, setting fire to the building; Ann is consumed in the flames. Damien then leaves the burning museum and is picked up by the family driver, Murray, as the fire department arrives.\n\n\nDavid Seltzer, who wrote the first film's screenplay, was asked by the producers to write the second. Seltzer refused, for he had no interest in writing sequels. Years later he commented that had he written the story for the second \"Omen\", he would have set it the day after the first movie, with Damien a child living in the White House. With Seltzer turning down \"Omen II\", producer Harvey Bernhard duly outlined the story himself, and Stanley Mann was hired to write the screenplay.\n\nAfter Bernhard had finished writing the story outline and was given the green light to start the production, the first person he contacted was Jerry Goldsmith because of the composer's busy schedule. Bernhard also felt that Goldsmith's music for \"The Omen\" was the highest point of that movie, and that without Goldsmith's music, the sequel would not be successful. Goldsmith's \"Omen II\" score uses similar motifs to his original \"Omen\" score, but for the most part he avoided re-using the same musical cues. In fact, the first movie's famous \"Ave Satani\" theme is used only partially, just before the closing credits begin. Goldsmith composed a largely different main title theme for \"Omen II\", albeit one that utilises Latin phrases as \"Ave Satani\" had done. Goldsmith's \"Omen II\" score allows eerie choral effects and unusual electronic sound designs to take precedence over the piano and gothic chanting.\n\nRichard Donner, director of the first \"Omen\" movie, was not available to direct the second; he was busy working on \"Superman\". British film director Mike Hodges was hired to helm the movie. During production, the producers believed that Hodges' methods were too slow, and so they fired him and replaced him with Don Taylor, who had a reputation for finishing films on time and under budget. However, the few scenes Hodges directed (some of the footage at the factory and at the military academy, all of the early archaeology scenes, and the dinner where Aunt Marion shows her concern about Damien) remained in the completed film, for which Hodges retains a story credit. In later interviews, Hodges commented sanguinely on his experiences working on \"Omen II\".\n\nAcademy Award-winning veteran actor William Holden was considered to star as Robert Thorn in the first \"Omen\", but turned it down as he did not want to star in a picture about the devil. Gregory Peck was selected as his replacement. \"The Omen\" went on to become a huge hit, and Holden made sure he did not turn down the part of protagonist Richard Thorn in the sequel. Lee Grant, another Oscar-winner, was a fan of the first \"Omen\", and accepted enthusiastically the role of Ann Thorn.\n\nRay Berwick (1914–1990) trained and handled the crows used for several scenes in the film. Live birds and a crow-puppet were used for the attack on photojournalist Joan Hart. Berwick also trained the avian actors in Alfred Hitchcock's \"The Birds\" (1963).\n\nThe movie was mainly set in Chicago and was largely filmed in that city's downtown. The Thorn Industries building was actually Chicago City Hall. Another scene took place at Graceland Cemetery. Scenes set at a New York City freight yard were also shot in Chicago, with the CBOT Tower and the Willis Tower visible in the background.\n\nOther locations included Lake Forest Academy's campus, which was used as the Thorn Mansion, the Northwestern Military and Naval Academy's Geneva Lake campus, which was used for the military academy, with real Geneva Lake students portraying most of the academy cadets, and the Murphy Estate on Catfish Lake in Eagle River, Wisconsin for the skating scene, with local children playing the skaters. The Field Museum of Natural History, depicting the Thorn Museum, was also used in several scenes throughout the film, including some of its final minutes.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film received an approval rating of 44% based on 25 reviews, with an average rating of 5.11/10. The site's consenus states: \"\"Damien\" dishes out ghoulish scares and a biblical body count to generate some morbid fun, but this repetitious sequel lacks the sophistication of its predecessor.\"\n\nVincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"Perhaps my resistance has given out but 'Damien—Omen II,' though it's as foolish as the first film, is rather more fun to watch and sometimes very stylish-looking.\" \"Variety\" wrote, \"Damien is obviously wearing out his welcome, but presold interest and a couple of gruesome, ghastly death scenes should shore up business for the summer.\" Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" found it inferior to the original because \"there's nothing particularly surprising or horrifying about a teen-ager in league with the devil. Also, the commotion the kid inspires this time is not particularly frightening.\" Gary Arnold of \"The Washington Post\" wrote, \"Far from advancing the unsavory premise of the first film, this one doggedly retraces its steps. The result is an inferior copy rather than a narrative continuation.\" Charles Champlin of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote, \"For all its slavish copying of the original, 'Damien — Omen II' plays differently. It's a hoot instead of a scream. Its deaths are frequent and exceedingly graphic, but you wait for them as for the acts on a variety bill. The connective tissue is frailer this time, and there is almost no accumulation of suspense.\" Richard Combs of \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" wrote, \"The main trouble with the Evil One as a protagonist is that his opposition never looks very convincing—and like its predecessor, \"Omen II\" is based on a rather lame structure in which successive individuals discover something amiss about Damien and then meet an inexorably bloody end.\"\nThe film grossed $26.5 million in the United States and Canada, generating theatrical rentals of $12.1 million. Worldwide, it earned rentals of $20.6 million compared to $46.3 million for the original. \n\nUnlike \"The Omen\" (and \"\"), Jerry Goldsmith's score was recorded in the US, with the soundtrack album re-recorded in Britain for financial reasons. Lionel Newman conducted both the film and album versions; Varèse Sarabande later released an expanded CD including both, the liner notes of which explain the reasons behind the re-recording (a short-lived union rule meant that musicians had to be paid the full amount for the film use AND album use if the soundtrack was released on LP, doubling their fee. It was cheaper, therefore, to re-record in the UK than pay the orchestra double in the US). The liner notes also explain that some of the soundtrack's pieces have been re-written slightly or even merged for the album re-recording. The audio quality of these UK-recorded album tracks also sounds noticeably more dynamic. Some sections of the film's soundtrack – the tapes of which were thought lost for many years – were discovered to have warped in storage and have noticeable and uncorrectable flaws. (The film soundtrack is listed from track 11 onwards).\n\nThe film was released on videocassette during the 1980s and 1990s. In 2000, it was part of \"The Omen Quadrilogy\" DVD set released in the US and UK, and was not available separately until 2005. In 2006, to coincide with the DVD release of the remake of the original film, \"The Omen\" and its sequels were released individually and together in an ultimate Pentalogy boxset digitally remastered and with more bonus features. In 2008, it was released on Blu-ray with its predecessor and 1981 sequel, \"\". It is the only film in its series not currently available for online downloading, although Amazon had it on its 'Add to Watchlist' and is available through them for download as well as streaming video with a Cinemax subscription, alongside its predecessor, sequels and remake, all of which are downloadable through Amazon, Apple's iTunes and Vudu. It is now available for download with its original predecessor and sequels in an Omen 4-pack \"bundle\" set through Apple's iTunes and Vudu.\n\n"}

He was called to the Quebec Bar in 1972 and was created a Queen's Counsel in 1987. In 1970, he married Francine Vallée. They had three children: Mélanie, Julie and Catherine.\n\nIn 1986, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada and was promoted to Officer in 1993. In 2006, he was made an Officer of the National Order of Quebec. In 1999, he was inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nHe was a member of the National Hockey League's Board of Governors. He is the former president of the Canadian Olympic Committee and is currently a Quebec City-based lawyer with the law firm BCF.\n\nHe was also instrumental in the defections of Anton, Marian and Peter Šťastný from communist Czechoslovakia to play for the Quebec Nordiques.\n\nWhen the Nordiques drafted future NHL superstar Eric Lindros in the 1991 draft, Lindros refused to play for the team. It was later revealed by Lindros in a 2016 interview that this decision was based entirely on Aubut \"The decision to not play for Quebec was based solely on the owner,\" Lindros said in reference to Aubut. \"It had nothing to do with language, culture, [or] city. Keep in mind, my wife is French [from Quebec]. I was not going to play for that individual -- period.\"\n\nAubut was President of the Nordiques when the team was sold to an American communications company and moved to Denver in 1995, becoming the Colorado Avalanche. \"Maclean's\" magazine reported that Aubut personally made $15 million from the sale and that T-shirts reading \"Marcel Aubut: Wanted Dead or Alive\" were not an uncommon sight in Quebec City at the time.\n\nRecently, he proposed Quebec City as home of a new NHL team. Aubut argued that with the new NHL collective bargaining agreement and the coming 400th anniversary of Quebec City in 2008, the city could build a new arena and/or a stadium.\n\nOn October 9, 2009 Aubut met with NHL commissioner Gary Bettman. The meeting reportedly dealt with plans for a brand new Quebec arena. The unofficial details were that the city of Quebec was a leading candidate for a new franchise or one for relocation. An agreement for a new arena was reached in March 2012.\n\nAubut was named a member at large of the Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) in 2000, and was elected to the Board of Governors and Executive Committee in 2005. In 2009, he was voted in as President-elect of the COC, taking over from Michael A. Chambers following the 2010 Winter Olympics in the spring of 2010. Aubut was the first francophone ever elected President of the COC.\n\nDuring his time as President, Aubut greatly raised the profile of Canada's Olympic athletes and expanded the COC's operations, with corresponding increases in revenues and expenditures supporting amateur sport. In 2014 Aubut was acclaimed to a second four-year term as President. He served as a member of the Board of the organizing committee for the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver and the 2015 Pan American Games in Toronto, and was appointed to the International Relations Commission of the International Olympic Committee.\n\nOn September 25, 2015, the COC received a complaint from a staff member at the Canadian Olympic Foundation alleging sexual harassment by Aubut. One week later, two other women came forward with allegations and the investigation was expanded. The Foundation, a charitable organization that raises money for Olympic sport, shares office space with the COC in Toronto. On September 30, 2015, Aubut and the COC announced that he would step aside as President of the COC and Chair of the Foundation while the COC investigation into the matter was conducted. The COC engaged retired Quebec Superior Court justice François Rolland as an independent investigator. After more allegations against Aubut appeared in the press, Aubut resigned as President of the COC on October 3, 2015.\n\n"}

{"id": "2251164", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2251164", "title": "Carrier (video game)", "text": "Carrier (video game)\n\nA cancelled sequel for the PlayStation 2 titled \"Carrier: The Next Mutation\" was once planned for release.\n\nDespite the basic attributes of the game's controls, there were additional features to make the gameplay more unique.\n\n\"Carrier\" contains at least two notable bugs and glitches. The first notable one is that the game will occasionally enter a wireframe 3D mode for no explicit reason. In other situations, the handgun—called the \"11'teen O' Clock\" will be called and described as a flamethrower.\n\nThe background to \"Carrier\" involves some reading into as the current events in the game are influenced by past organizations that are pivotal to the storyline. Following the year 2008, the world faced an economical decline as natural resources and agriculture had reached a new low. A massive political divide ensued as the leaders of advanced nations decided to restrict the transportation of aid and agricultural items to their respective countries: those on the Southern Hemisphere and those on the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nNaturally this caused a massive decrease in trade and employment for both sides that sparked great economic and moral criticism from the G77, a political organization formed by seventy-seven different southern countries.\nAs conditions worsened for the southern countries, terrorist activity arose from the south, so much that the terrorist leaders formed a large group known as the Southern Cross. Southern Cross activity in Colombia caught the concern of the US military, so much that the US took a militaristic stand against terrorist activity and started the US-G77 Crisis, though the G77 claimed to have been uninvolved in the Southern Cross activities. Despite this, the leaders of the northern countries organized an international enforcement known as the NTA (Northern Treaty Alliance) to assist the north's military strength against terrorist activity. The US military added to this by constructing larger bases and vehicles against the Southern Cross, including a base in Mozambique and an enormous and technologically advanced aircraft carrier named Heimdal.\n\nWith the Heimdal as the US Navy's largest nuclear-powered aircraft carrier ever constructed and capable of launching a barrage of ballistic missiles, the carrier soon demonstrated its power on a mission called Operation Hurricane. Three Special Forces divisions were placed on the Heimdal to carry out an attack on a Southern Cross base as well as to pick up an ancient organism said to have been located somewhere in the South Pacific. The next day after the transportation of the organism, sabotage struck the engine room, though the Heimdal could still make its course back to American shores. Two days afterward, the Heimdal exhibited a period of radio silence, yet the ship was still heading for shore through the Pacific.\n\nIt's here that an NTA investigation team known as SPARC is sent to enter the Heimdal and discover what caused the radio silence. The first team that was originally sent in landed and entered the ship safely, but were quickly silenced; a second team was sent in afterwards, hopefully to assist the previous team. When the team's helicopter starts to land on the Heimdal, the Heimdal's guns automatically lock-on to the chopper and shoot it down, separating the team aboard the Heimdal. It's from here that very odd but dangerous mutants attack the main characters in their search for the truth.\n\nJeff Lundrigan reviewed the Dreamcast version of the game for \"Next Generation\", rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \"Well made and reasonably entertaining, but nothing you haven't seen before.\"\n\nAllGame gave \"Carrier\" a three out of five rating, noting that \"there are plenty of aspects to Carrier for die-hard survival horror fans to appreciate, but ultimately, the title suffers from a number of problems and quirks that keep it from being anything more than average\". The review noted that the large environments lead to a tedious amount of backtracking and that \"when there are a lot of objects on the screen, the game slows to a crawl. This makes boss battles particularly obnoxious, since most bosses are fairly huge, and when you are with them, the game sputters along as if it were in slow motion.\"\n\n"}

SHOs are supervised in their work by consultants and registrars. In training posts these registrars and consultants oversee training and are usually their designated clinical supervisors.\n\nThe same structure to junior doctor grades also applied previously in the National Health Service in the UK, and informal use of the term persists there. \n\nNCHD grades in order, from most junior to most senior:\n\nIn Ireland, doctors typically spend one year as an intern, before becoming a Senior House Officer (SHO). Most doctors spend between 2-4 years working as an SHO. Advancing to registrar level is dependent on experience and aptitude within a specialty; in most cases, becoming a registrar depends primarily on having successfully passed postgraduate examinations such as MRCP/MRCS, although this is not a strict requirement. Most doctors work at registrar level for 1-3 years before being accepted onto a training programme in a particular subspecialty (e.g. Cardiology), after which time, they are known as SpRs (Specialist Registrars). SpR programmes typically last for between 3-6 years. On completion of an SpR programme, doctors are eligible to apply for consultant positions, although the majority opt to undertake 1-2 years of fellowship training -often abroad- prior to appointment at consultant level.\n\nSince the introduction of Modernising Medical Careers (MMC), grades in the UK differ from those in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nBefore MMC, doctors applied for SHO posts after completing their mandatory pre-registration house officer (PRHO) year after qualifying from medical school. They would typically work as an SHO for 2–3 years, or occasionally longer, before going on to a certain subspeciality where they would take up a specialist registrar post to train as a specialist in that particular field . To qualify for these, SHOs had to be in posts approved by a regional postgraduate dean, as well as passing postgraduate exams (such as the Membership of the Royal College of Physicians, MRCP). SHO jobs typically lasted 4 or 6 months in various departments and were often provided in 1- or 2-year rotations.\n\nIn 2002, the Department of Health announced reforms in the training of newly qualified doctors under the banner of \"Modernising Medical Careers\", merging the PRHO year and the first year of SHO training into a \"foundation programme\" (FY1 and FY2). This programme was formally introduced in August 2005.\n\nIn August 2002, Professor Sir Liam Donaldson, the then Chief Medical Officer, published a report titled \"Unfinished Business\", which focused on reforming SHO training. The SHO grade was abolished and renamed \"specialty registrar\". This change took place in 2007. Amongst the many changes, many doctors who had completed their Foundation Training were now appointed into a \"run-through\" training programme that incorporated the previous SHO and specialist registrar grades. The job title changed from \"SHO\" to \"ST1/ST2\" (specialist trainee year 1 & year 2). Part of this decision was subsequently reversed in a number of specialties, with competitive entry into the registrar grade (\"uncoupled training\"), and in these specialties the SHO level posts are referred to as \"CT1/CT2\" (core trainee year 1 & year 2) and in some \"CT3\".\n\nSome hospitals use the term \"senior house officer\" in an unofficial capacity for doctors in FY2 and CT1/2 year, who often have similar working patterns in duty shift rotas.\n\nThe term still applies to non training posts, those organised by a hospital/trust as opposed to a Deanery, where a doctor is employed at a level after full registration with the GMC and before entering higher specialty training. These posts are typically referred to as \"Trust SHO\", \"Junior Clinical Fellow\" or other such terms.\n\nIn the United States, physicians in training are also sometimes referred to as \"senior house officers\" in their later years of residency, but the term is more variable in its American than its European usage.\n\nSpecializing post-graduate clinical students are still referred to as Senior House Officers in many other countries around the world, most of which were British colonies and adopted the British education system like Uganda.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2251180", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2251180", "title": "Galtür", "text": "Galtür\n\nGaltür is a village and ski resort in the upper Paznaun valley in Austrian state of Tyrol located in the Central Eastern Alps 35 km southwest of Landeck near the border of Vorarlberg and Switzerland.\n\nGaltür was settled by the Engadinern from the south, the Walsern and Vorarlbergern from the west, and Tyroleans from the east. Today the cultivation work of the Engadiner is remembered in the name Galtür, meaning \"Cultura\". During the Thirty Years' War, Galtür was badly damaged. The church and many houses were burned down. The first roads leading through the Paznaun were built in the 19th century. During that period, Galtür consisted of a church, an inn, and eight houses, and was considered very poor. After the first hotel was built, the Jamtalhütte was soon constructed. With the advent of tourism, Galtür and the valley became prosperous.\n\nOn February 23, 1999, an avalanche descended on Galtür. In less than 60 seconds, the 164-foot-high wall of snow traveled at 290 kilometers per hour, and overturned cars, destroyed buildings, and buried 57 people—of these, 31 died before rescue teams could reach them. The avalanche was considered the worst in the Alps in 40 years. Due to the continuing danger of avalanches, thousands of tourists were evacuated from the Paznaun valley via air-lift. Military and civil helicopters from Austria, Germany, Switzerland, France, and the United States were engaged in one of the biggest rescue operations of Austria's recent history. The avalanche was caused by three major weather systems from the Atlantic that produced large snowfalls totaling around 4 meters in the area. Alternating freezing and thawing created a weak layer on top of an existing snow pack, followed by additional snowfall. High winds created large snow drifts, and eventually caused roughly 170,000 tons of snow to fall on the village.\n\nGaltür is a popular tourist destination in winter. There are 40 km (25 mi) of perfectly prepared pistes and a varied selection of slopes to explore. Galtür is a family-friendly ski area. Most ski slopes range from easy to medium difficulty. In addition, ski pros find challenging runs and many deep snow slopes without any tracks. There are 10 mountain railways and lifts, including the eight-seater Alpkogel gondola. Wednesday evenings, night skiing is possible on a floodlit piste.\n\nGaltür's ski resort is called Silvapark and is located 2 kilometres outside the main village in the small village of Wirl. Ski buses run along the main road through Galtür between the ski area and other destinations in the valley, including Ischgl, Kappl, and See. There are stops in Galtür at the Hotel Alpenrose, Dorfplatz, and Alpinarium, as well as one stop next to the Birkhahnbahn chair lift in Wirl. In Wirl, skiers and snowboarders can take either the Birkahahnbahn chair lift or the Alpkogelbahn Gondola up onto the mountain.\n\nSilvapark offers 40 km of groomed pistes served by 3 chair lifts, 1 gondola and 5 smaller tow lifts. Many of the runs are marked Blue and Red, making the resort accessible to families and beginners. In addition to these, the resort also offers a number of more difficult Red and Black runs, which means, coupled with the off piste possibilities, the resort caters for more advanced skiers and snowboarders too. Off piste opportunities through trees and between runs, particularly surrounding the Breitspitzbahn chair lift, are available, even for less experienced skiers. This area is much quieter and has better on-piste conditions.\n\nThere are several mountain huts and restaurants on the mountain which offer traditional Austrian cuisine and a friendly atmosphere. Most offer indoor and outdoor dining areas as well as smoking and non-smoking areas respectively. At the bottom of the Alpkogelbahn Gondola, there are a number of hotels which have ski in ski out facilities. These hotels offer accommodation and facilities for those who would rather not take a ski bus.\n\nThe village consists mostly of large Austrian-style chalet buildings. Many of these offer bed and breakfast or self-catering accommodations, as well as hotel accommodations on a half board or full board basis. In the centre of the village there is a bakery, a few ski rental shops, a church, and a butcher shop. The Pyramide night club is renowned for its amiable DJ's who will play anything requested of them. There is also a supermarket located 0.5 km outside the village square in the direction of Ischgl, opposite the Hotel Alpenrose. This can be reached easily by bus. There is also a sports centre in the village which has an indoor swimming pool, indoor tennis court, and offers opportunities to play other sports such as darts, pool (billiards), and squash.\n\n"}

He planned (but did not complete) a series of county maps and accompanying county histories of England, the \"Speculum Britanniae\". He was also a prolific writer of devotional works.\n\nNorden is known to have been born in Somerset, to a \"genteel\" family, but his family background is otherwise obscure. He entered Hart Hall, Oxford, in 1564; and graduated BA in 1568 and MA in 1573. He subsequently led a peripatetic existence, but for much of his life had his home in Middlesex on the outskirts of London: he was living in Walham Green, Middlesex, in 1592; by 1607 he was at Hendon, Middlesex, where he remained until 1619; and in the latter year he moved to the parish of St Giles in the Fields, where he eventually died in 1625. He was married and had at least two sons, John Norden junior, and Josias.\n\nThe first instalment of Norden's chorographical project was published in 1593 as the \"Speculum Britanniae: the First Parte: an Historicall, & Chorographicall Discription of Middlesex\". The manuscript in the British Library (Harleian MS 570) has corrections in Lord Burleigh's handwriting.\n\nIn 1595 he wrote a manuscript \"Chorographical Description\" of Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Sussex, Hampshire, Wight, Guernsey and Jersey, dedicated, and perhaps presented, to Queen Elizabeth (now British Library Add. MS 21853). In 1596 he published his \"Preparative to the Speculum Britanniae\", dedicated to Burleigh. In 1598 there appeared the only other part of the project to reach print in his lifetime, \"Speculi Britaniae Pars: the Description of Hartfordshire\".\n\nHe also completed accounts of five other counties in manuscript. Three of these were printed many years after his death: Essex, edited for the Camden Society in 1840 by Sir Henry Ellis from a manuscript at Hatfield House; Northamptonshire, known to have been finished in 1610, but not published until 1720; and Cornwall, likewise finished in 1610, but published in 1728. The other two counties were Kent and Surrey: even the manuscripts for these are now lost, although the Surrey text would presumably have overlapped with that in the \"Chorographical Description\" of 1595.\n\nIn 1600 Norden was appointed surveyor of the crown woods and forests in Berkshire, Devon, and Surrey; in 1605 he obtained the surveyorship of the Duchy of Cornwall; and in 1607, after a careful survey, he composed his valuable \"Description of the Honor of Windsor\", with fine maps and plans in colour, dedicated to James I. In 1608 he was mainly occupied with the surveying of crown woods, especially in Surrey, Berkshire and Devon, and with the writing of his works on forest culture \"Considerations touching... raising... of Coppices\", and \"Relation of... Proceedings upon... Commission concerning new forests\", to which he added in 1613 his Observations concerning Crown Lands and Woods.\n\nIn 1612 he was made surveyor of the royal castles in Kent, Surrey, Sussex, Hampshire, Berkshire, Dorset, Wiltshire, Somerset, Devon and Cornwall; in 1616 and 1617 he appears surveying the soke of Kirketon in Lindsey, as well as various manors and lands belonging to Prince Charles, afterwards Charles I. His last works were a survey of Sheriff Hutton manor, Yorks, in 1624, and \"England, an intended guide for English travellers\", a series of tables to accompany Speed's county maps, executed in 1625, shortly before his death.\n\nNorden's maps of London and Westminster (in his \"Speculum Britanniae\" of 1593) are the best representations known of the English metropolis under the Tudors; his maps of Middlesex (also from the \"Speculum Britanniae\" of 1593), of Essex (1594), of Hertfordshire (1598) and of Cornwall (published in 1728; see above) are also notable. In the last of these the roads are indicated for the first time in English cartography.\n\nNorden also executed maps of Hampshire, Hertfordshire, Kent, Middlesex, Surrey and Sussex, for the fifth edition (1607) of Camden's \"Britannia\"; and maps of Middlesex, Essex, Sussex, Surrey and Cornwall for John Speed (1610).\n\nSeveral important cartographical works are lost. These include Norden's \"Map ... of Battles fought in England from ... William the Conqueror to Elizabeth\", in 16 sheets, formerly in the Bodleian Gallery, Oxford, of which elements are probably preserved in the \"Invasions of England\", an appendix to Speed's \"Prospect of the most Famous Parts of the World\" (1635); and his \"View of London\", in 8 sheets, made –6, and \"View of London Bridge\", published in 1624. An earlier \"View of London\" by Norden (1600), and an 1804 reprint of the \"View of London Bridge\", are held in the Crace collection at the British Library. A map of Surrey by Norden, said to have been copied by Speed and Kip in Camden's \"Britannia\" of 1607, has also disappeared.\n\nNorden frequently experienced difficulty in finding patronage for his cartographical and chorographical work. A steadier source of income was his devotional writing, of which he published twenty-four volumes between 1582 and his death. \"A Pensive Mans Practise\", first published in 1584, reached more than forty editions in his lifetime.\n\nHe always kept the two areas of his professional life quite separate, and when in the late 1590s a series of dedications in his devotional works to the Earl of Essex placed him in political difficulties with Sir Robert Cecil he attempted to deny authorship, claiming that the devotional books were the work of \"another of my name ... [a] Norden pretender\". This denial has caused historians some difficulty, but Frank Kitchen has established beyond doubt that there was only one John Norden.\n\n\n"}

The game was published by 2 subsidiaries of Vivendi Universal Games - NDA Productions in Europe and Sierra Entertainment in the United States.\n\nTaking place after the first three \"Die Hard\" films, players take on terrorists as John McClane. Reginald VelJohnson reprises his role as Sgt. Al Powell. McClane's daughter, Lucy, is an L.A.P.D. member in the game.\n\n\"Vendetta\" separates itself from other first person shooter games with its puzzle like elements. This includes hostage situations which have multiple outcomes, environmental puzzles and NPC interactions. John McClane can communicate to various NPCs in order to gain advice on how to overcome numerous situations in the game.\n\nMcClane can also take enemies hostage which cause other enemy AI to react differently depending on the rank of the hostage. Headshots in the game are rewarded by showing a panoramic camera sequence that uses a 'bullet time' effect (similar to an effect in Max Payne where the last dispatched enemy would have an almost-alike panoramic camera).\n\nFive years after the events of \"Die Hard With a Vengeance\", John McClane returns to the LAPD task force after an extended absence. After refreshing his skills in a training exercise, McClane goes home to watch the unveiling of a painting that was recovered from an expedition in South America by Piet Gruber (the son of Hans Gruber, the main villain from the first \"Die Hard\" film). As the unveiling begins, Lucy (McClane's daughter, now a police officer) witnesses robbers attempting to leave with artwork and gunfire erupts, panicking the crowd. McClane rushes to the Townsend Museum to rescue his daughter. Once there, McClane is notified that the robbers have sealed themselves in and taken hostages, including Lucy. McClane enters the museum and begins his search for the hostages, taking out several criminals in the process. After saving Dick Thornberg and Christopher von Laden (the museum's curator), McClane rescues Lucy. \n\nMcClane takes a stroll on Hollywood Boulevard when the chief notifies him of two murders at a diner not far from the former's location. McClane (disguised as a criminal) neutralizes Sergio, the perpetrator of the murders, and takes the latter's membership card, gaining access to the club where Sergio's crew is having a meeting. Quickly dispatching Sergio's men, McClane learns that the stolen artwork is hidden in a Chinese movie theater, and makes his way there. Saving the hostages, McClane dwells into the subways to retrieve the missing artwork. He overhears a conversation between von Lanen (who is secretly in league with Piet) and Jack Frontier, a former U.S. Army soldier and CIA operative turned actor turned criminal for hire. von Laden expresses his concerns about the plan, but Frontier pushes it off and orders him to go into hiding. Retrieving fragments of the artwork, McClane manages to find a distraught von Laden, telling him that Frontier wants the curator dead. The two escape into the city's aqueduct, where Lucy meets up with them and takes von Laden into custody.\n\nMcClane returns to the LAPD headquarters, where Piet's men have taken over the entire compound. McClane rescues Thornburg, who happens to try to get an exclusive interview with von Laden. Thornburg informs McClane there are two booby trapped bombs planted in the main entrance doors, and should anyone from the outside attempts a rescue, the headquarters will explode. McClane finds Lucy and an injured von Laden, where the latter tells McClane that Piet and Frontier has plans for him and all of Los Angeles. McClane recruits inmates Herbert Dowd and Nitric to hack into the police's communications system and disarm the explosives at the main entrance. Once the explosives are disarmed, Nitric betrays McClane and escapes. McClane, while in the hot pursuit for Nitric, obtains a suitcase that contains evidence of the art robbery. He confronts Piet, who is holding Captain Al Powell, von Laden, and Thornburg hostage. Lucy appears to aid her father, but is taken hostage by Piet's newest henchman Nitric. Piet kills von Laden, and makes his getaway with Frontier and Nitric in the helicopter.\n\nMcClane and the LAPD track the helicopter down to a movie studio in Hollywood. After providing cover for the SWAT team using a sniper, he regroups with them and they recover some of the paintings. McClane ignores their advice to go home and stays to find Lucy. Arriving at a Western-themed set in the studio, McClane and Nitric engage in a shootout, where the former comes out victorious. Al comes and arrests McClane for his unintentional assault on Jessie Montana, a renowned actress whose trailer McClane vandalized while trying to find Lucy.\n\nAt the Sierra Correctional Facility, Piet's men stage a jailbreak, and Nitric leaves his cell. Sergio kidnaps the prison warden, opening all the cell doors in the process. McClane leave his cell and arms himself as he attempts to find Nitric and the prison warden. The prison breakout intensifies, and McClane rescues the prison warden, revealing that Nitric is on the roof waiting for a helicopter. McClane finds Nitric and shoots down the latter. Nitric refuses to tell where Lucy at as he dies. Al arrives, and, impressed by McClane's heroics, tells him he can go home.\n\nFollowing a cryptic tip Nitric gave him before his death, McClane heads to a fish factory near the harbor to find Lucy. Instead, he finds Piet exchanging the paintings for a prototype RDXS Ample with Sumi Kazawa. Marlin, a long time associate of Piet, reveals herself, and they take the rocket to a warehouse in the harbor, with McClane giving follow. Being helped out by two factory workers, he sneaks inside a truck to follow the whereabouts of the rocket and Lucy. As this was going on, Thornburg announces Piet will destroy the Los Angeles International Airport with the experimental missile if the city of Los Angeles does not give him $1 billion by the end of the night.\n\nMcClane finds himself outside the city in a warehouse where the missile is prepared to be launched, giving him the mission to destroy ten fuel tanks so the missile launch could be averted. Once successful, McClane finds the disabled rocket, only to be confronted by Frontier. Frontier reveals his plan to betray Piet, whileas he orders Marlin to kill McClane as he leaves to collect the ransom money. After a lengthy gunfight, McClane overcomes Marlin. As she dies, Marlin tells McClane that Piet is taking Lucy to Nakatomi Plaza, the same place where McClane killed Piet's father many years ago.\n\nThe LAPD forms a blockade around the plaza just as Al receives a call from McClane. At the same time, Frontier informs him of McClane disabling the rocket. McClane arrives to end the threat once and for all. On the 22nd floor, Piet sets up a trap for McClane, who barely escapes. McClane warns Al to hold off the backup while he goes to the top to rescue Lucy. Fighting his way through Piet's men, McClane finds Lucy at the top floor of the plaza, where she is wearing a vest of explosives triggered to explode if she moves. McClane finds the detonator codes and defuses the explosives, saving his daughter. Lucy takes her father to the roof where Piet and Frontier are waiting for a helicopter to escape. McClane catches up to the two on the helipad, and as Piet is about to shoot McClane dead, Frontier shoots Piet from behind, fulfilling his promise to betray his boss. Lucy comes and guns down Piet. Frontier leaves, but not before McClane grabs the bottom wheel of the helicopter.\n\nArriving at the Holmes Observatory for the premiere of \"Galaxy Thief III\", McClane deduces Frontier's plot to kill the entire cast of the movie as revenge for his fall from grace. Learning from a wounded security officer that there are five bombs hidden in suitcases rigged to destroy the observatory, McClane rushes inside to save the hostages and disarm the bombs. Once successful, McClane and Frontier engage in a final confrontation. McClane defeats Frontier, and Frontier activates a bomb hidden in his gear. McClane escapes in the nick of time as the observatory explodes, killing Frontier in the process.\n\nMcClane reunites with Lucy and Al. Robert Barnes, a film developer, offers McClane a starring role in a movie based on the recent events, but McClane punches him and walks off with his daughter, ending the game.\n\nThe GameCube version received \"mixed\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Fran Mirabella III of IGN said of the same console version, \"From the hostage-taking dynamics to the controls, the experience just feels unpolished. It can be fun, but there are a lot of frustrations that come along with it to sour the experience a little.\"\n"}

Approximately long and wide, the fertile but flood-prone land of the island is extensively farmed. The island was formed in 1878 after a massive flood changed the course of the Clutha, which had formerly reached the ocean 4 km to the south at Port Molyneux.\n\nThe island takes its name from Scots Gaelic, \"innis\" meaning \"island\" and \"Cluaidh\" being the Gaelic form of the name of Scotland's River Clyde.\n\nThe island is sparsely inhabited, consisting of a handful of farm houses distributed fairly evenly across the island. Only two bridges link the island to the South Island proper, both of them connecting with the Kaitangata Highway (former SH 91), one at the northern end of the island close to Stirling, and the other about one kilometre from Kaitangata. The southwestern shore of the island, along the Koau branch, includes several small oxbow lakes – in the north, close to Finegand, and also some 3km from the Pacific coast. The northern shore contains no current oxbows, though the Matau branch travels through several large meanders (especially close to Kaitangata) which are likely to eventually become oxbows. In the largest of these, a 3500 m loop of river bends back on itself to create a neck of farmland only some 120 metres wide. At the southern end of the island, a channel links the two branches, separating Inch Clutha from a smaller broad, low-lying barrier islet sitting between it and the Pacific coast. The northern tip of Inch Clutha sits directly across the Clutha River from Balclutha Aerodrome, on the southern edge of the town. The first settlers moved there in 1848 forming a small community. \n\n"}

Set on a former British man-of-war transporting migrants to Australia in the early 19th century, the novels explore themes of class (assumed status) and man's reversion to savagery when isolated, in this case, the closed society of the ship's passengers and crew. \n\nThe first of the books, \"Rites of Passage,\" was awarded the Man Booker Prize in 1980. The trilogy as a whole was adapted by the late Leigh Jackson and Tony Basgallop for a 2005 BBC drama mini-series of the same name, directed by David Attwood and starring Benedict Cumberbatch. It aired in the United States in PBS' 2006 season of \"Masterpiece Theatre\". It became available in 2016 on Netflix and Hulu streaming.\n\n\"Rites of Passage\" (1980) is an account of a six-month voyage to Australia in the early 19th century by an assorted group of British migrants on a converted man-of-war. It is in the form of a journal written by Edmund Talbot, a young aristocrat. His influential godfather has arranged for him to be employed with the Governor of New South Wales, and presents Talbot with a journal to record the significant events of the journey. He considers it a time of reflection for the young man. Talbot begins by describing the passengers of all classes (getting a tour of the ship) and crew members, who encompass a motley yet representative collection of early 19th-century English society. He becomes concerned with the downfall of passenger Reverend Colley. \n\nTalbot has a somewhat ambiguous role in Colley's fall; although he quickly assumes a mediator's role between the Reverend and Captain Anderson, initially he had presumed on his status by going on the quarterdeck without the captain's express invitation, about which the latter man was protective. Colley dies after getting drunk and possibly being sexually assaulted by the ship's crew and officers. When one of the crew suggests officers were involved, the captain ends his investigation of Colley's death, as \"buggery\" (homosexual intercourse) is punishable by hanging. Talbot comes across Colley's journal, and feels guilty for seeing how eager Colley was to know him better. Colley is given a formal burial at sea. As the novel closes, Talbot is ambivalent about presenting his own journal to his godfather, as he fears it may not show him in the best light. He concludes that he does not have a choice, and eventually he seals the journal, in order to protect what he has written.\n\n\"Rites of Passage\" won the 1980 Booker Prize.\n\nGolding begins \"Close Quarters\" (1987) from Talbot's point of view and soon after he completed his first journal on the 6-month voyage to Australia. Talbot starts a new journal in a different tone, as this volume will not be presented to his godfather. He describes his romantic feelings for a young woman whom he meets on a different ship they encounter, HMS \"Alcyone.\" Feeling ill, he expresses his fears about the seaworthiness of his own ship and its ability to complete the journey. The book has a more traditional structure, with chapter breaks at dramatic moments (rather than the day-by-day account presented in \"Rites\").\n\n\"Fire Down Below\" (1989) closed the trilogy with a description of the ever-more perilous voyage (given the old ship and old charts); of Talbot's maturing and his growing admiration for the Prettimans; of the rivalry between the two principal officers, Summers and Benét, for Captain Anderson's respect and trust; and of the conclusion to Edmund's \"affaire de coeur\" with Miss Chumley. Much detail is given to the increasingly frantic measures to repair the ship and reach Australia.\n\n\"Rites of Passage\" is characterized by the theme of class division, in particular, the assumption of a higher status by individuals than is warranted. The leitmotiv of proper gentlemanly conduct is explored in the often stormy friendship of Talbot with Lieutenant Summers, who presses him to live up to his responsibilities as an aristocrat after he has taken advantage of its privilege. Summers sometimes feels slighted by Talbot's ill-considered comments and advice. \"Rites\" explores the cruelties of men in groups, and the tensions as they struggle over status and place in their artificial society on the ship.\n\nIn 2005 the books were adapted as a BBC drama serial starring Benedict Cumberbatch. Named \"To The Ends of the Earth,\" the series was directed by David Attwood. \n"}

The company began as a dozen businesses started by brothers Judge Solomon Wayne and Joshua Wayne. With the revenue generated Judge Wayne essentially built Gotham City by hiring Cyrus Pinkney.\n\nJudge Wayne's son and heir, Alan Wayne, officially made it a corporate company in the 19th century. Alan Wayne, who was Bruce Wayne's great-great-grandfather, erected Wayne Shipping, Wayne Chemical, and Wayne Manufacturing. All these companies were energized by the world's Industrial Revolution; more branches were created and diversified while others dwindled and subsequently discarded.

Also called \"Old Wayne Tower\" and \"Wayne Industries Headquarters\"; it was built in 1888 by Alan Wayne. After its construction, the tower was the tallest building in Gotham City. Built as a symbol to welcome all of those who enter the city, Wayne Tower has 13 gargoyles or \"guardians\", which Alan Wayne insisted they be called, welcome visitors for each of the 13 entry points into the city. The five guardians on the first tier watch the original five gateways into Gotham, the three bridges and two tunnels. Higher up, the seven guardians watch the seven train lines that converge at Union Station below the tower's base. A 13th guardian was added in 1930 and sits in the middle of the tower.

It has double bonded laminated float glass for windows that are crystal-quality, weatherproof, and unbreakable.\n\nThe Wayne Foundation is the holding company for the Thomas Wayne Foundation and the Martha Wayne Foundation; it is the largest transparently operated private foundation within the DC Universe. The primary aims of the foundation are, globally, is arts and humanities: to enhance healthcare and reduce extreme poverty, to expand educational opportunities and access to information technology, and to fund scientific research and help altruistic people with research by providing facilities and training. The scale of the foundation and the way it seeks to apply business techniques to giving makes it one of the leaders in venture philanthropy, though the foundation itself notes that the philanthropic role has limitations.\n\nThe foundation has its own building, called the Wayne Foundation Building, which includes a penthouse where Bruce Wayne lived for a period of time. It also has a secret elevator that leads to a matching Batcave in a secret sub-basement under the building.\n\nThrough the Wayne Foundation and the affiliated organizations underneath, Bruce Wayne addresses social-economic problems encouraging crime, assists victims of crimes, and maintains connections to the streets through the soup kitchens and social services groups; all of which augments his crime fighting efforts in a way that his Batman persona cannot. This arrangement also provides a large network of connections in the world of charities. He finds out about the newest trends, sciences and the arts.\n\nThe Thomas Wayne Foundation is a foundation for medicine and medical help. This foundation gives annual awards for medical breakthroughs and lifelong commitment, similar to the Nobel Foundation. The Thomas Wayne Foundation is also responsible for funding the Thomas Wayne Memorial Clinic in Park Row, Gotham's infamous Crime Alley. The foundation funds and runs dozens of clinics in Gotham. Bruce Wayne's surrogate mother, Dr. Leslie Thompkins, runs the Memorial Clinic in Crime Alley and governed the other clinics until she left Gotham.\n\nThe Martha Wayne Foundation is a patron and supporter of arts, families, education, and tolerance. The foundation supports and helps to run a number of orphanages and free schools, and provides teachers for those who have learning difficulties. Artists can apply for grants from the foundation to help support them in furthering the arts. The foundation sponsors companies like Family Finders. Family Finders is an organization directed at finding lost people and uniting families. The Martha Wayne Foundation also sponsors and runs dozens of soup kitchens within the city.\n\nUnder the Wayne Foundation building, there is a secret bunker, which is similar to the secret bunker of New Babylon in The Hague. As of \"Batman\" #687, Dick Grayson has taken to using this as his \"Batcave,\" stating that he wishes to embody the role of Batman in a way that is specific to him as well as getting closer to the action in the city. The bunker is as well-equipped as the original Batcave, including the Subway Rocket vehicle (which is Grayson's favorite means of transport during the \"Prodigal\" storyline ) stationed beneath the bunker.\n\nAlthough the company is primarily known as a military defense contractor, Wayne Enterprises also includes dozens of umbrella companies involved in all sectors of the economy both in Gotham City and around the world.\n\nMany of the following divisions of the company include:\n\n\nIn \"Batman Incorporated\", Bruce Wayne announces that he will officially fund the efforts of various crimefighters through the formation of a subsidiary called Batman, Incorporated.\n\nWayne Security specializes in customized homes and business security—from armoured vehicles to enterprise security software—with emphasis providing affordable access to insurances, private security, identity theft protection, medical emergency services, monitoring systems, and personal safety products for ordinary people.\n\nWayne Research Institute is a RAND-like think tank for Nobel Prize people looking ahead to solve the next generation of problems confronting humankind. Many decisions on future development, particularly in Gotham, goes through this division. The research and development division is used by Batman to study issues and technologies that he thinks might be helpful in his endeavors.\n\nWayne Aerospace is a subsidiary of Wayne Technologies and remains one of the more highly successful divisions of Wayne Enterprises. It has its own airline called Wayne Airlines and an aviation division called Wayne Aviation. The aerospace division is a major military defense contractor within Gotham and the United States. W.A. currently owns 20% of Lockheed Martin's weapons division. The W.A. is mostly known for its extremely well structured, luxurious and exclusive corporate and private jets and airliners. Much like the Gulfstream, Wayne Enterprises tries to keep the Slipstream corporate jets out of the hands of celebrities and sells them mostly to large corporations. This in turn has made the Slipstream into a cult item among the rich because it is fashionable to have a plane as a status symbol of wealth. Wayne Aerospace's experimental aviation branch produces experimental and research aircraft for NASA. The military aviation branch designs and manufactures highly successful jet fighters and helicopters for the United States Air Forces. The most notable models of these are the W-4 Wraith fighter and the Kestrel attack helicopter. As the most prominent aerospace company in the region, Wayne Aerospace has a working partnership with Eagle Air Force Base near Gotham City. Wayne Aerospace is also responsible for maintaining the systems and the planes for the Archie Goodwin International Airport in Little Stockton, in Gotham. Wayne Aerospace maintains good natured competition with other aerospace corporations like Ferris Air and its nemesis, LexAir.\n\nThe division has generated millions of dollars for Wayne Enterprises. The company's government contracts and space exploration contracts with NASA have been very lucrative. Wayne Aerospace's most important mission is to provide the latest technology and information for the Batman.\n\nWayne Technologies is the biggest division within Wayne Enterprises—referred to as \"the applied sciences division\" in \"The Dark Knight trilogy\". As more and more innovations were made and new things were discovered, the division has played an important role in the technology scene around Gotham and providing the latest and cutting edge devices for Batman. As alien invasions and involvement have become more sporadic around Gotham, WayneTech acquired alien technology and used it for research & development. With this breakthrough acquisition, Wayne Enterprise was able to rival technologies produced by its nemesis, LexCorp. Some of Wayne Technologies' research into alien technology has contributed to large breakthroughs in medicine, cybernetics, pharmaceuticals and avionics. Subsidiaries of WayneTech include: Holt Holdings Inc. (the company formerly owned by the current Mister Terrific), Wayne Biotech, Wayne Pharmaceuticals, and Wayne Healthcare. WayneTech is a great resource for Batman. Not only does it provide contacts for him into the high technology world, the division can also be used to analyze whatever gadget he might find faster than he would be able to do alone. WayneTech also provides a source of business income for Wayne Enterprises as the company owns dozens of patents, including all of Holt's systems except the T-Spheres, as licensing these patents can be extremely lucrative for the company. With the strength of this division, Batman has access to any kind of medical facility or procedure, from normal to special or experimental applications, information and medical analysis. Through the company he also has access to medical files on everyone in Gotham. Since WayneTech is the market leader in cybernetic applications, he has extremely high level government contracts and contacts.\n\nWayne Foods is a well known subsidiary of Wayne Enterprises with its headquarters in downtown Gotham City. The firm was started in 1872 by an Irish immigrant, Patrick Toole, under the name, Toole & Sons Food Merchants. It runs a number of farms and cattle ranches in the Breadbasket regions of the United States, and business was successful in importing Irish products that could be sold at a higher cost in the US economy. By 1905, there were five Toole & Sons stores throughout Gotham City. Patrick Toole died at the age of 72 in 1919, leaving the business to his eldest son, Thomas Toole. Thomas was keen to expand across the US; however, the outbreak of war in Europe in 1914 severely impacted trade lines from Ireland to Gotham. At the end of the war in 1918, Toole & Sons Food Merchants was near bankruptcy. Thomas, unable to carry on his father’s legacy, committed suicide in 1922 at age 43. The second youngest Toole brother, Rory, took over the business and immediately set about selling all company assets in favor of entering liquidation.\n\nThe business was bought in 1925 by the Wayne family, who were keen to preserve an important part of Gotham’s retail history. It is one of the most financially successful divisions at Wayne Enterprises and oldest branches. The business returned to profit in less than a year, and by the end of the second World War, Toole & Sons stores controlled over 60% of all food retail across the city. This was achieved by diversifying the product range and opening up stock to new markets outside Ireland and within the US. The company changed its name to Wayne Foods in 1956. Today, Wayne Foods focuses on the high end market and specialty goods. Although it no longer has the dominance across Gotham as it did from the late 1950s to the mid-1980s, Wayne Foods continues to generate significant revenue for Wayne Enterprises. Wayne Foods produces specialized products like ecological foods, natural lines with no additives and controlled growing. Wayne Foods remains a source of information and contacts for Batman, helping to keep tabs on the food product market and threats pertaining to the safety of the food supply around Gotham City.\n\nWayne Shipping owns dozens of freighters and handles three-and-a-half billion tons of freight each month. It is used by Batman to gain an inside view on smuggling and drug trafficking. In 1986, Wayne Shipping merged with PAAL Ship Corporation, creating the world's largest commercial shipping operation for precious metals. The former PAAL CEO, Andreas Milanic, successfully floated Wayne Shipping on the New York Stock Exchange in 1988. The Wayne Family currently owns 57% of the company, with Milanic's second son, Dragoslav, owning 20% (and the remaining 23% is in public ownership). Despite a lack of investment in Wayne Shipping since the merger took place, the company still remains an important player in world ocean transportation.\n\nWayne Yards is responsible for the building of many naval warships, commercial and private ships, and is building a \"Ford-class aircraft carrier in Gotham. Wayne Steel and Wayne Yards facilities repair many cruisers and destroyers, and also have contacts within the upper echelons of the Navy and the global maritime business.\n\nWayne Industries is a research and development company used for industrial purposes. The company studies, researches, and develops cleaner, mechanical fission and fusion power plants; and also owns many factories and normal labor units. The company is heavily involved in the industrial circuit, developing industrial machinery such as, manufacturing heavy engines, motors, pneumatic systems and large-scale systems. Additionally, Wayne Industries is also involved in automobile manufacturing (Wayne Automotive) and cloth making. Wayne Mining is also a part of Wayne Industries, along with the few power stations (Wayne Electric) the company owns. Wayne Mining mostly mines and produces gold and some precious stones in Africa.\n\nThis division of Wayne Enterprises remains a facility for the research and development of more innovative medical procedures and system. The company educates, trains and teaches a huge number of people annually. It maintains a good working relationship with the Gotham University and Drake Medical.\n\nWayne Chemicals and Wayne Pharmaceuticals work closely with Wayne Biotech to develop new medical vaccines and medicines for the treatment of different diseases. Much of the present research at Wayne Biotech is focused on finding the cure for cancer. Since the human genome has already been unlocked, Wayne Biotech is studying cloning to produce feasible human organs for future transplants. The division is also involved in research into neurosurgery methods, the fight against AIDS and HIV, and reconstructive plastic surgery. Batman uses Wayne Biotech as a research tool for finding medical information, patient histories, information on illnesses, and thus clues for his crime prevention activities.\n\nWayne Medical is Wayne Biotech’s sister company, but each has different fields of study and work. Wayne Medical handles most of the healthcare system in Gotham and also studies cancer and AIDS with Wayne Biotech. Wayne Medical is focused more on treating illnesses than researching them. It maintains and runs many hospitals in Gotham City and helps the Wayne Foundation with the orphanages.\n\nWayne Electronics is a large consortium that has recently become a major player in the home and personal computing market. Its products rival LexCorp's in terms of speed, durability and ease of use. Wayne Electronics is a large consortium that manufactures almost anything from portable radios to stereo and Hi-Fi systems, movie cameras, cameras and electronics, measuring devices, scanners, surveillance equipment, computers and other electronics devices. Wayne Electronics is one of the top selling brand names in electronics, from multimedia to precision systems. Its other branches of business include information technology, wired networks, wireless networks and space exploration systems and satellites.\n\nBatman utilizes contacts through Wayne Electronics in the media and entertainment industry, even if in lesser degree than through Wayne Entertainment. Wayne Electronics' contracts with the aerospace, nautical and military industries provide contacts as well.\n\nWayne Entertainment owns many arenas and stadiums in Gotham and has leased out the Sommerset Stadium to the Metropolis Monarchs and operates its own record label, Wayne Records. This division of Wayne Enterprises continuously innovates new areas in entertainment to create a niche for itself in the entertainment industry around Gotham. Furthermore, Wayne Entertainment has working partnerships with several modeling agencies and multimedia houses, and provides many contacts and information. The \"Daily Planet\" newspaper, where Clark Kent and his wife, Lois Lane, work, is operated by Wayne Entertainment. Wayne Entertainment is in direct competition with WGBS (run by Galaxy Communications) and LexCom (run by LexCorp). Those companies, along with other television and movie companies, provide the same services as Wayne Entertainment. Through Wayne Entertainment, Batman has contacts in the media and entertainment industries.\n\nWayne Construction is the property, construction and civil engineering division of Wayne Enterprises. The division has played a prominent role with the construction of a free railway system around Gotham City, wiping out government corruption in the process. It is also responsible for building and maintaining several resort style hotels scattered all over the world. In addition, Bruce Wayne himself amassed a private fortune of his own as a successful real estate developer before Gotham became a booming metropolis.\n\nWayne Chemicals is a part of technology unit at Wayne Enterprises. It controls the branches such as Wayne Oil, Wayne Pharmaceuticals and Wayne Botanical. Wayne Oil acquired Luxor Oil, another oil company that has oil wells, drilling and refineries, providing fuel for Gotham as well as source of investment income for Batman. Wayne Chemicals also has a small percentage of ownership in Tyler Chemicals, based in New York City. Wayne Oil gives Batman a major connection to OPEC and other oil organizations and companies around the world. Wayne Chemicals exercises strong scientific and technological proficiency at developing new compounds and chemicals, but has shifted to research and development in the 1980s. With the oil fields, wells and refineries Wayne Oil purchased with Luxor Oil, it has also started to do research in petrochemicals even more than before. At the same time, it has concentrated a huge effort towards alternative fuel sources. Wayne Chemicals is the first company to have created a power generator using algae. Wayne Pharmaceuticals is another large R&D unit at Wayne Chemicals, providing income, scientific breakthroughs, direct links in the scientific community as well as giving Batman a technological edge over his adversaries.\n\nWayne Steel is the steel manufacturing division at Wayne Enterprises. The Steel plan are among the oldest steel mills and one of the oldest shipyards in Gotham City and have nearly as much fame as the Newport News Shipyards. The Wayne Steel shipyards date back to the founding of the Tricorner naval yards. As the government's own naval shipyards started to pull out from Gotham, Wayne Steel moved in and acquired them for Wayne Yards. The division of the company has always maintained a great working relationship with Gotham-based shipyards. Due to the high quality of their steel, Wayne Steel have also supplied shipyards outside of Gotham with their steel needs. Recent globe-spanning events have left the US navy depleted of ships and the U.S. government since been its most prominent customer for the division, as Wayne Steel has run into a boom and at times can't supply enough steel to the industry. Because of this, Wayne Steel has started to open more steel mills close to Gotham and also around the United States. This has a lead to a major windfall profits for the company. Metallurgical studies have become extremely crucial as alien technologies and new alloys have been studied and then replicated. A new side of the business that has only recently started to take off has positioned Wayne Steel it has had with the government from the 19th century, the division of the company has become a market leader in the study of alien alloys from recent economic and manufacturing crises. This division of Wayne Enterprises allows Batman to prioritize technology and alloys for him to study. Wayne Steel's alliance with the US Navy and the government has produced numerous contacts for Wayne Steel.\n\n\nWayne Enterprises appears on the CW's \"Arrowverse\". \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWayneCorp appears in the film \"Joker\" as Wayne Industries where three employees of the company attack Arthur Fleck/Joker at a Gotham City subway train until he kills all three of them. The company's CEO Thomas Wayne, his wife Martha Wayne and their son Bruce Wayne appear as well with the former being the mayor of Gotham City until he is killed alongside his spouse during a riot.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was the site of an Iraqi Air Force base.\nThe city of Safwan is attributed to its founder Safwan bin Assal Al Muradi Al Yamani, a companion of Prophet Muhammad who participated in the conquest of Iraq in the middle ages. He settled in Kufa, northeast of Najaf at first but then moved to Safwan, south of Basra along with his tribe who later named the city in his name.\n\nSafwan is part of the Az Zubayr district south of Basra and has a population of 70,000 people.\n\nMuhammad ordered a Military expedition in Safwan. The expedition was ordered by Muhammad after he received intelligence that Kurz ibn Jabir al-Fihri rustled some grazing cattle belonging to Muslims. It occurred directly after the Invasion of Waddan in the year 2 AH of the Islamic calendar. The expedition was ordered by Muhammad after he received intelligence that Kurz ibn Jabir al-Fihri rustled some grazing cattle belonging to Muslims. Therefore, Muhammad directed about 70 Muslims, who chased him to Safwan, at the outskirts of Badr. But Kurz ibn Jabir al-Fihri managed to escape.\n\nSafwan is located in the south of Iraq at Iraqi Kuwaiti border, along the infamous \"Highway of Death\" from the Persian Gulf War. The cease-fire negotiations between General Norman Schwarzkopf and the Iraqi delegation led by Lieutenant General Sultan Hashim Ahmad took place at Safwan airfield. Schwarzkopf's demand to hold the formal cease-fire negotiations in Iraqi territory led to the encounter between the 1st squadron, 4th Cavalry regiment (Quarterhorse) from Ft. Riley, Ks. of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division (Mechanized) and the Iraqi Republican Guard, known in military circles as The Ultimatum. This was detailed in the book Third Graders At War, as well as the book Road to Safwan.\n\n"}

It was founded, according to Church tradition, by Saint Mark the Evangelist. The Council of Nicaea ranked it after Rome, while the Greek fathers of the Council of Chalcedon tried in canon 28 to demote it, giving it third place after Constantinople, although Pope Leo I of Rome rejected this canon. However, following the same Council, the patriarchate was claimed by two parties: a Greek Patriarch who adhered to the dogmatic definitions of Chalcedon and a Coptic Miaphysite Patriarch who rejected them. \n\nWhile part of the Byzantine Empire and under Islamic domination, the Chalcedonian patriarch always followed the Byzantine rite, while the non-Chalcedonian patriarch followed the Coptic rite. The Greek Patriarch of Alexandria remained in communion with the See of Rome despite the rupture of communion between Rome and Constantinople in 1054. In fact, the Bishop of Rome and Greek Bishop of Alexandria commemorated each other in their diptychs until the early 14th century. Thus, while in 1215, during the pontificate of Pope Innocent III, there were Latin Patriarchs, rivaling or replacing the Greek ones in the formerly Crusader held cities of Antioch, Constantinople, and Jerusalem, Greek Patriarch Mark III of Alexandria was invited and sent representatives to participate in the Fourth Lateran Council. \n\nRecords of a Latin Patriarch of Alexandria begin only in the 14th century. The position was merely titular since the bishop never occupied the See. His patriarchal cathedral in Rome was the papal Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls. Many incumbents would hold residential (arch)episcopal posts of various ranks in Catholic countries, and even (earlier and/or later) other Titular Latin patriarchates (Jerusalem, Constantinople). The titular see would have its share of disputed nominations during the papal schism in Avignon.\n\nSince 1724, the Melkite Catholic Patriarchate of Antioch and All the East holds the title of Patriarch of Alexandria. In 1895, the Coptic Catholic Patriarchate of Alexandria was established out of the Catholic Apostolic Vicariate of Alexandria. Thus, there remains a Patriarch of Alexandria for the Catholic Church. \n\nThe Titular Latin Patriarchate was left vacant in 1954 and then abolished in 1964.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2251248", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2251248", "title": "Manipravalam", "text": "Manipravalam\n\nManipravalam (IAST: \"Maṇipravāḷam\", മണിപ്രവാളം) is a macaronic language found in some manuscripts of South India. It is a hybrid language, typically written in the Grantha script, which combines Sanskrit lexicon and Tamil morpho-syntax. According to language scholars Giovanni Ciotti and Marco Franceschini, the blending of Tamil and Sanskrit is evidenced in manuscripts and their colophons over a long period of time, and this ultimately may have contributed to the emergence of Manipravalam.\n\n\"Mani-pravalam\" literally means \"ruby-coral\", and it likely played a role in the emergence of the Malayalam language and script from Tamil-Brahmi, Tamil and Sanskrit. The Kerala scholars distinguished Manipravalam from \"Pattu\", the former being significantly influenced by Sanskrit and later predominantly Tamil. Manipravalam has been used for poetry manuscripts that combine Malayalam and Sanskrit, as well as South Indian works on eroticism. The 14th-century \"Lilatilakakara\" text states Manipravalam to be a \"bhasya\" (language) where \"Malayalam and Sanskrit should combine together like ruby and coral, without the least trace of any discord\". \n\nDramatic performances given in Koothambalams, known by the names of Koothu and Koodiyattam, often used Sanskrit and Tamil. The language of \"Kramadeepikas\" and \"Attaprakarams\", which lay down the rules and regulations for these dramatic performances, is considerably influenced by the composite literary dialect of Manipravalam. Various hagiographies on the life of the Vaishnava saint Ramanuja were in manipravalam.\n\nIt is suggested that the advent of the Manipravalam style, where letters of the Grantha script coexisted with the traditional Vatteluttu letters, made it easier for people in Kerala to accept a Grantha-based script \"Ārya eḻuttŭ\", and paved the way for the introduction of the new writing system. Eventually \"Vaṭṭeḻuttŭ\" was almost completely supplanted by 'the modern Malayalam script.\n\n\n"}

He is best known as a member of the electronic music duo Way Out West, his record label and global live events brand, The Soundgarden, and for his albums released in the Global Underground series. He is also head of A&R for the record label Hope Recordings.\n\nIn 1988, Nick Warren began DJing in Bristol, playing mainly reggae and indie music until house music became more popular in the UK. By the early 1990s, Warren had become one of the more popular DJs in Bristol, performing regularly at the superclub Vision and DJing for Massive Attack.\n\nWhile working at a record store in 1994, Warren met producer Jody Wisternoff and the two decided to work together. Their first collaboration was on the track \"Paradise is the Sound\" which they released under the artist name \"Sub-Version 3\". Warren describes Wisternoff as being the more technical of the two, while Warren states that he \"bring[s] most of the sounds into our projects\" and an understanding of what music needs in order for it to be successful at dance clubs. Their next two releases were issued under the name \"Echo\", with \"Way Out West\" being the name of their remix project. The duo soon adopted the name for their act and signed a deal with Deconstruction Records.\n\nIn the mid 1990s, Warren began a residency at Liverpool dance club Cream. In 1997, Warren was given the opportunity to mix the second entry in the still young \"Global Underground\" series. The album, \"Global Underground 003: Prague\", is a live set of Warren's from Prague. Although labelled as 003, this was actually only the second release on the \"Global Underground\" label. This began a relationship with Global Underground which led to Warren creating seven additional mix albums for the series, including \"Global Underground 008: Brazil\", \"Global Underground 011: Budapest\", \"Global Underground 018: Amsterdam\", \"Global Underground 024: Reykjavík\", \"Global Underground 028: Shanghai\", \"Global Underground 030: Paris\", and \"Global Underground 035: Lima\". Warren stated that he feels comfortable working with Global Underground due to an underlying trust between himself and the label.\n\nIn December 2000, Way Out West was dropped by Deconstruction, which had since been bought by BMG, as the label felt that Way Out West's album would not do well commercially. Way Out West then signed a three-album contract with Distinct'ive Records, turning down offers from other labels such as Bedrock. Their first album on Distinct'ive was \"Intensify\", which featured the singles \"The Fall\", \"Intensify\", and \"Mindcircus\". \"The Fall\" used lyrics taken from the Cole Porter song \"Autumn Leaves\" and \"Mindcircus\" features vocals written by Imogen Heap. For the next Way Out West album, \"Don't Look Now\" (2004), Warren and Wisternoff brought in vocalist Omi and drummer Damon Reece. As of early 2007, Way Out West had begun work on new material. Warren made this possible because he is now head A&R of Hope Recordings, the label in which their last single \"Spaceman\" was released in 2008. In 2008, Global Underground released Warren's next compilation, \"Global Underground 035: Lima\". Before this album, Warren had sold over 110,000 compilations in the Global Underground series in the UK alone.\n\nWay Out West's fourth album, titled \"We Love Machine\", was released on 6 October 2009. The song \"Only Love\" featuring Jonathan Mendelsohn on vocals (the album marks their first collaboration with a male vocalist) was the first single from the album, released 31 August 2009. The deluxe edition of the album on Hope Recordings is available at their own website.\n\nIn 2010, Warren released a remix of Grafiti's song \"Spooky Trains\" and a remix of General Midi's song 'Absinth'. Also in 2010, Warren released on Bedrock Recordings, with the track \"In Search of Silver\" and he began his The Soundgarden show on Frisky Radio, a bi-monthly venture in which Nick played a wide range of different sets on this popular station. The show was discontinued in 2018.\n\n2011 marked Hope Recordings' 100th release, taken on by none other than Nick Warren himself. The track was titled 'Buenos Aires' – as Warren feels a special connection with the city, having played there on several occasions.\n\"I am in love with the city of Buenos Aires and have the most amazing time, each and every time I go there to play. I started writing this tune after playing there last year\". Hope Recordings' next release was by Tom Glass, titled 'Naive' for which Nick did his own 'Psychedelic Wheel' Remix.\nIn November 2011, Nick released another solo single, Rumbletump, on Hernan Cattaneo's Sudbeat label.\n\nOn 25 August 2012 Warren announced via his Facebook page that he would be compiling the next Renaissance Masters series album, set for a January 2013 release. He demonstrated his excitement for the release stating \"These are exciting times for electronic music with genres and styles more eclectic than ever before and with this album for the Masters series I hope to highlight some of the most breathtaking and diverse electronic music in 2012.\"\n\nIn 2015, Warren expanded his The Soundgarden radio shows into a global live events brand. After an initial season in Ibiza, the brand found particular initial success in the South American markets, with highlights including shows at Destino Arena, Mar Del Plata and Parque Riviera, Montevideo, Uruguay, as well as annual boat parties at Amsterdam Dance Event and Miami Music Week alongside Hernán Cattáneo's Sudbeat label.\n\nOff the back of its success in the live arena, The Soundgarden has subsequently expanded into a respected Progressive and Melodic House record label. A&R'd exclusively by Warren, the label has released numerous EPs and singles from artists including Modd, Luka Sambe, Black 8, Nicolas Rada, and Warren himself, as well as compilations and samplers for major electronic music events such as Miami Music Week and Amsterdam Dance Event. \n\nIn 2017, Warren and Jody Wisternoff released their fifth studio album as Way Out West, Tuesday Maybe, on Anjunadeep. In 2018, the duo subsequently released an EP of extended chill-out versions of tracks from Tuesday Maybe, entitled 'Sunday Maybe', on Anjunadeep. \n\nFor in-studio mixing, Nick Warren uses Ableton Live, ProTools, and some Logic Pro on a Macintosh.\n\n\n\n"}

He is a former mayor of Haifa (1993–2003) and Yeruham (2005–2010) and led the Labor Party from 2002 to 2003. In 2012 he joined Hatnuah.\n\nHe was born in Kibbutz Dovrat to Jewish refugees from Germany. He attended a military boarding school in Haifa, graduating from the Hebrew Reali School in 1963 and enlisting into the IDF the same year. He served in various positions in the IDF armored force, the Command and Staff College, and the Operations Division in the General Staff, receiving the Medal of Distinguished Service for his actions during the Six-Day War and the Yom Kippur War, both of which saw him wounded.\n\nIn 1977 he graduated from the University of Haifa with a degree in geography, before studying at the U.S. Army War College in Pennsylvania, finishing his course in 1979.\n\nIn 1986 he was promoted to major general, and assisted the Head of the Operations branch. In 1987 he became commander of the Central Command, and in 1989 completed the program for senior public figures at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs at Harvard University.\n\nIn 1990 he became head of the IDF's planning branch, and gained an MA from Haifa University in political science. He retired from the IDF in 1993.\n\nIn the same year as finishing his military career, Mitzna was elected mayor of Haifa representing Labor, and re-elected in 1998. He won the Labor's leadership elections on 19 November 2002 with 54% of the vote. During campaigning for the 2003 elections, Mitzna proposed that Israel pursue further negotiations with the Palestinian Authority, but if they failed to yield a solution, that Israel withdraw from the Gaza Strip and most of the West Bank, and unilaterally set its final borders. His position was lambasted by Likud leader Ariel Sharon, though later partially implemented by him as the disengagement plan.\n\nMitzna oversaw Labor's second worst electoral performance in the 2003 elections, the party winning just 19 seats. He resigned as party leader shortly after, replaced by Shimon Peres.\n\nIn November 2005, the Internal Affairs Minister appointed Mitzna acting mayor of Yeruham, a town in the southern Negev region, after the elected mayor was forced to step aside, due to incompetence. Mitzna resigned from the Knesset to take up the role.\n\nIn April 2008 and June 2009, Mitzna signed letters of support for the recently created J Street American pro-peace lobby group.\n\nOn 1 December 2012, Mitzna joined Tzipi Livni's new party, Hatnuah. He was elected to the Knesset in second place on the party's list in the 2013 elections. On 24 December 2014 he announced he was retiring from politics and would not seek re-election in 2015, although he supported the Zionist Union, an alliance of Hatnuah and Labor that had been formed for the elections.\n\n"}

The first installment of the \"Ocean's\" franchise, it is a remake of the 1960 Rat Pack film of the same name. \"Ocean's Eleven\" features an ensemble cast, including George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Andy García, Bernie Mac and Julia Roberts. \"Ocean's Eleven\" follows friends Danny Ocean (Clooney) and Rusty Ryan (Pitt), who plan a heist of $150 million from casino owner Terry Benedict (García), the lover of Ocean's ex-wife Tess (Roberts).\n\nUpon release, the film was a success at the box office and with critics; it was the fifth highest-grossing film of 2001, with a worldwide gross of $450 million. Soderbergh directed two sequels, \"Ocean's Twelve\" in 2004 and \"Ocean's Thirteen\" in 2007, which make up the \"Ocean's Trilogy\". \"Ocean's 8\", a spin-off with an all-female lead cast, was released in 2018.\n\nFollowing his release from prison, Danny Ocean violates his parole by traveling to California to meet his partner-in-crime and friend Rusty Ryan to propose a heist. The two go to Las Vegas to pitch the plan to wealthy friend and former casino owner Reuben Tishkoff. The plan consists of simultaneously robbing the Bellagio, the Mirage, and the MGM Grand casinos. Reuben's familiarity with casino security makes him very reluctant to get involved, but when he starts to think of it as a good way to get back at his rival, Terry Benedict, who owns all three casinos, Reuben agrees to finance the operation. Because the casinos are required by the Nevada Gaming Commission to have enough cash on hand to cover all their patrons' bets, the three predict that on the upcoming night of a highly anticipated boxing match, the Bellagio vault will contain more than $150,000,000.\n\nDanny and Rusty recruit eight former colleagues and criminal specialists: Linus Caldwell, a young and talented pickpocket; Frank Catton, a casino worker and con man; Virgil and Turk Malloy, a pair of gifted mechanics; Livingston Dell, an electronics and surveillance expert; Basher Tarr, an explosives expert; Saul Bloom, an elderly con man; and \"The Amazing\" Yen, an accomplished acrobat. Several team members carry out reconnaissance at the Bellagio to learn as much as possible about the security, the routines, the behaviors of the casino staff, and the building itself. Other members create a precise replica of the vault with which to practice maneuvering through its formidable security systems. During this planning phase, the team discovers that Danny's ex-wife, Tess, is Benedict's girlfriend. Rusty urges Danny to give up on the plan, believing Danny incapable of sound judgment while Tess is involved, but Danny refuses.\n\nOn the night of the fight, the plan is put into motion. Danny shows up at the Bellagio purposely to be seen by Benedict, who, as predicted, locks him in a storeroom with Bruiser, a bouncer. However, Bruiser is on Danny's payroll and allows him to access the vent system and join his team as they seize the vault, coincident with activities of their other team members in and around the casino. Rusty calls Benedict on a cell phone Danny dropped in Tess's coat earlier and tells him that unless he lets them have half of the money in the vault, they will blow it up; Benedict sees video footage confirming Rusty's claim. Benedict complies, having his bodyguards take the loaded duffel bags to a waiting van driven by remote control. Benedict has his men follow the van, while he calls in a SWAT team to try to secure the vault. The SWAT team's arrival causes a shootout that sets off the explosives and incinerates the remaining cash. After affirming the premises otherwise secure, the SWAT team collects their gear and departs.\n\nAs Benedict heads to examine the ruined vault himself, his men stop the van and find the bags were only loaded with flyers for prostitutes. Benedict studies the video footage and recognizes that the flooring in the vault on the video lacks the Bellagio logo, which had been added only recently to the vault. It is shown that Danny's team used their practice vault to create fake footage to fool Benedict. Furthermore, they themselves were the SWAT team and used their gear bags to take all of the money from the vault right under Benedict's nose. Benedict goes to see that Danny has seemingly been locked up in the storeroom throughout the heist and thus innocent of any crime. As Tess watches via CCTV, Danny tricks Benedict into saying he would give up Tess in exchange for the money. Benedict, unsatisfied with Danny's plan to get back the money, orders his men to escort Danny off the premises and inform the police that he is violating his parole by being in Las Vegas. Tess leaves Benedict and exits the hotel just in time to see Danny arrested. The rest of the team bask in the victory in front of the Fountains of the Bellagio, silently going their separate ways one-by-one. When Danny is released after serving time for his parole violation, he is met by Rusty and Tess. They drive off, closely followed by Benedict's bodyguards.\n\nIn order of recruitment: \n\n\n\nIn January 2000, Warner Bros. was moving forward with Steven Soderbergh on development of an \"Ocean's Eleven\" remake, starring George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Julia Roberts. Johnny Depp was being considered for Linus Caldwell, while Luke and Owen Wilson were in discussions to play the Malloy twins. However, the Wilson brothers had to vacate due to their commitment to \"The Royal Tenenbaums\". Mike Myers, Bruce Willis, Ewan McGregor, Alan Arkin and Ralph Fiennes were considered for roles but ended up dropping out. Filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen were considered as replacements for the Wilson brothers, but Soderbergh cast Scott Caan and Casey Affleck instead. Mark Wahlberg was originally cast as Linus Caldwell, but left in favor of starring in another remake, \"Planet of the Apes\", and was subsequently replaced with Matt Damon. Clooney's commitment to \"Ocean's Eleven\" forced him to turn down the lead role in \"Unfaithful\".\n\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 82% based on 172 reviews, with an average rating of 7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"As fast-paced, witty, and entertaining as it is star-studded and coolly stylish, \"Ocean's Eleven\" offers a well-seasoned serving of popcorn entertainment.\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 74 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\n\"People\" magazine called the film \"pure fun from start to finish,\" and included it in its end-of-year Best of Screen list. \"Newsweek\" said \"Ocean's Eleven\" \"bounces along with finger-snapping high spirits,\" and said that while Soderbergh has \"made deeper films, ...this carefree caper movie is nothing to sneeze at.\" \"Time\" magazine's reviewer Richard Corliss criticized the film, saying it \"doesn't offer much.\" In a poll during November 2008, \"Empire\" magazine called \"Ocean's Eleven\" the 500th best film on \"The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time.\" For Don Cheadle's role in this film, he needed to learn to speak with a cockney accent, which drew harsh reviews from critics and is recognized as being one of the worst accents in film. Cheadle commented on his accent, saying \"My British friends ... tell me [it's] a truly terrible London accent in Ocean's 13. You know something, I really worked on that accent. Went to London, spoke to people, got to know it... my agent said it was fine, so I'm stuck with this thing. Even though everyone laughs at me. So I sacked her, of course\".\n\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" put \"The \"Ocean's Eleven\" heist scene\" on its end-of-the-decade, \"best-of\" list, saying, \"Featuring three impregnable Vegas casinos and 11 ring-a-ding criminals, Steven Soderbergh's 2001 roll of the dice provided the most winning robbery sequence of the decade.\"\n\n\"Ocean's Eleven\" had a budget of about $85 million. On its opening weekend, it grossed an estimate of $38 million and was the top box-office draw for the weekend. The film grossed $183,417,150 in the United States and grossed $267,311,379 overseas, leaving a worldwide gross of $450,728,529.\n\n\"Ocean's Eleven\" was released on VHS and DVD on May 7, 2002.\n\nSoderbergh directed two sequels, \"Ocean's Twelve\" in 2004 and \"Ocean's Thirteen\" in 2007, which make up the \"Ocean's Trilogy\".\n\nA new \"Ocean's Eleven\" film with an all-female cast led by Sandra Bullock, titled \"Ocean's 8,\" was released June 8, 2018. It was conceived by producer Jerry Weintraub, Soderbergh and Clooney. Olivia Milch and Gary Ross were writer of the screenplay, and director respectively. Cate Blanchett, Helena Bonham Carter, Anne Hathaway, Sarah Paulson, Rihanna Fenty, Mindy Kaling, and Nora \"Awkwafina\" Lum made up the ensemble cast.\n\nTakarazuka Revue adapted the movie as a musical in 2011–2012 in Japan (Takarazuka Grand Theater; Tokyo Takarazuka Theater). The production was performed by Star Troupe and the cast included Reon Yuzuki as Danny Ocean, Nene Yumesaki as Tess Ocean and Shio Suzumi as Rusty Ryan.\n\nThe 2014 Bollywood film \"Happy New Year\" draws heavily on the plot of \"Ocean's Eleven\", with Shah Rukh Khan starring as the protagonist.\n\n\n"}

It is considered the precursor to the Lollapalooza touring festivals of the 1990s, an opinion shared by Astbury himself. The festival was held at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View on October 6 and the Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa on October 7. The event was intended to raise money for and awareness of Native-American-related causes. A performance by the American Indian Dance Theatre preceded the festival each day. The concert grounds also hosted tents for Act Up, Amnesty International, Greenpeace, Rock the Vote, and local animal rights organizations.\n\nThe artists featured were Soundgarden, Ice-T, Indigo Girls, Queen Latifah, Joan Baez, Steve Jones, Michelle Shocked, Iggy Pop, The Cramps, London Quireboys, The Mission UK and Public Enemy. The \"Los Angeles Times\" music critic described Canadian band Crash Vegas and UK band The Charlatans UK as the festival's \"least-known performers\", both deserving \"fuller hearings in more intimate surroundings\". Iggy Pop's performance was described as \"restrained\" compared to his typical \"combustive live\" performances. According to Astbury, the diversity of bands demonstrated that \"us and them doesn't exist any more\".\n\nBecause of violence at previous Public Enemy concerts, Public Enemy did not appear on the bill for the concert in Costa Mesa. When addressing the crowd, Ice-T, Queen Latifah, and Astbury all stated that Public Enemy was not at the festival owing to \"pressure from local authorities\", a claim denied by the Costa Mesa police chief. A show organizer stated that Public Enemy did not appear because of a scheduling conflict. Lenny Kravitz, also on the bill, did not perform that day. Astbury had wanted other performers to be part of the program, including Guns N' Roses, Tracy Chapman, Living Colour, Ziggy Marley, and Julian Lennon, but they could not participate because of previous commitments. He also excluded his own band, The Cult, from performing because he \"didn't want people to think we were using this to boost our career\".\n\nBoth concerts sold out, with over 10,000 attendees for each, but Astbury lost around $50,000 on the festival. Some of the tents for the advocacy groups drew long lineups from attendees, who signed up to support the causes.\n\nA Gathering of the Tribes was revisited in 1991 but this time as a traveling festival that was to visit multiple venues, with a bill featuring X, Fishbone, Steve Earle, EPMD, Hoodoo Gurus, Primus, and King's X, among others. However, this version of the tour was a financial failure and was cancelled before all the dates could be completed.\n\nAstbury was inspired to start A Gathering of the Tribes after having dinner with a Native American man whom he met in North Dakota while on a 1989 tour with Metallica. The man told Astbury that he was planning to study resource management at college in order to help purify his tribe's drinking water, then asked Astbury what he was doing for his community. Astbury had no answer for the man, then began to think about running a music festival. It led to the creation of a music festival \"of contrasting stylists ranging from hard rock to folk to rap\", because he wanted to oppose the musical and racial segregation prominent in pop music at the time. Astbury had considered hosting the concert in Monterey, as he had been interested in the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival.\n\n"}

{"id": "2251281", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2251281", "title": "Mortmain", "text": "Mortmain\n\nMortmain () is the perpetual, inalienable ownership of real estate by a corporation or legal institution; the term is usually used in the context of its prohibition. Historically, the land owner usually would be the religious office of a church; today, insofar as mortmain prohibitions against perpetual ownership still exist, it refers most often to modern companies and charitable trusts. The term \"mortmain\" is derived from Mediaeval Latin \"mortua manus\", literally \"dead hand\", through Old French \"morte main.\" (in modern French, \"mainmorte\").\n\nDuring the Middle Ages in countries such as England, the church acquired a substantial amount of real estate. As the church and religious orders were each recognised as a legal person separate from the office holder who administered the church land (such as the abbot or the bishop), the land would not escheat on the death of the holder, or pass by inheritance, as the church and the religious orders would not die. The land was held in perpetuity. This was in contrast to feudal practice in which the nobility would hold land granted by the king in return for service, especially service in war.\n\nOver time, the church gained a large share of land in many feudal states; this was a cause of increasing tension between the church and the Crown.\n\nIn 1279, and again in 1290, Statutes of Mortmain were passed by King Edward I to impose limits on the church's holding of property, although limits on the church's power to hold land are also found in earlier statutes, including Magna Carta (1215) and the Provisions of Westminster (1259). The broad effect of these provisions was that the authorisation of the Crown was needed before the land could vest perpetually in a corporation. As an example of the response of the institutions, the chartulary of Chertsey Abbey records that \"shortly after one of these statutes vulgarly called Mortmain\" in Ash, Surrey, were held by Robert de Zathe with sufficient common pasture for his flocks and herds, while Geoffrey de Bacsete and his brother William had .\n\nAlthough statutes prohibiting mortmain have been abolished in most countries today, a similar legal principle still exists in some jurisdictions in the form of the rule against perpetuities.\n\nMortmain played an important part in legal history, and earlier case law often needs to be considered against this background. For example, the judicial decision in \"Thornton v Howe\" (1862) 31 Beav 14 held that a trust for publishing the writings of Joanna Southcott was charitable, being for the \"advancement of religion\". This decision is often held up as setting the bar extremely low in determining whether a charity is for the advancement of religion. But if one considers that at the time the statutes against mortmain were in force, and that the effect of the decision was that the trust was void, rather than imbuing it with special privileges in relation to taxation, it puts a very different spin on the \"ratio decidendi\".\n\nWilliam Blackstone wrote, in 1765, \"The reason of [this] appellation Sir Edward Coke offers many conjectures; but there is one which seems more probable than any that he has given us: viz. that these purchases being usually made by ecclesiastical bodies, the members of which (being professed) were reckoned dead persons in law, land therefore, holden by them, might with great propriety be said to be held \"in mortua manu.\" [in dead hands].\"\n\n"}

It was one of the ALX-series bodywork, all of which (except the ALX100) featured the same designs on the front and rear panels that were originally designed for the new generation of mainly low-floor bus chassis produced since the late 1990s.\n\nVarious seating configurations were available, with Transport for London (TfL) specification models fitted with a central exit door. There are typically 45 seats on the upper deck, and between 17 (on the DAF DB250) and 22 seats on the lower deck. Longer models for use elsewhere have up to 47 seats on the upper deck, and 24 below with a central door. Stagecoach subsidiaries outside London have ALX400s on long-wheelbase Dennis Trident 2 chassis, fitted with 51 seats upstairs (47 on later models) and 28 downstairs.

Compliance is monitored by the United States Department of Education, which can impose civil penalties, up to $54,789 per violation, against institutions for each infraction and can suspend institutions from participating in federal student financial aid programs.\n\nThe law is named after Jeanne Clery, a 19-year-old Lehigh University student whom Josoph Henry raped and murdered in her campus hall of residence in 1986. Henry's murder of Ms. Clery triggered a backlash against unreported crime on campuses across the country.\n\nJosoph M. Henry, another student, raped and murdered Jeanne Clery in April 1986 in Stoughton Hall at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Henry was given a death sentence via the electric chair by a trial court, a decision which was upheld by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court when appealed. The attack on Clery was one of 38 violent crimes recorded at the university in three years. Her parents argued that, had the university's crime record been known, Clery would not have attended. They sued, were awarded $2 million, and founded Security on Campus, a non-profit group.\n\nBy October 1 of each year, institutions must publish and distribute their Annual Campus Security Report to current and prospective students and employees. Institutions are also allowed to provide notice of the report, a URL if available, and how to obtain a paper copy if desired. This report is required to provide crime statistics for the prior three years, policy statements regarding various safety and security measures, campus crime prevention program descriptions, and procedures to be followed in the investigation and prosecution of alleged sex offenses.\n\nThe institution's police department or security departments are required to maintain a public log of all crimes reported to them, or those of which they are made aware. The log is required to have the most recent 60 days' worth of information. Each entry in the log must contain the nature, date, time and general location of each crime and disposition of the complaint, if known. Information in the log older than 60 days must be made available within two business days. Crime logs must be kept for seven years, three years following the publication of the last annual security report.\n\nThe Clery Act requires institutions to give timely warnings of crimes that represent a threat to the safety of students or employees. Institutions are required to publish their policies regarding timely warnings in their Annual Campus Security Report. The institution is only required to notify the community of crimes which are covered by the Clery statistics.\n\nAn institution must keep the most recent eight years (as of 2012) of crime statistics that occurred: on campus, in institution residential facilities, in noncampus buildings, or on public property. Offenses are defined by the UCR Handbook and are not the state crime definitions but rather Federal crime definitions. This has led to possible discrepancies in data reporting. Some changes have been made to further define discrepancies in recent updates to the Clery Act. In 2014, new amendments were made to require reporting on domestic violence, dating violence and stalking. In cases of forcible sexual offenses, there have been reports of colleges questioning accounts of alleged victims, further complicating documentation and policing of student assaults.\n\nInstitutions are required to report on crimes such as:\n\nInstitutions are required to report on persons referred for campus disciplinary action for:\n\nInstitutions are required to report on crimes or bodily harm related to/caused by:\n\nNumerous institutions have been fined and found in non compliance of the Clery act. Many include defining of crimes, reporting methods and alerting students of dangers. From 2008-2012, 14 higher education institutions were fined for Clery Act noncompliance. Large scale Clery violations results in financial fines at institutions such as Pennsylvania State University, Eastern Michigan University, Virginia Tech, and University of Montana.\n\nReports on complaints of Clery Act noncompliance are available from the Federal Student Aid (FSA) website. Federal Student Aid, an office of the Department of Education, conducts reviews to evaluate compliance with the Clery Act. \n\nAccording to the Federal Student Aid (FSA) page on Clery Act Reports, \"The Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act is a federal statute requiring colleges and universities participating in federal financial aid programs to maintain and disclose campus crime statistics and security information. The U.S. Department of Education conducts reviews to evaluate an institution's compliance with the Clery Act requirements...Once a review is completed, the Department issues a Final Program Review Determination. Although regular program reviews may contain Clery Act findings, this page includes only those program reviews that were focused exclusively on the Clery Act. Below, you can access these reports as well as accompanying documentation which may include the complaint, school response, or fine action that resulted from the program review.\" \n\nThe case involving the second-highest fine imposed on an institution occurred in 2008. Eastern Michigan University was fined $357,500 for failing to warn the campus of a student's assault and death that occurred in 2006. Beyond reporting the incident, the school was fined for violating federal crime-reporting laws. The Laura Dickinson incident has been seen as a wake-up call on how universities report and display statistics on crimes that occur on university campuses. The incident brought forth university-wide changes in campus safety and safety notifications. The incident also brought changes in university administration, including the dismissal of the university's president, John A. Fallon.\n\nOn September 5, 2019, the U.S. Department of Education announced that Michigan State University would be fined $4.5 million, the largest ever Clery Act penalty, following an investigation into the institution's response to allegations of misconduct by Larry Nassar.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education is investigating Penn State over the Penn State sex abuse scandal. Their investigation arises from the university administration's alleged failure to report allegations of sex offenses on campus by Jerry Sandusky, a former school official, as being a violation of the Act. Former Penn State Defensive Coach Jerry Sandusky has been convicted of sexually abusing several young boys over several years, including incidents on campus. A campus safety advocacy group called the scandal \"the most extensive investigation the Department of Education has ever conducted\".\n\nNovember 3, 2016 The U.S. Department of Education announced that it is seeking to impose on Penn State University a record fine of nearly $2.4 million for 11 cited violations.\n\nIn the final report regarding the April 16, 2007 Virginia Tech massacre issued on Thursday, December 9, 2010 by the U.S. Department of Education under Arne Duncan, Virginia Tech was said to have violated this Act.\n\nAdditionally the Department of Education fined the University $55,000 on March 29, 2011 for \"failure to issue a timely warning\" in response to the shootings at West Ambler Johnston. The university appealed the fine arguing that actions were in compliance with guidelines distributed to schools by the Department of Education in a handbook. On March 30, 2012, the U.S. Department of Education’s administrative law judge ruled in favor of the university, saying in a statement: “This was not an unreasonable amount of time in which to issue a warning. …. if the later shootings at Norris Hall had not occurred, it is doubtful that the timing of the email would have been perceived as too late.”\n\nIn 2018, the Department of Education cited the University of Montana “for inaccurate and misleading crime statistics for calendar years 2012 through 2015,\" resulting in a nearly $1 million fine which the university is appealing.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was formed in 1724 when a portion of the Orthodox Church of Antioch went into communion with Rome, becoming an Eastern Catholic Church, while the rest of the ancient Patriarchate continues in full communion with the rest of the Eastern Orthodox Church.\n\nThe Melkite Greek Catholic Patriarch of Antioch's present complete title is \"Patriarch of Antioch and of All the East, of Alexandria and of Jerusalem of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church\", incorporating both of the church's other titular patriarchates.\n\nIts archiepiscopal see is the Cathedral of the Dormition of Our Lady (Arabic: كاتدرائية سيدة النياح للروم الملكيين في دمشق ) in Damascus, Syria. It was visited by Pope John Paul II in 2001.\n\nThe Melkite Greek Catholic Church is one of five churches that are continuations of the original See of Antioch. Thus, the Melkite Greek Catholic Church traces its existence all the way back to Saint Peter in a line of apostolic succession acknowledged by both Catholic and Orthodox canons. This claim is accepted by the Holy See and is not disputed by the other two Eastern Catholic Churches that also claim descent from the ancient See of Antioch, namely the Maronite Church and the Syriac Catholic Church, which both also have Patriarchs of Antioch.\n\nThe Patriarch also holds the office of Metropolitan of an empty Ecclesiastical province without an actual suffragan see, actually comprising only his proper Metropolitan Archeparchy of Damascus (of the Melkites)/ Damasco (Curiate Italian) / Dimašq / Aš-Šām / Damascen(us) Græcorum Melkitarum (Latin). Like the Patriarchate, in Rome it depends only upon the Congregation for the Oriental Churches.\n\nAs per 2014, it pastorally served 3,000 Catholics in 8 parishes and 1 mission with 9 priests (6 diocesan, 3 religious), 3 deacons, 33 lay religious (3 brothers, 30 sisters) and 10 seminarians.\n\nIn continuation of the earlier Melkite patriarchates of those ancient sees, two \"titular patriarchates\" exist, which are however simply titles, vested in the residential Patriarch of Antioch, which also have Catholic residential counterparts: \n\nDuring a vacancy in the Patriarchate (such as following the resignation of Gregory III Laham in 2017), the bishop of the permanent synod who is most senior by ordination serves as administrator in chief of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church.\n\n\n\n"}

The case ended favorably for Theobald in 1146. Vacarius next surfaces in 1149, when he taught to crowds of those wealthy and those not. For the latter, he prepared a nine-volume compendium of the \"Codex Justinianus\". The book was reputed to resolve all of the legal questions commonly debated in the schools, and became a leading textbook in the emerging university. Often described as the \"Liber pauperum\", the book gave rise to the nickname \"pauperistae\" for students of law in Oxford. Nearly complete manuscripts of this work survive in the cathedral libraries at Worcester and Prague, and in the town library at Bruges. Fragments can be found in Oxford's Bodleian Library and in several of the college libraries at Oxford.\n\nDespite its popularity, the new legal texts were not without opposition. King Stephen of England (who was not only king, but also a brother of Henry of Blois) silenced Vacarius, and ordered the destruction of the books of civil and canon law that Theobald had brought over from Italy with Vacarius. This royal edict seems to have been abandoned, however, after Stephen's death in 1154, and evidence suggests that civil law was soon again a favorite subject at Oxford. By 1190, two students from Friesland divided the evening between them to make a copy of the \"Liber pauperum\".\n\nIt remains unknown whether Vacarius resumed his lectures after their interruption. In the same year that Stephen died, Vacarius's old friend Roger de Pont L'Evêque was promoted to the position of archbishop of York. Roger had invited Vicarius to join him in the north as legal adviser and ecclesiastical judge, and his name appears frequently in both papal letters and the chronicles of the period, indicating that he served in this capacity. For his services, he was rewarded with a prebend in the collegiate church of secular canons at Southwell. In 1191, he was allowed to cede half to his nephew Reginald. Vacarius is last heard of in 1198, when he and the prior of Thurgarton were commissioned by Pope Innocent III to fulfill a letter referring to crusades.\n\nIn addition to his legal work, surviving manuscripts attest to Vacarius' deliberations on other matters as well, likely in the latter half of his life. One of these, the \"Summa de assumpto homine\", deals with the humanity of Christ, while the other, \"Summa de matrimonio\", is a legal argument about the nature of marriage, in which he disputes both Gratian and Peter Lombard.\n\nIt is to Vacarius that we owe most of the information that has come down to us about Speroni, a heretic from Piacenza.\n\n"}

Irreverent and stridently non-conformist in tone, the publication describes itself as above all secular, skeptic, and atheist, far-left-wing, and anti-racist publishing articles about the extreme right (especially the French nationalist National Front party), religion (Catholicism, Islam, Judaism), politics and culture.\n\nThe magazine has been the target of two terrorist attacks, in 2011 and 2015. Both were presumed to be in response to a number of controversial Muhammad cartoons it published. In the second of these attacks, 12 people were killed, including publishing director Charb and several other prominent cartoonists.\n\n\"Charlie Hebdo\" first appeared in 1970 as a companion to the monthly \"Hara-Kiri\" magazine, after a previous title was banned for mocking the death of former French President Charles de Gaulle. In 1981 publication ceased, but the magazine was resurrected in 1992. Its current editor-in-chief is Gérard Biard. The previous editors were François Cavanna (1970–1981) and Philippe Val (1992–2009). The magazine is published every Wednesday, with special editions issued on an unscheduled basis.\n\nIn 1960, Georges \"Professeur Choron\" Bernier and François Cavanna launched a monthly magazine entitled \"Hara-Kiri\". Choron acted as the director of publication and Cavanna as its editor. Eventually Cavanna gathered together a team which included Roland Topor, Fred, Jean-Marc Reiser, Georges Wolinski, , and Cabu. After an early reader's letter accused them of being \"dumb and nasty\" (\"bête et méchant\"), the phrase became an official slogan for the magazine and made it into everyday language in France.\n\n\"Hara-Kiri\" was briefly banned in 1961, and again for six months in 1966. A few contributors did not return along with the newspaper, such as Gébé, Cabu, Topor, and Fred. New members of the team included , , and Willem.\n\nIn 1969, the \"Hara-Kiri\" team decided to produce a weekly publication – on top of the existing monthly magazine – which would focus more on current affairs. This was launched in February as \"Hara-Kiri Hebdo\" and renamed \"L'Hebdo Hara-Kiri\" in May of the same year. (\"Hebdo\" is short for \"hebdomadaire\" – \"weekly\")\n\nIn November 1970, the former French president Charles de Gaulle died in his home village of Colombey-les-Deux-Églises, eight days after a disaster in a nightclub, the Club Cinq-Sept fire, which caused the death of 146 people. The magazine released a cover spoofing the popular press's coverage of this disaster, headlined \"Tragic Ball at Colombey, one dead.\" As a result, the weekly was banned.\n\nIn order to sidestep the ban, the editorial team decided to change its title, and used \"Charlie Hebdo\". The new name was derived from a monthly comics magazine called \"Charlie\" (later renamed \"Charlie Mensuel\", meaning \"Charlie Monthly\"), which had been started by Bernier and Delfeil de Ton in 1969. The monthly \"Charlie\" took its name from the lead character of one of the comics it originally published, \"Peanuts\"s Charlie Brown. Using that title for the new weekly magazine was also an inside joke about Charles de Gaulle. The first issue did feature a \"Peanuts\" strip, as the editors were fans of the series.\n\nIn December 1981, publication ceased.\n\nIn 1991, Gébé, Cabu and others were reunited to work for \"La Grosse Bertha\", a new weekly magazine resembling \"Charlie Hebdo\" created in reaction to the First Gulf War and edited by singer and comedian Philippe Val. However, the following year, Val clashed with the publisher, who wanted apolitical humour, and was fired. Gébé and Cabu walked out with him and decided to launch their own paper again. The three called upon Cavanna, Delfeil de Ton and Wolinski, requesting their help and input. After much searching for a new name, the obvious idea of resurrecting \"Charlie Hebdo\" was agreed on. The new magazine was owned by Val, Gébé, Cabu and singer Renaud. Val was editor, Gébé publication director.\n\nThe publication of the new \"Charlie Hebdo\" began in July 1992 amidst much publicity. The first issue under the new publication sold 100,000 copies. Choron, who had fallen out with his former colleagues, tried to restart a weekly \"Hara-Kiri\", but its publication was short-lived. Choron died in January 2005.\n\nOn 26 April 1996, François Cavanna, Charb and Philippe Val filed 173,704 signatures, obtained in eight months, with the aim of banning the political party Front National, since it would have contravened the articles 1, 2, 4, 6 and 7 of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.\n\nIn 2000, journalist Mona Chollet was sacked after she had protested against a Philippe Val article which called Palestinians \"non-civilised\". In 2004, following the death of Gébé, Val succeeded him as director of publication, while still holding his position as editor.\n\nIn 2008, controversy broke over a column by veteran cartoonist Siné which led to accusations of antisemitism and Siné's sacking by Val. Siné successfully sued the newspaper for unfair dismissal and \"Charlie Hebdo\" was ordered to pay him €90,000 in damages. Siné launched a rival paper called ' which later became '. In 2009, Philippe Val resigned after being appointed director of France Inter, a public radio station to which he has contributed since the early 1990s. His functions were split between two cartoonists, Charb and Riss. Val gave away his shares in 2011. As of March 2011, \"Charlie Hebdo\" was owned by Charb (600 shares), Riss (599 shares), finance director Éric Portheault (299 shares), and Cabu and Bernard Maris with one share each.\n\nGérard Biard is the editor-in-chief of \"Charlie Hebdo\".\n\nOn 5 May 2015 Charlie Hebdo was awarded the PEN/Toni and James C. Goodale Freedom of Expression Courage Award at the PEN American Center Literary Gala in New York City.\n\nIn 2007 the Grand Mosque of Paris began criminal proceedings against the chief-editor of \"Charlie Hebdo\", Philipe Val, under France's hate speech laws for publicly abusing a group on the ground of their religion. The lawsuit was limited to three specific cartoons, including one depicting Muhammad carrying a bomb in his turban. In March 2007 a Paris court acquitted Val, finding that it was fundamentalists, rather than Muslims, who were being ridiculed in the cartoons.\n\nOn 2 July 2008, a column by the cartoonist Siné (Maurice Sinet) appeared in \"Charlie Hebdo\" citing a rumour that Jean Sarkozy, son of Nicolas Sarkozy, had announced his intention to convert to Judaism before marrying his fiancée, Jewish heiress Jessica Sebaoun-Darty. Siné added, \"he'll go far, this lad!\" This led to complaints of antisemitism. The magazine's editor, Philippe Val, ordered Siné to write a letter of apology or face termination. The cartoonist said he would rather \"cut his own balls off,\" and was promptly fired. Both sides subsequently filed lawsuits, and in December 2010, Siné won a 40,000 euros court judgment against his former publisher for wrongful termination.\n\nControversy arose over the publication's edition of 9 February 2006. Under the title \"\"Mahomet débordé par les intégristes\"\" (\"Muhammad overwhelmed by fundamentalists\"), the front page showed a cartoon of a weeping Muhammad saying \"\"C'est dur d'être aimé par des cons\"\" (\"it's hard being loved by jerks\"). The newspaper reprinted the twelve cartoons of the \"Jyllands-Posten\" Muhammad cartoons controversy and added some of their own. Compared to a regular circulation of 100,000 sold copies, this edition enjoyed great commercial success. 160,000 copies were sold and another 150,000 were in print later that day.\n\nIn response, French President Jacques Chirac condemned \"overt provocations\" which could inflame passions. \"Anything that can hurt the convictions of someone else, in particular religious convictions, should be avoided\", Chirac said. The Grand Mosque of Paris, the Muslim World League and the Union of French Islamic Organisations (UOIF) sued, claiming the cartoon edition included racist cartoons. A later edition contained a statement by a group of twelve writers warning against Islamism.\n\nThe suit by the Grand Mosque and the UOIF reached the courts in February 2007. Publisher Philippe Val contended \"It is racist to imagine that they can't understand a joke,\" but Francis Szpiner, the lawyer for the Grand Mosque, explained the suit: \"Two of those caricatures make a link between Muslims and Muslim terrorists. That has a name and it's called racism.\"\n\nFuture president Nicolas Sarkozy sent a letter to be read in court expressing his support for the ancient French tradition of satire. François Bayrou and future president François Hollande also expressed their support for freedom of expression. The French Council of the Muslim Faith (CFCM) criticised the expression of these sentiments, claiming that they were politicising a court case.\n\nOn 22 March 2007, executive editor Val was acquitted by the court. The court followed the state attorney's reasoning that two of the three cartoons were not an attack on Islam, but on Muslim terrorists, and that the third cartoon with Muhammad with a bomb in his turban should be seen in the context of the magazine in question, which attacked religious fundamentalism.\n\nIn November 2011, the newspaper's office in the 20th arrondissement was fire-bombed and its website hacked. The attacks were presumed to be linked to its decision to rename the edition of 3 November 2011 \"Charia Hebdo\", with Muhammad listed as the \"editor-in-chief\". The cover, featuring a cartoon of Muhammad saying: \"100 lashes of the whip if you don't die laughing\" by Luz (Rénald Luzier), had circulated on social media for a couple of days.\n\nThe \"Charia Hebdo\" issue had been a response to recent news of the post-election introduction of sharia law in Libya and the victory of the Islamist party in Tunisia. It especially focuses on oppression of women under sharia, taking aim at domestic violence, mandatory veiling, burquas, restrictions on freedom, forced marriage, and stoning of those accused of adultery. It also targeted oppression of gays and dissenters, and practices such as stoning, flogging, hand/foot/tongue amputations, polygamy, forced marriage, and early indoctrination of children. \"Guest editor\" Muhammad is portrayed as a good-humoured voice of reason, decrying the recent elections and calling for a separation between politics and religion, while stating that Islam is compatible with humour. The magazine responded to the bombing by distributing some four times the usual number of copies.\n\nCharb was quoted by Associated Press stating that the attack might have been carried out by \"stupid people who don't know what Islam is\" and that they are \"idiots who betray their own religion\". Mohammed Moussaoui, head of the French Council of the Muslim Faith, said his organisation deplores \"the very mocking tone of the paper toward Islam and its prophet but reaffirms with force its total opposition to all acts and all forms of violence.\" François Fillon, the prime minister, and Claude Guéant, the interior minister, voiced support for \"Charlie Hebdo\", as did feminist writer Ayaan Hirsi Ali, who criticised calls for self-censorship.\n\nIn September 2012, the newspaper published a series of satirical cartoons of Muhammad, some of which featured nude caricatures of him. Given that this issue came days after a series of attacks on US embassies in the Middle East, purportedly in response to the anti-Islamic film \"Innocence of Muslims\", the French government decided to increase security at certain French embassies, as well as to close the French embassies, consulates, cultural centres, and international schools in about 20 Muslim countries. In addition, riot police surrounded the offices of the magazine to protect it against possible attacks.\n\nForeign Minister Laurent Fabius criticised the magazine's decision, saying, \"In France, there is a principle of freedom of expression, which should not be undermined. In the present context, given this absurd video that has been aired, strong emotions have been awakened in many Muslim countries. Is it really sensible or intelligent to pour oil on the fire?\" The US White House said \"a French magazine published cartoons featuring a figure resembling the Prophet Muhammad, and obviously, we have questions about the judgment of publishing something like this.\" However, the newspaper's editor defended publication of the cartoons, saying, \"We do caricatures of everyone, and above all every week, and when we do it with the Prophet, it's called provocation.\"\n\nOn 7 January 2015, two Islamist gunmen forced their way into the Paris headquarters of \"Charlie Hebdo\" and opened fire, killing twelve: staff cartoonists Charb, Cabu, Honoré, Tignous and Wolinski, economist Bernard Maris, editors Elsa Cayat and Mustapha Ourrad, guest Michel Renaud, maintenance worker Frédéric Boisseau and police officers Brinsolaro and Merabet, and wounding eleven, four of them seriously.\n\nDuring the attack, the gunmen shouted \"\"Allahu akbar\"\" (\"God is great\" in Arabic) and also \"the Prophet is avenged\". President François Hollande described it as a \"terrorist attack of the most extreme barbarity\". The two gunmen were identified as Saïd Kouachi and Chérif Kouachi, French Muslim brothers of Algerian descent.\n\nThe day after the attack, the remaining staff of \"Charlie Hebdo\" announced that publication would continue, with the following week's edition of the newspaper to be published according to the usual schedule with a print run of one million copies, up significantly from its usual 60,000. On 13 January 2015, the news came on BBC that the first issue after the massacre would come out in three million copies. On Wednesday itself it was announced that with a huge demand in France, the print run would be raised from three to five million copies. The newspaper announced the revenue from the issue would go towards the families of the victims.\n\nThe French government granted nearly €1 million to support the magazine. The Digital Innovation Press Fund (French: \"Fonds Google–AIPG pour l’Innovation Numérique de la presse\"), partially funded by Google, donated €250,000, matching a donation by the French Press and Pluralism Fund. The Guardian Media Group pledged a donation of £100,000.\n\n After the attacks, the phrase \"\", French for \"I am Charlie\", was adopted by supporters of free speech and freedom of expression who were reacting to the shootings. The phrase identifies a speaker or supporter of those who were killed at the \"Charlie Hebdo\" shooting, and by extension, a supporter of freedom of speech and resistance to armed threats. Some journalists embraced the expression as a rallying cry for the freedom of self-expression.\n\nThe slogan was first used on Twitter and spread to the Internet at large. The Twitter account and the original \"Je suis Charlie\" picture bearing the phrase in white Charlie Hebdo style font on black background were created by French journalist and artist Joachim Roncin just after the massacre.\n\nThe website of \"Charlie Hebdo\" went offline shortly after the shooting, and when it returned it bore the legend \"Je Suis Charlie\" on a black background. The statement was used as the hashtag #jesuischarlie on Twitter, as computer-printed or hand-made placards and stickers, and displayed on mobile phones at vigils, and on many websites, particularly media sites. While other symbols were used, notably holding pens in the air, the phrase \"Not Afraid\", and tweeting certain images, \"\"Je Suis Charlie\"\" became more widespread.\n\nA series of rallies took place in cities across France on 10–11 January 2015 to honour the victims of the \"Charlie Hebdo\" shooting, and also to voice support for freedom of speech.\n\nLuz, one of the survivors of the attack, welcomed the show of support for the magazine, but criticized the use of symbols contrary to its values. He noted: \"People sang \"La Marseillaise\". We're speaking about the memory of Charb, Tignous, Cabu, Honoré, Wolinski: they would all have abhorred that kind of attitude.\" Willem, another surviving cartoonist, declared support of free expression would be \"naturally a good thing\", but rejected that of far-right figures such as Geert Wilders and Marine Le Pen: \"We vomit on those who suddenly declared that they were our friends\".\n\nUnrest in Niger following the publication of the post-attack issue of \"Charlie Hebdo\" resulted in ten deaths, dozens injured, and at least nine churches burned. \"The Guardian\" reported seven churches burned in Niamey alone. Churches were also reported to be on fire in eastern Maradi and Goure. Violent demonstrations also were prevalent in Zinder, where some burned French flags. There were violent demonstrations in Karachi in Pakistan, where Asif Hassan, a photographer working for the Agence France-Presse, was seriously injured by a shot to the chest. In Algiers and Jordan, protesters clashed with police, while peaceful demonstrations were held in Khartoum, Sudan, Russia, Mali, Senegal, and Mauritania.\n\nRT reported that a million people attended a demonstration in Grozny, the capital city of the Chechen Republic, protesting against the depictions of Muhammad in \"Charlie Hebdo\" and proclaiming that Islam is a religion of peace. One of the slogans was \"Violence is not the method\". Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov declared a regional holiday and denounced \"people without spiritual and moral values\" in front of an audience estimated to range between 600,000 and a million people.\n\nOne week after the murders, Donald Trump mocked \"Charlie Hebdo\", saying the magazine reminded him of another \"nasty and dishonest\" satirical publication and that the magazine was on the verge of financial collapse.\n\nA British NGO, the Islamic Human Rights Commission, gave their 2015 international 'Islamophobe of the Year' award to \"Charlie Hebdo\", whereas another British organisation, the National Secular Society, awarded the \"Charlie Hebdo\" staff with Secularist of the Year 2015 \"for their courageous response to the terror attack\". The magazine said it would donate the associated £5,000 prize money to the fund that supports the families of the murdered cartoonists.\n\nFollowing some controversies over the paper's future following the 2015 attack, Charb's 40% stake in \"Charlie Hebdo\" was purchased from his parents by Riss and Eric Portheault, who were as of July 2015 sole shareholders in the paper. \"Charlie Hebdo\" switched to a new legal press publisher status which requires 70% of profits to be reinvested.\n\nSince January 2015 \"Charlie Hebdo\" has continued to be embroiled in controversy.\nDaniel Schneidermann argues that the 2015 attack raised the profile of the paper internationally with non-Francophone audiences, meaning that only parts of the paper are selectively translated into English, making it easy to misrepresent the editorial stance of the publication and the purpose of provocative work. \n\nIn February 2015 \"Charlie Hebdo\" was accused of attacking freedom of press when its lawyer Richard Malka tried to prevent the publication of the magazine \"Charpie Hebdo\", a pastiche of \"Charlie Hebdo\".\n\nIn October 2015 Nadine Morano was depicted as a baby with Down syndrome in the arms of General de Gaulle after making remarks supporting the National Front. This was criticized as a reference to de Gaulle's daughter, Anne, and as disparaging to people with disabilities. A response from a reader, a mother with a Down syndrome daughter, commented \"The stupidity is racism, it's intolerance, it's Morano. The stupidity isn't trisomy [Down's syndrome]\" (\"la bêtise, c'est le racisme, c'est l'intolérance, c'est Morano. La bêtise, ce n'est pas la trisomie\")\n\nThe 14 September 2015 edition's cover cartoon by Coco depicted a migrant being maltreated by a man who proclaims \"welcome to refugees\" - in order to parody European claims about compassion. Riss wrote an editorial on the European migrant crisis, arguing that it was hypocritical for Hungarian politicians to declare themselves compassionate because of their Christian beliefs, but at the same time reject migrants from Syria. Riss parodied anti-immigrant attitudes by featuring a cartoon with a caricature of Jesus walking on water next to a drowning Muslim boy, with the caption \"this is how we know Europe is Christian\". The cartoons were widely seen as gallows humour in France, but prompted another wave of controversy abroad. That issue also included a caricature of the dead body of Syrian Kurdish refugee child Alan Kurdi next to a McDonald's sign with the caption, \"So close to the goal.\" In response to criticism, cartoonist Corinne Rey said that she was criticising the consumerist society that was being sold to migrants like a dream. After the New Year's Eve sexual assaults in Germany, a January 2016 edition included a cartoon by Riss about Kurdi, reflecting fickle sentiment towards refugees by including a caption questioning whether the boy would have grown up to be an \"ass groper in Germany\".\n\nFollowing the crash of Metrojet Flight 9268 in October 2015, which killed 224 civilians, mostly Russian women and children, and was seen as a probable terrorist bombing by UK and US authorities, \"Charlie Hebdo\" published cartoons which were perceived in Russia as mocking the victims of the tragedy. One of the cartoons showed a victim's blue-eyed skull and a burned-out plane on the ground, with the caption: \"The dangers of Russian low cost\" flights. The other showed pieces of the plane falling on an Islamic State (ISIS) fighter with the caption: \"Russia's air force intensifies its bombing.\" A spokesman for Vladimir Putin called the artwork \"sacrilege\", and members of the State Duma called for the magazine to be banned as extremist literature and demanded an apology from France.\n\nIn March 2016, one year after the attack, the weekly featured a caricature of Yahweh with a Kalashnikov rifle. The Vatican and Jewish groups said they were offended, and the Associated Press censored images of the cover.\n\nOn 2 September 2016, following the August 2016 Central Italy earthquake, which caused 294 deaths, the French magazine published a cartoon in which the earthquake victims are depicted as pasta dishes, under the title \"Séisme à l'italienne\". In response to the reaction of Italians unleashed on social networks, the cartoonist Coco pointed out with another cartoon on the official Facebook page of the magazine, \"Italians ... it's not Charlie Hebdo who builds your houses, it's the Mafia!\" The French ambassador in Rome, in a statement, pointed out that the French Government's position on the Italian earthquake is not that expressed by \"Charlie Hebdo\".\n\nOn 29 December 2016, Russia accused \"Charlie Hebdo\" of 'mocking' the Black Sea plane crash after publishing 'inhuman' cartoons about the disaster. In one reference to the crash, which claimed 92 lives, including 64 members of the Alexandrov Ensemble choir, the French magazine depicted a jet hurtling downwards along with words translated as: 'Bad news... Putin wasn't on board'. Russian defence spokesman called cartoons 'a poorly-created abomination'. A Russian Defense Ministry spokesman said: \"If such, I dare say, 'artistry' is the real manifestation of 'Western values', then those who hold and support them are doomed\".\n\nSince 2016 Riss is now the publishing director of the magazine, and he owns 70% of the shares. The other 30% is owned by Éric Portheault.\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}
{"id": "2251401", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2251401", "title": "Key date", "text": "Key date\n\nIn coin collecting, a key date refers to a date (or date and mint mark combination) of a given coin series or set that is harder to obtain than other dates in the series. The next level of difficult to obtain coins in series are often referred to as semi-key dates or simply semi-keys.\n\nFor example, the 1909-S VDB is the key date in the Lincoln cent series. The 1914-D and 1931-S are considered semi-keys. In the United Kingdom £1 coins from 1988 are considered key date coins.\n\nWhat makes a coin a \"key\" is somewhat more complicated because there are many issues that are easy to obtain in lower grades and very hard to find in higher ones. Collectors who want a series in near uncirculated condition may find some date/mint combinations extremely rare. This is because low mintage coins were frequently kept by collectors and saw little or no circulation, while common dates were rarely saved and typically became heavily worn. Another factor in making these \"conditional rarities\" is that in certain years some or all of the mints did poor strikings of a coin. For example, finding the common 1919-D Walking Liberty half dollar in well struck, near-perfect uncirculated condition, is an almost impossible challenge for even the collector of substantial means.\n\nProfessional and avid coin collectors will often not simply collect coins, but will specialize on a specific types of coin and then attempt to collect every coin in the series, i.e. one from every year that type of coin was minted with all variations. These variations most typically include the mint mark, but other variations can exist. One possibility can be the material in which the coin was minted. In some years, for example, the same coin might be minted from two or even three different metal combinations, such as steel, nickel, iron, gold, bronze, or silver. The Eisenhower dollar, for example, was minted in cupronickel for circulation strikes but in 40% silver for proof and uncirculated collector specimens from 1971 through 1976. Artistic differences or errors on the die that struck the coins and at the highest quality that can be found are also possible varieties a collector might pursue. The 1922 \"no D\" and \"weak D\" Lincoln cents are an examples in which extremely worn dies struck coins with missing or very faint mint marks. The 1942/1 Mercury dime minted in 1942 is another example, in which a hubbing error produced coins on which the final digit of the date shows a \"2\" superimposed over a \"1\".\n\nExperienced collectors may begin a collection by first obtaining specimens of the key dates, as \"key date\" coins for a set are often what prevents the collection from being a complete set. Once the key dates, which often represent the major share of the collection's value, are obtained completing the set is a fairly straightforward matter.\n\n\n4321\n"}

It is the outflow of Lake Te Anau, flowing from it into Lake Manapouri to the south, and from there flows south for before reaching the Foveaux Strait south of Tuatapere. It also takes water from Lake Monowai.\n\nThe Upper Waiau River that flows between Lakes Manapouri and Te Anau doubled as the fictional River Anduin at the end of the of \"The Lord of the Rings\" film trilogy, for the scenes where the Uruk-hai chase the Fellowship along the river banks. A proposal that a stretch of river below the area known as Balloon Loop be named the Anduin Reach to honour New Zealand film maker Peter Jackson for his use of the area as the River Anduin was rejected by the New Zealand Geographic Board in April 2009.\n\nThe Waiau River is the largest river system in the southwestern corner of the South Island. It has its sources in the Eglinton and Clinton Rivers, both of which are major inflows to Lake Te Anau, one of the two large lakes formed from glaciation which are part of the Waiau's system. Other rivers to flow into Te Anau include the Glaisnock River, Wapiti, Doon, and Upukerora Rivers, as well as numerous burns, of which the largest are the Junction, Woodrow, Ettrick, Snag, and Mackenzie Burns.\n\nThe Waiau, so named, flows from the southern tip of Te Anau and meanders for some 12 kilometres along the western edge of a small plain before entering the northeastern corner of Lake Manapouri, the second of the two large lakes in the Waiau system. Manapouri is also fed by the Spey and Grebe Rivers, as well as the Freeman, Awe, and Iris Burns. The Waiau flows out of the lake in the southeast, close to the small town of Manapouri, and shortly thereafter is joined by the waters of the Mararoa River.\n\nFrom here, the Waiau continues south across a relatively narrow plain, fed by numerous small creeks and burns, the largest of which are the Excelsior, Whare and Redcliff Creeks and the Borland Burn. At Monowai it is met by the Monowai River, the outflow of a further glacially formed lake, also named Monowai. At the Waiau's junction with the small Wairaki River the plain widens. From here the Waiau is fed by numerous other streams and burns, notably the Lill Burn close to Clifden and the Alton Burn, as well as the Orauea River, close to Tuatapere. As the river nears the coast it widens, with several small low-lying islands contained within its channels At its mouth on Te Waewae Bay, the river forms a long tidal lagoon separated from the sea by a narrow sandbar which extends along the coast for several kilometres.\n\nThere are diverse species in the forested catchment basin of the Waiau River. Vegetative understory within most of the Fiordland National Park includes numerous fern species including the crown fern (\"Lomaria discolor\").\n\nSeveral species of endangered birds live around the shores of Lake Te Anau, and the upper Waiau River, notably the Takahē (\"Notornis hochstetteri\"). An area between the Middle and South Fiords called the Murchison Mountains is a sanctuary set aside for these birds. The western shore of Lake Te Anau also holds the Te Ana-au Caves, from which Lake Te Anau derives its name.\n\nIn March 2007, the Fiordland Trails Trust was established to build a cycle trail along the banks of the Upper Waiau, linking the Township of Te Anau to the Township of Manapouri.\n\nA survey of the “Anduin Reach” was conducted in 2007, and landmark names were proposed based on the \"Lord of the Rings\" film trilogy. It was decided that Anduin Reach should be the place name to help promote the future prospects of the Cycle Trail Project. \n\n"}

He is the vocalist and bass player and occasional guitarist of the influential thrash metal and black metal band Venom, and the founding member of Venom from 1979 to present day.\n\nAfter playing in a couple of high school bands; Dwarfstar and Album Graecum, Conrad Lant took the stage name Cronos and joined a band called Guillotine as a guitarist in 1979, where he met Jeffrey Dunn who later became Mantas. In 1979, the original bass player left one week before a church hall gig. Instead of not playing the venue, Cronos took up the bass and they changed the band name to 'Venom'. He continued to play the bass throughout his career in Venom. In 1980, the band's vocalist, Clive Archer (with stage name Jesus Christ), left the band, leaving Cronos to take over this role too and finalising the band into a 3 piece group.\n\nCronos was working in a recording studio after he left school called Impulse Studios, the studio had a number of labels releasing albums by folk musicians and local tv comedians, although he eventually convinced the studio to start a label for rock bands, the label was called 'Neat Records' and began signing bands from up and down the UK, releasing singles and albums from 1980 onwards. As the members of Venom could not afford the studio time fees, Cronos was able to talk the studio engineer into letting him have some free time in exchange for staying back late after work and carrying out other unpaid work. Cronos sent many copies of the Venom demos to various record labels and also the rock press, where a journalist for the 'Sounds' magazine [Geoff Barton] featured 3 Venom songs in his playlist, which got the attention of the label 'Neat Records', who then agreed to release the first Venom single. 'In League With Satan' c/w Live Like An Angel (Die Like A Devil).\n\nCronos was also responsible for designing and creating all of the infamous Venom Logo and the sleeves artwork for their many single and album releases. He wanted to use the 'Sigil Of Baphomet' as the bands main emblem, although he wanted to recreate a new version of the sigil to be new and original concept, so he set out to redesigning it. The Venom logo was drawn and redrawn many times before he was happy, and the development of the logo can be seen from the bands many singles and albums releases, as the logo become more and more fine tuned as the years go on. The logo continues to evolve as Cronos still designs new versions for merchandise and other albums.\n\nVenom took a break in 1988 and so Cronos embarked on a solo career and occasionally featured in many other bands of a similar genre, including Cronos, Enthroned, Cradle of Filth (Cronos contributed a monologue to the end of the Cradle track \"Haunted Shores,\" from their 1996 album \"Dusk... and Her Embrace\"), Warpath, Massacre and Necrodeath. He also produced some of the albums for other bands.\n\nIn 1995 Cronos contacted the original guitarist and drummer and reformed the original Venom line-up, where they headlined the Dynamo Festival in 1996 to 90,000 fans. Venom tried to continue with the original line up members but only managed to play one show per year for the next few years. They had signed a 3 album deal with CBH/Steamhammer in Germany, but when they took the option for the second album after 'Cast In Stone', certain members didn't want to continue. Venom employed a stand in drummer for the next album (Resurrection) which was well received by the critics, although they still only managed to play 2 shows, [Wacken and Holland]. Venom took another short break after Cronos was hurt in a climbing accident, but in 2004, Cronos enlisted his 'Cronos band' guitarist 'Mykas' and set about rebuilding the bands reputation with the album 'Metal Black' in 2006, and a sold out UK tour in the UK and 4 headline shows at major European festivals. In 2007 Cronos replaced the guitarist with 'Rage, releasing the album 'Hell' in 2008 and again touring to sell out shows. By 2009 'Dante' joined the band, and starting with a full South American tour, Venom continue to headline many various festivals each year. In 2019 this line up of: Cronos, Rage and Dante is 10 years strong, with 3 albums such as the 2011 'Fallen Angels', the 2015 'From The Very Depths' and the 2018 'Storm The Gates'.\n\nIn 2000, the band went on to headline the Wacken Open Air Festival in Germany and play a one-off show in the Netherlands before they were forced to take a break after Cronos was injured in a climbing accident in 2002, which left him unable to play bass or sing for nearly 2 years. He took to the computer to pass the time and studied computing and games programming, he learned 3D software skills and worked as the main multimedia engineer for the computer and internet solutions companies K-Class Systems and Globalfibre.tv, where along with company owner Scott Toward, they created the first computer models for streaming media for the internet and mobile phones, as well as programming and building gaming maps and developing internet access via satellites.\n\nCronos again reformed Venom in around 2003, temporarily recruiting an unknown basic nu-metal drummer and guitarist, as he just needed a couple of average players to help him kick start the band while he looked for professional permanent musicians. Cronos had asked guitarist Mantas to rejoin the band, although he declined his offer releasing a statement on Blabbermouth saying he would never rejoin Venom as he was working in a new direction with his new band 'Zero Tolerance' and was in the process of recording an album. After Cronos spent the next couple of years of planning and intensive rehearsals, Venom released their album \"Metal Black\" in early 2006 on the Sanctuary Group label Castle Music, and they embarked on a sold out world tour. Venom played the classic single \"Die Hard\" along with Phil Anselmo (Pantera, Down) in the Gods of Metal 2006 in Italy, where they headlined. Cronos appeared on Dave Grohl's heavy metal side project Probot in 2004, and guest starred on the track Knights of the 21st Century on HammerFall's 2005 album \"\".\n\nBass guitars\n\n\nCronos also owns both Aria and Ibanez acoustic basses. He had two other basses which are seen on the DVD which comes with the deluxe version of Black Metal. These basses have been destroyed.\n\nCronos owns various 6 string guitars also which he plays to compose his songs with.\n\nAmplifiers\n\n\n\n\n"}

The site was surely revered as the home of local spirits before Buddhism arrived in the area. As in many Thai wats, Spirit Houses coexist happily with the newer Buddhist shrines. Elephants are part of the lore of Doi Chom Thong. Paw Kuhn Mangrai was said to have been following an elephant that had wandered off when he first came upon Doi Chom Thong, a solitary hill on the banks of the River Kok.\n\nThere is a \"Chedi\" or golden pagoda of \"Stupa\" located in the center of the wat. The Chedi is the focal point of the temple. The Chedi was constructed with a mixture of Bhu-kam (ancient Burma) and Lanna style. It is around 14 meters high, the lotus-petal base, the body, the bell, the top part of the Chedi were decorated with a gold foil.\n\nAccording to the \"Yonok Chronicle\", the \"That\" or \"Chedi\" originally was built in 940 during the reign of Phraya Ruen Kaew, Prince of Chiang Rai, to house the Lord Buddha's relics.\n\nThose relics were originally acquired by Prince Pangkaraj of Yonok Nakpan, who divided them into three parts for the three temples of Wat Phra That Doi Tung, Wat Phra That Chomkitti, and Wat Phra That Doi Chom Thong, respectively.\n\nLater, in 1260, King Mangrai was said to have visited Doi Chom Thong, where he viewed the surrounding area and found it suitable for the establishment of a city. He then ordered the beginning of the construction of the city of Chiang Rai and had Wat Phra That Doi Chom Thong restored.\n\nIn 1992 (B.E. 2535) the City Pillar was moved from Wat Klang Wiang to Doi Chom Thong, where it is known as Sadu Mueang (TH: สะดือเมือง), the Navel or Omphalos of the city.\n\n"}
{"id": "2251444", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2251444", "title": "Renault Estafette", "text": "Renault Estafette\n\nThe Renault Estafette was a light commercial front-wheel drive van, first introduced in 1959 and made by the French automaker Renault between 1959 and 1980, initially using the water-cooled Renault Ventoux engine, then later the Cléon-Fonte engine in a range of body styles. It was replaced by the Renault Trafic.\n\nFollowing the launch of the Estafette, Renault became the only auto-maker in the world to simultaneously produce and sell vehicles with all three of the drive train configurations commonly used, with the front engined front wheel drive Estafette, along with various rear engined rear wheel drive cars such as the Dauphine and the front engined rear wheel drive Frégate and the ageing Dauphinoise.\n\nIn the summer of 1944 the French Ministry of Industrial Production set out a prescriptive plan to make the most of scarce resources for the post war motor industry. It was headed by Paul-Marie Pons and so it was known as the \"Plan Pons.\" Under the Plan Pons, Peugeot, Renault and Chenard & Walcker were restricted to making vans for 1000–1400 kg while Citroën was to make small trucks for 2 and 3.5 tonnes. \n\nHowever, Pierre-Jules Boulanger at Citroen ignored the \"Plan Pons\" and went ahead with the design of the Citroën H Van, which launched in 1947. This unitary body with no separate frame design, with four-wheel independent suspension, and front-wheel drive, offered a powerful motor, capacity, and an exceptionally low loading floor. It was an immediate success, and continued in production to 1981.\n\nRenault obeyed the \"Plan Pons\" instructions and designed the 206 E1 following general pre-war design ideas. It had a fixed chassis onto which the van body was bolted and the body was made by fitting metal panels to a wooden frame. This old-fashioned method paid off in terms of the time it took to build and overall production costs, because at the time stamped body panels were relatively expensive and it also saved weight. In this period of material shortages Renault did the best they could and the 1000 kg as it became known was a success, but not on the scale of Citroen's H Series that was selling to small businesses such as shop keepers and tradesmen. It was for this reason that Renault decided to fill the gap between the 300 kg Renault Juvaquatre and the 1000 kg 206 E1.\n\nIt was clear that they needed a front-wheel-drive van, but the company had just signed up to a policy of rear-engined, rear-drive models with the 4cv and the Dauphine, then under development for 1957. The only example of a rear-engined van was the Volkswagen Type 2, and it did not offer load-space or a low floor to rival the Citroen. Reluctantly Fernand Picard, the designer of the 4cv, agreed to give the go-ahead to the team headed by Guy Grosset-Grange to try something new. As a question of production logic, they had to use existing Renault parts, and that meant the new engine being developed for the Dauphine, but adapting it for a front drive van was not simply a matter of moving it and turning it around, and therefore they had to match it to a new gearbox, which gave them the opportunity to choose gear ratios to suit the van's needs.\n\nThey also worried if the 845 cc engine would cope with a 600 kg payload, and they doubted it would have enough power or durability, until they heard of the German Gutbrod Atlas that was carrying 1000 kg using a tiny 622 cc engine. They brought one to France, and used it as a test bed for the 845 cc engine and were soon satisfied that it would work well. And so began over 2 million kilometres of testing.\n\nLaunched in June 1959, the new van was to be called the Estafette from the Italian Staffetta, meaning Courier. At launch, the engine, although mounted near the front of the Estafette, was of the same size and output as that fitted to the recently introduced Renault Dauphine. The Estafette's emphasis was always on economy and practicality rather than on power or heavy-duty performance.\n\nIt was introduced in four body types; the normal van with the rear door in three sections, in a variation on the stable door style. The upper part with the window hinged upwards, while the lower part was divided into two halves, opening to the left and to the right. A sliding door on the pavement side of the load space was also normally fitted, as was a sliding driver's door. There was a high roof version with translucent plastic roof that on its lower part was left unpainted and the top was normally white (though later models could be fully painted). The pickup version had a tubular frame to support the canopy which could easily be pushed forward and stored behind the cab which was closed off. The tailgate of this model could be used as a convenient loading ramp or be removed altogether. A minibus was also introduced seating eight passengers and the driver. Originally the Estafette was available only in four colours from the factory; grey, blue, yellow or orange.\n\nThe Estafette gave all it had promised, with its low floor and wide rear opening; the high roofed version were especially popular with companies having to load bulky items because although the 0.8cu metre increase in capacity didn't sound a lot, it did allow a man to stand inside to help load. And it was very popular as a mobile shop, which at markets became as typically French as the ice cream van is English.\n\nIn 1961 came the Alouette version which was a simpler version of the minibus with removable seats that could convert it into a camper van and was indeed popular with French conversion companies. Finally a chassis-cab version was introduced onto which innumerable bodies could be fitted.\n\nIn May 1962 the rated Estafette was the first vehicle to receive Renault's newly developed \"Sierra\" series water-cooled four-cylinder 1,108 cc five-bearing engine, which was destined to appear in a passenger car a month later with the launch, in June 1962, of the Renault 8.\n\nIn 1968 a series of 70 vans were issued to the police at the winter Olympics held in Grenoble, and this led to a long term contract, but Renault's biggest customer for the Estafette was PTT, the French telephone company. In 1968 it gained the 1,289 cc engine later seen in the Renault 12 to give a full 1000 kg capacity. In 1973 the grille was updated, with a plainer modern look. The Estafette continued in production until 1980 when it was replaced by the Trafic, having sold over 500,000 units.\nIn Romania, a version of the Estafette was produced for the Romanian Post between 1975 and 1978, by Automobile Dacia, in only 642 units (842 by other sources).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2251466", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2251466", "title": "Plaxton President", "text": "Plaxton President\n\nThe Plaxton President was a low floor double-decker bus body built at Northern Counties plant in Wigan, England and branded as a Plaxton product for its main production run. It was unveiled in 1997 and built between 1999 and 2005. When it became part of TransBus International, the body was sold under the TransBus name. The President was built on the Dennis/TransBus Trident, the DAF DB250 and the Volvo B7TL chassis. It can be built as either a closed top bus or an open-top bus.\n\nThe body was designed to compete with the Alexander ALX400 body, and had neat rectangular front headlights below a large front windscreen. From the side, it can be easily recognised by the different depths of windows on the lower deck; however, this is less apparent with newer bonded-glazed models. Seating varied according to the chassis and specification. TfL models were typically built with 41 seats upstairs, and 23 downstairs, with a centre exit door. Early TfL versions also had the staircase moved to the centre of the bus, although this was later changed to the standard position of just behind the driver.\n\nOutside London the Presidents are less common, however some operators did build up substantial numbers of them.\n\nLothian Buses were the largest operator of Presidents outside London with approximately 200 purchased from June 1999 to June 2004. Apart from seven examples on Volvo B7TL chassis Lothian's examples are all Dennis Tridents including some high capacity 11m examples. Since 2010 Lothian began withdrawing their earliest Presidents from frontline service. Some received open top conversion for Lothian's sightseeing subsidiaries and others have been sold on for further service with various other bus operators.\n\nNational Express West Midlands, formerly Travel West Midlands, were the second largest operator of Presidents outside London with 102 examples new from Autumn 1999 to Summer 2000 all of which have Volvo B7TL chassis and were internally refurbished in 2007-08. Recent deliveries to National Express West Midlands have seen some of these Presidents move mainly to the associated Xplore Dundee fleet or sold on to other bus operators.\n\nGo-Ahead Group companies outside London also bought Presidents in substantial numbers. Brighton & Hove took 36 on Dennis Trident 2 chassis purchased in March/April 2001. This was followed by Go North East who took 15 in November 2001 again on Dennis Trident chassis although 8 of these transferred to Go-Ahead's Oxford Bus Company subsidiary in 2006. Finally Southern Vectis purchased 7 Presidents on Volvo B7TL chassis in September/October 2002, albeit before they were taken over by Go-Ahead.\n\nStagecoach took over 40 low-height Presidents on Dennis Trident 2 chassis in the early/mid 2000s. These were originally allocated to the Cambus, Manchester and Oxfordshire subsidiaries - although they've since been transferred to other subsidiaries within Stagecoach. They were originally intended to have had Alexander ALX400 bodies - Stagecoach's standard double deck body, but were switched to Presidents due to quicker build times.\n\nEast Yorkshire Motor Services are another fairly major President fleet with 36 examples on Volvo B7TL chassis. 30 of these were for the main East Yorkshire fleet with the other 6 previously used by their Finglands subsidiary in Manchester. More recently East Yorkshire have also added to their President fleet with mid-life second hand examples from Go-Ahead London some of which was converted for open top operation and Training. From early 2018 EYMS have started to withdraw their older examples of the President along with Ex London examples, mostly being sold to other companies.\n\nSmaller orders include Arriva which purchased 20 on Volvo B7TL chassis for its Arriva Yorkshire subsidiary, the Blazefield Group who took 19, 16 for Burnley & Pendle and three for Yorkshire Coastliner, and independent based operators like Pete's Travel, Mayne Coaches, Blue Bus & Coach Services, Hedingham Omnibuses, North Birmingham Busways and Liverpool Motor Services. All of these companies have either ceased operations or been taken over by larger groups within the British bus industry.\n\nThe Mayflower Group, the parent company of TransBus International, went into administration in March 2004. It was bought out in May 2004 by a consortium including Brian Souter, the owner of the Stagecoach Group and was renamed Alexander Dennis. A programme of restructuring began within Alexander Dennis which, at the time, saw the Plaxton coach division divested and the TransBus product range rationalised. In turn a decision was taken to close the former Northern Counties plant in Wigan and phase out the President in favour of the Falkirk-built ALX400. The final Presidents were built at the Wigan plant in January 2005 and both it and the ALX400 would be phased out in favour of the semi-integral Alexander Dennis Enviro400 which took over from end of 2005. The Enviro400 has elements of the ALX400 and President in its design.\n\n"}

The venue's main room held 500, whilst the second room held 250, and the small upstairs room held 125.\n\nA regular competition run by promoters Futuresound (and sharing their name) gave unsigned bands from Yorkshire the chance to win a spot on the bill at the Leeds Festival.\n\nThe Cockpit was split into three live gig rooms with individual stages in each: The Cockpit (The Pit), Cockpit 2 (The Venue) and Cockpit 3 (The Upstairs). The venue had the ability to host 2 gigs on the same night, with a band in the main room using the second room as a bar, and a band in the upstairs using the main bar.\n\nThe venue played host to a variety of different bands playing a wide range of musical styles including rock, metal, hardcore, emo, punk, indie, alternative and folk. Four weekly club nights ran at the Cockpit - Slam Dunk on a Tuesday, Southern Fried on a Wednesday, Heavy Soul on a Friday and Garage on a Saturday.

It was fitted to Dennis Trident 3 and Volvo Super Olympian chassis (they could be distinguished by the rear indicators outside the engine compartment: round indicators for Dennis and square indicators for Volvo). This longer version of the ALX500 was popular with Citybus, Kowloon Motor Bus, Long Win Bus and New World First Bus in Hong Kong. Due to the climate, all of these ALX500s were fitted with air conditioning systems, and as a result lacked a rear window on the lower deck. The extra length of the buses meant the seating capacities were near the 100 mark for the 12.0 meters variant.\n\nAlexander built three prototype ALX500 bodies for prototype Trident 3 chassis in 1997, with the first finished in February 1997. Production of the ALX500 body was started later in the same year, but there were some minor changes in appearance; for example, the exit door was moved rearward (for 12.0m variant only).

The paper gradually began to develop its unique editorial policy, most notably in covering topics that were banned in popular daily newspapers, but tolerated by Communist government in less-read weeklies. Even that, \"Nedjeljna Dalmacija\" suffered because of purges following Croatian Spring and had to resort to hiring reporters and columnists from other Yugoslav republics. The best known was Serbian journalist Aleksandar Tijanić, ironically nicknamed the \"Giant of Croatian Journalism\".\n\n\"Nedjeljna Dalmacija\" reached its zenith in the late 1980s, when it was among first Yugoslav newspapers to break certain taboos, like reporting about exploitation of prisoners or publish scripts from the banned film \"\". The newspaper also featured a humour section run by the trio that would later become famous as \"Feral Tribune\".\n\nThe arrival of multi-party democracy in 1990 witnessed a gradual shift of editorial policy. While \"Slobodna Dalmacija\" became more open to various political options, \"Nedjeljna Dalmacija\" shifted rightwards and embraced Croatian nationalism. This process was completed with 1993 takeover of \"Slobodna Dalmacija\" by Miroslav Kutle and change of editorial policy towards even more hardline nationalism. \"Nedjeljna Dalmacija\" was, just like \"Slobodna Dalmacija\", owned by Kutle and suffered from poor management, economic woes of war-torn Dalmatia and loss of readership to new and more attractive weekly newspapers like \"Slobodni tjednik\", \"Globus\", \"Nacional\" and \"Feral Tribune\". In the late 1990s editorial offices were, for financial reasons, moved from Split to Zagreb, but this could not prevent \"Nedjeljna Dalmacija\" from being extinguished.\n"}

She will play Mulan in The Walt Disney Company's live-action film \"Mulan\".\n\nLiu was born in Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, Hubei and her birth name was \"An Feng\". She is an only child. Her father is An Shaokang (), a 1st Secretary in the Chinese Embassy in France and a French language university professor, while her mother is Liu Xiaoli (), a dancer and a stage performer. Her parents divorced when she was 10 years old and she was raised solely by her mother. That same year, she adopted her mother's family name and changed her name to \"Liu Ximeizi\" () and began modelling, along with training in singing, dancing and playing the piano. Her godfather is Chen Jinfei (), the Chairman of Beijing Tongchan Investment Group.\n\nWhen she was 10 years old, Liu and her mother moved to New York City, where she attended Louis Pasteur Middle School 67. She lived in Queens before returning to China in 2002 to pursue an acting career and changed her name to \"Liu Yifei\" (). While living in the United States, she gained her United States citizenship. Several weeks later after returning to China, Liu was accepted into the Performance Institute of Beijing Film Academy at the age of 15, and graduated in 2006.\n\nImmediately after her admittance into the Beijing Film Academy, Liu received offers to star in various television series. Her first television appearance was in the period romance drama \"The Story of a Noble Family\" (2003), based on Zhang Henshui's novel of the same name. The series achieved the highest ratings on CCTV, and positive reviews from audience.

The drama earned a cult following, and solidified her popularity in China.\n\nIn 2006, Liu was chosen to portray Xiaolongnü in \"The Return of the Condor Heroes\", based on Louis Cha's wuxia novel of the same title. Liu's casting was backed by Cha himself, who felt that she had all the necessary qualities to portray the young and innocent female protagonist. After the drama aired, Liu gained acclaim for her performance and swiftly experienced a surge in popularity. The same year, she was chosen as the \"Golden Eagle Goddess\" at the 6th China Golden Eagle TV Art Festival.\n\nAfter achieving success in television, Liu then ventured onto the big screen. In 2007, she joined William Morris Agency (WMA) and was subsequently cast in her first Hollywood production, \"The Forbidden Kingdom\". She played Golden Sparrow, an orphan seeking revenge against her parents' killer. Thereafter, she starred in romantic-comedy \"Love in Disguise\" (2010) opposite Taiwanese singer-actor Wang Leehom.\n\nIn 2011, she starred in fantasy supernatural film \"A Chinese Ghost Story\", adapted from \"Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio\"; The same year, she was cast as Wu Qing (Emotionless) in Gordon Chan's wuxia film \"The Four\", adapted from Woon Swee Oan's novel series \"The Four Great Constables\".

The image included a quote from Chinese reporter Fu Guohao who worked for the \"Global Times\" and was subsequently assaulted by protesters during the 2019 Hong Kong anti-extradition bill protests: \"I support Hong Kong police. You can beat me now. What a shame for Hong Kong.\" This sparked international controversy, with Liu being accused of supporting police brutality. The hashtag, #BoycottMulan, has since started trending supporting a boycott of the movie. In response to the controversy, Liu was not present at the 2019 D23 Expo, which gave fans an exclusive sneak peek of \"Mulan\". When asked about the controversy in February 2020, Liu stated: \"I think it's just a very sensitive situation.\"\n\nDuring the interview with Variety magazine at the premiere of \"Mulan\" on March 10, 2020, Liu described herself as \"Asian\" instead of “Chinese”, which caused anger among Chinese netizens, accusing her of forgetting her roots and threatening to boycott the film.\n\nLiu signed with Sony Music Entertainment Japan in 2005.

The airport is located in the district of Tveit in the Oddernes borough, about by road and by air from the city center of Kristiansand. Operated by the state-owned Avinor, it is the sole airport in Southern Norway with scheduled flights. Kjevik has a runway aligned 03/21 and served 1,061,130 passengers in 2018. Scheduled flights are provided by Scandinavian Airlines, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Widerøe, KLM Cityhopper and Wizz Air. The Royal Norwegian Air Force has a training center at the airport.\n\nKjevik opened on 1 June 1939, as the joint second airport in the country. During the Second World War it was occupied and expanded by the Luftwaffe. Kristiansand's southerly location caused the airport to receive several international routes during the early years, as well as domestic services. Braathens SAFE served domestic services from 1955 to its demise in 2004. KLM flew until 1971, after which Dan-Air opened routes to the United Kingdom. The terminal received major extensions in 1955, 1979, 1994 and 2015. New control towers were built in 1966 and 2013. Kjevik was the base for Sørfly from 1946 to 1962, for Agderfly from 1969 to 2004, and for FlyNonstop in 2013.\n\nThe first airport in Kristiansand was a water aerodrome situated in the city center. It was built by the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service in 1918. A government commission recommended on 21 October 1920 that Kristiansand receive a water airport as part of a nationwide investment program. However, nothing came of the plans for more than a decade. Moving of the military water aerodrome was proposed several times, although this was never carried out before the construction of Kjevik.\n\nLocally the initiative for an airport in Kristiansand was launched by Mayor Andreas Kjær in 1933. The city council sent a formal application to the government in August 1934 asking for an airport. That summer Widerøe commenced flights to Kristiansand along a coastal route from Oslo to Haugesund. Norwegian Air Lines (DNL) commenced a coastal seaplane route along the southern coast from Oslo to Bergen via Kristiansand on 9 June 1935. This service used an aerodrome at Kongsgårdbukta.\n\nThe government stated in 1935 that it planned on building a main airport for Agder – Kristiansand, Mandal and Arendal were all proposed as suitable hosts. The government concluded that Kristiansand was the most suitable, based on traffic, military and financial considerations. Several locations were considered. Kongsgårdbakken was selected, costing 2 million Norwegian krone (NOK) less than Kjevik. The municipality and the state formalized construction in April 1936, where the former would provide the land and the construction costs of NOK 2.4 million would be split. Construction commenced soon afterwards.\n\nMeanwhile, a group started looking at Kjevik as a suitable site, led by aviator Bernt Balchen, industrialist Rolf Petersen and Lawyer Hartmann. They presented detailed plans and agreed prices for purchase of lands. Based on this Kristiansand Municipal Council accepted on 5 August 1936 to reconsider Kjevik. Kjevik was passed in the council on 30 September 1937 with 34 against 26 votes. Construction commenced in November and was contracted to Høyer-Ellefsen. The same year the Norwegian Army Air Service used the fields at Kjevik for training.\n\nThe airport originally consisted of a concrete runway connected to the apron with a wide taxiway. A small, wooden terminal building was built of a shed and a nearby residential house was used as a restaurant. Seaplanes were served with a floating dock and a slipway. Kjevik opened on 1 June 1939, the same day as Oslo Airport, Fornebu. The first aircraft to land was a Douglas DC-2 of KLM. They started an international route from Oslo via Kristiansand to Amsterdam, while Danish Air Lines operated to Copenhagen. DNL opened a domestic seaplane route from Oslo via Kristiansand to Stavanger Airport, Sola.\n\nKjevik was captured by the Luftwaffe during the German invasion on 9 April 1940. The first aircraft landed at Kjevik as an emergency landing on the first day of the invasion. Later it was used by Junkers Ju 52 transport aircraft, flying in troops. From 11 April a squadron of Messerschmitt Bf 109s were stationed at Kjevik.\n\nLuftwaffe immediately started upgrading the aerodrome. They began by removing a hill at the east end of the runway, followed by an extension of the runway. Tveit was transformed with military structures built throughout the village. In the east a minefield was laid and several fuel tanks were built around the airfield. Two large hangars were built, along with a large number of sheds. In the course of the war the runway was extended to . The German military planned a large expansion of the airport from 1945, which would have included new aprons and would have obliterated the village. These plans were halted by the end of the war.\n\nKjevik was taken over by the Royal Air Force in May 1945. They started the work of mine sweeping and disarming the armaments and general clean-up of the aerodrome. It was later transferred to civilian use. The Air Force's Aircraft-Technical School and the Weapon-Technical School moved to Kjevik in February 1946. The latter moved to Lista Air Station two years later.\n\nThe upgraded facilities resulted in Kristiansand Municipality wanted to rid itself of the responsibility and cost of running the airport. The city council passed a resolution of 9 December 1946 offering the airport free of charge to the state. This was approved by Parliament on 20 June 1947. The same year the aviation club Kjevik Flyklubb was established.\n\nOn 6 March 1946 KLM resumed its route, flying from Oslo via Kristiansand to Amsterdam using a Douglas DC-3. By 1950 it was flown three times a week, and continued onwards to Brussels. DNL, through the Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) cooperation started an international route on 2 October 1946 from Oslo via Kristiansand, Amsterdam and Brussels to Paris. Four days later a domestic Ju 52 seaplane route from Kristiansand to Stavanger, Haugesund and Bergen. Danish Air Lines introduced a route from Kjevik to Aalborg and Copenhagen in 1947.\n\nDNL started a land plane route from Kristiansand to Stavanger in 1947, but withdrew two years later, using a Douglas DC-3. From 1949 KLM took over flights from Oslo to Kristiansand. Braathens SAFE was awarded the route in 1950, along with an extension to Copenhagen, but abandoned it the following year. The terminal building was expanded in 1953, receiving a new waiting room and a new cafeteria.\n\nSørfly—the first airline based in Agder—was established in 1946. It operated out of Kjevik, originally with the Auster Autocrats. They performed various general aviation tasks, including sight-seeing, charter flights for hunters, especially to Setesdal and aerial photography. A Republic Seabee and a Miles Gemini were delivered in 1947 and 1948. The airline launched a scheduled route from Stavanger and Kristiansand via Ålborg to Gothenburg. The airline's hangar at Kjevik collapsed in 1954 and the Seabee sold in 1956. From then the airline had less and less activity and liquidated in 1962.\n\nBraathens resumed traffic on 6 June 1955 when it opened a route from Oslo via Tønsberg, Kristiansand and Farsund to Stavanger, with a daily round trip on a de Havilland Heron. These were replaced with the larger Fokker F27 Friendship in 1959. The route served 2,593 passengers the first year, increasing to 17,900 in 1960. Braathens opened a route from Kristiansand to Ålborg in 1960, although this was taken over by SAS the following year. That year the airport had 54,306 passengers.\n\nKLM introduced the Vickers Viscount on the Kjevik route in 1957 and three years later started using the Lockheed L-188 Electra. The Weapon Technical School moved back to Kjevik in 1963. During the late 1950s and 1960s SAS switched its Kristiansand services first to the Saab Scandia and then the Convair CV-440 Metropolitan. Dan-Air introduced summer services to Newcastle-upon-Tyne from 1963, expanded to an all-year service from 1972.\nNew aircraft resulted in the need for a longer runway. The city and the state made an agreement whereby the former would pay for the land while the latter would pay for the construction. The runway was extended to in 1966. On 2 November a new, tall control tower opened. The airport had 143,585 passengers in 1965.\n\nAgderfly was established at Kjevik in 1969. The company operated a wide range of aircraft, focusing until the 1980s exclusively as a flying school. KLM introduced the Douglas DC-9 on the Amsterdam route from 1966. However, the stopped serving Kristiansand from November 1971, when the stop was moved to Gothenburg. Braathens introduced the Fokker F28 Fellowship from 1969 and the Boeing 737-200 from 1975.\n\nThe airport served 203,875 passengers in 1970, which increased to 295,578 five years later. A parachute club, Kjevik Fallskjermklubb, was founded in 1974. Dan-Air introduced a service to London in 1976. The Air Force's Communication- and Radar School moved to Kjevik in 1977. SAS used the DC-9 for its international route for a period during the 1970s, but as these proved too large later switched to the smaller F27.\n\nKristiansand was one of six test airports which received a British doppler microwave landing system in 1977. In the late 1970s the terminal was too small, resulting in the airport opening a new terminal on 22 March 1979, costing NOK 19 million. The terminal from the war had been used for domestic services and was converted to cargo terminal. The international terminal was converted to a terminal for the Air Force. Kjevik served 400,549 passengers in 1980, increasing to 477,549 five years later.\n\nKristiansand-based Agderfly introduced services to Göteborg Landvetter Airport on 26 September 1989, followed by a Billund Airport route on 2 October. Two years later they received permission to fly to Bremen Airport, but ultimately shut down on 21 November 1991. The flight school continued to operate. SAS was reorganized in 1990 and the Copenhagen routes were taken over by SAS Commuter's Eurolink service with new Fokker 50 aircraft. Norsk Air introduced a service from Sandefjord Airport, Torp via Kristiansand to London Stansted Airport on 28 October 1991. The route had insufficient traffic and was terminated the following year. The airport served 578,373 passengers in 1990, which increased to 745,061 passengers five years later.\nBusy Bee went bankrupt in 1992 and their routes to Stavanger and Bergen were taken over by Norwegian Air Shuttle. Following SAS terminating the Copenhagen service on 26 March 1994, Maersk Air introduced three daily flights to Copenhagen. That year the terminal was rebuilt and expanded with another . Most of this was expansion of the public areas, including a new baggage area. SAS commenced domestic services from Kjevik on 8 October 1998 when Oslo Airport, Gardermoen opened. This waived the need for landing slots which had limited capacity at Fornebu, allowing for free competition on the route. KLM returned to Kristiansand on 28 March 1999, introducing flights to Amsterdam using a Fokker 50 three times per day. By 2000 Maersk Air had replaced its F50s with jet aircraft on the Copenhagen route. The airport's patronage peaked at 902,295 in 1999, after which the ridership fell and did not recoup until 2011.\nFollowing the SAS Group purchase of Braathens in 2002, SAS closed its Kristiansand to Oslo route on 2 April. Also as a result of the merger, SAS Commuter took over Norwegian's routes to Stavanger and Bergen on 1 April 2003. The same year SAS resumed its route to Copenhagen, matching Maersk Air with three daily flights. The following year Maersk Air introduced flights to Billund Airport in Denmark. The airline ceased operations the following year. Braathens merged into SAS Braathens in 2004, and resumed as Scandinavian Airlines from 2007. Norwegian returned to Kjevik in 2007 as a low-cost carrier with three weekly flights to London Stansted Airport. However, the route proved to have too little patronage and was closed within the year. However, they introduced three daily flights to Oslo from 5 June 2008, adding to the four daily flights flown by SAS. Widerøe took over SAS Commuters flights to Bergen and Stavanger in 2010.\n\nAvinor installed a long section of engineered materials arrestor system at the end of each runway in 2012. Kjevik is the only airport in Norway with this system, as the proximity to vulnerable marine environment prohibits the creation of a conventional safety zone around the runways. The south end was installed in July and the north end later in the year. The installations cost between 70 and 80 million Norwegian krone. The control tower from 1966 was not sufficiently high to give the air traffic controllers full view of the runway. A new tall control tower was therefore opened on 3 June 2013.\nFlyNonstop was established as a Kjevik-based airline and commenced flights on 25 April 2013. They flew to ten sun and city holiday destinations using an Embraer 190 operated by Denim Air. With insufficient passenger load factor, they went bankrupt on 29 October. Wizz Air started a route to Gdańsk using an Airbus A320 in May 2013, mostly targeting the Polish expatriate community.\n\nConstruction of a new international terminal commenced in 2014, scheduled for opening in June 2015. It will consist of a extension of the terminal northwards. It will feature four new gates, of which two can be used for flights out of the Schengen Area. The baggage hall and duty-free shop will be expanded.\nKristiansand Airport, Kjevik is situated on the grounds of the farm Kjevik at Tveit in Kristiansand, Norway. The asphalt runway physically measures and is numbered 03/21. In addition it features a engineered materials arrestor system at each end. The runway has a declared take-off run available of on runways 03/21, respectively. The landing distances available are , respectively.\n\nThe aerodromes reference altitude is above mean sea level. Kjevik has a category I instrument landing system in both directions, both which are equipped with precision approach path indicator. The airport has a category 7 fire and rescue service. The apron is connected to the runway via three taxiways, although none of these run parallel to the runway.\n\nThe check-in area consists of automated and manned check-in stands, five car rental agencies and a Deli de Luca kiosk. The departure hall features a kiosk from the same chain and a duty free store. The latter also serves arriving international passengers. The airport has six gates, numbered 1 through 7. The first three can be used for international flights, with gate 3 able to also handle domestic flights, when it is numbered 4. The last three only handle domestic flights. None of the gates have jetbridges. Ground handling is provided by Aviator and SAS Ground Handling, while aviation fuel is provided by Shell.\n\nThe busiest route from Kristiansand is to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. It is flown six times daily by SAS and four times daily by Norwegian using Boeing 737s. Other domestic routes are flown by Widerøe to Stavanger, Bergen and Trondheim. KLM Cityhopper flies twice daily to Amsterdam and Widerøe flies thrice daily to Copenhagen. SAS flies once per week during the summer to Alicante and Wizz Air flies twice weekly to Gdańsk.\n\nKristiansand Airport, Kjevik is the ninth-busiest airport in Norway. It served 1,061,130 passengers in 2018, of which 297,106 were international passengers. In 2018, the airport also saw 19,290 aircraft movements. Kjevik's catchment area covers Agder and is the only scheduled airport in the twin counties. For international flights, Kjevik experiences a leakage in western Vest-Agder to Stavanger Airport, Sola, and in Aust-Agder a leakage to Sandefjord Airport, Torp. These both have significantly more international services than Kjevik. Kjevik has significantly lower traffic than other airports in Norway covering similarly sized populations. A contributing factor is the well-established bus and train services to the capital.\n\nThe airport is situated by road from the city center. National Road 451 runs along the northern side of the runway and connects to National Road 41. It connects to the E18 freeway. The airport features parking for 1,800 cars. Car rental is also available.\n\nHaga Buss operates an airport coach to Kristiansand. Nettbuss operates a coach service to Lillesand, Grimstad and Arendal. This is a direct service during rush hour and a shuttle service from a stop on the E18 the rest of the day. Agder Flyekspress operates a direct coach service to Arendal. Taxis are available at the airport.\n\n"}

Xerez currently plays in Tercera Division, the fourth tier of Spanish football.\n\nFounded on 24 September 1947, The club's biggest success came in 2009, when they managed to play in La Liga for the first time for the 2009-10 season. Xerez finished in last place however, and was relegated. After several seasons of financial problems, the team was eventually relegated all the way to the fifth tier by 2016.\n\nTeam colours are usually blue shirt and socks, and white shorts.\n\nDue to the link between Jerez de la Frontera and the United Kingdom created by the exports of sherry (\"Jerez\" in Spanish), football had its beginnings in the region towards the second half of the 19th century. In the early 20th century Sir Thomas Spencer, who worked with the William & Humbert winery, founded \"Sociedad Jerez Foot-Ball Club\" – he also served as chairman, player and captain.\n\nFrom 1942 to 1947 the club had several names, ending with \"Jerez Club Deportivo\", which was changed to the current name in 1960s. Xerez first reached the second division in 1953–54, remaining there for five years; previously, in the 1940s, the team had promoted on the field but, due to the \"high national interest\" of the dictatorial government, left its position to España de Tánger.\nThe team's new stadium, \"Estadio Municipal de Chapín\", was inaugurated on 10 July 1988, replacing the old \"Estadio Domecq\" – the first match there was a friendly against Real Madrid. After decades in that category and also in the third, it had a 2001–02 second level campaign which almost resulted in an historic La Liga promotion, only one year after doing the same thing; the club seemed certain to gain promotion all season, but ultimately failed after a dramatic loss of form towards its closure, only gaining four points in the last eight matches.\n\nSince then, Xerez finished in the top 10 in division two each campaign, except in the 2007–08 season when a weak start led to a 15th-place finish. The following campaign proved excellent, as the club was always in the top positions: on 13 June 2009, after beating SD Huesca 2–1 at home, it achieved promotion to the top division for the first time in its history. In the final day of the competition, a draw at Celta de Vigo proved enough for the title, as CD Tenerife lost 1–2 home to CD Castellón in the final minute.\n\nThe first season of Xerez in the top flight would be short-lived, as it ended in relegation. After only collecting seven points from the first 19 games – which led to the sacking of coach José Ángel Ziganda – the club amassed 27 in the remaining 19 with Néstor Gorosito as boss, not good enough however to prevent the drop as last (the club, however, had chances to stay up until the final round, a 1–1 draw at CA Osasuna).\n\nXerez ranked eighth and 14th in the two following second level seasons, respectively. The 2012–13 campaign, however, was disastrous on all levels, as the team finished in 22nd and last position as a direct consequence of enduring serious financial difficulties for several years, and the situation culminated with the club being relegated to the fourth division on 1 August.\n\nAfter the Xerez's season, a group of supporters founded a new club in the lower leagues, named \"Xerez Deportivo FC\" due to the club's institutional problems. While the latter was promoted to \"Primera Provincial\", the former was again relegated, this time to \"Primera Andaluza\", until May 2017, when Xerez came back to Tercera División. They managed a 16th place finish in the 2017-18 season, avoiding relegation and managing another season in the Spanish fourth tier. The following season, Xerez improved and managed a 10th place finish. \n\"Xerez Fútbol Club\" - \"(1907–46)\" → ↓\n\"Club Deportivo Jerez\" - \"(1942–46)\" → ↑\n\n\n\nNote: this list includes players that have played in at least 100 league games and/or have reached international status. \n\nFounded in 1975, Xerez CD B was disestablished in 2015.\nOn 16 August 2016, Xerez CD created the basketball section of the club. It currently plays in the fifth division.\n\n"}

With metals such as sodium and calcium, its salts are known as alginates. It is a significant component of the biofilms produced by the bacterium \"Pseudomonas aeruginosa\", a major pathogen found in the lungs of some people who have cystic fibrosis. The biofilm and \"P. aeruginosa\" have a high resistance to antibiotics, and are susceptible to inhibition by macrophages. Its colour ranges from white to yellowish-brown. It is sold in filamentous, granular, or powdered forms.\n\nAlginic acid is a linear copolymer with homopolymeric blocks of (1-4)-linked β-D-mannuronate (M) and its C-5 epimer α-L-guluronate (G) residues, respectively, covalently linked together in different sequences or blocks. The monomers may appear in homopolymeric blocks of consecutive G-residues (G-blocks), consecutive M-residues (M-blocks) or alternating M and G-residues (MG-blocks).\n\nAlginates are refined from brown seaweeds. A wide variety of brown seaweeds of the class Phaeophyceae are harvested throughout the world to be converted into the raw material commonly known as sodium alginate. Sodium alginate has a wide use across a wide variety of industries including food, textile printing, and pharmaceutical. Dental impression material uses alginate as its means of gelling. Alginate is safe as an ingredient in manufactured foods.\n\nSeaweeds may be classified into three broad groups based on pigmentation: brown, red, and green. These broad groups are the Phaeophyceae, Rhodophyceae, and Chlorophyceae, respectively. Brown seaweeds usually are large, and range from the giant kelp \"Macrocystis pyrifera\" that is often 20 m long, to thick, leather-like seaweeds from 2–4 m long, to smaller species 30–60 cm long. None of the usual seaweeds for alginate production are cultivated. They cannot be grown by vegetative means, but must go through a reproductive cycle involving an alternation of generations. This makes cultivated brown seaweeds too expensive when compared to the costs of harvesting and transporting wild seaweeds. The only exception is for \"Laminaria japonica\", which is cultivated in China for food and its surplus material is diverted to the alginate industry in China.\n\nAlginates from different species of brown seaweed often have variations in their chemical structure, resulting in different physical properties. For example, some may yield an alginate that gives a strong gel, another a weaker gel, some may readily give a cream or white alginate, while others are difficult to gel and are best used for technical applications where color does not matter.\n\nCommercial varieties of alginate are extracted from seaweed, including the giant kelp \"Macrocystis pyrifera\", \"Ascophyllum nodosum\", and various types of \"Laminaria\". It also is produced by two bacterial genera \"Pseudomonas\" and \"Azotobacter\", which played a major role in the unravelling of its biosynthesis pathway. Bacterial alginates are useful for the production of micro- or nanostructures suitable for medical applications.\n\nSodium alginate is the sodium salt of alginic acid. Its empirical formula is NaCHO. Sodium alginate is a gum, extracted from the cell walls of brown algae.\n\nPotassium alginate is a chemical compound that is the potassium salt of alginic acid. It is an extract of seaweed. Its empirical chemical formula is KCHO.\n\nCalcium alginate, made from sodium alginate from which the sodium ion has been removed and replaced with calcium, has the chemical formula CHCaO.\n\nThe processes for the manufacture of sodium alginate from brown seaweeds fall into two categories: 1) Calcium alginate method and, 2) Alginic acid method. The chemistry of the processes used to extract sodium alginate from brown seaweeds is relatively simple. The difficulties of the processes arise from the physical separations that are required, such as the need to filter slimy residues from viscous solutions or to separate gelatinous precipitates that hold large amounts of liquid within the structure and thereby resist filtration and centrifugation.\n\nAlginate absorbs water quickly, which makes it useful as an additive in dehydrated products such as slimming aids, and in the manufacture of paper and textiles. It also is used for waterproofing and fireproofing fabrics, in the food industry as a thickening agent for drinks, ice cream, cosmetics, and as a gelling agent for jellies.\n\nAlginate is used as an ingredient in various pharmaceutical preparations, such as Gaviscon, in which it combines with bicarbonate to inhibit reflux. Sodium alginate is used as an impression-making material in dentistry, prosthetics, lifecasting, and for creating positives for small-scale casting.\n\nSodium alginate is used in reactive dye printing and as a thickener for reactive dyes in textile screen-printing. Alginates do not react with these dyes and wash out easily, unlike starch-based thickeners.\n\nAs a material for micro-encapsulation.\n\nCalcium alginate is used in different types of medical products, including skin wound dressings to promote healing, and may be removed with less pain than conventional dressings.\n\nAlginate may be used in a hydrogel consisting of microparticles or bulk gels combined with nerve growth factor in bioengineering research to stimulate brain tissue for possible regeneration. In research on bone reconstruction, alginate composites have favorable properties encouraging regeneration, such as improved porosity, cell proliferation, and mechanical strength, among other factors.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2251571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2251571", "title": "Penultima", "text": "Penultima\n\nPenultima is a game of inductive logic, played on a chess board. It was invented by Michael Greene and Adam Chalcraft in Cambridge in 1994. The game is derived from the chess variant Ultima (otherwise known as \"Baroque chess\"), and played with a standard chess board and pieces, each piece having different movement and capture rules from standard chess. In a manner similar to the game Mao, which was a popular game in Cambridge at that time, the rules for each piece vary from game to game, and are initially kept secret from the players. Penultima is similar in style to Eleusis, Zendo and Mao. The name of the game is a pun on \"penultimate\", and \"Ultima\", the name of the chess variant.\n\nSeveral \"Spectators\" create secret rules which govern how the pieces move and two \"Players\" attempt to discover these rules. The game is traditionally played with chess pieces but may be played with any sufficiently distinct components, such as coins or Icehouse pieces.\n\nBefore the game starts, the \"Spectators\" decide between themselves which pieces they will write rules for. The secret rule for a piece may for example control the way that piece moves, captures, or is captured, and may cause it to affect other pieces on the board. A piece may be given an \"invoke\" command which causes it to affect other pieces on the board without moving. When he has written the secret rule for a piece, the \"Spectator\" also gives it a new name for the duration of the game. These names, and the existence of any invoke commands, are announced to the players at the start of the game. During the game the spectators may privately discuss how their rules interact.\n\nOn their turn, a \"Player\" attempts to move or invoke one of their pieces, and the \"Spectator\" for that piece declares whether the action is legal or illegal. If it is legal, the movement or invocation is done, then that \"Player's\" turn ends and play passes to the other \"Player\". If it is illegal, the piece is returned to its position at the start of the turn. In the original game, play then passes to the other \"Player\"; in other variants the original \"Player\" continues making attempts until he succeeds in making a legal move or invoke. If the player is in \"check\", they can repeatedly attempt moves until able to get out of check.\n\nAs in standard chess, the winning player is the one who forces his or her opponent's king (or equivalent piece) into checkmate. At the end of the game, the \"Spectators\" reveal their rules.\n\n\n"}

They are subdivisions of the provinces, which in turn are subdivisions of the larger regions or departments. There are 1,838 districts in total.\n\nA 1982 law requires a minimum of residents in an area for a new district to be legally established: 3,500 if it is located in the rainforest, 4,000 in the Andes highlands and 10,000 in the coastal area.\n\nIn the dry Andean area, many districts have less than 3,500 inhabitants due to low population density in the area. In some cases, their populations have decreased in comparison to the days when they were founded. Districts that are located at very high altitudes tend to be scarcely populated. These districts usually are large in area, have few available land for use. Many basic government services do not reach all residents of these districts due to their difficult geography. Many lack financial means to govern their whole jurisdictions and they often have high emigration rates.\n\nA similar pattern can be observed in many districts located in the Peruvian Amazon rainforest. Once important settlements created during the era of colonization, they nowadays do not offer much space for agriculture. Deeper into the jungle, the districts of the 'selva alta' (lower jungle) have higher populations living on geographically large districts. Districts located outside the colonized area have very low populations that are entirely composed of Native Amazonian tribes.\n\nAll over the country, many districts have higher populations than the minimum required by law. This is true of the colonized areas of the rainforest, the northern Andes as well as in the southern Andes from Huancayo to the shores of Lake Titicaca, which is the historical heartland of the Peruvian highlands. These districts are old and tend to be smaller in area with high population densities since prehispanic times.\n\nDistricts in the Chala (coastal area) tend to be mid-sized except in low-density areas such as the Sechura Desert and part of the Southern coast, but all of them feature large populations due to emigration from other regions of the country that turned the Peruvian coast into the country's main economic powerhouse.\n\nDistricts with a population of more than 10 000 inhabitants should ideally be subdivided, particularly if they are also large in area, as is the case in part of the Amazon rainforest. Colonization happens quickly and boundaries of districts are often not modified, except in large urban areas. This is less of a problem in the coast where communication is easier. However, reaching to large populations remain a problem in this area.\n\nThis is a list of the top twenty Peruvian districts by population, population density, area and elevation (of the district's capital).\n\nSource: INEI\n\nSource: INEI\n\nSource: INEI\n\nSource: INEI\n\n"}

It is well known for its octagonal dome and striking frontage. Originally intended as a Palm Court for hosting Tea Dances, Balls and Civic functions, the Pavilion is a very versatile venue.\n\nConstruction of the Grand Pavilion commenced in the summer of 1931. The use of ferrocrete throughout meant that the construction was relatively quick and was complete by August 1932. At the time, the use of ferrocrete was a relatively new technology and remarkably 75 years on, it has stood the test of time.\n\nThe Grand Pavilion hosts a wide variety of events throughout the year including live theatre, concerts, ballroom dancing, conferences, dances, and culminating in the ever-popular Christmas pantomime. Recently, names such as Rob Brydon, Eddie Izzard, Elkie Brooks, Cerys Matthews, Hayley Westenra, Katherine Jenkins, Suzi Quatro, Ralph McTell, Joe Pasquale, and Gerry & The Pacemakers have all appeared on the Pavilion's stage. In 1957 a US Government travel ban prevented Paul Robeson from appearing in person at the Miners' Eisteddfod, however he still performed live via a secretly arranged transatlantic telephone link up. 50 years on, in 2007, the Grand Pavilion celebrated this important event with a very special concert featuring Sir Willard White. \n\nThe Grand Pavilion is also a versatile and unique conference venue, hosting many corporate and charity conferences and meetings throughout the year.

They also participated in 26 Segunda División seasons (a spell in the 1950s, and most of the 1990s and 2000s), spending the rest of their history competing at lower levels.\n\nThe team plays in claret and blue shirts with blue shorts (originating from the kit of FC Barcelona) and holds home games at the Ipurua Municipal Stadium. SD Eibar is a fan-owned club, with about 8,000 shareholders from 48 countries. Until SD Huesca qualified for the top flight in 2018, the club was considered the smallest to have played in Spain's top division, and its stadium had the lowest capacity of any La Liga teams. Although Eibar is the sole professional club of its town, it contests several Basque derbies with other clubs from the region.\n\nEibar is the only football club which has the quality certificate UNE-EN-ISO 9001.\n\nFormed by the merger of \"Deportivo Gallo\" and \"Unión Deportiva Eibarresa\", the club was originally known as \"Eibar Fútbol Club\", before changing to \"Sociedad Deportiva Eibar\". During the difficult postwar years, the team played sporadically, which caused Eibar to disappear from official competitions during the 1942-43 season. Originally an irregular team, it was not until the 1943–44 season that it was reorganised into more of a full-time unit.\n\nPromoted to Tercera División in 1950, Eibar achieved promotion to Segunda División three seasons later, being relegated again after a five-year stint and competing in division three for 25 of the following 28 years (in 1977 \"Tercera\" became the fourth level, after the creation of Segunda División B). In 1988, the side returned to the \"silver category\". That season also included a historic moment when goalkeeper José Ignacio Garmendia scored a goal in a game against Pontevedra via a kickout from his own area.\n\nAfter spending 18 years in a row in Segunda División, Eibar was relegated to the third division at the end of the 2005–06 campaign. However, it won its group the next season, thereby qualifying for the promotion play-offs where it won its semi-final tie against Hospitalet 2–0 and defeated Rayo Vallecano 2–1 on aggregate in the decisive round, sealing its return after just one year. Eibar finished 21st in the 2008–09 season meaning they were relegated to the Segunda Division B.\n\nEibar qualified for three straight promotion play-offs but could not get promoted to the Segunda División.\n\nIn the 2012–13 edition of the Copa del Rey, Eibar ousted Basque neighbours Athletic Bilbao – who had appeared in two of the last four finals in the tournament – on the away goals rule to reach the round-of-16 following a 1–1 draw at the San Mamés Stadium. The decisive goal was scored by Mikel Arruabarrena who played youth football with the opposition, as did manager Gaizka Garitano; the same season the team managed to return to the \"silver category\", following a four-year absence.\n\nIn 2013–14 Eibar earned, for the first time in its history, one of two direct promotion berths to La Liga, which was certified on 25 May 2014 with a 1–0 home win against Deportivo Alavés. (they celebrated their feat with confetti originally produced by Barcelona, who wear the same colours and had anticipated winning the Spanish league title a week earlier, but that did not come to pass). Simultaneously, however, the club was threatened with relegation back to division three due to the financial inability of the S.A.D. to have a share capital of at least €2,146,525.95 before 6 August 2014. The club launched a campaign named \"Defiende al Eibar\" (Defend Eibar) with the aim of reaching the required share capital through a seasoned equity offering. On 15 July 2014 the club announced it had reached the established goal.\n\nEibar finished its first top-flight season in 18th, ending in relegation. However, after the season ended, 13th-placed Elche were sent to the second tier as punishment for financial mismanagement, and Eibar were reinstated.\n\nOn 18 July 2015, Eibar played its 75th Anniversary game against Celtic in Ipurua (1–4). This included an inaugural ceremony on the pitch with a parade of 19th-century-clothed Basque soldiers with a Saltire and bagpipes playing \"Scotland the Brave\", with officials from both clubs shooting a 350 kg 19th-century cannon. Eibar stated that they invited Celtic as their opponent for the game due to the strong connection between the Basque Country and Scotland, and also due to the Scottish presence in Eibar through the years (the main supporter group is named \"Eskozia la Brava\", meaning \"Scotland the Brave\").\n\nUnder its new coach José Luis Mendilibar, Eibar finished its second top-flight season in 14th. Borja Bastón finished top ten in scoring and was named La Liga Player of the Month of October 2015, making him the first \"Armero\" to receive the award. In April 2017, Dani García became the first player to reach the milestone of 100 top division appearances for the club.\n\nThe club's 10th place in 2016–17 was improved to 9th the following season, with the latter campaign marking the first time ever that Eibar had finished as the highest-ranking of the Basque teams.\n\nIn 2015, the club signed a collaboration agreement with CD Vitoria (Tercera División) to act as an Eibar feeder team for emerging players. Eibar had previously disbanded their own B team in 2012 to cut costs while the senior side languished in Segunda División B but decided to seek a new formal arrangement for a subsidiary club after retaining their place in La Liga. Within two years of the partnership, Vitoria gained promotion to the third tier for the first time in their history; they were relegated in 2018–19 and their home matches back in the Tercera División were then moved to Eibar.\n\nIn summer 2016, the club expanded its club structure further by integrating local team \"Urkomendi\" (of the 6th level Preferente de Guipúzcoa) into the organisation as a reserve team to act as a link between the youth level and Vitoria, to be known as \"Eibar Urko\". Urkomendi (formally \"Urko14 Alkideba Fútbol Taldea\") had been founded only two years earlier by a group including several former Eibar youth players who had been released precisely because there was no structure between the junior and senior teams to accommodate them. The hope of the management was that both new subsidiary teams would move up to a higher level to improve the standard of competition for their players' development.\n\nPlaying in the town's Unbe Sports Complex, Eibar Urko gained promotion to the provincial fifth level in 2018, and seemed set to advance further to the regional fourth tier (Tercera División) as 2019 champions of Gipuzkoa; however, Vitoria's relegation from the third level at the same time blocked Urko's promotion due to rules preventing teams owned by the same club competing in the same division. This also meant Urko could not be promoted at the end of the 2019–20 season either, unless Vitoria achieved the same.\n\nAlso in 2016, Eibar made a 3-year collaboration agreement with UD Logroñés, with Eibar players going on loan to the Segunda B club for experience with the aim of achieving promotion due the additional talent in the squad. Four players made the move that summer: goalkeeper Jon Ander, defender Amelibia, midfielder Sergio García and winger Thaylor.\n\n\n\nEibar's home stadium is \"Estadio Municipal de Ipurua\", which seats 8,164 spectators.\n\nNote: this list includes players that have appeared in at least 100 league games and/or have reached international status.\n\n\n"}

He is the current titular Metropolitan bishop of Pergamon of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. He is one of the most influential Orthodox Christian theologians today.\n\nMetropolitan John's education began with study at the Universities of Thessaloniki and Athens in 1950, and then a year at the Ecumenical Institute of Bossey in 1955. Between 1960 and 1964 Zizioulas did doctoral research under the Eastern Orthodox theologian Georges Florovsky (1893-1979; Chair of Eastern Church History at Harvard and a member of the Russian Orthodox Church) and was a Fellow at Dumbarton Oaks Center for Byzantine Studies. He received his doctorate in 1965 from the University of Athens. Zizioulas took up a post at the University of Athens in 1964 as Assistant Professor of Church History, and then six years later, worked as Professor of Patristics at the University of Edinburgh from 1970 until 1973. He moved to the University of Glasgow where he held a personal chair in systematic theology for some fourteen years. In addition, Zizioulas has been a Visiting Professor at the Research Institute in Systematic Theology of King's College London. In 1986, he was elected titular metropolitan of Pergamon. In the same year, he assumed a full-time academic post at Thessaloniki School of Theology as Professor of Dogmatics.\n\nThe theological work of Metropolitan John has focused upon the twin themes of ecclesiology and theological ontology. The theology of Metropolitan John reflects the influence of Russian émigré theologians such as Nikolai Afanassieff, Vladimir Lossky and his teacher Georges Florovsky. Zizioulas has also been significantly influenced by the ascetical theology of Archimandrite Sophrony (Sakharov), founder of the Stavropegic Monastery of St John the Baptist in Essex, England.\n\nZizioulas' ecclesiology was first developed in his doctoral dissertation, subsequently published in English as \"Eucharist, Bishop, Church\". Here Metropolitan John develops critically the eucharistic ecclesiology of Nikolai Afanassief. He accepts Afanassieff's principal contention that the Church is to be understood in terms of the Eucharist. However, he criticises Afanassief's understanding as overly congregational and insufficiently episcopal in its emphasis. Finally, Zizioulas advocates an episcopocentric understanding of Church structure, understanding the Bishop primarily as the president of the Divine Liturgy and the Eucharistic community.\n\nZizioulas worked on the theology of the person, appealing to the work of St Irenaeus and St Maximus the Confessor. The primary focus of his work was to develop his own ontology of personhood derived from an extensive investigation of Greek philosophy, patristic era writings and modern rationalist philosophy.\n\nHe argues that full humanity is achieved only as person so that they may participate (\"koinonia\") in the Trinitarian life of God. However, an essential component of the ontology of personhood is the freedom to self-affirm the participation in relationship. He continues that man initially exists as a biological hypostasis, constrained as to the types of relationships one can have (biological) and to the eventual end of this type of being - death.\n\nHe makes use of existentialist philosophers and novelists, notably the French absurdist writer Albert Camus, to show that the only type of ontological freedom in the biological hypostasis is the choice to commit suicide. He claims that Baptism constitutes an ontological change in the human, making them an ecclesial hypostasis, or a person. This rebirth 'from above' gives new ontological freedom as it is not constrained by the limits of biological existence. Such ecclesial being is eschatological, meaning it is a paradoxical 'now,' but 'not yet.' The completion of this rebirth from above is the day of resurrection when the body will no longer be subject to death.\n\n\nThere are extensive bibliographies devoted to Zizioulas’ published works in various languages in:\n\n\n\n\n"}

Sitting on the southeast bank of the Yangtze River, Wuhu borders Xuancheng to the southeast, Chizhou and Tongling to the southwest, Hefei city to the northwest, Ma'anshan city to the northeast, Jiangsu Province to the east, and is approximately southwest of Nanjing. As of 2017, the city had a population of approximately 3,696,000 officially registered inhabitants.\n\nThe prefecture-level city of Wuhu administers 8 county-level divisions, including 4 districts 1 county-level city, and 3 counties.\n\nBy the end of 2017, the total population was estimated to be 3,842,100, of whom 1,665,000 live in the 4 urban districts and the others live in the counties. The city has over 47 ethnic minorities present — the largest being the Muslim population. There are other ethnic minorities with over 500 inhabitants in the city: Yi, Tujia, Miao, Zhuang, and Manchu.\n\nJiang-Huai Mandarin, a branch of Mandarin Chinese, is widely spoken in urban area, while some people in the counties speak Wu Chinese. \"Putonghua\", or Standard Mandarin, was commonly used in this area.\n\nWuhu is known to have been inhabited since at least 770 BCE. It became a strategically important town during the Three Kingdoms period (220-280 AD), when it was controlled by the Eastern Wu. At this time it was known as Jiuzi (Chiu-tzu ). Under the Ming dynasty, Wuhu developed into a major commercial center and river port and since that time has been known as a center of the rice trade.\n\nIn 1644, the Hongguang Emperor (better known as the Prince of Fu), one of the last emperors of the Ming Dynasty, was captured by forces of the new Qing Dynasty in Wuhu. During the Taiping Rebellion, Wuhu exchanges hands over five times between Taiping and Imperial forces. The city became a treaty port in 1876 and has remained a commercial center since that time. The city's Roman Catholic cathedral, St. Joseph's Cathedral (), dates from this time. Most of the downtown area alongside the Yangtze River was ceded in the British concession.\nTrade in rice, wood, and tea flourished at Wuhu until the Warlord Era of the 1920s and 1930s, when bandits were active in the area.\n\nAt the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War, part of the Second World War, Wuhu was occupied by Japan on December 10, 1937. This was a prelude to the Battle of Nanjing, ending in the Nanjing Massacre. Under Japanese occupation, Chinese resistance fighters hid in the lakes around Wuhu by submerging themselves and breathing through reeds.\n\nMajor industries began to be developed in Wuhu after the Second World War, with the development of the textile industry, shipbuilding, and paper mills. Despite this, Wuhu had been lagging behind Ma'anshan and Tongling in industrial production for decades after the establishment of the People's Republic of China and remained primarily a commercial center for trade in rice, silk, cotton, tea, wheat and eggs. However, with recent years' economic rise, Wuhu has become a hub for manufacturing.\n\nIn July 2016, Nanling and Wuwei counties suffered serious damage from heavy rain.\n\nThe city is the second largest economy in Anhui, after Hefei, the provincial capital. In 2019, Wuhu's GDP reached RMB 361.826 billion.Its per capita GDP was RMB 96533 (app.$13790).\n\nWuhu Economic & Technological Development Area in the north of the city launched in 1993 is one of the first state-level economic and technological development area in Anhui province. It has the only export processing zone in the province. Chery Automobile and Anhui Conch Cement Company are headquartered in this development area.\n\nWuhu is the fifth largest port alongside Yangtze River. Yuxikou Pier is the largest inland river coal harbor in China.\n\nBuses in Wuhu start at ¥1 for a general bus and ¥2 for air-conditioned buses.\n\nDuring the day, taxis start at ¥7; after 2.5 km, the price increases at ¥1.8 per km. From 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. taxis start at ¥8 and after 2.5 km, the prices increase at a rate of ¥2.5 for each additional km. There is a free 4 minutes of waiting time due to traffic/red lights. Afterwards it's an additional ¥0.34 for every minute during the day and ¥0.38 for every minute at night.\n\nThere is no civilian airport in Wuhu but there is a military airport used by the People's Liberation Army Air Force.\n\nWuhu has one Yangtze River crossing—the Wuhu Yangtze River Bridge, opened in 2000, carries the G5011 Wuhu–Hefei Expressway and Huainan Railway.\n\nWuhu is served by the Anhui–Jiangxi, Nanjing–Tongling and Huainan Railways. It only takes 2.5 hours from Shanghai to Wuhu by high-speed train.\n\nWuhu Rail Transit Line 1 and Line 2 are under construction and scheduled to be operational by the end of 2019.\n\nThe great poet Li Bai spent his late life in Wuhu, it is said, due to its striking landscape. Li Bai was born in a Central Asian town and raised in the southwestern China. Xie Tiao, one of the most distinctive Six Dynasty poets whom he greatly admired, left many poems when holding positions here.\n\nIn the Tang dynasty (619-907), the poet Du Mu wrote a famous poem \"Thoughts on Staying Again at Wuhu\".\n\nA factory in Wuhu carries on the local craft of making wrought iron pictures. Other local handicrafts are embossed lacquerware and rice straw pith patchwork. A famous stone tablet in Wuhu recording local events of the Song dynasty period (ca. 1000 AD) is considered to be a masterpiece of the renowned calligrapher Mi Fu. In the Western world, Wuhu is now known as the home city to many adopted Chinese children.\n\nAn itinerant blacksmith named Tang Tianchi is reputed to have invented the wrought-iron picture in Wuhu, when a painter whom he admired chided him, \"You will never make pictures by beating iron.\"\n\nAnother blacksmith of the Spring and Autumn period (770-476 BC) named Gan Jiang was famous for sword making. Zhe Shan (Reddish Brown Hill) is said to get its colour from the flames of Gan Jiang's furnace. Shen Shan (Sacred Hill) is the legendary location of his sword grinding rock and tempering pool.\n\nWuhu and Anqing are noted centers of the Yanjiang cuisine. It specializes in freshwater fish and poultry, and features special techniques of chopping, shaping, and colouring. The flavour of Yanjiang dishes is often enhanced by sweetening and smoking.\n\nReligion/Medicine\n\nThe New York Methodist Mission Society's Superintendent Virgil C. Hart arrived in Wuhu in 1881, intent on purchasing a piece of property to build the city's first Methodist Church and western hospital. V.C. Hart was able to secure the Yichisan Hill before the angered British, who wanted the property to build a consulate and naval base. The Yichisan Hospital is Anhui's oldest/continuous western hospital. Dr. Edgerton H. Hart (V.C. Hart's eldest son) became the hospital's Director in 1895 and continued at that capacity until his death in April 1913. Caroline Maddock arrived in Wuhu in October, 1904, to serve as the General Hospital's Head Nurse. Caroline Maddock would marry Dr. Edgerton Hart in October,1907. In 1909, Caroline and four other Nurses founded the Nurses Association of China and she served as its first president; this association still represents China's Nurse profession.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He received great acclaim for his roles as Abel Magwitch in the British film \"Great Expectations\" (1946) and as Balthazar in the American film \"Ben-Hur\" (1959). \n\nIn his career spanning seventy years, Currie appeared in seven films that were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. Of those, \"Around the World in 80 Days\" (1956) and \"Ben-Hur\" (1959) are winners in the category.\n\nCurrie was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, where he later attended George Watson's College. He began his work as organist and choir director. In 1898 he got his first job in Benjamin Fuller's theatre group. He was in the cast of this group for almost 10 years.\n\nHis acting career began on the stage. He and his wife, Maude Courtney, did a song-and-dance act in the USA in the late 1890s. He made his first film (\"The Old Man)\" in 1931. He appeared as a priest in the 1943 Ealing Second World War film \"Undercover\". His most famous film role was the convict, Abel Magwitch, in David Lean's \"Great Expectations\" (1946).\n\nIn the following years he appeared in Hollywood film epics, including such roles as Saint Peter in \"Quo Vadis\" (1951), as Balthazar, one of the Three Magi, in the multi-Oscar-winning \"Ben-Hur\" (1959), the Pope in \"Francis of Assisi\" (1961), and as an aged, wise senator in \"The Fall of the Roman Empire\" (1964). He appeared in \"People Will Talk\" with Cary Grant, and he portrayed Robert Taylor's embittered father, Sir Cedric, in MGM's Technicolor 1952 version of \"Ivanhoe\". But \"Ivanhoe\" also gave Currie one of his most delightful roles, highlighting his comic capabilities, as well as a willingness to still do some action scenes, even in his 70s. In 1962, he starred in an episode of NBC's \"The DuPont Show of the Week\", \"The Ordeal of Dr. Shannon\", an adaptation of A.J. Cronin's novel, \"Shannon's Way\".\n\nHe was the subject of \"This Is Your Life\" in February 1963, when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the BBC Television Theatre in London.\n\nIn 1966, Currie played Mr. Lundie, the minister, in the television adaptation of the musical \"Brigadoon\". His last performance was for the television series \"The Saint\" which starred Roger Moore. Currie played a dying mafioso boss in the two-part episode \"Vendetta for the Saint\", which was released posthumously in 1969.\n\nLater in life, he became a much respected antiques dealer, specialising in coins and precious metals. He was also a longtime collector of the works of Robert Burns. \n\nHe was married to the American actress Maude Courtney. They had a son, George Francis Courtney Currie, born on 26 September 1906, while his parents were on tour in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nCurrie died on 9 May 1968, in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire, at age 90. His ashes were scattered in Breakspear Crematorium, Ruislip, Middlesex.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2251626", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2251626", "title": "National Trades Union Congress", "text": "National Trades Union Congress\n\nThe National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), also known as the Singapore National Trades Union Congress (SNTUC; Chinese: 新加坡全国职工总会), is the sole national trade union centre in Singapore. NTUC is at the heart of the Labour Movement which comprises 59 affiliated trade unions, 5 affiliated trade associations, 12 social enterprises, 6 related organisations as well as a growing ecosystem of U Associates and enterprise partners. Together, it helms May Day celebrations and organises an annual rally in support of workers' solidarity and commitment to tripartite partnership.\n\nThe NTUC was created in 1961 when the Singapore Trades Union Congress (STUC), which had backed the People's Action Party (PAP) in its successful drive for self-government, split into the pro-PAP NTUC and the leftist Singapore Association of Trade Unions (SATU). The SATU collapsed in 1963 following the government's detention of its leaders during Operation Coldstore and its subsequent official deregistration on 13 November 1963, leaving the NTUC as the sole trade union centre. Presently, over 98% of union members are in unions affiliated with the NTUC.\n\nAfter the PAP's decisive electoral victory in 1968, the government passed the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act of 1968, which severely limited workers' rights to strike. From 1969, the NTUC adopted, in its own words, \"a cooperative, rather than a confrontational policy towards employers.\"\n\nRelations between the PAP and NTUC are very close, and have often resulted in members holding office in both organisations at the same time. The NTUC's late founder, Devan Nair, was a PAP stalwart and later served as President of Singapore. Ong Teng Cheong, the first directly elected late President of Singapore, was both the NTUC Secretary-General, and the Deputy Prime Minister (from 1985), until his presidential election. Lim Boon Heng and Lim Swee Say, the previous Secretaries-General, also became Cabinet ministers. As of 4 May 2015, Chan Chun Sing took over as Secretary-General from Lim Swee Say, who left the NTUC to become Minister for Manpower (with effect from the same date). As of 22 May 2018, Ng Chee Meng took over as Secretary-General from Chan Chun Sing, who left NTUC to become Minister of Trade and Industry.\n\nTrade unions in Singapore are run along democratic lines, and membership is voluntary. Major decisions on industrial actions are taken only with majority support expressed through secret ballot.\n\nThere are three tiers of union leadership, all elected via secret ballot. Workers in a company elect their branch leaders. The next layer is the executive committee of a union. Officials from the executive committee are drawn from the branches. At the national level, there is the Central Committee of the NTUC. The 21-member Central Committee is elected every four years.\n\nUnion leaders and employers serve on key institutions such as the National Wages Council, the Economic Development Board, the Central Provident Fund and the Singapore Productivity and Standards Board. Government and employer representatives also serve on the boards of the cooperatives, business ventures and other organisations controlled by the NTUC.\n\nAt the national level, once in four years, the union delegates elect a 21-member NTUC Central Committee to oversee the work of the labour movement. The Central Committee members elect among themselves the Secretary-General, the President, the Secretary for Financial Affairs (Treasurer) and Vice-Presidents. The Central Committee appoints other principal office bearers.\n\nUnion leadership includes Members of Parliament. These members of parliament are subject to elections, just as the other grassroots unionists are. Many other Members of Parliament, including Cabinet ministers, serve as union advisors.\n\nAt union headquarters level, key branch officials represent their branches at Union Headquarters as delegates. They have a right to vote or stand as candidates in elections to the Union Executive Committee which is responsible for the effective operation of the union.\n\nAffiliated unions are represented at the \"NTUC Delegates Conference\", the supreme authority of the labour movement. The Delegates Conference is held once in two years. During this conference, delegates review the work of the NTUC and map out future directions for the labour movement.\n\nIn April 2016, the total Union Membership figure in Singapore was 900,000. There are two main groups of members: Ordinary Branch (OB) members are directly represented by the unions/affiliates and enjoy direct collective bargaining rights, while General Branch (GB) members, who work in non-unionised companies, cannot be represented directly but are given workplace advice and whose employment issues are still handled professionally. NTUC also works with social enterprises like NTUC FairPrice and NTUC Link, as well as partners like NTUC Club and NTUC Healthcare to provide a range of core and lifestyle benefits for all of its members.\n\nSince 2002, executives are also permitted to join the NTUC membership base, which was traditionally composed of rank-and-file employees. Apart from lifestyle benefits, they also enjoy some representation (if they are employed in unionised companies).\n\n59 Trade Unions and 3 Trade Associations are affiliated to the National Trades Union Congress. The affiliated unions can be broadly categorised under Industrial Sector, Service Sector, Public Sector Unions and Omnibus Unions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe objectives of NTUC Social Enterprises are:\n\nNTUC Enterprise is the holding entity and single largest shareholder of the NTUC social enterprises.\n\nThe list of social enterprises includes:\n\n\nAdditionally, the NTUC has an Administration and Research Unit (ARU) to carry out work related to and supporting Industrial Relations. Within the ARU, the Secretary-General functions as the Director-General. The Director-General is assisted by Divisional Directors, each of whom is in charge of a cluster of departments.\n\n32 professional guilds in 22 sectors are partners of the National Trades Union Congress and are classified as U Associates. These U Associates have more than 200,000 members.\n\n\nU SME, a department within NTUC ARU, has signed 42 Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs), covering 3,099 SMEs and 70,640 workers. The MOUs help SMEs establish good employment practices and allow them to leverage on NTUC services to learn more about business developments.\n\nU SME conducts workshops to educate SME bosses on topics like the Employment Act, Employment of Foreign Manpower Act and Workplace Safety and Health Act.\n\nEstablished in 2005, Young NTUC is the youth wing of Singapore's National Trades Union Congress. Aimed at attracting younger workers into unions, Young NTUC is part of the organisation's efforts to project a more vibrant, modern and youthful image and, at the same time, remain relevant and representative of the workforce.\n\nWith a base of about 150,000 young members, Young NTUC is, by far, the largest youth movement in Singapore, as compared to Young PAP and the People's Association's Youth Movement. It enables younger members and unionists to participate and be actively involved in the various levels and activities of the labour movement, sharing ideas, views and concerns with their peers, as well as senior leaders of NTUC and affiliated unions.\n\nThe movement's signature events include RUN350, a green movement aimed at reducing the CO2 levels in the atmosphere.\n\n\n"}

After being officially disbanded by the Supreme Court in 2011, it continued to work under the name of Party of Hope (), before re-taking its original name in 2012.\n\nIn the legislative elections, held on 16 March 2003, the party won 7.3% of the popular vote and 5 out of 84 seats in the Legislative Assembly. In the presidential election of 21 March 2004, the PDC supported Héctor Silva Argüello of the United Democratic Centre, who won 3% of the vote. In the 12 March 2006 legislative election, the party won 6.8% of the popular vote and 6 out of 84 seats. The party had a similar level of support for the 2009 legislative elections, winning 6% of the vote and 5 seats.\n\nThe Christian Democratic Party is the longest lasting of El Salvador's two leading parties. It was the left-of-center party while the Party of National Conciliation was right-of-center. With the rise of more socialist and communist parties in El Salvador, it became more of a centrist party. During the civil war, many leaders of the PDC who were more left-leaning were killed or disappeared, and the party moved to the right.\n\nIn 1989 Christian Democrat José Napoleón Duarte was the first Salvadoran president to democratically hand over power to a successor. The party's position has since shrunk with the rise of ARENA and FMLN.\n\nHowever, since no party held a majority in the legislature, it could be seen as effectively holding the balance of power. It often sided with ARENA and supported their effort to ratify the Central American Free Trade Agreement and pass a law supposedly aimed at fighting terrorism.\n\nThey struggled to pick a presidential candidate for 2009. The vice presidential candidate lives in the United States and has campaigned promising to give Salvadorans abroad the opportunity to vote in future presidential elections.\n\nWhile the party was technically to be disbanded after the 2004 election, in which its candidate did not gather the necessary 3% of the vote, it was allowed to hold on to its registration by decree; this decree was declared unconstitutional on 30 April 2011, and the party was thus disbanded.\n\nThe PDC was effectively replaced by the \"Party of Hope\", which was registered with the National Electoral Tribunal in October 2011. In September 2012 the Party of Hope asked for its name to be changed back to Christian Democratic Party, which was allowed by the Electoral Tribunal.\n\n"}

They were one of the most devastating natural disasters in Australia's history.\n\nThe flood overwhelmed rivers on both sides of the Great Dividing Range, creating an inland sea the size of England and Wales.\nWorst hit was the inland city of Maitland, which is sited precariously on low-lying land on the Hunter, and which on this occasion was completely inundated by floodwaters. A total of 25 lives were claimed during a week of flooding that washed away 58 homes and damaged 103 beyond repair. In Maitland alone, 2180 homes were invaded by water.\n\nHeavy rain owing to the influence of La Niña had been occurring over the catchment of the Hunter River since October 1954 when, on 23 February 1955, an extremely intense monsoonal depression developed over southern Queensland and moved southwards. The very strong and extremely moist northeasterly airflow meant that over the basin of the Hunter and parts of the Darling River, rainfall amounts for a 24‑hour period were the highest since instrumental records began around 1885. Around Coonabarabran, as much as 327 millimetres (over 13 inches) fell in a single day, whilst falls in the upper part of the Hunter Basin the following day were generally around 200 millimetres (8 inches).\n\nWith such heavy rain on already very wet ground the Hunter, along with tributaries of the Darling (Castlereagh, Namoi and Macquarie especially) reached levels quite unprecedented since measurements were first taken about 100 years earlier. For instance, the Namoi's discharge, normally only about 25 cubic metres (875 cubic feet) per second, reached a massive 9000 cubic metres (320,000 cubic feet) per second, whilst the Macquarie peaked at around 6100 cubic metres (215,000 cubic feet) per second.\n\nIn Maitland the Hunter exceeded its August 1952 record height by nearly a metre, flooding some homes with as much as five metres of muddy water. 15,000 people were evacuated, most by boat or helicopter, whilst 31 homes were never rebuilt. In Dubbo, four thousand residents were evacuated as the main street was under more than a metre of turgid, muddy water, and the same thing occurred all along the Macquarie River, and at Gilgandra, a third of the buildings were completely destroyed. A hole torn in the main street was later found to contain two large semi-trailers.\n\nThe floods took altogether the lives of 25 people. Some 2,000 cattle and many thousands of head of other livestock were drowned. The damage to bridges, roads, railways and telephone lines took months to repair. There also were millions of pounds worth of crops destroyed.\n\nBelow in a timeline of the six days over which Maitland was ravaged by floodwaters:\n\n\n"}

The brigade participated in many campaigns, including the Meuse-Argonne Offensive and the Battle of Saint-Mihiel.\n\nThe brigade redeployed at the end of World War I in August 1918.\n\n\n\n\nAt the start of World War II, the 2nd Brigade was stationed at Fort Ontario at Oswego, New York. When the United States Army reorganized from the square division to the triangular division each division lost one regiment, (the 28th Infantry) and the brigade structure. The brigade was relieved from assignment to the 1st Infantry Division on 16 October 1939, and moved to Pierrepont, New York as a Separate Infantry Brigade on 29 March 1940. The 2nd Infantry Brigade remained at Pierrepont, New York until 1 June 1940, when they returned to Fort Ontario; the 2nd Infantry Brigade was inactivated on the same day.\n\nAfter the army's conversion to the triangular division, only two separate brigades were formed during World War II, the 1st Airborne Infantry Brigade and the 2nd Airborne Infantry Brigade both formed in 1943. The 2nd Airborne Infantry Brigade was formed at Camp Mackall, North Carolina on 20 June 1943 and included the 507th Parachute Infantry Regiment and the 508th Infantry Regiment.\nThe 2nd Airborne Brigade deployed to Northern Ireland in January 1944 under the command of Brigadier General George Howell. In order to increase the strength of Major General Matthew Ridgway's 82nd \"All American\" Airborne Division that had one of its regiments (the 504th Parachute Infantry) still deployed in Italy, the 2nd Brigade had its two regiments assigned to the 82nd, the Headquarters and Headquarters Company (HHC) also transferring to the 82nd. The 2nd Airborne Brigade was disbanded on 15 January 1945 in Europe.\n\nOn 15 February 1958 the 2nd Infantry Brigade was re-activated at Fort Devens, Massachusetts as the Pentomic 2nd Infantry Brigade with its own shoulder sleeve insignia. It spent the next five years training in northern Massachusetts and Cape Cod. The Brigade was prepared to support the Marines landing in the 1958 Lebanon crisis but did not deploy.\n\n\nIt was inactivated on 19 February 1963 at Fort Devens; in 1962 when it was reflagged as 2nd Brigade, 5th Infantry Division. It was reactivated on 23 October 1963 as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 2nd Brigade, 1st Infantry Division and moved (with the rest of the Division) to Fort Riley, Kansas in January 1964.\n\nOn 12 July 1965, the 2nd Brigade landed at Cam Ranh Bay and Vung Tau, making it the first element of an Infantry Division to arrive in Vietnam. On 30 July 1969, the unit was visited by President Richard Nixon on his visit to South Vietnam. He met with the troops in Di An. The brigade returned to Fort Riley, Kansas in April 1970.\n\nThe Dagger Brigade deployed from Fort Riley, Kansas to Saudi Arabia in December 1990 as part of the United States' offensive buildup. The brigade was commanded by Colonel Anthony Moreno. The brigade was composed of 2d Battalion, 16th Infantry; 3d Battalion, 37th Armor; and 4th Battalion, 37th Armor, plus supporting units. The brigade redeployed to Fort Riley in May 1991.\n\nOn 15 February 1996 the \"Dagger Brigade\" was relocated with the rest of the 1st Infantry Division to Europe. The \"Dagger Brigade\" replaced the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division's \"Raider Brigade\" in Schweinfurt, Germany.\n\nAlso in February 1996 the \"Dagger Brigade\" deployed units to Bosnia and Herzegovina to participate in Operation Joint Endeavor with the US 1st Armored Division.\n\nOn 7 October 1996, the Brigade Combat Team deployed to Bosnia to cover the US 1st Armored Division's redeployment to Germany. The brigade participated in Operation Joint Endeavor and Operation Joint Guard, and served as a stabilization force. The brigade redeployed to Schweinfurt in May 1997, except for the 1st Battalion, 77th Armor task force, which stayed in Bosnia until November 1997.\n\nThe \"Dagger Brigade\" served in Kosovo in 1999–2000 and again in 2002–03.\nThe \"Dagger Brigade\" deployed to the Balkans twice in 1999, first as part of Task Force Sabre in Macedonia, then in Kosovo as part of Task Force Falcon. Task Force Falcon served as the U.S. component of the NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR) with the mission of conducting peacekeeping operations in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia'a Serbian Kosovo province.\n\nTF Falcon was under the command of the 1st Infantry Division and included elements from the 1st Armored Division. The \"Dagger Brigade\" entered the war-torn province of Kosovo on 12 June 1999. TF Falcon headquartered at Camp Bondsteel, and grew into a Multi-National Brigade, including units from Greece, Russia, Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania, and the UK.\n\nInitial efforts focused on monitoring and verifying the withdrawal of former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia \"(now Serbia and Montenegro)\" forces and later the demilitarization and transformation of the Kosovo Liberation Army.\n\nThe \"Dagger Brigade\" rotated to Kosovo again in 2002, this time focused on maintaining the secure environment established by coalition forces.\n\nIn January 2003, elements of the \"Dagger Brigade\" deployed to Turkey to support Operation Iraqi Freedom. Initial efforts were to prepare the way for the U.S. 4th Infantry Division to invade Iraq from the north. When the Turkish government denied access through their border, the 2nd brigade returned to Germany.\n\nIn February 2004, the \"Dagger Brigade\" deployed to northern Iraq to serve as part of the occupation force. <br> The Brigade Combat Team included:\n\nIn August 2006 the 2nd Brigade Combat Team again deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom from their home station in Schweinfurt, Germany. Task Force 1–26 (BLUE SPADERS) was sent ahead of the main body in an effort to curb the growing violence in Adamiyah, Shab and Uhr in North East Baghdad, Iraq. The Dagger BCT followed in September 2006 and assumed the mission as the CENTCOM reserve, positioned in Kuwait. Shortly after arrival in Kuwait, TF 1–77 AR (STEEL TIGERS) was deployed to Ramadi and TF 1–18 IN (VANGUARDS) was deployed to FOB Falcon, in the Rashid District of Baghdad, Iraq. The BCT Headquarters along with the 9th Engineers (GILAS), 1–7 FA (FIRST LIGHTNING), the 299th Forward Support Battalion (LIFELINE) and the BCT's four separate companies, were deployed to Camp Liberty, Baghdad.\n\nThe DAGGER BCT assumed responsibility for Coalition force activities in northwest Baghdad in late October 2006 following Operation Together Forward II. The BCT assumed command of 3 task forces already in Sector; TF 1–22 (REGULARS) in the Abu Ghraib area west of Baghdad, TF 8–10 CAV in the Ameriyah district and TF 1-23IN (TOMAHAWK), a Stryker infantry task force which operated mainly in the Ghazaliyah and Shulla districts of Baghdad.\n\nThroughout the BCT's tour of duty, they effectively integrated and employed a total of nine attached task forces including TF 1-22IN, TF 8-10CAV, TF 1-23IN, TF 2-8CAV, TF 2–12 CAV, TF 1-325AIR, TF 1-5CAV, TF 2-32FA and TF 1–64 AR.\n\nTF 1-22IN (1st BCT, 4th ID) transitioned the Abu Ghraib district to TF 2-8CAV (1st BCT, 1st CAV). TF 8–10 CAV (4th BCT, 4th ID) transitioned Ameriyah and Khadra to TF 1–5 CAV (2nd BCT, 1st CAV). TF 1-23IN (3/2 STRYKER) transitioned Ghazaliyah to TF 2-12CAV (4th BCT, 1st CAV) and the Tomahawks assumed responsibilities in Hurriyah and Khadamiyah. TF 1-325AIR (2nd BCT, 82nd) arrived as part of the surge and assumed responsibilities for Khadamiyah, Hurriyah and some of the most dangerous Shia zones in Baghdad. TF 1-64AR (3ID) relieved TF 1-5CAV for Khadra and Mansour, enabling TF 1-5CAV to fully focus efforts against Sunni extremists in Ameriyah. TF 2-32FA (4th BCT, 1st ID) assumed responsibilities for Yarmouk and Hateen, completing the DAGGER BCT stance for OIF 06-08.\nFor the bulk of its deployment, DAGGER BCT employed five maneuver task forces, from five different BCTs from five different installations in the Continental United States.\n\nThroughout the tour, 1-7FA was attached to the Victory Base Defense Force, but provided fire support to the Dagger BCT's efforts across Northwest Baghdad. The 9th Engineers established a route clearing capability dubbed \"DAGGER IRON CLAW\" which served to clear more than 50% of the routes in support of BCT, division and corps level efforts in Baghdad. The 299th Forward Support Battalion established a vital logistics support area in support of MND-Baghdad, and sustained the BCT and all attached and detached formations while concurrently operating the division detainee holding area annex.\n\nDagger BCT ultimately established 14 joint security stations, multiple safe neighborhoods and formally partnered with the Iraqi Security Forces in the Khadamiyah and Mansour Security Districts. Under Dagger BCT OPERATION MARBLE ARCH, sectarian violence was significantly reduced as the BCT fought to stop the expansion of Shia and Sunni criminals and extremists from the North East and West/South West respectively.\n\nThe BCT and ISF leadership joined forces with the Arrowhead Stryker BCT for OPERATION ARROWHEAD STRIKE 9, which enabled a true combined forces approach to eliminating Sunni extremist from critical areas across the Mansour and Khadamiyah security districts. These combined efforts fully integrated Coalition, ISF and Iraqi municipal service efforts and enabled the rapid expansion of safe neighborhoods and increased Iraqi civilian participation in the security and services efforts.\n\nUnder Dagger BCT OPERATION SEVENTH VEIL, corrupt ISF and governmental officials' influence was significantly reduced with several key, senior-level officials arrested. SEVENTH VEIL was conducted in full partnership with the leadership of the Kharkh Area Command. OPERATION SWITCHBLADE enabled the effective integration of volunteer security forces into the combined security plan of the Dagger BCT and partnered units of the Iraqi Kharkh Area Command, to include the combined units of the Khadamiyah and Mansour Security Districts. OPERATION OUR TOWN effectively linked the security apparatus with the essential services apparatus and served as a nexus for positive, real economic and essential service growth across northwest Baghdad.\n\nThe BCT effectively transitioned Coalition force responsibilities to the 2nd BCT of the 101st in November 2007 and the Brigade re-deployed to Schweinfurt, Germany. 61 soldiers from the brigade died during the deployment.\n\nOn 16 March 2008, 1st Infantry Division's presence in Europe formally ended when the 2nd (Dagger) Brigade in Schweinfurt, Germany reflagged as the 172nd Infantry Brigade. As part of the Grow the Army Plan announced 19 Dec 2007, the 172nd is one of two infantry brigades that will be activated and retained in Germany until 2012 and 2013. The other brigade is the 2nd Brigade, 1st Armored Division in Baumholder, Germany, which was reflagged to 170th Infantry Brigade on 15 July 2009. On 28 March 2008, the 3rd Brigade, 1st Armored Division (HBCT) inactivated at Fort Riley. The soldiers and equipment currently assigned were reflagged as 2d (Dagger) Brigade, 1st Infantry Division (HBCT), aligning all units on Fort Riley under the 1st Infantry Division.\n\nIn 2008, the 2nd Brigade Combat Team was composed of:\n\nOn 30 September 2008, the Dagger Brigade Combat Team held its deployment ceremony on the Cavalry Parade Field at Fort Riley, KS.\nIn October 2008 the Dagger Brigade deployed to North West Baghdad in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, they returned to Fort Riley September 2009 and then received the Meritorious Unit Commendation for their efforts in the support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n\nIn November 2010, the Dagger Brigade deployed to Baghdad, Iraq in support of Operation New Dawn as an advise and assist brigade. The brigade was the only maneuver brigade in Baghdad and partnered with 7 Iraqi Army and Federal Police divisions and 2 corp level commands, which constituted half of the Iraqi government's security forces. They redeployed in November 2011.\n\nIn 2013, the brigade was designated as the main force for Africom.\n\nThe 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division has deployed to EUCOM as part of Operation Atlantic Resolve in September 2017.\n\n\nOn 11 December 1980 the 2nd Brigade was authorized their own distinctive unit insignia (DUI). It is described as \"a silver device 1 inches in height overall consisting of a blue arrowhead on which is superimposed a silver lion.\"\n\nThe blue arrowhead and silver lion come from the brigade's two original regiments, the 26th Infantry Regiment (\"Blue Spades\") and the 28th Infantry Regiment (\"Black Lions\"). Since both the 1st and 2nd Brigades of the 1st Infantry Division were formed before the division, they are authorized their own DUI.\n\n\n\nDecember 1990- May 1991\n\n"}
{"id": "2251666", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2251666", "title": "Oligospermia", "text": "Oligospermia\n\nTerms oligospermia, oligozoospermia, and low sperm count refer to semen with a low concentration of sperm and is a common finding in male infertility. Often semen with a decreased sperm concentration may also show significant abnormalities in sperm morphology and motility (technically oligoasthenoteratozoospermia). There has been interest in replacing the descriptive terms used in semen analysis with more quantitative information.\n\nThe diagnosis of oligozoospermia is based on one low count in a semen analysis performed on two occasions. For many decades sperm concentrations of less than 20 million sperm/ml were considered low or oligospermic, recently, however, the WHO reassessed sperm criteria and established a lower reference point, less than 15 million sperm/ml, consistent with the 5th percentile for fertile men. Sperm concentrations fluctuate and oligospermia may be temporary or permanent.\n\nSources usually classify oligospermia in 3 classes:\nThe diagnosis of oligozoospermia requires a work-up via semen analysis (listed in Male infertility).\n\nThere are many causes for oligospermia including:\n\nPre-testicular factors refer to conditions that impede adequate support of the testes and include situations of poor hormonal support and poor general health including:\n\n\nTesticular factors refer to conditions where the testes produces semen of poor quality despite adequate hormonal support and include:\n\nMast cells releasing inflammatory mediators appear to directly suppress sperm motility in a potentially reversible manner, and may be a common pathophysiological mechanism for several of the above-mentioned factors.\n\nPost-testicular factors decrease male fertility due to conditions that affect the male genital system after testicular sperm production and include defects of the genital tract as well as problems in ejaculation:\n\n\nIn about 30% of infertile men no causative factor is found for their decrease in sperm concentration or quality by common clinical, instrumental, or laboratory means, and the condition is termed \"idiopathic\" (unexplained). A number of factors may be involved in the genesis of this condition, including age, infectious agents ( such as \"Chlamydia trachomatis\"), Y chromosome microdeletions, mitochondrial changes, environmental pollutants, and \"subtle\" hormonal changes.\n\nA review in 2013 came to the result that oligospermia and azoospermia are significantly associated with being overweight (odds ratio 1.1), obese (odds ratio 1.3) and morbidly obese (odds ratio 2.0), but the cause of this is unknown. It found no significant relation between oligospermia and being underweight.\n\nThe human breast cancer susceptibility gene 2 (BRCA2) is employed in homologous recombinational repair of DNA damages during meiosis. A common single-nucleotide polymorphism of BRCA2 is associated with severe oligospermia.\n\nMen with mild oligospermia (semen concentration of 15 million to 20 million sperm/ml) were studied for an association of sperm DNA damage with life style factors. A significant association was found between sperm DNA damage and factors such as age, obesity and occupational stress.\n\nTreatment takes place within the context of infertility management and needs also to consider the fecundity of the female partner. Thus the choices can be complex.\n\nIn a number of situations direct medical or surgical intervention can improve the sperm concentration, examples are use of FSH in men with pituitary hypogonadism, antibiotics in case of infections, or operative corrections of a hydrocele, varicocele, or vas deferens obstruction.\n\nIn most cases of oligospermia including its idiopathic form there is no direct medical or surgical intervention agreed to be effective. Empirically many medical approaches have been tried including clomiphene citrate, tamoxifen, HMG, FSH, HCG, testosterone, Vitamin E, Vitamin C, anti-oxidants, carnitine, acetyl-L-carnitine, zinc, high-protein diets. In a number of pilot studies some positive results have been obtained. Clomiphene citrate has been used with modest success. The combination of tamoxifen plus testosterone was reported to improve the sperm situation.\n\nThe use of carnitine showed some promise in a controlled trial in selected cases of male infertility improving sperm quality and further studies are needed.\n\nIn many situations, intrauterine inseminations are performed with success. In more severe cases IVF, or IVF - ICSI is done and is often the best option, specifically if time is a factor or fertility problems coexist on the female side.\nThe Low dose Estrogen Testosterone Combination Therapy may improve sperm count and motility in some men including severe oligospermia.\n\nAchieving a pregnancy naturally may be a challenge if the male suffers from a low sperm count. However, chances are good if the female partner is fertile; many couples with this problem have been successful. Prognosis is more limited if there is a combination of factors that include sperm dysfunction and reduced ovarian reserve.\n\n\n"}

He developed with Sir Fred Hoyle the conformal gravity theory, known as Hoyle–Narlikar theory. It synthesises Albert Einstein's theory of relativity and Mach's principle. It proposes that the inertial mass of a particle is a function of the masses of all other particles, multiplied by a coupling constant, which is a function of cosmic epoch.\n\nNarlikar was born in Kolhapur, India on 19 July 1938 in a family of scholars. His father, Vishnu Vasudev Narlikar, was a mathematician and theoretical physicist who served as Professor and Head of Department of Mathematics at Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, and mother, Sumati Narlikar, was a scholar of Sanskrit. His wife is Mangala Narlikar and he has three daughters. His maternal uncle was the distinguished statistician V. S. Huzurbazar.\n\nNarlikar received his BSc degree from Banaras Hindu University in 1957. He then began his studies at Cambridge University, where he received a BA (Tripos) degree in mathematics in 1959 and was Senior Wrangler. In 1960, he won the Tyson Medal for astronomy. During his doctoral studies at Cambridge, he won the Smith's Prize in 1962. After receiving his PhD degree in 1963 under the guidance of Fred Hoyle, he served as a Berry Ramsey Fellow at King's College in Cambridge and earned a master's degree in astronomy and astrophysics in 1964. He continued to work as a Fellow at King's College until 1972. In 1966, Fred Hoyle established Institute of Theoretical Astronomy in Cambridge, and Narlikar served as the founding staff member of the institute during 1966–72. In 1972, Narlikar took up Professorship at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) in Mumbai, India. At the TIFR, he was in charge of the Theoretical Astrophysics Group. In 1988, the Indian University Grants Commission set up the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA) in Pune, and Narlikar became the Founder-Director of IUCAA. In 1981, Narlikar became a founding member of the World Cultural Council. Narlikar is known for his work in cosmology, especially in championing models alternative to the popular Big Bang model.

{"id": "2251672", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2251672", "title": "Anna Dalassene", "text": "Anna Dalassene\n\nAnna Dalassene (; ca. 1025/30 – 1 November 1100/02) was an important Byzantine noblewoman who played a significant role in the rise to power of the Komnenoi in the eleventh century. As \"Augusta\", a title bestowed upon her by her son, Alexios I Komnenos, rather than his empress-consort she guided the empire during his many absences for long military campaigns against Turkish and other incursions into the Byzantine Empire. As empress-mother, she exerted more influence and power than the empress-consort, Irene Doukaina, a woman whom she hated because of past intrigues with the Doukas family.\n\nAnna was the daughter of Alexios Charon, and a lady of the noble Dalassenos family. Her maternal grandfather was named Adrianos Dalassenos, evidently a son of the \"magistros\" and \"doux\" of Antioch, Theophylact Dalassenos. Very little is known about her father, who was an obscure imperial official in Italy. Her mother's family, the Dalassenoi, were a distinguished family of the Byzantine military aristocracy, beginning with Theophylact's brother Damian Dalassenos in the late 990s.\n\nThe date of Anna's birth is unknown, but is placed around the years 1025–1030. Likewise the date of her marriage to John Komnenos is variously placed in , or . The couple had eight children, five sons and three daughters. These were, by order of birth, Manuel Komnenos (), Maria Komnene (), Isaac Komnenos (), Eudokia Komnene (), Theodora Komnene (), Alexios I Komnenos (1057), Adrianos Komnenos (), and Nikephoros Komnenos ().\n\nIn 1057, John's elder brother Isaac, at the head of a group of generals, rebelled against Michael VI and forced him off the throne. At the time of the revolt, John held the post of \"doux\", but after his brother's victory, he was raised to the rank of \"kouropalates\" and appointed as \"domestikos ton scholon\" of the West. This event evidently whetted Anna's ambition; her seals from this time show her using the feminine form of her husband's titles, \"kouropalatissa\" and \"domestikissa\". Isaac's reign was cut short by his clash with the powerful Patriarch of Constantinople, Michael Keroularios, who had been instrumental in securing Michael VI's abdication, and the powerful civil aristocracy of the capital. Keroularios and his supporters led the opposition against Isaac's stringent economizing policies. Although Keroularios was deposed, Isaac resigned on 22 November 1059 and withdrew to the Stoudios Monastery. The crown then passed to Constantine X Doukas (), although Nikephoros Bryennios the Younger, who married Anna's granddaughter Anna Komnene, asserts that it was first offered to John. Despite the vehement opposition of Anna, who stressed the benefits to their children, John refused the crown. Anna tried hard to persuade John to become emperor and did everything she could, even to \"tears and groans\" to make John change his mind, but to no avail. According to the historian Konstantinos Varzos, this version of events is suspect, and may well be a post-fact attempt at legitimizing the eventual usurpation of the throne by Anna's son, Alexios Komnenos. At any rate, Anna remained implacably opposed to the Doukas family thereafter.\n\nWidowed on 12 July 1067, she guided her family's fortunes over the next decades with the sole purpose of paving her children's path to the throne. In May of the same year, Constatine X Doukas had died, and Anna allied herself with his widow, the Empress-regent Eudokia Makrembolitissa. To strengthen her family's position, she took care to arrange marriage alliances with the leading aristocratic families. Thus her daughter Maria married Michael Taronites, while Eudokia married Nikephoros Melissenos. Anna also allied herself closely with Eudokia Makrembolitissa's second husband, Romanos IV Diogenes (), supporting him in his struggle against the members of the intrigues of the Doukas family. Her youngest daughter Theodora married Romanos' son Constantine, and her eldest son Manuel was one of the favourite generals of Romanos and was named \"kouropalates\" and \"strategos autokrator\". When he died of an ear infection in early 1071, Anna hurried to his deathbed in Bithynia. As soon as he was buried, she tried to put forward her third son Alexios to replace him, but he was judged too young.\n\nThe Doukai returned to power after the defeat and capture of Romanos IV by the Seljuk Turks at the Battle of Manzikert on 19 August 1071. The \"Caesar\" John Doukas, brother of Constantine X, engineered a coup that sidelined Empress Eudokia Makrembolitissa and raised to the throne Eudokia's oldest son Michael VII Doukas () instead. When Romanos was released from captivity, the \"Caesar\"s sons even led troops against him. After he was captured, the \"Caesar\" ordered the former emperor to be blinded. During this time, Anna was accused of maintaining a secret correspondence with the deposed emperor and brought to trial. She defended herself with courage, and Bryennios states that at one point, she produced a crucifix from under her cloak and proclaimed her innocence and that \"Here is my judge and yours. Think of him before deciding and take heed that your decision is worthy of the supreme judge, who knows the secrets of men's hearts\". The judges were divided, with some wanting to set her free, but others fearing the \"Caesar\"s wrath. She was therefore exiled along with her sons to the island of Prinkipos in early 1072. It is possible that she was tonsured as well, if that had not happened earlier, as her seals bear the titles \"monache\" (\"nun\") as well as \"kouropalatissa\". Alternatively this may have happened later, in 1081 (see below).\n\nAfter the death of Romanos IV on 4 August 1072, the Komnenoi were allowed to return from exile to the imperial court. Although her enmity of the Doukai continued unabated, it appears that Michael VII tried to win her over and consented to the marriage of Anna's eldest surviving son, Isaac, with Irene, the cousin of Michael's empress-consort Maria of Alania. In September 1077, despite her initial firm opposition, she relented to the marriage of her second surviving son, Alexios, to Irene Doukaina, the granddaughter of the \"Caesar\" John Doukas. The marriage probably took place early in 1078, when the bride was only twelve years old.\n\nAnna was to play a prominent role in the Komnenian coup d'état of 1081, along with the current empress, Maria of Alania. First married to Michael VII Doukas and secondly to Nikephoros III Botaneiates (), Maria was preoccupied with the future of her son by Michael VII, Constantine Doukas. Nikephoros III intended to leave the throne to one of his close relatives, and this resulted in Maria's alliance with the Komnenoi. The real driving force behind this political alliance was Anna Dalassene.\n\nAlready closely connected to the Komnenoi through her cousin Irene's marriage to Isaac Komnenos, the Komnenoi brothers were able to see the empress under the pretense of a friendly family visit. Furthermore, to aid the conspiracy Maria had adopted Alexios as her son, though she was only five years older than he. Maria was persuaded to do so on the advice of her own \"Alans\" and her eunuchs, who had been instigated to do his by Isaac Komnenos. Knowing Anna's tight hold on her family, it must have been with her implicit approval that he was adopted. As a result, Alexios and Constantine, Maria's son, were now adoptive brothers and both Isaac and Alexios took an oath that they would safeguard his rights as emperor. By secretly giving inside information to the Komnenoi, Maria was an invaluable ally.\n\nJust as on previous occasions, the betrothal of her granddaughter to a relative of Botaneiates' did not stop Anna's intrigues against the new regime. As stated in the Alexiad, when Isaac and Alexios left Constantinople in mid-February 1081 to raise an army against Botaneiates, Anna quickly and surreptitiously mobilized the remainder of the family and took refuge in the Hagia Sophia. From there she negotiated with the emperor for the safety of family members left in the capital, while protesting her sons' innocence of hostile actions.\n\nUnder the falsehood of making a vesperal visit to worship at the church, she deliberately excluded the grandson of Botaneiates and his loyal tutor, met with Alexios and Isaac and fled for the forum of Constantine. The tutor found them missing and eventually found them on the palace grounds but she was able to convince him that they would return to the palace shortly. Then to gain entrance to both the outer and inner sanctuary of the church the women pretended to the gatekeepers that they were pilgrims from Cappadocia who had spent all their funds and wanted to worship before starting their return trip. However, before they were to gain entry into the sanctuary, Straboromanos and royal guards caught up with them to summon them back to the palace. Anna then protested that the family was in fear for their lives, her sons were loyal subjects (Alexios and Isaac were discovered absent without leave), and had learned of a plot by enemies of the Komnenoi to have them both blinded and had, therefore, fled the capital so they may continue to be of loyal service to the emperor.\n\nShe refused to go with them and demanded that they allow her to pray to the Mother of God for protection. This request was granted and Anna then manifested her true theatrical and manipulative capabilities:\n\"She was allowed to enter. As if she were weighed down with old age and worn out by grief, she walked slowly and when she approached the actual entrance to the sanctuary made two genuflections; on the third she sank to the floor and taking firm hold of the sacred doors, cried in a loud voice: \"Unless my hands are cut off, I will not leave this holy place except on one condition: that I receive the emperor's cross as guarantee of safety\".\n\nNikephoros III Botaneiates was forced into a public vow that he would grant protection to the family. Straboromanos tried to give her his cross, but for Anna this was not sufficiently large enough so that all bystanders could witness the oath. She also demanded that the cross be personally sent by Botaneiates as a vow of his good faith. He obliged, sending a complete assurance for the family with his own cross. At the emperor's further insistence, and for their own protection they took refuge at the convent of Petrion, where eventually they were joined by Irene Doukaina's mother, Maria of Bulgaria.\n\nBotaneiates allowed them to be treated as refugees rather than guests. They were allowed to have family members bring in their own food and were on good terms with the guards from whom they learned the latest news. Anna was highly successful in three important aspects of the revolt: she bought time for her sons to steal imperial horses from the stables and escape the city, she distracted the emperor and gave her sons time to gather and arm their troops and she gave a false sense of security to Botaneiates that there was no real treasonous coup against him.\n\nIsaac and Alexios Komnenos entered the capital victoriously on April 1, 1081. However, even this fortunate turn of events did not deter Anna from preventing the Doukas family from sharing the imperial coronation - she had never approved of the marriage of Alexios and Irene Doukaina, and the situation became acute now that the teenage Irene would become \"Augusta\". Although Alexios' candidature for the throne had been agreed upon by the Doukai and the Komnenoi at the army camp at Schiza, the elder Isaac still had supporters.\n\nThe fact that Alexios was crowned on April 4 while Irene was crowned a full week later is highly suspicious. It is likely that Anna and Maria of Alania had planned for Irene's departure and wanted to rule with Alexios as \"both\" mothers and wife. The latter was already an empress mother twice-over and far more experienced than the naive, teenaged, childless Irene who was yet to have any children. In her own account of this event, Anna Komnene asserts that the Komnenoi refused to drive Maria from the palace because of her many kindnesses and because \"she was in a foreign country, without relatives, without friends, with nobody whatever of her own folk'.\n\nHowever, Irene was finally crowned by the patriarch Cosmas. Anna Dalassene however was allowed to choose the next patriarch, Eustratius Garidas as a compensation.\n\nFrom the Komnenian seizure of power in 1081 until either her banishment or death, she was to play a very public role in administering the military and civil services of the empire. Her son Alexios was for many years under her influence. She was however constantly at odds with her daughter-in-law Irene and had, perhaps egregiously, assumed total responsibility for the upbringing and education of her granddaughter Anna Komnene.\n\nGiven the culture and traditions of medieval Greek Byzantium, it is unusual that Anna wielded such power over her son as well as the empire. Though he needed a reliable advisor, and essentially owed his mother for his accession to the throne because of her intrigues to stay in a powerful position for fifteen years after his succession until he was in his mid-forties defies credulity. As middle age approached, Alexios was determined to rule in his own right. After the military campaigns of the 1080s, he was able to stay in the capital and became frustrated over of Anna's tight hold on the administration, however productive this seemed to be. This was suggested by the writer Zonaras who states that Anna was in power for so long that Alexios became frustrated by that he was emperor in name alone. Anna, always one to sense the changing winds of fortune sensed his frustration, and decided to leave before she was forced out and retired to her private apartments attached to her monastic foundation of the Christ Pantepoptes. The germs of his discontent may have started as early as 1089 when in an imperial communication he complained of Anna's generosity to the monastery of Docheiariou.\n\nSources are conflicted concerning the year of Anna's retirement and death. Anna Komnene is strangely silent about her disappearance from court and this may suggest that her grandmother may have been involved in something questionable —perhaps a heretical sect such as the Bogomils. However, we know that she was wielding her power when the First Crusade passed through the city in late 1096 or early 1097, perhaps retiring after their departure. Since we are not sure of the date and reason of retirement, Zonaras records that she resided 'imperially with honor' at her foundation for several years, dying in extreme old age just over a year before her son, Isaac. Most ironically, she died on the day forecast by an Athenian astrologer for Alexios himself. She died on a 1 November between 1100 and 1102.\n\nUnder the Komnenian dynasty, women continued to not only retain their roles set by previous empresses but made great strides in founding monasteries, patronizing churchmen, theologians and literary figures and being more assertive in imperial administration: most prominent in such roles were Anna Dalassene and her contemporary, Maria of Alania.\n\nAnna Dalassena is memorialized in Judy Chicago's \"The Dinner Party\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2251684", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2251684", "title": "4th Infantry Regiment (United States)", "text": "4th Infantry Regiment (United States)\n\nThe U.S. 4th Infantry Regiment (\"Warriors\") is an infantry regiment in the United States Army. It has served the United States for approximately two hundred years.\n\nIt has been alleged that the regiment traces its lineage to the original Fourth United States Infantry, which was organized as the Infantry of the Fourth Sub-Legion on 4 September 1792, only four years after the adoption of the Constitution. The infantry of the Fourth Sub-Legion fought at Miami Rapids in 1794. In 1796, it was re-designated the Fourth Regiment of the Infantry. After ten years, due to a reduction in the army, the regiment was disbanded in 1802. However, according to the United States Army Center of Military History, this Fourth Infantry was a temporary unit with no lineal connection to either the original permanent 4th Infantry Regiment, or the modern 4th Infantry Regiment. See the lineage of the first 4th US Infantry below.\n\nIn 1808, the Regular Army was reorganized to meet the growing threat posed by the Indian nations living on the western boundaries of the United States. The first permanent Regular Army unit to bear the designation of 4th Infantry Regiment was constituted on 12 April 1808 in the Regular Army, and organized during May–June 1808 in New England.\n\nUnder the leadership of General William H. Harrison, the 4th Infantry, commanded by Colonel John Parker Boyd, was sent into the Northwest Territories, which included Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. Its mission was to eliminate the threat posed by a union of Indian tribes from the surrounding area. The hostile actions of these tribes were effectively stopping settlement of this vast area. General Harrison, who was later to become a United States President, led the 4th Infantry and a force of militia and volunteers against the Indians at Tippecanoe. During this battle, the American forces completely routed the Indians, bringing peace to the area, but at a cost of 188 dead. The regiment then returned to Fort Vincennes, and in 1812, after a trying march through the forests of Ohio, joined forces with General William Hull.\n\nWithin months of the Battle of Tippecanoe, the United States declared war against Great Britain. This required the increased manning of the Regular Army.\n\nThe modern 4th Infantry Regiment was constituted 11 January 1812 in the Regular Army as the original 14th Infantry Regiment, and organized in March 1812 in Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, and Pennsylvania.\n\nOn 12 July, General Hull crossed with his command into Canada (then British North America), and made camp at Sandwich (now Windsor), Canada, just on the Canada–US border. The regiment remained inactive for the rest of the month and grew restless. Then the Fourth was given a mission of escorting some supplies into Camp Detroit, previous escorts having been surprised and routed. The Fourth Infantry undertook this duty enthusiastically, and although ambushed at Maguage, fourteen miles below Detroit, by a superior force of British, Canadians, and Indians, the American regulars captured the enemy's concealed breastworks, wounded Chief Tecumseh, and completely routed their opponents.\n\nBefore they could follow up on their success and complete the victory, the Fourth received orders from General Hull to return to Detroit. There, the Fourth found out that General Hull had surrendered his entire force to include the Fourth led by Captain Cook to Lieutenant Bullock of the 41st Regiment on 16 August 1812 at Fort Detroit, Michigan. For this General Hull was tried and found guilty of \"Cowardliness\" and \"Neglect of Duty\". President Monroe, mitigating the court-martial sentence that General Hull be shot, ruled: \"The rolls of the army shall no longer be debased by having upon them the name of Brigadier General Hull\". The Fourth Infantry's colors, taken by the British at the surrender ordered by Hull, were kept in the Tower of London until 1889, then the colors for many years hung in the Chapel of the Royal Hospital Chelsea until 1961. Along the walls of the Great Hall are replicas (the original are in the museum). They are currently in the Welch Regiment Museum.\n\nAfter remaining several months in Canada as prisoners of war, the officers and men were returned under parole to Boston and given furloughs until exchanged for British prisoners of war. Early in 1813 the exchange was effective and the regiment reassembled and recruited to strength. It fought at the second Battle of Lacolle Mills, Canada and at Plattsburgh in 1814. These actions give the 4th Infantry campaign credit for the War of 1812.\n\nFollowing the end of the War of 1812, and consistent with the reduction in force of the Regular Army, the original 4th Infantry Regiment was consolidated on May–October 1815 with the 9th and 13th Infantry (both constituted 11 January 1812), the 21st Infantry (constituted 26 June 1812), the 40th Infantry (constituted 29 January 1813), and the 46th Infantry (constituted 30 March 1814) to form the 5th Infantry Regiment. Thereafter separate lineage.\n\nIn the same time period the 14th Infantry Regiment was consolidated May–October 1815 with the 18th Infantry Regiment and 20th Infantry Regiment (both constituted 11 January 1812) and the 36th Infantry Regiment and 38th Infantry Regiment (both constituted 29 January 1813) to form the modern 4th Infantry Regiment. On 21 August 1816 unspecified 4th Infantry Regiment companies were redesignated as Companies A and B, 4th Infantry Regiment. These companies would later be instrumental in the reorganization of 4th Infantry Regiment from the original organizational model, which included a headquarters element and 10 lettered companies with no battalion organization. The original Companies A and B would become Headquarters and Headquarters Company 1st and Headquarters and Headquarters Company 2nd Battalion.\n\nFor the next twenty years, the regiment fought almost constantly with the Creek Indians in Georgia, and the Seminoles in Florida under the command of General Andrew Jackson, a future president. In constant and long hardships the regiment marched through swamps, building cantonments and raking roads to open what now is the state of Georgia, Alabama, and Florida. A letter of Gen. Lorenzo Thomas stated: \"Each company built its own double block of logs and a house of one story for the officers quarters. The troops also saved the boards for flooring, and rived the pine shingles for roofs. In truth, the troops did the entire work, the quartermaster department only furnishing the few tools to work with, such as nails and other hardware. Scarcely a nail was used to secure the shingles, they being hung on the rafters with wooden pegs. The spaces between the logs were chinked with moss and clay and afterward the whole was whitewashed. All completed with scarcely any expense to the government.\"\n\nIn December 1835, Osceola's Seminoles cut the line of communication and supply to one of the border stations, Fort King. One hundred artillerymen from Fort Brooke under Major Gardner were ordered to re-establish the contact. At the last moment, Major Gardner's bride of a few weeks fell ill. Captain and Brevet-Major Francis L. Dade of the Fourth Infantry took command for Major Gardner. Dade joined the expedition with eleven men of B Company, Fourth Infantry. The march was begun on 20 December; on 28 December, forty miles short of Fort King, Major Dade's column was ambushed by Osceola. The only survivors of the attack were three badly wounded privates who reported the command had fought stubbornly from eight in the morning until five at night when, their ammunition exhausted, they were killed. Those who died or were wounded were: Francis L. Dade, Brevet Maj., Pvt. John Barnes, Pvt. Donald Campbell, Pvt. Marvin Cunningham, Pvt. John Doughty, Pvt. Cornel Donovan, Pvt. William Downes, Pvt. Enoch Yates, Pvt. Samuel Hall, Pvt. Wiley Jones, Pvt. John Massacre, suffering some casualties: Pvt. David Hill was killed at Fort Call on 21 August 1836, Pvt. David Mclaughlin and Pvt. William Walker were killed at Thonotosassa on 26 August 1836, Sgt. Levi Clendening was killed at Chrystal River on 9 February 1837, Pvt. Othiel Lutz, Pvt. John Stewart, and Pvt. Bathol Shumard were killed at Okeechobee on 25 December 1837, and Pvt. William Foster was killed at Big Cypress on 20 December 1841.\n\nBy 1842, the Fourth Infantry had caught up with the Indians and sent Osceola to a cell at Moutrie in which he would remain until his death. Hostile tribes that lived in these areas fled west of the Mississippi. The death roll of one company for one year includes casualties from the Indians, cholera, and five diagnosed types of fever. The same death roll has the entry \"Intemperance\" after two more soldier's names. In Orders No. 15, Western Army, 28 August 1832, General Winfield Scott states: \"The senior surgeon recommends the use of flannel shirts, flannel drawers and woolen stockings, but the Commanding General, who has seen much of the disease [cholera] knows that it is intemperance which generates and spreads the calamity and that, when spread, good and temperate men are likely to be infected. He therefore peremptorily commands that every soldier or ranger who shall be found drunk or sensibly intoxicated, after publication of this order, be compelled, as soon as his strength will permit, to dig a grave at a suitable burying place large enough for his own reception, as such a grave cannot fail soon to be wanted for the drunken man himself or for one of his drunken companions. This order is given as well to serve as a punishment for drunkenness as to spare good and temperate men the labor of digging graves for their worthless companions.\"\n\nIn 1842, the regiment was ordered to Jefferson Barracks, Missouri, where after half a century of existence the regiment enjoyed for the first time the comforts of a regular post. The regiment trained at Jefferson barracks for two years when in 1844, it was ordered to the western border of Louisiana for the war with Mexico. Hostilities were precipitated by the murder of Colonel Cross and the killing of a lieutenant with a small detachment of 4th Infantry soldiers by Mexican raiders. Although this happened in April, communications were slow and it was not until September that the command sailed to Corpus Christi, Texas, where with the 3rd, 5th, 7th and 8th Infantry regiments, one artillery regiment acting as infantry, seven companies of dragoons, and four companies of light artillery formed the Army of Observation under General Zachary Taylor. The pay was seven dollars a month and flogging was the usual means of punishment. U.S. Grant, then a lieutenant in the 4th Infantry, stated in his personal memoir: \"A more efficient army for its number and armament, I do not believe ever fought a battle than the one commanded by General Taylor in his first two engagements on Mexican--or Texan soil\".\n\nThe Army of Observation soon became the Army of Occupation. On the fields of Palo Alto, Resaca De La Palra, and at Monterey, where the regimental band of the Fourth threw away their instruments, seized a Mexican light battery, and swung it about upon their fleeing enemy. According to the official citation, the breast cord of honor given them and their successors was red, the artillery's color, to show that they were expert artillerymen as infantrymen. General Taylor had in his command leaders such as Lieutenant Ulysses S. Grant and Captain Robert E. Lee serving as a company commander of engineers. These battles had a great influence in molding the leaders of the American Civil War, which followed.\n\nGeneral Taylor having successfully invaded Northern Mexico moved the base of active operations to Vera Cruz on the east coast. In January 1847, the 4th Infantry was taken by sea to the port of Vera Cruz and after a siege, the city capitulated. General Scott commanding the Army at Vera Cruz ordered the advance on the capital, Mexico City, in April. On 17 April and 18th General Scott's forces moved through the mountain pass at Gerro Gordo, where General Santa Anna lost his wooden leg in a hasty retreat. The Mexican soldiers fought well and the pass was won only after desperate attacks.\n\nAt the finish of the war the 4th Infantry left from Vera Cruz, and reached Camp Jeff Davis, Pascagoula, Mississippi, on 23 July 1848. The regiment was ordered to proceed by sea to New York and to take station at several different points on the lakes, between Mackinac and Plattsburgh. Ordinary garrison duties were performed until June 1852.\n\nThe regiment was consolidated at Fort Columbus, New York, to board the SS \"Ohio\" and travel to Aspinwall, on the Isthmus of Panama on 5 July 1852. Their mission was to travel across the Isthmus of Panama and set up camp on the Pacific coast to protect early settlers of the Pacific Northwest. After a long journey on the overcrowded ship (1,100 officers, men and camp followers) the regiment safely reached Aspinwall on 16 July 1852. The rainy season was at its height on the Isthmus and cholera was raging. Transportation was lacking for the trip across the Isthmus of Panama, the jungles, mountains, and rivers were difficult to cross; and cholera decimated the organization as well as the families who accompanied the men. The total deaths from cholera, fever, and allied diseases from the time the regiment arrived on the Isthmus to a few weeks after the arrival at Benicia on the west coast, amounted to one officer and 106 enlisted men.\n\nOn arrival on the Pacific coast, the regiment was distributed among many small posts. Vancouver Barracks, Fort Townsend, Fort Hoskins, Fort Humboldt, Fort Dalles, Fort Steilacoom, Fort Jones, Fort Boise, Fort Lane, Fort Reading, Fort Yamhill, Orford, Fort Walla Walla, Crook, Fort Ter-Waw, Fort Cascades, Fort Simcoe, Fort Gaston, Chehalis, Fort Yuma, and Fort Mohave were all garrisoned and many of them built by the 4th Infantry at some time between 1852 and 1861.\n\nMajor Granville O. Haller of the 4th Infantry led an expedition from Fort Dalles into central Washington, and Lieutenant William A. Slaughter also of the 4th Infantry with forty-eight men from Fort Steilacoom crossed Natchez Pass to aid Major Haller when attempts to move the Indians of Puget Sound onto reservations caused trouble between them and some white settlers. Captain Maloney of the 4th Infantry, and Captain Gilmore Hayes of the Washington Volunteers had started for Yakima via Natchez Pass when they were overtaken on 29 October 1855 by the Nisqually tribe under Chief Leschi. Lt. Slaughter and his men plus Captain Hayes' force met the Indians at the crossing of the White River, and on 4 November 1855 fought without decisive results. The following day the troops met hostiles in the difficult country between the White and Green Rivers. The troops fell back into the valleys and on 24 November 1855, Lt. Slaughter, commanding a platoon of the 4th Infantry and a company of volunteers, was attacked in his camp at Puyallup. The lieutenant moved to the present site of Auburn and here again the Indians attacked. Slaughter and two corporals of the volunteer company were killed, four other men were injured, one later dying of his wounds. For years the town, which sprang up on this site, was known as Slaughter in honor of this officer of the 4th Infantry; it was later changed to Auburn.\n\nDuring the hostilities many settlers had taken refuge at Fort Steilacoom, the woman and children being left there, while the men enrolled in the volunteers. Ezar Meeker, one of the settlers, paid the following tribute to First Lieutenant John Nugen of the Fourth Infantry, commanding Fort Steilacoom while Captain Maloney was in the field.\n\nHostile tribes attacked Seattle on 26 January 1856, and two settlers were killed. Meanwhile, the regular forces were augmented by additional companies of the 4th Infantry from Vancouver Barracks and by three companies of the 9th Infantry. On 12 February 1856, they moved from Fort Steilacoom and were joined by Chief Patkanim with friendly Indians. This force advanced against the hostiles at Muckleshoot, losing one man and nine wounded, in a second battle on the White River overrunning the Indian encampment. Leshi retreated through Natches Pass and surrendered to Colonel. Wright, the commanding officer of the 4th Infantry, who had been conducting a vigorous campaign against the Yakima Indians and their allies, while the action in the west was occurring. By the close of the Leschi War, the 4th Infantry included in its present and past roster of officers such as Robert C. Buchanan, Christopher C. Augur, Alden, William Wallace Smith Bliss, Ulysses S. Grant, Philip Sheridan, Henry M. Judah, DeLancey Floyd-Jones, R.N. Scott, Lewis Cass Hunt, Granville O. Haller, Henry C. Hodges, Waller, David Allen Russell, Henry Prince, Benjamin Alvord, August Kautz, Robert Macfeely and George Crook. Many of these officers would later serve in the American Civil War.\n\nIn 1859, General William S. Harney ordered the occupation of San Juan Island as part of the territory of the United States. Three companies of the Fourth Infantry and one of the Ninth, under the command of Captain George Pickett, did the occupying. The British commander had under his command five men-of-war with 167 guns, and 2,000 sailors and marines. The British invited an officer of the Fourth to an official party of courtesy aboard the flagship. The American made a remark concerning a battle in the ongoing Second Italian War of Independence.\n\nIt was September 1859; Magenta had been fought 4 June. The British, thus believed the Americans had more current information. With the memory of Pakenham's losses at New Orleans (in a battle fought after the war was ended) fresh in their minds, the British decided to wait. As it happened, the English commander was really the best informed man on the scene, as was proved by the subsequent arrival of General Winfield Scott with orders which vetoed General Harney's decision. The San Juan troops were quietly withdrawn, without bloodshed.\n\nThis incident in Puget Sound is called the Pig War.\n\nIn 1861 with the secession of a number of Southern states to form the new Confederate States of America, the regiment moved from its dispersed posts in the Department of the Pacific to Southern California to suppress any secessionist uprising. Charged with the supervision of Los Angeles, San Bernardino, San Diego, and Santa Barbara Counties, on 14 August 1861, Major William Scott Ketchum made a rapid march on 26 August and encamped near San Bernardino, California, with Companies D and G, later reinforced at the beginning of September by a detachment of ninety First U.S. Dragoons and a howitzer. Except for frequent sniping at his camp, this move stifled a secessionist uprising and prevented secessionist political demonstrations during the September California gubernatorial elections in San Bernardino County.\n\nIn late October 1861 the regiment was relieved by California Volunteer units and marched to San Pedro harbor where they waited for the balance of the regiment to gather before being transported to Washington D.C. to become part of the garrison in defense of the capital. The regiment was organized with other Regular Army units in the Volunteer Army as the First Brigade of George Sykes's \"Regular Division\" of the V Corps. The regiment's first Civil War engagement was in April and May 1862 during the Siege of Yorktown. By quick action at the Battle of Gaines Mill in June 1862, the Regulars saved Wood's and Tidball's artillery batteries from capture by Confederate infantry.\n\nIt participated as a part of the Army of the Potomac in the Second Battle of Bull Run and then the subsequent Maryland Campaign. At the Battle of Antietam, the regulars held the Middle Bridge over Antietam Creek, guarding the vital passage. They advanced towards the Confederate-held town of Sharpsburg, Maryland, late in the afternoon of 17 September 1862, before being recalled to their lines.\n\nAfter seeing limited action at the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862, the regiment went into winter camp and saw no further combat for months. It formed part of Joseph Hooker's rear guard at Chancellorsville. Throughout the Gettysburg Campaign, the regiment served in the Regular Division under its newly promoted commander, Romeyn B. Ayres. During the Battle of Gettysburg, it was part of the fighting on the Second Day, helping push back Confederate infantry near Devil's Den and the Wheatfield.\n\nHeavily depleted by battle casualties, the much-reduced regiment nevertheless continued to participate in the major campaigns of the Army of the Potomac, by 1864 under the command of Ulysses S. Grant during the Overland Campaign. The remaining men participated in the battles of Wilderness, Spotsylvania Court House, Cold Harbor, and the Siege of Petersburg. By the time the regiment manned the breastworks around Petersburg, a lieutenant, George Randall, was in command as the senior officer still present for duty.\n\nOn 22 June 1864, with less than 150 men left, the 4th Infantry reported to City Point, Virginia, to become Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's headquarters guard. The greatly reduced regiment was present at Appomattox Courthouse for Robert E. Lee's surrender. Grant, then commanding the armies of the Union, never forgot the 4th Infantry, with which he had served as a lieutenant in Mexico and on the frontier. As recognition of its valor during the Civil War, he designated it as the guard unit during the formal surrender ceremony.\n\nSurvivors of the 4th U.S. Infantry marched in the grand review of troops in Washington D.C. in May 1865, immediately following the war.\n\nAfter the Civil War, the regiment returned to the West, now to Fort Laramie, Wyoming Territory in 1866. In 1867 the 4th Infantry built Fort Fetterman near present-day Douglas, Wyoming, completing it in July, garrisoning it, and making the new fort the regiment's headquarters. On 31 March 1869 the 4th Infantry was consolidated with the original 30th United States Infantry Regiment, and the resulting consolidation retained the 4th Infantry's designation. Companies A and B of each organization were carefully blended together to retain their original status.\n\nOn 9 December 1869, Private Jonathan Schewen of the regiment was killed in an Indian attack at the Horse River, in Wyoming Territory, and in 1871, a detachment of the 4th Infantry was sent to Louisville, Kentucky and split into small groups to chivvy moonshiners in Kentucky until 1872. On 4 March 1876, Sergeant Patrick Sullivan of the 4th was ambushed and murdered by outlaws at Fort Fetterman. In March 1876, Companies C, and I of the 4th Infantry accompanied Brigadier General George R. Crook's Big Horn Expedition, and on 5 March 1876, participated in the Fort Reno Skirmish near the abandoned Fort Reno, in Wyoming Territory.\n\nIn May and June 1876, Companies D, and F of the 4th Infantry Regiment were with General Crook's southern column and fought at the Battle of Prairie Dog Creek on 10 June 1876, and at the Battle of the Rosebud on 17 June 1876, where Crook ordered the five Infantry companies that were present to advance to bluffs overlooking Rosebud Creek in support of his Indian scouts. The men of Company D, 4th Infantry, under Captain Avery B. Cain, were first to reach the crest of the ridge north of the Rosebud, where they opened fire. Company F, of the 4th Infantry, and Companies C, G, and H, of the 9th United States Infantry Regiment, supported Company D's charge. The success of these five Infantry companies was critical to the outcome of the Battle of the Rosebud. Their enhanced firepower kept the Sioux and Cheyenne warriors at bay, while soldiers of the 2nd United States Cavalry Regiment, and 3rd United States Cavalry Regiment fought in support.\n\nOn 29 September 1879, Major Thomas T. Thornburgh of the 4th Infantry, and 12 other soldiers were killed by Indians in the Meeker massacre at the Milk River, in Colorado.\n\nIn 1892 and 1893, the 4th Infantry under the command of Colonel Robert Hall escorted Coxey's Army through Washington and Idaho to guard the Northern Pacific Railway from Coxey's men.\n\nIn 1898, the Fourth went east and embarked from Tampa to Cuba on the steamer \"Concho\". Landing at Daiquiri, the regiment participated in the Battle of El Caney and the occupation of Santiago. Fever decimated the command and the campaign ended.\n\nThe Fourth returned to New York in August 1898. Quickly recruited at Fort Sheridan, the regiment sailed in January 1899 for Manila via the Suez Canal.\n\nIn March 1899 the Infantry regiments were reorganized with twelve, rather than the traditional ten, line companies. The twelve companies were organized into three four company battalions, each commanded by a major.\n\nThe Fourth Infantry, or units of it, participated in fights of La Loma church, Wariquima, Dismarinias, Imus, Puento Julien, and elsewhere in the Philippines, finally capturing Lt. General Trias, second in command to Aquinaldo. On 20 November 1899, Private John C. Wetherby, Co. L, 4th Infantry, was near Imus, Luzon, Philippines when he was wounded carrying important orders on the battlefield, unable to walk, he crawled a great distance in order to deliver his orders. Private Wetherby received the Medal of Honor for his actions.\n\nOn 2 July 1901, 2Lt Allen J. Greer of the 4th Infantry was near Majada, Laguna Province, Philippines when he charged alone an insurgent outpost with his pistol, killing one, wounding two, and capturing three insurgents with their rifles and equipment. For his actions, 2Lt. Greer received the Medal of Honor.\n\nOn 23 November 1901, 1LT. Louis J. Van Schaick, was pursuing a band of insurgents, near Nasugbu, Batangas, Philippines, and was the first to emerge from a canyon, and seeing a column of insurgents and fearing they might turn and attack his men as they emerged one by one from the canyon, galloped forward and closed with the insurgents, thereby throwing them into confusion until the arrival of others of the detachment. 1Lt. Van Schaick received the Medal of Honor for his actions.\n\nIn 1902, the regiment returned to San Francisco, having circled the globe.\n\nThe regiment returned to the Philippines for another tour from 1903 until 1906.\n\nIn October 1906 the regiment moved to Wyoming in time to stop the Ute uprising, its last campaign against hostile Indians.\n\nIn 1908, the regiment was ordered to the Philippines for a third time, remaining until 1910.\n\nTrouble with Mexico caused the regiment to be stationed on the Texas border in 1913. On 1 January 1914 the regiment was at Galveston, Texas, as part of the 5th Brigade, 2nd Division where it had been since February 1913. The regiment was in Houston for 21 April parade commemorating the Battle of San Jacinto when it received orders on 20 April to return to Galveston where it embarked on the Army transport on 24 April bound for Veracruz arriving 28 April to relieve Navy occupation forces. The regiment camped at Los Cocos Station, practically the same ground it had occupied in the U.S.-Mexican War of 1847, sixty-seven years before. Pvt. Herman C. Moore, 4th Infantry Regiment was killed during this conflict in October 1915.\n\nIn 1917, the United States entered World War I. On 1 October 1917, the Fourth was assigned to the 3rd Infantry Division. Stationed at Fort Brown, Texas, the regiment recruited and trained up to strength and on the first anniversary of the American entry into the war, left for France. The Fourth Infantry disembarked at Brest, France in 1918 and participated in the defensive actions of Aisne, Château-Thierry, Second Battle of the Marne, and in the Third Battle of the Aisne, Saint-Mihiel, Meuse-Argonne offensives under the command of Colonel Halstead Dorey. The entire regiment was decorated with the French Croix de Guerre, having lost eighty percent of its men, under constant and grueling fire during thirty days on the line; the regiment was relieved by the 60th Infantry.\n\nOn 7 October 1918 near Cunel, France, PFC John L. Barkley, Co. K, 4th Infantry was stationed in an observation post half a kilometer from the German line, on his own initiative repaired a captured enemy machinegun and mounted it in a disabled French tank near his post. Shortly afterward, when the enemy launched a counterattack against American forces, PFC Barkley got into the tank, waited under the hostile barrage until the enemy line was abreast of him and then opened fire, completely breaking up the counterattack and killing and wounding a large number of the enemy. Five minutes later an enemy 77-millimeter gun opened fire on the tank pointblank. One shell struck the drive wheel of the tank, but this soldier nevertheless remained in the tank and after the barrage ceased broke up a second enemy counterattack, thereby enabling American forces to gain and hold Hill 25. PFC Barkley received the Medal of Honor for his actions.\n\nAfter a rest which the organization received six hundred replacements, it was marched to a position in the Forest De Passe, and on 9 November 1918, received orders to be ready on a moments notice. The men knew they were to take part in the final drive to encircle Metz in the event the Germans did not accept terms of the proposed armistice. Preparations were being made for the departure on the morning of 11 November, when the end of the war was heralded by the French villagers. The Fourth Infantry served as part of the Army of Occupation in France, until 1919.\n\nAfter returning to the United States, the Fourth Infantry was stationed at Camp Pike, Arkansas, and then moved to Camp Lewis, Washington, the site of which was part of the tribal grounds of Chief Leschi, the regiment's enemy in 1855–56. In June 1922, the regimental headquarters, headquarters and service companies and second battalion of the regiment were sent to Fort George Wright, Washington, while the other two battalions occupied Fort Missoula, Montana and Fort Lawton, Washington. On 19 February 1925 the unit was permitted to wear the red-green-red distinctive unit insignia.\n\nIn 1927, the Third Battalion at Fort Lawton moved to Fort Lincoln, Maryland. After maneuvers in California in 1940, the 3rd battalion was redesigned as part of the 15th Infantry. Cadre made up a new 3rd Battalion from the remainder of the regiment and the transfer of two companies of the 32nd Infantry at Chilkoot Barracks, Alaska. The 1st battalion, 4th Infantry pioneered military development of the strategic Alaskan territory. The rest of the regiment arrived at Anchorage shortly after and started clearing ground for what became Fort Richardson. It was the first organization of such size to arrive in Alaska.\n\nThe Fourth formed the nucleus for the Alaska Defense Command, to deter a Japanese invasion of Alaska. The Japanese began to build up forces on the southern-most Alaskan Islands and the Fourth's major battle of the war was the Battle of Attu, a Japanese held island. On 8 May 1943 soldiers of the Fourth climbed over the sides of their transport ships to land on Massacre Bay. Major John D. O'Reilly of Seattle, battalion commander, who was later to receive a battlefield promotion to lieutenant colonel, reported to Major General Landrem. Carrying extra rations and ammunition, the troops marched to engage the enemy less than 24 hours after landing. On Attu Island, the First Battalion fought the Japanese at altitudes of 2000 feet on snow-covered mountains. Moving north along the high west ridge of Chichagof Valley on 21 May 1943 the battalion came up against strong enemy opposition from machine gun and sniper positions. Later that day, the battalion moved along the ridge to a point where visual contact was established with other American forces that had proceeded inland from the Holtz Bay area, on the opposite side of the island.\n\nAfter five straight days of strong enemy opposition, the First Battalion was pulled to the rear for rest and to prepare for their next mission. After a day's rest, the First Battalion was given the task of clearing entrenched Japanese defenders from the high peaks of Fish Hook Ridge. Covered only by mortar and machine gun fire, troops of Company A scaled steep cliffs while facing heavy enemy fire. Small groups of soldiers were clearly visible as they slowly inched their way up to the enemy held peaks. Many were wounded or killed, but the battalion on 27 May 1943 finally took a portion of a high rock on the northeast end of the ridge, giving them a commanding position overlooking the main ridge running east toward the Chichagof Valley.\n\nThe fighting continued into the night and by 1900 hours on the next day, the 4th Infantry had accomplished its mission. The Presidential Unit Citation was awarded to the 1st Battalion for its heroism during the attack on the peaks. The next day, the American invasion force engaged and defeated 1,000 Japanese in a suicide counter-attack near Sarana Valley. The Fourth was given the task of combing the area of Chichagof Valley by active patrolling, hunting out and capturing or killing Japanese stragglers. This was the last engagement with the Japanese for the regiment. The Japanese had been driven from Alaska's Aleutian Islands. In the fighting the regiment lost approximately five officers and sixty enlisted men.\n\n2nd Battalion, 4th Infantry participated in a large troop movements by air. Early on the morning of 19 June 1942 the battalion was ordered to move to Nome, Alaska, near the edge of the Arctic Circle, where unidentified planes were flying threatening an invasion. Only a small number of army transport planes were available. The situation was critical and orders required that the vanguard of the force, 20 anti-aircraft guns and their crews, be in Nome within 24 hours. All civilian air traffic in Alaska was stopped that day and every suitable airplane in the vicinity was requisitioned for the movement. The fleet of planes included Stinsons, Bellancas, and two old Ford Tri-motors. By midnight of the same day, after 39 individual trips, the anti-aircraft units had been moved to Nome and the big shuttle movement was under way. Despite weather that kept the planes on the ground part of the time, the entire force and all its equipment, with the exception of big field guns and similar heavy equipment, was transported to Nome in a period of 18 days. The movement would have been completed in a week had it not been for the unfavorable weather conditions. Cargo-carrying commercial planes coming in from China were used to supplement the air armada. The midnight sun, providing almost full 24 hours of daylight, made it possible for some of the planes to make two trips in a single day. Ammunition, rations, tents, even 37 millimeter guns and field kitchens, everything necessary to make the force self-sufficient were moved by air without one accident. Heavy weapons were brought up later by boat. The troops stepped out of the planes in Nome, equipped and ready to fight. The total flights came to 218. The troops maneuvered in weather from 20 to 35 degrees below zero. They found that none of the elaborate footgear provided by the army protected their feet as well as the native Mukluk, made by the Eskimos from deer and the hide of sealskins. The 2nd Battalion remained in Nome for a year, later moving to the Aleutians. First to Dutch Harbor then to Adak, where they experienced other types of bad weather.\n\nThe 3rd Battalion, which included two companies that were stationed at Chikoot Barracks for many years before the war, helped to establish two big bases, Fort Richardson and Ladd Field.\n\nOn 2 December 1943, the 4th returned to the Lower 48, and after consolidating the regiment at Fort Lewis, Washington, it moved on 23 January 1944 to Fort Benning, Georgia, where it was assigned to the United States Army Replacement and School Command. On 1 November 1945, the 4th Infantry was assigned to the 25th Infantry Division. The incumbent personnel and equipment were reassigned to the 4th Infantry Division, which was at Camp Butner, North Carolina, while the regimental records and accouterments were forwarded to Japan to establish a unit for occupation duty. This iteration of the 4th Infantry Regiment was inactivated on 31 January 1947, at Osaka, Japan. The records and accouterments were returned to the United States and the 4th Infantry Regiment was relieved from assignment to the 25th Division on 1 February 1947.\n\nThe 4th was again activated on 1 October 1948 at Fort Lewis, Washington, as the 4th Regimental Combat Team. It served in this assignment for six years with, the 1st Battalion being sent to Ft. Richardson, Alaska, and participating in Operation Sweetbrier, an exercise to determine if Alaska could be defended if an attack from the Soviet Union came from over the pole. It was then was assigned as an organic element of the 71st Infantry Division on 10 October 1954. On 15 September 1956, the 4th Infantry was assigned to the 4th Regimental Combat Team for the second time in this capacity and served for nearly a year. On 1 July 1957, the colors of Company B were relieved from assignment to the 4th Regimental Combat Team, reorganized and redesigned Headquarters Company, 2nd Battle Group, 4th Infantry, and assigned as an organic element of the 3d Infantry Division with duty station at Fort Benning, Georgia. The remaining companies and a mortar battery to comprise the 2d Battle Group, 4th Infantry were organized for the 1st and 2d Battalions, 15th Infantry which were already stationed at Fort Benning.\n\nOn 22 July 1957, Colonel Seymore B. Satterwhite assumed command of the 2nd Battle Group, 4th Infantry and by 20 July all personnel of the battle group were thoroughly oriented on the ROCID concept. By 15 September 1957 the battle group had completed its organization under ROCID TO&E 7-11T, 1956, thus cadre training commenced in preparation for receiving 1,189 new soldiers straight from civilian life that would bring the unit to combat strength. The 2d Battle Group, 4th Infantry received the first 26 men on 12 November 1957. The remainder of the men arrived shortly after, and all of the men completed their basic training in time to go on leave for Christmas. When they returned in January, training was resumed, and training of all phases was completed by 3 April 1958. On 15 February 1958, it officially was reorganized and redesignated Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 2nd Battle Group, 4th Infantry and assigned to the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division.\n\nOn that same date, the 1st Battle Group, 4th Infantry was assigned to the separate 2d Infantry Brigade.\n\nEmbarkation leaves were held during April, and on 13 May 1958, the 2d Battle Group, 4th Infantry boarded the USNS Rose for Bremerhaven, Germany. The unit arrived in Bremerhaven on 22 May 1958 and reached Bamberg on 24 May 1958.\n\nOn 2 April 1962, the 1st Battle Group, 4th Infantry was inactivated at Fort Devens, Massachusetts.\n\nOn 18 April 1963 the 2d Battle Group, 4th Infantry was relieved from assignment to the 3d Infantry Division and the 1st Battalion, 4th Infantry was redesignated and assigned to the 3d Infantry Division. On 3 June 1963, the 2d Battle Group, 4th Infantry was inactivated in Germany and on 5 June 1963 the 1st Battalion, 4th Infantry was activated. The 2d Battle Group, 4th Infantry would later be activated (21 July 1969) as the 2d Battalion, 4th Infantry at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. The 3d Battle Group, 4th Infantry (Army Reserve) would become the 3d Battalion, 4th Infantry and be inactivated at Fairfield, Illinois, on 31 December 1965.\n\nIn 1965, the 1st Battalion, 4th Infantry joined the 3d Brigade, 3d Infantry Division in Aschaffenburg, Germany. Taking part in the many REFORGER training exercises in Germany. The battalion was named \"Warrior\" Battalion in 1966 to commemorate the long service by the regiment between fighting wars and later protecting Indians in Florida, the Pacific Northwest, and the Great Plains.\n\nIn May 1983, the 1st Battalion, 4th Infantry began to reorganize to the Division 86 concept in the Army of Excellence program by President Ronald Reagan, with the expectation of stopping a Soviet invasion of West Germany at the \"Hofsburg Throat.\" This caused the battalion to expand to four rifle companies, an anti-armor company and a very large headquarters and headquarters company.\n\nIn May 1984, the 1st Battalion, 4th Infantry began to transition to the M2 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle. The transition was completed in August 1984. In the late 1980s the government again began to reduce the armed forces and the 1st Battalion, 4th Infantry was listed for inactivation, which took place on 16 December 1987 and the unit was relieved from assignment to the 3d Infantry Division. However, the battalion until then known as 1st Battalion, 4th Infantry (Warrior Battalion), then stationed in Aschaffenburg Germany, was reflagged as the 4th Battalion, 7th Infantry (Fighting Fourth), and remained in place as part of the 3d Brigade, 3d Infantry Division.\n\nIn the summer of 1990, Company C moved from its Pershing II mission and provided security for Operation Steel Box/Golden Python (chemical weapons retrograde from Germany) at Miesau Army Depot. The unit deployed to secure the temporary storage area at the Miesau rail head, guarding over 100,000 toxic chemical artillery projectiles in steel shipping containers. Company C received the Army Superior Unit Award for flawless execution of this security mission. In November 1990, Company C was the first of the 2nd Battalion units to move to the CMTC – Hohenfels, Germany to reactivate as Company C, 1st Battalion, 4th Infantry and assume role as OPFOR.\n\nThe 2d Battalion, 4th Infantry was inactive until 2004 when it was reactivated at Fort Polk, Louisiana, as part of the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division. The 2d Battalion, 4th Infantry deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in 2006.\n\nThe 3d Battalion, 4th Infantry Regiment was reactivated on 16 October 2009 in Germany as part of the 170th Infantry Brigade\n\n<section begin=pershing />\n\nReorganized and redesignated 15 February 1958 as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 2nd Battle Group, 4th Infantry, and assigned to the 3rd Infantry Division (organic elements concurrently constituted and activated),Battle Group relieved 18 April 1963 from assignment to the 3rd Infantry Division, Inactivated 3 June 1963 in West Germany. Redesignated 21 July 1969 as the 2nd Battalion, 4th Infantry, and activated at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. On 18 September 1970 the battalion was assigned to the 56th Field Artillery Brigade headquartered in Schwäbisch Gmünd, West Germany.\n\nHeadquarters and Headquarters Company (HHC) and Company A were garrisoned at Flak Kaserne in Ludwigsburg. Company B was at Nelson Barracks in Neu Ulm and Company C was at Artillery Kaserne in Heilbronn. HHC moved to Nelson Barracks in Neu Ulm in 1971. Company A moved to Wilkins Barracks in Kornwestheim, then to Nelson Barracks in Neu Ulm in 1986. Company C moved to Wharton Barracks in Heilbronn in 1971. By 1974 HHC was at Wilkins Barracks in Kornwestheim, as was battalion headquarters.\n\nThe unit defended the missile battalions from intruding protesters of the Nationalist Green Party and other elements. The mission of the 2d Battalion, 4th Infantry was to provide armed security, including patrols, of the Pershing nuclear missiles and missile storage sites; Muetlangen was the Missile Storage Site, and Inneringen (Company A), Von Steuben (Company B), and Red Leg (Company C) were the 3 Combat Alert Sites (CAS). Additional duties included protecting Pershing nuclear systems during field operations and dealing with numerous anti-nuclear protests, as well as a rigorous infantry training schedule. Initially, HHC (Hurons) and Company A (Apaches or Alpha) were stationed at Wilkins Barracks in Kornwestheim, outside of Stuttgart; Company B (Blackfeet) was stationed at Nelson Kaserne in Neu Ulm; and, Company C (Cherokees) was stationed at Wharton Barracks and ultimately moved to Badenerhof Kaserne, both in Heilbronn. HHC and Company A were relocated to Nelson Kaserne in Neu Ulm at some point.\n\nThe 2nd Battalion, 4th Infantry participated in major exercises each winter at training areas such as Baumholder, Hohenfels, Wildflecken, and Grafenwoehr. This helped to prepare the unit for encounters with Warsaw Pact military forces in the event of an assault on the missile sites. This was considered a very real possibility during the years of the Cold War. In addition each of the line companies rotated each year to Doughboy City, Berlin to train in military operations in an urban terrain (MOUT).\n\nOn 18 August 1971, soldiers from the heavy mortar platoon from battalion headquarters were being transported from Ludwigsburg to Grafenwoehr for live fire training exercises aboard a CH-47A helicopter. The helicopter crashed and exploded, killing all 38 on board, including four members of the 4th Aviation Company.\n\nOn 17 January 1986 the battalion was withdrawn from the Combat Arms Regimental System and reorganized under the United States Army Regimental System.\n\nThe signing of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty (1987), the fall of the Berlin Wall 1989, and the demise of the Soviet Union (1991) signaled the end of the Cold War and resulted in the eventual inactivation of the 2d Battalion, 4th Infantry. On 15 May 1991, the 56th Field Artillery Command and all its subordinate units were inactivated.<section end=pershing />\n\nOn 16 November 1990, 1st Battalion, 4th Infantry was assigned as the Opposing Force (OPFOR) at the Combat Maneuver Training Center (CMTC), Hohenfels, Germany. The battalion consists of three rifle companies, a tank company, a Combat Support Company, and a headquarters and headquarters company. The combat support company was disbanded in 1995 and the platoons reassigned to the HHC. In order to support the USAREUR commander's training strategy the battalion portrays a brigade tactical group or an insurgency that challenges all the battlefield operating systems of rotational units in force-on-force situations.\n\nThe battalion has trained units deploying to Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraqi, and Afghanistan during high intensity conflict rotations, and mission readiness exercises. Additionally, the battalion has deployed forces to other countries to take part in training exercises to include the training of security forces for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece.\n\nIn addition to its OPFOR mission, the battalion has the same training requirements as other infantry battalions in the army. The battalion conducts squad external evaluations, tank gunnery, antitank gunnery, training for urban operations, marksmanship, and live fire exercises.\n\nIn August 2004 the battalion deployed Company A to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. Team Apache was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation (MUC) for its service as the only US force in the International Security Assistance Force from August to December 2004.\n\nThe MUC citation reads: During the period of 31 August to 12 December 2004, Company A, 1st Battalion, 4th Infantry distinguished themselves while in support of the International Security Assistance Force operations led by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Afghanistan. They provided superb support to coalition forces supporting a safe and successful Afghanistan National Presidential Election. Throughout the operation the company performed as a lethal, responsive, and relevant combat force directly responsible for supporting security and stabilization forces in theater. Their ability to respond to crisis was superb. Company A, 1st Battalion, 4th Infantry's efforts reflect great credit upon themselves, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and the United States Army.\n\nIn August 2005 the battalion deployed Company D to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. Team Dragon was used as a force protection company for the newly formed Afghanistan elections. Team Dragon was awarded the Joint Meritorious Unit Commendation for its service. Most of Team Dragon returned November 2006.\n\nDuring 2006, the 2d Battalion, 4th Infantry formed the core of a task force that deployed to Zabol Province in eastern Afghanistan for Operation Enduring Freedom. Along with other elements of the 4th Brigade, 10th Mountain Division, 2–4 Infantry and TF Boar conducted combat operations in support of Combined Forces Command Afghanistan and the International Security Assistance Force.\n\nStarting in July 2006 and ended in January 2011, the 1st Battalion, 4th Infantry relieved its sister battalion in Zabol Province, Afghanistan, as part of ISAF's assumption of responsibility for the province. As part of TF Zabul, nominally under Romanian command, 1–4 maintained a reinforced infantry company in the mountainous northern regions of the province, responsible for all combat operations in that area. The battalion rotated companies every 7 to 8 months, starting with C Company, followed in turn by B, A, and D companies. While each task force was deployed, the remaining companies of 1–4 continued their OPFOR mission in Hohenfels, Germany as well as training for their next combat mission in Afghanistan.\n\n2–4 Infantry deployed again in late 2007 to Iraq with 4th Brigade, 10th Mountain Division, this time for 15 months as part of the \"surge\" strategy. Their deployment ended January 2009.\n\n2–4 Infantry once again deployed to Afghanistan in 2010 under 4th Brigade, 10th Mountain Division in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.\n\nAs of 7 January 2011 the 1st Battalion, 4th Infantry has halted all deployments to Afghanistan after Company C's return, and it now serves only as the OPFOR unit for Hohenfels, Germany.\n\nCompany C, 2-4 conducted combat operations in support of Operation Enduring Freedom XX in 3 different provinces including Logar, Wardak and Kabul.

{"id": "2251690", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2251690", "title": "Jet Set Willy II", "text": "Jet Set Willy II\n\nJet Set Willy II: The Final Frontier is a platform game released in 1985 by Software Projects for a variety of 8-bit home computers. It was the only official sequel to \"Jet Set Willy\", one of the most successful home computer games ever released. Officially, \"Jet Set Willy II: The Final Frontier\" is the last of the Miner Willy series, although numerous unofficial sequels, remakes, homages and updates have been released, even up to this day.\n\n\"Jet Set Willy II\" is an expansion of the original \"JSW\" rather than a new game unto itself. Its map is primarily an expanded version of the original mansion, with only a few new elements over its predecessor, several of which are based on rumoured events in \"JSW\" that were in fact never programmed (such as being able to launch the titular ship in the screen called \"The Yacht\" and explore an island). In the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC and MSX versions, Willy is blasted from the Rocket Room into space, and for these 33 rooms he dons a spacesuit.\n\nDue to the proliferation of hacking and cheating in the original game, \"Jet Set Willy II\" pays homage to this and includes a screen called \"Cheat\" that can only be accessed by cheating.\n\nControl of Willy also differs from the original:\n\n\"Jet Set Willy II\" was not written by the original programmer, Matthew Smith, and was instead developed by Derrick P. Rowson.\n\n\"Jet Set Willy II\" came with a form of enhanced copy protection called Padlock II. To prevent felt tip copying, it had seven pages, rather than the single page used in \"Jet Set Willy\".\n\nThe ending of \"JSW II\" is also different. Once Willy has collected 150 of the 175 available items and goes to bed, the game takes control of Willy and guides him into the bathroom, where he falls into the toilet - and lands in a room named \"Oh $#!+! The Central Cavern!\", laid out identically to and deriving its name from the opening level of \"Manic Miner\". The screen is playable on the Amstrad CPC version, but there is no escape, save for the player intentionally killing off their remaining lives.\n\n\"JSW II\" was originally created as an Amstrad version of \"Jet Set Willy\" (by Derrick P. Rowson and Steve Wetherill), but with expansions to exploit the 64K RAM of the Amstrad CPC range (compared with the 48K of the ZX Spectrum, the game's home platform). This version was subsequently ported back to the Spectrum. The porting across to Amstrad and porting back to Spectrum may also explain a number of other small differences, including the loss of coloured backgrounds in certain screens as the CPC version ran in a 4-colour display mode.\n\nThe game was subsequently ported to other platforms, including the Commodore 64, Commodore 16, BBC Micro, Acorn Electron and MSX. The BBC Micro cassette version has 2 rooms not in the ZX Spectrum version, and omits 60 of the rooms, rather than being a subset of it as are the CPC and ZX Spectrum versions. Unofficial ports to the Acorn Archimedes, Windows/DOS and UNIX/X environments also exist.\n\nThe C64 screen was a different format to the Amstrad, so the developers were unable to take the data used in the Amstrad and instead had to lay out again and re-implement all the screens and sprites. However, Rowson was able to use much of the data directly from the Amstrad, and hence the game was released sooner.\n\nIn an in-depth article about both the game and the code, Your Spectrum stated that as each room was compressed and took up differing amounts of memory, a room editor would be impossible to code.\n\nIn November 2016 Rowson released JSW2+ as a re-write of JSW2. As well as technical improvements to the code allowing for more complicated rooms, it has built-in ‘cheat’ devices allowing infinite lives and teleportation. Rowson also added some new rooms, and made many of the rooms easier with fewer or slower sprites.\n\n"}

Established in 1896, the club spent three seasons in the Football League before folding in 1901. They played at the Tower Athletic Ground.\n\nLike Sheffield United, Liverpool, Chelsea and Thames, New Brighton Tower were formed to play at an already-built stadium. The owners of the New Brighton Tower, a seaside attraction built to rival the Blackpool Tower, decided there was a need to provide winter entertainment, and had built a stadium adjacent to the tower. The football club was formed in 1896 to provide the entertainment, and joined the Lancashire League at the start of the 1897–98 season. After finishing as champions in their first season, the club applied for election to the Football League. Although they were initially rejected, the league later decided to expand Division Two by four clubs and New Brighton Tower were accepted.\n\nThe club signed a number of new players, including some who had played international football, and was reasonably successful, finishing 5th (out of 18) in its first season, and 4th in their third season. However, with the club poorly supported (averaging gates of around 1,000), the cost of maintaining a professional football club became too high for the Tower's owners, and the club was disbanded in the summer of 1901, and replaced in the League by Doncaster Rovers.\n\nIn 1921, a new club was formed, New Brighton, who would also play in the Football League from 1923 until 1951, though initially they played at Sandheys Park until that was destroyed in World War II.\n\nThe tower was taken down during World War I, and the rest of the complex destroyed by fire in the late 1960s.\nThe Team's nickname was the Towerites and their home kit in their first season was wWhite shirts and blue shorts. This however changed for the following season to salmon pink shirts with a black trim and white shorts.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2251703", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2251703", "title": "Jason Russell House", "text": "Jason Russell House\n\nThe Jason Russell House is a historic house in Arlington, Massachusetts, the site of the bloodiest fighting on the first day of the American Revolutionary War, April 19, 1775 (the Battle of Lexington and Concord). The house was purchased in 1923 by the Arlington Historical Society which restored it in 1926, and now operates it as a museum from mid-April through the end of September, together with the adjoining Smith Museum, built in 1981 to house changing exhibitions of life in Arlington.\n\nAbout 1740, Jason Russell (1716–1775), a relatively prosperous farmer, constructed the house on pasture land he inherited in 1738. To have the front facing south, in the New England tradition, he placed the north side angled toward the Concord Road (now Massachusetts Avenue). Perhaps five or ten years later, he added two more rooms to form a typical New England farmhouse with five windows across the front, a door in the center and a large chimney in the middle of a pitched roof. There is some evidence that the hall (or kitchen) and its chamber above, as well as the garret, were original to Grandfather Jason's original structure of 1680. The hall and parlor of the house, with their chambers and the garret, are essentially unchanged today, although in 1814 a porch (or vestibule) was added to the front door, and further extensions were subsequently added to the sides around 1863. Inside the central part are four rooms: to the left of the entry are the kitchen and children's chamber (above), and to the right, the parlor and parlor chamber. The kitchen ceiling retains its original whitewash and sponge painting decorative surface treatment. The outside walls may have been plastered originally, but in 1924, when the house was restored, wood sheathing was installed.\n\nRobert Nylander proposed in 1964 that the house was built in two stages; however, research conducted in 2012 by the Dendrochronology Laboratory at Oxford University confirms that the home was erected during a single campaign between 1740 and 1750. The Oxford study also revealed that many of the timbers used in the house were made from lumber cut in 1684–85 or earlier and was probably salvaged from an older building on the property.\n\nThe battle at the Jason Russell House occurred late in the day, around five PM. Light infantry and grenadiers from the detachment which engaged earlier at Lexington and Concord marched toward Boston along the Concord Road. They had been met earlier in Lexington by a brigade led by Lord Percy that brought up the rear and provided strong flanking parties. The Americans kept up incessant fire from behind stone walls and other places of shelter as the British retreated.\n\nThese skirmishes erupted into a full-fledged battle at the Jason Russell House. A company of minute-men under the command of Gen. Gideon Foster, along with several other companies of minute-men and militia, had left Danvers earlier. All reached Menotomy before the British. Many of them went into a walled enclosure near the Jason Russell House where they planned to intercept the retreating soldiers. Despite being warned to watch for a flank-guard, by Israel Hutchinson, one of their company captains, they focused on the main body of British as it passed. When the party flanking the Concord Road to the south surprised them, the Americans fled to the Jason Russell House.\n\nJason Russell was 59 and lame. At noon, he had started with his wife and children to seek safety at the George Prentiss house higher up on the hill, but after proceeding part way he sent them on alone and returned to his house. A nearby neighbor, Ammi Cutter, advised him to seek safety, but Russell refused, reportedly saying \"An Englishman's house is his castle.\" Cutter himself was nearly killed by fire from an advance flanking party. Stumbling and falling between mill logs as bullets hit their bark around him, he was thought dead and the British passed him by.\n\nRussell was outside his house and joined the minute-men as they fled toward it. Being old and slow, he was in the rear and was shot twice as he reached his own doorway and then stabbed eleven times with bayonets. The British rushed into the house, killing everyone they could see. Eight minute-men made it to the basement and survived by pointing their guns up the stairs. When Jason's wife returned, she found her husband and all of the dead laid side by side in the kitchen. The house itself was riddled with bullet holes, many of them still visible. The blood stains on the floor were still visible when it was replaced in 1863.\n\nJason Russell and eleven others were buried in one grave, without coffins. A plain obelisk of New Hampshire granite now stands above the grave. It is reported that Capt. William Adams, who lived nearby, brought a sheet from his house saying he could not bear to have his neighbor buried before his eyes without a winding sheet.\n\nThe inscription on the monument reads:\n\nErected by the Inhabitants of West Cambridge, A.D. 1848, over the common grave of Jason Russell, Jason Winship, Jabez Wyman and nine others, who were slain in this town by the British Troops on their retreat from the Battles of Lexington and Concord, April 19th, 1775. Being among the first to lay down their lives in the struggle for American Independence.\n\nThe nine others, forgotten at the time the monument was erected, have since been identified as: John Bacon, Amos Mills, Jonathan Parker, Nathan Chamberlain of Needham, William Flint, Thomas Hadley, Abednego Ramsdell of Lynn, Elias Haven of Dedham and Benjamin Pierce of Salem.\n\nJason Russell's estate was settled in 1776. His house and 117 acres of land were divided between Noah, his only son left at home, and his widow, Elizabeth. She received the 17 acres the house was standing on together with half the house, \"Libberty to ues the oven when wanted\" and additional privileges of use, including space in the barn. Noah received the other half of the house, half the barn and some lands. Other children got other parts of the estate. Elizabeth Russell lived in her northerly rooms until the eleventh of August 1786 when she died aged 65.\n\n\n\n"}

After that, he concentrated mainly on screenwriting, including \"Phone Booth\" (2002), \"Cellular\" (2004) and \"Captivity\" (2007). \n\nEarly in his career, he was a prolific television writer, creating series such as \"Branded\", \"Blue Light\", \"Coronet Blue\", and \"The Invaders\". In 2006, Cohen returned to the directing chair for Mick Garris' anthology series \"Masters of Horror\", directing the episode \"Pick Me Up\". In 2017, he was the recipient of a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Fantasia International Film Festival.\n\nCohen was born on July 15, 1936 in Manhattan, New York City, New York, though some sources during his life reported that he was born in 1941. His sister, Ronni Chasen, was a publicist who worked with him beginning early in his film career. He moved to the Riverdale section of the Bronx in New York City at an early age. \n\nCohen exhibited a voracious appetite for films as a child, visiting the movie theaters at least twice a week, and most of them being double features, the young Cohen managed to consume at least four movies a week. He was a fan of the hard-boiled and film noir movies that featured actors such as Humphrey Bogart and James Cagney; films that were penned by the likes of Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett. Cohen was especially a fan of director Michael Curtiz, whose films include \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\", \"Casablanca\", and \"Dodge City\". \n\nHe majored in film studies at the City College of New York.\n\nIn the 1950s, Cohen worked for the NBC television network; where he learned how to produce teleplays, and shortly after, began writing his own television scripts. He created the TV series \"The Invaders\" and also scripted episodes of \"The Defenders\" and \"The Fugitive\".\n\nCohen began his career as a writer for well-known television series, concentrating his efforts on the crime and detective genres. He penned several episodes of \"The Defenders\" (1964) — which starred E.G. Marshall — one episode of \"Espionage\" (1964), and episodes of \"The Fugitive\" (1964–65). Other writing credits during the 1950s and 1960s included the fantasy-suspense anthologies \"Kraft Television Theatre\" (1958) and \"Kraft Suspense Theatre\" (1965), the espionage TV series \"Blue Light\" (1966) starring Robert Goulet and \"Coronet Blue\" (1967) starring Frank Converse, and the science-fiction TV series, \"The Invaders\" (1967–1968). In 1966, he wrote the screenplay to the Western film \"Return of the Seven\" (also known as \"Return of the Magnificent Seven\"), a sequel to the 1960 film \"The Magnificent Seven\", which had the return of Yul Brynner as gunslinger Chris Adams. Four episodes he wrote for \"Blue Light\" were edited together to create the theatrical film \"I Deal in Danger\", released in December 1966. He also created the Western TV series \"Branded\" (1965–1966) and was the co-creator with Walter Grauman of \"Blue Light\".\n\nAlthough Cohen continued to write TV and film scripts during the 1970s – such as \"Columbo\" – he further turned his hand to directing. His directorial debut was the comedy film \"Bone\" starring Yaphet Kotto (or \"Beverly Hills Nightmare\"), \"Dial Rat for Terror\", and \"Housewife\". In 1974, he directed the horror film \"It's Alive\", about a mutant monster baby that embarks on a killing spree. The film – an initial commercial failure – was re-released with a new and sharper advertisement campaign; it went on to earn over $7 million for Warner Bros. and spawn two sequels. \n\nCohen followed-up \"It's Alive\" with the science-fiction serial killer film \"God Told Me To\" (1976), in which a New York detective investigates a spate of killings by apparently random people who say that God told them to commit the crimes. He concentrated his work predominantly within the horror genre throughout the 1970s and 1980s, often incorporating elements of crime, police procedural, and science fiction with scathing social commentary.\n\nCohen created the \"It's Alive\" series in 1974 when he made the film \"It's Alive\". The film was eventually a moderate success – after a revamped advertising campaign – and went on to spawn two sequels, \"It's Alive II: It Lives Again\" (1978) and \"It's Alive III: Island of the Alive\" (1987).\n\n\"It's Alive\" (1974) tells of a young couple, Frank and Lenore Davis, who give birth to a mutated baby. The doctors and nurses at the hospital attempt to end the life of the deformed child, but it instead kills them and escapes. A police manhunt ensues as the fleeing mutation leaves dead bodies in its wake. Frank sees the child just as Dr. Frankenstein saw his monster and assists the police. \n\nThe emphasis in \"It's Alive\" is on chemicals in the ecosystem and experimental prescription drugs that can be harmful to unborn babies. The score for \"It's Alive\" was composed by Bernard Herrmann, famous for his contributions to many Alfred Hitchcock films, including \"Psycho\", \"North by Northwest\", and \"Vertigo\". In fact, the welling strings, horn arrangements and harp glissandos throughout the film prefigure the soundtrack to Herrmann's final film score two years later for \"Taxi Driver\". The cast includes John P. Ryan, Sharon Farrell, James Dixon, and Andrew Duggan.\n\n\"It Lives Again\" (1978) picks up where the first one ended. More mutated babies are appearing around the country. Frank has now joined a renegade mob who are attempting to stop the government from killing these strange mutations. The emphasis in \"It Lives Again\" is on accepting one's child, even if it is born with deformities or disabilities. The score is again provided by Bernard Herrmann. The cast includes John P. Ryan, James Dixon, Andrew Duggan, and Frederic Forrest.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Cohen directed, produced, and scripted a number of low-budget horror films, many of which featured actor Michael Moriarty. The first was \"Q\" – a.k.a. \"Q: The Winged Serpent\" (1982) — about an Aztec god known as Quetzalcoatl (the Winged Serpent) resurrected and nesting atop the Chrysler Building. The film is set in New York City, as was typical for Cohen, and sees two police detectives investigating a spate of killings in the city. The cast is headed by Moriarty and co-stars David Carradine, Candy Clark, Richard Roundtree, and James Dixon (another Cohen regular). The Chrysler Building scenes were actually shot on location in and around the building, including the inside and outside of the cone atop the edifice.\n\nCohen's next project with Moriarty was \"The Stuff\" (1985) in which an alien substance of sorts is found bubbling out of the ground. The Stuff is marketed at the general public, which rapidly becomes addicted to it. David \"Mo\" Rutheford, an industrial saboteur, played by Michael Moriarty, is hired to investigate the origins of the Stuff and to then destroy the product. The film co-stars Danny Aiello, Brian Bloom, Scott Bloom, Andrea Marcovicci, Patrick O'Neal, and Paul Sorvino. \"Saturday Night Live\" regular Garrett Morris plays Charlie W. Hobbs a.k.a. Chocolate Chip Charlie, a junk food mogul who assists Mo with his investigation. Cohen cast Moriarty in \"It's Alive 3: Island of the Alive\" (1987)—the third part of the \"Alive Trilogy\"—and again in \"A Return to Salem's Lot\" (1987), the unofficial sequel of Stephen King's novel and TV miniseries \"Salem's Lot\". Cohen finished the 1980s with \"Wicked Stepmother\" (1989), in which the late Bette Davis made her last appearance.\n\nCohen began the 1990s with his film \"The Ambulance\" (1990) starring Eric Roberts. The film is set in New York City and is focused on Josh Baker (Roberts), an aspiring comic book artist, who investigates a string of disappearances: people who are picked up by a mysterious ambulance that never reaches the city hospital. \"The Ambulance\" features cameos by Stan Lee, Larry Hama and Jim Salicrup of Marvel Comics. He would direct only two other films during the 1990s, one being the Blaxploitation film \"Original Gangstas\" (1996), featuring Ron O'Neal, Pam Grier, and Fred Williamson. For most of the decade, Cohen concentrated on writing. He penned the remainder of the William Lustig \"Maniac Cop\" Trilogy – he had previously scripted \"Maniac Cop\" in 1988 – that features Robert Z'Dar as undead Maniac Cop, Matt Cordell, and B-Movie horror actor Bruce Campbell. He then provided the story of the third adaptation of Jack Finney's 1955 science-fiction novel \"The Body Snatchers\", a tale of alien invasion and paranoia: \"Body Snatchers\" was directed by Abel Ferrara and starred Forest Whitaker. Throughout the decade Cohen was further involved in various TV projects including \"NYPD Blue\" and the Ed McBain-inspired \"87th Precinct: Heatwave\".\n\nCohen's output after the 1990s was less prolific and concentrated solely on scriptwriting, except for a brief return to directing with the \"Masters of Horror\" episode \"Pick Me Up\" (2006). His first project, \"Phone Booth\" (2002), became involved in a Hollywood bidding war, the script eventually ending up in the hands of Joel Schumacher. \"Phone Booth\" was a commercial success with an estimated budget of $13 million and a worldwide gross of $98 million. The film starred Colin Farrell, Katie Holmes, Kiefer Sutherland, and Forest Whitaker; it was produced by David Zucker.\n\nHis next film, another action-crime thriller titled \"Cellular\" (2004), also featured phones and, like \"Phone Booth\", it was a modest commercial success with an estimated budget of $25 million and a gross worldwide return of $50 million. \"Cellular\" starred Kim Basinger, Chris Evans, William H. Macy, and Jason Statham. \"Cellular\" was later re-made as \"Connected\" (2008), Cohen being credited with the story. He then scripted the horror-thriller films \"Captivity\" (2007) and \"Messages Deleted\" (2009); however, both films fared poorly on a critical and commercial level. Cohen nevertheless received acclaim for the above-mentioned \"Pick Me Up\", which he directed for the Mick Garris TV series \"Masters of Horror\" (2006). The episode was written by splatterpunk-horror author David Schow, and starred Cohen regular Michael Moriarty.\nIn 2003, Cohen, together with production partner Martin Poll was at the center of a lawsuit against 20th Century Fox, claiming the company had intentionally plagiarized a script of theirs titled \"Cast of Characters\" in order to create the Sean Connery-starring \"League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\" in 2003. According to the BBC, the lawsuit alleged 'that Mr. Cohen and Mr. Poll pitched the idea to Fox several times between 1993 and 1996, under the name \"Cast of Characters\".' \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\" was an adaptation of the 1999 published comic book series by Alan Moore and artist Kevin O'Neill.\n\nIn 2006, Cohen was included in the \"Masters of Horror\" TV anthology, which also included – but was not limited to – writers and directors as diverse as Dario Argento, Clive Barker, John Carpenter, Richard Chizmar, Don Coscarelli, Wes Craven, David Cronenberg, Joe Dante, Guillermo Del Toro, Ernest Dickerson, Stuart Gordon, James Gunn, Sam Hamm, Tom Holland, Tobe Hooper, Lloyd Kaufman, Mary Lambert, John Landis, Joe R.

It was created by Mick Garris for the Showtime cable network. Cohen's contribution was the segment \"Pick Me Up\", based on a short story by David Schow, who also wrote the teleplay. It stars Fairuza Balk and Cohen regulars Laurene Landon and Michael Moriarty. \"Pick Me Up\" is the story of woman traveling on a bus that has broken down along a stretch of lonely two-lane blacktop. Enter two serial killers: Wheeler (Moriarty), a driver who picks up hitchhikers with the sole intent of killing them – and – Walker (Warren Kole), a hitchhiker who accepts lifts in order to find \"his\" victims. The two killers pair up and inventively murder all the passengers on the bus, save for Stacia (Balk), who has since gone her own way. Stacia eventually winds up in the middle of a serial killer turf war, a war over which killer will get her first. \"Pick Me Up\" signaled a brief return to the director's chair for Cohen.\nJosef Rusnak remade Cohen's \"It's Alive\" in 2009. Still awaiting a score on Rotten Tomatoes, the existing reviews are also very poor. Even Cohen admitted that the remake was dreadful and states: 'It's a terrible picture. It's just beyond awful'. Cohen offered his 1974 script but remarks that it was completely ignored: \"I would advise anybody who likes my film to cross the street and avoid seeing the new enchilada.\"\n\nCohen was married twice: to Janelle Webb, until their divorce in 1980; and then to Cynthia Costas, from 1994 until his death. He had two daughters.\nCohen died on March 23, 2019 at his home in Beverly Hills, California, at age 82.\n\nCritical response to Cohen's work has been extremely varied, with reviews ranging from good to poor.\n\nCohen's science fiction horror film and satirical social commentary \"The Stuff\" (1985) garnered mixed reviews, often being compared to Jack Finney's \"The Body Snatchers\" novel and the 1958 film \"The Blob\". It has a moderate \"fresh\" rating of 63% on Rotten Tomatoes. The \"Apollo Movie Guide\" remark that \"The Stuff\" works on a purely visceral level and that it further achieves a tongue-in-cheek social parody of a society that cannot help buying into the latest craze. Although \"Apollo\" praise the juxtaposition of Cohen's clever screenplay and Michael Moriarty's performance, it states that the film is no classic. It does, however, award the film a modest Apollo Rating of 77/100. The \"Chicago Sun-Times\", on the other hand, sees \"The Stuff\" as a widely ambitious movie that fails mainly due to distracting glitches and a lack of plausibility: \"What we have here are a lot of nice touches in search of a movie.\" \"Chicago Sun-Times\" rating: 1 1/2 stars out of 5. \"Bloody Disgusting\" nevertheless awarded \"The Stuff\" 3 stars out of 5, pointing out both the good and the bad: \"[I]t's smart, it's relevant and it has some bad acting. [It should be] enjoyed for all the wrong and some of the right reasons that it is not just a horror movie, but a very honest and important movie as well.\"\n\nHis fantasy horror \"Q\" a.k.a. \"Q: The Winged Serpent\" (1982) has a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 61%. \"TV Guide\" praise Cohen for his intelligence, creativity and originality and further comment that '[Cohen] successfully combines a \"film noir\" crime story with a good old-fashioned \"giant monster\" movie' and that 'Michael Moriarty turns in a brilliant performance as Jimmy Quinn [...]'. Horror author and movie critic, Kim Newman, praises Cohen's plot originality and canny use of characters in \"Empire\", pointing out the director's use of an oddball as lead – Jimmy Quinn – who would ordinarily be a secondary character or warrant solely a cameo appearance; Newman also explains how Cohen has relegated all the usual plot devices – in movies such as \"King Kong\" – to the background. Alternatively, the \"Chicago Reader\", although viewing Cohen's monster movie as 'cheesy' and 'fun', ultimately condemns the movie as being 'curiously disengaged and sloppy'. \"The New York Times\", following the film's opening day at the Rivoli Theater, had just 'a few words – only a very few – about \"Q\", offering a brief neutral synopsis and a couple of quotes. \"Variety\" are more favourable, focusing on Cohen's 'wild' and 'bizarre' – albeit realistic – efforts: \"Q\" has great fun mixing realistic settings with political satire and a wild yarn'. They go on to say that the film belongs to both Moriarty and the Monster.\n\n\"It's Alive\", the first part of Cohen's horror trilogy featuring a mutated baby that kills its prey when trapped or frightened, holds a rating of 67% on Rotten Tomatoes, one of the highest rated Cohen films from the latter. Focusing on the social context of the film at the time, \"The Film Journal\" points out that \"It's Alive\" \"carries a potent mix of both suspense and social critique [...] [i]nvoking such taboo subjects as abortion as early as 1974\". As well as being apt at providing 'suspense', \"The Film Journal\" acknowledge Cohen's ability \"to impart an intelligent nature to his otherwise pulpy horror films.\" \"Black Hole\" magazine say that despite a lack of A-List actors and special effects, \"It's Alive\" still manages to maintain the viewers interest due to Cohen's \"unique horror concept and a script rich in ideas.\" \"Black Hole\" nevertheless points out that \"[w]hile the drama is consistent, it's less successful as a seventies monster movie, and especially lacking now.\" Whereas \"Jaws\" (1975) revealed the shark slowly, Cohen's film \"barely ever shows us the goods.\" The magazine does agree, however, that \"It's Alive\" was \"a sufficiently powerful monster movie and [that] audiences wanted more.\" \"Filmcritic\" draws attention to the humour element, especially the scenes where the Baby-Monster is rustling in the bushes, unseen, comparing them to the scene in \"Basket Case\" (1982) when the Baby-Monster is stuffed into a garbage sack after being cut away from its human twin. \"Basket Case\" is indeed a part of another – later – Baby-Monster horror trilogy. In short, \"Filmcritic\" says that Cohen's film should not be confused with art; and yet, it is \"pretty scary stuff\" that \"manages a few neat tricks.\"\n\n\"God Told Me To\" a.k.a. \"Demon\" (1976), Cohen's science fiction thriller, has a rating of 75% on Rotten Tomatoes, making it Cohen's most successful directorial effort, critically. The film, in which a number of New York citizens embark on a killing spree because \"God Told Them To\", is called \"one of his most ambitious movies\" that is \"cemented in an interesting idea\" by \"QNetwork Entertainment\", who find Cohen's ideology of the existence of God interesting: \"cynical at best\" and \"sacrilegious at worst.\" The magazine continues, however, to comment on Cohen's lack of patience and drive when completing his movies, regarding the end products as being \"hastily thrown-together\" and \"a mosaic of scenes, rather than a satisfying whole.\" In conclusion \"QNetwork\" give the film an even 2 1/2 stars for being the \"clumsiest and most entertaining schlock of the last 20 years.\" \"CinePassion\" online magazine simply states: \"[a] work of genius, in other words, possibly the Cohen joint that brims with the most all-pervasive invention and danger, as radical a Seventies 'incoherent text' as \"Taxi Driver\" and a clear linchpin of \"The X-Files\".\" The \"Chicago Sun-Times\" sees Cohen's incoherent text in a different light, likening the film to a cinematic version of the card game 52 Pickup: \"the movie does achieve greatness in another way: this is the most confused feature-length film [...] ever seen.\" But \"Time Out\" applauded Cohen for offering \"the perfect existential anti-hero\" in New York cop, Lo Bianco, in a film that \"overflows with such perverse and subversive notions that no amount of shoddy editing and substandard camerawork can conceal [its] unusual qualities\" and that by \"[d]igging deep into the psyche of American manhood, it lays bare the guilt-ridden oppressions of a soulless society.\"\n\n\n"}

Released in 1984, in 7\" and 12\" vinyl pressings. It peaked at number 51 in the UK Singles Chart.\n\nTo assist its promotion in the United States, Bronze/Island pressed a 12\" promo version for radio play (identical versions on both sides). It is one of the most difficult to find of all Motörhead items. There is also a video made for the track, directed by the manager of the Plasmatics, Rod Swenson, which was banned by MTV for \"excessive and senseless violence\".\n\nDespite relatively high-profile exposure on TV programmes such as Channel 4's \"The Tube\", the single failed to make any significant impression on the UK Singles Chart. This proved particularly disappointing to Lemmy, who at live shows regularly made joking references about its lack of sales.\n\nThe original song is not included on any official release albums except the compilation album \"No Remorse\", along with three other new songs, \"Snaggletooth\", \"Steal Your Face\" and \"Locomotive\". It is included on several other retrospective budget-release compilations, and on live albums such as \"Nö Sleep at All\".\n\nBoth the 7\" and 12\" formats feature the B-side \"Under the Knife\". The 12\" issue has a second B-side, a different track also entitled \"Under the Knife\", and came with a free colour poster. The title song is taken from the \"No Remorse\" compilation album. Bronze Records also issued a shaped picture disc (approx 12\") version of the 7\" vinyl release, depicting the band's logo. Some lapses in quality control accidentally allowed a number of pressings that play King Kurt on the B-side.\n\nThe song itself used to be a mainstay of live performances since release. As with many Motörhead songs, the lyrics show Lemmy's skill at composing lyrics which are at the same time menacing and tongue-in-cheek. Another common theme is Lemmy's use of animal images. Phrases such as \"If you squeeze my lizard, I'll put my snake on you, I'm a romantic adventure, And I'm a reptile too\" recall the song \"Love Me like a Reptile\" from the earlier \"Ace of Spades\" album. The second verse also contains the line, \"I'm a lone-wolf ligger\".\n\nA re-recorded version, entitled \"Killed by Death '08\", is in the \"Rock Band Metal Track Pack\".\n\nThe song was used in sequences set in Hell in \"Heist\", a British TV comedy-drama.\n\nThe song is featured in the 2006 video game \"\".\n\n\"Killed by Death\" was covered by German power metal band Paragon, by all-female Swedish metal band Crucified Barbara, and on the 2nd album by Finnish power metal band Beast In Black \"From Hell with Love\" (2019).\n\nAll tracks written by Lemmy, Würzel, Phil Campbell and Pete Gill.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2251732", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2251732", "title": "Supreme Court of Japan", "text": "Supreme Court of Japan\n\nThe , located in Hayabusachō, Chiyoda, Tokyo, is the highest court in Japan. It has ultimate judicial authority to interpret the Japanese constitution and decide questions of national law (including local bylaws). It has the power of judicial review; that is, it can declare Acts of the National Diet, local assemblies, and administrative actions, to be unconstitutional.\n\nThe first Western-style supreme court in Japan was the organized by the Ministry of Justice in 1875. This court was composed of 120 judges in both civil and criminal divisions. Five judges would be empaneled for any given case. The criminal division of the court was the court of first instance for crimes against the Emperor (e.g. \"lèse majesté\") and for high crimes against public order.\n\nThe statute creating the Court was abolished in 1947, and the modern Supreme Court was formed that year under the constitution of 1947. The new court was first convened in May 1947 in the former Privy Council quarters of the Tokyo Imperial Palace. It moved to the Tokyo District Court building in September, then assumed the former quarters of the Supreme Court of Judicature in October 1949.\n\nThe newly established Constitution and the Rules of the Supreme Court allowed the court to have dominating power to make comment to the law and to select its official precedents by the Case Selection Committee, as well as to autonomously govern judges. , the lawyers association which had been stipulating the rules of sentencing and judgement within judges, public prosecutors and attorneys, remained too.\n\nAfter US occupation forces left Japan, its rules became one of the closed documents to the public, except being seen in the official gazette.\n\nIn 1974, the Supreme Court moved to its current five-story building at 4-2 Hayabusa-cho, Chiyoda, Tokyo. The building was designed by architect Shinichi Okada and won the Architecture Institute of Japan Prize for Design.\n\nArticle 81 of the constitution designates it as \"the court of last resort with power to determine the constitutionality of any law, order, regulation, or official act.\" The Supreme Court is also responsible for nominating judges to lower courts, determining judicial procedures, overseeing the judicial system, including the activities of public prosecutors, and disciplining judges and other judicial personnel. It renders decisions from either a grand bench of fifteen justices or a petit bench of five. The grand bench is required for cases involving constitutionality. The court includes 34 research clerks, whose function is similar to that of the clerks of the United States Supreme Court.\n\nThe Chief Justice is nominated by the Cabinet and appointed to office by the Emperor.\n\nThe associate justices are appointed by the Cabinet in attestation of the Emperor.\n\nAfter appointment, Supreme Court justices are subject to a \"people's review\": an automatic retention referendum in which the voters may remove the judge from office. A people's review occurs at the first election to the House of Representatives after a justice assumes office, when the question of whether his tenure should continue is put to voters on the ballot. The Supreme Court justice is then subject to a further people's review at the first lower house election after every ten years. The system used resembles the Missouri Plan followed in some U.S. states. It is established by Article 79 of the constitution which includes the following provisions:\n\n, no Supreme Court justice has ever been dismissed by a people's review. It is also unusual for a justice to be subject to a second review, as most are over the age of sixty when appointed and there is mandatory retirement at seventy.\n\nThe Supreme Court is the only Japanese court explicitly empowered to review the constitutionality of laws, although it has held that lower courts also have power to interpret the constitution. Unlike constitutional courts in other civil law countries, it only exercises judicial review in cases where there is a genuine dispute between parties, and does not accept questions of constitutionality from government officials.\n\nThe Supreme Court is generally reluctant to exercise the powers of judicial review given to it by the constitution, in large part because of unwillingness to become involved in politically sensitive issues. When decisions have been rendered on such matters as the constitutionality of the Japan Self-Defense Forces, the sponsorship of Shinto ceremonies by public authorities, or the authority of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology to determine the content of school textbooks or teaching curricula, the Court has generally deferred to the government.\n\nOne important exception to this trend was a series of rulings on the unconstitutionality of the electoral district apportionment system. Although the Court ruled in 1964 that legislative districting was largely a matter of legislative policy, it ruled in the 1976 case of \"Kurokawa v. Chiba Election Commission\", that a 5:1 discrepancy in the voter-to-representative ratio between two districts was an unconstitutional violation of the right to an equal vote. Nonetheless, the Diet has repeatedly failed to keep malapportionment within the limits set forth in \"Kurokawa\". Aside from electoral matters, provisions declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court have included rules\n\n\nOne critic of the court writes that:\n\nTHIS IS OUTDATED: as of January 21, 2020, at least a handful of these are not current justices anymore. The current justices are:\n\n - Japan\n\n"}

The film was based on the novel \"The Dead Heart\" by Douglas Kennedy. \"Woop Woop\" is an Australian colloquialism referring to a fictional location in the middle of nowhere.\n\nTeddy (Johnathon Schaech) is a New York bird smuggler who goes to Australia to replace a flock of escaped birds after a deal goes awry. While there, he has a wild liaison with a quirky, sexually ravenous girl, Angie (Susie Porter), who after a brief courtship knocks him unconscious and kidnaps him. When he awakes he finds himself \"married\" to her - not legally - and stranded in Woop Woop, a desolate, dilapidated town hidden within a crater-like rock formation in Aboriginal territory. The residents are people who lived there at an asbestos mining camp before the land was handed over to the Aborigines; following a tragedy in 1979, Woop Woop was abandoned and literally \"erased\" from the Australian map. Not content with the deal given to them by the mining company (from Fremantle), they opted to return to their old lives in Woop Woop. At first they repopulated themselves incestuously, which caused wide mental instability. A rule was then enacted (\"Rule #3\") which bans residents from sleeping with their relatives. Since then, outsiders like Teddy have been occasionally kidnapped to keep Woop Woop populated.\n\nTheir only export is dog food made from road-killed kangaroos. The town is run by Angie's father, Daddy-O (Rod Taylor), in an authoritarian manner that he disguises as communal (he and the other town elders keep the best luxuries for themselves in secret while doling out only the usual canned pineapple and sub-par tobacco to the others). The only entertainment available to the residents are old Rodgers & Hammerstein films and soundtracks, the latter of which they play constantly. These are presumably left over from the town's last official contact with the civilised world.\n\nAfter witnessing another kidnapping, 'Midget' the local hairdresser, gets shot to death by Daddy-O during an attempted escape, Teddy soon realizes he will be trapped in Woop Woop for life unless he finds a way out for himself. Initially, he repairs his VW van which had been vandalized by the locals, only to have it vandalised again by Daddy-O. The Australian Cattle Dog that he adopts is shot as part of 'Dog Day.' He befriends a couple of locals, including the scruffy, affable Duffy, and Krystal, Angie's sister, who help him to confront Daddy-O's iron-fisted reign, and to arrange an escape plan. Duffy, reprimanded by Daddy-O for breaking 'Rule #3,' nonetheless elects to stay in Woop Woop, while Teddy, Krystal, and Krystal's pet cockatoo escape.\n\n\nA soundtrack was released by Universal Music Group.\n\n\"Welcome to Woop Woop\" has an overall approval rating of 29% on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nElliot's earlier film release, \"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert\" had been a Cannes hit in 1994. The uncompleted \"Welcome to Woop Woop\" was screened \"out of competition\" at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival an experience Elliott described as \"excruciating\".\n\nAustralian film critic Michael Adams later included \"Welcome to Woop Woop\" on his list of the worst ever Australian films, along with \"Phantom Gold\", \"The Glenrowan Affair\", \"Houseboat Horror\", \"The Pirate Movie\", \"Les Patterson Saves the World\" and \"Pandemonium\".\n\n\"Welcome to Woop Woop\" grossed $489,725 at the box office in Australia.\n\n\n"}

It is unique because two creeks, East Creek and West Creek, flow out of opposite ends of the canyon, separated by the almost imperceptible Unaweep Divide. State Highway 141 runs inside Unaweep Canyon between Whitewater and Gateway, one segment of the Colorado-designated Unaweep/Tabeguache Scenic Byway. The Unaweep Divide, elevation , is near mile marker 135 on SH 141.\n\nThere are multiple explanations for the origin of Unaweep Canyon. In the late 19th century, members of the Hayden Survey recognized the oddity of a canyon with two outlets, and suggested it was carved by the ancestral Colorado or Gunnison river. Many others have also suggested it was carved by either the Gunnison or Colorado Rivers, but evidence for gravel deposits characteristic of these rivers was elusive, and the existence of the divide remains difficult to explain. Several have suggested that Plio-Pleistocene uplift caused diversion of the (Colorado and/or Gunnison) river(s) and abandonment of the canyon. But rates of river incision typically exceed those of tectonic uplift, making this unlikely. The many apparent glacial-like features of the canyon's inner gorge have led some to suggest a Pleistocene glacial origin for the canyon, but the low elevation of the canyon, and lack of Pleistocene glacial deposits, make this problematic.\n\nMore recently, documentation of gravels characteristic of the Gunnison River and located at the western mouth of Unaweep Canyon provide evidence for occupation of the canyon by an ancestral Gunnison River Hence, the ancestral Gunnison River may have carved the canyon. However, another hypothesis holds that the ancestral Gunnison River did not carve the canyon, but exhumed a pre-existing (paleo) canyon. This hypothesis of an ancient age for the inner gorge of Unaweep Canyon comes from dating of sediments recovered in a core through the canyon fill. This core proved the existence of a thick (>300 m) sediment fill in the canyon, an idea first proposed in the 1970s on the basis of a geophysical study. Related to the proposed ancient age for the canyon is the hypothesis that the canyon was glaciated during the Late Paleozoic, roughly 300 million years ago. The hypotheses of a Paleozoic age and glacial origin for the canyon, remain debated, like many other hypotheses for the origin of this scenic canyon.\n\n"}

SuperPaint2 and Digital Darkroom were the first programs on the Macintosh to offer a Plug-in Architecture, allowing outside software developers to extend both programs' capabilities. Silicon Beach coined the term \"plug-in\".\n\nSilicon Beach was a pioneer in graphic tools for desktop publishing. Not only was SuperPaint a tool that had advanced graphic editing capabilities for its day, but Digital Darkroom was also a pioneering photo editor. It was grayscale only, not color (like the early Macintosh computers), but had a number of interface innovations, including the Magic Wand tool, which also appeared later in Photoshop. It also had a proprietary option for printing grayscale content on dot matrix printers. Digital Darkroom was used professionally to clean up scanned images for clip art libraries.\n\nAnother innovative Silicon Beach product was SuperCard which, like SuperPaint, superseded the capabilities of an Apple-branded product (in this case, HyperCard). SuperCard used a superset of the HyperTalk programming language and addressed common complaints about HyperCard by adding native support for color, multiple windows, support for vector images, menus and other features.\n\nSilicon Beach Software produced innovative computer games for the Macintosh. The most well known is \"Dark Castle\" released in 1986. It was ported to several other operating systems by other companies. Sequel \"Beyond Dark Castle\" was Silicon Beach's last game, because productivity software was much more lucrative. Their 1985 release, \"Airborne!\", was the first Macintosh game to feature digitized sound.\n\nSilicon Beach Software is credited with coining the term Silicon Beach to refer to San Diego in the same way that Silicon Valley refers to the Santa Clara Valley and San Jose area.\n\nSilicon Beach was acquired by Aldus in 1990, and Aldus in turn by Adobe Systems in 1994.\n\n\n"}

Equipped with satellite antenna he began to re-broadcast foreign television programmes, most notably Super Channel and MTV. The programme was occasionally interrupted with public service announcements in order to win favour of local authorities. The authorities in Zagreb were, however, less friendly and the station was often shut down by government inspectors. TV Marjan, however, began to make original programmes and air it during holidays.\n\nThe station finally started on air continuously February 20, 1990. As such, it took part in campaign for first Croatian parliamentary elections and was the first Croatian broadcast media that aired interview with future President Franjo Tuđman.\n"}
{"id": "2251789", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2251789", "title": "List of prisons in New Zealand", "text": "List of prisons in New Zealand\n\nThere are eighteen adult correctional facilities (prisons) in New Zealand. Three prisons house female offenders, one each in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch. The remaining fifteen house male offenders; ten in the North Island and five in the South Island. In addition, there are four youth correctional facilities, termed youth justice residences. The facilities are managed by the Department of Corrections.\n\nThere are five security levels in New Zealand adult prisons: Minimum, Low, Low-Medium, High and Maximum.\n\nIn 2018 \"North & South\" magazine published a long-form article by Paul Little titled \"The Case for Closing Prisons\" which included data on New Zealand prison inmate populations.\n\nNorthland Region Corrections Facility is located 5 km northeast of the town of Kaikohe and is colloquially known as Ngawha - after the local area. Maori in Northland tried to persuade the Corrections Department not to upset a local taniwha by building the prison on thermal land. They were unsuccessful and the facility opened in 2005. Following completion, the foundations proved to be unstable. In 2007, the Government admitted the prison was sinking into the ground and required repairs. It ended up costing $137 million, which was $100 million more than the original project estimate.\n\nThe prison accommodates up to 548 prisoners with security classifications ranging from minimum to high-medium and employs 180 staff.\n\nAuckland Prison is located on Paremoremo Rd on Auckland's North Shore - hence the name Paremoremo Prison. It contains New Zealand's only specialist maximum-security prison unit and houses some of the most violent criminals in the country. The prison opened in 1968 and contains up to 681 prisoners though in 2010, only about 90 were classified as maximum security. It has a staff of 225. The first female corrections officers started working at the prison in 1987 and women now make up 14% of staff.\n\nParemoremo has a 60-bed treatment unit for child sex offenders called \"Te Piriti\" and a Special Needs Unit. In November 2011, a new Drug Treatment Unit (DTU) was established at the prison with clinical staff coming from Odyssey House. The DTU houses up to 48 prisoners at a time and provides an intensive 12-week programme targeted at prisoners serving sentences of between four and twelve months.\n\nIn November 2018 \"North & South\" magazine published an inmate's account of life inside Paremoremo.\n\nHistory\n\nThere has been a prison on the Mount Eden site in Auckland since 1856. The first building was made of timber and was known as the Stockade. A new stone building opened in 1865 although the stone wall that surrounds the prison was not finished until the mid-1870s - using prison labour. The Victorian stone building with its high towers and thick stone perimeter wall is still a recognisable Auckland landmark.\n\nEven as Mt Eden Prison was being built, calls were made for it to be closed. Changing views about prison incarceration during the early 1900s led the then Minister of Justice to declare the facility to be obsolete. By 1945 public calls were being made for the prison to be demolished but demolition plans were postponed in 1953 due to a shortage of funds. In 1965 a prison-wide riot broke out following a failed mass breakout attempt. Prisoners lit fires that quickly spread along the roof, fuelled with fat, oil, furniture and prisoners' personal effects. By the time prisoners surrendered 34 hours later, little remained of the original prison other than its exterior stone shell. The kitchen, the chapel, the watch house and 61 cells were destroyed and the prison roof suffered extensive damage. Due to a shortage of alternative accommodation, the prison was gradually rebuilt as a temporary measure, but much of it was not restored to its original condition.\n\nThe old Mount Eden Prison used to hold about 420 prisoners and was squalid, substandard and unsafe. In 2004 the Department acknowledged the prison \"falls well-short of the basic requirements for a modern corrections facility\"; a New Zealand Herald editorial described it as an \"antiquated pile beyond redemption as a suitable place to incarcerate humans\". The 120-year-old prison was closed in 2011. Although it no longer houses inmates, the building has a 'category one' classification from Heritage New Zealand due to its historical significance and architectural quality. The building was to be restored and converted for staff and administration use for the new prison completed on the same site.\n\nCurrent\n\nThe $40 million Auckland Central Remand Prison (ACRP), housing about 250 remand inmates, opened in July 2000, next to the old prison. It became the main reception prison for newly remanded male prisoners in the Auckland region. ACRP was the first prison in New Zealand to be administered by a private company. It was run by an Australian company, GEO Group. Five years later (2005), ACRP was returned to state operation by a Labour government.\n\nA major project to redevelop the site and create another facility began in 2008. New accommodation blocks and support facilities were constructed at a cost of $216 million. The prison was renamed the Mt Eden Corrections Facility (MECF) and now holds 966 prisoners. It opened on 30 March 2011.\n\nIn May 2010, the National Government decided that the prison would be privatised once again and British conglomerate, Serco, was awarded the contract. Five years later (July 2015) videos appeared online showing gang members fighting inside MECF. Allegations were made that there was an organised 'fight club' and that prisoners were filming the fights on cell phones and posting them on social media. Following an investigation, the Corrections Department stepped in to take over day-to-day management of the prison and then in December, the Government announced that Serco's contract would not be renewed in March 2017.\n\nIn 2019 \"North & South\" magazine published the story of Pasimaca Osment, who in 1991 became one of the first female prison officers in New Zealand to work in a maximum-security jail. The piece describes her experiences at Mt Eden Corrections Facility, Spring Hill Corrections Facility and Paremoremo.\n\nThe Auckland Region Women's Corrections Facility (ARWCF) is in the Wiri suburb of Manukau City. The site is 47 ha in size, of which only 13 ha are currently covered by the prison, leaving considerable room for expansion. With so much space available, in 2011 it became the proposed site for a new $900 million 960-bed men's prison which is due to be built by 2015 and operated by British conglomerate Serco. This will make the suburb of Wiri the country's biggest prison precinct.\n\nThe women's prison opened in 2006 and was the second of four new prisons constructed as part of the Department's Regional Prisons Development Project. The original plan was for only 150 beds but a 20 per cent hike in the number of women being sent to prison led to a significant expansion. Despite the increase, women still make up only 6% of the prison population. ARWCF now houses up to 456 prisoners and as a result of the increase, the cost blew out from an estimated $58 million to $158 million.\n\nARWCF is the first purpose-built women's prison in New Zealand. It has one high security Management Unit with 24 beds, two high-medium security units, one for sentenced and one for remand prisoners, each with 90 beds and a 32-bed assessment unit. Many cells can accommodate two prisoners through double bunking. Until it was built, female prisoners have mostly had to serve their sentences at women's prisons in Wellington and Christchurch.\n\nThe prison has a specialist unit for mothers with babies - known as the baby bonding unit. Prisoners with babies aged under nine months being cared for in the community are permitted daily visits in secure, purpose-built facilities where they can feed and bond with their child. These facilities replicate a domestic lounge setting with a bathroom, kitchenette and sleeping room for the baby. There is also an external courtyard. This allows a mother to spend up to 12 hours a day with her baby. It also allows the baby to bond with the caregiver raising the child while the mother serves her sentence.\n\nThe prison also provides the Kowhiritanga ('Making Choices') Programme. This rehabilitation programme is designed to address the particular needs of female prisoners – many of whom have suffered sexual abuse during childhood and in their current relationships. Auckland University sociologist Dr Tracey McIntosh, says virtually all Maori women in prisons have been physically or sexually abused - and were excluded from school by the age of 13. The Making Choices programme uses cognitive-behavioural therapy, dialectical behaviour therapy, group psychotherapy, recreational psychology and a narrative approach to therapy.\n\nIn 2010 it was reported that eight prisoners at Auckland Region Women's Corrections Facility are training dogs as part of the Puppies in Prison programme. The puppies are being trained by low security prisoners to help people in the community living with disabilities. The puppies help prepare the prisoners for life outside prison as well as learning around 90 tasks to help their future owners. They live with the women in self care units at the prison and even attend rehabilitation and education programmes with them. The puppies spend a year with the prisoners, before returning to the community for advanced training.\n\nIn 2010 Corrections Minister, Judith Collins said an additional 2270 prison beds would be needed by 2019 to cope with forecast growth in prisoner numbers and to replace aging existing prisons. In response, the Government announced that the Department of Corrections proposed the establishment of a new men's prison with 1060 beds on undeveloped land adjacent to the Auckland Region Women's Corrections Facility at 20 Hautu Drive, Wiri, Manukau City.\n\nEnvironment Minister Nick Smith established a board of inquiry to fast-track the building of the new prison allowing it to bypass the usual resource consents process which is subject to appeals in the Environment Court. After a three-week hearing in May 2011, the inquiry gave Corrections the go ahead to build the prison. A few months later, justice sector forecasts showed a drop in the projected prison population - for the first time ever. Prime Minister John Key then commented that the new prison at Wiri may no longer be needed but also said it might still be built so that 'older prisons may be retired'.\n\nThe contract to build and manage a new 960-bed prison was eventually award to Serco in 2012. It provided stiff financial penalties if its rehabilitation programmes fail to reduce reoffending by 10% more than the Corrections Department programmes. The Auckland South Corrections Facility was opened on 8 May 2015. The contract to operate the prison ends in 2040.\n\nSpring Hill Corrections Facility is in the countryside between Meremere and Te Kauwhata, in the Waikato. It opened in 2007 and was the last of four new facilities built as part of the Regional Prisons Development Project. It accommodates up to 1,018 male prisoners with low to high-medium security classifications. In the course of construction, the cost of the prison escalated to $380.3 million (at $600,000 a bed), $97.7 million over its original estimate.\n\nThe Department made the unusual step of spending $7.5 million buying and shipping earthmoving equipment from overseas to complete the prison. It says it was caught short by the national building boom and was unable to find the equipment in New Zealand. The Department bought eleven 40-tonne all-terrain dump trucks from Scotland, five compactors from America and France and two excavators from South Korea. When Otago's new Milton prison also cost $43.1 million more than the Department had forecast, Corrections Minister Damien O'Connor subsequently asked Treasury and the State Services Commission (SSC) to carry out an independent review of prison cost blowouts.\n\nSpringhill has New Zealand's only Pacific Focus Unit, which provides an environment where prisoners of Pacific ethnicity with a high risk of re-offending are encouraged to address their offending behaviours. Spring Hill also has a combined drug treatment and special treatment unit called Puna Tatari. The special treatment unit provides treatment for serious offenders with a high risk of re-offending who have been convicted of at least one violent offence.\n\nSpring Hill was also the scene of the manslaughter of prison officer Jason Palmer. This was the first death of a New Zealand prison officer on active duty.\n\nWaikeria Prison is located 16 kilometres south of Te Awamutu, at Waikeria in the Waikato region. It was built in 1911 and held 1031 prisoners and employed 480 staff. It used to be New Zealand's largest prison. However, in 2012, the Government announced that some older prisons would close including units at Waikeria.\n\nThe prison includes several specialist units. It has one of the five Māori Focus Units in New Zealand prisons. The Māori Focus Units aim to bring about positive changes in offenders' thinking and behaviour through the practice of Māori values and disciplines, and specialist Māori programmes. Waikeria also has a Drug Treatment Unit for prisoners with drug or alcohol problems and a Special Treatment Unit (Karaka Special Treatment Unit) which is a 40-bed treatment unit for men who have repeatedly committed serious crimes and are considered to have a high risk of re-offending.\n\nBecause Waikeria Prison is a large site, the level of physical security varies between different units. The minimum security areas of the prison have fewer physical security feature because minimum security prisoners have been assessed as a minimal risk to the public. Higher security units are surrounded by a highly secure perimeter fence equipped with lighting, surveillance and detection equipment.\n\nTongariro/Rangipo Prison began as a prison camp called Rangipo in Turangi in 1922. When it started the few inmates were housed in tents, the cookhouse was the only building with corrugated iron roof and walls. To access the site with materials and officers they had to be transported across Lake Taupo to Wihi, near Tokaanu. Then travel by bullock wagon to Rangipo. The Hautu prison site was established in 1926, and the 2 prison camps became combined to be called Tongariro Prison 1958 / 59, a separate entity in 1977. The prison is on a large site of more than 8,000 hectares off the Desert Road near Turangi. Around 4200 hectares of this land is forested and 2400 hectares is farmed. The remaining 1840 hectares are roads, river reserves, wetlands and native forest. The prison holds about 600 prisoners classified as minimum to low-medium security and 251 staff. Given its size, the Department says it is not possible to surround the Tongariro/Rangipo Prison site with razor wire fencing but units within the prison grounds are said to be appropriately fenced. In 1998, 204 cannabis plants, with an estimated street value of almost $1 million, were found growing at the prison - although the Department denies the crop was grown by prisoners.\nIn July 2011, a former Rangipo Prison guard Manu Stanley Jensen, was sentenced to 16 months in jail after accepting a bribe to supply cannabis to a prisoner.\n\nTongariro/Rangipo has one of the five Māori Focus Units in New Zealand prisons. The Māori Focus Units aim to bring about positive changes in offenders' thinking and behaviour through the practice of Māori values and disciplines, and specialist Māori programmes. The prison also has a strong relationship with local iwi and a special relationship with the surrounding hapu - Ngati Turamakina, Ngāti Tūrangitukua, Ngati Rongomai and Ngati Hine. Representatives of the hapu meet bi-monthly with the Prison Manager. In 2000, a 25-year-old prisoner Aupai Bruce Tohu drowned after the waka he was on capsized in choppy weather while taking part in a Maori cultural training course. Two years earlier, Rangipo prisoner Matthew Neave, aged 30, also drowned after parachuting into Lake Taupo.\n\nIn 2001, the health and safety coordinator for the Corrections Association, Brian Davies, issued a report claiming that the use of buckets as toilets was unhygienic and disgusting both for prisoners and guards. The report said this and other issues were among urgent problems that need fixing in rundown prisons - and cited Rangipo prison as one of the worst offenders.\nWhen Corrections Minister Anne Tolley announced prison closures in 2012, some units at Rangipo were included in this announcement.\n\nHawke's Bay Regional Prison, originally called Mangaroa, is located near Hastings. It opened in October 1989, replacing the old Napier Prison, which closed in 1993. Mangaroa holds about 640 prisoners and has 325 staff. Hawke's Bay Regional Prison has one of the five Māori Focus Units in New Zealand prisons. The Māori Focus Units aim to bring about positive changes in offenders' thinking and behaviour through the practice of Māori values and disciplines, and specialist Māori programmes. It has a Drug Treatment Unit for prisoners with drug or alcohol problems.\n\nThe prison also had one of New Zealand's three Youth Units which accommodates prisoners under the age of 18 and prisoners aged 18–19 who are deemed to be vulnerable in the mainstream prison environment. The Department says youth prisoners are offered a range of psychological, educational and vocational training and claims it meets its obligations under the Education Act 1989 - which requires all under-16-year-olds to be in full-time education. However, Judith Baragwanath, a Parole Board member and former teacher says 92% of teenage offenders in the Youth Units have a learning disability and tutors employed by the Department of Corrections to teach in the Youth Units are not subject to any accredited professional teaching standards. She also says the Youth Units have never been subject to scrutiny by the Education Review Office.\n\nThe Youth Unit was closed in 2011 after a disturbance by two 17-year-olds in which one of them threw boiling water over an officer, and stabbing the Officer. The inmates caused considerable damage and 11 months later, the unit was still not back in use and no decision had been made on when it would reopen.\n\nWhanganui Prison, in Kaitoke, holds about 538 prisoners and employs 252 staff. The oldest part of the prison, the main Kaitoke Prison complex, was built in 1978, and Te Ohorere, a Self Care Unit, and Te Whakataa minimum security units opened in 2005. Self-care units allow prisoners to get accustomed to living in a house or flat environment within the prison fences; they are designed to give prisoners the opportunity to learn and practise the skills they will need to live independently after release.\n\nWhanganui Prison has one of the five Māori Focus Units in New Zealand prisons. The Māori Focus Units aim to bring about positive changes in offenders' thinking and behaviour through the practice of Māori values and disciplines, and specialist Māori programmes.\n\nWhanganui Prison also has a stand-alone 12-cell at-risk facility to deal with suicidal inmates. Only two prisons in New Zealand have units specifically designed for this purpose. The other is at Waikeria and houses up to 30 prisoners in 26 cells.\n\nManawatu Prison holds about 290 prisoners and employs 136 staff. It is located at Linton, south of Palmerston North. The prison began as the Manawatu Youth Institution in 1979 for young male prisoners motivated to make use of the institution's educational, social development, trade training and community-based programmes. It became Manawatu Prison in 1985.\n\nManawatu prison has a voluntary faith based unit known as the Alpha Unit. The Unit is based on the spiritual values of the Christian faiths and it provides a supportive environment committed to the Principles, Values and Attitudes programme. The programme is run by the prison chaplain and prisoners volunteer to reside in it.\n\nRimutaka Prison is located in the suburb of Trentham, Upper Hutt. It is New Zealand's largest prison, holding up to 1078 prisoners and employing about 570 staff. The prison opened in 1967 and was originally named Wi Tako Prison until the name was changed to Rimutaka Prison circa 1990. It is on a large site at the end of Freyberg Road and the number of cells and prison units has grown substantially in recent years to accommodate rising prisoner numbers. In 2010, Rimutaka became the first prison in New Zealand to open a container-cell unit. The cells are constructed from refurbished shipping containers and the unit houses up to 60 prisoners in a mix of single and double-bunked cells.\n\nRimutaka Prison includes several specialist rehabilitation units. It has one of the five Māori Focus Units in New Zealand prisons, a Drug Treatment Unit for prisoners with drug or alcohol problems. A Faith-Based Unit providing a programme for prisoners centred around the Christian faith was closed in 2012 after evaluation found it had no impact on reducing reoffending.\n\nRimutaka also has a 30-bed special treatment unit for violent prisoners called Te Whare Manaakitanga. Prisoners in this unit are taught skills to enable them to live without using violence; this includes conflict resolution, the use of timeout, impulse control and how to challenge their own distorted thinking. The prisoners also learn to change their attitudes towards women. Offenders have to be classified as having a high risk of re-offending in order to attend this programme.\n\nRimutaka prison opened the country's first dementia unit in December 2012. The Corrections Department said a \"high dependency unit\" will be created for some of the 120 inmates aged over 65 who struggle with daily tasks, such as showering themselves. Wellington lawyer Mary More, who represents a 75-year-old prisoner believes the unit is long overdue and said: \"The Department of Corrections needs to recognise that the courts are sending more and more people to prison for longer ... and we are going to have an aging prison population.\"\n\nArohata Prison is one of New Zealand's three women's prisons and is located near Tawa, north of Wellington. The Māori-language name \"Arohata\" means \"the bridge\"; it reflects the belief that the prison provides a bridge between past offending and a future in the community. The prison was built in 1944 and was originally a women's borstal. It became a youth prison in 1981 and a women's prison in 1987. It holds about 150 prisoners and employs 73 staff.\n\nThe prison includes a Drug Treatment Unit, established in 1999, for prisoners with drug or alcohol problems and is the only women's prison that operates a DTU. Women from Christchurch or Auckland women's prisons who have addictions have to move to Arohata prison to take part in the programme.\n\nArohata also runs the Kowhiritanga ('Making Choices') Rehabilitation Programme specifically for female prisoners many of whom have been exposed to sexual and psychological abuse during childhood and in their adult relationships. Most of the programme is based on cognitive-behavioural therapy, dialectical behaviour therapy, group psychotherapy, recreational psychology and a narrative approach to therapy. A Toastmasters group and other volunteers have helped implement a variety of programs such as yoga, quilting, Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, the Catholic-based grief \"Seasons for Growth\" programme, public speaking skills, and a kitten fostering programme.\n\nChristchurch Prison, also known as Paparua Prison, is located near Paparua to the west of Christchurch. It was built in 1925 and accommodates about 930 prisoners. The prison includes a Drug Treatment Unit for prisoners with drug and alcohol problems as well as a Youth Unit for prisoners under 18 years old.\n\nIn September 2010 and 2011, Christchurch was hit by two major earthquakes. The prison suffered no major damage from the first quake but about half of the 800 inmates were moved as a precaution after it affected the prison's plumbing systems. Some were taken by bus to Otago Correctional Facility and others were flown to prisons in the North Island. Those inmates left behind were required to put together ration packs and prepare meals for rescuers.\n\nAfter the second quake in February 2011, a decision was made to move prisoners from Christchurch's Rolleston prison to Christchurch Men's prison, emptying 320 beds to create accommodation for the influx of rescuers into the city.\n\nChristchurch Women's Prison is one of three female prisons in New Zealand. It is located near Paparua to the west of Christchurch and holds 138 prisoners and employs 70 staff. The prison opened in 1974 when prisoners and staff transferred to the site from Dunedin Prison and Christchurch Prison's Women's Division. The prison remains the only women's prison in the South Island.\n\nThe prison provides the Kowhiritanga ('Making Choices') rehabilitation programme designed to address the particular needs of female offenders – many of whom have suffered sexual abuse during childhood and in their current relationships.\n\nThe prison has nine Self-Care Units where longer-serving prisoners may be eligible to spend time as they near release. These are residential-style units inside the prison that let prisoners get used to living in a flatting type environment and give prisoners an opportunity to learn and practise the skills they will need to live independently after release. The Living Skills Programme is also delivered in the Self-Care Units and some prisoners participate on the Release to Work programme.\n\nIn 2011 a unit at the prison was upgraded allowing female prisoners to live with their babies for up to two years as part of a 2008 law change extending the time a baby can stay with a gaoled mother from nine months. The upgrade allows four mothers and their babies to live together.\n\nRolleston prison is located at Walkers Rd in Rolleston, south-west of Christchurch. It was originally established in 1958 as an army detention centre. It was first used as a prison in 1986 when the new Corrective Training Centre was built called the Tawa unit.\n\nThe prison was extensively renovated in 1987 to increase capacity and in 1989 the 60 bed Kia Marama unit opened - one of only two such units in the country. The unit delivers group-based treatment within a therapeutic environment to child sex offenders. The programme helps prisoners look at their patterns of behaviour and identify high-risk situations. Evaluations have shown that the programme is very effective in reducing re-offending. In 1992 the 60 bed Kowhai unit opened and an additional two units have been completed since then. Rolleston now holds about 320 male prisoners and employs 93 staff.\n\nBecause Rolleston Prison contains prisoners assessed as being of minimal risk to the public, the level of physical security is lower than would be found at many other prisons. It does not have a perimeter fence. Instead, individual units have their own secure fencing and the prison has electronic security devices around the perimeter. Older units at Rolleston are set to close as part of the Department's decision to close down older prisons and build a new 960 bed prison for males at Wiri.\n\nOtago Corrections Facility (OCF) is located near Milton. It opened in 2007 and was one of four new prisons that opened between 2005 and 2007. OCF was intended to hold about 425 male prisoners and employ 201 staff. When double bunking was introduced at OCF in 2010, inmate numbers rose to 480.\n\nThe prison provides three rehabilitation programmes. The Medium Intensity Rehabilitation Programme is designed for prisoners in the middle risk range – those not considered high risk but still enough of a risk to warrant rehabilitation. The Short Rehabilitation Programme is a brief rehabilitation programme aimed at a smaller number of prisoners who require rehabilitation but do not have enough time in their sentence to complete a longer programme. OCF also has a Drug Treatment Unit for prisoners with drug and alcohol problems.\n\nInvercargill Prison, in Invercargill, holds about 165 prisoners. Built in 1910, the prison operated as a borstal until 1981. In 2012 a rehabilitation programme was introduced at Invercargill Prison. A decision was made to run the Medium Intensity Rehabilitation Programme after the Corrections Department recognised there was a sufficient number of prisoners in need of such a programme. Corrections rehabilitation and reintegration services regional manager Steve Berry said programme facilitators from the Otago Corrections Facility would travel from Dunedin four times a week for 13 weeks.\n\nThere are four youth correctional facilities, termed youth justice residences, located in Auckland, Rotorua, Palmerston North and Christchurch. Only the Auckland facility is licensed to take young offenders sentenced to imprisonment under the Sentencing Act 2002; the other three only take young offenders sentenced to residence under the Child, Young Persons and Their Families Act 1989. All youth justice residences are operated by Child, Youth and Family.\n\nLocated in the Christchurch suburb of Addington, the prison was built in 1874 under the guidance of Benjamin W. Mountfort, who also designed the Christchurch Cathedral, the Canterbury Museum and the Canterbury Provincial Council Chambers. Addington Prison was closed in 1999.\n\nThe Mountfort cell block and remaining perimeter walls are scheduled as a protected item, for historical and architectural reasons, in the Christchurch City Plan. It has been converted into a budget backpackers known as Jailhouse Accommodation.\n\nDunedin Prison was built (completed) in 1896 and operated until 2007 when all prison services in the region were shifted to the new Otago Corrections Facility near Milton.\n\nNapier Prison opened in 1862 on Bluff Hill in Napier. It closed in 1993, with prisoners transferring to Hawke's Bay Regional Prison.\n\nNew Plymouth Prison used to hold up to 112 minimum to high-medium security prisoners and employed 65 staff. The prison also accommodated offenders on remand. The prison was originally an army hospital in the 1860s during the Taranaki land wars. The site was converted to a prison later that decade and has been in use ever since. It is the oldest operational penal institution in New Zealand. In 2012, Corrections Minister, Anne Tolley announced it would be closed \"because old prisons didn't suit modern rehabilitation training and education methods.\" It closed in 2013.\n\nWellington Prison, also known as Mount Crawford, used to hold about 120 prisoners and employed 35 custodial staff. It was built in 1927 next to the suburb of Miramar in Wellington and replaced the original Terrace Gaol in central Wellington. The prison only accommodated prisoners who were on voluntary segregation – prisoners who have asked to be separated from the mainstream prison population.\n\nThe Wellington prison was temporarily closed in June 2008 during a \"seasonal prison population trough\", however it reopened in July 2009 when the national prison population increased once again.

It functions as the central airport for the cities of Irapuato, Guanajuato, León, Salamanca and San Miguel de Allende\n\nIn its original Nahuatl, it was called \"Tzinacua\" by the Otomi and Purépecha natives. \"Tzinacua\" loosely translates into 'place of dense fog', derived from the quantity of thermal waters surrounding the area. In the Otomi language its name is \"Tsinäkua\" that also means 'place of dense fog'.\n\nIn the place where Silao now sits, there was an Otomí settlement that was conquered by the Purépecha tribe. It then received the name Tzinacua, that in English means \"place of dense fog\", because in the area of Comanjilla, there were columns of water vapor rising from thermal springs. The name evolved to 'Sinaua', 'Silagua' and finally 'Silao'.\n\nSilao is located in the Mexican state of Guanajuato. It is situated 100° 25´ 59´´ longitude west of the Greenwich meridian and 20° 56´ 24´´ latitude north.

Sher Shah defeated \"badshah-i-Hind\" ('Hindustani emperor') Humayun in the Battle of Chausa (26 June 1539) and again in the Battle of Bilgram (17 May 1540).\n\nSher Shah Suri was known for the destruction of some old cities while conquering parts of India. He has been accused by `Abd al-Qadir Bada'uni and other Muslim historians for destroying old cities in order to build new ones on their ruins after his own name. One example included Shergarh. Sher Shah is also said to have destroyed Dinpanah, which Humayun was constructing as the \"sixth city of Delhi\". The new city built by him, was itself destroyed in 1555 after Humayun re-conquered the territory from the Surs. Tarikh-i-Da'udi states, however, that he destroyed Siri. Abbas Sarwani states that he had the older city of Delhi destroyed. Tarikh-i-Khan Jahan states that Salim Shah Suri had built a wall around Humayun's imperial city.\n\nThe Sur dynasty held control of nearly all the Mughal territories, from modern-day eastern Afghanistan in the west to modern-day Bangladesh in the east.\n\nDuring the almost 17-year rule of the Sur dynasty, until the return of the Mughals to the throne, the region of the South Asia witnessed much economic development and many administrative reforms. A systematised relationship was created between the people and the ruler, minimising corruption and the oppression of the public.\n\nTheir rule came to an end by a defeat that led to restoration of the Mughal Empire.\n\n"}
{"id": "2251878", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2251878", "title": "Injo of Joseon", "text": "Injo of Joseon\n\nInjo of Joseon (7 December 1595 – 17 June 1649, r. 1623–1649) was the sixteenth king of the Joseon dynasty in Korea. He was the grandson of Seonjo and son of Grand Prince Jeongwon (정원군). King Injo was king during both the first and second Manchu invasions, which ended with the surrender of Joseon to the Qing dynasty in 1636.\n\nKing Injo was born in 1595 as a son of Grandprince Jeongwon, whose father was the ruling monarch King Seonjo. In 1607, Grandprince Jeongwon's son was given the title, Prince Neungyang (綾陽都正, 능양도정) and later Grand Prince Neungyang (綾陽君, 능양군); and lived as a royal family member, unsupported by any political factions that were in control of Korean politics at the time.\n\nIn 1608, King Seonjo fell sick and died, and his son, Gwanghaegun, succeeded him to the throne. At the time, the government was divided by various political factions; and the liberal Eastern political faction came out strong after the Seven Year War, which most actively fought against Japanese. The Eastern faction split during the last days of King Seonjo in the Northern and Southern political factions. The Northern faction wanted radical reform, while the Southern faction supported moderate reform. At the time of Seonjo's death, the Northern faction, who gained control of the government at the time, was divided into left-wing Greater Northerners and less radical Lesser Northerners. As Gwanghaegun inherited the throne, the Greater Northern political faction, which supported him as heir to the crown, became the major political faction in the royal court. Meanwhile, conservative Western political faction remained a minor faction, far from gaining power; however many members of the Western faction continued to look for opportunities to return to politics as the ruling faction.\n\nAlthough King Gwanghaegun (光海君, 광해군) was an outstanding administrator and great diplomat, he was largely unsupported by many politicians, scholars, and aristocrats because he was not the first-born and he was born of a concubine. Greater Northerners tried to stomp out those opinions, suppressing Lesser Northerners and killing Prince Imhae (臨海君, 임해군), the oldest son of Seonjo, and Grand Prince Yeongchang (永昌大君, 영창대군), the queen's son. It was not Gwanghaegun's plan to keep his throne; and in fact, he actually tried to bring minor factions into the government, but was blocked by opposition from members of the Greater Northerners, such as Jeong In-hong and Yi Icheom. The actions made Gwanghaegun even more unpopular among wealthy aristocrats, and they finally began plotting against him.\n\nIn 1623, members of the ultra-conservative Westerners faction, Kim Ja-jeom, Kim Ryu, Yi Gwi and Yi Gwal, launched a coup that resulted in the dethroning of Gwanghaegun, who was sent into exile on Jeju Island. Jeong In-hong and Yi Yicheom were killed, and followed suddenly by the Westerners replacing the Greater Northerners as the ruling political faction. The Westerners brought Injo to the palace and crowned him as the new King of Joseon. Although Injo was king, he did not have any authority since almost all of the power was held by the Western faction that dethroned Gwanghaegun.\n\nYi Gwal thought he was treated unfairly and received too small reward for his role in the coup. In 1624, he rebelled against Injo after being sent to the Northern front as military commander of Pyongyang to fight against the expanding Manchus, while other major leaders of the coup were rewarded with positions in the King's court. Yi Gwal led 12,000 troops, including 100 Japanese (who defected to Joseon during Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)), to the capital, Hanseong, where Yi Gwal defeated a regular army under the command of General Jang Man and surrounded Hanseong in what is known as the Battle of Jeotan. Injo fled to Gongju, and Hanseong fell into the hands of the rebels.\n\nOn February 11, 1624, Yi Gwal enthroned Prince Heungan (興安君, 흥안군) as the new king; however, General Jang Man soon came back with another regiment and defeated Yi Gwal's forces. The Korean army recaptured the capital soon after, and Yi Gwal was murdered by his bodyguard, which resulted in the end of the rebellion. Even though Injo was able to keep his throne, the rebellion displayed the weaknesses of royal authority, while asserting the superiority of the aristocrats, who had gained even more power by the fighting against the rebellion. The economy, which was experiencing a slight recovery from Gwanghaegun's reconstruction, was once again ruined and Korea would remain in a poor economic state for a few centuries.\n\nKing Gwanghaegun, who was considered a wise diplomat, kept his neutral policy between the Chinese Ming Dynasty, which was Joseon's traditional ally, and the growing Manchus. However, following the fall of Gwanghaegun, conservative Westerners took hard-line policy toward the Manchus, keeping their alliance with Ming Dynasty. The Manchus, who had up until that time remained mostly friendly to Joseon, began to regard Joseon as an enemy. Han Yun, who participated in the rebellion of Yi Gwal, fled to Manchuria and urged the Manchu leader Nurhaci to attack Joseon; thus the friendly relationship between Manchu and Korea ended.\n\nIn 1627, 30,000 Manchu cavalry under General Amin (阿敏) and former Korean General Gang Hong-rip invaded Joseon, calling for restoration of Gwanghaegun and execution of Westerners leaders, including Kim Ja-jeom. General Jang Man again fought against the Manchus, but was unable to repel the invasion. Once again, Injo fled to Ganghwa Island. Meanwhile, the Manchus had no reason to attack Korea and decided to go back to prepare for war against China, and peace soon settled. Later, Qing and Joseon were declared brother nations and the Manchus withdrew from Korea. The war is called first Manchu invasion of Korea.\n\nHowever, most Westerners kept their hard-line policy despite the war. Nurhaci, who had generally good opinion toward Korea, did not invade Korea again; however, when Nurhaci died and Hong Taiji succeeded him as ruler of the Manchus, the Manchus again began to seek for chance for another war. King Injo provided refuge to Ming General Mao Wenrong and with his unit, after they fled from the Manchus and came to Korea; this action caused the Manchus to invade Korea once again.\n\nIn 1636, Hong Taiji officially called his nation the Qing dynasty, and proceeded to invade Joseon personally. The Manchu purposely avoided battle with General Im Gyeong Eop, a prominent Joseon army commander who was guarding the Uiju Fortress at the time. A Manchurian army of 128,000 men marched directly into Hanseong before Injo could escape to Ganghwa Island, driving Injo to Namhan Mountain Fortress instead. Running out of food and supplies after the Manchu managed to cut all supply lines, Injo finally surrendered to the Qing dynasty ceremoniously bowing to the Hong Taiji nine times as Hong Taiji's servant, and agreeing to the Treaty of Samjeondo, which required Injo's first and second son to be taken to China as captives. \n\nJoseon then became a tributary state to the Qing Dynasty, and the Qing went on to conquer the Ming Dynasty in 1644.\n\nAfter Qing conquered Beijing in 1644, the two princes returned to Korea. Injo's first son, Crown Prince Sohyeon, brought many new products from the western world, including Christianity, and urged Injo for reform. However, the conservative Injo would not accept the opinion; and persecuted the Crown Prince for attempting to modernize Korea by bringing in Catholicism and Western science.\n\nThe Crown Prince was mysteriously found dead in the King's room, bleeding severely from the head. Legends say that Injo killed his own son with an ink slab that Sohyeon brought from China; however, some historians suggest he was poisoned by the fact that he had black spots all over his body after his death and that his body decomposed rapidly. Many, including his wife, tried to uncover what happened but Injo ordered immediate burial and greatly reduced the grandeur of the practice of Crown Prince's funeral. King Injo even shortened the funeral period for his son.\n\nKing Injo appointed Grand Prince Bongrim as new Crown Prince (who later became King Hyojong) rather than Prince Sohyeon's oldest son, Prince Gyeongseon. Soon after, Injo ordered the exile of Prince Sohyeon's three sons to Jeju Island (from which only the youngest son, Prince Gyeongan, returned to the mainland alive) and the execution of Sohyeon's wife, Crown Princess Minhoe, for treason.\n\nToday, Injo is mostly regarded as a weak, indecisive and unstable ruler; for he caused the Yi Gwal Rebellion, two wars with the Manchus, and a devastation of the economy. He is often compared to his predecessor, Gwanghaegun, who accomplished many things and was dethroned, while Injo had almost no achievements during his reign and was still given a temple name. Blamed for not taking care of his kingdom, many people regard King Injo as the model for politicians not to follow; yet, he is credited for reforming the military and expanding the defense of the nation to prepare for war, since the nation had several military conflicts from 1592 to 1636. Injo died in 1649. His tomb is located in Paju, Gyeonggi-do.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Moon Hill is part of the Guilin Mountains. It is so named for a wide, semicircular hole through the hill, all that remains of what was once a limestone cave formed in the phreatic zone. Like most formations in the region, it is karst. It is also a popular tourist attraction. \n\nIt takes roughly 20 minutes to climb up to the arch (about 800 steps), or considerably longer for those who wish to reach the summit. Visitors must pay an entrance fee in order to climb the hill. Souvenir and refreshment vendors often follow climbers up and down the path.\n\nIn addition to a concrete tourist path which passes through the arch, and a somewhat rougher, steeper path leading to the summit above the arch, Moon Hill has several rock climbing routes and it has also been used for abseils in several adventure races.\n\nMoon Hill offers broad panoramic views of the surrounding countryside which is characterized by the knobby karst hills found throughout the region.\n\nThe Moon Hill is located to the south of Yangshuo across the Jingbao river along China National Highway 321. It has an elevation of , while the hill is in relative height and in length. The arch is about 50 meters in height.\n\nMoon hill had a two year climbing ban recently lifted. The climbing ban, which went into effect in the first half of 2017, was in place due to a security guard on the viewing deck nearly being hit on the head with a piece of falling debris. \n\n"}

(English: \"Why did I fall in love?\") is a 2005 Indian Hindi romantic comedy film directed by David Dhawan. It stars Salman Khan, Sushmita Sen, Katrina Kaif and Sohail Khan in lead roles, with Arshad Warsi, Beena Kak, Rajpal Yadav and Isha Koppikar in supporting roles. Arbaaz Khan made a guest appearance in the movie. The film is about the relationships of a womanizing doctor who gets ultimately stuck between two women: a patient with suicidal tendencies and his nurse.\n\nIt is based on the 1969 movie \"Cactus Flower\" which itself was inspired by a famous French play \"Fleur de cactus\" by Pierre Barillet and . The 2011 Hollywood movie \"Just Go with It\" was also based on \"Cactus Flower\". The final airport chase scene in the movie was inspired by the one in the Friends finale. \n\nSamir (Salman Khan) is a very successful doctor: He not only looks after his patients' maladies, but he also looks after his female patients' hearts. Most women fall for him and his irresistible charms. The only person who has not fallen for him is his dutiful nurse Naina (Sushmita Sen).\n\nWhenever a girl gets too close to Samir and starts talking about marriage, he sends her off by telling her he is already married. However, one day, he meets Sonia (Katrina Kaif), a beautiful young woman and Samir are smitten. He lies to her about having a wife, but the marriage is failing. When she learns of his 'wife', she wants to meet her. Samir introduces Naina, as well as her niece and nephew, as his wife and children.\n\nSamir then arranges a fake divorce from his fake wife with the help of his best friend, lawyer Vicky (Arshad Warsi) who, despite having a steady girlfriend (Isha Koppikar), frequently flirts with Naina. To complicate things further, Samir's mother (Beena Kak) suddenly appears and doesn't want her son get divorced from Naina (when he isn't married to her in the first place). And then, there is Sonia's neighbour Pyare (Sohail Khan), who does not want Sonia to marry Samir: He wants Sonia for his own and she seems to like him, too.\n\nThe web of lies around everyone grows thicker and thicker, but finally, Samir is able to persuade Sonia to marry him. But before the altar, she makes him realize that she isn't the right wife for him; he is in love with Naina who has proved her love since she played along, pretending to be his wife. Samir agrees and rushes to the airport because Naina wants to escape to Canada, while Sonia marries Pyare. At the airport, Samir arrives in time: He convinces Naina to stay and she agrees.\n\n\nThe film grossed Rs.55 Crores. It also emerged as the fifth-highest-grossing film of the year.\n\nThe soundtrack consists of seven original tracks and four remixes. According to the Indian trade website Box Office India, with around 12,50,000 units sold, this film's soundtrack album was the year's fifteenth highest-selling.\n"}

He was drafted by the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League in the second round (55th overall) of the 2005 NFL Draft. He played college football at the University of Miami.\n\nParrish played quarterback at Miami Senior High.\nHe then attended the University of Miami and converted to the wide receiver position and finished his college career with 81 receptions. He is the cousin of NFL running back Branden Oliver.\n\nParrish was also a track star at the University of Miami, where he ran the 60 meters, 100 meters and 200 meters, posting personal bests of 6.89 seconds, 10.65 seconds and 21.13 seconds, respectively.\n\nHe also competed in the 55 meters, posting a personal best time of 6.38 seconds.\n\nThe Buffalo Bills drafted Parrish in the second round (55th overall) during the 2005 NFL Draft.\n\nParrish's NFL career with the Buffalo Bills got off to a slow start, with Parrish missing the first six games due to injury. Parrish played in a limited role for the next 10 games, finishing the 2005 season with 15 receptions for 148 yards (9.9 avg.) and one touchdown. He also returned several punts and kickoffs for the team.\n\nParrish served as the Bills fourth wide receiver. Parrish finished the year with 23 receptions for 320 yards (13.9 avg.) and 2 touchdowns. As a punt returner, Parrish gained 364 yards on 32 attempts (11.4 avg.) and one score. \n\nParrish's finest moment came when he ran back an 82-yard punt return for a touchdown in a win against the Jacksonville Jaguars. In the same game, he caught a 30-yard pass from quarterback J. P. Losman to set up the Bills' game-winning field goal.\n\nParrish returned his first punt return of the season for a touchdown against the Denver Broncos. He became the first player in the 2007 season to score a rushing touchdown, a receiving touchdown, and a punt return touchdown. For the second season in a row, Parrish finished the season with over 300 receiving yards and 360 total return yards, achieving 352 receiving yards on 35 receptions, 440 punt return yards, and 126 kickoff return yards.\n\nIn the Bills seasons opener against the Seattle Seahawks, Parrish returned a punt return 63 yards for a touchdown. His return stats ultimately declined this year as he shared return responsibilities with rookie cornerback Leodis McKelvin. He caught 24 passes for 232 yards, receiving his lone touchdown against the Oakland Raiders to help the Bills win 24–23.\n\nParrish's role as a receiver decreased in 2009 as the Bills signed superstar receiver Terrell Owens in the off-season, as he only caught 3 passes for 44 yards. Parrish had a notable blunder during a game against the Cleveland Browns, muffing a punt in the fourth quarter that set up the Browns' game-winning field goal in a low-scoring 6–3 affair.\n\nAfter the departures of both Owens and Josh Reed in free agency, Parrish resumed his role as a prominent receiver for the Bills. In just 8 games, he caught a career-high 400 receiving yards on 33 catches with two touchdowns before suffering a season-ending hand injury against the Chicago Bears that would require surgery. In week 2 of the following season, Parrish was injured again after catching his first and only reception of the year for 16 yards. The Bills placed him on injured reserve for the second year in a row.\n\nOn April 3, 2012, Parrish signed with the San Diego Chargers, but was released as of August 27, 2012.\n\nLater that same day, Parrish was signed by the Oakland Raiders, who needed a returner to fill in for a hurt Jacoby Ford. However, in the following preseason game against the Seattle Seahawks, Parrish fumbled both punt return attempts, did not see the field again, and was cut the following day.\n\nOn September 25, 2012, Parrish was signed by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to replace Jordan Shipley as the team's kick returner. He retired after this season, finishing his career with over 1,500 receiving yards and nearly 2,700 return yards.\n\nOn August 12, 2019, Parrish was arrested in Fort Lauderdale, Florida with criminal charges of stalking and written threats to kill. He had allegedly begun harassing a former girlfriend and her daughter after the relationship ended in July 2018.\n\n"}

The group has programs focusing on renewable energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Launched in 2004, the organization operates globally with offices in the UK (headquarters), the United States and India.\n\nIt acts as the secretariat for the Under2 Coalition, an alliance of state and regional governments around the world that are committed to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero levels by 2050. As of 2017, the Under2 Coalition brings together over 205 governments from 43 countries, representing 1.3 billion people and almost 40% of the global economy.\n\nThe organization's business initiatives \"RE100\", \"EP100\" and \"EV100\", which are run as part of the We Mean Business coalition, aim to grow corporate demand for renewable energy, energy productivity and electric transport, accelerating the transition to a zero-emissions economy, while helping leading businesses to reduce carbon emissions, be more resilient and increase profits.\n\nOther projects past and present include the LED \"LightSavers\" global trials which took place in cities such as New York City, Hong Kong and Kolkata; the Climate Principles project, under which financial institutions (including Credit Agricole, HSBC, Standard Chartered, Swiss Re, F&C Asset Management and BNP Paribas) agree to consider climate change when structuring their service and product offerings; the States and Regions Alliance, designed to encourage state, provincial and city government climate change initiatives; and numerous publications assessing and promoting the potential value of low carbon technologies and policies.\n\nIt has partnered on initiatives and reports with organisations including the Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSi), International Emissions Trading Association (IETA), CDP, the Global Infrastructure Basel Foundation, the New York Academy of Sciences, the United Nations Foundation, the German Marshall Fund, the Office of Tony Blair and the World Business Council on Sustainable Development.\n\nThe Climate Group hosts international summits and events, including Climate Week NYC in New York City, a week-long global forum promoting global climate action, and the India Energy Access Summit in New Delhi.\n\nThe Climate Group was incorporated in 2003 and launched in 2004 by ex-CEO and co-founder Steve Howard together with ex-Chief Operating Officer Jim Walker and former Communications Director Alison Lucas. It evolved from research led by the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and was established to encourage more major companies and sub-national governments to take action on climate change. To join, a company or government had to sign the organization's leadership principles. Former UK prime minister Tony Blair has supported the group since launch and has appeared at a number of the organization's events.\n\nThe Climate Group's international network of States and Regions included a number of prominent leaders of sub-national governments that have been or are involved in its policy work in developing renewable energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. These include or have included Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond; Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones; Prince Albert of Monaco; former Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger; former Premier of Manitoba Gary Doer; former Premier of Quebec Jean Charest; former Premier of South Australia Mike Rann and President of Poitou Charentes, Segolene Royal. In successive years Schwarzenegger, Charest and Salmond each received The Climate Group's international climate leadership award from Co-Chair Mike Rann. Its network has included over 80 of the world's largest companies and governments (including, for example, the City of New York, Miami, Los Angeles, the State of California, most Canadian and Australian provinces and the City of London).\n\nIn 2011, Mark Kenber, previously deputy-CEO, took over from Steve Howard as CEO. He resigned from the post in 2016.\n\nIn 2017, Helen Clarkson became CEO.\n\nThe Climate Group states that it functions independently of any corporate and government entities. It funds its work from a variety of revenue streams. The organization's 2004 launch was supported primarily by philanthropic organizations including the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, the DOEN Foundation, the John D and Catherine T MacArthur Foundation and the Esmee Fairbairn Foundation. The organization's 2007-2008 annual report indicated that over 75% of its funding at the time was from philanthropic donations, foundations and other non-governmental organizations, as well as from the now-discontinued philanthropic HSBC Climate Partnership.\n\nUntil recently, business and government members paid to be members of The Climate Group, and that funding accounted for approximately 20 per cent of the organization's operating budget. Many of its programmes are carried out in partnership with members, whose sponsorship is often the primary source of revenue for those individual programs. The Climate Group states that overall strategy is driven by staff - sometimes in consultation with members - and approved by its board, and that there is no link between membership and governance of the organisation.\n\nIn 2007, HSBC announced that The Climate Group, along with WWF, Earthwatch, and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, would be a partner in the HSBC Climate Partnership, and donated US$100 million to fund joint work - the largest-ever single corporate philanthropic donation to the environment. The results of this program can be seen in HSBC's 2010 Partnership Review, and HSBC's \"Clean Cities film\" of December 2010. The Clean Cities film specifically outlines some of The Climate Group's achievements enabled by this program, including LED pilots in New York, clean technology finance in Mumbai, consumer campaigns in London and cutting employee carbon footprints in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Climate Group publishes research reports that seek to highlight the opportunities that clean energy can provide in terms of both economic growth and decreased emissions. Some include:\n\n\nThe Climate Group spearheads and supports several projects, campaigns and summits. They include:\n\nUnder2 Coalition\n\nThe Climate Group acts as Secretariat to the Under2 Coalition and works directly with government signatories and partners of the Under2 MOU to drive net-zero ambition and action. The Under2 MOU is a commitment by sub-national governments to reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions toward net-zero by 2050. Central to this is the public commitment by all signatories to reduce their GHG emissions by 80-95% on 1990 levels, or 2 metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent per capita, by 2050. As of 2017, the Under2 Coalition brings together 205 governments from 43 countries representing 1.3 billion people and almost 40% of the global economy who have committed to reduce GHG emissions towards net-zero by 2050.\n\nLED Scale-up\n\nThis project aims to accelerate widespread adoption of LED (light-emitting diode) lighting technology. The programs aim is for LED lighting to represent 25% of the global indoor and outdoor lighting market by 2020, reducing electricity use and costs — and associated CO2 emissions — by 50-70%. Demonstration projects are now operating in many cities across the globe including Hong Kong, Shanghai, Kolkata, London, New York and Sydney.\n\nRE100\n\nConvened by The Climate Group in partnership with CDP, RE100 is a global initiative to engage, support and showcase influential companies committed to using 100% renewable power. Companies gain a better understanding of the advantages of being 100% renewable, and benefit from peer-to-peer learning as well as greater public recognition of their ambitions and achievements as they work toward their goals. As of 2017, a total of 100 companies have committed to the campaign.\n\nEP100\n\nEP100 showcases global businesses committed to doubling their energy productivity (EP). EP100, which The Climate Group serves as the Secretariat for, offers a forum for sharing best practices and showcasing the leadership of companies making progress toward bold, public commitments on energy productivity.\n\nEV100\n\nEV100 is a global initiative bringing together companies committed to accelerating the transition to electric vehicles (EVs) and making electric transport the \"new normal\" by 2030. The transport sector is the fastest-growing contributor to climate change, accounting for 23% of global energy-related greenhouse gas emissions. Electric transport offers a solution in cutting millions of tons of greenhouse gas emissions per year, as well as curbing transport related air and noise pollution.\n\nClimate Week NYC, founded in 2009 as a partnership between The Climate Group, the United Nations, the UN Foundation, the City of New York, the Government of Denmark, Tck Tck Tck Campaign and CDP, takes place every year in New York City. The summit takes place alongside the UN General Assembly and brings together international leaders from business, government and civil society to showcase global climate action. Climate Week NYC is the collaborative space for climate-related events in support of the implementation of the Paris Agreement and the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. In 2017, there were 140 events across New York City as part of Climate Week NYC.\n\nThe Climate Group's States and Regions Alliance was underpinned by a recognition of the important role that sub-national governments are playing in tackling climate change on the ground. The UN Development Program estimates that 50-80% of actions required to take limit global temperature rises to two degrees will need to arise from sub-national levels of government. The Climate Group argues that while global negotiations continue to prove difficult, its State and Regions Alliance members, as well as other sub-national governments, play an essential role in building a global climate change deal from the bottom-up.\n\nThrough its States and Regions program, The Climate Group brought heads of sub-national governments together in events such as Cancun's China Day and Climate Leaders Summit 2010. Agreed statements arising from these events, signed by the organization's members, include the Copenhagen Statement of 2009 and the Cancun Statement of 2010. The States and Regions program also facilitated partnerships between developed and developing nation sub-national governments, giving rise to projects such as assessment of regional vulnerability to climate change impacts.\n\n\n"}

The park's primary feature is the Washington & Old Dominion Railroad Trail (abbreviated as W&OD Trail), an asphalt-surfaced paved rail trail that runs through densely populated urban and suburban communities as well as through rural areas. Most of the trail travels on top of the rail bed of the former Washington and Old Dominion Railroad, which closed in 1968.\n\nAlthough the park is long, it is only about wide. The rail trail is approximately wide through much of its length and is a shared use path that is suitable for walking, running, cycling, and roller skating. A crushed bluestone surfaced bridle path travels near the paved trail in the park's most westerly .\n\nNOVA Parks (formerly named the Northern Virginia Regional Park Authority (NVRPA) administers and maintains the park and its trails. NOVA Parks keeps most of the parkland surrounding the trails in a natural state. The park authority has placed alongside the paved trail a series of mile markers and a number of interpretative exhibits that describe the historic and natural features of the park (see Washington and Old Dominion Railroad Stations for locations of historical markers near the W&OD Trail).\n\nThe headquarters office of the park is near the east side of the trail at Smith's Switch Road in Ashburn. A park rest stop is adjacent to the trail near the park's headquarters.\n\nThe W&OD Trail begins in the Nauck neighborhood near the Shirlington section of Arlington County, close to the boundary between the County and the City of Alexandria. The trail ends in Purcellville in western Loudoun County. Its route largely parallels the routes of the Potomac River and Virginia State Route 7 (VA Route 7).\n\nThe trail connects at its origin to the paved Four Mile Run Trail, which travels eastward through Arlington along a stream embankment to meet the Mount Vernon Trail at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, near the Potomac River. The start of the trail is also accessible from the Shirlington exit (Exit 6) of Interstate 395 (I-395) (the Henry G. Shirley Memorial Highway).\nThe trail parallels the more curving and hilly Four Mile Run Trail throughout its route in Arlington. Although they coincide in several locations, the two trails generally travel on opposite sides of the Run. There are no restrooms and few water fountains alongside the W&OD Trail in the County. Restrooms and additional water fountains are available near ball fields and picnic areas along the Four Mile Run Trail.\n\nThe W&OD Trail's trailhead (Mile 0) is at the intersection of South Shirlington Road and South Four Mile Run Drive. The trail starts in the Atlantic Coastal Plain at the trail's lowest elevation: above sea level.\n\nThe trail climbs in while traveling northwest through Arlington County. While in Arlington, the trail ascends through the Atlantic Seaboard fall line while climbing upstream in the valley of Four Mile Run. The trail crosses the Run seven times in the valley on bridges whose abutments were constructed before the Civil War by the Alexandria, Loudoun & Hampshire Railroad, a predecessor of the W&OD Railroad.\nAfter crossing Columbia Pike (VA Route 244), the trail enters a steeply-sloped woodland that covers both sides of the valley. Near the end of the woodland, the trail intersects the Bluemont Junction Trail, a long paved rail trail that travels to Ballston on the bed of a former W&OD Railroad branch that once ran to Rosslyn and Georgetown. past that intersection, the W&OD Trail intersects the Custis Trail, a long paved shared use path that travels along Interstate 66 (I-66) (the Custis Memorial Parkway) to Rosslyn and which provides access to Washington, D.C. and the northern end of the Mount Vernon Trail.\n\nAfter crossing its intersection with the Custis Trail, the W&OD Trail travels northwest near an I-66 soundwall for most of its remaining course in Arlington. After crossing North Sycamore Street, the W&OD Trail passes the East Falls Church station on Washington Metro's Orange and Silver Lines.\n\nAfter leaving the fall line, the W&OD Trail enters the Piedmont plateau region near the west corner of the County. The trail continues to climb in the Piedmont while traveling northwest through the City of Falls Church and Fairfax County. The trail reaches an elevation of at its crossing of I-66 in Fairfax County. When it reaches this point, the trail has risen while traveling .\n\nAfter crossing over I-495 (the Capital Beltway) on a trail bridge and passing Dunn Loring, the trail begins a long descent as it travels through Vienna. After leaving Vienna, the trail continues to descend until it reaches Difficult Run (Mile 14.3), where its elevation of is only about higher than is the elevation at the trail's origin.\nAfter the trail crosses Difficult Run, it ascends and descends between additional streams (including Sugarland Run, Broad Run, Beaverdam Run, Goose Creek, Sycolin Creek and Tuscarora Creek) as it travels further northwest in the Piedmont through or near Reston, Herndon, Sterling, Ashburn, and Leesburg. While traveling through Reston, the trail crosses Wiehle Avenue northeast of the Wiehle–Reston East station on Washington Metro's Silver Line.\n\nWhen crossing Tuscarora Creek in Leesburg, the trail's elevation of is lower than the highest elevation that it reached in Arlington. After crossing that stream, the trail climbs northwest in to reach its highest elevation () while traveling on a bridge carrying VA Route 9 (Charles Town Pike) over VA Route 7 near the saddle point of Clarks Gap in Catoctin Mountain. before this crossing, the trail travels under an old stone arch that formerly carried VA Route 7 over the W&OD Railroad.\n\nThe trail then turns west, descends through Paeonian Springs to Hamilton Station and climbs to reach Purcellville. When the trail terminates in Purcellville, its elevation is above sea level.\n\nWhen the W&OD Railroad closed in 1968, its wide right-of-way extended from Potomac Yard in Alexandria to the center of Purcellville. Soon after the railroad closed, the Virginia Department of Highways purchased the railroad's property from the line's owner, the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, with the intent of using a portion of the right-of-way for the construction of I-66. In the same year that the railroad closed, the Virginia Electric and Power Company (VEPCO) (part of which was incorporated into Dominion Virginia Power in 2000) purchased most of the property from the highway department, as the company's electric power transmission lines were travelling within the right-of-way.\n\nThe first portion of the W&OD Trail opened in 1974 within the City of Falls Church under a lease agreement between the City government, the power company and the NVRPA. The section was intended to be a test of the trail's concept. It connected on its east end to the Four Mile Run Trail which then ran as far east as I-95. In fact cyclists had been using the right-of-way since 1968, as the town had negotiated the right to use it as part of the original deal for VEPCO to buy it. As the trail proved to be popular, the NVRPA agreed to purchase the right-of-way from the power company on December 19, 1977 and made purchases of it between 1978 and 1982. The power company retained an easement that permitted the company to maintain its lines and to extend them along the right-of-way if needed. In the early years, the trail was known as the Virginia Creeper Trail, but the name didn't stick and is now used by a trail in the southern part of Virginia. \n\nThe NVRPA was not able to acquire from the power company the portion of the right-of-way that lay within the City of Alexandria. The NVRPA also could not acquire the portion of right-of-way that the highway department had retained for construction of I-66 near East Falls Church in Arlington and various portions of the right-of-way that contained existing or potential highway crossings.\n\nThe NVRPA extended the trail east and west of Falls Church as it acquired portions of the right-of-way until it stretched from Alexandria to Purcellville. In 1979, the trail was extended westward from Falls Church to Goose Creek with the aid of a federal Rails-to-Trails grant, although it was only paved as far as Virginia State Route 123 in Vienna - a distance of . Beyond that it was only suitable for hiking. In 1981, the trail was paved from Vienna to Herndon and a section long from Herndon to Leesburg was opened as a gravel path. In 1982, the NVRPA completed a trail underpass at the Route 15 bypass east of Leesburg, increasing the trail's total distance to over . The trail's route west of Leesburg remained accessible only by foot. In 1982, as part of the construction of I-66, the trail was extended and paved eastward from Falls Church to Patrick Henry Drive in Arlington. During that same time period, the NVRPA began paving the easternmost section of trail from Shirlington Road to Columbia Pike in Arlington, with that work completed by the end of 1983. In September of 1984, the NVRPA finished paving two sections of the trail, an extension westward from Herndon to Sterling and, two weeks later, an extension east from I-66 to Columbia Pike. Prior to the 1984 completion, the Arlington section of the trail from Columbia Pike to Lee Highway had been a dirt and gravel path. This work was delayed for years by the Four Mile Run sewer construction project. In 1985, the paved portion of the trail was extended through Leesburg along with the parallel bridle path that was extended to Purcellville. Later the Loudoun County Parkway was built across the trail's right-of-way, and a bridge was constructed to carry the trail over the parkway. The paved trail reached its western terminus in Purcellville in 1988, representing functional completion of the trail. Only a small piece remained, and it was passable by using a piece of the adjacent Four Mile Run Trail. In 2002, the NVRPA constructed the final section of the trail in and near Arlington's Bluemont Park. The section was delayed for years after encountering opposition from the public because of the paved section's possible environmental impacts. The final section connected the W&OD Trail's intersection with the Bluemont Junction Trail to the trail just west of North Carlin Springs Road. It included a new trail bridge over Four Mile Run and an underpass below North Carlin Springs Road .\n\nFollowing the 1988 functional completion of the trail, NVRPA and VDOT focused on grade-separating the trail and making other spot improvements. In 1990, a trail bridge was constructed over Virginia State Route 28 in eastern Loudoun County as part of a project to widen the road. In 1991, the trail crossing of Reston Parkway was moved from Sunset Hills Road to Bluemont Way. In the 1990s, Town Center Parkway in Reston was extended south and a trail bridge was constructed to carry the trail over it. In 1999, developer Terrabrook Communities built a 55 feet wide and 15 feet high underpass arched-concrete underpass as part of an agreement with the Northern Virginia Regional Park Authority and the 500 feet of old trail in that section became connectors to the parkway at Bluemont Way. In 1989, the state completed the Herndon Parkway on the east side of Herndon, which included a trail bridge over the Parkway. On October 3, 1993 NVRPA completed a bridge over West Broad Street (Virginia State Route 7) in Falls Church. The western section of the Herndon Parkway, with another trail bridge over it, was completed in 1997. In 2001, VDOT expanded the Fairfax County Parkway across the W&OD Trail right-of-way, building an overpass for the trail around the same time. Similarly, in May of 2006 they completed work on the Claiborne Parkway extension across the right-of-way, which included a trail overpass. On June 15, 2011, VDOT opened a new trail bridge over I-495 that was constructed as part of the Capital Beltway High Occupancy Toll (HOT) Lanes project and was both 4 feet wider and 30 feet higher than the one built in 1979. The 2013-15 Columbia Pike Utility Undergrounding & Streetscape Improvements project realigned the Columbia Pike crossing by mid 2014 and included the construction of Glencarlyn Park and its \"learner's loop\" in late 2015. In late 2015, the Route 7 Truck Climbing Lane project was completed, part of which involved the realignment of the trail to move the crossing of Route 9 from Dry Mill Road to a new tunnel. In 2017, a bridge carrying Belmont Ridge Road (Virginia State Route 659) over the W&OD Trail and a trail parking lot were constructed in Loudoun County as part of a project to widen the road. Also in 2017, NOVA Parks made a set of safety improvements including removing one left turn lane to shorten crossing distance, installing Rectangular Rapid Flashing Beacons (RRFB), and widening the median at the Sterling Boulevard trail crossing.\n\nIn 2005, the Sugarland Run Valley Stream Trail in Herndon was extended 1 mile to connect to the trail.\n\nOn October 20, 2007, construction began for a paved trail that would connect the W&OD Trail at its origin with the Four Mile Run Trail by traveling for along a bank of the Run while passing beneath the Henry G. Shirley Memorial Highway (I-395) in Alexandria and West Glebe Road in Arlington. On May 30, 2009, a ribbon-cutting ceremony heralded the completion and opening of the connecting trail. \n\nIn 1987, the National Park Service designated the trail as a National Recreation Trail. In February 1999, the Virginia Department of Historic Resources (DHR) determined that the Washington and Old Dominion Railroad Historic District (DHR No. 053-0276) was eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThere have been formal plans to extend the trail west to Bluemont and the Appalachian Trail since the 1980s. Loudoun County's 2003 Bicycle and Pedestrian Mobility Master Plan and Virginia's 2013 and 2018 Outdoors Plans recommend such extensions. Difficulties in identifying a route and acquiring land have prevented construction of a trail along the W&OD Railroad's abandoned right-of-way west of Purcellville and part of the right-of-way in Round Hill has been built on. For these reasons the Loudoun County government is no longer considering such a route. Instead, the county government is now planning to construct a new trail between Purcellville and Round Hill along Virginia State Route 7 (Business) (see: Future Plans in Loudoun County). In 2019, Loudoun County solicited bids to build a 0.6 mile long trail from North Main Street (Route 719) in Round Hill to Franklin Park in Purcellville along Business Route 7, with work to begin in 2020 and finish in October 2021.\n\nThe park and its immediate surroundings contain a number of historic structures, some of which date to the pre-Civil War period. Most of these structures are railroad remnants, including intact stations at Vienna, Sunset Hills, Herndon, Hamilton and Purcellville, stone arches and culverts, the piers and abutments of bridges, and a relocated passenger shelter (formerly at Clarks Gap; now at Paeonian Springs).\n\nPart of the reinforced concrete floor of a brick electrical substation that the railroad constructed in 1912 to help supply power to its new electric locomotives and trolley cars is visible in Arlington County's Bluemont Junction Railroad Display south of Wilson Boulevard. The floor is located in the space between a soccer field and a Southern Railway caboose.\n\nA remnant of a coal trestle stands south of the W&OD Trail, west of the trail's crossing of Lee Highway (U.S. Route 29) in Arlington. In June 2014, the owner of a property adjacent to the regional park demolished part of the structure to provide space for a planned self-storage facility. At the time, the Arlington County government was considering a proposal to designate the structure as a local historic district. In September 2014, the Arlington County Board designated the remaining portion of trestle, which was located on NVRPA property, as a local historic district. The trestle was once adjacent to the west side of the railroad's Falls Church (East Falls Church) station, which was dismantled after the railroad closed.\n\nA white metallic marker post lettered in black with the words \"Station 1 Mile\" stands on the north side of the trail west of Little Falls Road near the boundary between Arlington and Falls Church. This post, which once stood next to the W&OD Railroad's tracks, is one mile (1.6 km) east of the site of the railroad's demolished West Falls Church Station. The station was located near the east side of the railroad's crossing of W. Broad Street (VA Route 7) in Falls Church.\nNear the east end of Vienna, the poured concrete abutment of a bridge that carried an interurban trolley line, the Washington-Virginia Railway, over the W&OD Railroad remains on the north side of the trail. An inscription showing the month and year of the abutment's construction (July 1904) is visible on the structure's east side.\n\nThe trail crosses Goose Creek in Loudoun County on a span that NVRPA built on top of the piers and abutments of the highest and longest () bridge that the railroad constructed within the present boundaries of the regional park. Visitors can view these remnants and the intact span, pier and abutments of the railroad's deck girder bridge over Sycolin Creek from unpaved paths that travel between the streams in NVRPA's Two Creeks Trail Area on the north side of the trail.\n\nThe Sycolin Creek bridge bears the only remaining span that once carried trains of the W&OD Railroad. As the trail travels on the concrete deck of the bridge, visitors can only see the span and the structures below if they leave the trail.\n\nThe piers and abutments of the railroad's bridge over Tuscarora Creek are visible south of the trail near the east end of Leesburg. The bridge was the second longest () that the railroad built within the present boundaries of the regional park. The piers and abutments are the only ones along the trail's route that do not presently support a bridge.\n\nRemnants of the facilities of a 19th-century lime company are visible in Leesburg on the northeast side of the trail, southeast of Harrison Street SE. Limestone (calcium carbonate) from a company quarry was mixed with coal and burned in a nearby kiln that was adjacent to the railroad's tracks. Quicklime (calcium oxide) was brought out of the kiln through two arched openings that visitors can see from the trail. The company also supplied farmers with agricultural lime and provided builders with lime plaster for walls and stone for roads.\n\nNear the saddle point of Clarks Gap, a stone arch crosses over the trail. Constructed around 1867-1868 soon after the end of the Civil War, the masonry arch once carried the original VA Route 7 over the railroad's tracks at the railroad's highest point. The arch now carries Dry Mill Road (VA Route 699) over the trail.\n\nIn 1999, Virginia Department of Historic Resources staff determined that the \"Washington and Old Dominion Railroad Historic District\" was eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). A 2000 NRHP registration form states that the Historic District is eligible for the listing because the District \"is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history\". The form contains an in-depth description of the District's historical resources and of the railroad's history, as well as maps that show the locations of the Districts's major historical features.\n\nThe Norfolk Southern Railway and its predecessors have donated three cabooses for display along the W&OD Trail. While none of these resemble the cabooses that once travelled along the route of the W&OD Railroad, two of the three cars house exhibits of materials relating to the W&OD Railroad and Trail.\n\nA Southern Railway bay window caboose within the Bluemont Junction Railroad Display in Arlington exhibits photographs, maps and other information related to the County's railroads and trolleys. Staffed by a County park ranger, the caboose is open to the public on weekend afternoons from the Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day. The display also contains outdoor signage and photographs that describe and illustrate the history of the W&OD Railroad and of its junction that once operated at the site of the exhibit, as well as a metallic crossbuck and a metallic marker post that was once located from a station.\n\nA cupola caboose near the Trail in Vienna Centennial Park contains a museum that houses materials that the W&OD Railroad once used. Staffed by members of the Optimist Club of Greater Vienna, bearing on its sides the name \"WASHINGTON & OLD DOMINION RAILROAD\" and numbered 503, the caboose is open to the public during the afternoons on selected weekends and holidays. Near the caboose is a historical marker, an NVRPA information sign, a metallic crossbuck on a wooden post and a metallic marker post that was once located from a station. A metallic white railroad whistle post with black markings is located in Vienna Centennial Park on the north side of the Trail between Church Street NE and the caboose.\n\nAdjacent to the Trail in Vienna, the Freeman Store houses a museum of the town's history. The museum contains maps, books and other materials that relate to the W&OD Railroad. Operated by Historic Vienna, Inc., the museum is open to the public during the afternoons of each week from Wednesdays through Sundays.\n\nThe W&OD Railroad station in Vienna houses a museum and a model railroad layout. Operated by the Northern Virginia Model Railroaders, Inc., the museum displays materials that the W&OD Railroad once used and a model of the station as it appeared when steam locomotives stopped at the station. The model railroad and museum is open to the public during the afternoon of one Saturday of each month except June and August.\n\nThe W&OD Railroad station in Herndon houses the Herndon Depot Museum, which the Herndon Historical Society operates. The museum, which is open on Sundays from noon to 3:00 p.m. from March to mid-December, displays photographs and newspaper articles relating to the history of the Town of Herndon and the W&OD Railroad. The museum also contains materials that the railroad once used. The museum additionally contains information about the history of a nearby Norfolk and Western Railway cupola caboose whose sides bore the name and logo of the W&OD Railroad and the number 504 in 2006. A railroad whistle post is located near the caboose\n\nThe W&OD Railroad station in Purcellville houses the Loudoun Visitors Center. The Visitors Center contains a W&OD Railroad historical display and hosts wine-tasting events. The Visitors Center is open from noon to 4:00 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays from late April through October.\nAn overlook at the Luck Stone Quarry east of Goose Creek displays a large trap rock quarry. This mineral provides bulk for concrete, macadam and paving stones.\n\nMost of the landscaping in the park is left in a natural state to preserve green space and to provide wildlife habitat. Some natural areas within the park are contiguous to larger natural areas in adjacent public parks, including those in and around the Sparrow Pond wetland, Brandymore Castle and Four Mile Run in Arlington, Piney Branch and Difficult Run in Fairfax County, and the confluence of Goose Creek and Sycolin Creek in Loudoun County.\n\nPark interpreters, local teachers, environmental groups and amateur naturalists use the park as a resource for plant and animal study. These groups have identified approximately 450 species of wildflowers and more than 100 species of birds in the park. Wildlife in the park includes mammals such as foxes, river otters and beavers, and reptiles such as turtles and snakes. A variety of hawks and owls and other resident, non-resident and migratory birds, both upland and aquatic, find habitat in the park.\n\nThe W&OD Trail lies beneath a set of electric power transmission lines between its trailhead and the Dominion Virginia Power's Pleasant View Substation in Loudoun County southeast of Leesburg. The power company removes trees along this section of the trail to protect its lines, at times eliciting protests from members of the public and elected officials in the impacted jurisdictions. Trees shade much of the remainder of the trail.\n\nIn 2004, Dominion Virginia Power announced plans to extend its transmission lines in Loudoun County above ground from the Pleasant View Substation northwestward along the route of the W&OD Trail. In response, on November 15, 2005, the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors unanimously adopted a resolution of continued opposition to the installation of the proposed transmission lines along the Trail.\n\nCiting the impending loss of trees along its trail, the NVRPA asked the public on December 13, 2005, to oppose Dominion Virginia Power's application for the transmission line project in hearings that the State Corporation Commission (SCC) was planning to conduct as part of its review of the project. During 2005, 2006 and 2007, the NVRPA submitted testimony and briefs to the SCC that opposed the construction of transmission lines along the route of the trail.\n\nIn January 2007, an SCC hearing examiner recommended the construction of an overhead transmission line that would follow a wooded segment of the W&OD Trail between Leesburg and Clark's Gap. After the SCC ordered the examiner to consider construction of an underground line along that segment of the trail, the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors unanimously adopted on June 5, 2007, a resolution that supported the location of the line along that segment only if the SCC required Dominion to \"install the line underground at a minimum width with the least amount of impact\".\n\nThe SCC nevertheless approved on February 15, 2008, a transmission line route that would travel above ground for along the same segment of the trail. The Commission's approval order stated that the SCC had adopted the Examiner's recommendation against underground construction \"due to both the physical, and the cost to the ratepayers, of the impacts that would result therefrom.\"\n\nLess than three weeks later, on March 4 and March 5, 2008, the Senate and the House of Delegates of the Virginia General Assembly unanimously passed emergency legislation that ordered the SCC to approve the underground construction of the line along that segment of the trail as part of a statewide pilot program for the development of such types of transmission lines. Sponsored by Delegate Joe T. May (Republican - Loudoun), the legislation exempted the project from any requirements for further SCC analyses relating to the impacts of the route, including environmental impacts and impacts upon historical resources. The legislation went into effect when Virginia Governor Tim Kaine approved it on April 2, 2008. Soon afterwards, the power company asked the SCC to approve construction of the underground transmission line in accordance with the terms of the legislation. The SCC approved construction of the underground line on May 28, 2008.\n\nThe NVRPA expected the project to result in a significant loss of trees, as the power company planned to dig trenches on each side of the paved trail while installing duct banks to house its conduits. Supporting the NVRPA's expectation, Dominion Virginia Power noted that the environmental impacts associated with underground cable installation in suburban and rural areas are significantly greater than are those of overhead line construction. The W&OD Trail closed for a year in the project area while the power company constructed its underground lines. The trail reopened to the public in November 2010.\n\nNOVA Parks has commissioned a feasibility study of widening the W&OD Trail or adding a parallel trail to it within Arlington and Falls Church because of high use at peak times. The study's author recommended that NOVA Parks make plans to construct a or wide trail within the two jurisdictions, while temporarily widening the trail to .\n\nNOVA Parks has received a $3.2 million grant from the Northern Virginia Transportation Authority that enables it to expand a long trail segment within the City of Falls Church by late 2020. The expansion will convert the wide segment and part of its adjacent green space into a dual paved path containing a wide bicycle trail and an wide pedestrian trail. A wide median strip will separate the two routes, creating a wide transportation corridor that will be twice the width of the present W&OD Trail. The imperviously-surfaced trails will travel through a urban open space that a 2016 Falls Church master plan calls \"The City's Greenest Street\". The master plan's \"Vision Statement\" states that the project will help \"Develop the W&OD Park as a Great Street and greenway\".\n\nThe Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) is presently constructing a W&OD Trail pedestrian and bicycle bridge over U.S Route 29 (Lee Highway) in Arlington County's East Falls Church neighborhood as part of its \"Transform 66 - Inside the Beltway\" I-66 eastbound widening project. VDOT hosted several public meetings that provided information about the bridge, which has raised concerns among neighborhood residents. In April 2019, construction began on the bridge, which VDOT expects to open during the fall of 2020.\n\nTo connect the terminus of the W&OD Trail in Purcellville to the town of Round Hill, the Loudoun County government has designed and acquired easements for a multiuse trail that will travel along East Loudoun Street (Virginia State Route 7 (Business)) between Round Hill and Franklin Park, east of Round Hill. The project's planners expect that construction will start during the early spring of 2020 and will reach completion during the fall of 2021. This trail will connect to a trail under design that will travel along West Main Street (Virginia State Route 7 (Business)) to connect Franklin Park and Purcellville.\n\nViews along the W&OD Trail from east to west:\n\n"}
{"id": "2251920", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2251920", "title": "Kolpak ruling", "text": "Kolpak ruling\n\nThe \"Kolpak\" ruling is a European Court of Justice ruling handed down on 8 May 2003 in favour of Maroš Kolpak, a Slovak handball player. It declared that citizens of countries which have signed European Union Association Agreements have the same right to freedom of work and movement within the EU as EU citizens. Thus any restrictions placed on their right to work (such as quotas setting maximum numbers of such foreign players in sports teams) are deemed illegal under EU law. The legal actions in Germany set a precedent for professional sports in Europe, which have had a wide-ranging effect, especially in regard to English county cricket and European professional rugby.\n\nA Kolpak player, or Kolpak, is a term used in the United Kingdom for players in the domestic leagues in cricket and both rugby codes from overseas, subject to the Kolpak ruling.\n\nThe Court of Justice's Bosman ruling in 1995 had declared that, in accordance with the EC Treaty rules regarding freedom of movement for workers, no resident of the European Union should be restricted from working in another part of the EU on the grounds of their nationality. For example, a German football team could not be prevented from signing a Greek player since both nations are members of the EU.\n\nMaroš Kolpak was a Slovak handball player, who was legally resident and working in Germany. He had been playing for the German second division handball side TSV Ostringen since 1997. The German Handball Association had a rule (Rule 15) which prohibited its member clubs from fielding more than two non-EU citizens. At that time, Slovakia was not yet a member of the European Union (it joined the EU in May 2004), and therefore the Bosman ruling did not apply to its citizens. Slovakia did however have an Association Agreement with the European Union.\n\nKolpak was ejected by his club in 2000 as they had filled their quota of two non-EU players. Kolpak challenged the German Handball Association, claiming that Rule 15, by treating him differently from German citizens, placed an illegal restriction on his freedom of movement as a worker. The German Handball Association held that equality of treatment applied only to citizens of European Union countries (as per the Bosman Ruling) and not to non-EU citizens. The case was referred by the German higher court to the European Court of Justice, for a determination on whether the Association Agreement between Slovakia and the European Union provided equal rights for Slovak workers who were living and working legally within the EU. The Court ruled in favour of Kolpak.\n\nThus the Kolpak Ruling declares that citizens of countries which have applicable Association Agreements with the EU, and who are lawfully working within an EU country, have equal rights to work as EU citizens, and cannot have restrictions such as quotas placed upon them. Such countries include those within the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group of states, such as South Africa, Jamaica and Zimbabwe.\n\nIn practice the decision has allowed English county cricket clubs to employ the services of a multitude of overseas cricketers, especially from South Africa. Prior to the Kolpak ruling ECB rules had limited each county to one overseas (non-EU) professional.\n\nCounty cricket clubs could already employ any number of EU residents under the Bosman ruling. There were no other Test cricket nations within the EU, however, which explains why it was Kolpak, not Bosman, which has had the significant impact on English county cricket. The largest group of countries with an association agreement with the EU is the ACP Group of States, which includes South Africa, Zimbabwe, and many of the nations that supply the West Indies cricket team.\n\nThe English and Wales Cricket Board ruled that a player must not have represented their own country for over twelve months in order to qualify for Kolpak status but after South African Jacques Rudolph signed for Yorkshire, they admitted that this rule was unenforceable.\n\nIn an effort to combat the influx of Kolpak players, the ECB linked the central payments made to counties, to the number of English qualified players who play for that county. This in effect means that every game a Kolpak player plays instead of an English qualified player, a county gets £1,100 less from the ECB. As this was classed as a way of encouraging counties to develop young players who could go on to play for England, rather than a restrictive quota system, it was legal under the EU rules. However, the system did not result in a significant drop in the number of Kolpak players, as counties chose to continue to sign foreign players, rather than maximize their handout from the ECB. The influx reached a peak in 2008, when during a match between Northants and Leicestershire, half the players on the field were from non-EU countries.\n\nIn 2008, the EU changed its reading of the Cotonou Agreement (the Association Agreement between the EU and the ACP countries). It now stated that the Cotonou agreement should not be interpreted as mandating free movement of labour, but rather the free trade of goods and services. The Home Office were subsequently able to introduce new rules placing restrictions on Kolpak players, stating that only those who had held a valid work permit for four years had the right to be treated the same as EU citizens.\n\nIn rugby league and rugby union, the Kolpak ruling has allowed teams to sign many players from Fiji, Tonga, Samoa and South Africa, all of which are also ACP countries. Many rugby union clubs have also signed South African players under Kolpak, most notably the French team RC Toulonnais and English team Saracens F.C.\n\nIn a related issue, New Zealand player Andrew Mehrtens, who was born in Durban, decided to pursue a South African passport when he signed with the English side Harlequins for the 2005–06 National Division One season, as it would enable the club to sign another non-EU and non-Kolpak player.\n\n\n"}

He served as Governor of Bermuda from 1973 to 1977.\n\nLeather was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He graduated from the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario, in 1937.\n\nHe was awarded an Honorary Degree (Doctor of Laws) from the University of Bath in 1976.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Captain Leather served with the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion, Canadian Army in England and Europe. He was badly injured in a practice jump when his parachute failed to open. He rejoined his Battalion for D-day. He served in Europe during World War II with the Toronto Scottish and Royal Canadian Artillery. He wrote a manual for the Home Guard called \"Combat without Weapons\". He worked as an insurance broker in England and was secretary of the Central London branch of the Association of Supervisory Staff, Executives and Technicians.\n\nAt the 1945 general election Leather stood without success in the Bristol South constituency, but at the 1950 general election he was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for North Somerset. He was a backbencher throughout the period of Conservative governments from 1951–1964. He supported the Unions, and held office in the Association of Supervisory Staffs, Executives and Technicians and supported the miners.\n\nLeather never held political office but was a popular speaker at Party Conference and other events, as well as on radio and television. He was a One Nation Tory; he forcefully opposed racism and supported the European Union.\n\nLeather was proposed for a knighthood but, still a Canadian citizen, required the support of the Canadian government which had not made any honour recommendation for some years; Prime Minister John Diefenbaker declined to support the recommendation. He was eventually knighted in 1962 when he was made a Knight bachelor, having taken British citizenship. He quit Westminster in 1964 because of illness. Poor health and the low pay for MPs forced Leather to retire from Parliament at the 1964 general election and enter business. He returned to the political scene a few years later, as vice-chairman of the National Union of Conservative and Unionist Associations, taking a leading role in fund raising and at Party Conference. In 1973, following the murder of Sir Richard Sharples, Leather was appointed Governor of Bermuda. Despite the assassination of his predecessor and an aide, he lived informally and mixed with locals; he continued to live in Bermuda after his retirement in 1977. He got in trouble with the chief of police for recklessly riding his bicycle on the island of Bermuda. He became the local representative of N M Rothschild & Sons and wrote several thrillers. As Governor, his nickname was \"Imperial Leather\", a pun on his surname, position and the famous brand of soap.\n\nHe was appointed in 1974 and in 1975 became the first Canadian to be appointed KCVO since the future 1st Lord Shaughnessy in 1907. Leather was an active freemason and an Anglican lay reader. During his time as Governor of Bermuda, Sir Edwin made a significant effort to include a number of influential Bermudians as part of the vice-regal household. Among them were Rev. Thomas N. Nisbett, Bermuda's first Black Anglican priest (later Canon Thomas Nisbett), and Major Eugene Raynor, who became Colonel and Commanding Officer of the Bermuda Regiment, Bermuda's armed forces.\n\nHe was an accomplished gymnast and founded the International Sports Fellowship. Leather was a freemason.\n\nEdwin Leather's parents were Harold and Grace Leather. Leather married Sheila Greenlees in 1940; they had two daughters. Leather's home was Park House, Batheaston. During the First World War Harold Leather served in East Africa with the Army Service Corps, finishing the war as a Lieutenant. Upon his return to Canada he established Leather Cartage in Hamilton Ontario. During the Second World War Harold was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (1943) for his work in coordinating the Red Cross parcel scheme in Canada. He would go on to become Chairman of the Canadian Red Cross Society. He died in Hamilton, Ontario.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2251923", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2251923", "title": "Hurricane Edith (1971)", "text": "Hurricane Edith (1971)\n\nHurricane Edith was the strongest hurricane to form during the 1971 Atlantic hurricane season and formerly the southernmost landfalling Category 5 hurricane on record in the Atlantic until 2007. Edith also stands as one of the only Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes to not have its name retired, next to 1953's Hurricane Carol and 2005's Hurricane Emily. Edith developed from a tropical wave on September 5 and quickly strengthened into a hurricane in the Caribbean Sea. Edith rapidly intensified on September 9 and made landfall on Cape Gracias a Dios as a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. It quickly lost intensity over Central America and after briefly entering the Gulf of Honduras it crossed the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. After moving across the Gulf of Mexico a trough turned the storm to the northeast and Edith, after having restrengthened while accelerating towards the coast, made landfall on Louisiana with winds of 105 mph (170 km/h) on September 16. Edith steadily weakened over land and dissipated over Georgia on September 18.\n\nThe hurricane killed two people when it passed near Aruba. Striking northeastern Central America as a Category 5 hurricane, Edith destroyed hundreds of homes and killed at least 35 people. In Texas high tides caused coastal flooding but little damage. Edith caused moderate to heavy damage in portions of Louisiana due to flooding and a tornado outbreak from the storm. One tornado, rated F3 on the Fujita Scale, damaged several homes and injured multiple people in Baton Rouge. The tornado outbreak extended eastward into Florida, of which a few destroyed entire buildings. Damage in the United States totaled US$25 million (1971 dollars, $ in dollars).\n\nA tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa near Dakar on August 31. It moved westward into the Intertropical Convergence Zone, and organized into a tropical disturbance on September 2 with a small, circular area of convection. The system moved to the west, and on September 3, the convection diminished after moving west of 40° W. By the next day, the tropical disturbance was barely discernible from the clouds of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The wave gradually became detached from the ITCZ, and based on a reconnaissance flight that confirmed the existence of a low-level circulation, it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression on September 5 while located 255 miles (415 km) east of Grenada.\n\nThe depression moved westward quickly, and moved through the southern Lesser Antilles early on September 6. The southern portion of the circulation passed over northeastern Venezuela, though after entering the Caribbean Sea, another reconnaissance flight was unable to confirm the existence of a low-level circulation. Shortly thereafter, while moving into an area of light wind shear, it was able to organize and strengthen further, and on September  7 the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm \"Edith\" near the island of Curaçao. While initially, a cold-core upper-level low persisted about 750 miles (1200 km) northwest of the storm, Edith moved west-northwestward due to the influence of a narrow and persistent ridge of high pressure, which extended from the southwestern Atlantic Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico. As the storm continued into open waters of the Caribbean, the upper-level low gradually weakened and was replaced with an anticyclone. This allowed the storm to strengthen further, and on September 8, Edith became a hurricane in the south-central Caribbean Sea.\n\nOn September 9, the storm rapidly intensified, and within 24 hours, Edith strengthened from a minimal hurricane to a powerful 160 mph (260 km/h) Category 5 hurricane just off the coast of Nicaragua. The cause for the explosive deepening is unknown, though it is speculated that the transformation in the upper troposphere from an upper-level low to an anticyclone led to a release of baroclinic energy. Reconnaissance aircraft crews in the peak of the storm reported extreme turbulence, causing concern for the safety of the crews. At its peak intensity, the very well-defined \"pinhole\" eye was only 5 miles (8 km) in diameter. Late on September 9, Hurricane Edith made landfall on northeastern Nicaragua at Cabo Gracias a Dios.\nHurricane Edith rapidly weakened over the mountainous terrain of northeastern Central America, and 18 hours after it made landfall, it emerged into the Gulf of Honduras as an 80 mph (130 km/h) Category 1 hurricane. It continued to weaken as it moved northwestward, and made landfall near Belize City with tropical storm winds of 70 mph (115 km/h). Edith weakened further while crossing the Yucatán Peninsula, and emerged into the Gulf of Mexico near Campeche, Mexico late on September 11 as a minimal tropical storm. Edith initially failed to re-intensify as it moved northwestward, despite low amounts of wind shear and warm waters. This was because an anticyclone over the Gulf was closely connected with Hurricane Fern, which developed and moved over the northwestern portion of the Gulf of Mexico. The anticyclone resulted in an easterly upper-level flow across Edith, creating conditions not conducive for intensification. As Fern moved inland over Texas, the flow became more favorable around Edith, and 36 hours after entering the Gulf of Mexico, the storm began to reintensify slightly.\n\nEdith continued moving to the west-northwest, heading towards the coast of Mexico, but early on September 14, the storm stalled while located just off the coast of Tamaulipas. A mid-latitude trough of low pressure approached the storm, and caused Edith to turn to slowly drift towards the northeast. Located only miles from the Mexican coast, Edith again failed to strengthen until September 15, when it accelerated northeastward and regained hurricane status. The hurricane turned to the east-northeast as it approached the coast of Louisiana, and made landfall on September 16 in a sparsely populated area 30 miles (48 km) east of Cameron with winds of 105 mph (170 km/h), equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane in the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Edith rapidly weakened over land, degenerating into a tropical storm over Louisiana, and into a tropical depression over Mississippi. It continued to the east-northeast, and dissipated over northwestern Georgia on September 18.\n\nFourteen hours prior to Edith making landfall in Central America, the National Hurricane Center warned citizens about the extreme danger of the approaching hurricane, and asked them to prepare for hurricane conditions. While the storm was located in the Gulf of Mexico, the National Hurricane Center issued a Hurricane Warning from Cameron to Morgan City, Louisiana eighteen hours before the hurricane made landfall. Edith later struck land in the middle portion of the warning area.\n\nIn Belize, officials ordered the mandatory evacuation of low-lying areas, resulting in hundreds of residents leaving to the United States through the international airport. Officials sent police troops to maintain order and prevent looting.\n\nIn the Gulf of Mexico, several oil facilities were closed or placed on automatic controls. Drilling rigs as far east as the coastal waters off of Mississippi were prepared to evacuate in the event Edith moved further east than anticipated. Additionally, thousands evacuated coastal areas of Louisiana prior to the arrival of the hurricane. Several shelters opened in coastal cities, and many people prepared for the hurricane by purchasing emergency supplies. Officials closed schools throughout much of southern Louisiana.\n\nWhile passing through the southern Lesser Antilles, the tropical depression produced heavy rainfall and winds of around 35 mph (55 km/h). Edith produced tropical storm force winds in Aruba, and gusts reached 60 mph (95 km/h). Two fishermen were reported lost at sea and presumed dead as a result of Edith.\n\nEdith produced strong winds across northeastern Nicaragua and eastern Honduras, with Puerto Lempira reporting an unofficial sustained wind of 140 mph (225 km/h). Press reports indicated every house in the Cape Gracias area was destroyed or heavily damaged, leaving 7,000 homeless. The meteorological service in British Honduras stated there were 100 fatalities near Cape Gracias, though a later report indicated 35 people died in Nicaragua. There, damage was estimated at over US$380,000 (1971 dollars, $ in dollars). Three United States Air Force aircraft delivered food, medical supplies, and fuel to the hurricane victims of Nicaragua. In Honduras, the hurricane produced 15 foot (4.5 m) tides and strong winds, while strong waves destroyed 40 fishing boats as well. While the hurricane reportedly destroyed entire villages, no deaths occurred in Honduras.\n\nOffshore islands in Belize reported winds of up to 60 mph (95 km/h). Edith produced flooding in a few towns in the southern portion of the country, with some buildings damaged. Heavy damage was reported near Monkey River Town. Impact in Mexico, if any, is unknown.\n\nTwo stations in Texas recorded sustained tropical force winds, and Galveston reported a peak wind gust of 53 mph (85 km/h). While moving past the state, Edith produced above normal tides of over 4 feet (1.2 m) in locations, which flooded a portion of Highway 87. The storm dropped light to moderate amounts of rainfall peaking at 3.5 inches (89 mm) in Sabine Pass. The passage of Hurricane Edith resulted in downed trees and power lines, and damage totaling US$180,000 (1971 dollars, $900,000 in 2006 dollars).\n\nOff the coast of Louisiana, the hurricane wrecked three boats, but all the occupants were safely rescued. While making landfall in Louisiana, Edith resulted in above normal tides of up to 9.7 feet (2.9 m) above normal at Cypremont Point near Morgan City. The highest winds reported by a land station were 69 mph (111 km/h) at Cameron, where a wind gust of 96 mph (155 km/h) was also reported. However, due to the lack of recording instruments near the hurricane's landing point, whether higher winds occurred there is not known, although likely. Rainfall was moderate across Louisiana, including amounts of over 8 inches (200 mm) in the southwestern portion of the state. A strong rainband well ahead of the hurricane, combined with the intrusion of dry air into the hurricane's circulation, produced 16 tornadoes from Louisiana to Alabama. An F3 tornado touched down in the eastern residential suburbs of Baton Rouge, causing heavy property damage totaling $2.5 million (1971 dollars, $ in dollars) along its intermittent 7 mile (11 km) path. The tornado also injured three people. An F2 tornado in Tangipahoa Parish caused $250,000 in damage (1971 dollars, $ in dollars) along its 4-mile (6 km) path, while an F1 tornado in St. Martin Parish injured 6 people on its 3-mile (5 km) path. The hurricane caused extensive damage to the sugar cane crop in southwestern Louisiana. About a month after Edith struck the United States, President Richard Nixon declared portions of Louisiana as a disaster area, which allocated relief funds to aid the affected citizens.\n\nIn Mississippi, wind gusts peaked at 70 mph (112 km/h) in Hattiesburg, with multiple locations reporting tropical-storm-force winds. Additionally, Edith produced moderate rainfall peaking at 6.15 inches (156 mm) in Liberty. In Alabama, the storm caused light rains, moderate wind gusts, and a storm tide of 2.7 feet (0.8 m) in Mobile. Edith spawned four tornadoes in Alabama, three of which were F2 tornadoes. Two touched down in Baldwin County; one destroyed two homes and damaged several others, and the other destroyed two mobile homes, a few barns, and damaged ten houses. Two tornadoes also touched down in Washington County, one of which destroyed several small buildings and downed a few trees. In Florida, Edith produced slightly above-normal tides and light rain. It spawned a tornado in Pensacola, Florida, injuring one person and inflicting $25,000 in damage (1971 dollars, $125,000 in 2006 dollars). Damage throughout the United States totaled $25 million (1971 dollars, $ in dollars), primarily from crop damage in southwest Louisiana. No deaths were reported in the United States.\n\n\n"}

As with much of the wildlife of the region, in contemporary times the park continues to be threatened by the activities of poachers, pollution, and the activities of refugees and militia.\n\nThere are also a handful of villages in the park. In recent years, the park has come under considerable attack from poachers and local militias. On 28 May 2004, for instance, the park headquarters in Lusinga came under attack by the Mai Mai militia. Several wardens and their families were killed, the headquarters were burned down, and the family of the chief warden was taken hostage.\n\nOn 1 June 2005, the protectors of the park received the Abraham Conservation Award for their role in protecting the rich biodiversity of the Congo River basin.\n\nThe habitat of the park varies from Afromontane grasslands and forests at higher altitudes in the Kibara Mountains; through Miombo woodlands and tropical rainforests; to marshes, wetlands, lakes, and streams with riparian zones at the lower altitudes. It is home to some 1,800 different species, some of them discovered as late as 2003.\n\nLake Upemba has a maximum depth reported to be only and it is a site of intense algae growth.

It is located in heart of Kuala Lumpur city, next to the National Art Gallery.\n\nThe idea of this theatre began with the proposal in 1964 to establish a cultural centre. The construction work began in 1995 and was completed three years later. It was built at a cost of RM210 million with a theatre floor area of 21,000 m² as part of the 54,400 m² cultural complex. The Istana Budaya was officially opened in 1999 by the Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad. Upon completion, the former national theatre, \"Panggung Negara\" was relocated to this new building. Istana Budaya is the home of the Residence Artists (Dance);the National Symphony Orchestra (NSO) and the Orchestra Traditional Malaysia (OTM).\n\nThe Istana Budaya theatre hall \"Panggung Sari\", with its unique design of royal boxes inspired by the windows of the traditional \"Rumah Melayu\" or Malay house, can accommodate up to 1,410 audiences at a time. Istana Budaya is also rated among the ten most sophisticated theatres in the world, and on par with the Royal Albert Hall in London.\n\nIstana Budaya aims to raise the standards of performing arts, develop artistic excellence in theatre, popularise high-quality theatre productions and develop a higher sense of artistic appreciation.\n\nThe building was designed by the local architect firm, ADC ARCHITECT SDN. The inspiration for the design is based on a traditional moon kite in flight. The turquoise folds on the roof and the intricate design of the foyer are just two of the interesting features of the building. Istana Budaya's architecture has intrigued experts and academics.\n\nThe main building takes the shape of the \"sirih junjung\", a traditional arrangement or a present made of betel leaves used during Malay wedding and welcoming ceremonies. As in a traditional Malay house, the building is divided into three areas:\n\nThe interior was constructed using local resources such as Langkawi's marble and high-quality tropical wood for the doors crafted by hand to shape flowers and leaf motifs. The verdant carpets in the entrance hall and lobby feature \"cempaka\" flower and the banyan tree, inspired by traditional Malay opera or \"Mak Yong\".\n\nIn the auditorium, there are royal boxes on each side, patterned after the windows of a Malay house. The entrance to the theatre, too, replicates a palace's main hall, or the Balairong Seri and is said to be modelled after one in Malacca.\n\nThe theatre lobby on the third floor extends the influence of Malay culture, taking the shape of the \"rebana ubi\" or traditional drum. The auditorium itself seats about 1,412 people, including 797 in the stalls on the first floor, 312 in the grand circle on the second floor and 303 people in the upper circle. The orchestra pit, when it is not in use, can take in 98 people.\n\nIstana Budaya has wheelchair facilities, including a ramp into the foyer, a lift with easy-to-reach buttons and an area designated for the handicapped. Restrooms for the disabled are also found at both the stalls and grand circle areas. Additionally, there is also a costume gallery featuring clothes from Malay traditional theatre. The costumes are from \"Bangsawan\", \"Mak Yong\", \"Ajat Bebunuh\", \"Layang Emas\" and \"Bambarayon\" performances, among others.\n\nIstana Budaya has staged many notable opera performances including The Merry Widow, Tosca, La Bohème, Turandot and Carmen accompanied by the National Symphony Orchestra and chorus. It has also became the main venue for the successful local musical production, Puteri Gunung Ledang.\n\n\n\n"}

He was the tutor of Alexander of Aphrodisias and wrote a work \"On Revolving Spheres\", from which some important extracts have been preserved in Simplicius's commentary on Aristotle's \"De Caelo\".\n\nSosigenes criticized both Aristotle and Eudoxus for their imperfect theory of celestial spheres and also the use of epicycles, which he felt to be inconsistent with Aristotle's philosophical postulates. He pointed out that the planets varied markedly in brightness, and that eclipses of the Sun are sometimes total and sometimes annular, suggesting that the distances between the Sun, Moon and Earth were not the same at different eclipses.\n\nSosigenes is perhaps called \"the Peripatetic\" only because of his connection with Alexander. Some ancient evidence may be taken to suggest that he was, in fact, a Stoic. As John Patrick Lynch has written:The other two teachers of Alexander may actually have been the philosophers whom ancient sources called Stoics; in both cases, Herminos/Sosigenes \"the Stoic\" have been distinguished from Herminos/Sosigenes \"the Peripatetic\" only on the grounds that the two latter men were teachers of Alexander of Aphrodisias. But it is not improbable that Alexander of Aphrodisias studied with two Stoic teachers and that these two pairs of homonymous contemporaries are actually only two Stoic philosophers.\n\nHe is often confused with the astronomer Sosigenes of Alexandria, who advised Julius Caesar on the reform of the Roman calendar.\n\n"}
{"id": "2251946", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2251946", "title": "Berthold Goldschmidt", "text": "Berthold Goldschmidt\n\nBerthold Goldschmidt (18 January 190317 October 1996) was a German Jewish composer who spent most of his life in England. The suppression of his work by Nazi Germany, as well as the disdain with which many Modernist critics elsewhere dismissed his \"anachronistic\" lyricism, stranded the composer in the wilderness for many years before he was given a revival in his final decade.\n\nGoldschmidt was born in Hamburg, Germany in 1903. His musical career began in earnest during the heyday of the Weimar Republic. While studying philosophy at the University of Hamburg, he was encouraged by the Italian composer Ferruccio Busoni to write music. In 1922, Goldschmidt entered the Berlin Hochschule für Musik and joined Franz Schreker's composition class, where his fellow pupils included Ernst Krenek, Alois Hába, Felix Petryek, and Jascha Horenstein. He also studied conducting, played freelance for the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, and in 1923, coached the choir for the Berlin premiere of Arnold Schoenberg's \"Gurre-Lieder\". In 1925, Goldschmidt achieved his first major success with his Passacaglia, Op. 4, which earned him the prestigious Mendelssohn Prize. Hailed as one of the brightest hopes of a generation of young composers, Goldschmidt reached the premature climax of his career with the premiere of his opera \"Der gewaltige Hahnrei\" in Mannheim in 1932.\n\nThis triumph happened on the eve of the Nazi takeover of Germany, which quickly destroyed Goldschmidt's livelihood. Like many Jewish composers (and other composers considered subversive of the Germanic purity of the Third Reich), Goldschmidt had his work condemned as \"degenerate music\" by the regime. There was no place in German musical life for Goldschmidt since performances of his work were banned and he was barred from conducting orchestras. Goldschmidt resorted to earning a living by giving piano lessons, before finally leaving the country on the advice of an SS officer and emigrating to England in 1935.\n\nDuring World War II, Goldschmidt worked for the BBC and served as the Music Director of its German Service in 1944-47. While taking jobs in conducting, Goldschmidt also composed works such as the Ciaccona Sinfonica, concertos for violin, cello, and clarinet, and the opera \"Beatrice Cenci\". The English attitude towards Goldschmidt's music was generally indifferent. Even though \"Beatrice Cenci\", an opera based on the 1819 play \"The Cenci\" by Percy Bysshe Shelley, won first prize in the 1951 Festival of Britain opera competition, Covent Garden refused to mount a production. Neglected by the musical establishment, Goldschmidt decided to abandon original composition in 1958. For the next six years, he collaborated with Deryck Cooke on producing a performing edition of Gustav Mahler's Tenth Symphony. On 13 August 1964, at the Proms, Goldschmidt conducted the London Symphony Orchestra in the world premiere of the Cooke realization.\n\nThe last years of Goldschmidt's life witnessed a renewed interest in the composers of so-called \"degenerate music.\" In 1983, to mark Goldschmidt's 80th birthday, friend and conductor Bernard Keeffe mounted a run-through (the only performance in the UK to date) of scenes from \"Der gewaltige Hahnrei\" at Trinity College of Music in London. This performance was attended by David Drew, which led to a publishing collaboration with Boosey & Hawkes. This revival led to performances of his work in the United States and Germany, new recordings, and the recovery of a number of lost manuscripts. His opera \"Beatrice Cenci\", rejected in 1951, was given a concert performance in 1988 and a fully staged performance in 1994.\n\nGoldschmidt had resumed composing in 1982 with the Clarinet Quartet and penned his final work, the \"Deux nocturnes\", just before his death at the age of 93. Champions of his work include the conductors Simon Rattle, Charles Dutoit and Bernard Keeffe; the violinist Chantal Juillet; the Mandelring string quartet; and the record companies Largo and Decca.\n\nHe died in London in 1996, aged 93.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrincipal publisher: Boosey & Hawkes\n\nBiographies from:\n\n"}

He was the eldest son of King Yejong and Queen Sundeok, the daughter of Yi Cha-gyeom. His reign saw two major internal crises that nearly ended the House of Wang, and a collapse of the Northern Song and the establishment of the Jurchen Jin dynasty as the dominant power in the East Asia.\n\nInjong ascended the throne in accordance with the third of the Ten Injunctions of Taejo, as “the eldest legitimate royal issue.\" Despite the reverend status of this document, its succession rules were often disregarded. As recent as in 1095 Injong's grandfather King Sukjong came to power after abdication of his nephew. At the age of twelve and a half Injong's succession became possible largely due to the influence of his maternal grandfather Yi Cha-gyeom, while according to the report of the Song envoy Xu Jing, Injong's uncle Prince Po, supported by the Han An-in faction, \"had designs on [the throne]\" \n\nBy the early 1122 the Khitan state of Liao was effectively destroyed by the armies of Taizu of Jin. Large number of Khitans fled to Goryeo. Operations of Song against Khitan were unsuccessful, and the lost Song territories south of the Great Wall were recovered only after the Jurchen victory over Liao. The 1123 treaty formalized the superior status of Jin: the annual tribute of Song was set to 200,000 taels of silver and 200,000 bolts of silk. Despite the weak performance against Khitan, the Song government overestimated both the importance of the recovery of Yanjing (a modern-day Beijing) and its own military capabilities.\n\nThe early years of Injong's reign were dominated by Yi Cha-gyeom. As the Supreme Chancellor (\"munha sijung\", junior first rank) at the head of combined Secretariat-Chancellery (\"chungseo munha-seong\") Yi Cha-gyeom was the highest-ranking government official. His dominance was challenged during the last years of Yejong, but with the beginning of his grandson's reign Yi Cha-gyeom took decisive steps to buttress it. By the end of 1122 Princes Po and Hye were exiled, Han An-in assassinated, and several hundred of his followers, including a dozen core members of Tanju Han and Cheongan Im clans, were either banished or demoted.\n\nDuring this period officers of the Royal Army began to play an important role in the domestic politics.\nThrough his career Yi Cha-gyeom cultivated \"muban\" military officials, that after 960 had a lower status and enjoyed less perquisites than their civilian \"munban\" counterparts. Two of his most important allies were Choe Hong-jae, a high civilian official of a military background, and a military commander Cheok Chun-gyeong.\n\nWith this power base Yi Cha-gyeom emerged as the most influential figure in the Goryeo politics. He became the Chief-Minister-Extraordinary in charge of all three chancelleries (\"samseong\"), while keeping the position of the head (superintendent, \"pansa\") of the Ministry of Personnel (\"Yi-bu\"). He was also created a Duke (\"kong\"). Nevertheless, his authority never became absolute: he had to take head of other factions both in execution of policies he favored and in rooting out the opposition.\n\nIn foreign relations he was aligned with the Kyeongju Kim faction led by Kim Bu-sik and his brothers, advocating a submission to the newly established Jin. In 1123 the renewed Song offer of formal investiture was rejected. Jin stepped up the pressure on Goryeo by occupying Uiju (Poju) area along the Yalu river; from their point of view it was a repair of the frontier defenses. After a suppression of unrest in Balhae a secure North-Eastern frontier allowed Jin to focus on the Song.\n\nIn early 1124 Choe Hong-jae and military officers associated with him plotted to overthrow Yi Cha-gyeom, but were unsuccessful. Choe and the associates were purged from their positions and exiled. Following the purge Yi married one of his daughters to Injong, and increasingly filled the mid- and high-ranking government positions with his loyalists, including his five sons. He and his faction profited from seized property of the purged officials.\n\nThe idea that Goryeo has to submit to Jin was still encountering resistance. The embassy dispatched in 1125 to Emperor Taizong of Jin was rejected by his officials because the correspondence it carried addressed the emperor improperly and did not use the term ‘servant' when referring to Goryeo. The question whether to accept that the mandate of the northern dynasty passed to Jin was debated through 1126. Eventually Kim and Yi convinced Injong and the reluctant officials to submit to Jin. By that time the Song were collapsing under Jin attack, Emperor Huizong abdicated, while a Goryeo embassy (that included Kim Bu-sik ) had to return without being able to reach Kaifeng. The embassy to Jin sent in 1126 presented the submission of Goryeo in proper terms and brought up the matter of Uiju. Taizong transferred the disputed area to Goryeo.\n\nIt was reported that Yi Cha-gyeom intended to usurp the throne and eventually planned to poison the king. According to this report, there was a popular prophecy that a man of the \"sippal cha\", or eighteen child, an anagram on the character for the surname Yi, would become king and the transfer his court to the Southern Capital (Seoul), leading Goryeo to a renewed prosperity. Yi Cha-gyeom is alleged to believe in this prophecy, based on his family name and a location of the family seat in Incheon, close to Seoul. Attempts of Yi to further aggrandize his station are a matter of the public record. He planned performance of ritual music at the tombs of his forefathers and celebration of his birthday as the anniversary of a king (\"insujeol\"). Both moves were opposed by Kim Bu-sik and his supporters.\n\nA more serious challenge to the paramount position of Yi Cha-gyeom was a rising organized by two courtiers, Kim Chan and An Po-rin. Beyond the involvement of some twenty-five young courtiers, the plot had a confidence of Injong and a support of three senior military officers, including one commander and one deputy commander of two (out of six) regular army divisions. Several senior statesmen, such as Yi Kon-su, approved the plot in principle but advised caution. The group struck “one night in 1126\". The plan involved gaining control of the palace and king's person as the first stage of the coup, followed by a strike against other key targets. The conspirators captured the palace and killed several of Yi Cha-gyeom loyalists, including the Minister of War (a brother of Cheok Chun-gyeong). However, the palace was surrounded by the troops of Cheok Chun-gyeong and armed monks led by Yi Cha-gyeom's son. The rest of Kaesong remained in the control of the Yi faction. To finish the stand-off Cheok Chun-gyeong ordered torching the palace (Yi Cha-gyeom's disapproval was on the record as sent to him). Most of the palace, including libraries and the Academy, burned down. “Countless\" conspirators were killed. Injong offered to abdicate in favor of Yi Cha-gyeom, but the latter refused.\n\nIn the following government reshuffling Yi Cha-gyeom rewarded his loyalists. However, Yi Kon-su kept his senior position in the Secretariat-Chancellery, and two Kim brothers were actually promoted, with Kim Bu-sik becoming the Chief Censor. King Injong was living in Cha-gyeom's house and had married another of his daughters.\n\nThis triumph was, however, short-lived. Other aristocratic factions joined forces to bring Yi Cha-gyeom down. They fostered a disunity between Cheok and Yi, using the question of responsibility for violation of the sacred palace grounds as a bait. Involvement of Injong, Yi Kon-su and Kim Bu-il left traces in the official records. In the fifth month of 1126 Yi Cha-gyeom, his family and followers were arrested by the soldiers of Cheok Chun-gyeong. Yi was banished to Jeolla province and later beheaded. Banished officials — Choe Hong-jae, members of Tanju Han and Cheongan Im clans and their associates — were recalled and reinstated in their positions. In the sixth month of 1126 King Injong married a daughter of Im Weonae. Cheok Chun-gyeong was demoted and banished in 1127.\n\nAfter the fall of Yi Cha-gyeom the government was dominated by Kyeongju Kim and Han An-in/ Cheongan Im clans. Provincial clans, particularly from the Western Capital (Seogeong, modern Pyongyang) area were important in toppling Yi Cha-gyeom and contended for a larger share in the decision-making. Paek Su-han, Cheong Chi-sang, a famous poet and Confucian scholar, and Myo Cheong, a Buddhist monk and geomancer were prominent representatives of this faction. Myo Cheong appeared at the court in 1127 and officially became political adviser to Injong in 1128. It is possible that the Pyongyang group was used by the king to balance influence of the established aristocracy.\n\nAlready in 1127 Myo Cheong instigated a fifteen-point restoration rescript (\"yusin chigyo\") of Injong. It included political reforms, called for austerity, and urged measures to restrict official exploitation of the peasantry. Educational reforms were part of the package and intended to strengthen the royal authority. Injong ordered that each \"chu\" (large districts) and \"hyeon\" (district) establish a school (to prepare to the civil service examinations), thus facilitating the access of local elites to positions in the central administration. Injong completed the reconstruction of the government school system by instituting the “six colleges\" at the National Academy.\n\nMyo Cheong had a reputation for sanctity and was a speaker “easily dazzled his listeners\". His teachings were enjoying a growing popularity with the people and some members of the elite, including the king. Politically the Pyongyang faction was opposed by the Kyeongju Kim and Han An-in/Cheongan Im groups. Its supporters included Choe Hong-jae, an old foe of Han An-in faction, now a senior member of the Censorate, and Yun Oni, son of the famous general Yun Gwan, influential Confucian scholar and a close ally of Cheong Chi-sang. Indeed, out of six senior censorial officials in 1133, two were supporters of Myo Cheong and only two steadfastly opposed him.\n\nMyo Cheong provided a geomantic explanation of the recent disturbances in Kaesong and offered to cure the problem: since the geomantic forces around the Eastern Capital were waning, the court should move to the Western Capital, where the same forces were strong and “filled with vigour\". This ideas, while somewhat extreme in their forcefulness, were in line with the prevailing thinking at the time. Ten Injunctions of Taejo accepted geomantic considerations as an important factor influencing government policies and ascribed a particular significance to the Western Capital. Injong's edict of 1129 commanded construction of a palace (Great Flowering Palace, \"Taehwa-gung\"), in Pyongyang to “revitalize our politics and [...] forever bestow felicity upon the following generations\". The palace was completed in 1132 and Injong began to spend extended periods of time there.\n\nIn foreign relations Injong's government, while admitting the superiority of Jin, aimed to preserve independence and trade interests of Goryeo. By 1127 Song collapsed. The Jurchen armies conquered Kaifeng, and both Huizong, now retired, and the reigning emperor Qinzong were captured and exiled to Manchuria. Not long afterwards Song envoys tried to convince Goryeo officials to give them a direct overland access to the Jin and negotiate the release of the captured emperors. The request was denied at the insistence of Kim Bu-sik and his elder brother Kim Bu-il, while different sources record Choe Hong-jae as to be in favor of assisting the Song or as opposed to it. The relations with the Song were practically broken for the next few years: a request by Injong in 1129 to send an embassy was denied, while the embassy dispatched in 1132 was shipwrecked.\n\nGoryeo traditionally provided a refuge for Jurchens that were at odds with the powers at home.\nDuring the first twenty years of the 11th century 6,846 Jurchen refugees were registered at Kaesong, compared with the average of 526 over two-decade periods of the previous one hundred years (and only 17 during 1081-1100). This policy continued under Injong, even if twice (in 1127 and 1130) the Jin used presence of the Jurchen refugees in Goryeo to pressure it into formal submission.\n\nPyongyang faction represented a more nativist and anti-Jurchen approach. Myo Cheong claimed that moving a capital to Seogeong (Pyongyang) would reinvigorate\nGoryeo to the extent that thirty-six states, including Jin, would pay homage to it. He urged Injong to declare himself emperor, institute his own era name, and attack the \"arrogant Jin\". A memorandum to this effect was also submitted to Injong by Cheong Chi-sang and Yun Oni. Aided by the indecision of Injong an uneasy equilibrium between the factions continued for several years.\n\nDisappointed by the rate of reforms, insufficiently decisive stance against Jin, and alarmed by purges of some of it supporters, Myo Cheong rebelled in 1135. At the Western Capital the rebels declared a new state of Taewi (Great Accomplishment). The rebels were enthusiastically supported in the northwest, but most of Myo Cheong's supporters in Kaesong deserted him. It is still debated weather Myo Cheong was actually the principal driving force of the rebellion or just its figurehead.\n\nIm Weonae, the king's father-in-law, on the news of the revolt, mobilized armies to protect Kaesong. Officials associated with Myo Cheong were prosecuted: some, like Cheong Chi-sang were executed, and many banished during 1135-1136. Several attempts were made to negotiate with the rebels. The situation became particularly threatening when the offers of military assistance came both from the Jin and Southern Song. Eventually Kim Bu-sik led a successful military campaign against the rebels. Myo Cheong was assassinated by his own army, and in early 1136 Pyongyang fell to the government forces. Yun Oni distinguished himself in action against the rebels, but was still banished by Kim Bu-sik as an associate of Cheong Chi-sang.\n\nFrom the suppression of the Myo Cheong rebellion until his official retirement in 1142 Kim Bu-sik was an unchallenged leader of the Goryeo government. From 1140 onwards the banished supporters of Myo Cheong began to be recalled.\nBy the early eleven forties the conflict of the Southern Song and the Jin reached an equilibrium that was formalized during the negotiates of 1141-1142. The Southern Song emperor recognized the suzerainty of Emperor Xizong of Jin, paying an annual tribute of 250,000 bolts of silk and taels of silver. Goryo exchanges several embassies with the Jin, and in 1142 Injong was formally invested as its vassal.\n\nIn 1143 Injong appointed fourteen local magistrates, making another step in bringing local administration under the central control. As a result of the reforms of Yejong and Injong about one third of Goryeo's 450 or so prefectures and counties were under a direct control of the central government.\n\nIn 1142, Injong ordered the compilation of the \"Samguk Sagi\", a chronicle of events in the Three Kingdoms and Unified Silla. Using Chinese histories (particularly Shiji by Sima Qian), Kim Bu-sik at the head of the fourteen-author team compiled the oldest extant source on Korean history. It was submitted to Injong in late 1145 or early 1146.\n\nBoth Injong and Lady Im (Queen Gongye) are recorded as having misgivings about their oldest son Prince Hyeon. Both doubted his ability to rule and Queen Gongye preferred the second son Prince Kyeong as the next king. Nevertheless, on Injong's death Prince Hyeon succeeded him as the 18th monarch of Goryeo.\n\nConsorts:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2251965", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2251965", "title": "Earthing system", "text": "Earthing system\n\nIn an electrical installation, an earthing system (UK) or grounding system (US) connects specific parts of that installation with the Earth's conductive surface for safety and functional purposes. The point of reference is the Earth's conductive surface. The choice of earthing system can affect the safety and electromagnetic compatibility of the installation. Regulations for earthing systems vary considerably among countries, though most follow the recommendations of the International Electrotechnical Commission. Regulations may identify special cases for earthing in mines, in patient care areas, or in hazardous areas of industrial plants. \n\nIn addition to electric power systems, other systems may require grounding for safety or function. Tall structures may have lightning rods as part of a system to protect them from lightning strikes. Telegraph lines may use the Earth as one conductor of a circuit, saving the cost of installation of a return wire over a long circuit. Radio antennas may require particular grounding for operation, as well as to control static electricity and provide lightning protection.\n\nAn earth ground connection of the exposed conductive parts of electrical equipment helps protect from electric shock by keeping the exposed conductive surface of connected devices close to earth potential, when a failure of electrical insulation occurs. When a fault occurs, current flows from the power system to earth. To protect equipment from damage due to leakage current, residual-current sensing circuit breakers detects the leakage current and interrupt the circuit. These devices may allow more ground fault current to pass than a device intended to protect people from electric shock. Although over current protection, fuse or circuit breaker are available in circuits for complete isolation of power, their operating level is too high. To ensure the voltage on exposed surfaces is not too high, the impedance (resistance) of the connection to earth must be kept low relative to the normal circuit impedance. \n\nAn alternative to protective earthing of exposed surfaces is a design with \"double insulation\" or other precautions, such that a single failure or highly probable combination of failures cannot result in contact between live circuits and the surface. For example, a hand-held power tool might have an extra system of electrical insulation between internal components and the case of the tool, so that even if the insulation for the motor or switch fails, the tool case is not energized.\n\nA \"functional earth\" connection serves a purpose other than electrical safety, and may carry current as part of normal operation. For example, in a single-wire earth return power distribution system, the earth forms one conductor of the circuit and carries all the load current. Other examples of devices that use functional earth connections include surge suppressors and electromagnetic interference filters.\n\nIn low-voltage networks, which distribute the electric power to the widest class of end users, the main concern for design of earthing systems is safety of consumers who use the electric appliances and their protection against electric shocks. The earthing system, in combination with protective devices such as fuses and residual current devices, must ultimately ensure that a person does not come into contact with a metallic object whose potential relative to the person's potential exceeds a \"safe\" threshold, typically set at about 50 V.\n\nOn electricity networks with a system voltage of 240 V to 1.1 kV, which are mostly used in industrial / mining equipment / machines rather than publicly accessible networks, the earthing system design is as equally important from safety point of view as for domestic users.\nIn most developed countries, 220 V, 230 V, or 240 V sockets with earthed contacts were introduced either just before or soon after World War II, though with considerable national variation in popularity. In the United States and Canada, 120 V power outlets installed before the mid-1960s generally did not include a ground (earth) pin. In the developing world, local wiring practice may not provide a connection to an earthing pin of an outlet. \nFor a time, US National Electrical Code allowed certain major appliances permanently connected to the supply to use the supply neutral wire as the equipment enclosure connection to ground. This was not permitted for plug-in equipment as the neutral and energized conductor could easily be accidentally exchanged, creating a severe hazard. If the neutral was interrupted, the equipment enclosure would no longer be connected to ground. Normal imbalances in a split phase distribution system could create objectionable neutral to ground voltages. Recent editions of the NEC no longer permit this practice. For these reasons, most countries have now mandated dedicated protective earth connections that are now almost universal.\n\nIf the fault path between accidentally energized objects and the supply connection has low impedance, the fault current will be so large that the circuit overcurrent protection device (fuse or circuit breaker) will open to clear the ground fault. Where the earthing system does not provide a low-impedance metallic conductor between equipment enclosures and supply return (such as in a TT separately earthed system), fault currents are smaller, and will not necessarily operate the overcurrent protection device. In such case a residual current detector is installed to detect the current leaking to ground and interrupt the circuit.\n\nInternational standard IEC 60364 distinguishes three families of earthing arrangements, using the two-letter codes TN, TT, and IT.\n\nThe first letter indicates the connection between earth and the power-supply equipment (generator or transformer):\n\nThe second letter indicates the connection between earth or network and the electrical device being supplied:\n\nIn a TN earthing system, one of the points in the generator or transformer is connected with earth, usually the star point in a three-phase system. The body of the electrical device is connected with earth via this earth connection at the transformer.\nThis arrangement is a current standard for residential and industrial electric systems particularly in Europe.\n\nThe conductor that connects the exposed metallic parts of the consumer's electrical installation is called\n\"protective earth\" (\"PE\"; see also: Ground). The conductor that connects to the star point in a three-phase system, or that carries the return current in a single-phase system, is called \"neutral\" (\"N\"). Three variants of TN systems are distinguished:\n\nIt is possible to have both TN-S and TN-C-S supplies taken from the same transformer. For example, the sheaths on some underground cables corrode and stop providing good earth connections, and so homes where high resistance \"bad earths\" are found may be converted to TN-C-S. This is only possible on a network when the neutral is suitably robust against failure, and conversion is not always possible. The PEN must be suitably reinforced against failure, as an open circuit PEN can impress full phase voltage on any exposed metal connected to the system earth downstream of the break. The alternative is to provide a local earth and convert to TT.\nThe main attraction of a TN network is the low impedance earth path allows easy automatic disconnection (ADS) on a high current circuit in the case of a line-to-PE short circuit as the same breaker or fuse will operate for either L-N or L-PE faults, and an RCD is not needed to detect earth faults.\n\nIn a TT (terre-terre) earthing system, the protective earth connection for the consumer is provided by a local earth electrode, (sometimes referred to as the Terra-Firma connection) and there is another independently installed at the generator. There is no 'earth wire' between the two.\nThe fault loop impedance is higher, and unless the electrode impedance is very low indeed, a TT installation should always have an RCD (GFCI) as its first isolator.\n\nThe big advantage of the TT earthing system is the reduced conducted interference from other users' connected equipment. TT has always been preferable for special applications like telecommunication sites that benefit from the interference-free earthing. Also, TT networks do not pose any serious risks in the case of a broken neutral. In addition, in locations where power is distributed overhead, earth conductors are not at risk of becoming live should any overhead distribution conductor be fractured by, say, a fallen tree or branch.\n\nIn pre-RCD era, the TT earthing system was unattractive for general use because of the difficulty of arranging reliable automatic disconnection (ADS) in the case of a line-to-PE short circuit (in comparison with TN systems, where the same breaker or fuse will operate for either L-N or L-PE faults). But as residual current devices mitigate this disadvantage, the TT earthing system has become much more attractive providing that all AC power circuits are RCD-protected. In some countries (such as the UK) TT is recommended for situations where a low impedance equipotential zone is impractical to maintain by bonding, where there is significant outdoor wiring, such as supplies to mobile homes and some agricultural settings, or where a high fault current could pose other dangers, such as at fuel depots or marinas.\n\nThe TT earthing system is used throughout Japan, with RCD units in most industrial settings. This can impose added requirements on variable frequency drives and switched-mode power supplies which often have substantial filters passing high frequency noise to the ground conductor.\n\nThe TT (terre-terre) earthing system\n\nIn an IT network (isolé-terre), the electrical distribution system has no connection to earth at all, or it has only a high impedance connection.\n\nWhile the national wiring regulations for buildings of many countries follow the IEC 60364 terminology, in North America (United States and Canada), the term \"equipment grounding conductor\" refers to equipment grounds and ground wires on branch circuits, and \"grounding electrode conductor\" is used for conductors bonding an earth ground rod (or similar) to a service panel. \"Grounded conductor\" is the system \"neutral\".\nAustralian and New Zealand standards use a modified PME earthing system called Multiple Earthed Neutral (MEN). The neutral is grounded (earthed) at each consumer service point thereby effectively bringing the neutral potential difference to zero along the whole length of LV lines.\nIn the UK and some Commonwealth countries, the term \"PNE\", meaning Phase-Neutral-Earth is used to indicate that three (or more for non-single-phase connections) conductors are used, i.e., PN-S.\n\nA resistance earth system is used for mining in India as per Central Electricity Authority Regulations. Instead of a solid connection of neutral to earth, a neutral grounding resistor (NGR) is used to limit the current to ground to less than 750 mA. Due to the fault current restriction it is safer for gassy mines.\n\nThe neutral earthing resistor is monitored to detect an interrupted ground connection and to shut off power if a fault is detected.\n\nTo avoid accidental shock, current sensing circuits are used at the source to isolate the power when leakage current exceed a certain limit. Residual-current devices (RCDs, RCCBs or GFCIs) are used for this purpose. Previously, a earth leakage circuit breaker is used. In industrial applications, earth leakage relays are used with separate core balanced current transformers. This protection works in the range of milli-Amps and can be set from 30 mA to 3000 mA.\n\nA separate pilot wire is run from distribution/ equipment supply system in addition to earth wire, to supervise the continuity of the wire. This is used in the trailing cables of mining machinery. If the earth wire is broken, the pilot wire allows a sensing device at the source end to interrupt power to the machine. This type of circuit is a must for portable heavy electric equipment (like LHD (Load, Haul, Dump machine)) being used in under ground mines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn high-voltage networks (above 850 volts\n), which are far less accessible to the general public, the focus of earthing system design is less on safety and more on reliability of supply, reliability of protection, and impact on the equipment in presence of a short circuit. Only the magnitude of phase-to-ground short circuits, which are the most common, is significantly affected with the choice of earthing system, as the current path is mostly closed through the earth. Three-phase HV/MV power transformers, located in distribution substations, are the most common source of supply for distribution networks, and type of grounding of their neutral determines the earthing system.\n\nThere are five types of neutral earthing:\n\nIn \"solid\" or \"directly\" earthed neutral, transformer's star point is directly connected to the ground. In this solution, a low-impedance path is provided for the ground fault current to close and, as result, their magnitudes are comparable with three-phase fault currents. Since the neutral remains at the potential close to the ground, voltages in unaffected phases remain at levels similar to the pre-fault ones; for that reason, this system is regularly used in high-voltage transmission networks, where insulation costs are high.\n\nTo limit short circuit earth fault an additional neutral earthing resistor (NER) is added between the neutral of transformer's star point and earth.\n\nWith low resistance fault current limit is relatively high. In India it is restricted for 50 A for open cast mines according to Central Electricity Authority Regulations, CEAR, 2010, rule 100.\n\nHigh resistance grounding system grounds the neutral through a resistance which limits the ground fault current to a value equal to or slightly greater than the capacitive charging current of that system\n\nIn \"unearthed\", \"isolated\" or \"floating neutral\" system, as in the IT system, there is no direct connection of the star point (or any other point in the network) and the ground. As a result, ground fault currents have no path to be closed and thus have negligible magnitudes. However, in practice, the fault current will not be equal to zero: conductors in the circuit — particularly underground cables — have an inherent capacitance towards the earth, which provides a path of relatively high impedance.\n\nSystems with isolated neutral may continue operation and provide uninterrupted supply even in presence of a ground fault. However, while the fault is present, the potential of other two phases relative to the ground reaches formula_1 of the normal operating voltage, creating additional stress for the insulation; insulation failures may inflict additional ground faults in the system, now with much higher currents.\n\nPresence of uninterrupted ground fault may pose a significant safety risk: if the current exceeds 4 A – 5 A an electric arc develops, which may be sustained even after the fault is cleared. For that reason, they are chiefly limited to underground and submarine networks, and industrial applications, where the reliability need is high and probability of human contact relatively low. In urban distribution networks with multiple underground feeders, the capacitive current may reach several tens of amperes, posing significant risk for the equipment.\n\nThe benefit of low fault current and continued system operation thereafter is offset by inherent drawback that the fault location is hard to detect.\n\nAccording to the IEEE standards, the grounding rods made from material such as copper and steel. For choosing a grounding rod there are several selection criteria such as:Corrosion Resistance, diameter depending of the fault current,Conductivity and others. There are several types derived from copper and steel:Copper-Bonded,Stainless-Steel,Solid Copper,Galvanized Steel Ground. In recent decades, they have been developed:chemical grounding rods for low impedance ground(ontains natural electrolytic salts) and Nano-Carbon Fiber Grounding rods.\n\nConnectors for earthing installation are a means of communication between the various components of the earthing and lightning protection installations (earthing rods, earthing conductors, current leads, busbars, etc.).\n\nFor high voltage installations, exothermic welding is used for underground connections.\n\nSoil resistance is a major aspect in the design and calculation of a earthing system/grounding installation. On its resistance depends on the efficiency of the removal of unwanted currents to zero potential (ground).. The resistance of a geological material depends on several components: the presence of metal ores, the temperature of the geological layer, the presence of archeological or structural features, the presence of dissolved salts and contaminants ( Porosity and permeability). There are several basic methods for measuring soil resistance. The measurement is performed with two, three or four electrodes. The measurement methods are:pole-pole,dipole-dipole,pole-dipole,Wenner method,Schlumberger method.\n\n\n"}

Berry was born in Heckmondwike in the West Riding of Yorkshire, where his father worked as a wool-stapler. His most important contribution to the science of hanging was his refinement of the long drop method developed by William Marwood, whom Berry knew quite well. His improvements were intended to diminish mental and physical suffering and some of them remained standard practice until the abolition of capital punishment for murder.\n\nAn insight into Berry's behaviour and methods can be read in the book \"My Experiences as an Executioner\", in which he describes his methods and recalls the final moments of some of the people he executed.\n\nHe served eight years with the Bradford Police Force, then tried himself as a boot salesman. Since he did not earn enough for the upkeep of his family, he applied for the post of executioner after William Marwood died in 1883 but was unsuccessful despite being shortlisted, until the short period of Bartholomew Binns in office was over.\n\nBerry was the first British hangman literate and communicative enough to be able to write freely about his work. He considered that the hangman was the last link in what he called the \"chain of legal retribution\".\n\nHe was the executioner who failed to hang John Babbacombe Lee – \"The Man They Couldn't Hang\" – in 1885. The trap door repeatedly failed to open and Lee's sentence was commuted.\n\nDuring the execution of Robert Goodale on 30 November 1885 at Norwich, the prisoner was given too long a drop so that the rope decapitated him.\n\nBerry's time in office came to an end following interference in his judgement by the prison medical officer at Kirkdale Prison regarding the appropriate length of drop; Berry compromised but the condemned man John Conway was nearly decapitated. In March 1892 Berry wrote his letter of resignation, probably without knowing that in October of the previous year the Home Office had already decided that \"the employment of Berry as Executioner should no longer be recommended to the High Sheriffs.\"\n\nBerry carried out 131 hangings in his seven years in office, including those of five women. James Berry hanged William Bury, a man suspected by some of being Jack the Ripper.

If a ligand for an orphan receptor is later discovered, the receptor is referred to as an \"adopted orphan\". Conversely, the term orphan ligand refers to a biological ligand whose cognate receptor has not yet been identified. \n\nExamples of orphan receptors are found in the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and nuclear receptor families.\n\nIf an endogenous ligand is found, the orphan receptor is \"adopted\" or \"de-orphanized\". An example is the nuclear receptor Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and the GPCR TGR5/GPCR19/G protein-coupled bile acid receptor, both of which are activated by bile acids. Adopted orphan receptors in the nuclear receptor group include FXR, liver X receptor (LXR), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR). Another example of an orphan receptor site is the PCP binding site in the NMDA receptor, a type of ligand-gated ion channel. This site is where the recreational drug PCP works, but no endogenous ligand is known to bind to this site.\n\nGPCR orphan receptors are usually given the name \"GPR\" followed by a number, for example GPR1. In the GPCR family, nearly 100 receptor-like genes remain orphans. \n\nHistorically, receptors were discovered by using ligands to \"fish\" for their receptors. Hence by definition, these receptors were not orphans. However, with modern molecular biology techniques such as screening of cDNA libraries and whole genome sequencing, receptors have been identified based on sequence similarity to known receptors, without knowing what their ligands are.\n\n"}

In 1762 he became secretary of a second Society of Aurelians. He was a skilled artist, displaying some of his insect drawings at the Royal Academy in 1785. He drew and engraved illustrations for books including Dru Drury's \"Illustrations of Natural History\" (3 volumes, 1770–1782) and John Coakley Lettsom's \"The Naturalist's and Traveller's Companion\" (1772).\n\nIn the \"Natural System of Colours\" (between 1769 and 1776) he examined the work of Isaac Newton and tried to reveal the multitude of colours which can be created from three basic ones. \"Natural System of Colours\" was published again in 1811, this time edited by Thomas Martyn and dedicated to the second President of the Royal Academy, Benjamin West. As a naturalist, Harris wished to understand the relationships between the colours, and how they are coded, and his book attempted to explain the principles, \"materially, or by the painters art\", by which further colours can be produced from red, yellow and blue. Harris showed what is now known as the subtractive mixing of colours, observing that black is formed by superimposition of the three basic colours.\n\nHarris published his \"The Aurelian or natural history of English insects\" in 1766. In 1780 he followed this up with the first scientific descriptions of several Odonata including the banded demoiselle, \"Calopteryx splendens\", and was the first English artist to make illustrations of dragonflies accurate enough to be identified to species. Reviewing his artwork, the odonatologists Albert Orr and Matti Hämäläinen comment that his drawing of a 'large brown' (\"Aeshna grandis\", top left of image) was \"superb\", while the \"perfectly natural colours of the eyes indicate that Harris had examined living individuals of these aeshnids and either coloured the printed copper plates himself or supervised the colourists.\" However, they consider the larva on the same plate far less good, \"a very stiff dorso-lateral view of an aeshnid larva with mask extended. No attempt has been made to depict the eyes, antennae or hinge on the mask or labial palps, all inconceivable omissions for an\nartist of Harris' talent had he actually examined a specimen\", and they suggest he copied it from August Johann Rösel von Rosenhof.\n\nIn 1778, Harris discovered the \"Muscina levida [assimilis]\" species of fly. Two years later, he followed with a discovery of the \"Muscina prolapsa\" species of fly.\n\n\n\nHarris was survived by his wife, and a son, John Harris (1767–1832), a watercolour painter.\n\n\n\n"}

His work centres on ultracold atoms and quantum gases. He was the first scientist worldwide who, with his team, succeeded in realizing a Bose–Einstein condensation of molecules.\n\nGrimm graduated in physics from the University of Hannover in 1986. From 1986 to 1989 he was a post-graduate researcher at the ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology), then went on to the Institute of Spectroscopy of the USSR Academy of Sciences in Troitsk near Moscow for half a year. He spent the next ten years in Heidelberg as a researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics. In 1994, Grimm applied to the University of Heidelberg to qualify as a professor by receiving the \"venia docendi\" in experimental physics. In the year 2000, he was appointed to a chair in experimental physics at the University of Innsbruck, where he has been Dean of the Faculty for Mathematics, Computer Science and Physics since 2005 and Director of the Research Center for Quantum Physics from 2006. Since 2003, Grimm has also held the position of Scientific Director at the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information (IQOQI) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences (ÖAW). Grimm is married, with three children.\n\nThe work of the experimental physicist concentrates on Bose–Einstein condensation of atoms and molecules and on fermionic quantum gases. In 2002 his working group succeeded for the first time ever to produce a Bose–Einstein condensate from caesium atoms. In the following year, the team produced the first Bose–Einstein condensate of molecules (simultaneously with Deborah S. Jin's group at JILA, Boulder, Colorado). In 2004, the Innsbruck scientists achieved a Fermionic condensate. Their work was ranked among the top ten global achievements in the natural sciences for that year by \"Science\". In his work on collective oscillations and pairing energies, Grimm found first evidence of the flow of particles without any loss of energy (superfluidity) in Fermi condensates. Meanwhile, Grimm and his team have succeeded in producing more complex molecules in ultracold quantum gases. Currently Grimm is concentrating his efforts on producing mixed condensation from atoms of different elements. In 2006, his working group also managed to lift the veil on an old mystery of physics: they succeeded in the first experimental observation of Efimov states, mysterious quantum states that the Russian scientist Vitali Efimov had theoretically predicted in the early 1970s.\n\nGrimm has received numerous awards for his achievements. In 2005 he was presented with the Wittgenstein Award, Austria's highest scientific accolade. In the same year, the Austrian daily paper Die Presse made him „Austrian (Researcher) of the Year 2005\". Years before, he had won the Gerhard Hess Prize, a new blood stipend of the German Research Foundation (DFG) (1996), and the Silver Medal of the ETH Zurich (1989). Recently he received the Beller Lectureship Award of the American Physical Society (APS) (2007), the Science Award of the Region of Tyrol (2008) and was named „Austrian Scientist of the Year 2009\" by the Austrian Club of Education and Science Journalists. In 2006, Grimm became a full member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences.\n\n"}

They are commonly found in decaying leaf litter on forest floors, in grass tussocks, flood refuse, moss, and other highly structured and particulate microhabitats.

In addition, the myrmecophilous (\"ant-loving\") behavior of some pselaphine groups (notably certain batrisites, pselaphites, and clavigerites) has inspired behavioral studies. Spectacular morphology and myrmecophilia are both taken to extremes by the Clavigeritae. These are obligate inquilines which have undergone radical changes in body form, including segmental fusions within the abdomen and antennae to form strong, rigid, plate- and club-like structures, respectively.

One who is \"naïve\" may be called a \"naïf\".\n\nIn early use, the word \"naïve\" meant \"natural or innocent\", and did not connote ineptitude. As a French adjective, it is spelled \"naïve\" or \"naïf\". French adjectives have grammatical gender; \"naïf\" is used with masculine nouns and \"naïve\" with feminine nouns. The French noun is \"naïveté\".\n\nThe dots above the \"i\" are a diaeresis (see also Ï). As an unitalicized English word, \"naive\" is now the more usual spelling, although \"naïve\" is unidiomatic rather than incorrect; \"naïf\" often represents the French masculine, but has a secondary meaning as an artistic style. “Naïve” is pronounced as two syllables, with the stress on the second one, in the French manner.\n\nThe naïf appears as a cultural type in two main forms. On the one hand, there is 'the satirical naïf, such as Candide'. Northrop Frye suggested we might call it \"the \"ingénu\" form, after Voltaire's dialogue of that name. \"Here an outsider... grants none of the premises which make the absurdities of society look logical to those accustomed to them\", and serves essentially as a prism to carry the satirical message. Baudrillard indeed, drawing on his Situationist roots, sought to position himself as ingénu in everyday life: \"I play the role of the Danube peasant: someone who knows nothing but suspects something is wrong... I like being in the position of the primitive... \"playing naïve\"\".\n\nOn the other hand, there is the artistic \"naïf - all responsiveness and seeming availability\". Here 'the naïf offers himself as being in process of formation, in search of values and models...always about to adopt some traditional \"mature\" temperament' - in a perpetual adolescent moratorium. Such instances of \"the naïf as a cultural image... offered themselves as essentially responsive to others and open to every invitation... established their identity in indeterminacy\".\n\nDuring the 1960s, \"the naïfs turned toward mysticism and Eastern religions\", feeding into the hippie movement. \"Hippie culture, bastard of the beat generation out of pop, was much like a folk culture - oral, naive, communal, its aphorisms (\"Make love, not war\", \"turn on, tune in, drop out\") intuited, not rationalized\".\n"}

Today, though most of the wine farms are no longer there, there are still a few old Cape Dutch houses like those found in Constantia. The suburb was built in the late 1940s, and was built quickly because of the urgent need for housing for predominantly white, English-speaking South African soldiers returning from World War II.\n\nNearby is Pollsmoor Prison, where Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners were incarcerated by the Apartheid regime. Mandela was there for four years (1984 to 1988) after his transfer from Robben Island, before moving on to Victor Verster Prison until his release on 11 February 1990. \n\nSome of Tokai's roads are paved with red brick. Streams run through Tokai and the pine plantations, forming green belts where various bird, frog, and insect species make their home. These green belts also provide areas for recreation including walking, cycling and dog walking. The once extensive pine plantations were, until recently, regarded as a prime spot to observe predatory birds, including hawks, buzzards, owls and certain eagle species. \n\nSome of the last tiny remnants of Cape Flats Sand Fynbos can be found around here (although even these remnants have been partially covered with pine plantations). This is the only spot in the entire world where this endangered vegetation type survives in a sustainably large area, and work is under way to provide it with long-term protection.\n\nIn recent years Tokai residents have seen the development of their neighbourhood as a result of families migrating southwards from the Gauteng region. This population expansion, coupled with the scarcity of available land in Cape Town has made Tokai an attractive option for many people. Popular cafes and restaurants have slowly been popping up in the area and efforts have been made to entice younger people to make Tokai their home. This neighbourhood is popular because of the accessibility to the forest, bike trails, the mountain and Steenberg wine and golf estate. \n"}

{"id": "2252114", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2252114", "title": "Belonger status", "text": "Belonger status\n\nBelonger status is a legal classification normally associated with British Overseas Territories. It refers to people who have close ties to a specific territory, normally by birth or ancestry. The requirements for belonger status, and the rights that it confers, vary from territory to territory.\n\nThe rights associated with belonger status normally include the right to vote, to hold elected office, to own real property without the necessity for a licence, to reside in that territory without immigration restrictions, and to freely accept employment without the requirement of a work permit. In general, to be born with belonger status a person must be born in a territory to a parent who holds belonger status. Belonger status can sometimes be passed to a child born outside the territory, but this is purposely limited, to minimise the number of belongers who will not live in the territory. \nIn most independent countries, these rights would be associated with citizenship or nationality. However, as the British Overseas Territories are not independent countries, they cannot confer citizenship. Instead, people with close ties to Britain's Overseas Territories all hold the same nationality: British Overseas Territories Citizen (BOTC). The status of BOTC is defined by the British Nationality Act 1981 and subsequent amendments.\n\nBOTC, however, does not confer any right to live in any British Overseas Territory, including the territory from which it is derived. It is the possession of belonger status that provides the right. Acquisition of belonger status in a British Overseas Territory does not automatically confer BOTC, but most people holding such status are eligible for registration or naturalisation as a BOTC upon meeting the requirements of the 1981 Act. Similarly, it is possible to lose belonger status in a territory while retaining BOTC or British citizenship.\n\nThe British Overseas Territories Act 2002 also conferred British Citizenship upon BOTCs (other than those solely connected with the Sovereign Base Areas of Cyprus), which provides for a right of abode in the United Kingdom. The conferral is in addition to their BOTC and was not reciprocal in nature, and British citizens did not receive any rights to reside in the Overseas Territories without permission. The act also changed the reference of British Dependent Territories to British Overseas Territories. It was enacted five years after the United Kingdom relinquished sovereignty over its most populous dependent territory, Hong Kong, to the People's Republic of China.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the belonger status was renamed to permanent resident status in 1987. Only permanent residents and residents who have been resident in Hong Kong for seven years, regardless of citizenship or nationality, have the right to vote, to contest in elections, to hold public offices, to freely accept employment without work permit requirement, to reside without immigration restrictions, and to the right of abode within the territory.\n\nSince 1997, the right to hold principal offices has been restricted to those who are concurrently permanent residents and nationals of the Special Administrative Region, who have no right of abode in other countries. Also, the number of members of the territory's Legislative Council who have foreign right of abode has been capped at 20%.\n\nAnguilla Constitution - Section 80. Belonger status\n\nThe term \"belonger\" appears only in the Bermuda Constitution Order of 1968, \"A person shall be deemed to belong to Bermuda...\".\n\nBelongers include those possessing Bermudian status; naturalised British Overseas Territories citizens; the wives of Bermudians or naturalised British Overseas Territories citizens; and the children under the age of eighteen of Bermudians, naturalised British Overseas Territories citizens, and their wives. Other laws typically only use the term \"Bermudian status\", neglecting to deal with other Belongers. A couple of recent court decisions in 2016 - 2017 have held that references to Bermudians should also be read as including other Belongers in the context of immigration law, company ownership and land ownership.\n\nOnly Bermudian status-holders may vote in island elections. With limited exceptions, only Belongers and the spouses of Bermudians may own land, live or work on the island without a permit.\n\nAlso with limited exceptions, Belongers must hold at least 60% of the shares and be at least 60% of the directors of companies doing business in Bermuda. This requirement does not apply to international business companies (known locally as \"exempted companies\"), which may have an office in Bermuda but may only trade outside Bermuda.\n\nUnder the current law, those born in Bermuda to at least one Bermudian parent, and those who live on the island while a spouse of a Bermudian for 10 years, are eligible for Bermudian status. Potentially extending Bermudian status to others is perennially one of the most politically-contentious issues on the island.\n\nIn the British Virgin Islands there are two forms of status: Belongership and BVIslander status. The two forms of status overlap to some degree, although it is possible to be a Belonger without being a BVIslander. BVIslander status is the 'senior' form of status and that is only conferred on those who have at least one grandparent born in the territory. Belonger status can be acquired in several ways, but generally it is granted as an honour (very rare), by naturalisation or it can be acquired after a qualifying period (three years at the present time) after marriage to a BVIslander. All BVIslanders and Belongers can vote, but only BVIslanders can hold a British Virgin Islands passport. It is possible to have BOTC status and be a Belonger but not a BVIslander if the person with BOTC status comes from another British Overseas Territory and has married a BVIslander.\n\nThe definition of qualifications for Belonger status in the British Virgin Islands is contained in section 2(2) of the Constitution:\n\nA person belongs to the Virgin Islands if that person\n\n(a) is born in the Virgin Islands and at the time of the birth his or her father or mother is or was\n\n(b) is born in the Virgin Islands of a father or mother who belongs to the Virgin Islands by birth or descent or who, if deceased, would, if alive, so belong to the Virgin Islands;\n\n(c) is a child adopted in the Virgin Islands by a person who belongs to the Virgin Islands by birth or descent;\n\n(d) is born outside the Virgin Islands of a father or mother who is a British overseas territories citizen by virtue of birth in the Virgin Islands or descent from a father or mother who was born in the Virgin Islands or who belongs to the Virgin Islands by virtue of birth in the Virgin Islands or descent from a father or mother who was born in the Virgin Islands;\n\n(e) is a British overseas territories citizen by virtue of registration in the Virgin Islands;\n\n(f) is a person to whom a certificate has been granted under section 16 of the Immigration and Passport Act 1977 of the Virgin Islands (in this subsection referred to as “the Act”, and references to the Act or to any section thereof include references to any enactment amending, replacing or re-enacting the same) and has not been revoked under section 17 of the Act; and (without prejudice to the right of any person to apply for the grant of such a certificate under the Act) a British overseas territories citizen by virtue of naturalisation in the Virgin Islands has a right by virtue of this Constitution to apply for the grant of such a certificate;\n\n(g) is the spouse of a person who belongs to the Virgin Islands and has been granted a certificate under section 16 of the Act; or\n\n(h) was immediately before the commencement of this Constitution deemed to belong to the Virgin Islands by virtue of the Virgin Islands (Constitution) Order 1976(3).\n\nThe British Virgin Islands is extremely restrictive about conferring Belongership status on immigrants to the Territory. Under the leadership of Orlando Smith the Government formally committed itself to naturalising no more than 25 persons a year. This was maintained when Dr. Smith's NDP party was no longer in office.\n\nThe Caymanian Status and Permanent Residency Board may, upon application, grant the right to be Caymanian to persons in the categories below. \nPersons who may apply to the Chief Immigration Officer for the right to be Caymanian\n\nA person who\nmay apply no later than 21 December 2007 to the Chief Immigration Officer for the right to be Caymanian. The Chief Immigration Officer is required by law, save in exceptional circumstances, to grant such an application.\n\nBelonger status in the Falkland Islands is officially referred to as \"Falkland Islands status\".\n\nAs with Bermuda, the term itself has been supplanted by \"Gibraltarian status\".\n\nA person is eligible to be registered as a Gibraltarian if they are a British national and:\n\n\nAdditionally, a person may be registered as a Gibraltarian at the discretion of the Government of Gibraltar minister with responsibility for personal status if they satisfy the minister that:\n\n\nA person shall be regarded as a Montserratian if that person —\n\n(a) is a British overseas territories citizen who was born in Montserrat; or\n\n(b) is a British overseas territories citizen who was born outside Montserrat and \n\n(c) was born in or outside Montserrat of a father or mother who was born in Montserrat and is regarded (or, if deceased, would if alive be regarded) as a Montserratian by virtue of this subsection; or\n\n(d) has been granted Montserratian status in accordance with any law; or\n\n(e) was immediately before the commencement of this Constitution deemed to belong to Montserrat by virtue of any law.\n\nThe equivalent to belonger status in the Pitcairn Islands is the 'right of abode', which is a status that is specifically protected by Article 22 of the Pitcairn Constitution, namely that a holder \"cannot be arbitrarily deprived of this right\". Persons with the 'right to abode' in Pitcairn can apply to the Governor for a 'certificate of entitlement' as evidence of this right. As with other BOTs, this can be obtained through birth, descent or through a form of naturalisation that is linked to permanent residence.\n\nThe Right of Abode Ordinance 2010 provides a number of ways through which a person acquires 'right of abode' status as of right.\n\nIf a child obtains British nationality at the time of birth, they also acquire 'right of abode' status as of right if:\n\nA child, stepchild or a legally adopted child of a person who has a 'right of abode in Pitcairn' will also have a 'right of abode' whilst they remain under the age of eighteen years (\"s.2(6)\").\n\nIf the right of abode has not been obtained as of right, it can only be obtained under the Right of Abode Ordinance 2010 if that person has first has acquired a right of permanent residence (\"s.2(4)-(5)\") under the Immigration Ordinance 2014.\n\nUnder the Immigration Ordinance, an application for permanent residence will be considered by the Governor after consultation with the Island Council (\"s.12(2)\") when applications are received from:\n\nA child that is born outside of Pitcairn to a person who is permanently resident in Pitcairn at the time of birth will also gain permanent residence if they move to Pitcairn before the age 5. (\"s.13\").\n\nIf the right of permanent residence has thus been acquired, that person can then acquire 'right of abode' status under the Right of Abode Ordinance 2010 if:\n\nIn both cases, British law indicates that this is normally becomes possible (with conditions) after five years' residence, or after three years' residence for the spouse of an existing British overseas territories citizen.\n\nThere are two main ways through which a person acquires Turks and Caicos Islander Status.\n\nThere are three ways through which a person acquires TCI Status as of right. \n\nIn order to obtain Turks and Caicos Islander status by grant, it is necessary to complete the prescribed application form and submit it to the appropriate authority.\n\nThere are several routes through which a person may apply for Turks and Caicos Islander status.\n\nBelonger status of the former British colony of Hong Kong was changed to 'Hong Kong permanent resident status' on 1 January 1987. The name remains unchanged after the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong in 1997.\n\n"}

{"id": "2252137", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2252137", "title": "WCCT-TV", "text": "WCCT-TV\n\nWCCT-TV, virtual channel 20 (UHF digital channel 33), branded on-air as CW 20, is a CW-affiliated television station licensed to Waterbury, Connecticut, United States and serving the Hartford–New Haven television market. The station is owned by Tegna Inc., as part of a duopoly with Hartford-licensed Fox affiliate WTIC-TV (channel 61). The two stations share studios on Broad Street in downtown Hartford and transmitter facilities on Rattlesnake Mountain in Farmington, Connecticut. On cable, WCCT-TV is carried primarily on channel 11 throughout the market.\n\nThe station commenced operations on September 10, 1953 as WATR-TV on channel 53, the second UHF station in Connecticut. It was owned by the Thomas and Gilmore families, along with WATR radio (1320 AM). The station's studios and transmitter were located on West Peak in Meriden. At the time, the station's signal only covered Waterbury, New Haven and the southern portion of the state.\n\nWATR-TV was originally a dual secondary affiliate of both DuMont and ABC, sharing them with New Haven-based WNHC-TV (channel 8, now WTNH). DuMont ceased operations in 1956, and shortly afterward, WNHC-TV became an exclusive ABC affiliate, as did WATR-TV. Both stations carried ABC programming through Connecticut.\n\nIn 1962, the station relocated to UHF channel 20 and moved to a new studio and transmitter site in Prospect, south of Waterbury. Channel 53 was later occupied by WEDN, Connecticut Public Television's outlet in Norwich.\n\nIn August 1966, WATR-TV joined NBC. At the time, the network's primary affiliate in Connecticut, WHNB-TV (channel 30) in New Britain, was hampered by a weak signal in New Haven and the southwestern portions of the state. In the 1970s, the station offered limited local news and instead aired older syndicated programs and religious shows such as \"The PTL Club\" when NBC programs were not offered. A notable local production was \"Journeys to the Mind\", a half-hour talk show with host Joel Dobbin, which approached topics of the occult with a serious and sober tone. \"Journeys\" ran from 1976 to 1981.\n\nThe original Viacom bought WHNB-TV in 1978 and changed its call letters to WVIT. Two years later, after WVIT more than doubled its transmission power to cover New Haven, it became clear that WATR-TV's NBC affiliation was now in jeopardy. In 1981, the Thomas/Gilmore family opted to sell channel 20 to a joint venture of Odyssey Television Partners (later to become Renaissance Broadcasting) and Oppenheimer and Company. The sale was announced in May 1981 and gained FCC approval that December.\n\nThe new owners of channel 20 ultimately opted to drop NBC and convert the station into an independent outlet (though NBC was considering ending its affiliation in any event). On March 22, 1982—the same day the NBC affiliation ended—channel 20 changed its call letters to WTXX, and subsequently became Connecticut's first full-service independent station since Hartford's WHCT-TV (channel 18, now Univision affiliate WUVN) served as an independent from 1957 to 1975. Soon after taking over, Odyssey replaced channel 20's tiny 250-foot tower with a more powerful transmitter that more than doubled its signal and gave it a coverage area comparable with the major network stations in the state. Programming consisted of the typical independent fare of off-network series, movies, and cartoons presented by the local children's show \"Kidstime with T.X. Critter\", a puppet created by and puppeteered by Paul Fusco who later created ALF. WTXX also carried some sports, most notably New York Mets telecasts from WOR-TV in New York City (now MyNetworkTV flagship WWOR-TV in Secaucus, New Jersey) and Boston Celtics telecasts from WLVI-TV in Boston. WTXX prospered in its new status, and continued to do so even after WTIC-TV signed on in 1984 and took on the Fox affiliation two years later.\n\nIn October 1992, Renaissance Broadcasting sold WTXX to Counterpoint Communications, a nonprofit media firm with close ties to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hartford. Renaissance had recently acquired several stations, including WTIC-TV, from Chase Broadcasting, and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations of the time did not allow common ownership of two stations in the same market. However, Renaissance retained the rights to all the programming it bought for WTXX. WTIC-TV wanted to establish a full-time local marketing agreement (LMA) with WTXX, which basically amounted to channel 20 being programmed by its main competitor. Counterpoint balked, wanting only a part-time agreement. Renaissance then moved some of WTXX's stronger shows to WTIC-TV, leaving the station with a considerably weakened schedule.\n\nRenaissance's sale of WTXX to Counterpoint, and Renaissance's subsequent acquisition of WTIC-TV, became official in March 1993. Under the terms of the sale to Counterpoint, WTXX retained few syndicated programs and some movies, and began airing programming from the Home Shopping Network for 15 hours a day (including daytime and prime time). In addition, channel 20 would air a daily Catholic Mass, along with other Catholic religious programs, for one hour per day. While trying to negotiate an LMA, WTXX continued to run some Renaissance-owned programming daily from 3 to 7 p.m. free of charge. These shows were the \"Disney Afternoon\" cartoon block, double runs of \"The Cosby Show\" and \"Growing Pains\" on weekdays, and some hour-long first-run syndicated dramas on weekends. Renaissance sold the ad time for the slot and WTXX paid nothing to run the programming during these hours. That July, after negotiations with WTIC collapsed, WTXX entered into a part-time LMA with WVIT. Its schedule now included cartoons and children's programs during the morning and afternoon hours, and syndicated shows whose local rights were owned by WVIT during the early evenings. Most of the cartoons were shows WTXX previously had on a barter basis that WTIC had no room for. \"The Disney Afternoon\" and other syndicated shows previously on WTXX moved to WTIC or stopped airing in the market. Home Shopping Network programming remained during middays, prime time, and the overnight hours.\n\nWTXX became Connecticut's UPN affiliate on April 3, 1995; for the 2½ months prior to that, Hartford viewers who wanted to watch UPN programming had to view it on cable, by way of WSBK-TV from Boston; viewers in Fairfield County were able to watch UPN programming over-the-air and on cable via WWOR-TV. Initially, it continued to run Home Shopping Network in prime time on nights without UPN programming. By spring 1996, the station expanded its LMA with WVIT to cover the entire day, except for overnights and the hours when the Catholic Mass aired. By this point, WTXX upgraded its syndicated programming, and HSN was relegated to overnights before being dropped completely.\n\nIn 1998, WVIT was sold to NBC and WTIC (now owned by Tribune Broadcasting) replaced WVIT as WTXX's LMA partner. As part of the deal, some of the shows previously owned by WVIT were kept by WTXX and WTIC. The LMA change caused no impact on WTXX's daily broadcasts of the Catholic Mass, which continues to the present day. Around this time, the station changed its on-air name from \"UPN 20\" to \"Connecticut's 20\". It also picked up Boston Red Sox baseball games; the station's feed (with the \"Connecticut's 20\" bug) was carried during Red Sox highlights airing on ESPN for much of the late 1990s and early 2000s. In 1999, WTXX and WTIC consolidated their operations in a new facility at One Corporate Center on Church Street in Downtown Hartford.\n\nOn January 1, 2001, WTXX and WBNE (channel 59, now WCTX) swapped affiliations, with WTXX joining The WB and rebranding as \"Connecticut's WB\". Later that year, Tribune purchased WTXX outright, creating a duopoly with WTIC. Tribune, having already received a temporary waiver from FCC rules barring common ownership of a newspaper and a television station in the same area when it purchased the \"Hartford Courant\" a year earlier, received an additional waiver for its purchase of WTXX. Tribune had been seeking a waiver in anticipation of the FCC relaxing its rules to allow such media combinations to exist with the agency's blessing, which would include television duopolies. In March 2005, the FCC requested that Tribune sell WTXX to a new owner, which they never did. In late 2007, the FCC loosened its restrictions on newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership perhaps creating an opening for Tribune (which was purchased by investor Sam Zell in December 2007) to retain WTXX without a waiver.\n\nOn January 24, 2006, Time Warner announced that the company would merge the operations of The WB with CBS Corporation's UPN (which CBS acquired one month earlier in December 2005 following its split from Viacom), to form a 50/50 joint venture called The CW Television Network. The network signed a ten-year affiliation agreement with Tribune Broadcasting for 16 of the 19 WB affiliates that the company owned at the time, including WTXX.\nIn August 2008, the station changed its branding from \"CW 20\" to \"txx\" in a corporate effort by Tribune to strengthen its CW affiliates' local identities and reduce the dependence on the use of network branding. In June 2009, after 56 years of transmitting from various locations in New Haven County, WTXX shut down its transmitter in Prospect and moved to space on WTIC-TV's tower in Farmington.\n\nIn July 2010, the station changed its branding again to \"The CT\" with \"The CT is the place 2B\" slogan; to go along with this branding, the station changed its call letters to WCCT-TV on June 18. In March 2012, the station changed its logo and began to use its calls, WCCT-TV, as its branding, though the station remains a CW affiliate. In August 2018, WCCT-TV returned to the \"CW 20\" branding, marking the first time in 10 years that the station has identified itself with its channel number.\n\nOn July 10, 2013, Tribune announced plans to spin off its publishing division into a separate company, with the split finalized in 2014. WTIC-TV and WCCT-TV remained with the Tribune Company (which also retained all non-publishing assets, including the broadcasting, digital media and Media Services units), while its newspapers (including the \"Hartford Courant\") became part of the similarly named Tribune Publishing Company.\n\nOn May 8, 2017, Hunt Valley, Maryland-based Sinclair Broadcast Group announced that it would acquire Tribune Media for $3.9 billion, plus the assumption of $2.7 billion in debt held by Tribune. Three weeks after the FCC's July 18 vote to have the deal reviewed by an administrative law judge amid \"serious concerns\" about Sinclair's forthrightness in its applications to sell certain conflict properties, on August 9, 2018, Tribune announced it would terminate the Sinclair deal, intending to seek other M&A opportunities. Tribune also filed a breach of contract lawsuit in the Delaware Chancery Court, alleging that Sinclair engaged in protracted negotiations with the FCC and the U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division over regulatory issues, refused to sell stations in markets where it already had properties, and proposed divestitures to parties with ties to Sinclair executive chair David D. Smith that were rejected or highly subject to rejection to maintain control over stations it was required to sell.\n\nOn December 3, 2018, Irving, Texas-based Nexstar Media Group—which has owned ABC affiliate WTNH and MyNetworkTV affiliate WCTX since January 2017—announced it would acquire the assets of Tribune Media for $6.4 billion in cash and debt. As FCC regulations prohibit common ownership of more than two stations in the same media market, or two or more of the four highest-rated stations in the market, Nexstar was required to sell two of the stations (including one ranking among the top four in total-day viewership) to a separate, unrelated company to address the ownership conflict. On March 20, 2019, McLean, Virginia-based Tegna Inc. announced it would purchase WTIC and WCCT from Nexstar upon consummation of the merger, as part of the company's sale of nineteen Nexstar- and Tribune-operated stations to Tegna and the E. W. Scripps Company in separate deals worth $1.32 billion; this made the WTIC/WCCT duopoly the first television properties in Connecticut and southern New England for Tegna. The sale was completed on September 19, 2019.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nWCCT-TV (as WTXX) shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 20, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition VHF channel 12 to UHF channel 20 for post-transition operations. The digital signal's change in channel location was necessary to avoid interference with PBS member WHYY-TV in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nWCCT holds the local broadcast television rights to the WNBA's Connecticut Sun. The station also simulcasts most New York Yankees and New York Mets games aired by New York City sister station WPIX.\n\nUnder \"The CT\" branding starting in July 2010, the station programmed by blocks:\nAlso, during the CT branding, the station broadcast a tour of seven local colleges.\n\nIn July 1993, WTXX debuted a nightly 10 p.m. newscast produced by NBC station WVIT, called \"Connecticut News Live at 10\". The news team consisted of WVIT's evening news team (anchors Gerry Brooks and Joanne Nesti, weather from Brad Field, Beasley Reece with sports), along with reporters from WVIT. In 1998, when WTIC replaced WVIT as WTXX's LMA partner, the WVIT-produced broadcasts were replaced with a simulcast of the first half-hour of WTIC's nightly 10 p.m. newscast; on April 24, 2006, the station began simulcasting the entire newscast. The station did not use a separate news open for the broadcasts; however when Fox entertainment or sports programming delayed the newscast on WTIC, it was aired on WTXX under the title \"News at Ten\" and used a \"News at Ten\" logo bug in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen in place of WTIC's news branding.\n\nOn December 12, 2009; WTIC, WCCT (then WTXX), and the \"Hartford Courant\" moved into new combined newsroom facilities in downtown Hartford, and WTIC rebranded from \"Fox 61\" to \"Fox CT\" (a transition completed in July 2010); in addition, WTIC became the second station in the market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. The news simulcasts on WCCT were included in the transition.\n\nIn June 2010, the station ended the simulcast of WTIC's 10 p.m. newscast. It now airs a rebroadcast of WTIC's 11 p.m. newscast at 1 a.m. weeknights, while the 10 p.m. newscast is re-aired on weekends; these rebroadcasts include a sports highlight program called \"Xfinity Sports Desk\" at 1:45 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday nights. Originally, this was not simulcast on WTXX but has since been added (the 10 p.m. newscast continues to be shown live on WCCT, if it is preempted on WTIC due to sports programming overruns). The station also carries the 8 a.m. hour of WTIC's morning newscast (a previous simulcast of \"Fox 61 Morning News\" had aired at one point, but was later dropped). WTIC also produces a weekly public affairs show called \"The Real Story\", which airs Sunday mornings at 8:30 a.m. with a repeat on WCCT at 11 a.m.\n\nOther than simulcasts and default carriage of WTIC's newscasts in the event of Fox Sports programming delays, WCCT does not carry traditional local newscasts produced specifically for the station; as such, the station was one of only two Tribune-owned stations not carrying their own daily newscasts (alongside WNOL/New Orleans).\n\n"}
{"id": "2252141", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2252141", "title": "Help! (song)", "text": "Help! (song)\n\n\"Help!\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles that served as the title song for the 1965 film and its soundtrack album. It was released as a single in July 1965, and was number one for three weeks in the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nCredited to Lennon–McCartney, \"Help!\" was written by John Lennon with some help from Paul McCartney. During an interview with \"Playboy\" in 1980, Lennon recounted: \"The whole Beatles thing was just beyond comprehension. I was subconsciously crying out for help\".\n\nIt was ranked at number 29 on \"Rolling Stone\"'s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\nThe documentary series \"The Beatles Anthology\" revealed that Lennon wrote the lyrics of the song to express his stress after the Beatles' quick rise to success. \"I was fat and depressed and I \"was\" crying out for 'Help, Lennon told \"Playboy\". Writer Ian MacDonald describes the song as the first crack in the protective shell Lennon had built around his emotions during the Beatles' rise to fame, and an important milestone in his songwriting style.\n\nIn the 1970 \"Rolling Stone\" \"Lennon Remembers\" interviews, Lennon said that the song was one of his favourites among the Beatles songs he wrote. In these interviews, Lennon said he felt that \"Help!\" and \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" were his most honest, genuine Beatles songs and not just songs \"written to order\". According to Lennon's cousin and boyhood friend Stanley Parkes, \"Help!\" was written after Lennon \"came in from the studio one night. 'God,' he said, 'they've changed the title of the film: it's going to be called 'Help!' now. So I've had to write a new song with the title called 'Help!'.\"\n\nAccording to McCartney, he was called in \"to complete it\", providing the \"countermelody\" arrangement, on 4 April 1965 at Lennon's house in Weybridge.\n\nThe Beatles recorded \"Help!\" in 12 takes on 13 April 1965 using four-track equipment. The first nine takes concentrated on the instrumental backing. The descending lead guitar riff that precedes each verse proved to be difficult, so by take 4 it was decided to postpone it for an overdub. To guide the later overdub by George Harrison, Lennon thumped the beat on his acoustic guitar body, which can be heard in the final stereo mix. Lead and backing vocals were recorded twice onto take 9, along with a tambourine. A reduction mix was applied to the two vocal tracks, taking three attempts (takes 10 to 12), freeing up a track for the lead guitar overdub. This was the group's first use of two 4-track machines for \"bouncing\".\n\nThe vocals were re-recorded for the film during a session on 24 May 1965 at CTS Studios, a facility specializing in post-synchronisation. In addition to attempting a better vocal performance, the session might have been done to eliminate the tambourine (which had been on the same track as the vocals) since no tambourine appeared in the film sequence. With the new vocals, a mono mix was created at CTS Studios which was used for the film soundtrack. Mixes for record releases were prepared on 18 June. For the mono version, Martin decided to use a mix of the opening chorus of take 12 edited to the remainder of the CTS film mix. Because all instruments were combined on a single track for the CTS session, it could not be used for a stereo mix, so the stereo mix was made from take 12.\n\nThis film version of the song was only heard on the original VHS releases of the movie, later replaced by the stereo mixes. A true release was never issued. New mixes were created for releases of the \"Help!\" CD (1987), the \"Love\" album (2006), and the \"Help!\" DVD (2007).\n\n\"Help!\" went to number 1 on both the UK and US singles charts in late summer 1965. It was the fourth of six number 1 singles in a row on the American charts: \"I Feel Fine\", \"Eight Days a Week\", \"Ticket to Ride\", \"Help!\", \"Yesterday\" and \"We Can Work It Out\". At the following year's Ivor Novello Awards, \"Help!\" was named as the second best-selling single of 1965, behind \"We Can Work It Out\". \"Help!\" was nominated in four categories at the 1966 Grammy Awards but failed to win in any of them. \n\nThe song appears on the \"Help!\" LP, the US \"Help!\" soundtrack, \"1962–1966\", the \"\" soundtrack, \"1\", \"Love\", and \"The Capitol Albums, Volume 2\". The mono version (with different vocals and no tambourine) was included on the Beatles' \"Rarities\" LP and in \"The Beatles in Mono\" collection. The American soundtrack album included a James Bond-type introduction to the song, followed by a caesura just before the opening lyric. No such introduction appeared on the British soundtrack album, nor was it included in the released single in either country.\n\nAlthough Lennon was proud of \"Help!\" and the honesty it conveyed, he expressed regret that the Beatles had recorded it at such a fast tempo in the interests of giving the track more commercial appeal. Music critic Dave Marsh refuted this idea, saying: \"'Help!' isn't a compromise; it's bursting with vitality … [Lennon] sounds triumphant, because he's found a group of kindred spirits who are offering the very spiritual assistance and emotional support for which he's begging. Paul's echoing harmonies, Ringo's jaunty drums, the boom of George's guitar speak to the heart of Lennon's passion, and though they cannot cure the wound, at least they add a note of reassurance that he's not alone with his pain.\"\n\nThe Beatles filmed the title performance for the movie \"Help!\" on 22 April 1965. The same footage (without the darts and credits seen in the film sequence) was used as a clip to promote the release of the single. It was shown starting in July 1965 on programmes such as \"Top of the Pops\" and \"Thank Your Lucky Stars\". They made another promotional clip of \"Help!\" on 23 November 1965 for inclusion in the year-end recap special of \"Top of the Pops\". Directed by Joseph McGrath, the black-and-white clip shows the group miming to the song while sitting astride a workbench. Starr holds an umbrella overhead throughout the song, which becomes useful as fake snow falls during the final verse. The November 1965 promo was included in the Beatles' 2015 video compilation \"1\".\n\nThe Beatles performed \"Help!\" live on the 1 August 1965 broadcast of \"Blackpool Night Out\", which was included in the \"Anthology 2\" album and shown during \"The Beatles Anthology\" documentary. On 14 August, the group recorded a live performance of \"Help!\" and five other songs for \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", broadcast the following month; the show is available on the DVD \"The 4 Complete Ed Sullivan Shows Starring The Beatles\".\n\n\"Help!\" was included in the set list for The Beatles' 1965 US tour. The 15 August performance at Shea Stadium was seen in the 1966 documentary \"The Beatles at Shea Stadium\", although the audio for the song was re-recorded prior to release. The group's 29 August performance at the Hollywood Bowl was chosen for the 1977 album \"The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl\". The final live concert performances of \"Help!\" took place on The Beatles' 1965 UK tour in December.\n\n\nThe song reached number one in several other countries in 1965 according to charts listed in \"Billboard's\" \"Hits of the World\" feature at the time: Australia, Hong Kong, New Zealand, and Sweden.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2252162", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2252162", "title": "The Night Before (song)", "text": "The Night Before (song)\n\n\"The Night Before\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1965 film \"Help\" and accompanying album \"Help!\" The song was written by Paul McCartney and credited to Lennon–McCartney.\n\nJohn Lennon plays a Hohner Pianet electric piano throughout the song. The verses have a call and response structure. McCartney's lead vocal alternates with Lennon and George Harrison's harmony, singing the chorus \"Ahhh, the night before …\", the whole being alternated with a second melody. In the opinion of musicologist Walter Everett, had the Beatles recorded \"The Night Before\" at a slower tempo, it \"could have been a Kinks or Animals song\".\n\nThe Beatles recorded the song at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) in London on 17 February 1965. The band achieved a satisfactory rhythm track after two takes, and then overdubbed the vocals, lead guitar parts and maracas. The guitar solo over the third verse is repeated in part over the coda. Among Beatles biographers, Ian MacDonald considers that the playing is more in McCartney's style, while Kenneth Womack credits only McCartney as the soloist and lists Harrison on rhythm guitar, playing his Gretsch Tennessean. However, the solos were performed by Harrison and McCartney together.<ref name=\"O'Toole/SE!\"></ref> Lennon later recalled that Harrison and McCartney played \"the same break exactly, both playing but in different octaves\".\n\nFor the film \"Help!\", the Beatles performed \"The Night Before\" on location at Salisbury Plain. Just as the song finishes, a bomb explodes. The scene was filmed in the shadow of Stonehenge.\n\nThe Beatles performed \"The Night Before\" during their final BBC radio session, on 26 May 1965. Titled \"The Beatles Invite You to Take a Ticket to Ride\", this performance was broadcast on the BBC Light Programme on 7 June that year.\n\nMcCartney played the song on 15 July 2011 at Yankee Stadium, stating from the stage that it was the first time he had performed the song in concert.\n\nAccording to Ian MacDonald unless stated otherwise:\n\n"}
{"id": "2252164", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2252164", "title": "Nationals Park", "text": "Nationals Park\n\nNationals Park is a baseball park along the Anacostia River in the Navy Yard neighborhood of Washington, D.C. It is the home ballpark for Washington Nationals. When the Montreal Expos franchise relocated to Washington, D.C. and became the Nationals, they temporarily played at RFK Stadium until Nationals Park was completed. It is the first LEED-certified green major professional sports stadium in the United States.\n\nThe ballpark, designed by HOK Sport and Devrouax & Purnell Architects and Planners, cost $693 million to build, with an additional $84.2 million spent on transportation, art, and infrastructure upgrades to support the stadium for a total cost of $783.9 million. The stadium has a capacity of 41,339. The Washington Monument and the Capitol building are visible from the upper decks on the first base side of the field.\n\nThe park's name echoes that of the early-1900s ballpark used by the Washington Senators, National Park, until it was rebuilt and renamed Griffith Stadium. \nNationals Park hosted the 2018 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, the first All-Star Game to be played in Washington, D.C. since 1969. It hosted games 3, 4, and 5 of the World Series, the first in the city since .\n\nNationals Park is located in the Southeast quadrant of Washington, D.C. on South Capitol Street (a main artery separating Southeast from Southwest Washington) at the Anacostia River waterfront. The ballpark is accessible from Interstate 395 via the Southwest Freeway, and from Interstate 295 via the Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge, which carries South Capitol Street across the Anacostia River. The Douglass Bridge was renovated so that South Capitol Street could continue at ground level past the stadium (it was previously above ground level).\n\nThe main method of transportation to the stadium is on the Washington Metro system. The stadium is one block from Navy Yard–Ballpark station on the Green Line. The station is located near the park's center field entrance (on the opposite side of Capitol Street SE from the main entrance) and is heavily used by fans on game day. Prior to the ballpark's opening, the station's ballpark entrance underwent a major expansion, with the relocation of the farecard mezzanine to street level, along with the addition of an extra escalator and elevator to handle the crowds.\n\nParking near the stadium is limited. There are a total of 14 Nationals Park-sanctioned parking lots or garages, with a small number of third-party lots also in the vicinity of the stadium. During the 2008 and 2009 seasons, the Nationals ran a free shuttle service (dubbed the \"Nats Express\") from parking lots at RFK Stadium to Nationals Park on game days. However, the team canceled the service after the 2009 season.\n\nSeveral Metrobus routes and the DC Circulator's Eastern Market–L'Enfant Plaza route serve the park. Various other transit options include a water taxi service from Alexandria, Virginia and Georgetown.\n\nCyclists are encouraged to ride to the stadium and are offered free valet bicycle parking. Garage C, located next to the ticket windows at the corner of 1st and N Street, houses a free bike valet service where fans are invited to store their bikes for the duration of the game. There are also 110 red bike racks on the sidewalks that create the perimeter of the ballpark.\n\nAfter it was announced that the Expos would leave Montreal, Washington, DC began looking for a site for a baseball stadium to lure the team to Washington. After considering sites near RFK Stadium, in NoMA and straddling I-395 at Banneker Park the District announced on September 21, 2004 that they had chosen a site near the SE Anacostia waterfront.\n\nFinancing for the stadium was expected to be provided by a banking syndicate led by Deutsche Bank. However, finalization of the financing deal stalled due to complex negotiations among the city government, MLB as owner of the team, and the bank. The bank requested a letter of credit or comparable financial guarantee against stadium rent to cover risks such as poor attendance or terrorism. The requested guarantee was $24 million, with the city requesting that MLB provide the guarantee. The financing situation was since solved and construction began in May 2006.\n\nThe site of Nationals Park was chosen by Mayor Anthony Williams as the most viable of four possibilities for a ballpark. The ballpark's design was released to the public at a press conference on March 14, 2006. Ground breaking was in early 2006. With an ambitious construction schedule of fewer than two years to complete the stadium, a design-build approach was selected to allow the architects and builders to work in concert with one another. Ronnie Strompf, the project superintendent, coordinated the efforts of numerous subcontractors on a daily basis.\n\nThe 2008 Washington Nationals season was the team's first in Nationals Park. The George Washington University (GW) and the Nationals announced in February 2008 that the GW Colonials baseball team would play the first game in Nationals Park on March 22, 2008. GW played Saint Joseph's University in an afternoon game and the hometown Colonials had a 9–4 victory over Saint Joseph's.\n\nThe Washington Nationals defeated the Baltimore Orioles, 3–0, in an exhibition game on March 29, 2008, in their first game in the ballpark.\n\nThe Nationals opened the 2008 MLB season in Nationals Park with a rare one-game series against the Atlanta Braves on March 30, which served as the first official MLB game at the park. True to tradition, President George W. Bush threw out the ceremonial first pitch. The Nationals defeated the Braves 3–2 with a walk-off home run from Ryan Zimmerman, giving the Nationals their first opening day win since moving to Washington. Chipper Jones of the Braves hit the first batted ball and first home run, while the Nationals' Cristian Guzman got the first base hit. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Zimmerman's game-winning home run was the third walk-off home run in major-league history to be hit in the first MLB game played at a stadium. The game was the most-watched MLB opening night in the history of ESPN.\n\nIn their first season at Nationals Park, the Nationals finished with a league-worst record of 59-102. At home, they drew 29,005 fans per game, placing their average attendance at 19th in MLB.\nSeveral ballpark improvement projects were completed by the Nationals during the off-season, including:\n\n\nConcessionaire Levy Restaurants replaced Centerplate as the provider of food and beverage at Nationals Park beginning with the 2009 season.\n\nBefore the Nationals 2009 home opener on April 13, 2009 at 3 PM, longtime Philadelphia Phillies announcer Harry Kalas was found unconscious in the Nationals Park press box at 12:20 PM. Kalas was rushed to George Washington University Hospital and pronounced dead at 1:20 PM. A moment of silence was held before the game, followed by both Nationals and Phillies fans applauding Kalas in tribute. The Phillies played with a picture of Kalas in their dugout.\n\nOn June 4, 2009, Randy Johnson became the 24th pitcher in MLB history to reach 300 wins when the San Francisco Giants beat the Nationals 5–1 at Nationals Park. The game was scheduled to be played the night before, but was delayed due to heavy rain in the DC-area. On July 4, 2009, Adam Dunn became the 123rd player to hit 300 career home runs. The home run came in the 7th inning in a 5–3 win versus the Atlanta Braves.\n\nDuring the All-Star break, the press box was repainted blue to match the color of the seats. On June 8, 2010, pitcher Stephen Strasburg, called the \"most hyped and closely watched pitching prospect in the history of baseball\", made his first major league appearance, starting a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates before a sold-out crowd at Nationals Park. Strasburg pitched 7 innings, giving up two runs and striking out 14 batters, a new team strikeout record.\n\nMinor changes prior to the start of the 2011 season include the removal of the party tent on top of the LF parking garage to improve views of the U.S. Capitol from upper sections, chrome baseball decorations adorning the outside the stadium, and various signage and concession changes including the departure of Five Guys. Nationals Park also became home of the D.C. Sports Hall of Fame. In June 2011 four new concession stands opened, owned by Danny Meyer's Union Square Hospitality Group: Blue Smoke (barbecue), Box Frites (\"Belgian-style fries and dipping sauces\"), El Verano Taqueria (Mexican) and Shake Shack (hamburgers, hot dogs, frozen custard). The team has also ended Friday night firework shows and fireworks after home runs and team victories.\n\nOn May 4 for the series against Philadelphia, the Nationals renamed the park \"Natitude Park\". This was following their \"Take Back the Park\" plan, first selling advance tickets to fans in the Washington D.C. area before opening up ticket sales to other states. This marked a shift from recent years where Phillies fans had flooded the park, as the crowd was predominantly Nationals fans and the team took two of three from their division rivals. The Nationals made the playoffs for the first time since relocating to Washington in the 2012 season, with Games 3, 4, and 5 of the 2012 National League Division Series against the St. Louis Cardinals being played in Nationals Park. Washington lost the NLDS three games to two.\n\nTeam owner Theodore N. Lerner approached D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray and other city officials in mid-July 2013 and asked if the city would pay to have a retractable roof built over Nationals Park. After seeing sketches, Gray rejected the proposal at the same meeting. No cost analyses were done prior to the meeting, although team architects speculated it would cost $300 million. City officials noted that the stadium was not designed for a roof.\n\nThe Nationals made the playoffs for the second time since arriving in Washington, and Nationals Park hosted Games 1 and 2 of the 2014 National League Division Series. The Nationals lost the series to the San Francisco Giants three games to one.\n\nOn January 1, 2015, Nationals Park hosted the 2015 NHL Winter Classic before a crowd of 42,832 spectators. The Washington Capitals defeated the Chicago Blackhawks 3-2 after former Blackhawk Troy Brouwer scored the go-ahead goal with 13 seconds remaining in regulation play. This made the Capitals only the second home team to win a Winter Classic, and the first to win two Winter Classics, having won in Pittsburgh in 2011.\n\nOn July 17, 2015, during a regular-season game between the Nationals and the Los Angeles Dodgers, a series of three power outages affected a bank of lights along the park's third base line. The first power outage, which occurred in the bottom of the 4th inning, resulted in a delay of 1 hour and 22 minutes. Play was later resumed as the pitchers retired the next 5 batters. In the middle of the 5th inning, another power outage occurred, which resulted in a 40-minute delay. The bottom of the 5th inning was later played; at the end of the inning, a third power outage occurred. Due to the power outages, the game was suspended in the top of the 6th inning, with the Nationals leading the Dodgers 3–2 at that point. The game was resumed the next afternoon, with the Nationals winning against the Dodgers, 5–3.\n\nThe Nationals made the playoffs for the third time since arriving in Washington, and Nationals Park hosted Games 1, 2, and 5 of the 2016 National League Division Series. The Nationals lost the series to the Los Angeles Dodgers three games to two.\n\nPrior to the 2017 season, the Nationals added the MGM National Harbor Dugout Club, named for the nearby Maryland casino which opened in December 2016. These seats were added near the first base dugout, in the approximate location where the tarp was stored in previous seasons. The tarp has been moved to the third-base side.\n\nIn late September 2017, a new organ was installed at Nationals Park, fulfilling the Washington Nationals organization's long-held goal of upgrading the stadium's organ. The Viscount Sonus 60, priced at $20,000 on European Web sites, was manufactured in Mondaino, Italy, and tuned in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. It was installed in a former radio booth on the second floor of the stadium's press box, replacing a less-capable portable Hammond organ that had been located in a corner of the stadium's sound effects control room. The new location gave the organist a private room for the first time, as well as a better view of the field and crowd.\n\nThe Nationals made the playoffs for the fourth time since arriving in Washington, and Nationals Park hosted Games 1, 2, and 5 of the 2017 National League Division Series. The Nationals lost the series to the Chicago Cubs three games to two.\n\nNationals Park hosted the 2018 Major League Baseball All-Star Game on July 17. It was the fifth MLB All-Star Game to be played in Washington, D.C., and the first in Washington since 1969. The American League beat the National League 8–6 before 43,843 fans.\n\nNationals Park hosted games 3, 4 & 5, of the World Series, the first in the city since . The Nationals lost them all to the Houston Astros, but still won the series in seven games.\n\nAs of the 2017 season, the ballpark has 41,339 seats and features 79 suites on three levels, all around the infield. Team President Stan Kasten also said that the team might sell the naming rights to the levels of the luxury suites, which currently bear the names of presidents Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln. While the city agreed to spend up to $611 million, Kasten has stated that the principal owners, the Lerner family, spent tens of millions of dollars more on \"jazzing up the park\". The park has an out-of-town scoreboard, which is long, installed in the right field wall. The main scoreboard, at long and high, is more than five times the size of the one at RFK Stadium.\nOn March 13, 2007, Kasten announced that there would be a grove of cherry blossoms located just beyond the left field bleachers. Kasten stated that the cherry blossoms will provide a look that Americans associate with the nation's capital.\n\nOther distinctive features of the ballpark are the views of the U.S. Capitol from the upper deck. These views have been mostly blocked by new construction in recent years. Fans in the upper deck sitting down the right field line near the foul pole, during all day games, fans can get a glimpse of the Washington Monument and the National Cathedral. Several area-based food establishments have concession stands: Ben's Chili Bowl hot dogs, Dogfish Head and Flying Dog Brewery beer.\n\nAnother feature, The Budweiser Brew House, is a full service sit-down restaurant located in center field. It offers some amenities unusual in a ballpark such as salads, along with regular ballpark fare such as burgers and hot dogs. When the stadium first opened in 2008, the restaurant was enclosed by glass windows with a view of the field which were soon made retractable. The restaurant was eventually expanded to outside the interior, with tables being placed in three rows outside.\n\nIn 2010, the stadium added the Ring of Honor, celebrating players from the Washington Senators (Joe Cronin, Rick Ferrell, Goose Goslin, Clark Griffith, Bucky Harris, Walter Johnson, Harmon Killebrew, Heinie Manush, Sam Rice, and Early Wynn), Negro League Homestead Grays (Cool Papa Bell, Ray Brown, Josh Gibson, Buck Leonard, Cumberland Posey, and Jud Wilson), and the Nationals franchise's previous incarnation, the Montreal Expos (Gary Carter and Andre Dawson) who have been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\nSince 2011, a submarine dive horn has blared after every Nationals home run and win—a nod to the park's location in the Navy Yard neighborhood. And as with any World Series victory, as it did in , Queen's \"We Are The Champions\" is played over the PA.\n\nIn September 2018 Nationals Park began using a bullpen cart.\n\nIn September 2018 the ashes of John McNamara, a sportswriter who was killed in the Capital Gazette shooting, were spread in the flowers just over the left field fence.\n\nIn terms of batting park factor ESPN writer Tristan H. Cockcroft has said that \"Nationals Park has been remarkably consistent in its neutrality from a run-scoring perspective.\"\n\nSeating in Nationals Park is divided into over a dozen different pricing zones. There are four seating levels: the field level, mezzanine level, gallery level, and upper gallery level.\n\nThe Grandstand is composed of sections 401 and 402, in the corner of the upper deck in left field, in which seats are $5 for all games (except playoffs, which cost more). Tickets go on sale 2½ hours before the first pitch on the day of the game and cannot be ordered in advance.\n\nThe stadium features three levels of upscale luxury seating. The largest of the three, the Norfolk Southern Club, is a two-story indoor lounge exclusively for fans with tickets in sections 206–221. The lounge is and features various food entities, live television broadcasts of the game on dozens of TVs, and views of the Anacostia River. It was previously named the Stars and Stripes Club until the naming rights were purchased by Norfolk Southern Railway in 2014. The PNC Diamond Club, the naming rights of which were purchased by PNC Bank, is on the field level between the two dugouts. It was remodeled and expanded into two floors prior to the 2016 season. The Delta Sky360 Club seats are located right behind home plate and are the most expensive seats in the stadium and include access to an indoor lounge. It was previously named the Lexus Presidents Club until Delta Airlines purchased the naming rights in 2016.\n\nAs features were changed, added, or removed, seating capacity has changed repeatedly since the stadium opened; the number of seats has dropped slightly several times since it opened in 2008. In the inaugural 2008 season, seating capacity was 41,888; as of 2016, the seating capacity is 41,313.

It is the largest island in Iran.\n\nQeshm Island is located a few kilometers off the southern coast of Iran (Persian Gulf), opposite the port cities of Bandar Abbas and Bandar Khamir. The island, which hosts a free zone jurisdiction, is 135 km long, and lies strategically in the Strait of Hormuz, just from the Omani port of Khasab, and about from the UAE Port Rashid. The island, at its widest point, located near the center of the island, spans . Similarly, at it narrowest point, the island spans . The island has a surface area of and is 2.5 times the size of Bahrain. Qeshm, located at the easternmost point of the island, is from Bandar Abbas while the closest point of the island is but from the mainland.\n\nThe average temperature on the island is approximately . The warmest months are June through August, and the coldest from October to January. The average rainfall is .\n\nThe island comprises 59 towns and villages and the population was 117,774 at the 2011 Census. The local population is involved in fishing, dhow construction, trade and services. An additional 30,000 are administrative or industrial workers or students.\n\nPlans have also been made to build a bridge to connect Qeshm with the rest of Iran.\n\nQeshm Island has multiple attractions to attract more domestic and foreign tourists.\n\nThe earliest evidence of human presence at Qeshm dates back to the Paleolithic Period. Paleolithic stone tools have been found at Bam-e Qeshm. Historical records concerning the Qeshm island date far back into the pre-Islamic era. Names as Qeshm, Keshm, Kish and Tunb mark the lengthy stay of Ilamids in the area, several centuries BC. It is, apparently, the island called Alexandria or Aracia by Ptolemy (Book 6, Chap. IV), in the 2nd century CE and as Alexandria by Ammianus Marcellinus (xxiii.6.42) in the 4th century. On account of its strategic geopolitical situation near the mouth of the Persian Gulf, it has been frequently attacked by invaders including Ilamids (Elamites), Umayyads, and Abbasids as well as the Portuguese and the English. During Sassanian Empire administration the island was called Abarkawan, and was part of the Ardashir-Khwarrah administrative division. According to historical records, Qeshm Island has been famous as a trade and navigation center. Its economy flourished during the Dailamites and Buyid eras, as trade vessels sailed between Qeshm Island and China, India, and Africa.\n\nExplorer William Baffin was mortally wounded on Qeshm in 1622 during a battle against Portuguese forces who occupied the fort, known to the English as \"Forte de Queixome\".\n\nQeshm is also a supposed site of the Garden of Eden according to Cassell's Bible.\n\nFishing is a leading occupation practiced by the inhabitants of the island. On what little cultivated land there is, dates and melons are grown. Salt is mined on the southeastern coast. \nQeshm is famous for its wide range of ecotourist attractions such as the Hara marine forests. According to environmentalists, about 1.5% of the world birds and 25% of Iran's native birds annually migrate to the forests, which are the first national geo park in Iran. An ancient Portuguese fort, historic mosques, the Seyyed Mozaffar and Bibi Maryam shrines, and various ponds and mangrove forests are among the tourism attractions in the island, which lays across the azure waters of the Persian Gulf. Several domes, salty caves, the preserved area in Shibderaz Village where Hawksbill turtles hatch, as well as numerous docks and wharfs are among the tourist potentials of the island. The Nazz Islands are located at the south wing of Qeshm Island. Oysters, corals, colorful fishes and sea birds in these islands attract many tourists. It is possible to walk toward the island on soft and wet gravel through a gravel connection way between these islands and Qeshm at the time of the ebb.\n\nIn the 1st ten-year plan, in note 19, the law provided for the creation of free trade zones and three locations were identified as such in the year 1991. They were Kish Island, Qeshm Island and Chabahar. In the Iranian year 1369, equivalent to 1991 in the Gregorian calendar, the island was transformed into a \"Trade and Industrial Free Area\" with the goal of creating the largest Free Area between Europe and the Far East. To that end, Qeshm Island was granted considerable leeway to set its own policies, independent of the central government, which had often been seen as an impediment to growth in many sectors of the economy. However, the Island retains the advantages associated with its connection to the mainland, including the rights to explore and develop oil and gas opportunities.\n\nOn 3 July 1988, an Iran Air Airbus A300 (Iran Air Flight 655) was shot down by a United States Navy guided missile cruiser USS \"Vincennes\" just south of the island, resulting in 290 civilian fatalities. The wreckage crashed 2.5 kilometers off Qeshm's southern coast.\n\nOn 20 January 2012, OSGEOINT established the completion of an underground military facility at Qeshm island which accordingly could house Iran's Ghadir-Nahang class submarines.\n\n\nHolders of normal passports travelling as tourists can enter Qeshm without a visa with maximum stay of two weeks (extendable), as of December 2017.\n\nAdmission is refused to holders of passports or travel documents containing an Israeli visa or stamp or any data showing that visitor has been to Israel or indication of any connection with the state of Israel during the last 12 months.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2252172", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2252172", "title": "I Need You (Beatles song)", "text": "I Need You (Beatles song)\n\n\"I Need You\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1965 album \"Help!\" It was written by George Harrison, the group's lead guitarist, and was the second composition of his to be released by the Beatles. The track appears in their film \"Help!\", in a scene filmed on Salisbury Plain where the group were under military protection against a murderous cult.\n\nHarrison wrote \"I Need You\" about Pattie Boyd, the English model whom he married in January 1966. Recorded in February 1965 at the start of the sessions for \"Help!\", it features the Beatles' first use of a guitar volume pedal. Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers played the song in tribute to Harrison at the Concert for George in November 2002.\n\nGeorge Harrison presented \"I Need You\", along with \"You Like Me Too Much\", for consideration for the Beatles' second feature film, \"Help!\", in early 1965. Before this, he had struggled to complete a song since the band recorded his first composition, \"Don't Bother Me\", for their 1963 album \"With the Beatles\". In a September 1964 press conference, Harrison said he had written three \"bits\" of songs, but nothing \"whole\". George Martin, the band's producer, attributed his lack of productivity to the fact that \"none of us had liked something he had written\", and Harrison had felt disheartened. He subsequently resolved to ensure that his occasional vocal spots on the group's albums were his own compositions rather than Lennon–McCartney songs or cover versions. According to biographer Gary Tillery, Harrison's creativity was most likely inspired by his habitual marijuana use, a legacy of the Beatles' first meeting with Bob Dylan in August 1964.\n\nHarrison wrote \"I Need You\" about his girlfriend Pattie Boyd, whom he met in March 1964 while the Beatles were filming \"A Hard Day's Night\". Their relationship provided Harrison with a sense of calm amid the frenzy of Beatlemania; for Boyd, however, the jealousy of the band's fans was confronting. The song's lyrics address a time when she left Harrison.<ref name=\"O'Toole/SomethingElse!\"></ref> Shortly before recording the songs, Harrison routined \"I Need You\" and \"You Like Me Too Much\" with John Lennon at the latter's house in Weybridge. The pair worked together into the early hours of the day of Ringo Starr's wedding to Maureen Cox, which took place on 11 February 1965.\n\nAs recorded by the Beatles, the song is in the key of A major. Its distinctive lead guitar cadences were achieved by using a volume pedal and through common guitar suspended chords in the key of A. These form the introduction and most of the verse of the song and give a quasi-modal effect relieved in the verse by a line in the relative minor, the whole making a fourteen-bar ternary verse-structure. This, after a repeat, segues easily into a second bridge melody, which is based on a simple IV-V-I chord progression that passes through the dominant key to resolve back on the verse.<ref name=\"Pollack/Notes\"></ref>\n\nThe song has characteristics typical of Harrison's writing style in its syncopated melody line and melodic idiosyncrasy. According to author Ian Inglis, \"its rhythmic and tonal structures clearly identify this as a Harrison song, but it is also, indisputably, a Beatles song.\" Musicologist Dominic Pedler recognises an interesting feature in the use of an imperfect cadence (resolving on A major) in the climax of the bridge (on \"I just can't go on anymore\") which uses II (B7) and V (E7) chords. The verse-chorus also employs what Pedler terms a \"delaying tactic\" in alternating between vi and iii chords (over the lines \"Please come on back to me / I'm lonely as can be\") before again returning to A.\n\nThe lyrics serve as a rare example of Harrison embracing the standard boy–girl themes of love songs. According to musicologist Alan Pollack, they show Harrison \"at his absolutely most vulnerable\" and convey a \"bitter-sweetly mixed tone of plaintive, terminal desperation\". Harrison states his confusion at his girlfriend's decision to leave him, expresses his sadness without her, and begs her to reconsider. In Inglis's view, the singer's candour, combined with the upbeat tempo and other qualities in the Beatles' arrangement, ensures \"it is not a hopeless situation\", and the listener can be sure that the girl will return.\n\nThe Beatles recorded \"I Need You\" at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) in London on 15 and 16 February 1965. These were the group's first recording sessions of the year and also produced \"Ticket to Ride\" and \"Another Girl\". All three tracks were included in \"Help!\", filming for which began in the Bahamas on 23 February.\n\nThe song marked the Beatles' first use of a guitar volume pedal. This tone-altering effect was a precursor to the wah-wah pedal and had recently been played by session guitarist Big Jim Sullivan on Dave Berry's UK chart hits \"The Crying Game\" and \"One Heart Between Two\". Harrison's adoption of the pedal typified his search for new sounds for the Beatles, and for colouring that was empathetic with the group's material. He played the part on his Rickenbacker 12-string electric guitar and soon used the effect again on \"Yes It Is\", a similarly emotive Lennon composition. Musicologist Walter Everett recognises the volume pedal's presence on \"I Need You\" as the most important example within the band's work, with every chord given the \"flautando-like\" sound, and \"multiple articulations\" appearing throughout the song's coda. Citing a comment later made by Harrison, Everett says that \"I Need You\" was possibly one of the tracks where the pedal control was operated by Lennon, kneeling down on the studio floor, while Harrison played the guitar part.\n\nIn the 2006 book \"Recording the Beatles\", the authors highlight the song as an example of the \"warm, full sound\" that EMI's Telefunken M10 four-track recorder was able to capture. Journalist Kit O'Toole recognises the song's lead guitar effect and other folk rock qualities as having been influential on the Byrds, whose sound in turn would influence the Beatles.\n\nThe film sequence for \"I Need You\" was shot over 3–5 May and consists of the band miming to the track on Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire.<ref name=\"Barker/BBC\"></ref> Since the start of filming for \"Help!\", events had taken place that distanced the Beatles, particularly Harrison and Lennon, from the public image they were expected to uphold in the feature film, and were exerting a profound influence on the band's thinking. Among these incidents, Harrison was introduced to Indian philosophy in the Bahamas when a local swami gave each of the Beatles a copy of \"The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga\"; he and Lennon, together with Boyd and Lennon's wife Cynthia, had their first experience with the hallucinogenic drug LSD, in late March; and Harrison encountered an Indian sitar for the first time while filming a restaurant scene in London in April. In Tillery's description, 1965 was the most \"pivotal\" year in Harrison's life, as LSD opened the door to his enduring quest for spiritual enlightenment and Eastern philosophy provided a means to escape the demands of Beatlemania.\nThe \"I Need You\" sequence depicts an outdoor recording session, with a makeshift control booth and microphones set up in an open field. Further to the film's premise that Starr was being targeted for assassination by a mysterious cult, the Beatles perform under the protection of the British 3rd Royal Tank Regiment, surrounded by soldiers and Centurion tanks. Although it was spring, the weather was unusually cold, and the sequence shows Starr shivering behind his drum kit.\n\nThe premise and the level of security afforded the band mirrored the adulation they received in real life, at the height of Beatlemania. Media theorist Stephanie Fremaux comments on the imagery employed by director Richard Lester in his harsh editing and shots of soldiers and weaponry to convey a sense of threat, and how this is furthered by the Beatles', and particularly Harrison's, apparent hostility and avoidance of eye contact with the camera. Film historian Stephen Glynn highlights a shot that features Harrison in profile, singing into a metallic microphone, and the corresponding gun barrel of a tank as an example of Lester making \"visual parallels between the tools of the musician and the military\". Another example, according to Glynn, is an aerial shot of the band encircled by six tanks that cuts to a close-up of the fretboard of Harrison's guitar, with the focus soon changing to reveal Stonehenge in the near distance. \n\"Help!\" was released by EMI's Parlophone label on 6 August 1965, with \"I Need You\" sequenced as the fourth track between \"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away\" and \"Another Girl\". Martin said the song \"worked out very well\" and considered it an important step for Harrison. He added: \"He has got something to say as a songwriter, and I hope he keeps it up.\" Other than \"I Need You\", all the songs in the film were Lennon–McCartney compositions. As the end credits stated this on screen, a voiceover from Harrison repeatedly said, \"'I Need You' by George Harrison!\", increasing in volume each time.\n\nThe album and film enjoyed major commercial success around the world. In music journalist Jon Savage's description, the summer of 1965 \"belonged\" to the Beatles' \"Help!\" \"multimedia campaign\", which comprised the \"Help!\" hit single as well as the film and soundtrack album. In Willy Russell's 1974 play based on the Beatles' history, \"John, Paul, George, Ringo ... and Bert\", \"I Need You\" was sung by Brian Epstein's character in response to the group's decision to retire from touring in 1966. The Beatles' recording of the track appeared on the 1977 compilation album \"Love Songs\", issued by EMI to exploit the band's catalogue seven years after their break-up.\n\nAmong Beatles biographers, Jonathan Gould describes \"I Need You\" as a \"modest, mild love song\" that sounded \"a lot like the efforts of other contemporary songwriters to write in the style of Lennon and McCartney\". In Mark Hertsgaard's view, the track is \"a catchy pop tune\" that showed how Harrison \"had now matured into the kind of pleasantly stylized, if innocuous, songwriter that Lennon and McCartney had been in their early days\". According to Alan Clayson, \"for all its simplistic libretto and suspensions \"à la\" 'One Heart Between Two'\", the song was \"more immediately attractive\" than some of the Lennon–McCartney songs on \"Help!\"\n\nWriting in the 2004 edition of \"The Rolling Stone Album Guide\", Rob Sheffield described \"I Need You\" and \"You Like Me Too Much\" as \"the finest George songs known to man\". He viewed \"Help!\" as the band's \"big step forward\" in its exploration of themes such as \"doubt, loneliness, alienation, adult sexual longing\" and said that for Harrison's persona relative to Lennon and McCartney, \"the Quiet One got Smart as well as Cute\". By contrast, \"PopMatters\" editor John Bergstrom featured the song in his 2009 list titled \"the worst of the Beatles\". He said that \"I Need You\" justified statements subsequently made by Lennon, McCartney and Martin that until late in the Beatles' career, Harrison's songwriting presence was limited in accordance with his talent and experience, and he dismissed Harrison's vocal on the track as \"flat and tentative, even as the lovelorn lyrics are sincere\" and his use of the guitar volume pedal as rudimentary.\n\nReviewing the remastered \"Help!\" that same year, for \"Paste\" magazine, Mark Kemp said that \"Harrison surfaces here as a formidable songwriter, taking center stage on 'I Need You' and 'You Like Me Too Much'.\" According to Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic, while the two Harrison compositions pale beside Lennon and McCartney's songs on the album, \"they hold their own against much of their British pop peers.\"\n\nGeorge Martin included \"I Need You\" on his 1965 album of instrumental versions of Beatles songs, also titled \"Help!\" The Sunshine Company recorded a version, arranged by George Tipton, for their 1967 Imperial Records LP \"Happy Is the Sunshine Company\".\n\nTom Petty and the Heartbreakers performed \"I Need You\" in tribute to Harrison at the Concert for George in November 2002. Its inclusion provided a rare departure from the concert's program of the best-known songs from Harrison's career as a Beatle and a solo artist. Petty and his band played the song in a style that Ian Inglis recognises as typical of the Byrds, whose initial sound was inspired by the Beatles, particularly Harrison's use of 12-string Rickenbacker guitar. Inglis describes Petty's interpretation as \"an uncannily accurate reconstruction\" of the Byrds' mid-1960s style, with a \"clipped vocal delivery\" reminiscent of Roger McGuinn, harmony singing, \"chiming\" guitars, and a slower tempo than on the Beatles' recording.\n\nFormer Journey vocalist Steve Perry covered \"I Need You\" on his 2018 album \"Traces\". Perry said that the Beatles had recorded a bossa nova-like version but had not done justice to the song, which deserved to be \"a bigger sort of R&B pocket thing\". He recalled that he sought approval from Olivia Harrison, Harrison's widow, before releasing his interpretation and was relieved when she told him, \"George would have \"loved\" this version.\"\n\nGeorge Martin kept notes during the session that documented the unusual arrangement, which was:\n\n\n"}

The song was written by Paul McCartney and credited to the Lennon–McCartney partnership. The song is addressed to the singer's girlfriend, who is informed that the singer has found \"another girl.\"\n\nMcCartney wrote the song while holidaying in Hammamet, a resort in Tunisia. With an up-tempo swing-beat that McCartney favoured (\"Can't Buy Me Love\", \"She's a Woman\") it opens with a short refrain, powered by block vocal harmonies, that segues straight into the verse, which is constructed on the blues-mode chord changes the group currently favoured. The bridge theme makes a sudden key change up a minor third from A to C (a harmonic strategy also used on the record's next track \"You're Going to Lose That Girl\") and features more close three-part harmonies as the aggressively sung verse's apparent threat to a jealous girl turns into a sweet tribute to the \"other\" girl who \"will always be my friend\".\n\nThe Beatles recorded the song on 15 February 1965, having also worked that day on \"Ticket to Ride\" and \"I Need You\". The backing track was quickly recorded in a single take. George Harrison added a guitar \"flourish\" at the end which was omitted from the final mix: McCartney added lead guitar the next day. This is one of several Beatles songs recorded at the time on which McCartney played lead guitar in addition to his usual bass. Four-track recording allowed the group to refine songs' arrangements in the studio and McCartney often had clear ideas about the guitar lines he wanted. He also contributed lead guitar to \"Ticket to Ride\" and played an electric guitar duet with Harrison on \"The Night Before\". The song was mixed down on 18 February and again on 23 February.\n\nThis song features the often-utilized three-part harmonies between Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, but it is one of the only instances in which Lennon sings the highest harmony.\n\nMcCartney said of this song and other album tracks, \"It's a bit much to call them fillers because I think they were a bit more than that, and each one of them made it past the Beatles test. We all had to like it.\"\n\nThe song was performed live for the first time by a Beatle when Paul McCartney returned to the Nippon Budokan, Tokyo, on 28 April 2015; this was 49 years after the Beatles had first played at the venue, in June and July 1966. In a released statement, McCartney said, \"It was sensational and quite emotional remembering the first time and then experiencing this fantastic audience tonight.\"\n\nIn the film \"Help!\", McCartney lip-syncs \"Another Girl\" while standing on a coral reef on Balmoral Island in the Bahamas, and plays a girl in a bikini as if she is a guitar. Since McCartney's hands are occupied (with either bass or girl), George Harrison mimes McCartney's guitar fills as if playing them himself. The four of them each change instruments. For instance, Harrison is seen playing McCartney's bass and looks confused. Starr is shown playing acoustic guitar and Lennon mimes playing drums. Another scene was filmed at the Cloisters, a famous Bahamian landmark.\n\nThe George Martin Orchestra covers the track on \"Help!\", their instrumental reworking of the Beatles' album.\n\n\n\n"}

It has a population of 38,506 (2001 Census). There are significant natural features in this district including rivers, forests, mountains and bogs (known locally as \"mosses\").\n\nTransport links with Aberdeen have encouraged rapid population growth, especially in the north of this region. Existing settlements such as Portlethen and Stonehaven have greatly expanded, along with industrial activity. The southern part is more self-sufficient, with the fertile Mearns area sustaining a strong agricultural economy. Small scale tourism activity occurs along its attractive coastline and former fishing villages.\n\nBetween 1975 and 1996 Kincardine and Deeside was a local government district within the Grampian region. Its area included all of the county of Kincardineshire apart from a small area in the northeast which was covered by the City of Aberdeen. As the name suggested, it also included the large geographical area of the watershed of the River Dee from the southern section of Aberdeenshire. In 1996, this district became part of Aberdeenshire unitary authority in the local government reorganisation.\n\nIn medieval times, the northern part of the area known as Kincardine comprised the Thanedom of Cowie and the Thanedom of Durris. The Mearns was described as an earldom. Each of these thanages was with the Crown as late as 1264 AD. In the Middle Ages the principal roadway connecting Stonehaven to Aberdeen was known as the Causey Mounth; this drovers' road was constructed in some places with large boulders in order to span certain boggy stretches.\n\nDuring the Scottish Enlightenment period, Lord Monboddo operated a large agricultural estate in the Mearns, at which location he conducted considerable research in agricultural improvement; Monboddo was best known as a jurist on the Court of Session, as the father of modern historical linguistics and a pre-evolutionary thinker.\n\n\nRivers and streams in Kincardine and Mearns include the Burn of Elsick, Burn of Pheppie, Burn of Muchalls, Cowie Water, Carron Water and Bervie Water, all of which discharge to the North Sea.

He was a founding member of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), a former Stormont MP, and a member of the 1974 Power Sharing Executive.\n\nDescribed as a \"relentless campaigner against sectarianism\", Devlin had once been a member of the IRA but later renounced physical force republicanism to work at transcending sectarian differences through democratic, socialist and nationalist political means.\n\nDuring the late 1960s he entered local politics in the Belfast City Council and went on to help found the SDLP in 1970 with John Hume, Gerry Fitt, Austin Currie and others.\n\nDevlin was born in the Pound Loney in the Lower Falls in West Belfast on 8 March 1925 and lived in the city for almost all his life. His mother was a leading activist in Joe Devlin's (no relation) Nationalist Party machine in the Falls area and Devlin grew up in a highly political household. However his early activism was confined to Fianna Éireann and then the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and as a result he was interned in Crumlin Road Gaol during the Second World War. On his release he left the republican movement.\n\nAfter the war, and in search of work, he spent some time in Portsmouth working as a scaffolder and in Coventry working in the car industry. In Coventry he became interested in Labour and trade union politics and briefly joined the British Labour Party.\n\nReturning to Belfast in 1948 he helped establish the Irish Labour Party there after the Northern Ireland Labour Party (NILP) split on the issue of partition and later he beat Gerry Fitt to win a seat on the city council. Later Catholic Action claimed the Irish Labour Party was infested with communists and ensured the party were effectively wiped out and Devlin lost his seat.\n\nIn the mid 1960s Devlin joined the revived NILP and beat Harry Diamond for the Falls seat in Stormont. Devlin then went on, with Fitt, John Hume, Austin Currie and others to found the SDLP in 1970. He was later involved, at the request of William Whitelaw, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, in ensuring safe passage for Gerry Adams for talks with the British government in 1973. He was a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly, 1973 and Minister of Health and Social Services in the power-sharing Executive from 1 January 1974 to 28 May 1974.\n\nIn 1978 he established the United Labour Party, which aimed to be a broad based Labour formation in Northern Ireland. He stood under its label for the European Parliament in 1979 but polled just 6,122 first preferences (1.1% of those cast) and thereby lost his deposit.\n\nIn 1987 he, together with remnants of the NILP and others, established Labour '87 as another attempt at building a Labour Party in Northern Ireland by uniting the disparate groups supporting labour and socialist policies but it too met with little or no success. In 1985 he lost his place on Belfast City council.\n\nDevlin suffered from severe diabetes and throughout the 1990s suffered a series of ailments as his health and sight collapsed.\n\nJohn Hume and others supposedly saw Devlin as too forgiving of police, but not the British Army, as Devlin supported a motion tabled at the SDLP's annual conference in 1976 for British withdrawal. The motion, also supported by Ivan Cooper, Seamus Mallon, and Paddy Duffy, but opposed by Party leader Gerry Fitt, John Hume and Austin Currie, was defeated by 153 votes to 111. Devlin also spoke out against the assassination of Irish National Liberation Army chief Ronnie Bunting in 1980, commonly attributed to an Ulster Defence Association hit squad, but which Devlin always believed was carried out by an 'SAS type' unit with British Security force involvement.\n\nDevlin saw the SDLP as a body to unite Catholic and Protestant workers and so transcend the traditional sectarian divisions of Northern Ireland through socialist politics. Others saw him as overly aggressive and forceful. In his autobiography \"Straight Left\" he accused Hume of seeking to make the SDLP just another nationalist party and not regretting his expulsion (following a public attack on the party's direction) from the SDLP in 1977 called the dispute that led him to leave \"a most unworthy squabble\" and concedes \"I was not the innocent party\". \"No one's talking to (Protestants) about the price of a loaf of bread or how much it takes to pay the rent,\" he said in a 1995 interview. \"No one has had any regard for the majority of people here, the Protestants. ... We've scarcely recognized them.\"\n\nOutside of party politics, Devlin spent his later years as Area Secretary of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union.

His philosophical standpoint was one of Academic skepticism: he did not agree with dogmatism, but didn't resort to Pyrrhonism, either.\n\nHe was born in Dijon, the son of a merchant, and appears to have taken holy orders at a very early age. For some years he held the position of honorary canon at Dijon, but he resigned in order to take up his residence in Paris. He graduated at the Sorbonne, having studied theology, and spent the remainder of his life in literary work in Paris, where he died.\n\nIn his day Foucher enjoyed considerable reputation as a keen opponent of Malebranche and Leibniz. He revived the old arguments of the Academy, and advanced them with much ingenuity against Malebranche's doctrine. Otherwise his skepticism is subordinate to orthodox belief, the fundamental dogmas of the church seeming to him intuitively evident. His object was to reconcile his religious with his philosophical creed, and to remain a Christian without ceasing to be an academician.\n\nIn his 1673 publication, \"Dissertation on the Search for Truth\", he brought to light people's psychological predilection for certainties. He wrote about the art of doubting—about positioning oneself between doubting and believing. He wrote, \"\"One needs to exit doubt in order to produce science—but few people heed the importance of not exiting from it prematurely...It is a fact that one usually exits doubt without realizing it.\"\" He wrote further, \"\"We are dogma-prone from our mother's wombs.\"\"\n\nFoucher had the annoying habit of re-using the same titles for his works, making it necessary to cite the whole subtitle in order to specify which work is being referred to.\n\n\nIn addition to these works, Foucher published two long poems, and a few shorter philosophical pieces. He also conducted an important correspondence with Leibniz and wrote, but never published, a play.\n"}

Bejel is one of the \"endemic trepanematoses\" (endemic infections caused by spiral-shaped bacteria called treponemes), a group that also includes yaws and pinta. Typically, endemic trepanematoses begin with localized lesions on the skin or mucous membranes. Pinta is limited to affecting the skin, whereas bejel and yaws are considered to be invasive because they can also cause disease in bone and other internal tissues.\n\nBejel usually begins in childhood as a small patch on the mucosa, often on the interior of the mouth, followed by the appearance of raised, eroding lesions on the limbs and trunk. Periostitis (inflammation) of the leg bones is commonly seen, and gummas of the nose and soft palate develop in later stages.\n\nAlthough the organism that causes bejel, \"Treponema pallidum endemicum\", is morphologically and serologically indistinguishable from \"Treponema pallidum pallidum\", which causes venereal syphilis, transmission of bejel is not venereal in nature, generally resulting from mouth-to-mouth contact or sharing of domestic utensils, and the courses of the two diseases are somewhat different.\nThe diagnosis of bejel is based on the geographic history of the patient as well as laboratory testing of material from the lesions (dark-field microscopy). The responsible spirochaete is readily identifiable on sight in a microscope as a treponema.\n\nIt is treatable with penicillin or other antibiotics, resulting in a complete recovery.\n\nBejel is mainly found in arid countries of the eastern Mediterranean region and in West Africa, where it is known as \"sahel\".

It is built along the river Serio at from Cremona. It is also the seat of the Catholic Bishop of Crema, who gave the title of city to Crema.\n\nCrema's main economic activities traditionally (since the 11th century) related to agriculture, cattle breeding and making wool, but its manufactures in later centuries include cheese, iron products and cotton and wool textiles.\n\nCrema hosts the Computer Science Department of the University of Milan. Crema also hosted Timothée Chalamet and Armie Hammer in the movie Call Me By Your Name.\n\nCrema's origins have been linked to the Lombard invasion of the 6th century CE, the name allegedly deriving from the Lombard term \"Krem\" meaning \"little hill\", though this is doubtful since it does not lie significantly above the surrounding countryside. Other linguistic roots may suggest an older origin, in particular the Indo-European root meaning a boundary (cf. Ukraine, crêt). Other authorities trace its foundation back to the 4th century CE, when Milan was capital of the Western Roman Empire. According to another version, it was instead an even more ancient Celtic or Etruscan settlement.\n\nCrema first appears in historical documents in the 11th century as a possession of the counts of Camisano. It was then ruled by Boniface, margrave of Tuscany, and his daughter Matilde. In 1098, Matilde gave the town as a gift to the Bishop of Cremona. During this period the prosperity of Crema's territory began as agriculture was boosted and the Humiliates' Order introduced the processing of wool, which was to be the area's main economic activity until the 19th century.\n\nIn 1159, after it had signed an alliance with Milan against the Ghibelline Cremona, Crema was besieged, stormed and destroyed by the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. The siege of Crema was marked by several episodes of brutality. The Germans hung some Cremaschi prisoners to their siege machines hoping the defenders would not fire against their fellows. However, this expedient did not work, and turned the battle into a slaughter.\n\nAfter the Peace of Constance (1183) the city was allowed to be rebuilt as a \"castrum\" (\"castle\"). Henry VI gave it back to his allied Cremonese. A period as a free Commune followed, during which, however, the tendency to partisan struggles, typical of the northern Italian communes of that age, soon showed. In any case, the city was reinforced with new walls, ditches and gates (1199), and a network of canals further improved agriculture. In the 13th century Crema was also enriched with its famous cathedral and the Palazzo Pretorio.\n\nThe communal independence ended in 1335, when the city surrendered to Gian Galeazzo Visconti, whose family held the city until the end of the century. In 1361 Crema was touched by the Black Death. A brief period of rule by the Guelph Benzoni family followed (Bartolomeo and Paolo from 1403 to 1405, then their nephew Giorgio until 1423). The seignory passed again to the Visconti, and, from 1449 onwards, to the Republic of Venice.\n\nAs a Venetian inland province, Crema obtained numerous privileges and was safe from the economic decline of the nearby Duchy of Milan under the Spanish rule. It kept a substantial autonomy, which allowed a program of new buildings. These included a new line of walls, the rebuilding of the Palazzo Comunale (1525–1533), the Palazzo della Notaria, now Palazzo Vescovile.\n\nThe 17th century saw the beginning of the decadence of the city, caused by the decline of its industrial activities, although agriculture continued to flourish. In 1796 an Academy of Agriculture was founded. After the fall of the Republic of Venice in 1797, Crema became part of the new French client Cisalpine republic (and later the Napoleonic Italian Republic and Kingdom of Italy). The French army deposed the last podestà and created a municipality. At first Crema formed part of the province of Crema-Lodi, but was later annexed to the department of centred on Cremona. After the Napoleonic wars the Congress of Vienna awarded Crema to Austria as part of the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia. Within Lombardy–Venetia it became part of the within the sub-Kingdom of Lombardy.\n\nBy the 1859 Treaty of Zurich which ended the Austro-Sardinian War, Austria ceded Lombardy, including Crema, to France, who then immediately ceded it to Sardinia. This formed part of the \"Risorgimento\", which saw Sardinia become the Kingdom of Italy in 1861. In 1946, the Kingdom became the modern Italian Republic.\n\nCrema's historical sights include:\n\n\nTourist information can be retrieved at http://www.turismocrema.com/.\n\nThe tortelli cremaschi (dialect of Crema : turtèi cremasch) represents the main dish of the local culinary tradition. This is a kind of tortelli that doesn't exist elsewhere in Italy as the filling is sweet. More info is available on the dedicated page: Tortelli cremaschi .\n\n\nCrema is served by a railway station on the Treviglio–Cremona railway, with regional trains.\n\nThere were three national roads connecting the city: SS 415 to Milan and Cremona; SS 591 to Piacenza and Bergamo; and SS 235 to Brescia and Pavia. The nearest motorway exits are the one of Lodi-Pieve Fissiraga, on the Autostrada A1 and the one of Romano di Lombardia on the Autostrada A35 - BreBeMi, opened in July 2014.\n\nThe film \"Call Me by Your Name\" (2017) was shot primarily in Crema. Several historical locations in the surrounding streets in Crema and Pandino were chosen during production, including the Crema Cathedral.\n\nSince local government political reorganization in 1993, Crema has been governed by the City Council of Crema. Voters elect directly the councilors and the Mayor of Crema every five years.\n\nThe current Mayor of Crema is Stefania Bonaldi (PD), elected on 21 May 2012 and re-elected for a second term on 26 June 2017. She has been the first female to fill the office.\n\nThis is a list of the mayors of Crema since 1993:\n\n<br>\n"}

It resembles the closely related sun parakeet.\n\nFirst described in 1776, \"A. maculata\" had long been dismissed as invalid. It was rediscovered as part of a study of specimens of the sun parakeet and related species. Specimens of the sulphur-breasted parakeet had previously been dismissed as immature sun parakeets or hybrids. Believing it represented an entirely undescribed species, it was described as \"A. pintoi\" (in honour of the Brazilian ornithologist Olivério Pinto) in 2005. Only in 2009 was it shown that \"A. maculata\" and the \"new\" \"A. pintoi\" were the same.\n\nSome believe the sulphur-breasted parakeet is better regarded as a subspecies of the sun parakeet.\n\nFollowing the realisation that the sulphur-breasted parakeet was a valid species, the first records of living birds were from east of Óbidos on the northern bank of the lower Amazon River in Pará, Brazil. Since then, it has been reported more widely at low densities in the Pará state north of the Amazon River, but still no records have been reported from neighbouring parts of Amapá, where it probably also occurs. Additionally, three specimens kept at the National Museum of Natural History in the Netherlands have been identified as this species. They were taken from the Sipaliwini savanna in southern Suriname. Recent sightings from the same region have also been identified as sulphur-breasted parakeets. This suggests that it possibly comes into contact with the closely related and very similar sun parakeet. Unlike adult sun parakeets, sulphur-breasted parakeets have clear green suffusion to the mantle, wing-coverts and underparts, but this is shared with juvenile sun parakeets. Adults of both species have a dark greyish eye ring in the wild, but this commonly fades to whitish in captives, at least in the sun parakeet (this is the source of the mistaken idea that the colour of the eye ring separates the two).\n\n"}
{"id": "2252253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2252253", "title": "Andrew Forman", "text": "Andrew Forman\n\nAndrew Forman (11 March 1521) was a Scottish diplomat and prelate who became Bishop of Moray in 1501, Archbishop of Bourges in France, in 1513, Archbishop of St Andrews in 1514 as well as being Commendator of several monasteries.\n\nHe was probably the son of Nicholas Forman of Hutton in Berwickshire, and Jonet Blackadder. Forman had three brothers, John and Adam who were both knights — Adam was the standard-bearer to King James IV at the Battle of Flodden and John was the king's serjeant-porter who was captured at the battle — and Robert who was dean of Glasgow cathedral. He also had two known sisters—Isabel, the second wife of Sir Patrick Home of Fast Castle and an unnamed sister whose son, John Roul, became commendator of May after Forman's death. A possible third sister, Jonet Forman the Prioress of Eklis (Eccles), is the first named in a letter of protection and respite (similar to a will) dated 28 March 1513, when Forman lists a number of his kith and kin. He was educated at the University of St Andrews graduating as a Licentiate of the Arts in 1483.\n\nBy 1489, he had entered the service of King James IV. King James's foreign policy was directed at bringing peace to Europe, and although Forman obtained many high offices in the church, his primary role was as a senior emissary in the service of the king; a role that saw him receive generous royal and papal gifts and required Forman to spend extended periods in Rome, Paris and London.\n\nHe represented the king in Rome in 1489/90 where he was appointed protonotary apostolic by Pope Innocent VIII. The first benefice he received was in 1489 when Pope Innocent VIII provided him to the Parsonage of Forest church (Yarrow in the Scottish borders). Then in 1492, he used his influence at Rome to obtain the guarantee of the provision to the abbacy of Culross but resigned his rights in 1493 in return for a substantial pension from the monastery's income. The possession of multiple religious appointments was common in late medieval Scotland when ecclesiastical and later, temporal lords, would be gifted commendatorships of monasteries at the discretion of the monarch—it was unlikely that the monasteries in question would have been visited by their commendators very often, if at all. He became prior of May (Pittenweem) in 1495—an office which he retained up until his death—and by 30 September 1497, he was protonotary apostolic. The king received Perkin Warbeck, the bogus Duke of York, in Stirling Castle in November 1495 and designated Forman to attend him. Warbeck's presence in Scotland may have been used by King James and some of his councillors as an excuse to wage war with England. Apart from a raid into Northumberland, war did not ensue and in July 1497, Forman watched over Warbeck's departure from the port of Ayr.\n\nForman and Bishop William Elphinstone of Aberdeen were the principal envoys who brokered a seven-year truce with King Henry VII of England at Aytoun in September 1497. They were assisted by the Spanish ambassador Pedro de Ayala, who recommended in May 1498 that diplomatic correspondence to Scotland should be copied to Forman, his influential friend. The search for a queen for James began in 1499 when negotiators were appointed to treat with King Henry for the marriage of his eldest daughter, Princess Margaret. Dispensation from the pope for the marriage was received as both James and Margaret were cousins, descended from John Beaufort, Marquess of Dorset. On 8 October 1501, Forman, now postulate to the see of Moray, was commissioned along with Robert Blackadder, Archbishop of Glasgow and Patrick Hepburn, 1st Earl of Bothwell to conclude the treaty of marriage. In that same year, King Henry, in gratitude for his services required that Thomas Savage, Archbishop of York institute Forman as Rector of the parish church of Cottingham. On 26 November 1501, Pope Alexander VI provided Forman to the bishopric of Moray and then only a few months later in 1502, Bishop Forman concluded the Treaty of Perpetual Peace with England at Richmond Palace. The formal proceedings that finally concluded the marriage terms of King James and Margaret Tudor were conducted in Glasgow Cathedral on 10 December 1502 where Forman was a signatory. He was then appointed as a commissioner to oversee the exchange of the ratified marriage treaties at the courts of Henry and James. James designated Forman to conduct Margaret to Scotland but while in England, gave King Henry an undertaking that the King of Scots would not renew the league with France unless Henry was first consulted. The procession to Scotland took them to Fast Castle near Berwick where they stayed with Forman's sister Isabel and her husband Alexander Oliphant of Kellie. In 1509, Forman became commendator of Dryburgh Abbey and tried unsuccessfully to obtain the commendatorship of the wealthy abbey of Kelso in 1511. The lands and possessions of the parson of Boleskin, south of Inverness were given to Forman (as bishop of Moray) in 1511 and then in 1512 he became the Keeper of the castle of Darnaway, near Forres, Chamberlain of Moray and Custumar north of the River Spey.\nBenefices\n\nLands\n\n\nJames's father-in-law, Henry VII of England died in 1509 and his son Henry VIII came to the throne. Forman traveled to the English court on several occasions to facilitate the renewal of the Treaty of Perpetual Peace which was agreed on 29 June 1509 and ratified by Forman on King James' behalf on 29 August. In 1510, the king sent Forman to France to try to persuade King Louis XII to make peace with Pope Julius II and then in 1511 to Venice to try to construct a peace between Louis and the Venetians.\n\nAlso in 1511, Forman carried a letter to Henry in which James complained bitterly that the criminals who had murdered Sir Robert Ker, Warden of the Middle Marches in the time of his father, Henry VII, were still at large. James stated that he could not accept that his subjects were being killed and those responsible not being brought to justice. The Scottish king's letter to the pope in December 1511 showed that James regarded that the treaty between Scotland and England was worthless and that he assumed that the pope had released both kings from their oaths to uphold the treaty. James was now in the complex situation where he still had the existing treaty with England and with an alliance with France on the table but each contradictory to the other. He did not rush to France's side but continued to send Forman on his shuttle diplomacy missions to try to conciliate the opposing demands of Pope Julius II and King Louis XII. Eventually, after Forman's failure to bring the pontiff and the French king together, James after consultation with his General Council renewed the Franco-Scottish alliance in July 1512—only two councillors opposed the decision.\n\nOn 21 February 1513, Pope Julius, with England now in the league against France, issued a bull which was in effect a suspended sentence of excommunication on James if he broke the treaty with Henry. James then sent Andrew Forman once more to Rome on 31 March to try to get the new Pope Leo X to countermand the bull but without success. Forman did have personal success in July, however, when at the insistence of King Louis, he was made Archbishop of Bourges and paid homage to the French king on 12 September, just 3 days after the Battle of Flodden. It is unlikely that either Louis or Forman would have known of the death of James.\n\nOn 9 September 1513, the Battle of Flodden was fought near the village of Branxton in Northumberland. Had Forman been in Scotland, then it is almost certain that he would have accompanied the King into England. Many churchmen died that afternoon, among them were the King's natural son, Alexander Stewart, archbishop of St Andrews, George Hepburn, bishop of the Isles, Lawrence Oliphant, abbot of Inchaffray and William Bunch, abbot of Kilwinning. Nine of the twenty-one Scottish earls were also killed along with fourteen of the twenty-nine lords of parliament. Thomas Ruthall, Bishop of Durham, wrote to Cardinal Wolsey on 20 September saying that King James fell near his banner and then lauded the bravery of the Scottish host:\n\n... such large and strong men, they would not fall when four or five bills struck one of them. ... [the English] did not trouble themselves with prisoners, but slew and stripped King, bishops, lords and nobles, and left them naked on the field. ...\n\nIn all, between 5,000 and 8,000 Scots were killed while approximately 1,500 of the English host died—among the few prisoners taken was Andrew Forman's brother, Sir John Forman who was the King's serjeant-porter.\n\nThe seventeen-month-old King James V was crowned in Stirling almost immediately and his mother, Queen Margaret created regent as required by the provisions of the late king's will. She had little freedom of action as a ruling council, consisting of James Beaton, archbishop of Glasgow and chancellor, Alexander Gordon, 3rd Earl of Huntly, Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus, and James Hamilton, 1st Earl of Arran, was appointed to rule the country. When Queen Margaret married the Earl of Angus, the lords of the council decided that she had to give up the regency of her infant son King James V and in September, they invited John Stewart, Duke of Albany to become governor of Scotland. The arrival of Albany from France, the opposing Douglas and Hamilton factions within the council and the meddling of the pope all impinged on the outcome of the vacant archbishopric of St Andrews.\n\nBoth King Henry VIII and Pope Leo X tried to take advantage of the vacuum created by the loss of so many of the Scottish ruling class. Henry, on 12 October 1513, asked the pope to repudiate the privilege held by the Scottish kings to nominate the successor to vacant ecclesiastical positions; he also asked that the see of St. Andrews should have its metropolitan honours removed and that the unoccupied Scottish bishoprics caused by the battle of Flodden should remain unfilled until he was consulted. Pope Leo also moved quickly to take advantage and appointed his nephew Cardinal Innocenzo Cibo to St Andrews on 13 October. He instructed his ambassador John Battista to take control of the see of St Andrews on Cibos behalf but the governing council of Scotland prevented his entry to the country. The papal datary claimed the priory of Whithorn while Cardinal St Eusebius tried to appropriate Arbroath Abbey prompting the infant King James V via his council to write to Cardinal St Mark stating that he \"will not submit to a violation of his privileges.\" Pope Leo replied in November confirming the right of the Scottish king to make recommendations for religious appointments. Even so, Forman was still influential in Paris and Rome and with the help of the French king and Albany, he obtained provision to the see of St Andrews on 13 November—Leo and Albany agreed that Forman would resign Bourges in Cibo's favour. However, this didn't automatically guarantee his succession to the cathedra. On the death of Alexander, archbishop of St Andrews, John Hepburn, Prior of St Andrews and dean of St Andrews immediately assumed the vicar-generalship collecting the revenues of the cathedral and then had the chapter elect him to the archbishopric.\n\nDespite this, King James via his general council, nominated Aberdeen's aged Bishop Elphinstone to the position. Gavin Douglas, provost of the collegiate church of St Giles in Edinburgh was recommended to the pope by both Margaret, the queen-mother and the English King Henry, and took possession of the archbishop's palace which was also St Andrews castle. John Hepburn, who still regarded himself as a contender for the vacancy, dislodged Douglas by force from the castle. The council met in St Andrews on 2 March 1514 at which Hepburn also attended and argued for the council to appeal to the pope to disregard all letters of support for Forman. Hepburn had successfully engineered the council's support as a letter dated 4 March from the king to the pope accused Forman of having a lot of blame for his father's death at Flodden — the letter also stated that Forman was now an exile and a rebel and intimated that his positions and benefices had been taken from him and called for Forman to be disregarded for the vacancy. Forman was not to be deprived as was confirmed in a letter that Leo wrote to Albany on 11 April and named the bishop of Moray for St Andrews. On 13 November, Leo formally provided Forman to St Andrews and followed up by making him legatus a latere on 11 December—the bulls were published in January 1515. In time, both Douglas and Hepburn, unable to secure the backing of Albany and the pope gave up the contest.\n\nAlbany left Paris for Scotland in May 1515 without Forman but then in June, Forman did travel to Scotland where he was placed under virtual house arrest in his own priory of Pittenweem and would remain there until the end of the year. Albany eventually managed to persuade the council to reluctantly accept Forman as archbishop and provided the temporalities of the see in February 1516.\n\nHe died in Dunfermline on 11 March 1521 and was buried in St Andrews Cathedral.\nLike many senior churchmen of his day, his vow of celibacy was not one that he kept and was known to have had a daughter Jane who married Sir Alexander Oliphant of Kellie.\n\nAndrew Forman was highly regarded at the courts of Europe and this respect did not go unrewarded. From King Louis XII of France he received the archbishopric of Bourges, from King Hendry VII of England he obtained the rectorship of the parish church of Cottingham and from his own master, King James IV many headships of Scottish monasteries, the recommendation to the bishopric of Moray and large tracts of land. Rome also appreciated his efforts and provided Forman firstly with the parsonage of Forest Church from Innocent VIII, then the commendatorship of Kelso Abbey from Julius II and finally and most importantly, the archbishopric of St Andrews and the commendatorship of Dunfermline Abbey from Leo X.\n\nForman's standing with Henry VIII was good in his early reign when the bishop was central in renewing the Treaty of Perpetual Peace and later in his attempts at mediation between the English and French kings. As King James edged ever closer to France and then with the renewal of the traditional Franco-Scottish alliance, Forman's embassies to France were distrusted and he was deprived of safe passage through England. That Andrew Forman was seen as the main instigator of the war was in early circulation in England—a contemporary document re-printed in full in the Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland contains the following excerpt:\n\nDyvers prisoners are taken of the Scottes, but noe notable personne, only Sir Willm Scott knight councelour of the said king of Scottes, and as is said a gentilman well lernyd. Also Sir John Forman knight broder to the Busshop of Murrey, which Busshop as is reported, was and is mosst principall procurour of this warre; \n\nDespite these early views, MacDougall argues that Forman's reputation was without doubt blackened by a coterie that included Gavin Douglas who was a principal competitor for the see of St Andrews and who had called Forman \"yon evyll myndit Byschep of Morray\". MacDougall also explains that Andrew Forman was one of the main participants in the peace treaty of 1502, its renewal in 1509 and his opposition to the renewal of the alliance with France in 1508; he goes on to say that it would have been inconceivable that the king could be manoeuvered into a position that was against his own wishes. The early chroniclers (Buchanan and Pitscottie) did nothing to revive Forman's tarnished reputation yet when King James took the advice of his General Council, only two counsellors opposed the French alliance—Bishop Elphinstone of Aberdeen and Archibald Douglas, the Earl of Angus.\n\nAccording to the chronicle writer Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie, Forman was the deviser of court theatre and spectacle for James IV and at the tournament of the Wild Knight and the Black Lady contrived a cloud that that descended from the ceiling of the hall and swept the Lady away.\n\n"}

They were regarded as the guardians of the sky in approximately 3000 BCE during the time of the Ancient Persians in the area of modern-day Iran. The Persians believed that the sky was divided into four districts with each district being guarded by one of the four Royal Stars. The stars were believed to hold both good and evil power and the Persians looked upon them for guidance in scientific calculations of the sky, such as the calendar and lunar/solar cycles, and for predictions about the future.\n\nAlthough there is mention of the Royal Stars influencing the ancient Egyptians in roughly 5,000 BCE, they were noted when the ancient Persian prophet Zarathustra mentioned them in the Bundahishn, the collection of Zoroastrian cosmogony and cosmology, in approximately 1,500 BCE.\n\nThe four stars with their modern names, and their ancient Persian names (in brackets) were: \n\nThe four dominant stars have an apparent magnitude–1.5 or brighter. The reason why they are called \"Royal\" is that they appear to stand aside from the other stars in the sky. The four stars, Aldebaran, Regulus, Antares, Fomalhaut, are the brightest stars in their constellations and among the 25–brightest stars in the night sky. The Persians considered these stars to be the four guardians of the heavens. They marked the seasonal changes and marked the equinoxes and solstices.\n\nAldebaran watched the Eastern sky and was the dominant star in the Taurus constellation, Regulus watched the North and was the dominant star in the Leo constellation, Antares watched the West and was the alpha star in Scorpio, and Fomalhaut watched the Southern sky and was the brightest star in Piscis Austrinus (sharing the same longitude with the star Sadalmelik which is the predominant star in Aquarius). Aldebaran marked the vernal equinox and Antares marked the autumnal equinox, while Regulus marked the Summer Solstice and Fomalhaut the Winter Solstice. While watching the sky, the dominant star would appear in its season, each having a time of the year when most noticeable. Regulus was seen as the main star because it was in the constellation of Leo, giving it the power of the lion, signifying the strength of kings with large implications.\n\nThe constellations of the Royal Stars were said to be fixed because their positions were close to the four fixed points of the sun's path. The sun was then surrounded by four bright stars at the beginning of every season. From this observation individuals began to denote them the Royal Stars.\n\nBy 700 BCE the Nineveh and Assyrians had essentially mapped the ecliptic cycle because of the four stars and were in result able to map the constellations, distinguishing them from the planets and the fixed stars. From this, in 747 BCE the Babylonian King Nabu-nasir adopted a calendar derived from information based on the four stars, one following an eight-year cycle and one a nineteen-year cycle (later adopting the nineteen-year calendar as standard).\n\nThe Royal Stars were used primarily for navigation. They were also believed to govern events in the world. Major disasters, breakthroughs, and historical phenomenons were seen as caused by the stars and their alignment in the sky during the time in which the event occurred. When the stars were aligned accordingly, favourable conditions followed, and when they were negatively aligned, disaster was predicted. Because Regulus was the most influential of the Royal Stars, events that took place while Regulus was in dominance were amplified and grave, foreshadowing destruction.\nSuch alignment only makes sense in configuratons including planets and stars and not just fixed stars.\n\nThe idea there existed four royal stars of Persia was analysed in a 1945 article in \"Popular Astronomy\", where the idea was criticized as largely a relatively modern invention, and / or a misunderstanding of the original source texts.\n\n\n"}

An attempt to revive the mine occurred when an individual tried to transform it into a visitor attraction, but his endeavour failed.\n\nThe site was bought by Mount Wellington Mine Ltd in early 2007, who removed the remaining headgear stump, and have proceeded to renovate the site. There are a number of tenants who operate exclusively in the renewable energy sector such as Kensa Heat Pumps, R-Eco and Geoquip Marine.\n\nFurther works on site are planned.\n\nDuring the 1920s, three brothers called Wellington worked the old Wheal Andrew lodes close to surface.\n\nThe brothers were mining in a small way, working with primitive plant and operations, taking ore to a Cornish stamps down the valley to be treated for its tin content. Captain Josiah Paull, of the Mines and Metallurgical Club in London, reported that the ore the Wellingtons were breaking was yielding an average of 30 lb. of black tin per ton. The workings around the shaft they were working were crushed at a later date, putting the shaft out of action, and “being only ordinary Cornish miners”, the Wellingtons did not have the money to either open up the adit or put down another shaft.\n\nIn 1935 Mount Wellington Ltd, backed by the British Non-ferrous Mining Corp Ltd, acquired the rights on United and Consolidated Mines, Wheal Clifford and Wheal Andrew. On 5 February shares in Mount Wellington Mine Ltd were advertised for sale.\n\nDuring the 1930s further shafts and mining buildings were built at Mount Wellington the mine acquired mining rights to the adjacent mines. However, by the end of the decade, milling was being suspended due to low tin prices, and it faced difficulties extracting the ore at sufficient quantities to show a profit.\n\nOn 16 December 1939 work stopped at Mount Wellington Mine due to lack of finance.\n\nIn 1963 International Mine Services Ltd of Toronto became interested in the mineral potential of Cornwall. By 1967 exploratory drilling began at Mount Wellington Mine and by 1969 a contract to sink No.1 Wellington Shaft and erect buildings was awarded to Thyssen (Great Britain Ltd) by Cornwall Tin & Mining Ltd.\n\nIn 1974 Mount Wellington mine, controlled by the Cornwall Tin and Mining Corporation, and situated a few miles to the west of Truro on the opposite side of the Bissoe Valley, to the neighbouring Wheal Jane mine, was to go ahead with the proposed tin mining operation. It was the third new tin mine in Cornwall in three years. \n\nThe erection of the concentrating plant commenced in preparation for receiving its first ore from underground in January 1976. The operation will cost initially some £4-25 million to finance and qualified for a 20% grant from the U.K. Government. \n\nThe initial throughput was forecast to be 0'2 million tonnes/annum in an all-gravity plant to provide about 1,600 tonnes of tin metal and some copper, zinc and silver. The shaft was to be deepened from 210m to 310m. The mine was planned to have a life of some 25 years, and the workforce planned was up to 300.\n\nHowever, on 20 April 1978 Mount Wellington Mine closed. No more ore ever came up Wellington's No.1 shaft after this date. No.1 shaft was retained for man and machinery access. The Wellington site was sold by the Administrators of Cornwall Tin & Mining Ltd to a Falmouth-based scrap dealer.\n\nIn August 1979 Carnon Consolidated, a subsidiary of Rio Tinto Zinc, acquired Wheal Jane from Consolidated Gold Fields Ltd. RTZ used Thyssens to redevelop Wheal Jane and used William Press to renovate Wheal Jane's mill. Carnon also bought the freehold of Wellington's No.1 shaft area, together with Wellington's Engineering Building from the scrap dealer. £10m was allocated to renovate both mines.\n\nAlso in 1979, Billiton Minerals (UK) Ltd, a Shell subsidiary, bought Hydraulic Tin of Bissoe, who worked alluvial tin and mine waste tailings. Billiton bought the rest of the land and buildings, including the Mill at Mount Wellington Mine. They also bought the Wheal Maid valley and the tailings dam and lagoon. Wellington's offices, and some land for storage of plant, were leased from Billiton by Thyssens. Thyssens used Wellington as a base for their work at Wheal Jane, South Crofty and Geevor mine.\n\nIn June 1980 production at Jane recommenced, some ore coming from Mount Wellington. The following year, a new 7” MDPE pipeline was laid between Wellington and the Tailings Dam at Wheal Maid. Old mine waste was sluffified and pumped into Wellington's Mill, where it was re-processed to obtain minerals.\n\nIn 1982 Carnon Consolidated (RTZ) purchased Billiton's freehold interest in the Mount Wellington, Wheal Maid and Hydraulic Tin sites.\n\nBy 1984 100% of South Crofty had been purchased by Carnon Consolidated, a subsidiary of Rio Tinto Zinc, and the three mines of Crofty, Mount Wellington and Wheal Jane operated as one unit. \n\nProduction at Wheal Jane had already restarted in 1980 reaching 1499 tonnes of tin in 1981 and 1863 tonnes in 1984. The Wheal Maid Decline was started, on land originally owned by Mount Wellington Mine. 1984 operations produced an estimated 35,000 tons of ore. The length of the Decline is 655 meters, and reached over towards Cornwall County Council's waste dump at United Downs. The Decline suffered from ingress of Methane gas from the dump, which gave rise to safety concerns over possible underground fires or explosion.\n\nIn March 1991 Wheal Jane, incorporating Mount Wellington Mine, the Wheal Maid Decline and the Wheal Maid Tailings Lagoons, were finally closed for the last time.\n\nOn 16 January 1992 the UK's most infamous mine water outburst disaster occurred when 320 million litres of untreated acidic mine water and sludge burst from the Nangiles adit at the Wheal Jane Mine site in Cornwall into the Carnon River. This resulted in a major pollution plume that discoloured the estuary and deposited high concentrations of Cd and Zn. Cadmium levels reached 600 mg 1-1, relative to UK water quality standards of 1 mg 1-1\n\nIn 1998 Mount Wellington Mine was bought by David Shrigley of DRS Demolition from South Crofty PLC. DRS submitted multiple planning applications for change of use for the Mount Wellington Mine site, however all were rejected.\n\nCarrick District Council gave planning consent for retention of the Mount Wellington Mine buildings in 2003.\n\nBy 15 April 2004, Carrick District Council was reviewing the future of Mount Wellington Mine at Twelveheads, Bissoe. Councillors discussed what could be done with the former mine so future possible developers could have a clear idea of its potential. \n\nIn his report to the committee, Carrick's head of development, Karl Roberts, said the site was clearly unsuitable for a residential development. The committee's comments and the report's findings were to be looked at by Carrick's full cabinet. Mount Wellington Mine had not operated for more than 10 years, and at one point, looked set to be turned into a nature reserve.\n\nIn 2005 the top of headgear at Mount Wellington were demolished.\n\nOn 15 January 2007 Mount Wellington Mine was purchased by Richard Freeborn of Mount Wellington Mine Ltd. Mount Wellington Mine was officially re-opened by Tim Smit from The Eden Project on 22 January. \n\nOn 30 May 2012 a celebration was held to commemorate the 5th anniversary of the move of Kensa heat pumps to the Mount Wellington Mine site as its first tenant. The gathering included – for the first time in some decades - the combined Management Teams of all four modern Cornish tin mines – Geevor, South Crofty, Wheal Jane and Mount Wellington Mine.\n\nIn 2013, international offshore engineering company Geoquip bought the assets of Ocean Fabrications and took over the leases on the site. The old offices in The Dry were renovated, and substantial new investment was placed in the Mill Building and its associated plant yard. \n\nOn St Piran's day, Saturday 5 March 2016, the Cornish Radio Amateur Club (CRAC) made a special one-time-only broadcast at Mount Wellington Mine. The club obtained a Special Events Station Licence to activate the use of the Cornish Mine as an amateur radio station.\n\nAlso in 2016 Eagle Plant opened an accommodation hire business on the site followed in February 2017 by a Plant Hire operation.\n\nIn 2017, new tenants Metal Surgery and Building With Frames replaced Geoquip in the Mill and Concentrator buildings respectively.\n\n"}

Collyer is perhaps best known for his appearances with Ring of Honor and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling.\n\nCollyer attended Manchester College, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree. He was an accomplished amateur wrestler, winning multiple championships over an eleven-year period, but decided to turn professional and continue his amateur career at Manchester College during his freshman year.\n\nUpon graduation, Collyer traveled to Tampa, Florida to train at the Malenko Pro Wrestling School under Dean Malenko and Jeff Bradley. Collyer began training on August 3, 1997.

It is the second highest mountain of the Écrins after the Barre des Écrins.\n\nNeighboring peaks are Le Râteau (3,809 m) to the west, past the \"Brèche de la Meije\" (3,357 m) and (3,823 m) and Pic Gaspard (3,881 m) to the southeast, past the Brèche Maximin Gaspard (3,723 m)\n\nThe central and second highest summit has five teeth, the highest of which is known as \"Doigt de Dieu\" (English: \"Finger of God\"). This summit was reached from the northeast on June 28, 1870, by Christian and Ulrich Almer and Christian Gertsch, guiding Meta Brevoort and W.A.B. Coolidge. The ridge from the central to the main, Western peak, which is 13 meters higher, was considered an insurmountable obstacle for the next 15 years.\n\nThe Western true summit of La Meije, the \"Grand Pic\", is notorious for having no \"easy\" route to its summit. The last major peak in the Alps to be climbed, its first ascent was eventually made from the southwest on 16 August 1877 by father and son Pierre Gaspard and their client Emmanuel Boileau de Castelnau. Their approach, over the south buttress \"Arête du Promontoire\" and further over the \"Glacier Carré\" and the southwest face of the Grand Pic, is now the normal route.\n\nOn July 26, 1885, Ludwig Purtscheller and the brothers Otto and Emil Zsigmondy made the first traverse from the central to the main summit, via the \"insurmountable\" gap that is now known as the \"Brèche Zsigmondy\", in what is still considered a classic route, albeith thoroughly modified by a May 1964 rockfall. The traverse in the opposite direction was accomplished six years later by Ulrich Almer, Fritz Boss and J. H. Gibson.\n\nThe south face is widely considered to be the most difficult of La Meije. Within two weeks after their successful traverse, the Zsigmondy brothers, together with Karl Schulz, tried to reach the Brèche Zsigmondy over the south face, but Emil died in the attempt. The first successful attempt was not until twenty-seven years later, in 1912 by Angelo Dibona, Luigi Rizzi, and the brothers Guido and Max Mayer, while a direct route over the south face to the Grand Pic was only climbed in 1935 and that to the Central Pic in 1951.\n\nFor mountaineering, La Meije can be approached from two mountain refuges:\n\n\n"}

This nature reserve built mostly of granite is 718 m high and covered with forests.\n\nThe top of the mountain has a PTTK tourist Mountain hut, a TV and radio mast, church Mary, poorly visible ruins of the castle and observation tower. The mountain and its surrounding region form the protected area called Ślęża Landscape Park.\n\nDuring the Neolithic Period and at least as far back as the 7th century BC Mount Ślęża (Zobten) was a holy place of the tribes of the Lusatian culture. It was then settled by Slavs. \nThe Silingi, a subpopulation of the East Germanic tribe known as the Vandals are the earliest inhabitants of Silesia known by their name, however the greater part of them moved westwards after the 5th century AD and the remainder were slowly replaced in the 6th century by Slavic tribes who assimilated the few remaining East Germanic inhabitants. The Silingi were part of the Przeworsk culture. \nThe name of the territory Silesia either derives from the Ślęza River, or from Mount Ślęża, which themselves derive their name from either, according to Germanist authors the Silingi people. or, according to Slavisist authors, the Ślężanie people.\n\nThe Slavic Ślężanie tribe settled in the area around the 6th Century AD. In the 10th Century, Mieszko I of the Piast dynasty incorporated Silesia into the Polish state. The etymology of the mountain is highly disputed between a Slavic, Germanic, or other Indo-European origin. The name has been recorded in several forms. As monte Silencii, in 1108, or as monte Slez in 1245.\n\nChristianity came first via the Byzantine Church Slavonic missionaries saints Cyril and Methodius and by the diocese of Regensburg, then in the 10th century Bohemia received a bishopric, Prague, which was itself subject to the archbishopric of Mainz.\n\nMount Ślęża was an ancient holy place for local tribes dedicated to a sun deity, and remained a holy place during Christian times as well. In the first half of the 12th century, the owner of the place was the Polish dukes' governor, Piotr Włostowic, who founded there an Augustinian convent which was subsequently moved to Wrocław in 1153.\n\nThe Silesians might have been named after the Silingi, as the Silingi were previous inhabitants of this region. Another explanation says that the word is perhaps derived from a Silesian word meaning \"wet swampy place\", the corresponding verb is \"Ślęgnąć\" meaning \"to become wet\".\n\nMount Ślęża has been portrayed in the famous but atypical manner of Polish independent film (in Poland called ) Edi800 in the movie \"Ślęża Manekin Project III\".\n\nOn Ślęża there is a facility for FM- and TV-transmission, which uses a 136 metre tall free-standing (with additional guying) lattice tower. The current tower which was built in 1972 replaced a 98 metre tall tower built in 1957, which was partially guyed.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2252282", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2252282", "title": "Tabora", "text": "Tabora\n\nTabora is the capital of Tanzania's Tabora Region and is classified as a municipality by the Tanzanian government. It is also the administrative seat of Tabora Urban District. According to the 2012 census, this district had a population of 226,999.\n\nBeginning in the 1830s, coastal traders increasingly settled in the region to take advantage of the ivory and slave caravan trade. Swahili and Omani traders established Kazeh, near present-day Tabora, in the 1850s. By 1870, Tabora was home to a population of 5,000-10,000 people living in roughly fifty large square houses. These homes accommodated up to several hundred people each and had inner courtyards, adjacent garden plots, store rooms, servant quarters and outhouses for slaves. The town was also surrounded by Nyamwezi villages, which provided produce and caravan labor. In this period the Sultan of Zanzibar appointed a representative there. It was part of the Kingdom of Unyanyembe. By August 1871, one-quarter of the town was burned when the forces of the Wanyamwezi ruler Mirambo sacked it. Although the German East Africa protectorate was proclaimed over the region in 1885, as late as 1891 travellers reported it to be a lawless town, and the German colonial administration did not gain control of it until later that year. As a major station on the Central Line it became the most important administrative centre of central German East Africa.\n\nIn 1916 the colonial garrison had an emergency mint at Tabora, making some gold pieces as well as large numbers of crude copper and brass German East African rupie minor coins Mint marked with a \"T\". During the Tabora Offensive in the East African Campaign of World War I, colonial armed forces of the Belgian Congo (\"Force Publique\") under the command of General Charles Tombeur captured the town on 19 September 1916 after 10 days and nights of heavy fighting.\n\nTabora and its people mainly rely on agricultural activities as either sustenance farmers or small-scale tobacco farmers. Tabora also hosts a ballast quarry.\n\nWater supply is managed by the Tabora Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Authority (Tuwasa), sourced from Igombe and Kazima Dams. The Igombe River is a tributary of the Malagarasi River and the Malagarasi-Muyovozi Wetlands\n\nTabora's streets are lined with century-old mango trees planted by Omani traders. Tabora is known as the fruit capital of Western Tanzania, and markets are often filled with local produce.\n\nTabora has many small local restaurants offering typical Tanzanian restaurant food like Ugali (a thick maize porridge), chips, or rice with beans, beef or chicken. For breakfast or lunch, there is usually chipsi-mayai (chips and egg), which is basically a couple of eggs fried together with some chips. Although the food is bland, it is usually served with Tanzanian chili sauce, which gives the meal some character.\n\nA local specialty is pumpkin in peanut butter sauce. This goes with the rice pilau served widely throughout the region.\n\nFor snacks there are local sambusa (samosa), some goat meat on a stick or some freshly roasted corn of the cob, all widely available in Tabora. There is a choice of fruit in the large regional market of Tabora, including pineapples, watermelons, and bananas.\n\nTabora does not have many tourist attractions. It is well off the beaten track, with few tourists. Of note is Fort Boma, erected at the end of the 19th century by the Germans and still in use by the military of Tanzania. Another colonial remnant is the railway station.\n\nAbout 9 Miles (15 kilometres) south west of Tabora is Kwihara town, formerly known as Kazeh and an important town in the slave trade until the Germans started developing Tabora. Kazeh's best-known visitors were David Livingstone and Sir Henry Morton Stanley, who were highly impressed by the town of Kazeh. There is a small museum dedicated to Dr Livingstone, called \"the Livingstone Museum\", with entry costing 2,000 Tanzanian shillings.\n\nAnother day trip from Tabora is Igombe Dam, a local forest reserve.\n\nTabora is small enough to walk from one side of town to the other. Bicycle taxis, motorbike taxis and regular taxis are available.\n\nTabora at the moment is served by an unpaved Trunk road T18 from Singida Region to Kigoma and an unpaved trunk road T8 from Mbeya to Mwanza passing through the district. Salt flats to the west prevent a direct road from connecting to Kigoma.\n\nIn January 2013, the Tanzanian government announced the commencement of work to upgrade to tarmac level the Tabora-Urambo road and the Nyahua-Tabora-Ndono road. In December 2012, Prime Minister Mizengo Pinda stated the Tanzanian government's intent to upgrade the Tabora-Inyonga-Mpanda road to tarmac level before 2015. In August 2011, Deputy Minister for Works Harrison Mwakyembe told the National Assembly that the government had begun to tarmac the Tabora-Puge-Nzega road.\n\nTabora is served and is a junction on the Central railway line, which goes east to Dar es Salaam, west to Kigoma on to the Lake Tanganyika and north to the port of Mwanza on Lake Victoria. Trains leave three times a week in any direction.\n\nIn 2017, a new station on the standard gauge railway is proposed.\n\nTabora is served by the Tabora Airport which is located 7 kilometers south of the centre of town. Renovation of the airport was completed in 2015.\n\nPrecision Air started flying to the airport three times a week on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, east from Julius Nyerere International Airport Dar es Salaam and west from Kigoma.\n\n\n"}

Napoleon set up a temporary authority, the \"General Administration of Lombardy\", which replaced the Austrian officials and created a French client republic in Northern Italy, adopting the French Republican Calendar.\n\nThe Administration was granted full civil powers by a proclamation of Napoleon on Brumaire 8, year V (29 October 1796), even if its orders had to be approved by the French military commander of Lombardy. The Administration was composed of four departments: one for religious and cultural affairs, one for transportation and engineering affairs, one for financial and tax affairs, and one for mercantile and commercial affairs.\n\nAfter the new victories of Napoleon's army, the territory of the republic grew; with the Preliminars of Leoben of 17 April 1797, France began the occupation of the Most Serene Republic of Venice, conquering Bergamo and moving eastwards from the Adda River to the Oglio River, the demarcation line with the Venetian territories established more than three centuries earlier. On 19 May, Napoleon transferred to Milan the territories of the former Duchy of Modena from the bordering Cispadane Republic. On 29 June, the General decided to give to the republic a final arrangement and a \"pro forma\" independence: by his own decree, he proclaimed the birth of the Cisalpine Republic.\n\n"}
{"id": "2252299", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2252299", "title": "Isosorbide", "text": "Isosorbide\n\nIsosorbide is a bicyclic chemical compound from the group of diols and the oxygen-containing heterocycles, containing two fused furan rings. The starting material for isosorbide is D-sorbitol, which is obtained by catalytic hydrogenation of D-glucose, which is in turn produced by hydrolysis of starch. Isosorbide is discussed as a plant-based platform chemical from which biodegradable derivatives of various functionality can be obtained.\n\nIsosorbide is currently of great scientific and technical interest as a monomer building block for biopolymeric polycarbonates, polyesters, polyurethanes and epoxides.\n\nHydrogenation of glucose gives sorbitol. Isosorbide is obtained by acid-catalyzed dehydration of D-sorbitol which yields the monocyclic furanoid sorbitan, which in turn forms by further dehydration the bicyclic furofuran derivative isosorbide.\n\nThe reaction gives about 70 to 80% isosorbide in addition to 30 to 20% of undesirable by-products which have to be removed costly by distillation, recrystallization from alcohols, recrystallization from the melt, by a combination of these methods or by deposition from the vapor phase. A high purity product (> 99.8%) is essential for the use of a monomer when uncoloured, high molecular weight polymers shall be obtained.\n\nIsosorbide is a white, crystalline, highly hydrophilic solid. The two secondary hydroxy groups in the V-shaped bicyclic system possess different orientations leading to different chemical reactivities. This allows a selective monoderivatization of isosorbide. The hydroxy group in 5-position is \"endo\" oriented and forms a hydrogen bond with the oxygen atom in the adjacent furan ring. This makes the hydroxy group in 5-position more nucleophilic and more reactive than the \"exo\" oriented hydroxy group in 2-position; however, it is more shielded from the attack of sterically demanding reactants.\n\nWith an LD value of 25.8 g·kg (rat, oral), isosorbide is similarly nontoxic as D-glucose (also with an LD of 25.8 g·kg, rat, oral) and is classified by the Food and Drug Administration FDA as GRAS (\"generally recognized as safe\").\n\nBecause of its pronounced hygroscopicity, isosorbide is used as a humectant and in medicine as an osmotic diuretic (for the treatment of hydrocephalus) and acute angle-closure glaucoma. The two secondary hydroxy groups make isosorbide a versatile platform chemical accessible from renewable resources. As a diol, isosorbide can be mono- or biderivatized using the standard methods of organic chemistry, such as nitration, esterification, etherification, tosylation, etc., and converted into compounds with interesting properties or into monomeric units for novel polymers.\n\nBy nitration of isosorbide with concentrated nitric acid, 2,5-isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) can be obtained. 2,5-isosorbide dinitrate is suitable (just like its major metabolite 5-isosorbide mononitrate, ISMN) for the treatment of angina pectoris due to its vasodilator effect.\n\nEsterification of isosorbide with fatty acids gives access to isosorbide monoesters, which are useful as detergents in household cleaners, dishwashing detergents, and cosmetic preparations, because of their properties as surfactant. The likewise readily available isosorbide diesters are used as dispersants for pigments, preservatives, polymer stabilizers, as emulsifiers for cosmetics and as plasticizers for vinyl polymers (in particular polyvinyl chloride, PVC). Isosorbide dioctanoate is a diester of isosorbide and octanoic acid (obtained from palm oil, for example) and therefore made entirely from bio-based building blocks and has been used as Polysorb ID 37 by Roquette Frères for some time as a particularly non-toxic product.\n\nIsosorbide ethers (and in particular the simplest representative, 2,5-dimethylisosorbide, abbreviated DMI), are increasingly used as a renewable solvent for cosmetic and pharmaceutical preparations, as an electrolyte additive for lithium-ion accumulators [18] and as a fuel additive for diesel.\n\nPhosphoric acid derivatives of isosorbide are explored as an environmentally friendly alternative to halogen-containing flame retardants. So far, 1,2,5,6,9,10-hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) has been widely used as a flame retardant in extruded polystyrene foam (XPS) in the construction and insulation sector, but it was as SVHC (substance of very high concern) banned from manufacturing and application in May 2013. Phosphorus-based isosorbide compounds, such as isosorbide bis (diphenyl phosphate) [ISTP] are considered as a replacement.\n\nISTP is readily accessible by transesterification of isosorbide with triphenyl phosphate in the presence of potassium carbonate at 150 °C. The isosorbide-bis-diphenyl phosphate obtained in 88% yield as a yellowish oil contains about 20% dimers. The high decomposition temperature of ISTP allows a use in XPS, although the high softening effect is a drawback. The flame retardancy is particularly pronounced in the presence of sulfur-containing synergists such as bis(diphenylphosphinothionyl)disulfide (BDPS). This allows to reach the minimum requirement of fire protection (class B2) with only 3% ISTP.\n\nIsosorbide has a high thermal stability and is by now well available from renewable raw materials. This makes isosorbide of interest as a monomer for thermoplastic (bio)polymers such as polyesters and polycarbonates, as well as for thermosets such as polyurethanes or epoxy resins. The hydroxy groups can be converted into the primary amino groups via the tosylates and azides or by addition of acrylonitrile followed by hydrogenation into the corresponding aminopropyl derivatives. The latter are used as starting materials for di-isocyanates - for the preparation of polyurethanes - as diamines for the preparation of polyamides or as a hardener for epoxy resins.\n\nWhen monoethylene glycol as a diol is replaced with isosorbide in the polyester polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyisosorbide terephthalate (PIT) is obtained, which is characterized by an extreme thermal stability (up to 360 °C under nitrogen). However, the inherently lower reactivity of the secondary hydroxyl groups in isosorbide cause in comparison lower molecular weights and high residual contents of terephthalic acid, which leads to the insufficient chemical stability of the resulting polymers. Therefore, today's polyesters with isosorbide and monoethylene glycol are examined as diol components that show improved properties such as less discoloration.\n\nIsosorbide is of particular interest as a monomer for polycarbonates, where it could replace the bisphenol A, which was identified as xenoestrogen. Limitations of isosorbide-based polycarbonates are their unsatisfactory temperature resistance and limited impact resistance, which can be improved though by the addition of comonomers to the isosorbide or by polymer blends.\n\nIn polyurethanes, isosorbide itself can serve as a diol [28] or as a building block for the polyol [29] as well as for the diisocyanate component or as a chain extender.\n\nBy reacting isosorbide with epichlorohydrin, isosorbide bis-glycidyl ether (a bis-epoxide) is formed, which can be used as a replacement for the analog bisphenol A bis-epoxide. Isosorbide bis-glycidyl ether can be crosslinked to a thermosetting epoxy resins with suitable curing agents, such as polyamines or cyclic acid anhydrides. These resins are used as adhesives, paints or coatings for food cans. Furthermore, polyoxazolidones are described which can be obtained by reaction of isosorbide diglycidyl ethers with diisocyanates. Polyoxazolidones could find use as rigid, highly branched and solvent-resistant thermoset plastics in the electrical and electronics industry.\n\nIsosorbide is a versatile platform chemical derived from renewable resources that is now also available in industrial quantities of tens of thousands of tonnes/year. The use of isosorbide as a comonomer in PET as a bottle raw material and as a substitute for bisphenol A, especially in thermosetting polycarbonates, is currently considered particularly promising.\n"}

The station is owned by Gray Television. WVUE's primary studios are located on Jefferson Davis Parkway in the city's Gert Town section, with a secondary studio within the Benson Tower in downtown New Orleans; its transmitter is located on Magistrate Street in Chalmette. On cable, WVUE is available on Cox Communications channel 9 (cable channel 8 is occupied by an educational access channel, an artifact of Cox preventing co-channel interference in the analog era).\n\nThe station first signed on the air on November 1, 1953 as WJMR-TV. Founded by Supreme Broadcasting Co., a locally based company run by lawyer Chester F. Owens (who served as the company's president), it was the second television station to sign on the air in the New Orleans market (behind WDSU-TV, which signed on in December 1948) and the third in Louisiana (behind WDSU-TV and Baton Rouge's WAFB, which signed on in April 1953). Originally broadcasting on UHF channel 61, it was moved to channel 20 on July 20, 1955. It originally operated as a primary CBS affiliate, while splitting ABC programming in off-hours with WDSU-TV. During 1957 and 1958, WJMR-TV had simulcast its signal on VHF channel 12, using the call sign KK2XFW. When WWL-TV (channel 4) signed on in September 1957, WWL took over the CBS affiliation because of WWL radio's longtime affiliation with the CBS Radio Network, leaving WJMR with ABC.\n\nThe station moved to VHF channel 13 on January 13, 1959 and subsequently changed its call letters to WVUE on February 1. The station moved to channel 12 on September 6, 1962 due to interference with Biloxi, Mississippi ABC affiliate WLOX, which also broadcasts on channel 13. Screen Gems, the television arm of Columbia Pictures, acquired the station from Supreme Broadcasting in 1965. On June 8, 1970 at 8:00 p.m., it made a highly publicized switch of channel positions with the city's PBS member station, WYES-TV, and moved to VHF channel 8, during an airing of the 1954 movie \"The Naked Jungle\". This was done to give WVUE a greater broadcast signal range; while on channel 12, it had operated at relatively low power to avoid interfering with the signal of Jackson, Mississippi's WJTV, which had also broadcast on channel 12. The channel 61 allocation was later assigned to WLPN-LP (which operated from 1989 to the late 2000s) and the channel 20 allocation was assigned to religious station WHNO (which signed on in October 1994).\nColumbia Pictures sold WVUE to Oklahoma City-based Gaylord Broadcasting Company in 1977. WVUE started broadcasting 24 hours a day in June 1986, becoming the last commercial television station in New Orleans to transition to a round-the-clock schedule. When Gaylord Broadcasting began a gradual paring down of its station group in 1987 (which would not be completed until 1999), WVUE was sold to the Burnham Broadcasting Company.\n\nOn December 18, 1993, the Fox Broadcasting Company outbid CBS for the rights to the NFL's National Football Conference television package. In March 1994, Fox partnered with minority-owned communications firm Savoy Pictures (which would serve as majority partner) to form SF Broadcasting. On August 25, 1994, the company bought WVUE, WALA-TV in Mobile, Alabama and KHON-TV in Honolulu, Hawaii for $229 million; fellow sister station WLUK-TV in Green Bay, Wisconsin was sold to the company one month earlier in a separate $38 million deal, which for a time, was challenged by an FCC petition filed by NBC alleging that the deal violated foreign investment limits for U.S. broadcasters (the only Burnham station exempted from the deal was KBAK-TV in Bakersfield, California, which was spun off to Westwind Communications, a company founded by several former Burnham executives). As part of the deal, Fox signed a long-term agreement, in which the network would affiliate with SF's four \"Big Three\" network affiliates, beginning in the fall of 1995. Fox originally planned to own a minority voting stock in SF Broadcasting; however, in 1995, Fox opted against holding a voting interest (which would have resulted in the stations being counted against the FCC's station ownership total), although it would retain an ownership stake. The transaction was completed in the summer of 1995.\n\nWVUE-TV affiliated with Fox on January 1, 1996, ending its 43-year affiliation with ABC, which moved to WGNO (channel 26); New Orleans's original Fox affiliate, WNOL-TV (channel 38), took WGNO's former WB affiliation (that network had been affiliated with WGNO for just shy of a year prior to the switch, due to that station's owner, Tribune Broadcasting's partial ownership interest in The WB). Of the former Burnham stations that switched to Fox, WVUE was the only one involved in the deal that was an ABC affiliate: WALA (now owned by the Meredith Corporation), WLUK (now owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group) and KHON (now owned by Nexstar Media Group) had previously been affiliated with NBC.\n\nBecause of Fox's acquisition of television rights to the National Football Conference, the switch resulted in channel 8 becoming the unofficial \"home\" station for the New Orleans Saints, carrying many of the team's Sunday afternoon road games. WWL-TV had aired most of the Saints' games beginning in 1970, when CBS assumed rights to the NFC upon the merger of the American Football League and the National Football League; when CBS lost the NFC broadcast rights to Fox in 1994, the Saints telecasts resided on WNOL-TV for the following two years. In addition to WVUE, the team's regular season games televised over-the-air locally are split primarily between WWL-TV (for select games televised by CBS in which the Saints play against an AFC opponent; CBS also had the rights to the Saints' lone Super Bowl), WGNO (through over-the-air rights to the NFL Network's \"Thursday Night Football\" package), WDSU (through NBC's rights to Sunday prime time and select playoff games as well as its local broadcast rights to \"Monday Night Football\" contests during occasions when a game involving the Saints is scheduled) and preseason games (which, as of 2019, are produced by Gray's sports division Raycom Sports). WVUE also gave local coverage to two Super Bowls, XXXVI and XXXI, both of which were held at the Louisiana Superdome.\n\nOn November 28, 1995, Silver King Communications (operated by former Fox executive Barry Diller) announced that it would acquire Savoy Pictures; at the time of the purchase, Silver King's existing stations had mainly been affiliates of the Home Shopping Network (both Silver King and HSN were later acquired by USA Networks). The sale of WVUE and the other SF stations was approved and finalized in March 1996, with its other assets being merged into the company that November. On April 1, 1998, Silver King subsequently sold the stations to Emmis Communications for $307 million in cash and stock, as part of a sale of its major network affiliates in order to concentrate on its formerly HSN-affiliated independent stations. On May 15, 2005, Emmis Communications announced that it would sell its 16 television stations, including WVUE, in order to concentrate on its radio properties.\n\nAfter Hurricane Katrina struck Greater New Orleans on August 29, 2005, WVUE temporarily moved its operations to the studios of then-sister station WALA-TV in Mobile, Alabama. WVUE's facility on Jefferson Davis Parkway is located in a low-lying part of New Orleans that was badly flooded due to the levee failures caused by Katrina. The damage that was caused to the building was so severe that Emmis released much of the station's on-air staff from their non-compete clauses, allowing them to seek employment outside of the market without penalty. Soon, meteorologist Crystal Wicker left for Indianapolis ABC affiliate WRTV, where she began work on October 3. Weekend meteorologist Jeff Baskin went to Portland, Oregon's KOIN-TV; reporter Summer Jackson went to Chicago to work at CLTV, while reporter Kerry Cavanaugh took a job at WBAL-TV in Baltimore.\n\nFollowing the storm, WVUE presented a rotating 15-minute newscast that was streamed on its website and was produced out of WALA's studios, slowly restoring the station's regular schedule as developments faded and reconstruction on WVUE's news operations continued. WVUE later resumed its over-the-air broadcasts from a low-power transmitter as an alternate site, which provided a reduced signal that did not reach most of the market; the station's analog signal was upgraded to full power on September 19, 2005 from its transmitter facility in Chalmette, which had flooded during the storm. In mid-June 2006, construction of the station's permanent news set and weather center was completed. Before then, a temporary news set and newsroom were set up in the station's production room. Station manager Vanessa Oubre said that remodeling/reconstruction of the rest of the building was expected to be completed by November 2006. The sale of the station was also affected and was delayed for two years because of the rebuilding; Emmis had intended to divest all its television assets by the start of 2007, but retained ownership of WVUE in the interim until a buyer was found.\n\nOn May 5, 2008, Emmis Communications announced an agreement to sell the station to the Louisiana Media Company, a media group founded by Tom Benson (owner of the city's two major league sports franchises, the NFL's New Orleans Saints and the NBA's New Orleans Pelicans) for $41 million. Benson stated that he planned for the new company to acquire several radio and television stations nationwide and to be involved in movie production. The FCC approved the sale on July 14, 2008, with the transfer being finalized four days later on July 18. In August 2012, WVUE opened a secondary studio facility (branded as the \"Window on New Orleans\") on the second floor of the Benson Tower in downtown New Orleans (overlooking Champions Square and the Mercedes-Benz Superdome) that was utilized for the station's weekday morning newscast and for coverage of sports events. When Hurricane Isaac struck the area in August 2012, the station provided a web stream of the station's storm coverage to Shreveport ABC affiliate KTBS-TV, which carried WVUE's stream over digital subchannel 3.3, to provide information for area evacuees who relocated to the Ark-La-Tex region.\n\nIn October 2013, Retirement Systems of Alabama (RSA) stated in its newsletter, \"The Advisor\", that Raycom Media (a company which RSA invests in), would purchase WVUE for $55.6 million. A spokesperson for Tom Benson called \"The Advisor\" item \"inaccurate\" and that the station was not for sale; RSA CEO David Brenner called the report a \"mistake.\" However, on November 20, 2013, Raycom announced that it would begin operating WVUE under a shared services agreement (SSA) to take effect on December 16; under the agreement, Benson remained WVUE's owner and retained the station's license, but most of WVUE's staff became Raycom employees; Louisiana Media president Joe Cook, who relinquished his additional duties as the station's general manager, commented that the deal would allow WVUE to benefit from the regional presence that Raycom provides; the Alabama-based station group has a well-established presence in the Southeastern U.S., including ownership of three other stations in Louisiana (in Baton Rouge, Lake Charles and Shreveport). Upon the takeover, former WWL-TV news director Sandy Breland was appointed as WVUE's vice president and general manager, joining other WWL and Belo alumni among its staff.\n\nThe partnership stemmed from a near-acquisition of the station by Raycom, which had been one of several companies to make offers for the station. However, Benson was not prepared to sell WVUE completely, leading to the negotiation of the SSA. Raycom president Paul McTear also noted that the story in \"The Advisor\" was the result of human error, and that there was not a deal to acquire the station. Benson had considered expanding his broadcast holdings into other nearby markets, but noticed that Raycom had a presence in all of the markets he considered.\n\nOn February 6, 2017, Louisiana Media Company exercised the option to sell WVUE's license assets to Raycom. Two months later on April 4, Raycom formally announced that it would purchase WVUE from the Louisiana Media Company for $51.8 million. Benson would continue to retain a stake in WVUE. Raycom management and Benson finalized the sale on August 8. Benson died several months later, on March 15, 2018; the Benson estate continues to maintain the minority stake in WVUE.\n\nOn June 25, 2018, less than a year after the full acquisition of WVUE by Raycom, Atlanta-based Gray Television announced it had reached an agreement with Raycom to merge their respective broadcasting assets (consisting of Raycom's 63 existing owned-and/or-operated television stations, including WVUE, and Gray's 93 television stations) under the former's corporate umbrella. The cash-and-stock merger transaction valued at $3.6 billion–in which Gray shareholders would acquire preferred stock currently held by Raycom–will result in WVUE gaining new sister stations in nearby markets, including CBS/ABC affiliate KNOE-TV in Monroe and NBC/CBS affiliate KALB-TV in Alexandria, in addition to its current Raycom sister stations. The combined company will be in every Louisiana market except for Lafayette as a result. The sale was approved on December 20, and was completed on January 2, 2019.\n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nDigital subchannel 8.2 originally launched in 2007 as the Fox 8 Newschannel, a 24-hour news simulcast and rebroadcast service similar to WWL-TV's NewsWatch 15 cable channel. On August 23, 2010, WVUE announced that it would carry the Retro Television Network on a digital subchannel; that September, 8.2 switched to a mix of RTV programming on weekdays, as well as similar general entertainment programming on weekends. On November 11, 2011, WVUE signed an affiliation agreement with Bounce TV; the network replaced RTV on digital subchannel 8.2 on November 12, 2011. In March 2012, WVUE became one of the first (if not the first) stations in the United States to create a managerial position for a subchannel, with the hiring of Curtis Pace as general manager of digital channel 8.2.\n\nWVUE shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 8, on December 15, 2008, becoming the first New Orleans television station to cease analog transmission of its signal and exclusively broadcast a digital signal, and the second, after Telemundo affiliate KGLA-DT (channel 42, which signed on in June 2007 without a companion analog signal), to become a digital-only station prior to the June 12, 2009 digital television transition. One week later on December 22, the station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 29 to VHF channel 8. Due to reception problems that were reported by viewers following the transition, WVUE petitioned the FCC to move its digital signal back to UHF channel 29. The station opted to do this instead of increasing its transmitter power, which would have caused interference with Baton Rouge CBS affiliate WAFB (whose analog signal operated on VHF channel 9, where its digital signal operates post-transition). WVUE resumed digital operations on UHF channel 29 on November 30, 2010.\n\nAfter the Louisiana Media Company acquired WVUE from Emmis Communications, a high definition feed of the station's digital signal was finally added to Cox Communications' New Orleans system in August 2008, and to Charter Communications systems in the Northshore and Tri-Parish area in that September (both Charter and Cox carry WVUE-DT on digital channel 708). WVUE's high definition feed has since been added to other cable providers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi, as well as in the New Orleans market on AT&T U-verse.\n\nWVUE-DT currently carries the majority of the Fox network schedule, though like most news-heavy Fox stations, it delays the network's Saturday late night hour by a half-hour due to a 10:00 p.m. newscast. Channel 8 has aired Fox's prime time, late night, news, children's and sports programming since it joined the network in January 1996; the only regular exception has been \"Fox NFL Kickoff\", which WVUE has declined carriage of since the Sunday pre-game show and \"Fox NFL Sunday\" lead-in moved to Fox from Fox Sports 1 in September 2015, due to its existing commitment to carry the \"official\" New Orleans Saints pregame show \"Saints Pre Game Live\" on Sunday mornings during the NFL regular season (the program is not carried at all in the New Orleans market, as Fox has not secured a substitute outlet among the market's minor network affiliates—either CW affiliate WNOL-TV (channel 38) or MyNetworkTV affiliate WUPL (channel 54)—to carry \"Fox NFL Kickoff\"). Syndicated programs broadcast by WVUE-TV include \"Rachael Ray\", \"Wheel of Fortune\", \"Live with Kelly and Ryan\", \"Right This Minute\", \"25 Words or Less\", \"Judge Judy\" and \"Jeopardy!\". WVUE is one of eight Fox affiliates to air both \"Jeopardy!\" and \"Wheel\"; the others being located in Baltimore; Syracuse, New York; Cincinnati; Green Bay, Wisconsin; Denver; Lake Charles, Louisiana and Mobile, Alabama.\n\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, the station consistently ranked at a distant third place in the ratings behind WWL-TV and WDSU-TV, even as ABC topped the national ratings for a time in the mid-1970s. One of the primary reasons for WVUE's third-place position was the station's heavy preemptions of network programs. For example, during much of the 1970s, WVUE preempted portions of ABC's daytime soap opera lineup and aired westerns, cartoons and off-network sitcoms in their place. Additionally, WVUE did not carry many of the network's Saturday morning cartoons, as well as \"American Bandstand\". WVUE also preempted ABC's late night programming, which prior to the 1979 debut of \"Nightline\", consisted of movies and reruns of prime time series. Viewers in the New Orleans market that wanted to see most of ABC's full schedule could watch the network's other affiliates in surrounding markets: WRBT (now WVLA) and later WBRZ from Baton Rouge, west of New Orleans, to WLOX from Biloxi, to the east, or to WAPT from Jackson, to the north. Under Gaylord's ownership, WVUE reinstated ABC's entire lineup of daytime soaps to its schedule in the fall of 1978. In spite of ownership changes and programming modifications, WVUE was still unable to improve its standing in the ratings and largely wouldn't until it became a Fox affiliate.\n\nUnlike the New World Communications-owned stations that joined Fox around the same timeframe, the Savoy stations, including WVUE, carried Fox's children's programming on weekday mornings and afternoons as well as on Saturday mornings; the network later discontinued the Fox Kids weekday blocks in 2002, with the Saturday morning lineup remaining until its successor 4Kids TV ended in November 2008. Ratings for Fox's programming had increased slightly from when the network was affiliated with WNOL; however, viewership for WVUE's newscasts remained well behind that of WWL-TV and WDSU. The station acquired additional syndicated talk shows to fill certain daytime slots where ABC programming formerly aired.\n\nBeginning under Emmis, WVUE strengthened its syndicated programming inventory, including acquiring the local syndication rights to \"Wheel of Fortune\" and \"Jeopardy!\" as part of a group deal with Emmis' Fox affiliates, a rarity for a Fox station (prior to airing on channel 8, the two shows aired for about two decades on WWL-TV).\n\nWVUE-DT presently broadcasts 57 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 10 hours each weekday and 3½ hours each on Saturdays and Sundays); in regards to the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the highest local newscast output of any television station in the New Orleans market and within the state of Louisiana. WVUE is the only station in the market that airs a local newscast at 5:30 p.m., although it does not run a newscast at 6 p.m. on weeknights. In addition, the station produces the sports discussion program \"The Final Play\", which airs Sundays at 10:30 p.m.\n\nThe station had been an also-ran among the New Orleans market's television news outlets for many years; however, the station hired many well-known talent during the 1960s through the 1980s (some of whom had previously worked at WDSU and WWL-TV) including anchor Alec Gifford, weatherman Nash Roberts and sports anchor Buddy Diliberto. In 1968, Gifford—then the station's news director—hired Furnell Chatman as a general assignment reporter at WVUE, becoming the first African American reporter in the market; Chatman eventually made history as the first African American to anchor a newscast in Louisiana when he was appointed anchor of the station's noon newscast a few years later. In 1976, WVUE hired Lynn Gansar, who within a few years, was elevated from a reporter role to become the station's first female news anchor. On May 31, 1982, WVUE launched a half-hour 5 p.m. newscast called \"Live At Five\"; this program was revamped as \"Neighbors at Five\" during the late 1980s, in which anchors Margaret Dubuisson and Joe Giardina presented the newscast from various locations in New Orleans.\nAfter WVUE became a Fox affiliate in January 1996, the station increased its news programming output from about 15 hours a week to nearly 25 hours, retaining all of its existing newscasts. The station initially retained its noon and 6 p.m. newscasts, but opted air syndicated programming in the 5:30 p.m. half-hour rather than expand its 5 p.m. newscast to a full hour, a move that was atypical of the Big Three stations that switched to Fox during the affiliation switches that occurred between 1994 and 1996. The existing 10 p.m. newscast was moved one hour earlier to 9 p.m. and was expanded to one hour; however, ten months later in October 1996, it was split into separate half-hour newscasts at 9 and 10 p.m., with off-network syndicated sitcoms filling the 9:30 p.m. timeslot. This scheduling for the late evening newscasts continued until 2001, when the weeknight 9 p.m. newscast reverted to an hour-long broadcast, and the 10 p.m. newscast was dropped for a second time due to the lack of a strong program lead-in. Even after the weeknight broadcast expanded to one hour, atypical for most Fox stations that produce their newscasts in-house, the Saturday and Sunday editions of WVUE's 9 p.m. newscast remained a half-hour in length; until those editions were expanded to one hour in 2012, WVUE had been among the largest Fox affiliates by market size to air its prime time newscast in such a fashion.\n\nEven after becoming a Fox affiliate, the station did not carry a newscast on weekday mornings throughout the 1990s; this changed in 2002, when WVUE debuted what was originally a two-hour morning newscast, airing from 6 to 8 a.m. (which by 2005, expanded to three hours with the addition of an 8 a.m. hour of the broadcast). In 2005, WVUE canceled its weeknight 6 p.m. newscast and expanded its 5 p.m. newscast to one hour; this was in concert with the station's acquisition of the popular Sony-distributed game shows \"Jeopardy!\" and \"Wheel of Fortune\", which the station chose to air together in an hour-long block during the 6:00 hour (news-producing stations in the Eastern and Pacific time zones commonly schedule syndicated programs such as \"Jeopardy!\" and \"Wheel\" in the hour before network prime time, 7 to 8 p.m. in those areas, though this is not very common with such stations in the Central and Mountain time zones).\n\nWVUE's news ratings slowly increased throughout the 2000s (particularly following the station's purchase by the Louisiana Media Company). By the middle of the decade, the station overtook WDSU for the #2 position in the local news ratings, placing behind WWL-TV in the 5 p.m. timeslot. The station remained in second place through 2008 and a see-saw period followed. In May 2011, the station again ranked third in the 5 p.m. time period. The station has consistently ranked third among the market's morning and afternoon newscasts with three or more local options since that time, while posting its best ratings at night. The station bests many network prime time shows during the 9 p.m. hour (WVUE's ratings for its prime time newscast outperformed WNOL-TV and WUPL's newscasts—both produced by their respective duopoly partners, WGNO and WWL-TV—in the same timeslots, with both of those stations eventually cancelling those programs outright), and at 10 p.m., WVUE has generally held second place in the market. In recent years, the station's news department has won several Regional Emmy Awards for its news coverage; it also won duPont–Columbia Awards for its breaking news coverage and investigative reporting in 2013 and 2014 and a Peabody Award in 2013 for its investigation into campaign financing in Louisiana. In the November 2018 sweeps period, WVUE bested WDSU, WWL and WGNO in the local news race for the first time in ratings history. Aside from the Noon newscast, WVUE placed first in the ratings in every time period in which it broadcast a local newscast.\n\nOn April 29, 2007, WVUE became the first television station in New Orleans to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. In January 2010, WVUE underwent a major production upgrade that included the transition of field video to high definition, and the introduction of the first HD-based weather system in the New Orleans market. As of October 2014, WVUE and now WWL-TV are the only New Orleans area stations to broadcast its local newscasts in high definition; this is in contrast to WDSU and WGNO, all of which broadcast their newscasts in widescreen standard definition.\n\nOn February 1, 2010, WVUE expanded its weekday morning newscast to four hours, with the addition of an hour-long weather-based newscast at 5:00 a.m. titled \"Fox 8 Morning Call\", the program was replaced in 2012 by a traditional local newscast during that hour. The station restored a 10:00 p.m. newscast to its schedule after nine years on that same date; initially only airing as a test run, it was added to the schedule full-time on May 5, 2010, after former WWL-TV anchor Lee Zurik joined channel 8 as an anchor and investigative reporter. The 10:00 p.m. newscast later expanded to weekend evenings in July 2010; as a result, WVUE became one of about a dozen Fox stations nationwide with a newscast in the traditional late news timeslot that airs seven nights a week. On May 23, 2011, channel 8 debuted an hour-long midday newscast that airs Monday through Fridays at noon. This was followed on September 12 of that year, with the debut of an hour-long newscast at 4:00 p.m.\n\nIn the summer of 2012, WVUE entered into a content partnership with \"The Times-Picayune\" in which the station and newspaper would collaborate on sports coverage. On June 27, 2013, this partnership was expanded to include news content (including collaborations on investigative reports and entertainment stories), breaking news updates and analysis occasionally provided by \"Times-Picayune\" reporters on WVUE's newscasts and the sharing of photo and video content; WVUE also began to provide weather forecasts for the newspaper and its companion website, NOLA.com. On April 21, 2014, WVUE began airing its weekday morning newscast at 4:30 a.m., expanding the program to 4½ hours. On September 10, 2018, WVUE debuted a 9:00 a.m. newscast.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2252348", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2252348", "title": "Thomas L. Rosser", "text": "Thomas L. Rosser\n\nThomas Lafayette \"Tex\" Rosser (October 15, 1836 – March 29, 1910) was a Confederate major general during the American Civil War, and later a railroad construction engineer and in 1898 a brigadier general of volunteers in the United States Army during the Spanish–American War. A favorite of J.E.B. Stuart, he was noted for his daring cavalry raids, efficiency in handling combat troops, and tactical brilliance. \n\nRosser was born on a farm called \"Catalpa Hill\", in Campbell County, Virginia, the son of John and Martha Melvina (Johnson) Rosser. In 1849, the family relocated to a farm in Panola County, Texas, some forty miles west of Shreveport, Louisiana. The 13-year-old Tom Rosser led the wagon train bearing his mother and younger siblings westward, as business considerations compelled his father to remain in Virginia for a short time. Texas Congressman Lemuel D. Evans appointed Rosser to the United States Military Academy in 1856. However, Rosser did not complete the required five-year course of study, as Rosser, a supporter of Texas secession, resigned when Texas left the Union on April 22, 1861 two weeks before the scheduled graduation. Rosser traveled to Montgomery, Alabama, to enlist in the Confederate States Army. Thomas Rosser's roommate at the academy, George Armstrong Custer was a close friend and despite being on opposing sides this friendship continued both during and after the Civil War ended. He was known for his \"hit and run\" raids.\n\n Rosser was commissioned a first lieutenant and became an instructor to the famed \"Washington Artillery\" of New Orleans. He commanded its Second Company at the First Battle of Manassas in July 1861. He was noted for shooting down one of George B. McClellan's observation balloons, a feat that won him promotion to captain. He commanded his battery during the Seven Days Battles of the Peninsula Campaign, and was severely wounded at Mechanicsville. Rosser was promoted to lieutenant colonel of artillery, and a few days later to colonel of the 5th Virginia Cavalry.\n\nHe commanded the advance of J.E.B. Stuart's expedition to Catlett's Station, and was notable in the Second Battle of Manassas, where captured Union commander John Pope's orderly and horses. During the fighting at Crampton's Gap at the Battle of South Mountain, his cavalry delayed the advance of William B. Franklin's VI Corps with help from John Pelham's artillery. At Antietam, his men screened Robert E. Lee's left flank. He temporarily assumed command of Fitzhugh Lee's brigade during the subsequent fighting against Alfred Pleasonton.\n\nHe was again badly wounded at the Battle of Kelly's Ford, where \"the gallant\" Pelham was killed. Rosser was disabled until the Gettysburg Campaign, where he commanded his regiment in the fighting at Hanover and the East Cavalry Field at Gettysburg. He was promoted to brigadier general of the \"Laurel Brigade,\" which had gained fame under Turner Ashby. He was distinguished again in the 1864 Overland Campaign, driving back a large force of Union cavalry and artillery at the Battle of the Wilderness.\n\nRosser was yet again wounded at Trevilian Station, where his brigade captured a number of prisoners from former West Point classmate and close personal friend George Armstrong Custer. His brigade later gallantly fought against Philip Sheridan in the Shenandoah Valley, and he efficiently commanded Fitzhugh Lee's division at Cedar Creek. A rare defeat where Custer overran Rosser's troops at the Battle of Tom's Brook allowed Custer to repay Rosser for Trevilian Station. For no tactical reason, Custer chased Rosser's troops for over 10 miles and the action became known as the \"Woodstock Races\" in Union accounts. Custer had also captured Rosser's private wardrobe wagon at Tom's Brook, and Rosser immediately messaged him.\n\nDear FannyYou may have made me take a few steps back today, but I will be even with you tomorrow. Please accept my good wishes and this little gift—a pair of your draws captured at Trevillian Station.Tex\n\nCuster shipped Rosser's gold-laced Confederate grey coat to his wife with a reply.\n\nDear friendThanks for setting me up in so many new things, but would you please direct your tailor to make the coat tails of your next uniform a trifle shorter.Best regards G.A.C.\n\nRosser became known in the Southern press as the \"Saviour of the Valley,\" and was promoted to major general in November 1864. He conducted a successful raid on New Creek, West Virginia, taking hundreds of prisoners and seizing much need quantities of supplies. In January 1865, he took 300 men, crossed the mountains in deep snow and bitter cold, and surprised and captured two infantry regiments in their works at Beverly, West Virginia, taking 580 prisoners. Most of the men in Rosser's command were recruits from West Virginia.\n\nRosser commanded a cavalry division during the Siege of Petersburg in the spring, fighting near Five Forks. It was here that Rosser hosted the \"infamous\" shad bake (fish feast) north of the battle lines preceding and during the primary Federal assault. Guests at this small affair included George Pickett and Fitzhugh Lee. Shelby Foote states that \"Pickett only made it back to his division after over half his troops had been shot or captured..\". It is said that Lee never forgave Pickett for his absence from his post when the Federals broke the Confederate lines and carried the day at Five Forks.\n\nRosser was conspicuous during the Appomattox Campaign, capturing a Union general, John Irvin Gregg, and rescuing a wagon train near Farmville. He led a daring early morning charge at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865, and escaped with his command as Lee surrendered the bulk of the Army of Northern Virginia. Under orders from the secretary of war, he began reorganizing the scattered remnants of Lee's army in a vain attempt to join Joseph E. Johnston's army in North Carolina. However, he surrendered at Staunton, Virginia, on May 4 and was paroled shortly afterwards.\n\nRosser was superintendent of the National Express Company, working for fellow ex-Confederate general Joe Johnston. He resigned to become assistant engineer during the construction of the Pittsburgh & Connellsville Railroad. He became chief engineer of the eastern division of the Northern Pacific Railroad. Later he was chief engineer of the Canadian Pacific. In 1886, he bought a plantation near Charlottesville, Virginia, and became a gentleman farmer. On June 10, 1898, President William McKinley appointed Rosser a brigadier general of United States volunteers during the Spanish–American War. His first task was training young cavalry recruits in a camp near the old Civil War battlefield of Chickamauga in northern Georgia. He was honorably discharged on October 31, 1898, and returned home. He died at Charlottesville and is buried at Riverview Cemetery, Charlottesville.\n\nRosser Avenue in Brandon, Manitoba is named in his honor, as well as the village and Rural Municipality of Rosser near Winnipeg. There is also a Rosser Avenue in Bismarck, North Dakota. This was platted before Custer's arrival in the area, and so likely is related to Rosser's time with the railroad (Northern Pacific) rather than his friendship with Custer, or his military career. There is also a Rosser Avenue in Waynesboro, Virginia. In Charlottesville, Virginia there are both Rosser Avenue and Rosser Lane.\n\n\n"}

It ruled the local affairs of the city and its neighbourhood, which previously were a Venetian exclave in the Duchy of Milan. The municipality entered then into the Cisalpine Republic in July 1797.\n\nThe city of Crema and its surroundings had been annexed by the Republic of Venice since 1449, and had been ruled by a Venetian podestà for more than three centuries. On 28 March 1797 a troop of French dragoons entered and occupied the city (without facing any resistance) and arrested the last Venetian magistrate, the duke Zan Battista Contarini.\n\nA new municipality was formed to control the city, which was composed mostly of small landowners and local nobles. They proclaimed then the new Republic of Crema, that had the control of the town and the territories now belonging to the province of Crema.\n\nThe small revolutionary republic had a short life. Three months later, on 29 July 1797, its territory merged with the Cisalpine Republic and legally annexed to it on the base of the Treaty of Campo Formio, becoming part of the Adda department and later on the Alto Po one.\n\nNowadays the territory of the former Republic of Crema goes from the municipality of Spino d'Adda (east) to the Castelleone one.\n\n"}
{"id": "2252351", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2252351", "title": "Markel Corporation", "text": "Markel Corporation\n\nMarkel Corporation is a holding company for insurance, reinsurance, and investment operations around the world. Headquartered in Richmond, Virginia and founded in 1930, Markel reports its ongoing underwriting operations in three segments, and products originate from three insurance divisions and one reinsurance division. Through Markel Ventures, they allocate capital to invest in opportunities outside of insurance.\n\nCompany founder Samuel A. Markel formed the Mutual Casualty Association and established the Mutual Casualty Company in Norfolk, Virginia. The company headquarters later moved to Richmond, Virginia. Sam Markel's four sons, Lewis, Irvin, Stanley, and Milton, joined the growing business in the 1930s, and Markel Service, Inc. was created. During this time, Markel was actively involved in efforts to develop safety and other standards aimed at legitimizing the growing bus and trucking industries. Markel also assisted in passing the National Motor Carrier Act of 1935.\n\nBy the 1940s, Markel Service, Inc. earned a national following and developed a reputation for industry-leading claims adjusting and safety engineering. American Fidelity & Casualty, a sister company covering fleets of trucks and buses, also became the largest insurer of these risks in the USA. In 1980, the company became an insurance carrier when Essex Insurance Company was incorporated and licensed to write excess and surplus lines business. \n\nIn 1986, the Markel Corporation was listed on the NASDAQ exchange, with an IPO offered at $8.33 per share. The company's trading was moved to the NYSE in 1997. Markel gained access to specialty international markets in 2000, when Terra Nova Holdings, Ltd. was acquired and the London office opened. Branch offices later opened in the UK, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Canada. With a \"permanent capital\" investing approach, Markel Ventures acquired AMF Bakery Systems in 2005 and continued to acquire other varied and scalable businesses. With the $3.1 billion acquisition of Alterra Capital Holdings Limited, Markel added two additional insurance divisions, Markel Global and Markel Reinsurance. \n\nIn 2015, Markel acquired Bermuda-based CATCo, a specialist investment management business; and Markel Ventures announced a majority interest in CapTech.\n\nToday, the company is led by Executive Chairman Alan I. Kirshner, who is one of the authors of the Markel Style.\n\nBeginning in 1930, Markel established Markel Service, a separate company to handle direct and reinsurance of AF&C.\n\nIn 1951, the company expanded into Canada by founding Markel Service Canada, Ltd., headquartered in Toronto, Ontario.\n\nIn 1959, the national claims division of AF&C became National Claims Service, an independent adjuster that could be contracted by other insurance firms. The Safety Engineering Division also began offering services to other firms.\n\nThe company later expanded beyond truck and bus companies, led by the third generation of Markels: Anthony, Steve, and Gary.\n\nIn 1980, the company founded Essex Insurance Company in Delaware. Essex began as a property insurance company in White Bear Lake, Minnesota, but later moved to Richmond, Virginia.\n\nIn 1985, Prem Watsa took control of Markel Financial Holdings, a Canadian-based trucking insurance company.

{"id": "2252356", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2252356", "title": "Steinheim skull", "text": "Steinheim skull\n\nThe Steinheim skull is a fossilized skull of a \"Homo heidelbergensis\" found on 24 July 1933 near Steinheim an der Murr, Germany.\nIt is estimated to be between 250,000 and 350,000 years old. The skull is slightly flattened and has a cranial capacity between 950 and 1280 cc. Sometimes referred to as \"Homo steinheimensis\" in older literature, the original fossil is housed in the State Museum of Natural History in Stuttgart, Germany. Some believe that the Steinheim skull may have belonged to an adult female due to its gracile nature.\n\nThe \"primitive man of Steinheim\" is a single find. The designation \"Steinheim skull\" can be seen as a reference to the location of the fossil, but in no way identifies with a certain taxon. The skull shows characteristics of both \"H. heidelbergensis\" and Neanderthals. It is therefore classified by most paleoanthropologists to \"H. heidelbergensis\" and is believed to be a transitional form of \"H. heidelbergensis\" to Neanderthals. This has sometimes been referred to as \"pre-Neanderthal.” The inner ear of the fossil has a feature in which Neanderthals and \"H. sapiens\" differ. The location of the semicircular canals of the inner ear in the temporal bone of the skull base is similar to the situation in Neanderthals, while the semicircular canals of the older \"H. erectus,\" as with \"H. sapiens\", are closer.\n\nUntil the late 1980s, the fossil was sometimes referred to as \"H. sapiens steinheimensis\". During this time Neanderthals were also referred to as \"H. sapiens neanderthalensis\". Today, however, many paleoanthropologists assume that Neanderthals and humans emerged independently from a common ancestor, usually this is called \"H. heidelbergensis,\" and therefore that two distinct species are to be considered: \"H. neanderthalensis\" and \"H. sapiens.\"\n\nPrior to discovery of the Steinheim skull in the gravel pit, many objects such as bones of elephants, rhinos and wild horses had been unearthed. Therefore, the archaeologists excavating the\nsite were already sensitized to possible skeletal remains in the quarry. Fritz Berckhemer traveled on the same day of the skull's discovery and reviewed the still hidden skull in the wall. The next day, together with Max Bock, he began the careful excavation. It was clear, on the basis of the shape and dimensions of the skull, that it was not a monkey, as had initially been suspected. It turned out to be a human skull from the Pleistocene. The skull was roughly cleaned, hardened and plastered so it would arrive safe and sound in the Museum of Natural History.\n\nThe find in Steinheim turned up no other artifacts. There were no artifacts from the people as well as no other skeletal remains found. There were also no tools such as stone tools or bone implements discovered at the site. It can be assumed, however, that the hominin would have been capable of creating tools and using them for different purposes. For example, evidence of this can be found around the same time frame of “Swanscombe man\", where they found some fist wedges from the Acheulean tool culture. l\n\nThe investigations completed at the Eberhard Karls University of Tuebingen in 2003 by Alfred Czarnetzki, Carsten M. Pusch and Erwin Schwaderer, showed that the owner of the skull suffered from a meningioma, which is an arachnoid tumor. Meningiomas are a diverse set of tumors that arise from the meninges, which is the membranous layers surrounding the central nervous system.\n\nThe slow-growing tumor had a size of 51 mm × 43 mm × 25 mm and a volume of . It is believed that this tumor may have caused headaches. It is also possible that no neurological deficiencies were suffered, due to the slow growing nature of meningiomas. Whether the tumor should be considered the cause of death cannot be determined from the remains. Having the rest of the skeleton would be necessary for further investigation into a possible cause of death. Meningiomas\nare very rare with roughly 2 out of 100,000 causing symptoms, so finding evidence of one in such ancient remains is a very exciting discovery. It is the earliest evidence of a meningioma tumor on record.\n\n"}
{"id": "2252358", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2252358", "title": "WISH-TV", "text": "WISH-TV\n\nWISH-TV, virtual channel 8 (VHF digital channel 9), is a CW-affiliated television station licensed to Indianapolis, Indiana, United States. The station is owned by Circle City Broadcasting, as part of a duopoly with Marion-licensed MyNetworkTV affiliate WNDY-TV (channel 23); it is also sister to Indianapolis-licensed low-powered, Class A getTV affiliate WIIH-CD (channel 17). The three stations share studios on North Meridian Street (at the north end of the Television Row section) on the near north side of Indianapolis and transmitter facilities on Walnut Drive in the Augusta section of the city's northwest side (near Meridian Hills).\n\nOn cable, WISH-TV is available on Charter Spectrum channel 3, Comcast Xfinity channel 7 and AT&T U-verse channel 8.\n\nThe station first signed on the air on July 1, 1954 at 6:00 p.m. Founded by C. Bruce McConnell—owner of WISH radio (1310 AM, now WTLC)—it was the third television station to sign on in the Indianapolis market, after WFBM-TV (channel 6, now WRTV), which signed on in May 1949 and Bloomington-licensed WTTV (channel 10, now on channel 4), which signed on six months later in November 1949. WISH-TV originally operated as a primary ABC affiliate with a secondary affiliation with DuMont Television Network and NBC. WISH-TV originally transmitted its signal from a tower it shared with WISH radio; the following year, the station constructed a transmitter tower, which allowed the station to improve its signal coverage in the market.\n\nIn 1956, McConnell sold the station to the Indiana Broadcasting Company, the broadcasting subsidiary of J.H. Whitney & Company and owners of WANE-TV in Fort Wayne. The new owners persuaded CBS to move its programming to channel 8, taking that affiliation from WFBM. Conversely that same year, WISH-TV lost the ABC affiliation to WTTV; this resulted in WLBC-TV, channel 49 in Muncie (whose allocation is now occupied by PBS member station WIPB) serving as the \"de facto\" ABC affiliate for the northern part of the market as WTTV's signal did not extend very far north outside of Indianapolis's northern suburbs as its transmitter was located farther south than the market's other stations. Also in 1956, WISH became one of the first television stations in the United States to install a videotape machine.\nIndiana Broadcasting became the Corinthian Broadcasting Corporation in 1957, with WISH-TV serving as the company's flagship station. From 1958 to 1959, it was an affiliate of the NTA Film Network. Corinthian merged with Dun & Bradstreet in 1971. Dun & Bradstreet sold its entire broadcasting unit to the Belo Corporation in February 1984. However, the merger put Belo two stations over the television ownership limits that the Federal Communications Commission had in effect at the time. As a result, the company sold WISH-TV and WANE to LIN Broadcasting (the predecessor of LIN Media) the following month in March 1984. LIN was headquartered in Indianapolis for many years, with WISH-TV serving as that company's flagship television property; the company eventually moved its headquarters to Providence, Rhode Island in the late 1990s, resulting in WPRI-TV replacing WISH as LIN's flagship station. LIN later acquired low-power independent station W11BV (channel 11, now WIIH-CD channel 17) in 1992. In 1995, WISH-TV relocated its transmitter to a new tower built in the Augusta section of Indianapolis.\n\nWISH-TV signed on its digital signal on VHF channel 9 on December 17, 1998; two days later on December 19, the station broadcast its first program in high definition when it broadcast an NFL game telecast in the format. In 2002, WISH-TV began handling the master control operations of WANE-TV and fellow sister station WLFI-TV in Lafayette. The hub expanded to include the Buffalo duopoly of WIVB-TV and WNLO in October, with other LIN-owned stations gradually being added to the WISH hub by the summer of 2003.\n\nOn February 10, 2005, the Paramount Stations Group subsidiary of Viacom sold UPN affiliate WNDY-TV (channel 23, now a MyNetworkTV affiliate) as well as its Columbus, Ohio sister station WWHO to LIN TV for $85 million, creating a duopoly with WISH-TV when the sale was finalized that spring. On May 18, 2007, the LIN TV Corporation announced that it was exploring strategic alternatives that could have resulted in the sale of the company.\n\nOn September 15, 2008, LIN and Time Warner Cable entered into an impasse during negotiations to renew retransmission consent deals for some of the group's television stations. Bright House Networks, one of two major cable providers serving Indianapolis, negotiates retransmission consent contracts through Time Warner Cable. LIN TV requested compensation for carriage of its stations in a manner similar to the deals that cable networks have with pay television providers, as other broadcast station owners began to seek compensation from cable and satellite providers for their programming. The carriage agreement with Bright House expired on October 2. By 12:35 a.m. on October 3, LIN's television stations were replaced on Time Warner Cable systems in markets where the group owns stations and where either provider operates systems with programming from other cable channels. LIN's stations (with the exception of WIIH-CA) were restored 26 days later on October 29 through a new carriage agreement reached between Time Warner Cable and LIN TV.\n\nThe station shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 8, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal continued to broadcast on its pre-transition VHF channel 9. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 8.\n\nOn August 7, 2009, WISH-TV began operating a Mobile DTV feed of subchannel 8.1, which originally was only accessible via an app for BlackBerry devices.\n\nOn January 29, 2010, LIN TV filed an application to the FCC to operate a digital fill-in translator on UHF channel 17, an allotment that was previously occupied by the analog signal of Class A sister station WIIH-CA; the FCC granted a construction permit to build the translator's transmitter facilities on June 16. The translator, which shares the same transmitter facility as WISH's main signal in the Augusta section of Indianapolis and began operating on January 13, 2011, serves parts of Indianapolis that lost signal coverage after the 2009 digital transition. The translator is mapped as virtual channel 8, which results in PSIP channel duplication while tuning sequentially on digital tuners in areas that are able to receive both signals, as the translator simulcasts WISH-TV's main channel and its two digital subchannels. As mentioned above, in late March 2015, a simulcast of WISH's main signal was added via WNDY-DT3.\n\nOn March 21, 2014, Media General announced that it would buy LIN Media in a $1.6 billion deal, described as a \"merger.\" The merger was completed on December 19.\n\nOn August 11, 2014, Tribune Broadcasting announced that CW affiliate WTTV would become the market's CBS affiliate on January 1, 2015, as part of an agreement that also renewed the CBS affiliations on Tribune-owned stations in five other markets. The deal, which resulted in the end of WISH-TV's 58-year relationship with CBS, was reportedly struck as a result of WISH station management balking at the network's demands for sharing of retransmission consent revenue from its affiliates. This marked the second time in Indianapolis television history that WTTV took an affiliation from WISH, the first being ABC in 1956.\n\nAs the other major broadcast networks had existing affiliation deals with other area stations (WRTV's ABC affiliation was up for renewal around this time, though the E. W. Scripps Company reached a deal to allow WRTV and nine of the company's other stations to remain with ABC the day prior to the announcement), WISH announced on December 11, 2014 that it would become an independent station upon losing CBS, filling timeslots previously occupied by network shows with additional newscasts and an expanded inventory of syndicated talk shows, newsmagazines and sitcoms, including some shows relocated from sister station WNDY-TV to make up for the loss of CBS daytime and late-night programs on channel 8's schedule and a national news program from TouchVision (the latter of which was later replaced with an additional half-hour of the station's morning newscast, \"24-Hour News 8's Daybreak\", on July 13, 2015) to serve as a replacement for the \"CBS Morning News\".\n\nHowever, on December 22, 2014, Tribune announced that it would sell the market's CW affiliation to Media General—the deal occurred three days after the completion of the company's merger with LIN. As a result, WISH instead became a CW affiliate, in effect switching affiliations with WTTV and preventing a situation in which The CW, which WTTV originally planned on carrying over its second digital subchannel (which had previously been affiliated with This TV prior to December 2014), would be relegated to the lower digital subchannel tier on local cable systems and probable subjection to non-carriage by satellite providers for months until carriage agreements were struck. The loss of WISH's CBS affiliation also affected the Media General-LIN merger, with the purchase price being lowered by $110 million in stock, though no other factors were affected.\n\nMedia General signed an agreement with Sony Pictures Entertainment to affiliate several of its stations with GetTV. WISH added the network on its .2 subchannel on February 1, 2016.\n\nAfter a failed bid for Media General to merge with Meredith Corporation, Nexstar Broadcasting acquired Media General in January 2017. The WISH-WNDY duopoly gained new sister stations in nearby markets within Indiana: the Evansville virtual duopoly of ABC affiliate WEHT and fellow CW affiliate WTVW, and the Terre Haute virtual duopoly of NBC affiliate WTWO and ABC affiliate WAWV-TV. CBS affiliate WANE-TV in Fort Wayne was the only existing sister station of WISH and WNDY that became part of the combined group, as Media General and Nexstar each sold certain Indiana stations they already owned (Nexstar's Fox affiliate WFFT-TV in Fort Wayne and Media General's two other Indiana-based CBS affiliates, WTHI-TV in Terre Haute and WLFI-TV in Lafayette to Heartland Media, and Nexstar's WEVV-TV in Evansville to Bayou City Broadcasting) to alleviate conflicts with FCC ownership rules.\n\nIn late March 2015, Media General added a 1080i HD simulcast feed of WISH's main signal on the 23.3 subchannel of WNDY-TV, mainly for the convenience of over-the-air viewers, especially those unable to receive WISH's VHF channel 9 signal due to signal limitations by way of their geographic location in proximity to the transmitter and or a lack of an antenna able to properly receive VHF signals. In January 2016, the station converted the subchannel from a 24-hour feed of its Doppler radar into an affiliate of the Justice Network.\n\nOn December 3, 2018, Nexstar announced it would acquire the assets of Chicago-based Tribune Media—which has owned Fox affiliate WXIN (channel 59) since July 1996 and CBS affiliate WTTV since July 2002—for $6.4 billion in cash and debt. Due to FCC ownership rules, Nexstar could not retain both duopolies. On April 8, 2019, it was announced that Circle City Broadcasting (owned by DuJuan McCoy of Indianapolis, the principal owner of the aforementioned Bayou City Broadcasting) would acquire WISH and WNDY for $42.5 million. The sale was completed on September 19, 2019. \n\nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\nWISH-TV originally launched digital subchannel 8.2 in 2005 as an over-the-air feed of its 24-hour weather service, LWS (or \"Local Weather Station\"); formatted similarly to the now-defunct SkyTrak Weather Network service previously operated by WTHR and its low-power sister station WALV-CD (channel 46), the service also began to be simulcast on low-power sister station WIIH-CA on January 1, 2009, after that station lost its Univision affiliation; WIIH-CA dropped the service when it was converted into a fill-in translator of WISH-TV in January 2011. Until February 2016, Channel 8 carried a half-hour simulcast of the LWS service on its primary channel on Friday nights/early Saturday mornings.\n\nIn its later years as a CBS affiliate, WISH-TV aired most Indianapolis Colts regular season games as well as any playoff games involving the team through CBS, via the network's broadcast rights to the NFL's American Football Conference. The move of Colts games to WISH-TV when CBS acquired the rights to the AFC in 1998 coincided with the debut of rookie quarterback Peyton Manning, as well as the station's coverage of the Colts' victory in Super Bowl XLI. WISH-TV also aired Indiana Pacers games from their absorption into the NBA from 1976 until 1990, through CBS' NBA broadcast contract. The station provided local coverage of the 1987 Pan-American Games, which were held in Indianapolis.\n\nAs a result of WISH swapping its CBS affiliation with CW affiliate WTTV in January 2015, the station's status as the unofficial \"home\" station of the Colts ended after the 2014 NFL regular season. Consequently, it no longer aired any Colts related programming after the 2014 season (except for \"Countdown to Kickoff\" and possibly \"Huddle Up Indy\"), nor were WISH and WNDY affiliated with the Colts. Colts games began to air on WTTV on January 4, 2015, when the Colts defeated the Cincinnati Bengals in the first round of the NFL playoffs. The coach's show and \"Colts Up Close\" moved to WTTV and its sister Fox affiliate WXIN (channel 59) for the 2015 NFL season.\n\nAfter losing CBS, WISH gradually cobbled together agreements to restore sports events onto the station's schedule in order to make up for both the loss of sports coverage provided by CBS as well as the absence of such content from The CW's schedule. First on February 17, 2015, WISH signed a two-year agreement with the Indy Eleven to carry home matches from the North American Soccer League team during the 2015 and 2016 seasons; WISH replaced sister station WNDY as the Eleven's local television broadcaster, as that station carried the team's games during its inaugural 2014 season. All game telecasts and a half-hour post-game show that follows each game are produced under an outsourcing agreement with Indianapolis-based video production firm WebStream Sports. The first Indy Eleven game to air on WISH was the April 11 home season opener with the New York Cosmos.\n\nOn March 20, 2015, Media General announced that WISH and WNDY would become part of the Chicago Cubs and White Sox broadcast television networks and carry many of the games the teams broadcast locally in the Chicago market through ABC owned-and-operated station WLS-TV, then-fellow CW affiliate WGN-TV and new CW affiliate WPWR-TV (excluding those broadcast by the cable/satellite-only Comcast SportsNet Chicago). WISH carries a Sunday-only schedule of games due to program preemption restrictions within its CW affiliation contract, with WNDY airing the remainder of the weekday game schedule and a few Sunday games. The deal for carriage of the games in Indianapolis was required after Tribune Broadcasting discontinued airing sports events involving Chicago-area teams over its WGN America cable channel at the end of 2014. Both of Chicago's Major League Baseball teams claim Indianapolis as part of their broadcasting territories, sharing the market with the Cincinnati Reds, which have games that originate on Fox Sports Ohio carried by sister network Fox Sports Indiana.\n\nOn June 30, 2015, WISH reached an agreement to carry Atlantic Coast Conference college football and basketball games produced by Raycom Sports (via the syndicator's ACC Network service) effective with the 2015–16 ACC football season, as Indianapolis is in the ACC market covered by the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. The first ACC game to air on the station through this deal was the September 5 game between the Wofford Terriers and Clemson Tigers. On October 6, Media General announced that WISH would carry NHL games involving the Chicago Blackhawks produced by WGN-TV, with an initial slate of 19 Saturday and Sunday games during the 2015–16 season starting with the team's October 10 game against the New York Islanders. This marked the first time outside of Canadian cable distribution quirks involving WGN-TV that WGN's Blackhawks coverage aired outside the Chicago market (WGN America never carried Blackhawks telecasts).\n\nWISH-TV presently broadcasts 76 hours of locally produced newscasts and programs each week (with 12½ hours each weekday, six hours on Saturdays and 7½ hours on Sundays); weekdays include \"Indy Style\" from 10 to 11 a.m. and Sundays include \"Pet Pals TV\" at 10 a.m. followed by \"Great Day TV with Patty Spitler\" at 10:30 a.m. and \"Sportslocker\" at 10:30 p.m. and \"Indy Sports Tonight\", which airs every night at 11:15 p.m.\n\nIn 1963, WISH-TV became the first television station in the market to provide extensive live coverage of a major local news event, when it covered the deadly explosion at the Fairgrounds Coliseum. WISH-TV's newscasts were the highest-rated in the Indianapolis market from the mid-1980s until WTHR overtook it for the #1 position in 2002. The station's ratings success was largely attributed to the longevity of most of its news staff, some of whom have been at the station for over 20 years. Mike Ahern was the station's main weeknight news anchor as well as the de facto face of its newsroom for more than 30 years (the longest tenure of anyone in Indianapolis television history); he joined channel 8 as a reporter in 1967 and was promoted to lead anchor in 1974, where he remained until his retirement from the anchor chair on December 1, 2004 (Ahern later hosted sister station WNDY's now-cancelled interview program \"One on One\"). Debby Knox joined Ahern as co-anchor on the weeknight newscasts in 1980 and remained with the station until she retired on November 26, 2013. Stan Wood served as the station's main weather forecaster from the 1960s until 1991, while Patty Spitler served as anchor of the noon newscast and entertainment reporter from 1982 to 2004. Lee Giles, who left the station in 2004, was one of the longest-tenured news directors in local broadcasting.\n\nFor a time during the 1990s, WISH-TV advertised that \"more people in Central Indiana get their local news from \"24-Hour News 8\" than from any other source\" at the close of many of its newscasts and in promos for its newscasts. The station's local newscasts are currently at a distant second place behind WTHR in most timeslots, except during the 5 to 6:30 p.m. period on weeknights, when both stations maintain a much tighter viewership margin. However, due to the strength of CBS' prime time lineup in the 2000s and 2010s (as well as the fact its late news served the lead-in for Indianapolis native David Letterman's late night talk show on the network, the \"Late Show\"), WISH regained the lead in the 11:00 p.m. slot. The station's \"I-Team 8\" investigative reports have earned the station numerous journalism awards, including Regional Emmy, Peabody and Edward R. Murrow Awards (the station was awarded the latter in 1998 and 2006). In 2008, the Indiana Associated Press Broadcast Association honored WISH-TV with the \"Outstanding News Operation\" and \"Outstanding Weather Operation\" designations.\n\nIn 1990, WISH-TV implemented the \"24-Hour News Source\" concept that was originally developed that year by WEWS-TV in Cleveland; the format, which began spreading to other television stations nationwide around that timeframe, involves the production of 30-second news updates that air at or near the top of every hour during local commercial break inserts – even during primetime network and overnight programming – in addition to the station's long-form newscasts in regularly scheduled timeslots. The station continues to utilize the format to this day (which is reinforced in the branding that the station has used for its news programming off-and-on since 1990, \"24-Hour News 8\", and all but one of the varying news slogans it had used from 1990 to 2014), even as stations elsewhere had discontinued the hourly update format by the early 2000s. However, as of June 4, 2018, WISH-TV has dropped the \"24-Hour\" moniker from its newscast name (the moniker part of its slogan has been dropped for years). Now, as of June 2018, Grand Rapids, Michigan sister station WOOD-TV (which still brands its newscasts as \"24-Hour News 8\") and KCRG-TV in Cedar Rapids, Iowa (which is the only station left to use the \"24-Hour News Source\" as its slogan) are the only remaining U.S. television stations that still utilize the \"24-Hour News Source\" concept in some form.\n\nFor many years, the news themes that WISH-TV had commissioned have incorporated components (including the eight-note musical signature) from the song \"Back Home Again in Indiana\"; these include two custom packages by Stephen Arnold Music – \"Newsleader\" (used from 1991 to 1997) and the \"WISH-TV News Music Package,\" a customized version of Arnold's \"Counterpoint\" package (used from 1997 to 2004) – and an alteration of the V.3 package from 615 Music's \"In-Sink\" (used from 2004 to 2012). The 615-composed custom package \"A New Wish,\" introduced on September 5, 2012, was the first theme used by the station in 21 years to omit compositional ties to \"Back Home Again in Indiana\". As of June 4, 2018, WISH-TV has returned to using the \"In-Sink\" news music package containing the \"Back Home Again in Indiana\" melody. On February 28, 2005, shortly after LIN TV announced its purchase of channel 23, WISH-TV took over production of WNDY's 10 p.m. newscast from WTHR, which had produced the program from its inception on March 16, 1996; this partnership expanded to include an hour-long extension of WISH's weekday morning newscast at 7 a.m., which debuted on January 5, 2009.\n\nOn September 8, 2008, WISH-TV became the second television station in Indiana to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition; the WNDY newscasts were included in the upgrade. On September 9, 2013, WISH-TV added a half-hour to its weekday morning newscast at 4:30 a.m., becoming the last English-language news-producing station in the market to expand its morning newscast to a pre-5 a.m. timeslot (WTHR had an eight-year head start, expanding its morning newscast into the 4:30 slot in 2005; that station was later joined by WXIN in 2009 and WRTV in 2010. WTTV became the last station in the market, again, to air a pre-5 a.m. timeslot when their news operation debuted in 2015).\n\nWhen it became an affiliate of The CW on January 1, 2015, WISH-TV became one of three CW affiliates in the Eastern Time Zone (the others being WPIX in New York City and WCCB in Charlotte) with a fully functioning independent news department. It expanded its news programming by 20 hours (increasing its weekly total from 34 to 54 hours a week). Most existing newscasts were retained, though the 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. newscasts it produced for WNDY moved to channel 8 (the former of which is part of an expansion of \"Daybreak\" that extended the weekday edition of the program by two hours and the weekend editions by one), while the noon newscast expanded to one hour and a 6:30 p.m. newscast on weeknights was added. The weekend 6:00 and 10:00 p.m. newscasts were also shortened to a half-hour, with the \"Sports Locker\" being moved to bookending the latter and the 11:00 p.m. news on Sunday nights, and a new sports program (\"Indy Sports Tonight\") taking up 15 minutes of the 11:00 p.m. news.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2252364", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2252364", "title": "Vishvakarman", "text": "Vishvakarman\n\nVishvakarman (, ; lit. \"all creating\") is the Personification of ultimate reality and deity of the creative power. He is believed to be one of the ancient architect or engineer who created and taught building of ancient monuments, architectures in Bharat, now India. According to the \"Rigveda\" It/He is considered to be the architect, divine engineer of universe from before the advent of time.\n\nVishvakarman was originally used as an epithet for any supreme god and as an attribute of Indra and the Sun. The name Vishvakarman occurs five times in the tenth book of the Rigveda. The two hymns of the Rigveda identify Vishvakarman as all-seeing, and having eyes, faces, arms and feet on every side and also has wings. Brahma, the later god of creation, who is four-faced and four-armed resembles him in these aspects. He is represented as being the source of all prosperity, as swift as thought and titled a seer, priest, lord of speech.\n\nThe later parts of the Rigveda reveals efforts to find a satisfactory answer to the mysteries regarding the origin of the universe, the creation hymns present in these parts of the Rigveda mention individual creator gods as opposed to the collection of gods and their chiefs (Indra, Varuna, Agni, etc.) creating the world.\n\nVishwakarma is visualised as the \"Ultimate Reality\" (later developed as Brahman) in the \"Rig Veda\", from whose navel all visible things Hiranyagarbha emanate. The same imagery is seen in Yajurveda\" purusha sukta\", in which the divine smith Tvastar emerges from Vishwakarma. In the later puranic period this concept paved the way to the imagery of Brahma, Vishnu and Sadasiva. He is also sometimes referred to as Tvastar.\n\nIn the Vedic period the term first appeared as an epithet of Indra, Surya, and Agni. In that time the later developed creator concept of Brahma might have been intertwined with the concept of \"Vastospati\" and \"Bṛhaspati\", or Brahmanaspathi In the last phase of vedic period and during the growth of monotheism( but most of clues from Śrīmad bhāgavatam and Śrīmad bhagavadgītā clears that actually the supreme truth can be realised as a person and so impersonal philosophy is all mental speculations and misconceptions of the actual vedic literature. The concept of brahman itself is not wrong, but the concept that the ultimate reality is brahman is false, the spiritual realization happens in 3 consecutive stages 1st is brahman realization or the impersonal feature 2nd is the paramātmā realization or the all pervading nature and the 3rd is the personal realization, the supreme personality of god or bhagavāna), this realistic God concept becoming more abstract ( as the age of kaliyuga forwarded more and more irreligious activities starts and people starts to forget the reality about god ) and one can see Vishwakarma [the invisible creative power] emerged as the supreme god who was perceived as a hotar, the unborn [Aja] creator and name giver of all other gods who have lot of faces, eyes and feet on every side; and who helps Tvastar, [the visible creative power of viswakarma] in producing all the Heavenly, Earthly and other Celestial realms and preserves them through the exercise of his arms and wings. He sacrificed himself to himself for the evolution of this visible world (Sarvamedha), thus he is Purusha or Narayana( this thing is false as is monotheism) His attributes like Vachaspathy connect him with Brahaspathi (the Guru of Gods). Again, Yajurveda pictured him as the Prajapati and in the Atharva veda he is mentioned as Pashupati.\nShwethashwatharopanishad described him as Rudrasiva, the one who is dwelling in all living forms.\n\nAccording to the above hymn, from Moolastambha purana which is something similar to Nasadeeya suktha It/He was the one who created himself from himself when there was no earth, water, light, air and akasha, and even the Thrimurthies \nLater in the post vedic and brahmanic period, the term Vishwakarma is appeared both as the Rsi and the Silpi. In yajurveda the term is seen as one of names of pancha risis. Though the term is an epithet of suryanarayana, one of the seven rays of Surya is also known as Viswakarma. Bhauvana Vishwakarma (Atharva/Angirasa Gothra) is a vedic Rsi who was the author of Rg 10–81,82 suktha, (Prabasa Vishwakarma) was probably a silpi and the son of Prabhas, the eighth hermit of the legendary Astam vasu and Yogasiddha, sister of Brihaspati. He is said to have revealed the Sthapatya Veda / Vastu Shastra or fourth Upa-veda, and presides over the sixty-four mechanical arts.\n\nVishvakarma [ God ] created five prajapathies – from his five faces such as Sadyojāta, Vāmadeva, Aghora, Tatpuruṣha, Īsāna. They are Manu, Maya, Twosta, Silpy, Viswajna and their respective Rishis (Gothra rishis of Vishwakarma (caste))\n\nIn later puranas he is sometimes identified with vedic Tvastar. Silpi Vishwakarma is the designer of all the flying chariots of the gods, and all their weapons and divine attributes. Vishwakarma/Tvostar is also credited with creating the missiles used in the mythological era, including the \"Vajra\", the sacred weapon of Lord Indra, from the bones of sage Dadhichi. He is regarded as the supreme worker, the very essence of excellence and quality in craftsmanship.\n\nSince Vishwakarma is the divine engineer of the world, as a mark of reverence, he is not only worshiped by the engineering and architectural community but also by all professionals. It is customary for craftsmen to worship their tools in his name.\n\nSilpy Vishwakarma is attributed a putative birthday by the Hindu religion. The more philosophical minded argue that it is impossible for the original Creator of everything to be born on a particular day. In Rig veda he is described as Swayambhu So it is a contradiction in terms since that presupposes another creator for Vishwakarma. The Vishwakarma Puja is celebrated in all parts of Nepal and India.\n\nEven among those who believe that there is a birthday there is no agreement as to when it actually occurs. Visvakarma birthday is celebrated on two days under different names:\n\nVishvakarman is a particular god of Hindu railwaymen in India.\n\nHindu scriptures describe many of Vishwakarma's architectural accomplishments.\n\nThrough the four yugas (aeons of Hindu mythology), he had built several towns and temples for the gods. Among them were, in chronological order, Svarga (Heaven) in the Satya Yuga, Lanka in the treta Yuga, and Dwarka (Krishna's capital) in the dwapara Yuga.\n\nThe Lord of Architecture is also supposed to have built the three deities Lord Jagannath, Lord Balabhadra, Goddess Subhadra along with Sudarshana Chakra in the Shreekshretra Jagannath Temple .\n\nViswakarma is also supposed to have built Dwarka overnight.\n\nShilpkar \n\nRajgir karigar \n\n\n\nhttps://joshuaproject.net/people_groups/16332/PK\n\n"}
{"id": "2252371", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2252371", "title": "Fort Belvedere, Surrey", "text": "Fort Belvedere, Surrey\n\nFort Belvedere (originally Shrubs Hill Tower) is a Grade II* listed country house on Shrubs Hill in Windsor Great Park, in Surrey, England. The fort was predominantly constructed by Jeffry Wyatville in a Gothic Revival style in the 1820s.\n\nThe fort was occupied by numerous members of the British royal family and associated personages from 1750 to 1976. From 1929 Fort Belvedere was the home of Edward, Prince of Wales, who greatly renovated the house and grounds, and was the site of Edward's abdication as King in 1936. The property remains part of the Crown Estate, and is home to private tenants. It is not open to the public.\n\nThe Fort Belvedere estate is situated in the extreme south end of Windsor Great Park in the parish of Egham, in the Borough of Runnymede in Surrey. The closest town to the fort is Sunningdale in Berkshire. The fort is situated on Shrub's Hill and overlooks Virginia Water. The fort is 22 miles from London, and Edward, Prince of Wales, would boast of being able to see London's St Paul's Cathedral \"through a spy-glass\" from the fort in the 1930s.\n\nThe fort's acquired name of 'Belvedere' reflects its status as a vantage point and as an 'eye-catcher' for the park.\n\nFort Belvedere was built 1750–1755, by Henry Flitcroft, for Prince William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland (1721–1765), younger son of King George II and Queen Caroline, and was featured in an engravings in 1753 and 1754, where it was described as the \"New building on Shrubb's Hill\".\n\nIt was, at first, merely a folly. It was used as a summer-house, and seven counties could be seen, as now, from the top of the flagstaff tower. The triangular turreted structure was set amidst a dense plantation of trees and overlooked Virginia Water, a man-made body of water constructed by Thomas and Paul Sandby at the behest of the Duke.\n\nSir Jeffrey Wyatville, who was responsible, under King George IV, for the rebuilding of Windsor Castle, enlarged the house in 1828 at a proposed cost of £4000. Additions included an octagonal dining room in the north-east side, in which the King regularly had dinner. A three storey annex was added for the accommodation of the Bombardier, with a new wall linking a heightened turret to which a large flagpole was added. The addition of further Gothic details enhanced the interior and exterior of the fort in 1829. The fort is built of brick with an applied wash that imitated the appearance of stone.\nQueen Victoria used Fort Belvedere as a tea house, and the fort was opened to the public in the 1860s.\n\nBy 1910 the fort was occupied as a grace and favour residence by Sir Malcolm Murray, the Comptroller to the Duke of Connaught. The Duke was the owner of nearby Bagshot Park. The fort was extended with a new service wing and entrance porch in 1911–12, which was subsequently demolished. The dining and drawing rooms were also extended and new entrance lodges were built. After the departure of Murray, the fort was described as suffering from \"dust inches deep, splintered doors and sagging floors\" in 1929.\n\nThe ruins in the grounds can be seen from the shore of Virginia Water and are part of an ancient temple brought from Leptis Magna near Tripoli. The ruins are located between the south shore and Blacknest Road close to the junction with the A30 London Road and Wentworth Drive.\n\nIn 1929, the building became vacant, and was given to Prince Edward, Prince of Wales, by his father, King George V. The king had originally expressed surprise at Edward's request asking him \"What could you possibly want that queer old place for? Those damn weekends I suppose\", but then smiled and gave his permission. Edward's previous residence had been York House, part of St. James's Palace in London, which he had thought \"more an office than a home.\" He would later write that he \"created a home at the fort just as my father and grandfather had created one at Sandringham ... here I spent some of the happiest days of my life.\"\n\nDuring Edward's occupancy, extensive renovation of the interior and grounds was carried out.\nThe relationship between Edward and Wallis Simpson blossomed at Fort Belvedere; the couple spent their first weekend at the fort at the end of January 1932, and by early 1935 two rooms had been combined at the fort for her use. Notable interior decorators to work on the fort under Edward included Sybil Colefax, Lady Mendl, Maison Jansen, and Herman Schrijver. Edward and Wallis entertained most weekends at the house; guests present included 'courtiers and diplomats, American men of affairs and English Society, garnished with a sprinkling of statesmen, soldiers and sailors'. Giles Gilbert Scott added a guest wing to the fort after Edward's accession as king in 1936. In 1936 Wallis moved permanently to the fort after receiving threatening anonymous letters, and left Fort Belvedere for the final time on 3 December 1936, a week before Edward's abdication.\n\nCabinet Office files released in 2013 revealed that during December 1936, the Home Secretary, Sir John Simon, had ordered the General Post Office to intercept Edward's telephone communications between the fort and the European continent. Government officials were caused further alarm by Edward's habit of leaving his official \"red boxes\" unguarded around the fort.\n\nFollowing opposition to the potential of Edward's marriage to Wallis Simpson from the British government and autonomous Dominions of the British Commonwealth, the fort became the final setting of Edward's abdication as king. He held several meetings with Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin at Fort Belvedere during the crisis, and on 10 December 1936 signed his written abdication notices at the fort, witnessed by his three younger brothers: Prince Albert, Duke of York (who succeeded Edward as George VI); Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester; and Prince George, Duke of Kent. The following day, it was given legislative form by special Act of Parliament: His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936. Following his abdication at the fort, Edward described himself as feeling \"like a swimmer surfacing from a great depth ... I left the room and stepped outside, inhaling the fresh morning air.\" He retained the visitor's book from the fort, and it would grace all the subsequent homes he and Wallis Simpson would share.\n\nEdward continued to pay for the gardeners, insurance and upkeep of the fort in the initial years following his abdication, because it was his wish that he would return there. His possessions from the fort were transferred to the Château de la Croë in the south of France (where he had named the sitting room \"The Belvedere\") in the spring of 1938, but many were damaged in transit. Edward was informed in March 1940 that the fort was no longer in his possession as his warrant to occupy the grace and favour residence had expired on the termination of his reign and was not to be renewed by the present sovereign, his brother, now George VI. Edward was greatly upset by this, writing in 1940 that \"It is crystal clear that this proposed reserving of the Fort by the use of Crown Lands is nothing more than a piece of bluff, and the first excuse that the king has been able to find to deprive me of my right to occupy the place should I ever desire to do so ...\" Edward believed that the incident was an example of his 'brother's failure to keep his word to me' after the fort had apparently been reserved for him if he should reside once more in England.\n\nIn 1977 the fort was used extensively for the filming of \"Edward & Mrs. Simpson\", an ITV serialisation of Edward and Wallis's relationship.\n\nFort Belvedere was largely unoccupied during the 20 years following Edward's abdication. The fort was used by the Office of the Commissioners of Crown Lands, who had been evacuated from their central London offices during World War II. After the war, the house remained empty.\n\nIn 1953 it was announced that the fort was to be available on a long lease, and a 99-year lease on the fort was bought by The Honourable Gerald Lascelles in 1955. Lascelles was the son of Henry Lascelles, 6th Earl of Harewood and Mary, Princess Royal, the only daughter of King George V and Mary of Teck. Lascelles was a first cousin of Queen Elizabeth II. He lived at the fort with his wife, Angela, and their son, Henry. Lascelles described the house as 'falling to pieces' at the beginning of his occupancy, and refurbished the fort, removing most traces of Edward's renovations in the process, except for the swimming pool and the battlements walk. The 30–40 rooms of the fort were reduced by the Lascelleses to the \"equivalent of an eight-bedroom house, including quarters for three or four staff. It will be a very manageable home\". Angela Lascelles remained dedicated to improving and renovating the house and maintaining the estate. The Lascelleses’ restoration of the fort was undertaken by the designer Stanley Peters who took three years to return it to its 18th-century state; Peters faced difficulties in removing offices added when Edward became king. A mural added by Peters in the drawing-room, and painted by Oliver Carson, depicted Peters in an incidental role, portrayed in 18th-century clothes chasing butterflies. The Lascelleses later claimed the credit for Peters's designs and his career suffered irreparable damage as a result.\n\nThe financial pressure following his divorce caused Gerald Lascelles to put his 78-year remainder of the lease up for sale through estate agents Savills in 1976. Offers for the lease above £200,000 were invited. An advertisement for Fort Belvedere's lease listed the features of the fort as \"Hexagonal central hall, fine drawing room, dining room, library, compact domestic quarters, 6 bedrooms, 5 bathrooms, arranged mainly in suites\" and the expanse of the estate as \"about 59 acres, of which 25 acres is freehold woodland\". Three cottages were also included in the lease with the swimming pool and tennis court. The lease was eventually acquired by a son of the Emir of Dubai in 1976.\n\nSince the early 1980s, the lease on Fort Belvedere has been held by the Canadian billionaire retail magnate Galen Weston and his wife, Hilary. The Westons have carried out extensive works on the fort, constructing a polo stud and doubling the size of the lake in the grounds.\n\nThe Westons have a close relationship with the British royal family; they were often guests of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother at the nearby Royal Lodge, and have hosted Queen Elizabeth II at the fort. Prince Charles plays polo with Galen Weston and stables his polo ponies at Fort Belvedere, and the nearby Coworth Park Polo Club in Sunningdale is the base for Weston's polo team, the Maple Leafs. The Westons have held notable parties at Fort Belvedere: Hilary Weston's 60th birthday party at the fort was attended by Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip, Queen Noor of Jordan and Princess Caroline of Monaco, and a June 2014 ball at the fort was enthusiastically covered in \"The Spectator\" magazine by Taki.\n\nThe Crown Estate remains the owners of the freehold, as the property is still part of the Great Park.\n\nThe grounds of Fort Belvedere are about a hundred acres in size and include forests and a lake. The gardens of Fort Belvedere, Virginia Water and the nearby Clockcase are Grade I listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.\n\nEdward said of the fort that \"By the time I came upon it, it had become a pseudo-Gothic hodge-podge. A profusion of yew trees kept one side of the house in perpetual shadow, staining the wall with green acidulous mould. But the half-buried beauty of the place leaped to my eye.\"\n\nEdward's subsequent passion for landscaping and horticulture briefly eclipsed golf and hunting in his affections, and he would often get his weekend guests, including his brother Bertie, the future George VI, to assist him in the landscaping of the fort. The garden designer Norah Lindsay also worked on the fort's garden at the behest of Edward, he would later describe how her \"unusual use of roses in the herbaceous border\" had justified her payment. Edward planted roses and irises along the walls of the battlement. Prime Minister Baldwin complimented Edward on the beauty of the garden; commenting on the \"silvery radiance of the birch trees and the delicacy of the autumn tints\" in late 1936. Edward also mowed hay on the fort's estate in the summer months and built a rock garden with cascading water pumped from Virginia Water.\n\nThe Westons have carried out substantial landscaping at the fort, and recruited Rosemary Verey to help with the design of the gardens at Fort Belvedere in the early 1980s. Verey's designs for the rose garden and the 120 ft long borders along the battlement remain, and have been reworked and maintained by garden designer Tom Stuart-Smith.\n\nThirty-one brass cannon were moved to the north-facing crenellated terrace of the fort from nearby Cumberland Lodge in the early 19th century. The cannon were made by Andrew Schalch at the Royal Brass Foundry in Woolwich in 1729–1749. The cannon were fired for King George IV's birthdays and other royal birthdays until 1907, with the cannonfire being answered by a miniature frigate situated on Virginia Water in the early years of their operation. The last Bombardier situated at the fort was Master Gunner Turner of the Royal Artillery. The Bombardier was entrusted with the care of the guns and lived in Bombardier's Cottage, connected to the main house by an archway. The cannon would have been melted down as part of the war effort in 1943 had it not been for the intervention of the head of the Tower Armoury, J. G. Mann. Four guns were removed from the terrace in 1930 and placed in two pairs at the entrances to the fort.\n\nShrubs Hill Tower inspired the building of similar triangular tower follies on various large estates, including:\n\n"}

These republics, though nominally independent, relied heavily on France for protection, and aid when push came to shove, which made the republics more of autonomous states, rather than an independent republic, which was shown after the declaration of the First French Empire, when several states were annexed, and the remaining turned into puppet monarchies.\n\nThe French Revolution was a period of social and political upheaval in France from 1789 until 1799. The Republicans who overthrew the monarchy were driven by ideas of popular sovereignty, rule of law and representative democracy. The Republicans borrowed ideas and values from Whiggism and Enlightenment philosophers. The French Republic supported the spread of republican principles in Europe, but most of these \"sister republics\" became a means of controlling occupied lands as client regimes through a mix of French and local power.\n\n"}

{"id": "2252455", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2252455", "title": "Nipple clamp", "text": "Nipple clamp\n\nA nipple clamp is a sex toy. It is a clamp that is applied to the nipples of a person of either gender. It causes pain by the pinching of the nipple, by the restriction of blood flow, and by the reintroduction of blood flow. Nipple clamps are used in some BDSM activities, such as breast torture. The main types of nipple clamps are the clothes-pin-style clamp, tweezer clamp, clover clamp, and piercing clamp, though any device that applies direct pressure can be used.\n\nClamps are typically used in pairs and often connected by a chain. Weights may be hung from the clamps to amplify the pain by increasing the pressure and pinching. The chain may be wrapped behind a fixed piece of erotic furniture such as a post, so that, when the wearer is prodded to jump or otherwise move suddenly, pain is increased by pulling of the nipples. Another variation involves attaching another chain to the chain, the end of which is connected to a clamp attached to either the clitoris for a female or a cock ring for a male. This variation is known as the \"Y clamps\" for the shape of the chain linking all three connection points when attached to the body.\n\nA clothes-pin style clamp works like a common household clothes-pin — two short lengths of metal, joined by a spring to keep one end closed; in its simplest form it is made of a crocodile clip. Its serrated jaws are usually covered with removable rubber sheaths to protect the nipple from damage and to reduce pain. This type often comes with screws to adjust the pressure.\n\nA tweezer clamp consists of two short lengths of metal, no more than 5–10 cm (2–4 in) in length. The two lengths are fixed together at one end and open at the other end (just like regular tweezers). The open ends are curved slightly to improve their ability to grip the nipple. Typically, it has small 1 cm rubber sheaths over this end to protect the nipple from damage and to reduce slippage. A small ring wraps around the two pieces of metal and is used to adjust the tension. The user places the two sides of the metal head either side of the nipple, then by sliding the ring along the clamp shaft towards the nipple, causes the two halves to close tighter together. Tension can thus be adjusted depending on the location of the ring — the closer the ring is along the shaft toward the nipple, the tighter the clamp.\n\nThe clover clamp, also referred to as a \"butterfly clamp\", is of Japanese design and provides increasing tension if pulled. The clamp itself is flat, about 5 cm by 10 cm (2 by 4 in) in size. The clamp is applied to the nipple and the spring tension holds the clamp in place. The clamp usually provides a very high pain level, and is usually only used by more experienced users. To increase tension on the nipples, small weights such as fishing sinkers can be attached to the ends of the clamp. As increased pulling tension is applied to the clamp, it will cause the jaws of the clamp to close tighter, depending on the amount of pull pressure. Another method is to use the clamps to keep a person in one place. If a cord is tied from the clamp to a fixed place, the wearer of the clamps cannot move away because the clamps will tighten as they move. Eventually the clamps would be pulled off the nipples but not before considerable pain is felt. If the clamps are left on for too long they can cause nipple irritation.\n\n"}
{"id": "2252457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2252457", "title": "Clusia", "text": "Clusia\n\nClusia is the type genus of the flowering plant family Clusiaceae. Comprising 300-400 species, it is native to tropical America. The genus is named by Carl Linnaeus in honor of the botanist Charles de l’Écluse.\n\nThe closest relatives of \"Clusia\" are the neotropical genera \"Chrysochlamys\", \"Tovomita\", \"Dystovomita\" and \"Tovomitopsis\". Together with \"Clusia\", these genera form the tribe Clusieae, where the fruit is a fleshy capsule with arillate seeds.\n\nThe distribution ranges from the Florida Keys and southern Mexico to southernmost Brazil, and from near sea level to at least 3500 m altitude in the northern Andes. Species of \"Clusia\" are a characteristic component of a number of Neotropical vegetation types, and may even be dominant, as is often seen in montane forests of the Greater Antilles. Most species are found in lowland or montane rainforests, but some occur in drier habitats such as the restingas of Brazil, caribbean coastal scrub and dry interandean valleys. A number of species are confined to rocky habitats, such as tepuis or granitic inselbergs. A few grow as scattered shrubs in paramo. The apomictic \"Clusia rosea\" is an invasive alien in Hawaii and Sri Lanka, and possibly elsewhere.\n\nIts species are shrubs, vines and small to medium-size trees up to 20 m tall, with evergreen foliage. Some species start life as epiphytes which grow long roots that descend to the ground and eventually strangle and kill the host tree in a manner similar to strangler figs.\n\nMany \"Clusia\" species have Crassulacean acid metabolism, which can be considered an adaptation to the often dry (micro)habitats of the genus.\n\nThe plants contain variously coloured latex in stems, leaves and fruit. The leaves are opposite, 5–20 cm long and 2–10 cm broad, with a leathery texture and an entire margin. Flower size varies from ca 5 mm wide (e.g. \"Clusia gundlachii\") to ca 150 mm in \"Clusia grandiflora\". The 4-9 petals are white, cream, yellow, pink, red, blackish or green. Flowers are unisexual and plants are dioecious (pistillate and staminate flowers are borne on separate plants). Stamen number ranges from four to several hundred. Shape and size of stamens are extremely variable. Sterile stamens are often present, both in pistillate and staminate flowers. Stigmas are four to 16 in number and usually sessile. The fruit is a leathery valvate capsule which splits open to release several red or orange, fleshy-coated seeds.\n\nPollination involves a range of different animals, and several types of rewards. Floral resin occurs in many, probably most species of \"Clusia\". The resin is produced by the stamens (by sterile stamens, referred to as staminodes, in pistillate flowers) and is collected by bees that use it in nest construction. Nectar is most common in montane species, e.g. \"Clusia clusioides\", and these flowers are visited by insects such as moths and wasps, and sometimes by bats or hummingbirds. In flowers lacking nectar or resin, pollination may be carried out by pollen-eating beetles, which visit also the rewardless pistillate flowers, as observed in \"Clusia criuva\". \"Clusia blattophila\" is pollinated by male cockroaches attracted by a pheromone-containing fluid produced by the flowers.\nSeeds are dispersed by birds and perhaps, in some cases, by small mammals.\n\n\"Clusia\" plants provide excellent nesting sites for some insects. For instance, \"Clusia grandiflora\", a common species in Guianese forests, is an attractive place for \"Polistes pacificus\" wasps to build their paper nests because arboreal ants, which often prey on these wasps, do not normally reside in this species of tree.\n\nThe wood of \"Clusia\" is highly durable, and is sometimes used for roof construction. The latex and the floral resin have antiseptic properties and have been used to seal wounds. Dry latex is sometimes burned like incense in churches. A few species are grown as house plants, or, in tropical areas, as ornamental trees and shrubs. Examples are \"Clusia rosea\", \"C. major\" and \"C. orthoneura\".\n\n\nCorreia MCR, Ormond WT, Pinheiro MCB, Lima HA (1993) Estudos da biologia floral de Clusia criuva Camb. um caso de mimetismo.

He is best known for his film role as the ruthless mob boss Mike Lagana in Fritz Lang's \"The Big Heat\" (1953), and is also particularly well-remembered in the English-speaking world for his landmark recordings of the entire King James Version audio Bible, which have been released in numerous editions. He later recorded the entire Revised Standard Version of the Bible. Scourby recorded 422 audiobooks for the blind which he considered his most important work.\n\nAlexander Scourby was born in Brooklyn, New York, on November 13, 1913, to Constantine Nicholas Scourby, a successful restaurateur, wholesale baker and sometime investor in independent motion-pictures, and Betsy Scourby (née Patsakos), a homemaker, both of whom were immigrants from Greece.\n\nReared in Brooklyn, Scourby was a member of a Boy Scout troop and later became a cadet with the 101st National Guard Cavalry Regiment. He attended public and private schools in Brooklyn, spending summer vacations in New Jersey, Upstate New York, and at a cousin's home in Massachusetts. Dismissed from Polytechnic Prep School, he finished his secondary education at Brooklyn Manual Training High School which he described as \"an ordinary high school that had an awful lot of shop.\" Scourby was a co-editor of the magazine and yearbook, and he envisioned a career in writing, though he later came to realize that writing was, for him, \"absolutely the most painful thing in the world\" and also that he \"could never meet a deadline,\" whereas he found the reading aloud of plays easy and enjoyable. Encouraged by some of his teachers, he began to turn his attention to acting. He made his stage debut with the high school's dramatic society, as the juvenile in Augustin MacHugh's \"The Meanest Man in the World\". \n\nUpon graduation from high school in 1931, Scourby, not yet having abandoned the prospect of a writing career, entered West Virginia University at Morgantown to study journalism. During his first semester he joined the campus drama group and played a minor role in A.A. Milne's comedy \"Mr. Pim Passes By\". In February 1932, as he was beginning his second semester, his father died, and he left the university to help run the family's pie bakery in Brooklyn. \n\nA month after Scourby returned to Brooklyn, he was accepted as an apprentice at Eva Le Gallienne's Civic Repertory Theatre on 14th Street in downtown Manhattan. At the Civic Repertory he was taught dancing, speech, and make-up, and was given his first professional role, a walk-on in \"Liliom\". In 1933, Scourby and other Civic Repertory apprentices joined together to form the Apprentice Theatre, which presented plays at the New School for Social Research in New York City during the 1933-34 season. His first role on Broadway was that of the player king in Leslie Howard's production of \"Hamlet\", which opened at the Imperial Theatre on November 10, 1936, and went on tour after thirty-nine performances. Returning to New York—and unemployment—in the spring of 1937, Scourby was introduced to the American Foundation for the Blind's Talking Book program by Wesley Addy, a member of the \"Hamlet\" cast and Scourby's roommate on the tour, who was regularly recording plays for the foundation. \n\nAfter a successful audition in the spring of 1937, Scourby was cast in a small part in a recording of \"Antony and Cleopatra\". During the following summer he was, again, the player king in a production of \"Hamlet\" in Dennis, Massachusetts, that featured Eva Le Gallienne. When he returned to audition for the American Foundation for the Blind later in the year he was told that the company of actors was \"filled\" but that he might record a novel if he wished. \"That was the beginning of it,\" he recalled years later, adding, \"The recordings for the blind are perhaps my greatest achievement. Most of the things I look back at in the theater were either insignificant parts in great plays or good parts in terrible plays. So it really doesn't amount to anything. Whereas I have recorded some great books. The greatest one being the Bible.\" \n\nScourby is credited as Hamlet's father the King (as spirit) on the 19 September 1936 CBS radio program \"Columbia Workshop\" directed by Orson Welles, and by the early 1940s he was playing running parts in five of the serial melodramas, popularly known as soap operas, including \"Against the Storm\", in which he replaced Arnold Moss for two years. He narrated Andre Kostelanetz' musical show for a year, using the pseudonym Alexander Scott. At the request of sponsors, his voice was heard on many dramatic shows, including NBC's Sunday program \"The Eternal Light\" (with which he was to remain, despite heavy commitments elsewhere, through the 1950s). On \"The Adventures of Superman\", his was the voice of the title character's father Jor-El in the one program devoted to the character's origins. During World War II, Scourby's broadcasts were beamed abroad in Greek and English for the Office of War Information. At the time, a writer in \"Variety\" (May 16, 1962) described the quality of Scourby's voice as \"the kind of resonance closely associated by listeners with big time radio.\" \n\nScourby kept his hand in the theater by doing summer stock and a wide variety of other seasonal productions. In Maurice Evans' production of \"Hamlet\", which opened at the St. James Theatre in New York on October 12, 1938, and ran for ninety-six performances, Scourby played Rosencrantz. Later in the same season he appeared with Evans in \"Henry IV, Part 1\" as the Earl of Westmoreland. The following year, he toured with Evans in \"Richard II\" as one of the hirelings of the king. He returned to Broadway years later in late 1946, replacing Ruth Chatterton as the narrator in Ben Hecht's \"A Flag Is Born\", a one-act, dramatic pageant in which Marlon Brando had one of his early stage roles. The play was produced by the American League for a Free Palestine, at the Alvin Theatre. On December 22, 1947, he opened with John Gielgud in Rodney Ackland's dramatization of \"Crime and Punishment\" at the National Theatre in New York. He was a co-founder of New Stages, a drama company that went into operation in a small theater on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village during the 1947-48 season. During its two-year existence, the company presented works by such artists as Federico García Lorca (\"Blood Wedding\"), Edward Caulfield (\"Bruno and Sidney\") and two plays by Jean-Paul Sartre.\n\nIn Sidney Kingsley's \"Detective Story\", which opened at the Hudson Theatre on March 23, 1949, and ran for a year and eight months, Scourby played Tami Giacoppetti, the tough racketeer. Almost immediately after \"Detective Story\" closed, Scourby began rehearsing another Kingsley role on Broadway, that of Ivanoff, the old Bolshevik friend of Rubashov in \"Darkness at Noon\", a dramatization of Arthur Koestler's novel. The play opened at the Alvin Theatre on January 13, 1951, with Claude Rains playing Rubashov, and ran for 163 performances. When the Theatre Guild revived George Bernard Shaw's \"Saint Joan\" later in the same year, with Uta Hagen in the title role, Scourby was cast as Peter Cauchon, the Bishop of Beauvais. The play was presented at the Cort Theatre from October 4, 1951, to February 2, 1952.\n\nScourby first appeared on screen opposite Glenn Ford in \"Affair in Trinidad\" (Columbia, 1952) and \"The Big Heat\" (Columbia, 1953). He appeared again with Glenn Ford in \"Ransom!\" (MGM, 1956), later to be remade with Mel Gibson and Gary Sinise. Scourby played Dr. Mikhail Andrassy in \"The Shaggy Dog\" (1959). \"None of the pictures I've done have been really important or very good\", Scourby later said, \"with the exception—and it is debatable—of \"Giant\" (Warner Brothers, 1956)\". In the film version of Edna Ferber's novel Scourby played Polo, the old Mexican ranch foreman. He later had roles in \"The Big Fisherman\" (Buena Vista, 1959), \"Seven Thieves\" (1960), \"The Devil at 4 O'Clock\" (1961) and \"The Executioner\" (1970). During these extremely busy years, Scourby, who had been living with his wife and child in an apartment near Columbia University in New York City, bought a home in Beverly Hills, California. Calls for Scourby to work in New York, however, soon made the Beverly Hills residence as much a commutation point as a home.\n\nBack on the New York stage, Scourby played Rakitin in Emlyn Williams' adaptation of Turgenev's \"A Month in the Country\" and Peter Cauchon in Siobhán McKenna's interpretation of \"Saint Joan\", both presented at the Off-Broadway Phoenix Theatre in 1956. Again at the Phoenix, he played King Claudius in \"Hamlet\" in the spring of 1961, bringing to the role, as Howard Taubman noted in \"The New York Times\" (March 17, 1961), the appropriate \"fret of fear and decay.\" \n\nIn 1963, Scourby was given the featured role of Gorotchenko, the Communist commissar who stalks a White Russian noble couple fleeing the Revolution, in \"Tovarich\", a Broadway musical by Lee Pockriss and Anne Croswell, based on the comedy by Robert E. Sherwood and Jacques Deval. The musical opened at the Broadway Theatre on March 18, 1963, with Vivien Leigh and Jean-Pierre Aumont as Scourby's prey. \"The signal tribute to Alexander Scourby...\", critic Norman Nadel wrote in his review in the New York World-Telegram and Sun (April 2, 1963), \"was the hearty hissing opening night as he strolled on stage. In polished villainy, he has no peer\". Shortly after \"Tovarich\" closed, on November 9, 1963, after 264 performances, Scourby began rehearsals in Los Angeles for a Theatre Group presentation of Anton Chekhov's \"The Sea Gull\", in which he starred with Jeanette Nolan for forty performances, beginning on January 10, 1964.\n\nIn the early 1950s, Scourby worked in television as both a narrator and actor. One of his continuing assignments was as narrator for NBC's \"Project 20\" public affairs specials. He narrated a ninety-minute condensation of the television series, \"Victory at Sea\", for \"Project 20\" in 1954. Other \"Project 20\" assignments were in regard to the atomic bomb, and three religious documentaries using great paintings to tell the Bible story: \"The Coming of Christ\" (at Christmas); \"He Is Risen\" (at Easter); and \"The Law and Prophets of the Old Testament\". Audio from \"The Coming of Christ\", with orchestrations by Robert Russell Bennett was released by Decca Records in 1960 to popular acclaim. In 1965 he replaced Sean Connery as narrator on the television special \"The Incredible World of James Bond\".\n\nAs a television actor, Scourby had roles on \"Playhouse 90\", \"Circle Theatre\", and \"Studio One\". He refused to tie himself down to a series, because, as he explained, \"it's hard to do good things that way.\" He took occasional parts in westerns such as \"\", \"Bonanza\", and \"The Rifleman\", as well as \"Mr. Novak\", \"Daniel Boone\", \"The Asphalt Jungle\", \"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\", \"The Defenders\", and other set-format dramatic shows. Most of the filmed shows were produced in California. In 1972, he joined his wife, Lori March, on \"The Secret Storm\", on which he played the second Dr. Ian Northcoate (March played his wife, Valerie Lake Ames Northcoate), until that show was cancelled in 1974. He later played Nigel Fargate on \"All My Children\" In the \"Twilight Zone\" episode, \"The Last Flight\", he played General Harper.\n\nScourby read 422 books for the Talking Books program of the American Foundation for the Blind, including Homer's \"Iliad\", Tolstoy's \"War and Peace\", Joyce's \"Ulysses\", Faulkner's \"The Sound and the Fury\". Scourby considered Talking Books his most important work. He also made recordings for Spoken Arts and Listening Library.\n\nScourby was the first person to record the King James Bible issued on long-play records in the 1950s. He originally narrated the Old and New Testament for the American Foundation for the Blind. The project required more than four years before it was completed in 1953. The original goal was to produce a clean, clear recording for visually impaired listeners. The American Bible Society distributed the recordings as \"The Talking Bible\", a set of 169 LP records with a running time of 84.5 hours. \n\nWith the advent of cassette tape technology in the 1970s, a number of companies began selling copies of the 1950 Scourby recordings without permission, assuming that they were in public domain. In the 1980s, a Florida company, Neva Products, sought to sell these recordings via TV direct-response advertisements. Prior to doing this however, Neva commissioned a law firm to research whether or not the recordings were in the public domain. The legal opinion came back that they were not in the public domain and that certain rights were associated with the recordings that could be protected. Based upon this legal opinion, Neva Products contacted Scourby and negotiated a non-exclusive license agreement and agreed to pay him a royalty on all sales. The television promotion went very well. However, some companies continued marketing the recordings without authorization, even though they were contacted by Neva informing them that the recordings were still under copyright and to cease and desist. \n\nNeva Products then negotiated another exclusive license agreement with Scourby in 1984, wherein Neva commenced lawsuits against numerous companies to stop them from selling the recordings without proper authorization. Neva was successful in this effort. One of the biggest organizations to be sued was The Christian Booksellers Association (CBA) from Colorado Springs, Colorado. They were sued because they permitted companies to illegally sell the Scourby recordings at the annual CBA convention, even after having been notified that those companies were not authorized to do so. Neva prevailed in that lawsuit. CBA was required to pay substantial financial damages for the violation. \n\nScourby produced another recording of the King James Bible for The Episcopal Radio and TV Foundation (ERTF) in 1972 on the condition that they would only be used in the Episcopal Community and only for non-profit purposes. When this recording began to be commercially exploited out in the general market as Scourby's latest narration, in 1986, Neva, with Scourby's estate, jointly sued Episcopal Radio and TV Foundation and Christian Duplication Inc. (CDI). CDI improperly purchased the recordings for commercial exploitation and refused to stop selling them after being notified by both Neva and the Estate of Alexander Scourby. At a 1989 Federal Jury Trial, the jury found both ERTF and CDI had breached their contract with Alexander Scourby. The jury awarded substantial damages to Neva Products and the Estate of Alexander Scourby and also awarded the rights to the 1970s recordings to Neva Products and the Estate of Alexander Scourby. The verdict forced ERTF, which was not officially part of the Episcopal Church, into bankruptcy.\n\nIt took Neva Products approximately 5 years to stop all of the unauthorized selling of the Scourby recordings, but finally in 1990 they were successful. In 1990, Neva transferred their rights in the recordings to Litchfield Associates, and in 1991, Litchfield bought all rights, titles, and interests, including the copyrights from the estate of Alexander Scourby. The copyrights have a date of 1991. Litchfield continues to this day to market the Scourby recordings worldwide through various license agreements and online. Scourby's recordings of the Holy Bible are still among the most popular religious recordings available today. \n\nScourby made recordings of British and American poetry, including \"A Golden Treasury of Poetry\", an LP recorded for the children's label Golden Records. It featured readings of such poems as Paul Revere's Ride, Gunga Din, The Highwayman, The Owl and the Pussycat, and Annabel Lee, and commentary written by Louis Untermeyer.\n\nScourby and Lori von Eltz were married on May 12, 1943. Von Eltz was the daughter of motion-picture actor Theodor von Eltz, and was well known as the actress Lori March. The couple had a daughter, Alexandra, born on March 27, 1944. Scourby had no political affiliation nor any specific religious affiliations, though he was baptized in the Greek Orthodox tradition and his marriage to von Eltz occurred in an Episcopal chapel.\n\nScourby died of a heart attack on February 22, 1985, in Newtown, Connecticut, aged 71. His widow died in 2013.\n\nTV Series: Wanted:Dead or Alive (1959) - Judge Coogan\n\n"}

In the 2007 Tour de France, he finished eighth while working for Discovery Channel team-mates Alberto Contador and Levi Leipheimer.\n\nIn 2008, Popovych moved to squad after announced that it would cease operations at the end of 2007.\n\nPopovych was recruited as a domestique member of the 2008 Silence Lotto Tour De France team primarily to support lead rider Cadel Evans, but had a rather disappointing year, with only a 3rd place in Paris–Nice to show for. At the end of the year, it was announced he would team up with his former Discover manager Johan Bruyneel again in 2009, joining the new Astana Team.\n\nIn 2009, Popovych and Lance Armstrong joined the Kazakh-based cycling squad , where many other former Discovery Channel riders and staff are also under contract. Popovych acted as a domestique for Alberto Contador in Paris–Nice, finishing 23rd himself.\n\nOn 15 October 2009 it was reported that Popovych will move to for the 2010 season.\n\nIn 2010 Popovych followed many former Astana riders to the newly created American based squad .\n\nIn January 2011 Popovych was incriminated in the Floyd Landis doping allegations against cycling team, after \"Sports Illustrated\" magazine reported that in November 2010 his property in Tuscany had been searched by Federal Officials who discovered drug testing documents, medical supplies and performance-enhancing drugs as well as evidence of links to controversial Italian physician Michele Ferrari. Later that day Popovych denied the allegations. The 2012 USADA Report later tied him directly to going to training camps set up by Ferrari and performing blood transfusions while a part of the Discovery team.\n\nDNF=Did not finish\n\n"}

Hastings in the district representing the Southern Tier of New York State. While he was Mayor, Jamestown received national attention as a result of the Labor Management strategy that Lundine implemented. Jamestown, long the center of labor strife, became a model for labor/management co-operation. As a Congressman, Lundine brought his labor/management ideas to Washington, and was instrumental in developing legislation that created labor/management councils and employee stock ownership plans. He focused on finance, banking and economic development policy, and also served on the Science Committee. He was a subcommittee chairman on the House Banking Committee. He graduated from Duke University in 1961 and from the New York University School of Law in 1964. Lundine is the only Democrat to have represented the Western Southern Tier in Congress in the 20th century, and no other Democrats would do so until Democrats Brian Higgins and Eric Massa won both portions of the now-divided district in 2005 and 2009 respectively.\n\nIn 1986, Lundine declined to seek reelection to Congress in order to be Mario Cuomo's running mate for Lieutenant Governor of New York. The pair was elected in 1986 and re-elected in 1990. As lieutenant governor, Lundine worked on housing, technology, economic development, and job training programs and policies. He was an advocate for the creation of a high-speed rail link connecting New York State cities together. He was a frequent surrogate speaker for Cuomo around the state. He also used his position as President of the State Senate to handle legislative liaison for Cuomo.\n\nThere were reports that Lundine accepted the lieutenant governorship under the belief that Cuomo would be elected president and he would succeed to the governorship, a belief which did not pan out. In 1993, Lundine came the closest to the governorship, when Cuomo was considered for a Supreme Court appointment. During most of 1993 and 1994, Cuomo had hesitated on announcing whether or not he would seek reelection. Lundine stated in a 1994 press conference that if Cuomo would not run then he would seek the Democratic nomination. Surprised by this, Cuomo flew to New York City and after discussions with the party's financial backers (who did not want to see a governor from the upstate counties), Cuomo announced his candidacy three days after Lundine's announcement.\n\nIn 1994, Cuomo and Lundine were defeated for reelection by State Sen. George Pataki and academic Betsy McCaughey Ross. Lundine retired from elective politics at this point, though he briefly considered a bid for governor in 1998. He also unsuccessfully sought appointment as President of State University of New York Fredonia. In 2002 he was an early supporter of Carl McCall for governor.\n\nHe currently is chair of the board of the Robert H. Jackson Center in Jamestown, New York, and serves on the board of Chautauqua Institution in nearby Chautauqua, New York.\n\nStan Lundine retired from the Chautauqua County Health Network as Executive Director effective July 13, 2007. He is currently chairing a commission studying local government reform in New York State, a position he was appointed to by former Gov. Eliot Spitzer, and chair of the Robert H. Jackson Center.\n"}
