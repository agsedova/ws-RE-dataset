{"id": "1981279", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1981279", "title": "Oh! Darling", "text": "Oh! Darling\n\n\"Oh! Darling\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles, composed by Paul McCartney (credited to Lennon–McCartney), and appearing as the fourth song on the 1969 album \"Abbey Road\". Its working title was \"Oh! Darling (I'll Never Do You No Harm)\". Although not issued as a single in either the United Kingdom or the United States, a regional subsidiary of Capitol successfully edited it as a single in Central America, having \"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\" as its B-side. It was also issued as a single in Portugal. Apple Records released \"Oh! Darling\" in Japan with \"Here Comes the Sun\" in June 1970.\n\nMcCartney later said of recording the track, \"When we were recording 'Oh! Darling' I came into the studios early every day for a week to sing it by myself because at first my voice was too clear. I wanted it to sound as though I'd been performing it on stage all week.\" He would only try the song once each day; if it was not right he would wait until the next day. According to sound engineer Alan Parsons, McCartney once lamented that \"five years ago I could have done this in a flash\".\nIn a 1980 interview with \"Playboy\" magazine, John Lennon said, \"'Oh! Darling' was a great one of Paul's that he didn't sing too well. I always thought I could have done it better – it was more my style than his. He wrote it, so what the hell, he's going to sing it.\" The Song is in the Key of A. \n\nGeorge Harrison described the song as \"a typical 1950s–'60s-period song because of its chord structure\".\n\nAfter an early attempt at this song on 27 January 1969 during the \"Let It Be\" sessions, Lennon announced, \"Just heard that Yoko's divorce has just gone through\", after which he and the band burst into an improvised version of the song, substituting \"I'm free at last\" for a part of the lyric. The song and the following improvisation are included on the \"Anthology 3\" CD. This version also features a keyboard part played by Billy Preston.\n\nThe basic track was recorded on 20 April 1969. There were many overdub sessions, including McCartney's attempts at the lead vocal. According to Ian MacDonald, the backing vocals were \"exquisite\", but \"sadly underplayed in the mix\". Engineer Geoff Emerick recalled that McCartney sang while the backing track played over speakers, instead of headphones, because he wanted to feel as though he was singing to a live audience. The song is one of several tracks on \"Abbey Road\" that have never been performed onstage by McCartney or any other of the Beatles to date.\n\n\nHowever, according to the book accompanying the 2019 box set Abbey Road\": Super Deluxe Version\", the personnel listed offers an alternative line-up. \n\n\n\"Oh! Darling\" appears to have drawn heavily on the New Orleans rhythm and blues sound popularised during the 1950s and early 1960s by African-American musicians such as Fats Domino; it also seems to have drawn on the Louisiana swamp blues sound found in songs like Slim Harpo's \"Rainin' in My Heart\" and Charles Brown's \"Please Come Home for Christmas\". Furthermore, it may have drawn on the related Louisiana genre known today as swamp pop, whose distinctive sound bears an uncanny resemblance to the basic structure of \"Oh! Darling\" – so much so that some in Louisiana originally thought the song had been recorded by a local musician. (When swamp pop musician John Fred met the Beatles in London in the 1960s, he was shocked to learn that \"they were very familiar with Louisiana music.\") Fittingly, swamp pop musician Jay Randall eventually covered \"Oh! Darling\" for the Lanor label of Church Point, Louisiana.\n\nIn 1978, \"Oh! Darling\" was released on the \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" soundtrack. It was also released as Robin Gibb's fourth solo single. It reached number 15 on the \"Billboard\" pop chart and number 22 in the US Adult Contemporary Charts on 7 October 1978. It was Gibb's highest charting single in the United States.\n"}

It is approximately northeast of downtown Denver. The refuge is on the grounds of the former Rocky Mountain Arsenal, a United States Army chemical weapons manufacturing facility. The site was designated a national wildlife refuge in 1992 by the United States Congress, and underwent a costly environmental cleanup in order to remove pollutants. The refuge is managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. More than 330 species of wildlife inhabit the refuge, including raptors, deer, raccoons, coyotes, white pelicans, black-footed ferrets, black-tailed prairie dogs, and bison.\n\nThe Rocky Mountain Arsenal (RMA) was built in 1942 to manufacture chemical weapons. A portion of the site was leased to private industry in 1946 for petroleum production and agricultural and industrial chemical manufacturing. When the American chemical weapons program was shut down after the Vietnam War, the RMA served as a site for dismantling and disposing of these weapons. The Shell Oil Company also used a portion of the site in the 1980s to produce pesticides. The RMA was closed in 1985, and in 1987 environmental testing revealed that the site was extremely polluted. The RMA was listed on the National Priorities List, a list of hazardous waste sites in the United States eligible for long-term remedial action (cleanup) financed under the federal Superfund program run by the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nIn 1986, while environmental testing was continuing, a winter communal roost of bald eagles, then an endangered species, was discovered at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal. Additional investigation by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) discovered that the RMA was home more than 330 species of wildlife. With the arsenal not fit for human habitation, pressure quickly built to have it turned into a wildlife refuge. Congress enacted the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge Act on September 25, 1992, and the legislation was signed into law by President George H. W. Bush on October 9. The law stipulated that a majority of the RMA site would become a national wildlife refuge under the jurisdiction of the Fish and Wildlife Service once the environmental restoration is completed. The Act also provided that, to the extent possible, the RMA was to be managed as a wildlife refuge in the interim.\n\nAt the time the refuge was established, the RMA consisted of more than of grassland dotted with small manmade lakes and ponds. Not all of this land was set aside for the refuge, however. Section 2(c)(2) of the enabling legislation set aside for use as the South Adams County Water Treatment Plant and for a United States Postal Service facility. Section 5(a)(1) of the act designated another for public sale. The former Shell Oil Company land also proved to be a problem, as it was somewhat geographically isolated from the rest of the refuge and not likely to be used by wildlife as habitat. Subsequently, about of the Shell Oil site was sold to Commerce City in 2010. Of the remaining of the Shell site, are (as of 2013) being used for a water treatment facility and another for domestic livestock grazing. The USFWS anticipates selling these by 2023. These land set-asides, sales, and transfers left the refuge with of land.\n\nThe entire of the old RMA was included in the remediation effort. On January 21, 2003, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) certified as ready for use, and this acreage was turned over to the USFWS. Another were certified clean on January 15, 2004. This allowed USWFS to formally open the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge on April 2, 2004. At that time, walking trails gave guests access to about of the refuge, and buses allowed visitors to tour another . EPA released another on July 31, 2006. The remaining were declared contaminant-free and turned over to the refuge on October 15, 2010. The total cost of the cleanup was $2.1 billion.\n\nAlthough all land to be included in the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge has been turned over to the Department of the Interior, management of the refuge remains the responsibility of both the USFWS and the U.S. Army. Because some land may still contain chemical weapons devices (such as unexploded projectiles or buried equipment) and cannot safely be integrated into the wildlife refuge, the Fish & Wildlife Service manages only of land. The remainder of the property () is managed by the U.S. Army. The USFWS and Army signed an inter-agency agreement to cooperate in the management of the Army land according to UWFWS principles.\n\nSixteen American bison were brought from the National Bison Range in Montana to an enclosed section of the refuge in March 2007 as part of the USFWS Pilot Bison Project. The number of bison reached 87 in 2013, forcing the USFWS to reduce the herd to just 60 animals as the limited acreage could not support so many animals. USFWS officials said that in a few years they will expand the bison acreage to , which will allow the herd to expand to an anticipated 210 animals.\n\nThe refuge's Visitor Center opened on May 21, 2011.\n\nAs of 2013, the USFWS had identified 332 species of wildlife on the refuge. Most of these species, however, existed only in very low numbers. Beginning in 2011, the USFWS began implementing a plan to remove invasive plant species and restore native plants on most of the refuge. About two-thirds of the refuge consists of mixed-grass and shortgrass prairie, while the remainder is a mix of forest, shrubland, and lakes, streams, and riparian areas. A large number of man-made features dot the landscape, including irrigation ditches, lakes and ponds, and former homesteads.\n\nA Comprehensive Management Plan for the refuge was finalized in June 1996. Under the plan, the refuge is available for public use, and community outreach and educational programs will be implemented to encourage public use.\n\nA record 300,000 people visited the refuge in 2013, and refuge officials say they expect visitation to top one million annually once visitor facilities, outreach plans, and a wildlife management plan are completely in place.\n\n"}
{"id": "1981290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1981290", "title": "Nyahururu", "text": "Nyahururu\n\nNyahururu (formerly known as Thomson's Falls) is a town in Kenya, lying north east of Nakuru. The town derives its name from the Maasai word e-naiwurruwurr, meaning waterfall and/or windy or place of storms. It is located in Laikipia County. Despite this, Nyahururu formerly functioned as the administrative capital of Nyandarua County, before it became a county, until the headquarters was shifted to Ol Kalou. There have been calls for a reversal. The town has an urban population of 36,450. The town still continues to be a central economic power of the immediate former district of Nyandarua. For that reason, the town has strong economic ties to the two counties.\n\nNyahururu was founded as Thomson's Falls, being named after the  high Thomson's Falls on Ewaso Narok river, a tributary of the Ewaso Nyiro River, which drains from the Aberdare mountain ranges. It is on the Junction of Ol Kalou-Rumuruti road and the Nyeri-Nakuru road. Settlers were more interested in the rich lands of the neighboring environments. Lord Maurice Egerton had the largest allocation of land neighboring the town. The town grew around a railway from Gilgil opened in 1929 (now effectively abandoned). The town was once an important player in the timber milling industry, and the now defunct National Pencil Company had a factory there. It is also an important milk processing hub.\n\nThe region around Nyahururu is mainly agricultural. To the North Ol Ngarua is famous for its maize, while Shamata to the south is a major producer of potatoes. Lately, flower farming has brought new life to Nyahururu. Suera Flowers is a pioneer in this venture. The cool temperate weather, land availability and cheap labor may be some of the attractions to flower farming.\n\nThe town is also a commercial center. It has many supermarkets such as Spears and Mugo supermarkets. Large banks in Kenya also have their branches situated in the town. Some of the banks in Nyahururu town are Barclays Bank, Equity, Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB), Cooperative Bank, Family Bank, Faulu Kenya and Kenya Women Microfinance Bank Limited.\n\nThe town has a number of hotels, including The Panari Resort, Kawa Falls Hotel, Laikipia Comfort Hotel, and Thompson Falls Lodge Hotel.\n\nThe town heavily relies on the transport industry. There are major highways linking the town to cities such as Nairobi, Nakuru and Nyeri. Most of these roads are now in good condition, and properly paved.\n\nNyahururu is also frequented by marathon and cross-country runners for practicing before major events due to its high altitude.\n\nSamuel Wanjirŭ, the Olympic Marathon Record holder and the first Kenyan to win the Marathon at the Olympics, called Nyahururu home until his death on May 16, 2011. Other notables from Nyahururu are Bedan Karoki, John Ngŭgĭ and Godffrey Gitahi Kariuki.\n\nLaikipia University has two campuses, one in Nakuru, and the other on the outskirts of Nyahururu town. The town also has some colleges, the most prominent being The Kenya Institute of Management. It also has several highly sought-after private schools. Some of the large private schools within Nyahururu Town are Busara Forest View Academy and Nyahururu Elite Schools. Large public schools include Nyandarua Boarding Primary School, District Education Board, Bishop Louis Ngarenarok, Ndururumo High School, Nyahururu Boys High School, and Ndururi High School. \n\nThe Pan African School of Theology, an evangelical theological college founded in 2006, is located near the town. Another Bible school is the Emmanuel Bible Institute. The Institute offers diplomas and certificates in theology.\n\nNyahururu is predominantly Christian, with Catholic and Protestant churches. Redeemed Gospel Church is one of the major Pentecostal Churches with its Regional Headquarters in town and many other branches in the outskirts.\n\nIn 2010, Nyahururu was the site of an internationally reported incident in which police rescued a woman who was under threat of lynching after she shoplifted two Bibles from a supermarket. \n\nIn September, 2008, residents of the town were shocked to see a blanket of hail resembling snow covering their land. \"I have not seen such a thing ever since I was born,\" said one surprised resident of Nyahururu. Cold weather kept it from melting quickly, as hail usually does in western Kenya. \n\n\n"}

John Philipp of Stadion (1652–1741), civil servant of the Mainz archbishops, was elevated to the rank of a \"Freiherr\" (Baron) in 1686. In 1705, he acquired the immediate lordship of Thannhausen and thereby was raised to a \"Reichsgraf\". Upon his death in 1741, the estates were partitioned between the lines of Stadion-Thannhausen and Stadion-Warthausen.\n\n"}
{"id": "1981296", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1981296", "title": "Kiwi FM", "text": "Kiwi FM\n\nKiwi FM (formerly Channel Z) was a New Zealand alternative music radio network. From 1996 to 2005, as Channel Z, it broadcast alternative and local music for a youth-oriented market. From 2005 to 2015, as Kiwi FM, it broadcast predominantly New Zealand independent music, to showcase local music across a wide range of genres and enable greater access to an international market for local contemporary artists. The station broadcast in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch on FM frequencies and globally through an internet stream. During its later years it operated as a non-profit subsidiary of MediaWorks New Zealand, and was affiliated with XFM and Triple J.\n\nChannel Z began as a modern rock and alternative rock radio station with a youth to adult demographic in Wellington from 19 August 1996, expanding to Auckland in 1997 and Christchurch in 1999. Channel Z was named after The B-52's song of the same name, and played a vital role in lynchpinning alternative NZ and international artists other stations claimed were too \"dangerous\" to play. John Diver was the station's first programme director and Martin Devlin, John Diver, James Coleman, and Olivia Sinclair-Thomson were among the station's earliest presenters. The station was part of the More FM group of stations. The group in turn became part of CanWest-owned Global Radio, which later became RadioWorks.\n\nIn 1998, longtime presenter Pheobe Spiers and breakfast hosts Jon Bridges and Nathan Rarere joined the station. In 1999, under network programme director Roger Clamp and Global Radio chief executive Brent Impey, the station changed to a less alternative format. Former programme director John Diver and fellow DJ Olivia Sinclair-Thomson resigned in protest. It received a mixed response from listeners. The network expanded to Christchurch in August 1999, with Willy Macalister presenting a local daytime show and Melanie Wise presenting a night show alongside the national network programme. The new station was launched with a concert featuring Stellar*, Living End, Zed and Tadpole.\n\nIn 2001, local shows in Wellington and Christchurch were abolished in favour of networked programming, Jon and Nathan's breakfast show was replaced with a James Coleman breakfast show, and Bomber and Clarke Gayford moved from Nights to Drive. The station's frequencies were reallocated from 94.2 to 93.8 in Auckland and 91.7 to 94.7 in Wellington, while it remained on 99.3 in Christchurch. In 2003, the station's breakfast show was cancelled. The 94.2 frequency in Auckland was used to launch The Edge and Channel Z was moved to a lower powered 93.8 frequency. The station's ratings fell, but improved when the transmitter was relocated to the Sky Tower from its previous position on Waiheke Island and gained a higher-powered frequency.\n\nChannel Z released four compilation albums based on listener polls and staff selections: \"Channel Z: the Best of Volume One\", \"Channel Z: Up Loud!\", \"Channel Z: the Best of Volume Two\", and \"Channel Z: the Best of Volume Three\". It also released a compilation of live recordings, \"Coleman Sessions: recorded live at York Street\". All the compilations featured New Zealand bands.\n\nThe station Kiwi FM was launched on Waitangi Day, 6 February 2005 and was opened with a speech by then-Prime Minister Helen Clark. It was created to replace alternative station Channel Z which had failed to deliver on its ratings.\n\nThe initial station ran for around a year and was re-branded in July 2006 when legendary New Zealand music journalist Karyn Hay stepped in as General Manager with Andrew Fagan as music director. On 1 May 2006, the New Zealand Government granted Kiwi FM access to new FM frequencies, under an agreement that kept the 100-percent Kiwi music station on the airwaves. Then broadcasting minister Steve Maharey said the station had been granted the use of three FM frequencies for an initial period of one year, during which time it would work towards becoming a not-for-profit organisation. As part of the agreement to use the frequencies, the station's brief was to be to significantly expand its content to include a greater range of New Zealand music.\n\nThe new organizational structure for Kiwi FM was rather unusual: it was set up as a partnership between Government Ministries for Broadcasting and Economic Development and listed media company MediaWorks. The new network was implemented in less than three months, launching on 17 July 2006 with a number of respected staff members - including Opshop frontman Jason Kerrison, the Twitch lead vocalist Fleur Jack, former student radio breakfast hosts Wallace Chapman and Glenn 'Wammo' Williams, actress Danielle Cormack, Blindspott frontman Damian Alexander, The Bads' vocalist Dianne Swann, and former Mockers and Lig frontman Andrew Fagan.\n\nIn February 2012 Kiwi FM changed their playlist to play 40% international artists while still playing 60% New Zealand artists. The international artists include alternative artists that don't normally get airplay on commercial radio, similar to the New Zealand music already played. On Friday 20 March 2015 MediaWorks announced the decision to shut down Kiwi FM on midnight 31 March, with parent company MediaWorks New Zealand choosing to focus instead on \"dance music and hip hop\".\n\nAn online petition and forum to bring back the Channel Z format, called Bring Back Channel Z, ran for about a year. The campaign was featured in Rip It Up, with a letter from petition co-founder Jonathon Kerkhofs. The magazine was largely skeptical of the potential success of the website giving it as much chance of success as \"a Pop Idol winner has at a second album deal\". In the same issue Bradbury, who was at the time editor of Rip it Up, cited the need for a station such as channel Z to support the New Zealand music industry. He claimed \"Channel Z served an important role between the Student Radio Network and the commercial stations\" and that with it gone \"New Zealand music is going to find it a much harder place to get heard\". The petition has attracted over 1400 signatures, far short of its goal of 10,000.\n\nOn Monday 18 January 2010 a version of the Channel Z format was brought back on radio station The Rock. From 7PM to 10PM The Rock aired Channel Z Nights based on the modern rock format similar to that of Channel Z in the early 2000s. The show failed mostly due to the music being similar to the rest of the days music played on The Rock, and not adhering to Channel Z format. The show was canned a week before Christmas the same year. Both The Rock and Channel Z had come under the same ownership in 2001 when Channel Z owner Canwest purchased RadioWorks with all stations eventually falling under the same management umbrella.\n\nModern day Radio Hauraki relaunched with a similar format to Channel Z in early 2013, playing much of the alternative music originally played on the station. This format still exists today.\n\nIn 1988 in the Waikato and Bay of Plenty a local station called 898 FM was renamed to Kiwi FM broadcasting on 89.8 FM. The Kiwi FM station played Hit Music similar to Magic 91FM in Auckland and ZM. In 1993 Kiwi FM was rebranded as The Breeze but this station was completely separate to the current The Breeze station both in the Waikato and even the original The Breeze station in Wellington, a similar station was launched in Auckland replacing Magic 91FM. In 1997 this frequency was taken over by The Radio Network and used to launch ZM into the Waikato and Bay of Plenty.\n\nIn Te Puke a local station called 92.9 Kiwi FM and then for a short period known as Kiwi 89FM operated. This station was independently owned and operated by Whakatane-based station One Double X - 1XX from September 2001 to May 2011.\n\n\"The Dick 84 Brekkie\" with Nathan Rarere and Jon Bridges took the breakfast slot from 1998 to early 2003, while James Coleman hosted the \"Coleman Breakfast Programme\" from 2003 until the station closed in early 2005. Local programming played during the daytime slot, until a nationwide day show with Phoebe Spiers was launched in mid-2001.\n\n\"The James Coleman Radio Programme\" played on weekday afternoons and in particular featuring a regular segment where, live on air, Coleman would telephone an elevator in central Wellington, and pretend to be a representative from Schindler's Lifts (an elevator service company), usually causing confusion for the elevator users. Martyn 'Bomber' Bradbury and Clarke Gayford hosted a syndicated night show in 2001 and 2002, replaced Coleman in the drive show in 2003.\n\nOther local and specialist programming aired during night and weekend slots. Riot!, a punk show, aimed to break through new punk/alternative punk acts from overseas and New Zealand. \"Talkback with Bomber\", a left-leaning youth-oriented Sunday night talkback show with Martyn Bradbury, was broadcast for most of Channel Z's life. Comedian, musician and Flight of the Conchords band member Jemaine Clement worked for the station in the late 1990s, and won New Zealand Radio Awards for his work.\n\nUntil its closure, Kiwi FM used digital media to archive and catalogue shows for international audiences.\n\nFormer presenters include Opshop frontman Jason Kerrison, The Twitch lead vocalist Fleur Jack, former student radio breakfast hosts Wallace Chapman and Glenn 'Wammo' Williams, actress Danielle Cormack, Blindspott frontman Damian Alexander, The Bads vocalist Dianne Swann, former The Mockers frontman Andrew Fagan, Karyn Hay, Goodshirt frontman Rodney Fisher, Angelina Boyd, Sam Collins, Mikee Tucker, Phoebe Spiers, Nathan Muller, Charlotte Ryan, Dylan Cherry and Dan Clist.\n\nFlagship specialist shows included: The Lounge, A Kiwi Abroad, Voices from the Wilderness, High Noon Tea, The New Zealand Electronic Show, Songs From The Backyard, Resurrection Selection and many more over Kiwi FM's lifetime devoted to showcasing certain aspects of Kiwi music and culture.\n\nThe last song played on Kiwi FM was Chris Knox's \"Not Given Lightly\".\n\nBefore its closure, Kiwi FM broadcast on FM frequencies in New Zealand's three major centres. These were given back to the Government when the network closed.\n\n\nShihad (briefly known as Pacifier) was featured on four of the five Channel Z compilation albums.\n\"Channel Z: the Best of Volume One\" was a compilation of popular tracks in 2000.

The game was introduced as part of the XSN Sports lineup, which included such games as \"NFL Fever 2004\", \"Links 2004\", \"NBA Inside Drive 2004\", \"NHL Rivals 2004\", \"Top Spin\" and \"RalliSport Challenge 2\".\n\nThe career mode in Amped 2 is much like other extreme sport games such as Tony Hawk's Pro Skater in which each level has goals for the player to complete. Each level or mountain has a high score and media score to break, which entails accumulating the most points in one run of the mountain and performing tricks for photographers or the media who are scattered throughout the mountain. The player must also find eight snowmen on each run as well as complete five tricks and gap locations that earn the player skill points. Skill points are used to upgrade stats such as \"spin/flip\", \"big air\", \"ollie\", \"balance\", and \"switch\".\n\nIn addition to these challenges, as the player progress through their career, they will be invited to events in which they compete for a top three finish which yields both fame and skill points. As the player's fame rises they gain different titles which are (from lowest to highest): \"Local Rider\", \"Shop Rider\", \"Pro\", \"Superstar\", and \"#1\". Once the player reaches number one in the world they are able to become a legend by completing each legend challenge on each mountain.\n\nIn addition to snowboarding, the player has the opportunity to snow skate. Snow skate adds different gameplay elements to the game which is more representative of skateboarding than snowboarding.\n\nA character's physical features, such as clothing, goggles, and boots, can be edited.\n\nAmped 2 features 14 top snowboarding pros, including Jeremy Jones, Mikey LeBlanc, Travis Parker, Torah Bright and Janna Meyen.\n\nAmped 2 provides a wide variety of performable tricks. There are also point multipliers which increase points when performing a difficult or stylish move.\n\nGeneral tricks include spins, flips, off-axes, butters, jibs, railslides, ollies, jumps, grabs, lip tricks, and tweaks . The player can also perform \"combos\". For example, a multiple flip + a 360 spin. Grabs can be achieved while airborne by moving the right thumbstick in any direction.\n\nAdditionally, the player can perform \"style moves\", which adds extra points and point multipliers to increase the player's score.\n\nAmped 2 supports up to eight players on System Link or Xbox Live and allows split-screen on both.\n\nOn Xbox Live there are five different game types such as, \"Just Ride\", \"Trick Race\", \"High Score\", \"Best Trick\", and \"King of the Mountain\".\n\nThere are seven different courses which include, Breckenridge, Bear Mountain, Mount Hood, Laax, Mount Buller, Millicent, and New Zealand, and each course has at least two different drop points.\n\nAmped 2's multiplayer on Xbox Live brought a number of new features not seen in any other on-line game at the time. For instance, it was the first game on Xbox Live to integrate a player's career mode character to that of their Xbox Live character. During career mode, as the player completes tasks, they gain skill points which increase their character's abilities. This then translates to the player's Xbox Live character, therefore, giving individuals who have completed the career mode an advantage over those who have not.\n\nMany Xbox Live titles have a single host who controls the game options, but if that player were to quit their session, the entire game session would expire. However, in Amped 2, the host can choose to have either the winner, loser, or a random player of a session select the options for the following game. Also, if the host quits, the player with the next best connection gains hosting abilities rather than ending the game session.\n\nAmped 2 has an abundant soundtrack of over 300 songs, including various underground and indie groups such as Hudson River School, Time Spent Driving, Acumen Nation, and The Peripheral Visionaries. In addition to the in game soundtrack, players can choose to use custom soundtracks as well.\n\nThe game received \"favorable\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. IGN said that \"If you're a fan of the original \"Amped\", then you should feel right at home with this game\", praising the game's presentation, graphics, sound and lasting appeal, but stating that while they liked the gameplay, there was still room for improvement. In Japan, where the game was ported for release as on February 26, 2004, \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of all four eights for a total of 32 out of 40.\n\n"}

{"id": "1981304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1981304", "title": "Coast (radio station)", "text": "Coast (radio station)\n\nCoast is a New Zealand radio network playing a mix of easy listening, pop, rock and R&B music from the 1970s, 1980's and more recent years. The network includes 20 stations in major cities and provincial centres from studios in central Auckland, owned and operated by New Zealand Media and Entertainment (NZME).\n\nThe Coast network reaches an estimated 393,500 listeners each week. Its format is smooth, with short hourly news bulletins, succinct voice breaks, minimal ad breaks and limited clutter. Its target listener is 40 to 64 years old, has reached their highest-earning potential, owns their own home and spends disposable income on luxury items and travel. The audience is almost equally male and female, with a 52% female skew.\n\nThe current Coast format was launched 26 April 2004.\n\nOther unrelated stations also carry the Coast name, including the independently and operated Coast FM network based at Westport on New Zealand's South Island West Coast. Coast Access FM, a community radio station, broadcasts to the Kapiti Coast and Horowhenua.\n\nCoast originally started in Hawke's Bay in 2002, as a local station. The history of this station dates back to 1995 as \"The Wireless Station\" broadcasting on 1530 AM and playing music from the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. \"The Wireless Station\" was started/operated by The Wireless Station Ltd for three years from November 1995 and was then leased or sold to Hawke's Bay Media Group in 1998 and re-branded as \"Goodtime Gold\", playing music from the 1960s and 1970s. In 1999 it was renamed simply \"Gold 1530\".\n\n\"Gold 1530\" was leased (or sold) to The Radio Network in 2000 and was re-branded as \"Jammin' Oldies 1530 AM\" or \"JO 1530\" in June 2000. In 2002 the station became the very first station under the Coast brand name and in 2004 Coast began producing their programme from Auckland networked back to Hawke's Bay on 1530 AM (then on 1584 AM from 2011), and later to the rest of New Zealand.\n\nThe final re-branding of the station was to the current name Coast 1530. In 2004 the station became voice tracked from Auckland in preparation for its launch in the Auckland market on 26 April 2004. The network expanded beyond Auckland and Hawke's Bay to other markets later in the year.\n\nThe network rose to third place in the Auckland radio survey ratings in 2006, just two years after it began. Then programme director Mike Regal credited the station's success to serving the baby boomer gap in the market that had previously been ignored by marketers, advertisers and media companies. He said the station was a fine balancing act between being neither a station for the young or a station for seniors. \"We don't want to be too cool and hip with it and risk alienating people, but on the other side we didn't want to sound too old either,\" he told the \"New Zealand Herald\".\n\nClassic album tracks from the likes of Frank Sinatra and Dusty Springfield have been a cornerstone of the network's playlist. Regal said tracks might have seemed \"daggy\" to some people, but they were songs people over 30 years old would know, recognise and sing at a karaoke bar.\n\nIn 2011 the original 1530 AM frequency leased by The Radio Network and used to start the first Coast Station in Hawke's Bay was returned to its original owners and is being used to once again broadcast The Wireless Station, with a format of music from the 1930s to the 1970s.\n\nIn a radio survey in late 2014, Coast recorded more than 105,000 listeners in Auckland each week and a 7.8 percent market share, putting it on the top six highest-rating radio stations in the highly competitive Auckland radio market. The network has been even more successful in the Bay of Plenty, maintaining a number one ratings spot, with 23 thousand listeners and 15 percent market share, since breakfast host Brian Kelly moved from local station Classic Hits in 2011.\n\nIn late 2018 and early 2019 Coast migrated to FM in a number of markets where coverage had previously on been only available on AM - including Hawke's Bay, Whangarei, and Taranaki.\n\nA live network breakfast programme with Jason Reeves and Bernadine Oliver-Kerby commenced in January 2018. A local Tauranga/Coromandel/Thames breakfast show is hosted by Bay of Plenty identity Brian Kelly, the former host of the Coast network breakfast show. Kelly has been with what is now New Zealand Media and Entertainment since 1970, having worked as a programme trainee and sports broadcasting before hosting the local Bay of Plenty's Classic Hits breakfast programme for 33 years. He continues to live in the region, where he remains well known for his support of motorsport and his commentaries and Bay of Plenty Times columns on music and locals issues.\n\nThe station's foundation breakfast host was well-known veteran announcer Mike Oliver, who left in early 2011 before passing away from illness in 2014. Oliver had previously worked as a host on Radio Liberty and a voice over artist on Prime TV.\n\nFor a period, Hāwera had its own local breakfast show called \"The 1557 Breakfast\". This show was originally aired on Newstalk ZB in the Hāwera region when Newstalk ZB used the 1557 AM frequency. After Newstalk ZB in Hāwera changed to frequency 1278 AM, the show was dropped and replaced with the Auckland-based programme, but it was later picked up by Coast. The 1557 AM frequency in Hāwera has since been reassigned to Hokonui.\n\nLorna Subritzky has hosted the weekday time slot on Coast since 2015. The former Easy Mix breakfast host also serves as a traffic presenter for Newstalk ZB During more than 25 years in the media industry, she has appeared on Shortland Street and Interrogation and a host of advertisements and advertorials like Family Health Diary. Founding daytime host Jacqui Taite left the station at the end of 2011. Gael Ludlow filled the role in 2012 and Murray Lindsay hosted in 2013. During 2014, the station ran with a day show hosted by Nik Brown.\n\nDrive, the afternoon show on Coast, was hosted by Murray Lindsay until late 2016, formerly the long-running day time host of Classic Hits. Drive was hosted by Rick Morin until 2012. During 2013 Southland radio identity John \"Boggy\" McDowell hosted the drive show after a 33-year stint as host of Southland's Classic Hits 4ZA since 1979. The move had been prompted by a desire for more leisurely mornings and the chance to broadcast to a national audience. He told The Southland Times certain things had \"fallen into place that made it a perfect time to move to a new time slot\". However, despite dropping his Southland nickname \"Boggy\", McDowell was moved to Gore's Hokonui radio station in 2014, swapping places with Nik Brown.\n\nRadio presenter Jason Reeves became the drive show host in early 2017, replacing Murray Lindsay. Jason \"JT\" Tikao took over in January 2018 when Jason Reeves moved to breakfast. In January 2019 Melanie Homer joined JT on Coast afternoon drive, moving from her long-time Mix on air role.\n\nRick Morin hosts Coast's Night Show between 7pm - 11pm. Before 2013 the night programme was automated.\n\nBrian Kelly hosts Saturday mornings, and Saturday Night Fever plays automated on Saturday night. Tracey Donaldson hosts Sunday mornings.\n\nOvernight and during weekend nights the station is automated.\n\nCoast's station group has expanded rapidly since its Auckland launch in 2004. It was initially introduced in coastal markets before being introduced provincial inland markets like Rotorua in 2008.\n\nCoast has news, sports, traffic and weather bulletins from the NZ Herald newsroom at the start of every hour, followed by music, comments from the announcers on the music being played and issues of the day.\n\nDuring breakfast Coast has half-hourly news and sports updates and quarter-hourly news teasers.\n\nDuring weekend days, there are hourly news and sports updates and weather forecasts.\n\nCoast regularly runs competitions and is famous for \"Coast Stars\" where listeners win cash by identifying the \"stars\" saying \"Love the music - Coast\".\n\nCoast's network stream is also available on the iHeartRadio website and app.\n\n"}

They comprise two forms of content, shorter films and companion films.\n\nA featurette is a film usually of three reels in length, or about 24–40 minutes in running time, thus longer than a two-reel short subject but shorter than a feature film. Hence, it is a \"small feature\" (the ending \"-ette\" is a common diminutive suffix derived from French). This term was commonly used from before the start of the sound era into the 1960s, when films of such length as the Hal Roach's Streamliners—and several French films of that length—ceased being made, or were made as experimental or art films and subsumed under the more general rubric of short.\n\nAfter the advent of DVD technology, the term also gained the meaning of \"a brief documentary film covering one or more aspects of the film creation process\". In DVD features descriptions, the term \"featurette\" usually refers to \"behind-the-scenes\"–type bonus material such as documentaries on special effects, set design, or cast and crew interviews.\n\n"}

It begins near the Minnesota State Capitol in Saint Paul and extends westward into neighboring Minneapolis, where it passes the University of Minnesota, and then turns north to pass through several suburbs before its main portion ends in Blaine, Minnesota, although there are stretches of road designated as University Avenue that are north of the Blaine terminus, the final stretch ending near Andree, Minnesota. For many years, the road carried U.S. Highway 12 and U.S. Highway 52 (at least for part of its length), and University Avenue is still a significant thoroughfare in the area.\n\nUniversity Avenue originally ran along a line several blocks north of its current location, forming a route that once connected the Minneapolis campus of the University of Minnesota to Hamline University in Saint Paul (hence the name). When the construction of the Minnesota Transfer Railway yards blocked that route, the street was moved one-half mile to the south on the Saint Paul side, to what was then called Melrose Avenue. The old University Avenue route was renamed Minnehaha Avenue, which it remains to this day.\n\nSome important neighborhoods the road passes through include Frogtown (officially, the Thomas-Dale neighborhood) and the Midway region, both in Saint Paul. Hubbard Broadcasting and its flagship stations, KSTP-AM-FM-TV, are on University at the border of Minneapolis and Saint Paul. In fact, the sidewalk at the KSTP studios is right on the city/county line. This was one of the highest points in the area, an appropriate site for a radio transmitter. An antenna structure still stands there today, though it is used for microwave links rather than broadcasting (KSTP and most other Twin Cities stations use the Telefarm installation in Shoreview, Minnesota, or the nearby KMSP Tower).\n\nA water tower commonly known as the Witch's Hat stands just a few blocks away in Minneapolis's Prospect Park neighborhood.\n\nIn 1890, the first interurban streetcar link between Minneapolis and Saint Paul used University Avenue and Washington Avenue in Minneapolis. History is now being repeated, as the METRO Green Line light rail connects the two downtowns as well as the University of Minnesota along a similar route.\n\nUniversity Avenue carries Ramsey County Road 34 in Saint Paul, and Hennepin County Road 36 in Minneapolis to the junction with I-35W. West and north of Central Avenue, University Avenue carries Minnesota State Highway 47 to the junction with US 10, after which it carries Anoka County Road 51.\n\n"}

It is served by the 1, 2, and 3 trains at all times.\n\nOperation of the first subway began on October 27, 1904, with the opening of the original 28 stations of the New York City Subway from City Hall to 145th Street on the West Side Branch including the 72nd Street station. The original configuration of the station was inadequate by IRT standards. It had just one entrance (the control house on the traffic island between 71st and 72nd Streets, now listed on the National Register of Historic Places), and the platforms and stairways were unusually narrow. There were no crossovers or crossunders as the control house had separate turnstile banks and token booths for each side. Express trains ran on the innermost two tracks, while local trains ran on the outer pair.\n\nDuring the 1950s, the New York City Transit Authority (now the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, or MTA) considered converting the station to a local station by walling off the express tracks from the platforms. This would have coincided with 59th Street–Columbus Circle, which is a major transfer point to the IND Eighth Avenue Line, becoming an express stop.\n\nA substantial renovation was completed on October 29, 2002, providing a new, larger control house on the traffic island between 72nd and 73rd Streets and slightly wider platforms at the north end of the station.\n\nAt platform level, the station is similar to its original configuration, with two narrow island platforms and four tracks.\n\nThere are two station houses, both of which provide entry and exit: the original station house south of 72nd Street, and the new one north of 72nd Street.\n\nThe crossovers and elevator are only in the northernmost station house. This control house has two staircases and one elevator from each platform going up to a crossover, where on either side a turnstile bank leads to either 72nd or 73rd Streets. Only the southern turnstile bank, to the northern side of 72nd Street, has a staffed token booth. The elevators from this turnstile bank make this station ADA-accessible. This control house has an artwork, \"Laced Canopy\" by Robert Hickman, which consists of a mosaic pattern on the central skylight; if looked at in the right way, the knots within the pattern make up the notation for an excerpt of Verdi's Rigoletto.\n\nThe original control house was renovated and now has a total of five staircases: two to the southbound platform and three to the northbound platform. These staircases go up to a crossover. On the north side, an unstaffed turnstile bank leads to 72nd Street; on the south side, three High Entry/Exit Turnstiles lead to 71st Street. This control house has artful wrought iron pillars, dating back to the days of the original subway system, as well as decorated ceiling beams.\n\n"}

It first appeared in Albanian in 1981 under the title Dosja H.\n\nIn this often-comic novel, two Homeric scholars from Ireland by way of Harvard University plan to investigate the tradition of oral epic poetry in the rural habitats of Albania where historical epics are composed and sung by itinerant minstrels as popular entertainment. The singers have been doing this for many generations, possibly since ancient Greek times (H stands for Homer). The scholars travel to Albania with a tape recorder to study the phenomenon and record samples of the singing and the changes over time in multiple recordings of the same song, the study of which would give them an answer whether Homer was an editor or a writer. Their main interest is in the variations on the tradition exemplified in the work of individual singers, how historical events are woven into poetry, and whether there is regional bias in their interpretations.\n\nWhen they reach their destination, they are confronted by suspicious provincial townspeople and a paranoid local governor, who sends spies after them, convinced that they themselves are spies of some sort. Their work is attacked by the Serbian pastor because the scholars favor the Albanian epic poetry as original and the Serbian as an imitation. One interpretation of the story is a metaphor for why legends continue to be believed despite our attempts to discover the truth, and highlights the difficulty that the modern world has in truly understanding past, or even rural, civilizations. The novel also considers the passing of the epic form as a means of recording and retelling history and questions the nature of civilization itself as art forms are lost to development and technology.\n\nThe French translation of 1989 (revised in 1996) was by Jusuf Vrioni. It appears in volume 4 of Kadare's collected works (Ismail Kadare: \"Oeuvres\"). The English version by David Bellos, published in 1997, was made on the basis of the French translation.\n\nThe English translation garnered mostly positive reviews.\nKen Kalfus criticized the novel, calling it \"lazily plotted, stylelessly written\" and a \"nationalist whine\". He went on to accuse Kadare of conforming to Hoxha's \"communist-nationalist doctrine.\"\n\nOther reviewers praised the novel, calling it \"one of his most unusual and attractive books\" and the writer \"a voice unlike any other in contemporary fiction\". Jennie Ver Steeg from \"Booklist\", called it a \"a witty, multilayered critique of totalitarianism, nationalism, and scholarly objectivity\".\n\"Publishers Weekly\" referred to it as \"an amusing parable\" and to Kadare as a \"Controversial Albanian dissident\". They called the relationship between the governor and Dull Baxhaja \"a masterpiece of Gogolian comedy\".\n"}

Her perception growing up was that the war was avoided as a topic of discussion despite its evidence everywhere, and The Holocaust was a particularly taboo topic. This had a strong effect on her later writing and her feelings about her German identity.\n\nShe left West Germany in 1964, at the age of 18. She moved to the United States in 1965, where she married (becoming Ursula Hegi) in 1967 and became a naturalized citizen the same year. In 1979, she graduated from the University of New Hampshire with both a bachelor's and master's degree. She was divorced in 1984. The same year, she was hired at Eastern Washington University, in Cheney, Washington, near Spokane, Washington, where she became an Associate Professor and taught creative writing and contemporary literature.\n\nHegi's first books were set in the United States. She set her third, \"Floating in My Mother's Palm\", in the fictional German town of \"Burgdorf,\" using her writing to explore her conflicted feelings about her German heritage.

Noorat is located approximately 211 km west of Melbourne. The township is located at the base of Mount Noorat, a dormant volcano, which is considered to have Australia's largest dry crater. At the 2006 census, Noorat had a population of 252. By 2011, according to the census, the population had dropped to 167, although this drop in numbers is a bit deceptive as the town boundary was changed in between the 2006 and 2011 census.\n\nNoorat derives its name from Mount Noorat, a dormant volcano named by explorer Major Thomas Mitchell after a local Indigenous elder, Ngoora.\nEuropeans first settled the Noorat area in early 1839 when MacKillop and Smith established a run called Strathdownie – which was renamed Glenormiston by Niel Black, a Gaelic-speaking Scotsman from Cowall in Argyll who purchased the property in 1840.\n\nPrior to European settlement, the area near Mount Noorat was a traditional meeting site where Indigenous tribes – the Kirrae Wuurong people - held ceremonies, bartered goods and settled disputes. There are conflicting reports about the number of Indigenous people living in the district at the time of white settlement, but in 1841, the population of the Mount Noorat clan numbered only four people. An outbreak of smallpox during the 1830s was one cause of the population decline and it has been suggested that an alleged massacre of Indigenous people by white settlers was another.\n\nFrederick Taylor, MacKillop and Smith's manager at Strathdownie was responsible for one of the worst massacres in the western district of Victoria somewhere along Mount Emu Creek (once known as Taylor's River) near Noorat in August 1839. This was verified by Niel Black, who found a mass grave on the Glenormiston property.\n\nThe settlement history of Noorat is closely linked with the Black family and the establishment of Glenormiston. Noorat ostensibly grew as a service centre for the Black family estate and many of the early residents either emigrated with Niel Black or worked at Glenormiston.\n\nThe post office opened on 1 August 1874 as Mount Noorat, and was renamed Noorat in 1875.\n\nNoted author, Alan Marshall, was born in Noorat's general store, in 1902.\n\nThere is currently one place of public worship in Noorat, the Neil Black Memorial Presbyterian Church.\n\nThe township has two schools, Noorat Primary School, and the Noorat campus of Mercy Regional College, which houses the year 7 and 8 students of the school. There is also the senior campus at Camperdown. The Glenormiston campus of South West Institute of TAFE is located a few kilometres north-east of the township, on the other side of the mountain.\n\nNoorat has a local football team, the Kolora-Noorat Power, who merged in 2002 from the Noorat Bombers and Kolora Magpies. They compete in the Warrnambool & District Football League. Their colours are teal, black and white.\n"}

{"id": "1981361", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1981361", "title": "Barton W. Stone", "text": "Barton W. Stone\n\nBarton Warren Stone (December 24, 1772 – November 9, 1844) was an American Evangelist during the early 19th-century Second Great Awakening in the United States. First ordained a Presbyterian minister, he and four other ministers of the Washington Presbytery resigned after arguments about doctrine and enforcement of policy by the Kentucky Synod. This was in 1803, after Stone had helped lead the mammoth Cane Ridge Revival, a several-day communion season attended by nearly 20,000 persons.\nStone and the others briefly founded the Springfield Presbytery, which they dissolved the following year, resigning from the Presbyterian Church altogether. They formed what they called the Christian Church, based on scripture rather than a creed representing the opinion of man. He later became allied with Alexander Campbell, a former Presbyterian minister who was also creating an independent path, sometimes allied with Baptists, and formed the Restoration Movement. Stone's followers were first called \"New Lights\" and \"Stoneites\". Later he and Campbell brought the groups together that relied solely on the Scriptures.\n\nSeveral church groups have historical roots in Stone's efforts. The three main groups are the Churches of Christ, the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), and the independent Christian churches and churches of Christ. Additionally, there are the International Churches of Christ, the International Christian Church, the Churches of Christ in Australia, the Churches of Christ in Europe, and the Evangelical Christian Church in Canada.\n\nStone was born to John and Mary Warren Stone near Port Tobacco, Maryland on December 24, 1772. His immediate family was upper-middle class, with connections to Maryland's upper class of planters. The first Protestant governor of Maryland, William Stone, was an ancestor and one of the signers of the United States Declaration of Independence; Thomas Stone was his second cousin.\n\nMary Stone was a member of the Church of England and Barton had been christened by a priest named Thomas Thornton. After Barton's father died in 1775, his mother moved the family to Pittsylvania County, Virginia in 1779, then on the frontier. After the move to the Virginia frontier during the war, Mary joined the Methodists. Barton was not himself notably religious as a young man; he found the competing claims of the Episcopalians, Baptists, and Methodists confusing, and was much more interested in politics.\n\nBarton entered the Caldwell Log College, in Greensboro, North Carolina, in 1790. While there, Stone heard James McGready (an evangelical Presbyterian minister) speak. A few years later, he was ordained as a Presbyterian minister.\n\nAs Stone looked more deeply into the beliefs of the Presbyterians, especially the Westminster Confession of Faith, he doubted that some of the church beliefs were truly Bible-based. He was unable to accept the Calvinistic doctrines of total depravity, unconditional election and predestination. He also believed that \"Calvinism's alleged theological sophistication had . . . been bought at the price of fomenting division\" and \"blamed it . . . for producing ten different sects within the Presbyterian tradition alone.\"\n\nThe huge Cane Ridge Revival of 1801 was \"set up as a traditional Presbyterian 'sacramental occasion',\" similar to the one he attended earlier that same year in Logan County which was later called the Revival of 1800. Like its predecessor, Cane Ridge continued for two to three days amid much fervor. Attracting an estimated 20,000 people, Stone was one of eighteen Presbyterian ministers, along with a number of Baptist and Methodist preachers who attended the participants. Traditional elements included the \"large number of ministers, the action sermon, the tables, the tent, the successive servings\" of communion, all part of the evangelical Presbyterian tradition and \"communion season\" known in Scotland.\n\nIn a disagreement with the Kentucky synod over its determination to censure a minister for what they said was deviation from doctrine of the Westminster Confession of Faith, in 1803 Stone and four other ministers formed the Springfield Presbytery. By 1804 the Springfield Presbytery had attracted 15 congregations in Ohio and Kentucky. The leaders of this newer presbytery became concerned by its growth, because they did not want to create a new denomination or \"party\". Ultimately convinced that their newer Springfield Presbytery was sectarian, the ministers dissolved it on June 28, 1804.\n\nTo publicize the dissolution, they signed a document entitled \"The Last Will and Testament of the Springfield Presbytery.\" This tract willed that \"this body die, be dissolved, and sink into union with the Body of Christ at large.\" It expressed the desire for Christian union and identified the Bible as the only standard of Christian faith and practice. In addition to signing the \"Last Will and Testament\", they agreed to take \"no other name than \"christians\"\" on the basis that it was \"the name first given by divine authority to the disciples of Christ.\" Soon, they adopted the name \"Christian\" to identify their group. Thus, remnants from the Springfield Presbytery eventually became known as the Christian Church. It is estimated that the Christian Church numbered about 12,000 by 1830.\n\nElias Smith had heard of the Stone movement by 1804, and the O'Kelly movement by 1808. The three groups \"declared themselves one\" by 1810. At that time the combined movement had a membership of approximately 20,000. This loose fellowship of churches was called by the names \"Christian Connection/Connexion\" or \"Christian Church.\"\n\nIn 1819 Stone moved with his family to Georgetown, Kentucky, where he had been hired as principal of the Rittenhouse academy , which became Georgetown College in 1829. In 1834 the Stones moved to Jacksonville, Illinois, in part to be able to free slaves whom his wife had inherited. This was not possible in Kentucky because they were attached to the estate. His mother-in-law's will bequeathed the slaves to his wife and her children in perpetuity in a way that placed them under the control of trustees. Moving to a free state allowed the Stones to emancipate them. Stone was a proponent of abolition and an active supporter of the American Colonization Society, which promoted sending free blacks to a colony in Africa (this was the basis of Liberia). By 1833 Stone had become disillusioned by the lack of success of the colonization efforts and began to support the immediate abolition of slavery.\n\nThe \"Christian\" movement associated with Stone merged with the \"Disciples\" movement led by Alexander Campbell in 1832. This was formalized at the High Street Meeting House in Lexington, Kentucky with a handshake between Barton W. Stone and \"Raccoon\" John Smith. Smith had been chosen, by those present, to speak in behalf of the followers of the Campbells. A preliminary meeting of the two groups was held in late December 1831, culminating with the merger on January 1, 1832. Campbell had been publishing the \"Christian Baptist\" since 1823, and Stone the \"Christian Messenger\" since 1826. Through these publications, they had begun bringing their followers closer together in uniting under Christ.\n\nWhen the Christians and Disciples united in 1832, only a minority of Christians from the Smith/Jones and O'Kelly movements participated. Those who did were from congregations on the frontier, west of the Appalachian Mountains, that had come into contact with the Stone movement. The eastern members had several key differences from the Stone and Campbell group: an emphasis on conversion experience, quarterly observance of communion, and nontrinitarianism.\n\nStone died on November 9, 1844 in Hannibal, Missouri at the home of his daughter. His body was buried on his farm in Morgan County, Illinois. When the farm was sold, descendants had his remains reinterred at Antioch Christian Church east of Jacksonville. In 1847 his remains were moved again and reinterred at Cane Ridge, Kentucky.\n\nA marble obelisk there is inscribed:\nThe church of Christ at Cane Ridge and other generous friends in Kentucky have caused this monument to be erected as a tribute of affection and gratitude to Barton W. Stone, minister of the gospel of Christ and the distinguished reformer of the nineteenth century. Born December 24, 1772: died November 9, 1844. His remains lie here. This monument erected in 1847.\n\nStone was ordained Presbyterian but rejected many things from the Westminster Confession of Faith. In particular he had issues with the classical view of the Trinity. He denied being Unitarian, Arian or Socinian but he did have a subordinationist view of Christ. In addition to his issues with the Trinity, he also took issue with the prevailing understanding of Christian Atonement. He did not believe that Jesus died in man's place as substitutionary sacrifice; his views are more in line with the \"moral influence theory\" of Charles Finney.\n\nStone outlined his views on the Trinity in a publication called \"An Address to the Christian Churches in Kentucky, Tennessee & Ohio on Several Important Doctrines of Religion\".\n\nStone's grandson, Charles Chilton Moore initially became a preacher in the tradition of his father and grandfather, but he later became one of America's most famous atheists and founded the Blue Grass Blade, a newspaper which he used to promote atheism and criticise religion. \n\n\n\n\n"}

The band is currently based in Hamilton, Ontario. From their formation in 1997 to 2016, The Trews were among the Top 150 selling Canadian artists in Canada and among the top 40 selling Canadian bands in Canada. \n\nThe band started their career with the name \"One I'd Trouser\", a line taken from a song in Monty Python's \"The Meaning of Life\". They changed their name to \"Trouser\" and eventually \"The Trews\". They released an EP as \"One I'd Trouser\", and a second EP under the name \"The Trews\".\n\nIn the early summer of 2002 the band entered Rocksearch, a high-profile contest that is held annually by CHTZ-FM, a St. Catharines (Southern Ontario) rock radio station. Winning the contest would prove to be their big break as they soon landed a recording contract with Bumstead Productions.\n\nThe release of their first full-length CD \"House of Ill Fame\" followed in 2003. Produced by Big Sugar's Gordie Johnson, the album contained the singles \"Every Inambition\", \"Not Ready to Go\", \"Tired of Waiting\", \"Fleeting Trust\" and \"Confessions\". \"Not Ready to Go\" hit number one on Canadian rock radio and was the most played song of 2004 in that format. The band was nominated as New Group of the Year at the 2004 Juno Awards and \"Not Ready to Go\" was nominated as Single of the Year in 2005. \"House Of Ill Fame\" has been certified gold in Canada. It was re-released with a bonus live album called \"The Live Cut\" which featured live versions of songs taken from the album.\n\nThe song \"Hollis and Morris\" on their first album, refers to an intersection in the city of Halifax and not an intersection in Antigonish as previously speculated. The band has mentioned during concerts and in interviews that the corner of Hollis and Morris is notorious for prostitution.\n\nThe band released a follow-up to \"House of Ill Fame\" on August 16, 2005. The album, \"Den of Thieves\", was produced by legendary producer Jack Douglas (Aerosmith, Cheap Trick, John Lennon, New York Dolls). The first single, \"So She's Leaving\", was released to radio June 28, 2005 and was followed by the singles \"Yearning\", which was their second single to reach number 1, \"Poor Ol' Broken Hearted Me\", and \"I Can't Say\".

In fall of the same year they were invited to open for Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant on his cross-Canada arena tour. \"Den of Thieves\" was certified Canadian Gold in April 2006. The album was released 18 April 2006 in the United States on Red Ink and Sony BMG.\n\nThe Trews were nominated in the Best New Band category in Classic Rock magazine's 2007 Classic Rock Roll of Honour Awards.

The album's only single, \"Sing Your Heart Out\", a new song written specifically for the performances, won Best AAA/Alternative Song at the 2010 International Acoustic Music Awards (US).\n\nFollowing \"Acoustic - Friends & Total Strangers\" the band released the single \"Highway Of Heroes\". It was inspired by the 2006 death of Capt. Nichola Goddard, the first Canadian female soldier killed in Afghanistan and a schoolmate of members of the Trews. It refers to the stretch of Highway 401 in Ontario, between CFB Trenton and downtown Toronto, where hundreds gather on bridges and overpasses to mourn soldiers killed in Afghanistan while the bodies of the fallen soldiers are transported from Trenton to the coroner's office in downtown Toronto.

The years playing with the Trews have been best years of my life. Countless hours in the jam space and playing thousands of live shows all over the world have shaped me as a musician, and playing with such great guys has made me a better human being. I will miss it very much.\n\nDue to unforeseen circumstances, I've decided to step down from the drum throne. Nothing weird goin' on here folks...just time to do what's best for me and the family. I wish the Trews nothing but the best, and was so fortunate to play with the best friggin' band in the country. I'll be hanging with you all in the crowd at the next show.\"\n\nGavin Maguire took over as the band's drummer.

It is the only large river of Latvia that begins and ends its flow in Latvia. Its length is 460 km, of which 1/5 or 93.5 km are in the Gauja National Park. In this part, the Gauja River flows through a spacious ancient Gauja valley, which is 1 to 2.5 km wide, and the maximum depth near Sigulda is 85 m. \nThe sandstone rocks on the banks of the Gauja and its adjoining rivers started forming 370 to 300 million years ago during the Devonian period.\n\nBefore 13th century the Gauja River used to serve as a trade route and border river between the Livonian and Latgalian lands. In some territories, they used to live mixed together. When Livonian languages were still present along the Gauja River and the sea, it used to be called \"Koivo\" (the Saint River). In Latvian, the name of the Gauja River used to mean 'a great amount', 'a crowd', and was therefore called the 'big river'. The Livonians suffered greatly during the Great Northern War and following plague in the 18th century. That was the period when the remaining Livonians assimilated with the Latvians.\n\nThe Gauja River tends to change its bed rapidly. Therefore, it has gained the reputation of being deceitful. The bed of the river is made of unconsolidated sand and gravel deposits that move along with the current. In some places, the bed is pebbly, thus forming impressive boulder rapids: Kazu, Raiskuma, Rakšu, and Ķūķu. The bottom of the river in Gauja National Park is 60 to 120 meters wide with a rapidly changing depth from 0.3 m to 7 m. The decline is 0.5 m/km. The speed of flow during low water is 0.2 to 0.4 m/s, and during the spring water period 2 to 3 m/s. Due to the fluctuations in water level, current speed, and special flow features, the Gauja River may be characterized as a rather non-homogeneous watercourse.\n\nUsually the Gauja River freezes over in the mid-December, and the ice starts moving in late March. During warm winters, the river does not freeze over. Much underground water flows into the Gauja River. It therefore has a lower water temperature than other large rivers in Latvia.\n\n"}

McGrath appeared in all 272 episodes in the eight seasons of the series, which had ended its run only two years before his death. McGrath's Wooster character hence provided the meals and companionship for both fictional trail masters, Ward Bond as Seth Adams and John McIntire as Christopher \"Chris\" Hale.\n\nMcGrath was born in Mound City in Holt County in far northwestern Missouri.\n\nHis first role, uncredited, was in the 1932 film, \"The Rainbow Trail\", a study of Mormon polygamy based on a 1915 Zane Grey novel of the same name.

The refuge is located in the San Luis Valley south of the town of Monte Vista, Colorado in southeastern Rio Grande County, Colorado, in the watershed of the Rio Grande. It was established in 1953 by the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission to provide a habitat for wildlife, particularly waterfowl, in the San Luis Valley.\n\nThe site was historically an agricultural area and thus water is intensively managed on the refuge, especially in comparison to the nearby Alamosa refuge. Irrigation includes numerous dikes and other water control structures that provide water to a patchwork of diverse wetland habitats ranging from shallow wet meadows to open water. The refuge includes Artesian wells, pumped wells and irrigation canals, some dating to the \"ditch boom\" of the 1880s. The refuge is a major stopover for migrating greater sandhill cranes moving between their wintering area around Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge in New Mexico and breeding grounds in the northern United States and southern Canada. Up to 20,000 cranes pass through in the spring and again in the fall. Three remaining endangered whooping cranes from a failed attempt to establish a wild migratory population in the 1980s can be seen migrating with their foster species, the sandhill crane. Beginning in the l980s, a herd of elk began using the refuge. At present, several hundred elk may be seen on the refuge seeking winter food and sanctuary from hunting pressure on nearby public lands.\n"}

{"id": "1981438", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1981438", "title": "Firpo Marberry", "text": "Firpo Marberry\n\nFrederick \"Firpo\" Marberry (November 30, 1898 – June 30, 1976) was an American right-handed starting and relief pitcher in Major League Baseball from to , most notably with the Washington Senators. The sport's first prominent reliever, he has been retroactively credited as having been the first pitcher to record 20 saves in a season, the first to make 50 relief appearances in a season or 300 in a career, and the only pitcher to lead the major leagues in saves six times. Since relief pitching was still seen as a lesser calling in a time when starters were only removed when clearly ineffective, Marberry also started 187 games in his career, posting a 94–52 record as a starter for a .644 winning percentage. He pitched in later years for the Detroit Tigers (1933–1935) and New York Giants (1936) before ending his career in Washington.\n\nBorn in Streetman, Texas, he became well-known around the majors for the scowl he seemed to constantly have on his face that sometimes frightened batters; his appearance and demeanor reminded observers of boxer Luis Firpo, earning Marberry the nickname for which he often expressed disdain.\n\nLike many players, right-handed Marberry started and ended his career with the same ballclub, the Senators. When he first came up in August , Marberry was effective in innings pitched for the remainder of the season. He went 4–0 that year, proving himself ready for the pros. An 11–12 season with a 3.09 ERA came the year after, which might have seemed fairly average in that era were it not for his relief work, which saw him save 15 games – a new major league record, although it was not realized at the time. Marberry's role was crucial in helping the Senators reach the World Series for the first time in franchise history.\nIn the 1924 World Series against the Giants, Marberry was thrown into a difficult situation in his first appearance; after the Senators had taken a 3–1 lead going into the 9th inning of Game 2 at Griffith Stadium, starter Tom Zachary allowed the Giants to score twice to tie the game. Marberry came in to strike out Travis Jackson to end the inning, and the Senators scored in the bottom of the 9th to tie the Series; Zachary was credited with the win, although modern rules would have credited it to Marberry. The next day, Marberry started Game 3 at the Polo Grounds, but suffered from two unearned runs in the 2nd inning, was pulled for a pinch hitter in the top of the 4th while trailing 3–1, and was charged with the loss. He rebounded in Game 4 the next day, however, entering in the 8th inning with a 7–2 lead and closing out the victory to again tie the Series.\n\nHe showed his mettle in Game 7 at Griffith Stadium, entering with two men on base and no one out in the 6th inning, leading 1–0. Although the Giants scored three times in the inning, two of the runs were unearned, and Marberry effectively shut the Giants down through top of the 8th, being pulled for a pinch hitter as the Senators tied the score in the bottom of the inning. Legendary Walter Johnson came in for the 9th inning, and redeemed himself after two losses in the Series by shutting out New York for four innings; the Senators scored in the bottom of the 12th to take what would be the only World Series title in Washington history. Marberry ended the Series with a 1.12 ERA in 4 games.\n\nMarberry came back with another remarkable season in , again saving 15 games to tie his own record as the Senators won their second consecutive pennant. But although he allowed no runs in 2 appearances, Washington dropped the Series to the Pittsburgh Pirates, again going seven games. Marberry had an excellent year in , breaking his own record again with 22 saves and posting a 3.00 ERA, the lowest of his career (besides his brief 1923 season) in an era which strongly favored hitters. He also took over the major league record for career saves, with 52. After two subpar seasons, he came back in to again lead the American League with 11 saves, while also winning a career-high 19 to finish 4th in the AL.\nMarberry was never a full-time starter, but was often considered one of the few great pitchers that could go back and forth from the bullpen to being a starter, since there were so few of his era. In and , Marberry was employed primarily as a starter, and posted an overall record of 31–9 for the two seasons. In 1931, showcasing his talents as both a starter (25 starts), and a reliever (20 appearances), he posted a 16–4 record with a 3.45 ERA (5th in the league) and 88 strikeouts. While he picked up 11 complete games and 1 shutout as a starter, he also had 7 saves, and finished 13th in MVP voting (Lefty Grove won the award).\n\nAfter again leading the league in saves in , for the fifth and last time, he was traded to Detroit on December 14. With the Tigers, Marberry adjusted well to the move from pitcher-friendly Griffith Stadium to Tiger Stadium, and posted a record of 31–16 in his first two years before his career faded away. After appearing in only 5 games for Detroit in 1935, Marberry was offered a job as an AL umpire, and he did serve in that capacity for the remainder of the season, though never in a Washington game. He made a single relief appearance for the Giants in before ending his career on June 10 in the town that had come to love him, Washington, D.C.\n\nOn May 6, 1934, Marberry allowed a record-tying four consecutive triples to the Boston Red Sox. The four hitters were Carl Reynolds, Moose Solters, Rick Ferrell, and Bucky Walters.\n\nIn a 14-season career, Marberry had a lifetime record of 148–88 with a 3.63 ERA in 551 games (187 starts), accumulating 86 complete games and 7 shutouts. His career records of 364 relief appearances and 101 saves – both more than double the previous records – were surpassed by Jack Russell in and Johnny Murphy in respectively. He struck out 822 batters in 2067-1/3 innings pitched. Marberry would not begin to gain true recognition for many of his accomplishments until the save was created as a pitching statistic in the 1960s, and later research was done to identify saves earned in the past. \n\nAs a hitter, Marberry posted a .192 batting average (128-for-668) with 60 runs, 21 doubles, 3 triples, 1 home run, 65 RBI and 22 bases on balls in 551 games. He finished his career with a .965 fielding percentage.\n\nHe died of a stroke at age 77 in Mexia, Texas, and was buried in Birdston Cemetery near Streetman.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1981458", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1981458", "title": "Ziziphus mauritiana", "text": "Ziziphus mauritiana\n\nZiziphus mauritiana, also known as Chinese date, Chinee apple, Indian plum, Indian jujube and dunks is a tropical fruit tree species belonging to the family Rhamnaceae.\n\n\"Ziziphus mauritiana\" is a spiny, evergreen shrub or small tree up to 15 m high, with trunk 40 cm or more in diameter; spreading crown; stipular spines and many drooping branches. The fruit is of variable shape and size. It can be oval, obovate, oblong or round, and can be 1-2.5 in (2.5-6.25 cm) long, depending on the variety. The flesh is white and crisp. When slightly underipe, this fruit is a bit juicy and has a pleasant aroma. The fruit's skin is smooth, glossy, thin but tight.\n\nThe species is believed to have originated in Indo-Malaysian region of South-East Asia. It is now widely naturalised throughout the Old World tropics from Southern Africa through the Middle East to the Indian Subcontinent and China, Indomalaya, and into Australasia and the Pacific Islands. It can form dense stands and become invasive in some areas, including Fiji and Australia and has become a serious environmental weed in Northern Australia. It is a fast-growing tree with a medium lifespan, that can quickly reach up to 10–40 ft (3 to 12 m) tall.\n\n\"Ziziphus mauritiana\" is a medium-sized tree that grows vigorously and has a rapidly developing taproot, a necessary adaptation to drought conditions. The species varies widely in height, from a bushy shrub 1.5 to 2 m tall, to a tree 10 to 12 m tall with a trunk diameter of about 30 cm. \"Z. mauritiana\" may be erect or wide-spreading, with gracefully drooping thorny branches, zigzag branchlets, thornless or set with short, sharp straight or hooked spines.\n\nThe leaves are alternate, ovate or oblong elliptic with rounded apex, with 3 depressed longitudinal veins at the base. The leaves are about 2.5 to 3.2 cm long and 1.8 to 3.8 cm wide having fine tooth at margin. It is dark-green and glossy on the upper side and pubescent and pale-green to grey-green on the lower side. Depending on the climate, the foliage of the \"Z. mauritiana\" may be evergreen or deciduous.\n\nThe flowers are tiny, yellow, 5-petalled and are usually in twos and threes in the leaf axils. Flowers are white or greenish white and the fruits are orange to brown, 2–3 cm long, with edible white pulp surrounding a 2-locular pyrene.\n\nThis quick growing tree starts producing fruits within three years. The fruit is a soft, juicy, drupe that is 2.5 cm diameter, though in some cultivars the fruit size may reach up to 6.25 cm long and 4.5 cm wide. The form may be oval, obovate, round or oblong; the skin smooth or rough, glossy, thin but tough. The fruit ripen at different times even on a single tree. Fruits are first green, turning yellow as they ripen. The fully mature fruit is entirely red, soft, juicy with wrinkled skin and has a pleasant aroma. The ripe fruit is sweet and sour in taste. Both flesh texture and taste are reminiscent of apples. When under ripe the flesh is white and crispy, acid to subacid to sweet in taste. Fully ripe fruits are less crisp and somewhat mealy; overripe fruits are wrinkled, the flesh buff-coloured, soft, spongy and musky. At first the aroma is apple like and pleasant but it becomes peculiarly musky when overripe. There is a single, hard, oval or oblate, rough central stone which contains 2 elliptic, brown seeds, 1/4 in (6mm) long.\n\n\"Ziziphus mauritiana\" is a hardy tree that copes with extreme temperatures and thrives under rather dry conditions with an annual rainfall of 6 to 88.5 in (15–225 cm). In Fiji, sometimes naturalised Ber trees grow along roadsides and in agricultural land, usually near sea level but occasionally up to an elevation of about 600 m. It also grows well on laterite, medium black soils with good drainage, or sandy, gravelly, alluvial soil of dry river-beds where it is vigorously spontaneous. In Australia, this species grows on a wide variety of soil types, including cracking clays, solodic soils and deep alluvials, in the tropics and sub-tropics where the average annual rainfall is in the range 470-1200mm. In the drier parts of this range, it grows best in riparian zones. Commercial cultivation usually extends up to 1000 m. Beyond this elevation trees do not perform well, and cultivation becomes less economical.\n\nThe tree has a high tolerance to both water-logging and drought and can grow where annual rainfall ranges from 125 to 2,225 mm, but is more widespread in areas with an annual rainfall of 300 to 500 mm. In China and India, wild trees are found up to an elevation of 5,400 ft (1,650 m). In India, the minimum shade temperature for survival is 7–13° and the maximum temperature is 50 °C. Studies report that this species flourishes in alkaline soils with a pH as high as 9.2. However, deep sandy loam to loamy soils with neutral or slightly alkaline pH are considered optimum for growth. In India, the tree grows best on sandy loam, neutral or slightly alkaline.\n\nSome cultivars attain anthesis early in the morning, others do so later in the day. The flowers are protandrous. Hence, fruit set depends on cross-pollination by insects attracted by the fragrance and nectar. Pollen of the Indian jujube is thick and heavy. It is not airborne but is transferred from flower to flower by honeybees. The flowers are pollinated by ants and other insects, and in the wild state the trees do not set fruits by self-pollination. Best propagates by seeds, seedlings, direct sowing, root suckers as well as by cuttings. Ber seeds are spread by birds, native animals, stock, feral pigs and humans who eat the fruit and expel the seeds. Seeds may remain viable for 2½ years but the rate of germination declines with age. Cross-incompatibility occurs, and cultivars have to be matched for good fruit set; some cultivars produce good crops parthenocarpically.\n\n\"Ziziphus mauritiana\" is one of the two \"Ziziphus\" species that have considerable horticulture importance, the other being Chinese jujube (\"Z. jujuba\"). Indian jujube (\"Z. mauritiana\") is more tropical, whereas Chinese jujube is a more cold hardy species.\n\nIn India, there are 90 or more cultivars, varying in the habit of the tree; leaf shape; fruit form, size, color, flavor and keeping quality; and fruiting season. Among the important cultivars, eleven are described in the encyclopaedic \"Wealth of India\": 'Banarasi (or Banarsi) Pewandi', 'Dandan', 'Kaithli' ('Patham'), 'Muria Mahrara', 'Narikelee', 'Nazuk', 'Sanauri 1', 'Sanauri 5', 'Thornless' and 'Umran' ('Umri'). The skin of most is smooth and greenish-yellow to yellow.\n\nPropagation is most commonly from seed, where pretreatment is beneficial. Storage of the seed for 4 months to let it after-ripen improves germination. The hard stone restricts germination and cracking the shell or extraction of seeds hastens germination. Without pretreatment the seeds normally germinate within six weeks whereas extracted seeds only need one week to germinate\n\nSeedlings to be used as rootstock can be raised from seed. Several studies indicate that germination can be improved by soaking seeds in sulfuric acid. Germination time can also be shortened to 7 days by carefully cracking the endocarp. Ber seedlings do not tolerate transplanting, therefore the best alternatives are to sow the seeds directly in the field or to use polythene tubes placed in the nursery bed. Seedlings are ready for budding in 3 to 4 months. In addition, seedlings from the wild cultivars can be converted into improved cultivars by top-working and grafting. Nurseries are used for large scale seedling multiplication and graft production. The seedlings should also be given full light. The seedlings may need as long as 15 months in the nursery before planting in the field.\n\nScientists in India have standardised propagation techniques for Ber establishment. Budding is the easiest method of vegetative propagation used for improved cultivars. Different types of budding techniques have been utilised with ring-budding and shield-budding being the most successful. Wild varieties of ber are usually used as the root-stock. The most common being Z. rotundifolia in India and Z. spina-christi in Africa.\n\nPlants are capable of seed production once they reach a height of about 1 metre. Wild-growing plants in northern Australia may take 8 years to reach this size. In Australia, plants growing under natural conditions are capable of producing seeds once they reach a height of about 1m. Plants between 1 and 2m high produce, on average, less than five fruits per season. Large plants (>5m high) can produce 5000 or more fruits in a single season.\n\nIn India, some types ripen as early as October, others from mid-February to mid-March, others in March, or mid-March, to the end of April. In the Assiut Governorate, there are 2 crops a year, the main in early spring, the second in the fall. In India the trees flower in July to October and fruits are formed soon after. In February–March the fruits are mature and in some places a second crop is produced in the fall. Pickings are done by hand from ladders and about 110 lbs (50 kg)is harvested per day. The fruits remaining on the tree are shaken down. Only fully mature fruits are picked directly from the tree. They are transported in open bags to avoid fermentation.\n\nSeedling trees bear 5,000 to 10,000 small fruits per year in India. Superior grafted trees may yield as many as 30,000 fruits. The best cultivar in India, with fruits normally averaging 30 to the lb (66 to the kg), yields 175 lbs (77 kg) annually. Special cultural treatment increases both fruit size and yield.\n\nThe major production regions for Indian jujube are the arid and semi arid regions of India. From 1984 to 1995 with improved cultivars the production was 0.9 million tonnes on a land of 88,000 ha. The crop is also grown in Pakistan, Bangladesh and parts of Africa. Trees in northern India yield 80 to 200 kg of fresh fruit/tree/year when the trees are in their prime bearing age of 10–20 years.\n\nThe fruit is eaten raw, pickled or used in beverages. It is quite nutritious and rich in vitamin C. It is second only to guava and much higher than citrus or apples. In India, the ripe fruits are mostly consumed raw, but are sometimes stewed. Slightly underripe fruits are candied by a process of pricking, immersing in a salt solution. Ripe fruits are preserved by sun-drying and a powder is prepared for out-of-season purposes. It contains 20 to 30% sugar, up to 2.5% protein and 12.8% carbohydrates. Fruits are also eaten in other forms, such as dried, candied, pickled, as juice, or as ber butter. In Ethiopia, the fruits are used to stupefy fish.\n\nThe leaves are readily eaten by camels, cattle and goats and are considered nutritious.\n\nIn India and Queensland, the flowers are rated as a minor source of nectar for honeybees. The honey is light and of fair flavor.\n\nBer timber is hard, strong, fine-grained, fine-textured, tough, durable, and reddish in colour. It has been used to line wells, to make legs for bedsteads, boat ribs, agricultural implements, tool handles, and other lathe-turned items. The branches are used as framework in house construction and the wood makes good charcoal with a heat content of almost 4,900 kcal per kg. In addition, this species is used as firewood in many areas. In tropical Africa, the flexible branches are wrapped as retaining bands around conical thatched roofs of huts, and are twined together to form thorny corral walls to retain livestock.\nThe fruits are applied on cuts and ulcers; are employed in pulmonary ailments and fevers; and, mixed with salt and chili peppers, are given in indigestion and biliousness. The dried ripe fruit is a mild laxative. The seeds are sedative and are taken, sometimes with buttermilk, to halt nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pains in pregnancy. They check diarrhea, and are poulticed on wounds. Mixed with oil, they are rubbed on rheumatic areas. The leaves are applied as poultices and are helpful in liver troubles, asthma and fever and, together with catechu, are administered when an astringent is needed, as on wounds. The bitter, astringent bark decoction is taken to halt diarrhea and dysentery and relieve gingivitis. The bark paste is applied on sores. The root is purgative. A root decoction is given as a febrifuge, taenicide and emmenagogue, and the powdered root is dusted on wounds. Juice of the root bark is said to alleviate gout and rheumatism. Strong doses of the bark or root may be toxic. An infusion of the flowers serves as an eye lotion.\n\nThe fatty-acid methyl ester of \"Z. mauritiana\" seed oil meets all of the major biodiesel requirements in the USA (ASTM D 6751-02, ASTM PS 121-99), Germany (DIN V 51606) and European Union (EN 14214). The average oil yield is 4.95 kg oil/tree or 1371 kg oil/hectare, and arid or semi-arid regions may be utilised due to its drought resistance.\n\nThe greatest enemies of the jujube are fruit flies. Some cultivars are much more susceptible than others, the flies preferring the largest, sweetest fruits. 100% of those may be attacked, while on a neighbouring tree bearing a smaller, less-sweet type, only 2% of the crop may be damaged. The larvae pupate in the soil and it has been found that treatment of the ground beneath the tree helps reduce the problem. Control is possible with regular and effective spraying of insecticide.\n\nA leaf-eating caterpillar and the green slug caterpillar attack the foliage. Mites form scale-like galls on twigs, retarding growth and reducing the fruit crop. Lesser pests include a small caterpillar, \"Meridarches scyrodes\", that bores into the fruit.\n\nThe tree is subject to shrouding by a parasitic vine . Powdery mildew causes defoliation and fruit-drop, but it can be adequately controlled. Lesser diseases are sooty mould, brown rot and leaf-spot. Leafspot results from infestation by \"Cercospora\" spp. and \"Isariopsis indica\" var. \"zizyphi\". In 1973, a witches'-broom disease caused by a mycoplasma-like organism was found in jujube plants near Poona University. It proved to be transmitted by grafting or budding diseased scions onto healthy \"Z. mauritiana\" seedlings. Leaf rust, caused by \"Phakopsora zizyphivulgaris\", ranges from mild to severe on all commercial cultivars in the Punjab.\n\nIn storage, the fruits may be spotted by fungi. Fruit rots are caused by \"Fusarium\" spp., \"Nigrospora oryzae\", \"Epicoccum nigrum\", and \"Glomerella cingulata\".\n\n"}

During the 1970s and 1980s, the New York City Subway had high rates of crime, as did the rest of the city; the passageway similarly experienced high crime rates. The passageway, with only two exits–one at each end–was located under 33nd Street and was called the \"Gimbels passageway\" because it was next to the basements of the Gimbels department store and the Hotel Pennsylvania. This passageway was closed in the 1980s after an epidemic of sexual assaults, and passengers now must walk at street level to connect to the commuter railroads and Amtrak. A real estate developer, Vornado Realty Trust, proposed in 2010 to reopen the passageway in exchange for variances to build office towers replacing existing structures in the area.\n\nThe pathway to Bryant Park was outside of fare control, but was intended to relieve passenger flow at the 42nd and 34th Street stations. In the 1980s, the passageway became a gathering spot for homeless people and drug users. The passageway was closed on March 23, 1991 after a rape.\n\nOn November 28, 1969, the turnstiles and exit gates at the northern end of the station were relocated, making four more staircases from the Broadway Line platforms available for transfers to the Sixth Avenue platforms. Previously, transfers could only be made from two staircases.\n\nThis complex was overhauled in the late 1970s. The Transit Authority fixed the station's structure and renovated its appearance. The overhaul replaced the original wall tiles, old signs, and incandescent lighting to the 1970s modern look wall tile band and tablet mosaics, signs and fluorescent lights. It also fixed staircases and platform edges. In the early 1990s, the station received another major repair, which included an upgrade for ADA-accessibility and modernized wall tiling. The MTA repaired the staircases, re-tiling for the walls, installed new tiling on the floors, upgraded the station's lights and the public address system, installing ADA safety threads along the platform edge, new signs, and new track-beds in both directions.\n34th Street–Herald Square on the BMT Broadway Line is an express station that has four tracks and two island platforms. This level opened several years after the opening of the Port Authority Trans-Hudson station; the Sixth Avenue line platforms were built later.\n\nEach platform has three staircases and one elevator to the main mezzanine on the north half and another staircase at the extreme south end to 32nd Street. North of the station are diamond crossovers in both directions that are used by N trains on weekdays when they operate express in Manhattan.\n\nBecause Queens-bound N trains switch from the express to the local track north of this station, trains are often held here until another train arrives on the opposite track. Depending on the schedule, they may not leave in the same order in which they arrived. This causes confusion among riders as they run back and forth on the northbound platform trying to catch the train that will leave first. This is also true at other stations where two services that run to the same destination stop at the same platform but do not stop on the same side of the platform, such as Franklin Avenue (southbound 2 and 5 trains), Canal Street (A, C and E trains), 59th Street–Columbus Circle (southbound B and D trains), Queens Plaza (E, M and R trains) and Essex Street (outbound J/Z and M trains). \"The New York Times\" calls this \"The Subway Shuffle\".\n\nIn 1996, artist Christopher Janney installed \"REACH New York, An Urban Musical Instrument.\" The piece consists of green racks with sensors hanging along the platforms. Waving one's hands in front of the sensors creates a corresponding sound from the rack.\n\n34th Street–Herald Square on the IND Sixth Avenue Line is an express station that has four tracks and two island platforms. The mezzanine elevators are at the north end of the station while the staircases to the Manhattan Mall entrance are at the south end. The platforms have numerous stairs and escalators leading to the main mezzanine. Stairs on both platforms lead to a non-accessible ramp leading to the mezzanine.\n\nThe platforms are not equal in length, as the northbound one is longer than the southbound one. North of this station are numerous crossovers and switches that allow trains from uptown to terminate here on the express tracks during construction and closures.\n\nDuring construction on the IND portion of this station, contractors had to counter problems in their path. For one, the BMT and PATH platforms existed decades before this portion of the station was completed. Constructors had to dig deeper in order to pass the original platforms without interference, as well as avoiding wires and pipes.\n\nPrior to the opening of the Chrystie Street Connection in November 1967, the express tracks only extended to bumper blocks about south of this station, though the tunnels extended for another beyond that.\n\nAbove the northbound local tracks is \"Yab-Yum\", a series of red propeller-like sculptures, designed to spin in the wind of the approaching trains below.\nOn August 28, 2004, Shahawar Matin Siraj and James Elshafay were arrested for planning to bomb the Herald Square station during the 2004 Republican National Convention. Elshafay cooperated with prosecutors and received a plea deal; Siraj was convicted of conspiracy on four counts, the most serious of which was plotting to bomb a public transportation system, in 2006 and was sentenced to 30 years in prison in 2007.\n\n\n"}

The voice is generally presumed to be that of God the Father. This is one of only two times in the Gospel of Matthew where God intervenes directly, the other being . This is in contrast to most of the Old Testament where God's direct actions occur regularly. Hill notes that the word \"beloved\" can be interpreted as meaning \"only\". The entire message is often seen as a reference to . There is also a possible link to , which also speaks of a beloved of whom God is pleased. Matthew uses this verse at , and it is translated in the same manner as it is here. There are also possible links to and .\n\nJesus' divine status was earlier implied at , but it does not become known to those around him until much later in the narrative. There is thus a debate over whether the voice in this verse was public pronouncement. In Luke the baptism occurs in front of a large crowd, but he and Mark both make the announcement seem private by having the message read \"you are my son.\" Matthew's \"this is my son\" makes it seem as though all present were addressed. In Matthew no crowds are mentioned, and only Jesus and John are noted as being at the Jordan. The gospel is thus internally consistent, but is somewhat difficult to reconcile with the other two synoptics.\n\nThis verse, when combined with the one before it, is seen by many Christians as one of the most trinitarian passages in the entire New Testament but some disagree. already has the Holy Ghost present in the form of a dove. This verse does not clearly distinguish it as a distinct entity, the voice is assumed to be \"God, the heavenly father\", who makes explicit reference to Jesus as his son.\n\nSome early manuscripts containing the text of this verse are:\n\n"}

It is within the Sangre de Cristo National Heritage Area.\n\nMany bird species such as the kestrel, great horned owl, northern flicker, robin, yellow warbler, and Bullock's oriole roam in the riparian areas of this refuge. Waterfowl that inhabit here include mallard, pintail, teal, Canada goose, avocet, killdeer, white-faced ibis, egret, and heron.\n\nThe wildlife refuge is located on the lands of the Luis Maria Baca Grant No. 4 near Crestone, Colorado in the San Luis Valley in southern Saguache and northern Alamosa counties, about northeast of the town of Alamosa, on the west side of the Sangre de Cristo Range.\n\nThe site was authorized by the United States Congress in 2000 as part of legislation that also authorized the nearby Great Sand Dunes National Park. It was formally established in 2003 when administration began under the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. It is administered jointly with the nearby Alamosa and Monte Vista National Wildlife Refuges, as part of the Alamosa/Baca/Monte Verde Complex.\nThe Baca National Wildlife Refuge consists of rangeland and some riparian wetlands. The original ranch headquarters and other buildings are on the wildlife refuge. As is usual on federal wildlife refuges, grazing and hay production continue on a limited basis. It includes several thousand acres of irrigated hay meadows.\n\nSeveral streams arising in the nearby Sangre de Cristos flow onto the Refuge. Crestone Creek in its lower reaches is a spring-fed perennial stream inhabited by four native fish species: Rio Grande sucker (Catostomus plebeius), Rio Grande chub (Gila pandora), fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), and longnose dace (Rhinichthys cataractae)\n\nThe establishment of the refuge and national park was part of complex land transfers undertaken by the federal government in cooperation with the Nature Conservancy and the State of Colorado. Approximately of the land was previously under the management of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and was transferred to the Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nApproximately of the land for the refuge and park was part of the historic Baca Ranch and was purchased by the Nature Conservancy before its transfer to the federal government. The refuge forms part of complex of wetlands in the San Luis Valley consists of lands of nearby landowners, including the Colorado Board of Land Commissioners, the National Park Service, and the Nature Conservancy.\n\nThe mineral rights to the lands of the Baca NWR are owned by a third party, Lexam Explorations (U.S.A.) Inc. (Lexam). There is believed to be a small chance that commercial quantities of natural gas may be discovered (An existing artesian well on the land, called \"the gas well\", produced enough gas to heat one home).\n\nLitigation by the San Luis Valley Ecosystem Council contesting the environmental assessment with respect to the drilling of two exploratory wells resulted in a settlement in September, 2010 requiring preparation of a new assessment by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Completion of a draft environmental assessment was announced by the Fish and Wildlife Service on January 7, 2011 and was made available for download or viewing at the refuge's website.\n\nProposed executive summary:\nImplementation of the Preferred Alternative – the Service is requiring that specific protective measures and standards are followed during all phases of oil and gas exploration being proposed by Lexam, including the intended drilling of two exploratory gas wells on the Refuge, to ensure maximum protection of the surface estate (including all surface and subsurface natural resources not considered minerals) of the Refuge and associated cultural, socioeconomic, and aesthetic resources from unreasonable degradation or impacts. With these requirements incorporated into Lexam’s Plan of Operations, potential impacts are expected to be less than significant in regards to NEPA. Information gathered in this Draft EA indicates that the temporary nature of the proposed exploration (<180 days), along with implementation of the preferred alternative, will not unreasonably degrade or result in significant impacts to the surface estate (including all surface and subsurface natural resources not considered to be minerals) of the Refuge and associated cultural, socioeconomic, and aesthetic resources.\n\nA public meeting was held in January 2011 at the Colorado College Baca Campus Conference Center in Crestone, Colorado. It was an informational open house with a presentation by the Fish and Wildlife Service followed by a question-and-answer session. Written comments regarding the environmental assessment were accepted at this meeting.\n\"There’s no legal way to say ‘no’ for that mineral owner to access those minerals,\" [Mike Blenden, Project Leader, San Luis Valley NWR Complex] said. \n\nComments can also be sent via mail to David Lucas, Chief, Division of Refuge Planning, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Division of Refuge Planning, P.O. Box 25484, Denver, CO 80225-0486 or via email to: BacaDraftEAComments at fws.gov and must be received no later than February 7, 2011.\n\nThe draft assessment includes consideration of the option of purchasing the mineral rights but rejects the $8.4 million demanded by Lexam as not a fair market price. By the terms of a Federal District Court settlement the final environmental assessment is due April 1, 2011.\n\n"}

Following his visit to Bayreuth in the summer of 1876, he composed it in Moscow in fewer than three weeks. It is dedicated to his friend and former pupil Sergei Taneyev. It was first performed early in 1877 in Moscow in a concert by the Russian Musical Society, conducted by Nikolai Rubinstein.\n\nIn this fantasia, Tchaikovsky presents a symphonic interpretation of the tragic tale of Francesca da Rimini, a beauty who was immortalized in Dante's \"Divine Comedy\". In the fifth canto of Inferno, Dante the narrator meets the shade of Francesca da Rimini, a noblewoman who fell in love with the brother of her cruel husband. After the lovers were discovered and killed in revenge by the husband, they were condemned to Hell for their adulterous passions. In their damnation, the lovers are trapped together in a violent storm, whirled through the air around the second circle of Hell, never to touch the ground again. They are tormented most of all by the ineradicable memory of the joys and pleasures of the embraces they shared in life.\n\nIn writing \"Francesca da Rimini\", Tchaikovsky expressed a poignant identification with the heroine and her tragic fate, a sympathy which was also dramatically evoked in his ballet \"Swan Lake\" and the \"Romeo and Juliet\" Fantasy-Overture.\n\nThis symphonic poem, perhaps more than any other of Tchaikovsky's works, shows the possible influence of Franz Liszt, both musically and in terms of subject matter, and Richard Wagner, whose music dramas Tchaikovsky had traveled to Bayreuth to review. Liszt frequently chose subjects of a Gothic, diabolical nature: the \"Totentanz\" (1849), Sonata \"Après une lecture de Dante\" (1856), and \"Dante Symphony\" (1857) are cases in point. Tchaikovsky's use of swirling chromaticism in the depiction of the winds of the second circle of Hell also resembles Liszt, as well as Edvard Grieg's depiction of a stormy evening in his incidental music to act 5 of the play \"Peer Gynt\". As for Wagner, while Tchaikovsky generally did not care for his work, he freely acknowledged its influence on \"Francesca\" to Taneyev.\n\nThe piece has a duration of around 25 minutes.\n\nThe music is scored for 3 flutes (third doubling piccolo), 2 oboes, English horn, 2 clarinets in A, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 2 cornets in A, 2 trumpets in E, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, bass drum, cymbals, tam tam, harp and strings.\n\nThis symphonic poem has basically three parts, with a small introduction. \n\nIn the introduction the basses and the wind section of the orchestra open in dark tones suggesting the beginning of Dante's \"Inferno\", where the author is astray from the right path into somber woods. As the music continues into the first section, the horror felt by Dante is portrayed in the music as he walks in deeper and deeper into the first circles of Hell. In the second section, the tempo picks up, the narrative takes the audience into the second circle, where Dante finds, amongst others, such as Tristan and Isolde, Paolo Malatesta and Francesca da Rimini (née da Polenta) trapped together in a violent storm, whirled through the air around, violently crushed against ragged stone walls for eternity. In the third section, the music subsides, depicting Dante's request to speak with the doomed lovers (depicted by a solo clarinet), who recount their story of how Francesca was unwittingly married by proxy to Gianciotto Malatesta, Paolo's older, cruel and unattractive brother; the music continues to depict how they were unable to resist their fleshly attraction for each other and succumbed to their passion while reading a passage of the story of Queen Guinevere and Sir Lancelot [another pair of equally doomed lovers], depicted by the wind section supported by the strings in the moments of highest passion. The music also depicts the moment of their murder at the hands of Gianciotto, depicted by fast playing \"bassi\" and cymbals, followed by sombre horns in a requiem like theme. After their tale is over, the final section starts, depicting the eternal punishment that continues once more, leaving Dante (and the audience) in a state of shock depicted by the ominous \"tutti\" of the orchestra.\n\n\nOn the 8 May 2010 broadcast of BBC 3's \"CD Review\", reporter Jonathan Swain surveyed recordings of \"Francesca di Rimini\" and recommended the 2007 recording by the Orchestra dell'Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia conducted by Antonio Pappano as the best available choice.\n\n"}

Cohen (born June 11, 1956) is an American billionaire hedge fund manager, art-collector, and philanthropist. He is the founder of hedge fund Point72 Asset Management and now-closed S.A.C. Capital Advisors, both based in Stamford, Connecticut. He owns one of the world's most valuable private art collections, worth over $1 billion, which includes notable artworks such a Koons's \"Rabbit\", Picasso's \"Le Rêve\", and Hirst's \"The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living\".\n\nIn 2013, the Cohen-founded S.A.C. Capital Advisors pleaded guilty to insider trading and agreed to pay $1.8bn in fines (900M in forfeiture and 900M in fines) in one of the biggest criminal cases against a hedge fund. Cohen was prohibited from managing outside money for 2 years as part of the settlement reached in the civil case over his accountability for the scandal. The hedge fund agreed to plead guilty to wire fraud and four counts of securities fraud and to close to outside investors.\n\n\"Time\" Magazine ranked him 94th on its annual Time 100 list of most influential people in 2007. As of February 2020, he has an estimated net worth of US$14.1 billion.\n\nCohen grew up in a Jewish family in Great Neck, New York, where his father was a dress manufacturer in Manhattan's garment district, and his mother was a piano teacher. He is the third of seven brothers and sisters. He took a liking to poker as a high school student, often betting his own money in tournaments, and credits the game with teaching him how \"to take risks.\" Cohen received an economics degree from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in 1978. While in school, a friend helped him open a brokerage account with $1,000 of his tuition money.\n\nIn 1978, after graduating from Wharton, Cohen got a Wall Street job as a junior trader in the options arbitrage department at Gruntal & Co. His first day on the job at Gruntal & Co., he made an $8,000 profit. He would eventually go on to make the company around $100,000 a day and eventually managed a $75 million portfolio and six traders. Cohen was running his own trading group at Gruntal & Co. by 1984, and continued running it until he started his own company, SAC.\n\nThroughout the late 1980s, the Securities and Exchange Commission became suspicious that Cohen had used inside information in December 1985 when he bet that RCA and GE would merge, ahead of the announcement. The SEC called him to testify, but he refused to answer any questions, invoking his right against self-incrimination. Then, the SEC started looking into his other investments from the same period, especially those involving Brett K. Lurie. \n\nIn 1992, Cohen started S.A.C. Capital Advisors with $10 million of his own money and another $10 million from outside capital. The company's name 'SAC Capital' derived from Steven A. Cohen's initials.\n\nIn 2003, the \"New York Times\" wrote that \"SAC is one of the biggest hedge funds and is known for frequent and rapid trading.\" In 2006, the \"Wall Street Journal\" reported that while Cohen was once a rapid-fire trader who never held trading positions for extended periods of time, he now holds an increasing number of equities for longer periods of time.\n\nAs of 2009, the firm managed $14 billion in equity.\n\nOn November 20, 2012, Cohen was implicated in an alleged insider trading scandal involving an ex-SAC manager, Mathew Martoma. The SEC brought charges against a number of other SAC employees from 2010 to 2013 with various outcomes. Martoma was convicted in 2014, in what federal prosecutors billed as the most profitable insider-trading conspiracy in history. The SEC later brought a civil lawsuit against Cohen, alleging his failure to supervise Martoma and Michael Steinberg, who was a senior employee and confidant of Cohen's. Cohen settled his civil case with regulators in January 2016; the agreement with the SEC prohibited Cohen from managing outside money until 2018.\n\nS.A.C. Capital Advisors \"pleaded guilty to insider trading charges in 2013 and paid $1.8 billion in penalties\" and was required to stop handling investments for outsiders. Cohen \"escaped criminal indictment himself despite being the living, breathing heart of S.A.C. Capital,\" but Dr. Sidney Gilman, the star prosecution witness against Martoma, testified that FBI agents told him that Cohen was the investigation's ultimate target. He was featured in a January 2017 \"New Yorker\" article titled, \"When The Feds Went After The Hedge-Fund Legend Steven A. Cohen\".\n\nIn May 2016 Cohen founded Point72 Ventures, \"a venture capital fund that makes early-stage investments.\"\n\nIn 2016, \"Forbes Magazine\" estimated Cohen's fortune at $13 billion, ranking him the 30th richest person in the United States. Cohen was dubbed \"the hedge fund king\" in a 2006 \"Wall Street Journal\" article. His 2005 compensation was reportedly $1 billion, considerably higher than his 2001 compensation of $428 million. In February 2015, Forbes listed Cohen as the highest-earning hedge fund manager in 2014. In December 2013, Cohen's New York penthouse in the Bloomberg Tower was listed for sale for $98 million.\nCurrently a minority owner of the New York Mets, with a 8% stake in the baseball team.\n\nTrustee - Cohen serves on the board of trustees of the New York-based Robin Hood Foundation.\n\nSteven & Alexandra Cohen Foundation - Cohen and his wife Alexandra have donated to projects involved in health, education, arts and culture, and the New York community. In 2014, the Cohen Foundation provided funding, via the New York University Langone Center, for the study of post-traumatic stress and traumatic brain injury.\n\nThe Steven & Alexandra Cohen Foundation gave a grant in excess of $100,000 to the Bruce Museum of Arts and Science in 2014.\n\nIn 2019 the foundation contributed $50 million of the more than $400 million raised for the New York Museum of Modern Art. The museum announced in 2017 that MoMA's largest contiguous gallery will be called the Steven and Alexandra Cohen Center for Special Exhibitions. Cohen is on the board of the MoMa and LA MOCA.\n\nCohen Veterans Network - In April 2016, Cohen announced the creation and a commitment of $275 million to the Cohen Veterans Network. The CVN's goal is to establish mental health centers for veterans and their families throughout the U.S. The goal is the establishment of 20-25 centers by 2020.\n\nCohen Veterans Bioscience - Cohen Veterans Bioscience, also funded by Steve Cohen, conducts research into the effects of posttraumatic stress disorder on combat veterans.\n\nPolitical donations - In 2015, Steven Cohen and his wife, Alexandra, donated $2.25 million to a Super PAC called America Leads that supported Chris Christie's presidential candidacy.\n\nSteve Cohen is known for often overpaying for art which seems to be part of the pleasure. His art collection is reported to be worth around $1 billion. \n\nBegins collecting art - The New York Times reported that Cohen began seriously collecting art in 2000. Cohen's tastes and collection began with Impressionist painters, acquiring works by Manet and Monet, after which he moved quickly into contemporary art.\n\nWhile he has collected works from important emerging artists such as Adam Pendleton, he is most famous for collecting 'trophy' art—signature works by famous artists—including a Pollock drip painting from David Geffen for $52 million and Damien Hirst's \"The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living\", a piece that the artist had bought back from Charles Saatchi for $8 million.\n\nIn 2006, Cohen attempted to make the most expensive art purchase in history when he offered to purchase Picasso's \"Le Rêve\" from casino mogul Steve Wynn for $139 million. Just days before the painting was to be transported to Cohen, Wynn, who suffers from poor vision due to retinitis pigmentosa, accidentally thrust his elbow through the painting while showing it to a group of acquaintances inside of his office at Wynn Las Vegas. The purchase was canceled, and Wynn still held the painting until early November 2012, when Cohen finally acquired the painting for $150 million.\n\nIn May 2019, Cohen bought Jeff Koons's \"Rabbit\" for $91.1 million, the purchase was made through Robert Mnuchin, and was the most expensive work sold by a living artist at auction at the time.\n\nScope and housing the collection - Cohen owns or has owned artworks by Lucio Fontana, Alberto Giacometti, Willem de Kooning, Jeff Koons, Edvard Munch, Pablo Picasso, and Andy Warhol. In 2015, he reportedly bought the world's most expensive sculpture, Alberto Giacometti's \"Man Pointing\". A 2015 estimate valued his art collection at about $1 billion. Cohen is reportedly building a private museum for some of his artwork on his Greenwich property. Cohen has also placed Marc Quinn's \"Self\", a head sculpture made of frozen blood, in the SAC lobby.\n\nIn 2008, he was inducted into the Institutional Investors Alpha's Hedge Fund Manager Hall of Fame along with Alfred Jones, Bruce Kovner, David Swensen, George Soros, Jack Nash, James Simons, Julian Robertson, Kenneth Griffin, Leon Levy, Louis Bacon, Michael Steinhardt, Paul Tudor Jones and Seth Klarman.\n\nCohen has been married twice. In 1979, he married Patricia Finke, a New York native from a working-class background who grew up in the Washington Heights, Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. They have two children together. They divorced in 1990.\n\nIn 1991 Cohen met Alexandra Garcia, a single mother of Puerto Rican descent. Garcia grew up in Washington Heights, moving there from her original home in the projects of Harlem. They have four children together. Before some of the children got older, Cohen and Alex lived in Greenwich, Connecticut, with their seven children (their four children along with Alexandra's prior child and his two children with his first wife, Patricia). In 1998, the Cohens purchased a home on in Greenwich.\n\nIn December 2009, Cohen and his brother Donald T. Cohen were sued by Steven's ex-wife Patricia Cohen for racketeering and insider trading charges. On March 30, 2011, the United States District Court in Lower Manhattan dismissed the case, but on April 3, 2013, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said a lower court had erred in dismissing fraud-based claims by his former spouse and revived the lawsuit. The appeals court also revived claims of racketeering and breach of fiduciary duty, while upholding the dismissal of an unjust enrichment claim.\n\nWriting for a three-judge panel, Circuit Judge Pierre Leval said Patricia Cohen had made a “plausible” allegation that Steven Cohen had concealed the $5.5 million during negotiations on a separation agreement in 1989, which preceded the divorce. The revival of the lawsuit comes amid mounting pressure on Steven Cohen over an insider trading investigation that led to the arrest of Michael Steinberg, one of Cohen's closest confidantes at SAC Capital. SAC affiliates reached two civil insider trading settlements totaling nearly $616 million with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. SAC neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing in either case.\n\n\n"}

SAC Capital Advisors was founded in 1992 and converted its investment operations to the Point72 Asset Management family office in 2014. In 2018, the firm reopened to external investors after a two-year ban and began accepting outside capital. As of 2019, Point72 employs approximately 1,400 people. Point72 has its main office in Stamford, Connecticut, and there are several satellite offices around the world.\n\nPoint72 was founded in 2014 as the successor to S.A.C. Capital, after the firm pleaded guilty to federal insider trading charges and paid a $1.8 billion fine. In March 2014, S.A.C. Capital transferred the bulk of its assets to Point72 and was placed in \"run-off,\" or a winding down of its operations. During this transition, Point72 launched a program a firm spokesperson referred to in a \"Wall Street Journal\" article as \"the first phase of its transformation and renewal.\"\n\nIn the wake of the government's criticism of S.A.C.'s compliance program, Point72 enacted a series of reforms to bolster internal compliance. Former federal prosecutor Vincent Tortorella was hired to fill a newly created role of chief surveillance officer, and former U.S. Attorney for Connecticut, Kevin J. O’Connor, was hired to serve as Chief Counsel. A specialized surveillance unit, composed of ex-CIA, FBI and SEC investigators, was created to emphasize the need for compliance by traders, and in 2014, the firm retained Palantir Technologies, Inc., a Central Intelligence Agency-backed software maker to provide a new tool for compliance and surveillance. During this time, Point72 adopted other software programs designed to bolster internal compliance.\n\nIn August 2014, founder Steven Cohen replaced many of the management personnel who had operated S.A.C. Among the changes, he named a new president of Point72, Douglas D. Haynes, and a new chief operating officer, former IBM executive Timothy Shaughnessy. Shaughnessy retired in 2018 and was replaced by Gavin O'Connor, who joined the firm from Goldman Sachs.\n\nIn 2015, the firm launched the Point72 Academy, an internship program to train new employees according to its mission and values. Point72 describes the program as an effort to build a stronger internal culture.\n\nThere are satellite offices in New York City, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Singapore, London, Paris, Sydney, and Palo Alto.\n\nThe firm's long/short investment divisions are Point72 Asset Management and EverPoint Asset Management. EverPoint Asset Management headquartered in New York operates a stock trading portfolio. Point72 folded its big data unit into its Market Intelligence team in 2018. In 2018 Point72 had 125 portfolio managers and around 1,000 employees.\n\nIn 2016, Steve Cohen established Point72 Ventures, a venture capital fund that makes early-stage investments in Asia, Europe, Central America, and the United States. Point72 Ventures now invests in fintech, machine learning, artificial intelligence, cyber-security and core-enterprise companies. \nMatthew Granade, the head of Point72’s Market Intelligence unit and a former co-head of research at Bridgewater Associates, is the Managing Partner at Point72 Ventures. As of 2019, the fund is composed of about 15 employees, and its investments typically range from $500,000 to $15 million. Pete Casella leads Point72 Ventures-Fintech, Dan Gwak and Sri Chandrasekar lead Point72 Ventures-AI, and David Dubick and Noah Carr lead Ventures’ third sleeve, Point72 Ventures-Core Enterprise.\n\nCubist Systematic Strategies is its quantitative investing business. The name was chosen as a reference to cubist art; the New York Times reported that \"Cohen is a well-known art collector\".\n\nThe New York Times reported that Point72 President Douglas D. Haynes who was hired as managing director for human capital and then became President resigned in March 2018 \"amid [a] gender bias lawsuit\" and was replaced as president by Cohen.\n\n"}

It is bounded on the north by Indianola, on the west by Suquamish, and on the south by Bainbridge Island. Port Madison connects to Bainbridge Island via the Agate Pass Bridge to the southwest. Two small bays open off Port Madison: Miller Bay to the northwest, and another small bay to the south which, confusingly, is also called Port Madison Bay (or, locally, as the \"Inner Harbor\").\n\nThe inner harbor, which indents into Bainbridge Island is where the \"Port Madison Yacht Club\" and a \"Seattle Yacht Club outstation\" are located. The Port Madison Indian Reservation is located on the west and north shores of Port Madison.\n\nAccording to various sources, the native name of the bay was either Tu-che-kup or Noo-sohk-um. On Nov. 8 1824, John Work of the Hudson's Bay Company, while looking for potential sites for a trading post, recorded it as Soquamis Bay - a variation on the name of the Suquamish tribe which made its home on the western shore. The Wilkes Expedition surveyed the bay on May 10, 1841 and named it for James Madison, the 4th president of the United States.\n\nGeorge A. Meigs built a lumber mill on the Bainbridge Island shore of the bay in 1854, and Port Madison was soon a booming mill town. The town of Port Madison became Kitsap County's first county seat, but after the economic depression of the 1890s closed the mill, the seat was relocated and Port Madison became a ghost town.

It is one of over 560 national wildlife refuges which manages and protects natural resources for future generations. The refuge is located in North Park in central Jackson County south of the town of Walden. The refuge was established in 1967 to furnish waterfowl with a suitable place to nest and rear their young. It was created in part to offset losses of nesting habitat in the prairie wetland region of the Midwest. It is located in the valley of the Illinois River, a tributary of the North Platte River. It is administered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nThe dry climate of the area (at an elevation of approximately 8800 feet) requires the diversion of water from the Illinois River through a complex system of ditches to irrigate wetland meadows and fill water fowl brood ponds. Periodic burning, irrigation and various grazing systems are management tools used on the refuge meadows to maintain vegetative vigor for nesting purposes. Manipulation of water levels in the shallow ponds is intended to assure adequate aquatic vegetation for food and escape cover. The ponds also produce many insects and other invertebrates (protein) needed by most female waterfowl for successful egg laying. These insects also serve as an essential food item for the growth of ducklings and goslings during the summer months.\n\nThe first waterfowl arrive at the refuge in the spring when the ice vanishes in April. The peak migration occurs in late May when 5,000 or more ducks may be present. Canada geese have been reestablished in North Park and begin nesting on the refuge during April. Duck nesting usually starts in early June and peaks in late June. The refuge produces about 9,000 ducklings and 150 to 200 goslings each year. The Fish and Wildlife Service expects that when refuge lands are fully acquired and developed, waterfowl production should increase significantly.\n\nThere have been 198 bird species recorded in the refuge. Primary upland nesting species include the mallard, pintail, gadwall, and American wigeon. A number of diving ducks, including the lesser scaup and redhead, nest on the larger ponds and adjacent wet meadows. Most species may be observed during the entire summer season. Fall migration reaches its height in late September or early October when up to 8,000 waterfowl may be on the refuge.\n\nRefuge wetlands also attract numerous marsh, shore, and water birds. Sora and Virginia rails - shy, secretive birds - are numerous but seldom seen. If they are present, Wilson's phalarope, American avocet, willet, sandpipers, Greater yellowlegs, and dowitchers will be easy to observe. Other less common species include great blue heron, black-crowned night heron, American bittern, and eared and pied-billed grebe.\n\nThe upland hills harbor sage grouse year around with a winter population of more than 200 birds. Golden eagles, several species of hawks, and an occasional prairie falcon circle the skies above the refuge in search of food. Their prey includes Richardson's ground squirrel, white-tailed prairie dog, and white-tailed jackrabbit.\n\nBadger, muskrat, beaver, coyote, and pronghorn are commonly observed by visitors. It is also possible to see the mammalian species of raccoon, red fox, mink, long-tailed weasel, or porcupine. As many as 400 mule deer have wintered here and up to 200 elk are frequently seen during the winter months. Moose have recently been reintroduced into North Park and may occasionally be observed in the willow thickets along the Illinois River bottoms. There are no venomous snakes in the refuge.\n\nPublic access to the refuge includes a self-guided 6-mile wildlife auto tour route from nearby State Highway 14, and overlook over the Illinois River valley. Public fishing is permitted along the Illinois River except in the areas marked as closed. Portions of the refuge are open to public hunting of some game species during appropriate state seasons. The refuge is open for day-use only. Fires are not permitted on refuge lands.\n\nAn 1850-foot ADA compliant boardwalk was completed in August 2009 by Wildlands Restoration Volunteers. The volunteers built it over 5 years, with more than 6,000 man hours of labor. It winds along parts of the river where numerous animals and birds can be seen. Moose can often be seen among the willows. The boardwalk is about a mile southwest of the refuge headquarters.\n"}

{"id": "1981608", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1981608", "title": "Colcannon", "text": "Colcannon\n\nColcannon () is a traditional Irish dish of mashed potatoes with kale or cabbage.\n\nColcannon is most commonly made with only four ingredients: potatoes, butter, milk and kale. Irish historian Patrick Weston Joyce defined it as \"potatoes mashed with butter and milk, with chopped up cabbage and pot herbs\". It can contain other ingredients such as scallions (spring onions), leeks, Laverbread, onions and chives. Some recipes substitute cabbage for kale. There are many regional variations of this staple dish. It was a cheap, year-round food. It is often eaten with boiled ham or Irish bacon. As a side dish it goes well with corned beef and cabbage.\n\nAn Irish Halloween tradition is to serve colcannon with a ring and a thimble hidden in the dish. Prizes of small coins such as threepenny or sixpenny bits were also concealed inside the dish. The dish champ is similar but made with buttermilk.\n\nThe origin of the word is unclear. The first syllable 'col' is likely derived from the Irish 'cál' meaning cabbage. The second syllable may derive from 'ceann-fhionn' meaning a white head (i.e. 'a white head of cabbage') - this use is also found in the Irish name for a coot, a white headed bird known as 'cearc cheannan', or 'white-head hen'. The phrase may also be borrowed from the Welsh name for a leek soup known as cawl cennin, literally \"broth (of) leeks.\"\n\nThe song \"Colcannon\", also called \"The Skillet Pot\", is a traditional Irish song that has been recorded by numerous artists, including Mary Black. It begins:\n<poem>Did you ever eat Colcannon, made from lovely pickled cream?\nWith the greens and scallions mingled like a picture in a dream.\nDid you ever make a hole on top to hold the melting flake\nOf the creamy, flavoured butter that your mother used to make?</poem>\n\nThe chorus:\n<poem>Yes you did, so you did, so did he and so did I.\nAnd the more I think about it sure the nearer I'm to cry.\nOh, wasn't it the happy days when troubles we had not,\nAnd our mothers made Colcannon in the little skillet pot.</poem>\n\n"}

The work was written in the summer of 1883 at Wiesbaden, nearly six years after he completed his Symphony No. 2. In the interim Brahms had written some of his greatest works, including the Violin Concerto, two overtures (\"Tragic Overture\" and \"Academic Festival Overture\"), and Piano Concerto No. 2. \n\nThe premiere performance was given on 2 December 1883 by the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, under the direction of Hans Richter. It is the shortest of Brahms' four symphonies; a typical performance lasts between 30 and 40 minutes.\n\nThe symphony is scored for two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, a contrabassoon, four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, timpani, and strings.\n\nThe symphony consists of four movements, marked as follows:\nHans Richter, who conducted the premiere of the symphony, proclaimed it to be Brahms' \"Eroica\". The symphony was well received, more so than his Second Symphony. Although Richard Wagner had died earlier that year, the public feud between Brahms and Wagner had not yet subsided. Wagner enthusiasts tried to interfere with the symphony's premiere, and the conflict between the two factions nearly brought about a duel.\n\nAfter each performance, Brahms polished his score further, until it was published in May 1884. His friend the influential music critic Eduard Hanslick said, \"Many music lovers will prefer the titanic force of the First Symphony; others, the untroubled charm of the Second, but the Third strikes me as being artistically the most nearly perfect.\"\n\nA musical motto consisting of three notes, F–A–F, was significant to Brahms. In 1853 his friend Joseph Joachim had taken as his motto \"Free, but lonely\" (in German \"Frei aber einsam\"), and from the notes represented by the first letters of these words, F–A–E, Schumann, Brahms and Dietrich had jointly composed a violin sonata dedicated to Joachim. At the time of the Third Symphony, Brahms was a fifty-year-old bachelor who declared himself to be \"Frei aber froh\", \"Free but happy\". His F–A–F motto, and some altered variations of it, can be heard throughout the symphony.\n\nAt the beginning of the symphony the motto is the melody of the first three measures, and it is the bass line underlying the main theme in the next three. The motto persists, either boldly or disguised, as the melody or accompaniment throughout the movement. For the third movement, instead of the rapid scherzo standard in 19th-century symphony, Brahms created a unique kind of movement that is moderate in tempo (\"poco allegretto\") and intensely lyrical in character. The finale is a lyrical, passionate movement, rich in melody that is intensely exploited, altered, and developed. The movement ends with reference to the motto heard in the first movement – one which quotes a motif heard in Schumann's Symphony No. 3, \"Rhenish\" in the first movement just before the second theme enters in the recapitulation – then fades away to a quiet ending.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1981622", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1981622", "title": "Dan Enright", "text": "Dan Enright\n\nDaniel \"Dan\" Enright (August 30, 1917 – May 22, 1992) was an American television producer, primarily of game shows. Enright worked with Jack Barry from the 1940s until Barry's death in 1984. They were partners in creating programs for radio and television. Their company was called Barry & Enright Productions.\n\nEnright (original surname Ehrenreich), who grew up in British Palestine and New York City, met up with Barry as the latter was working in stand-up comedy. After a stint at WOR radio, the two developed several early TV shows, including the seminal \"interactive\" show \"Winky Dink and You\", as well as \"Juvenile Jury\" and \"Life Begins at Eighty\", and \"Wisdom of the Ages\".\n\nThe duo produced network game shows in the 1950s, including \"Back That Fact\", \"You're On Your Own\", \"Tic-Tac-Dough\", \"Twenty-One\", \"Concentration\" and \"Dough Re Mi\".\n\nCapitalizing on the success of the 1950s big-money quiz \"The $64,000 Question\" on CBS, Barry and Enright developed their flagship show, \"Twenty-One\", a quiz which had a scoring system based loosely on blackjack. Contestants were placed in twin isolation booths and asked questions ranging in value from one to 11 points — the higher the point value, the more difficult the question. Enright described the initial broadcast of \"Twenty-One\" as \"a dismal failure. It was just plain dull.\" Contestants repeatedly missed questions and, in Enright's own words, \"It lacked all drama; it lacked all suspense. The next morning the sponsor (Geritol) called my partner, Jack Barry, and me and told us in no uncertain terms that he never wanted to see a repeat of what happened the previous night. And from that moment on, we decided to rig \"Twenty-One\".\" Even with rigging, initial ratings were unimpressive.\n\nEnright believed they needed to find heroes and villains — contestants the audience would either root for or root against. Though not illegal at the time, Enright and his assistant producer Albert Freedman went beyond merely finding appealing players by actually manipulating them: providing certain contestants with answers in advance, and scripting games and the players' mannerisms in the isolation booth. It was a process the producers duplicated for \"Tic Tac Dough\".\n\nEnright's most famous contestant protégé was \"Twenty-One\"'s Charles Van Doren, who went on to win for 14 weeks and became a cover subject for \"Time\", thus causing the show's popularity to soar. Van Doren replaced Herb Stempel, who himself had been given answers over his extended run on the show, but was eventually forced to lose (so that the more telegenic Van Doren might replace him). After waiting for Enright to fulfill his promise of a job in exchange for throwing the match, Stempel realized it would never come and went to the authorities. It was only when other contestants came forward about game show rigging did they take Stempel seriously.\n\nAs the press was publishing allegations by former contestants of quiz rigging, NBC purchased from Barry and Enright the shows \"Twenty-One\" and \"Tic Tac Dough\", along with two new daytime entries, \"Concentration\" and a musical quiz \"Dough Re Mi\", all of which aired on NBC, for $1 million. Eventually the truth came out, and Enright admitted to rigging the show and giving contestants the questions and answers in advance.\n\nAs \"Twenty-One's\" emcee and co-producer, Jack Barry did not directly rig the shows himself (even quiz-show scandal investigator Joseph Stone questioned his involvement, and Herb Stempel has said in interviews that he believes Enright hid the rigging from Barry until it was exposed), yet he admitted in interviews given in the 1970s and 1980s his role in covering up the rigging for Enright.\n\nBarry and Enright's careers went into eclipse after the scandal broke, though Barry did get some hosting and acting gigs and briefly collaborated on projects with game show packager Goodson-Todman Productions. Barry purchased a radio station in Redondo Beach, California, and in 1969 he made his first network comeback as an emcee, replacing Dennis Wholey on a short-lived prime-time game, \"The Generation Gap\" on ABC. Two years later he sold his first post-scandal game show, also to ABC, called \"The Reel Game,\" which he emceed as well.\n\nSlowly, Enright managed to work his way back into television, having to go to Canada to do so. He was a producer of the early-70s syndicated game show \"All About Faces\" with Richard Hayes. Barry and Enright also collaborated on other small Canadian-produced quiz shows including \"Line 'em Up\", \"Photo Finish\" shot in Montreal, and \"It's a Match\" which was taped in Toronto. It was on these shows that a number of young American and Canadian producers and directors got their start, including John Kastner, Sidney M. Cohen, Mark Phillips and Jay Wolpert.\n\nIn 1972, after two failed attempts to sell a pilot, CBS bought from Barry the game show that would permanently revive his career as a host and producer: \"The Joker's Wild\". One of the original pilots of \"The Joker's Wild\" was produced in 1969 during Barry's collaboration with Mark Goodson and Bill Todman and was emceed by Allen Ludden. Although credited as \"A Jack Barry Production\", there had been speculation that ex-partner Enright was somehow involved with the show, and indeed Enright was credited as executive producer in the show's final year on CBS. Nonetheless, \"Joker\" proved to be a success. In 1975 it was canceled by CBS but reruns of \"Joker\" did so well on local Los Angeles and New York TV stations that in 1977 a whole new series was produced for syndication. The syndicated \"Joker\" ran until 1986 (with Bill Cullen succeeding Barry after his death).\n\nBy 1977, Barry and Enright had resumed their partnership full-time. In the spring of 1976 they sold a revival of \"Break the Bank\" to ABC. Despite promising early ratings, the daytime network version hosted by Tom Kennedy was canceled. A weekly first-run syndication version aired from September 1976 to September 1977, hosted by co-packager Barry.\n\nBarry and Enright later found their longest-lasting success with syndicated versions of \"Joker,\" the revived \"Tic-Tac-Dough\" with Wink Martindale and later, Jim Caldwell hosting.\n\nIn early 1981, Enright started a seven year relationship with Bullseye's all-time cash and prize winner, former child actress Donna Birke (nee Boyce), who had appeared on Bullseye in 1980. The two shared a penthouse apartment in Century City, then in Marina del Rey from 1985 through 1987, when they separated. Enright reportedly paid Boyce $276,000 in a quasi-\"palimony\" settlement at the time of their separation.\n\nIn 1981, Barry and Enright crossed over into the field of motion picture production with the release of their first (and only) film, \"Private Lessons\" a coming-of-age comedy featuring erotic film star Sylvia Kristel.\n\nFollowing Jack Barry's sudden death in 1984, Enright continued to run Barry & Enright Productions completely, retaining the B&E name as opposed to renaming the company Dan Enright Productions. Barry's death resulted in the departure of key Barry & Enright figures, including producers Ron Greenberg and Gary Cox and director Richard S. Kline, all three of whom were not in favor of Enright taking over the company. Kline went on to form his own production company, Greenberg returned to producing his own programs, and Cox joined Reg Grundy Productions in 1985.\n\nEnright went on to produce a few other game shows on his own, including \"Bumper Stumpers\" (a joint venture with Wink Martindale Productions, which taped in Canada and aired on USA Network) and a short-lived revival of \"Tic-Tac-Dough\", as well as a few projects with former \"Wheel of Fortune\" co-host Susan Stafford, who was then Vice President of Public Relations for Barry & Enright Productions. Enright and Stafford shared a penthouse in Santa Monica, California.\n\nEnright died of cancer on May 22, 1992, at age 74, and was buried at the Forest Lawn, Hollywood Hills Cemetery in Los Angeles.\n\nHe was survived by his wife, Stella, and two children: Daughter Erica (who worked as a casting director on \"Private Lessons\", and eventually would die in 2000), and son Don (who became a successful film and television producer in his own right).\n\n"}

Foulke was renowned for his great size ( by some estimates) and weight, reaching perhaps 24 stone (152 kg; 336 lb) at the end of his career, although reports on his weight vary.\n\nHe played four first-class matches for Derbyshire County Cricket Club in the 1900 season, but is remembered primarily as a goalkeeper for Sheffield United although he later played for Chelsea and Bradford City.\n\nAfter being discovered playing for village side Blackwell in a Derbyshire Cup tie at Ilkeston Town, Foulke made his debut for Sheffield United against West Bromwich Albion on 1 September 1894 and led the team to three FA Cup finals (winning two) and a League Championship.\n\nAccording to \"The Cat's Pyjamas: The Penguin Book of Cliches\" (), the \"Who ate all the pies?\" chant was first sung in 1894 by Sheffield United supporters, and directed at\nFoulke's 300 lb (about 136 kg). This is disputed, however, as a September 2019 article on the BBC Sport website pointed out that the tune to which the chant is sung, \"Knees Up Mother Brown\", is believed to have originated in 1918, which was some two years after Foulke's death. Foulke also weighed only in 1894 and the weight gain came much later.\n\nHe also won a single international cap for England in 1897 against Wales.\n\nAt the end of the first match in the 1902 FA Cup Final, Foulke protested to the officials that Southampton's equalising goal should not have been allowed. Foulke left his dressing room unclothed and pursued the referee, Tom Kirkham, who took refuge in a broom cupboard. Foulke had to be stopped by a group of F.A. officials from wrenching the cupboard door from its hinges to reach the hapless referee. In the replay, Sheffield United won 2–1, with Foulke being required to make several saves to keep United in the match. He was also in goal for United when they suffered an FA Cup exit to Second Division Burslem Port Vale in 1898.\n\nHe then moved to Chelsea for a fee of £50 and was made club captain. Foulke by now was remarkably temperamental. If he thought his defenders were not trying hard enough, he would walk off the field. Opposing forwards who incurred his displeasure would be picked up and thrown bodily into his goal. He was, however, a great crowd puller, and Chelsea decided to exploit this. To draw even more attention to his size, they placed two small boys behind his goal in an effort to distract the opposition even more. The boys would sometimes run and return the ball when it went out of play, and quite by accident, ball boys came into being. Foulke stayed for just one season before moving to his final club, Bradford City.\n\nAt some stage after his retirement Foulkes had played a beat-the-goalie contest in Blackpool. In a short obituary to Foulkes a Blackpool newspaper reminded its readers that Foulkes had \"appeared in a good [sic] scoring side-show on the spare ground, Britannia Place, South Shore, where many a football aspirant tried their goal-scoring prowess against the once noted goalkeeper\" (Blackpool Times, 6 May 1916).\n\nHe also owned a beer house in Sheffield along with a shop in Matilda Street and was known to walk around his home town wearing his FA Cup winner's medal around his neck on a homemade chain.\n\nFoulke appears in the Mitchell and Kenyon films, playing in a match on 6 September 1902. His nephew, Jim Simmons, was also a professional footballer.\n\nFouke's talent as a crowd-pleaser brought an extra dimension to conventional football entertainment. He became the darling of the crowd with a range of unusual skills and the various incidents which took place around him. At clearances he was able to punch the ball over the half way line - a huge advantage which could rapidly turn defence into attack.He was an expert in saving penalties and was also known to charge upfield to the penalty spot. His love of eating was legendary and there are many stories of how he would often arrive early for breakfast, set out for the whole team, and scoff the lot. He was a colourful character and it is said that a forward who offended him was picked up and held upside down by his feet over the muddy pitch. He is also said to have sat on people who teased him until they apologised. During a match with Burton Albion he stopped two penalties and the forward who missed the penalties is said to have complained \"where else could I have placed the kicks – there was nowhere else to aim\".\n\nAt the end of the first match in the 1902 Cup Final Foulke protested to the officials that Southampton's equalising goal should not have been allowed. Foulke left his dressing room unclothed and pursued the referee, who took refuge in a broom cupboard. Foulke had to be stopped by a group of F.A. officials from wrenching the cupboard door from its hinges to reach the hapless referee.\n\nWhilst playing against Accrington Stanley in February 1907, it is said that Foulke's jersey clashed with the red of Stanley and no-one could find a jersey large enough to fit him, so he played wrapped in a sheet, procured from a nearby house. Bradford won the game 1-0 and Foulke did not dive during the match, so he kept a literally 'clean sheet'. It was during this game that he snapped a crossbar in two causing the match to be stopped.\n\nTo draw even more attention to his size, they placed two small boys behind his goal in an effort to distract the opposition even more. The boys would sometimes run and return the ball when it went out of play, and quite by accident, ball boys came into being.\n\nThe football chant \"Who ate all the pies\" is said to have originally been about Foulke, although this is generally accepted as an urban myth. The one-liner \"Call me anything you want, but don't call me late for dinner\" has been attributed to him, but sources are unclear. In the Chelsea match programme for 2 December 1905 it was printed: \"Foulke says he doesn't care how much they charge him, so long as they don't charge him too much for his dinner.\"\n\n'Fatty' Foulke died on 1 May 1916 at the age of 42 years old, two weeks and five days. He was buried in Burngreave cemetery, Sheffield, England. His death certificate gives \"cirhossis\" as the major cause of death. The stories of pneumonia caught whilst earning pin money at a \"beat the goalie\" booth on Blackpool Sands seem to be without foundation.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1981633", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1981633", "title": "Blocking the plate", "text": "Blocking the plate\n\nIn baseball, blocking the plate is a technique performed by a catcher to prevent a runner from scoring. The act of blocking the plate accounted for most of the physical contact in Major League Baseball prior to the 2014 season, when it was outlawed except when the catcher already has possession of the ball.\n\nBy the rules of baseball, a runner has the right to an unobstructed path to a base. However, this right is not granted if the fielder guarding the base possesses the ball or is in the process of catching the ball. The fielders guarding first base through third base are unlikely to risk physical harm and will generally place themselves out of the path of the runner. The catcher guarding home plate, however, wears padding and a face mask and often placed his body as an obstacle between the runner and home plate, even prior to receiving the ball. Since the runner did not have to worry about remaining on home plate, only tagging it, he typically ran at full speed in an effort to reach the plate. The speed of the runner combined with the fact that the catcher still had to tag him (unless the bases were loaded and a force play at home was still available) often resulted in collisions.\n\nSince the 1970 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, there have been rules established, mainly in amateur levels of baseball, against home plate collisions between runners and catchers to make the obstruction (defense) and interference (offense) rules consistent at the plate with the three bases. The rules, long enforced at lower levels, were implemented at the professional level in 2014.\n\nAny time there is a close play at home plate, meaning the ball and runner reach the plate at roughly the same time, the catcher will often squat in front of the plate to block the runner's clear path to the plate. Unless he is willing to be tagged out, the runner who is faced with a blocked plate has two choices. He can:\n\nIf the runner slides, the catcher will often make a sweeping motion with his glove to quickly tag the runner out. Otherwise, the catcher must brace for impact and keep the ball in his glove or hand in order to tag the runner out.\n\nBoth players place themselves at risk of injury when there is a close play at home plate. Though they wear protective equipment, catchers are more likely to be injured than runners. Catchers often have bad knees due to the squatting stance they take at the plate. A catcher's knees are also his closest body parts to an incoming runner, and there is a chance of an ACL injury to the catcher. Other injuries include broken bones, bruises, and concussions.\n\nIn one infamous incident, Cleveland Indians catcher Ray Fosse suffered a separated shoulder when Pete Rose intentionally collided with him on a play at the plate during the 1970 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. Rose was roundly criticized because the game was an exhibition and also because he could have easily slid around Fosse rather than collide with him. Ultimately, the incident served to help build Rose's \"Charlie Hustle\" reputation and Fosse, who had been having a phenomenal rookie season, was never quite the same after the play.\n\nDifferent levels of baseball have instituted different rules in regards to collisions at home plate or on the bases, in part because of the Fosse-Rose collision and other instances where athletes have been injured or suffered concussions as a result of violent contact between runner and fielder.\nIn high school, the \"malicious contact\" rule prevents collisions at home plate or elsewhere on the field. The defense is prohibited from initiating flagrant contact with the base runner while the offense, in turn, is required to attempt to avoid significant contact, often through the use of a slide. If the defense violates, the ball is dead and the offender ejected as the umpire awards penalties that in his/her judgment will nullify the act of malicious contact. If the offense violates, the ball is dead, the offender declared out and then ejected from the game.\n\nIn college, the \"flagrant collision\" rule discourages, but does not prohibit, collisions at home plate and on the bases. Instead, only \"unnecessary and violent\" collisions are outlawed. While defensive players are allowed to block the plate/base with clear possession of the ball, offensive players must take steps to ensure contact with the fielder is legal—for instance, it must be below the waist. Violations of this rule carry similar penalties to the high school malicious contact rule.\n\nIn professional baseball—MLB—collisions at home plate have been legal and were unaddressed since the game's inception until a series of serious player injuries and also former catchers who were MLB managers recommending changes. In 2011, San Francisco catcher Buster Posey suffered a season-ending injury in a collision at home plate. The incident led to a reinterpretation of Rule 7.08 (b). On December 11, 2013, the MLB Rules Committee proposed a rules change that would outlaw the plate collision by dictating what both the defensive and offensive players may and may not do in such a situation. This establishes home plate with similar regulations as other bases in regards to obstruction (for the catcher) and interference (for the runner). On February 24, 2014, Major League Baseball and the MLBPA jointly announced an experimental rule—rule 7.13—intended to increase player safety by eliminating \"egregious\" collisions at home plate. The rule went into effect starting with the 2014 season but starting in 2015 the rule was renumbered as rule 6.01 (i). Informally known as the \"Buster Posey Rule,\" some highlights of rule 7.13 include:\n\nIn Finnish baseball, the runner is considered tagged and out when he has not arrived at a target base and the defending player is holding the ball while touching that base, similar to force out. No physical contact is necessary and the base umpire will call the runner out by raising a sign with the letter X and whistling twice.\n\nText of rule 7.13 is as follows:\n\nThe decision on whether or not a player violated Rule 7.13 falls into the hands of the umpire. A manager can choose to see if there was a rule violation rather than challenge a call, which might lead to a free challenge. The umpire makes the final decision.\n\nSome managers hope the rule does not decide the final game in the World Series, but many managers have stated that the rule needs clarification and explanation. The rule depends on the perception of the umpire and if he/she thinks that the contact was intentional and done with malicious intent. Regardless of what the rule states, many managers instruct players to slide.\n"}

Common names include hardhack, hardhack steeplebush, Douglas' spirea, douglasspirea, steeplebush, and rose spirea.\n\nThe plant is a woolly shrub growing 1 to 2 meters tall from rhizomes, forming dense riverside thickets. Large clusters of small pink flowers form spires in early summer, later turning dark and persisting. The leaves are toothed toward the tips. The undersides are whitish with prominent veins. \n\n\"Spiraea douglasii\" is native to western North America from Alaska across southwestern Canada and the Pacific Northwest. It occurs most often in riparian habitat types, such as swamps, streambanks, bogs and mudflats. It was introduced to Europe, where it is considered invasive. It grows among sedges, horsetails, wild blueberries, and other swamp flora.\n\nImported in Europe, the plant is considered as invasive, especially in Belgium, Germany and Poland. \"Spirea douglasii\" decreases the biodiversity: it colonizes bogs to the detriment of other plants.\n\nNative Americans found \"S. douglasii\" useful for making brooms and hanging seafood to cook. This plant is used as an ornamental in landscaping, where it grows best in sunny, moist places.\n\n"}

Several sections were written under imminent threat of harm. The first section was probably written in 1906.\n\nThis document constitutes one of the central and defining pieces of Baháʼí primary source literature, and is considered to be intimately connected to Baháʼu'lláh's (ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's father) \"Most Holy Book\".\n\nThe \"Will and Testament\", along with the \"Tablets of the Divine Plan\" and the \"Tablet of Carmel\", were described by Shoghi Effendi as the charters of the Baháʼí administration.\n\nThe Covenant is a critical aspect of the Baháʼí Faith. The \"Will and Testament of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá\" is sometimes seen as the culmination of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's role as the \"Centre of the Covenant\". In it he describes his circumstances, lays out his testimony, refers to the machinations of certain enemies, settles certain affairs of the Baháʼí Faith, and appoints his grandson Shoghi Effendi as his successor and the Guardian of the Cause of God. He also refines the structure of Baha'i administration by the aforementioned appointment, the establishment of the Spiritual Assembly at the national level, and defines the mechanism for the election of these assemblies as well as the House of Justice.\n\nThe Will is written in three sections, each of which were written separately and under differing circumstances. The three sections, however, remain together and comprise, collectively, the full Will and Testament.\n\nʻAbdu'l-Bahá notes the fundamental teachings of the Baháʼí Faith as love for all mankind. He then reiterates the twofold station of the Báb as a Manifestation of God and the forerunner to Baháʼu'lláh, and explains the full station of Baháʼu'lláh.\n\nʻAbdu'l-Bahá writes about the virtues of the Covenant established by Baháʼu'lláh, and writes about its power. He then goes on to account the sufferings that the centre of the Baháʼí Faith has suffered by people who were not faithful to the Covenant including Mírzá Yahyá with respect to Baháʼu'lláh, and Mírzá Muhammad ʻAlí with respect to himself.\n\nʻAbdu'l-Bahá establishes the institution of the Guardianship as a hereditary office and outlines its essential function as Interpreter of the Baháʼí writings. He states that the Guardian has the right to appoint Hands of the Cause and outlines their inter-relationship. He then explains the election of the Universal House of Justice and re-iterates that only it has the authority to enact laws which are not specifically explained in the Baháʼí holy books.\n\nThe Will and Testament also defines the obligation and responsibilities of the Hands of the Cause of God. Their main responsibilities include teaching the Baháʼí Faith, and also included to cast out the rebellious, to elect nine from within themselves who would assist the Guardian and who would confirm the choice of the Guardian's successor.\n\nThe provisions of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's \"Will\" were almost universally accepted by Baháʼís, except for a few western Baháʼís, including Hermann Zimmer and Ruth White, who believed that ʻAbdu'l-Bahá would never have established a hierarchy in the Baháʼí Faith. Ruth White led a campaign to discredit the will for several years, mostlly 1926-1929, hiring criminologist Charles Mitchell to analyze the \"Will\". His preliminary report concluded that based on handwriting analysis, that the \"Will\" was not written by ʻAbdu'l-Bahá. This charge was denied by those who read Persian and were familiar with ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's writings, including some of Shoghi Effendi's opponents.\n\n"}

{"id": "1981673", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1981673", "title": "Kingmaker (board game)", "text": "Kingmaker (board game)\n\nKingmaker is a board game created by Andrew McNeil. It was first produced in the UK by PhilMar Ltd. in 1974. The second edition was produced by Avalon Hill in the United States in 1975. This version was somewhat different from the original, as it refined the rules and required less knowledge about England to play. TM Games also released an edition in 1983 that was essentially a re-issue of the Avalon Hill version.\n\nThe game is set in the time of the English Wars of the Roses (1455–1487). Two to seven can play. Each player builds and controls a faction of nobles that, through battle, diplomacy and politics, attempts to eliminate other players’ factions, and gain control of one or more members of the two rival royal families, the House of Lancaster and the House of York.\n\nThe board is a map of 15th century Kingdom of England and nearby lands, with walled cities, towns, castles, and roads. Players begin with a number of cards initially. Players also receive resource cards each turn, which add to the player's faction. There are several different kinds of resource cards:\n\n\nRound cardboard pieces with heraldic emblems represent the nobles' current position on the map. The royal heirs are represented by octagonal or square pieces displaying either the red rose (Lancastrian faction) or white rose (Yorkist faction) and their Christian name (Richard, Henry, Margaret, etc.). Each player gets a set of markers with different colors and a feudal badge to denote cities & castles under their control. Square pieces are used for the few ships in the game.\n\nA second set of smaller cards make up the random event deck. Each player draws from this deck at the beginning of their turn. Any player, noble, or royal heir might be affected by a random event card, depending on the conditions it specifies. The effect is not limited to the drawing player. These smaller cards are also used for resolving combat.\n\nAlthough the Avalon Hill printing of this game puts a limit on the number of players that may take part, no such limit was mentioned in the original Ariel (UK) printing and the game can accommodate more than the suggested maximum. The recommended maximum number of players in the revised edition published by TM Games was 7.\n\n\"Kingmaker\" involves strategy and conflict conducted on different levels.\n\nThe Wars of the Roses involved fighting between factions of nobles. In \"Kingmaker\", each noble has a limited combat strength which is augmented by titles, offices, mercenaries, and certain other cards held in the player's hand. If the player moves nobles to the same space as one or more enemy nobles, they can attack them. A ratio of the strength of the two forces of nobles is tallied, an event card drawn, and the ratio printed on the card determines if victory is achieved. If the force is defeated, all nobles in that force are captured and may be executed or ransomed. Most of the named places on the map have fortifications with significant additional defensive combat strength, but using these can get the player's nobles besieged, with potential loss of all defenders.\n\nPolitics is another key aspect of \"Kingmaker\". Parliament existed in 15th century England, and can be summoned under specific circumstances in the game. Unfilled offices and titles are assigned in Parliament, which can result in quite of lot of power changing hands. In Parliament, in the Avalon Hill version, each noble uses their acquired voting strength in the House of Lords and the House of Commons to decide how to assign the spoils. A majority vote is required in both Houses to assign any title or office. Nobles who are weak in combat strength can still be strong in either Lords or Commons votes, and vice versa. Those who control the senior members of the York and Lancaster families or the crowned King (or Queen Regent) gain significant additional voting power as well. Parliaments are not convened often, and much deal-making amongst players can ensue. Erstwhile enemies on the battlefield may come together to distribute valuable offices and titles to bolster their position. In the original version the person calling the Parliament has a more or less free hand in distributing the titles and offices as they choose, since there is no democracy and no voting.\n\nThe real contest is often a contest of diplomacy. One strong player can be brought down by several weaker players working together, and threats, promises and agreements can be easier ways to get the desired results than by using brute force. Players can trade many types of cards, and agree on future spoils of war or honours awarded. However, no agreement made in the game is binding; supposed allies can change sides at will. The winner is often the player who manages to double-cross the other players just before they double-cross him.\n\nBesides untrustworthy rival players, the random events deck will often disrupt a player's long-term plans. Certain powerful nobles, officeholders, and even bishops can be called to deal with peasant revolts, incursions by the Scots, piracy and other such random events. Those controlling the King may find themselves dragged to diplomatic meetings in remote (and vulnerable) seaside towns. Combat also has risks, either with bad weather or the chance death of one of the player's nobles. The plague also can negatively affect those who linger in the protection of walled towns and cities.\n\nWhen nobles die, they eventually re-enter the game when a new head of a noble family assumes their place. This is not true of the royal heirs, who are limited to a few specific historical characters, such as Henry VI, Richard, Duke of York, and Margaret of Anjou. These can be taken under control by a player's nobles, and moved about, traded, captured, or executed by them. Death by combat, execution, or plague slowly reduces their number. The player who ultimately controls the only remaining member of either the York or Lancaster branches of the Plantagenet family wins. In other words, this is when one branch of the family is completely wiped out, and the player controls the only member of the other branch. Often, this person will be the crowned King or Queen of England, but even if not \"officially\" crowned, they are literally the last one standing. In the original game they had to be crowned to win. One noble, Beaufort, becomes a Lancastrian heir should all members of that branch die; this helps balance the game as there are fewer Lancastrian heirs than Yorkist ones.\n\nOne of the attractions of Kingmaker is that a player who is dealt a weak hand at the start of the game is not necessarily doomed to lose. \nWeaker players can withdraw from the main areas of the map to their own areas of relative better defense, and slowly build power from their additional resource card each turn, while the stronger players suffer more results of random events and losses in combat. A combination of patience, luck, timing, and exploiting rivalries can reverse the roles of strong and weak. \n\nOne variation not mentioned in the Avalon Hill version is that a late arriving player can be \"dealt in\" simply by dealing resource cards face up from the draw pile until a noble is found, at which time the new player has a noble and a hand of cards and may begin play.\n\nThe game components are striking, full of feudal images of heraldry and parchment, and the places, people and terms all use real mediaeval English. This is done without detracting from playability; in fact, the colorful and striking heraldic emblems are used just as they were designed, making identification easier than reading names. There can be some difficulty with some of the names of places and families, where non-British players (especially) may be unsure of the pronunciation. There have also been shifts in spelling and pronunciation since the 15th century. The Scrope family, for example, is referenced in Shakespeare's Henry V with the spelling 'Scroop,' which is likely the correct pronunciation for the era.\n\nThe game makes no attempt at reproducing the historical chain of events which occurred in the Wars of the Roses; the players are free to do as they see fit, which is likely to be quite different each time \"Kingmaker\" is played. The role of the royal heirs in the game, as mere pawns in the Machiavellian plots of the noble families, reflects the roles of some but not all of the real heirs. The relationship could be viewed as the Royal Heir running the faction they travel with rather than the reverse. Actual holdings of land and titles of different nobles has been broken down and simplified in many cases. However, reflecting the common view of that time, where few really cared which royal house had the more \"rightful\" claim, there was as much fighting within the houses as between them. Loyalty might change as the wind blows and a ruthless climb to power was often rewarded by betrayal and a cataclysmic downfall. This is faithfully reproduced in \"Kingmaker\".\n\nSome details are changed from historical fact to improve playability. Henry Tudor is not present in the game (see Beaufort Family for details), and the Beaufort noble piece becomes the Heir to the Lancastrian claim only if all Lancastrian heirs are killed. Some titles are removed from the nobles that historically held them. For game balance, the troop strengths are modified for different nobles, and the strongest noble (Percy) is forced to start the game in the far north, a long way from the main action, even though in real life the family held additional castles further south. However, all castles, towns, cities and other locations are given their correct names with one exception: the castle known as Masham in the game is actually Castle Bolton, owned by Lord Scrope of Masham (and owned by his descendants to this day). In the very first version of the game, there was also a typo: the board displayed \"Ravenser\" instead of \"Ravenscar\" in East Yorkshire.\n\nIn Simon Foxall's book \"Mapping England\" there is a map/board described as a \"Historical Version by the Black Prussian\"; this appears to be a modification of the Avalon Hill version which increases the degree of historical accuracy in the nobles included, their strengths and the places shown.\n\n\"Kingmaker\" is a computer version of the game, produced by Avalon Hill in 1994, which reproduces the look and play of the board game almost exactly, allowing the player to compete with up to five computer controlled factions. The major change from the board game is the addition of a battle interface where the player can control his or her army in combat, but it is very simplistic and the option to resolve battles by the original method remains. The game is no longer produced but can be found for download.\n\n\"Kingmaker\" won the Charles S. Roberts Award for \"Best Professional Game\" of 1975. Greg Stafford said \"A game's quality is measured by two things: fun and replayability. \"Kingmaker\" ranks \"way\" high in both. It is not perfect, but its strengths more than make up for its weaknesses. The game is fun because it's a multi-player political wargame that is largely abstract, thus lacking a lot of the fussy detail required of a true historical simulation.\"\n\nIt's been announced that games designer Alan Paull has been engaged by Gibsons Games to develop a new edition due for release in 2020 and is currently in prototype playtesting at events around England. \n\n"}

{"id": "1981710", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1981710", "title": "Matthew 4:1", "text": "Matthew 4:1\n\nMatthew 4:1 is the first verse of the fourth chapter of the Gospel of Matthew in the New Testament. This verse opens the section in Matthew dealing with the temptation of Christ by Satan. Jesus has just been baptized by John the Baptist in this verse he is led out into the wilderness.\n\nIn the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:\n\nThe New International Version translates the passage as:\n\nFor a collection of other versions see BibleHub Matthew 4:1.\n\nThe verse makes clear that the Spirit, presumably the Holy Ghost prominently mentioned two verses before in , is the one who leads Jesus into the desert. France states that it is clear that while Satan's goals were his own, the testing of Jesus was ordained by God. France also feels that \"tempted\" is a poor translation. He argues that the devil was \"testing\" Jesus. Led up refers specifically to moving upwards geographically, likely linking to climbing from the river side of the Jordan to a location of higher latitude in the wilderness. Keener notes that the specific wording may also be a reference to God leading his people into the wilderness in Exodus.\n\nThere is no evidence of what specific wilderness area is being referred to, other than that it was at a higher level than the river. Jones reports that the wilderness mentioned here has since the 5th century been believed to be the rocky and uninhabited area between Jerusalem and Jericho. A spot on Mount Quarantania is traditionally the exact location, and a Greek Orthodox monastery exists on the spot today. Jones notes that this was Jesus meeting the devil on the devil's ground. The desert is seen as outside the bounds of society and as the home of demons. Other scholars, such as France, disagree arguing that the wilderness was considered pure and holy in contrast to the corrupting cities. France also notes that Matthew 12 has the waterless desert as a place unpleasant to demons. Heading into the desert to battle with demons became an important part of the monastic tradition in later centuries.\n\nGundry notes that some have read this reference to the wilderness as a comparison to Adam in the Garden of Eden. Implying that this time Jesus will not sin, and thus redeem humanity. Gundry rejects this idea and believes that nowhere does Matthew's text imply such a comparison. Rather Gundry supports the popular view that the reference to the wilderness is an allusion to the Israelites after the Exodus and specifically to Moses.\n\nMatthew here uses the Greek word \"diabolos\" rather than the Hebrew \"satan\" used in Mark. Both words roughly translate as \"accuser\", but it seems clear that both terms were understood as the name of a specific being at the time Matthew was writing. Matthew gives no details about the devil. The devil's status as a fallen angel, his tail and pitchfork, and other embellishments are found nowhere in the Bible and were all products of later writings. In earlier parts of the Old Testament such as the Book of Job and 1 Chronicles the devil is portrayed as a lieutenant of God who works in a role that Albright and Mann describe as the \"opposing council,\" testing humans on behalf of God. Over time, perhaps under the influence of Iranian dualism, Satan became the great antagonist and this was the view that was current by the time the gospels were written. However, this verse seems to somewhat echo Satan's early role as God's tester.\n\nSome early manuscripts containing the text of this verse are:\n"}
{"id": "1981717", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1981717", "title": "Covenant of Baháʼu'lláh", "text": "Covenant of Baháʼu'lláh\n\nCovenant in the Baháʼí Faith refers to two separate binding agreements between God and man. A Covenant in the religious sense is a binding agreement made between God and man wherein a certain behaviour is required of man and in return God guarantees certain blessings. The concept of a covenant has been found in various religious scriptures including numerous covenant references in the Bible. In the Baháʼí Faith there is a distinction between a \"Greater Covenant\" which is made between every messenger from God and his followers concerning the next dispensation, and a \"Lesser Covenant\" that concerns successorship of authority within the religion after the messenger dies.\n\nThe greater covenant refers to the covenant made between each messenger from God, which the literature of the Baháʼí Faith name Manifestations of God, and his followers regarding the coming of the next Manifestation from God. According to Baháʼu'lláh, the founder of the Baháʼí Faith, God has promised that he will send a succession of messengers that will instruct humankind. In Baháʼí belief, this covenant is seen to be expressed in prophecy in the religious scripture of each religion, and each Manifestation of God, such as Abraham, Moses, Jesus, Muhammad, the Báb, and Baháʼu'lláh, prophesied the next Manifestation. In return, the followers of each religion are seen to have a duty to investigate the claims of the following Manifestations.\n\nIn Baháʼí belief, there is a single, imperishable God, who is the creator of all things, including all the creatures and forces in the universe. Though inaccessible directly, God is nevertheless seen as conscious of his creation, with a mind, will and purpose. In Baháʼí belief, God expresses this will at all times and in many ways, including through a series of divine messengers referred to as Manifestations of God. In expressing God's intent, these Manifestations are seen to establish religion in the world. Thus they are seen as an intermediary between God and humanity.\n\nThe Manifestations of God are not seen as an incarnation of God, but they are also not seen as an ordinary mortal. Instead, the Baháʼí concept of the Manifestation of God emphasizes simultaneously the humanity of that intermediary and the divinity in the way they show forth the will, knowledge and attributes of God; thus they have both human and divine stations.\n\nʻAbdu'l-Bahá explains this station:\nGod is pure perfection, and creatures are but imperfections. For God to descend into the conditions of existence would be the greatest of imperfections; on the contrary, His manifestation, His appearance, His rising are like the reflection of the sun in a clear, pure, polished mirror. All the creatures are evident signs of God, like the earthly beings upon all of which the rays of the sun shine. But upon the plains, the mountains, the trees and fruits, only a portion of the light shines, through which they become visible, and are reared, and attain to the object of their existence, while the Perfect Man [the Divine Manifestation] is in the condition of a clear mirror in which the Sun of Reality becomes visible and manifest with all its qualities and perfections. So the Reality of Christ was a clear and polished mirror of the greatest purity and fineness. The Sun of Reality, the Essence of Divinity, reflected itself in this mirror and manifested its light and heat in it; but from the exaltation of its holiness, and the heaven of its sanctity, the Sun did not descend to dwell and abide in the mirror. No, it continues to subsist in its exaltation and sublimity, while appearing and becoming manifest in the mirror in beauty and perfection.\n\nNow if we say that we have seen the Sun in two mirrors-- one the Christ and one the Holy Spirit--that is to say, that we have seen three Suns, one in heaven and the two others on the earth, we speak truly. And if we say that there is one Sun, and it is pure singleness, and has no partner and equal, we again speak truly.\n\nIn essence, the Manifestations of God are seen as divine educators, who are raised up by God with the purpose of uplifting mankind and expressing his will. In expressing God's intent, these Manifestations are seen to establish religion in the world and each one brings a book, and reveals teachings and laws according to the time and place which they appear.\n\nProgressive revelation is a core teaching in the Baháʼí Faith that suggests that religious truth is revealed by God progressively and cyclically over time through a series of divine Messengers, and that the teachings are tailored to suit the needs of the time and place of their appearance. Thus, the Baháʼí teachings recognize the divine origin of several world religions as different stages in the history of one religion, while believing that the revelation of Baháʼu'lláh is the most recent (though not the last), and therefore the most relevant to modern society.\n\nThe general theme of the successive and continuous religions founded by Manifestations of God is that there is an evolutionary tendency, and that each Manifestation of God brings a larger measure of revelation (or religion) to humankind than the previous one. The differences in the revelation brought by the Manifestations of God is stated to be not inherent in the characteristics of the Manifestation of God, but instead attributed to the various worldly, societal and human factors; these differences are in accordance with the \"conditions\" and \"varying requirements of the age\" and the \"spiritual capacity\" of humanity. These differences are seen to be needed since human society has slowly and gradually evolved through higher stages of unification from the family to tribes and then nations.\n\nʻAbdu'l-Bahá has expressed progressive revelation within the context of Greater Covenant as:\nAbraham, on Him be peace, made a covenant concerning Moses and gave the glad-tidings of His coming. Moses made a covenant concerning the promised Christ, and announced the good news of His advent to the world. Christ made a covenant concerning the Paraclete and gave the tidings of His coming. The Prophet Muhammad made a covenant concerning the Báb, and the Báb was the One promised by Muhammad, for Muhammad gave the tidings of His coming. The Báb made a Covenant concerning the Blessed Beauty, Baháʼu'lláh, and gave the glad-tidings of His coming for the Blessed Beauty was the One promised by the Báb. Baháʼu'lláh made a covenant concerning a Promised One Who will become manifest after one thousand or thousands of years. That Manifestation is Baháʼu'lláh's Promised One, and will appear after a thousand or thousands of years.\n\nIn Baháʼí belief, the Báb fulfils the prophecies of Islam as being the Mahdi foretold by Muhammad; Baháʼu'lláh is seen to fulfil the messianic prophecies found in world religions. Baháʼu'lláh stated that his claims to being several messiahs converging one person were the symbolic, rather than literal, fulfilment of the messianic and eschatological prophecies found in the literature of the major religions. Baháʼu'lláh's eschatological claims constitute six distinctive messianic identifications: from Judaism, the incarnation of the \"Everlasting Father\" from the \"Yuletide prophecy\" of Isaiah 9:6, the \"Lord of Hosts\"; from Christianity, the \"Spirit of Truth\" or Comforter predicted by Jesus in his farewell discourse of John 14-17 and the return of Christ \"in the glory of the Father\"; from Zoroastrianism, the return of Shah Bahram Varjavand, a Zoroastrian messiah predicted in various late Pahlavi texts; from Shiʻa Islam the return of the Third Imam, Imam Husayn; from Sunni Islam, the return of Jesus, Isa; and from Bábism, He whom God shall make manifest. He also claimed to have fulfilled the prophecies of Hinduism and Buddhism.\n\nBaháʼu'lláh taught that people have a two-fold obligation that they need to meet in response to God's promise to continually send messengers. The two obligations are to recognize and accept the new Manifestation when he comes, and secondly to obey and put into practice the teachings which they bring; Baháʼu'lláh has stated that neither of these obligations is acceptable without the other. He wrote:\n\nThe first duty prescribed by God for His servants is the recognition of Him Who is the Day Spring of His Revelation and the Fountain of His laws, Who representeth the Godhead in both the Kingdom of His Cause and the world of creation. Whoso achieveth this duty hath attained unto all good... It behoveth every one who reacheth this most sublime station, this summit of transcendent glory, to observe every ordinance of Him Who is the Desire of the world. These twin duties are inseparable. Neither is acceptable without the other... They whom God hath endued with insight will readily recognize that the precepts laid down by God constitute the highest means for the maintenance of order in the world and the security of its peoples... Hasten to drink your fill, O men of understanding. They that have violated the Covenant of God by breaking His commandments, and have turned back on their heels, these have erred grievously in the sight of God, the All-Possessing, the Most High.\n\nand:\nBe thou assured in thyself that verily, he who turns away from this Beauty hath also turned away from the Messengers of the past and showeth pride towards God from all eternity to all eternity.\n\nThis is the covenant that is made regarding the successorship of authority within the religion. In Baháʼí belief the manner in which the Covenant of Baháʼu'lláh was clearly put forth is seen as being a fundamental defining feature of the religion and a powerful protector of the unity of the Baháʼí Faith and its adherents.\n\nBaháʼu'lláh established the successorship of the Baháʼí Faith with a document called the Book of the Covenant which was written in his own hand and entrusted by him to ʻAbdu'l-Bahá before his passing. In this document Baháʼu'lláh reaffirmed his mission, exhorted the peoples of the world to observe that which will elevate them and forbade conflict and contention, while clearly and emphatically placing successorship of the Faith in the hands of the \"Most Mighty Branch\", which was a title reserved exclusively for ʻAbdu'l-Bahá.\n\n\n"}

His research and teaching interests centered on American and world military history, World War II, and the American Civil War. One of Weigley's most widely received contributions to research is his hypothesis of a specifically American Way of War, i.e. an approach to strategy and military operations, that, while not predetermined, is distinct to the United States because of cultural and historical constraints.\n\nWeigley was born in Reading, Pennsylvania on July 2, 1930. He graduated from Albright College in 1952, attended the University of Pennsylvania for his master's degree and doctorate, and wrote his dissertation under Pulitzer Prize-winning historian, Roy F. Nichols. It was published as \"Quartermaster General of the Union Army: A Biography of M.C. Meigs\" (Columbia University Press, 1959). After receiving his degree, Weigley taught at Penn from 1956 to 1958, and from 1958 to 1962 at Drexel University. Then he joined the faculty at Temple as an associate professor and remained until his retirement in 1998 as Distinguished University Professor. The school considered him the heart and soul of the history department, and at one point he had over 30 PhD candidates working under him concurrently. He also was a visiting professor at Dartmouth College and the U.S. Army War College at Carlisle, Pennsylvania.\n\nWeigley's graduate teaching emphasized military history defined in a broadly comprehensive way, including operational, combat history but also extending to the larger issues of war and its significance; to the history of ideas about war, peace, and the armed forces; and to the place of the soldier in the state and in society.\n\nWeigley was awarded a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship, 1969–70. He received the Athenaeum Literary Award in 1983. In 1989, he was awarded the Samuel Eliot Morison Prize of the American Military Institute. In 1992, \"Age of Battles\" received the Distinguished Book Award given by the American Military Institute. He has served as president of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania and the American Military Institute. In recognition of his scholarly achievements, Weigley was named Distinguished University Professor at Temple in 1985.\n\nWeigley died in Philadelphia on March 3, 2004, of a heart attack.

It found that the \"Queensland Coast Islands Declaratory Act 1985\", which attempted to retrospectively abolish native title rights, was not valid according to the \"Racial Discrimination Act 1975\".\n\nThe case was closely related to another proceeding in the High Court (\"Mabo v Queensland (No 2)\", decided in 1992) which was a dispute between the Meriam people (of the Mer Islands in the Torres Strait) and the Government of Queensland, in which several Meriam people, principally Eddie Mabo, contested that they had certain native title rights over the Murray Islands. In 1985, the Queensland Government passed the \"Queensland Coast Islands Declaratory Act\", which was intended to retrospectively abolish any such native title rights, if they existed.\n\nThe Meriam people sought a demurrer to prevent the Queensland Government from relying on the \"Coast Islands \"Declaratory\" Act\" in their defence to the main case.\n\nThe main argument of the plaintiffs was that the \"Coast Islands Act\" was invalid, because it was contrary to the \"Racial Discrimination Act 1975\", a law passed by the Parliament of Australia. Section 109 of the Constitution of Australia provides that where an Act of a state parliament is inconsistent with an Act of the Parliament of Australia, the state act is invalid to the extent of the inconsistency. As such, the plaintiffs argued that the Queensland Government was not able to rely on the \"Coast Islands Act\" as part of their defence in the main case. The Queensland Government argued that the Act was valid, and had the effect of extinguishing any rights which the plaintiffs may have had, which may have survived annexation of the islands in 1879.\n\nBoth parties agreed that the case should proceed on the assumption that the plaintiffs did actually hold native title rights, although the question had not been decided yet. The court agreed that the \"Coast Islands Act\" did operate to extinguish native title rights, if indeed they did exist. The main question was thus whether the \"Coast Islands Act\" was valid.\n\nSection 10(1) of the Act provides that Commonwealth or State laws which deprive a person of one race or ethnic group of a right enjoyed by another group, then that law does not have effect. An important question was whether laws which have the effect of removing or limiting rights which are held \"only\" by a certain group falls under section 10(1).\n\nThe majority judgment of Justices Brennan, Toohey and Gaudron found that native title rights, if they did exist, should really be treated as part of a broader human right to own and inherit property. They said that the effect of the \"Coast Islands Act\" was to arbitrarily deprive the Meriam people of their traditional property, by denying their native title rights. As such, their right to own and inherit property was limited. By this reasoning, the demurrer was allowed and the Queensland Government was not allowed to rely on the \"Coast Islands Act\".\n\nThis case was a significant step towards the recognition in the main case, \"Mabo v Queensland (No 2)\", that native title existed.\n\n"}

{"id": "1981775", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1981775", "title": "Far-red", "text": "Far-red\n\nFar-red light is a range of light at the extreme red end of the visible spectrum, just before infra-red light. Usually regarded as the region between 700 and 780 nm wavelength, it is dimly visible to human eyes. It is largely reflected or transmitted by plants because of the absorbance spectrum of chlorophyll, and it is perceived by the plant photoreceptor phytochrome. However, some organisms can use it as a source of energy in photosynthesis. Far-red light also is used for vision by certain organisms such as some species of deep-sea fishes and mantis shrimp.\n\nPlants perceive light through internal photoreceptors absorbing a specified wavelength signaling (photomorphogenesis) or transferring the energy to a plant process (photosynthesis). In plants, the photoreceptors cryptochrome and phototropin absorb radiation in the blue (B: λ=400-499) spectrum and regulate internal signaling such as hypocotyl inhibition, flowering time, and phototropism. Additional receptors called phytochrome absorb radiation in the red (R: λ=660 nm) and far-red (FR: λ=730 nm) spectra and influence many aspects of plant development such as germination, seedling etiolation, transition to flowering, shade avoidance, and tropisms. Phytochrome has the ability to interchange its conformation based on the quantity or quality of light it perceives and does so via photoconversion from phytochrome red (Pr) to phytochrome far-red (Pfr). Pr is the inactive form of phytrochrome, ready to perceive red light. In a high R:FR environment, Pr changes conformation to the active form of phytochrome Pfr. Once active, Pfr translocates to the cellular nucleus, binds to phytochrome interacting factors (PIF), and targets the PIFs to the proteasome for degradation. Exposed to a low R:FR environment, Pfr absorbs FR and changes conformation back to the inactive Pr. The inactive conformation will remain in the cytosol, allowing PIFs to target their binding site on the genome and induce expression (i.e. shade avoidance through cellular elongation).\n\nFR has long been considered a minimal input in photosynthesis. In the early 1970’s, PhD physicist and soil crop professor Dr. Keith J. McCree lobbied for a standard definition of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR: λ=400-700 nm) which did not include FR. More recently, scientists have provided evidence that a broader spectrum called photo-biologically active radiation (PBAR: λ=280-800 nm) is more applicable terminology. This range of wavelengths not only includes FR, but also UV-A and UV-B. The Emerson Effect established that the rate of photosynthesis in red and green algae was higher when exposed to R and FR than the sum of the two individually. This research laid the ground work for the elucidation of the dual photosystems in plants. Photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII) work synergistically; through photochemical processes PSII transports electrons to PSI. Any imbalance between R and FR leads to unequal excitation between PSI and PSII, thereby reducing the efficiency of photochemistry.\n\n"}

Based on a story by Malvin Wald, the film depicts the police investigation that follows the murder of a young model, incorporating heavy elements of police procedure. A veteran cop is placed in charge of the case and he sets about, with the help of other beat cops and detectives, to find the girl's killer. The movie, shot partially in documentary style, was filmed on location on the streets of New York City and features landmarks such as the Williamsburg Bridge, the Whitehall Building, and an apartment building on West 83rd Street in Manhattan as the scene of the murder.\n\nThe film received two Academy Awards, one for cinematography for William H. Daniels and another for film editing to Paul Weatherwax. In 2007, \"The Naked City\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\nIn the late hours of a hot New York summer night, a pair of men subdue and kill Jean Dexter, an ex-model, by knocking her out with chloroform and drowning her in her bathtub. When one of the murderers gets conscience-stricken while drunk, the other kills him and throws his body into the East River.\n\nHomicide Detective Lt. Dan Muldoon and his young associate, Det. Jimmy Halloran, are assigned to Jean's case, which the medical examination has determined was murder. Muldoon has been a homicide cop for 22 years, Halloran for three months. At the scene, the police interrogate Martha Swenson, Jean's housekeeper, about Jean's boyfriends, and she tells them about a \"Mr. Henderson\". They also discover a bottle of sleeping pills and her address book. Halloran questions the doctor who prescribed the pills, Lawrence Stoneman, and Ruth Morrison, another model and Jean's friend. Back at the police station, Muldoon questions Frank Niles, Jean's ex-boyfriend, who lies about everything, claiming only a business relationship with Jean and denying knowing Ruth. Because of his lies, Niles becomes the prime suspect. Later, Muldoon deduces from the bruises on Jean's neck that she was killed by at least two men.\n\nThat evening, Jean's estranged parents, Mr. and Mrs. Batory, arrive in New York to formally identify the body and tell the detectives that they have no knowledge of Jean's acquaintances. The next morning, the detectives learn that Niles sold a gold cigarette case stolen from Stoneman, then purchased a one-way airline ticket to Mexico. They also discover that one of Jean's rings was stolen from the home of a wealthy Mrs. Hylton. At Mrs. Hylton's Park Avenue apartment, the police learn that the ring actually belonged to her daughter, who, to their surprise, turns out to be Ruth. Learning that Ruth's engagement ring is also stolen property, and that she is engaged to Niles, Muldoon and Halloran take Ruth to Niles' apartment, where they coincidentally interrupt someone trying to murder him. The killer takes a shot at the cops and escapes down the fire escape onto the nearby elevated train. When questioned about the stolen jewelry, Frank claims that they were all presents from Jean, which reveals his true relationship with her, much to Ruth's chagrin. Ruth realizes she is engaged to a loser and slaps him. Niles is then arrested for the jewel thefts, but the murder case remains open.\n\nHalloran learns that a body recovered from the East River, that of small-time burglar Peter Backalis, died within hours of the Dexter murder, and believes the two incidents are connected. Muldoon, although skeptical, lets him pursue the lead and assigns two veteran detectives on the squad to help Halloran with the legwork. Through further methodical but tedious investigation, Halloran discovers that Backalis's accomplice on a jewelry store burglary was Willie Garzah, a former wrestler with a penchant for playing the harmonica. While Halloran and his team canvass the Lower East Side of New York using an old publicity photograph of Garzah, Muldoon compels Frank Niles to identify Jean's mystery boyfriend. Dr. Stoneman is \"Henderson\". At Stoneman's office, Muldoon uses Frank to trap the married physician into confessing that he fell in love with Jean, only to learn that she and Frank were using him in order to rob his society friends. Frank then confesses that Garzah killed Jean and Backalis. Halloran and Muldoon, using different approaches, have come up with the same killer.\n\nMeanwhile, Halloran finally locates Garzah and, pretending that Backalis is in the hospital, tries to trick Garzah into accompanying him, but Garzah (knowing he killed Backalis) sees through the ruse. The ex-wrestler rabbit punches the rookie detective, momentarily knocking him unconscious. Garzah attempts to disappear in the crowded city, but as police descend upon the neighborhood, he panics and draws attention to himself when he shoots and kills a blind man's guide dog on the pedestrian walk of the Williamsburg Bridge. Garzah attempts to flee over the bridge but, as police approach from both directions, he starts climbing one of the towers and is shot and wounded. High on the tower, Garzah refuses to surrender; gunfire is exchanged, and he is hit again and falls to his death.\n\nAs aerial and street shots of New York are shown, the narration concludes by saying \"There are eight million stories in the naked city. This has been one of them.\"\n\nProducer Mark Hellinger, who also narrated the film, was only 44 when he died of a heart attack on December 21, 1947, after reviewing the final cut of the film at his home.\n\nThe visual style of \"The Naked City\" was inspired by New York photographer Weegee, who published a book of photographs of New York life titled \"Naked City\" (1945). Weegee was hired as a visual consultant on the film, and is credited with helping to craft its imagery. But film historian William Park, despite Weegee's work on the film and its title coming from Weegee's earlier work, has argued that the film owes its visual style more to Italian neorealism (of which \"The Bicycle Thief\" is a well-known example) rather than Weegee's photographic work.\n\nThe movie features the uncredited film debuts of Kathleen Freeman, Bruce Gordon, James Gregory, Nehemiah Persoff, and John Randolph in small roles. Randolph, along with Paul Ford, who also had a small part, was appearing at the time on the New York stage in \"Command Decision\". John Marley, Arthur O'Connell, David Opatoshu, and Molly Picon had small, uncredited roles.\n\nThe film was a considerable hit at the box office.\n\nFilm critic Bosley Crowther, while having problems with the script, liked the location shooting and wrote \"Thanks to the actuality filming of much of its action in New York, a definite parochial fascination is liberally assured all the way and the seams in a none-too-good whodunnit are rather cleverly concealed. And thanks to a final, cops-and-robbers \"chase\" through East Side Manhattan and on the Williamsburg Bridge, a generally talkative mystery story is whipped up to a roaring 'Hitchcock' end.\"\n\nIn July 2018, it was selected to be screened in the Venice Classics section at the 75th Venice International Film Festival.\n\nWins\n\nNominations\n\nThe film was the inspiration for a half-hour television series of the same name, which used the film's famous concluding line. The characters of Muldoon and Halloran initially returned in the series, but they were now played by John McIntire and James Franciscus. The series ran for a single season in 1958 to 1959, earning an Emmy Award nomination as Best Drama. It was resurrected in Fall 1960 as an hour-long drama, which ran from October 1960 to September 1963. The film was the direct inspiration for the case by the same name in the 2011 video game \"LA Noire\". The case follows the plot of the film very closely, including the doctor’s name and alternative alias being the same.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1981808", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1981808", "title": "Mark Rudd", "text": "Mark Rudd\n\nMark William Rudd (born June 2, 1947) is a political organizer, mathematics instructor, anti-war activist and counterculture icon most well known for his involvement with the Weather Underground.\n\nRudd became a member of the Columbia University chapter of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) in 1963. By 1968, he had emerged as a leader for Columbia's SDS chapter. During the 1968 Columbia University Protests, he served as spokesperson for dissident students protesting a variety of issues, most notably the Vietnam War. As the war escalated, Mark Rudd worked with other youth movement leaders to take SDS in a more militant direction. While much of the general membership of SDS refused to go in a more violent direction, Rudd together with some other prominent SDS members formed a paramilitary organization inspired by the Red Guard, referring to themselves collectively as \"Weatherman\" after the lyrics from a famous Bob Dylan song.\n\nRudd went \"underground\" in 1970, hiding from law enforcement following the Greenwich Village townhouse explosion that killed three of his Weather Underground peers. He surrendered to authorities in 1977, serving a short jail sentence. After serving as a mathematics instructor at Central New Mexico Community College, he is now retired in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Rudd has since expressed regret for his role in the Weather Underground, and now advocates for nonviolence and electoral change.\n\nRudd was born in Irvington, New Jersey. His father, Jacob S. Rudd (1909–1995), was born Jacob Shmuel Rudnitsky in Stanislower (Yiddish for Stanisławów), Poland; he was a former army officer who sold real estate in Maplewood, New Jersey. His mother, Bertha Bass (1912–2009), was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey, the year after her parents emigrated from Lithuania. Rudd had a brother, David R. Rudd (1939–2009), who became an attorney. His family was Jewish. Rudd attended Columbia High School in his hometown of Maplewood, New Jersey, and later Columbia University in New York.\n\nMark Rudd's website says that his commitment to \"fighting U.S imperialism\" was inspired by the revolutionary movement in Cuba, which at that time was in its ninth year.\n\nIn 1968, Rudd and Bernardine Dohrn and other leaders of SDS were invited to Cuba to meet with Cuban, Soviet, and North Vietnamese delegates. His experiences in Cuba strengthened Rudd's anti-war and pro-Communist sentiments. Rudd had described the life of Cuba as \"extremely humanistic\" and he idealized Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara, referring to him as the \"Heroic Guerrilla.\"\n\nOnce he returned from Cuba, Rudd was elected President of the Columbia chapter of SDS. In 1968, during his junior year, Rudd was expelled from Columbia after a series of sit-ins and riots that disrupted campus life and attracted nationwide attention. These events culminated in the dramatic occupation of several campus buildings, including the Administration building, Low Memorial Library, and which ended only after violent clashes between students and the New York Police Department.\n\nThe Columbia protest was not the first student revolt on an American campus, but as it occurred at a relatively conservative Ivy League school located just up the street from the headquarters of the nation's news media, it received considerable press coverage and drew many supporters. The protests produced the slogan \"Create Two, Three, Many Columbias!\" The Doonesbury character Mark Slackmeyer was inspired by Rudd.\n\nIn 1969, as SDS membership grew rapidly, members' views concerning both goals and methods began to diverge widely. Rudd felt that SDS was not doing enough to protest the war in Vietnam. He was a leader of the Revolutionary Youth Movement (RYM), a faction of SDS, which advocated a more militant course of action while other factions within SDS were becoming concerned about Rudd's increasingly vocal calls for violent confrontation and hardline Communist sentiments. The 1969 SDS convention effectively splintered and ended the organization. Rudd and other former RYM members ultimately formed Weatherman, a self-proclaimed \"organization of communist women and men.\" The new organization was intent on overthrowing the government through violent actions. Spreading communism was a priority for the members of Weather, as when Rudd told other members of SDS, \" Don't be timid about telling people we're Communist. Don't deny it, be proud of it.\"\n\nRudd and other members of Weatherman participated in an SDS National Action on October 8–11, 1969, an event which became known as the Days of Rage. Charges filed against demonstrators following this action threatened the movement and its supporters. Rudd was demoted within the organization in January 1970. \n\nRudd, along with other prominent members of Weather, went underground in March 1970 following the Greenwich Village townhouse explosion, an incident in which three members of the organization died when an explosive device, intended for a servicemen's ball, detonated prematurely. The dead were Terry Robbins, Diana Oughton, and Ted Gold, who was Rudd's friend and partner in RYM and the Columbia sit-ins. \n\nWeatherman had already come to the attention of the FBI, but this explosion caused the members of Weatherman to take further precautions and to engage in more clandestine operations and according to some Weatherman members like Bill Ayers, build an underground revolutionary movement. According to Kirkpatrick Sale, Rudd was regarded as arrogant and politically ignorant by the other leaders, and was further demoted in the organization by the end of the year.\n\nAfter the townhouse explosion, the government actively sought to apprehend Mark Rudd and twelve other members of the Weather Underground Organization (WUO). For seven years Rudd lived underground, although he was disengaged from the WUO for most of that time.\n\nOn September 14, 1977, Rudd turned himself in to authorities, tired of life as a fugitive. He had been living and working under an assumed name just a few miles from the Columbia campus in Brooklyn and was increasingly frustrated over his lifestyle which included his inability to see his family as well as working in manual labor jobs beneath his education. Due to FBI abuses against Vietnam protestors and others during the COINTELPRO program, Rudd could not be convicted of many of the crimes alleged in the original government complaint against him that led to his fugitive status. He received a small fine and ultimately spent less than one year in jail for all his crimes. His first public appearance was on campus, where he spoke to a crowd of hundreds of admiring students. He was not the firebrand the crowd expected, but he did participate in a march around the campus after the speech.\n\nIn the summer of 1978, Mark and his then-girlfriend, Sue LeGrand, moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico. During his time there he became an instructor of mathematics at Central New Mexico Community College (then known as the Albuquerque Technical Vocational Institute, or TVI). At the time he was hired and during his early employment at the college, Rudd's years as a student radical and Federal fugitive were almost unknown to his students and other faculty members who seldom asked if he was \"that\" Mark Rudd. Most of these individuals were of a different generation and the name \"Mark Rudd\" had ceased to be a household word. Rudd regarded this lack of critical attention with some disdain.\nIn 1990, he published a memoir called \"Truth and Consequences: The Education of Mark Rudd\", which detailed his life with SDS, the Columbia University riots, and his time as a fugitive.\n\nRudd was interviewed for the 2002 documentary, \"The Weather Underground\", in which he stated that although the group's motivations, to end the Vietnam War and to oppose US imperialism, were justified, the violent actions performed in pursuit of those beliefs were questionable. He was the only former Weather member featured in the film that regretted his involvement in the group.\n\nToday Rudd lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico, with his wife, Marla (Painter). Rudd maintains a website called MarkRudd.com where he frequently posts essays and other writings, including his opinions on contemporary issues, and a personal appearance schedule. He travels around the country in support of the newly reborn Students for a Democratic Society. Rudd, along with Brian Kelly of Pace SDS, have helped establish ties between the new SDS and the Kent State University movement. He recently published another book on his time with SDS and The Weathermen called \"Underground: My Life with the SDS and the Weathermen,\" which was published by Harper Collins in 2009 and is more a personal memoir on his life and times rather than a political statement as was his first book.\n\nDocumentary filmmaker Sam Green made a 2008 short entitled \"Clear Glasses\", which focuses on a pair of glasses Rudd sent him.\n\nIn 2008, Rudd spoke about the Vietnam War era activities of SDS and his involvement in them for the award-winning documentary film \"Superpower\" by Barbara-Anne Steegmuller.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1981809", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1981809", "title": "XrML", "text": "XrML\n\nXrML is the eXtensible Rights Markup Language which has also been standardized as the Rights Expression Language (REL) for MPEG-21. XrML is owned by ContentGuard.\n\nXrML is based on XML and describes rights, fees and conditions together with message integrity and entity authentication information.\nMark Stefik, a researcher at Xerox PARC, is known as the originator of the concepts that became the XrML language. Stefik was engaged in research on the topic of trusted systems for secure digital commerce, of which one part was a language to express the rights that the system would allow users to perform on digital resources.\n\nThe first version of the rights expression language that became XrML was developed at Xerox PARC, and called the Digital Property Rights Language (DPRL). DPRL appears in a patent filed by Xerox in November 1994 (and was granted in February 1998) entitled: \"System for Controlling the Distribution and Use of Digital Work Having Attached Usage Rights Where the Usage Rights are Defined by a Usage Rights Grammar\" (US Patent 5,715,403, issued to Xerox Corporation).\n\nBetween 1994 and 1998, Xerox formed its Rights Management Group to continue the work represented in the patent. In November 1998, Xerox issued the first XML version of the Digital Property Rights Language (DPRL), labelled Version 2.0. Prior to that time, DPRL had been written in the LISP programming language.\n\nThe DPRL 2.0 documentation makes it clear that DPRL was designed for machine-to-machine interaction, with rights expressed as machine actionable functions. It also states clearly that in interpreting a DPRL-based expression of rights, only those rights that are explicitly granted can be acted upon. Any areas where a rights expression is silent must be interpreted as rights not granted, and therefore must be denied by the software enforcing the rights. \n\nIn 1999, version 2 of DPRL was licensed to a new company founded by Microsoft and Xerox called ContentGuard, which developed DPRL into the eXtensible rights Markup Language (XrML). Version 1 of XrML was published in 2001. \n\nXrML 1.0 was an evolution of DPRL. It expanded much of the management structure of DPRL, adding unique identifiers, private and public keys, and other mechanisms for identifying and verifying the authenticity of the issuer and the user of the resource. It also added certification for hardware and software that would be part of the trusted environment. The rights list remained the same, although the definitions of individual rights changed somewhat. In particular, XrML 1.0 distinguished clearly between those rights that created a new resource versus those that modified an existing resource.\n\nVersion 2.0 of XrML was a radical departure from all that preceded it. Where DPRL and XrML 1.0 contained specific language for machine-actionable rights (\"copy\" \"transfer\" \"backup\" \"install\" etc.) version 2.0 was an abstract rights language with only a few core elements. The core elements of XrML 2.0 are the ones needed to establish trust between systems so that transactions can take place. These include the issuer of the license, the other parties to the license, and the ability to include resources and rights, digital signatures, etc. This version is not specific to any medium or type of resource, and has been generalized to control rights on digital resources, services, or any other digital entity.\n\nIn March 2002, Hari Reddy of ContentGuard became chair of a new OASIS technical committee on rights languages. In a meeting on May 21, ContentGuard appears to have presented a new version of XrML, 2.1, as the starting point for the committee's work. The group disbanded later in that year, unable to agree on a direction for the work. ContentGuard was also working with the Electronic Book Exchange (EBX) in 2000, and later the Open eBook Forum (OeBF), on the development of standards for digital rights management for eBooks. In 2003, the OeBF \"Rights and Rules\" working group developed a draft standard rights expression language based on XrML 2.0, however this standards effort halted and has not been revived at this writing.\n\nAt this same time, ContentGuard was participating in the MPEG-21 standards committee, where XrML was proposed as the basis for Part 5 of the MPEG-21 standard (ISO/IEC 21000), the Rights Expression Language. Through a member vote of the International Organization for Standardization, the MPEG-21 standard, including Part 5, became an official international standard. ContentGuard ceased work on XrML at the point that it became adopted as an official standard; ISO/IEC 21000-5 is its current manifestation.\n\n"}
{"id": "1981818", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1981818", "title": "Migrant worker", "text": "Migrant worker\n\nA migrant worker is a person who either migrates within their home country or outside it to pursue work. Migrant workers usually do not have the intention to stay permanently in the country or region in which they work.\n\nMigrant workers who work outside their home country are also called foreign workers. They may also be called expatriates or guest workers, especially when they have been sent for or invited to work in the host country before leaving the home country.\n\nThe International Labour Organization estimated in 2014 there were 232 million international migrants worldwide who were outside their home country for at least 12 months and approximately half of them were estimated to be economically active (i.e. being employed or seeking employment). Some countries have millions of migrant workers. Some migrant workers are illegal immigrants. Some are slaves.\n\nThe \"United Nations Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families\" defines migrant worker as follows:\n\nThe Convention has been ratified by Mexico, Brazil, and the Philippines (among many other nations that supply foreign labour) but it has not been ratified by the United States, Germany, and Japan (among other nations that receive foreign labor).\n\nGuest workers may have their status defined in their host country by a particular guest worker program.\n\nAn estimated 14 million foreign workers live in the United States, which draws most of its immigrants from Mexico, including 4 or 5 million undocumented workers. It is estimated that around 5 million foreign workers live in Northwestern Europe, half a million in Japan, and around 5 million in Saudi Arabia. A comparable number of dependents are accompanying international workers.\n\nForeign nationals are accepted into Canada on a temporary basis if they have a student visa, are seeking asylum, or under special permits. The largest category however is called the Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP), under which workers are brought to Canada by their employers for specific jobs. In 2006, there were a total of 265,000 foreign workers in Canada. Amongst those of working age, there was a 118% increase from 1996. By 2008, the intake of non-permanent immigrants (399,523, the majority of whom are TFWs), had overtaken the intake of permanent immigrants (247,243). In order to hire foreign workers, Canadian employers must acquire a Labour Market Impact Assessment administered by Employment and Social Development Canada.\n\nSince the 1960s, farmers in Ontario and other provinces have been meeting some of their seasonal labour needs by hiring temporary workers from Caribbean countries and, since 1974, from Mexico under the Canadian Seasonal Agricultural Workers Program (CSAWP). This federal initiative allows for the organized entry into Canada of low- to mid-level skilled farm workers for up to eight months a year to fill labour shortages on Canadian farms during peak periods of planting, cultivating and harvesting of specified farm commodities. The program is run jointly with the governments of Mexico and the participating Caribbean states, which recruit the workers and appoint representatives in Canada to assist in the program's operations.\n\nNon-agricultural companies in Canada have begun to recruit under the temporary foreign worker program since Service Canada's 2002 expansion of an immigration program for migrant workers.\n\nAs of 2002, the federal government introduced the Low Skill Pilot Project. This project allows companies to apply to bring in temporary foreign workers to fill low skill jobs. The classification of \"low skill\" means that workers require no more than high school or two years of job-specific training to qualify.\n\nIn 2006, the federal Conservatives expanded the list of occupations that qualified for the Low Skill Pilot Project and increased the speed of processing applications.\n\nImmigrants often take any available job, and often they find employment in the fields. The work often consists of hard manual labour, often with unfair pay. The article \"Migrant Farmworkers: Is government doing enough to protect them?”, by William Triplett, states that the median annual income was $7,500, and 61% had income below the poverty level. After losing their cultural identity immigrants try to find a way to feed their families, and end up being exploited. Triplett also says that since 1989, \"their average real hourly wages (in 1998 dollars) had dropped from $6.89 to $6.18\", and that immigrants suffer physical as well as economic exploitation in the work place.\n\nAn estimated 14 million foreign workers live in the United States, which draws most of its immigrants from Mexico, including 4 or 5 million undocumented workers.\n\nGreen card workers are individuals who have requested and received legal permanent residence in the United States from the government and who intend to work in the United States on a permanent basis. The United States’ Diversity Immigrant Visa (DV) Lottery program authorizes up to 50,000 immigrant visas to be granted each year. This help facilitate foreign nationals with low rates of immigration to the United States a chance to participate in a random drawing for the possibility of obtaining an immigration visa.\n\nIn Asia, some countries in East and Southeast Asia offer workers. Their destinations include Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Brunei and Malaysia. \nOverall, the Chinese government has tacitly supported migration as means of providing labour for factories and construction sites and for the long-term goals of transforming China from a rural-based economy to an urban-based one. Some inland cities have started providing migrants with social security, including pensions and other insurance.\nIn 2012, there were a reported 167 million migrant workers in China, with trends of working closer to home within their own or a neighbouring province but with a wage drop of 21%.\nBecause so many migrant workers are moving to the city from rural areas, employers can hire them to work in poor working conditions for low wages. Migrant workers in China are notoriously marginalized, especially due to the hukou system of residency permits, which tie one stated residence to all social welfare benefits.\n\nThere has been a substantial flow of people from Bangladesh and Nepal to India over recent decades in search of better work. Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute found that these migrant workers are often subject to harassment, violence, and discrimination during their journeys at their destinations and when they return home. Bangladeshi women appear to be particularly vulnerable. These findings highlight the need to promote migrants' rights with, among others, health staff, police and employers at destination.\n\nThe population of Indonesia, as the world's fourth largest, has contributed to the surplus of work forces. Combined with a scarcity of jobs at home, this has led numbers of Indonesians to seek work abroad. It is estimated that around 4.5 million Indonesians work abroad; 70% of them are women: most are employed in the domestic sector as maids and in the manufacturing sector. Most of them are between 18 and 35 years old. Around 30% are men, mostly working in plantations, construction, transportation and the service sector. Currently Malaysia employs the largest numbers of Indonesian migrant workers, followed by Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong, and Singapore. These are official numbers, the actual numbers might be far larger, due to unrecorded illegal entry of Indonesian workers into foreign countries. They are prone to exploitation, extortion, physical and sexual abuses, suffered by those enduring human trafficking. Several cases of abuses upon Indonesian migrant workers have been reported, and some have gained worldwide attention.\n\nDuring the Seventh Malaysia Plan (1995–2000), Malaysia's total population increased by 2.3% per year, while foreign residents (non-citizens) make up 7.6% of the total working-age population in Malaysia, not including illegal foreign residents. In 2008 the majority of migrant workers (1,085,658: 52.6%) originally came from Indonesia. This was followed by Bangladesh (316,401), Philippines (26,713), Thailand (21,065) and Pakistan (21,278). The total number of migrant workers from other countries was 591,481. Their arrival, if not controlled, will decrease the local population's employment opportunities. However, the arrival of migrant workers increased the country's output and reduced the wage rates in the local labor market. Despite the benefits achieved by both the sending and receiving countries, many problems arise in the receiving country, Malaysia. The number of migrant workers currently in Malaysia is very difficult to determine, although the numbers working legally, with a passport and a work permit, are known.\n\nIn 2013, the Commission on Filipinos Overseas (CFO) estimated that approximately 10.2 million Filipinos worked or resided abroad. In the census year of 2010, about 9.3 percent of Filipinos worked or resided abroad.\n\nMore than a million Filipinos every year leave to work abroad through overseas employment agencies, and other programs, including government-sponsored initiatives. Overseas Filipinos often work as doctors, physical therapists, nurses, accountants, IT professionals, engineers, architects, entertainers, technicians, teachers, military servicemen, seafarers, students and fast food workers. Also, a sizable number of women work overseas as domestic helpers and caregivers. The Philippine Overseas Employment Administration is an agency of the Government of the Philippines responsible for opening the benefits of the overseas employment program of the Philippines. It is the main government agency assigned to monitor and supervise recruitment agencies in the Philippines.\n\nSince the late 1970s, Singapore has become one of the major receiving countries of migrant workers in Southeast Asia with 1,340,300 foreign workers constituting 37% of the total workforce in December 2014. \n\nThe number of foreign domestic workers (FDWs) in Singapore increased from about 201,000 in 2010 to 255,800 in 2019, or by 27 per cent. As of 2019, one of every five Singaporean household hires a maid. In 1990, the ratio was about one in 13, with about 50,000 maids in Singapore at that time. Within Singapore there is evidence of a double sided problem: the country needs foreign workers, but doesn't want to interact with them. In 2008, when the government sought to covert a school into a worker dormitory in Serangoon Gardens, close to 1,500 households petitioned against it as they were concerned about the effects it would have on their property values. This represented a significant minority of the 7,000 households in the neighbourhood.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic led to further concerns about treatment of migrant workers, especially those in dormitories. COVID-19 in the dormitories saw a more rapid spread of the virus compared to the rest of the population in Singapore. According to the Minister of Manpower, Josephine Teo, approximately 200,000 workers live in 43 dormitories in Singapore with about 10 to 20 workers sharing each room. \n\nLike many nations, South Korea started as a labour exporter in the 1960s before its economic development in the 1980s changed it to a labor importer.\nIn 1993, the Industrial Trainee Program was established to meets the needs of migrant workers. It provided work for foreigners as trainees in small and medium-sized businesses. However, these workers were considered trainees and not official employees, so they could not receive protection under Korean labour laws. On 14 February 1995 Guidelines for the Protection and Management of Foreign Industrial Trainees provided legal and social welfare for migrant workers. The Act on the Employment of Foreign Workers which states that \"a foreign worker shall not be given discriminatory treatment on the ground that he/she is a foreigner\", was put into force on 16 August 2003. Later that year the numbers of migrant workers multiplied dramatically.\n\nEven though there has been a drastic rise of migrant workers in Korea and policies are in place for their protection, the lack of cheap labour in Korea has forced the Korean community to condone the maltreatment of illegal migrant workers, and other unsavoury practices. In response, the Korean government has increased the quota for migrant workers by 5,000, to 62,000 individuals in 2013. In addition, on 31 January 2013, the minimum wage for migrant workers increased to 38,880 KRW for eight hours per day or a monthly rate of 1,015,740 KRW.\nPrograms were put into place to protect migrant workers and ease their integration to Korean society. Programs sponsored by the government such as Sejonghakdang (세종학당), Multicultural Center of Gender Equality and Family Program, Foreign Ministry Personnel Center Program, and Ministry of Justice Social Integration Program provide free Korean language lessons for migrant workers. In addition, by fulfilling all the requirements of the Ministry of Justice Social Integration Program, migrant workers can apply for Korean citizenship without taking the Naturalization exams.\n\nThe E-9 Non-professional Employment visa was launched in order to hire foreigners to work in the manual labour field. The visa is only limited to people that come from 15 Asian countries including, the Philippines, Mongolia, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Cambodia, China, Bangladesh, Nepal, Kazakhstan, Myanmar and East Timor. A new visa, known as the C-3 visa, was launched on 3 December 2018 which allows one to stay in South Korea for up to 90 days within the visa's validity period of up to 10 years with no restrictions on the number of visits to the country. The visa is specifically designed for professionals like doctors, lawyers or professors, graduates who are enrolled in four-year-plus programs in South Korean universities and those with master's degrees or above from overseas. The visa is only granted to people from 11 Asian countries those being Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Vietnam.\n\nTraditionally, South Korea has appeared to largely accept overseas ethnic Koreans such as the Koreans of China and other Asians. Under the Employment Permit System launched in 2004 for foreign worker registration, 55% of those registered in 2007 were ethnic Koreans, mostly Chinese nationals of Korean descent. Among those who weren't ethnic Koreans, most were Asian with the largest groups being the Vietnamese, Thais, Mongolians, Indonesians and Sri Lankans. In 2013, there were 479,426 foreigners working in South Korea and holding nonprofessional working visas and 99% of them came from other Asian countries with ethnic Koreans from China at 45.6%, Vietnamese at 11.8%, Indonesians at 5.9%, Uzbeks at 5.1%, ethnic Chinese at 4.2%, Cambodians at 4%, Sri Lankans at 3.9%, Thais at 3.9%, Filipinos at 3.8% and Nepalis at 3.3%. The vast majority of foreign workers in South Korea come from other parts of Asia with most coming from China, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and Central Asia.\n\nSri Lanka is currently a net emigration country, however in recent years a gradual rise in immigrant workers in Sri Lanka has coincided with the decline in the departure of Sri Lankans leaving the country for overseas employment. As a result, the country has now been transitioning from a country that only sends workers overseas to one that both sends and receives migrant workers. Thousands of foreign workers have entered the country from other Asian countries to work in Sri Lanka with 8000 coming from China and others coming from Nepal, Myanmar, Bangladesh and India. In addition to lawfully residing and working foreigners in the country, there are those that have over-stayed their visas or have illegally entered the country. In 2017, there were 793 investigations on unauthorised workers in the country and 392 foreign nationals were removed. The number of illegal Nepali migrants hiding in Sri Lanka prompted Nepal to launch an investigation in 2016 in order to crack down on the illegal movement of its citizens into Sri Lanka. An estimate from a Sri Lankan minister in 2017 put the number of foreign workers in the country at 200,000. However this number has been disputed. Additionally, there have been allegations that there are 200,000 illegal workers from China, India and Bangladesh working in the country, however certain parties have also dismissed this claim.\n\nAs of June 2016, there are more than 600,000 migrant workers in Taiwan which are spread across different sectors of industry, ranging from construction workers, domestic helpers, factory workers and other manual jobs. Most of them come from Southeast Asia.\n\nIn Thailand, migrants come from bordering countries such as Burma, Laos and Cambodia. Many face hardships such as lack of food, abuse, and low wages with deportation being their biggest fear. In Bangkok, Thailand many migrant workers attend Dear Burma school where they study subjects such as Thai language, Burmese language, English language, computer skills and photography.\n\nIn 2016, around 7.14% (15,88,300 people) of total EU employment were not citizens, 3.61% (8,143,800) were from another EU Member State, 3.53% (7.741.500) were from a non-EU country. Switzerland 0.53%, France 0.65%, Spain 0.88%, Italy 1.08%, United Kingdom 1.46%, Germany 1.81% were countries where more than 0.5% of employees were not citizens. \nUnited Kingdom 0.91%, Germany 0.94% are countries where more than 0.9% of employees were from non-EU countries. \ncountries with more than 0.5% employees were from another EU country were Spain 0.54%, United Kingdom 0.55%, Italy 0.72%, Germany (until 1990 former territory of the FRG) 0.87%.\n\nThe recent expansions of the European Union have provided opportunities for many people to migrate to other EU countries for work. For both the 2004 and 2007 enlargements, existing states were given the rights to impose various transitional arrangements to limit access to their labour markets. After the Second World War, Germany did not have enough workers so laborers from other European states were invited to work in Germany. This invitation ended in 1973 and these workers were known as Gastarbeiter.\n\n1 March has become a symbolic day for transnational migrants' strike. This day unites all migrants to give them a common voice to speak up against racism, discrimination and exclusion on all levels of social life. The transnational protests on 1 March were originally initiated in the US in 2006 and have encouraged migrants in other countries to organise and take action on that day. In Austria the first transnational migrants' strike (\"\") took place in March 2011, in the form of common actions, e.g. a manifestation, but also in form of numerous decentralised actions.\n\nAccording to the Finnish trade union organizations SAK (Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions) and PAM Finnish Service Union United PAM foreign workers were increasingly abused in the construction and sectors in Finland in 2012, in some cases reporting hourly wages as low as two euros. Bulgarians, Kosovars and Estonians were the most likely victimised in the building trade.\n\nIn Nazi Germany, from 1940–42, Organization Todt began its reliance on guest workers, military internees, Zivilarbeiter (civilian workers), Ostarbeiter (Eastern workers) and Hilfswillige (\"volunteer\") POW workers.\n\nThe great migration phase of labor migrants in the 20th century began in Germany during the 1950s, as the sovereign Germany since 1955 due to repeated pressure from NATO partners yielded to the request for closure of the so-called 'Anwerbe' Agreement (German: Anwerbeabkommen).\nThe initial plan was a rotation principle: a temporary stay (usually two to three years), followed by a return to their homeland. The rotation principle proved inefficient for the industry, because the experienced workers were constantly replaced by inexperienced ones. The companies asked for legislation to extend the residence permits.\nMany of these foreign workers were followed by their families in the following period and stayed forever. Until the 1970s, more than four million migrant workers and their families came to Germany like this, mainly from the Mediterranean countries of Italy, Spain, the former Yugoslavia, Greece and Turkey.\nSince about 1990, came for the disintegration of the Soviet bloc and the enlargement of the European Union and guest workers from Eastern Europe to Western Europe\nSometimes, a host country sets up a program in order to invite guest workers, as did the Federal Republic of Germany from 1955 until 1973, when over one million guest workers (German: Gastarbeiter) arrived, mostly from Italy, Spain and Turkey.\n\nThe main destination for Armenian seasonal workers is Russia. Until the end of the 1990s, there was an act of a third huge wave of Armenian emigrants, which accounted for about one million people. The main destination was the Russian Federation (620,000) ․ When Armenia became Independent (1991), the number of people who leave the country permanently slowed down, whereas, the number of seasonal labor migrants mainly to Russia increased. According to a study conducted by the Ministry of Territorial Development and Administration, 95% of seasonal migrants and 75% of long-term migrants work in Russia as of the end of the year 2018, and the reason is supposed to be the membership with the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU). The First Deputy Minister of Territorial Administration and Development of Armenia, Vache Terteryan, once said:\nSince December 2008, Sweden has more liberal rules for labor immigration from 'third countries' – countries outside the European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA) – than any other country in OECD. The introduction of employer-driven labor immigration, motivated by the need to address labor shortages, resulted in large inflows of migrants also in low-skilled occupations in labor surplus sectors, for example the restaurant and cleaning sectors.\n\nThe underestimation of the required integration services by the state and the society of the host countries, but also by the migrants themselves. Switzerland's transformation into a country of immigration was not until after the accelerated industrialization in the second half of the 19th century. Switzerland was no longer a purely rural Alpine area but became a European vanguard in various industries at that time, first of textile, later also the mechanical and chemical industries. Since the middle of the 19th century especially German academics, self-employed and craftsmen, but also Italians, who found a job in science, industry, construction and infrastructure construction migrated to Switzerland.\n\nIn the United Kingdom migrant workers are denied National Health Service treatment unless they can afford to pay. Untreated illnesses can worsen and migrant workers can die from treatable illnesses that remain untreated.\n\nIn 1973, an oil boom in the Persian Gulf region (UAE, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, and Bahrain, which comprise the Gulf Cooperation Council), created an unprecedented demand for labor in the oil, construction and industrial sectors. Development demanded a labor force. This demand was met by foreign workers, primarily those from the Arab states, with a later shift to those from Asian countries. A rise in the standards of living for citizens of Middle Eastern countries also created a demand for domestic workers in the home.\n\nSince the 1970s, foreign workers have become a large percentage of the population in most nations in the Persian Gulf region. Growing competition with nationals in the job sector, along with complaints regarding treatment of foreign workers, have led to rising tensions between the national and foreign populations in these nations.\n\nRemittances are becoming a prominent source of external funding for countries that contribute foreign workers to the countries of the GCC. On average, the top recipients globally are India, the Philippines, and Bangladesh. In 2001, $72.3 billion was returned as remittances to the countries of origin of foreign workers, equivalent to 1.3% of the world GDP. The source of income remains beneficial as remittances are often more stable that private capital flows. Despite fluctuations in the economy of GCC countries, the amount of dollars in remittances is usually stable.\n\nThe spending of remittances is seen in two ways. Principally, remittances are sent to the families of guest workers. Though often put towards consumption, remittances are also directed to investment. Investment is seen to lead to the strengthening of infrastructure and facilitating international travel.\n\nWith this jump in earnings, one benefit that has been seen is the nutritional improvement in households of migrant workers. Other benefits are the lessening of underemployment and unemployment.\n\nIn detailed studies of Pakistani migrants to the Middle East in the early 1980s, the average foreign worker was of age 25–40 years. 70 percent were married, while only 4 percent were accompanied by families. Two thirds hailed from rural areas, and 83 percent were production workers. At the time, 40 percent of Pakistan's foreign exchange earnings came from its migrant workers.\n\nDomestic work is the single most important category of employment among women migrants to the Arab States of the Persian Gulf, as well as to Lebanon and Jordan. The increase of Arab women in the labour force, and changing conceptions of women's responsibilities, have resulted in a shift in household responsibilities to hired domestic workers. Domestic workers perform an array of work in the home: cleaning, cooking, child care, and elder care. Common traits of the work include an average 100-hour work week and virtually non-existent overtime pay. Remuneration differs greatly according to nationality, oftentimes depending on language skills and education level. This is seen with Filipina domestic workers receiving a higher remuneration than Sri Lankan and Ethiopian nationals.\n\nSaudi Arabia is the largest source of remittance payments in the world. Remittance payments from Saudi Arabia, similar to other GCC countries, rose during the oil boom years of the 1970s and early 1980s, but declined in the mid-1980s. As oil prices fell, budget deficits mounted, and most governments of GCC countries put limits on hiring foreign workers. Weaknesses in the financial sector and in government administration impose substantial transaction costs on migrant workers who send them. Costs, although difficult to estimate, consist of salaries and the increased spending required to expand educational and health services, housing, roads, communications, and other infrastructure to accommodate the basic needs of the newcomers. The foreign labor force is a substantial drain of the GCC states' hard currency earnings, with remittances to migrants' home countries in the early 2000s amounting to $27 billion per year, including $16 billion from Saudi Arabia alone. It has been shown that the percentage of the GDP that foreign labor generates is roughly equal to what the state has to spend on them.\n\nThe main concerns of developed countries regarding immigration centers are: (1) the local job seekers' fear of competition from migrant workers, (2) the fiscal burden that may result on native taxpayers for providing health and social services to migrants, (3) fears of erosion of cultural identity and problems of assimilation of immigrants, and (4) national security.\n\nIn immigrant-producing countries, individuals with less than a high school education continue to be a fiscal burden into the next generation. Skilled workers, however, pay more in taxes than what they receive in social spending from the state. Emigration of highly skilled workers has been linked to skill shortages, reductions in output, and tax shortfalls in many developing countries. These burdens are even more apparent in countries where educated workers emigrated in large numbers after receiving a highly subsidized technical education. \"Brain Drain refers to the emigration (out-migration) of knowledgeable, well-educated and skilled professionals from their home country to another country, [usually because of] better job opportunities in the new country.\"\n\nAs of 2007, 10 million workers from Southeast Asia, South Asia, or Africa live and work in the countries of the Persian Gulf region. Xenophobia in receiving nations is often rampant, as menial work is often allocated only to foreign workers. Expatriate labor is treated with prejudice in host countries despite government attempts to eradicate malpractice and exploitation of workers. Emigrants are offered substandard wages and living conditions and are compelled to work overtime without extra payment. With regards to injuries and death, workers or their dependents are not paid due compensation. Citizenship is rarely offered and labor can oftentimes be acquired below the legal minimum wage. Foreign workers often lack access to local labor markets. Oftentimes these workers are legally attached to a sponsor/employer until completion of their employment contract, after which a worker must either renew a permit or leave the country.\n\nRacism is prevalent towards migrant workers. With an increasing number of unskilled workers from Asia and Africa, the market for foreign workers became increasingly racialized, and dangerous or \"dirty\" jobs became associated with Asian and African workers noted by the term \"Abed\", meaning dark skin.\n\nForeign workers migrate to the Middle East as contract workers by means of the \"kafala\", or \"sponsorship\" system. Migrant work is typically for a period of two years. Recruitment agencies in sending countries are the main contributors of labor to GCC countries. Through these agencies, sponsors must pay a fee to the recruiter and pay for the worker's round-trip airfare, visas, permits, and wages. Recruiters charge high fees to prospective employees to obtain employment visas, averaging between $2,000 and $2,500 in such countries as Bangladesh and India. Contract disputes are also common. In Saudi Arabia, foreign workers must have employment contracts written in Arabic and have them signed by both the sponsor and themselves in order to be issued a work permit. With other GCC countries, such as Kuwait, contracts may be written or oral.\n\nDependence on the sponsor (\"kafeel\") naturally creates room for violations of the rights of foreign workers. Debt causes workers to work for a certain period of time without a salary to cover these fees. This bondage encourages the practice of international labour migration as women in situations of poverty are able to find jobs overseas and pay off their debts through work. It is common for the employer or the sponsor to retain the employee's passport and other identity papers as a form of insurance for the amount an employer has paid for the worker's work permit and airfare. Kafeels sell visas to the foreign worker with the unwritten understanding that the foreigner can work for an employer other than the sponsor.\n\nWhen a two-year work period is over, or with a job loss, workers must find another employer willing to sponsor them, or return to their nation of origin within a short time. Failing to do this entails imprisonment for violation of immigration laws. Protections are nearly non-existent for migrant workers.\n\nThe population in the current GCC states has grown more than eight times during 50 years. Foreign workers have become the primary, dominant labor force in most sectors of the economy and the government bureaucracy. With rising unemployment, GCC governments embarked on the formulation of labor market strategies to improve this situation, to create sufficient employment opportunities for nationals, and to limit the dependence on expatriate labor. Restrictions have been imposed: the sponsorship system, the rotational system of expatriate labor to limit the duration of foreigners' stay, curbs on naturalization and the rights of those who have been naturalized, etc. This has also led to efforts to improve the education and training of nationals. Localization remains low among the private sector, however. This is due to the traditionally low income the sector offers. Also included are long working hours, a competitive work environment, and a need to recognize an expatriate supervisor, often difficult to accept.\n\nIn 2005, low-paid Asian workers staged protests, some of them violent, in Kuwait, Bahrain, and Qatar for not receiving salaries on time. In March 2006, hundreds of mostly south Asian construction workers stopped work and went on a rampage in Dubai, UAE, to protest their harsh working conditions, low or delayed pay, and general lack of rights. Sexual harassment of Filipina housemaids by local employers, especially in Saudi Arabia, has become a serious matter. In recent years, this has resulted in a ban on migration of females under 21. Such nations as Indonesia have noted the maltreatment of women in the GCC states, with the government calling for an end to the sending of housemaids altogether. In GCC countries, a chief concern with foreign domestic workers is childcare without the desired emphasis on Islamic and Arabic values.\n\nPossible developments in the future include a slowdown in the growth of foreign labor. One contributor to this is a dramatic change in demographic trends. The growing birth rate of nationals in the GCC states will lead to a more competitive workforce in the future. This could also lead to a rise in the numbers of national women in the workforce.\n\nThe treatment of migrant workers in the UAE has been likened to \"modern-day slavery\". Migrant workers are excluded from the UAE's collective labour rights, hence migrants are vulnerable to forced labour. Migrant workers in the UAE are not allowed to join trade unions. Moreover, migrant workers are banned from going on strike. Dozens of workers were deported in 2014 for going on strike. As migrant workers do not have the right to join a trade union or go on strike, they don't have the means to denounce the exploitation they suffer. Those who protest risk prison and deportation. The International Trade Union Confederation has called on the United Nations to investigate evidence that thousands of migrant workers in the UAE are treated as slave labour.\n\nHuman Rights Watch have drawn attention to the mistreatment of migrant workers who have been turned into debt-ridden \"de facto\" indentured servants following their arrival in the UAE. Confiscation of passports, although illegal, occurs on a large scale, primarily from unskilled or semi-skilled employees. Labourers often toil in intense heat with temperatures reaching 40–50 degrees Celsius in the cities in August. Although attempts have been made since 2009 to enforce a midday break rule, these are frequently flouted. Those labourers who do receive a midday break often have no suitable place to rest and tend to seek relief in bus or taxi stands and gardens. Initiatives taken have brought about a huge impact on the conditions of the laborers. According to Human Rights Watch, migrant workers in Dubai live in \"inhumane\" conditions.\n\n\"See Women migrant workers from developing countries.\"\n\nAccording to the International Labour Organization, 48 per cent of all international migrants are women and they are increasingly migrating for work purposes. In Europe alone there are 3 million women migrant workers. The 1970s and 1980s have seen an increase in women migrant labourers in France and Belgium. In China, as of 2015 a third of their migrant workers were women who had moved from rural towns to bigger cities in search of employment. Female migrants work in domestic occupations which are considered part of the informal sector and lack a degree of government regulation and protection. Minimum wages and work hour requirements are ignored and piece-rates are sometimes also implemented. Women's wages are kept lower than men's because they are not regarded as the primary source of income in the family.\nWomen migrate in search of work for a number of reasons and the most common reasons are economic: the husband's wage is no longer enough to support the family. In some places, like China, for instance, rapid economic growth has led to an imbalance in the modernization of rural and urban environments, leading women to migrate from rural areas into the city to be a part of the push for modernization. Other reasons include familial pressure, on a daughter, for instance, who is seen as a reliable source of income for the family only through remittances. Young girls and women are singled out in families to be migrant workers because they don't have a viable alternative role to fulfil in the local village. If they go to work in the urban centres as domestic workers they can send home money to help provide for their younger siblings. Many of these women come from developing countries, and are low skilled. Additionally women who are widowed or divorced and have limited economic opportunities in their native country may be forced to leave out of economic necessity. Migration can also substitute for divorce in societies that don't allow or do not condone divorce.\n\nIn terms of migrant labour, many women move from a more oppressive home country to a less oppressive environment where they have actual access to waged work. As such, leaving the home and obtaining increased economic independence and freedom challenges traditional gender roles. This can be seen to strengthen women's position in the family by improving their relative bargaining position. They have more leverage in controlling the household because they have control over a degree of economic assets. However, this can lead to hostility between wives and husbands who feel inadequate or ashamed at their inability to fulfil their traditional role as breadwinner. The hostility and resentment from the husband can also be a source of domestic violence. Studies have also been done which point to changes in family structures as a result of migrant labour. These changes include increased divorce rates and decrease in household stability. Additionally, female migrant labour has been indicated as a source for more egalitarian relationships within the family, decline of extended family patterns, and more nuclear families. There is also a risk for infidelity abroad, which also erodes the family structure.\n\nResearchers identified three groups of women to represent the dimensions of gender roles in Singapore. The first group is made up of expatriate wives who are often reduced to dependent spouse status by immigration laws. The second group are housewives who left work in order to take care of the children at home. Although they are from the Singaporean middle class, they are stuck at almost the same level and share status with the third group, foreign domestic workers. Because of global economic restructuring and global city formation, the mobility of female labours is increasing. However, they are controlled through strict enforcement and they are statistically invisible in migration data. The female foreign domestic workers are always gender-stereotyped as maids and generalized as low wages workers in society.\n\nThe spread of global neoliberalism has contributed to physically displaced people, which translates to displaced workers, worldwide. Due to the national and transnational economic push and pull of migration, growing numbers of women migrant workers find themselves employed in the underground and informal sector. To be clear, these women tended not to be previously employed in the formal sector, if at all. Frequently, the cheap and flexible labor is sought in more developed areas. Also, these women migrant workers are often considered an asset to employers who think of these individuals as docile, compliant, and disposable.\n\nWork found in the informal economy is defined as being outside the legal regulation of the state. This underground sector includes nontraditional types of employment: intimate care, street vending, community gardening, food selling, sewing and tailoring, laundry service, water selling, car cleaning, home cleaning, and various kinds of artisan production. These positions are frequently precarious and lack the social contracts often found between employee and employer in the formal sector. This unofficial economy is often found in locations that are between home and work and combine personal and private spaces. Because migrant women workers often occupy the lowest economic positions, this leaves them especially vulnerable to exploitation and dangerous working conditions. Incidentally, Guy Standing has termed this kind of vulnerable worker, the Precariat.\n\nWomen are frequently at the bottom of the economic hierarchy due to various factors, mainly a lack of opportunity to support themselves and their families and in addition, a lack of adequate education. Despite the United Nations' Girls Education Initiative, there remains high rates of illiteracy among women in the Global South. Commonly, the informal sector is the only place where geographically displaced workers are able to insert themselves into the economy. Thus, women migrant workers perform a high percentage of work found in this sector.\n\nDue in part to complex migration issues which include the restructuring of gendered and familiar relations, women migrant workers frequently care for children without a local family network. The informal sector allows for public and private space to be merged and accommodate their care-taking responsibilities. New immigrants are often concerned with leaving children unattended and the informal sector allows for care-taking alongside of economic activities.\n\nIt is important to note, through case studies, it has been determined that men and women migrate for similar reasons. Mainly, they leave places in search of better opportunities, most often financial. In addition to the financial push, women also migrate to escape oppressive environments and/or abusive spouses.\n\nMigrant labour of women also raises special concerns about children. Female migrant workers may not have enough possibilities to care for their own children whilst being abroad. Their children may learn to regard their relatives at home as their parents and may rarely see their mothers. Frequently, children of migrant workers become migrant workers themselves. There is concern that this may have negative psychological effects on the children who are left behind. Although this has not been proven to be entirely true or false, studies have been done which show that many children of migrant workers manage reasonably well. One theory states that remittances to some degree make up for the lack of care by providing more resources for food and clothing. Additionally, some migrant mothers take great care in attempting to maintain familial relationships while abroad.\n\n\"See Migrant education.\"\n\nChildren of migrant workers struggle to achieve the same level of educational success as their peers. Relocation, whether it is a singular or regular occurrence, causes discontinuity in education, which causes migrant students to progress slowly through school and drop out at high rates. Additionally, relocation has negative social consequences on students: isolation from peers due to cultural differences and language barriers. Migrant children are also at a disadvantage because the majority live in extreme poverty and must work with their parents to support their families. These barriers to equal educational attainment for children of migrant workers are present in countries all over the world. Although the inequality in education remains pronounced, government policies, non-governmental organizations, non-profits, and social movements are working to reverse its effects.\n\nThe migrant workforce has historically played a vital role nationally and across local communities in recent times. Economic globalization has created more migrant workers than ever before. While developed countries have increased their demand for labour, especially unskilled labour, workers from developing countries are used. As a result, millions of workers and their families travel to other countries to find work. This influx of migrant workers contributes to growth of slums and urban poverty, according to Mike Davis. Some of these workers, usually from rural areas, cannot afford housing in cities and thus live in slums. Some of these unskilled workers living in slums suffer from unemployment and make a living in the informal sector. According to International Labor Organization, as of 2013 there were approximately 175 million migrants around the world.\n\nRecruitment of international workers through employment agencies is a common phenomenon in developed countries, such as the United States or the UAE. Especially members of underprivileged communities are attracted by the opportunities of living and working in the US. Some of these agencies make fraudulent promises. But even worse than false promises, some migrants are abused and mistreated by the agencies and their middlemen. Some migrant workers may have their passports and mobile phones confiscated, are imprisoned in the employer's home or at least strictly overseen and disconnected from society, friends and family; some may not receive their full wage and have to work unrestrained long hours without breaks or days off. Migrant workers may also be denied adequate food and living conditions, as well as medical treatment.\n\nIn a study done by the Human Rights Watch of 99 domestic workers in the United Arab Emirates, 22 alleged that their sponsors had physically abused them. Workers refuse to report their abuse due to fear of deportation and not being able to find a better job. It is common in some cases for a woman to fall victim to sexual violence and harassment, because the employers and their stories will always be trusted more.\n\nSome migrant workers flee from their abusive employers and seek help at the embassy or consulate of their home country. This however, is difficult to achieve in remote locations.\n\nA United States company, Signal International, led by an immigration lawyer, Malvern C. Burnett, and an Indian labor recruiter, Sachin Dewan, \"lured hundreds of Indian workers to a Mississippi shipyard with false promises of permanent US residency.\" This was under the H-2B visa guest worker program, to work as welders, pipefitters, and in other positions to repair damaged oil rigs and related facilities. Each worker paid the labor recruiters between $10,000 and $20,000 or more in recruitment fees and other costs after being promised good jobs, green cards, and permanent U.S. residency. Some went deep into debt. \"On arrival at Signal shipyards in Pascagoula, Mississippi, beginning in 2006, they discovered that they wouldn't receive the green cards or permanent residency, and that in fact, each would have to pay $1,050 a month to live in isolated, guarded labor camps where as many as 24 men shared a space the size of a double-wide trailer.\"\n\nSignal International \"had to compensate workers $14.4 million in a jury ruling to five Indian guest workers, one of the largest settlements of its kind in U.S. history. The ruling was based on the finding that the company and its agents engaged in labor trafficking, fraud, racketeering and discrimination, News India Times reported at that time. The jury also found that one of the plaintiffs was a victim of false imprisonment and retaliation.\"\n\nThere have been many cases of corruption among brokers who often act as if they have companies, often encouraging migrants to come to the United States. This was the case with broker, Kizzy Kalu was, \"a naturalized United States citizen from Nigeria\". \"He secured government approval to bring in Filipino nurses under a government visa program, claiming they would be paid up to $72,000 as instructors at an Adam University in Colorado, according to a 2012 criminal indictment of the labor broker.\" Adams State University did exist in Colorado, however Adam University was nonexistent just as much as the jobs that were supposed to be there for migrants. \"Kalu promised the nurses, most from the Philippines, jobs as nurse instructors/supervisors.\" \"He arranged with the Departments of Labor and Homeland Security to provide H-1B visas for the workers, saying that Adam University faced a labor shortage and needed foreign labor to serve as nursing instructors/supervisors,\" as a way to lure workers in.\n\nKizzy Kalu and \"other foreign nationals\" received compensation for these visas after they secured and received them for the soon to be workers. \"Kalu $6,500 for assistance in obtaining them. Upon arrival in Denver, Colorado, the nurses were told that there was no such place as Adam University. Instead, they were sent to \"work in nursing homes. The facilities paid Kalu's company, Foreign Health Care Professionals Group, $35 per hour for one of the nurses. Kalu then pocketed almost half the wage and paid the nurse $20 an hour.\" He continued to exploit these workers by allowing them to work while he was the one gaining their profit. He had to report to the government about these women and that they were in fact working in the country so that he could continue to receive funds, while they too continued working. And that is what he did. \"Documents he submitted to the government didn't indicate that he and his partner, Philip Langerman, were taking a large portion of the visa-holders' wages.\"\n\nEventually, this scheme that Kalu and his partner Phillip Langerman created began to become known to the public. Instead of the facilities paying the company they had created together from the work the women were doing, \"the nurses were paid directly by the facilities but were required to pay Kalu $1,200 a month or Kalu would send a letter to the Department of Homeland Security and they would lose their visas, prosecutors said.\" Soon, the nurses realized this kind of unfair treatment and mode of oppression and stopped paying him. Therefore, their visas got revoked because he reported this matter to officials.\n\nKizzy Kalu was guilty of \"trafficking in forced labor for luring foreign nurses to the United States with promises of high-paying jobs but then demanding they kick back a portion of their wages or face deportation.\" He was sentenced to nearly 11 years in prison and ordered to pay $3.8 million in restitution. He was convicted of 89 counts of mail fraud, visa fraud, human trafficking and money laundering. Kalu's partner, Philip Langerman, 78, of McDonough, Ga., was sentenced to three years of probation for his role in the criminal scheme. He, too, must pay restitution of $3.8 million.\" U.S. District Chief Judge Marcia Krueger said in this case unlike many others, \"Kalu did not sexually assault, isolate or strike his victims. She describe these cases as \"fraud and economic coercion.\"\n\nThere are other fraudulent cases by United States companies that recruit and employ Filipino workers. On 19 March 2013, in an article titled, \"Filipino Workers Urge Overhaul of U.S. Guest Worker Policies\", information is provided about the corruption in labor. \"The shipyard, Grand Isle Shipyard (GIS) in L.A., put the Filipinos to work on an oil production platform owned by Black Elk Energy, a U.S. company that, according to federal regulators, had racked up 315 documented \"incidents of safety non-compliance\" offshore since 2010.The problems at Black Elk Energy were amplified following an explosion in November on a platform in the Gulf of Mexico that claimed the lives of three Filipino workers, while three others were seriously injured.\" This problem became known because the work at this company against workers were very dangerous even before they were hired which is why work here was put to a stop. However this did not stop GIS. They needed to make their money and unfortunately the migrant workers were the ones who suffered.\n\n\"The main [hazardous condition] is the sleep deprivation that they experience – just long hours of work that the [U.S.] workers don't face. They're forced to work sometimes for two weeks straight, 70 hours a week.\" They hired and recruited many skillful men from the Philippines who were \"welders, pipefitters and scaffolders were trafficked under \"fraudulent\" contracts that promised high pay and safe working conditions. But many were placed for work on dangerous oil rig platforms.\"\n\nSince the early 1980s, increasing numbers of Mexican women have migrated to the United States in search of jobs. These women usually leave their families, including young children, behind in order to help maintain the family by sending remittances. After arriving in the U.S., many are put to work and live in places that are neither clean nor safe. Companies and traffickers promise legitimate jobs in America because they make money doing so.\n\nAn article \"Girl Next Door\", by Peter Landsman, examines this system, which is said to be brutal and inhumane oppression of migrant workers. \"On a tip, the Plainfield police raided the house in February 2002, expecting to find illegal aliens working an underground brothel. What the police found were four girls between the ages of 14 and 17. They were all Mexican nationals without documentation. But they weren't prostitutes; they were sex slaves. The distinction is important: these girls weren't working for profit or a paycheck. They were captives to the traffickers and keepers who controlled their every move.\" These girls, a large percentage are underaged, are forcefully lured from their homeland in Mexico and other parts of Latin America. This section mainly focused on the exploitation of men and women however, it was very disturbing to even learn that children were also trafficked and stolen from their homelands.\n\n\"They had been promised jobs as models and baby sitters in the glamorous United States, and they probably had no idea why they were sitting in a van in a backwater like Tijuana in the early evening.\"\n\n\"The police found a squalid, land-based equivalent of a 19th-century slave ship.\" There were doorless bathrooms, decaying sinks and mattresses, morning after pills (medications that can induce abortion) and girls were pale, exhausted and malnourished. However, this is just an example of one of the apartments and houses that were affected by this type of abuses. Many other houses or neighborhoods in the U.S that seem to be upscale and upper class are infested with these types of illegal actions.\n\nIn the agricultural sector (strawberry industry, ...) in some countries in Europe (Spain, Italy), sexual harassment, rape and even sexual exploitation occurs.\n\nThe \"People's Movement for Human Rights Education (PDHRE)\" have composed a list of fourteen rights for migrant workers.\n\n\"The Philippine government has long lauded the fact that, every day, some 4,500 Filipinos are sent abroad to work. The remittances they send back keeps the Philippine economy afloat.The government doesn't seem to provide any protection when these overseas Filipino workers run into distress. This labour export policy is still one of their pillars of development – pushing people to other countries instead of addressing poverty or lack of jobs at home.\" Instead of sending workers out just because the process helps the economy at their countries of origin, the country needs to examine ways in which they can work with the people to obtain jobs or at least create more jobs. When their skilled workers come to the United States and are often exploited, sexually, physically and mentally it not only affects the worker, but also the country upon their return-or if they are able to return at all due to the conditions they face. These are risky jobs and journeys taken by migrants to ensure themselves better lives and also their families. The governments need to do more. \"The exploitative immigration system of the U.S. works hand-in-hand with the corrupt labour export policy of the Philippines to maintain a steadily increasing flow of cheap, temporary migrant labour.\"\n\nMonica Rosales (a professor from Colorado State University) describes work-related injuries in her journal article titled \"Life in the field: Migrant farm workers’ perceptions of work related injuries\". Rosales discusses bone problems, respiratory problems and allergic reactions all in relation to the migrant farm work that immigrants do to make money. Rosales discussed how these working conditions affect the lives of immigrants. Rosales states that, \"The average life expectancy of migrant and seasonal farm workers is 49 years of age, in comparison to the U.S. average of 75 years of age\". On top of unfair wages, migrant workers often find themselves toiling in dangerous working conditions. The life expectancy compared to average is 26 years less for a migrant worker in the U.S.\n\nA survey by Lien Centre for Social Innovation in Singapore also found that over 60 per cent of lower-skilled South Asian migrant workers who are waiting for salary or injury compensation from employers were predicted to have serious mental illness.\n\nOn May 23, 2020, global experts and representatives of NGO's on human rights protection attended the virtual conference to urge policymakers to grant favorable measures for vulnerable groups who have had a more difficult time fighting COVID-19, including the elderly, disabled, and migrant workers.\n\nLike transnational migration, national (internal) migration plays an important role in poverty reduction and economic development. For some countries, internal migrants outnumber those who migrate internationally. For example, 120 million people were estimated to migrate internally in China compared to 458,000 people who migrated internationally for work. Situations of surplus labour in rural areas because of scarcity of arable land is a common \"push factor\" in the move of individuals to urban-based industries and service jobs. Environmental factors including drought, waterlogging, and river-bank erosion also contribute to internal migration.\n\nThere are four spatial patterns of internal migration:\n\nCircular migration, the temporary and repetitive movement of a migrant worker between home and host areas, can occur both internally and transnationally.\n\nIn 2015, scholar Gabriela Raquel Ríos published \"Cultivating Land-Based Literacies and Rhetorics,\" in which she theorizes the phrase \"land-based literacies and rhetorics.\" Her definition is as follows: These literacies (acts of interpretation and communication) and rhetorics (organizational and community-building practices) ultimately build a theory that 1) recognizes the ways in which land can produce relations and 2) recognizes the value of embodied ways of knowing (60).Ríos argues that migrant workers' rhetorical practices incorporate their relationship to land and labor in addition to language.\n\n\n\n\n"}

First she was paired with veteran New York news anchor Ernie Anastos, who had co-anchored WABC Eyewitness News with her in the 1980s, and then with Jim Rosenfield. In April 2006, she was moved from 11 p.m. to noon, co-anchoring with Mary Calvi. Abrams was replaced at 11 p.m. with veteran Dana Tyler (whom Abrams had replaced at 11 p.m. upon joining WCBS in 2003). In November 2006, however, Abrams left the air after WCBS-TV sports anchor Chris Wragge and newly hired Kristine Johnson (formerly of NBC News and MSNBC) became the anchors at noon and 5 p.m. (and eventually moved from noon to 11 p.m.). According to the \"New York Post\", Ms. Abrams was last reported as \"currently sitting out her contract – and collecting what's believed to be roughly $6 million that's due to her.\"\n\n\n\n"}

In 2017, New York City Mayor Bill DeBlasio honored Anastos by designating every March 21st to be Ernie Anastos Day.\n\nAnastos is a Hall of Fame Broadcaster and has won more than 30 Emmy awards and nominations, including \"Best Newscast in New York\" and the Edward R. Murrow Award for broadcast excellence. The New York Times recently described him as \"the ubiquitous anchorman.\"\n\nAfter graduating from Northeastern University, Anastos worked as a newsman at 98.5/WROR in Boston, as Ernie Andrews. In 1976, Anastos moved to television, becoming an anchor at WPRI-TV in Providence. In June 1978, WABC-TV in New York hired Anastos and he became anchor of the 11:00 pm \"Eyewitness News\" broadcast in November, a position that opened when Larry Kane left the station after one year and returned to Philadelphia. He anchored that broadcast with Rose Ann Scamardella until 1983 and later replaced Storm Field as Kaity Tong's co-anchor at 5:00 pm. Except for a brief period beginning in 1983 when WABC hired Tom Snyder to be anchor, Anastos helmed the 5:00 and 11:00 pm newscasts until 1989, co-anchoring at 5 and 11 with Tong and Roz Abrams at 5 from 1986 to 1989.\n\nAnastos left WABC to take an anchor position at WCBS-TV, beginning June 12, 1989.

Shortly thereafter he began hosting a gardening show on Lifetime, called \"Our Home\". \n\nIn 1997, Anastos returned to the anchor desk and was hired by WWOR-TV to replace Sean Mooney as co-anchor of its 10:00 pm newscast. Four years later he was back at WCBS, brought in to replace Stephen Clark as the lead anchor. He left for second time in 2005, after signing a five-year, $10 million contract with WNYW-TV. At Fox 5, he was partnered with Rosanna Scotto, from 2005-2009 for the news at 5 and 10p.m. until Scotto was moved to Co-host Good Day New York with Greg Kelly. It was announced that Dari Alexander would anchor with Anastos on the 5 p.m. and 10 p.m. newscasts. On July 2, 2012, he was moved off the 10 p.m. newscast and replaced by \"Good Day New York\" cohost Greg Kelly, who has since moved back to his prior role and been replaced by Steve Lacy. In June 2014, Ernie became the Anchor of the 6pm newscast, leaving the 5pm newscast with Dari Alexander, having Steve Lacy fill the position. \n\nAnastos has anchored coverage of the World Trade Center attacks. He also traveled to Cuba and met with Fidel Castro reporting on the 45th anniversary of the Cuban Revolution. He covered Cardinal John Joseph O'Connor's official trip to El Salvador and Nicaragua, and reported on the death and funeral of Princess Diana from London. Anastos also was nominated for an Emmy for his reporting on the death of John F. Kennedy, Jr. from the site of his plane crash near Cape Cod.\n\nAnastos has worked as a news anchor and reporter for \"CBS This Morning\", \"CBS Late News\", and substitute host for ABC's \"Good Morning America\".\n\nAnastos has become well known for a pair of gaffes on live television. In 2007, he directed viewers to visit \"myfoxny don cock\" instead of \"myfoxny dot com\", which is the website for WNYW. Then in 2009, following meteorologist Nick Gregory's weather forecast one evening where he made a joke playing off an old Perdue Farms advertising campaign, Anastos said, live on the air, \"It takes a tough man to make a tender forecast, Nick. Keep fucking that chicken.\"\n\nAnastos appeared in season eight, episode 10 of the television show \"24\".\nHe has been on air since the mid 1970s. In 2014, he joined the board of trustees at New York Institute of Technology.\n\nAnastos authored a book on the lifestyles of youth in America. His book, \"Twixt: Teens Yesterday and Today\", traces American teenagers' influence on social and political attitudes.\n\nHe has also been a regular columnist for \"Family Circle\".\n\nHe has won 28 Emmy Awards and nominations, and was nominated for the Edward R.

Some species are familiar as pests of stored food products. Notable species include the rice weevil (\"S. oryzae\"), wheat weevil (\"S. granarius\"), and maize weevil (\"S. zeamais\").\n\nThe rice and maize weevils have a nearly cosmopolitan distribution, occurring throughout the warmer parts of the world. In Europe they are replaced by the temperate Palaearctic wheat weevil.\n\nThe adult female weevil bores a hole in a grain, nut, or seed, and deposits an egg, usually one egg per individual grain. She seals the hole with a secretion. The larva develops while feeding on the interior of the grain, and then pupates. It usually leaves the grain completely hollow when it exits as an adult. The wheat weevil can live on acorns, and may have used them as a host before agriculture made grain plentiful. The rice weevil can live on beans, nuts, grains, and some types of fruit, such as grapes. Several other \"Sitophilus\" use the acorns of oaks such as bluejack oak (\"Quercus incana\") and moru oak (\"Q. floribunda\"). Some use the seeds of trees in the Dipterocarpaceae and the legume family, Fabaceae. The tamarind weevil (\"S. linearis\") is only known from the seeds of tamarind.\n\nSeveral \"Sitophilus\" species are hosts to an intracellular γ-Proteobacterium. Weevil and bacterium have a symbiotic relationship in which the bacterium produces nutrients such as amino acids and vitamins for the host, supplementing its cereal diet.\n\nAs of 1993, there are about 14 species of \"Sitophilus\".\n\nSpecies include:\n\nFossil taxa include:\n\n"}

In July 2018, he launched his new audio and video podcast, \"The Nick Di Paolo Show\". He was also an emcee on \"\".\n\nDi Paolo was born in Danvers, Massachusetts to parents Nick and Joan Di Paolo. In 1980, after graduating from high school, he attended the University of Maine where he became the running back of the university's football team and graduated in 1984 with a major in marketing. He said: \"I cheated my way through with a 2.3\" grade point average but picked this time as \"the best years of my life\". He joined the fraternity Sigma Nu. His brother also attended the university and did play-by-play commentary for the Maine Black Bears hockey team with Gary Thorne.\n\nAfter graduating Di Paolo landed several jobs, including office jobs in marketing and as a door-to-door salesman selling meat and seafood for Boston Gourmet. He recalled the job as fun and performed well, but felt burned out after two years. During this time, the stand-up comedy scene in the Boston area had picked up and a friend from university encouraged Di Paolo to go on stage as he regularly made his friends and colleagues laugh. Di Paolo was a fan of stand-up and was influenced by watching comedians appear on \"The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson\", David Letterman on \"The Mike Douglas Show\", Jay Leno on \"The Merv Griffin Show\", and Robert Klein. He had wanted to have a go for several years but \"didn't have the guts\" but his lack of enjoyment as a salesman \"led me to the stage\". Di Paolo performed his first routine in the summer of 1986 at an open mic night at Stitches club in Boston, travelling from a family barbecue with \"about 22 beers in me\". He recalled his five-minute set went \"pretty well\" and wanted to pursue it full time, but his salesman job required a temporary relocation to Rhode Island. In the spring of 1987, he returned to Boston and started to make regular appearances at local open mic nights.\n\nDi Paolo felt it took 12 years to find his voice through stand-up comedy, before he started to hone his act. From 1987 to 1992, he developed his act in clubs in the New England area, including the Comedy Vault, the Comedy Connection, and Stitches. Two years in, he did his first gigs in New York City which included a regular spot at Catch a Rising Star. He described his act during this early period as \"a rapid fire approach, four or five punches attached to every joke\". Upon moving to New York City, Di Paolo's act became more political from reading local newspapers and comparing views of each publication. In his first year as a stand-up comic, he secured Barry Katz as his manager and performed on over 300 nights. Di Paolo went on to live in New York City with comedian Louis C.K. as his roommate.\n\nIn 1992, Di Paolo relocated to Los Angeles to further his career as \"that's where the business is\". While there he developed his stand-up act in local comedy clubs and took on several television and film roles, including a regular role as Tony, a bartender on the sitcom \"Grace Under Fire\" from 1994 to 1997. He went on to make an early appearance on national television on \"The Arsenio Hall Show\" and featured on HBO's special focused on up and coming comics. He returned to the University of Maine to perform stand-up at Damn Yankee, located above the student's union, around five years into his new career. While in Los Angeles, Di Paolo befriended comedian and actor Artie Lange during an audition for a pilot that had Lange play the lead.\n\nDi Paolo's first comedy album, \"Born This Way\", was released in 1999. It was recorded at The Comedy Store in La Jolla, California after the venue had become one of his favourite venues. Its title was suggested by comedian Colin Quinn.\n\nAfter five years in Los Angeles, Di Paolo had considered returning to New York City when Chris Rock offered him a writing position on \"The Chris Rock Show\" which was based in the city. He accepted, and wrote for the first two seasons. In 2001, he and the team of writers were nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music, or Comedy Program. It was Di Paolo's second Emmy Award nomination. He looked back at his time on the show as one of the best times of his career and went on to work contributing to comedy scripts. By 2001, Di Paolo had settled in Queens.\n\nIn June 2001, Di Paolo made his first appearance on \"Late Show with David Letterman\" and later, filmed promos for the \"Comedy Central\" roast of Hugh Hefner. His appearances on \"The Howard Stern Show\" soon after led to comedy gigs nationwide with various staff from the show, including Stuttering John and Artie Lange, which further raised his profile.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2004, Di Paolo was a regular guest on the Comedy Central show \"Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn\". He recalled that he was contracted to appear on the show twice a week, but after some early episodes he was called into a meeting due to his risque jokes about Jewish people. Quinn managed to convince the producers to keep Di Paolo as a guest. He has appeared on several roasts for the network, including \"The Comedy Central Roast of Pamela Anderson\", \"The Comedy Central Roast of Denis Leary\", \"The Comedy Central Roast of Jeff Foxworthy\" and \"The Comedy Central Roast of Larry the Cable Guy\".\n\nIn 2004, Di Paolo released his second comedy album, \"Road Rage\". Like his first, it was titled by Quinn. Also that year, he starred in \"Shorties Watchin' Shorties\", an animated comedy series on Comedy Central, alongside Patrice O'Neal. They voice two unsupervised babies who comment on television clips, including performances by fellow stand-up comics. The idea originated from Di Paolo after the network wanted the pair to work together. He has done several Comics Come Home benefit shows.\n\nHe was cast as a police officer in Artie Lange's feature film \"Artie Lange's Beer League\" and in \"The Sopranos\". He also wrote for the 77th Academy Awards and the MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nFrom December 2006 to December 2007, Di Paolo hosted an afternoon radio show on WFNY in New York City. He left the station after management decided to change formats. He assembled a demo tape and approached other radio stations in the city to host a morning show, but it was too difficult. He then took any fill in spots on the air when he could, including Jerry Doyle, Dennis Miller, and Dan Patrick. In January 2008, Di Paolo began an occasional online talk show on BlogTalkRadio.\n\nOther television appearances include \"The Colin Quinn Show\" on NBC, \"NewsRadio\", \"Suddenly Susan\" and \"The Smoking Gun Presents\".\n\nHe has been a guest on radio shows, including \"The Howard Stern Show\", \"Opie and Anthony\", and \"The Dennis Miller Show\".\n\nHe was cast as the building superintendent on Louis C.K.'s HBO show \"Lucky Louie\", and appeared with a recurring role in Louis C.K.'s FX series \"Louie\".\n\nDi Paolo has done USO tours in Cuba and Japan. In 2008, he performed stand-up for US soldiers in Afghanistan as a part of Operation Mirth, which Lange named and headlined. He was joined by Gary Dell'Abate and Dave Attell.\n\nIn April 2011, Di Paolo's special \"Raw Nerve\" was released as part of the \"Comedy Central Presents...\" series and on the television network Showtime.\n\nIn October 2011, Di Paolo launched a syndicated sports entertainment radio show with Lange named \"The Nick & Artie Show\". Di Paolo left in January 2013 as he wanted to \"pursue some great opportunities\". Lange continued to host the show with former professional American football player Jon Ritchie that was renamed \"The Artie Lange Show\".\n\nIn October 2013, Di Paolo launched his weekly podcast, \"The Nick Di Paolo Podcast\", on the Riotcast network. The weekly episodes were free while additional episodes were exclusive to his ConnectPal donators. The podcast ended in April 2018 following his firing from SiriusXM, after 226 episodes.\n\nIn 2014, Di Paolo released his comedy special, \"Another Senseless Killing\". He wanted to film it in an intimate club setting and chose Acme in Minneapolis.\n\nIn late 2016, Di Paolo filmed his second comedy special for Comedy Central, entitled \"Inflammatory\". It was released on DVD and digital download in 2017.\n\nFrom May 15, 2017 to April 2018, Di Paolo hosted an evening radio show on the talk/comedy channel Faction Talk on Sirius XM Radio that aired from Monday through Thursday. Excerpts from the show were released as a weekly instalment of his podcast, \"The Nick Di Paolo Podcast\". The show was cancelled after Di Paolo had posted comments on his Twitter account that management deemed offensive, and was subsequently fired. One post, sent on the anniversary of the Columbine High School massacre, urged future school shooters to attack universities that had liberal leanings. Di Paolo maintained that his \"poorly worded tweet\" should have resulted in a temporary suspension \"at best\", and that SiriusXM had overreacted.\n\nIn March 2018, Di Paolo kicked off his nationwide Nick is Right Tour. On June 17, Di Paolo was punched by a female audience member after a gig at Levity Live in West Nyack, New York. While meeting fans outside the green room, her father had approached Di Paolo and informed him that his daughter \"...wants to punch you in the face\", during which she hit him below his left eye. Di Paolo contacted the police to file the incident and sought legal action.\n\nOn July 9, 2018, Di Paolo launched his new audio and video podcast, \"The Nick Di Paolo Show\". The one hour show airs live four days a week from his home studio. The free stream is broadcast live on YouTube.\n\nOn May 6, 2019, Di Paolo released his one-hour comedy special, \"A Breath of Fresh Air\", for free on YouTube. He wanted to release it \"without any media/industry filter\" that networks such as Netflix or Comedy Central have in place, and his management aimed to present Di Paolo to a wider audience to increase his profile. It was filmed in February 2019 at the Cohoes Music Hall in Cohoes, New York in front of a sold out crowd of 425. Di Paolo had performed at the venue two years prior and wanted to return to produce a special there. The original promotional image for the special depicted Di Paolo giving the middle finger to a group of protesters, among them the murdered black activist Muhiyidin Moye. The image was criticised from some Twitter users; Di Paolo apologised, saying he did not realise it was Moye as it was chosen from a collection of stock photos. The artwork was then altered to depict a different protester. After two days, the video had amassed 125,000 views.\n\nDi Paolo says he opposes political correctness, which he believes \"ruined this country\". Di Paolo was mentioned as part of a shock radio \"brethren\" in a \"New York Times\" article about CBS Radio's decision to fire Don Imus for referring to an African American college basketball player as a \"nappy headed ho\". The article described one of Di Paolo's bits in which he mocked an employee training manual entitled \"Words Hurt and Harm\", stating, \"Right away, we’re starting with a false premise, because words don't hurt\".\n\nDuring a 2015 interview on Marc Maron's \"WTF Podcast\", Di Paolo described his political outlook as \"center-right\" (noting that he doesn't oppose abortion or gay rights) and mentioned that his friend Colin Quinn had once quipped, \"you're not a political comedian, but you could tell a joke about McDonald's and everyone would know how you voted\".\n\nDi Paolo married his wife Andrea, in 2003.\n\nAfter returning to New York City in the early 2000s, Di Paolo moved into a condo in Tarrytown, New York. This was followed by a move to Westchester, New York in 2004. In April 2019, Di Paolo and his wife moved to Georgia.\n\n\n"}

It is located in Kings Domain, Melbourne, next to the Royal Botanic Gardens.\n\nGovernment House was opened in 1876, on land that had originally been set aside in 1841. Previous governors' residences included La Trobe's Cottage (1839–1854), Toorak House (1854–1874), and Bishopscourt (1874–1876). It was designed by William Wardell in the Italianate style, and modelled to some extent on Queen Victoria's Osborne House residence, to which it bears a strong resemblance. Between 1901 and 1930, Government House was used as the official residence of the Governor-General of Australia. This occurred during the period when Canberra was still under construction and Melbourne was designated as the temporary capital. Despite Parliament House opening in 1927, the Governor-General did not permanently move to Yarralumla for another three years, at which point Government House was given back to the Victorian government.\n\nThe land for Government House was set aside by Lieutenant-Governor of Victoria, Charles La Trobe, in 1841. In 1857, Ferdinand von Mueller, Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, landscaped the whole area, including Government House reserve, as one parkland. Construction of the building did not start until 1871 and was completed in 1876.\n\nWhile La Trobe was Lieutenant-Governor he lived in La Trobe's Cottage. Between 1854 and 1874, Governors lived at Toorak House, then they lived in Bishopscourt in East Melbourne until the present Government House was occupied in 1876.\n\nBetween the formation of the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901 and 1927, Government House was the official residence of the Governor-General of Australia. When the Federal Parliament commenced sitting in Canberra in 1927, the Governor-General stayed at Government House, Canberra at Yarralumla while Parliament was in session, but also continued living at Government House in Melbourne until 1930. During this period Governors of Victoria lived at Stonington mansion. The House has been in continuous use by the Governors of Victoria since 1934.\n\nGovernment House was designed by William Wardell, Inspector General of the Public Works Department, in the Victorian Period Italianate style, and is reminiscent of Queen Victoria's summer residence on the Isle of Wight, Osborne House. The building reflects the extravagant style of the period with a booming economy due to the Victorian gold rush.\n\nThe main building consists of three parts: the south wing with its extravagant single storey State Ballroom, a grand staircase hall entrance to the three storey State rooms and two storey vice-regal apartments to the north. Rising from the building is a 145-foot belvedere tower. The mews - a paved area surrounded on three sides by stables, coach houses and staff living quarters is nearby.\n\nThe garden was designed by John Sayce in 1873 and is thought to be the \"most intact 19th century mansion garden remaining in Melbourne\" by the Victorian Heritage Register. William Guilfoyle, curator of the Melbourne Botanic Gardens, further refined the original garden design with \"many fine mature trees, including conifers, Australian rainforest species and deciduous trees, which are characteristic of the era and which also reflect Guilfoyle’s personal taste.\"\n\n\n"}

Directed by American blacklisted filmmaker Jules Dassin, the film stars Jean Servais as the aging gangster Tony \"le Stéphanois\", Carl Möhner as Jo \"le Suédois\", Robert Manuel as Mario Farrati, and Jules Dassin as César \"le Milanais\". The foursome band together to commit an almost impossible theft, the burglary of an exclusive jewelry shop on the Rue de Rivoli. The centerpiece of the film is an intricate half-hour heist scene depicting the crime in detail, shot in near silence, without dialogue or music. The fictional burglary has been mimicked by criminals in actual crimes around the world.\n\nAfter he was blacklisted from Hollywood, Dassin found work in France where he was asked to direct \"Rififi\". Despite his distaste for parts of the original novel, Dassin agreed to direct the film. He shot \"Rififi\" while working with a low budget, without a star cast, and with the production staff working for low wages.\n\nUpon the initial release of the film, it received positive reactions from audiences and critics in France, the United States, and the United Kingdom. The film earned Dassin the award for Best Director at the 1955 Cannes Film Festival. \"Rififi\" was nominated by the National Board of Review for Best Foreign Film. \"Rififi\" was re-released theatrically in both 2000 and 2015 and is still highly acclaimed by modern film critics as one of the greatest works in French film noir.\n\nTony \"le Stéphanois\" has served a five-year prison term for a jewel heist and is out on the street and down on his luck. His friend Jo approaches him about a smash-and-grab proposed by mutual friend Mario in which the threesome would cut the glass on a Parisian jeweler's front window in broad daylight and snatch some gems. Tony declines. He then learns that his old girlfriend, Mado, took up in his absence with gangster Parisian nightclub owner Pierre Grutter. Finding Mado working at Grutter's, Tony invites her back to his rundown flat. She is obviously well-kept, and Tony savagely beats her for being so deeply involved with Grutter. Tony changes his mind about the heist; he now accepts on the condition that rather than merely robbing the window, they will take on the more difficult but more lucrative task of robbing the store's safe. Mario suggests they employ the services of Italian compatriot César, a safecracker. The four devise and rehearse an ingenious plan to break into the store and disarm its sophisticated alarm system.\n\nThe caper begins with the group chiseling through a cement ceiling from an upstairs flat on a Sunday night. The suspenseful break-in completed, the criminals appear to escape without leaving any trace of their identities. However, without the others' knowledge, César pocketed a diamond ring as a bauble for his lover Viviane, a chanteuse at Grutter's club. The heist makes headline news and the four men arrange to fence the loot with a London contact. Meanwhile, Grutter has seen Mado and her injuries, who breaks off their relationship. Infuriated at Tony's interference in his life, he gives heroin to his drug-addicted brother Rémy and tells him to murder Tony. Grutter sees the diamond César gave to Viviane and realizes that César, Mario, and Tony were responsible for the jewel theft. Grutter forces César to confess. Forsaking a 10 million franc police reward, Grutter decides to steal the jewels from Tony's gang, his brother Rémy brutally murdering Mario and his wife Ida when they refuse to reveal where the loot is hidden. Tony retrieves it from the couple's apartment and anonymously pays for a splendid funeral for them. He then goes looking for Grutter and stumbles onto the captive César, who confesses having squealed. Citing \"the rules,\" Tony ruefully kills him.\n\nMeanwhile, seeking to force their adversaries' hand, Grutter's thugs kidnap Jo's five-year-old son Tonio and hold him for ransom. The London fence arrives with the payoff, after which Tony leaves to single-handedly rescue the child by force, advising Jo it is the only way they will see him alive. With Mado's help, he tracks Tonio down at Grutter's country house and kills Grutter's brothers Rémy and Louis while rescuing him. On the way back to Paris, Tony learns Jo has cracked under the pressure and agreed to meet Grutter at his house with the money. When he arrives Grutter tells him Tony has already snatched the child and kills Jo. Seconds too late to save his friend, Tony is mortally wounded by Grutter before killing him as he tries to flee with the loot. Bleeding profusely, Tony drives maniacally back to Paris and delivers Tonio home safely before dying at the wheel as police and bystanders close in on him and a suitcase filled with 120 million francs in cash.\n\n\nThe film \"Rififi\" was originally to be directed by Jean-Pierre Melville, a later luminary of the heist film genre. Melville gave his blessing to American director Jules Dassin when the latter asked for his permission to take the helm. It was Dassin's first film in five years. He had been blacklisted in Hollywood after fellow director Edward Dmytryk named him a Communist to the House Committee on Un-American Activities in April 1951. Subsequently, Dassin attempted to rebuild his career in Europe. Several such film projects were stopped through long-distance efforts by the US government. Dassin attempted a film \"L'Ennemi public numero un\", which was halted after stars Fernandel and Zsa Zsa Gabor withdrew under American pressure. An attempt to film an adaptation of Giovanni Verga's \"Mastro don Gesualdo\" in Rome was halted by the US Embassy. Dassin received an offer from an agent in Paris, France where he met producer Henri Bérard who had acquired the rights to Auguste Le Breton's popular crime novel \"Du Rififi chez les hommes\". Bérard chose Dassin due to the major success in France of Dassin's previous film \"The Naked City\".\n\nUsing his native English, Dassin wrote the screenplay to \"Rififi\" in six days with the help of screenwriter René Wheeler, who subsequently took the material and translated it to French. Dassin hated the novel; he was repelled by the story's racist theme in which the rival gangsters were dark Arabs and North Africans pitted against light-skinned Europeans. As well, the book portrayed disquieting events such as necrophilia—scenes that Dassin did not know how to bring to the big screen. Bérard suggested making the rival gang Americans, assuming Dassin would approve. Dassin was against this idea as he didn't want to be accused of taking oblique revenge on screen. Dassin downplayed the rival gangsters' ethnicity in his screenplay, simply electing the Germanic \"Grutter\" as surname. The greatest change from the book was the heist scene, which spanned but ten pages of the 250-page novel. Dassin focused his screenplay on it to get past other events he did not know what to do with. As produced, the scene takes a quarter of the film's running time and is shot with only natural sound, with no spoken words or music.\n\nWorking with a budget of $200,000, Dassin could not afford top stars for the film. To carry the lead role, Dassin selected Jean Servais, an actor whose career had slumped due to alcoholism. For Italian gangster Mario Ferrati, Dassin cast Robert Manuel after seeing him perform a comic role as a member of Comédie-Française. After a suggestion made by the wife of the film's producer, Dassin cast Carl Möhner as Jo the Swede. Dassin would use Möhner again in his next film \"He Who Must Die\". Dassin himself played the role of the Italian safecracker César the Milanese. Dassin explained in an interview that he \"had cast a very good actor in Italy, whose name escapes me, but he never got the contract!...So I had to put on the mustache and do the part myself\". \n\n\"Rififi\" was filmed during the wintertime in Paris and used real locations rather than studio sets. Due to the low budget, the locations were scouted by Dassin himself. Dassin's fee for writing, directing, and acting was US$8,000. Dassin's production designer, to whom he referred as \"one of the greatest men in the history of cinema\" was Alexandre Trauner. Out of friendship for Dassin, Trauner did the film for very little money. Dassin argued with his producer Henri Bérard on two points: Dassin refused to shoot the film when there was sunlight claiming that he \"just wanted grey\"; and that there were to be no fist fights in the film. Such fight scenes had been important to the popular success in France of the Lemmy Caution film series.\n\n\"Rififi\"'s heist scene was based on an actual burglary that took place in 1899 along Marseille's cours St-Louis. A gang broke into the first floor offices of a travel agency, cutting a hole in the floor and using an umbrella to catch the debris in order to make off with the contents of the jeweler's shop below. The scene where Tony regretfully chooses to kill César for his betrayal of the thieves' code of silence was filmed as an allusion to how Dassin and others felt after finding their contemporaries willing to name names in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee. This act was not in the original novel.\n\nGeorges Auric was hired as the composer for the film. Dassin and Auric originally could not agree about scoring the half-hour caper scene. After Dassin told Auric he did not want music, Auric claimed he would \"protect [him]. I'm going to write the music for the scene anyways, because you need to be protected\". After filming was finished, Dassin showed the film to Auric once with music and once without. Afterward, Auric agreed the scene should be unscored.\n\nIn 2001, Dassin admitted that he somewhat regretted the \"Rififi\" theme song, utilized only to explain the film's title which is never mentioned by any other film characters. The title (World War I French military slang) is almost un-translatable into English; the closest attempts have been \"rough and tumble\" and \"pitched battle.\" Dassin mistakenly thought the author had created the word himself to refer to Moroccan Berbers because of the Rif War. The song was written in two days by lyricist Jacques Larue and composer Philippe-Gérard after Dassin turned down a proposal by Louiguy. Magali Noël was cast as Viviane, who sings the film's theme song. Noël would later act for Italian director Federico Fellini, appearing in three of his films.\n\n\"Rififi\" debuted in France on 13 April 1955. The film was banned in some countries due to its heist scene, referred to by the \"Los Angeles Times\" reviewer as a \"master class in breaking and entering as well as filmmaking\".\nThe Mexican interior ministry banned the film because of a series of burglaries mimicking its heist scene. \"Rififi\" was banned in Finland in 1955 and released in severely cut form in 1959 with an additional tax because of its content. In answer to critics who saw the film as an educational process that taught people how to commit burglary, Dassin claimed the film showed how difficult it was to actually carry out a crime.\n\n\"Rififi\" was a popular success in France which led to several other \"Rififi\" films based on le Breton's stories. These films include \"Du rififi chez les femmes\" (1959), \"Du rififi à Tokyo\" (1963), and \"Du rififi à Paname\" (1966). On its United Kingdom release, \"Rififi\" was paired with the British science fiction film \"The Quatermass Xperiment\" as a double bill; this went on to be the most successful double-bill release in UK cinemas in all of 1955. The film was offered distribution in the United States on the condition that Dassin renounce his past, declaring that he was duped into subversive associations. Otherwise, his name would be removed from the film as the writer and director. Dassin refused and the film was released by United Artists who set up a dummy corporation as the distributing company. The film was distributed successfully in America with Dassin listed in the credits; in this way he was the first to break the Hollywood blacklist. \"Rififi\" was released in the United States first with subtitles and then later with an English dub under the title \"Rififi...Means Trouble!\". The film was challenged on release by The Roman Catholic Legion of Decency; as a result, the film suffered three brief cuts, and opened with a title card quoting the Book of Proverbs stating \"When the wicked are multiplied, crime shall be multiplied: but the just shall see their downfall\". After this change, the film passed with a B rating. In 2005, \"Variety\" announced that Stone Village Pictures had acquired the remake rights to \"Rififi\", the producers intending to place the film in a modern setting with Al Pacino taking the lead role.\n\nIn North America, \"Rififi\" has been released on both VHS and DVD. The VHS print has been reviewed negatively by critics. Roger Ebert referred to it as \"shabby\" while Bill Hunt and Todd Doogan, the authors of \"The Digital Bits Insider's Guide to DVD\", referred to the VHS version as \"horrible\" and with \"crappy subtitles\". The Criterion Collection released a DVD version of the film on 24 April 2001. In the United Kingdom, \"Rififi\" was released on DVD by Arrow Films on 21 April 2003, and on Region B Blu-ray by the same publisher on 9 May 2011. The film was released to Blu-Ray in Region 1 by Criterion on 14 January 2014.\n\nUpon its original release, film critic and future director François Truffaut praised the film, stating that \"Out of the worst crime novel I ever read, Jules Dassin has made the best crime film I've ever seen\" and \"Everything in \"Le Rififi\" is intelligent: screenplay, dialogue, sets, music, choice of actors. Jean Servais, Robert Manuel, and Jules Dassin are perfect.\" French critic André Bazin said that \"Rififi\" brought the genre a \"sincerity and humanity that break with the conventions of a crime film, and manage to touch our hearts\". In the February 1956 issue of the French film magazine \"Cahiers du cinéma\", the film was listed as number thirteen in the top twenty films of 1955. The film was well received by British critics who noted the film's violence on its initial release. \"The Daily Mirror\" referred to the film as \"brilliant and brutal\" while the \"Daily Herald\" made note that \"Rififi\" would \"make American attempts at screen brutality look like a tea party in cathedral city\". The American release of the film also received acclaim. Bosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" referred to the film as \"perhaps the keenest crime film that ever came from France, including \"\"Pépé le Moko\"\" and some of the best of Louis Jouvet and Jean Gabin.\" The National Board of Review nominated the film as the Best Foreign Film in 1956.\n\n\"Rififi\" was re-released for a limited run within America on 21 July 2000 in a new 35 mm print containing new, more explicit subtitles that were enhanced in collaboration with Dassin. The film was received very well by American critics on its re-release. The film ranking website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 93% of critics had given the film positive reviews, based upon a sample of 41. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film has received an average score of 97, based on 13 reviews.\nKenneth Turan of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote the film was the \"benchmark all succeeding heist films have been measured against... It's a film whose influence is hard to overstate, one that proves for not the last time that it's easier to break into a safe than fathom the mysteries of the human heart.\" Lucia Bozzola of the online database Allmovie gave the film the highest possible rating of five stars, calling it \"The pinnacle of heist movies\" and \"not only one of the best French noirs, but one of the top movies in the genre.\" In 2002, critic Roger Ebert added the film to his list of \"Great Movies\" stating \"echoes of [\"Rififi\"] can be found from Kubrick's \"The Killing\" to Tarantino's \"Reservoir Dogs\". They both owe something to John Huston's \"The Asphalt Jungle\" (1950), which has the general idea but not the attention to detail.\" Among negative reviews of the film, Dave Kehr of the \"Chicago Reader\" felt that \"the film turns moralistic and sour in the last half, when the thieves fall out.\" \"Rififi\" placed at number 90 on \"Empire\"'s list of The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema. Critic and director Jean-Luc Godard regarded the film negatively in comparison to other French crime films of the era, noting in 1986 that \"today it can't hold a candle to \"Touchez pas au grisbi\" which paved the way for it, let alone \"Bob le flambeur\" which it paved the way for.\"\n\n\"Rififi\" is the title of the sixth episode of the sixth season of the period drama television series \"The Americans\", in which a protagonist contrives a meeting at a screening of the film.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1981908", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1981908", "title": "SunTour", "text": "SunTour\n\nSunTour (Maeda) was the most important Japanese manufacturer of bicycle components based in Osaka until 1988, when Sakae Ringyo Company (abbreviated S.R.), a major Japanese maker of aluminum parts, particularly cranks and seat posts, bought what was left of the bankrupt SunTour, and the combined companies are now known as SR-SunTour. SunTour reached a zenith of sales and commercial success from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s. Its products range from suspension forks to derailleurs.\n\nBegun in 1912 as \"Maeda Iron Works Company\" manufacturing freewheels and sprockets, the company concentrated on producing bicycle gearing components.\n\nIn the 1950s, the company began producing its version of pull-chain, rod-guided, touring derailleurs, similar to those of French derailleur companies such as Huret and Simplex.\n\nIn 1964, Suntour invented the slant-parallelogram rear derailleur. The parallelogram rear derailleur had gained prominence after Campagnolo's introduction of the \"Gran Sport\" in 1949, and the slant-parallelogram was an improvement of it that allowed the derailleur to maintain a more constant distance from the sprockets, resulting in easier shifting. The SunTour derailleur cost less than Campagnolo, Huret, Shimano, or Simplex and it performed especially well shifting under load, as when changing to a lower gear while pedaling up a steep incline. A contemporary \"Consumer Reports\" test reported that \"SunTour was far and away the easiest to shift and the most certain of arriving at the right sprocket.\"\n\nSuntour's slant-parallelogram, spring-loaded top pivot rear derailleur provided the best shifting on the market. When Suntour's rear derailleur patent expired, the design was promptly copied by Shimano.\n\nIn 1969, SunTour was the first Japanese gear and shifter manufacturer to introduce indexed shifting on bicycles (indexed shifting appeared at least as early as the Funiculo derailleur fitted to 1935 Schulz bicycles). Although their system, called \"Five-Speed Click\", worked well, it proved an idea ahead of its time and did not catch on with the riding public. Another design innovation was the first practical Japanese freehub — the \"Unit-Hub\" - which combined freewheel and hub in one component (unit hubs were available at least as early as the 1938 Bayliss-Wiley, probably earlier). The freehub greatly increased the strength of the rear wheel, but the idea was not pursued.\n\nIn the early 1970s, demand created by the bike boom in the United States exceeded the capacity of European manufacturers. SunTour and Shimano filled the vacuum. SunTour focused on refining existing systems and designs for mid-level and high-end products. Like Shimano, SunTour initially did not sell complete group-sets, so it teamed with other parts makers, such as Sugino for cranksets and Dia-Compe for brakes, so it could sell a complete line of SunTour branded components. Under these types of production agreements, companies did not have design control; if a cooperating component manufacturer decided not to upgrade or redesign its products, SunTour could do little about it. Shimano decided to greatly expand its research and development staff to 200 employees, enabling the company to end its component marketing agreements in order to produce hubs, pedals, brakes, and other components on its own in competition with its former partners. In comparison, SunTour chose to continue with its existing research and development staff of some 20 persons, and remained primarily a bicycle gear and shifter manufacturer.\n\nUnlike other bicycle component manufacturers, Suntour did not charge what the market would bear, but instead charged a price that covered costs of production plus a small profit markup. As a result, a Suntour derailleur costing $10 competed against similar level products from Campagnolo ($40) and Shimano ($20). As Suntour derailleurs and shifters could be specified on many more low- and mid-priced bicycles, the company gained a reputation with the general public as a producer of only low-end equipment. This reputation would eventually hurt sales when Suntour introduced a complete high-end component group, \"Superbe Pro\".\n\nDespite emerging problems, Suntour continued to achieve a number of innovations, particularly in components for mountain bikes. In partnership with Sugino, it introduced the 110/74mm BCD five-bolt triple crankset for mountain bikes, which soon became an industry standard. Next was the introduction of the \"Micro Drive\" 94/56mm BCD five-bolt compact mountain bike crankset, which saved weight, increased ground clearance, and permitted lower gearing for hill-climbing. New, short-cage rear derailleurs were provided to go with the Micro Drive cassette-type cogsets. The new system was very popular, and Shimano adopted the compact drive concept two years later. SunTour's new thumb and trigger shifters made shifting more convenient when riding off-pavement.\n\nThe company's decision to limit funding and staff for research and development caused running issues with new products. The first sign of trouble came with returns on SunTour's SR \"MounTech\" rear derailleur, caused by failures of the innovative spring-loaded jockey wheel that was fitted with a seal that proved inadequate to keep out dirt and mud. In road bicycle components, the company fared no better. SunTour had introduced the \"SuperbeTech\" derailleur in 1983 with a streamlined, enclosed parallelogram. However, the design was too fragile, with internal pivots and the return spring failing frequently. It took special tools to repair and reassemble a \"SuperbeTech\" derailleur, resulting in many unhappy customers. SunTour no longer had the resources to debug prototype designs before introducing them to the market, which cost the company in returns, repairs, and damaged reputation.\n\nAnother blow came when the yen was revalued in 1985. SunTour could no longer compete on costs with a slew of manufacturers producing in Taiwan and other lower labor-cost countries. Existing orders had been written in foreign currencies, rather than yen, so SunTour suffered a major loss. It had to borrow additional cash to finance a transfer of manufacturing facilities to Taiwan, as well as begin development of new mountain bike components.\n\nIn 1987, SunTour introduced its new attempt at an indexed shifting system, \"AccuShift\". \"AccuShift\" came late to the market to compete with Shimano's new SIS system introduced two years before, which cost SunTour dearly. With two years of lead time, Shimano could afford to require that bicycle manufacturers equip their bikes with complete SIS shifting systems, minimizing problems with product compatibility. SunTour, on the other hand, desperately needed orders, so the company could not insist on complete SunTour component groups that had been tested to ensure compatibility with \"AccuShift\". As a consequence, major bicycle manufacturers such as Schwinn and Raleigh installed \"Accu-Shift\" on low-end bikes using inventories of older freewheels, hubs, cables, cable housings, and chains from other manufacturers. The practice resulted in a mismatched 'system' that did not provide the critical tolerances needed for reliable indexed shifting.\n\nIn 1987, a large Japanese engineering company called Mori Industries Inc. (with manufacturing plants in Taiwan) bought Sakae Ringyo Company.\n\nIn 1988 the SunTour name was purchased and revived by Sakae Ringyo Company, (now owned by Mori Industries Inc.) with a capital investment of 45,000,000 NT$ in Tokyo, Japan, thus becoming SR-SunTour. \nThe new SR-SunTour parts are not compatible with the original SunTour parts.\n\nBy 1993, SunTour's share of the market had dropped to five per cent of the U.S. market. At the end of 1994, Mori decided to shut down their bicycle component business. In March 1995 Daisuke Kobayashi and Hideo Hashizume, the former owners of SR Sakae Ringyo, arranged a management buyout. The new management took over in July, 1995, purchasing the SunTour name and the SR factory in Taiwan. Mori Industries left the bicycle component business, selling off SunTour's Japanese facilities piecemeal.\n\nSR SunTour USA closed its U.S. offices in early 1995. The SunTour name lived on as SR-SunTour, but the SunTour component designs did not survive. The tooling that produced the once-prized Suntour derailleurs, shifters, and associated bicycle components was sold for scrap.\n\n"}

He has also directed films about the impact of humans on the planet. He is especially well known for his book \"Earth from Above\" (1999) and his films \"Home\" (2009) and \"Human\" (2015). It is because of this commitment that Yann Arthus-Bertrand was designated Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Environment Programme on Earth Day (22 April 2009).\n\nYann Arthus-Bertrand was born in Paris on 13 March 1946 in a renowned jewellers' family founded in 1803 by Claude Arthus-Bertrand and Michel-Ange Marion. His sister Catherine is one of his closest collaborators. He has been interested in nature and wildlife from an early age.\n\nIn 1963 when he was 17, he became an assistant director, then an actor in movies. He played alongside famous actors such as Michèle Morgan in \"Dis-moi qui tuer\" (1965) by Etienne Perier and in \"OSS 117 prend des vacances\" (1970) by Pierre Kalfon.\n\nHe gave up the movie industry in 1967 to run the Château de Saint Augustin wildlife park in Château-sur-Allier (centre of France).\nHe then left the country with his wife Anne when he was 30 (1976) to live in Kenya in the Masai Mara National Reserve. He lived amongst the Maasai tribe for 3 years to study the behaviour of a lions' family and took daily pictures of them during those years. He thus discovered a new passion for photography and the beauty of landscapes when observed from above in hot air balloons and understood how to communicate using these means.\n\nHe came back to France in 1981, published a photographs book \"Lions\" in 1983, and became an international journalist, reporter and photographer specialised in documentaries on sports, wildlife and aerial photography for French magazines such as \"Paris Match\" and \"GEO\". He photographed ten Paris-Dakar rallies. Every year he published a book on Roland Garros, the tennis French open. He also took pictures every year at the Paris International Agricultural Show, and of ethologist Dian Fossey and gorillas in Rwanda.\n\nHe founded the Altitude Agency in 1991, which was the world's first press agency and images bank specialising in aerial photography (500,000 pictures taken in more than 100 countries by more than 100 photographers).\n\nIn 1994 Arthus-Bertrand started a thorough study on the state of the Earth sponsored by UNESCO. As part of the study, he made a picture inventory of the world's most beautiful landscapes, taken from helicopters and hot-air balloons. The book from this project, \"Earth from Above\" (\"La Terre vue du ciel\") sold over 3 million copies and was translated into 24 languages.\n\nIn 2000, his \"Earth from Above\" free exhibition was set up on numerous big posters on the gates of the Jardins du Luxembourg in Paris. It then travelled worldwide from Lyon to Montreal, to 110 cities and was visited by 120 million people.\n\nIn 2008, Earth from Above was released on DVD.\n\nOn 1 July 2005, he founded the international environmental organisation GoodPlanet, and set up the programme Action Carbone to offset his own greenhouse gas emissions generated by his helicopter transports. Since then this program has evolved to help people and companies to reduce and offset their climate impact by funding projects on renewable energies, energy efficiency and reforestation.\n\nSince then, the organisation has been involved in several projects:\n\nArthus-Bertrand was made a Knight of the Légion d'honneur (national order of the legion of honour) and a Knight of the Ordre du Mérite Agricole (national order of agricultural merit). He was also made Officer of the Ordre National du Mérite (national order of merit) by President Nicolas Sarkozy in June 2008. Moreover, he was elected alongside Lucien Clergue at the Académie des Beaux Arts (academy of fine arts).\n\nIn 2006, he launched a series of documentaries called \"Vu du ciel\" (\"Seen from Above\") for the French public channels. The 5th episode was aired in December 2007 and was about agriculture.\n\nAlso in 2006 he published \"Algeria From Above\" which he considers as one of his best works so far. This book offers a brand new view on this country.\n\nIn April 2007 he started directing a film originally called \"Boomerang\", later re-titled \"Home\". The film was produced by Luc Besson and financed by the PPR group (a French multinational company). It was Arthus-Bertrand's intention to show the state of our planet and the challenges humanity faces. The emissions of greenhouse gases produced by the movie's shooting were offset through Arthus-Bertrand's organisation GoodPlanet and its 'Action Carbone' program. The film was released internationally on 5 June 2009. On the night of its release many theatres offered screening for free and an open-air screening at the Champ-de-Mars in Paris drew 20 000 spectators. The aerial photography, music score and high post-production values were intended to create a more emotional response than most previous films about the subject. The simultaneous TV broadcast of the film on the France 2 TV channel drew more than 8 million people. The following Sunday, at the European elections, the environmentalist coalition Europe Écologie made an unexpectedly strong showing. On the night of the elections, many political commentators expressed concerns that the film screening may have influenced the result.\n\n\"Home\" is available on DVD and via free streaming on the internet (Arthus-Bertrand gave up his author's rights).\n\nOn 19 March 2008, he was given the Georges Pompidou Award which rewards a cultural personality each year (2006: painter Pierre Soulages, 2005: orchestra conductor William Christie).\n\nSince 2008, he has participated in the Board of Directors of the Fondation Chirac, a foundation launched in 2008 by former French President Jacques Chirac in order to promote world peace through five advocacy programmes, two of which deal with environmental issues such as access to fresh water, desertification and deforestation.\n\nA few schools have been named after Yann Arthus-Bertrand (primary schools of Cysoing, Noviant-aux-Prés, Carentoir and Villaines-sous-Bois, nursery schools of Cairanne and Saint-Aignan-de-Cramesnil as well as the Radinghem high school specialised in agriculture). He stated that it was one of the greatest honours he could receive.\n\nIn 2008, he launched the project called 6 billion others. It is a video exhibition of people across the world answering the same questions.\n\nOn 22 April 2009 he was officially designated as the United Nations Environment Program Goodwill Ambassador (UNEP) and received the \"Earth Champion\" award for his commitment towards the environment and his work on public environmental awareness.\n\nArthus-Bertrand also supports the Zeitz Foundation, an organization focused on sustainable development and conservation.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was first identified in 1965 after isolation from the blood of two patients from Chandipura village in Maharashtra state, India and has been associated with a number of otherwise unexplained outbreaks of encephalitic illness in central India. The most recent occurred in Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra in June–August 2003 with 329 children affected and 183 deaths.\nFurther sporadic cases and deaths in children were observed in Gujarat state in 2004.\n\n\"Chandipura vesiculovirus\" has been isolated from sandflies in India and West Africa and is probably spread through its bite. The presence of the virus in Africa indicates a wide distribution although no human cases have been observed outside India.\n\nThe significance of \"Chandipura vesiculovirus\" as a human pathogen is unresolved due to doubts over its role in the 2003 and 2004 outbreaks.\n\n\"Chandipura vesiculovirus\" is an enveloped RNA virus with an approximate genome length of ~11 kb. Viral genome codes for five polypeptides, namely, Nucleocapsid protein N, Phosphoprotein P, Matrix protein M, Glycoprotein G and Large protein L in five monocistronic mRNAs. N protein encapsidates genome RNA into a nuclease-resistant form to protect in from cellular RNAse function. L and P protein together forms viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase; where catalytic functions for RNA polymerization, Capping and Poly-A polymerase resides within the L protein and P acts as a transcriptional activator. Matrix protein glues the encapsidated genome RNA, also known as nucleocapsid, with the outer membrane envelop. G protein spikes out of the membrane and acts as a major antigenic determinant.\n\nViral life cycle is cytosolic. During transcription, viral polymerase synthesizes five discrete mRNAs and obeys to stop signals that are present at the gene boundaries. Accumulation of adequate amounts of viral proteins within infected cells through viral transcription and subsequent translation potentiate the onset of viral replicative cycle. In this phase, same L protein acts as a replicase and ignore the gene junctions to generate a polycistronic anti-genomic analogue that acts as a template for further rounds of replication to generate many more copies of the genome RNA. This progeny genome RNA upon packaging by viral proteins bud out as mature virus particles. The precise mechanism underlying the switch in polymerase function during viral replication remains unknown.\n\nIn 2003, 329 people died in outbreak in Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra.

The topology of a formula_1 bundle is classified by its Chern class, which is an element of formula_4, the second integral cohomology of formula_2.\n\nGerbes, or more precisely 1-gerbes, are abstract descriptions of Deligne 2-classes, which each define an element of formula_6, the third integral cohomology of \"M\".\n\nHistorically the most popular construction of a gerbe is a category-theoretic model featured in Giraud's theory of gerbes, which are roughly sheaves of groupoids over \"M\".\n\nIn 1994 Murray introduced bundle gerbes, which are geometric realizations of 1-gerbes.\nFor many purposes these are more suitable for calculations than Giraud's realization, because their construction is entirely within the framework of classical geometry. In fact, as their name suggests, they are fiber bundles. This notion was extended to higher gerbes the following year.\n\nIn Twisted K-theory and the K-theory of Bundle Gerbes the authors defined modules of bundle gerbes and used this to define a K-theory for bundle gerbes. They then showed that this K-theory is isomorphic to Rosenberg's twisted K-theory, and provides an analysis-free construction.\n\nIn addition they defined a notion of twisted Chern character which is a characteristic class for an element of twisted K-theory. The twisted Chern character is a differential form that represents a class in the twisted cohomology with respect to the nilpotent operator\n\nwhere formula_8 is the ordinary exterior derivative and the \"twist\" formula_9 is a closed 3-form. This construction was extended to equivariant K-theory and to holomorphic K-theory by Mathai and Stevenson.\n\nBundle gerbes have also appeared in the context of conformal field theories. Gawedzki and Reis have interpreted the Wess–Zumino term in the Wess–Zumino–Witten model (WZW) of string propagation on a group manifold as the connection of a bundle gerbe. Urs Schreiber, Christoph Schweigert and Konrad Waldorf have used this construction to extend WZW models to unoriented surfaces and, more generally, the global Kalb–Ramond coupling to unoriented strings.\n\nMore details can be found at the n-Category Café:\n\n\n"}

They are paired sacs on either side of the anus between the external and internal sphincter muscles. Sebaceous glands within the lining secrete a liquid that is used for identification of members within a species. These sacs are found in many carnivorans, including wolves, bears, sea otters and kinkajous.\n\nThe anal glands are in the wall of the anal canal. They secrete into the anal canal via anal ducts which open into the anal crypts along the level of the dentate line. The glands are at varying depths in the anal canal wall, some between the layers of the internal and external sphincter (the intersphincteric plane). The cryptoglandular theory states that obstruction of these ducts, presumably by accumulation of foreign material (e.g. fecal bacterial plugging) in the crypts, may lead to perianal abscess and fistula formation.\n\nDogs and cats primarily use their anal gland secretions to mark their territory, and generally will secrete small amounts of fluid every time they defecate. Many will often express these glands when anxious or frightened as well. Anal sac fluid varies from yellow to tan or brown in color. The consistency of the fluid ranges from thin, watery secretions to thick, gritty paste. \n\nThe inability to effectively express this fluid can lead to anal sacculitis. This is characterized by a build-up of fluid in the anal sac, an uncomfortable condition that can lead to pain and itching. Dogs and cats of any age may be affected, but dogs are far more likely to suffer from anal sacculitis than cats. Dogs and cats with anal glands that do not express naturally may exhibit specific signs, such as scooting the backside upon the ground, straining to defecate, and excessive licking of the anus. Cats may also defecate in areas outside the litter box. \n\nDiscomfort may also be evident with impaction or infection of the anal glands. Anal sac impaction results from blockage of the duct leading from the gland to the opening. The sac is usually non-painful and swollen. Anal sac infection results in pain, swelling, and sometimes abscessation and fever. \n\nInitial treatment usually involves the manual expression of the anal sacs, most often by a veterinary professional. The frequency of this procedure depends on the patient's individual degree of discomfort but can range from weekly to every few months. Treatment may include lancing of an abscess or antibiotic infusion into the gland in the case of infection. The most common bacterial isolates from anal gland infection are \"E. coli\", \"Enterococcus faecalis\", \"Clostridium perfringens\", and \"Proteus\" species. Increasing dietary fiber is also commonly recommended.\n\nAnal sacs may be removed surgically in a procedure known as anal sacculectomy. This is usually done in the case of recurrent infection or because of the presence of an anal sac adenocarcinoma, a malignant tumor. Potential complications include fecal incontinence (especially when both glands are removed), tenesmus from stricture or scar formation, and persistent draining fistulae.\n\nOpossums use their anal glands when they \"play possum\". As the opossum mimics death, the glands secrete a foul-smelling liquid, suggesting the opossum is rotting. Note that opossums are not members of the carnivora, and that their anal sacs differ from those of dogs and their relatives.\n\nSkunks use their anal glands to spray a foul-smelling and sticky fluid as a defense against predators.\n\nAn extraction of castoreum, the scent glands from the male and female beaver are used in perfumery and as a flavor ingredient.\n\n\n"}

He is best known as the creator of the television sitcom \"Arrested Development\" as well as the co-creator of \"The Ellen Show\", and a contributor to \"The John Larroquette Show\" and \"The Golden Girls\".\n\nHurwitz was born in 1963 to a Jewish family in Anaheim, California. In 1976, when Hurwitz was 12, he co-founded a chocolate-chip cookie business, called the Chipyard on Balboa Boulevard in Balboa Fun Zone in Newport Beach, California, in a former taco place, with his older brother, Michael, and his father, Mark. The Chipyard is still in operation in Boston. He graduated from Estancia High School in Costa Mesa, CA, and from Georgetown University in 1985 with a double major in English and Theology.\n\nHurwitz worked on several sitcoms in the 1980s and 1990s, including \"Nurses\", \"The Golden Girls\", \"The Golden Palace\", \"The John Larroquette Show\", \"The Ellen Show\" and the Michael J. Fox-produced pilot \"Hench at Home\". He also created \"Everything's Relative\", a midseason comedy starring Jeffrey Tambor and Jill Clayburgh for NBC in 1999.\n\nHurwitz was chosen by Ron Howard to create a sitcom about a rich dysfunctional family, which eventually turned into \"Arrested Development\". Hurwitz wrote the pilot in 2002, which was filmed in March 2003. Fox added the show to its schedule in May. Although the show premiered to stunning reviews from television critics around the country, the show was plagued by low ratings throughout its three-season run. In July 2004, the show was nominated for 7 Primetime Emmy Awards and won 5, including Outstanding Comedy Series, Outstanding Directing in a Comedy Series and Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series.\n\nIn the second season, ratings decreased further and the show was cut down to 18 episodes instead of the planned 22 episodes. Nevertheless, the show was still critically acclaimed and was nominated for 11 Emmy Awards.\n\nIn the show's third and final season on Fox, Hurwitz tried to keep \"Arrested Development\" on the air, but did not have the advertising funding to promote the series. The show was again cut down, from 18 episodes to 13. Fox announced the cancellation of the show before the production of the final five episodes.\n\nAfter seven years off the air, \"Arrested Development\" returned for a fifteen-episode fourth season on the online movie and television streaming service Netflix on May 26, 2013. \n\nAfter yet another multi-year hiatus in which there was uncertainty of future seasons being developed, Netflix and the show's producers announced the development of a fifth season. The release was heralded by a re-edited twenty-two-episode version of the fourth season titled Season Four Remix: Fateful Consequences, released on Netflix on May 4, 2018. The fifth season consists of sixteen episodes, 8 of which were released simultaneously on May 29, 2018. The remaining 8 episodes were released simultaneously on March 15, 2019.\n\nHurwitz created Fox's animated comedy \"Sit Down, Shut Up\", based on an Australian TV series of the same name, for the 2008 season.\n\nHurwitz created \"Running Wilde\", which aired for one season from 2010 to 2011. It was a collaboration with \"Arrested Development\" star Will Arnett.\n\nHurwitz signed a multiyear deal with Netflix in 2014. He is executive producing \"Flaked\" starring Will Arnett and produced/co-created \"Lady Dynamite\" starring Maria Bamford for the network.\n\nAmong Hurwitz's projects have been the US television adaptations of the British comedy shows \"The Thick of It\" (which was not picked up in the running for ABC's 2007–2008 TV season, though other networks such as HBO, Showtime and NBC have expressed interest) and \"Absolutely Fabulous\".\n\n\"My World And Welcome To It\" was a 2009 CBS television pilot, executive produced by Hurwitz, Jay Kogen, Kim Tannenbaum, and Barry Sonnenfeld. It was a comedy based on an earlier series \"My World and Welcome to It\" about being a dad in the 1960s which, in turn, drew material from James Thurber's collection of essays of the same name. \"Happiness Isn't Everything\" was also a 2009 CBS pilot, written by Hurwitz and Jim Vallely, starring Richard Dreyfuss, Jason Biggs, Ben Schwartz and Mary Steenburgen.\n\nHurwitz co-starred as \"Cool Eric\" in an episode of \"Workaholics\" titled \"Dry Guys.\" In this role, Hurwitz plays the clan's HR representative and is aiding them in their pursuit to become sober.\n\nHurwitz starred as \"Koogler\" in the \"Community\" episode \"App Development and Condiments\" (episode 8, season 5), which aired on March 6, 2014.

{"id": "1981922", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1981922", "title": "Phodopus", "text": "Phodopus\n\nPhodopus, a genus of rodents in the hamster subfamily Cricetinae—a division of the larger family Cricetidae—is a lineage of small hamsters native to central Asia that display unusual adaptations to extreme temperatures. They are the only known hamsters that live in groups and, in some cases, rely on significant contributions by males to the raising of offspring. They are nocturnal and active throughout the year; they do not hibernate. Species of \"Phodopus\", together with members of the genera \"Cricetulus\", \"Allocricetulus\" and \"Tscherskia\" are called dwarf hamsters because of their small size (roughly ) relative to other hamsters.\n\nLike other hamsters, members of \"Phodopus\" have a round body shape, short tails and cheek pouches in which they can store food. They all live in dry conditions with extreme temperatures. They inhabit the forests, steppes and semi-deserts of Mongolia, Siberia, China and Kazakhstan. Fossils of \"Phodopus\" have been found in Pleistocene and Pliocene deposits in Europe and Asia.\n\n\"Phodopus\" species are commonly sold as small pets. They are also used as laboratory organisms for a variety of studies, especially involving seasonal endocrine variation. Some species are considered to be agricultural pests.\n\nAll three species are widespread and probably abundant, and are assessed as Least Concern (LC) by the IUCN Red List, unlike their larger cousin, the golden hamster, which is also kept as a pet and is listed as Vulnerable (VU). However, their ecology and population dynamics are not well understood. Historical records indicate they were once common in places where they no longer occur. Consequently, they are listed in the Kazakhstan Government Regulation of Approval of Rare and Endangered Animal and Plant Species Index (2006).\n\n\"Phodopus\" is one of seven genera within the subfamily Cricetinae, a group of rodents distributed throughout Eurasia. It contains hamsters distinguished from other hamsters by small size, short tails and fur covered feet. Fossils assignable to the genus occur in the Pleistocene in Europe and in the Late Pliocene of Kazakhstan, despite the fact that molecular data suggest the lineage is no younger than 8.5 million years.\n\nG.S. Miller first described the genus \"Phodopus\" in 1910, designating \"Cricetulus bedfordiae\" as its type species. (\"C. bedfordiae\" is the species now called \"P. roborovskii\".) The genus name derives from ancient Greek \"phodos\" (φωδος, genitive of \"phos\" φως \"blister\") and \"pous\" (πους \"foot\") and refers to the large pad on the sole of each foot.\n\nMorphology has proved inadequate in providing characters for phylogenetic analyses of the subfamily Cricetinae, but the group appears to be monophyletic based on molecular analyses. The genus \"Phodopus\" is one of three well-supported lineages in Cricetinae, the other two being the genus \"Mesocricetus\" and the Cricetus-related group (\"Cricetus\", \"Tscherskia\", \"Allocricetulus\", and \"Cricetulus\"). Analysis of chromosomes supports these three lineages. \"Phodopus\" is sister to all other Cricetinae (meaning that it is the first lineage to diverge in the clade). Using several molecular dating techniques, researchers have determined that the \"Phodopus\" lineage may have originated 8.5 to 12.2 million years ago (mya). Other genetic dating analyses suggest a somewhat earlier origination of 13.5–14.1 mya. Fossils assignable to the genus are unknown before about 2.5 million years ago, but failure to identify the remains accurately may contribute to the apparent lack of older fossils.\n\nAs shown in the cladogram, \"Phodopus roborovskii\" is sister to \"Phodopus campbelli\" + \"Phodopus sungorus\". The validity of \"P. campbelli\" as a species has been controversial. Some biologists consider it to be a subspecies of \"P. sungorus\". Neumann et al. determined that, at least for cytochrome b, \"P. campbelli\" and \"P. sungorus\" do not display the level of genetic divergence characteristic of sister rodent species. Both taxa have 2n=28 chromosomes. However, evidence from hybridization with \"P. sungorus\" has suggested to some researchers that they are in fact separate species.\n\n\"P. roborovskii\", on the other hand, has levels of genetic divergence from the other two taxa in the genus characteristic of genera among small mammals. \"P. roborovskii\" is also distinct from the other species morphologically (in its smaller body size and pelage, for example) and ecologically (preferring sandy, arid habitats). \"P. roborovskii\" has 2n=34 chromosomes. For these reasons, Neumann et al. suggest removing \"P. sungorus\" and \"P. campbelli\" to the genus \"Cricetiscus\".\n\nBiologists currently recognize three species of \"Phodopus\": \"P. campbelli\", \"P. sungorus\" and \"P. roborovskii\". The validity of \"P. Campbelli\" is in dispute, and it has sometimes been considered a subspecies of \"P. sungorus\".\n\nThe species of \"Phodopus\" do not have stable common names, even among biologists. \"Djungarian\" (or \"Dzhungarian\" or \"Zungarian\") and \"Siberian\" have been applied to both \"P. sungorus\" and \"P. campbelli\" in the scientific literature, and all three species have been called \"desert\" hamsters as well.\n\n\"P. sungorus\" is known as:\n\n\"P. campbelli\" is known as:\n\n\"P. roborovskii\" is known as:\n\nBelow is a key to the four species of dwarf hamster commonly kept as pets. Some dwarf hamsters are albino, in which case they will be primarily white and the fur colour characteristics will not serve to distinguish them. The characteristics in brackets will allow identification using characters other than pelage, but the traits are generally comparative and are more difficult to assess. The key is based on Ross 1998.\n\n\"Phodopus campbelli\": The lips and cheeks have white fur, and the region around the ears is grey. A dark dorsal stripe runs from the base of the neck to the base of the tail. The fur on the throat, abdomen and legs is white, and the fur on top of the paws is silvery white. When the cheek pouches are full, they extend back to the shoulders. The average body mass is .\n\n\"Phodopus sungorus\": In the summer, the face is brown, which is slightly lighter than the fur around the mouth and ears. The rest of the head is dark brown with a black rim around each eye. A dark brown dorsal stripe runs from the back of the head to the base of the tail. The feet, tail, throat and abdomen are white, and the back is ash grey to dark brown.\n\n\"Phodopus roborovskii\" is the smallest species of \"Phodopus\" and of hamsters in general. The feet are unusually short, broad and densely hairy. The fur on the abdomen is grey, and the coat colour turns grey during moulting.\n\n\"Phodopus\" species display a variety of morphological, physiological and behavioral adaptations to seasonal temperature extremes and aridity. To survive the exceptional cold of winter, they have evolved spherical, compact bodies with excellent insulation, including both fur and fat. Water is scarce in both summer and winter, and these hamsters have developed an excellent ability to conserve water by maintaining low evaporative water loss rates and concentrating urine.\n\nDuring periods of extreme cold (below -20 °C), \"P. sungorus\" adopts a characteristic hunched posture, with its head and forepaws tucked under its belly. It fluffs its fur evenly, increasing its insulating quality. During periods of high heat (greater than 30 °C), this species flattens itself on its belly, with all four limbs splayed to the side. It grooms its fur into clumps, creating \"ventilation gaps\" between them.\n\nSociality has been considered an adaptation to the extreme environment, as well.\n\nIn the wild, \"Phodopus\" primarily collect and eat seeds and dry fruits. They also eat other plant parts and insects.\n\n\"Phodopus\" species inhabit the mountainous forests, steppes, and semideserts of Mongolia and the adjacent areas of China, northeast Kazakhstan, and the southern part of the West Siberian lowlands of Tuva and Dauria. All three species are widespread, although some isolated local populations exist. All three species are probably abundant and are assessed as Least Concern (LC) in the IUCN Red List. They all occur to some extent in protected areas, at least in Mongolia, and are not thought to face significant threats to their existence. Because the status and dynamics of their populations are uncertain, some species are treated as species of concern (for example, the government of Kazakhstan requires monitoring of \"P roborovskii\")\n\nSome species are clearly diminished in range and may have been extirpated as agricultural pests or by habitat destruction.\n\nSince some populations and species of \"Phodopus\", such as \"P. campbelli\", inhabit areas with sparse human population and little potential for agriculture, they have little interaction with humans. Others, such as \"P. sungorus\", have been perceived as significant agricultural pests.\n\nDwarf hamsters were introduced into the pet trade in the mid-1990s. They are considered excellent pets, especially for novice pet owners, because they are easy to maintain (requiring no special diet or conditions) and are generally not aggressive to people and tolerate living with other members of their species. \n\"Phodopus\" species have developed into important laboratory organisms. They provide an excellent model system for the evolution of hormonal control of photoperiod and seasonal physiological and behavioral changes, sociality, biparental offspring care, and behavioral ecology. Because \"Phodopus\" species have small chromosome numbers with easily distinguished chromosomes, they have been used for cytogenetic and cancer research. Because of their extreme cold tolerance, they have been used to study thermoregulation. One population of laboratory animals developed both glycosuria and ketonuria independently and has been used as a model for diabetes mellitus.\n\nThe first laboratory use of \"Phodopus\" stemmed from a breeding colony established in Leningrad at the Zoological Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union. The animals became the seed stock from which other European lab colonies were started. The animals were said to have been trapped in Tuva and Siberia and were labeled as \"P. sungorus campbelli\". Both \"P. sungorus\" and \"P. campbelli\" are popular research animals, especially as they differ enough in behavior and physiology to support fruitful comparison studies. More recently, \"P. roborovskii\" became an important research animal, as well.\n\n"}

A right-hander, he played all or part of twelve seasons in Major League Baseball, exclusively as a relief pitcher. He is best known for his years with the Atlanta Braves from 1991 to 1999. He is the third fastest recorded pitcher in baseball history, having thrown a pitch recorded at 103 miles per hour during a spring training session in 1995; the record was broken by Detroit Tigers pitcher Joel Zumaya with a pitch.\n\nWohlers grew up \"dirt poor\" in Holyoke, Massachusetts. His parents divorced when he was nine years old and he was raised primarily by his mother, Irene. He began working at fourteen years old, washing dishes in a restaurant until midnight. Wohlers committed to play college baseball for the Maine Black Bears before graduating from Holyoke High School in 1988.\n\nWohlers was selected in the eighth round of the 1988 amateur draft by the Braves. He went on to make his major league debut with the Braves on August 17, 1991. Less than a month later, on September 11, Wohlers teamed with fellow Braves hurlers Kent Mercker and Alejandro Peña for a combined no-hitter against the San Diego Padres; Wohlers pitched two innings in relief of Mercker.\n\nAfter spending the following three seasons as a setup pitcher, Wohlers was given the job as a closer in 1995. He went on to record 97 saves over the next three seasons, also saving the 1–0 victory in the clinching Game 6 of the 1995 World Series, establishing himself as one of the best closers in the majors.\n\nWohlers' success would not last forever. In Game 4 of the 1996 World Series against the New York Yankees, Wohlers gave up a stunning 3-run home run to Jim Leyritz that tied the game at 6. After this, the momentum of the Series shifted and the Yankees won it in six games. Many observe that Wohlers was never the same after that. In 1998, he seemed to lose all ability to control his pitches. He spent part of the season at Triple-A Richmond, but still finished the season with a major league earned run average of 10.18. His control problems were dramatic. In 20⅓ major league innings, Wohlers walked 33 batters. After being sent down to Triple-A, Wohlers walked 36 batters in only 12⅓ innings. His symptoms were a prime example of what is commonly known as Steve Blass disease – a psychological block which manifests itself when baseball players overthink the act of throwing a baseball and consequently become unable to throw with any sort of control. The Associated Press called him \"the 1990s poster child for Steve Blass Syndrome.\"\n\nHe began the following season in a similar fashion: in two outings he recorded an ERA of 27.00 in ⅔ of an inning, with 6 walks. The Atlanta faithful, although frustrated with Wohlers' seemingly constant fastballs to the backstop or behind batters, rallied behind the embattled pitcher and would fervently cheer him on whenever he was in the game. After being recalled from Richmond, he entered a game and recorded a strikeout, his first in months, and received a rousing standing ovation from the crowd at Turner Field.\n\nOn April 16, 1999, the Braves traded Wohlers to the Cincinnati Reds in return for John Hudek. The day after signing for the Reds he was put on the disabled list with an anxiety disorder. While undergoing treatment for his anxiety, Wohlers had Tommy John surgery on his elbow, which ended his season. Wohlers returned to baseball for the 2000 season in his old role as a setup man. He split the following season between the Reds and the Yankees before being traded to the Cleveland Indians prior to the 2002 season.\n\nIn his first season with the Indians, Wohlers recorded an ERA of 4.79, with seven saves, three wins, four losses, and a much improved walk ratio. After experiencing pain in his right elbow in spring training before the 2003 season, Wohlers had an operation to remove several bone chips, ruling him out for the first two months of the season. Unfortunately, his season ended in the second game of his rehabilitation assignment at Double-A Akron when he ruptured the tendon graft he had had in his elbow in 1999. He had Tommy John surgery for the second time in August of that year, which should have allowed him to return for the 2004 season. However, Wohlers decided not to return due to personal reasons and was released by the Indians. He did not return to baseball, although he never formally announced his retirement. His career record is 39–29 with an ERA of 3.97 and 119 saves.\n\nWohlers' first wife, Nancy, filed for divorce in Fulton County Superior Court in July 1998. Their daughter, Austyn, was born in 1996.\n\nIn the early morning of March 1, 2011, Wohlers' home in Milton, Georgia, caught fire, burnt down in under an hour, and was considered a \"total loss\" by the local fire department. However, some of Wohlers' sports memorabilia was recovered from his basement. He has credited his wife, Kimberly, with getting him, his two sons, and youngest daughter out of the house in time. His eldest daughter was not present at the time of the fire.\nWohlers and his wife currently run an Atlanta real estate business called Team Wohlers, at Solid Source Realty.\n\nWohlers was one of three Atlanta Braves to appear on \"Saturday Night Live\" when he made a cameo appearance alongside teammates Gerald Williams and Pedro Borbón, Jr. on the December 13, 1997, episode hosted by Helen Hunt.\n\n"}

It is shielded on the northeastern side by the Alburni Mountains and on the West looks at the plain of the Sele River and the Tyrrhenian Sea. The panorama includes the island of Capri, the mountains of the Amalfi Coast and the Gulf of Salerno in its northern part. The river Calore Salernitano touches much of its western boundaries.\n\nThe territory of Altavilla was populated since the 7th century BCE as demonstrated by archaeological finds on the territory, in the locality of San Lorenzo. In the nearby rural territory of Altavilla Silentina, by the Sele River, it is thought to have taken place the final battle where Spartacus and 60,000 fellow slaves who rebelled against the Roman Republic were definitely defeated by the Roman general Pompey in 71 BCE. A district of a nearby town is today called Pompeo.\n\nThe history of the modern Altavilla began around the year 1080 when the Normans with Robert Guiscard erected the Norman Castle that dominates the town and the Church of St. Giles. The town was built on triangular shape fortified with walls and three main gates: St. Blaise's Gate, Susa's Gate, Carina's Gate. The current name, Altavilla, derives from that of Guiscard's family, the Hauteville.\n\nIn 1246, having sided with the town of Capaccio and other local barons against the emperor Frederick II, Altavilla was completely razed to the ground. The breach was opened in a section of the old town that still today bears the nickname of \"muro rutto\" (\"broken wall\"). The city was newly built because of its strategic position dominating the plain of Sele River and was designed in a quadrangular shape, with the addition of a New Gate called \"Portanova\" (New Door).\n\nDuring the 15th century the Franciscans arrived in Altavilla and built a two-storey convent with a center cloister, and around it they built a Church dedicated to St. Francis of Assisi, a refectory, a library and a parlor. The Franciscan remained in Altavilla until 1860, when with the Unification of Italy, many religious convent were confiscated.\n\nOn September 9, 1862, with a resolution of the town hall, Altavilla took the second name of 'Silentina' because located between the rivers Sele and Alento, in order to be recognized among the 5 other towns that in Italy bear the first name of Altavilla.\n\nIn World War II, it was the seat of clashes between the German occupation forces and Allied troops.\n\nThe oldest church is the Church of Saint Giles, founded by the Normans. It is situated on the high part of the middle ages section of the town.

When the colony achieved independence from New South Wales in 1851 La Trobe was made the first Lieutenant-Governor of Victoria and, although land had been reserved in Kings Domain as the site for a future Government House, he remained living with his family in this cottage at Jolimont until his departure for England in 1854.\n\nThe cottage is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register for its \"historical, social and architectural significance\". It is one of the few surviving examples still standing of prefabricated houses from this period of history and gives an insight into early colonial domestic architecture and living arrangements. Personal effects of La Trobe and his family are still contained in the cottage. The dining room added by La Trobe is believed to be the oldest surviving structure built in Melbourne. The architectural style is described as \"Pre-separation colonial Georgian\".\n\nJohn Sharp, in a letter to the editor of \"The Argus\" of May 1888, refers to 'Governor La Trobe's cottage residence in Jolimont' which had been removed 'several years ago'. Sharp said he had two photographs of the building, one of which he sent to the \"Australasian Sketcher with Pen and Pencil\" 'in the hope that some day it may be useful'. In June of that year, the \"Australasian Sketcher with Pen and Pencil\" published an illustration based on Sharp's photograph and noted that he was a former owner of the cottage which 'still stands'. They published another illustration based on a photograph provided by its then owner H. W. Patton and repeated Sharps' contention that the cottage had also been the home of Charles Perry, the first Anglican bishop of Melbourne, and Hugh Childers, a Chancellor of the Exchequer in the United Kingdom. In November of that year the Australian Sketcher wrote that 'Governor Latrobe's cottage' was owned by 'Messers. Alfred Fenton and Sons' while 'the quaint old place which Bishop Perry occupied... was some time ago pulled down to make room for the residence of Mr. Sharp'. This different cottage 'at the corner of Wellington-parade and Jolimont-terrace' had also been the home of Childers.\n\nIn 1914, the cottage was the property of Messers. Bedggood and Company, who had their boot manufacturing company on an adjoining Jolimont block. It was proposed that the cottage, which was in an 'advanced state of decay', be demolished to extend the Bedggood premises. Daniel Bedggood agreed to a proposal by the 'Early Pioneers Association', who were 'interested in the old edifice as a relic of Australian history', that the intended demolition be delayed 'for a few days' so that 'leading citizens', including the Mayor, Premier William Watt and State Governor Sir Arthur Stanley, could visit the site. During the visit there were a number of speakers about the cottage and its history and the Governor was reported as saying that 'Old landmarks disappeared with the advance of a progressive city' but he hoped 'some kind of mural record should be placed' on the boot factory extension. Daniel Bedggood, 'promised the Government whatever portion of the building that was desired as a relic' and 'stated his intention of erecting a building in his own garden with the remaining material'. A later news report from 1942 stated that the Bedggood family extended the factory but 'the main section of the cottage was preserved in its original state' while 'in more recent times, as a centenary gesture' the company 'had a garden of early 19th century design planted around the cottage' and they 'opened it for public inspection'.\n\nPencil sketches of the cottage and its grounds from the era when the La Trobe family were in residence were donated by Charles La Trobe's grandchildren to the state of Victoria in 1924. The sketches were the work of Edward Bateman, Charles La Trobe's cousin. Later that year The Argus newspaper reproduced one of Bateman's sketches adding that 'until recently the remains' of the cottage 'were still standing at the rear of the factory of Bedggood and Co. Pty. Ltd., in Agnes Street'. Two watercolours 'dated 1842 or 1844' depictions of the cottage were also donated by another La Trobe grandchild in 1934.\n\nThunderstorms were reported to have damaged the cottage in 1935 which was 'already weakened by senile decay in its ninety-fifth year'. Rain had 'severely damaged the ceiling of the old banqueting hall' and two sheets of iron were blown off the roof. Contractors had concerns 'another heavy storm might sent the tall brick chimney crashing down'. H.L. Bedggood of owners Bedggood and Co. said that 'the damaged ceiling would be repaired immediately' while the 'rusted' roof 'would be painted with a covering of red oxide' which 'would not enhance the appearance of the building but would help to preserve it'.\n\nA photograph and article from The Argus' 'Week-end Magazine' in 1941 stating that the cottage had been removed from the site and rebuilt at Mt. Evelyn received reader replies, including one from a representative of the Historical Society of Victoria, that the removed building had belonged to a Thomas Elder Boyd, not La Trobe. A further reader reply, from a correspondent of Charles La Trobe's daughter Eleanor, wrote that when 'Bedggood bought Governor La Trobe's house he wrote me and told me he had framed a letter he received from Miss La Trobe and attached it to the cottage'.\n\nIn March, 1942 it was reported that the cottage was to be demolished to make way for an air raid shelter that would accommodate 350 people. The following month 'a portion of the cottage' was 'taken down'. Mr. H.L. Bedggood said that the family would demolish the cottage 'with regret' to build the air shelter for its factory workers but it was a choice between destroying the 'old building' or the more recently added 19th century garden. However, 'if possible' the 'front portion of the cottage' would be retained.\n\nThe bricks from the demolition were turned into doorstops by 'Mrs. H. C. Colville, Burke rd, Hawthorn and sold at the 'Red Cross Variety Shop at 82 Collins st, Melbourne'. In making the doorstops 'Mrs Colville covers the sides and back with green felt, and on the front is a small copper plate bearing the inscription \"Brick from residence of Victoria's first Governor, 1939.\"' The doorstops sold for 3 shillings but for an extra shilling the buyer could 'have the brick covered with felt to match the room where it will be used'. The Red Cross had other bricks from the cottage for sale which 'would be most suitable for use as garden paving squares or surrounds' and, for 10 shillings and sixpence, landscape gardener Edna Walling would 'plan designs and supervise construction'. Also available for sale were 'other interesting relics from the cottage' including '5 windows with wood and metal frames', 3 doors, '10 panel wall sections' and 'one pair of cedar shutters'.\n\nBefore the 1956 Summer Olympics, that were held in Melbourne, a letter to editor remarked on the 'sorry condition' of the cottage with its roof 'thick with rust, the walls dingy with grime, the garden untidy' and expressed the hope it would be 'tidied up before the Games'. In reply, the following day, Horace Bedggood was quoted as saying:\n\nIn December 1963, the rebuilt cottage was officially opened at its new location in Kings Domain, as an historical landmark. It was later moved again, a short distance, and is now located backing on to Dallas Brooks Drive. It represents an early example of conservation of an endangered heritage building, utilising early techniques of heritage preservation but the cottage is 'largely a reconstruction' and it 'contains within it a small portion of authentic fabric, including one wall of the building originally prefabricated by Manning of London'. It is now operated as a museum by the National Trust of Australia, and is regularly open to the public.\n\n"}
{"id": "1981955", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1981955", "title": "Sonoma–Marin Area Rail Transit", "text": "Sonoma–Marin Area Rail Transit\n\nSonoma–Marin Area Rail Transit (SMART) is a passenger rail service and bicycle-pedestrian pathway project in Sonoma and Marin counties of the U.S. state of California. When completed, the entire system will serve a corridor between Cloverdale in northern Sonoma County and Larkspur Landing in Marin County.\n\nThe first phase of the system, a segment between Northern Santa Rosa and Downtown San Rafael, opened to public preview and excursion services (as far south as Marin Civic Center) on June 29, 2017. Regular service began on August 25, 2017, after Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) gave the final approval for the Positive Train Control (PTC) system. The southern of the line was completed to Larkspur with service commencing on December 14, 2019.\n\nThe last passenger rail service along the Northwestern Pacific Railroad south of Willits was discontinued in 1958 as automobile travel along US 101 increased in popularity.\n\nThe SMART District was established by state legislation in 2002. Previously disused station buildings were repaired in anticipation of reestablished rail service in Healdsburg and Windsor, and Cloverdale's depot was constructed in 1998.\n\nMitigation of environmental impacts was studied and summarized in a report issued in June 2006. The recommended remedies, which were certified without challenge, included silencing of some train horns in quiet zones and replacement of certain wetland ditches.\n\nOn October 10, 2013, SMART announced that it had obtained more than of an area in Novato known as the “Mira Monte Marina.” The purpose of this purchase is to restore the area and preserve tidal wetlands and habitat, which is all a part of SMART’s environmental mitigation program. According to SMART General Manager Farhad Mansourian, “This will not only address the of project impacts that were determined through the environmental review process for the next stage of construction, but ensures a local source for potential future mitigation needs for the rail and pathway project.”\n\nThe project is funded by federal, state, regional and local allocations (including bridge tolls), dedicated sales tax revenues, and fares. The capital cost of track rehabilitation for the full 70-mile line, signals, railcars, etc. was estimated to be about $450 million in 2008 (). By 2019, development of the line from Airport Boulevard in Santa Rosa to the San Rafael Transit Center totaled $448 million and the estimated cost to complete the legislated system had increased to $944 million.\n\nIn November 2006, Measure R, a proposal for funding though an increase in sales taxes, received a combined 65.3% \"yes\" vote in the two-county District, with 70.1% in favor in Sonoma County and 57.5% in favor in Marin County. Because it lacked the 2/3 supermajority needed for passage, that measure failed.\n\nMeasure Q, similar to Measure R, was approved on November 4, 2008. It received a combined vote of 69.5% in the two counties (73.5% approval in Sonoma County and 62.6% in Marin County). It provides funding for the project through a quarter-cent sales tax in both counties set to expire in 2029. This funding was initially thought sufficient to bring the line to completion by 2014. However, the economic downturn reduced the tax base, resulting in a plan to build the project in phases. The tax was expected to generate $890 million over its lifetime; the first decade brought in $289 million, well short of estimates.\n\nIn March 2020, SMART went back to the voters with Measure I to extend the sales tax, not scheduled to expire until 2029, for an additional thirty years; the measure ultimately failed.\n\nThe SMART Board authorized the sale of bonds in late 2011; proceeds were placed into an escrow account until the effort to repeal the sales tax was resolved.\n\nIn May 2012, SMART issued nearly $200 million in bonds to fund construction. The bonds will be paid off with the Measure Q quarter-cent sales tax revenue.\n\nIn January 2012, SMART completed final negotiations to start rebuilding the Initial Operating Segment (IOS) between Airport Blvd Santa Rosa and the Civic Center Station in San Rafael at a cost less than originally budgeted. The segment was completed jointly by Stacy & Witbeck and Herzog Contracting Corp. In 2012, SMART announced that it was adding two stations to the Initial Operation Segment: in north Santa Rosa, near Coddingtown, and in Novato at Atherton Avenue.\n\nThe Puerto Suello Hill Tunnel in San Rafael was rehabilitated for service and the 111-year old fixed span Haystack Bridge was replaced with a newer movable bascule bridge. Concrete ties were installed along the line to facilitate running up to and several spur lines were removed to adhere to federal safety standards. Businesses may connect a switch and spur to the line by purchasing the equipment for about $300,000.\n\nThe first phase of construction does not include the complete parallel pedestrian and bicycle path.\nScheduled passenger service, already delayed from an originally estimated 2014, had long been expected for late 2016. This resulted from lack of tax revenues due to the economic downturn, which also led to the project opening in phases.\n\nAs late 2016 approached, the agency further delayed opening the IOS between Northern Santa Rosa and Downtown San Rafael until \"late spring 2017.\" A crankshaft failure on a diesel engine used in the near-identical Nippon Sharyo diesel multiple unit trains operating in Toronto necessitated all of SMART's cars to be recalled for crank replacements, according to SMART management. The agency additionally had been experiencing problems with warning systems at some grade crossings, and had not fully completed its approval process with the Federal Railroad Administration. The 2017 California floods caused damage to the Puerto Suello Hill Tunnel, further delaying testing of the line.\n\nPreview service and excursion trips timed with the Marin County Fair began on June 29, 2017, with free fares as far south as Marin Civic Center. Full service commenced on August 25, 2017.\n\nThe cost to San Rafael of the Andersen Drive crossing of the Larkspur to San Rafael segment is significant. The street was extended by San Rafael in the mid-1990s to cross the tracks on a \"temporary road\". In July 1997, the California Public Utilities Commission informed the city that by the time SMART planned to operate on the section, the city had to build and pay for restoring the crossing. The estimated cost for that was $6 million in 2012.\n\nIn 2010, the agency received a federal earmark of $2.5 million for technical, environmental and engineering design on the segment. Later in 2010, the revamped Cal Park Hill Tunnel — wide, tall, and long — was opened to pedestrian traffic. The revamping was done at a cost of $28 million, paid equally by Marin County and SMART. The tunnel is used both for the rail right of way between Larkspur and San Rafael and by bicycles and pedestrians.\n\nIn May 2013, the SMART board approved a resolution designating the San Rafael to Larkspur link as its \"preferred alternative\". The agency submitted a letter to the Federal Transit Administration, and on September 24, 2013, SMART was accepted into its \"Small Starts\" program. The FY2016 Federal Budget included the funds to construct the Larkspur Extension under the Small Starts Program. Construction contracts were awarded to a joint venture of Stacy and Witbeck and Herzog Contracting Corporation at a cost of $36.3 million, and work commenced by late 2017 with an expected opening of late 2019. In April 2018, SMART was awarded a $22.5 million federal grant for the extension. Final costs for the extension are estimated to total $55.4 million. Train control and crossing system testing along the extension began in August 2019 and was completed by the end of October, whereupon driver training began. Revenue service commenced on December 14, 2019.\n\nConstruction of the Novato Downtown station began significantly after work began on the initial operating segment. It was partially constructed by the system's opening, but the station opened with the Larkspur extension.\n\nService was cancelled on October 28 and 29, 2019 due to preemptive power shutoffs affecting crossings throughout the system. Partial service as far north as Downtown Santa Rosa was established on October 30, and the following day full service was restored with free rides offered through November 6 to give transportation options to those affected by the Kincade Fire. According to Farhad Mansourian, the service disruptions had not impacted testing of the Larkspur extension and Downtown Novato station.\n\nThere is expected to be a service gap during the weekends of November 2019 between Petaluma to Novato–Hamilton as testing for the Downtown Novato station commences. A bus bridge was provided from both stations with a transfer at San Marin.\n\nThe line is expected to be extended to Windsor by late 2021 or early 2022. By 2018, the extension was expected to cost $55 million: $20 million from Road Repair and Accountability Act funds, $30 million in Regional Measure 3 funds, and a $5 million federal grant. By November 2019, the cost estimate had increased to $65 million with construction starting in 2020.\n\nThe route north of Santa Rosa to Cloverdale was initially intended to open with the initial segment, but lack of funding delayed this segment to commence service at a later date. The 2018 California State Rail Plan calls for extension to Cloverdale station by 2027. By May 2019, the estimated cost to complete the system to Cloverdale and Healdsburg was $364 million.\n\nSeveral services have been envisioned to expand the system. Additional infill stations serving Santa Rosa or Fulton may be added in the future.\nIn 2019, SMART released a study on the possibility of extending service along SMART (formerly NWP) owned and operated freight tracks between Ignacio and Schellville (near Sonoma), into Napa or Solano counties. Funding for the study was provided by the state in response to chronic flooding along the State Route 37 corridor. Not being member counties of the Sonoma–Marin Area Rail Transit District, a new funding mechanism would have to be established before service commenced. This line would allow the train to connect with the passenger ferry in Vallejo or the Amtrak station in Suisun City. , planners expect this rail link to be reactivated for service after 2040, and the 2019 study expected construction time between four and six years. Estimated at $1 billion, work on this link would not begin until after the initial 70-mile system was operational.\n\nAlso proposed is extending SMART north beyond Cloverdale to Ukiah or the planned NWP terminus in Willits, where it would connect with the California Western Railroad and its tourist services. A proposal to expand service to the East Bay over a rebuilt Richmond–San Rafael Bridge was named a Finalist in the Transformative Projects Process of the Metropolitan Transportation Commission's Plan Bay Area 2050.\n\nThe SMART District provides passenger service on the historic Northwestern Pacific right-of-way, which roughly parallels US Highway 101 and is owned by the SMART District from Healdsburg to Larkspur. There are 24 bridges in the segment from San Rafael to Santa Rosa, as well as 63 at grade crossings (with the possibility of adding more). A positive train control system, as mandated by the FRA for passenger services with grade crossings, was implemented for the length of the service corridor for customer and pedestrian safety.\n\nThe Northwestern Pacific Railroad corridor is also utilized by North Coast Railroad Authority (NCRA) freight services. Freight operator NWP Co began to serve businesses along the SMART right-of-way between Lombard (at the Napa River) and Windsor in 2011.\n\nIn December 2014, rains washed away some of the train track beds near Petaluma at Ely Road. A photo of the spot in December showed the tracks hidden beneath feet of water. A spokesperson for SMART said that \"Trains are not running yet, so this is something we will pay attention to.\"\n\nMany of the station platforms are located near historic depots in city centers. However, SMART does not directly utilize these, and all stops use newly-constructed high-floor platforms to allow level boarding onto and off of the train and provide accessibility. Stations typically include a small shelter with a peaked roof and a bench for seating; they also feature light poles, signs, and garbage cans.\n\nOriginal plans called for ten stations in the initial operating segment (IOS) with five more in a second phase. A further station was added in Novato's downtown district late in construction of the IOS, and did not open with the system's inauguration.\n\nThe SMART fleet consists of seven two-car Nippon Sharyo DMU trainsets with two additional sets totaling four cars on order. Each DMU car is powered by a Cummins QSK19-R diesel engine. The vehicles, designed specifically for SMART and another transit service, the Union Pearson Express in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, are slope-nosed and self-propelled by diesel engines that meet stringent \"Tier 4\" EPA requirements. For regular service, SMART runs DMUs in pairs or triplicate. Trains may be as long as station platforms provided there are cabs facing the outer ends.\n\nThe diesel multiple unit trainsets were ordered from Sumitomo Corporation of America / Nippon Sharyo at a cost of $46.7 million, or $6.67 million for each two car set. They were delivered to Rochelle, Illinois, for assembling, and then sent to the Transportation Technology Center, Inc. in Pueblo, Colorado, for testing. Under the contract, additional railcars may be ordered at a cost of $2.9 million per individual car. The first trainset arrived in Cotati, California, on April 7, 2015. The original order was for fourteen cars in seven two car trainsets, but on July 30, 2015, the state of California announced an $11 million grant to SMART to finance the purchase of three additional cars to be added to the fleet, allowing for three trainsets to be run with three cars, with an increase in capacity of 130 passengers over a two car trainset. In April 2016, SMART's general manager negotiated with CalSTA and Nippon Sharyo to adjust the order so SMART will receive two more full trainsets in place of the extra cars, bringing their fleet size to the required nine trainsets needed for service to Cloverdale. They will be painted in a McGlashan green livery.\n\nA July 2016 fire aboard one of Toronto's Nippon Sharyo units revealed a design flaw in the engine's crankshaft that would result in premature wear; SMART decided to delay operations until the engines could be serviced to correct the problem. All trains were refurbished at SMART's rail center by April 2017.\n\nIn the original sales tax expenditure plan, $90 million was allocated for a bike/pedestrian path along the line for recreation and to enhance connections between stations and the developing network of bicycle-pedestrian pathways. As a result of the Great Recession of 2008, SMART has changed its plans for the construction of the bicycle-pedestrian pathway as well as the commuter rail project. Current SMART pathway construction focuses on bridging gaps between existing bicycle-pedestrian pathways, providing access to stations and serving potential high-use areas. A number of segments are being constructed in partnership with local jurisdictions. For example, SMART has obtained a grant for pathway construction in Rohnert Park and is seeking grants to fund additional segments. As of February 2019, was completed with the majority of funding coming from local jurisdictions.\n\nTrains operate 19 round trips on weekdays. Southbound service begins at 4:30 A.M. with a final train at 6:37 P.M. while northbound service runs from 6:06 A.M. to 8:29 P.M. There are five round trips on weekends with the first train (southbound) departing at 7:35 A.M. and the final train (northbound) leaving at 6:39 P.M. According to the schedule, a train takes 1 hour 19 minutes to travel the route, an average of . As a Class 4 railroad, passenger speeds are limited to .\n\nThe system operates with fare zones and a proof-of-payment system with the San Francisco Bay-area Clipper card serving as a payment method. Tickets may also be purchased using the SMART eTickets mobile app. There are five zones in the initial opening segment which will expand to seven when service to Cloverdale is established. Zone ticketing requires little infrastructure at the stations but can be expensive for passengers making a short trip that crosses a zone boundary.\n\nFares start at $3.50 for a ride within one zone, with an additional $2 added for entering each new zone. Once a daily fare of $23 is reached (the maximum round-trip fare), no additional fares will be assessed for further travel that day. Transfers from Santa Rosa CityBus, Sonoma County Transit, Petaluma Transit, and Golden Gate Transit will receive a $1.50 reduction in fare per transfer ($0.75 for discounted tickets). A specialty transit card, the \"SMART EcoPass\", can be purchased in bulk by businesses, schools, and other agencies and will provide a discount of up to 50% for children, senior citizens, and people with disabilities. A monthly pass is also sold for $200 ($100 for eligible riders) which grants the bearer 31 days of unlimited travel from the date of first use. Parking is $2 daily or $20 for a monthly pass at stations, with no overnight parking.\n\nSMART train service was free of charge during the preview service period and the opening day of full service. After opening day, SMART fares were half price through Labor Day, September 4. Regular fares were charged beginning on September 5. The October 2017 Northern California wildfires and 2019 California wildfires prompted the agency to provide free limited service for evacuees.\n\nTrains may be run for special events, such as the Marin County Fair.\n\nUntil 2017, the Sonoma Raceway operated a race-day excursion service that utilized right-of-way owned by SMART, though not on the mainline tracks and using Amtrak equipment. A minimal platform had been constructed nearby.\n\nRidership in the second quarter of 2018 was 177,800, for a weekly average of 13,700. The highest single day ridership occurred on Saturday, August 18, 2018 when 4,735 trips were counted during a weekend of free rides.\n\nThe Sonoma–Marin Area Rail Transit District is a special-purpose district consisting of Sonoma and Marin Counties. The Board of Directors represent the various cities and transit agencies served along the main line. The twelve members consist of:\n\nIn January 2011, General Manager Lilian Hames, who had led the project for a decade, resigned amid ongoing concern about the project's financial challenges and the necessity to build it in phases. David Heath, the Chief Financial Officer, took over management duties until the appointment later that year of Farhad Mansourian as acting General Manager. In August 2011, Mansourian was appointed permanent General Manager, assuming both financial and general management responsibilities for the project.\n\nFor many years, Mansourian was Director of Public Works for Marin County, and his combined annual compensation from SMART ($346,000) and Marin County pension ($148,000) raised some questions initially. SMART board members said that the threat of a SMART repeal effort made bringing a general manager from an out-of-state rail system to the San Francisco Bay Area even more costly. They concluded that Mansourian's demonstrated abilities during his temporary assignment coupled with his knowledge of California's permitting requirements and successful delivery of complex public works projects in Marin County made him the best candidate.\n\nThe official color of SMART is McGlashan green, after former Marin county supervisor Charles McGlashan, a SMART proponent who died suddenly of a heart attack in 2011.\n\n"}

Her mother was Grace Hubbard Fortescue (1883–1979) and father was Granville Roland Fortescue (1875–1952).\nShe married Navy lieutenant Thomas Hedges Massie (1905–1987), who was stationed at Pearl Harbor.\n\nIn September 1931, Thalia Massie was found by a passing driver, Eustace Bellinger, wandering along Ala Moana Road in Honolulu at about 1 am on a Sunday morning. She had been beaten and had suffered a broken jaw after being abducted while leaving a party at the nearby Ala Wai Inn. When questioned by Bellinger and his passenger George Clark, Jr., she stated that a group of 5 or 6 Hawaiian boys had assaulted her. Later at the hospital she claimed to police that she had been raped as well as assaulted.\n\nSubsequently, five young men, Horace Ida, Henry Chang, Joseph Kahahawai, Benny Ahakuelo, and David Takai, two of Hawaiian ancestry, two of Japanese ancestry, and one of half Chinese/Hawaiian ancestry, who were initially arrested for assaulting a Hawaiian woman, Agnes Peeples, earlier that same night were later also charged with the rape of Massie. Joseph Kahahawai, a boxer, admitted to the earlier assault on Peeples, whom he had slugged and knocked over during a road rage incident at King and Liliha Streets, but all defendants denied having been involved in the assault on Mrs. Massie. The men were represented by two of the foremost criminal lawyers in the islands, William Heen and William B. Pittman, and the mixed-race jury deadlocked along racial lines. The five defendants were released on bail to await retrial at a later date. \n\nThalia's mother, Grace Fortescue, was deeply disturbed by the release of the defendants and many U.S. Navy personnel at Pearl Harbor were outraged.

Defended by attorney Clarence Darrow of the Scopes Monkey Trial fame, Fortescue, Thalia's husband Thomas Massie, and two Navy sailors were eventually tried and convicted of manslaughter in the death of Kahahawai.

The novel follows the life of a Finnish family from 1880, through the First World War, the Finnish Civil War and the Second World War, to about 1950. Through the lives of ordinary people, it describes the clash of ideals in Finland's language strife and the struggle between the Whites (nationalists) and the Reds (socialists) in the movement to Independence and Civil War.\n\nThe novel shares one main character, Vilho Koskela, and covers some of the same events as another novel: \"The Unknown Soldier\" by the author.\n\nThe story opens with Jussi, a farm hand from Häme, clearing marshland to create a croft, which will later be called Koskela. In the first part of the book tension mounts between crofters and land owners. Jussi's son Akseli becomes an active socialist. At the same time the upper classes are concerned with language strife and Finland's relationship with Russia.\n\nIn the second part the Finnish Civil War breaks out. The book describes the atrocities committed on both sides, as well as the tensions which lead up to them. The war hits Koskela harshly, for the family loses two sons.\n\nIn the third part the community is dominated by the whites, the victors of the Civil War. In Koskela, however, matters improve as crofters are liberated and Koskela becomes an independent farm. Things turn for the worse at the outbreak of the Second World War. Again Koskela pays a heavy price, losing three sons. The last chapters of the book concentrate on the reconciliatory atmosphere created by the joint hardships endured during the war.\n\n\nThe book is considered a classic in Finland with print runs into hundreds of thousands. Even most of those who have not read the book recognise the opening words \"In the beginning there were the marsh, the hoe – and Jussi\".\n\nThe second book in the trilogy, \"The Uprising\", generated considerable controversy over its portrayal of the Finnish Civil War because, for the first time, a novel was published that was sympathetic (on human terms, not politically) towards the Reds. Up until then, all history on the Finnish Civil War had been written by the Whites. \"Under the North Star\" played a crucial role in starting a discussion in Finland over what really happened in 1918 and in healing decades-old wounds between the two factions.\n\n\"Under the North Star\" has been translated into English by Richard Impola:\n\nUnfortunately these translated publications contain many typographical errors.\n\n\n"}

He earned a M.A. degree in Landscape Architecture (1927) from Cornell University where he met Frances Elizabeth Watson (September 20, 1904 – April 10, 1999) whom he married in 1928; they had no children. The Sommers moved to Tucson, Arizona in 1931 and then Prescott, Arizona in 1935. Sommer became a naturalized citizen of the United States on November 18, 1939.\n\nConsidered a master photographer, Sommer first experimented with photography in 1931 after being diagnosed with tuberculosis the year prior. Early works on paper (starting in 1931) include watercolors, and evolve to pen-and-ink or brush plus drawings of visually composed musical score. Concurrent to the works on paper, Sommer started to seriously explore the artistic possibilities of photography in 1938 when he acquired an 8×10 Century Universal Camera, eventually encompassing the genres of still life (chicken parts and assemblage), horizonless landscapes, jarred subjects, cut-paper, cliché-verre negatives and nudes. According to art critic Robert C. Morgan, Sommer's \"most extravagant, subtle, majestic, and impressive photographs—comparable in many ways to the views of Yosemite Valley’s El Capitan and Half Dome by Ansel Adams—were Sommer’s seemingly infinite desert landscapes, some of which he referred to as 'constellations.'\" The last artistic body of work Sommer produced (1989–1999) was collage based largely on anatomical illustrations.\n\nFrederick Sommer had significant artistic relationships with Edward Weston, Max Ernst, Aaron Siskind, Richard Nickel, Minor White, and others. His archive (of negatives and correspondence) was part of founding the Center for Creative Photography in 1975 along with Ansel Adams, Harry Callahan, Wynn Bullock, and Aaron Siskind. He taught briefly at Prescott College during the late 60s and substituted for Harry Callahan at IIT Institute of Design in 1957–1958 and later at the Rhode Island School of Design.\n\nBruce Silverstein Gallery is the New York representative of the Frederick & Frances Sommer Foundation.\n\nIn 1934, Frederick Sommer visited Los Angeles. Walking through the art museum one day, he noticed a display of musical scores. He saw them not as music, but as graphics, and found in them an elegance and grace that led him to a careful study of scores and notation.\n\nHe found that the best music was visually more effective and attractive. He assumed that there was a correlation between music as we hear it and its notation; and he wondered if drawings that used notational motifs and elements could be played. He made his first “drawings in the manner of musical scores” that year. (After reviewing this text, Fred asked that the author refer to his scores “only” in this way. When the author suggested that it was perhaps too long to be repeated throughout the text, he laughed and said, “Well, use it at least once.”)\n\nAlthough people knew of his scores, and occasionally brought musicians to his house to play them, no one ever stayed with it for long. In 1967, both Walton Mendelson and Stephen Aldrich attended Prescott College, Prescott, Arizona, where Sommer was on the faculty. They barely knew of his reputation as a photographer, and nothing of the scores. Towards the end of September he invited them to his house for dinner, but they were to come early, and Mendelson was to bring my flute. “Can you play that?” he asked, as they looked at one of the scores, framed, and sitting atop his piano. With no guidance from him, they tried. Nervous and unsure of what they were getting into, they stopped midway through. Mendelson asked Alddrich where he was in the score: he pointed to where Mendelson had stopped. They knew then, mysterious though the scores were, they could be played. On May 9, 1968, the first public performance of the music of Frederick Sommer was given at Prescott College.\n\nSommer had no musical training. He didn't know one note from another on his piano, nor could he read music. His record collection was surprisingly broad for that time, and his familiarity with it was thorough. What surprised Mendelson and Aldrich when they first met him were his visual skills: he could identify many specific pieces and almost any major composer by looking at the shapes of the notation on a page of printed music.\n\nOf Sommer's known works, his drawings, glue-color on paper, photographs, and writings, it is only these scores that have been a part of his creative life throughout the entirety of his artistic career. He was still drawing elegant scores in 1997. And like his skip reading, they are the closest insight to his creative process, thinking and aesthetic.\n\nFor detailed chronology, biography, bibliography, and images see\n\nFor more information on the music Frederick Sommer, with musical examples see:\n\nFor the complete performances: \n"}

{"id": "1981994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1981994", "title": "Ghazi (warrior)", "text": "Ghazi (warrior)\n\nGhazi (, ') originally referred to individuals who participated in ghazw (, '), meaning military expeditions or raiding. The latter term was applied in early Islamic literature to expeditions led by the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and later taken up by Turkic military leaders to describe their wars of conquest. \n\nIn the context of the wars between Russia and the Muslim peoples of the Caucasus, starting as early as the late 18th century's Sheikh Mansur's resistance to Russian expansion, the word usually appears in the form \"gazavat\" (). Other forms of the term have been used in recent times by jihadist groups.\n\nIn English language literature, the word often appears as \"razzia\", a borrowing through French from Maghrebi Arabic. In modern Turkish, it is used to refer to veterans, and also as a title for Turkic champions such as Ertuğrul, Osman Gazi and Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.\n\nIn pre-Islamic Bedouin culture, ghazw[a] was a form of limited warfare verging on brigandage that avoided head-on confrontations and instead emphasized raiding and looting, usually of livestock (see cattle raiding). The Umayyad-period Bedouin poet al-Kutami wrote the oft-quoted verses: \"Our business is to make raids on the enemy, on our neighbor and our own brother, in the event we find none to raid but a brother.\" (Semi-institutionalized raiding of livestock herds was not unique to the Bedouins; the Soviet anthropologists adopted the Kazakh word \"barymta\" to describe similar practices of nomads in the Eurasian steppes, and similar dynamics were widespread in pre-feudal Ireland.) William Montgomery Watt hypothesized that Muhammad found it useful to divert this continuous internecine warfare toward his enemies, making it the basis of his war strategy; according to Watt, the celebrated battle of Badr started as one such razzia. As a form of warfare, the \"razzia\" was then mimicked by the Christian states of Iberia in their relations with the taifa states; rough synonyms and similar tactics are the Iberian \"cavalgada\" and the Anglo-French \"chevauchée\".\n\nThe word \"razzia\" was used in French colonial context particularly for raids to plunder and capture slaves from among the people of Western and Central Africa, also known as \"rezzou\" when practiced by the Tuareg. The word was adopted from \"ġaziya\" of Algerian Arabic vernacular and later became a figurative name for any act of pillage, with its verb form \"razzier\".\n\n\"Ghazi\" (, \"\") is an Arabic word, the active participle of the verb \"ġazā\", meaning 'to carry out a military expedition or raid'; the same verb can also mean 'to strive for' and \"Ghazi\" can thus share a similar meaning to Mujahid or \"one who struggles\". The verbal noun of \"ġazā\" is \"ġazw\" or \"ġazawān\", with the meaning 'raiding'. A derived singulative in \"ġazwah\" refers to a single battle or raid. The term \"ghāzī\" dates to at least the Samanid period, where he appears as a mercenary and frontier fighter in Khorasan and Transoxiana. Later, up to 20,000 of them took part in the Indian campaigns of Mahmud of Ghazni.\n\n\"Ghāzī\" warriors depended upon plunder for their livelihood, and were prone to brigandage and sedition in times of peace. The corporations into which they organized themselves attracted adventurers, zealots and religious and political dissidents of all ethnicities. In time, though, soldiers of Turkic ethnicity predominated, mirroring the acquisition of Mamluks, Turkic slaves in the Mamluk retinues and guard corps of the caliphs and emirs and in the ranks of the \"ghazi\" corporation, some of whom would ultimately rise to military and later political dominance in various Muslim states.\n\nOttoman historian Ahmedi in his work explain the meaning of Ghazi:\nA Ghazi is the instrument of the religion of Allah, a servant of God who purifies the earth from the filth of polytheism. The Ghazi is the sword of God, he is the protector and the refuge of the believers. If he becomes a martyr in the ways of God, do not believe that he has died, he lives in beatitude with Allah, he has eternal life.\nIn the west, Turkic \"ghāzīs\" made continual incursions along the Byzantine frontier zone, finding in the akritai (akritoi) their Greek counterparts. After the Battle of Manzikert these incursions intensified, and the region's people would see the \"ghāzī\" corporations coalesce into semi-chivalric fraternities, with the white cap and the club as their emblems. The height of the organizations would come during the Mongol conquest when many of them fled from Persia and Turkistan into Anatolia.\n\nAs organizations, the \"ghazi\" corporations were fluid, reflecting their popular character, and individual \"ghāzī\" warriors would jump between them depending upon the prestige and success of a particular emir, rather like the mercenary bands around western condottiere. It was from these Anatolian territories conquered during the \"ghazw\" that the Ottoman Empire emerged, and in its legendary traditions it is said that its founder, Osman I, came forward as a \"ghāzī\" thanks to the inspiration of Shaikh Ede Bali.\n\nIn later periods of Islamic history the honorific title of \"ghāzī\" was assumed by those Muslim rulers who showed conspicuous success in extending the domains of Islam, and eventually the honorific became exclusive to them, much as the Roman title imperator became the exclusive property of the supreme ruler of the Roman state and his family.\n\nThe Ottomans were probably the first to adopt this practice, and in any case the institution of \"ghazw\" reaches back to the beginnings of their state:\n\nThe first nine Ottoman chiefs all used Ghazi as part of their full throne name (as with many other titles, the nomination was added even though it did not fit the office), and often afterwards. However, it never became a formal title within the ruler's formal style, unlike \"Sultan ul-Mujahidin\", used by Sultan Murad Khan II Khoja-Ghazi, 6th Sovereign of the House of Osman (1421–1451), styled 'Abu'l Hayrat, Sultan ul-Mujahidin, Khan of Khans, Grand Sultan of Anatolia and Rumelia, and of the Cities of Adrianople and Philippolis.\n\nBecause of the political legitimacy that would accrue to those bearing this title, Muslim rulers vied amongst themselves for preeminence in the \"ghāziya\", with the Ottoman Sultans generally acknowledged as excelling all others in this feat:\n\n\"Ghazi\" was also used as a title of honor in the Ottoman Empire, generally translated as the Victorious, for military officers of high rank, who distinguished themselves in the field against non-Moslem enemies; thus it was conferred on Osman Pasha after his famous defence of Plevna in Bulgaria and on Mustafa Kemal Paşa (later known as Mustafa Kemal Atatürk) for leading the defense against the Gallipoli campaign.\n\nSome Muslim rulers (in Afghanistan) personally used the subsidiary style Padshah-i-Ghazi.\n\n\"Ghazwah\", which literally means \"campaigns\", is typically used by biographers to refer to all the Prophet's journeys from Medina, whether to make peace treaties and preach Islam to the tribes, to go on \"ʽumrah\", to pursue enemies who attacked Medina, or to engage in the nine battles.\n\nMuhammad participated in 27 Ghazwa. The first Ghazwa he participated in was the Invasion of Waddan in August 623, he ordered his followers to attack a Quraysh caravan.\n\nWhen performed within the context of Islamic warfare, the \"ghazw\"'s function was to weaken the enemy's defenses in preparation for his eventual conquest and subjugation. Because the typical \"ghazw\" raiding party often did not have the size or strength to seize military or territorial objectives, this usually meant sudden attacks on weakly defended targets (e.g. villages) with the intent of demoralizing the enemy and destroying material which could support their military forces. Though Islam's rules of warfare offered protection to non-combatants such as women, monastics and peasants in that they could not be slain, their property could still be looted or destroyed, and they themselves could be abducted and enslaved (\"Cambridge History of Islam\", p. 269):\n\nA good source on the conduct of the traditional \"ghazw\" raid are the medieval Islamic jurists, whose discussions as to which conduct is allowed and which is forbidden in the course of warfare reveal some of the practices of this institution. One such source is Averroes' \"Bidāyat al-Mujtahid wa-Nihāyat al-Muqtasid\" (translated in Peters, \"Jihad in Classical and Modern Islam: A Reader\", Chapter 4).\n\nIn the 19th century, Muslim fighters in North Caucasus who were resisting the Russian military operations declared a \"gazawat\" (understood as holy war) against the Russian Orthodox invasion. Although uncertain, it is believed that Dagestani Islamic scholar Muhammad Yaragskii was the ideologist of this holy war. In 1825, a congress of ulema in the village of Yarag declared \"gazawat\" against the Russians. Its first leader was Ghazi Muhammad; after his death, Imam Shamil would eventually continue it. During the Second Chechen War, Chechnya announced \"gazawat\" against Russia.\n\nAfter the terrorist attacks on Paris in November 2015, the Islamic State group is said to have referred to its actions as \"ghazwa\". Probably the most famous use of the term \"ghazwa\" is in the phrase 'Manhattan Raid', used by Al-Qaeda to refer to the September 11th attacks.\n\nIslamist and Jihadist terrorist organizations, such as Al-Qaeda, Islamic State, Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind (AGH) and Islamic State in Jammu and Kashmir (ISJK), etc., frequently call for waging of \"Ghazwa-e-Hind\" (war of conquest and conversion against the land of Hindus), in reference to Hadith of Ghazwa-e-Hind.\n\nIn modern Turkey, gazi is used to refer to veterans. 19 September is celebrated as Veterans Day in Turkey.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The company is a subsidiary of Wolverine World Wide.\n\nThe company's first factory was founded in 1898 at Kutztown, Pennsylvania, on the high banks of the Saucony Creek (from which the company would get its name) by four business men. In 1910, Russian immigrant A.R. Hyde started a shoe company in Cambridge, Massachusetts, called Hyde Athletic Industries. Over the years, Hyde became known for making athletic footwear including brands such as SpotBilt and PF Flyers; Hyde Athletic Industries bought Saucony in the late 1960s, and moved it to Cambridge. In 1979 two of Saucony's running shoes were selected in the top 10 by Runner's World magazine (the Hornet was chosen best value) and by the following spring the demand for the product had gone up 20 fold. In the late 1980s, when Saucony became Hyde's dominant brand, the name of the company was officially changed from Hyde Athletic Industries to Saucony.\n\nSaucony's shoe boxes once had the phrase \"sock a knee\" printed on them, which represents the correct pronunciation of the company's name. The Saucony brand logo represents the Saucony Creek's constant flow, and the boulders lining its creek bed.\nThe company is a popular racing shoe producer, making track spikes and cross country racing flats. Saucony also makes shoes for specific track and field athletics events.\nIn 2005 Saucony was acquired by Stride Rite Corporation for $170 million. Stride Rite Corporation was then acquired in 2007 for $800 million by Payless ShoeSource and the combined company became known as Collective Brands. In 2012, the Performance Lifestyle Group of Collective Brands, which included Saucony, along with Keds, Stride Rite and Sperry Top-Sider, became part of Wolverine World Wide in a $1.23 billion transaction that also involved the sale of Payless ShoeSource and Collective Licensing International to private equity firms Blum Capital Partners and Golden Gate Capital. In 2016, Wolverine World Wide relocated Saucony and its other Boston-area brands to a new regional headquarters location in Waltham, Massachusetts.\n\nWolverine World Wide sources a majority of its footwear from numerous third party manufacturers in Asia Pacific and South America.\n\nThe company offers a variety of shoes, such as running, trail running, racing, walking, and a college collection. Each of these types of shoes utilizes specific technology relevant to the type of targeted activity. The shoes are designed for 3 main purposes: racing, running, and walking. Shoes are also made by focusing on the runner's foot size, type of running, arch type, pronation, and running location.\n\nOn April 3, 2018, Saucony teamed up with the Massachusetts-based doughnut and coffee company, Dunkin' Donuts to produce a strawberry-frosted donut themed running shoe to commemorate the 122nd running of the Boston Marathon. The Saucony X Dunkin’ Kinvara 9 comes in a donut box and the heel of the shoe is covered in rainbow sprinkles. The company again released a Dunkin' themed running shoe in March 2019 on the successor to the Kinvara 9, the Kinvara 10.\n\nOriginals are Saucony's heritage range, which includes reintroduced older shoe styles produced by the company, which have been improved with better materials and different colorways. These include the popular Shadow model and Jazz model, the latter of which remains the company's biggest selling product of all time.\n\n"}

{"id": "1982016", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1982016", "title": "Paul Steinhardt", "text": "Paul Steinhardt\n\nPaul Joseph Steinhardt (born December 25, 1952) is an American theoretical physicist whose principal research is in cosmology and condensed matter physics. He is currently the Albert Einstein Professor in Science at Princeton University where he is on the faculty of both the Departments of Physics and of Astrophysical Sciences. \n\nSteinhardt is best known for his development of new theories of the origin, evolution and future of the universe. He is also well known for his exploration of a new form of matter, known as quasicrystals. \n\nHe has written two popular books on these topics. \"Endless Universe: Beyond the Big Bang (2007)\", co-authored with Neil Turok, describes the early struggles in challenging the widely accepted big bang theory and the subsequent development of the bouncing or cyclic theories of the universe, which are currently being explored and tested. \"The Second Kind of Impossible: The Extraordinary Quest for a New Form of Matter (2019)\" recounts the story of quasicrystals from his invention of the concept with his then-student Dov Levine, to his expedition to far eastern Russia to recover meteorite fragments containing natural quasicrystal grains formed billions of years ago.\n\nSteinhardt received his Bachelor of Science in Physics at Caltech in 1974, and his Ph.D. in Physics at Harvard University in 1978 where his advisor was Sidney Coleman. He was a Junior Fellow in the Harvard Society of Fellows from 1978–81; rose from junior faculty to Mary Amanda Wood Professor the University of Pennsylvania between 1981 and 1998, during which he maintained a long-term association with the Thomas J. Watson Research Center; and has been on the faculty at Princeton University since the Fall of 1998. He co-founded the Princeton Center for Theoretical Science and served as its Director from 2007 to 2019. \n\nBeginning in the early 1980s, Steinhardt co-authored seminal papers that helped to lay the foundations of inflationary cosmology.\n\nSlow-roll inflation and Generation of the seeds for galaxies: In 1982, Steinhardt and Andreas Albrecht (and, independengly, Andrei Linde) constructed the first inflationary models that could speed up the expansion of the universe enough to explain the observed smoothness and flatness of the universe and then \"gracefully exit\" to the more modest expansion observed today. The Albrecht-Steinhardt paper was the first to note the effect of Hubble friction in sustaining inflation for a sufficiently long period (the “slow-roll” effect), setting the prototype for most subsequent inflationary models. \n\nHubble friction played a critical role in the 1983 paper by James Bardeen, Steinhardt and Michael S. Turner who were the first introduce a reliable, relativistically gauge invariant method to compute how quantum fluctuations during inflation might naturally generate a nearly scale-invariant spectrum of density fluctuations with a small tilt, properties later shown by observations of the cosmic microwave background to be features of our universe. The density fluctuations are seeds about which galaxies eventually form. Contemporaneous calculations by several other groups obtained similar conclusions using less rigorous methods. \n\nEternal inflation and the multiverse: In 1982, Steinhardt presented the first example of eternal inflation. Neverending inflation was eventually shown to be a generic feature of inflationary models that leads to a multiverse, the break-up of space into an infinite multitude of patches spanning an infinite range of outcomes instead of the single smooth and flat universe, as originally hoped when first proposed. \n\nAlthough some cosmologists would later come to embrace the multiverse, Steinhardt consistently expressed his concern that it utterly destroys the predictive power of the theory he helped create. Because the inflationary theory leads to a multiverse that allows for every possible outcome, Steinhardt argued, we must conclude that the inflationary theory actually predicts nothing. \n\nImprint of gravitational waves on the cosmic microwave background: In 1993, Robert Crittenden, Rick Davis, J.R. Bond, G. Efstathiou and Steinhardt performed the first calculations of the complete imprint of gravitational waves on the B-mode temperature maps and on the polarization of the microwave background radiation in 1993.\n\nDespite his criticisms of the idea, Steinhardt's major contributions to the inflationary theory were recognized in 2002 when he shared the Dirac Prize with Alan Guth of M.I.T. and Andrei Linde of Stanford.\n\nThe unlikeliness problem: In 2013, Anna Ijjas, Abraham Loeb and Steinhardt added to the criticisms in a widely discussed pair of papers that the inflationary model was much less likely to explain our universe than previously thought. \n\nAccording to their analysis of the Planck satellite 2013 results, the chances of obtaining a universe matching the observations after a period of inflation is less than one in a googolplex. Steinhardt and his team dubbed the result the “unlikeliness problem.” The two papers also showed that Planck satellite data ruled out what had been historically accepted as the simplest inflationary models and that the remaining inflationary models require more parameters, more fine-tuning of those parameters, and more unlikely initial conditions. \n\nIn 2015, the unlikeness problem was reaffirmed and strengthened by a subsequent round of measurements reported by the Planck satellite team.\n\nIncompatibility with the string-swampland conjectures: In 2018, Steinhardt, in collaboration with Prateek Agrawal, George Obieds, and Cumrun Vafa, argued that inflation may also be incompatible with string theory because inflationary models generally violate constraints (sometimes called the “swampland conjectures”) on what is required for a model to be consistent with quantum gravity. \n\nMotivated by what he viewed as the failures of inflationary theory, Steinhardt became a leading developer of a new class of cosmological models that replace the so-called big bang with a bounce. The new theory envisions a smooth transition from a previous period of contraction to the current period of expansion, avoiding any need for inflation and evading the infamous cosmic singularity problem associated with a big bang. A natural extension of these ideas is a neverbeginning and neverending cyclic universe in which epochs of bounce, expansion, and contraction repeat at regular intervals.\n\nEarly models: The first examples of these bouncing and cyclic models, referred to as \"ekpyrotic,\" were presented in papers in 2001 with Justin Khoury, Burt A. Ovrut and Neil Turok. \n\nThe first model was based on the speculative notion suggested by string theory that the universe has extra-dimensions bounded by “branes” (where “brane” is derived from \"membrane,\" a basic object in string theory). The bounce corresponded to the collision and rebound of these branes. The bounce (that is, brane collision) would be a violent event that would depend sensitively on quantum gravity effects that are not yet established. In 2002, Steinhardt and Turok then incorporated the ekpyrotic idea into a bolder proposal: an early version of a cyclic theory of the universe. \n\nThe New Cyclic Model: More recent versions developed by Anna Ijjas and Steinhardt do not require extra dimensions or branes or string theory; ordinary fields with potential energy evolving in space-time, similar to inflationary models, can be used. Furthermore, the bounce is a gentle transition that can be fully computed because it occurs long before quantum gravity effects become important. There is no cosmic singularity problem, unlike theories based on the big bang. \n\nIn the cyclic version of these models, space never crunches; rather, it necessarily grows overall from bounce to bounce every 100 billion years or so. After each bounce, gravitational energy is converted into the matter and radiation that fuels the next cycle. To an observer, the evolution appears to be cyclic because the temperature, density, number of stars and galaxies, etc., are on average the same from one cyclic to the next and the observer cannot see far enough to know that there is more space. The fact that the universe expands overall from cycle to cycle means that the entropy produced in earlier cycles (by the formation of stars and other entropy-producing processes) is increasingly diluted as the cycles proceed and so does not have any physical effect on cosmic evolution. This growth from cycle to cycle and associated entropy dilution are features that distinguish these new cyclic models from versions discussed in the 1920s by Friedmann and Tolman, and explain how the new cyclic model avoids the “entropy problem” that beset the earlier versions.\n\nAdvantages: Cyclic models have two important advantages over inflationary models. First, because they do not include inflation, they do not produce a multiverse. As a result, unlike inflation, cyclic models produce a single universe that everywhere have the same predicted properties that are subject to empirical tests. Second, cyclic models explain why there must be dark energy. According to these modes, the accelerated expansion caused by dark energy starts the smoothing process, the decay of dark energy to other forms of energy starts a period of slow contraction, and the slow contraction is what is responsible for smoothing and flattening the universe.\n\nPredictions: One prediction of the cyclic models is that, unlike inflation, no detectable gravitational waves are generated during the smoothing and flattening process. Instead, the only source of gravitational waves on cosmic wavelength scales are so-called “secondary gravitational waves” that are produced long after the bounce with amplitudes that are far too weak to be found in current detectors but ultimately detectable. A second prediction is that the current acceleration expansion must eventually stop and the vacuum must be eventually decay in order to initiate the next cycle. (Other predictions depend on the specific fields (or branes) that cause the contraction.) \n\nThe cyclic model may naturally explain why the cosmological constant is exponentially small and positive, compared to the enormous value expected by quantum gravity theories. The cosmological constant might begin large, as expected, but then slowly decay over the course of many cycles to the tiny value observed today.\n\nThe discovery of the Higgs field at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) may provide added support for the cyclic model. Evidence from the LHC suggests that the current vacuum may decay in the future, according to calculations made by Steinhardt, Turok and Itzhak Bars. The decay of the current vacuum is required by the cyclic model in order to end the current phase of expansion, contract, bounce and a new era of expansion; the Higgs provides a possible mechanism of decay that can be tested. The Higgs field is a viable candidate for the field that drives the cycles of expansion and contraction.\n\nDark energy and dark matter: Steinhardt has made significant contributions researching the \"dark side\" of the universe: dark energy, the cosmological constant problem and dark matter.\n\nFirst evidence of cosmic acceleration: In 1995, Steinhardt and Jeremiah Ostriker used a concordance of cosmological observations to show there must be a non-zero dark energy component today, more than 65 percent of the total energy density, sufficient to cause the expansion of the universe to accelerate. This was verified three years later by supernova observations in 1998.\n\nQuintessence: Working with colleagues, he subsequently introduced the concept of quintessence, a form of dark energy that varies with time. It was first posited by Steinhardt's team as an alternative to the cosmological constant, which is (by definition) constant and static; quintessence is dynamic. Its energy density and pressure evolve over time. The 2018 paper on swampland conjectures with Agrawal, Obieds and Vafa points to quintessence as being the only option for dark energy in string theory and consistent quantum gravity.\n\nSelf-interacting dark matter: In 2000, David Spergel and Steinhardt first introduced the concept of strongly self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) to explain various anomalies in standard cold dark models based on assuming dark matter consists of weakly interacting massive particles (also referred to as \"WIMPs\") \n\nIn 2014, Steinhardt, Spergel and Jason Pollack have proposed that a small fraction of dark matter could have ultra-strong self-interactions, which would cause the particles to coalesce rapidly and collapse into seeds for early supermassive black holes.\n\nDevelopment of the theory: In 1983, Steinhardt and his then-student Dov Levine first introduced the theoretical concept of quasicrystals in a patent disclosure. The complete theory was published the following year in a paper entitled \"Quasicrystals: A New Class of Ordered Structures.\" The theory proposed the existence of a new phase of solid matter analogous to Penrose tilings with rotational symmetries previously thought to be impossible for solids. Steinhardt and Levine named the new phase of matter a \"quasicrystal.\" The never-before-seen atomic structure had quasiperiodic atomic ordering, rather than the periodic ordering characteristic of conventional crystals.\n\nThe new theory overturned 200 years of scientific dogma and proved that quasicrystals could violate all of the previously accepted mathematical theorems about the symmetry of matter. Symmetries once thought to be forbidden for solids are actually possible for quasicrystals, including solids with axes of five-fold symmetry and three-dimensional icosahedral symmetry.\n\nThe first synthetic quasicrystal: Working simultaneously to, but independently of, Steinhardt and Levine, Dan Shechtman, Ilan Blech, Denis Gratias and John Cahn at the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) were focused on an experimental discovery they could not explain. It was an unusual alloy of manganese and aluminum with a diffraction pattern of what appeared to be sharp (though not perfectly point-like) spots arranged with icosahedral symmetry that did not fit any known crystal structure. The alloy was first noted in 1982, but results were not published until November 1984 after more convincing data had been obtained.\n\nSteinhardt and Levine were shown a preprint of the Shechtman team's paper and immediately recognized that it could be experimental proof of their still-unpublished quasicrystal theory. The theory, along with the proposal that it could explain the mysterious, forbidden structure of the new alloy was published in December 1984. \n\nThe new alloy was ultimately discovered to be problematic. It proved to be unstable and the noted imperfections in the diffraction pattern allowed for multiple explanations (including one about crystal twinning proposed by Linus Pauling) that were hotly debated for the next few years. \n\nIn 1987, An-Pang Tsai and his group at Japan's Tohoku University made an important breakthrough with the synthesis of the first-ever stable icosahedral quasicrystal. It had sharp diffraction spots arranged in close accord with Steinhardt and Levine's quasicrystal theory and was inconsistent with any of the alternative explanations. The theoretical debate was effectively ended and the Steinhardt-Levine theory gained wide acceptance. \n\nThe first natural quasicrystal: In 1999, Steinhardt assembled a team at Princeton University to search for a natural quasicrystal. The team, composed of Peter Lu, Ken Deffeyes and Nan Yao, devised a novel mathematical algorithm to search through an international database of powder diffraction patterns. \n\nFor the first eight years, the search yielded no results. In 2007, Italian scientist Luca Bindi, then curator of the mineral collection at the Universite’ di Firenze, joined the team. Two years later, Bindi identified a promising specimen in his museum's storage room. The tiny specimen, a few millimeters across, had been packed away in a box labeled \"khatyrkite,\" which is an ordinary crystal composed of copper and aluminum. On January 2, 2009, Steinhardt and Nan Yao, director of the Princeton Imaging Center, examined the material and identified the signature diffraction pattern of an icosahedral quasicrystal. This was the first known natural quasicrystal. \nThe International Mineralogical Association accepted the quasicrystal as a new mineral and designated its name, icosahedrite. The material had exactly the same atomic composition (AlCuFe) as the first thermodynamically stable quasicrystal synthesized by An-Pang Tsai and his group in their laboratory in 1987.\n\nExpedition to Chukotka: Two years after identifying the museum sample, Steinhardt organized an international team of experts and led them on an expedition to its source, the remote Listventovyi stream in the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug in the northern half of the Kamchatka Peninsula in far eastern Russia. The team included Bindi and Valery Kryachko, the Russian ore geologist who had found the original samples of khatyrkite crystal while working at the Listventovyi stream in 1979. Other members of the team were: Chris Andronicos, Vadim Distler, Michael Eddy, Alexander Kostin, Glenn MacPherson, Marina Yudovskaya, and Steinhardt's son, William Steinhardt. \n\nAfter digging and panning a ton and a half of clay along the banks of the Listvenitovyi stream in the Koryak Mountains, eight different grains containing icosahedrite were identified. During subsequent years of study, Steinhardt's team proved that both the sample found in the Florence museum and the samples recovered from the field in Chukotka originated from a meteorite formed 4.5 billion years ago (before there were planets), and landed on the Earth about 15,000 years ago.\n\nMore natural quasicrystals: Further studies revealed other new minerals in the Chukotka samples. In 2014, one of those minerals was discovered to be a crystalline phase of aluminum, nickel and iron (Al38Ni33Fe30). It was accepted by the International Mineralogical Association and named \"steinhardtite\" in Steinhardt's honor\n\nThree more crystalline minerals were also discovered and named after colleagues involved in Steinhardt's quasicrystal research: “hollisterite,” for Princeton petrologist Lincoln Hollister; “kryachkoite,” for Russian geologist Valery Kryachko; and “stolperite,” for Caltech's former provost Ed Stolper. \n\nOther contributions to the field: Steinhardt and his collaborators have made significant contributions to understanding the quasicrystals’ unique mathematical and physical properties , including theories of how and why quasicrystals form and their elastic and hydrodynamics properties. \n\nPeter J. Lu and Steinhardt discovered a quasicrystalline Islamic tiling on the Darb-e Imam Shrine (1453 A.D.) in Isfahan, Iran constructed from girih tiles. In 2007, they deciphered the manner in which early artists created increasingly complex periodic girih patterns. Those early designs were shown to have culminated in the development of a nearly perfect quasi-crystalline pattern five centuries before the discovery of Penrose patterns and the Steinhardt-Levine quasicrystal theory.\n\nSteinhardt's research on quasicrystals and other non-crystalline solids expanded into work on designer materials with novel photonic and phononic properties.\n\nPhotonic quasicrystals: A team of researchers including Steinhardt, Paul Chaikin, Weining Man and Mischa Megens designed and tested the first photonic quasicrystal with icosahedral symmetry in 2005. They were the first to demonstrate the existence of photonic band gaps (\"PBGs\"). These materials block light for a finite range of frequencies (or colors) and let pass light with frequencies outside that band, similar to the way in which a semiconductor blocks electrons for a finite range of energies.\n\nHyperUniform Disordered Solids (HUDS): Working with Salvatore Torquato and Marian Florescu, in 2009 Steinhardt discovered a new class of photonic materials called hyperuniform disordered solids (HUDS), and showed that solids consisting of a hyperuniform disordered arrangement of dielectric elements produce band gaps with perfect spherical symmetry. These materials, which act as isotropic semiconductors for light, can be used to control and manipulate light in a wide range of applications including optical communications, photonic computers, energy harvesting, non-linear optics and improved light sources.\n\nPhoamtonics: In 2019, Steinhardt, along with Michael Klatt and Torquato, introduced the idea of “phoamtonics,” which refers to photonic materials based on foam-like designs. They showed that large photonic bandgaps could arise in network structures created by converting the foam edges (intersections between foam bubbles) to a dielectric material for the two most famous crystalline foam structures, Kelvin foams and Weiare-Phelan foams.\n\nEtaphase Inc.: The meta-material breakthroughs by Steinhardt and his Princeton colleagues have valuable commercial applications. In 2012, the scientists helped create a start-up company called Etaphase, which will apply their discoveries to a wide range of high performance products. The inventions will be used in integrated circuits, structural materials, photonics, communications, chip-to-chip communications, intra-chip communications, sensors, datacomm, networking, and solar applications.\n\nSteinhardt's research in disordered forms of matter has centered on the structure and properties of glasses and amorphous semiconductors, and amorphous metals.\n\nHe constructed the first computer generated continuous random network (CRN) model of glass and amorphous silicon in 1973, while still an undergraduate at Caltech. CRNs remain the leading model of amorphous silicon and other semiconductors today. Working with Richard Alben and D. Weaire, he used the computer model to predict structural and electronic properties.\n\nWorking with David Nelson and Marco Ronchetti, Steinhardt formulated mathematical expressions, known as \"orientational order parameters\", for computing the degree of alignment of interatomic bonds in liquids and solids in 1981. Applying them to computer simulations of monatomic supercooled liquids, they showed that the atoms form arrangements with finite-range icosahedral (soccer-ball like) bond orientational order as liquids cool. \n"}

They are sometimes mistakenly referred to as a \"mujina\", an old Japanese word for a badger or raccoon dog. Although the \"mujina\" can assume the form of the other, \"noppera-bō\" are usually disguised as humans. Such creatures were thought to sometimes transform themselves into \"noppera-bō\" in order to frighten humans. Lafcadio Hearn used the animals' name as the title of his story about faceless monsters, probably resulting in the misused terminology.\n\n\"Noppera-bō\" are known primarily for frightening humans, but are usually otherwise harmless. They appear at first as ordinary human beings, sometimes impersonating someone familiar to the victim, before causing their features to disappear, leaving a blank, smooth sheet of skin where their face should be.\n\nOften, a \"noppera-bō\" would not actually exist, but was the disguise of a \"mujina\", a fox \"kitsune\", or a \"tanuki\". In Showa 4 (1767), in the \"kaidan\" collection \"Shinsetsu Hyakumonogatari\", there were stories that told of how in Nijugawara in Kyoto (near the Nijo-ohashi bridge in the Nakagyō-ku, Kyoto), a monster called \"noppera-bō\" appeared and those that were attacked by it would have several thick hairs attached to their clothing, indicating that it was the disguise of some kind of animal. However, sometimes their real identity is not known, and in the Kanbun 3 (1663) kaidan collection \"Sorori Monogatari\", it was written that in the Oike-cho of the capital (now Nakagyō-ku, Kyoto), there appeared a \"noppera-bō\" with a height of about 7 shaku (about 2.1 meters), but nothing was written about what its true identity was. They are also said to appear in folktales in the Osaka Prefecture and Kotonami, Nakatado District, Kagawa Prefecture among other places.\n\nThis tale recounts a lazy fisherman who decided to fish in the imperial koi ponds near the Heian-kyō palace. Despite being warned by his wife about the pond being sacred and near a graveyard, the fisherman went anyway. On his way to the pond, he is warned by another fisherman not to go there, but he again ignores the warning. Once at the spot, he is met by a beautiful young woman who pleads with him not to fish in the pond. He ignores her and, to his horror, she wipes off her face. Rushing home to hide, he is confronted by what seems to be his wife, who chastises him for his wickedness before wiping off her facial features as well.\n\nThe most famous story recollection of the \"Noppera-bō\" comes from Lafcadio Hearn's book \"\" titled \"Mujina\". The story of a man who travelled along the Akasaka road to Edo, he came across a young woman in a remote location near Kunizaka hill, crying and forlorn. After attempting to console the young woman and offer assistance, she turned to face him, startling him with the blank countenance of a faceless ghost. Frightened, the man proceeded down the road for some time, until he came across a soba vendor. Stopping to relax, the man told the vendor of his tale, only to recoil in horror as the soba vendor stroked his face, becoming a \"noppera-bō\" himself. It turns out that all of these \"noppera-bō\" were really just \"mujina\" in disguise.\n\nThere are other tales about \"noppera-bō\", from a young woman rescued from bandits by a samurai on horseback whose face disappears; to stories of nobles heading out for a tryst with another, only to discover the courtesan is being impersonated by a \"noppera-bō\".\n\nAlthough most tales of \"noppera-bō\" predate the 20th century, there are exceptions, both in Japan itself as well as locations where Japanese have emigrated, most notably the U.S. state of Hawaii.

As of 2016, apparel makes up around two-thirds of the \nbusiness, with furniture and home furnishings, beauty and personal care products, fashion accessories and general merchandising, such as seasonal gifts, constituting the rest.\n\nToday, Li & Fung employs about 22,000 people worldwide. It does product design and development, raw materials and factory sourcing and capacity building, vendor compliance and distribution. It has over 250 offices in 40 markets. It works with 15,000 suppliers to service 8,000 customers.\n\nOn 13 February 2017, it is no longer a constituent of Hang Seng Index.\n\nLi & Fung was founded in 1906 in Guangzhou (Canton) by Fung Pak-liu (d. 1943), an English teacher, and Li To-ming, a local merchant whose family owned a porcelain shop. It started as an export trading company, exporting porcelain, fireworks, jade handicrafts and silk mainly to the United States. Much of its early activity was acting as Comprador a buyer's broker for larger more established American and European clients.\n\nIn 1937, Fung's son Fung Hon-chu opened the company's first branch office outside of mainland China in Hong Kong. It was incorporated later that year in Hong Kong. Li sold his 300 shares of the company in 1946, leaving the company in the hands of the Fung family. In 1951, due to a United Nations trade embargo on China, Hong Kong started manufacturing textiles and plastics. With this change, Li & Fung began exporting garments, toys, wigs and plastic flowers.\n\nBy the early 1970s, Li & Fung's broker role was being squeezed by both manufacturers and importers, the rise of competing Asian Tiger economies as low-cost production locations and major Western retailers engaging directly with Asian suppliers. William and Victor Fung, the sons of Fung Hon-chu, returned from the US to work on modernizing the company. Starting in China and Asia, sources from countries closer to target markets were sought out: Mexico, Honduras and Guatemala, for the US; Turkey, Egypt and Tunisia for Europe.\n\nIn 1973, Li & Fung was listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. In 1988 the Group was privatized and streamlined, incorporated in Bermuda in 1991, and its trading activities were listed on the HKSE in July 1992.\n\nIn 1995, Li & Fung acquired Inchcape Buying Services (formerly known as Dodwell & Co.). It was part of Inchcape plc, a British trading company with a network of offices in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. The acquisition of Inchcape Buying Services expanded the company's customer base while simultaneously shifting its sourcing network beyond East Asia to include the Indian sub-continent, the Mediterranean, and Caribbean basins. Four years later, in 1999, Li & Fung acquired Swire & Maclaine and Camberley.\n\nIn 2000, Li & Fung became a constituent member of the Hang Seng Index and acquired the Colby Group. Bruce Rockowitz joined the company, serving as its CEO and president between 2004 and 2014. The company acquired Bruce Makowsky's fashion business including its flagship brands Kathy Van Zeeland Handbags, B. Makowsky and Tignanello in 2008 for $330 million.\n\nIn 2011, IDS, a member of the Fung Group, was privatized, becoming Li & Fung's logistic business.\n\nIn 2014, Spencer Fung, son of Victor Fung, became CEO and president and the company spun out its global brands and licensing business. Global Brands Group was listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong as a separate entity in July. Li & Fung acquired freight forwarding company China Container Line.\n\nIn 2015, Li & Fung entered into a joint venture with two department store operators in China, Beijing Wangfujing Department Store Group Co Ltd and Shanghai Bailian, with the aim of setting up as many as 300 stores and developing its own private labels.\n\nIn 2016, Li & Fung announced it would sell its non-core distribution business to Dah Chong Hong for $350 million.\n\nWith effect from 6 March 2017, Li & Fung was removed from Hang Seng Constituent Stocks (Blue Chip stock) and replaced by Geely Automobile.\n\nLi & Fung operates a trading and a logistics business.\n\nLi & Fung offers services in product design and development, raw materials and factory sourcing and capacity building, vendor compliance and distribution. It has over 250 offices in 40 markets, connecting some 15,000 suppliers with 8,000 customers through its services.\n\nHistorically, buyers have either purchased fully developed products from domestic importers or overseas traders (Principal Traders) or through their own in-house sourcing teams. Today, buyers source their products via all these channels through the company's trading network either through agency-based sourcing or product-focused services across a wide range of product categories.\n\nIn a typical agency-based sourcing arrangement, a sourcing agent oversees product development, negotiation of price, the locating of factories, procurement of raw materials and components, quality control, factory compliance, order processing and manufacturing control and logistics. In a typical product-focused agreement, a buyer is presented with a collection of product samples for the customer's target market designed and developed by the Principal Agent. The buyer selects a range of samples and negotiates the price with the Principal Trader. Once the order is finalized, the Principal Trader works with its vendor base to produce and deliver the products.\n\nIn 2011, IDS, a member of the Fung Group, was privatized, becoming Li & Fung's logistics network. As of 2015, it has 20.1 million square feet of space and delivers 100 million units of consumer products each day. The company provides distribution center management services, transport management, freight forwarding, omni-channel and order management services.\n\nFollowing the Tazreen Fire in 2012 and Rana Plaza collapse in 2013, global fashion retailers and brands set up the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh, and the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety to improve working conditions in Bangladesh. Li & Fung sits on the advisory board of both bodies. The Accord covers 1,600 factories in Bangladesh and over half of the Bangladeshi garment workforce while the Alliance covers nearly 700 factories and around 1.28 million workers.\n\nLi & Fung is a founding member of the Sustainable Apparel Coalition (SAC) and has been involved in the development of the Higg Index. The Index helps organizations standardize how they measure and evaluate environmental performance of apparel products across the supply chain at the brand, product, and facility levels.\n\nIn 2012, Li & Fung, through the Fung Group, started working with the Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) to train female workers in Bangladeshi factories in the basics of health, nutrition and financial planning. They later extended the HERProject to Cambodia, India and Vietnam.\n\nBetween 2011 and 2014, Li & Fung supported CARE International's Hemaya project. The project targets women working in garment factories in Qualified Industrial Zones (QIZs) around the northern cities of Irbid, Al Mafraq and Az Zarqa, where many textile factories are located. Hemaya is part of a larger effort by CARE Jordan to promote linkages between local employment opportunities and the local female workforce in the face of Jordan's low rate of female participation in the workforce which has one of the lowest in the world.\n\nFollowing the Tazreen Fire in 2012 and Rana Plaza collapse in 2013, attention was drawn to the role of Li & Fung as a supply chain intermediary in factory sourcing and its influence on worker rights and safety. Immediately following the incident, the company formed safety task force composed of engineers and fire safety experts to develop in-house safety improvements of listed factories and became signatories of Accord and Alliance for Safety in Bangladesh RMG.\n\nIn August 2013, The New York Times reported that Li & Fung's \"great bargaining power\" allowed it to pressure suppliers and manufacturers to lower costs, often utilizing a \"take it or leave it\" approach when it made an offer. Critics said that factories would cut corners in order to meet the offer. The article also said that Li & Fung had been tied to labor violations and had been accused by activists of depressing wages in developing countries and failing to investigate factory conditions. \nIn December 2014, a Clark University paper criticized the company's network of suppliers as a \"dispersion\" strategy that was contradictory to worker safety. The paper concluded that this strategy prevented workers from obtaining a living wage and would always encourage buyers to use factories based in countries with weak government enforcement of regulation.\n\nIn his chapter entitled \"Li & Fung, Ltd.: An agent of global production\" (2001), Cheng used Li & Fung Ltd. as a case study in the international production fragmentation trade theory through which producers in different countries are allocated a specialized slice or segment of the value chain of the global production. Allocations are determined based on \"technical feasibility\" and the ability to keep the lowest final price possible for each product.\n\nIn his chapter on platforms in the report \"\"Business ecosystems come of age\"\" (2015), John Hagel III uses Li & Fung as an example of a \"pull platform\" that connects participants with the \"capabilities of others and make them available to their customers in ways that create significant value for platform participants and customers.\" He writes that pull platforms are scalable and instead of becoming \"unwieldy with greater numbers of participants, they become only more capable and valuable.\" He says pull platforms are important owing to two factors: digitization and globalization. Although companies have seen the benefits in terms of lean manufacturing and inventory management, within well defined supply chains, the real potential of the pull-based approach has yet to be realized.\n\n\n"}

Apparent gains following the fourth and fifth rounds were reversed by outside events. Five rounds of talks from 2003 to 2007 produced little net progress until the third phase of the fifth round of talks, when North Korea agreed to shut down its nuclear facilities in exchange for fuel aid and steps towards the normalization of relations with the United States and Japan. Responding angrily to the United Nations Security Council's Presidential Statement issued on April 13, 2009 that condemned the North Korean failed satellite launch, the DPRK declared on April 14, 2009 that it would pull out of Six Party Talks and that it would resume its nuclear enrichment program in order to boost its nuclear deterrent.

The pressure was due to international belief that the satellite launch was in fact a test of ICBM technology. The launch was a failure, and it landed in the Pacific Ocean. Despite the failure, U.S. President Barack Obama responded that \"violations must be punished.\" South Korea urged heavier sanctions against North Korea. On April 13, the United Nations Security Council agreed unanimously to a Presidential Statement that condemned North Korea for the launch and stated the Council's intention to expand sanctions on North Korea. The following day, North Korea, responding angrily to the UN Security Council's resolution, said that it \"will never again take part in such [six party] talks and will not be bound by any agreement reached at the talks.\" North Korea expelled nuclear inspectors from the country and also informed the International Atomic Energy Agency that they would resume their nuclear weapons program.\n\nOn May 25, 2009, North Korea detonated a nuclear device underground. The test was condemned by the United Nations, NATO, the other five members of the Six-party talks, and many other countries worldwide.. On October 11, 2011, South Korea appointed a new envoy to the Six-party talks; Lim Sung-Nam, who worked for the Ministry of Tourism and Sport beforehand.\n\nOn November 10, 2009, the Battle of Daecheong happened. On this date North and South Korean ships exchanged fire. The Southern vessel was almost unharmed while the North reportedly sustained heavy casualties.\n\n\"Cheonan\", a South Korean patrol vessel with 104 people aboard, sank after an unexplained explosion tore through its hull while conducting a normal mission in the vicinity of Baengnyeong Island at 9:22 p.m. on March 26, 2010. An investigation conducted by an international team of experts from South Korea, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and Sweden concluded that \"Cheonan\" was sunk by a torpedo launched by a North Korean Yeono class miniature submarine. This incident caused rising tension and antagonism between North and South Korea.\n\nOn October 26, 2010, Red Cross officials of North Korea and South Korea hold meeting to discuss ways of further family reunions, but failed to reach agreement. So did UNC and North Korea, failing to arrange higher-level meeting.\n\nOn November 23, 2010, North Korea shelled South Korea's Yeonpyeong Island. Two South Korean soldiers were killed and a dozen injured after North Korea fired dozens of artillery shells onto a South Korean island setting more than 60 houses ablaze and sending civilians fleeing. These two incidents stood in the way of holding six-party talks during this period.\n\nOn 29 February 2012, the United States and North Korea announced a \"leap day\" agreement that the U.S. would provide substantial food aid in return for the North agreeing to a moratorium on uranium enrichment and missile testing and a return of IAEA inspectors to Yongbyon, leading to a resumption of the six-party talks. On 16 March 2012, North Korea announced it was planning to launch a satellite to commemorate the late founder Kim il-Sung's 100th birthday, drawing condemnation by the other five participants in the Six-Party Talks, casting doubt on the \"leap day\" agreement. On 6 April 2012, North Korea's satellite failed to enter into orbit, and was declared a failure by the United States and South Korea. In addition, the launch was described as a provocative test of missile technology, and the United States subsequently announced the suspension of food aid to North Korea.\n\nOn 29January 2014, the official Chinese Xinhua News Agency announced on Twitter that the DPRK ambassador to China had received DPRK agreement on resumption of the six-party talks and called on the United States to fulfill its related obligations.\n\nOn April 5, 2018, China's paramount leader Xi Jinping announced that after a meeting with North Korea's supreme leader Kim Jong-Un that Kim is willing to resume talks. Further updates are pending.\n\nOn April 25, 2019 after his first meeting with Kim Jong-un, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that he believed any U.S. guarantees might need to be supported by the other nations involved in previous six-way talks on the nuclear issue. Putin promised to brief the Chinese and U.S. leadership about his talks.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1982061", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1982061", "title": "Will.i.am", "text": "Will.i.am\n\nWilliam Adams (born William James Adams Jr.; March 15, 1975), better known by his stage name will.i.am (pronounced ‘Will-I-am’), is an American rapper, songwriter, record producer, DJ, actor and television personality. He is the founding and lead member of the hip hop group the Black Eyed Peas.\n\nAs a solo artist, will.i.am has released four solo albums, beginning with \"Lost Change\", released in 2001 through Atlantic Records. His second solo outing, \"Must B 21\", was released on September 23, 2003. The track \"Go!\" was regularly used as the theme for the \"NBA Live 2005\" and \"Madden NFL 2005\" seasons. The third album, \"Songs About Girls\", was released on September 25, 2007. He released his fourth studio album, \"#willpower\", in 2013.\n\nAs a music producer, will.i.am has produced music for other artists including Cheryl, Michael Jackson, Justin Bieber, Kesha, Britney Spears, Miley Cyrus, David Guetta, U2, Rihanna, Lady Gaga, Usher, Justin Timberlake, A. R. Rahman, Nicki Minaj, 2NE1, and Baby Kaely. In collaborations and with the Black Eyed Peas, he has a total of 41 top-40 entries on the UK Singles Chart since 1998, and has sold 9.4 million singles in the UK.\n\nIn addition to his music career, will.i.am has also been a judge and mentor on the television talent show series \"The Voice UK\" (2012–present), \"The Voice Australia\" (2014), and \"The Voice Kids\" (2017-present).\n\nWilliam James Adams was born in Eastside Los Angeles, and was raised in the Estrada Courts housing projects in the Boyle Heights neighborhood, where he and his family were among the few African Americans living in a predominantly Hispanic community. Adams has never met his father, William Adams Sr. He was raised by his mother, Debra (née Cain), who encouraged him to be unique and to avoid conforming to the tendencies of the other youths in the east Los Angeles neighborhood. To encourage his musical career, she sent him to public schools in affluent West Los Angeles. While attending John Marshall High School, he became best friends with Allan Pineda (stage name apl.de.ap), who would also be a future member of the Black Eyed Peas. While still in high school, Adams and Pineda performed in East L.A. clubs and were soon joined by three other entertainers to form the socially conscious rap group, Atban Klann. Atban Klann caught the eye of Compton rapper Eazy-E and was signed to his label, Ruthless Records in 1992.\n\nAdams used to attend raves while in high school. He later said his history with rave culture is why he chose a more electro sound for the Black Eyed Peas' albums \"The E.N.D.\" and \"The Beginning\". Despite the use of electro and house music elements, will.i.am prefers to separate the underground from pop. In an article with \"Los Angeles Times\", he mentions that secrecy over the whereabouts of raves is what made \"raving\" special, and different from the mainstream.\n\nIn the summer of 1988 will.i.am began his music career when, as an eighth-grader, he met up with fellow rapper Allan Pineda (apl.de.ap) and fellow student Dante Santiago. They began performing together around Los Angeles and were soon discovered by rapper/entrepreneur Eazy-E, who signed them to his label Ruthless Records in 1992. At the time, Will was known as \"Will 1X\". Atban Klann's first ever official track, \"Merry Muthafuckin' Xmas\", was included on Eazy-E's EP \"\". After this, the trio began recording an album, \"Grass Roots\", with the help of producers Mookie Mook and DJ Motiv8, but the album was never released due to Eazy-E's death in 1995. After Eazy's tragic death, they changed their name to Black Eyed Pods, and Will replaced Dante with Jaime Gomez, better known under his stage name of Taboo. In 1997, they once again changed their name, this time to the Black Eyed Peas, and began recording their first album, \"Behind the Front\", with the help of soul singer Kim Hill. They were soon signed to Interscope Records, and released their debut single, \"Joints & Jam\", in early 1998. The album was successful enough for the group's contract to be renewed, and in 2000, a second album, \"Bridging the Gap\", was released.\n\nFollowing the release of \"Bridging the Gap\", Will began recording his first solo release, \"Lost Change\", which was the official soundtrack to the film of the same name. Featuring collaborations with Medusa, Planet Asia and Terry Dexter, the album was a critical success.\n\nIn November 2001, work began on a third Black Eyed Peas album, \"Elephunk\". Development of the album began on November 2, 2001 and was released just under two years later in 2003. At the time of development, only will.i.am, apl.de.ap and Taboo were to feature on the album. During the production of \"Shut Up\" (the second single released from the album), they realized that a female vocal would work well with the song. Originally, Nicole Scherzinger (lead singer of the Pussycat Dolls) was approached to make a guest appearance on the record. She was forced to decline because she already was signed to a contract with Eden's Crush. Danté Santiago then introduced Fergie to will.i.am, who was impressed with her vocal talents. She immediately formed a bond with the band and became a permanent member of the Peas and her photo was printed onto the album cover. Nine out of the fourteen tracks were composed by lyricist Robbie Fisher, who has been working closely with the band since the beginning stages of the album. In the United States, \"Elephunk\" reached number 14 on the \"Billboard Top 200\" and is their first album to chart in the top 15. It gained even more commercial success in the UK Album Charts where it reached number 3. It has sold over 1.6 million copies in the UK and 8.5 million copies worldwide. The singles \"Where Is the Love?\" and \"Shut Up\" reached number 1. \"Hey Mama\" has been used for several advertisements including advertisements for Apple and iTunes. \"Let's Get It Started\" also received universal acclaim in the media section where a cover version of the song appears in the film \"Hot Tub Time Machine\". After the success of \"Elephunk\", the Peas were approached by EA games to feature some of their music on the 2004 game \"\". They remixed some of the tracks on Elephunk and translated it into Simlish and created new tracks for the game. They also feature in the game as playable characters.\n\nThe group released their breakthrough single, \"Where Is the Love?\", in November 2002 (featuring Justin Timberlake, although he did not appear in the video). On the strength of that single and follow-up singles like \"Shut Up\", \"Elephunk\" went on to sell 8.5 million copies worldwide. During this time, Will recorded a second solo album, \"Must B 21\". In 2002, Will recorded the song \"Secrets\" for the soundtrack to \"\", a musical accompaniment to the Cartoon Network original series. Prior to this, he had also composed the theme music for another Genndy Tartakovsky series, \"Samurai Jack\".\n\nIn November 2003, work began on a fourth Black Eyed Peas album, entitled \"Monkey Business\", the second album with new band member Fergie. Upon the success of \"Monkey Business\", which was released in 2005, the album was certified three times Platinum by the RIAA in the U.S. and has sold over 10 million copies worldwide. The Canadian Recording Industry Association (or CRIA) has certified \"Monkey Business\" 6x Platinum, with sales of over 600,000 copies. The Australian Recording Industry Association (or ARIA) has also certified \"Monkey Business\" 6x Platinum, denoting sales of over 420,000 copies. The album's tracks earned the group four 2006 Grammy Award nominations and they also won the Grammy for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for \"Don't Phunk with My Heart\". According to IFPI, over 2 million copies have been sold in Europe. In the UK alone, it has sold over 1 million copies, although this is significantly lower than their sales of \"Elephunk\", which stand at over 1.6 million copies and 10 million worldwide.\nthe band announced they were going to take a break to focus on their own personal projects. Will went on to produce Ferguson's first solo album, \"The Dutchess\", which was released in 2006, before beginning work with Michael Jackson, who had requested Will's expertise for the recording and production of his new album. Work began on the Jackson album in 2006, and continued until the singer's death in 2009, at which point will.i.am revealed that none of the material recorded during the period would be released. However, remixes recorded for Jackson's \"Thriller 25\" anniversary album were released in 2008.\n\nIn 2007, will.i.am announced that he had co-created an all-female soul band entitled the Paradiso Girls, who he intended to work with on an upcoming solo project. The album, \"Songs About Girls\", was released in 2007. The album spawned three singles, \"I Got It From My Mama\", \"One More Chance\" and \"Heartbreaker\", and fared slightly better than his previous solo efforts, however, failed to shift more than 75,000 copies.

{"id": "1982071", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1982071", "title": "Lola (song)", "text": "Lola (song)\n\n\"Lola\" is a song written by Ray Davies and performed by English rock band the Kinks on their album \"Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One\". The song details a romantic encounter between a young man and a possible transvestite, whom he meets in a club in Soho, London. In the song, the narrator describes his confusion towards Lola, who \"walked like a woman but talked like a man\". Although Ray Davies claims that the incident was inspired by a true encounter experienced by the band's manager, alternative explanations for the song have been given by drummer Mick Avory.\n\nThe song was released in the United Kingdom on 12 June 1970, while in the United States it was released on 28 June 1970. Commercially, the single reached number two on the UK Singles Chart and number nine on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Due to its controversial subject matter and use of the brand name Coca-Cola, the single received backlash and even bans in Britain and Australia. The single version (mono) used the words \"cherry cola\" while the album version (stereo) uses the name \"Coca-Cola\". The track has since become one of The Kinks' most iconic and popular songs, later being ranked number 422 on \"Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" as well as number 473 on the \"NME's 500 Greatest Songs Of All Time\" list.\n\nSince its release, \"Lola\" has appeared on multiple compilation and live albums. In 1980, a live version of the song from the album \"One for the Road\" was released as a single in the US and some European countries, becoming a minor hit. In the Netherlands it became #1, just as in 1970 with the studio version. Other versions include live renditions from 1972's \"Everybody's in Show-Biz\" and 1996's \"To the Bone\". The \"Lola\" character also made an appearance in the lyrics of the band's 1981 song, \"Destroyer\".\n\nRay Davies has claimed that he was inspired to write \"Lola\" after Kinks manager Robert Wace spent a night in Paris dancing with a transvestite. Davies said of the incident, \"In his apartment, Robert had been dancing with this black woman, and he said, 'I'm really onto a thing here.' And it was okay until we left at six in the morning and then I said, 'Have you seen the stubble?' He said 'Yeah', but he was too pissed [intoxicated] to care, I think\".\n\nDrummer Mick Avory has offered an alternative explanation for the song's lyrics, claiming that \"Lola\" was partially inspired by Avory's frequenting of transvestite bars in west London. Avory said, \"We used to know this character called Michael McGrath. He used to hound the group a bit, because being called The Kinks did attract these sorts of people. He used to come down to \"Top of the Pops\", and he was publicist for John Stephen's shop in Carnaby Street. He used to have this place in Earl's Court, and he used to invite me to all these drag queen acts and transsexual pubs. They were like secret clubs. And that's where Ray [Davies] got the idea for 'Lola'. When he was invited too, he wrote it while I was getting drunk\".\n\nDespite claims that the song was written about a supposed date between Ray Davies and Candy Darling, Davies has since claimed this rumour to be false, saying that the two only went out to dinner together and that he had known the whole time that Darling was trans.\n\nIn his autobiography, Dave Davies said that he came up with the music for what would become \"Lola\", noting that brother Ray added the lyrics after hearing it. In a 1990 interview, Dave Davies stated that \"Lola\" was written in a similar fashion to \"You Really Got Me\" in that the two worked on Ray's basic skeleton of the song, saying that the song was more of a collaborative effort than many believed.\n\nWritten in April 1970, \"Lola\" was cited by Ray Davies as the first song he wrote following a break he took to act in the 1970 Play for Today film \"The Long Distance Piano Player\". Davies said that he had initially struggled with writing an opening that would sell the song, but the rest of the song \"came naturally\".\n\nInitial recordings of the song began in April 1970, but, as the band's bassist John Dalton remembered, recording for \"Lola\" took particularly long, stretching into the next month. During April, four to five versions were attempted, utilizing different keys as well as varying beginnings and styles. In May, new piano parts were added to the backing track by John Gosling, the band's new piano player that had just been auditioned. Vocals were also added at this time. The song was then mixed during that month. Mick Avory remembered the recording sessions for the song positively, saying that it \"was fun, as it was the Baptist's [John Gosling's] first recording with us\".\n\nThe guitar opening on the song was produced as a result of combining the sound of a Martin guitar and a vintage Dobro resonating guitar. Ray Davies cited this blend of guitar sounds for the song's unique guitar sound.\n\nDespite the chart success \"Lola\" would achieve, its fellow \"Lola vs. Powerman\" track \"Powerman\" was initially considered to be the first single from the album. However, \"Lola\", which Ray Davies later claimed was an attempt to write a hit, was eventually decided on as the debut single release.\n\n\"Lola\" was released as a single in 1970. In the UK, the B-side to the single was \"the Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society\" outtake \"Berkeley Mews\" while the Dave Davies-penned \"Mindless Child of Motherhood\" was used in the US. It became an unexpected chart smash for the Kinks, reaching number two in Britain and number nine in the United States. The single also saw success worldwide, reaching the top of the charts in Ireland, New Zealand, and South Africa, as well as the top 5 in Germany, Austria, Belgium, and Switzerland. The success of the single had important ramifications for the band's career at a critical time, allowing them to negotiate a new contract with RCA Records, construct their own London Studio, and assume more creative and managerial control. In a 1970 interview, Dave Davies stated that, if \"Lola\" had been a failure, the band would have \"gone on making records for another year or so and then drifted apart\".\n\nAlthough the track was a major hit for the band, Dave Davies did not enjoy the success of \"Lola\", saying, \"In fact, when 'Lola' was a hit, it made me feel a bit uncomfortable. Because it was taking us out of a different sort of comfort zone, where we'd been getting into the work, and the writing and the musicality was more thought about. It did have that smell of: 'Oh blimey, not that again.' I found it a bit odd, that period. And then it got odder and weirder\". Mick Avory said that he \"enjoyed the success\" the band had with \"Lola\" and its follow-up, \"Apeman\".\n\nOriginally, \"Lola\" saw controversy for its lyrics. In a \"Record Mirror\" article entitled \"Sex Change Record: Kink Speaks\", Ray Davies addressed the matter, saying, \"It really doesn't matter what sex Lola is, I think she's alright\". Some radio stations would fade the track out before implications of Lola's biological sex were revealed. On 18 November 1970, \"Lola\" was banned from being played by some radio stations in Australia because of its \"controversial subject matter\".\n\nThe BBC banned the track for a different reason. The original song recorded in stereo had the words \"Coca-Cola\" in the lyrics, but because of BBC Radio's policy against product placement, Ray Davies was forced to make a 6000-mile round-trip flight from New York to London and back on June 3, 1970, interrupting the band's American tour, to change those words to the generic \"cherry cola\" for the single release, which is included on various compilation albums as well.\n\n\"Lola\" received positive reviews from critics. Upon the single's release, the \"NME\" praised the song as \"an engaging and sparkling piece with a gay Latin flavour and a catchy hook chorus\". Writing a contemporary review in \"Creem\", critic Dave Marsh recognized it as \"the first significantly blatant gay-rock ballad\". \"Billboard\" said of the song at the time of its US release, \"Currently a top ten British chart winner, this infectious rhythm item has all the ingredients to put the Kinks right back up the Hot 100 here with solid impact\". \"Rolling Stone\" critic Paul Gambaccini called the song \"brilliant and a smash\". Music critic Robert Christgau, despite his mixed opinion on the \"Lola vs. Powerman\" album, praised the single as \"astounding\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic lauded the song for \"its crisp, muscular sound, pitched halfway between acoustic folk and hard rock\". \"Ultimate Classic Rock\" ranked \"Lola\" as The Kinks' third best song, saying \"the great guitar riff that feeds the song is one of Dave's all-time greatest\". \"Paste Magazine\" listed the track as the band's fourth best song.\n\nThe song was also well-liked by the band. Mick Avory, who noted the song as one of the songs he was most proud to be associated with, said \"I always liked 'Lola', I liked the subject. It's not like anything else. I liked it for that. We'd always take a different path\". In a 1983 interview, Ray Davies said, \"I'm just very pleased I recorded it and more pleased I wrote it\". The band revisited the \"Lola\" character in the lyrics of their 1981 song, \"Destroyer\", a minor chart hit in America.\n\nSatirical artist \"Weird Al\" Yankovic created a parody of the song called \"Yoda\", featuring lyrics about the \"Star Wars\" character of the same name, on his 1985 album \"Dare to Be Stupid\".\n\nSince its release, \"Lola\" became a mainstay in The Kinks' live repertoire, appearing in the majority of the band's subsequent set-lists until the group's break-up. In 1972, a live performance of the song recorded at Carnegie Hall in New York City appeared on the live half of the band's 1972 album, \"Everybody's in Show-Biz\", a double-LP which contained half new studio compositions and half live versions of previously released songs.\n\nA live version of \"Lola\", recorded on 23 September 1979 in Providence, Rhode Island, was released as a single in the US in July 1980 to promote the live album \"One for the Road\". The B-side was the live version of \"Celluloid Heroes\". The single was a moderate success, reaching number 81 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. It was also released in some countries in Europe (although not the UK) in April 1981. It topped the charts in both the Netherlands, matching the number one peak of the original version, and in Belgium, where it exceeded the original's peak of three. It also charted in Australia, peaking at number 69 and spending 22 weeks on the charts. Although not released as a stand-alone single in the UK, it was included on a bonus single (backed with a live version of \"David Watts\" from the same album) with initial copies of \"Better Things\" in June 1981. This live rendition, along with the live versions of \"Celluloid Heroes\" and \"You Really Got Me\" from the same album, also appeared on the 1986 compilation album \"Come Dancing with The Kinks: The Best of the Kinks 1977–1986\".\n\nAlthough it did not appear on the original 1994 version, another live version of \"Lola\" was included on the 1996 US double-album release of \"To the Bone\", the band's final release of new material before their dissolution.\n\n1970 studio version\n\n1980 live version\n\n\n"}

It was an international hit, the first and most successful single from their album \"Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too\". It reached number 30 on \"Billboard\" Hot 100 Airplay in January 1999, number 36 on the overall Hot 100 and number eight on the \"Billboard\" Modern Rock chart. It also reached number five in the United Kingdom, number four in Ireland, and number one in Canada and New Zealand.\n\nMuch of the media attention \"You Get What You Give\" received centered on the closing lyrics:\n\nAccording to lead singer Gregg Alexander, he had written this section for the song as a test to see whether the media would focus on the important political issues of the first few lines, or the petty celebrity-dissing. As suspected, a considerable amount of press began to appear about the name-dropping, and the other political issues were largely ignored.\n\nMarilyn Manson commented that he was \"not mad he said he'd kick my ass, I just don't want to be used in the same sentence with Courtney Love... I'll crack his [Alexander's] skull open if I see him.\" Beck reported that Alexander personally apologized for the line when they met each other by chance in a supermarket, claiming that it was never meant to be personal. Alexander collaborated with Hanson, whose drummer, Zac Hanson, called him \"a bit of a character, but a cool guy.\"\n\nAlthough the lines were used for the band's \"Top of the Pops\" appearance, it was truncated at \"kick you\".\n\nIn a \"Time\" interview, U2 lead guitarist The Edge is quoted saying \"You Get What You Give\" is the song he is \"most jealous of. I really would love to have written that.\" \"Billboard\" gave a mixed review, saying that it was a \"chugging, Wham!-style pop song with slightly cheesy lyrics\" but that the ending lyrics were \"interesting\".\n\nThe song was listed No. 440 on \"Blender\"'s list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born\".\n\nThe song is an unofficial Newcastle United anthem and is regularly played at their home ground St James' Park. The song was used by local radio station Metro Radio during Newcastle's FA cup-run of 1998–99, with Mick Lowes' commentary of Newcastle's cup goals mixed over the song.\n\nIn the liner notes to her 2004 compilation \"Artist's Choice\", Joni Mitchell praises \"You Get What You Give\" for \"rising from the swamp of 'McMusic' like a flower of hope.\" Michelle Branch, Lulu, The Okay Feeling, and Martin Fry have covered this song live in concert. It was also performed by the final 13 of \"Australian Idol\" 2005 and 2006. Both times the controversial \"Health insurance...\" section was omitted.\n\nLMC released a remix of this song sampling the original Alexander vocals as \"LMC vs. New Radicals\" in 2005, under the title \"Don't Let Go\". Another remix entitled \"You Get What You Give\" was released in 2006, this time with a re-recorded vocal performance by Rachel McFarlane. \"You Get What You Give\" charted at No. 30 in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 2006, Ice-T was asked on \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\" about what he has heard, besides rap music, in the last few years that really grabbed him and his only reply was \"You Get What You Give\".\n\nThe song was used on the soundtrack of the 2006 film \"Click\", which starred Adam Sandler.\n\n\"You Get What You Give\" is also featured in the soundtrack of the 2007 animated film \"Surf's Up\" and on the 2019 TV series \"Schooled\".\n\nThe music video for \"You Get What You Give\" was filmed in the Staten Island Mall in New York and directed by Evan Bernard. The New Radicals' frontman Gregg Alexander said he chose this setting because he sees the shopping mall as a metaphor for society—a fake, controlled environment engineered to encourage spending. The video showed a group of teenagers, led by Alexander, going through the mall wreaking havoc—tossing nets on security guards, placing businessmen in animal cages, knocking over merchandise, hijacking Lambrettas, and moshing in the food court.\n\nIn 2002, VH1 voted it as the 64th greatest one-hit wonder of all time. In 2007, the song was voted No. 90 on VH1's \"100 Greatest Songs of the 90s\", and in 2010 it was number 106 on \"Pitchfork\"'s \"Top 200 Tracks of the 90s\". In 2011, VH1 ranked it as 11th on \"40 Greatest One-Hit Wonders of the 90s\". Annie Zaleski for \"The A.V. Club\" wrote that the song was \"surprisingly influential on popular music, just in a non-obvious, almost obscured way\", and that it was \"both a nostalgic artifact and a song that transcends any era\". BBC Radio ranked the song at number 38 on its list of the \"Most Heard Recordings in Britain of the Last 75 Years\".\n\n\n\nTwo live recordings of \"You Get What You Give\" were officially released:\n\nAlso there are three MP3's circulating:\n\n"}

Johann Nepomuk Hummel, who was Haydn's successor as Kapellmeister to the Esterházy family, also composed a Trumpet Concerto for Weidinger; this was originally written in the key of E major, but it is often played in the key of E flat major.

It was previously part of Sunnybank, until the suburb was named in 1967.\n\nThe suburb is in three main parts, divided by the six-lane Kessels Road, and separately, Mimosa Creek. Most residential buildings are single and two-storey beige brick houses with a tiled roof.\n\nThere appears to be no specific naming convention for the roads. Streets on the eastern part of the suburb include a mixture of plant (Freesia, Galliardia) and Scottish (Blairgowrie, Carnoustie) names. On the south-west portion, Angelina and Damson are plum cultivars, Elberta a type of peach, and Jonathan may refer to a type of apple, being some of the agricultural produce that may have been grown in the area before urbanisation.\n\nPreviously part of Sunnybank, the suburb was named by the Queensland Place Names Board on 1 August 1967. The suburb of MacGregor was named after Scottish-born Sir William MacGregor who was the Governor of Queensland from 1909 until 1914.

{"id": "1982094", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1982094", "title": "Natural trumpet", "text": "Natural trumpet\n\nA natural trumpet is a valveless brass instrument that is able to play the notes of the harmonic series.\n\nThe natural trumpet was used as a military instrument to facilitate communication (e.g. break camp, retreat, etc.).\n\nEven before the late Baroque period the natural trumpet had been accepted into Western art music. There is evidence, for example, of extensive use of trumpet ensembles in Venetian ceremonial music of the 16th century. Although neither Andrea nor Giovanni Gabrieli wrote music specifically for the trumpet, they would have been very familiar with its technical possibilities.\n\nLater, talented players such as the early baroque composer Girolamo Fantini demonstrated that by playing in the extreme upper register and \"lipping\" the notes of the 11th and 13th harmonics (that is, flattening or sharpening those impure harmonics into tune with the embouchure), it was possible to play diatonic major and minor scales (and, hence, actual melodies rather than arpeggios) on a natural trumpet. The most talented players were even able to produce certain chromatic notes outside the harmonic series by this process (such as lipping a natural C down to B), although these notes were mostly used as brief passing tones. (In Germany, this technique was called \"Heruntertreiben\", literally \"driving down\".) Other \"impure\" harmonics (such as the 7th and 14th – B on an instrument pitched in C – which are very flat) were avoided by most composers, but were sometimes deliberately used, for example, where their unusual sonic qualities would complement the accompanying text in a sacred work.\n\nBaroque composers – such as Antonio Vivaldi, Georg Philipp Telemann, George Frideric Handel and Johann Sebastian Bach – made frequent use of trumpets in sacred, orchestral, and even solo works. Many of these trumpet parts are technically quite difficult to play on a natural instrument, and were often written with a specific virtuoso performer in mind, such as Gottfried Reiche (Bach's chief trumpeter and the subject of a famous painting of the era) or Valentine Snow, for whom Handel composed some of his more noted trumpet parts. Indeed, highly skilled trumpeters were a prized commodity in the era, held in high esteem and avidly sought after by musical patrons.\n\nThe vast majority of baroque trumpet parts were written for a natural instrument pitched in C or D, although there were occasional exceptions. J. S. Bach, for example, calls for a trumpet in B in his Cantatas Nos. 5 and 90, trumpets in E in the first version of his Magnificat and, most famously, the solo trumpet in high F in his Brandenburg Concerto No. 2. In the 18th century various attempts were made to overcome the limitations in the notes available to natural trumpets. As early as the time of Bach, crooks (additional lengths of tubing) were introduced between the mouthpiece and the body which lowered the pitch of the instrument and allowed it to be used in a variety of keys. In the latter part of the 18th century side holes covered with keys and a sliding mechanism were tried. Later Anton Weidinger, court trumpeter in Vienna, invented a 5-key trumpet. These experiments were not completely successful, however, since side holes, which work well on instruments with a conical bore, such as cornets and bugles, cause a muffled sound in those with a cylindrical bore.\n\nNatural trumpets continued to be used through the Classical era and even into the early Romantic period. But changing musical styles along with a growing dearth of sufficiently capable players spelled an end to the high, florid, complicated parts typical of baroque music. A few transitional composers, such as Michael Haydn, Leopold Mozart and Johann Molter, wrote concerti for natural trumpets in the early Classical era. In fact, it could be argued that the concertos of Haydn and Molter represent the zenith of the natural trumpet in terms of technical demands, containing as they do some of the highest notes ever penned for the trumpet in symphonic works (in the case of Haydn, a G above high C – the 24th harmonic on a natural instrument). However, for many decades following, most orchestral trumpet writing consisted of basic harmonic support (what many trumpeters derisively refer to as \"thumps and bumps\") and fanfare-like passages, with very little in the way of melody. There were a few notable exceptions, such as Mozart's Symphony No. 39 in E major, where the trumpets intone the main theme of the opening movement; Haydn's Symphony No. 103 in E-flat major (\"Drum Roll\"), where the trumpets often outline the melody in all four movements; or Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 in which the trumpets double the melody of the famous \"Ode to Joy\" in the finale of the work.\n\nAfter the brief attempt at developing a keyed trumpet, the instrument for which Joseph Haydn and Johann Nepomuk Hummel wrote their famous concerti, the development of the more versatile valve trumpet (c. 1815) spelled the eventual demise of the natural trumpet in Western music, until its resurrection in the 20th century. Throughout the first half of the 19th century, the valveless, natural trumpet and the valved trumpet (also the cornet) vied for position in the orchestra, with the valved trumpet establishing a permanent position only in the second half. Even as late as 1843, for example, Wagner was writing for valveless trumpets in his opera \"The Flying Dutchman\".\nIn modern-day performances of Baroque and Classical works by period orchestras, the trumpets used are usually slightly altered copies of natural instruments of the period, with the addition of anachronistic nodal \"tone holes\" (also called \"venting holes\") used to more easily and accurately correct the intonation of the instrument. (There is a growing consensus to refer to these instruments as \"baroque trumpets\" to distinguish them from pure \"natural trumpets\".) The use of finger holes on reconstructions of natural trumpets is traceable to Otto Steinkopf, who early in the 20th century discovered holes on a few museum originals. However, it appears that these holes were usually placed at \"antinodes\", and thus designed to prevent the note from sounding, rather than allowing it to be played in tune.\n\nWhile modern reconstructions with nodal finger holes may not be completely authentic in comparison with the originals, they nevertheless allow a close approximation of the sound of the natural trumpet (and its ability to more easily blend with other instruments in an ensemble) without the \"quirks\" of intonation to which modern ears are unaccustomed. Though such vented instruments have been the norm in period orchestras for decades, in recent years ensembles such as La Petite Bande and soloists such as Jean-François Madeuf have been performing and recording using pure natural trumpets.\n\nIn conventional (non-period) orchestras, the highest baroque trumpet parts are usually played on the modern piccolo trumpet, an instrument that provides firm support of range, attack and intonation, while producing a brighter sound – very different from the natural trumpet the composers had in mind.\nThe natural trumpet is differentiated from another valveless brass instrument, the bugle, in that it is nearly twice the length. This places the higher harmonics (from the 8th harmonic up, which are closer together in pitch) in a playable range, enabling the performance of diatonic melodies. The bugle, by contrast, is only useful for performing simple fanfares and military calls (such as \"Taps\") in a lower range (normally only utilizing the 2nd through 6th harmonics), based on the notes of a major triad (for example, the notes B, D, and F on a bugle pitched in B).\n\nSome of the finest surviving examples of trumpets date back as far as the 1580s, and were made by Anton Schnitzer of Nuremberg. Other notable trumpet makers include the Hainlein family of Nuremberg, the Haas family of Nuremberg, the Ehe family of Nuremberg, and William Bull of London. All of these instrument makers built what are now called natural trumpets. During the period, however, these instruments were simply called trumpets.\n\nInstruments based on historical instruments are made by modern makers such as Matthew Parker, Norbert Neubauer, Graham Nicholson, Markus Raquet, Geert Jan van der Heide, Cristian Bosc and Frank Tomes as well as Adolf Egger, along with his son Rainer Egger.\n\nThe natural trumpet has a mouthpiece, which is inserted into the receiver. The receiver is attached to the long tubing, called the first yard, with a short connector, called a ferrule. The first yard is connected with a ferrule to the first bow, followed by another ferrule and the second yard. The second yard is attached with a ferrule to the second bow. On the baroque trumpet, the vent holes are located at the top of the second yard, and possibly on the second bow. After the second bow are the bellpipe, the ball, the bell, garland, and bezel. The bellpipe and first yard are separated by a wood block, and over that there is a cord for binding.\n\nNotable living players of the natural trumpet include Don Smithers and Jean-François Madeuf. Living players of the Baroque trumpet include Robert Farley, Anna Freeman, Alison Balsom,\nCrispian Steele-Perkins, Friedemann Immer, Niklas Eklund, David Blackadder, Will Wroth and John Thiessen.\n\n\n"}

In the , Sunnybank had a population of 8,697 people.\n\nSunnybank is known for its high level of Asian population and the Asian shops and restaurants in the area.\n\nThe Jagera Indigenous people were the first to inhabit the area well over 20,000 years ago. Early settlers noticed that the Sunnybank district had good rainfall and a beautiful loamy soil, somewhat sandy in character, that produced beautiful displays of natural wild flowers. From the mid-19th century it developed into a farming area with prosperous fruit and poultry farms and gardens of every kind.\n\nThe Town of Sunnybank in the 19th century was part of a much larger area known as the Parish of Yeerongpilly, but a distinct town outside of the area known as Brisbane. In 1885, the railway line was extended from Yeerongpilly, and names had to be given to the railway stations along the line. Sunnybank got its name from a local farm, Sunnybrae, owned by the Gillespies, when of land were taken over for the railway. \"Brae\" is Scottish for the English word \"bank\", so the area was given boundaries and named Sunnybank.\n\nThe present suburb much reduced in size from the previous suburb of Sunnybank. The separate town of Sunnybank was absorbed into the City of Brisbane in 1925. This older Sunnybank area is still known locally as Sunnybank. Rolling hills and the headwaters for both Stable Swamp Creek and Bulimba Creek have drawn people and wildlife to the Sunnybank area.\n\nBy the first part of the 20th century, farmland increasingly gave way to suburbia. General Motors Holden established a car manufacturing plant on Bradman Street at Acacia Ridge, creating a major source of employment for the entire city of Brisbane.\n\nOpening in 1938, The Oasis, with lush gardens, swimming pools and a mini zoo became Brisbane's most popular tourist attraction. The Oasis was located at 141 Station Road, Sunnybank.\n\nWith the 1982 Commonwealth Games being held at the Queen Elizabeth II sporting complex (QE II), now known as the Queensland Sport and Athletics Centre (QSAC), and Expo 88 years later, Brisbane and its suburbs like Sunnybank were shown to the world. With new land releases rare in the region, developers have turned to building higher density residential and commercial projects.\n\nIn the late 1980s, an increasing number of Asian immigrants began to settle in Sunnybank and neighbouring suburbs. The influx of Asian immigrants caused the look of the area to change, especially in the primary business district of Sunnybank at the intersection of Mains Road and McCullough Street, where Asian restaurants and businesses are numerous.\n\nSunnybank is today a thriving multicultural suburb, with strong Asian influences in design, food and culture. Many of the suburb's shops and businesses are owned and run by people of Asian descent who call Australia home, with many bilingual business signs written in Chinese and English.\n\nIn the , the population of Sunnybank was 8,091, 50.3% female and 49.7% male. The median age of the Sunnybank population was 34 years, 3 years below the Australian median. 44.1% of people living in Sunnybank were born in Australia, compared to the national average of 69.8%; the next most common countries of birth were China 15.1%, Taiwan 7.1%, India 3.5%, New Zealand 2.8%, Vietnam 2.3%. 48% of people spoke only English at home; the next most common languages were 20.4% Mandarin, 7.4% Cantonese, 2% Vietnamese, 1.7% Korean, 1.6% Punjabi.\n\nSunnybank is a busy area, and there have been ever-growing traffic problems in the area. Mains Road can become gridlocked around peak-hour, packed with cars and buses, as commuters make the slow ride home, although construction has widened and improved the Mains Road bridge which crosses the train line at Altandi. Sunnybank plaza has a large bus station, which serves as one of the major stops on most bus routes in the area.\n\nBanoon railway station, Sunnybank railway station and Altandi railway station provides access to regular Queensland Rail City network services to Brisbane and Beenleigh.\n\nSunnybank neighbourhood has many spiritual sites, including Anglican, Assemblies of God, Baptist, Catholic, Chinese Methodists, Christian and Missionary Alliance, Churches of Christ, Lutheran, Mormon/The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints,Presbyterian, Runcorn Christian, Southside International Church, The Great Commission and Uniting churches, Chung Tian Temple, Masjid Al Farooq (Kuraby Mosque), and The Brisbane Synagogue.\n\nSunnybank State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at 50 Eddington Street ().

{"id": "1982107", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1982107", "title": "Afonso Dhlakama", "text": "Afonso Dhlakama\n\nAfonso Marceta Macacho Dhlakama (1 January 1953 – 3 May 2018) was a Mozambican politician and the leader of RENAMO, an anti-communist guerrilla movement that fought the FRELIMO government in the Mozambican Civil War before signing a peace agreement and becoming an opposition political party in the early 1990s.\nDhlakama was born in Mangunde, Sofala Province.\n\nAfter RENAMO's first leader, André Matsangaissa, was killed by Mozambican government forces in 1979, Dhlakama became leader. By 1984, Dhalakama was both commander in chief of RENAMO's forces and head of the governing body, the 12-member executive council. As leader of RENAMO Dhlakama sought to destabilise the FRELIMO government through guerilla strategies. Under his command RENAMO reached the peak of its power, controlling large parts of the country, especially in the north and being able to carry out raids virtually anywhere outside the major cities. In its fight RENAMO was supported by conservative circles in some western countries, including the United States, Portugal, the Brazilian right-wing military regime, and most importantly by the white led governments of Rhodesia and South Africa to whom FRELIMO-ruled Mozambique was a target due to its support of rebel movements within their countries. However, the end of the cold war, the collapse of Rhodesia's Smith government and, most importantly, the transition taking place in South Africa eventually deprived RENAMO of its financial supporters and arms suppliers. Thus, RENAMO and FRELIMO, which had also lost its supporters from the eastern power block, finally signed a peace treaty in October 1992. RENAMO subsequently transformed itself into a legal political party under the continued leadership of Afonso Dhlakama.\n\nAccording to the US State Department and some other sources, under Dhlakama's leadership RENAMO systematically committed crimes against humanity as part of its war effort. These include mass killing and mutilation of non-combatants during raids on villages and towns as well as systematically forcing civilians into RENAMO's employment, though FRELIMO had used similar methods during its fight against the Portuguese. What differed was the abduction of children to use them as child soldiers. It is estimated that one third of RENAMO forces were under 18. Abducted people also had to serve RENAMO in administrative or public service functions in the areas it controlled. Refusing to work for RENAMO would be punished by heavy beating or even on-the-spot execution as were flight attempts, though this was also used by FRELIMO. One particularly gruesome practice was the mutilation and killing of children left behind by escaped parents.\n\nDhlakama has competed as the RENAMO candidate in all three multiparty presidential elections held in Mozambique. In 1994, he was defeated by incumbent President and FRELIMO candidate Joaquim Chissano by a margin of 53.3% to 33.7%. He received 47.7% of the vote in the 1999 presidential election with Chissano capturing 52.3%. In the December 2004 presidential election, he was defeated by FRELIMO candidate Armando Guebuza, who received 63.7% of the vote to his 31.7%.\n\nInternational observers to the elections criticised the fact that the National Electoral Commission (CNE) did not conduct entirely fair and transparent elections. They listed a whole range of serious shortcomings by the electoral authorities that benefited the ruling party FRELIMO. Some believe that the pronounced outcome of the parliamentary election and thus the distribution of seats in the National Assembly does not reflect the will of the Mozambican people.\n\nUpon the creation of the Council of State, a body tasked with advising the President, Dklahama was included on the Council due to his role as leader of the opposition; he and the other members of the Council were sworn in on 23 December 2005. He said that he accepted his seat on the Council for the sake of national stability.\n\nDhlakama was injured in a car crash in Maputo on 10 June 2007. A RENAMO spokesman described the injuries as minor.\n\nAlthough RENAMO was apparently weakened by the defection of Daviz Simango, who formed a new party, Dhlakama was re-elected for another five-year term as RENAMO leader on 22 July 2009 at a party congress in Nampula Province, defeating another candidate, Rogerio Francisco Joao. He was RENAMO's candidate in the October 2009 presidential election.\n\nDhlakama repeatedly threatened to reestablish RENAMO's armed forces and to let the country \"burn\". In 2011 he stated that RENAMO was preparing a \"revolution\" to rid the government from power and establishing new barracks for this purpose.\n\nIn October 2012 Dhlakama relocated to RENAMO's former headquarters near Casa Banana in Gorongosa and set up a training camp for several hundred partially armed followers. He threatened to destroy the country if his political demands were not met. However, the local press considered this threat to be another bluff, doubting that Dhlakama had the means to start any serious insurrection.\nIn April 2013, Renamo militants attacked the riot police's headquarters in the central Mozambican town of Muxungue. Four policemen and a civilian were confirmed dead, while ten servicemen were hospitalised. According to the police, the leader of the attackers was also killed. The attackers were trying to free fifteen of their comrades who had been arrested in a police raid on a Renamo camp the day before. Police claimed that Renamo was conducting illegal military training at the camp. A Renamo spokesman pronounced that \"Our demobilised soldiers will retaliate against any attack and not only in the location where it occurs, but across the entire country, including [...] Maputo.\" Dhlakama later confirmed that he had personally ordered the attack on the police post.\n\nOn 17 October 2013, suspected RENAMO guerrillas ambushed a military patrol near Gorongosa, RENAMO's stronghold, killing seven soldiers, according to local media. Further clashes followed and, in response, on 21 October, FADM forces captured Sathunjira base after days of combat. RENAMO spokesman Fernando Mazanga claimed that the government forces had shelled the base with heavy weapons (artillery), and that Dhlakama had fled the base. A RENAMO statement said that the capture of the base put an end to the 1992 peace deal.\n\nOn 5 September 2014 Dhlakama and president Guebuza signed a peace deal in an effort to end the two-year period of instability. The deal included integration of RENAMO forces into the army and a reform of the election oversight commission. However, after RENAMO's refusal to accept the 2014 presidential elections, problems in the implementation of the peace deal and after continued efforts by government forces to disarm RENAMO met resistance, Dhlakama broke off the peace process in August 2015. Since then there have been renewed clashes between government and RENAMO forces. Dhlakama claimed there were two attempts by the government to assassinate him.\n\nOn May 3, 2018, Dhlakma died in Gorongosa after suffering a heart attack. An unnamed official in RENAMO acknowledged this and also stated that Dhlakma had been ill prior to his death. Regarding the future of RENAMO following Dhlakma's death, Ed Hobey Hamsher, an analyst with Maplecroft, stated that \"no potential successor has Dhlakama's stature\" and that anybody who succeeds him \"will struggle to unify Renamo's factions.\" At the time of Dhlakma's death, the RENAMO Congress was unable to fix a date to vote on a successor. The next month on 14 June 2018, Ossufo Momade, who was picked to serve as the interim leader of RENAMO until the organization's Congress could vote on a permanent successor to Dhlakma, went into hiding.\n\n"}

{"id": "1982124", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1982124", "title": "Domestic rabbit", "text": "Domestic rabbit\n\nA domestic or domesticated rabbit (\"Oryctolagus cuniculus domesticus\")—more commonly known as a pet rabbit, a bunny, a bun, or a bunny rabbit—is a subspecies of European rabbit. A domestic rabbit kept as a pet may be considered a pocket pet, depending on its size. A male rabbit is known as a \"buck,\" a female is a \"doe,\" and a young rabbit is a \"kit\", or \"kitten\".\n\nRabbits were first used by the Romans as sources of food and fur, and have been kept as pets in Western nations since the 19th century. Beginning in the 1980s, the idea of the domestic rabbit as a house companion, a so-called house rabbit, was promoted. Rabbits can be litter box-trained and come when called, but they need exercise and can damage a house that is not \"rabbit proof.\" Unwanted rabbits end up in animal shelters, especially after the Easter season. Because they have become invasive in Australia, pet rabbits are banned in the state of Queensland.\n\nPhoenician sailors visiting the coast of Spain c. 12th century BC, mistaking the European rabbit for a species from their homeland (the rock hyrax \"Procavia capensis\"), gave it the name \"i-shepan-ham\" (land or island of hyraxes).\nThe captivity of rabbits as a food source is recorded as early as the 1st century BC, when the Roman writer Pliny the Elder described the use of rabbit hutches, along with enclosures called \"\". A controversial theory is that a corruption of the rabbit's name used by the Romans became the Latin name for the peninsula, \"Hispania\". In Rome, rabbits were raised in large walled colonies with walls extended underground. According to Pliny, the consumption of unborn and newborn rabbits, called laurices, was considered a delicacy.\n\nEvidence for the domestic rabbit is rather late. In the Middle Ages, wild rabbits were often kept for the hunt. Monks in southern France were crossbreeding rabits at least by the 12th century AD. Domestication was probably a slow process that took place from the Roman period (or earlier) until the 1500s.In the 19th century, as animal fancy in general began to emerge, rabbit fanciers began to sponsor rabbit exhibitions and fairs in Western Europe and the United States. Breeds of various domesticated animals were created and modified for the added purpose of exhibition, a departure from the breeds that had been created solely for food, fur, or wool. The rabbit's emergence as a household pet began during the Victorian era.\nThe keeping of the rabbit as a pet commencing from the 1800s coincides with the first observable skeletal differences between the wild and domestic populations, even though captive rabbits had been exploited for over 2,000 years. Domestic rabbits have been popular in the United States since the late 19th century. What became known as the \"Belgian Hare Boom\" began with the importation of the first Belgian Hares from England in 1888 and, soon after, the founding of the American Belgian Hare Association, the first rabbit club in America. From 1898 to 1901, many thousands of Belgian Hares were imported to America. Today, the Belgian Hare is one of the rarest breeds, with only 132 specimens found in the United States in a 2015 census.\n\nThe American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA) was founded in 1910 and is the national authority on rabbit raising and rabbit breeds having a uniform Standard of Perfection, registration and judging system. The domestic rabbit continues to be popular as a show animal and pet. Many thousand rabbit shows occur each year and are sanctioned in Canada and the United States by the ARBA. Today, the domesticated rabbit is the third most popular mammalian pet in Britain after dogs and cats.\n\nRabbits have been, and continue to be, used in laboratory work such as the production of antibodies for vaccines and research of human male reproductive system toxicology. The Environmental Health Perspective, published by the National Institute of Health, states, \"The rabbit [is] an extremely valuable model for studying the effects of chemicals or other stimuli on the male reproductive system.\" According to the Humane Society of the United States, rabbits are also used extensively in the study of bronchial asthma, stroke prevention treatments, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, and cancer. Animal rights activists have opposed animal experimentation for non-medical purposes, such as the testing of cosmetic and cleaning products, which has resulted in decreased use of rabbits in these areas.\n\nMale rabbits are called \"bucks\"; females are called \"does\". An older term for an adult rabbit is \"coney\", while \"rabbit\" once referred only to the young animals. Another term for a young rabbit is \"bunny\", though this term is often applied informally (especially by children and rabbit enthusiasts) to rabbits generally, especially domestic ones. More recently, the term \"kit\" or \"kitten\" has been used to refer to a young rabbit. A young hare is called a \"leveret\"; this term is sometimes informally applied to a young rabbit as well. A group of rabbits is known as a \"colony\" or a \"nest.\"\n\nThe study of rabbit genetics is of interest to fanciers, the fiber & fur industry, medical researchers, and the meat industry. Among rabbit fanciers, the genetics of rabbit health and diversity are paramount. The fiber & fur industry focuses on the genetics of coat color and hair properties. In the biomedical research community and the pharmaceutical industry, rabbit genetics are important in model organism research, antibody production, and toxicity testing. The meat industry relies on genetics for disease resistance, feed conversion ratios, and reproduction potential in rabbits.\n\nThe rabbit genome has been sequenced and is publicly available. The mitochondrial DNA has also been sequenced. In 2011, parts of the rabbit genome were re-sequenced in greater depth in order to expose variation within the genome.\n\nThere are 11 color gene groups (or loci) in rabbits. A rabbit's coat has either two pigments (pheomelanin for yellow, and eumelanin for dark brown) or no pigment (for an albino rabbit). Clusters of color genes plus their modifiers control such aspects as coat patterns (e.g. \"Dutch\" or \"English\" markings), color hues and their intensity or dilution, and the location of color bands on the hair shaft (e.g., silvering).\n\nAs a refinement of the diet of the wild rabbit, the diet of the domestic rabbit is often a function of its purpose. Show rabbits are fed for vibrant health, strong musculoskeletal systems, and—like rabbits intended for the fur trade—optimal coat production and condition. Rabbits intended for the meat trade are fed for swift and efficient production of flesh, while rabbits in research settings have closely controlled diets for specific goals. Nutritional needs of the domestic rabbit may also be focused on developing a physique that allows for the safe delivery of larger litters of healthy kits. Optimizing costs and producing feces that meet local waste regulations may also be factors. The diet of a pet rabbit, too, is geared toward its purpose—as a healthy and long-lived companion.\n\nHay is an essential part of the diet of all rabbits and it is a major component of the commercial food pellets that are formulated for domestic rabbits and available in many areas. Pellets are typically fed to adult rabbits in limited quantities once or twice a day, to mimic their natural behavior and to prevent obesity. It is recommended only a teaspoon to an egg cup full of pellets is fed to adult rabbits each day. Most rabbit pellets are alfalfa-based for protein and fiber, with other grains completing the carbohydrate requirements. \"Muesli\" style rabbit foods are also available; these contain separate components—e.g., dried carrot, pea flakes and hay pellets as opposed to a uniform pellet. These are not recommended as rabbits will choose favored parts and leave the rest. Muesli style feeds are often lower in fiber than pelleted versions of rabbit food. Additionally numerous studies have found they increase the risk of obesity and dental disease. Minerals and vitamins are added during production of rabbit pellets to meet the nutritional requirements of the domestic rabbit. Along with pellets, many commercial rabbit raisers also feed one or more types of loose hay, for its freshness and important cellulose components. Alfalfa in particular is recommended for the growth needs of young rabbits.\n\nRabbits are hindgut fermenters and therefore have an enlarged cecum. This allows a rabbit to digest, via fermentation, what it otherwise would not be able to metabolically process.\n\nAfter a rabbit ingests food, the food travels down the esophagus and through a small valve called the cardia. In rabbits, this valve is very well pronounced and makes the rabbit incapable of vomiting. The food enters the stomach after passing through the cardia. Food then moves to the stomach and small intestine, where a majority of nutrient extraction and absorption takes place. Food then passes into the colon and eventually into the cecum. Peristaltic muscle contractions (waves of motion) help to separate fibrous and non-fibrous particles. The non-fibrous particles are then moved backwards up the colon, through the illeo-cecal valve, and into the cecum. Symbiotic bacteria in the cecum help to further digest the non-fibrous particles into a more metabolically manageable substance. After as little as three hours, a soft, fecal \"pellet,\" called a cecotrope, is expelled from the rabbit's anus. The rabbit instinctively eats these grape-like pellets, without chewing, in exchange keeping the mucous coating intact. This coating protects the vitamin- and nutrient-rich bacteria from stomach acid, until it reaches the small intestine, where the nutrients from the cecotrope can be absorbed.\n\nThe soft pellets contain a sufficiently large portion of nutrients that are critical to the rabbit's health. This soft fecal matter is rich in vitamin B and other nutrients. The process of coprophagy is important to the stability of a rabbit's digestive health because it is one important way that which a rabbit receives vitamin B in a form that is useful to its digestive wellness. Occasionally, the rabbit may leave these pellets lying about its cage; this behavior is harmless and usually related to an ample food supply.\n\nWhen caecal pellets are wet and runny (semi-liquid) and stick to the rabbit and surrounding objects, they are called intermittent soft cecotropes (ISCs). This is different from ordinary diarrhea and is usually caused by a diet too high in carbohydrates or too low in fiber. Soft fruit or salad items such as lettuce, cucumbers and tomatoes are possible causes.\n\nRabbits have a reputation as prolific breeders, and deservedly so, in part because rabbits reach breeding age quickly. To prevent unwanted offspring and to possibly benefit the rabbit's behavior, rabbits may be spayed or neutered at sexual maturity: 4–5 months for small breeds (e.g., Mini Rex, Netherland Dwarf), 5–6 months for medium-sized breeds (e.g., Rex, New Zealand), and 6–7 months for large breeds (e.g., Flemish Giant). Bucks usually require more time to sexually mature than does, and they normally reach adult sperm counts at 6–7 months.\n\nRabbits, like all mammals, produce milk for their young. Female rabbits have six to eight nipples and produce milk for four weeks after birthing. Rabbit milk is relatively high in fat, as a percentage by mass. While most species produce approximately 5% milk fat, rabbits produce 12%. The excerpted table below compares milk characteristics among mammals.\nDisease is rare when rabbits are raised in sanitary conditions and provided with adequate care. Rabbits have fragile bones, especially in their spines, and need support on the belly or bottom when they are picked up.\n\nSpayed or neutered rabbits kept indoors with proper care may have a lifespan of 8 to 12 years, with mixed-breed rabbits typically living longer than purebred specimens, and dwarf breeds having longer average lifespans than larger breeds. The world record for longest-lived rabbit is 18 years.\n\nRabbits will gnaw on almost anything, including electrical cords (possibly leading to electrocution), potentially poisonous plants, and material like carpet and fabric that may cause life-threatening intestinal blockages, so areas to which they have access need to be pet-proofed.\n\nRabbit fancier organizations and veterinarians recommend that pet rabbits be made infertile by spaying or neutering by a rabbit-experienced veterinarian. Health advantages of surgically altering a rabbit include increased longevity and (for females) a reduced risk of ovarian and uterine cancers or of endometritis. For both rabbit sexes, spaying or neutering reduces aggression toward other rabbits, as well as territorial marking (especially in males). Rabbits are at high risk for complications from anesthesia and infection of the surgical site is another top concern. Since un-altered animals are not as likely to form agreeable social bonds, spaying and neutering promotes less stressful interactions.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, including the United States (except where required by local animal control ordinances), rabbits do not require vaccination. Vaccinations exist for both rabbit hemorrhagic disease and myxomatosis. These vaccinations are usually given annually, two weeks apart. If there is an outbreak of myxomatosis locally, this vaccine can be administered every six months for extra protection. Myxomatosis immunizations are not available in all countries, including Australia, due to fears that immunity will pass on to feral rabbits. However, they are recommended by some veterinarians as prophylactics, where they are legally available. In the UK a combined vaccination exists for myxomatosis and VHD1 made by Nobivac called Myxo-RHD, this is given yearly. Due to increasing cases of VHD2 it is now recommended rabbits receive an additional vaccination for RHD2 one brand for this is filovac, the vaccination is given yearly 2 weeks apart from other vaccinations, it may be given 6 monthly at rabbit believed to be at higher risk.\n\nA rabbit cannot be declawed. Lacking pads on the bottoms of its feet, a rabbit requires its claws for traction. Removing its claws would render it unable to stand.\n\nCoping with stress is a key aspect of rabbit behavior, and this can be traced to part of the brain known as ventral tegmental area (VTA). Dopaminergic neurons in this part of the brain release the hormone dopamine. In rabbits, it is released as part of a coping mechanism while in a heightened state of fear or stress, and has a calming effect. Dopamine has also been found in the rabbit's medial prefrontal cortex, the nucleus accumbens, and the amygdala. Physiological and behavioral responses to human-induced tonic immobility (TI, sometimes termed \"trancing\" or \"playing dead\") have been found to be indicative of a fear-motivated stress state, confirming that the promotion of TI to try to increase a bond between rabbits and their owners—thinking the rabbits enjoy it—is misplaced. However, some researchers conclude that inducing TI in rabbits is appropriate for certain procedures, as it holds less risk than anesthesia.\n\nThe formation of open sores on the rabbit's hocks, commonly called \"sore hocks\", is a problem that commonly afflicts mostly heavy-weight rabbits kept in cages with wire flooring or soiled solid flooring. The problem is most prevalent in rex-furred rabbits and heavy-weight rabbits (over ), as well as those with thin foot bristles.\n\nThe condition results when, over the course of time, the protective bristle-like fur on the rabbit's hocks thins down. Standing urine or other unsanitary cage conditions can exacerbate the problem by irritating the sensitive skin. The exposed skin in turn can result in tender areas or, in severe cases, open sores, which may then become infected and abscessed if not properly cared for.\n\nGastrointestinal stasis (GI stasis) is a serious and potentially fatal condition that occurs in some rabbits in which gut motility is severely reduced and possibly completely stopped. When untreated or improperly treated, GI stasis can be fatal in as little as 24 hours.\n\nGI stasis is the condition of food not moving through the gut as quickly as normal. The gut contents may dehydrate and compact into a hard, immobile mass (impacted gut), blocking the digestive tract of the rabbit. Food in an immobile gut may also ferment, causing significant gas buildup and resultant gas pain for the rabbit.\n\nThe first noticeable symptom of GI stasis may be that the rabbit suddenly stops eating. Treatment frequently includes intravenous or subcutaneous fluid therapy (rehydration through injection of a balanced electrolyte solution), pain control, possible careful massage to promote gas expulsion and comfort, drugs to promote gut motility, and careful monitoring of all inputs and outputs. The rabbit's diet may also be changed as part of treatment, to include force-feeding to ensure adequate nutrition. Surgery to remove the blockage is not generally recommended and comes with a poor prognosis.\n\nSome rabbits are more prone to GI stasis than others. The causes of GI stasis are not completely understood, but common contributing factors are thought to include stress, reduced food intake, low fiber in the diet, dehydration, reduction in exercise or blockage caused by excess fur or carpet ingestion. Stress factors can include changes in housing, transportation, or medical procedures under anesthesia. As many of these factors may occur together (poor dental structure leading to decreased food intake, followed by a stressful veterinary dental procedure to correct the dental problem) establishing a root cause may be difficult.\n\nGI stasis is sometimes misdiagnosed as \"hair balls\" by veterinarians or rabbit keepers not familiar with the condition. While fur is commonly found in the stomach following a fatal case of GI stasis, it is also found in healthy rabbits. Molting and chewing fur can be a predisposing factor in the occurrence of GI stasis, however, the primary cause is the change in motility of the gut.\n\nDental disease has several causes, namely genetics, inappropriate diet, injury to the jaw, infection, or cancer.\n\nSigns of dental difficulty include difficulty eating, weight loss and small stools and visibly overgrown teeth. However, there are many other causes of ptyalism, including pain due to other causes.\n\nAn over-diagnosed ailment amongst rabbits is respiratory infection, known colloquially as \"snuffles\". \"Pasteurella\", a bacterium, is usually misdiagnosed and this is known to be a factor in the overuse of antibiotics among rabbits. A runny nose, for instance, can have several causes, among those being high temperature or humidity, extreme stress, environmental pollution (like perfume or incense), or a sinus infection. Options for treating this is removing the pollutant, lowering or raising the temperature accordingly, and medical treatment for sinus infections. \"Pasteurella\" does live naturally in a rabbit's respiratory tract, and it can flourish out of control in some cases. In the rare event that happens, antibiotic treatment is necessary.\n\nSneezing can be a sign of environmental pollution (such as too much dust) or a food allergy.\n\nRunny eyes and other conjunctival problems can be caused by dental disease or a blockage of the tear duct. Environmental pollution, corneal disease, entropion, distichiasis, or inflammation of the eyes are also causes. This is easy to diagnose as well as treat.\n\nRabbits are subject to infection by a variety of viruses. Some have had deadly and widespread impact.\n\nMyxomatosis is a virulent threat to all rabbits but not to humans. The intentional introduction of myxomatosis in rabbit-ravaged Australia killed an estimated 500 million feral rabbits between 1950 and 1952. The Australian government will not allow veterinarians to purchase and use the myxomatosis vaccine that would protect domestic rabbits, for fear that this immunity would be spread into the wild via escaped livestock and pets. This potential consequence is also one motivation for the pet-rabbit ban in Queensland.\n\nIn Australia, rabbits caged outdoors in areas with high numbers of mosquitoes are vulnerable to myxomatosis. In Europe, fleas are the carriers of myxomatosis. In some countries, annual vaccinations against myxomatosis are available.\n\nRabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD), also known as \"viral hemorrhagic disease\" (VHD) or \"rabbit calicivirus disease\" (RCD), is caused by a rabbit-specific calicivirus known as RHDV or RCV. Discovered in 1983, RHD is highly infectious and usually fatal. Initial signs of the disease may be limited to fever and lethargy, until significant internal organ damage results in labored breathing, squealing, bloody mucus, and eventual coma and death. Internally, the infection causes necrosis of the liver and damages other organs, especially the spleen, kidneys, and small intestine.\n\nRHD, like myxomatosis, has been intentionally introduced to control feral rabbit populations in Australia and (illegally) in New Zealand, and RHD has, in some areas, escaped quarantine. The disease has killed tens of millions of rabbits in China (unintentionally) as well as Australia, with other epidemics reported in Bolivia, Mexico, South Korea, and continental Europe. Rabbit populations in New Zealand have bounced back after developing a genetic immunity to RHD, and the disease has, so far, had no effect on the genetically divergent native wild rabbits and hares in the Americas.\n\nIn the United States, an October 2013 USDA document stated:\n\nIn the UK, reports of RHD (as recently as February 2018) have been submitted to the British Rabbit Council's online \"Notice Board\". Vaccines for RHD are available—and mandatory—in the UK.\n\nWest Nile virus is another threat to domestic as well as wild rabbits. It is a fatal disease, and while vaccines are available for other species, there are none yet specifically indicated for rabbits.\n\nWry neck (or \"head tilt\") is a condition in rabbits that can be fatal, due to the resulting disorientation that causes the animal to stop eating and drinking. Inner ear infections or ear mites, as well as diseases or injuries affecting the brain (including stroke) can lead to wry neck. The most common cause, however, is a parasitic microscopic fungus called \"Encephalitozoon cuniculi\" (\"E. cuniculi\"). Note that: \"despite approximately half of all pet rabbits carrying the infection, only a small proportion of these cases ever show any illness\". Some vets now recommend treating rabbits against \"E. cuniculi\". The usual drugs for treatment and prevention are the benzimidazole anthelmintics, particularly fenbendazole (also used as a deworming agent in other animal species). In the UK, fenbendazole (under the brand name \"Panacur Rabbit\"), is sold over-the-counter in oral paste form as a nine-day treatment. Fenbendazole is particularly recommended for rabbits kept in colonies and as a preventive before mixing new rabbits with each other.\n\nFly strike, or blowfly strike, (\"Lucilia sericata\") is a condition that occurs when flies (particularly botflies) lay their eggs in a rabbit's damp or soiled fur, or in an open wound. Within 12 hours, the eggs hatch into the larval stage of the fly, known as maggots. Initially small but quickly growing to long, maggots can burrow into skin and feed on an animal's tissue, leading to shock and death. The most susceptible rabbits are those in unsanitary conditions, sedentary ones, and those unable to clean their excretory areas. Rabbits with diarrhea should be inspected for fly strike, especially during the summer months. The topical treatment Rearguard® (from Novartis) is approved in the United Kingdom for 10-week-per-application prevention of fly strike.\n\nAs of 2017, there were at least 305 breeds of domestic rabbit in 70 countries around the world. The American Rabbit Breeders Association currently recognizes 49 rabbit breeds and the British Rabbit Council recognizes 106. Selective breeding has produced rabbits ranging in size from dwarf to giant. Across the world, rabbits are raised as livestock (in \"cuniculture)\" for their meat, pelts, and wool, and also by fanciers and hobbyists as pets.\n\nRabbits have been selectively bred since ancient times to achieve certain desired characteristics. Variations include size and body shape, coat type (including hair length and texture), coat color, ear carriage (erect or lop), and even ear length. As with any animal, domesticated rabbits' temperaments vary in such factors as energy level and novelty seeking.\n\nMost genetic defects in the domestic rabbit (such as dental problems in the Holland Lop breed) are due to recessive genes. Genetics are carefully tracked by fanciers who show rabbits, to breed out defects.\n\nRabbits have been kept as pets in Western nations since the 19th century, but because of the destructive history of feral rabbits in Australia, domestic rabbits are illegal as pets in Queensland. Depending upon its size, a rabbit may be considered a type of pocket pet. Rabbits can bond with humans, can learn to follow simple voice commands and to come when called, and are curious and playful.\n\nRabbits do not make good pets for small children because rabbits are fragile and easily injured by rough handling, can bite when hurt or frightened, and are easily frightened by loud noises and sudden motions. With the right guidance, rabbits can be trained to live indoors perfectly.\n\nRabbits are especially popular as pets in the United States during the Easter season, due to their association with the holiday. However, animal shelters that accept rabbits often complain that during the weeks and months following Easter, there is a rise in unwanted and neglected rabbits that were bought as Easter gifts, especially for children. Similar problems arise in rural areas after county fairs and the like, in jurisdictions where rabbits are legal prizes in fairground games.\n\nThus, there are many humane societies, animal shelters, and rescue groups that have rabbits available for pet adoption. Fancy rabbit breeds are often purchased from pet stores, private breeders, and fanciers.\n\nRabbits may be kept as small house pets and \"rabbit-proofed\" spaces reduce the risks associated with their intrinsic need to chew. Rabbits are easily litter box trained and a rabbit that lives indoors may be less exposed to the dangers of predators, parasites, diseases, adverse weather, and pesticides, which in turn increases their lifespan. Rabbits are often compatible with others of their kind, or with birds or guinea pigs, but opinion differs regarding the dangers of housing different species together. For example, while rabbits can synthesize their own Vitamin C, guinea pigs cannot, so the two species should not be fed the same diet. Also, most rabbits tend to be stronger than guinea pigs, so this may cause deliberate or inadvertent injury. Some people consider rabbits a pocket pet even though they are rather large.\nKeeping a rabbit as a house companion was popularised by Sandy Crook in her 1981 book \"Your French Lop\". In 1983, at the American Family Pet Show in Anaheim, California (attended by 35,000), Crook presented her personal experiences living with an indoor rabbit as evidence of a human-rabbit bond. In the late 1980s, it became more common to litter box train a rabbit and keep it indoors, after the publication of Marinell Harriman's \"House Rabbit Handbook: How to Live with an Urban Rabbit\" in 1985. (The book's fifth edition was published in 2013.)\n\nAs the domestic descendants of wild prey animals, rabbits are alert, timid creatures that startle fairly easily, and many of their behaviors are triggered by the fight-or-flight response to perceived threats. According to the House Rabbit Society, the owner of a pet rabbit can use various behavioral approaches to gain the animal's trust and reduce aggression, though this can be a long and difficult process.\n\nIn addition, there is evidence to suggest that young rabbits that occupy the periphery of the \"litter huddle\" obtain less milk from the mother and, as a result, have a lower weight. It has been suggested that this factor may contribute to behavioural differences in litter mates during adolescence.\n\nNot all veterinarians will treat rabbits, and pet owners may have to seek out an Exotic Animal Veterinarian for their rabbit's care. Rabbits need regular checkups at the veterinarian because they may hide signs of illness or disease. Additionally, rabbits need regular maintenance in the form of being able to chew on something and having their nails trimmed regularly. \n\nThe advantages of keeping rabbits as pets is that they are clean, smart, cute, soft and have a low carbon footprint. They may or may not react favorably to handling and petting depending on their personality and how they were raised. There are also many different sizes and characteristics available, owing to a long history of breeding. Rabbits are friendly to each other and are often compatible with other pets. Rabbits are herbivores and their diet is relatively simple. Compared to other small animals kept as pets, rabbits are physically robust creatures with strong hind legs that enable them to run fast, and they have powerful teeth. Rabbits should never be picked up by the ears or the \"scruff\" on the back of their neck because \"their skeletons are light compared to their bodies, and they susceptible to trauma from falling, twisting, and kicking\". Rabbits breed rapidly and so it is often easy, and affordable, to find one to buy or adopt.\n\nSome disadvantages of keeping rabbits as pets is that they may chew many things in the house. Unneutered male rabbits may spray their territory with a strong-smelling urine, unspayed female urine is also pungent, and so the litter box may smell. Rabbits can bite and scratch, and may do so to communicate displeasure, or if ignored; it is a part of normal communication and cannot be stopped entirely. They have to be picked up and handled properly to avoid injury to the rabbit or the owner. They may leave faeces around the house and are not always that conscious of leaving their droppings in the litter box. Rabbits can potentially be aggressive and territorial. Some rabbits may also be unfriendly, and then would be unsuitable as pets for children.\n\nRabbits have a different body language to the most common domestic pets: cats and dogs. If someone wants a rabbit and is only familiar with those pet animals, then they would have to learn a lot about caring for this species and the behaviour of rabbits. They are often compared to guinea pigs but they may be as similar, in care and behaviour, to guinea pigs as they are to cats. Like cats, they are smart and can be litterbox trained. They also use their teeth and claws as weapons of defense and they can jump like a cat. They are quiet like a cat and independent, but they are also quite curious. Another animal they might be compared to is a chinchilla.\n\nRabbits have been kept as livestock since ancient times for their meat, wool, and fur. In modern times, rabbits are also utilized in scientific research as laboratory animals.\n\nBreeds such as the New Zealand and Californian are frequently utilized for meat in commercial rabbitries. These breeds have efficient metabolisms and grow quickly; they are ready for slaughter by approximately 14 to 16 weeks of age.\n\nRabbit fryers are rabbits that are between 70 and 90 days of age, and weighing between 3 and 5 lb (1 to 2 kg) live weight. Rabbit roasters are rabbits from 90 days to 6 months of age weighing between 5 and 8 lb (2 to 3.5 kg) live weight. Rabbit stewers are rabbits from 6 months on weighing over 8 lb.\n\nAny type of rabbit can be slaughtered for meat, but those exhibiting the \"commercial\" body type are most commonly raised for meat purposes. Dark fryers (any other color but albino whites) are sometimes lower in price than albino fryers because of the slightly darker tinge of the fryer (purely pink carcasses are preferred by consumers) and because the dark hairs are easier to see than if there are residual white hairs on the carcass. There is no difference in skinability.\n\nRabbits such as the Angora, American Fuzzy Lop, and Jersey Wooly produce wool. However, since the American Fuzzy Lop and Jersey Wooly are both dwarf breeds, only the much larger Angora breeds such as the English Angora, Satin Angora, Giant Angora, and French Angoras are used for commercial wool production. Their long fur is sheared, combed, or plucked (gently pulling loose hairs from the body during molting) and then spun into yarn used to make a variety of products. Angora sweaters can be purchased in many clothing stores and is generally mixed with other types of wool. Rabbit wool, called Angora, is 2.5 times warmer than sheep's wool.\nRabbit breeds that were developed for their fur qualities include the Rex with its plush texture, the Satin with its lustrous color, and the Chinchilla for its exotic pattern. White rabbit fur may be dyed in an array of colors that aren't produced naturally. Rabbits in the fur industry are fed a diet focused for robust coat production and pelts are harvested after the rabbit reaches prime condition, which takes longer than in the meat industry. Rabbit fur is used in local and commercial textile industries throughout the world. China imports much of its rabbit fur from Scandinavia (80%) and some from North America (5%), according to the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service GAIN Report CH7607.\n\nRabbits have been and continue to be used in laboratory work such as production of antibodies for vaccines and research of human male reproductive system toxicology. In 1972, around 450,000 rabbits were used for experiments in the United States, decreasing to around 240,000 in 2006. The Environmental Health Perspective, published by the National Institute of Health, states, \"The rabbit [is] an extremely valuable model for studying the effects of chemicals or other stimuli on the male reproductive system.\" According to the Humane Society of the United States, rabbits are also used extensively in the study of bronchial asthma, stroke prevention treatments, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, and cancer.\n\nThe New Zealand White is one of the most commonly used breeds for research and testing.\nAnimal rights activists generally oppose animal experimentation for all purposes, and rabbits are no exception. The use of rabbits for the Draize test, which is used for, amongst other things, testing cosmetics on animals, has been cited as an example of cruelty in animal research. Albino rabbits are typically used in the Draize tests because they have less tear flow than other animals, and the lack of eye pigment makes the effects easier to visualize.\n\nRabbits can live outdoors in properly constructed, sheltered hutches, which provide protection from the elements in winter and keep rabbits cool in summer heat. To protect from predators, rabbit hutches are usually situated in a fenced yard, shed, barn, or other enclosed structure, which may also contain a larger pen for exercise. Rabbits in such an environment can alternatively be allowed to roam the secured area freely, and simply be provided with an adapted doghouse for shelter. A more elaborate setup is an artificial warren. However, because of stress related to being inside confined spaces too small for a rabbit, it is recommended that instead of a cage, domestic rabbits free-roam indoors.\n\nRabbit show jumping, a form of animal sport between rabbits, began in the 1970s and has since become popular in Europe, particularly Sweden and the United Kingdom. When rabbit jumping was first starting out, the rules of competition were the same as horse jumping rules. However, rules were later changed to reflect a rabbit's abilities. The first national championship for rabbit show jumping was held in Stockholm, Sweden in 1987. Any rabbit, regardless of breed, may participate in this kind of competition, as it is based on athletic skill.\n\n\n"}

The term was rapidly accepted in the year of its proposal (1914) by Sigmund Freud, to cover a topographical view of the mind in terms of different psychic systems.\n\nSince the 1970s, Depth psychology has come to refer to the ongoing development of theories and therapies pioneered by Pierre Janet, William James, and Carl Jung as well as Freud. All explore relationships between the conscious and the unconscious (thus including both psychoanalysis and Jungian psychology).\n\nDepth psychology states the psyche is a process which is:\n- partly conscious,\n- partly unconscious and\n- partly semi-conscious. \n\nIn practice, depth psychology seeks to explore underlying motives as an approach to various mental disorder. It believes uncovering of deeper, often unconscious motives is intrinsically healing in and of itself. It seeks the deep layers underlying behavioral and cognitive processes. \n\nIn modern times the initial work, development, theories and therapies of Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Alfred Adler and Otto Rank have resulted in three main perspectives on depth psychology:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKen Wilber \"Integral Psychology\" (2000)\n\n"}

A staunch Roman Catholic, she was well known for her opinions opposing homosexuality, abortion, and sex education.\n\nShe and her husband Bill were involved in the creation of the Christian Heritage Party in 1984 after a dozen or so people discussed the concept of such a party, which was registered with Elections Canada in June 1986.\n\nFrom April 1993 to March 1994 she was the interim leader of the party and ran in the 1993 federal election in the riding of Surrey—White Rock—South Langley. One of the most contentious policies of the Christian Heritage Party Policy is Section 6.4.3. which states: \"Concerning the welfare of this Nation's citizens, we favour recriminalizing in the Criminal Code of Canada the murder of pre-born children, sexual deviancy, and pornography.\" She entered the leadership race for the CHP at the 1994 convention, but withdrew and instead ran for the party presidency.\n\nHeather Stilwell was also executive vice-president and leader of the socially conservative Family Coalition Party of British Columbia which later merged into the British Columbia Unity Party. Stilwell ran unsuccessfully in the 2001 provincial election, as a candidate in the riding of Surrey-Panorama Ridge.\n\nShe was a national board member and Western Regional Coordinator for the anti-abortion group Campaign Life Coalition, which strongly opposed what she referred to as \"special rights for homosexuals\".\n\nShe was President of the Alliance for Life, a national pro-life group based in Winnipeg, Manitoba and one-time President of the Surrey-Delta Pro-Life Association, the Pro-life Society of British Columbia, the Surrey-Delta Alliance For Life and the federal (Canadian) Alliance for Life. She was a member of the socially conservative lobby group REAL Women of Canada.\nAs co-founder of the publicly funded Surrey Traditional School in 1994, Stilwell played a key role in objecting to library books that offended her Christian beliefs. These books were temporarily banned as they dealt with topics such as Halloween, the Wicca religion and native-Indian spirituality. After pressure from the public, the school board allowed these books back into the library. \n\nStilwell became a member and eventual chair of the Surrey School Board. She voted to ban sex education and condom machines in Surrey schools. In 1997 she also voted, along with the majority of the school board, that three books dealing with families where both parents were of the same sex not be included as optional learning resources. These books were requested by a kindergarten teacher to teach his pupils about diversity and tolerance. \n\nA legal battle to overturn the decision to ban the three books went all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada, where the school board's decision was overturned in 2002.\n\nThe judgement in the case cited the need for families headed by same-sex couples to be respected. Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin dismissed the board's concerns that children would be confused or misled by classroom information about same-sex parents. She pointed out that the children of same-sex parents are rubbing shoulders with children from more traditional families and wrote: \"Tolerance is always age-appropriate, children cannot learn unless they are exposed to views that differ from those they are taught at home.\" The legal fees ended up costing Surrey taxpayers over $1,200,000.\nStilwell ran as an independent candidate for the School Board in the Surrey municipal election held Nov 19, 2005, and won re-election.\n\nIn May 2007 Stilwell proposed a motion to ensure that if the film \"An Inconvenient Truth\", about global warming, were used as a resource in the Surrey School District, other resources which give an opposing view would also be used. This motion was unanimously passed by other members of the Board of Education. An article on the CBC website has quoted her on \"An Inconvenient Truth\": \"I think there is climate change, there's no question about that. Whether what Al Gore says about it is the truth, I have questions.\"\n\nIn 2008, she resigned from the school board when she was diagnosed with breast cancer.

{"id": "1982138", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1982138", "title": "Kipahulu, Hawaii", "text": "Kipahulu, Hawaii\n\nKīpahulu is an unincorporated community in the Hāna district of southeastern Maui, Hawaii.\n\nKīpahulu is unincorporated and is located south of Hana and east of Kaupo. The only land access to the area is from the north by Hana Highway driving about 45 minutes past Hana or from west by highway 31 (Piilani Highway) which was reopened in 2008 after a nearly two-year closure due to earthquake damage. Piilani Highway is the only major road in Kīpahulu and all populated areas are located along this road.\n\nKīpahulu does not have any electric or water utilities. The only public utility is the telephone. Water is obtained from the streams coming down from Haleakalā and these services are provided to the community by Kaupo Ranch, Ltd.\n\nThe first written description of Kīpahulu was made by Jean-François de Galaup in 1786 while sailing along the southeast coast of Maui in search of a place to drop anchor:\nI coasted along its shore at a distance of a league (three miles) …. We beheld water falling in cascades …. The inhabitants, which are so numerous that a space of 3–4 leagues may be taken for a single village. The huts are on the coast so that the habitable part of the island is less than one half of a league. After passing Kaupō no more waterfalls are seen, and villages are fewer.\n\nKīpahulu lowlands were once heavily populated. The area held hundreds of farm sites and agricultural terraces that could support hundreds of people. It was formerly the center of one of the old land districts (\"moku\"). In nearby coastal area surveys, over 700 archeological features have been found in the surveyed. The features consist of stone mounds and walls and earthen terraces.\n\nCoastal villages consisted of housing clusters for extended families (Hawaiian: ohana) and included living quarters, cook houses, and sheds used for work, storage, and canoes. More dwellings, used occasionally, were located farther upland throughout the cultivated area. All structures were single story, one room wood frame buildings with thatched walls and roofs. Small stone shrines were associated with village sites.\n\nWith the development of the whaling industry on the island in 1880s Kīpahulu population started to decline as people moved to main whaling ports like Lahaina.\n\nIn the early 1900s, one of the regular ports of call for the Inter-Island Steam Navigation Company was Kīpahulu. Steamships provided passenger service around Maui and between the islands. Kīpahulu Landing also provided a way for growers and ranchers to ship their goods to markets. Today the land where Kīpahulu Landing existed is private but protected by The Nature Conservancy.\n\n\nHaleakalā National Park was established as a separate unit of the National Park System in 1960 (it was previously joined with Hawaii National Park on Hawaii Island). At the time, the park only consisted of the crater area of Haleakalā. On March 26, 1951, Kīpahulu Valley was added to Haleakalā National Park (HNP) as the Kīpahulu Biological Reserve to insure protection of endangered ecosystems within the sanctuary. Eighteen years later on January 10, 1969, the HNP boundaries were expanded to include the Kīpahulu coastal area of Oheo.\nAlthough access in the Kīpahulu Biological Reserve is strictly limited to researchers and managers, the Oheo region of the park is open for recreation. Attractions include the Oheo Pools, often called the \"Seven Sacred Pools\" (a name created by tourism proponents), a car-accessible campground, and several maintained trails, such as the four-mile Pipiwai Loop Trail to Waimoku waterfall. The Kīpahulu Ohana, a non-profit community organization established in 1995 through a co-operative agreement with Haleakalā National Park to revive, restore, and share the practices of traditional Native Hawaiian culture, also conducts community-based cultural tours in the area.\n\n"}
{"id": "1982144", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1982144", "title": "The Tower of Druaga", "text": "The Tower of Druaga\n\n\"Druaga\" was designed by Masanobu Endo, best known for creating \"Xevious\" (1983). Inspired by games such as \"Wizardry\" and \"Dungeons & Dragons\", it was conceived as a \"fantasy \"Pac-Man\"\" with combat and puzzle solving, taking inspiration from Sumerian, Mesopotamian and Babylonian mythology. It began as a prototype game called \"Quest\" with interlocking mazes, revised to run on an arcade system; the original concept was scrapped due to Endo disliking the heavy use of role-playing elements, instead becoming a more action-oriented game.\n\nIn Japan, \"The Tower of Druaga\" was widely successful, attracting millions of fans for its use of secrets and hidden items. It is cited as an important game of its genre for laying down the foundation for future games, as well as inspiring the idea of sharing tips with friends and guidebooks. \"Druaga\" is noted as being influential for many games to follow, including \"Ys\", \"Hydlide\", \"Dragon Slayer\" and \"The Legend of Zelda\". In North America, the game was met with a more negative reception for its obtuse design, which many said was near-impossible to finish without a guidebook, alongside its high difficulty and controls. The success of the game in Japan inspired several ports for multiple platforms, as well as spawning a massive franchise known as the \"Babylonian Castle Saga\", including multiple sequels, spin-offs, literature and an anime series produced by Gonzo.\n\n\"The Tower of Druaga\" is an action role-playing maze video game. Controlling the knight Gilgamesh, the player must scale all 60 floors of the tower to rescue the maiden Ki from Druaga, an eight-armed and four-legged demon who plans to use an artifact called the Blue Crystal Rod to enslave mankind. Gilgamesh will need to locate a key on each floor in order to open a door, allowing him to proceed to the next floor.\n\nEach floor contains enemies that Gilgamesh may need to defeat to progress, such as slimes, knights, projectile-firing wizards, ghosts that can travel through walls and fire-spewing dragons. Gilgamesh can defeat these enemies by hitting them with a sword — some will require multiple hits to defeat. Gilgamesh can also block a projectile by facing it with his shield. Each floor also has a hidden item that can be uncovered by completing tasks, such as defeating a certain number of enemies or inputting a specific code with the joystick. These items include a pickaxe that can destroy walls, boots that will drastically increase Gilgamesh's walking speed, and a candle that can reveal ghosts. Some of these items are required to fully beat the game, and failing to do so will either cause the player to die or make the game unwinnable.\n\nA time limit is also present on each floor, and should the player take too long, two indestructible spherical enemies named \"Will-o-Wisps\" will charge towards Gilgamesh. Should the player forget to get a required item, they will instead be sent back, or \"zapped\", to an earlier floor to retrieve it. The game's mazes are randomized in each playthrough, although the treasure will appear at the player's starting point.\n\n\"The Tower of Druaga\" was designed by Masanobu Endo, who had joined Namco in April 1982. After releasing \"Xevious\" a year later, an overwhelming success in Japan, Endo took a business trip to North America, where he bought a copy of \"Dungeons & Dragons\". Intrigued by its gameplay and setting, Endo — a fan of the Apple II game \"Wizardry\" — had set out to make his next game an action role-playing title. After returning to Japan, he designed a basic prototype game called \"Quest\", where the player would be able to explore inter-locking rooms while defeating enemies and using keys to open doors — an expanded version was then made to run on the Namco Super Pac-Man arcade system, where it was titled \"The Return of Ishtar\". Upon completion, Endo was dissatisfied with the game's heavy use of role-playing elements, leading to the game instead becoming an action-oriented game with puzzle solving, conceived as a \"fantasy \"Pac-Man\"\".\n\nFor the second prototype, Endo took inspiration from Sumerian, Mesopotamian and Babylonian mythology, including \"The Epic of Gilgamesh\" and The Tower of Babel. Several characters were named after Mesopotamian and Indian gods, including antagonist Druaga and the goddess Ishtar. The game was made to run on the same hardware setup used in \"Mappy\", which featured horizontal-scrolling and had a vertical screen layout, while the 60 floors were inspired by the Sunshine 60, the tallest building in Asia at the time. Music for the game was composed by Junko Ozawa. The promotional arcade flyer used miniature dioramas with cardboard cutouts instead of drawings, a response to Namco president Masaya Nakamura's hatred towards manga. The last frame in the poster has Gilgamesh wearing the horned helmet fighting Druaga, meant to imply that players would need it in order to finish the game. \"The Tower of Druaga\" was released for arcades in Japan in June 1984.\n\n\"Druaga\" was ported to several Japanese game systems, including the MSX (1984), Family Computer (1985) and Fujitsu FM-7 (1985). A portable Game Boy version was released in 1990, while a 16-bit remake for the PC-Engine in 1992. The GB version was re-released in 1996 as part of the compilation title \"Namco Gallery Vol. 2\", which also included \"Galaxian\", \"Dig Dug\" and \"Famista 4\". A 1997 Windows port was released as part of \"Namco History Vol. 2\", alongside several other early Namco arcade titles. In 2003, the Famicom version was re-released in Japan for the GameCube as a pre-order bonus for \"\". Several Japanese mobile phone ports were released, the first of these being a 2002 Java version, followed by an i-Mode release in 2003. In 2009, a digital version was released on the Wii Virtual Console as one of the four launch titles for the Virtual Console Arcade service, alongside \"Mappy\", \"Gaplus\" and \"Star Force\". The Famicom version was released onto the 3DS Virtual Console in December 2012, which was exclusive to Japan. \"Druaga\" would be included in several \"Namco Museum\" compilations, including \"Namco Museum Vol. 3\" (1996), \"Namco Museum Battle Collection\" (2005), \"Namco Museum Virtual Arcade\" (2009) and \"Namco Museum Switch\" (2017).\n\nIn Japan, \"The Tower of Druaga\" was an overwhelming critical success, attracting millions of fans with its use of puzzle-solving and action-oriented gameplay. It has been cited as an important landmark of the role-playing genre and helped lay the foundations for future titles. \"Druaga\" has been cited as influential to many other Japanese role-playing games, including \"Ys\", \"Hydlide\", \"Dragon Slayer\" and \"The Legend of Zelda\". \"Druaga\" also helped inspire the idea of note sharing with other players.\n\n\"The Tower of Druaga\" was met with a more negative reception in North America, many criticizing the game's controls, high difficulty and design. Reviewing the Wii Virtual Console port, Dan Whitehead of \"Eurogamer\" referred to the game's design as \"diabolically obtuse\" and criticized Gilgamesh's slow movement, notably with deflecting projectiles. Whitehead also criticized its hidden treasures for being too elusive and for only appealing towards dedicated players, although stated it was an interesting gameplay idea. Brett Alan Weiss of \"Allgame\" also criticized its hidden items, especially those required for later levels, as well as the player's \"wimpy\" attack and time limit. Lucas M. Thomas of IGN was the most critical of the game, lambasting its \"arbitrary, off the wall\" item requirements, slow pace and high difficulty, calling it \"woefully boring and pointless\" to play. He also noted that the player would need a walkthrough in order to fully beat it. In a 2003 interview, Endo stated he had somewhat regretted making the game as difficult as it is, noting that it might have made players more \"paranoid\" about finding secrets in games.\n\nThe success of \"The Tower of Druaga\" would spawn a wave of sequels and spin-off games, collectively known as the \"Babylonian Castle Saga\" series. The first was released in 1986, \"The Return of Ishtar\", which was based on the original prototype for \"Druaga\". It was developed by Endo's game company, Game Studio, and published by Namco in arcades. Taking place right after the events of the original, two players controlled Gilgamesh and Ki as they made their way to the bottom of Druaga's tower with the Blue Crystal Rod. In 1996 it was ported to the PlayStation as part of \"Namco Museum Vol. 4\". A Famicom prequel game, \"The Quest of Ki\", was released in 1988 — controlling Ki, the player was to make it to the top of Druaga's tower in search of the Blue Crystal rod, leading up to the events of the first game.\n\nA Super Famicom follow-up was released in 1994, \"The Blue Crystal Rod\", also known as \"The Destiny of Gilgamesh\". Gameplay was much different compared to earlier games, instead being a graphical adventure game with characters from the series. In 1996, two altered versions of the original game, \"Another Tower\" and \"Darkness Tower\", were included as hidden extras in \"Namco Museum Vol. 3\". They were made to be much harder than the original game and altered the requirements for finding the treasure. A Game Boy Color spin-off, \"Seme COM Dungeon: Drururuaga\", was released in 2000.\n\nIn 2004, Namco partnered with Arika to develop \"\" for the PlayStation 2, one of the few \"Babylonian Castle Saga\" games to be localized outside Japan. Part of the \"Mystery Dungeon\" series, the game is notorious for its extreme difficulty, where death would revoke all of the player's items and half of their money. An online-based arcade game was released in 2005, \"Druaga Online: The Story of Aon\", which was followed by a similar PC game in 2009, \"The Tower of Druaga: The Recovery of Babylim\". A spin-off game, \"The Labyrinth of Druaga\", was released for Japanese mobile phones on January 12, 2011.\n\nIn 1990, Namco produced a theme park attraction based on \"The Tower of Druaga\" for Expo '90 in Osaka, alongside \"\". After the show's conclusion, it was then moved to Namco's Wonder Eggs amusement park in Tokyo in 1992, remaining there until the park's closing on December 31, 2000. A sugoroku medal game was released for arcades in 2000, \"Sugoroku Adventure: The Tower of Druaga\", which also featured characters from Namco's \"Valkyrie\" series. Gilgamesh's red-striped shield and the Blue Crystal Rod appear as Sophita's alternative weapons in \"Soul Edge\". The GameCube game \"\" features a gamemode inspired by the game, titled \"The Hole of Druaga\". A Mii Fighter costume based on Gilgamesh was released for \"Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U\" in 2015.\n\nAn anime reboot series, \"The Tower of Druaga: The Aegis of Uruk\", was produced by Japanese studio Gonzo and premiering on April 4, 2008, taking place roughly 60 years after the events of the arcade game. It was followed by a sequel series, \"The Tower of Druaga: The Sword of Uruk\", premiering on January 8, 2009.\n"}
{"id": "1982146", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1982146", "title": "Beacon Hill, Burghclere, Hampshire", "text": "Beacon Hill, Burghclere, Hampshire\n\nBeacon Hill is near the village of Burghclere and Watership Down, in north Hampshire. The hill's name is derived from the fact that it was one of many Beacon Hills in England and beyond. This hill was once the site of the most famous beacon in Hampshire. It is 261 metres high and has one of England's most well known hill forts on its slopes, visible from the main A34 road which passes close by. From there, outstanding views of the surrounding area and much of Hampshire may be obtained. The site is open to the public and managed by Hampshire County Council. It is an biological Site of Special Scientific Interest called Burghclere Beacon and a Nature Conservation Review site, Grade I.\n\nBeacon Hill is a calcareous grassland chalk downland habitat and as such is scarce and home to some unusual and rare species. Many chalk grassland slopes in England show the mark of centuries of grazing by sheep, the slopes bearing a stepped appearance formed by a mixture of soil creep and sheep paths. Such erosion is clearly visible on the slopes of Beacon Hill.\n\nThe site includes an extensive stand of juniper \"Juniperus communis\", privet \"Ligustrum vulgare\", buckthorn \"Rhamnus catharticus\", rose \"Rosa spp.\", bramble \"Rubus spp.\", wayfaring tree \"Viburnum lantana\" and hawthorn (\"Crataegus monogyna\") and whitebeam \"Sorbus aria\", which covers circa 20 ha to the west-facing slopes. There is little evidence of juniper regeneration (and some moribund bushes) and the site is probably witnessing a transition from juniper to a mixed scrub community, with the early indications of an eventual succession of woodland. The scrub is unusual on the chalk in lacking a yew \"Taxus baccata\" and ash \"Fraxinus excelsior\" component.\n\nThe open grassland is rich in herbs, with fescues \"Festuca ovina\" and \"Festuca pratensis\", crested dog’s tail \"Cynosurus cristatus\", spring sedge \"Carex caryophyllea\", and locally quaking grass \"Briza media\" as dominants. Abundant herbs include ladys’ bedstraw \"Galium vernum\", hedge bedstraw \"Galium mollugo\", creeping thistle \"Cirsium acaule\", fairy flax \"Linum catharticum\", bird’s-foot trefoil \"Lotus corniculatus\", horseshoe vetch \"Hippocrepis comosa\", kidney vetch \"Anthyllis vulneraria\", chalk milkwort \"Polygala calcarea\" and felwort \"Gentianella amarella\" and several species of orchids. There is also Rock Rose, Wild Thyme, and Clustered Bellflower. These flowers in turn provide for rare invertebrates such as \"Osmia bicolor\", a scarce solitary bee. There is a decidedly neutral element in the flora which suggests that the soils may in part be derived from superficial drift or loess.\n\nIn a national survey carried out in the early 1970s, the chalk scrub element of the SSSI is recognised as being a nationally important example of a stage in the succession from juniper scrub to woodland. The chalk grassland within the SSSI includes a wide range of aspect and soils and in particular include chalk grassland developed on gradients which elsewhere have mostly been converted to arable or ley.\n\nThe hill fort on the top of the hill has never been systematically excavated, but the land and ditch are sharply defined and well preserved. The Beacon Hill camp, (scheduled ancient monument number 7) built around 1000 BC, was probably inhabited by around 2–3000 people according to calculations from similar camps. It is one of a number of hillforts, which are strung out along the north-facing scarp of the Hampshire Downs, overlooking the Kennet valley to the north. When originally built, these structures must have looked spectacular even from a distance as their white chalk ramparts caught the sun.\n\nWithin the ramparts of the fort are some fifteen contemporary hut sites comprising horseshoe shape scoops and circular enclosures, some of which can be seen by the casual visitor. The south-facing entrance is still well defined and a track would have led southwards towards an area of fields which are still apparent at the far end of the hill. Aerial photographs show considerable evidence of ancient field patterns throughout much of the surrounding countryside. On the west side of Sidown Hill (immediately to the west of Beacon Hill) there is an area of well defined field terracing.\n\nNorth of Beacon Hill there is a Bronze Age Bowl Barrow (scheduled ancient monument number 290) sited in a fir plantation and covered with trees.\n\n150 yards south of Beacon Hill Camp is a Bronze Age round Barrow (scheduled ancient monument number 318)\n\nOn the hill there are two lynchets halfway down the north slope, with a number of later hollow-ways encroaching upon them.\n\nThe beacon on the hill here passed the Hampshire warning on from the county to Cuckhamsiey Beacon in Berkshire. Nearby excavations revealed red brick and flint fireplace pottery, tobacco pipes amongst other items. This was presumably the site of a shelter hut for the men who watched the bonfire.\n\nThe tomb of the famous Egyptologist, George Herbert, 5th Earl of Carnarvon lies within the fortifications. It is also where Sir Geoffrey de Havilland made his first successful test flight on 10 September 1910, commemorated by a memorial stone situated in the Seven Barrows field to the south of Beacon Hill.\n\nThe site is located at , to the southwest of the village of Old Burghclere, in the county of Hampshire. The hill has a summit of 261m AOD. Nearby to the east lies Ladle Hill and further east is Watership Down. Also to the north east lies Old Burghclere Lime Quarry SSSI. The A34 runs between Beacon Hill and Ladle Hill to the east. To the west lies Sidown Hill.\n\n"}
{"id": "1982155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1982155", "title": "Alireza Jafarzadeh", "text": "Alireza Jafarzadeh\n\nAlireza Jafarzadeh is a media commentator on the Middle East and an active dissident figure to the Iranian government. He is best known for revealing the existence of clandestine nuclear facilities in Iran in 2002. At the time of the revelation, Jafarzadeh acted as the chief congressional liaison and public spokesperson for the United States representative office of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI). He is currently also the president of Strategic Policy Consulting, Inc., as well as a FOX News Foreign Affairs Analyst.\n\nJafarzadeh is also the author of a 304-paged book (\"The Iran Threat: President Ahmadinejad and the Coming Nuclear Crisis\") about Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the former President of Iran, and his alleged interest in developing nuclear weapons. He is also the U.S. representative of the People's Mujahedin of Iran.\n\nJafarzadeh was born in Mashhad, Iran where he finished his high school education. He then started his higher education in Metallurgical Engineering at Aryamehr University of Technology, which is now [Sharif University of Technology]. He moved to the United States before the 1979 Iranian Revolution. In the USA he studied civil engineering, obtaining his bachelor's degree from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, and a master's degree from the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nJafarzadeh has published columns and appeared on television interviews both on conservative as well as the liberal media. He seems to have bi-partisan respect for his work. Jafarzadeh has a regular column on the \"Huffington Post\". He has also widely published on the FoxNews.com. \nOn August 14, 2002, Jafarzadeh drew worldwide attention by revealing that Iran was running a secret nuclear facility in Natanz, and a dideuterium oxide facility in Arak. These revelations led to inspections of the sites by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). After their first inspection, IAEA, said in a report on Iran's nuclear activity that traces of uranium, greater than what is needed for a civilian power program, were found on Iranian nuclear equipment, although Iran claimed that the source of the uranium was from equipment imported to Iran from Pakistan. These revelations eventually led to United Nations Security Council's imposing sanctions on Iran on December 23, 2006, over its nuclear program.\n\nOn May 15, 2003, as spokesman for the NCRI, Jafarzadeh also alleged that Iran was running programs for biological and microbial weapons. On March 16, 2005, US President George W. Bush said Iran's hidden nuclear program had been discovered \"because a dissident group pointed it out to the world.\" Later that day, White House aides acknowledged that the dissident group cited by the president was the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI). On January 5, 2007, Jafarzadeh claimed that Iran's government had sharply increased its efforts to fan sectarian violence in Iraq, easily transferring money and arms across the Iraqi border. In his news conference, Jafarzadeh provided details of the Iranian forces, including the Quds Force, commanders, resources and plans for Iran sustaining a large-scale terror network in Iraq.\n\nOn September 9, 2010, Jafarzadeh made yet another significant revelation about a secret underground uranium enrichment facility under construction in Behjat-abad near Tehran where satellite imagery along with details of the program drew international attention.\n\nIn April 2011, in a press conference in Washington, D.C., Jafarzadeh revealed a new nuclear site, known as TABA, where Iran has been secretly building centrifuge parts. Iran had to concede to the existence of this site two days later.\n\nIn July 2011, in an exclusive interview with the Associated Press in Washington, D.C., Jafarzadeh exposed for the first time the reorganization of Iran's nuclear program and the formation of a new organization run by the Defense Ministry, known by its Persian acronym, SPND, which oversees all nuclear weaponization work under the direct supervision of Iran's top nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh Mahabadi. The information was compiled by the network inside Iran of Iran's opposition group, the MEK. This information provided by Jafarzadeh was later reflected in the November 2011 report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\n\nIn April 2012, in an article in the Baltimore Sun, Jafarzadeh exposed further details about Iran forming a new organization under the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp to concentrate all the activities of the nuclear program to accelerate its bomb making.\n\nIn November 2014, in a press conference in the Washington office of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, Jafarzadeh revealed that Iran had built 2 explosive chambers, not one as previously believed; that Saeed Borji is the key person responsible for explosive chambers design and installation at Parchin military site in southeast Tehran; that Ukrainian expert Vycheslav V. Danilenko was directly involved in design and installation of the explosive chamber; his son-in-law was part of the project when in Iran; and that Tehran used various covers to conceal its nuclear weaponization activities, and the main organization (SPND) under the direction of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh formed by the Defense Ministry in 2011 to overtake all nuclear weapons related activities is actually heading all such projects in Parchin. This new information showed that Iran actively pursued weaponization way past 2006 and has sought foreign expertise, companies, and constantly changed cover to hide its nuclear weapons program.\n\nIn February 2015, in a high-profile press conference in the National Press Building, Jafarzadeh revealed that Iran has a hidden site, known as Lavizan-3, in a military complex in Tehran, where Iran has worked on research and development of advanced centrifuges, including IR-2m, and secretly enriched uranium in violation of the Joint Plan of Action. Members of Congress asked Secretary John Kerry about Lavizan-3, which he promised to follow up, but there are no follow up reports in the media, suggesting that the United States or the IAEA has acted on this.\n\nOn January 15, 2007, Jafarzadeh was a guest on CNN's \"Lou Dobbs Tonight\" news show (6:00 pm ET) discussing Iran's proxy war in Iraq. Jafarzadeh claimed that Iran has 32,000 mercenaries on its payroll in Iraq sabotaging the reconstruction and stabilization efforts.\n\nAs late as December 14, 2006, Jafarzadeh was introduced as the past representative of the National Council of Resistance of Iran in an interview with Claude Salhani in which he responded to comments by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad made towards Israel.\n\nAs of 2010, Jafarzadeh is a Foreign Affairs Analyst for Fox News, a position he has held since 2003 and is often a guest on Voice of America, or ABC Radio Network's \"John Batchelor Show\". He has lectured at Georgetown University and the University of Michigan. He currently lives and works in Washington, D.C. in the United States.\n\nAccording to his official website, \"Jafarzadeh has frequently appeared on major television and radio broadcasts\", including Fox News Channel, CNN, MSNBC, CBS Evening News, NBC, ABC, BBC, Sky News, ITN, VOA, and NPR.\n\nOn September 24, 2008, Jafarzadeh appeared on foxnews.com \"The Strategy Room\" with host Heather Nauert, to discuss Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's UN appearance.\n\nOn 20 March 2009, Jafarzadeh appeared on CBS Evening News commenting on President Barack Obama's New Year Nowrouz message to the Iranian people.\n\nIn June 2009, in the morning of the presidential elections, Jafarzadeh appeared on national television, including Fox News Channel and predicted that Ahmadinejad would be declared the winner of the election, in sharp contrast to the views of almost all other prominent Iran experts.\n\nIn February 2010, Jafarzadeh appeared on Fox News Channel suggesting that nuclear negotiations with Tehran would not succeed and that Ahmadinejad would become bolder, unless the international community would exploit what he described as extensive potential for change in Iran.\n\nIn March 2012, in an interview with Geraldo at Large on Fox News, Jafarzadeh appeared with Governor Bill Richardson discussing the prospects of Iran policy and what needs to be done to counter the Iranian threat.\n\nIn April 2012, in a commentary in the Huffington Post, Jafarzadeh argued that the nuclear talks are doomed to lead to nowhere, as Tehran's agenda is to buy time while building the bomb.\n\nIn May 2012, Jafarzadeh, in a commentary in the McClatchy News highlighted the need to counter the Iranian nuclear threat, arguing that over thirty years of concessions made to Tehran has been counterproductive.\n\nIn December 2013, regarding the nuclear talks that had just started, in a commentary in the \"Baltimore Sun\", he warned about the Iranian regime's true intentions.\n\nIn April 2015, he published in \"The Hill\" arguing that it is time for Congress to act in light of Iranian regime's delay tactics during the nuclear negotiations.\n\nJafarzadeh heads his own company, Strategic Policy Consulting, Inc., (SPC) where he consults as an expert on the nuclear program of Iran, terrorism, and Islamic extremism.\n\nSPC was formed in October 2003 and its website lists an address at 1717 Pennsylvania Ave. N.W. Suite 1025. According to the SPC website, its members have worked professionally with the US Congress, media, agencies, institutions and universities in order to deliver analysis, policy suggestions, and research for more than 10 years.\n\nJafarzadeh's association with the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) which is associated with the People's Mujahedin of Iran (Mujahedin-e Khalq, MEK, PMOI, or MKO) was a source of controversy for some time. Jafarzadeh was the public spokesperson for the National Council of Resistance of Iran until its office in Washington was closed by the US State Department in 2003 on the grounds that it was too closely associated with the People's Mujahedin of Iran, which is listed as a terrorist organisation by the US State Department.\n\nJafarzadeh's name appeared in the media in a \"Houston Chronicle\" article dated December 24, 1986, where he is described as a spokesman for the MEK. In the article he denied US State Department claims that the MEK was a terrorist organization responsible for the assassination of at least six Americans in Iran, a charge that is vehemently denied by MEK. In the same article, Jafarzadeh compared the MEK's resistance activities to those of the US Founding Fathers.\n\nThe Bush administration identified the MEK as being a terrorist organization supported by Saddam Hussein. Controversy erupted when it was revealed that John Ashcroft, a Senator at the time, had pushed for the delisting of the organization as a terrorist group after extensive lobbying efforts by Jafarzadeh. The designation was removed in 2012 as a result of a decision by then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. MEK members in Iraq had been disarmed after the Iraq War. The decision was made after the organization agreed to help with removal of its members from Camp Ashraf in Iraq and their resettlement to other countries.\n"}

Trinità - was an Italian Roman Catholic priest and the founder of both the Vocationist Fathers and the Vocationist Sisters as well as the Apostles of Universal Sanctification. Russolillo served lifelong in Pianura where he was born and dedicated his life to cultivating the vocations of those around him and leading men and women either to the priesthood or to the religious life.\n\nRussolillo was beatified under Pope Benedict XVI in mid-2011 and it was Cardinal Angelo Amato who beatified the late priest on the behalf of the pope.\n\nGiustino Russolillo was born in Pianura in 1891 as the third of ten children to Luigi Russolillo and Giuseppina Simpatia. He was baptized the date after his birth due to exceptional snowfall that prevented them from going down to the local parish. While his name in the parish register was recorded as Giustino his civic record had his name recorded as \"Giustino Pietro Orazio\". His sister was Giovanna - who joined his female order - and his brother was a doctor who helped tend to him in his final month.\n\nHe received his First Communion in 1896 and received private instruction from his paternal aunts as well as Father Orazio Guillaro instructing him in Latin. Once he completed his studies in Pozzuoli to become a priest - he was there since 1901 - he was ordained as such on 20 September 1913. On his ordination he vowed to establish a religious congregation for promoting vocations to the priesthood and to religious life. On 30 April 1914 - with a group of men that had been in formation (as a seminarian he used to teach catechism in his town and he found in some of them some true signs of vocation and continued to give them formation even after becoming a priest) - he tried to set up a small group dedicated to this but this did not last too long.\n\nHe was appointed as the parish priest of San Giorgio's church in Pianura in 1920 and took possession of it on 20 September. On 18 October 1920 he started the Vocationist Fathers and on 2 October 1921 also founded the Vocationist Sisters. The Vocationist Fathers received diocesan approval on 26 May 1927. On 18 January 1931 he made his vows into the order to the Bishop of Capaccio Francesco Cammarota and assumed his new name. The Vocationist Sisters became an order of pontifical right on 24 May 1947 and the Vocationist Fathers became one as such on 3 January 1948. But before these two approvals could be given both orders needed an official apostolic visit: Father Raffaele Baldini of the Servants of Mary undertook one in 1941 and then the Franciscan Serafino Cuomo undertook the second in 1945 after the end of World War II. In 1950 he sent three priests to the missions in Brazil to open a branch of the order there.\n\nIn spring 1955 he collapsed several times due to ill health and - on the advice of Doctor De Simone - did not lead the procession for the Corpus Christi on 9 June and on 16 July was instructed by Doctor Cataldi to rest at the Monaldi Hospital in Naples; but from 20–27 July he visited novices from his orders with Father Raffaele Castiglione. A blood test taken a short time later confirmed that he was dying from leukemia and his mother Giuseppina and his sister rushed from Rome to be with him around this point; he was hospitalized on 1 August.\n\nRussolillo died from leukemia on 2 August 1955 in Pianura at 9:10pm after receiving the Last Rites. His remains were later reinterred on 14 April 1956 in the motherhouse of the Vocationist Fathers at Pianura. Russolillo's orders now serves in places such as Latin America (like Brazil and Ecuador) and Africa (like South Africa and Nigeria) as well as in the United States of America.\n\nThe beatification process commenced on 15 December 1977 under Pope Paul VI after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \"nihil obstat\" to the cause and titled the late Russolillo as a Servant of God while transferring the location of the beatification process from Pozzuoli to Naples on 7 July 1978. Cardinal Corrado Ursi oversaw the inauguration of the cognitional process on 18 January 1980 and then its conclusion on 13 May 1985; the C.C.S. validated the process in Rome on 23 January 1986 and then received the Positio dossier from the postulation in 1991.\n\nTheologians approved the dossier on 7 February 1997 while the C.C.S. did likewise on 18 December 1997. Pope John Paul II named Russolillo as being Venerable on 18 December 1997 after he confirmed that the late priest lived a life of heroic virtue. The process for a miracle spanned from 16 March 2005 to 14 November 2005 and was validated on 9 March 2007 before receiving the approval of a medical board on 18 June 2009 and that of theologians on 12 December 2009; the C.C.S. followed suit on 1 June 2010.

{"id": "1982180", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1982180", "title": "Shriek (character)", "text": "Shriek (character)\n\nShriek (Frances Louise Barrison) is a fictional character, a supervillainess appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. She is usually depicted as an enemy of Spider-Man, and the lover of Cletus Kasady.\n\nNaomie Harris will portray the character in the upcoming film \"\" set in Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters.\n\nShriek first appeared in \"Spider-Man Unlimited\" Volume 1, #1 (May 1993) and was created by Tom DeFalco, Mike W. Barr, Terry Kavanagh, Ron Lim, Jerry Bingham, and Mark Bagley.\n\nShriek is a dangerous and criminally insane villainess with the ability to manipulate sound. During the events of \"Maximum Carnage\", she allied herself with Carnage and several other supervillains who went about New York on a killing spree.\n\nShriek's origins and real name were, at first, uncertain. She was named Sandra Deel in her earliest appearances, but named Frances Louise Barrison in later appearances. According to the \"Spider-Man Encyclopedia\", she was born Frances Louise Barrison, but used Sandra Deel as an alias.\n\nDuring her childhood, Frances was abused by her mother for being overweight, driving her to drugs and leading to her later fixation on becoming a mother herself. She became a drug dealer, which exposed her to situations that ultimately damaged her sanity; namely, being shot in the head by a police officer, and being put in Cloak's Darkforce Dimension, which awakened Shriek's latent mutant abilities.\n\nShriek debuted at the start of the \"Maximum Carnage\" crossover. During Carnage's violent escape from the Ravencroft mental institution, he came across Shriek, who was also incarcerated and wished to join him. He freed her, and the pair embarked on a killing spree. They attracted the company of several other homicidal supervillains (Demogoblin, Doppelganger, and Carrion), and formed a \"family,\" with Carnage and Shriek as the \"parents\" and the others as their \"sons\". (Although it is clearly obvious that Shriek had love for Carnage, it is uncertain whether he felt the same for her; it is implied many times that he did.) Shriek also used her mental powers to increase the chaos by causing a number of New Yorkers to violently turn on one another, although the heroes were able to calm the people down before they did anything too serious, such as killing their own children. The killers fought a number of heroes, led by Spider-Man, but succumbed to in-fighting. Carnage slew the Doppelganger and left the others to their defeat and capture, although he was subsequently contained by the Avengers after a clash with Spider-Man, Venom and Black Cat.\n\nIn the aftermath, Shriek is returned to Ravencroft, but escapes her cell by short-circuiting her power dampening unit. Shriek frees fellow inmates Gale, Webber, Pyromania, and Mayhem, and together they try to break out of the facility, opposed by Spider-Man and John Jameson. While distracted by Spider-Man, Shriek is knocked out with a tranquilizer gun by Jameson.\nWhen Dr. Ashley Kafka brings Malcolm McBride near Shriek's cell, Shriek recognizes Malcolm as her \"son\" Carrion, breaks out of her room, and escapes from Ravencroft with Malcolm. Agitated by Malcolm's refusal to acknowledge her as his mother, Shriek becomes violent towards him, and uses her powers to turn him back into Carrion after an encounter with Spider-Man, who Shriek plans on making her new \"husband\" after sensing a growing darkness within him. In an attempt to make Carrion fully embrace her as his mother, Shriek takes him to Beatrice McBride, the biological mother of Malcolm, with the intent of having Carrion murder the woman. The duo are tracked by Spider-Man, and in the ensuing brawl, Shriek abandons her plans to convert Spider-Man to her side, and forces Carrion to choose between her and Beatrice. The distraught Carrion instead begins to commit suicide with his own powers, which Beatrice tries to stop, stating, \"Do you think my life matters? Do you think I wouldn't sacrifice myself a thousand times over to save my child?\" when Shriek tells her that she will be killed by contact with Carrion. Touched, Shriek absorbs the Carrion virus, incapacitating herself, and turning Carrion back into Malcolm.\n\nShriek is readmitted to Ravencroft, where the dormant Carrion virus (which she had been treating like an unborn child) is extracted from her by the Jackal. Later, Shriek is brought on as a juror in Judas Traveller's mock trial of Spider-Man in the basement of Ravencroft. Shriek and the other members of the jury deem Spider-Man guilty of ruining lives and creating supervillains, but before they can execute their sentence of death they are returned to their cells and have their memories altered by Traveller.\nShe appears in \"\" as one of the villains in the Bar With No Name. After Carnage is returned to Earth by Hall Industries, the company purchases Ravencroft with the intention of using Shriek (who had been responding well to the treatment being administered to her by Doctor Tanis Nieves) as a power source for the Carnage symbiote, which had been separated from Cletus Kasady. Shriek is brought to Hall Industries, where exposure to the Carnage symbiote, coupled with her witnessing guards beating Doppelganger (who had been attempting to rescue her) causes her to snap, and return to homicidal mania. After Cletus reunites with his symbiote, Shriek and Doppelganger aid him in causing chaos throughout New York City, with Shriek gaining additional powers from another symbiote (which gives her a third arm, and covers half of her face) that Carnage's had spawned. Growing fearful of Shriek, the symbiote leaves her in favor of Nieves, its initial host, to create Scorn, who forces Shriek to use her powers to weaken Carnage, allowing Spider-Man and Iron Man to defeat him. In the aftermath, Shriek is shown to be in a coma, Scorn having done some unspecified damage to her brain.\n\nShriek regains consciousness, and is recruited by Caroline le Fay to battle the Fearless Defenders as a member of the new Doom Maidens. After the Doom Maidens are disbanded, Shriek reunites with Carnage, and saves him from Deadpool in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The two killers flee pursued by Deadpool, who crashes their car with a combine harvester, severely injuring Shriek, and enraging Carnage. Carnage flings Deadpool away, and escapes to the base of the Mercury Team (who he kills) with the unconscious Shriek. Carnage, troubled by Deadpool making him question his nihilistic beliefs, then has Shriek help him break into a psychiatric hospital, where they try to force the patients and staff to answer Carnage's questions about being controlled by higher powers, a concept which disgusts Carnage. Deadpool, who has bonded to the Mercury Team's symbiotes, uses his new shapeshifting abilities to disorient Shriek, causing her to run off. After a skirmish with Carnage, Deadpool captures Shriek, uses his symbiotes to disguise her as himself, and tricks the already distraught Carnage into nearly killing her, causing Carnage (who believes his attacking Shriek was \"foreshadowed\" by the higher powers) to suffer a mental breakdown. Shriek is hospitalized, and Carnage willingly allows himself to be arrested.\n\nShriek recovered, and was hired onto the Sinister Sixteen by Boomerang and the Owl. After being manipulated and abandoned by Boomerang, Shriek and three other members of the Sinister Sixteen sought revenge on him in the Bar With No Name, only to be defeated by him, Beetle, Overdrive, and Speed Demon.\n\nShriek subsequently attacks a police station with Gibbon, Griffin, and Ruby Thursday. The quartet is subdued by Spider-Woman's apprentice Porcupine.\n\nDetroit-based supervillain Nain Rouge afterward hires Shriek and a new Firebrand to be his enforcers, bringing them into conflict with the Great Lakes Avengers.\n\nShriek later appeared as a secret ally to Kraven the Hunter at the time he was leading the NYPD's SWAT Team into hunting the Dinosaur People living beneath New York City ever since they were created by Stegron. She made herself known where she used her sonic attack on Venom and then collapsed the ceiling on him much to Kraven the Hunter's annoyance. Shriek stated to Kraven that he can have the head of Eddie Brock after their mission. Venom catches up to Kraven the Hunter and fights him and Shriek. With help from Tana, Venom stated that the Dinosaur People weren't killing anybody and that they are only surviving underground. Kraven the Hunter and Shriek are arrested by the NYPD.\n\nShriek eventually reunites with Carnage and Doppelganger again and together formed a cult dedicated in worshiping Knull. They eventually return to Doverton and got the codexes–the symbiote remnants left on the bodies of previous hosts–from the citizens who were infected by Carnage.\n\nBeing a mutant and following exposure to Cloak's Dimension, Shriek has the ability to manipulate sound in a number of elaborate ways. She can harness it for destructive concussive force or use it to disorient and agitate her enemies. She can apparently hypersonically induce intense emotion in those around her (generating fear, hate, or despair). She also has moderate powers of levitation that she can use to make herself fly and possibly some low level of psionic ability.\n\nShe is able to sense the darkest side to a person's psyche so that she can use her powers to specifically manipulate that person's emotions. Her scarred left eye is also prone to glow whenever she uses her powers. Why only that eye glows is uncertain.\n\nDuring the \"Secret Wars\", in a world of zombified characters, a zombie Shriek worked with zombie Mystique deep in the Deadlands and was amongst the zombies who were attacked by Ulysses Bloodstone after Deadpool, who acted as a source of meat, was destroyed. Later, she attempted to recapture a child named \"Shuttup\" after she had been rescued and was with Mystique during the fight between Elsa Bloodstone and Ulysses. She is seemingly killed along with the rest of the zombie hoard.\n\nShriek appears in \"Spider-Man: Heroes & Villains Collection\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The mill has many paintings by the local artist David Hockney on display and also provides offices for Pace plc. \n\nThe Mill and surrounding town of Saltaire was financed and built by the 19th century industrialist and philanthropist Sir Titus Salt after he observed other textile factories and was disappointed by the working conditions he saw there. At the time mill working conditions were commonly poor, with most workers suffering disease, low wages and labour exploitation. Dangerous machinery and long hours, sometimes exceeding 16 hour working days, resulted in frequent accidents. Titus Salt acknowledged this and built a factory and surrounding town with which he intended to improve the working conditions for his employees. When completed, the mill was the largest industrial building in the world by total floor area. It is a grade II* listed building. The mill closed in 1986 and the following year it was sold to Jonathan Silver, who began a long renovation scheme.\n\nThe spellings \"Salts Mill\" and \"Salt's Mill\" (that is, with and without an apostrophe) are both commonly used.

{"id": "1982189", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1982189", "title": "Surface effect ship", "text": "Surface effect ship\n\nA Surface Effect Ship (SES) or Sidewall Hovercraft is a watercraft that has both an air cushion, like a hovercraft, and twin hulls, like a catamaran. When the air cushion is in use, a small portion of the twin hulls remain in the water. When the air cushion is turned off (\"off-cushion\" or \"hull borne\"), the full weight of the vessel is supported by the buoyancy of the twin hulls.\n\nThe SES has two advantages over a hovercraft for open sea operation: it is more resistant to slipping sideways when acted on by air or sea, and it can use water jets for propulsion since the inlet nozzles are always covered by water.\n\nThe United States Navy initiated the SES model test program in 1960. By 1963, a 10-ton test craft called the XR-1 was designed and built to test the surface effect concept. The first version of the XR-1 used fixed plywood seals at the and ends of the captured air bubble section. A jet engine providing 1700 pounds of thrust was used for main propulsion. A separate gas engine was used to drive lift fans, and also to power out-drive units that were used for off-cushion slow-speed maneuvering. During the first year of testing, the XR-1 was fitted with more powerful main propulsion and flexible fore and aft seals were tested as well.\n\nThe XR-1 was also used to test the concept of water-jet propulsion. The ship was modified in 1964 and equipped with gas turbine engines driving the water jet propulsors. The ship's weight increased to 17 tons.\n\nRohr Industries became involved in SES history in 1970, taking over the XR-1 test program for the Navy. Rohr continued to use the XR-1 to test propulsion and seal concepts. Their eventual goal was to develop a 3000-ton (3,050 tonne) SES, the \"LSES\" (\"L\"arge \"S\"urface \"E\"ffect \"S\"hip), capable of utilizing vertical launch missile systems and anti-submarine helicopters & various VTOL aircraft. The proposed ship was to be capable of 80 knots in sea-state 6 conditions. The proposed main power units were to be 4 40,000hp gas turbine engines driving water jet propulsors. The 3000-ton ship development contract was canceled in 1980.\n\nTwo experimental SESs (the SES-100A and 100B), both of around 100 tons, with 80 ft (24 m) length and 40 ft (12 m) beams, were developed for the US Military in the 1960s and 70s. They both attained speeds in excess of the program goal of 80 knots (150 km/h). The SES 100B, was built by Bell Aerospace (Textron Corporation) at the NASA Michoud Assembly Facility. Driven by 2 semi-submerged, supercavitating controllable, reversible propellers, achieved speeds in excess of 96 knots (approximately 110 mph) in the Gulf outside St. Andrews Bay in Panama City, Florida.\n\nThe speed was verified by the USAF ARIS radar. It also fired the Navy's first vertically launched missile (an SM-2) while doing 60 knots (110 km/h). It was also used to test automatic ride control and high speed collision avoidance and navigation systems. The 100A ship was used to test waterjet propulsion, variable geometry inlets and automatic ride control systems. The 100A and 100B were both capable of operating almost completely out of the water on an air cushion with only 18in (46 cm) of sidewall, the propellers or the waterjet inlets entering the water. The 100-ton SES 100B was built for the US Navy as a 1/10 scale model to test the feasibility of using hovercraft and other Surface Effect Ships in combat situations. The top-secret specifications called for a ship capable of entering a combat zone at a speed of over 80 knots (150 km/h) and disgorging a tank and 100 soldiers onto a beach, turning back out onto water and escaping at high speed.\n\nUnlike the hard sidewall SES's, the full skirted AALCs, JEFF A&B were the prototype vehicles for the LCAC's used by the Navy with such success in the Persian Gulf War.\n\nThe 3000-ton SES concept was never designed to go up on the beach, like a landing craft. The AALC (Amphibious Assault Landing Craft) and the SES were very different concepts from the beginning. The AALC was a pure hovercraft that is capable of high-speed insertion of troops and vehicles onto a beach. As a hovercraft, the LCAC, derived from the AALC has no rigid hull parts that extend past the air cushion. It therefore can operate across the beach. The SES has rigid side hulls that enclose the air cushion, permitting water propulsion but allowing it to only go to the shore when conducting amphibious operations. Design concepts for a 6000-plus-ton cargo SES's that Rohr and Ingalls Shipbuilding proposed relied on the idea of the ship loading and unloading from beach, lighter, causeway or conventional dock facilities.\nOn 10 November 1972 contracts were let to four firms to conduct 2200-ton prototype preliminary design; these designs were to be completed in August 1973. The prime contractors were Bell, Aerojet, Litton, and Lockheed.\n\nThe UK based company Hovermarine developed the HM.2 SES ferry at their factory in Woolston, Southampton in the 1960s. The first HM-2 craft was operated by Seaspeed in 1968 between Ryde Pier and Portsmouth Harbour. The early HM2 suffered from mechanical problems and during a financial crisis in 1969, Hovermarine went into voluntary liquidation and the major assets were acquired by a new company, Hovermarine Transport Ltd, this was subsequently taken over by the American company, Transportation Technology Inc. Production of HM.2s for North and Central America was undertaken by Hovermarine's factory at Titusville, Florida. A brief trial of 2 HM.2 took place in Toronto from July to late fall 1974 to Niagara-on-the-Lake to Youngstown, New York. The service managed by Can-Am Hover Express used two craft, Toryoung I and Toryoung II, but an accident with the latter craft led to the demise of the service.\n\nOver 110 HM.2's were manufactured in the United Kingdom and United States.\n\nCurrently SESs are used, primarily as small ferries.\nThe Soviet Navy built two 1050-ton Bora class surface effect corvettes. The ships were passed on to the Russian Navy and remain in active service with the Black Sea Fleet.\n\nUmoe Mandal built 9 Alta and Oksøy class surface effect vessels for mine warfare for the Royal Norwegian Navy. The Norwegian Navy also operates six Skjold class surface effect patrol boats. These ships are the fastest warships in the world with service speeds of . The prototype ( Skjold) was leased and tested for one year by the US Navy.\n\nHSwMS Smyge, which acted as a small-scale pre-prototype testbed for the Visby-class corvette is now used as a training platform for Swedish Amphibious Corps Clearance divers\n\n"}
{"id": "1982191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1982191", "title": "Keel-billed toucan", "text": "Keel-billed toucan\n\nThe keel-billed toucan (\"Ramphastos sulfuratus\"), also known as sulfur-breasted toucan or rainbow-billed toucan, is a colorful Latin American member of the toucan family. It is the national bird of Belize. The species is found in tropical jungles from southern Mexico to Colombia. It is an omnivorous forest bird that feeds on fruits, seeds, insects, invertebrates, lizards, snakes, and small birds and their eggs.\n\nTwo subspecies are recognized:\n\nIncluding its bill, the keel-billed toucan ranges in length from around . Their large and colorful bill averages around , about one-third of its length. It typically weighs about . While the bill seems large and cumbersome, it is in fact a spongy, hollow bone covered in keratin, a very light and hard protein.\n\nThe plumage of the keel-billed toucan is mainly black with a yellow neck and chest. Molting occurs once per year. It has blue feet and red feathers at the tip of its tail. The bill is mainly green with a red tip and orange sides.\n\nKeel-billed toucans have zygodactyl feet (or feet with toes facing in different directions) – two toes face forward and two face back. Because toucans spend a large portion of time in the trees, this helps the birds to stay on the branches of the trees and jump from one branch to another.\n\nThe keel-billed toucan can be found from Southern Mexico to Venezuela and Colombia. It roosts in the canopies of tropical, subtropical, and lowland rainforests, up to altitudes of . It roosts in holes in trees, often with several other toucans. This can be very cramped, so the birds tuck their tails and beaks under their bodies to conserve space while sleeping. Adding to the lack of space, the bottoms of the holes are often covered with pits from the fruit the toucans have eaten.\n\nLike many toucans, keel-billed toucans are very social birds, rarely seen alone. They fly in small flocks of approximately six to twelve individuals through lowland rainforests. Their flight is slow and undulating, consisting of rapid wing beats (six to ten), then a glide with the bird's beak extending forward and dipping downward as though pulling the rest of the bird. Their feet are drawn up forward in flight. The flight distances are typically short. They live together in groups, often sharing cramped living quarters of holes in trees. There is a family structure within the group. Birds often \"duel\" with each other using their bills, and throw fruit into each other's mouths. They 'play ball', one throwing a fruit in the air and a second seizing it.\nThe female keel-billed toucan will lay 1–4 white eggs in a natural or already-made tree cavity. The male and female share in the caring of the eggs, both taking turns incubating. The eggs hatch approximately 15–20 days after being laid. After hatching, the male and female again take turns feeding the chicks. When the chicks hatch, they have no feathers, and have their eyes closed for approximately 3 weeks. The chicks have adequately formed heel pads, which assist on the pit-covered bottom of the nest. The chicks stay in their nest for approximately eight to nine weeks while their bills develop fully and they are ready to fledge from the nest.\n\nThe diet of keel-billed toucans consists mostly of a wide range of fruit, but may also include insects, eggs, nestlings and lizards. The bill, surprisingly dexterous, allows this toucan to utilize a large variety of fruit that might not otherwise be reached. When eating the fruit, it uses its bill to dissect the fruit, and then tosses its head back to swallow the fruit whole.\n\nThe keel-billed toucan is sometimes kept in captivity, but it requires a high-fruit diet and is sensitive to hemochromatosis (an iron storage disease).\n\nAble to utilize human-altered habitat to some extent, this widespread bird is considered to be a Species of Least Concern by the IUCN. However, they are still threatened by hunting for their meat and beaks, and toucan populations are on a decreasing trend.\n\n"}
{"id": "1982193", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1982193", "title": "Harvey Bullock (character)", "text": "Harvey Bullock (character)\n\nHarvey Bullock () is a fictional detective appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, commonly in association with the superhero Batman. The character first appeared in \"Detective Comics\" #441 (June 1974) and was created by Archie Goodwin and Howard Chaykin. He debuted in live action in 2014 on Fox's television series \"Gotham\", where he was portrayed by Donal Logue.\n\nThere is some ambiguity concerning the character's origins. Writer Doug Moench and artist Don Newton introduced Harvey Bullock in \"Batman\" #361 (July 1983) as a device to resolve the ongoing plotline with Gotham City's corrupt mayor Hamilton Hill, and subsequent \"Who's Who in the DC Universe\" entries acknowledged this as Bullock's first appearance. However, in later years Batman fans began pointing out that a \"Lt. Bullock\" appeared in three panels of \"Detective Comics\" #441 (1974), written by Archie Goodwin, pencilled by Howard Chaykin, and published almost a decade before. Moench admitted that he must have read this comic because he is an Archie Goodwin fan, but denied that Harvey Bullock is the same character. He argued that it is unlikely that he drew on Goodwin's Lt. Bullock even unconsciously, since there are discrepancies of both personality and continuity between his character and Goodwin's, and he distinctly remembers taking the name \"Bullock\" from guitarist Hiram Bullock. Archie Goodwin is legally Harvey Bullock's sole creator; Moench said he decided not to contest this because he did not want to make a case against Goodwin's widow Anne Goodwin, whom he considers a friend.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the Hamilton Hill storyline, Moench decided he enjoyed writing Harvey Bullock enough to keep him on as a supporting character, which necessitated some softening of his original characterization as a corrupt cop. Bullock was one of several Batman supporting cast members swept out of the Batman family of titles when Denny O'Neil became the Batman editor in 1986, but in 1987 writer Paul Kupperberg brought him into the \"Vigilante\" cast. Kupperberg recalled, \"Harvey Bullock was a character very much in my wheelhouse, a wise-cracking loudmouth with a Brooklyn accent and a problem with authority, although he wasn't originally intended to be a permanent member of the \"Vigilante\" cast. He was brought in for a guest-shot, as a character to help Vigilante's handler, Harry Stein, grease the wheels in Gotham City for them on whatever case they were on. I had fun writing him, and the interaction between Harvey and Harry Stein, another slob with his own way of doing things, clicked. I don't think they were using him much, if at all, in the Batman books by then, so we got permission from the Bat-office to have the character on semi-permanent loan for \"Vigilante\" and its successor title, \"Checkmate\".\"\n\nPrior to the 1985-1986 DC maxi-series \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", Bullock is a crooked police detective under instructions from Gotham City's Mayor Hamilton Hill to sabotage Commissioner Gordon's career when he is formally re-introduced in Batman #361, cover dated July 1983, in the story entitled \"The Most Successful Species\", written by Doug Moench and penciled by Don Newton. His method of doing so is to pretend to be exceedingly clumsy, thereby spoiling whatever Gordon is trying to do, seemingly accidentally. After inadvertently giving Gordon a heart attack, however, Bullock turns over a new leaf. His character later develops into a well-meaning cop who (probably) \"is\" exceedingly clumsy, similar to the later animated version. He also forms a close bond with Robin, based initially on their mutual love of old movies. Subsequent to this, he is a Bishop in the spy organization Checkmate.\n\nFollowing the continuity changes brought about in most of DC's comics by \"Crisis\", Bullock is perhaps the most controversial police officer in the Gotham City Police Department. His colleagues in the Major Crimes Unit will swear up and down that he is a good cop, despite his reputation for taking bribes, using excessive force, and having ties to organized crime. He is not without endearing qualities, however, including a fondness for doughnuts and a hidden sentimental streak. He also has a brief relationship with a widow he meets at work.\n\nThis new post-\"Crisis\" Bullock was retconned as having been loyal to Gordon from the start. Even before he is promoted to detective, he stays by Gordon during one of the Joker's rampages, saving his life. Eventually, without Batman's assistance, Bullock and Gordon stop the Joker from causing an explosion that would have leveled Gotham City. During the entire case, Bullock plays the part of the \"bad cop,\" intimidating and threatening whoever gets in his way. At this point, Bullock still wears a regular police uniform.\n\nSeveral years later, Bullock is made detective. He again works closely with Gordon, as part of a small crew of people Gordon knows he can trust. This group includes Maggie Sawyer, Harvey Dent, and Detective Cohen as they try to bring down Sal Maroni. Though Gordon knows of and has recordings of Bullock's brutality against suspects, he brings him in because the man has never accepted bribes. The events surrounding this squad work around the events of \"\". Bullock and the group are then joined by Crispus Allen, they take down a gathering of Gotham's \"freaks\", such as the Joker, Clayface and Scarecrow. Later Bullock is partnered with Renee Montoya and they both become very loyal to each other. For a time Bullock works with the international spy agency Checkmate. They confront threats ranging from counterfeiters to cult-terrorists. He has a rocky relationship with those above him, such as defying intelligence expert Amanda Waller over the proposed murder of heroic vigilante Black Thorn.\n\nBullock also gained his own story arc, \"A Bullet for Bullock\" by Chuck Dixon. The story is about someone trying to kill him, which was also adapted into an episode for \"\".\n\nBullock is on the front lines during the \"Knightfall\" storyline when Arkham empties and its inmates riot through the streets. Bullock takes control when Riddler takes an entire talk show hostage. He is almost obliterated by a bomb planted in the mayor's mansion; he is saved at the last second by Batman.\n\nDuring the \"Trioka\" arc, Bullock is badly injured during a confrontation with the KGBeast, who has gained control of a small nuclear weapon. Robin and several members of the Gotham City Police Department brave a burning chemical plant, partly to save his life. Bullock almost dies during this incident, but is saved by CPR administered by Robin. Mackenzie \"Hardback\" Bock, a newcomer to the force, becomes involved, helping Robin carry Harvey out of harm's way. The nuclear bomb is then neutralized by Batman.\n\nIn the \"\" storyline, Bullock is confronting Anarky in a shopping mall when an earthquake hits Gotham City. Both save their own lives by diving into a hollow art structure. Despite this, Bullock's arm is impaled by a tube of metal. He does not let this stop him, and makes his way back to the badly damaged police headquarters.\n\nAs soon as he learns Gordon is missing, he slams his arm against a wall, knocking out the bar, and institutes a search. Bullock finds and saves a rattled Gordon from the debris of his own office.\n\nA few weeks later, Gotham is shut down and closed off by the government in the incident known as \"No Man's Land\". Bullock and several other officers, Renee included, willingly stay behind to assist Gordon. Bullock sticks by Gordon through the death of many fellow officers. When SWAT leader Billy Pettit revolts and takes even more officers with him, Bullock sticks with Gordon. Renee herself is even lost for a while due to Two-Face. In the end, efforts led by Lex Luthor re-open Gotham. Gordon, Bullock, Renee and the remaining officers (Pettit and the others had been killed) are given their jobs back. Bullock is then promoted to lieutenant and becomes the shift commander of the GCPD's Major Crimes Unit.\n\nIn the \"Officer Down\" storyline, disgruntled former officer Jordan Rich attempts to kill Gordon. Afterwards, a vengeful Bullock reveals Rich's location to the Mafia, thereby indirectly killing the shooter. When evidence of this comes out, he resigns from the force.\n\nHe then appears in the \"Unresolved\" story arc in \"Gotham Central\", where he has descended into a life of alcoholism and is shown contemplating suicide.\n\nAs part of DC's \"One Year Later\" storyline, Bullock has returned to the GCPD, with the understanding that he is not allowed a single mistake. The circumstances behind this are unknown, the only clue so far being the line: \"Six months since Harvey Bullock made his discoveries.\" Batman and Bullock have made their peace, agreeing to give each other a second chance after their past disagreements; Batman tells Bullock that he considers the ledger \"erased\".\n\nBullock is seen as one of the leads against the fight of a war between unauthorized Joker and Batman gangs.\n\nLater it is established he keeps in regular communication with his mother and has two cats, one of which, Sprinkles, has cancer.\n\nWhile little has ever been told of Harvey's past prior to him joining the Gotham City Police Department, he himself has stated that he was once a welterweight Golden Gloves competitor and was good enough to go pro, but chose not to because he disliked the \"regimented lifestyle\".\n\nBullock is sent to meet and greet Jason Bard, whom Gordon has recruited for the police force. Bullock is shown to be on friendly terms with fellow Gotham cop Maggie Sawyer. Hours later, Bard arrests James Gordon for manslaughter after a train crash.\n\nDuring the investigation into a long-running series of police murders, Bullock is kidnapped and replaced by a female killer known as Jane Doe. Jane is obsessed with the figurative and literal taking of other people's lives. That it was only Batman who noticed Bullock had been replaced causes the detective great distress.\n\nHarvey assists in citywide riots by helping James Gordon, now exonerated thanks to Batgirl, wire the entire city to display the Bat-signal. This raises the morale of the citizens and calms much of the panic.\n\nIn the DC Rebirth reboot universe, Bullock is partnered with commissioner Gordon when he attempts to raid Wayne Manor. Bullock tries to convince Gordon not to go through with it, but is unable to. Bullock goes on to cameo several times, usually alongside Gordon In the alternate future where Tim Drake becomes the Batman, Bullock is seen as an aid to Commissioner Montoya in the old section of the city. In the aftermath of the city of Bane. Harvey Bullock is filling as commissioner of Gotham City Police department after Jim Gordon who disappeared in the aftermath of the Batman Who Laughs series after being infected by the virus from the Batman Who laughs. Bullock does not get along with Batman solving skills to take down crime in Gotham City.\n\nIn the comic book \"The Batman Adventures\", Bullock is forced to resign after Oswald Cobblepot becomes mayor, thanks to Temple Fugate rigging the elections to exact revenge on Mayor Hill. As with the DCU version, he becomes a private detective.\n\nThe \"\" graphic novel features a very different version of the Bullock character. This Bullock is young and handsome, the former star of a reality show called \"Hollywood Detectives\". He comes to Gotham in order to solve the old Wayne Murder case. Despite his flashy exterior, he is a well-trained and highly qualified police officer. He is partnered with James Gordon, who he at first believes is taking bribes. He later finds out that the real reason Gordon doesn't stop crimes is because he fears that the mob will kill his daughter like they allegedly killed his wife. When Barbara Gordon is kidnapped by a murderer known as the Birthday Boy, the two go to rescue her, and they manage to do it with Batman's help. However, finding the bodies of Birthday Boy's previous victims breaks Bullock and he becomes an alcoholic. As of \"Volume Two,\" Bullock begin to recover his alcoholism after being urged from Gordon that he needs Bullock as an ally.\n\nIn Earth-Three, a universe where all heroes are villains, Harvey's counterpart appears in \"Justice League\" #24 in Alfred's flashback. Harvey Bullock of Earth-Three is still a member of Gotham Police, but he is a corrupt cop, and like the rest of GCPD of this universe he works under Owlman. He is seen with the Earth-Three version of Renee Montoya in an alleyway pulling their guns out and stopping a family who was out watching a movie nearby. They demand the family to empty out their purses and wallets \"in the name of the law\". The family however are also armed with guns and begin firing; Harvey then requests backup but it is denied as the rest of the police are currently helping Owlman track down the Joker (who is a hero in this universe). Renee and Bullock are then run over by Alfred despite them being allies since the Outsider was trying his best to follow Owlman; it is unclear whether Alfred did not see them or he simply did not care since Gotham PD worked under Owlman and he believed them to be expendable.\n\nIn the \"Flashpoint\" universe, Harvey Bullock is an alcoholic who patronizes Montoya's bar. Batman interrogates him for information on the Joker.\n\nIn the alternate reality of \"\" Superman has subtly taken over the planet and violently taken over Gotham City. Harvey Bullock is brutally beaten by a 'stormtrooper' (a super-soldier working for the Regime) for trying to show his badge. In response to Superman's various crimes, Harvey and many of Gotham's police take stolen Krytptonian technology and gain super-powers, putting them on Superman's level and thus starting a war to take back their city. In \"Year Three,\" Bullock quits the Insurgency when they become affiliated with Doctor Fate and John Constantine, claiming that this is now out of his league. Detective Chimp though tells him that he's a good cop and that they need him to help take down Superman, but before Harvey makes his decision, The Spectre bursts through the door and kills Harvey by obliterating him and his skeletal remains.\n\nIn the Elseworlds series \"\", Bullock is shown to be Gotham's Commissioner of Police. (Reference is made to Gordon having been murdered, but nothing specific is known about his death.) Bullock is even shown defending Batman against reporters in one panel, an opposite of mainstream Bullock.\n\nIn this universe, Bullock and Montoya are two Secret Service agents assigned to Presidential detail.\n\n\nDetective Harvey Bullock appears in the projects of the \"DC animated universe\", voiced by Robert Costanzo.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Early home movies show him training for a life at sea, climbing a telephone pole in his backyard, and wrestling & Jiu Jitsu to prepare for the inevitable fights he believed would occur due to his reading the novels of Jack London and Joseph Conrad.\n\nJohnson became a professional sailor (joining the Merchant Marine in 1926) working summers as crew and captain of various yachts including the \"Charmian\" for Newcomb Carlton (President of Western Union.), which led to the opportunity to sail on the \"Peking.\" He was an amateur filmmaker and his footage on the barque \"Peking\" in 1929 would become the now famous film \"Around Cape Horn\".\n\nWhile serving as mate on board the \"Wanderbird\", Johnson met (Harriet) Electa \"Exy\" Search whom he married in 1932. The Johnsons circumnavigated the world seven times on two vessels, both named \"Yankee\", each trip with a new crew and each taking approximately 18 months. The first \"Yankee\", bought in 1933, was a Dutch North Sea pilot schooner.\nThe second \"Yankee\", bought in 1947, was a retired German North Sea pilot schooner which the Johnsons rerigged as a brigantine.\nThey then retired from circumnavigation and, in 1958-9, had the last \"Yankee\" built at Westhaven in Zaandam, the Netherlands. She was a steel ketch for sailing the inland waterways of Europe, designed by Irving Johnson and Olin Stephens of Sparkman & Stephens.\n\nMany of the Johnsons' voyages have been documented in their own books and many articles and videos produced by the National Geographic Society and others throughout their sailing career. With an amateur crew, they traveled hundreds of thousands of miles to the islands of the South Pacific, ports of call in Southeast Asia, around the Cape of Good Hope and home to Gloucester without incident 18 months later seven times.\n\nUpon the urging of Bill Donovan, then head of the predecessor to the OSS, Johnson joined the U.S. Navy, and was at Pearl Harbor on the day of the attack. His intimate knowledge of the South Pacific made him a natural choice to advise the Pacific Fleet on the tides, swells, currents, depths and shoals around the treacherous reefs and atolls of the South Seas. He was commissioned a Lieutenant Commander, and joined the USS \"Sumner\", finishing the war as her commanding officer. On board they created and printed five-color charts, scouted out potential harbours for US Navy vessels, and conducted underwater demolition to improve the suitability of some of the harbours. Johnson also dove on recently sunken Japanese vessels, searching for classified Japanese documents. One success was a chart of the minefields surrounding Japanese harbors.\n\nMuch like his colleague Alan Villiers, Johnson educated the public about the majestic age of sail throughout his life, personally narrating showings of \"Around Cape Horn\" on board the \"Peking\", docked at South Street Seaport in New York City from 1974-2016 and working with Mystic Seaport and the Sea Education Association, serving as a trustee of both until his death in 1991.\n\nThe Los Angeles Maritime Institute has recently honored Irving and Exy by naming their twin brigantines for use in their award-winning Topsail Youth program after them.\n\nThe doyenne of modern sail training, Exy Johnson personally oversaw the christening ceremonies of the vessels whose construction she was instrumental in until her death in 2004.\n\nFormer crew members of their voyages include actor Sterling Hayden and Dr. Christopher B. Sheldon. Dr. Sheldon's experience on board the ill-fated brigantine \"Albatross\" served as the basis for the film \"White Squall\" (1996). Capt. Johnson also mentored yachtsman Jim Stoll, who became one of the directors of the Flint School.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Prior to being elected Superintendent, Huppenthal served as City Councilman, State Representative, and State Senator. Huppenthal was also a Senior Planning Analyst for Salt River Project.\n\nHuppenthal was born in Michigan City, Indiana and moved with his family to Arizona during childhood. He graduated from Salpointe Catholic High School in Tucson. He earned a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering from Northern Arizona University. He then obtained a Master of Business Administration from Arizona State University.\n\nHuppenthal was elected to the Chandler City Council in 1984, where he served two four-year terms.\n\nHuppenthal was first elected State Senator in 1992. In the primary election, Huppenthal faced two opponents; former Chandler Mayor Jerry Brooks and Don Goldwater, nephew of Barry Goldwater. Huppenthal won with nearly 50% of the vote. As a state senator from District 6, he was chairman of the Senate Education Committee.\n\nIn 2000, Huppenthal was elected State Representative, serving from 2000 to 2004.\n\nIn 2004, Huppenthal announced he would seek to reelection to the State Senate. Huppenthal was supported by U.S. Senator John McCain, who issued a statement praising Huppenthal as a \"straight shooter\" and a \"friend of the taxpayer\". Huppenthal won by a 60% to 40% margin.\n\nIn 2005, an effort to recall John Huppenthal was launched but failed to obtain enough signatures to make it to the ballot. The recall effort claimed he was out-of-touch with District 20 voters.\n\nHuppenthal was elected Arizona Superintendent of Public Instruction in the 2010 state election.\n\nHuppenthal ran on a platform of \"stopping La Raza\" (\"The Race,\" i.e., Hispanic identity.) He banned state funding for ethnic studies programs, resulting in the Tucson Unified School District (\"TUSD\") having to shut down its Mexican-American studies program, and remove numerous books from classrooms, including William Shakespeare's \"The Tempest\". Huppenthal's ban was based on passage of House Bill 2281 (also known as HB 2281 and A.R.S. § 15–112), which he had co-authored as an Arizona State Senator. The bill targeted the TUSD Mexican-American studies program, based on claims that it was politicizing students and breeding resentment against whites. A subsequent report commissioned by Huppenthal was released in May 2011 finding no evidence of the ethnic studies program being in violation of the law. The study did, however, find that the program was helping to close the achievement gap.\"\n\nHuppenthal was defeated in his race for reelection in the Republican Party primary in 2014 by Diane Douglas, who subsequently won the general election, and succeeded him in office in January 2015.\n\nOn his last day in office, Huppenthal issued a letter warning the Tucson Unified School District that they were illegally promoting ethnic solidarity and the overthrow of the U.S. government by teaching Mexican History and hip hop. The letter stated that a culturally relevant U.S. history class taught from the Mexican-American perspective violates HB 2281's restrictions against advocating ethnic solidarity because it \"includes substantial Mexican history,\" and that another such history course violates the law's ban on promoting the overthrow of the U.S. government by teaching the Rage Against the Machine song \"Take the Power back.\" The letter also stated that a culturally relevant U.S. history course taught from the African-American perspective violates the law because it includes \"An Introduction to Hip Hop Presented by Master Teacher, KRS-One.\" The Tucson Unified School District offers these culturally relevant courses pursuant to a federal court order, arising from a decades-long desegregation lawsuit.\n\nIn 2017, HB 2281 was criticized for showing \"discriminatory intent\" and violating the constitutional rights of the students of Arizona from Federal Judge A. Wallace Tashima.\n\nIn 2010, as part of a High School television production class project, Keith Wagner interviewed Huppenthal, then a State Senator and running for the office of State Superintendent of Public Instruction, on the topic of budget cuts for Career and Technical Education (\"CTE\"). Huppenthal stated that \"these are critically important programs,\" and decried the budget cuts to them as being \"simply horrendous.\" Wagner then reminded Huppenthal that he had voted for a legislative bill to cut $550 million from the Arizona Department of Education's budget, with \"a lot of that\" cut being in CTE, then asked what factors let to that decision. Huppenthal did not address the question, but, when pressed, walked out of the interview.\n\nIn June, 2014, an Arizona political blogger alleged that Huppenthal was the person behind pseudonyms used for several years to post anonymous comments on his blog, and other political websites.\n\nThe anonymous comments referred to Huppenthal in the third-person, discussed subjects including abortion, the economy, education, child protection and race, and were overtly supportive of Huppenthal's actions and policies. Comments labeled critics as \"evil scum,\" called people who receive public assistance \"lazy pigs\", and compared the work of the founder of Planned Parenthood to the actions of the Nazis. One group of comments included a call to shut down Spanish-language media: \"We all need to stomp out balkanization. No Spanish radio stations, no Spanish billboards, no Spanish tv stations, no Spanish newspapers. This is America, speak English.\" And \"I don't mind them selling Mexican food as long as the menus are mostly in English. And, I'm not being humorous or racist. A lot is at stake here.\" Media outlets characterized the comments as \"harsh,\" \"inflammatory,\" and \"racist screeds.\"\n\nOn June 16, 2014, Phoenix television station KPNX broke the story, claiming that not only was Huppenthal responsible for the comments, but that he had posted many of them from his office at the Arizona Department of Education. Although Huppenthal did not respond to KPNX's request for comment, two days after the story ran he held a news conference, where he admitted to making the comments, and hundreds of other anonymous posts on political blogs. He defended his positions, but apologized for his \"hurtful\" comments, stating \"I sincerely regret if my comments have offended anyone.\" \n"}

She has served as the Managing Editor of Investigative News of The \"Raw Story\" and contributes opinion and columns to online publications such as Alternet. She is also an American blogger for the \"Huffington Post\" and for her own journalism blog, at-Largely. Alexandrovna has had her work referenced in \"Rolling Stone\", \"Vanity Fair\", and \"Newsweek\", among others.\n\nAlexandrovna was born in Odessa, Ukraine to Jewish parents Aleksander Yurovich, a physicist, and Klavdia Borisovna, an accountant. In the Soviet Union, Jews were discriminated against by the state. She has written of her childhood that even as a child, she was able to understand that her family was treated differently:\n\nThe family came to the United States after traveling an \"entire year maneuvering our way throughout Europe in the common trajectory of Soviet refugees at the time.\"\n\nAlexandrovna attended Cleveland State University where she majored in English and Creative Writing. It was during this time that she was the poetry editor for the \"Cleveland Review\", also covering local news and culture. In addition, she worked with Russian poet Zoya Folkova to translate her work into English. She also developed a lifelong friendship with her writing mentor, Dr. Alberta Turner. In the mid 1990s, she moved to New York to work at Nasdaq, which she has said was a bad decision.\n\nLarisa Alexandrovna initially published only poetry and short fiction. During the 2000 election, she said that she formally began to write opinion and news pieces. She first became recognized for her reporting after she wrote an investigative piece about election fraud in Ohio, which was later cited in What went wrong in Ohio, a report published by Congressman John Conyers (D-MI) and later cited in several prominent articles, including in Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s controversial \"Rolling Stone\" article.\n\nLater articles on election fraud and domestic politics, included covering the Real ID Act, did not gain much attention domestically. However, a series of articles on the pre-war intelligence on Iraq and alleged illegal activities of the US Department of Defense and reporting on the CIA leak case and Iran gained Alexandrovna respect as an investigative journalist.\n\nOn March 16, 2007, Valerie Plame Wilson told the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, \"But I do know the Agency did a damage assessment. They did not share it with me, but I know that certainly puts the people and the contacts I had all in jeopardy, even if they were completely innocent in nature.\" Alexandrovna broke the story wide open that Plame was working on Iran, damage was done by her outing, and a damage report had been done. Citing \"three intelligence officials, who spoke under condition of anonymity,\" Alexandrovna reports that\n\nAccording to her sources,\n\nAlexandrovna also reports that while Plame was undercover she was involved in an operation identifying and tracking weapons of mass destruction technology to and from Iran, suggesting that her outing \"significantly hampered the CIA's ability to monitor nuclear proliferation.\" Her sources also stated that the outing of Plame compromised the identity of other covert operatives who had been working, like Plame, under non-official cover status. These anonymous officials said that in their judgement, the CIA's work on WMDs has been set back \"ten years\" as a result of the compromise.\n\nMainstream media initially ignored this story, but on May 1, 2006, MSNBC correspondent David Shuster reported on the political news show Hardball that MSNBC had learned \"new information\" about the potential consequences of the leaks:\n\nOn September 6, 2006, David Corn published an article for \"The Nation\" entitled \"What Valerie Plame Really Did at the CIA\" in which Corn reports that Plame was placed in charge of the operations group within the Joint Task Force on Iraq in the spring of 2001 and that, \"when the Novak column ran,\" in July 2003:\n\nCBS news would later confirm Plame \"was involved in operations to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.\"\n\nIn 2005, the \"Washington Post\" exposed the use of foreign black sites by the CIA in a program of extraordinary rendition, under which terrorism suspects were taken to undisclosed sites for detainment and interrogation.\n\nCritics of the \"Washington Post\" report believe that the publication caved under pressure from the White House by not exposing the locations of these sites. According to FAIR, the \"Washington Post\"'s decision to withhold the locations of these secret prisons was that since the revelations \"could open the U.S. government to legal challenges, particularly in foreign courts, and increase the risk of political condemnation at home and abroad,\" the \"Post\" did its part to minimize these risks. Yet, according to FAIR, \"the possibility that illegal, unpopular government actions might be disrupted is not a consequence to be feared, however — it's the whole point of the U.S. First Amendment.\" Furthermore, by not disclosing these locations it would make it impossible to have them closed and thereby the \"Post\" is enabling the rendition, secret detention, and torture of prisoners at these locations to continue. Another consequence might be that US soldiers and civilians are put at risk.\n\nSources who had approached the \"Post\" with the location of the Polish facility turned to Polish intelligence operative David Dastych, who in turn approached Alexandrovna. According to \"Raw Story\", in a report authored by Alexandrovna and Dastych, the Polish black site is in Stare Kiejkuty.\n\nThe complex at Stare Kiejkuty, a Soviet-era compound once used by German intelligence in World War II, is best known as having been the only Russian intelligence training school to operate outside the Soviet Union. Its prominence in the Soviet era suggests that it may have been the facility first identified — but never named — when the Washington Post's Dana Priest revealed the existence of the CIA's secret prison network in November 2005.\n\nBoth Alexandrovna and Dastych have stated that their sources told them that the same information and documents were provided to \"Washington Post\" in 2005. In addition, they also identified the methodology of concealing the black sites:\n\nFormer European and US intelligence officials indicate that the secret prisons across the European Union, first identified by the Washington Post, are likely not permanent locations, making them difficult to identify.\n\nWhat some believe was a network of secret prisons was most probably a series of facilities used temporarily by the United States when needed, officials say. Interim \"black sites\" – secret facilities used for covert activities — can be as small as a room in a government building, which only becomes a black site when a prisoner is brought in for short-term detainment and interrogation.\n\nThey go on to explain that \"Such a site, sources say, would have to be near an airport.\" According to Alexandrovna and Dastych, the airport in question is the Szczytno-Szymany International Airport.\n\nIn response to these allegations, former Polish intelligence chief Zbigniew Siemiatkowski embarked on a media blitz and claimed that the allegations made by Alexandrovna and Dastych were \"part of the domestic political battle in the US over who is to succeed current Republican President George W Bush,\" according to the German news agency Deutsche Presse Agentur.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1982238", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1982238", "title": "Gotham City Police Department", "text": "Gotham City Police Department\n\nThe Gotham City Police Department (GCPD) is a fictional police department appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Led by Commissioner Gordon, the GCPD services Gotham City and is typically depicted in stories featuring the superhero Batman.\n\nActing as both ally and opponent of Batman, the superhero long-established in Gotham, the GCPD has long been steeped in corruption, with numerous officers both high-and-low ranking involved in bribery and even more serious offenses such as drug-smuggling and murder.\n\nThe strongest blow against police corruption came when an increasing amount of conspiracy charges against Commissioner Gillian B. Loeb forced him to resign his position, replaced by Peter Grogan. The Falcone crime family, which has had a stranglehold on Gotham's underground for generations, finally crumbled when a series of killings shook the structure of the mafia organization. After the death of Carmine Falcone, the mob lashed out in sloppy, retaliatory crimes which, in combination with rising gang violence, severely crippled organized crime in Gotham City. Simultaneously, the ebbing presence of corrupt police officers allowed James Gordon to become the new commissioner, a man determined to eradicate crime wherever it existed.\n\nThe GCPD has had a long love-hate relationship with the city's vigilante known as Batman. Commissioner Gordon went along with him because Batman got the job done. His successor, Commissioner Michael Akins ordered the arrest of Batman and had the Bat-signal removed from the roof of Gotham Central. Corruption and rot within the police department also rose during Akins' tenure as Commissioner.\n\nAs of DC's \"One Year Later\", James Gordon has been reinstated as Commissioner, along with Harvey Bullock. Harvey came back on disciplinary probation after helping expose a criminal drug ring. Relations with Batman, including the Bat-Signal, have been established once more. Other characters from \"Gotham Central\" have appeared in the recent \"Tales of the Unexpected\" miniseries, featuring Crispus Allen as the Spectre. Thus far, Detective Driver has appeared in a speaking role. It is unknown what has happened to Commissioner Akins, but it is implied that, following revelations of massive corruption within the department, there has been a drastic cleaning-of-house within the department.\n\nKate Kane referred to Akins as police commissioner in the weekly \"52\" series, which reveals the events of the missing year. A later issue, however, showed a brief snapshot of Commissioner Gordon's welcome back party. The circumstances of Akins's departure and Gordon's reinstatement have yet to be explained. Maggie Sawyer is still the commander of the MCU department, and has ended her relationship with former lover Toby Raines.\n\nHomicide Division: The division that handles murders and some of the more serious non-metahuman crimes in Gotham. This is the division Gordon was a part of before becoming commissioner. Former private investigator Jason Bard is now working on homicide cases for this division.\nMajor Crimes Unit: Led by Capt. Maggie Sawyer, who previously served in Metropolis in a similar position with that city's police, the MCU deals with the most serious crimes, often involving supervillains or politically sensitive cases. This division is the focus of the comic book series \"Gotham Central\".\nQuick Response Team: Led by Lt. Gerard \"Jerry\" Hennelly, the QRT is the GCPD's SWAT unit.\n\n\"Note: The following are either deceased or have been dismissed from the Gotham City Police Department.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gotham City Federal Bureau of Investigation field office is also featured in the fictitious Gotham City. The Gotham City FBI personnel are shown using black vehicles with red emergency lights.\n\nThe 1940s \"Batman and Robin\" serial has actor Lyle Talbot in the role of Commissioner Gordon. No other members of the force are shown. However, his appearance of Gordon having a feather-duster mustache was later adapted to the comics.\n\nAll the Tim Burton/Joel Schumacher series seemed to give little depiction on the GCPD at all. In \"Batman\", Gordon is portrayed by Pat Hingle, while the usually corrupt Harvey Bullock is replaced with William Hootkins' Lt. Max Eckhart (who is killed by Jack Napier prior to his accidental transformation). Hingle also appeared in \"Batman Returns\", \"Batman Forever\" and \"Batman & Robin\".\n\nIn the Nolan films, the City of Gotham Police Department (abbreviated only as GPD) acts as both an ally and an opponent to Batman. In this incarnation they play a much greater pivotal role than other depictions of the force.\n\nIn \"Batman Begins\", the GPD plays a pivotal role throughout the course of the film, as one of the forces against Batman under the direction of the staunchly vigilante-opposed Commissioner Gillian B. Loeb (played by Colin McFarlane). While other members of the GPD are also present, two well-known detectives among them are featured; James Gordon (played by Gary Oldman) and his partner Arnold Flass (played by Mark Boone, Jr.). While Gordon is portrayed as one of the few honest police officers in the department, Flass is portrayed as being corrupt and dealing extensively with the local mafia and Loeb, though clearly displeased with the arrival of Batman, does not seem to possess any corrupt tendencies evident in the source material.\n\nConsidering that the film captures the early appearances of the Batman, there is much fear and skepticism among the rank and file about whether the Batman exists and if he is even human. Gordon, who had met Batman before he had adopted the Batman motif, not only realizes he is human, but recognizes the necessity of his actions. Gordon continues to work with him through his early weeks in operation. Batman, who trusts Gordon, a good cop he met during his childhood after his parents murder, includes him in his plan to save Gotham from the League of Shadows' fear toxin attack on the Narrows. At the end of the film, Batman's actions have sparked a change in the city and the cops' morality, leading to Gordon being promoted to Lieutenant.\n\nIn \"The Dark Knight\", Gordon is reassigned as commanding officer of the Major Crimes Unit (MCU), a newly formed division of the GPD created to combat the Gotham crime syndicates and thwart terrorist attacks. Three detectives of this unit are featured; Gerard Stephens (played by Keith Szarabajka), Michael Wuertz (played by Ron Dean) and Anna Ramirez (played by Monique Curnen), among others.\n\nRelations between the DA's office and the police, especially between Gordon and Harvey Dent, remains tense throughout most of the film, with corruption in the rank and file; and even within Gordon's unit, being a key source of this conflict in \"The Dark Knight\", with Dent suspecting that Ramirez and Wuertz are corrupt (based on his investigations while working in Internal Affairs, immediately before his election to District Attorney). In response to Dent's \"attacks\" on the police department and the actions of the League of Shadows from the first film, Loeb set up the Major Crimes Unit within the GPD to counter possible terrorist attacks as well as rid the city of its organized crime. In the Major Crimes Unit, acceptance of the Batman, though reluctant, is growing. By the end of the film, Batman is framed for the violent actions of Harvey Dent and the police force turns against him.\n\nIn \"The Dark Knight Rises\", the GPD has successfully eradicated the city's organized crime under \"The Dent Act\", as most remain oblivious to Harvey Dent's crimes. Gordon remains in guilt over letting Batman taking the fall for Dent, and waiting for a chance to admit the truth to the city. Rookie MCU detective John Blake (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) becomes aware of the truth, and also has deduced Batman's identity beforehand. He eventually becomes a friend and ally of Gordon and Batman, as well as serving as their liaison. Blake is also later promoted from patrol cop to detective after Gordon sees his intelligence and dedication, thus allowing him to report directly to the commissioner. Gordon's deputy commissioner Peter Foley (played by Matthew Modine), though not corrupt, is determined to capture Batman, to the point that when Batman crashes the police chase of Bane and some of his henchmen following Bane's robbery of the stock exchange, Foley issues orders for the police participating in the chase to pursue Batman instead. As a result, Bane ends up escaping while his henchmen are captured.\n\nBane and the League of Shadows later use explosive-laced concrete to trap most of the force underground for months until they are freed by Batman and his allies. Bane also discovers the truth of the circumstances behind Harvey Dent's death and reveals it to the GPD and the rest of the city, thus ending the manhunt against Batman. However, this also is used by Bane to break the criminals imprisoned under the Dent Act out of prison and wreak havoc around Gotham, much to both the police and the citizens' misfortune. Eventually, the police department are instrumental of the League of Shadows' defeat, though Foley and many officers are killed in action. The GPD, with the aid from Batman and his allies, has successfully captured the surviving League of Shadows members and Gotham's criminals, restoring order back to the city.\n\nBlake resigns himself from the police department following Batman's apparent death and after receiving a set of coordinates left by the Dark Knight, the young detective discovers the Batcave beneath Wayne Manor.\n\nThe GPD in the Nolan films is heavily modeled on the New York City Police Department. Patrol cars are painted in a modified version of a paint job used by the NYPD in the 1980s and 1990s. In a flashback scene shortly after the deaths of Bruce's parents in \"Batman Begins\", Gordon and other officers are shown wearing sky blue uniforms, similar to those worn by the NYPD from the 1970s through the mid-1990s. In all present-day scenes, patrol officers wear black uniforms. The text on patrol officers' shoulder patches, as well as various modified versions of the logo such as the seal used on SWAT trucks, establish the force as being first established in 1820.\n\nThe GCPD appears briefly in the extended cut of \"\" and reappears for \"Suicide Squad\", \"Justice League\" and \"Birds of Prey\".\n\nIn the film \"Joker\", set outside of the DCEU, Bill Camp and Shea Whigham play officers in the Gotham City Police Department.\nThe GCPD appear as an opponent to Batman. During the events of \"Year One\", Batman wasn't trusted, he doesn't have a relationship with GCPD and Gotham City doesn't consider him a hero. Although many of the GCPD officers are revealed to be corrupt, Lt. James Gordon builds a partnership with Batman.\n\nIn \"\", some GCPD helicopters chase Batman, Green Lantern and a Parademon but are unable to catch up with the trio.\n\nThe GCPD appear in \"Son of Batman\".\n\nThe GCPD make a brief appearance in \"\".\n\nThe 1960s campy Batman featured Neil Hamilton as Commissioner Gordon and Stafford Repp as Chief O'Hara. Both are depicted as being dependent on Batman and Robin to help solve cases. Gordon even keeps a link to the Batcave called \"the Batphone\" on his desk. In the early episodes it's implied that they only call them in for the so-called \"arch-criminals\" as the police can handle the more mundane (murder, burglary, arson, etc.). But as the show progressed, they became even more dependent on them to solve problems. This is most greatly shown in one episode, when Batman appears to be missing, Gordon laments that the police will have to solve a case \"ourselves\". Commissioner Gordon and Chief O'Hara would always be seen with a bunch of police officers when it comes to arresting the arch-criminals upon their defeat.\n\nDetective Jesse Reese - played by Shemar Moore. Jesse is an honest cop in New Gotham who learns of the Birds of Prey and begins to help them. He later enters into a relationship with Huntress. It is later revealed that Reese's birthname was Jesse Hawke, son of crime boss Al Hawke, who became a police officer to atone for his family's sins. This version of the GCPD does have a corruption problem (though it is unclear how bad since a few other honest officers have cameos) and appears to no longer have Jim Gordon at its head.\n\nIn the series, most of the department is corrupt, with very few honest GCPD officers, including James Gordon, Sarah Essen, Renee Montoya, Crispus Allen, and Nathaniel Barnes. A detective referred to as “Alvarez” appears in 30 episodes portrayed by J. W. Cortez; this is most likely Carlos Alvarez from the comics.\n\nJames Gordon, one of the few honest police officers of the GCPD, is the central character of the series and one of his intentions is to purge corruption from the ranks, including his partner, Harvey Bullock. Overtime, many police officers grow distant from Gordon as he attempts to uphold the law rather than break it, much to the frustration of Bullock. After capturing Jack Buchinsky following his attack on the GCPD, Gordon investigated a conspiracy involving Commissioner Loeb and Arnold Flass, leading to the former assigning him to the case of the Ogre, who targets the loved ones of police officers, leading to Gordon killing the serial killer and then enlisting the help of Oswald Cobblepot to force Loeb to resign.\n\nAfter the Maniax's attack on the GCPD left Sarah Essen dead, Nathaniel Barnes was assigned to the position of Captain and he and Gordon worked together to rid the department of corruption whilst assembling a Strike Force too. After a chain of events lead to Gordon being targeted by a resurrected and delusional Theo Galavan, who became the ancient warrior called Azrael, the GCPD was once again attacked by the latter and Barnes was seriously wounded, leading to Bullock becoming acting-Captain.\n\nBarnes briefly returned but was infected with the Alice Tetch Virus, which was then released all over the city by the Court of Owls, forcing the GCPD to contain the situation whilst a cure was procured and Bullock became the new Captain. However, Cobblepot collaborated with the reluctant GCPD under \"Pax Penguina\" as criminals were issued licenses to enable them to commit crimes, much to Gordon's chagrin. Bullock, who had the department's best interests at heart, began to take money from Cobblepot and issued releases for detained criminals with licenses. Soon after, Professor Pyg began to terrorize Gotham and abducted numerous police officers who were Cobblepot's bagmen and murdered them. The GCPD teamed up with Cobblepot to capture the Pyg, who took advantage of Bullock's reckless actions to ambush them and slaughter dozens of police officers whilst the former accidentally shot a police officer disguised as Pyg himself. Gordon rescued them and his bravery earned him praise from the department, who rejected the licenses and Gordon was promoted to Captain, causing Bullock to resign from the GCPD in disgrace. However, Sofia Falcone had intended for Gordon to become the Captain to actually control him otherwise there will be chaos instead, forcing Gordon to reluctantly take the blame and become a hero for the city.\n\nAfter Sofia is placed into a coma, Gordon is forced to live with his debt by Bullock, who believed that the department needed someone to look up to. When Gotham City is declared a no man's land due to the plot of Jeremiah Valeska and Ra's al Ghul, Gordon and the remaining police officers work with Bruce Wayne, Alfred Pennyworth and Lucius Fox to maintain the peace.\n\nThe Gotham City Police Department appears in the Arrowverse crossover \"Elseworlds\". It is seen in Part 2 where its police officers arrest Oliver Queen, Barry Allen, and Kara Danvers when they get into a scuffle with some thugs that were also arrested. The three of them are bailed out by a man working for Kate Kane.\n\nThe Gotham City Police Department appears in \"Batwoman\". Jack Forbes is depicted as the police commissioner.\n\nIn the acclaimed animated television series, \"\", the GCPD characters are given more attention such as in \"P.O.V\", where the major characters of the force in the series participate in a detailed debriefing of an incident. One of the most important contributions from the animated series to the Batman universe is the introduction of Renee Montoya (first as a uniformed officer, then a detective), which would later become a first-grade character in the \"GCPD\" comic books. In the printed DC Universe, her presence was so solidly incorporated that she later retired from the Department to assume the identity of the Question.\n\nIn this animated series \"Batman Beyond\", James Gordon's daughter Barbara Gordon (former Batgirl in \"Batman: The Animated Series\") serves as the new commissioner.\nGordon, Ramirez, and Crispus Allen all appear in three of the shorts in \"\" (which bridges the gap between \"Batman Begins\" and \"The Dark Knight\") consisting of \"Crossfire\", \"In Darkness Dwells\", and \"Deadshot\".\n\nGordon was voiced by Jim Meskimen, Ramirez was voiced by Ana Ortiz, and Allen was voiced by Gary Dourdan.\n\nOn the animated series \"The Batman\", the focus of the GCPD in the first two seasons is on Detectives Ellen Yin (voiced by Ming-Na Wen) and Ethan Bennett (voiced by Steve Harris) prior to his Clayface transformation. The corruption on the force is attributed to Chief Angel Rojas (voiced by Edward James Olmos in the first appearance, Jesse Corti in later appearances), who appeared often in those seasons. They served as recurrent antagonists in the first two seasons under Chief Rojas' leadership. However, in the Season 2 finale, Jim Gordon (voiced by Mitch Pileggi), recently appointed Commissioner, calls off the manhunt and forms an alliance with Batman to help keep Gotham safe for his daughter, Barbara. Two episodes of the cartoon series featured another detective of the Gotham City Police Department named Cash Tankinson (voiced by Patrick Warburton). Neither Rojas nor Yin has been seen since then, though one episode that take places in the future implies that sometime between now and then, Yin will replace Gordon as Commissioner and Bennet becomes Chief of Police.\n\nThe GCPD appears in \"Beware the Batman\". James Gordon worked as a police lieutenant and was distrustful towards Batman until he helped save his daughter from Tobias Whale and Phosphorus Rex. During the part where the League of Assassins had control over the Ion Cortex and shut down Gotham City's power, James Gordon became the police commissioner when Commissioner Correa was killed by the League of Assassins.\n\nEach of the different media appearances introduce a member of the Gotham City Police Department that is exclusive to the project:\n\n"}

He was the first Polish author to write exclusively in the Polish language, and is considered (with Biernat of Lublin and Jan Kochanowski), to be one of the founders of Polish literary language and literature.\n\nRej was born into a noble family at Żurawno, near Halicz. His father had moved to Ruthenia from Nagłowice, near Kraków at the invitation of archbishop Jan Wątróbka. His mother, Barbara Herburt, married Rej's father there. Although young Rej received little formal education in Lwów, and, at the age of 13 attended but one year at the Kraków Academy, he managed to educate himself by studying Latin literature.\n\nApproximately 1524, Rej began his service at the court of voivode Andrzej Tęczyński in Sandomierz. There, he acquired most of his vast knowledge in the field of humanities. He returned to his family's town of Topola and married Zofia Kosnówna (Kościeniówna). In 1531 Rej moved to Kobyle, in the Chełm area, which had been bequeathed to his wife, and thereafter, he frequented the court of Hetman Mikołaj Sieniawski. In either 1541 or 1548, Rej converted to Calvinism. He took part in synods and founded Protestant schools and communities on his lands.\nRej took part in sejms and thought his writing an important social mission. He was the first Polish writer to receive a substantial reward for his output. By the end of his life, he owned several villages and oversaw many. He received from King Zygmunt I the Old, and Dziewięciele from King Zygmunt II August as a lifelong possession and two towns, one of them Rejowiec, founded by Rej in 1547. Living during the Golden Liberty embraced by the Polish nobility, tolerance characterized his oversight and this philosophy was carried on by his sons. Rej died at Rejowiec in 1569.\n\nOn the five-hundredth anniversary of his birth, Mikolaj Rej was described as a \"father of Polish literature\", and it also was noted that his grandson, Andrzej Rej (diplomat), royal secretary and Calvinist, is Mikolaj's most prominent offspring. That grandson may be the subject of the 1637 painting by Rembrandt, \"A Polish Nobleman\" (perhaps, painted while he was visiting Amsterdam during a trip as a Polish ambassador on a diplomatic mission to the courts of the Danish, the English, and the Dutch).\n\nIn 1543 Rej debuted as a writer, under the pen name \"Ambroży Korczbok Rożek,\" with his most famous book, \"A Brief Discussion among Three Persons: a Lord, a Commune Chief, and a Priest\" (\"Krotka rozprawa między trzemi osobami, panem, woytem a plebanem\").\n\nRej's works touch on a large array of matters. He authored prose works that described the ideal of the Polish nobleman, criticized the Catholic Church, and showed a genuine solicitude for his country. His prose syntax is strongly influenced by Latin style.\n\nHis poetic meter discloses a deliberate effort to impart to the medieval metrical model with which he was so familiar, a regularity that it lacked. Rej's works include:\n\nIn commemoration of the five-hundredth anniversary of the birth of Mikołaj Rej, Poland's Sejm (parliament) declared 2005 to be \"the Year of Mikołaj Rej\". \n\nIn 1994–97, Rej's descendant and namesake, Nicholas Andrew Rey (1938–2009), served as American Ambassador to Poland.\n\n\n\n"}

The city of Hakha is more than above sea level, founded on a small highland plateau. Although it is relatively small in land area, it is the largest city of Chin, as well as its capital city, with the plateau significantly larger than that of other towns in Chin State. It is estimated that Hakha has enough land and full capacity to extend to as ten times its current township area. \n\nAs Chin State is quite hilly, Hakha is built on the slope of a large mountain, in a U shape. There is only one main road running along the middle of the city, in a curved U, and the whole city is built along this road. Another road runs from the middle of the city, for a short while, forming the foot of U. Hakha is in the center of Chin State and it is connected with Thantlang, Falam, Gangaw, and Matupi by truck roads.\n\nHakha was founded around A.D. 1400 by the Lai ethnic group. The area was ruled by local chiefs for many generations and it consisted of more than 600 houses when the British troops arrived in Hakha in 1889.\n\nThe British occupied Hakha on January 19, 1890, as part of their operation to \"subdue the wild tribes\" in the Arakan Hills Division, as the area was then called. The British government later established a sub-divisional office and Hakha became a town a few years later.\n\nThe first American Baptist missionary couple, Arthur Carson (1860-1908) and his wife Laura (1858-1942) who arrived in Hakha on March 15, 1899 opened a mission station. Later other missionaries joined them and did extensive mission works throughout the Chin Hills and converted most of the Northern Chin State to Christianity within a century. This missionary work brought education, development, social and economic changes, and health improvement to the Chin people. The main contribution to language education was by Chester Strait of Wisconsin (1893-1985) who opened the Chin Hills Bible School in 1928 with thirteen students - four from the Tedim area of the Zomi people, four from Falam and five from the Haka areas of the Laimi, another branch of the Chin people. Although the teaching was in the Lai language after six months all students were able to write their final exam in the language.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Hakha was captured by Japanese troops on November 11, 1943; it was later recaptured by British troops.\n\nWhen Burma gained independence from British control in 1948, Hakha became an important city as the center for one of the subdivisions in the Chin Special Division, of which Falam was the capital at that time. The Chin Special Division was abolished reformed as the Chin State in 1974, at which time Hakha became the capital of the Chin State. That brought an influx of government workers, and housing development and extension of the city. Hakha eventually became the largest city in the Chin State with about 20,000 people. Hakha was part of the newly formed district:Hakha District on 1 June 2012.\n\nThe city is above sea level and it lies at the foot of Rung Tlang (Mt. Rung), which is about high, and is one of the most famous and beautiful mountain peaks in the Chin State.\n\nHakha features a subtropical highland climate (Cwb) under the Köppen climate classification. Because it is located in the tropics, Hakha experiences three seasons—cool, warm and rainy. Because of the high altitude, the temperatures are much cooler for each season compared to those in the plains.\n\nIt is fairly cold during the cool season months. Sometimes, the temperature drops to as low as . It is also very windy in winter. The whole city is foggy in the morning and in the evening. During the month of January, 2009 there was a cold wave that hit Burma. It was reported that temperatures dropped to .\n\nThe total rainfall is about 86.22 inches every year.\n\nThe Burmese meteorology department has issued daily weather reports since 1988, but does not issue warnings of predicted heat waves or cold snaps.\n\n\n\nThe 4,000-seat Wanthu Maung Stadium, a home stadium for Chin United F.C is still under construction.\n\n"}

It begins in County Galway and ends in County Sligo. On 27 September 2017 the southern, Tuam–Galway, section was upgraded to motorway status and designated M17.\n\nThe route commences at the Kilmore Roundabout in Tuam and ends at the Toberbride roundabout at Collooney in County Sligo. It runs through or past several major towns and places in the area including Tuam, Miltown, Ballindine, Claremorris, Knock, Kilkelly, Charlestown, Curry, Tubbercurry and Ballinacarrow. The entire route is regular highway with no sections of dual carriageway as yet.\n\nThe N17 begins at the Kilmore Roundabout in Tuam and bypasses the town of Tuam since 27 September 2017. After passing Tuam the route swings northwest towards Miltown, where a new realigned section of road is encountered (built late 1990s) avoiding a notorious stretch of road which saw many fatalities at one particular bend at a graveyard. This section of road was improved again in 2012, when a bad bend at Lisavalley was removed. This has left the road between Milltown and Tuam with a complete hard shoulder. The route then passes through the village of Miltown passing over the River Clare, the main street in the village is very narrow and can become congested. After leaving Miltown the route continues north towards the Ballindine, this section of the N17 is of poor standard and is reduced to a narrow winding road to the County Mayo border.\n\nThe former section of the N17 between Tuam and Galway City has been redesignated as the N83.\n\nThe N17 passes through Ballindine just after it crosses the Galway/Mayo border. The main street though Ballindine is very wide reducing congestion in the village. Leaving Ballindine the route heads north towards Claremorris. This 5 km section of road was completely realigned in 1983, bypassing a dangerous stretch of road at Garryduff. This is busy section with almost 10,000 vehicles daily. At Lissduff the 16 km Claremorris/Knock bypass commences, the largest project on the N17 to date. It bypasses Claremorris to the east, greatly reducing heavy through traffic in the town. The 16 km bypass was constructed in 2 phases, the 6 km Claremorris phase (phase 1) which opened July 2001 and the 10 km Knock phase (phase 2) which opened to traffic December 2002. The Knock bypass passes the village to the west heading in a northeast direction bypassing Kilkelly (bypassed 1980s), the route continues towards Charlestown passing Ireland West Airport Knock. This section of road is of good quality and has a hard shoulder to just south of Charlestown. The route passes through Charlestown and over the Sligo border into the village of Bellaghy.\n\nAfter passing through Bellaghy the N17 in Co. Sligo heads in a northeasterly direction bypassing Curry, this 6 km section was built in 1993 and is of excellent standard. After bypassing Curry and as far as Tubbercurry the standard of the road is reduced to a very low quality winding road with a high fatality rate. The N17 passes Tubbercurry to the west in the form of a basic relief road, heavy goods vehicles use this road around the town, although many cars continue on through the town's main street as it is often faster than the relief road. The route continues in a north easterly direction towards Ballinacarrow. Two kilometres past Ballinacarrow drivers encounter a slow lane section. This 8 km section to the N4 Collooney bypass was constructed in 1993 with the bypassing of Collooney. The N17 ends where it meets the N4 Sligo-Dublin road at the Toberbride roundabout.\n\nA number of upgrade projects are planned for the N17, which forms part of the Atlantic Corridor, along with the N18 and N20. Prior to the 2017 upgrade, the Southern section N17 was the state's busiest single-carriageway inter-urban road with over 25,000 vehicles using the road at Claregalway daily of which over 20,000 travel on the Claregalway-Galway section south of Claregalway.\n\nThe biggest project was the upgrade of 25.5 km of this route to motorway standard, between Tuam and east of Galway. Under the Irish road numbering scheme, this section is designated as the M17 motorway. It runs from a junction with the M6 motorway near Athenry, which also forms the starting point for the M18 motorway to Gort. In April 2014, this project was given the go-ahead by the Government and was completed on 27 September 2017.\n\nThe motorway is not tolled.\n\nAt the northern terminus, the scheme links in with a bypass of Tuam, which provided an additional of dual carriageway. This is Type 2 Dual Carriageway, or \"2+2 road\" as it has been dubbed by the NRA. This type of scheme has some at-grade roundabout junctions and a wire barrier between the carriageways.\n\n\n"}

DS-DE is well-favored because it describes modulation, bit formats, routing, flow control, and error detection in hardware, with little need for software. SpaceWire also has very low error rates, deterministic system behavior, and relatively simple digital electronics. SpaceWire replaced old PECL differential drivers in the physical layer of IEEE 1355 DS-DE by low-voltage differential signaling (LVDS). SpaceWire also proposes the use of space-qualified 9-pin connectors.\n\nSpaceWire and IEEE 1355 DS-DE allows for a wider set of speeds for data transmission, and some new features for automatic failover. The fail-over features let data find alternate routes, so a spacecraft can have multiple data buses, and be made fault-tolerant. SpaceWire also allows the propagation of time interrupts over SpaceWire links, eliminating the need for separate time discretes.\n\nEach transferred character starts with a Parity bit and a Data-Control Flag bit. If Data-Control Flag is a 0-bit, an 8-bit LSB character follows. Otherwise one of the control codes, including end of packet (EOP).\n\nThe network data frames look as follows:\n\nOne or more address bytes are used for the routing. Addresses are either physical ones (0-31), or logical ones. The difference is that the physical addresses are deleted from the frame header during routing - which is used for hop-based routing (based on path specified in the frame itself). Logical addresses may be deleted as well, depending on the router configuration.\n\nThe hardware devices may be connected either directly, or via a SpaceWire router. In the former case, usually pairs of devices are used to guarantee a fail-safe operation - which is however handled by the software.\n\nA SpaceWire router is usually a crossbar switch-type device, operating in wormhole switching mode. This also may limit the speed of the communication to the lowest common speed. The routing decisions are based on the programmed routing table and the initial incoming frame contents.\n\nSpaceWire is used worldwide.\nIts use began primarily in ESA projects, but it is currently used by NASA, JAXA, RKA, and many other organizations and companies. Some NASA projects using it include the James Webb Space Telescope, Swift's Burst Alert Telescope, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, LCROSS, the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES-R), and the SCaN Testbed, previously known as the Communications, Navigation, and Networking Reconfigurable Testbed (CoNNeCT). It has also been selected by the United States Department of Defense for Operationally Responsive Space. SpaceWire initiatives are being coordinated between several Space Agencies in the frame of CCSDS in order to extend its communication model to the Network and Transport Layers of the OSI model.\n\nSpaceWire supports highly fault-tolerant networks and systems, which is one reason for its popularity.\n\nThe ESA has a draft specification in place for the Protocol ID.\n\nThe following Protocol ID's have been assigned in ECSS-E-ST-50-11:\n\nCommercial providers of SpaceWire equipment:\nSpaceWire IP Cores:\n\nArticles:\n"}

By contrast, \"ordinary\" hadrons contain just two or three quarks. Hadrons with explicit valence gluon content would also be considered exotic. In theory, there is no limit on the number of quarks in a hadron, as long as the hadron's color charge is white, or color-neutral.\n\nConsistent with ordinary hadrons, exotic hadrons are classified as being either fermions, like ordinary baryons, or bosons, like ordinary mesons. According to this classification scheme, pentaquarks, containing five valence quarks, are exotic baryons, while tetraquarks (four valence quarks) and hexaquarks (six quarks, consisting of either a dibaryon or three quark-antiquark pairs) would be considered exotic mesons. Tetraquark and pentaquark particles are believed to have been observed and are being investigated; Hexaquarks have not yet been confirmed as observed.\n\nExotic hadrons can be searched for by looking for S-matrix poles with quantum numbers forbidden to ordinary hadrons. Experimental signatures for such exotic hadrons have been seen by at least 2003 but remain a topic of controversy in particle physics.\n\nJaffe and Low suggested that the exotic hadrons manifest themselves as poles of the P matrix, and not of the S matrix. Experimental P-matrix poles are determined reliably in both the meson-meson channels and nucleon-nucleon channels.\n\nWhen the quark model was first postulated by Murray Gell-Mann and others in the 1960s, it was to organize the states known then to be in existence in a meaningful way. As quantum chromodynamics (QCD) developed over the next decade, it became apparent that there was no reason why only three-quark and quark-antiquark combinations could exist. Indeed, Gell-Mann's original 1964 paper alludes to the possibility of exotic hadrons and classifies hadrons into baryons and mesons depending upon whether they have an odd (baryon) or even (meson) number of valence quarks. In addition, it seemed that gluons, the mediator particles of the strong interaction, could also form bound states by themselves (glueballs) and with quarks (hybrid hadrons). Several decades have passed without conclusive evidence of an exotic hadron that could be associated with the S-matrix pole.\n\nIn April 2014, the LHCb collaboration confirmed the existence of the Z(4430), discovered by Belle, and demonstrated that it must have a minimal quark content of \"cd\".\n\nIn July 2015, LHCb announced the discovery of two particles, named and , which must have minimal quark content \"cuud\", making them pentaquarks.\n\nThere are several exotic hadron candidates:\n\n"}

It was published by IPC Media until October 2010, with , and in 2007 won IPC's 'Magazine of the Year' award. Since November 2010, \"The Railway Magazine\" has been published by Mortons Media Group Ltd. (Mortons of Horncastle).\n\n\"The Railway Magazine\" was launched by Joseph Lawrence and ex-railwayman Frank E. Cornwall of Railway Publishing Ltd, who thought there would be an amateur enthusiast market for some of the material they were then publishing in a railway staff magazine, the \"Railway Herald\". They appointed as its first editor a former auctioneer, George Augustus Nokes (1867-1948), who wrote under the pseudonym \"G. A. Sekon\". He quickly built the magazine circulation to around 25,000. From the start it was produced in Linotype on good-quality paper and well illustrated with photographic halftone and occasional colour lithographic plates.\n\nIn 1910, following a dispute with the proprietors, Nokes resigned and started a rival, very similar, magazine, \"Railway and Travel Monthly\". Both this and \"The Railway Magazine\" in 1916 were purchased by John Aiton Kay (1883-1949), proprietor of the \"Railway Gazette\", and Nokes's title was renamed \"Transport and Travel Monthly\" in 1920 before being amalgamated with \"The Railway Magazine\" from January 1923. Apart from this episode, \"The Railway Magazine\" had no serious commercial rival in its field until the 1940s. Kay himself served as editor after his predecessor had left for service in World War II. For many years the magazine shared editorial direction with the \"Railway Gazette\", and for periods had officially no editor of its own. From May 1942 to the end of 1949, paper shortages compelled bi-monthly publication; in January 1942 there had been a reduction of the page size by a half-inch in both dimensions down to (which lasted until October 1963), though it continued to use art paper for a centre section of photographs, which had begun in January 1934.\n\nThe magazine claims a record for the longest unbroken published series, begun under the title \"British locomotive practice and performance\" in 1901, characterised by detailed logs giving the timings of notable trips, recorded by observers with a stopwatch. (The September 1930 column was 'pulled' by the editor as being too critical of Nigel Gresley's London and North Eastern Railway steam locomotives.) Its first writer was the New Zealand-born Charles Rous-Marten (1844-1908). One of those who shared authorship of the series after his death was the Great Eastern Railway engineer Cecil J. Allen (1886-1973) who became sole author from 1911 until succeeded by O. S. Nock in 1958, when Cecil J. Allen moved his performance column to \"Trains Illustrated\" (later renamed \"Modern Railways\"), edited by his son, G. Freeman Allen. From 1981 to 2004 the performance series was written by Peter W. B. Semmens (1927-2007), who also served as chief correspondent from 1990, notably reporting on the Channel Tunnel construction. Authorship of the series, now called just \"Practice & performance\", has subsequently been shared by Keith Farr and John Heaton.\nThe editor originated a series of \"Illustrated Interviews\" with senior railway officials, the first being Joseph Wilkinson, general manager of the Great Western Railway; another early manager to feature was John Sylvester Hughes of the Festiniog Railway. Other contributors of features in earlier days included Rev. W. J. Scott, Rev. Victor L. Whitechurch (1868-1933), Charles H. Grinling, railwayman H. L. Hopwood (1881-1927), and the much-travelled T. R. Perkins (1872-1952). Harold Fayle contributed on Irish railways (for many years it was traditional for the May issue to have a strong Irish content, with the January one having a Scottish slant). A notable series by the locomotive engineer E. L. Ahrons on \"Locomotive and train working in the latter part of the nineteenth century\" was published between 1915 and 1926 (and much later collected in book format). A very small amount of fiction was included in the magazine's earliest days. Another feature which has persisted since the early days has been answers to readers' questions, under the title \"The why & the wherefore\".\n\nNotable photographic contributors of the Interwar period included Maurice W. Earley (1900–82), W. Leslie Good, Frank R. Hebron (died 1980), F. E. Mackay, O. J. Morris (1902–61) (who produced the first colour photograph published in the magazine, in 1938) and H. Gordon Tidey. The cover design, incorporating a photograph, remained substantially unchanged from the early 1900s to the mid-1950s; colour was first introduced there in 1963. In common with most similar magazines, the pictorial content is today largely in colour.\n\nIn earliest days, current news paragraphs were placed at the back of the magazine under the headings \"What the railways are doing\" and \"Pertinent paragraphs\"; from 1987 news was moved to the front. The magazine has also over the years steadily extended its detailed coverage of locomotive and rolling stock movements. It now covers current British railway news, modern traction, some history, heritage railways and general and international railway topics.\n\nBetween November 1963 and December 1996, the definite article was omitted from the title, which was \"Railway Magazine\" during that period. Since November 1983, the word \"Magazine\" has been in smaller type.\n\n† \"died in office\"<br>\n‡ \"nominally Deputy Editor\"\n\nThe \"Railway Magazine\" has a presence on the National Preservation forums. Members and readers are able to talk and comment directly to members of the editorial staff, providing both feedback and constructive criticism. This has been noted as a valuable source of information for the magazine in order to keep in touch with its readership online in the internet age.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1982322", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1982322", "title": "H. G. Wells' War of the Worlds (The Asylum film)", "text": "H. G. Wells' War of the Worlds (The Asylum film)\n\nH. G. Wells' War of the Worlds, also known as Invasion and H. G. Wells' The Worlds in War internationally, or simply as War of the Worlds, is a direct-to-DVD science fiction war film produced by The Asylum and directed by David Michael Latt. It is a loose adaptation of the H. G. Wells 1898 novel \"The War of the Worlds\", and a mockbuster of the DreamWorks/Paramount film based on the same source.\n\nA contemporary translation of the novel set in the United States, \"War of the Worlds\" tells of a devastating invasion of Earth by technologically-advanced extraterrestrials, from the perspective of an American astronomer trying to reunite with his wife and son. It is the only adaptation besides the 1953 film in which the main character actively tries to repel the aliens. The film is loosely based on an unproduced screenplay called \"Invasion\", written by Carlos De Los Rios in 1997.\n\nThe DVD was released on June 28, one day before DreamWorks' film, and stars C. Thomas Howell, Peter Greene, and Jake Busey. The alternate title of \"Invasion\" is likely for the film's overseas distribution since Paramount Pictures claims to own exclusive film rights of the \"War of the Worlds\" title in the European Union, but also derives from the original name of De Los Rios's screenplay. The film is The Asylum's most successful production to date, having sold over 250,000 copies from Blockbuster upon its release. A sequel, \"\", was released in 2008.\n\nOn the surface of Mars, the Mars Rover is destroyed by an unknown force. Astronomer George Herbert (Howell) and his wife Felicity (Van Wyk Loots) are packing for a trip to Washington D.C. to celebrate their 10th wedding anniversary. George's son Alex tries to spot Mars through his telescope, but actually discovers a meteorite entering Earth's atmosphere. George is called to work about the incident, and his wife and son leave early for Washington without him. As he drives to work, a crashing meteorite disrupts all technology in the area. An alien \"walker\" emerges from the meteorite and massacres the witnesses with an energy weapon, George barely escaping with his life. George decides to meet with his younger brother Matt in Hopewell before moving on to D.C..\n\nDespite rumours that D.C. has suffered some of the worst of the invasion thus far, George continues his journey and meets with Sgt. Kerry Williams, the last remaining member of his squad. George and Kerry meet with Lt. Samuelson, a power-mad soldier with unrealistic notions of resistance against the invaders, who rejects George and Kerry as cowards. In Hopewell, the aliens launch a heavy insurrection and George and Kerry find Matt dying in the trail of destruction. George is separated from Kerry in the confusion and escapes the attack. A Pastor, Victor, finds George and describes his belief that the invasion is a form of the Rapture. The two go on together towards D.C.. Victor's faith in Christianity is deeply shaken when a hysterical former member of his church curses God for the death of her young children. George and Victor witness the final effort of the military to fight off the walkers who are overwhelmed as the aliens begin using chemical weapons to disperse their opposition.\n\nThe two seek refuge in the abandoned house of a veterinarian for food and medical supplies when the neighborhood is flattened by another of the aliens' ships. Hiding in the house's ruins deep in the aliens' camp, Victor concludes that God has abandoned them, and rejects his religion altogether. Rations become sparse and the aliens begin harvesting humans. George finds rabies vaccines with the hope that it can spread among the aliens and give them a chance to escape. Victor regains his faith after George successfully infects one of the aliens, only for it to kill Victor and leave. George realizes after a few days that the aliens have left the area and he continues his journey on foot to Washington D.C.. George reunites with Kerry and Samuelson, who has made himself a general and is building a resistance under his own dictatorship. Samuelson senselessly murders Kerry, and George in turn murders Samuelson.\n\nGeorge finally reaches Washington, which is completely destroyed. He offers his life to the aliens, but finds that they are all dead. A handful of human survivors emerge and reveal to George that the aliens have been dying from a virus. George finds Felicity and Alex alive.\n\n\nDirector/editor/executive producer/co-writer David Michael Latt (who admits to never seeing the Byron Haskin/George Pal version or the 1988 television series, but has been a fan of the H.G. Wells novel since childhood) made it clear that his film changed certain aspects from the source material in addition to the time and location. Most notable is that the tripods have been changed to six-legged crab-like machines called \"walkers\" (a result of allowing the effects team creative freedom).\n\nThe aliens are indeed Martians (though the film never states this, it is confirmed with an opening credit sequence using shots of the Red Planet's landscape), but they bear little resemblance to their novel's counterparts. Whereas Wells described his invaders as bear-sized tentacled creatures, the film's Martians are insect-like with four tentacle-like legs. These aliens also have the ability to spit acid from their feet, which melts anything. At the end of the legs three tongue-like appendages closely resemble the Martian fingers from Byron Haskin's 1953 film version of \"The War of the Worlds\" and the 1988 television series version.\n\nThe war machines are crab-like \"walkers\" with six legs. A Heat Ray is built into the machine's \"head\", and is fired from a single eye. The fighting machines do not appear to have protection against modern artillery (avoiding the \"invisible shields\" seen in the 1953 film version and Steven Spielberg's 2005 film), leaving their ability to conquer unexplained. The aliens do have a substance similar to the black smoke, but is more of a dense green toxic gas unable to rise above ground level, allowing survivors to escape by getting to high places.\n\nThe protagonist is George Herbert, a reference to H. G. Wells. Rather than being a writer, as in the novel, he is an astronomer. The film leaves the \"eve of the war\" storyline and its characters almost completely absent. He also has a son, who is portrayed by Dashiell Howell, who is actually the son of George's actor C. Thomas Howell.\n\nDespite these differences, George goes through much of what befalls the novel's protagonist, even in sacrificing himself to the Martians, only for them to drop dead of infection. He is also separated from his family and tries to reunite with them once the invasion begins, As in the novel, they are alive at the conclusion. George's brother, a Ranger, is less fortunate; he is seen only briefly after being fatally wounded in an attack by the invaders. In the book, the narrator's brother takes up a major narrative role.\n\nA major deviation from the text is that the protagonist actually tries to produce a means of stopping the Martians, but whether or not he is directly responsible for their downfall is ambiguous. There is a theme of disease throughout - George's son is seen suffering from a mild cold, while George himself suffers from a major fever which leaves him incapacitated for two days.\n\nThe novel's Artilleryman is divided into two characters. The first, Kerry Williams, exhibits the defeated status. He accompanies George as they move to unaffected areas, meeting soldiers oblivious to the danger they will soon face, until they become separated when George takes refuge underwater to evade the Martians. After his ordeal in the ruined house, George encounters the same defeatist Williams again. Instead, the other personality, portrayed in the novel's later stages, is Lt. Samuelson.\n\nThe novel's unnamed Curate is the film's Pastor Victor. While the two are very similar, the pastor is optimistic and is sure that the invasion is the Rapture. However, his faith is deeply shaken when he meets a congregant who screams against God for the loss of her family, causing the Pastor to question why he himself has yet to be taken. Unlike the Curate, the Pastor keeps his composure when he's trapped in the ruined house as he wrestles with his thoughts. Where the Curate had to be subdued in the novel, the Pastor regains his faith just before he is killed by the Martians.\n\nThe film includes homages to the 1953 film. The aliens' hands deliberately resemble those of the Martians of the 1953 film, and the protagonists of each film both actively try to weaken the aliens, another deviation from the novel.\n\nThe film has received mixed reception with a 45% audience rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Everything Action states that the movie generally follows the outline of Wells' book, but found that movie is not worth watching as it tries too hard to be taken seriously.\n\nOn April 1, 2008, a sequel, \"\", was released. C. Thomas Howell directed the film and reprised the role of George Herbert, and his son Dash Howell reprised the role of Alex. The film also starred Christopher Reid.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1982325", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1982325", "title": "Vietnamese name", "text": "Vietnamese name\n\nVietnamese personal names generally consist of three parts: one patrilineal family name, one or more middle name(s) (one of which may be taken from the mother's family name), and one given name, used in that order. The \"family name first\" order follows the system of Chinese names and is common throughout the Chinese cultural sphere. However, it is different from Chinese, Korean, and Japanese names in the usage of \"middle names\", as they are less common in China and Korea and do not exist in Japan. Persons can be referred to by the whole name, the given name or a hierarchic pronoun, which usually connotes a degree of family relationship or kinship, in normal usage.\n\nDue to the frequency of the major family names such as Nguyễn, Trần, and Lê, persons are often referred to by their middle name along with their given name in Vietnamese media and youth culture.\n\nThe Vietnamese language is tonal, and so are Vietnamese names. Names with the same spelling (ignoring diacritics) but with different tones are different names, which can confuse non-Vietnamese people when the diacritics are dropped, as is commonly done outside Vietnam.\n\nAnyone applying for Vietnamese nationality must adopt a Vietnamese name.\n\nThe family name is positioned first and is passed on by the father to his children. It is estimated that there are around 100 family names in common use, but some are far more common than others. The name \"Nguyễn\" is estimated to be used by almost 40% of the Vietnamese population. The top three names are so popular because people tended to take family names of emperors to show their loyalty. Over many generations, family names became permanent.\n\nThe most common family names among the Vietnamese are the following (the Chinese characters following each name are Hán tự). Altogether, the 14 names account for 90% of the people.\n\n\nThe following list includes less-common surnames in alphabetical order:\nIn Vietnamese cultural practice, women always keep their family names once they marry, just as in other East Asian cultures, including Chinese culture to the north and the northeast.\n\nIn formal contexts, people are referred to by their full name. In more casual contexts, people are always on a \"first name basis\", which involves their given names, accompanied by proper kinship terms. There is no such thing as a \"last name basis\", or family name basis, in Vietnam.\n\nMost Vietnamese have one middle name, but it is quite possible to have two or more of them or to have no middle name at all.\n\nIn the past, the middle name was selected by parents from a fairly narrow range of options. Almost all women had \"Thị\" () as their middle name, and many men had \"Văn\" (). More recently, a broader range of names has been used, and people named \"Thị\" sometimes omit their middle name.\n\n\"Thị\" is by far the most common female middle name. That word expresses possession. For example, \"Trần Thị Mai Loan\" is a person who has the given name of \"Mai Loan\" and the surname \"Trần\", and the combination \"Trần Thị\" means \"a female person belonging to the Trần family.\" Male middle names include \"Văn\" (), \"Hữu\" (), \"Đức\" (), \"Thành\" (), \"Công\" (), and \"Quang\" ().\n\nThe middle name can have three uses:\n\nHowever, most middle names now do not have those uses. They can have a meaning or only make the full name sound better.\n\nIn most cases, the middle name is formally part of the given name. For example, the name \"Đinh Quang Dũng\" is separated into the surname \"Đinh\" and the given name \"Quang Dũng\". In a normal name list, those two parts of the full name are put in two different columns. However, in daily conversation, the last word in a given name with a title before it is used to address a person: \"Ông Dũng\", \"Anh Dũng\", etc., with \"Ông\" and \"Anh\" being words to address the person and depend on age, social position, etc.\n\nThe given name is the primary form of address for Vietnamese. It is chosen by parents and usually has a literal meaning in the Vietnamese language. Names often represent beauty, such as bird or flower names, or attributes and characteristics that the parents want in their child, such as modesty (\"Khiêm\", 謙).\n\nTypically, Vietnamese will be addressed with their given name, even in formal situations, although an honorific equivalent to \"Mr.\", \"Mrs.\", etc. will be added when necessary. That contrasts with the situation in many other cultures in which the family name is used in formal situations, but it is a practice similar to usage in Icelandic usage and, to some degree, Polish. It is similar to the Latin-American and southern European custom of referring to women as \"Doña\" and men as \"Don\", along with their first name.\n\nAddressing someone by the family name is rare. In the past, married women in the north were called by their (maiden) family name, with \"Thị\" (氏) as a suffix. In recent years, doctors are more likely than any other social group to be addressed by their family name, but that form of reference is more common in the north than in the south. Some extremely famous people are sometimes referred to by their family names, such as Hồ Chí Minh (\"Bác Hồ\"—\"\"Uncle Hồ\") (however, his real surname is Nguyễn), Trịnh Công Sơn (\"nhạc Trịnh\"—\"\"Trịnh music\"), and Hồ Xuân Hương (\"nữ sĩ họ Hồ\"—\"\"the poetess with the family name Hồ\"). Traditionally, people in Vietnam, particularly North Vietnam, addressed parents using the first child's name: Mr and Mrs Anh or Master Minh.\n\nWhen being addressed within the family, children are sometimes referred to by their birth number, starting with one in the north but two in the south. That practice is less common recently, especially in the north.\n\nDouble names are common among females, especially in combination with the name . For example, has the given name .\n\n\nVietnamese Catholics are given a saint's name at baptism ( or ). Boys are given male saints' names, while girls are given female saints' names. This name appears first, before the family name, in formal religious contexts. Out of respect, clergy are usually referred to by saints' name. The saint's name also functions as a posthumous name, used instead of an individual's given name in prayers after their death. The most common saints' names are taken from the New Testament, such as (Peter), (Paul), (John), (Mary), and .\n\nSaints' names are respelled phonetically according to the Vietnamese alphabet. Some more well-known saints' names are derived further into names that sound more Vietnamese.\n\nSome names may appear the same if simplified into a basic ASCII script, as for example on websites, but are different names:\n\n\nTypically, as in the above examples, it is middle or the last personal given name which varies, as almost any Sino-Vietnamese character may be used. The number of family names is limited.\n\nFurther, some historical names may be written using different Chinese characters (Sino-Vietnamese), but are still written the same in the modern Vietnamese alphabet.\n\nAccording to the English-language \"Chicago Manual of Style\", Vietnamese names are indexed according to the final given name and not according to the family name, with a cross-reference placed in regards to the family name. Ngô Đình Diệm would be listed as \"Diem, Ngô Dinh\" and Võ Nguyên Giáp would be listed as \"Giáp, Võ Nguyên\".\n\nIn Vietnamese, Vietnamese names are sorted by given name, then family name, then middle name.\n\n\n"}

In strict military terminology, an observation post is \"any\" preselected position from which observations are to be made - this may include very temporary installations such as a vehicle parked as a roadside checkpoint, or even an airborne aircraft.\n\nWhen selecting a (temporary) observation post, trained troops are to avoid obvious and conspicuous locations such as hilltops, water towers or other isolated terrain features, and to ensure that the observation post can be reached via a concealed route. This is especially important as the observer in the post should be rotated every 20–30 minutes, as vigilance decreases markedly after such a time. \n\nObservation posts should be manned with at least two personnel (more, for defense and observer rotation, if the post is to be retained for longer durations), and should be provided a means of communication with their chain of command, preferably by phone instead of by radio.\n\nOften being positioned in secret very close to the enemy, an observation post is usually a small construct, often consisting largely of camouflage materials and possibly weather cover. However, where frontlines are expected to be stable for a longer time, an observation post (or ground observation post) may develop into a bunker-like installation.\n\nIt is not unusual for soldiers to occupy a 'hide' for long periods of time. To avoid detection they have to remove all their own waste. This is achieved with the aid of clingfilm, plastic bags and empty water bottles.\n\nOne example of makeshift observation posts is Gaza Baptist Church, which was commandeered by both Fatah and Hamas troops during the Fatah–Hamas conflict.\n"}

The PCB manufacturer PCB-Pool and Conrad Electronic provide a free unlimited version, that generates only printed output or output for PCB-Pool and Conrad's PCB service. Commercial versions with all features are available.\n\nTARGET 3001! collects several features under one user interface (MDI). All project information is stored in one file to avoid redundancy and version conflicts. Design begins with the creation of a schematic diagram and usually ends with the layout of a PCB (or chip).\n\nThe schematics can be simulated by the integrated PSPICE compatible mixed mode simulator. Components are stored in a SQLite or MySQL database, also externally accessible. Component data include direct links to datasheets and component supplier information as well as simulation information and 3D models. TARGET's open Component Interchange Format CXF is supported by universal component databases like Ultra Librarian and Footprint Expert.\n\nPCBs or ASICs can be designed manually or using an autoplacer and autorouter. A Specctra interface to external autorouters is available. The design can be automatically checked for spacing violations and many other design rules. If the PCB is ready designed it can be directly displayed and rotated in a live 3D view. The 3D data can be exported in STEP format to produce preview 3D dummies of the PCB on 3D printers. Circuit design on 3D bodies (Molded Interconnect Device, MID) is possible.\n\nCNC data for PCB milling can be obtained in several formats. Additionally a device front panel can directly be derived from the PCB, using the coordinates on the PCB, e.g. from LEDs or potentiometers.\n\nA predecessor of TARGET 3001! was \"RULE\" (), a DOS-based program for PCB layout (1989). After hobbyists used this, there were calls for a schematic tool and autorouter. In response, TARGET 2.1 (for DOS) was released in 1992. The move to Windows was difficult: early versions of \"TARGET V3 for Windows\" were prone to crash. The package became stable and more accepted among hobby, educational and professional users.\n\nDevelopments in versions V7 to V16 included an EMC tool and PSPICE-compatible simulation. The name TARGET was changed to TARGET 2001!, but, as year 2001 approached, \"TARGET 3001!\" was registered as a trademark and used for versions V9 and higher.\n\nTARGET 3001! is used also by industrial designers. For example, TOYOTA used it for cable harnesses in their Formula 1 racing car.\nToday, TARGET 3001! is one of the most popular PCB layout systems in Germany and Europe. Readers of electronics magazine Elektor voted it number two. Also testers of the electronics magazine \"c't Hardware Hacks\" rated it number two.\n\n"}

By 1900 the gang had become a leading force in the Chicago underworld, later rivaling Ragen's Colts, hired out for illegal activities ranging from labor slugging to murder for hire. During the mid-1910s, the gang was led by Paddy \"The Bear\" Ryan, who, operating from his South Halstead Street saloon, would control most of Bloody Maxwell by Prohibition, until his murder by rival Walter \"Runt\" Quinlan, in 1920. \n\nAfter Walter Quinlan's death by Ryan's son Paddy \"The Fox\" Ryan, Jr., the gang was led by Frankie Lake and Terry Druggan who soon began bootlegging operations as the \"Druggan-Lake Gang\". Soon becoming successful distributors the gang, with partner Joseph Stenson, owned several breweries by the early 1920s using its wealth to gain political influence and police protection. In 1924, Lake and Druggan were each sentenced to one year in Cook County Jail. However, while serving their sentences, they were allowed to leave the prison regularly due to support from politicians such as 20th Ward alderman Morris Eller and bribes of $20,000 to Sheriff Peter Hoffman and prison Warden Wesley Westbrook. After a report by the \"Chicago American\", Hoffman was fined $2,500 and sentenced to one-month imprisonment and Westbrook was sentenced to four-months imprisonment. \n\nThe gang was soon noticed by Al Capone, due in part to the scandal, and upon their release in 1925 following the bootleg wars an alliance was formed between the gang and the Chicago Outfit, agreeing to give Capone 40% of their income in exchange for protection with Ragen's Colts gunmen under Danny Stanton who included William \"Gunner\" McPadden, Hughey \"Stubby\" McGovern, Raymond Cassidy, and Frank \"Dutch\" Carpenter (although many of these men would be killed during the bootleg wars). With the conviction of Druggan and Lake for tax evasion in 1932 the gang would eventually become absorbed into the organization by the end of Prohibition. Serving as the Chicago crime syndicate's leading enforcers many of the gang members, including Terry Druggan, retired extremely wealthy.\n\n"}
{"id": "1982365", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1982365", "title": "Tong, Shropshire", "text": "Tong, Shropshire\n\nTong is a village and civil parish in Shropshire in England. It is near junction 3 of the M54 motorway (A41) near Albrighton. The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 243.\n\nThe name of the village derives from the Old English \"Tweonga\", which means a pinched piece or spit of land. This stems from the fact that Tong sits between two tributaries of the infant River Worfe. \n\nIn the 1840s, Tong was surveyed by two different railway companies. The Shrewsbury and Wolverhampton Railway was eventually driven further south to run through Ruckley and Neachley (just south of the M54), whilst the Shrewsbury and Leicester Direct Railway, which would have gone in a north-east to south-west direction between Tong and Tong Norton, was never built.\n\nThe village lies just to the north of the M54 in Shropshire. The A41 road used to run through the village, but after heavy traffic and the death of a child under a lorry, the village was bypassed in 1963.\n\nIn \"White-ladies,\" one of the \"Boscobel Tracts\" that describe the events of the escape of Charles II from England after the Battle of Worcester (3 September 1651), there is a statement that Charles, while sheltering at Boscobel House about two miles away, \"had the pleasure of a prospect from Tong to Breewood (\"sic\"), which satisfied the eyes, and of the famous bells at Tong, which entertained the ear.\" The bells he heard were the bells of St. Bartholomew's. During the escape Charles also spent the night of 4/5 September 1651 at Hobbal Grange in the parish of Tong as a guest of Richard Penderel.\n\nThe village is remarkable mainly for its church, St Bartholomews, outside of which is the supposed grave of Little Nell, a fictional character in Charles Dickens's book, \"The Old Curiosity Shop\". It is thought that Dickens visited Tong church. His grandmother is supposed to have worked at Tong Castle many years before as a girl. The Castle (demolished in 1954) stood to the south; its site is now occupied by the M54 motorway.\n\nThe 'grave' is thought to have come about because Charles Dickens's novel was serialised and shipped over to America, and as a result, Americans began coming over to England to visit scenes featured in the book. The tourists recognised the references to Tong church from the book and came to view the supposed 'grave', which of course was not there.\n\nHowever, a verger and village postmaster, George H. Boden (16 August 1856 - May 1943) apparently asked local people to pay for a headstone, forged an entry in the church register of burials (apparently the giveaway was that he used post office ink to do this), and charged people to see the 'grave'. The marker has been moved from time to time to make way for genuine graves.\n\nA particularly notable feature of St. Bartholomew's is the collection of memorials to the Vernon family and other proprietors of the Tong estate inside the church. St. Bartholomew's was chosen by Simon Jenkins of \"The Times\" in 1999 as one of the best 1,000 churches (out of 15,000) in England. He awarded the church, which was mostly rebuilt in 1409, three stars out of a possible five. He refers to the collection of village tombs, the masterpiece of which being that of Richard Vernon, who died in 1451. Most of the earlier ones are carved from alabaster, and are the products of the top end of the nearby late medieval Nottingham alabaster industry.\n\nTong Castle was a large mostly Gothic country house, set within a park landscaped by Capability Brown, on the site of a medieval castle of the same name. Tong Castle's remains are now a Historic England Grade II listed site.\n\n"}

{"id": "1982394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1982394", "title": "Cultural appropriation", "text": "Cultural appropriation\n\nCultural appropriation, at times also phrased cultural misappropriation, is the adoption of an element or elements of one culture by members of another culture. This can be controversial when members of a dominant culture appropriate from disadvantaged minority cultures.\n\nAccording to critics of the practice, cultural appropriation differs from acculturation, assimilation, or equal cultural exchange in that this appropriation is a form of colonialism. When cultural elements are copied from a minority culture by members of a dominant culture, these elements are used outside of their original cultural context—sometimes even against the expressly stated wishes of members of the originating culture.\n\nCultural appropriation is considered harmful by various groups and individuals, including Indigenous people working for cultural preservation, those who advocate for collective intellectual property rights of the originating, minority cultures, and those who have lived or are living under colonial rule. Often unavoidable when multiple cultures come together, cultural appropriation can include exploitation of another culture's religious and cultural traditions, fashion, symbols, language, and music.\n\nThose who see this appropriation as exploitative state that the original meaning of these cultural elements is lost or distorted when they are removed from their originating cultural contexts, and that such displays are disrespectful or even a form of desecration. Cultural elements that may have deep meaning to the original culture may be reduced to \"exotic\" fashion or toys by those from the dominant culture. Kjerstin Johnson has written that, when this is done, the imitator, \"who does not experience that oppression is able to 'play', temporarily, an 'exotic' other, without experiencing any of the daily discriminations faced by other cultures.\" The African-American academic, musician and journalist Greg Tate argues that appropriation and the \"fetishising\" of cultures, in fact, alienates those whose culture is being appropriated.\n\nThe concept of cultural appropriation has been heavily criticized. Critics note that the concept is often misunderstood or misapplied by the general public, and that charges of \"cultural appropriation\" are at times misapplied to situations such as eating food from a variety of cultures or simply learning about different cultures. Others state that the act of cultural appropriation as it is usually defined does not meaningfully constitute social harm, or the term lacks conceptual coherence. Still others argue that the term sets arbitrary limits on intellectual freedom, artists' self-expression, reinforces group divisions, or itself promotes a feeling of enmity or grievance rather than liberation.\n\nCultural appropriation can involve the use of ideas, symbols, artifacts, or other aspects of human-made visual or non-visual culture. As a concept that is controversial in its applications, the propriety of cultural appropriation has been the subject of much debate. Opponents of cultural appropriation view many instances as wrongful appropriation when the subject culture is a minority culture or is subordinated in social, political, economic, or military status to the dominant culture or when there are other issues involved, such as a history of ethnic or racial conflict. Linda Martín Alcoff writes that this is often seen in cultural outsiders' use of an oppressed culture's symbols or other cultural elements, such as music, dance, spiritual ceremonies, modes of dress, speech, and social behaviour when these elements are trivialized and used for fashion, rather than respected within their original cultural context. Opponents view the issues of colonialism, context, and the difference between appropriation and mutual exchange as central to analyzing cultural appropriation. They argue that mutual exchange happens on an \"even playing field\", whereas appropriation involves pieces of an oppressed culture being taken out of context by a people who have historically oppressed those they are taking from, and who lack the cultural context to properly understand, respect, or utilize these elements.\n\nA different view of cultural appropriation states the criticism of cultural appropriation is \"a deeply conservative project\", despite progressive roots, that “first seeks to preserve in formaldehyde the content of an established culture and second tries [to] prevent others from interacting with that culture.\" Proponents view it as often benign or mutually beneficial, citing mutation, product diversity, technological diffusion, and cultural empathy among its benefits. For example, the film \"Star Wars\" used elements from Akira Kurosawa's \"The Hidden Fortress\", which itself used elements from Shakespeare; culture in the aggregate is arguably better off for each instance of appropriation. Fusion between cultures has produced such foods as American Chinese cuisine, modern Japanese sushi, and bánh mì, each of which is sometimes argued to reflect part of its respective culture's identity.\n\nCultural appropriation is a relatively recent subject of academic study.\nThe term emerged in the 1980s, in discussions of post-colonial critiques of Western expansionism, though the concept had been explored earlier, such as in \"Some General Observations on the Problems of Cultural Colonialism\" by Kenneth Coutts‐Smith in 1976.\n\nCultural and racial theorist George Lipsitz has used the term \"strategic anti-essentialism\" to refer to the calculated use of a cultural form, outside of one's own, to define oneself or one's group. Strategic anti-essentialism can be seen in both minority cultures and majority cultures, and is not confined only to the use of the other. However, Lipsitz argues, when the majority culture attempts to strategically anti-essentialize itself by appropriating a minority culture, it must take great care to recognize the specific socio-historical circumstances and significance of these cultural forms so as not to perpetuate the already existing majority vs. minority unequal power relations.\n\nA common example of cultural appropriation is the adoption of the iconography of another culture, and using it for purposes that are unintended by the original culture or even offensive to that culture's mores. Examples include sports teams using Native American tribal names or images as mascots; wearing jewelry or fashion with religious symbols such as the war bonnet, medicine wheel, or cross without any belief in the religion behind them; and copying iconography from another culture's history such as Polynesian tribal tattoos, Chinese characters, or Celtic art worn without regard to their original cultural significance. Critics of the practice of cultural appropriation contend that divorcing this iconography from its cultural context or treating it as kitsch risks offending people who venerate and wish to preserve their cultural traditions.\n\nIn Australia, Aboriginal artists have discussed an \"authenticity brand\" to ensure consumers are aware of artworks claiming false Aboriginal significance. The movement for such a measure gained momentum after the 1999 conviction of John O'Loughlin for selling paintings that he falsely described as the work of renowned Aboriginal artist, Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri. In Canada, visual artist Sue Coleman has garnered negative attention for appropriating and amalgamating styles of Indigenous art into her work. Coleman, who has been accused of \"copying and selling Indigenous-style artwork\" has described herself as a \"translator\" of Indigenous art forms, which drew further criticism. In his open letter to Coleman, Kwakwak'awakw/Salish Artist Carey Newman stressed the importance of artists being accountable within the Indigenous communities as the antidote to appropriation.\n\nHistorically, some of the most hotly debated cases of cultural appropriation have occurred in places where cultural exchange is the highest, such as along the trade routes in southwestern Asia and southeastern Europe. Some scholars of the Ottoman Empire and ancient Egypt argue that Ottoman and Egyptian architectural traditions have long been falsely claimed and praised as Persian or Arab.\n\nMany Native Americans have criticized what they deem to be cultural appropriation of their sweat lodge and vision quest ceremonies by non-Natives, and even by tribes who have not traditionally had these ceremonies. They contend that there are serious safety risks whenever these events are conducted by those who lack the many years of training and cultural immersion required to lead them safely, pointing to the deaths or injuries in 1996, 2002, 2004, and several high-profile deaths in 2009.\n\nCultural appropriation is controversial in the fashion industry due to the belief that some trends commercialise and cheapen the ancient heritage of indigenous cultures. There is debate about whether designers and fashion houses understand the history behind the clothing they are taking from different cultures, besides the ethical issues of using these cultures' shared intellectual property without consent, acknowledgement, or compensation. In response to this criticism, many fashion experts claim that this occurrence is in fact \"culture appreciation\", rather than cultural appropriation. Companies and designers claim the use of unique cultural symbols is an effort to recognize and pay homage to that specific culture.\n\nDuring the 17th century, the forerunner to the three piece suit was adapted by the English and French aristocracy from the traditional dress of diverse Eastern European and Islamic countries. The Justacorps frock coat was copied from the long zupans worn in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the necktie or cravat was derived from a scarf worn by Croatian mercenaries fighting for Louis XIII, and the brightly colored silk waistcoats popularised by Charles II of England were inspired by exotic Turkish, Indian and Persian attire acquired by wealthy English travellers.\n\nDuring the Highland Clearances, the British aristocracy appropriated traditional Scottish clothing. Tartan was given spurious association with specific Highland clans after publications such as James Logan's romanticised work \"The Scottish Gael\" (1831) led the Scottish tartan industry to invent clan tartans and tartan became a desirable material for dresses, waistcoats and cravats. In America, plaid flannel had become workwear by the time of Westward expansion, and was widely worn by Old West pioneers and cowboys who were not of Scottish descent. In the 21st century, tartan remains ubiquitous in mainstream fashion.\n\nBy the 19th century the fascination had shifted to Asian culture. English Regency era dandies adapted the Indian churidars into slim fitting pantaloons, and frequently wore turbans within their own houses. Later, Victorian gentlemen wore smoking caps based on the Islamic fez, and fashionable turn of the century ladies wore Orientalist Japanese inspired kimono dresses. During the tiki culture fad of the 1950s, white women frequently donned the qipao to give the impression that they had visited Hong Kong, although the dresses were frequently made by seamstresses in America using rayon rather than genuine silk. At the same time, teenage British Teddy Girls wore Chinese coolie hats due to their exotic connotations.\n\nIn Mexico, the sombrero associated with the mestizo peasant class was adapted from an earlier hat introduced by the Spanish colonials during the 18th century. This, in turn, was adapted into the cowboy hat worn by American cowboys after the US Civil War. In 2016, the University of East Anglia prohibited the wearing of sombreros to parties on campus, in the belief that these could offend Mexican students, a move that was widely criticized.\n\nAmerican Western wear was copied from the work attire of 19th century Mexican Vaqueros, especially the pointed cowboy boots and the guayabera which was adapted into the embroidered Western shirt. The China poblana dress associated with Mexican women was appropriated from the choli and lehenga worn by Indian maidservants like Catarina de San Juan who arrived from Asia from the 17th century onwards.\n\nIn Britain, the rough tweed cloth clothing of the Irish, English and Scottish peasantry, including the flat cap and Irish hat were appropriated by the upper classes as the British country clothing worn for sports such as hunting or fishing, in imitation of the then Prince of Wales. The country clothing, in turn, was appropriated by the wealthy American Ivy League and later preppy subcultures during the 1950s and 1980s due to both its practicality and its association with the English elite. During the same period the British comedian Tommy Cooper was known for wearing a Fez throughout his performances.\n\nWhen keffiyehs became popular in the late 2000s, experts made a clear distinction between the wearing of a genuine scarf, and a fake made in China. Palestinian independence activists and socialists denounced the wearing of scarves not made in Palestine as a form of cultural appropriation, but encouraged young white people and fellow Muslims to buy shemaghs made in the Herbawi factory to demonstrate solidarity with the Palestinian people and improve the economy of the West Bank. In 2017, Topshop caused controversy by selling Chinese-made playsuits that imitated the pattern of the keffiyeh.\n\nSeveral fashion designers and models have featured imitations of Native American warbonnets in their fashion shows, such as Victoria's Secret in 2012, when model Karlie Kloss wore one during her walk on the runway; a Navajo Nation spokesman called it a \"mockery\". Cherokee academic Adrienne Keene wrote in \"The New York Times\":\n\nFor the [Native American] communities that wear these headdresses, they represent respect, power and responsibility. The headdress has to be earned, gifted to a leader in whom the community has placed their trust. When it becomes a cheap commodity anyone can buy and wear to a party, that meaning is erased and disrespected, and Native peoples are reminded that our cultures are still seen as something of the past, as unimportant in contemporary society, and unworthy of respect.\n\nBoth Victoria's Secret and Kloss issued apologies stating that they had no intentions of offending anyone.\n\nArchbishop Justin Welby of the Anglican Church has claimed that the crucifix is \"now just a fashion statement and has lost its religious meaning.\". Crucifixes have been incorporated into Japanese lolita fashion by non-Christians in a cultural context that is distinct from its original meaning as a Christian religious symbol.\n\n\nWhile the history of colonization and marginalization is not unique to the Americas, the practice of non-Native sports teams deriving team names, imagery, and mascots from indigenous peoples is still common in the United States and Canada, and has persisted to some extent despite protests from Indigenous groups. Cornel Pewewardy, Professor and Director of Indigenous Nations Studies at Portland State University, cites indigenous mascots as an example of dysconscious racism which, by placing images of Native American or First Nations people into an invented media context, continues to maintain the superiority of the dominant culture. It is argued that such practices maintain the power relationship between the dominant culture and the indigenous culture, and can be seen as a form of cultural imperialism.\n\nSuch practices may be seen as particularly harmful in schools and universities that have a stated purpose of promoting ethnic diversity and inclusion. In recognition of the responsibility of higher education to eliminate behaviors that create a hostile environment for education, in 2005 the NCAA initiated a policy against \"hostile and abusive\" names and mascots that led to the change of many derived from Native American culture, with the exception of those that established an agreement with particular tribes for the use of their specific names. Other schools retain their names because they were founded for the education of Native Americans, and continue to have a significant number of indigenous students. The trend towards the elimination of indigenous names and mascots in local schools has been steady, with two thirds having been eliminated over the past 50 years according to the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI).\n\nIn contrast, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, in what the \"Washington Post\" calls an unusual move, has approved of the Florida State Seminoles use of their historical leader, Osceola, and his Appaloosa horse as the mascots Osceola and Renegade. After the NCAA attempted to ban the use of Native American names and iconography in college sports in 2005, the Seminole Tribe of Florida passed a resolution offering explicit support for FSU's depiction of aspects of Florida Seminole culture and Osceola as a mascot. The university was granted a waiver, citing the close relationship with, and ongoing consultation between, the team and the Florida tribe. In 2013, the tribe's chairman objected to outsiders meddling in tribal approval, stating that the FSU mascot and use of Florida State Seminole iconography \"represents the courage of the people who were here and are still here, known as the Unconquered Seminoles.\" Conversely, in 2013, the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma expressed disapproval of \"the use of all American Indian sports-team mascots in the public school system, by college and university level and by professional sports teams.\" Additionally, not all members of the Florida State Seminoles are supportive of the stance taken by their leadership on this issue.\n\nIn other former colonies in Asia, Africa, and South America, the adoption of indigenous names for majority indigenous teams is also found. There are also ethnically-related team names derived from prominent immigrant populations in the area, such as the Boston Celtics, the Notre Dame Fighting Irish, and the Minnesota Vikings.\n\nThe 2018 Commonwealth Games to be held on the Gold Coast in Australia from 4 April 2018 has named its mascot Borobi, the local Yugambeh word for \"koala,\" and has sought to trademark the word through IP Australia. The application is being opposed by a Yugambeh cultural heritage organisation, which argues that the Games organising committee used the word without proper consultation with the Yugambeh people.\n\nThe term wigger (common spelling \"wigga\") is a slang term for a white person who adopts the mannerisms, language, and fashions associated with African-American culture, particularly hip hop, and, in Britain, the grime scene, often implying the imitation is being done badly, although usually with sincerity rather than mocking intent. Wigger is a portmanteau of \"white\" and \"nigger\" or \"nigga,\" and the related term wangsta is a mashup of \"wannabe\" or \"white\", and \"gangsta\". Among black hip-hop fans, the word \"nigga\" can sometimes be considered a friendly greeting, but when used by white people, it is usually viewed as offensive. \"Wigger\" may be derogatory, reflecting stereotypes of African-American, black British, and white culture (when used as synonym of white trash). The term is sometimes used in a racist manner, by other white people to belittle the person perceived as \"acting black\", but it is widely used by African Americans like 50 Cent offended by the wigga's perceived demeaning of black people and culture.\n\nThe phenomenon of white people adopting elements of black culture has been prevalent at least since slavery was abolished in the Western world. The concept has been documented in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and other white-majority countries. An early form of this was the \"white negro\" in the jazz and swing music scenes of the 1920s and 1930s, as examined in the 1957 Norman Mailer essay \"The White Negro\". It was later seen in the zoot suiter of the 1930s and 1940s, the hipster of the 1940s, the beatnik of the 1950s–1960s, the blue-eyed soul of the 1970s, and the hip hop of the 1980s and 1990s. In 1993, an article in the UK newspaper \"The Independent\" described the phenomenon of white, middle-class kids who were \"wannabe Blacks\". 2005 saw the publication of \"Why White Kids Love Hip Hop: Wangstas, Wiggers, Wannabes, and the New Reality of Race in America\" by Bakari Kitwana, \"a culture critic who's been tracking American hip hop for years\"\".\"\n\nRobert A. Clift's documentary \"Blacking Up: Hip-Hop's Remix of Race and Identity\" questions white enthusiasts of black hip-hop culture. Clift's documentary examines \"racial and cultural ownership and authenticity -- a path that begins with the stolen blackness seen in the success of Stephen Foster, Al Jolson, Benny Goodman, Elvis Presley, the Rolling Stones -- all the way up to Vanilla Ice (popular music's ur-wigger...) and Eminem.\" A review of the documentary refers to the wiggers as \"white poseurs\", and states that the term \"wigger\" \"is used both proudly and derisively to describe white enthusiasts of black hip-hop culture\".\nThe term \"blackfishing\" was popularised in 2018 by writer Wanna Thompson, describing female white social media influencers who adopt a look perceived to be African including braided hair, dark skin from tanning or make-up, full lips, and large thighs. Critics argue they take attention and opportunities from black influencers by appropriating their aesthetic and have likened the trend to blackface.\n\nAmong critics, the misuse and misrepresentation of indigenous culture is seen as an exploitative form of colonialism, and one step in the destruction of indigenous cultures.\n\nThe results of this use of indigenous knowledge have led some tribes, and the United Nations General Assembly, to issue several declarations on the subject. The \"Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality\" includes the passage:\nArticle 31 1 of the United Nations \"Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples\" states:\n\nIn 2015, a group of Native American academics and writers issued a statement against the Rainbow Family members whose acts of \"cultural exploitation... dehumanize us as an indigenous Nation because they imply our culture and humanity, like our land, is anyone's for the taking.\"\n\nIn writing about Indigenous intellectual property for the Native American Rights Fund (NARF), board member Professor Rebecca Tsosie stresses the importance of these property rights being held collectively, not by individuals:\n\nThe long-term goal is to actually have a legal system, and certainly a treaty could do that, that acknowledges two things. Number one, it acknowledges that indigenous peoples are peoples with a right to self-determination that includes governance rights over all property belonging to the indigenous people. And, number two, it acknowledges that indigenous cultural expressions are a form of intellectual property and that traditional knowledge is a form of intellectual property, but they are collective resources – so not any one individual can give away the rights to those resources. The tribal nations actually own them collectively.\n\nUse of minority languages is also cited as cultural appropriation when non-speakers of Scottish Gaelic or Irish get tattoos in those languages. Likewise, the use of incorrect Scottish Gaelic in a tokenistic fashion aimed at non-Gaelic speakers on signage and announcements has been criticized as disrespectful to fluent speakers of the language.\n\nSince the early 2000s, it has become increasingly popular for people not of Asian descent, to get tattoos of devanagari, Korean letters or Han characters (traditional, simplified or Japanese), often without knowing the actual meaning of the symbols being used.\n\nAs of the 2010 census, Asian-Americans made up 4.8 percent of the U.S. population. According to a study by the University of Southern California Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism in 2016, one out of 20 (which corresponds to 5 percent) speaking roles go to Asian-Americans. However, they are given only one percent of lead roles in film. White actors account for 76.2 percent of lead roles, while representing 72.4 percent of the population according to the last US census.\n\nIn 2017, \"Ghost in the Shell\", which is based on the seinen manga \"Ghost in the Shell\" by Masamune Shirow, provoked disputes over whitewashing. Scarlett Johansson, a white actress, took the role of Motoko Kusanagi, a Japanese character. This was seen as cultural appropriation by some fans of the original manga who expected the role to be taken by an Asian or Asian-American actor.\n\nDuring Halloween, some people buy, wear, and sell Halloween costumes based on cultural or racial stereotypes. Costumes that depict cultural stereotypes, like \"Indian Warrior\" or \"Pocahottie\" are sometimes worn by people who do not belong to the cultural group being stereotyped. These costumes have been criticized as being in poor taste at best and, at worst, blatantly racist and dehumanizing. There have been public protests calling for the end to the manufacture and sales of these costumes and connecting their \"degrading\" portrayals of Indigenous women to the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women (MMIW) crisis. In some cases, theme parties have been held where attendees are encouraged to dress up as stereotypes of a certain racial group. A number of these parties have been held at colleges, and at times other than Halloween, including Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Black History Month.\n\nIn chapter four of his book \"Playing Indian\", Native American historian Philip J. Deloria refers to the Koshare Indian Museum and Dancers as an example of \"object hobbyists\" who adopt the material culture of indigenous peoples of the past (\"the vanishing Indian\") while failing to engage with contemporary native peoples or acknowledge the history of conquest and dispossession. In the 1950s, the head councilman of the Zuni Pueblo saw a performance and said: \"We know your hearts are good, but even with good hearts you have done a bad thing.\" In Zuni culture, religious object and practices are only for those that have earned the right to participate, following techniques and prayers that have been handed down for generations. In 2015, the Koshare's Winter Night dances were canceled after a late request was received from Cultural Preservation Office (CPO) of the Hopi Nation asking that the troop discontinue their interpretation of the dances of the Hopi and Pueblo Native Americans. Director of the CPO Leigh Kuwanwisiwma saw video of the performances online, and said the performers were \"mimicking our dances, but they were insensitive, as far as I'm concerned.\" In both instances, unable to satisfy the concerns of the tribes and out of respect for the Native Americans, the Koshare Dance Team complied with the requests, removed dances found to be objectionable, and even went so far as to give items deemed culturally significant to the tribes.\n\nThe objections from some Native Americans towards such dance teams center on the idea that the dance performances are a form of cultural appropriation which place dance and costumes in inappropriate contexts devoid of their true meaning, sometimes mixing elements from different tribes. In contrast, the dance teams state that \"[their] goal is to preserve Native American dance and heritage through the creation of dance regalia, dancing, and teaching others about the Native American culture.\"\n\nSome people in the transgender community have protested against the casting of straight, cis-gender actors in trans acting roles, such as when Eddie Redmayne played the role of artist Lili Elbe in the film \"The Danish Girl\" and when Jared Leto played the role of a trans woman named Rayon in \"Dallas Buyers Club\". Some in the gay community have expressed concerns about the use of straight actors to play gay characters; this occurs in films such as \"Call Me by Your Name\" (straight actors Armie Hammer and Timothée Chalamet), \"Brokeback Mountain\" (Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal), \"Philadelphia\" (Tom Hanks), \"Capote\" (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and \"Milk\" (with Sean Penn playing the role of the real-life gay rights activist, Harvey Milk). Jay Caruso calls these controversies \"wholly manufactured\", on the grounds that the actors \"are playing a role\" using the \"art of acting\".\n\nIn some cases, a culture usually viewed as the target of cultural appropriation can be accused of appropriation, particularly after colonization and an extensive period re-organization of that culture under the nation-state system. For example, the government of Ghana has been accused of cultural appropriation in adopting the Caribbean Emancipation Day and marketing it to African American tourists as an \"African festival\".\n\nFor some members of the South-Asian community, the wearing of a bindi dot as a decorative item, by a non-Hindu.\n\nA common term among Irish people for someone who imitates or misrepresents Irish culture is \"Plastic Paddy\".\n\nIn 2003, Prince Harry of the British royal family used Indigenous Australian art motifs in a painting for a school project. One Aboriginal group labelled it \"misappropriation of our culture\", saying that to Aboriginal people, the motifs have symbolic meanings \"indicative of our spiritualism\", whereas when non-Aborigines use the motifs they are simply \"painting a pretty picture\".\n\nIn the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2012, former Victoria's Secret model Karlie Kloss donned a Native American-style feathered headdress with leather bra and panties and high-heeled moccasins. This was said to be an example of cultural appropriation because the fashion show is showcasing the company's lingerie and image as a global fashion giant. The outfit was supposed to represent November, and thus \"Thanksgiving\", in the \"Calendar Girls\" segment. The outfit met with backlash and criticism as an appropriation of Native American culture and tradition. Victoria's Secret pulled it from the broadcast and apologized for its use. Kloss also commented on the decision by tweeting \"I am deeply sorry if what I wore during the VS Show offended anyone. I support VS's decision to remove the outfit from the broadcast.\"\n\nAvril Lavigne was cited by some as appropriating Japanese culture in her song \"Hello Kitty\". The song and music video depict Asian women dressed up in matching outfits and Lavigne eating Asian food while dressed in a pink tutu. Lavigne responded by stating \"I love Japanese culture and I spend half of my time in Japan. I flew to Tokyo to shoot this video ... specifically for my Japanese fans, \"with\" my Japanese label, Japanese choreographers \"and\" a Japanese director \"in\" Japan.\" Feedback for Lavigne's song was favorable in Japan, but \"[the] people who are blaming the artist for racism [were] non-Japanese.\"\n\nWhen Selena Gomez wore the bindi during a performance, there was debate on her reasoning behind wearing the culture specific piece. Some viewed this as \"casting her vote for Team India\" but it was also viewed as misuse of the symbol as Gomez was seen as not supporting or relating the bindi to its origin of Hinduism, but furthering her own self-expression. In 2014, Pharrell Williams posed in a Native American war bonnet on the cover of \"Elle\" UK magazine, after much controversy and media surrounding the photo Williams apologized.\n\nActress Amandla Stenberg made a school-related video called \"Don't Cash Crop on My Cornrows\" about the use of black hairstyles and black culture by non-black people, accusing Katy Perry and Iggy Azalea of using \"black culture as a way of being edgy and gaining attention\". Stenberg later criticized Kylie Jenner for allegedly embracing African-American aesthetic values without addressing the issues that affect the community. The African-American hip hop artist Azealia Banks has also criticized Iggy Azalea \"for failing to comment on 'black issues' despite capitalising on the appropriation of African American culture in her music.\" Banks has called Azalea a \"wigger\" and there have been \"accusations of racism against Azalea\" focused on her alleged \"insensitivity to the complexities of race relations and cultural appropriation.\"\nActivist Rachel Dolezal made headlines in 2015 when it was discovered that she was not African-American, as she had claimed. She is an American former civil rights activist known for being exposed as Caucasian while falsely claiming to be a black woman. Dolezal was president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) chapter in Spokane, Washington, from February 7, 2014 until June 15, 2015 when she resigned amid suspicion she had lied about nine alleged hate crimes against her. She received further public scrutiny when her white parents publicly stated that Dolezal was a white woman passing as black.\n\nIn 2017, in an interview with \"Billboard\" regarding her new image, Miley Cyrus criticized what she considered to be overly vulgar aspects of hip hop culture while expressing her admiration for the song \"Humble\" by Kendrick Lamar. This was met with backlash from people who felt Cyrus has a history of appropriating hip hop culture.\n\nIn June 2019, Kim Kardashian West was accused of cultural appropriation after announcing her shapewear line KIMONO, a pun on her first name. Critics argued that her goal to trademark the term was disrespectful to Japanese culture, as her filing for the international trademarking of the term \"kimono\" would prevent Japanese people from selling their traditional garb under the same name. The issue sparked the emergence of a Twitter hashtag, #KimOhNo, where Japanese people - both native and diaspora - tried to explain the cultural significance the kimono has in their culture. Additionally, a petition was started on Change.org, hoping to prevent West from gaining the trademark. The petitioner, Sono Fukunishi, argued that allowing West to obtain the trademark would allow foreigners to begin associating the original kimono with underwear. West later received a letter from Kyoto's mayor, Daisaku Kadokawa, asking her to reconsider trademarking the name. Kyoto is considered to be the kimono capital of the world. West has since announced to rebrand her shapewear under the name SKIMS.\n\nIn 2011, a group of students at Ohio University started a poster campaign denouncing the use of cultural stereotypes as costumes. The campaign features people of color alongside their respective stereotypes with slogans such as \"This is not who I am and this is not okay.\" The goal of the movement was to raise awareness around racism during Halloween in the university and the surrounding community, but the images also circulated online.\n\n\"Reclaim the Bindi\" has become a hashtag used by some people of South Asian descent who wear traditional garb, and object to its use by people not of their culture. At the 2014 Coachella festival one of the most noted fashion trends was the bindi, a traditional Hindu head mark. As pictures of the festival surfaced online there was public controversy over the casual wearing of the bindi by non-Indian individuals who did not understand the meaning behind it. Reclaim the Bindi Week is an event which seeks to promote the traditional cultural significance of the bindi and combat its use as a fashion statement.\n\nJohn McWhorter, a professor at Columbia University, criticized the concept in 2014, arguing that cultural borrowing and cross-fertilization is a generally positive thing, and is something which is usually done out of admiration, and with no intent to harm, the cultures being imitated; he also argued that the specific term \"appropriation\", which can mean theft, is misleading when applied to something like culture that is not seen by all as a limited resource. In 2018, conservative columnist Jonah Goldberg described cultural appropriation as a positive thing, and dismissed opposition to it as a product of some people's desire to be offended. Ethics columnist for the \"New York Times\", Kwame Anthony Appiah said that the term cultural appropriation incorrectly labels contemptuous behavior as a property crime. According to Appiah, \"The key question in the use of symbols or regalia associated with another identity group is not: What are my rights of ownership? Rather it's: Are my actions disrespectful?\"\n\nIn 2017, Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson described cultural appropriation as \"nonsense\", and said that with the exception of theft, \"there's no difference between cultural appropriation and learning from each other\".\n\nIn 2016, author Lionel Shriver asserted the right of authors from a cultural majority to write in the voice of someone from a cultural minority, attacking the idea that this constitutes cultural appropriation. Referring to a case in which U.S. college students were facing disciplinary action for wearing sombreros to a 'tequila party', she said \"The moral of the sombrero scandals is clear: \"you're not supposed to try on other people's hats\". Yet that's what we're paid to do, isn't it? Step into other people's shoes, and try on their hats.\" Upon winning the 2019 Booker Prize, Bernardine Evaristo dismissed the concept of cultural appropriation, stating that it is ridiculous to demand of writers that they not \"write beyond your own culture\".\n"}
{"id": "1982403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1982403", "title": "Effectiveness", "text": "Effectiveness\n\nEffectiveness is the capability of producing a desired result or the ability to produce desired output. When something is deemed effective, it means it has an intended or expected outcome, or produces a deep, vivid impression.\n\nThe origin of the word \"effective\" stems from the Latin word effectīvus, which means creative, productive or effective. It surfaced in Middle English between 1300 and 1400 A.D.\n\nIn mathematics, \"effective\" is sometimes used as a synonym of \"algorithmically computable\".\n\nIn physics, an effective theory is, similar to a phenomenological theory, a framework intended to explain certain (observed) effects without the claim that the theory correctly models the underlying (unobserved) processes. \n\nIn heat transfer, \"effectiveness\" is a measure of the performance of a heat exchanger when using the NTU method.\n\nIn medicine, effectiveness relates to how well a treatment works in practice, especially as shown in pragmatic clinical trials, as opposed to efficacy, which measures how well it works in explanatory clinical trials or research laboratory studies.\nIn management, effectiveness relates to \"getting the right things done\". Peter Drucker reminds us that \"effectiveness \"can\" and \"must\" be learned\".\n\nIn human–computer interaction, effectiveness is defined as \"the accuracy and completeness of users' tasks while using a system\".\n\nIn military science, effectiveness is a criterion used to assess changes determined in the target system, in its behavior, capability, or assets, tied to the attainment of an end state, achievement of an objective, or creation of an effect., while combat effectiveness is: \"...the readiness of a military unit to engage in combat based on behavioral, operational, and leadership considerations. Combat effectiveness measures the ability of a military force to accomplish its objective and is one component of overall military effectiveness.\"\n\nEfficacy, efficiency, and effectivity are terms that can, in some cases, be interchangeable with the term effectiveness. The word \"effective\" is sometimes used in a quantitative way, \"being very effective or not very effective\". However, neither effectiveness, nor effectively, inform about the direction (positive or negative) and the comparison to a standard of the given effect. Efficacy, on the other hand, is the extent to which a desired effect is achieved; the ability to produce a desired amount of the desired effect, or the success in achieving a given goal. Contrary to the term efficiency, the focus of efficacy is the achievement as such, not the resources spent in achieving the desired effect. Therefore, what is effective is not necessarily efficacious, and what is efficacious is not necessarily efficient.\n\nOther synonyms for effectiveness include: clout, capability, success, weight, performance.\nAntonyms for effectiveness include: uselessness, ineffectiveness. \n\nSimply stated, effective means achieving an effect, and efficient means achieving it with little waste. To illustrate: suppose, in order to arrest a murderer, the police bring in twenty officers, close off the streets and engage the man in a long gun battle before finally getting him in handcuffs. That would be effective, in the sense that the desired effect is achieved. But if the murderer steps out of his front door to smell the roses and three officers put the handcuffs on him, that is efficient.\n\n"}

However, the Hessian dialects have some features which set them somewhat apart from other West-Central German dialects.\n\nHessian can be divided into four main dialects, namely those of:\nTo understand this division, one must consider the history of Hesse and the fact that this state is the result of an administrative reform.\n\nThe urban regiolect of Frankfurt and the Rhine-Main area is based on the Southern Hesse dialect. In the Central Hessian dialect area, the Frankfurt regiolect is gradually replacing the traditional local dialects.\n\nConsonants are often softened, as outlined by Carsten Keil in his document \"A Quick Guide to the Language of Frankfurt\".

{"id": "1982411", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1982411", "title": "Dulag, Leyte", "text": "Dulag, Leyte\n\n', officially the ', is a in the province of , . According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThis coastal town has 11,007 hectares of land and lies south of the concurrent regional center of Eastern Visayas and the administrative capital of provincial government of Leyte, Tacloban.\n\nPopularly known as the \"Liberation Town\", Dulag survived and has risen from the ruins of the Second World War and at present time, a thriving coastal town fronting Leyte Gulf.\n\nIn 1954, the barrios of Mayorga, Andres Bonifacio, Talisay, San Roque, Burgos, Liberty, Union, Ormocay, Wilson, and the southern portion of barrio of Cogon Bingcay was separated to form the town of Mayorga, Leyte.\n\nDulag was a vital center of commerce in the eastern sector of the Leyte Island. Local and foreign ships docked at its seaport carrying merchants from seafaring nations who barter their products for local materials like abaca, copra, tobacco, rice and wine with the natives. Large warehouses Casa Sontua, Casa Petiksi, Casa Limpingco, Casa Ortega, Casa Gotauangco, and Casa Florentino lined the coastal shores of Dulag and fostered trading from neighboring towns Dagami, Tabontabon, Burauen, La Paz, MacArthur (formerly Taraguna), Julita and Mayorga. Goods from these towns were exported through Dulag to foreign countries.\n\nOther etymological versions explaining how Dulag got its name includes \"\"dulao\"\" (the medical herb turmeric, \"curcuma longa\"),\"\"nagdudulag\"\" (bones of wild animals scattered by hunters; scattered settlers), and \"\"dalag\"\" (vernacular term for catfish, \"ictalutus punctatus\", thriving along Candao River).\n\nDulag is one of the few barangays in Leyte that antedated the discovery of the Philippines in 1521. It is situated in the eastern coast of Leyte. There are several versions as to how Dulag got its name. The first was that in the early years of the 18th century, the town was already a flourishing community, the center of trade and commerce in eastern Leyte. The town then was considered the center of commercial activities going on thus it was named Dulag, the German term for center.\n\nAnother version states that it is the etymological variation of a certain herb called \"dulao\" which grew abundantly in the area. Dulao is a kind of plant which is yellowish-green in color used as a food seasoning for a local dish. Because of its abundance, the place was called after this herb.\n\nThe third version states that there was a time when bones of different kinds of animals were scattered all around the place. Whenever people would see bones all around, they always commented, \"nagdudulag hin tul-an.\" This means that bones were scattered all around. The word nagdudulag was then shortened to Dulag.\n\nThe last version says that the name could have come from the name of the first settler whom legend says was named Dulagdulag.\n\nThe first Jesuit missionaries arrived at Dulag in September 1595. An encomendero, Don Pedro Hernandez brought them in his boat from Cebu. The missionaries, Fr. Alonzo de Humanes and Fr. Juan del Campo, first coaxed the natives to settle within the limits of the sitio instead of living far from each other. After this was accomplished, the Jesuit fathers built a church and a convent.\n\nA nucleus of some 60 boys from Palo was formed by the fathers for the first mission school in Dulag. In the church compound they were taught their three R's and religion. Using the crudest of materials, the boys learned the Spanish language and helped serve as interpreters to the missionaries on their missions. The burden of supporting the boys began to tell on the resources of the padres but periodic allowances from the encomendero permitted them to continue with their studies. The school was patterned after a Jesuit school in Antipolo in Luzon, which the Jesuits had founded earlier.\n\nDulag became a booming locality by May 1596. It became the centrum of commercial activities. The Jesuits made great progress at conversion. They became successful especially when the principales of the town allowed themselves to be baptized.\n\nYears of peace were suddenly broken when on October 29, 1603, moro raiders ravaged the town. Wild confusion followed after the arrival of 70 vintas full of moros. Some of the precious possessions of the church were fortunately evacuated before the moros finally landed on the shores of Dulag.\n\nBolisan, the Moro leader sailed away to Surigao after 700 captives and rich loot had safely been stored in the holds of their vintas. Fr. Hurtado, one of the missionary priests was himself a captive. During the years that followed, the padre was able to teach Christianity to the Moros. He was later ransomed and returned to Dulag.\n\nThe Moro raids were said to have burned 10 churches in Leyte. Sacred images were destroyed, sacred vessels were looted, and new Christians enslaved.\n\nAfter the Moro raids, more misfortune struck the town. Two typhoons destroyed the church and laid waste the harvest of the season. An earthquake of violent proportions followed this. In 1610, a locust invasion destroyed more crops. In September 1611, more typhoons added to the desolation of the people. As if to climax the lean years, the Moros returned in 1613, destroyed the church and town, burned the harvest and carried of men, women and children to be sold as slaves. The parish priest, Fr. Pascual Acuña was also captured by the moros. He was later released in exchange for a Moro chief named Pagdalunan who was captured by the Spaniards.\n\nBefore the Jesuits left in 1768, they had built a brick church under the avocation of the Nativity of Our Lady. It was significantly called the \"Refugio.\"\n\nAfter the expulsion of the Jesuits, the Augustinians took over then parish. Fr. Cipriano Barbasan is specially remembered for enlarging and remodeling the church. He was responsible for the ornamentation of the church altar and the construction of lookout towers of the hills of Calbasag and Mount Laberanan in San Jose. Both were solid edifices of brick which served as places of refuge during subsequent attacks by the Moros.\n\nIn 1843, the first Franciscan parish priest arrived. Under the direction of Fr. Francisco Rosas, the first road to Abuyog was constructed.\n\nA long line of gobernadorcillos ruled the town. From Basilio de Paz to Hilario Saño, the town progressed further. During the revolutionary period, Julio Villagracia and Rosendo Cornel governed. Like other towns, Dulag suffered from depredations of the insurrectors and the pulahanes.\n\nDuring the American regime, Emilio Celso Abad was elected the first capitan. The steady progress of the town resulted in the expansion of the town limits.\n\nMarcial Lagunzad was the mayor of Dulag when the Japanese occupied the town. He was tactful, so many lives were spared but unfortunately he died during the early days of the liberation during an American bombing raid.\n\nThe landing of the American forces, which took place from October 17 to 20, 1944 took a heavy toll on the Municipality's townspeople. The church, public buildings as well as residences were razed to the ground. The streets that used to be concrete and asphalt crumbled to rubble after concentrated American shelling.\n\nFor a time, after the shelling of Dulag, the seat of government was transferred to Mayorga, one of the barrios. Slowly, the people returned to the town and under the leadership of Mayor Nicolas Bautista, Dulag, phoenix-like, rose from the ashes.\n\nTranscriber's Note: One of the reasons Dulag was so heavily shelled during the American invasions was an airstrip located in present-day Barangay Rawis. The American's needed to gain control of the airstrip in order to further the invasion. The old remains of the airstrip are still present in Barangay Rawis today (although much overgrown with surrounding jungle). Many Dulagnons continue to refer to Barangay Rawis as 'the airport.' -- Brian Watson.\n\nDulag covers 11,007 hectares in land area in the eastern side of Leyte Island fronting the Gulf of Leyte. The terrain is characterized mainly by generally flat sloping land rolling terrain in the western section.\n\nFrom Tacloban City, one can reach Dulag by land traversing the route via the Maharlika Highway. Travel time usually takes three-quarter minutes to full one hour.\n\nLeyte Gulf washes its western shores in Dulag. The town is bounded 12 kilometers to the north by the Municipality of Tolosa; to the west, about 7 kilometers lies the Municipality of Julita; and 7 kilometers south is the Municipality of Mayorga.\n\nThe prevailing climate type is similar in all eastern coastal towns of the province. The climate is type 2 in category wherein there is no definite dry or wet season throughout. Rainfall is more or less evenly distributed throughout the year. Maximum rainfall is from November to January. During weather disturbances (typhoon) some barangays are easily flooded. These barangays are found along Daang Maharlika, along the Daguitan River, and within the poblacion. Among these are Barangays Barbo, Alegre, Fatima, Salvacion; Districts of Combis, Market Site and Cambula, and the elementary school therewith, though there is no definite pattern of occurrence.\n\nBeing the foremost basic need of man, the absence of clean and sanitary pipe water system throughout the locality is a big problem. Most water sources came from tube pumps, dug wells, aside from few places with faucet potable water system.\n\nPer 2006 Barangay Profile Survey on sources of potable water supply, the following result revealed that out of the total number of households, only about 513 or 5.98% are dependent on owned-use faucet system of potable water, where households get water supply from a faucet inside the house/yard directly connected to a water pipeline from their own water system (electric pump).\n\nThere are 2,299 households or 26.80% that take their drinking water from a tube/pipe well (jetmatic/pitcher pump) for private use of the household, 637 household or 11.87 takes their water from a deep well of another household or establishment or from a deep well constructed for public use.\n\nSome important uses water are for taking a shower, taking a bath, washing hands, brushing teeth and washing dishes. Other use water to flush and clean the toilet, wash vehicles, and even water the plants.\n\nOut of 8,580 households, 58.93% or about 5,057 household got water from their own Jetmatic/Pitcher Pump for their laundry and/or bathing. Other sources were recipient of community water system (2.03%), owned electric pumps (5.07%), shared to an electric water pump (1.94%), shared to a Jetmatic/Pitcher Pump from a neighbor (14.56%), dug well (14.56%) and some get water from peddlers (2.91%).\n\nDulag is politically subdivided into 45 barangays. In 1957, the sitio of Inawangan was converted into barrio Kamitok. In the same year, Mat-i was renamed President Roxas, Cogon-Bingkay was renamed Salvacion, and sitio Pamoblaran was converted into barrio San Antonio.\n\nIn the , the population of Dulag, Leyte, was people, with a density of .\n\nDulag population density is higher than the national density. This means that considering the total land area of the municipality and its present population, Dulag is considered a low density town. There are 4 people living in a hectare tract of land or 400 people living in every square kilometer. Within the municipality, Barangay Buntay had a high population density of 154 persons per hectare, followed by Barangay Candao, and Barangay Market Site with 62 persons per hectare and 50 persons per hectare, respectively.\n\nThe age structure of the population of Dulag deviated from the usual pyramid shape. The age group 10–14 years old had the largest population with 11.46%, followed by 5–9 years old (11.44%). The male populace constitutes about 50.57% of the total population, and about 49.42% are female. This becomes a one is to one (1:1) gender ratio.\n\nBased from the 2006 Barangay Profile Survey data, the total dependents of the municipality represented about 17,761 while the working group is 26,382. This means that each working individual will support an average of 1.4 heads as dependent.\n\nA current survey on mother-tongue languages used in Dulag households reveals that 97.75% (43,148) of the 44,143 residents are Waray-waray speaking; 1.17% (516) speaks Cebuano; and 1.06% speaks Tagalog. This result reinforces that Dulag is indeed a Waray-waray speaking town.\n\nWaray-waray is a language in the Visayan language family spoken in the provinces of Samar, Northern Samar, Eastern Samar, Leyte (eastern portion), and Biliran in the Philippines. This Austronesian language has several dialects and remains to be an integral part of the Filipino language with about 3,000,000 speakers.\n\nMajority of the residents of Dulag are Roman Catholic as they comprise 97.21% participation rate. Smaller religious groups such as Members Church of God International, popularly known as Ang Dating Daan, Iglesia ni Kristo, Dulag Christian Bible Church (Non-Denominational, Born Again, Christian), Born Again, Baptist, Jehovah's Witnesses, UCCP, etc. share the remainder 2.79% of the total population.\n\nThe residents and territories of Dulag are governed by the barangay, municipal, provincial and national governments of the Philippines.\n\nDulag is subdivided into 45 barangays (the basic political unit in governance in the Philippines). Of the 45 barangays, 11 are within the urbanized poblacion (town proper); while, 34 are situated in the rustic countryside.\n\nThe barangay plays a pivotal role as the planning and implementing unit of government policies, programs and activities. Each barangay is led and governed by its Barangay Officials. The Barangay considered as a Local Government Unit (LGU) same as the Provincial and the Municipal Government. It is composed of a Punong Barangay (Barangay Captain/Chief), a Sanguniang Barangay (Barangay Council) with seven (7) Barangay Kagawads (Barangay Members) who are all duly-elected by their constituents, and a Sangguniang Kabataan (Youth Council) Chairman afforded with full membership status in the Council after being duly-elected but only by the barangay's youth sector. Thus, there are eight (8) members of the Legislative Council in a barangay. Each Kagawad has his/her own respective Committee where he/she is the chairperson. Three (3) members are appointed to carry out the functions of each committee. Below are the committees in the Barangay Council:\n\nThe \"Punong-bayan\"/\"Meyor\"/\"Alkalde\" (Municipal Mayor) is the chief executive officer of the town. As mandated by the 1991 Local Government Code of the Philippines authored by Sen. Aquilino Pimentel Jr., the Mayor has the power to:\n\n\nNext in the line of succession in the Municipal Government is the \"Pangalawang Punong-bayan\"/\"Bise-Alkade\" (Vice Mayor) who is concurrently the presiding officer of the \"Sangguniang Bayan\" (Municipal Council). Aside from being the presiding officer in the Municipal Council, the Vice Mayor may also appoint officials and employees of the Municipal Council, assume the office of the Municipal Mayor and its powers, duties and functions for the unexpired term of the latter in the event of permanent vacancy, and exercise such powers and perform such other duties and functions as may be prescribed by law or ordinance.\n\nThe local legislature of Dulag is called the \"Sangguniang Bayan\" (Municipal Council). Ten (10) \"Konsehal\" (Councilors) represent their constituents. The Council is composed of eight (8) Councilors, plus the President of the local Association of Barangay Councils (ABCs), and the President of the Federation of Sangguniang Kabataan (SK) as ex-officio members. It is the Municipal Vice Mayor who serves as its presiding officer, and may only vote to \"break the tie\" should there be a stalemate during floor deliberations.\n\nThe Council is divided into several committees to which council matters are referred prior to floor deliberations. The committees are composed of five council members each, inclusive of the respective committee chairmen and vice-chairmen. Although the council's powers are basically legislative in nature, they may exercise certain quasi-judicial functions, especially on matters requiring thorough investigation and fact-finding procedures.\n\nIn accordance to the Local Government Code of the Philippines, the Municipal Council may therefore:\n\nIt is also required of the Barangay Councils to submit their respective legislations and budget schedules to the City Council for the latter's review and recommendation for the Mayor's approval.\n\nThe Municipal Officials serve three-year terms and are allowed a maximum of three consecutive terms in their respective positions. However, they may run for the same office again only after one term of non-incumbency for such functions.\n\nDulag, along with rest of the towns in Leyte, is governed by the Provincial Government of Leyte. The Provincial Government is headed by the \"Gobernador\" (Governor) and assisted by the \"Bise-Gobernador\" (Vice Governor) and the \"Bokal\" (duly elected Board Members and ex officio members) of the \"Sangguniang Panlalawigan\" (Provincial Board). The provincial officials have similar if not the same functions as the municipal officials. Provincial officials have greater scope of authority as they govern on the interest of the constituents within the province.\n\nWorld War II veterans who witnessed on October 20, 1944 the landing of Gen. Douglas MacArthur during the Battle of Leyte Gulf.\n\nVeterans claim that the General did not land in Palo, Leyte as history books have stated. But instead, Gen. MacArthur landed first in Dulag, Leyte. The veterans had several evidences to substantiate their claims.\n\nAn evidence of such claim is the tourist attraction \"Hill 120\" in Dulag, Leyte. Another proof is that when the General landed he passed by an old church. Based from accounts, the said Dulag church fits the description given by the veterans.\n\nThe other one is that a few days upon the return of General MacArthur in Philippine soil, Forces of Liberation in Leyte with the Philippine Commonwealth troops made Dulag's neighboring town Tolosa a U.S. Navy base, the 6th of 13th Air Force. It was in Tanghas, a barangay in Tolosa, where the famous American composer Irving Berlin, first performed his renowned composition \"Heaven Watch the Philippines\" for his Filipino audience with then Philippine President Sergio Osmeña and Gen. Carlos P. Romulo. Tolosa is a next town after Dulag.\n\nThe Municipal Health Office is manned by one (1) Municipal Health Physician (MHP), two (2) Public Health Nurses (PHN), eight (8) Rural Health Midwives (RHM), one (1) Rural Sanitary Inspector (RSI), one (1) Medical Technologist, one (1) Dental Aide, four (4) Medical Aide/Clerks, two (2) Utility Workers and two (2) Volunteer Nurses.

The Babraham Institute is based on the Babraham Research Campus, partly occupying a former manor house, but also laboratory and science facility buildings on the campus, surrounded by an extensive parkland estate, just south of Cambridge, England. It is an independent and charitable organization which is involved in biomedical research, including healthy aging and molecular biology. Its latest director was Professor Michael Wakelam, who had been in post since 2007.\n\nThe institute is located on the historic Babraham Hall Estate (now called the Babraham Research Campus), situated six miles south-east of Cambridge University, near the Gog Magog Hills. It is close to where the ancient Roman Via Devana crossed the prehistoric Icknield Way. The estate includes Babraham Hall, designed in the Jacobean style by Philip Hardwick, which was built between 1832 and 1837. The hall was purchased by the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) in 1948 at the suggestion of Prof Ivan De Burgh Daly, together with 182 hectares of farm and woodland to become the Institute of Animal Physiology, Babraham.\n\nIn 1986, The Institute of Animal Physiology was joined with two Scottish institutes based at Roslin, The Animal Breeding Research Organisation (ABRO) and the Poultry Research Centre, to form The Institute of Animal Physiology and Genetics Research (IAPGR) funded by the Agricultural and Food Research Council (AFRC). In 1993, Roslin and Babraham formed two separate institutes, at which time the Babraham Institute assumed its current name. in 1994, The AFRC was disbanded and The Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) was formed. All work with direct relevance to agriculture ceased in 1998.\n\nThe aim of the research conducted at The Babraham Institute is to study the molecular mechanisms that underlie normal cellular processes and functions, and to understand how these systems are affected by age. The Institute's work also covers how faults or abnormalities in these systems may contribute to disease. The Institute has the status of a postgraduate department within the University of Cambridge and trains PhD students who are registered with the University's Faculty of Biology. The research laboratories of the Institute are structured around three strategic programmes:\n\n\nResearch breakthroughs made at the Babraham Institute include the discovery of liposomes by Alec Bangham, the role of Inositol trisphosphate in the release of Calcium from intracellular stores by Michael Berridge, the discovery that genomic imprinting was carried by DNA methylation by Wolf Reik.\n\nMany of its past and current employees were elected fellows of the Royal Society, including Drs Ivan de Burgh Daly (1943), Sir John Henry Gaddum (1945), Marthe Vogt (1952), Richard Darwin Keynes (1959), Sir Barry Cross (1975), Sir Robert Brian Heap (1989), M Azim Surani (1990), Robin Francis Irvine (1993), Jonathan Charles Howard (1995), Wolf Reik (2010), Len Stephens (2011), Phil Hawkins (2013).\n\nBabraham Institute Enterprise Ltd (BIE), the wholly owned trading subsidiary of the Babraham Institute promotes knowledge transfer and translation of the Institute’s research discoveries, actively managing and exploiting the Institute’s intellectual property, promoting and negotiating commercial research partnerships and establishing spin-out companies when appropriate.\n\nThe Institute's research programmes are primarily supported by Institute Strategic Programme Grants (ISPGs) awarded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), part of UK Research and Innovation.

It is often used in reference along with \"Linux on Power\", and is also the name of several Linux-only IBM Power Systems.\n\nIn the late 1990s, IBM began considering the Linux operating system. In 2000, IBM announced it would promote Linux. In 2001, IBM invested $1 billion to back the Linux movement, embracing it as an operating system for IBM servers and software. Within a decade, Linux could be found in virtually every IBM business, geography and workload, and continues to be deeply embedded in IBM hardware, software, services and internal development.\n\nA survey released by the Linux Foundation in April 2012 showed IBM as the fifth-leading commercial contributor over the past seven years, with more than 600 developers involved in more than 100 open-source projects.\n\nIBM established the Linux Technology Center (LTC) in 1999 to combine its software developers interested in Linux and other open-source software into a single organization. The LTC collaborated with the Linux community to make Linux run optimally on PowerPC, x86, and more recently, the Cell Broadband Engine. Developers in the LTC contribute to various open-source projects as well as projects focused on enabling Linux to use new hardware functions on IBM platforms.\n\nLinux has run on IBM POWER systems since 2001, when a team created a new, 64-bit port for the Linux kernel to allow the OS to run on PowerPC processors.\nThe first system to fully support the 64-bit Linux kernel was IBM’s POWER5, created in 2004. It was followed by POWER6 in 2007 and the current POWER7-based systems in 2010.\n\nLinux was first ported to POWER in June 2000. Since then PowerLinux was used in a number of supercomputers including MareNostrum 2004 and Roadrunner 2008.\n\nBeginning in April 2012, IBM introduced three POWER7 processor-based Linux-specific systems for big data analytics, industry applications and open-source infrastructure services such as Web-serving, email and social media collaboration services.\n\nThe IBM PowerLinux 7R1 and IBM PowerLinux 7R2 systems are one- and two-socket, rack-mount servers that support either 8 or 16 POWER7 microprocessor cores in 3.55 GHz (7R1 only) or, with the 7R2, 3.55 and 3.3 GHz options with 128 GB maximum memory (for the 7R1) or 256 GB maximum memory (7R2) that can be configured with 8, 16 and 32 GB dual inline memory modules (DIMMs). Both systems run Linux operating systems: Red Hat Enterprise Linux or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server and include a built-in PowerVM [for PowerLinux] hypervisor that supports up to 10 VMs per core and 160 VMs per server.\n\nThe IBM PowerLinux 7R4 is a POWER7+ processor-based system in a 5U package with two or four sockets and 16 or 32 cores. It can accommodate up to 1 TB of 1066 MHz DDR3\nActive Memory Sharing. PowerVM for Linux dynamically adjusts system resources to partitions based on workload demands-across up to 640 VMs per server (20 micropartitions per core).\n\nIn a study on systems and architecture for big data, IBM Research found that a 10-node Hadoop cluster of PowerLinux 7R2 nodes with POWER7+ processors, running InfoSphere BigInsights software, can sort through a terabyte of data in less than 8 minutes.\n\nIBM also introduced the IBM Flex System p24L Compute Node, a Linux-specific two-socket compute node for the recently announced IBM PureFlex System, which contains 12 or 16 POWER7 microprocessor cores, up to 256 GB of memory, the option of Red Hat Enterprise Linux or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server operating systems and built-in PowerVM for PowerLinux.\n\nIn addition to these specific products, Linux is capable of running on any Power series hardware.\n\nThe April 2012 releases by IBM of PowerLinux were designed specifically to run the Linux OS on the company’s POWER7-based systems. Unlike servers built on the Intel Xeon processor, an x86 descendant with two threads per core, the POWER7 processor provides four threads per core. POWER-based servers are virtualized to provide 60 to 80 percent utilization, compared to a typical 40-percent rate for x86 processors. The PowerVM virtualization program has a Common Criteria Evaluation Assurance (CC) level of 4+, with zero security vulnerabilities reported, as well as unlimited memory use.\n\nPOWER-based IBM systems have built in virtualization capabilities derived from mainframe technology. On System P, this virtualization package is referred to as PowerVM. PowerVM includes virtualization capabilities such as micro-partitioning, active memory sharing, active memory deduplication, a virtual I/O server for virtual networks and storage, and live partition mobility.

The magazine was launched in March 1992 and initially used only Indian and Pakistani models from the United Kingdom. Later, Asian models from other countries were also included. The magazine was initially published by Northern & Shell, a newspaper and magazine publishing group owned by the businessman Richard Desmond. In 2004 Northern & Shell sold the magazine to Remnant Media, a publishing company which produced a number of other pornographic magazines. Remnant went into administration in 2007 and the magazine was then bought by Trojan Publishing and subsequently by Interactive Publishing. \"Asian Babes\" had ceased publication by 2012.\n\nIn 1983, Northern & Shell obtained the licence to publish \"Penthouse\" in the United Kingdom which led to its development of a portfolio of adult titles, with \"Asian Babes\" being among them. It was one of the first British pornographic magazines to feature Asian models, and was initially published on an experimental basis. It was, however, an immediate success, with sales of 160,000 copies. The company was also responsible for the release of \"Electric Blue\" softcore pornography videos titled \"Asian Babes\" in 1993. According to a 1995 survey by the magazine, most of its readers were white men.\n\n\"Asian Babes\", along with other titles such as \"Readers' Wives\", was part of Desmond's portfolio of soft-porn magazines which was offered for sale in 2001. There were concerns that some investors were reluctant to invest in pornography, and that the market for such magazines was changing. \"Asian Babes\" was finally sold in 2004 as part of a package of 45 titles to Remnant Media for a reported £20 million (approximately US$39 million). After the magazine had been sold, the Bank of Scotland issued an apology for having loaned £5 million (US$9.8 million) to Remnant Media in order to facilitate the purchase. Remnant Media went into administration in 2007 and the title was bought by Trojan Publishing and subsequently Interactive Publishing. The magazine had ceased publication by 2012.\n\nThe publication of \"Asian Babes\" caused controversy in the British Asian community. Models came into conflict with their families and boycotts were organised against newsagents selling the magazine.\n\nDesmond's ownership of the porn magazines was often criticized and frequently used to bolster criticism of his business practices. Yasmin Alibhai-Brown, a columnist for \"The Independent\" in London, England, characterized Desmond as \"the seedy porn baron who gives this nation \"Mega Boobs\" and \"Asian Babes\" and other yuck and muck\". The column criticized the way in which Desmond had made use of the \"Daily Express\"; Alibhai-Brown's column was not focused on Desmond's publishing activities with regard to pornography. She went on to say: \"Actually, I am less bothered about the porn mags than many... I made myself look at \"Asian Babes\" and it is true that the 'babes' themselves look exceedingly full of life, not pushed into any of the poses\".\n\nInformation about Desmond's ownership of \"Asian Babes\" and other adult magazines was included in a BBC Online 2004 profile which spoke to the controversy surrounding his ownership of \"top-shelf\" (pornographic) magazines at the same time he was attempting to purchase \"The Daily Telegraph\".\n\n"}

KG () is a German manufacturing company based in Nuremberg. The firm was founded by J.S. Staedtler in 1835 and produces a large variety of stationery products, such as writing implements (including technical drawing instruments), Art materials, and office supplies.\n\nStaedtler claims to be the largest European manufacturer of wood-cased pencils, OHP pens, mechanical pencils, leads, erasers, and modelling clays. Staedtler has over 20 global subsidiaries and seven manufacturing facilities. Over 85% of the production takes place in the headquarters in Nuremberg, though some of its products are made in Japan. Its \"Noris\" line of pencils are extremely common in British schools.\n\nThe origins of the brand can be traced since the 17th century, when Friedrich Staedtler took over the totality of the pencil manufacturing process, from the lead to the wood. Nevertheless, that activity was forbidden by the Council of Nuremberg, which stated that the manufacturing had to be developed by two different experts. Finally, Staedtler's work helped to abolish that regulation, therefore facilitating the work of other pencils manufacturers in Nuremberg.\n\nThe company was founded by Johann Sebastian Staedtler in 1835 as a pencil factory, first established in Nuremberg, but the roots of the company go back to 1662, when references to Friedrich Staedtler as a pencil-making craftsman were made in the city annals. Staedtler received permission from the municipal council to produce blacklead, red chalk and pastel pencils in his industrial plant. In 1866, the company had 54 employees and produced 15,000 gross (2,160,000 pencils) per year.\nIn 1900, Staedtler registered the \"Mars\" brand (which represented the Ancient Roman religion god of war), using the name for some lines of products, also launching the \"head of Mars\" logo. In 1901 the \"Noris\" brand was released by the company.\n\nIn 1922 a United States subsidiary (located in New York) was established, It was followed by a Japanese subsidiary four years later. In 1937 the name was changed to \"Mars Pencil and Fountain Pen Factory\" and the product range was expanded to include mechanical writing instruments. In 1949 began the production of ballpoint pens, which started to be widely used instead of fountain pens (although Staedtler still produces the latter today).\n\nIn 1950 propelling pencils (or mechanical pencils) began to be manufactured, the first being made out of wood. Four years later, the \"Lumocolor\" brand was registered. This brand was used to design the wide range of Staedtler markers. The head of Mars became the Staedtler definitive logo in 1958. This logo has had several style modifications since then, the last in 2001.\n\nIn 1962 the company began producing technical pens. In the 1970s, Staedtler bought the Neumarkt factory, which used to be the Eberhard Faber factory. Nevertheless, in 2009 Staedtler sold the rights to the brand \"Eberhard Faber\" to Faber-Castell, although the company kept the Neumarkt factory, where Staedtler makes wood pencils nowadays. \nAs from 2010, Fimo (modelling clay products), Mali, Aquasoft and further brands were marketed under the Staedtler name. In addition, the company celebrated its 175th anniversary that same year.\n\nThe following chart contains all the Staedtler product lines:\n\nStaedtler has won awards for its products, most recently for the Wopex Graphite Pencils (designed with \"Teams Design\") and the Triplus line.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Typically, any line or part thereof which is outside of the viewing area is removed.\n\nThere are two common algorithms for line clipping: Cohen–Sutherland and Liang–Barsky.\n\nA line-clipping method consists of various parts. Tests are conducted on a given line segment to find out whether it lies outside the view volume. Afterwards, intersection calculations are carried out with one or more clipping boundaries.\n\nDetermining which portion of the line is inside or outside of the clipping volume is done by processing the endpoints of the line with regards to the intersection.\n\nIn computer graphics, the Cohen–Sutherland algorithm (named after Danny Cohen and Ivan Sutherland) is a line-clipping algorithm. The algorithm divides a 2D space into 9 regions, of which only the middle part (viewport) is visible.\n\nIn 1967, flight-simulation work by Danny Cohen led to the development of the Cohen–Sutherland computer graphics two- and three-dimensional line clipping algorithms, created with Ivan Sutherland.\n\nThe Liang–Barsky algorithm uses the parametric equation of a line and inequalities describing the range of the clipping box to determine the intersections between the line and the clipping box. With these intersections it knows which portion of the line should be drawn. This algorithm is significantly more efficient than Cohen–Sutherland, but Cohen–Sutherland does trivial accepts and rejects much faster, so it should be considered instead if most of the lines you need to clip would be completely in or out of the clip window.\n\nVery similar to Liang–Barsky line-clipping algorithm. The difference is that Liang–Barsky is a simplified Cyrus–Beck variation that was optimized for a rectangular clip window.\n\nThe Cyrus–Beck algorithm is primarily intended for a clipping a line in the parametric form against a convex polygon in 2 dimensions or against a convex polyhedron in 3 dimensions.\n\nThe Nicholl–Lee–Nicholl algorithm is a fast line-clipping algorithm that reduces the chances of clipping a single line segment multiple times, as may happen in the Cohen–Sutherland algorithm. The clipping window is divided into a number of different areas, depending on the position of the initial point of the line to be clipped.\n\nThis algorithm has similarities with Cohen–Sutherland. The start and end positions are classified by which portion of the 9-area grid they occupy. A large switch statement jumps to a specialized handler for that case. In contrast, Cohen–Sutherland may have to iterate several times to handle the same case.\n\nThis algorithm classifies vertices against the given line in the implicit form \"p\": \"ax\" + \"by\" + \"c\" = 0. As the polygon is assumed to be convex and vertices are ordered clockwise or anti-clockwise, binary search can be applied and leads to a \"O\"(lg \"N\") run-time complexity.\n\nThis algorithm is based on homogeneous coordinates and duality. It can be used for line or line-segment clipping against a rectangular window, as well as against a convex polygon. The algorithm is based on classifying a vertex of the clipping window against a half-space given by a line \"p\": \"ax\" + \"by\" + \"c\" = 0. The result of the classification determines the edges intersected by the line \"p\". The algorithm is simple, easy to implement and extensible to a convex window as well. The line or line segment p can be computed from points r, r given in homogeneous coordinates directly using the cross product as\nor as\n\n"}

Ransomes also manufactured Direct Current electric motors in a wide range of sizes, and electric forklift trucks and tractors. They manufactured aeroplanes during the First World War. Their base, specially set up in 1845, was named Orwell Works.\n\nRansomes' railway equipment business was hived off in 1869 with a different ownership as Ransomes & Rapier and based nearby at Waterside Ironworks.\n\nThe enterprise was started by Robert Ransome (1753-1830), who was born into a Quaker family in Norfolk, and became an apprentice to an ironmonger in Norwich. The Quaker values of frugal living, avoiding debt and keeping regular accounts served him well when he set up one of the first brass and iron foundries in East Anglia near White-Friars Bridge, Norwich. He obtained a patent for iron roofing tiles in 1783, and another for tempered cast iron plough shares some 18 months later. In 1789, he moved with his family and one employee named William Rush to Ipswich, where he started casting ploughshares in a disused malting at St Margaret's Ditches, with capital of £200. It was not an obvious place to go, as the town had been in decline for more than a century, and the Corporation was almost insolvent due to huge debts. \n\nThe fortunes of Ipswich improved when Commissioners were appointed in 1793 to pave the streets, number the houses, and carry out other public works. It became a garrison town when war with France restarted in the same year, which resulted in increased economic and industrial activity. In 1805, an Act of Parliament was obtained, enabling River Commissioners to be appointed, who were to improve the river, allowing ships to reach the town. Despite a period of social unrest, caused by a really bad winter, high prices for coal, and food riots, Robert's son James James Ransome (1782–1849) served his apprenticeship in the foundry, and then moved to Great Yarmouth to start his own business. \n\nAs a result of a mishap in his foundry in 1803, when a broken mould caused molten metal to come into contact with cold metal, making the metal surface extremely hard, Robert discovered the process of chilled casting. He used it to refine the manufacture of plough shares, which he advertised as 'self sharpening' ploughs, and obtained a patent for his discovery. His next patent was obtained in 1808, and was for the standardisation of plough fittings, enabling parts to be easily replaced when they wore out.\nIn 1809 Robert Ransome, now aged 56, was looking for someone younger to take the business forwards. His eldest son James returned from Great Yarmouth to become his father's partner, bringing with him several of his skilled craftsmen. Now called Ransome and Son, the business prospered, with output doubling over the next six years. Another period of social unrest followed, with agricultural depression and the introduction of the Corn Laws in 1815. Robert had employed William Cubitt in 1812 as the company engineer, and they diversified so they were not solely dependent on the sale of agricultural products. They cast the components for Stoke Bridge, Ipswich, which was swept away in a flood in 1818. Cubitt was responsible for the new design, and the bridge lasted for over 100 years. Cubitt's designs for wind-regulating vanes for windmills and a treadmill for grinding corn in prisons were also manufactured, and he then supervised the installation of gas lighting in Ipswich, which included the construction of a gasometer near to the foundry. Cubbitt became a partner in the firm in 1821, but continued to carry out consultancy work in his own right. He was in such demand that he moved on in 1826, to pursue his civil engineering career, for which he was later knighted.\n\nIn 1826 James's son known as Allen but technically James Allen Ransome (1806–1875) went to live at Yoxford, Suffolk, where he established a branch of the business. In 1839 Allen Ransome moved from Yoxford to Ipswich and under his direction the firm of J, R & A Ransome (James, Robert and Allen Ransome) was to assume huge proportions. Charles May had joined the company in 1836, and played a major part in the expansion, as he was a brilliant chemist and scientist. In 1837 William Worby the works manager was asked to find a new location for some of the workforce, as the St Margaret's Ditches site was no longer big enough. He found an old shipyard on the eastern bank of the River Orwell, covering . This became Orwell Works, and the company embarked on the construction of a dock scheme, to give them over of quay on the eastern edge of the new wet dock, construction of which had begun in 1837, and continued for some five years. The designer and chief engineer for the wet dock was Henry Robinson Palmer, assisted by James Jones, one of the founder members of the Institution of Civil Engineers. He left the scheme in 1842 to become Ransomes' manager, a position he held until 1852. \n\nAfter about 1841 the manufacture of ploughs and other agricultural machinery was supplemented by production of portable, traction and other steam engines and thrashing machines.\n\nIn the middle decades of the 19th century the company produced heavy iron work for astronomical telescopes, mountings, and observatories.\n\nThese included\n\nIn 1851 export trade was initiated which by the early 20th century was more important than the home market and included distributing agencies throughout the world with a branch establishment in Odessa.\n\nIn 1869 four engineers, Allen, who remained the senior partner in the parent firm, his elder son R.J. Ransome, R.C. Rapier and A.A. Bennett, took the firm's railway department aside from the parent business and established Ransomes & Rapier at Riverside Works, Ipswich.\n\nAn independent factory was set up for the manufacture of lawn mowers of every class Ransomes produced the 'Automaton' hand-powered lawn mower in 1867.\n\nIn 1902 Ransomes produced the first commercially available powered lawn mower, driven by an internal combustion gasoline engine. In 1910 they won gold medal at the South Russian Regional Agricultural Industrial and Crafts Exhibition for steam thrashing machines and portable steam engines.\n\nDuring the First World War, they began building \"Orwells\", a brand of battery-electric commercial road vehicles. They also manufactured aeroplanes, producing 350 Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2b fighters. These were constructed in a large building occupying , while the site at that time contained an administrative block of offices including a large drawing office, and laboratories in which physical, chemical and photo-micrographic testing of materials used in production was carried out. Once the First World War was over, aeroplane production ceased, and the aeroplane shop was used for the production of Orwell battery lorries from January 1919. In 1924 they added trolleybuses to their portfolio, continuing production of them until 1948, and selling them in Britain and abroad. \n\nIn the 1950s Ransomes started producing forklifts, Class 1 Lift Code 5 (Electric Sit Down Counterbalance). With the start of production of the A Series, Ransomes forklifts were sold by the Hyster dealership network under Hyster serial number codes (A21R, A22R, A23R - the R standing for Ransomes Ipswich plant). The codes still show in the Hyster serial number system.\n\nRansomes also started producing Class 2 Lift Code 3 (Electric Stand On Reach Straddle) machines. Later the company expanded to producing Class 6 Lift Code 1 (Electric Tow Tractors).\n\nWhen Hyster Corporation bought Lewis Sheppard, the largest market for Ransomes forklifts disappeared. In the early 1980s Ransomes sold their forklift line to Hawkins Mechanical Handling, which produced machines under the Hamech Ransomes brand name. Hawkins Mechanical Handling was later purchased by Crown, and the Hamech name retired, until 2004, when Crown brought it back for use in an Internal Combustion Engined forklift line.\n\nRansomes also made electric stillage-carrying trucks for use in factories.\n\nIn 1989 the whole of the agricultural implement business was sold to Electrolux and merged with their subsidiary Överum.\n\nThis left Ransomes solely as a manufacturer of lawn mowers, with the Ransomes, Westwood and Mountfield mower brands. The company accepted a take-over offer from Textron Inc., USA, and their independent existence ended early in 1998. Westwood and Mountfield were later sold in a management buyout.\n\nThe history of the company and preceding businesses is the subject of an exhibition at the Museum of East Anglian Life in Stowmarket, Suffolk and they are also represented in Ipswich Transport Museum.\n\nRansomes started producing lawnmowers in 1832, at a time of social unrest when labourers were destroying machinery such as thrashing machines, and agitation for Parliamentary reform meant that some Tory farmers would not buy items made by the Quaker firm of Ransomes. The product had been invented by Edwin Budding of Stroud, and was manufactured under licence. They sold 70 to 80 machines a year for the next two decades.\n\nRansomes to this day still produce a variety of grass cutting equipment; from professional high quality turf machines to more industrial gang mowers for use on wider areas such as public parks etc. yet they do still make a range of pedestrian mowers for use on manicured lawns and bowling greens for example.\n\nIn the 1910's there were a number of electric road vehicles operating in Britain, but most were of American or European, particularly German, manufacture, and with the First World War cutting off supplies from the Continent, Ransomes decided to begin production of a suitable replacement. The construction of the vehicle was quite simple, with an electric motor mounted on a plate, which was attached to the stub axle of each front wheel. Helical gearing then drove the front wheels. 40 batteries were mounted in two panniers, one on either side of the chassis, which could easily be pulled out on a system of rollers, to aid maintenance. The controls were designed to be similar to those on a petrol lorry, with a foot pedal in the clutch position, which disconnected the batteries when pressed down, and reconnected them in three stages when it was released. The brake pedal operated brakes on both of the rear wheels, and the motor speed was controlled by a level mounted above the steering column, similar to the throttle on petrol-engined vehicles of the time. There were five positions for forward motion, one for reversing, and one for electric braking. In 1916, the vehicles were marketted by Mossay and Co.\n\nIn September 1918, it was noted that the only other British manufacturer of electric vehicles was Richard Garrett & Sons of nearby Leiston, although there were two companies selling American imports. However, buying the vehicles was not straightforward, as an application had to be made to the Ministry of Munitions, to obtain a Priority Certificate. They were still subject to restrictions in January 1919, when they asked for a penalty clause to be removed from a contract for supplying vehicles to Ilford UDC, as they were a controlled firm and had no say as to when they could deliver their products. They regularly sold vehicles to local authorities, with many of these sales recorded in the \"Wheels of Industry\" columns of \"Commercial Motor\" magazine. In November 1918 two lorries with automatic tipping bodywork were driven from Ipswich to local authorities in Wolverhampton and Stoke on Trent. They proceeded at , and were able to find charging points at regular intervals. A delivery to Birmingham in 1919 found that the only place without a proper charging station was Northampton, and a spare battery was used to mitigate that problem.\n\nIn September 1919, they were producing four vehicles a week, but the limiting factor was the difficulty in buying the machine tools necessary for manufacture. They were hoping to double that output by the end of the month, and produce 12 vehicles per week shortly afterwards. At the time they were producing two models, a 2.5-ton model with the motors mounted on the front wheels, and a 3.5-ton model where the motors were mounted in the middle of the vehicle and drove the rear wheels though helical reduction gears and roller chains. Both types used regenerative braking, where the motor was driven as a dynamo, which not only slowed the vehicle down, but put power back into the batteries. A standard charging socket was fitted, as approved by the Electric Vehicle Committee, and the vehicle could not be moved while the charging plug was inserted. Tipping bodies were controlled from the cab, and had a central screw which ran parallel to the chassis. Power to the motor was automatically disconnected when the body reaches its highest or lowest extent. The company had been successful in selling to their own local authority, as Ipswich ran a fleet of 13 Ransomes electric vehicles.\n\nFor the 1920 motor show, they introduced a new 2.5-ton model where the rear wheels were driven by roller chains, similar to the 3.5-ton model. In 1921 Ransomes produced a 40-seat battery-electric bus for conveying miners between a railway station and the mine entrance in Lancashire. \"Commercial Motor\" noted that the seats were not upholstered, as they would soon become dirty and damaged in that application. They also felt there was sufficient interest in Ransomes vehicles to carry a 3-page article on their maintenance in February 1921. By the end of the year, Ransomes had added a 4.5-to-5-ton model to their range, which was similar in construction to the 3.5-ton model. A review of electric vehicle usage by municipalities in 1922 showed that Ransomes were the second most popular type, with some 120 vehicles in operation, only exceeded by the 234 vehicles supplied by Edison of Detroit. By late 1925, the cleaning departments of 40 local authorities were using Ransomes vehicles for the collection of refuse.\n\nIn practice, the vehicles proved to be highly reliable. For the \"Commercial Motor\" cup, held in 1927, London Wholesale Dairies entered three vehicles into the electric section. They had been driven around per day, delivering milk to wholesale buyers, doing railway station work, and finally taking empty bottles back to the station. This was achieved by using two crews, and two top-up charges during the day, before full recharging in the evenings. Two of the vehicles were from Ransomes, and had covered and since delivery. The third vehicle, which won the competition, had covered and was made by Edison. One of the vehicles supplied to Ipswich Corporation in 1915 and used constantly since, was still working well in March 1934.\n\nIn 1923, Ipswich Corporation opened their first trolleybus route in the town, using three vehicles from Railless. Ransomes saw an opportunity opening up on their doorstep, and produced an \"improved electric trolleybus\". It was based on the Railless design, with a high, straight chassis, but in other respects was simpler. A motor powered the back axle through a worm and wheel arrangement. They built their own motors and controllers, which were hand-operated as they were based on those used in trams. They also built their own bodywork, with seats for 30 passengers and a front entrance. After testing, the trolleybus entered public service in Ipswich during 1924. They assessed the vehicle in operation, and then designed a Type C prototype, based on their conclusions. The chassis was lower, enabling the floor level to be above the road level, and requiring passengers to negotiate two steps, rather than the three on the first vehicle. This was made possible by moving the motor, this time rated at , over the front axle. Another significant advance was the replacement of the hand-operated controller with a foot-operated pedal, leaving the driver's hands free to steer the vehicle, use the handbrake and sound the horn. It ran for five months on the Ipswich system from December 1925, and when further vehicles became available, it was fitted with pneumatic tyres, had its entrance moved to the other side, and was sold for use in Poznań, Poland.\n\nFollowing the trials of the Type C prototype, Ipswich placed an order for 15 Type D trolleybuses, with an entrance forwards of the front axle, and another behind the rear axle, designed for two man operation in peak periods and one man operation at other times. This required the motor to be mounted in the centre of the vehicle, and the floor level was increased to . They produced a number of variations to suit the needs of individual customers, and in 1928 produced two double-deck vehicles based on the Type D chassis for Nottingham, and a D6 3-axle chassis. As well as fitting their own electrical equipment, they also used equipment from British Thomson-Houston and Allan West if customers required it, but stopped building their own bodywork. The business prospered, and although they sold a total of 123 vehicles to eleven municipal users in Britain, 305 trolleybuses were sold abroad. They also entered into an agreement with the Italian company Stigler some time before 1935, allowing them to build Ransomes-Stigler 3-axle trolleybuses for Milan. These had 24 seats, but could also carry 66 standing passengers.\n\nOverseas customers included the trolleybus systems in Cape Town, who placed an order for 20 single-deck and 30 double-deck vehicles in 1935, Port of Spain in Trinidad and Tobago, George Town, Penang, and Singapore. They sold their last trolleybus in Britain in 1940, when a 2-axle demonstrator built for a tour of South Africa, which was cancelled when the Second World War started, was bought by Ipswich, and their final order in 1948 was for six vehicles for Drammen in Norway, after which they withdrew from the trolleybus market. Ipswich Corporation had bought 66 of their first 86 trolleybuses from Ransomes, and although Ransomes produced a leaflet in 1939 stating that all of the trolleybuses operating in Ipswich had been made by them, this was never actually true. Three Ransomes trolleybuses are known to survive in preservation, two at the Ipswich Transport Museum, who also own the chassis of a fourth, and one at the Science Museum, London's store at Wroughton near Swindon.\n\nThe business begun by Robert Ransome was later owned as partners by various individuals.

{"id": "1982496", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1982496", "title": "Nuclear force", "text": "Nuclear force\n\nThe nuclear force (or nucleon–nucleon interaction or residual strong force) is a force that acts between the protons and neutrons of atoms. Neutrons and protons, both nucleons, are affected by the nuclear force almost identically. Since protons have charge +1 \"e\", they experience an electric force that tends to push them apart, but at short range the attractive nuclear force is strong enough to overcome the electromagnetic force. The nuclear force binds nucleons into atomic nuclei.\n\nThe nuclear force is powerfully attractive between nucleons at distances of about 1 femtometre (fm, or 1.0 × 10 metres), but it rapidly decreases to insignificance at distances beyond about 2.5 fm. At distances less than 0.7 fm, the nuclear force becomes repulsive. This repulsive component is responsible for the physical size of nuclei, since the nucleons can come no closer than the force allows. By comparison, the size of an atom, measured in angstroms (Å, or 1.0 × 10 m), is five orders of magnitude larger. The nuclear force is not simple, however, since it depends on the nucleon spins, has a tensor component, and may depend on the relative momentum of the nucleons.\n\nThe nuclear force plays an essential role in storing energy that is used in nuclear power and nuclear weapons. Work (energy) is required to bring charged protons together against their electric repulsion. This energy is stored when the protons and neutrons are bound together by the nuclear force to form a nucleus. The mass of a nucleus is less than the sum total of the individual masses of the protons and neutrons. The difference in masses is known as the mass defect, which can be expressed as an energy equivalent. Energy is released when a heavy nucleus breaks apart into two or more lighter nuclei. This energy is the electromagnetic potential energy that is released when the nuclear force no longer holds the charged nuclear fragments together.\n\nA quantitative description of the nuclear force relies on equations that are partly empirical. These equations model the internucleon potential energies, or potentials. (Generally, forces within a system of particles can be more simply modeled by describing the system's potential energy; the negative gradient of a potential is equal to the vector force.) The constants for the equations are phenomenological, that is, determined by fitting the equations to experimental data. The internucleon potentials attempt to describe the properties of nucleon–nucleon interaction. Once determined, any given potential can be used in, e.g., the Schrödinger equation to determine the quantum mechanical properties of the nucleon system.\n\nThe discovery of the neutron in 1932 revealed that atomic nuclei were made of protons and neutrons, held together by an attractive force. By 1935 the nuclear force was conceived to be transmitted by particles called mesons. This theoretical development included a description of the Yukawa potential, an early example of a nuclear potential. Pions, fulfilling the prediction, were discovered experimentally in 1947. By the 1970s, the quark model had been developed, by which the mesons and nucleons were viewed as composed of quarks and gluons. By this new model, the nuclear force, resulting from the exchange of mesons between neighboring nucleons, is a residual effect of the strong force.\n\nWhile the nuclear force is usually associated with nucleons, more generally this force is felt between hadrons, or particles composed of quarks. At small separations between nucleons (less than ~ 0.7 fm between their centers, depending upon spin alignment) the force becomes repulsive, which keeps the nucleons at a certain average separation. For identical nucleons (such as two neutrons or two protons) this repulsion arises from the Pauli exclusion force. A Pauli repulsion also occurs between quarks of the same flavour from different nucleons (a proton and a neutron).\n\nAt distances larger than 0.7 fm the force becomes attractive between spin-aligned nucleons, becoming maximal at a center–center distance of about 0.9 fm. Beyond this distance the force drops exponentially, until beyond about 2.0 fm separation, the force is negligible. Nucleons have a radius of about 0.8 fm.\n\nAt short distances (less than 1.7 fm or so), the attractive nuclear force is stronger than the repulsive Coulomb force between protons; it thus overcomes the repulsion of protons within the nucleus. However, the Coulomb force between protons has a much greater range as it varies as the inverse square of the charge separation, and Coulomb repulsion thus becomes the only significant force between protons when their separation exceeds about 2 to 2.5 fm.\n\nThe nuclear force has a spin-dependent component. The force is stronger for particles with their spins aligned than for those with their spins anti-aligned. If two particles are the same, such as two neutrons or two protons, the force is not enough to bind the particles, since the spin vectors of two particles of the same type must point in opposite directions when the particles are near each other and are (save for spin) in the same quantum state. This requirement for fermions stems from the Pauli exclusion principle. For fermion particles of different types, such as a proton and neutron, particles may be close to each other and have aligned spins without violating the Pauli exclusion principle, and the nuclear force may bind them (in this case, into a deuteron), since the nuclear force is much stronger for spin-aligned particles. But if the particles' spins are anti-aligned the nuclear force is too weak to bind them, even if they are of different types.\n\nThe nuclear force also has a tensor component which depends on the interaction between the nucleon spins and the angular momentum of the nucleons, leading to deformation from a simple spherical shape.\n\nTo disassemble a nucleus into unbound protons and neutrons requires work against the nuclear force. Conversely, energy is released when a nucleus is created from free nucleons or other nuclei: the nuclear binding energy. Because of mass–energy equivalence (i.e. Einstein's formula ), releasing this energy causes the mass of the nucleus to be lower than the total mass of the individual nucleons, leading to the so-called \"mass defect\".\n\nThe nuclear force is nearly independent of whether the nucleons are neutrons or protons. This property is called \"charge independence\". The force depends on whether the spins of the nucleons are parallel or antiparallel, as it has a non-central or \"tensor\" component. This part of the force does not conserve orbital angular momentum, which under the action of central forces is conserved.\n\nThe symmetry resulting in the strong force, proposed by Werner Heisenberg, is that protons and neutrons are identical in every respect, other than their charge. This is not completely true, because neutrons are a tiny bit heavier, but it is an approximate symmetry. Protons and neutrons are therefore viewed as the same particle, but with different isospin quantum numbers; conventionally, the proton is \"isospin up,\" while the neutron is \"isospin down\". The strong force is invariant under SU(2) isospin transformations, just as other interactions between particles are invariant under SU(2) transformations of intrinsic spin. In other words, both isospin and intrinsic spin transformations are isomorphic to the SU(2) symmetry group. There are only strong attractions when the total isospin of the set of interacting particles is 0, which is confirmed by experiment.\n\nOur understanding of the nuclear force is obtained by scattering experiments and the binding energy of light nuclei.\nThe nuclear force occurs by the exchange of virtual light mesons, such as the virtual pions, as well as two types of virtual mesons with spin (vector mesons), the rho mesons and the omega mesons. The vector mesons account for the spin-dependence of the nuclear force in this \"virtual meson\" picture.\n\nThe nuclear force is distinct from what historically was known as the weak nuclear force. The weak interaction is one of the four fundamental interactions, and plays a role in processes such as beta decay. The weak force plays no role in the interaction of nucleons, though it is responsible for the decay of neutrons to protons and vice versa.\n\nThe nuclear force has been at the heart of nuclear physics ever since the field was born in 1932 with the discovery of the neutron by James Chadwick. The traditional goal of nuclear physics is to understand the properties of atomic nuclei in terms of the 'bare' interaction between pairs of nucleons, or nucleon–nucleon forces (NN forces).\n\nWithin months after the discovery of the neutron, Werner Heisenberg and Dmitri Ivanenko had proposed proton–neutron models for the nucleus. Heisenberg approached the description of protons and neutrons in the nucleus through quantum mechanics, an approach that was not at all obvious at the time. Heisenberg's theory for protons and neutrons in the nucleus was a \"major step toward understanding the nucleus as a quantum mechanical system.\" Heisenberg introduced the first theory of nuclear exchange forces that bind the nucleons. He considered protons and neutrons to be different quantum states of the same particle, i.e., nucleons distinguished by the value of their nuclear isospin quantum numbers.\n\nOne of the earliest models for the nucleus was the liquid drop model developed in the 1930s. One property of nuclei is that the average binding energy per nucleon is approximately the same for all stable nuclei, which is similar to a liquid drop. The liquid drop model treated the nucleus as a drop of incompressible nuclear fluid, with nucleons behaving like molecules in a liquid. The model was first proposed by George Gamow and then developed by Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker. This crude model did not explain all the properties of the nucleus, but it did explain the spherical shape of most nuclei. The model also gave good predictions for the binding energy of nuclei.\n\nIn 1934, Hideki Yukawa made the earliest attempt to explain the nature of the nuclear force. According to his theory, massive bosons (mesons) mediate the interaction between two nucleons. In light of quantum chromodynamics (QCD)—and, by extension, the Standard Model—meson theory is no longer perceived as fundamental. But the meson-exchange concept (where hadrons are treated as elementary particles) continues to represent the best working model for a quantitative \"NN\" potential. The Yukawa potential (also called a screened Coulomb potential) is a potential of the form\n\nwhere \"g\" is a magnitude scaling constant, i.e., the amplitude of potential, formula_2 is the Yukawa particle mass, \"r\" is the radial distance to the particle. The potential is monotone increasing, implying that the force is always attractive. The constants are determined empirically. The Yukawa potential depends only on the distance between particles, \"r\", hence it models a central force.\n\nThroughout the 1930s a group at Columbia University led by I. I. Rabi developed magnetic resonance techniques to determine the magnetic moments of nuclei. These measurements led to the discovery in 1939 that the deuteron also possessed an electric quadrupole moment. This electrical property of the deuteron had been interfering with the measurements by the Rabi group. The deuteron, composed of a proton and a neutron, is one of the simplest nuclear systems. The discovery meant that the physical shape of the deuteron was not symmetric, which provided valuable insight into the nature of the nuclear force binding nucleons. In particular, the result showed that the nuclear force was not a central force, but had a tensor character. Hans Bethe identified the discovery of the deuteron's quadrupole moment as one of the important events during the formative years of nuclear physics.\n\nHistorically, the task of describing the nuclear force phenomenologically was formidable. The first semi-empirical quantitative models came in the mid-1950s, such as the Woods–Saxon potential (1954). There was substantial progress in experiment and theory related to the nuclear force in the 1960s and 1970s. One influential model was the Reid potential (1968).\n\nIn recent years, experimenters have concentrated on the subtleties of the nuclear force, such as its charge dependence, the precise value of the π\"NN\" coupling constant, improved phase shift analysis, high-precision \"NN\" data, high-precision \"NN\" potentials, \"NN\" scattering at intermediate and high energies, and attempts to derive the nuclear force from QCD.\n\nThe nuclear force is a residual effect of the more fundamental strong force, or strong interaction. The strong interaction is the attractive force that binds the elementary particles called quarks together to form the nucleons (protons and neutrons) themselves. This more powerful force, one of the fundamental forces of nature, is mediated by particles called gluons. Gluons hold quarks together through color charge which is analogous to electric charge, but far stronger. Quarks, gluons, and their dynamics are mostly confined within nucleons, but residual influences extend slightly beyond nucleon boundaries to give rise to the nuclear force.\n\nThe nuclear forces arising between nucleons are analogous to the forces in chemistry between neutral atoms or molecules called London forces. Such forces between atoms are much weaker than the attractive electrical forces that hold the atoms themselves together (i.e., that bind electrons to the nucleus), and their range between atoms is shorter, because they arise from small separation of charges inside the neutral atom. Similarly, even though nucleons are made of quarks in combinations which cancel most gluon forces (they are \"color neutral\"), some combinations of quarks and gluons nevertheless leak away from nucleons, in the form of short-range nuclear force fields that extend from one nucleon to another nearby nucleon. These nuclear forces are very weak compared to direct gluon forces (\"color forces\" or strong forces) inside nucleons, and the nuclear forces extend only over a few nuclear diameters, falling exponentially with distance. Nevertheless, they are strong enough to bind neutrons and protons over short distances, and overcome the electrical repulsion between protons in the nucleus.\n\nSometimes, the nuclear force is called the residual strong force, in contrast to the strong interactions which arise from QCD. This phrasing arose during the 1970s when QCD was being established. Before that time, the \"strong nuclear force\" referred to the inter-nucleon potential. After the verification of the quark model, \"strong interaction\" has come to mean QCD.\n\nTwo-nucleon systems such as the deuteron, the nucleus of a deuterium atom, as well as proton–proton or neutron–proton scattering are ideal for studying the \"NN\" force. Such systems can be described by attributing a \"potential\" (such as the Yukawa potential) to the nucleons and using the potentials in a Schrödinger equation. The form of the potential is derived phenomenologically (by measurement), although for the long-range interaction, meson-exchange theories help to construct the potential. The parameters of the potential are determined by fitting to experimental data such as the deuteron binding energy or \"NN\" elastic scattering cross sections (or, equivalently in this context, so-called \"NN\" phase shifts).\n\nThe most widely used \"NN\" potentials are the Paris potential, the Argonne AV18 potential, the CD-Bonn potential and the Nijmegen potentials.\n\nA more recent approach is to develop effective field theories for a consistent description of nucleon–nucleon and three-nucleon forces. Quantum hadrodynamics is an effective field theory of the nuclear force, comparable to QCD for color interactions and QED for electromagnetic interactions. Additionally, chiral symmetry breaking can be analyzed in terms of an effective field theory (called chiral perturbation theory) which allows perturbative calculations of the interactions between nucleons with pions as exchange particles.\n\nThe ultimate goal of nuclear physics would be to describe all nuclear interactions from the basic interactions between nucleons. This is called the \"microscopic\" or \"ab initio\" approach of nuclear physics. There are two major obstacles to overcome:\n\nThis is an active area of research with ongoing advances in computational techniques leading to better first-principles calculations of the nuclear shell structure. Two- and three-nucleon potentials have been implemented for nuclides up to \"A\" = 12.\n\nA successful way of describing nuclear interactions is to construct one potential for the whole nucleus instead of considering all its nucleon components. This is called the \"macroscopic\" approach. For example, scattering of neutrons from nuclei can be described by considering a plane wave in the potential of the nucleus, which comprises a real part and an imaginary part. This model is often called the optical model since it resembles the case of light scattered by an opaque glass sphere.\n\nNuclear potentials can be \"local\" or \"global\": local potentials are limited to a narrow energy range and/or a narrow nuclear mass range, while global potentials, which have more parameters and are usually less accurate, are functions of the energy and the nuclear mass and can therefore be used in a wider range of applications.\n\n\n"}

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 1, 1996. In the episode, Milhouse's parents Kirk and Luann get a divorce, causing Homer to examine his own marriage. It was directed by Steven Dean Moore and is the only episode for which Steve Tompkins has sole writing credit.\n\nMarge invites the Flanders, the Lovejoys, the Hibberts and the Van Houtens to a dinner party. While the other guests enjoy themselves, Kirk and Luann Van Houten bicker. They get more quarrelsome as the party continues and Luann demands a divorce. Kirk moves into a singles complex and gets fired from his job at the cracker factory. Luann adjusts to life as a single parent with Milhouse and starts dating Chase, an American Gladiator.\n\nAt Moe's, Kirk muses that he never saw the divorce coming and regrets not being a better husband. Kirk's cheap girlfriend Starla tosses his demo tape on the street while stealing his car, so Homer tries to console him and boasts that his marriage to Marge is rock-solid.\n\nHowever, Homer soon starts to fear that his marriage may end in divorce because he is a poor husband. Homer enlists Lisa's help to save his marriage, but she is unable to offer any advice beyond observing that he is lucky to have Marge as his wife. He recalls their no-frills wedding, followed by a cheesy wedding cake at a roadside truck stop. To save their marriage, Homer performs selfless gestures for Marge which only annoy her.\n\nDeciding that Marge deserves a fresh start, Homer secretly files for a divorce. Marge returns home that night and is surprised to find all of the Simpsons' friends gathered in the living room. Homer declares that he wants to be remarried, with a perfect wedding this time. Reverend Lovejoy reads the rambling wedding vows Homer has written himself, and Marge and Homer are remarried.\n\nKirk tries to reconcile with Luann by singing her a corny love song from his demo tape. Luann rebuffs him and Chase kicks him out of the house.\n\"A Milhouse Divided\" is the only episode for which Steve Tompkins has sole writing credit, although he had been a part of the writing staff for several years. The writers wanted to do an episode that involved a couple getting divorced. The Van Houtens were chosen because the writers felt that they were the most developed couple next to Marge and Homer and the Lovejoys. The scene in the episode \"Sideshow Bob's Last Gleaming\" where Milhouse is in a jet pretending to fire missiles at his parents is where they got the idea to have his parents' marriage be in trouble.\n\nOriginally, the episode also focused on the divorce's effects on Milhouse and there was a subplot that involved Bart being jealous of Milhouse and wishing that Marge and Homer would also separate. Several scenes were written and animated for the episode, but ultimately they were cut because the script was very long. A similar idea would go on to be used as a plot point in the season 17 episode \"Milhouse of Sand and Fog\". The third act of the episode shifts the focus from the Van Houtens to Homer and Marge because the writers felt that tertiary characters could not carry an audience's interest for an entire episode. Bill Oakley has said that he felt the episode would have failed had they stuck with the Van Houtens for the third act and most of the other writers also felt that it was the right move.\n\nThe idea for the dinner party came from Oakley, who had wanted to have a party similar to the one in \"The War of the Simpsons\". For the second half of the episode, Luann was redesigned to look more youthful and was given a new outfit. A big name singer was originally sought to sing \"Can I Borrow a Feeling?\" over the end credits. The writers wanted Sheryl Crow, but she declined and the concept was later dropped.\n\nIn its original broadcast, \"A Milhouse Divided\" finished tied for 50th in the weekly ratings for the week of November 25 – December 1, 1996, with a Nielsen rating of 8.3 and was viewed in 8 million homes. It was the fourth-highest-rated show on the Fox Network that week.\n\nWarren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book \"I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide\", called it \"More drama than comedy, and very honest in its dealings with the Van Houtens' divorce and its effects on Milhouse.\"\n\n"}

In 1996 The Ark released an EP featuring four songs, of those \"Racing With The Rabbits\" being the most known. The EP gained very little success in both critical and commercial sense. Martin Axén officially joined the band in 1997, and Sylvester Schlegel in 1999. In late 2005, Jens Andersson joined The Ark as an official member. He had at that point played live with the band for several years.\n\nOla Salo was the main songwriter of the group and his lyrics have sometimes been seen controversial. For example, the 2002 single \"Father of a Son\" is about homosexuals’ right to adopt. In October 2006, the band was criticized by members of the U.S. public for some controversial comments referring to the September 11, 2001 attacks that were apparently part of the joking banter between songs as the band performed at the opening festivities for the new Swedish embassy in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe Ark also performed in the Melodifestivalen 2007 with the song \"The Worrying Kind\". The song won the contest after capturing both the popular vote and the jury's vote. The song was Sweden's Eurovision Song Contest 2007 entry, and is also included in The Ark's fourth album Prayer for the Weekend, released in April 2007. Despite being a bookmaker favorite, it finished in 18th place (out of 24)\n\nIn 2006 The Ark toured the UK acting as the warm-up band for The Darkness. \"One of Us is Gonna Die Young\" was used in the 2007 snowboarding video, \"Picture This\" from Mack Dawg Productions for Seth Huot and Andreas Wiig's video part, also was it used for the Sam Blenkinsop and Philip Polc Section of the FOX Racing Shox 2007 sequel. \"Let Your Body Decide\" was used in the 2010 film 'Super' starring Rainn Wilson and Ellen Page. Their all-time hit remains being the 2000s manifesto for one's freedom in life, \"It Takes A Fool To Remain Sane\". It gained massive radio play especially in Sweden and Italy.\n\nOn December 8, 2010 the band announced that they would be breaking up after the release of their greatest hits compilation, \"Arkeology\", and the following spring and summer tours. Arkeology contained two new songs, \"Breaking Up With God\" and \"The Apocalypse Is Over\". The Ark won numerous awards during their 20 years together and were lauded as the most successful Swedish band since ABBA, even being recognized by MTV as the most influential northern group of the last 10 years. Ola Salo and Jepson appeared once in \"Expressen\", a Swedish newspaper, where they were referred to as two of the 10 most important personalities in Scandinavia.\n\nThey made their last concert at the amusement park, Gröna Lund, in Stockholm 16 September 2011. The crowd was counted up to around 15,000 people.\n\nOn the 13th of February 2020, The Ark announced they're doing a reunion tour for the summer 2020, starting in Stockholm the 28th of June.\n\n\n\nNicklas Stenemo: Keyboards (2000).\n\n\nNotes\n\n"}
{"id": "1982519", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1982519", "title": "Weather Underground (weather service)", "text": "Weather Underground (weather service)\n\nWeather Underground is a commercial weather service providing real-time weather information over the Internet. Weather Underground provides weather reports for most major cities across the world on its Web site, as well as local weather reports for newspapers and third-party sites. Its information comes from the National Weather Service (NWS), and over 250,000 personal weather stations (PWS). The site is available in many languages, and customers can access an ad-free version of the site with additional features for an annual fee. Weather Underground is owned by The Weather Company, a subsidiary of IBM.\n\nThe company is based in San Francisco, California and was founded in 1995 as an offshoot of the University of Michigan Internet weather database. The name is a reference to the 1960s militant radical student group the Weather Underground, which also originated at the University of Michigan.\n\nJeff Masters, a doctoral candidate in meteorology at the University of Michigan working under the direction of Professor Perry Samson, wrote a menu-based Telnet interface in 1991 that displayed real-time weather information around the world. In 1993, they recruited Alan Steremberg and initiated a project to bring Internet weather into K–12 classrooms. Weather Underground president Alan Steremberg wrote \"Blue Skies\" for the project, a graphical Mac Gopher client, which won several awards. When the Mosaic Web browser appeared, this provided a natural transition from \"Blue Skies\" to the Web.\nIn 1995 Weather Underground Inc. became a commercial entity separate from the university. It has grown to provide weather for print sources, in addition to its online presence. In 2005, Weather Underground became the weather provider for the Associated Press; Weather Underground also provides weather reports for some newspapers, including the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" and the Google search engine. Steremberg also worked on the early development of the Google search engine with Larry Page and Sergey Brin.\n\nIn October 2008, Jeff Masters reported that the site was No. 2 for Internet weather information in 2008.\n\nIn February 2010, Weather Underground launched FullScreenWeather.com, a full screen weather Web tool with integrated mapping and mobile device use in mind.\n\nOn July 2, 2012, The Weather Channel announced that it would acquire Weather Underground, which would become operated as part of The Weather Channel Companies, LLC, which was later renamed \"The Weather Company\". The Weather Underground Web site continues to operate as a separate entity from The Weather Channel primary site, weather.com, with its existing staff retained. Third-party Web analytics providers Alexa and SimilarWeb rate the site as the 117th and 98th most-visited site in the United States, respectively, as of July 2015. SimilarWeb rates the site as the second most visited weather website globally, attracting more than 47 million visitors per month. The Weather Company also uses the site's San Francisco headquarters as a regional office.\n\nThe site popularity also helped launch a television show hosted by meteorologist Mike Bettes, which airs on The Weather Channel from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. ET, except during storm coverage; in which case the show is extended to 9 p.m. or 10 p.m.\n\nOn October 28, 2015, Jeff Masters noted that IBM had officially announced an agreement to acquire The Weather Company business-to-business, mobile and cloud-based Web properties, including Weather Underground, WSI, weather.com, and also the Weather Company brand. The Weather Channel television service remained a separate entity, later sold to Entertainment Studios in 2018. The deal was finalized on January 29, 2016.\n\nOn October 3, 2019, Jeff Masters announced that he will be leaving Weather Underground.\n\nWeb logs (blogs) was one of the main features in Weather Underground, allowing users of the site to create blogs about weather, everyday life and anything else. Jeff Masters started the first blog on April 14, 2005, and he posts blog entries nearly every day. From 2007 through early 2017 Richard B. Rood wrote blogs on climate change and societal response, with new entries on a weekly basis.\n\nOn October 14, 2016, the Wunderblog announced that it would be changing their name to Category 6, a name suggested by Jeff Masters. They decided on the name, because it \"alludes to our deep fascination with all types of weather and climate extremes, including the many important facets of our changing climate\", and \"will provide all the insight and expert analysis needed to put the extreme events of our evolving 21st-century climate into context.\"\n\nOn April 3, 2017 Weather Underground ended all Member blogs, WUMail, SMS alerts, NOAA Weather Radio rebroadcast and Aviation. As part of this transition, Category 6 will get a new look. All posts by Jeff Masters, Bob Henson and Weather Underground featured bloggers were moved to Category 6. Users can no longer contact each other or have blogs, nor are they permitted to question or criticize the opinions of Masters and Henson in the comment section.\n\nWeather Underground also uses observations from members with automated personal weather stations (PWS). Weather Underground uses observations from over 250,000 personal weather stations worldwide.\n\nThe Weather Underground's WunderMap overlays weather data from personal weather stations and official NWS stations on a Mapbox Map base and provides many interactive and dynamically updated weather and environmental layers. On November 15, 2017, users were notified by email that their worldwide, user-provided weather cameras would cease to be available on December 15, 2017. However, on December 11, 2017 users received another email from Weather Underground announcing that they were reversing their position and would not be discontinuing the service based on significant user feedback.\n\nThe service previously distributed Internet radio feeds of NOAA Weather Radio stations from across the country, as provided by users, and had a Weather Underground Braille Page.\n\nThe Associated Press uses Weather Underground to provide national weather summaries.\n\nWeather Underground has several Google Chrome extensions and applications for iPhone, iPad and Android including FullScreenWeather.com, a redirect to a full screen weather viewer tied into OpenStreetMap. There was an app developed for Roku devices, which has been deleted.\n\nIn February 2015, Weather Underground released an iOS app called Storm. This app is universal, and can be used on both iPhone and iPad. Other apps by Weather Underground include WunderStation for iPad and WunderMap for iOS and Android. In 2017, Weather Underground removed support for \"Storm,\" in favor of the \"Storm Radar\" app released by The Weather Channel Interactive in June 2017.\n\nOn December 31, 2018, Weather Underground ceased offering its popular application programming interface (API) for weather data, further reducing the breadth of its services.\n\nOn September 10, 2019, Weather Underground announced the discontinuation of its Email Forecast Program as of October 1, 2019, continuing the reduction in services noted above.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1982520", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1982520", "title": "Trump University", "text": "Trump University\n\nTrump University (also known as the Trump Wealth Institute and Trump Entrepreneur Initiative LLC) was an American company that ran a real estate training program from 2005 until 2010. It was owned and operated by The Trump Organization. A separate organization, Trump Institute, was licensed by Trump University but not owned by The Trump Organization. After multiple lawsuits, it is now defunct. It was founded by Donald Trump and his associates, Michael Sexton and Jonathan Spitalny, in 2004. The company offered courses in real estate, asset management, entrepreneurship, and wealth creation.\n\nThe organization was not an accredited university or college. It conducted three- and five-day seminars (often labeled \"retreats\") and used high-pressure tactics to sell these to its customers. It did not confer college credit, grant degrees, or grade its students. In 2011, the company became the subject of an inquiry by the New York Attorney General's office for illegal business practices which resulted in a lawsuit filed in August 2013. An article in the National Review described the organization as a \"massive scam\".\n\nTrump University was also the subject of two class actions in federal court. The lawsuits centered around allegations that Trump University defrauded its students by using misleading marketing practices and engaging in aggressive sales tactics. The company and the lawsuits against it received renewed interest due to Trump's candidacy in the 2016 presidential election. Despite repeatedly insisting he would not settle, Trump settled all three lawsuits in November 2016 for a total of $25 million after being elected president.\n\nMichael Sexton created a business plan for a real estate training program and presented it to Donald Trump looking to pay Trump a flat fee for the use of his name. Trump instead decided he wanted to be the principal owner.\n\nTrump University was incorporated in 2004 by Trump, Sexton, and Spitalny, as a New York limited liability company. Donald Trump owned 93% of the company. On May 23, 2005, Trump University formally launched its education program. At the opening presentation, Trump said: \"If I had a choice of making lots of money or imparting lots of knowledge, I think I'd be as happy to impart knowledge as to make money.\" The company's original business plan focused on online education, but quickly expanded to include live, in-person instruction as well. The focus of the instruction was real estate investing, with Trump claiming in advertisements: \"I can turn anyone into a successful real estate investor, including you.\" Typically the instruction began with an introductory seminar in rented space such as a hotel ballroom. At the introductory seminar, students were urged to sign up for additional classes, ranging from $1,495 seminars to a $35,000 \"Gold Elite\" program. Records produced indicate 7,611 tickets in total were sold to customers attending courses. Approximately 6,000 of these tickets were for a $1,500 3-day course and 1,000 tickets were for silver, gold or elite mentored courses ranging in price from $10,000 to $35,000.\n\nTrump claimed that students gave 98% favorable reviews to the program, but according to some former students, Trump University employees pressured students to offer favorable reviews, told them they had to fill out the forms in order to obtain graduation certificates, and did not undertake procedures often used to ensure that surveys were filled out objectively.\n\nIn an infomercial, Trump said he \"hand-picked\" Trump University's instructors. He testified in a 2012 deposition, however, that he never selected the instructors for the program. According to Michael Sexton, Trump signed off on the school's advertisements. For a time in 2008, it used the name Trump Wealth Institute. In June 2010, \"Trump University\" changed its name to \"The Trump Entrepreneur Initiative\". It largely ceased operations in 2010.\n\nThe Trump Institute was a separate business. It was licensed by Trump University, and Donald Trump received a cut of every seat sold, but Trump University did not own any part of it. It was owned and operated by Irene and Mike Milin of Boca Raton, Florida. It offered real estate seminars from 2006 to 2009, at which point the licensing agreement expired and was not renewed. Trump himself was not involved in the operation of the Trump Institute, but he recorded a broadcast infomercial promoting it and appeared in an introductory video before each seminar.\n\nThree lawsuits were filed asserting that Trump University engaged in a variety of illegal business practices, ranging from false claims to racketeering. Two were federal class actions: one against Trump University and its managers, including Donald Trump, and one against Donald Trump personally. A third case was filed in New York State court.\n\nIn 2005, the New York State Department of Education sent Trump, Sexton, and Trump University a letter saying that they were violating state law by using the word \"university\" when in fact Trump University was not actually chartered as one and did not have the required license to offer live instruction or training. Although Sexton promised the organization would stop instructing students in New York State, the New York Attorney General alleged that such instruction continued. \n\nA March 2010 letter sent to Trump by the Deputy Commissioner for Higher Education, Joseph Frey, stated: \"Use of the word 'university' by your corporation is misleading and violates New York Education Law and the Rules of the Board of Regents.\" In June 2010, \"Trump University\" changed its name to \"The Trump Entrepreneur Initiative\".\n\nOn August 24, 2013, the State of New York filed a $40 million civil suit against Trump University alleging illegal business practices and false claims made by the company. According to a press release from New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman titled \"A.G. Schneiderman Sues Donald Trump, Trump University & Michael Sexton For Defrauding Consumers Out Of $40 Million With Sham 'University',\" the case was to be handled by Assistant Attorneys General Tristan C. Snell and Melvin L. Goldberg, under the supervision of the Bureau of Consumer Frauds and Protection’s Deputy Bureau Chief Laura J. Levine, Bureau Chief Jane M. Azia, and Executive Deputy Attorney General for Economic Justice Karla G. Sanchez. Schneiderman described Trump University as a bait-and-switch scheme. He accused Trump of misleading more than 5,000 people to pay up to $35,000 to learn his real estate investment techniques.\n\nTrump denied the allegations, claiming the school had a 98% approval rating, and said Schneiderman was \"a political hack looking to get publicity\". Trump filed a complaint alleging that the state Attorney General's investigation was accompanied by a campaign donation shakedown; the complaint was investigated by a New York ethics board and dismissed in August 2015. Because of strict confidentiality laws, it is unknown whether the complaint was dismissed because Trump's claims were untrue, or because Schneiderman's alleged actions did not contravene any ethical rules.\n\nIn October 2014, a New York judge found Trump personally liable for operating the company without the required business license.\n\nTarla Makaeff, who paid nearly $60,000 to Trump University in 2008, brought a class action against Trump University on April 30, 2010, in the U.S. District Court for Southern California. The suit, \"Makaeff v. Trump University, LLC\", sought refunds for Makaeff and other former clients of Trump University, as well as punitive damages for breach of contract, fraud, negligent misrepresentation and bad faith. It did not originally name Donald Trump as a defendant, but did so in a later amended complaint. In February 2014, U.S. district court judge Gonzalo P. Curiel denied recognition to the nationwide class the plaintiffs had requested and recognized the suit as class-action on the part of Trump University clients in three states—California, Florida, and New York—based on specific alleged violations of the consumer protection laws of those states. He also narrowed the case to five of the plaintiffs' original fourteen charges.\n\nOn May 26, 2010, Trump University filed a counterclaim alleging Makaeff had made defamatory statements about Trump University, \"including many completely spurious accusations of actual crimes\", which caused Trump University losses of more than $1million. On June 30, 2010, Makaeff countered that Trump University's defamation claim was an attempt to intimidate her, known as a SLAPP suit (a strategic lawsuit against public participation), and that because Trump University is a \"public figure\" the defamation claim required proof that she \"acted with actual malice\" when speaking and writing about Trump University. By invoking California's anti-SLAPP statute, Makaeff triggered procedures that hastened consideration of the defamation claim without further discovery.\n\nOn August 23, 2010, U.S. district judge Irma E. Gonzalez ruled that Trump University was not a public figure, did not need to show malice on Makaeff's part, and could proceed with its defamation claim. Makaeff appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, where a three-judge panel ruled unanimously on April 17, 2013, that Trump University is a \"limited-purpose public figure\" and that Trump University must demonstrate malice on Makaeff's part to establish defamation; it returned the case to the district court to consider the defamation claim against that standard. After additional briefing, U.S. district judge Gonzalo P. Curiel ruled in Makaeff's favor on June 16, 2014, and dismissed the defamation claim. Makaeff then, at the court's invitation, presented evidence of her legal costs and fees in connection with the defamation litigation. She asked for $1.3 million, and on April 20, 2015, Curiel ordered Trump University to reimburse Makaeff $798,000 in legal fees and costs.\n\nIn November 2015, the district court ruled on Trump's motion for summary judgment. In a 44-page opinion, the court denied Trump's motion for summary judgment on most of the claims, finding that there was a genuine issue of fact on plaintiffs' claims of deceptive practices and misrepresentation in advertisements in violation of California, Florida, and New York consumer protection and business law and therefore letting these claims proceed to trial. The court did grant summary judgment in Trump's favor on plaintiffs' request for an injunction, because Trump University stopped enrolling students in July 2010 and no longer sold the same seminars or other programs.\n\nOn March 21, 2016, over objections from the attorneys for Trump University, Curiel allowed Makaeff to withdraw as the lead plaintiff, naming Sonny Low in her stead, resulting in the case title \"Low v. Trump University, LLC\".\n\nOn October 18, 2013, California businessman Art Cohen filed a civil suit, \"Art Cohen v. Donald J. Trump\", in the U.S. District Court for Southern California, as a class action on behalf of consumers throughout the United States who purchased services known as \"Live Events\" from Trump University after January 1, 2007. It alleged violations of the RICO statute, essentially a scheme to defraud. It accused Trump of misrepresenting Trump University \"to make tens of millions of dollars\" while actually delivering \"neither Donald Trump nor a university\". The suit named Donald Trump as the sole defendant and sought restitution as well as damages, including punitive and treble damages.\n\nIn an order dated October 24, 2014, U.S. district judge Gonzalo P. Curiel certified the class proposed by the plaintiff and ruled that Cohen had presented enough evidence to allow the case to proceed. Alan Garten, general counsel for the Trump Organization, said Trump University would appeal Curiel's ruling, which he said showed a \"manifest disregard for the law\". In October 2015, Garten also said Trump would ask Curiel to recuse himself because of his \"animosity toward Mr. Trump and his views\". However, Trump's lawyers never filed any motion to recuse, and according to legal experts such a motion would lack legal merit and possibly be considered frivolous.\n\nIn May 2016, Curiel set the trial on the suit to begin November 28, 2016, after the U.S. presidential election, with jury selection several weeks earlier.\n\nIn August 2016, the district court denied Trump's motion for summary judgment, ruling that there was sufficient evidence against Trump for the case to go to a jury.\n\nOn November 10, 2016, Curiel denied a request by Trump to delay the trial until after his inauguration. At the same time, Curiel urged the parties to work toward a settlement, and both sides accepted an offer from U.S. district judge Jeffrey T. Miller to facilitate such talks.\n\nOn May 27, 2016, Curiel granted a request by \"The Washington Post\" for public release of certain documents that had been filed in the case. He noted that they were \"routine\" and many were already publicly available. The released information included \"playbooks\" documenting instructions for employees to use a hard-sell approach, as well as depositions in which former employees said that Trump University had defrauded or lied to its students.\n\nOn August 2, 2016, the court denied a request by \"The Washington Post\" and other media organizations for the public release of hours of videotaped testimony from Trump's two depositions in \"Cohen\", taken in November 2015 and January 2016. Transcripts of those depositions had already been released, showing \"that Trump repeatedly indicated that he had never met instructors at Trump University, despite advertisements for the program indicating that its staff had been hand-picked by the real estate mogul.\" Trump's attorneys had opposed the requests to release the videotapes. Curiel ruled that there was a legitimate public interest in the content of the deposition, but that interest was satisfied via public release of the transcripts. The judge also noted that if the videos were publicly released, it was \"nigh-inevitable\" that the footage would be used in news accounts and political ads, which might prejudice the jury pool pre-trial.\n\nDuring primary campaign speeches, Trump repeatedly called the judge a \"hater\" and described him as \"Spanish\" or \"Mexican\" (Curiel was born in Indiana to parents who had immigrated to the U.S. from Mexico). Trump also said Curiel should recuse himself, although his attorneys said they did not plan to ask for the judge to be removed from the case. Curiel's only comment was to write in a procedural ruling that Trump has \"placed the integrity of these court proceedings at issue\". Trump's references to Curiel's ethnicity, as well as his comments that \"someone ought to look into\" the judge, alarmed legal experts, who expressed concern about the effects of the comments on judicial independence.\n\nOn June 7, 2016, Trump issued a lengthy statement saying his criticism of the judge had been \"misconstrued\" and that his concerns about Curiel's impartiality were not based upon ethnicity alone, but also upon rulings in the case.\n\nOn November 18, 2016, it was reported that Trump had agreed to pay $25 million to settle the two class actions and the New York suit. The settlement was reached ten days before the San Diego class action was scheduled to go to trial. $21 million will go to the participants in the class actions, $3 million will go to New Yorkers not covered by the class actions, and a penalty of up to $1 million will be assessed by the state of New York for running an unlicensed university. The plaintiff's attorneys agreed to forgo their fees and work \"pro bono\" as to maximize the amount that will go to the approximately 7,000 former Trump University students who are part of the case. The settlement also specifies that Trump, who had previously vowed he would never settle, does not admit to any wrongdoing. The settlement was brokered by U.S. district judge Jeffrey T. Miller, who offered his services to the parties on November 10 at Curiel's request. Curiel approved the settlement on March 31, 2017. \n\nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said the settlement and payment by Trump, \"is a stunning reversal by Donald Trump and a major victory for the over 6,000 victims of his fraudulent university.\" Trump himself said he settled \"for a small fraction of the potential award\" because he was too busy as president-elect to take it to trial. He added: \"The ONLY bad thing about winning the Presidency is that I did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U. Too bad!\"\n\nFinal payment of the settlement was put on hold, because one member of the class opted out of the settlement to pursue an individual claim. A district court and an appeals court rejected that individual's claim, and Curiel finalized the settlement in April 2018. Former students can now get a refund of up to 90% of the money they spent on courses.\n\nThe settlement was paid, not by Trump, but by his Las Vegas hotel business partner, billionaire Phil Ruffin. In February 2019, during a meeting of the US House Committee on Oversight and Reform, Congresswoman Jackie Speier suggested \"a Kansan\", later revealed to be Ruffin, had paid $25 million to satisfy Trump's liability in the Trump University judgement. Ruffin admitted to paying Trump $28 million in 2018, but claimed it was for \"back-fees\" related to Trump International Hotel Las Vegas and unrelated to the Trump University case.\n\nIn 2010, the office of Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott investigated Trump University. No suit was brought, but after exchanging communications with investigators that included requests from the investigators for customer lists and internal documents, Trump University closed its operations in the state. These had included newspaper advertising, free presentations, and three-day seminars. Six years later, during the 2016 presidential election, the Associated Press found that during Abbott's successful run for state governor in the 2014 Texas gubernatorial election, Trump had donated $35,000 to his campaign. \"Texas Monthly\" questioned whether Abbott had treated Trump with especial favor. Ken Paxton, who succeeded Abbott as Texas Attorney General, sent a cease and desist letter to the former Deputy Chief of Consumer Protection, John Owens, who said he had been told to drop the case and had forwarded previously undisclosed documents to the Associated Press. Paxton said in a statement that Owens had released \"confidential and privileged information\". David S. Morales, the Deputy Attorney General in 2010, admitted in 2016 that he had quashed the 5.4 million dollar suit without discussing the issue with Abbott. In 2018, Trump nominated Morales to serve as a judge at the District Court for the Southern District of Texas.\n\nThe office of Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi announced in September 2013 that it was considering joining a New York lawsuit against Trump University. Four days later, the Donald J. Trump Foundation donated $25,000 to \"And Justice for All\", a 527 group supporting Bondi's re-election campaign. Following this, Bondi declined to join New York. According to a Bondi spokesman, Bondi had personally solicited the donation from Trump several weeks before her office announced it was considering joining the lawsuit. In March 2016, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) filed a complaint with the IRS about the potentially illegal donation. In September 2016, it was reported that the donation violated laws against political contributions from nonprofit organizations, and that Donald Trump had reimbursed the foundation from his own money and paid the IRS a $2,500 excise tax as a penalty. Trump denied the donation was connected to the Trump University lawsuit, saying it was for Bondi's performance as Attorney General. The White House announced in November 2019 that Bondi would be joining its staff temporarily for handling communications about the ongoing impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump, prompting objection from ethics watchdogs.\n\nDuring the Republican presidential primaries of 2016, opponents of Trump's candidacy used Trump University to criticize him. Mitt Romney said in early March: \"Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud. His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University.\" Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio raised the subject during televised debates in February and March. One debate moderator, Megyn Kelly of Fox News, pursued the issue at length. Trump responded that Trump University was \"a small business\" and student evaluations were overwhelmingly positive. He said lawsuits were a routine part of business and that he wins most of them. Of one of the class actions he said: \"It's something I could have settled many times. I could settle it right now for very little money, but I don't want to do it out of principle.\" Hillary Clinton used the Trump University allegations against Trump in speeches and campaign ads.\n\nTrump University was the subject of a week-long series in the comic strip \"Doonesbury\" in June 2005.\n\nTrump University was also the butt of jokes in a \"Will and Grace\" mini-episode released in September 2016, created to get out the vote for the 2016 presidential election. In it, Karen says she sent her Latina maid, Rosario, to Trump University for a course on \"dusting\".\n\n\n"}

Palm Valley and the surrounding area is the only place in Central Australia where Red Cabbage Palms (\"Livistona mariae\") survive. The nearest specimens are 850 kilometres away in Queensland. The surrounding region is largely dry Central Ranges xeric scrub.\n\nThe average rainfall for Palm Valley is only 200 mm per year. Although the gorge usually appears dry, there are some small pockets of semi-permanent spring-fed pools that allow the unique flora in this region to survive. During significant rainfall in the region, expanses of water can be witnessed flowing through the valley gorge. During such events, a variety of aquatic life such as desert fish, shield shrimps (\"Triops australiensis\"), tadpoles and frogs can flourish.\n\nIt had been assumed that the cabbage palms were remnants of a prehistoric time when the climate supported tropical rainforest in what is now the arid inland of Australia. Genetic analysis published in 2012 determined that \"Livistona mariae\" at Palm Valley is actually the same species as \"Livistona rigida\" from samples collected near Katherine and Mount Isa, both around away. The research by Professor David Bowman and colleagues at the University of Tasmania concluded that the populations separated only about 15,000 years ago. Aboriginal legend recorded in 1894 by Carl Strehlow describes \"gods from the north\" bringing the seeds to Palm Valley.\n\nIn early 1928, Herbert Joseph Larkin led an exploratory aerial expedition exploring the possibility of developing the Palm Valley into a resort. However, the exploration led to naught.\n\nThe track to Palm Valley is still only accessible with a four-wheel drive vehicle. It departs from the town of Hermannsburg and travels south, following the usually dry bed of the Finke River. Palm Creek flows into the Finke River from the west about 15 km (by track) south of Hermannsburg. The track follows the creek to Palm Valley about 5 km west of the Finke River.\n\nThe Palm Valley gas field is an onshore source of natural gas north of the valley itself. The gas field is part of the Amadeus Basin and supplies gas to Alice Springs and beyond via the Amadeus Gas Pipeline.\n\n"}
