{"id": "2155110", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2155110", "title": "Miai", "text": "Miai\n\nThe practice of miai emerged in 16th century Japan among the samurai class to form and protect strong military alliances among warlords to ensure mutual support. Later, during the Tokugawa period (1603–1868) the practice of miai spread to other urban classes trying to emulate samurai customs. It became the practice for those seeking a union between families and parents on both sides made all the decision regarding marriage.\n\nMiai was a solemn practice and involved considerations that are not given as much weight by most modern Japanese people, such as family bloodlines and class. This type of miai is usually seen portrayed in films and television dramas.\n\nAfter the Pacific War, the trend was to abandon the restrictive arranged-meetings system. Modern forms of miai are still practiced in Japan today, although they are no longer as prevalent as they were in the pre-Meiji era. There are accounts that reveal how parents pressure their unmarried children into arranged meetings that eventually lead to marriages particularly those who would assume family responsibilities such as those inheriting family business.\n\nThe participants in a miai process include the candidates who are to potentially be married and the families of these candidates. However, miai can take place without any involvement of the prospective couple's families.\n\nA serves the role of a go-between for families in the miai process. A nakōdo is not necessary for all miai. The nakōdo can be a family member, friend, or matchmaking company.\n\nProfessional organizations have begun to provide go-between services for inquiring candidates. These professional nakōdo are known as puro (pro) nakōdo.\n\nThe general purpose of the nakōdo, especially the traditional way of miai, is to provide introductions for people entering a new arrangement and to assist shy candidates. The nakōdo is expected to play a variety of roles throughout the miai process. The first is the bridging role, , in which the nakōdo introduces potential candidates and families to each other. The second role is as a liaison for the families to avoid direct confrontation and differences in opinions between them by serving as an intermediary for working out the details of the marriage. The nakōdo is even consulted by the married couple even after their wedding if they encounter problems in their married life.\n\nEven though miai marriages are not as common as they once were, they still hold a place in popular media. One example is \"Wedding Bells\", a game show that substitutes for the role of the nakōdo in which contestants are introduced and screened for marriage possibility.\n\nThe initiative for the miai introductions often comes from the parents who may feel that their son or daughter is of a marriageable age (tekireiki), usually in the range of 22 to 30, but has shown little or no sign of seeking a partner on their own. Other times, the individual may ask friends or acquaintances to introduce potential mates in a similar way.\n\nParents often subtly interject the phrase “onegai shimasu” (“I make the request”) into casual conversation, which implies that both parents have consented for their daughter to meet eligible men. The daughter may be unaware that her parents have suggested her availability though the use of \"onegai shimasu.\" Moreover, some parents send a candidacy picture to a future husband or go-between without their daughter's knowledge or consent.\n\nParents may enlist the aid of a nakōdo or ask a third party with a wide range of social contacts to act as a go-between. The word \"miai\" describes both the entire process as well as the first meeting between the couple and the nakōdo. Miai signifies that the parties were brought together expressly for the purpose of marriage on the initiative of the parents, a friend of the family or a go-between. It also means that the initial criteria of selection were objective ones. The potential mate and their family meet with the nakōdo and examine all eligible persons. The nakōdo often has photographs of candidates and a “rirekisho”, a small personal history. The rirekisho frequently includes the name, age, health, education, occupation and marital status of all members of the candidate's family.\n\nThe families then sit down with the nakōdo and screen the portfolios to eliminate any obviously inappropriate candidates. The photographs and rirekisho may be brought to the home of the potential mate's family for the son or daughter to scrutinize. The participant and their family examine the photos and short personal histories based on an investigation of social consideration. The education level and occupations of the potential candidate's family are the first aspects taken into consideration at this meeting. The potential mate and their mother create a list of primary choices and ask the nakōdo to investigate the first choice.\n\nIn more selective miai, the candidates and their families are judged on a large set of criteria aimed at determining the suitability and the balance of the marriage. This criteria is formally known in Japan as . It includes level of education, income, occupation, physical attractiveness, religion, social standing, and hobbies. Many modern women are stereotyped as looking for three attributes: height, high salary, and high education. This is commonly known as the \"Three Hs.” The participant's plays a large role. Many fear that a candidate's blood is contaminated with diseases such as epilepsy, neurosis, or mental illness. The fear is so prevalent that the Eugenic Protection Law of 1948 was passed to legalize sterilization and abortion for people with a history of mental defects and other hereditary diseases. Social status also plays a large role in selecting a candidate. Ideally, paired candidates and their families should be of equal social status. A candidate has a hard time finding a mate if his family is not of a matching social status as the other family — even if the candidate is of equal social status. Family lineage can also affect the quality of a candidate. For example, a candidate with samurai blood is more likely to be picked than one with ancestry from a different Tokugawa-era class.\n\nThe nakōdo provides a substantial amount of information regarding each candidate. The family researches the iegara of each candidate provided by the nakōdo once the preliminary list is constructed. Vast differences in iegara between the two families would cause embarrassment to the sides whenever they meet. One method of investigation in urban Japan is through a kooshinjo, or detective agency. In rural areas a common investigative method is to personally ask about the family of interest by questioning shopkeepers and neighbors: kuchikiki (“inquiry of mouth”). More recently, the nakōdo gathers information about the family in question by asking around and comparing responses: kikiawaseru/toriawaseru (“inquire variously and compare”). If all criteria are acceptable, the matchmaker arranges an interview for a miai.\n\nBefore the miai occurs, the parties scrutinize each other's pictures to prevent future rejection. Although candidates rely on their photographs and resumes (rirekisho) in the modern miai process, an older custom known as \"kagemi” (hidden look) was once employed. Kagemi occurred when a potential male candidate attempted to catch a glimpse of the female in secret. The objective of the kagemi was to prevent embarrassing denials based on appearances. The miai itself is a casual meeting between the potential couple, the nakōdo, and the parents of both parties. The nakōdo determines the place and format of the meeting.\n\nThe miai is just as much an opportunity for parents to survey the bride/groom as the couple themselves. The meeting begins with an informal introduction between the two families by the nakōdo. The introduction is often followed by small talk between the parents. Occasionally, the conversation shifts to one of the potential candidates. Toward the end of the meeting, the potential couple are advised to go off spend some time alone to get better acquainted.\n\nIf the initial miai introduction is successful, the potential couple goes through a series of dates until a decision is reached. The decision is usually expressed at the couple's third meeting. If the potential couple chooses to marry one another, they go through a formal marriage process known as , in which a is arranged by the groom's family. Contrastingly, there are standard provisions to turn down an offer or proposal with relatively little loss of face on the part of the party refused.\n\nThere is some amount of racial, class, and genetic discrimination in the miai process.\n\nMany Japan-born Koreans are discriminated against for being “half-bloods” — not of full Japanese ancestry. \nAlso, the year of the Horse in the fifth cycle of the Japanese lunar calendar, \"hinoeuma\" — every sixtieth year — are thought to be bad luck. Women born during this year will often claim to have been born in the previous or following year. The belief is so widespread that in 1966, according to the \"Japan Statistical Yearbook\", the birthrate in Japan took a 26% dip.\n\nThe most widespread class discriminate is against members of the burakumin. This former outcaste group is composed of descendants of workers traditionally associated with trades involving blood, death, or other undesirables. Some examples are leather-workers, shoe-menders, and butchers since shoes are too dirty to be taken into the house and meat was in the past forbidden by the Buddhist faith. During the Tokugawa Shogunate, demotion to burakumin status was sometimes a way of punishing criminals. Today, burakumin members may be identified by the region of the city where they live or by their street address. Often, a nakōdo will require a candidate to bring a family history to prove that they are not a member of the burakumin.\n\nMembers of the Ainu, an indigenous people from the Hokkaidō region are commonly avoided as well. Descendants of people who were exposed to the radiation from the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki are avoided due to stories of possible child deformities and susceptibilities to rare diseases.\n\nModern attitudes toward miai have changed significantly. According to an estimate in 1998, ten to thirty percent of all marriages that took place in Japan during that time were arranged marriages. The National Institute of Population and Social Security Research in 2005 estimates that 6.2% of marriages in Japan are arranged. The younger generation is more apt to adopting the Western philosophy of love where marriage is often preceded by romantic courtship. Romantic love (ren’ai) implies that there are no constraints against selecting individuals whom one can marry. However, it is not always possible to classify a particular marriage as “love” or “arranged” because of parental influence on the candidates. Women are more inclined to seek a romantic relationship than men. Gender enculturation is often seen as the cause for the discrepancy. Women are raised with the expectation that they may only find satisfaction within the home and are therefore perhaps more susceptible to modern brands of idealism, such as that true love will be followed by marital and domestic bliss.\n\nThere are several methods for meeting potential mates that differ from the structure of the miai. For example, konpa or compa (companion) is a method young people have adopted into modern society. Konpa occurs when groups of four or five boys go out together with the same number of girls to see how they all get along. This method has become more popular since it is highly informal and does not involve parents.\n\nAlthough current rates of miai marriages are fairly low, the persistence of miai in modern Japanese society can be explained by examining gender relationships. As discussed earlier, people who are past marriageable age, tekireiki, are more likely to use the miai process. The idea of the cutoff age is taken quite seriously. There is a tendency for women who remain unmarried past tekireiki to be treated as inferior and compared to Japanese Christmas cake: fresh up until the twenty-fifth but becoming less appetizing with every day past this date. A newer expression replaces Christmas cake with toshikoshisoba, a dish of noodles to see out the year on the thirty-first.\n\nMales seem to possess only a bit more latitude. A man who does not marry by about 30 is considered untrustworthy by colleagues and employers, who believe that such men have not been conditioned to learn the fundamental principles of co-operation and responsibility. For males, marriage also makes an implicit statement about staying in the family business. Males who engage in miai often occupy dominant roles within the marriage. Miai marriage has been criticized for promoting patriarchal relationships with traditional power structures and distinct divisions of labor between males and females.\n\nThe same practice is also common in Chinese-speaking countries, known as \"xiangqin\" (). In China, 82% of first-tier-city dwellers had experienced Xiangqin, primarily due to parental pressure and a lack of opportunity to meet people of opposite-sex.\n\nMiai is one of the main topics of Jun'ichirō Tanizaki's \"The Makioka Sisters\", which was published in the 1940s.\n\n"}

An international co-production between the United States and the United Kingdom, the film stars Caroline Munro, Simon Scudamore, Carmine Iannaconne, Donna Yeager, and Sally Cross. The film's plot follows a group of adults, responsible for a prank gone wrong on April Fool's Day, who are invited to a reunion at their defunct high school, where a masked killer awaits inside.\n\nHigh school outcast Marty Rantzen is seduced by popular girl Carol in the women's locker room. This is revealed as a prank as several students appear and mock Marty's naked body. Led by troublemaker Skip, the students physically abuse Marty before the coach intervenes. Later, two of the students feign remorse and offer Marty marijuana laced with something to make him sick. Skip messes with Marty's science project, accidentally setting off a chain of events that ends with Marty being doused with nitric acid, disfiguring him.\n\nTen years later Carol meets Skip and the others at their high school reunion. They find they were the only ones invited, with the school long vacant and in disrepair. They decide to break in and party, and unbeknownst to them the school's caretaker is killed by a man wearing a jester mask. Soon the friends begin dying in variety of ways – Ted's stomach explodes upon drinking an acid-laced beer, Shirley is melted with acid while taking a bath, Carl is impaled while trying to escape in a car, Susan is killed off-screen, Joe is eviscerated by tractor blades, Stella and Frank are electrocuted while having sex, and Nancy is drowned in a cesspit. Skip is hanged by a noose but escapes.\n\nThe jester chases Carol throughout the school, and in her panic she accidentally kills Skip with an axe to the face. Finally the jester kills Carol with a javelin in the locker room where the initial prank took place. Removing his mask, the jester is revealed as Marty, who revels in his revenge before he hallucinates and gets attacked by the spirits of the people he just slaughtered and passes out.\n\nAfter the massacre, Marty wakes up in the hospital. A doctor remarks that Marty's skin grafting has been a success. However, Marty kills the doctor and a nurse before ripping the new skin from his face.\n\n\nIt was originally filmed as \"April Fool's Day\" in late 1984 in London, England, and Virginia Water, Surrey on a budget of $2.1 million. However, the title was changed to \"Slaughter High\" after the filmmakers had learned of Paramount Pictures's slasher film of the same title scheduled for release of the same year.\n\nThe film was given a limited release theatrically in the United States by Vestron Pictures on November 14, 1986. The release expanded in February 1987, and again in April 1987; it opened on a total of thirty-eight screens on April 24, 1987, earning $90,000 between April 24–27.\n\nKevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" reviewed the film favorably, noting: \"In its primitive way, \"Slaughter High\", is one of the better teen revenge horror pictures,\" adding that the film \"benefits greatly from its authentic setting, a big, old derelict Tudor-style school building in a remote area, gets actually quite scary, yet the special effects are of the darkly comic, Grand Guignol variety.\" Terry Lawson of the \"Dayton Daily News\" was critical of the performances, particularly the English actors' attempts at portraying an American accent, adding that the film \"invites comment as much for its oddness as for its awfulness.\"\n\nThe film currently holds a 0% approval rating on aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes. AllMovie wrote, \"\"Slaughter High\" gets a passing grade for the die-hard genre fans, but is worthless for most any other audience.\"\n\n\"Slaughter High\" was released as \"April Fool's Day\" on VHS in Japan by Vestron International and on DVD in the United Kingdom by Arrow Video. To date, these are the only countries to have a home-video release of the film under its original title.\n\nThe film was released by Lionsgate on April 15, 2009 on DVD as part of their 'Lost Collection', which contains unrated Vestron full-screen VHS master print. It was re-released on January 4, 2011 in a '4-Film Collection' set along with \"My Best Friend Is a Vampire\", \"Repossessed\" and \"\".

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nPrior to 1870, Mina was formerly named Barrio Mantugaui under the jurisdiction of Pototan. On June 20, 1864, a league of influential citizens and inhabitants of this Barrio, officially pleaded to His Excellency the Quartermaster General of the Visayas to elevate this barrio into a new town independent of its matrix of Pototan to be named “Pueblo de Molto”. The reasons why there was a petition to elevate said barrio into a pueblo, were due to: (1) great distance between the town and the barrio; (2) during those times, the residents of the said barrio had difficulty travelling to Pototan when they want to hear mass on required days; (3) when some barrio folks fell ill due to some pestilence and eventually died without receiving the Sacrament of Extreme Unction for the good of their souls. For a predominantly-Catholic inhabitants of this barrio, receiving and getting blessed with the sacraments as taught by the church, were important. (4) Another case in point was those women who suffered complications and died during childbirth had no chance of receiving the final sacrament, and (5) their infants often died without being baptized. It was for these reasons, that the leaders sought the approval of His Excellency praying that their request would be granted. July 30, 1864 - The Parish Priest and the Principales of Pototan endorsed to the Political-Military Government of Iloilo the required sketch and lists of more than a thousand tax payers and sixteen Cabezas de Barangay, informing the need of elevating Barrio Mantugaui into a town. Likewise to also elevate this petition to the superior knowledge of His Excellency the Governor General of the Philippines for his royal resolution/decision.\n\nThere were so many disputes that had happened in the creation of this town. Arguments as to the other barrios to be included as part of Molto, as well as the boundaries and the “tributos” taxpayers, have become the major contention. Barrio Paranginan el Maya was merged to Talarocan now Tolarucan, to become part of Molto. A dispute between the Municipalities of Pototan and Janiuay over the jurisdiction of Talarocan resulted to the delay of elevating this barrio into a town. On January 20, 1868, a decree ordered by then the Gobernador Politico Militar de Visayas, contained an assignment which was delegated to the Captain of the Police Force in this District, Don Evaristo Fernandez, who conducted the survey of the boundaries concerned. Upon completion of the survey, the recommendation regarding the boundary between Mantugaui and Janiuay was objected by Fr. Miguel Claro of Janiuay Parish, hence the delay occurred for its approval. On March 30, 1869, the Bishop of Jaro appointed Don Juan Manzano y Vazques, the lawyer of this Province and was designated to form a committee to establish the official boundaries for the creation of a new town to be named “Pueblo de Molto”. Together with him in the said committee were the Reverend Parish Priests of Pototan and Janiuay and with the chiefs of the Barrio Mantugaui, they also handled the case filed regarding the objection of the Parish Priest of Janiuay. Another important task of this committee was to establish the site where the new town of Molto and the barrios which should be part of it should be situated and indicated as well as the land for the public buildings.\nOn April 5, 1870, the final report of the boundaries for “Pueblo de Molto” was submitted to the Political Military Governor of the District by the said committee. On July 1, 1870, a Superior Decree issued by the Superior Government of General Carlos Ma. De la Torre to establish the demarcation and markings of the new town and named it into “Pueblo de Mina” instead of “Pueblo de Molto”. No parish priest yet was assigned at that time because some of the requirements imposed for the creation of a new parish like the construction of the Church, Parish House for the priest, Convent School, Court, Municipio, were not fully complied yet. On July 30, 1873, when all these terms and conditions were accomplished, a decree was issued making the new town of Mina as a full- fledged parish as approved by the Government of the Republic. The parish, which was created through the Bishop of Jaro appointed an Augustinian Priest, Father Tiburcio Casbresana, a Spaniard, to become the first parish priest in the new town of Mina. The Parish of Mina was given an official title of “Nuestra Sra. Del Pilar” or “Our Lady of the Pillar”.\n\nAfter the defeat in the Philippines by Spain against the Americans, the Americans changed the structure of government in this country. On 4 April 1903, the 50 towns in the Province of Iloilo were reduced to 17 with the passage of Act No. 719, the title of which read “AN ACT REDUCING THE FIFTY-ONE MUNICIPALITIES OF THE PROVINCE OF ILOILO TO SEVENTEEN.” The town of Dingle and Mina, together with other neighboring barrios, were placed under the jurisdiction of the Town of Pototan. Mina became an “arrabal” of Pototan, then considered as the biggest “arrabal” because it has a parish of its own. But the townsfolk of Mina continued to celebrate the feast day of Our Lady of the Pillar.\nDuring the World War II, the presence of the Japanese occupation was also felt within Mina, hence, for three years, the Chapel in Barangay Abat, Mina, became the location of the parish of Mina, where the feast day of Our Lady of the Pillar on October 12, was celebrated with a mass each year. Immediately after the liberation, the Parish went back to its original location in the town plaza.\n\nIn 1947, the Parish Priest, having observed that the economic life of the people in the parish was pitifully difficult, transferred the celebration of the religious fiesta on December 30 from October 12. The purpose of the change was to afford the parishioners the chance to have a decent and festive celebration. For two years, the religious activities and festivities were celebrated on December 30 after which the feast day was moved back to its original date, simultaneously with the celebration of Spain where the feast of the Lady of the Pillar was originated. Thus, since then, the town of Mina celebrates the religious festival every 12 October annually.\n\nA group of local leaders residing in Mina made a petition to separate Mina, as an independent town from Pototan. On October 1, 1964, then President Diosdado Macapagal signed Executive Order No. 106 creating the Municipality of Mina. Mina’s status as a municipality became controversial. A complaint filed by then Senator Emmanuel Pelaez reached the Supreme Court. It had to do with the official acts of President Diosdado Macapagal issuing Executive Order for the creation of the Municipality of Mina, which Senator Pelaez found to be unconstitutional. The creation of a Municipality should be through a Bill passed in Congress. The legality of President Macapagal’s issuance of Executive Order No. 106 was questioned. In the end, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the complainant, Senator Pelaez, and ordered Mina to revert to its status as a suburb of Pototan. Its existence as an again independent Municipality was short-lived, only 14 months, from 1 January 1965 to 18 February 1966. It was then Congressman Ricardo Y. Ladrido of the Fourth District of the Province of Iloilo, who authored and sponsored House Bill No. 16661 creating the Municipality of Mina in 1968. On 9 September 1968, R.A. No. 5442 was passed, declaring Mina as a municipality of the Province of Iloilo.\n\nOn November 11, 1969, a special election for the newly created or declared an independent town was held simultaneously with the general (presidential) election. This is the first local government election for the town of Mina. ATTY. ARTHUR D. DEFENSOR SR., at the age of 25, was the first elected Municipal Mayor.\n\nMina is located in the central part of the province. It is from Iloilo City.\nMina has a total land area of 4,340 hectares and composed of 22 barangays.

In 1886 the boundary line separating the jurisdiction of Santa Barbara and Cabatuan was defined and Jimanban was made part of Santa Barbara. Intermerriage among the people increased the area's population\n\nLed by Bartolome Valenzuela, a prominent resident of the barrio (Jimanban) the resident organized themselves and petioned the governor general that they be granted independence by putting up a church, convent and a casa real (municipal building). With the help of the provincial officials and captain municipal of the municipalities of Santa Barbara, Cabatuan and Pototan, Lucena was separated from Santa Barbara on October 9, 1877 in accordance with the Dirrecion General De Administration Civil. The first Municipal Officials were elected and the first captain municipal was Bartolome Valenzuela known as Tan Abe, the grandfather of then Senator Tomas Confessor and Representative Patricio Confessor.\n\nIt is not recorded when Jimanban was changed to New Lucena but Lucena reportedly comes from dialect Lu (Ulo) which means \"head\"and \"cena\" which is the short version for the flower azucena, which means pure and peaceful.

In 1921, the prominent cicitizens of Lucena petioned for its separation from Santa Barbara.

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nPavia is the smallest municipality in terms of area in Iloilo, covering only . The municipality is the Regional Agro-Industrial Center for Western Visayas and is located north of Iloilo City.\n\nThe Catholic church, is currently undergoing restoration, is similar to one in Pavia, Italy.\n\nHow the town got its name is unclear, and has long been disputed. One theory has it that the name came from a certain Colonel Pavia of the Spanish garrison in Iloilo who was supposedly responsible for initially establishing a Spanish presence in the area . Others believe that the name is a Spanish corruption of the Hiligaynon word \"biya-biya\", as the area was originally considered a neglected patch of land that served mostly as a camping ground for city sophisticates and absentee landlords. Others claim that the town was named after a Spanish governor-general, Manuel Pavia y Lay, Marquis of Novaliches, who eventually became a priest after his short tenure in the Philippines from 1853-1854. However, the more credible theory seems to be the overlooked fact that the town's religious well-being was placed under the jurisdiction and supervision of the friars of the Augustinian Order, and they simply named the place in honor of the town of Pavia, Italy, where the founder of their order, Saint Augustine, was buried.\n\nThe last theory seems to be supported by circumstantial historical evidence: it was also in 1862 that an independent parish dedicated to Saint Monica was established by an Augustinian friar, Policarpio Minayo. But it was only in 1889 when construction of the famous brick church—as it now stands—began. It was envisioned and built in the Byzantine style, with Romanesque design elements. Two Greek crosses dominate the facade, and the transept is round set against the rear wall. It is unique in the whole of Panay Island, as it is the only church built entirely of red brick, inside and out. Quite significantly, the church design was apparently inspired by the ancient royal arched basilica of San Michele Maggiore in Pavia, Italy—minus the front columns.\n\nPavia was settled by primitive Malays and later by Chinese approximately between the 15th and 16th centuries, corroborated by archaeological work at a Chinese burial ground in Cabugao Sur. The settlement had an estimated population of 200 to 400.\n\nSeparating from town of Jaro , Iloilo , Pavia was officially established in 1848, during the Spanish Colonial Era, by thirteen landowners in what used to be a “camping place”, a “settlement place” or an “abandoned place”.\n\nPavia became a part of Santa Barbara in 1901 and then in 1904 part of Iloilo City. In 1907, Pavia, together with Leganes, Iloilo and Jaro seceded from Iloilo City to become the suburb Jaro. Petronilo Gumban governed Pavia from 1916 until his election as Presidente Municipal of Jaro in 1920. In 1921, Pavia led by Delfin Gumban became an independent municipality.\n\nPavia is politically subdivided into 18 barangays.\n\nIn the , the population of Pavia, Iloilo, was people, with a density of .\n\nPavia is one of the fastest growing economy in Iloilo. It is agricultural-industrial center in times of Cory Aquino Presidency where Vitarich corporation and New Panay Agri-ventures are located in Cabugao Sur , Pavia .

Robinsons Builders , Coca Cola Bottling Company and Taytay sa Kauswagan employed thousands of employees. \n\nPavia is famous for \"baye baye,\" a by-product of rice made from the newly harvested palay. Baye-baye is a sweet Ilonggo delicacy made from scraped young coconut meat, sugar and pinipig. Its century-old pottery industry especially in Barangay Pandac(Pik- Pik Koron) and Jibao-an still survives amid flower and bonsai gardens. Pottery makers made pots (coron), firewood-fired stoves (sig-ang), drinking jars (banga) and water containers (tadyaw) using the open pit firing method.\n\nLawrence Anthony G.

The Carabao is made the \"king\" for a day, and the race features carabaos each pulling a bamboo sled or \"carrosa\" on a 400-meter course. Carrozas with native designs are also paraded as part of festivities.\n\nThe Tigkaralag festival is the “only festival of its kind” in the region celebrated in consonance with All Souls’ Day. The term “TIGKARALAG” comes from Ilonggo words, “tig” which means “season of” and “kalag” which means”soul”. Participants from the 18 barangays wear tigkaralag costumes and parade themselves from Barangay Aganan to the town’s plaza for a dance-drama competition with a storyline reflective of Tigkaralag. Held every 30th day of October, the festival was conceived by Cecilia H. Capadosa in 1992. Recently, Baye-baye night was included as a side event of the festival in celebration on one of the town's industry, the Baye-baye.\n\nPavia Parish Church, popularly known as Santa Monica Parish Church is a century-old church built by the Spanish Augustinian Fathers sometime in 1862. Its interior and exterior walls are made entirely of red-bricks, making it the only existing brick-constructed church in the island of Panay. This church is similar to the church of the town’s namesake, Pavia in Italy.\n\n"}

Following their customs and united by the bonds of kinship they built a community. Out of the flourishing settlement later rosegreat men like Manuel Paez, Modesto Palabrica and Apolinario Palabrica, who had earlier become Capitanes of the mother town of Passi. The names of Sanriago Pama, Augusto Palencia, Gregorio Aguilar, Bartolo Garrido, Cipriano Gonzales, Vicente Quianzon, and others surnamed Palabrica and Paez, had been elected to the position of Capitanes of Tenientes.\n\nDuring an exploration talk held at the house of his aunt, Maura Ponte in Barangay Camiri, Jesus Prudente and his closest friends stressed the need to launch a movement aimed at separating San Enrique from Passi. This was followed by a core group meeting at the old municipal building. In the presence of Ernesto Palabrica, Jose Lacsao, Crispin Lademora and Rodrigo Ponte, he laid down the mechanics for the reconstitution of the town into a separate political entity.\n\nAt the Assembly meeting called on November 25, 1956, a big crowd clustered in the market place at the corner of Palabrica and Manolo street.

Garcia, President of the Philippines.\n\nSan Enrique was separated from Passi through the efforts of the man who had no filial ties with anyone in the Municipality except by his official connection with them as representative. Congressman Aldeguer was the \"Simon Bolivar\", in the emancipation of San Enrique.\n\nDuring the first years of its existence as a municipality, San Enrique was confronted by heartbreaking problems. Those times were bitter, painful and discouraging. The Municipality was beset by financial crises, but the San Enriquenhons were able to move successfully against the stream of insurmountable odds.\n\nThe establishments of Passi Sugar Central in San Enrique, has considerably improved the economy of the Municipality. It has drawn workers, thereby enhancing its financial status.\n\nHowever, in 1967, the San Enrique Community High School operated by the virtue of the law authored by Congressman Aldeguer in 1965. Since San Enrique is basically an agricultural town, the San Enrique National Agricultural and Vocational High School operated in 1972.

Its total population at the time was 15,094.\n\nIn 1845, its population was 19,719 and it covered an area which are now the Municipalities of Maasin, Janiuay, Cabatuan, Alimodian, San Miguel, Zarraga, New Lucena and parts of Leganes and Pavia.\n\nWhen the Philippine Revolution broke out on Luzon in 1896, it did not spread immediately to Iloilo. The Spanish authorities thought that they could keep the Ilonggos loyal to Spain. Governador–General Basilio Agustin organized the Volunteer Militia in Iloilo to enlist Ilonggos to fight the Tagalog rebels. Being a “mestizo” and having occupied the highest office in his town, Martin Teofilo Delgado was appointed commander of the “voluntaries” in Santa Barbara.\n\nUnknown to the Spaniards, however, Delgado had already become a “revolucionario”. On October 28, 1898 he publicly declared himself for the Revolution and seized the municipal building. The Revolutionary Government of the Visayas was organized and on November 17, 1898, was formally inaugurated at the town plaza of Santa Barbara. A large crowd hailing from many places across Iloilo gathered for the historic occasion. The Philippine flag was raised for the first time outside of Luzon.\n\nThe officials of the Revolutionary Government were Roque Lopez, president; Vicente Franco, vice president and secretary of the interior; Venancio Concepcion, secretary of finance; Ramon Avanceňa, secretary of state; Jovito Yusay, secretary of justice; Julio Hernandez, secretary of war; Fernando Salas, secretary general. General Martin T. Delgado was chosen General –in-Chief of the Revolutionary Forces.\n\nSanta Barbara became the headquarters of the Revolutionary Forces and from here, Gen. Delgado launched the campaign to liberate the whole province which culminated in the surrender of Iloilo City by Governor-General de los Rios on December 24, 1898.\n\nThe victory against Spain was short-lived as the Philippine–American War followed. Gen. Delgado led the same army against Americans from 1899 to 1901. Delgado was forced to surrender on February 2, 1901.\n\nUpon the establishment of the civil government, Martin Delgado was appointed as the first provincial Governor of Iloilo and was elected to the same position in the first elections held in 1903. Santa Barbara became a town under American regime and was incorporated into a municipality by the Commonwealth Government. The town soon began to progress.\n\nIn 1948, Barangay Tuburan-Solbud was transferred to Zarraga, Iloilo.\n\nMigration occurred in the 20th century to Mindanao in the 1940s under Manuel Roxas who was from Panay. Thousands migrated throughout the 1940s and 1950s as part of a resettlement movement sponsored by the government. Today, many Santa Barbaranon are now living in Mindanao, with a huge presence in:\n\nIn the , the population of Santa Barbara, Iloilo, was people, with a density of .\n\nMajority of the people or about 73.25% of the population are Kinaray-a speaking, a dialect that originated in the province of Antique. The remaining population speaks in Hiligaynon, Filipino, and English.\n\nThe total road network is ; of which are barangay roads, provincial roads, municipal streets and national highways.\n\nIn July 2007, the new Iloilo International Airport, located in Cabatuan and Santa Barbara, Iloilo was opened to the public. As a result, access to air transportation has significantly improved. Before, the plying of taxis in the Municipality is an uncommon sight to most Santa Barbaranhon's but with the construction and operation of the New Iloilo Airport the town started progressing economically more and more every year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Santa Barbara plaza is one of the finest, and most beautiful plazas in the Philippines. It is also where the Seat of the Republic of the Visayas was declared in November 17, 1898, headed by president Roque Lopez. The plaza was also the site where the first Philippine flag was raised outside Luzon in December 25, 1898 followed by the plaza libertad in Metro Iloilo also in the same date. The plaza was also declared as a Historical Landmark in 2015.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In Presbyterianism, ordination is understood to be an ordinance rather than a sacrament; ministers and elders are ordained; until recently deacons were \"commissioned\" but now they too are ordained to their office in the Church of Scotland.\n\nWomen were commissioned as deacons (or \"deaconesses\") from 1888, and allowed to preach from 1949. Serious debate on the ordination of women as ministers began when Mary Levison petitioned the General Assembly for ordination in 1963. She was eventually ordained as a Minister of Word and Sacrament in 1978, and in 1991 became the first woman to be appointed as Queen's Chaplain.\n\nIn a Presbyterian Church, elders (who together with the minister form the kirk session and fulfill some of the functions of a parish council in other denominations) are ordained for life - \"ad vitam aut culpam\" - though in some cases without the laying-on of hands. The minister (\"minister of Word and Sacrament\", to use the full title) is a \"teaching elder\", the other kirk session members are \"ruling elders\", and the difference is understood to lie in the authority of the appointment rather than the spiritual nature of the ordinance. Consequently, the theological arguments for and against the ordination of women as elders were identical to those concerning women ministers, and the two debates ran in parallel and were settled more or less simultaneously. The General Assembly changed its legislation to allow the ordination of women as elders in 1966 and as ministers in 1968.\n\nLady Grisell Baillie (1822-1891) became the first deaconess in the Church of Scotland on 9 December 1888 in a service conducted by Dr James Mackenzie Allardyce at Bowden Kirk in Bowden, Scottish Borders.\n\nThe first woman to be ordained as a minister in the Church of Scotland was the Revd Catherine McConnachie by the Presbytery of Aberdeen in 1969. She served as assistant minister at St George's Tillydrone, in Aberdeen. In 1972 the Revd Euphemia H C. Irvine was the first to be ordained and inducted as a parish minister – at Milton of Campsie Parish Church, near Glasgow. She retired in 1988. In 2014, 204 women were serving ministers in the Church of Scotland within Scotland, representing 25.1% of the active Ministers of Word and Sacrament in the country. There were also 61 women serving as Ministries Development Staff.\n\nWomen have also played an increasingly prominent role in the Church's administration. In 1996, the Revd Dr Marjory MacLean – then minister at Stromness, Orkney – was appointed as the first women to be Depute Clerk to the General Assembly and later served as acting Principal Clerk in 2002–2003 (and again in 2009). A number of other senior administrators in the Church are women. Women have also been taking an increasing role in important non-pastoral functions in the church: in 2000 Rosemary Goring became the first female editor of Life and Work.\n\nThe first female Moderator of the General Assembly was Dr Dr Alison Elliot in 2004, who was also the first elder to hold the post since the 16th century. In May 2007 the Revd Sheilagh M. Kesting became the first female minister to be elected as Moderator of the General Assembly.\n\n"}
{"id": "2155164", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2155164", "title": "Golden perch", "text": "Golden perch\n\nThe golden perch (\"Macquaria ambigua\") is a medium-sized, yellow or gold-coloured Australian freshwater fish species found primarily in the Murray-Darling River system, though a subspecies is found in the Lake Eyre-Cooper Creek system, and another subspecies, suspected to be ancestral to all other populations, is found in the Fitzroy River system in Queensland. Golden perch are not a true perch of the genus \"Perca\", but a member of the Percichthyidae (temperate perches) family.\n\nThis relatively widespread and widely stocked species is an important angling fish in Australia.\n\nOther common names for golden perch are \"goldens\", “yellowbelly”, and \"callop\", the last generally used only in South Australia.\n\nGolden perch are medium-sized fish, commonly 30–40 cm and 1–2 kg in rivers. Fish from rivers are smaller and somewhat streamlined — fish in man-made impoundments are much deeper-bodied and show much greater average and maximum sizes. In rivers, has been recorded to 9 kg, in impoundments to 15 kg. A 24-kg fish caught from Kow Swamp, Victoria in the early 1900s, and labelled and sold as a \"Murray perch\", is often referred to as the largest recorded golden perch, but this record is doubtful — this record grossly exceeds all other size records for golden perch, and the specimen in question is far more likely to have been a Murray cod (\"Maccullochella peelii\"), which grow to far larger sizes than golden perch.\n\nGolden perch have an elongated, deep but laterally compressed body, with a sizable mouth, small to moderate-sized eyes, a distinct curve to the forehead, and a distinct \"hump\" above the head. The opercula or gill covers possess a small, flat spine sharp enough to cut unwary fishermen's fingers. The caudal fin, soft dorsal fin, and anal fin are rounded. The spiny dorsal fin is short to moderate in length and strong. Golden perch vary from in colour from pale silvery-gold (turbid waters) to deep yellow/gold or bronze-black (very clear waters).\n\nThe genus name \"Macquaria\" derives from the Macquarie River, where the first species in the genus \"Macquaria\" (Macquarie perch, \"M. australasica\") was collected. However, the genus name \"Macquaria\" was applied to golden perch much later. The naturalist Richardson actually named golden perch \"Datnia ambigua\" and applied the specific name \"ambigua\" (Latin for \"doubtful\") to the species because, as he states in his species description, he could not decide in which of two genera to place it, \"Dules\" (now \"Kuhlia\" species) or \"Datnia\" (now various Terapontidae species):\n\nThis choice of specific name was unwittingly appropriate. Golden perch are neither a khulid nor a terapontid, and Richardson also erroneously stated the golden perch's habitat was \"Western Australia\", when in fact the species is not found in that state. (This error was corrected, presumably by Richardson himself, in at least one reprint of the publication in question.)\n\nGolden perch are native primarily to lowland reaches of the Murray–Darling River system, but also extend far into slope habitats and occasionally even lower upland reaches under a variety of original names. In the Murray–Darling system golden perch are often found in sympatry with Murray cod.\n\nThe \"Macquaria\" perches, of which golden perch are one, continue the trend present in Murray–Darling native fish genera of diversification into more generalist lowland species and more specialist upland species. Golden perch, \"M. ambigua\", represent the lowland species, while the closely related Macquarie perch, \"M. australasica\", is the more specialised upland species which used to inhabit the upland reaches of the southern Murray–Darling basin, although this endangered species has now been almost wholly displaced by introduced trout species, dams, and associated effects such as cold-water pollution, and habitat degradation/modification.\n\nLike many Murray–Darling native fish, golden perch have crossed river catchments through natural river capture/connection events. Golden perch are found naturally in the Fitzroy–Dawson River in central Queensland and the internal Lake Eyre–Cooper Creek drainage system of Central Australia. The fish has also been successfully introduced to other river systems in the Northern Territory, Queensland, and New South Wales, confusing studies of the natural range. Introductions into Western Australia have been unsuccessful.\n\nBoth of these separate populations are at least subspecies, possibly separate species, due to isolation from Murray–Darling populations, genetic drift, and natural selection. The taxonomy of golden perch has not been updated to reflect this, although the term \"Macquaria ambigua oriens\", denoting subspecies status, has recently appeared in literature discussing the Fitzroy–Dawson population. Some research indicates the Fitzroy River population is the ancestral golden perch population.\n\nIn the Murray River, wild male golden perch generally reach sexual maturity at 3 years of age and 32.5 cm in length, and wild female golden perch at 4 years of age and 40 cm in length. The latter fact is a concern given that minimum size limits for the species are currently less than 40 cm, at 30 cm.\n\nOriginally, temperatures close to 24 °C were considered necessary for golden perch to spawn, but as with all Murray-Darling fish species, multiple field studies have shown that their \"required\" spawning temperature is flexible and that they can and do spawn at lower temperatures. In the Barmah Forests region of the Murray River, for instance, fertilised drifting golden perch eggs have been netted in water temperatures as low as 16.9 degrees Celsius (full range 16.9 to 24.7 degrees). Golden perch have a flexible breeding strategy but generally (but not always) require a spring or summer flood or \"fresh\" (temporary, within-channel increase in flow) to stimulate spawning. Like some other primarily lowland native fish species of the Murray–Darling river system, these floods or freshes appear to be necessary for good survival and recruitment of spawned fish. Very small freshes appear to be sufficient for some spawning and recruitment, however.\n\nGolden perch are highly fecund; females between 2.2 and 2.4 kg produce about half a million eggs per spawning event, with fish above 2.5 kg producing well in excess of this number. The eggs are generally planktonic, and hatch fairly quickly (24 to 36 hours).\n\nLike other \"Macquaria\" species, sexual dimorphism is present, with females reaching much larger maximum sizes than males. Females also reach sexual maturity at older ages and larger sizes than males.\n\nVery long migrations are part of the golden perch's ecology, particularly preceding spawning. Adult fish have been recorded migrating well over 1,000 km when flood conditions allow passage over weirs and other man-made obstructions. Smaller migrations are important in the ecology and dispersal of juvenile fish. The evidence suggests that before European settlement, huge shoals of golden perch roamed the entire lowland and slope reaches of the vast Murray-Darling River system, unimpeded. Thus, the gradual loss of fish passage through the numerous dams, weirs, locks, and other barriers (estimated at 4,000 in the Murray-Darling system) now present has had severe impacts on the species. Some major weirs have been remediated to provide fish passage, however.\n\nGolden perch have unusually broad temperature limits, from 4 to 37 °C, and unusually high salinity limits for a freshwater fish, up to 33 parts per thousand.\n\nGolden perch continue the trend, among many native fish of southeast Australia, of being very long-lived. Longevity is a survival strategy in the often challenging Australian environment which ensures that most adults participate in at least one exceptional spawning and recruitment event. These events are often linked to unusually wet \"La Niña\" years and may only occur every one or two decades. Maximum recorded age is 26 years.\n\nAdult golden perch are carnivores, feeding on smaller fish and macrocrustaceans, including yabbies, shrimp, frogs, small fish, and aquatic invertebrates.\n\nGenerally a very good angling species (though renowned for being \"moody\"), golden perch are fished for throughout their range. Baits include small yabbies and shrimp, as well as various types of deeper-running lures. Recreational harvest of the species is suspected to be significant.\n\nWild populations have declined significantly, and a number of populations lost in upper reaches of rivers, due to dams and weirs blocking migration, mitigating floods and freshes, regulating flows, and releasing unnaturally cold water (\"thermal pollution\"), all of which interfere with migration, spawning, and recruitment. They are listed under the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988 and classified as \"Vulnerable\" for management purposes. Golden perch are extremely migratory and migration appears to have been important in maintaining populations over the length of rivers, particularly the upper reaches.\n\nWeirs are proving to be a more significant threat to golden perch than first thought, with a recent study showing that about 90% of golden perch larvae passing through undershot weirs are killed. The species is bred in hatcheries, though, in large numbers, and stocked. Concerns over genetic diversity issues are growing.\n\nand recruitment in the Murray River, Australia. \"River Research and Applications\". DOI: 10.1002/rra.1209\n\n"}

This was to deny them additional bargaining power, during negotiations.\n\nOne such action took place at a feature called \"the Hook\", a crescent shaped ridge near the Samichon River, a tributary of the Imjin River near Kaesong. There had been two previous engagements at the Hook earlier in the Korean War during 1952 when first the United States Marine Corps in October, and later the Scottish Black Watch regiment in November, had successfully held the Hook against PVA assaults. This ridge was a place of tactical importance in the 1st Commonwealth Division sector: it was a potential attack route which the PVA needed to take before assaulting Yong Dong, and opening up an invasion route to Seoul, the South Korean capital.\n\nOn 13 May 1953, the 1st Battalion the Duke of Wellington's Regiment (the \"Dukes\") were moved from its position on Yong Dong, to relieve the Black Watch, who had been defending The Hook. During this period, the Black Watch had suffered 12 soldiers killed, 73 wounded and 20 missing. Over the next two weeks The Dukes were under constant sniper, mortar and artillery fire. This was then followed up in a major action over the 28–29 May following heavy initial artillery and mortar fire, after which the PVA infantry attacked in force. Between 19 May and 29 May 'The Dukes' suffered 15 killed in action, 95 wounded and 32 missing. They were relieved by the Royal Fusiliers later in the day of 29 May.\n\nThe PVA forces charged the forward British positions once the bombardment ceased. The Dukes were outnumbered by 5 to 1. The fighting that ensued was bloody and akin to the battles that the 'Dukes' had fought during World War I. Artillery shells rained down on the Hook, from both the PVA and UN forces. The PVA launched a second attack but were cut down by heavy artillery fire from UN forces. Further attacks occurred during the day, but all were defeated in heavy fighting.\nJust 30 minutes into 29 May, the PVA forces launched another attack, but they were again beaten back. The Dukes began advancing up the line of the original trenches to dislodge the remaining PVA in the forward trenches. The 'Dukes' secured the Hook at 03:30. For their action they were awarded the Battle Honour \"The Hook\"\n\nBetween 19 May and 29 May, PVA artillery fired over 20,000 shells onto the Hook position, and 11,000 of these shells were fired on the night of 28 May, with over 200 heavy calibre shells hitting the Hook positions in the one hour between 17:45 and 18:45.\n\n37,818 shells of all calibres were fired by British artillery and the US Army I Corps artillery, including 155 mm, 8-inch, and 240 mm shells and 325 rockets from a US Rocket Battery.\n\nFiring directly upon the enemy, the Centurions of C Squadron, 1st Royal Tank Regiment used 504 20-pdr shells (the tanks also fired 22,500 rounds from their machine guns).\n\nPVA casualties were 167 by body count, while their actual casualties were estimated at 1,050 killed and over 800 wounded.\n\nThe 'Dukes' suffered 3 officers and 17 other ranks killed, 2 officers and 84 other ranks wounded, with 20 men missing. There were other casualties from other supporting units listed below. In addition, there were a further 50 casualties from artillery and mortar attacks between 10 May and 28 May.\n\nCasualties from other supporting units:\n\nFor their action, the Duke of Wellington's Regiment was awarded the Battle Honour The Hook 1953. Later, the 1st Battalion's Headquarter Company was renamed \"Hook Company\".\n\nShortly after on 2 June 1953, to mark the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II the division's artillery fired red, white and blue smoke shells onto the PVA lines (a \"\"feu de joie\"\"), followed by a salute from Centurion tanks which fired HE shells onto a single target.\n\nThe Hook was defended on a fourth occasion immediately prior to the armistice by an Australian infantry battalion, a New Zealand artillery regiment and two US infantry regiments, supported by British tanks, during the Battle of the Samichon River.\n\n\n"}

They consist of seven courses, five of which are offered at both the Standard Level (SL) and Higher Level (HL): Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Design Technology, and, as of August 2012, Computer Science (previously a group 5 elective course) is offered as part of the Group 4 subjects. There are also two SL only courses: a transdisciplinary course, Environmental Systems and Societies, that satisfies Diploma requirements for Groups 3 and 4, and Sports, Exercise and Health Science (previously, for last examinations in 2013, a pilot subject). Astronomy also exists as a school-based syllabus. Students taking two or more Group 4 subjects may combine any of the aforementioned.\n\nThe Chemistry, Biology, Physics and Design Technology courses will be updated for first teaching in September 2014, with syllabus updates (including a decrease in the number of options), a new internal assessment component similar to that of the Group 5 (mathematics) explorations, and \"a new concept-based approach\" dubbed \"the nature of science\". A new, standard level-only course will also be introduced to cater to candidates who do not wish to further their studies in the sciences, focusing on important concepts in Chemistry, Biology and Physics.\n\nAll group 4 subjects (except computer science and environmental systems and societies; see below) follow roughly the same format. Each subject has its Subject Specific Core (SSC), i.e., material taught at both the standard and higher levels. Students sitting the Higher Level examination study the Additional Higher Level (AHL) material. Lastly, there is a list of options for each subject from which two are chosen. Higher Level students are sometimes unable to choose certain options that are available to Standard Level students because the AHL already covers it. Ideally, students choose the options based on their own abilities and preferences, but in practice the options are usually chosen by the school (based on the school's scientific facilities as well as the discretion of the instructor). Students spend one-quarter of the 150 hours of SL instruction (240 hours for HL; however, both numbers are merely recommendations and are not enforced) doing practical work in the laboratory. Group 4 subjects at the Standard Level are tailored for students who do not see themselves in further science instruction after leaving the programme.\n\nAssessment of a Group 4 subject comprises the following:\n\nAt the Standard Level, the examinations are respectively 45 minutes, 1 hour and 15 minutes, and 1 hour long. At the Higher Level, they are 1 hour, 2 hours and 15 minutes, and 1 hour and 15 minutes long. Calculators are not permitted for Paper 1, but they (as well as a provided formula booklet and periodic table) are permitted for papers 2 and 3.\n\n80 hours of instruction on 8 topics\nwith 30 hours of instruction on two optional subjects:\nand 40 hours of practical work.\n\n80 hours on Physics SL core subjects, with 55 hours on 6 additional topics:\nand 45 hours of instruction on two optional subjects:\nand 60 hours of practical work.\n\n\n\n\n80 hours of instruction on the topics:\nand 30 hours on two options from the topics:\ntogether with 40 hours of practical work.\n\n80 hours on the core subjects of the Standard level course with 55 hours of instruction on these topics:\nand 45 hours on two of the options in the standard course, and 60 hours of practical work.\n\n\n\nBiology is the science of life and living organisms. Aside from instruction relevant to this, students are given the chance to learn complex laboratory techniques (e.g., DNA extraction) as well as develop mindful opinions about controversial topics in biology (e.g., stem-cell research and genetic modification). The syllabus lists thirteen topics, to be covered in an order varying from school to school:\n\n80 hours of instruction on 6 topics\n\n\nwith 30 hours of instruction on two options from:\n\n\n80 hours of instruction on 6 topics in the standard course and 55 hours on a further 5 topics:\n\nwith 45 hours of instruction on addition topics in the SL course plus:\n\n\n\n\nTopics addressed in this course include:\nwith additional topics in the \"higher level\":\n\n\n\nAll candidates study the 6 core topics (80 hours):\n\nIn addition, they also study two of the following four options (30 hours):\n\nAll topics are compulsory (i.e. there are no options).\nThe remaining 30 hours are derived from the internal assessment (practical work), making a total of 150 teaching hours.\n\nThere are two external assessment components and one internal assessment component.\n\nCalculators are \"required\" for both papers.\n\nCandidates will need to complete 30 hours of practical work throughout the course. Each of the three criteria - planning (Pl), data collection and processing (DCP) and discussion, evaluation and conclusion (DEC) - are assessed twice, while the fourth criterion - personal skills (PS) - is assessed summatively throughout the course. The maximum raw mark is 42, which contributes 20% of the course.\n\nThe computer science course was recently updated and moved from Group 5 (as an elective course) to Group 4, becoming a full course, from first examinations in 2014. The structure and assessment of the course has changed to greater emphasize problem solving rather than Java program construction. The curriculum model for the course still differs from other Group 4 subjects however.\n\nStandard Level candidates study the SL/HL core (80 hours) and the core of one option (30 hours), while Higher Level candidates study the SL/HL core (80 hours), HL extension (45 hours), an annually-issued case study (30 hours) and the whole of one option (30 + 15 hours). The remaining 40 hours for both Standard and Higher Level comes from the internal assessment component, for a total of 150 teaching hours at SL and 240 hours at HL.\n\n\n\n\nThere are three external assessment components and two internal assessment components.\n\nUnlike other Group 4 subjects, calculators are \"not permitted\" in any computer science examination.\n\nBoth SL and HL candidates must complete the following:\nBoth components carry a weightage of 30% (SL) or 20% (HL) of the computer science course.\n\nAll students of the Diploma Programme in any of these subjects, with the exception of environmental systems and societies, will compulsorily complete an inter-disciplinary and collaborative investigation called the Group 4 project. The Group 4 project assessment is included in the internal assessment marks. Students undertaking two or more group 4 courses will obtain the same mark for all of the courses.\n\n\n"}

The war lasted ten years and resulted in the victory of the Olympians and their dominion over the world. Another case is the Gigantomachy.\n\nThe gods were once again divided against one another, each supporting a different side during the Trojan War. In the \"Iliad\", multiple theomachies occur. One is fought between Diomedes with the direct aid of Athena against Ares (part of Diomedes' \"aristeia\" in Book 5). Ares is wounded by the spear guided by Athena; this is the first theomachy to occur chronologically in the \"Iliad\". Book 20 begins with Zeus' grant of permission to the gods to participate in the battle and is traditionally known under the title \"Theomachia\". In Book 21 (478ff.) there is fighting between Hera and Artemis. This battle is shown by Homer to be almost playful as Hera is smiling while she boxes the ears of Artemis, which causes Artemis to fly away in tears. Also in Book 21, Poseidon challenges Apollo to fight. Apollo rejects his offer and comments on the triviality of gods fighting over the whims of mortals while their own pain from injury would be transitory and quickly healed. Theomachy is purposely added to show the unbridgeable gap between mortal men and the immortals who rule them. By showing the triviality of divine pain, human suffering is highlighted.\n\n"}

It lies in the most northeast corner of the province Gelderland, about half a mile from the German border. The river Berkel enters The Netherlands east of Rekken. Rekken is also known in international aviation, by the VHF omnidirectional range called 'Rekken' (RKN).\n\nIn the 12th century Rekken is known in documents as part of the Parish Eibergen. Later it was allowed by the Bishopric of Münster to form an independent parish. The \"Rekkenaren\" built a Catholic Church on the northern bank of the Berkel.\n\nAround 1616 the Heerlijkheid Borculo, (until then an independent state, where Rekken was a part of) became a property of the duke of Guelders, and with that to the former Dutch Republic. The church in Rekken had to reform to the Dutch Reformed Church, based on the theory of John Calvin. Many Catholics went to church in Oldenkotte, just across the German border.\n\nFreedom of religion came when Rekken became part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. The Catholics then built a church on the southern bank of the Berkel. The river and the two churches divided the village in two parts. This is still visible nowadays.\n"}
{"id": "2155215", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2155215", "title": "Son et lumière (show)", "text": "Son et lumière (show)\n\nSon et lumière ( (French, lit. \"sound and light\")), or a sound and light show, is a form of nighttime entertainment that is usually presented in an outdoor venue of historic significance.\n\nSpecial lighting effects are projected onto the façade of a building or ruin and synchronized with recorded or live narration and music to dramatize the history of the place. The invention of the concept is credited to Paul Robert-Houdin, who was the curator of the Château de Chambord in France, which hosted the world's first \"son et lumière\" in 1952. Another was established in the early 1960s at the site of the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt.\n\nThis nighttime medium naturally lends itself to ecclesiastical buildings, stately homes and ruins, and has rapidly become very popular in France where about 50 annual productions take place, principally in the Loire Valley, at the Palace of Versailles and at Les Invalides in Paris.\n\nThe format usually involves no active participation by actors but a recorded narrative of the history of the building concerned by one or a cast of voices. To this is added music or sound effects as appropriate, all of which is synchronised to lighting and/or projection effects which provide the visual dimension. Pyrotechnic effects are occasionally included for added spectacle.\n\nA relatively recent variation is that, rather than the music and narration coming through a concert-like sound system, they may use headsets, such as in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania's \"Lights of Liberty\". This allows an audience to move through a historic district as the show proceeds.\n\nIn France, \"son et lumière\" shows are performed in and around France's historical châteaux.\n\nIn neighboring Luxembourg, a \"son et lumière\" event took place in 2007 at the Chateau de Septfontaines.\n\nIn other countries, \"son et lumière\" has been mounted at the Forum in Rome and at the Parthenon in Athens.\n\nIn the United States, the first such presentation took place at Independence Hall in Philadelphia in 1962. Another presentation took place at George Washington's Mount Vernon in May 1976 as France's bicentennial gift to the United States. The opening performance was attended by French President Giscard d'Estaing and American President Gerald Ford.\n\nFurther afield, the first African production was at the Pyramids of Giza at Cairo, Egypt, in 1961, while the first in Asia was the Red Fort in Delhi, India in 1965 by the India Tourism Development Corporation.\n\nCanterbury Cathedral in England featured a \"son et lumière\" in 1965 and more recently in 2005, along with Rochester Cathedral and Castle as part of the European \"Cathedrales en Lumière\" project.\n\nIn Britain, where the majority of such productions have been staged at churches, cathedrals and abbeys, indoor presentations are frequently preferred, particularly as architectural gems might otherwise not be shown to best advantage. The first British production was at Greenwich Palace in south London in 1957. In England in particular, where \"son et lumière\" is as well received as it is in France, many of the nations's principal historic houses and church buildings have enjoyed such a production. Of particular interest have been the ones at Canterbury Cathedral (produced as part of the European \"Cathedrales en Lumière\" events), Rochester Castle, St Augustine's Abbey, St. George's Hall, Liverpool, Tewkesbury Abbey, St Paul's Cathedral, Hampton Court Palace, and at Chartwell, the country home of Winston Churchill. Part of the London 2012 Olympic bid involved the use of \"son et lumière\" inspired light projections of athletes upon various London buildings.\n\nIn India, popular shows are at Red Fort, Amer Fort, Khajuraho, Akbari Quila, Ajmer, Jantar Mantar, Jaipur, Purana Qila, Delhi, and Golconda Fort. Most of these shows highlight historic tapestry of the place.\n\nIn Peru, a \"son et lumière\" show opened in Park of the Reserve, Lima in 2007, called \"Circuito Mágico del Agua\" (\"magic water circuit\") which has a Guinness World Record as the world's largest water source exposed in a public park.\n\nIn Canada, the National Capital Commission has sponsored a sound and light show on Parliament Hill in Ottawa every year since 1984, from early July to mid-September.\n\nIn Australia, \"Blood Under the Southern Cross\", shown at Sovereign Hill in Ballarat since 1992, depicts the events of the 1854 Eureka Rebellion.\n\nIn Israel, a son et lumière production is presented both at the Tower of David in the Citadel of the Old City of Jerusalem, and at the desert butte of Masada.\n\nComposers who have produced son et lumière shows include Jacqueline Nova and Halim El-Dabh. French electronic music composer Jean Michel Jarre has incorporated son et lumière productions into his live concerts, which often take place outdoors at historical sites, sometimes with more than one million spectators.\n\nOn December 31, 2017, the Burj Khalifa used an LED lighting system to present \"Light Up Dubai\"—a multimedia show that served as its New Year's countdown in lieu of a fireworks show (which had been one of the most expensive fireworks displays in the world). It set a record for the largest light and sound show displayed on a single building; for 2018-19, the show was supplemented by the return of its fireworks.\n\n"}

He is a six-time Emmy Award-winner. Vilanch is best known to the public for his four-year stint on \"Hollywood Squares\", as a celebrity participant; behind the scenes he was head writer for the show. In 2000, he performed off-Broadway in his self-penned one-man show, \"Bruce Vilanch: Almost Famous\".\n\nFrom 2000 to 2014, Vilanch was the head writer for the Oscars, after being an Oscar program co-writer for the previous ten years. He is a featured writer for the Tonys, Grammys and Emmys.\n\nVilanch was born in New York City and raised in Paterson, New Jersey. When he was four years old, he was adopted by Jonas Vilanch, an optometrist, and his wife Henne, a housewife. Having her own theatrical aspirations, Vilanch's mother helped launch her son's show business career by getting him signed on with Lane Bryant's Charming Chub division as a chubby child model. Upon graduating from high school, Vilanch attended Ohio State University as a theater and journalism student. While there, he appeared in student theater productions and wrote reviews, hoping it would be the beginning of a career as a playwright. In 1999 Vilanch stated, \"I was going to be Neil Simon, batting out one Broadway show after another.\"\n\nVilanch is Jewish and attended Hebrew school, was a member of United Synagogue Youth, and had a Bar Mitzvah ceremony.\n\nVilanch's career in the entertainment industry began with writing features for \"The Chicago Tribune\". As an entertainment writer, he began spending time with as many celebrities as would let him. It was how he met then-struggling nightclub singer Bette Midler. Becoming friends, Vilanch later wrote comedy material for Midler's 1974 Broadway show \"Clams on the Half Shell\" and co-wrote \"Divine Madness\" for her in 1980.\n\nFollowing a move to Los Angeles, Vilanch was a co-writer for \"The Donny & Marie Show\", 1978's negatively received \"Star Wars Holiday Special\", and the short-lived \"Brady Bunch Variety Hour\". After cancellation of the Brady Bunch show, he went on to write jokes for Lily Tomlin, Billy Crystal, Roseanne Barr, Rosie O'Donnell, Paul Reiser, Dame Elizabeth Taylor, Steven Tyler of Aerosmith, and Robin Williams.\n\nThe night before the final broadcast of Johnny Carson's \"The Tonight Show\", Bette Midler serenaded Carson with \"You Made Me Watch You\", to the tune of \"You Made Me Love You (I Didn't Want to Do It)\", with lyrics written by Vilanch, the farewell song later winning an Emmy award. For four years, Vilanch was head writer and celebrity square on \"Hollywood Squares\", next to friend and client Whoopi Goldberg.\nSince 1980, Vilanch has been a reporter and columnist for \"The Advocate\", writing both humorous and serious pieces. \"Bruce!: My Adventures in the Skin Trade and Other Essays\", a 2000 collection of his writings, was nominated for a Lambda Literary Award.\n\nWhen asking him to write material for one of her concert tours, Barbra Streisand offered what Vilanch felt was a \"ridiculously low\" wage. Vilanch declined her offer. She later asked him to write for one of her upcoming Las Vegas appearances.\n\nVilanch co-wrote the book for the musical \"Platinum\", which briefly played on Broadway in 1978. He has also contributed to concert shows starring Michael Feinstein, Bette Midler and Diana Ross.\n\nAs a songwriter, Vilanch co-wrote \"Where Is My Man\" with musicians Fred Zarr and Jacques Morali. The song was popularized by singer/actress Eartha Kitt in 1983. Also with Zarr and Morali, Vilanch co-wrote \"Sex Over the Phone,\" a minor hit for the Village People that later became a cult favorite.\n\nIn 2008, Vilanch co-wrote \"The Showgirl Must Go On\" with Midler. The show opened at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, receiving positive reviews. Stage and screen veteran Florence Henderson and Vilanch teamed for \"An Evening with Friends\" in 2010. The show featured Henderson sharing songs and stories from her career on stage, screen, and television. Vilanch had a longstanding friendship with Henderson, writing for her one-woman show as well as several of \"The Brady Bunch Variety Hour\" episodes in the early 1980s.\n\nVilanch wrote for the Academy Awards from 1989 to 2014, providing topical joke material for the show's hosts. In the 1990s, Vilanch collaborated with hosts Whoopi Goldberg, David Letterman and Billy Crystal. He became head writer in 2000, serving until 2014.\n\nAmong Vilanch's duties as Oscar writer were coming up with additional jokes for the host based on unexpected events that have occurred during the telecast. Most memorably, at the 1992 ceremony he came up with a series of one-liners that host Billy Crystal told throughout the night after 73-year-old Jack Palance (Crystal's \"City Slickers\" co-star) did one-armed push-ups during his Best Supporting Actor acceptance speech.\n\nIn a 2010 \"Vanity Fair\" interview, Vilanch was asked for whom he wrote the Oscars show jokes, replying: \"I write across the board. Every year it breaks down differently, depending on the host, but as we get closer to the date, all of the writers tend to be writing over each other. Everyone's contributing to everybody else's work. There are four of us writing the actual show, and you end up writing and rewriting so many things at the same time. So I do a little of everything. There's a lot of mileage involved in writing for the Academy Awards, you go through a lot of hoops.\" When asked if he could see himself doing the job for another 21 years, he replied: \"Absolutely. It's the greatest show on Earth. It's like asking somebody, 'Hey, would you like to play in the Super Bowl next year?' Did anybody get into football not to play in the Super Bowl? Does anybody get into show business not to do the biggest show in the world?\"\n\nIn 1975, Vilanch made his feature film début playing a dress manufacturer in the film \"Mahogany\", starring Diana Ross. His professional relationship with Ross continued by writing material for her stage act.\n\nIn the 1980s, Vilanch had a few acting appearances, including a bit part in an episode of \"Bosom Buddies\" and a brief scene in \"Breathless\" with his longtime friend Richard Gere. In 1984, he had a role in the comedy/science-fiction film \"The Ice Pirates\". In the 1990s, Vilanch appeared on TV again in \"Law & Order\".\n\nIn 2000, Vilanch performed his off-Broadway one-man show \"Bruce Vilanch: Almost Famous\" at the Westbeth Theatre Center.\n\nIn 2005, Vilanch starred on Broadway as Edna Turnblad in the long-running 2002 musical \"Hairspray\" after playing the role for two years in the show's first national stage tour of 2003–6.\n\nBruce Vilanch's first television appearance as himself was in 1988, when he was interviewed by Chris Aable, the host and producer of the cable show \"Hollywood Today\".\n\nHe played himself in a 2001 episode of \"The Simpsons\" titled \"Pokey Mom\".\n\nVilanch appeared in the third season of \"Celebrity Fit Club\" in 2006, losing 21 pounds over the course of the show.\n\nOn \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" 3, Vilanch appeared as a guest judge dressed as Santa Claus. On \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" 5, he appeared as a coach helping the contestants in a comedy roast of RuPaul.\n\nIn April 2008, Vilanch filmed a commercial that spoofs Kobe Bryant's jump over an Aston Martin. In his video, Vilanch is distracted, does not jump, and is run over by a semi truck.\n\nHe played himself in the 2008 film, \"You Don't Mess with the Zohan\" and in \"Walk a Mile in My Pradas\", a 2011 American gay body-switching romantic comedy film. Then in 2012, he played Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in \"Tatyana Ali\", an episode of \"The Eric Andre Show\", on Cartoon Network's late night programming block Adult Swim.\n\nIn 2015, Vilanch played himself in a guest voice role on the Disney XD animated series \"\".\n\nVilanch was the subject of Andrew J. Kuehn's 1999 documentary \"Get Bruce!\" The film included interviews with Bette Midler, Robin Williams, Billy Crystal, and Whoopi Goldberg and grossed 43 thousand dollars in the domestic market. Vilanch's mother, whom he credits with developing his sense of humor, also appeared in the documentary.\n\nThe documentary \"Laughing Matters...The Men\", also released as \"Laughing Matters: Gay Comedy in America\" (2007), featured Vilanch alongside Alec Mapa, Bob Smith, Scott Kennedy, Andre Kelley and Eddie Sarfaty.\n\nHe appears as a commentator in the 2010 Christopher Hines gay body image documentary \"The Adonis Factor\".\n\nAs well as performing in non-profit benefits, Vilanch's charitable work includes serving on the honorary board of Aid For AIDS and once serving as master of ceremonies for the Los Angeles organization's largest annual fundraiser, \"Quest for the Crown\" (later changed to \"Best In Drag Show\").\n\nVilanch emceed the event \"Dancers Responding to AIDS\", a program of Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS, in 2009 and 2010. In October 2010, Vilanch co-wrote and hosted the Los Angeles PAWS fundraiser, \"An Evening with Tab Hunter\".\n\nVilanch has won two consecutive Emmy Awards for his writing of the Academy Award telecasts as well as an additional four Emmys for Outstanding Variety Show.\n\nVilanch has also been the recipient of a number of awards for his work in support of AIDS charities and LGBTQ rights charities:\n\nVilanch is known for his physical appearance, particularly his weight, his long blonde hair, distinctive glasses, frequently with brightly coloured frames, and his collection of double entendre-themed T-shirts.\n\n"}

{"id": "2155259", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2155259", "title": "Skip (audio playback)", "text": "Skip (audio playback)\n\nA skip occurs when a phonograph (gramophone), cassette tape or Compact Disc player malfunctions or is disturbed so as to play incorrectly, causing a break in sound or a jump to another part of the recording.\n\nVinyl records are easily scratched and vinyl readily acquires a static charge, attracting dust that is difficult to remove completely. Dust and scratches cause audio clicks and pops and, in extreme cases, they can cause the needle (stylus) to skip over a series of grooves, or worse yet, cause the needle to skip backwards, creating an unintentional locked groove that repeats the same 1.8 seconds (at 33⅓ RPM) or 1.3 seconds (at 45 RPM) of track over and over again. Locked grooves are not uncommon and are even heard occasionally in broadcasts. The locked groove gave rise to the expression \"broken record\" referring to someone who continually repeats the same statement with little if any variation.\n\nA \"skip\" or \"jump\" is when the laser of a Compact Disc player cannot read the faulty groove or block of data. Skips are usually caused by marks blocking the path of the beam to the disc, e.g. a finger mark, hair, dirt in general, or a scratch. Since the read mechanism has very little contact with the disc's surface and the data itself is not on the outer layer of the disc, the blockage is not a physical issue as with a record, but rather reflective.\n\nEarly CD players were very basic in nature. A Laser tracks the blocks of data from the centre of the disc outwards, while the disc itself revolves at a variable speed between a starting speed of 495 RPM, and a minimum finishing speed of 212 RPM. Generally, one cycle constituted one block of data.\nIf there is a faulty block of data, the player may do one of the following:\nA player may utilise one or more of these techniques, depending on how faulty the data is. In the case of severe, irrecoverable damage to the data, the player may try to rescan the disc to relocate its position. In this case, the machine may make a series of audible chirping noises as the laser is moving from the faulty block to the data information area and back again.\n\nWhen CD players began their induction into battery-powered portable machines and vehicles, a skip could happen even for simple movement such as walking, vehicles jerking etc. Therefore a strategy was needed to try to prevent this. When certain techniques were tested and failed, the most successful and popular method to date was to spin the disc faster in order to read a chunk of the data into memory while playing. This meant that the player itself could concentrate on reading while the software controlling the buffers and memory distribution could also act as the audio feed. In the case of a minor error, the disc's rotation would again speed up to facilitate several attempts to read the data.\nA technique was also developed for testing data to prevent severe skipping.\nThese two techniques were largely successful, unless of course the data was damaged beyond repair, in which case the audio may stop, or skip as before.\nIn a computer, the CD-ROM drive is governed by the program controlling it. In most cases, the BIOS has rudimentary access to the drive for boot purposes, while operating systems usually come bundled with their own drivers. The drive itself has very little instruction, apart from direct instructions, such as spin up, read data etc.\nWhen playing a CD in the computer, the media player of choice is giving instructions to the CD drive, whether through the operating system's drivers or by accessing the device's low-level interface itself. Usually, Similar to modern players, the media player will be reading audio into memory for later playback, especially given the extreme speeds used by CD ROM drives in order to access raw data on other discs. Because of this, if there is a fault during playback, the player will already be performing a checksum to verify the data read is correct. If it is wrong, the audio is usually stopped depending on the player.\n\nCassette tape players can cause skips when the tape being played is worn or in some other way damaged. Since the tape is rolled into a reel, it depends on how the tape runs across the roll as to how the skip affects playback. Indeed, some early artists such as the Beatles deliberately rearranged the tape reels in order to produce loops used in their recordings.\n\nElectronic media on a computer can often skip. Such media may include compressed and uncompressed audio, and video containing audio. Generally this cannot happen to music instructive files such as MIDI or Mod files, however depending on the circumstance single notes may become \"jammed\", when the note off message is not received by the playback device.\n\nComputer skips can be caused by lack of available RAM or processing power, damaged storage mediums (CD, hard drive etc.), a crash in the playback software, or a corrupted, incomplete or damaged audio file. Depending on the player and the operating system, a skip usually consists of a 50MS, 300MS, 500MS or a one second loop, depending on the size or length of the chunk of data that is currently loaded into memory.\n\nCompact Disc skipping is prevalent in glitch music.\n\n"}

Since 1 January 1985 Lekkerkerk is no longer an independent municipality.\n\nLekkerkerk is mostly an agricultural community with its housing, including attractive 17th, 18th, and 19th century farms, stretched out on the dike along the Lek River. Near the Reformed Church (Johanneskerk), the development is denser and forms the town centre.\n\nThe oldest evidence of habitation in the Krimpenerwaard is no older than the 10th century. It is assumed that systematic cultivation only began in the 11th and early 12th century, with the river levees functioning as the base.\n\nInitially the name of the village and its surroundings was \"\"Leckelant\"\". The name \"\"Leckerkercke\"\" was used for the first time in 1276 when a village centre formed around the new church and across the Lek River \"Nieuw Leckelant\" began to develop. In 1342 Lekkerkerk was a county with the subordinate fiefdoms of Krimpen (Krimpen aan de Lek and Krimpen aan den IJssel), Stormpolder, Ouderkerk aan den IJssel and Zuidbroek.\n\nThe first real significant growth of the village started in 1900 when several alleys were built perpendicular to the river dike. After 1950 the growth accelerated. Especially after the inauguration of the Algera Bridge at Krimpen aan den IJssel, the Krimpenerwaard became a popular location for commuters to Rotterdam.\n\nIn 1980 and 1981 Lekkerkerk gained national notoriety when it was found that the soil underneath the new neighbourhood west of the Kerkweg (Church Road) was very polluted. The cost for removal and clean-up was 188 million Dutch Guilders (85 million Euros).\n\nOn 1 January 1985, the municipalities of Lekkerkerk and Krimpen aan de Lek merged to form the new municipality of Nederlek.\n\nFor centuries the economy of Lekkerkerk has been agriculture, fishing, shipping, and ship building.\n\nLike so many other peat areas in Holland and Utrecht, agriculture in the Krimpenerwaard was characterized by crop cultivation in the higher lands and the lower areas used for cattle grazing. The primary crop was grain, but hops and cabbage were also cultivated with some orchards and even vineyards present as well.\n\nAs a result of the important fishing industries along the river, wood and ship building industries developed, as well as ropemaking. Ropemakers used to use hemp for ropes. So hemp has been cultivated on a large scale in the Krimpenerwaard since around 1600. Circa 1930, the Opperduit area still consisted almost exclusively of hemp growers but today the whole Krimpenerwaard is used for cattle grazing.\n\n"}

It is situated 300 kilometres southeast of Prague, in the south-east of Moravia (Czech: \"Morava\"). It lies in the Vizovice Highlands (\"Vizovická vrchovina\") and near the White Carpathian Mountains (\"Bílé Karpaty\").\n\nThe history of Uherský Brod, a name which can be loosely translated as the 'Hungarian ford' or 'river crossing to Hungary', can be traced back to the 10th century. In 1272 it had become sufficiently important that Přemysl Otakar II granted it the status of a King's town. \n\nThe 16th century was the all too short golden age of the town, which flourished under the lordship of John of Kaunic (\"Czech:\" Jan z Kaunic). The town hall and lords' house were built during this time. The good times came to an end at the beginning of the 17th century when Hungarians started to attack it in a series of invasions.\n\nLater, German and Jewish communities began to grow and in the 19th century the town was transformed by industrial development, but managed to retain its character and charm.\n\nWorld War II brought further invasion and the development of military industries. Česká Zbrojovka, a precision firearms manufacturer, plays a leading role in the region's industry. It also led to the loss of the town's Jewish community, the striking reminder of which is the Jewish cemetery.\n\nOn July 22, 2011, unknown persons overturned eight tombstones in the Jewish Cemetery in what seems to have been an anti-Semitic act.\n\nOn 24 February 2015, a shooting occurred at a restaurant in Uherský Brod. Nine people were killed, including the gunman, a 63-year-old local man. One other woman suffered severe gunshot wounds, but survived. The Czech Interior Minister, Milan Chovanec, stated, \"According to available information, it was not a terrorist attack\".\n\nWith the White Carpathian national park and the trans-Carpathian cycle routes nearby, Uherský Brod has become a tourist attraction. The town has a local brewery, Janáček, that supplies mainly in the region. The name is often confused with Leoš Janáček, a Czech composer, but the two have little in common. On a hill above the town is an observatory from 1961, having been funded and built entirely by the town's residents. the observatory had plans for a large planetarium to help it with its educational message.\n\nUherský Brod is a possible birthplace of Jan Amos Komenský (Latinised: Comenius). However, most likely it is just a place where he spent a part of his life. There is a museum and a secondary grammar school that bear his name. The link to Comenius was the reason for the twinning of Uherský Brod and Naarden, the Netherlands, where Comenius is buried.\n\nA local football club, ČSK Uherský Brod, plays in the Moravian–Silesian Football League (3rd tier of the Czech football league system).\n\nUherský Brod is twinned with:\n\n"}

In 1989 there was a reorganisation of local governments, and Vinkeveen became a part of De Ronde Venen.\nVinkeveen is mainly famous for the Vinkeveense Plassen (Lakes of Vinkeveen), an area of lakes and sand islands east of the village. It is an important recreational area, with facilities for swimming, diving and yachting. A permit is required for recreational diving in the lake. There is a marina on the north shore of the lakes.\n"}
{"id": "2155301", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2155301", "title": "Mijdrecht", "text": "Mijdrecht\n\nMijdrecht is a town in the Netherlands with about 15,000 residents. It located in the municipality of De Ronde Venen, about west of the main A2 motorway, between Utrecht and Amsterdam. \n\nThe main street is the Dorpstraat, where most shops and the municipal offices are located. There is a police office, a fire department, 6 supermarkets, sport facilities, and a coffee shop. There is no police or doctor at the weekends.\n\nIn 1085 the parish of Mijdrecht, together with those of Wilnis, Tamen, Zevenhoven en Kudelstaart, was granted to the Deaconate of St. John (Proosdij van Sint-Jan), by Conrad, the Prince-bishop of Utrecht, in return for a depot in the Holland-Utrecht border region and the guarantee that the deaconate would develop the rugged terrain for habitation.\n1085 is the year taken as the founding of the municipality of Mijdrecht. Remains of the famous Pepinos Hendricos, a particular hairy neanderthal kind, have been found here. \n\nIn 1815, soon after the French-Batavian period, the mayor of Mijdrecht, Hendrikus Abraham van Doorn van Noordscharwoude, submitted a questionnaire to the Minister of War. The questionnaire, about local conditions, reported a population of 3,000, including 5 carpenters, 2 smiths, 1 brazier, 2 brick-layers, 6 bakers, 8 tailors, and 6 cobblers.\n\nMost parts of the city (like Hofland-Noord and Molenland) were built after 1980.\n\nIn 1989 the municipality of Mijdrecht was merged into De Ronde Venen.\n\nThe city has continued to grow through \"Wickelhof I and II\" expansions.\n\nDuring the early 20th Century, Mijdrecht was a growing community. In 1925, the then-municipality of Mijdrecht had a population of 4,506, which grew to 4,618 in 1940.\nIn 1950, the population of the municipality had grown to 5,379.\nIn 1988, the last year that Mijdrecht was a separate municipality, the municipality population was 16,414.\n\nIn recent years, Mijdrecht has had a declining population. In 2016 it had a population of 15,230, compared to 15,865 in 2010. This decline is particular in the 0-15 and 25-45 age ranges, with children (0-15) declining from 18% of the population in 2010 to 16% in 2016, and mid-range adults (25-45) declining from 25% in 2010 to 22% in 2016. By contrast, the percentage of seniors (65+) has grown from 14% in 2010 to 18% in 2016.\n\nMijdrecht consists of a center around the Dorpstraat, and a number of planned residential neighborhoods, of which Proosdijland is the oldest.\nEast of the Dorpstraat and Rondweg lies the industrial area.\n\nEver since the mergers of the municipalities of Mijdrecht, Wilnis, and Vinkeveen/Waverveen in 1989, Mijdrecht has been governed by the Municipality of De Ronde Venen. The municipality is governed by a Municipal Council (Dutch: \"gemeenteraad\") presently consisting of 27 councillors.\n\nDay-to-day executive administration is performed by the council of mayor and aldermen (Dutch: \"college van burgemeester en wethouders\"). The mayor, Maarten Divendal, was appointed by the crown on 22 November 2011. The remainder of the council consists of three aldermen and the municipal secretary, who heads the municipal administration.\n\nMijdrecht is the location for the Dutch branch of S. C. Johnson & Son, where it is housed in an office building designed by Hugh Maaskant on the Groot-Mijdrechtstraat.\n\nThe following numbers of businesses by sector were reported by Statistics Netherlands for 2016:\nMijdrecht has seven elementary schools, one in nearly all of the residential neighborhoods. A number of these are public, Catholic and Protestant.\nThere is one high/secondary school called Veenlanden College. The Mijdrecht campus of the school contains around 1500 students in MAVO, HAVO and Atheneum levels.\n\nMijdrecht is home to the football and basketball club SV Argon, which was created after a merger of three football clubs in Mijdrecht and Wilnis in 1971.\n\nFrom 1982 until 2012, Mijdrecht was the location for an annual national festival called AJOC (\"Algemene Jongeren Ontspannings Club\" - General Youth Recreation Club).\n\nIn 1937, the provincial almanac of Utrecht reported Mijdrecht having a population of 4,717, of whom 1,838 were Roman Catholic, 1,646 Dutch Reformed, 877 Reformed, and 136 not being members of a church.\nCurrently, there are numerous protestant churches, of various denominations and one Catholic Church.\nThere was also a synagogue on the Kerkweg.\n\nPresently, Mijdrecht also has a Muslim community with a mosque, the Hakyol Moskee in Twistvlied. The Hakyol Mosque shares an address with the Veenhartkerk, a Christian Reformed church.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2155310", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2155310", "title": "Common ethanol fuel mixtures", "text": "Common ethanol fuel mixtures\n\nSeveral common ethanol fuel mixtures are in use around the world. The use of pure hydrous or anhydrous ethanol in internal combustion engines (ICEs) is only possible if the engines are designed or modified for that purpose, and used only in automobiles, light-duty trucks and motorcycles. Anhydrous ethanol can be blended with gasoline (petrol) for use in gasoline engines, but with high ethanol content only after minor engine modifications.\n\nEthanol fuel mixtures have \"E\" numbers which describe the percentage of ethanol fuel in the mixture by volume, for example, E85 is 85% anhydrous ethanol and 15% gasoline. Low-ethanol blends, from E5 to E25, although internationally the most common use of the term refers to the E10 blend.\n\nBlends of E10 or less are used in more than 20 countries around the world, led by the United States, where ethanol represented 10% of the U.S. gasoline fuel supply in 2011. Blends from E20 to E25 have been used in Brazil since the late 1970s. E85 is commonly used in the U.S. and Europe for flexible-fuel vehicles. Hydrous ethanol or E100 is used in Brazilian neat ethanol vehicles and flex-fuel light vehicles and hydrous E15 called hE15 for modern petrol cars in the Netherlands.\n\nE10, a fuel mixture of 10% anhydrous ethanol and 90% gasoline sometimes called gasohol, can be used in the internal combustion engines of most modern automobiles and light-duty vehicles without need for any modification on the engine or fuel system. E10 blends are typically rated as being 2 to 3 octane numbers higher than regular gasoline and are approved for use in all new U.S. automobiles, and mandated in some areas for emissions and other reasons. The E10 blend and lower ethanol content mixtures have been used in several countries, and its use has been primarily driven by the several world energy shortages that have taken place since the 1973 oil crisis.\n\nOther common blends include E5 and E7. These concentrations are generally safe for recent engines that should run on pure gasoline. As of 2006, mandates for blending bioethanol into vehicle fuels had been enacted in at least 36 states/provinces and 17 countries at the national level, with most mandates requiring a blend of 10 to 15% ethanol with gasoline.\n\nOne measure of alternative fuels in the U.S. is the \"gasoline-equivalent gallon\" (GEG). In 2002, the U.S. used as motor fuel, ethanol equal to 137,000 terajoules (TJ), the energy equivalent of 1.13 billion U.S. gallons (4.3 billion liters) of gasoline. This was less than 1% of the total fuel used that year.\n\nE10 and other blends of ethanol are considered to be useful in decreasing U.S. dependence on foreign oil, and can reduce carbon monoxide (CO) emissions by 20 to 30% under the right conditions. Although E10 does decrease emissions of CO and greenhouse gases such as CO by an estimated 2% over regular gasoline, it can cause increases in evaporative emissions and some pollutants depending on factors such as the age of the vehicle and weather conditions. According to the Philippine Department of Energy, the use of not more than a 10% ethanol-gasoline mixture is not harmful to cars' fuel systems. Generally, automobile gasoline containing alcohol (ethanol or methanol) is not recommended to be used in aircraft.\n\n\nA 2011 study conducted by VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland found practically no difference in fuel consumption in normal driving conditions between commercial gasoline grades 95E10 and 98E5 sold in Finland, despite the public perception that fuel consumption is significantly higher with 95E10. VTT performed the comparison test under controlled laboratory conditions and their measurements showed the cars tested used an average of of 95E10 per , as opposed to of 98E5 per . The difference was 0.07 in favor of 98E5 on average, meaning that using 95E10 gasoline, which has a higher ethanol content, increases consumption by 0.7%. When the measurements are normalized, the difference becomes 1.0%, a result that is highly consistent with an estimation of calorific values based on approximate fuel composition, which came out at 1.1% in favour of E5.\n\nE15 contains 15% ethanol and 85% gasoline. This is generally the highest ratio of ethanol to gasoline that is possible to use in vehicles recommended by some auto manufacturers to run on E10 in the US. This is due to ethanol's hydrophilia and solvent power.\n\nAs a result of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which mandates an increase in renewable fuels for the transport sector, the U.S. Department of Energy began assessments for the feasibility of using intermediate ethanol blends in the existing vehicle fleet as a way to allow higher consumption of ethanol fuel. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) conducted tests to evaluate the potential impacts of intermediate ethanol blends on legacy vehicles and other engines. In a preliminary report released in October 2008, the NREL presented the results of the first evaluations of the effects of E10, E15 and E20 gasoline blends on tailpipe and evaporative emissions, catalyst and engine durability, vehicle driveability, engine operability, and vehicle and engine materials. This preliminary report found none of the vehicles displayed a malfunction indicator light as a result of the ethanol blend used; no fuel filter plugging symptoms were observed; no cold start problems were observed at and laboratory conditions; and as expected, computer technology available in newer model vehicles adapts to the higher octane causing lower emissions with greater horsepower and in some cases greater fuel economy.\n\nIn March 2009, a lobbying group from the ethanol industry, Growth Energy, formally requested the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to allow the ethanol content in gasoline to be increased to 15% from 10%. Organizations doing such studies included the Energy Department, the State of Minnesota, the Renewable Fuels Association, the Rochester Institute of Technology, the Minnesota Center for Automotive Research, and Stockholm University in Sweden.\n\nIn October 2010, the EPA granted a waiver to allow up to 15% of ethanol blended with gasoline to be sold only for cars and light pickup trucks with a model year of 2007 or later, representing about 15% of vehicles on U.S. roads. In January 2011, the waiver was expanded to authorize use of E15 to include model year 2001 through 2006 passenger vehicles. The EPA also decided not to grant any waiver for E15 use in any motorcycles, heavy-duty vehicles, or nonroad engines because current testing data do not support such a waiver. According to the Renewable Fuels Association, the E15 waivers now cover 62% of vehicles on the road in the US, and the ethanol group estimates if all 2001 and newer cars and pickups were to use E15, the theoretical blend wall for ethanol use would be approximately 17.5 billion gallons (66.2 billion liters) per year. The EPA was still studying if older cars can withstand a 15% ethanol blend.\n\nThe EPA waiver authorizes sale of E15 only from Sep 15 to May 31 out of a black hose and a yellow hose to flex fuel vehicles only from June 1 to Sep 14. Retailers have shunned building infrastructure due to the costly regulatory requirements which have created a practical barrier to the commercialization of the higher blend. Most fuel stations do not have enough pumps to offer the new blend, few existing pumps are certified to dispense E15, and no dedicated tanks are readily available to store E15. Also, some state and federal regulations would have to change before E15 can be legally sold. The National Association of Convenience Stores, which represents most gasoline retailers, considers the potential for actual E15 demand is small, \"because the auto industry is not embracing the fuel and is not adjusting their warranties or recommendations for the fuel type.\" One possible solution to the infrastructure barriers is the introduction of blender pumps that allow consumers to turn a dial to select the level of ethanol, which would also allow owners of flexible-fuel cars to buy E85 fuel.\n\nIn June 2011 EPA, in cooperation with the Federal Trade Commission, issued its final ruling regarding the E15 warning label required to be displayed in all E15 fuel dispensers in the U.S. to inform consumers about what vehicles can, and what vehicles and equipment cannot, use the E15 blend. Both the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers and the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association complained that relying solely on this warning label is not enough to protect consumers from misfueling. In July 2012, a fueling station in Lawrence, Kansas became the first in the U.S. to sell the E15 blend. The fuel is sold through a blender pump that allows customers to choose between E10, E15, E30 or E85, with the latter blends sold only to flexible-fuel vehicles. , there are about 24 fueling stations selling E15 out of 180,000 stations across the U.S.\n\nIn December 2010, several groups, including the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, the American Petroleum Institute, the Association of International Automobile Manufacturers, the National Marine Manufacturers Association, the Outdoor Power Equipment Institute, and the Grocery Manufacturers Association, filed suit against the EPA in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The plaintiffs argued the EPA does not have the authority to issue a “partial waiver” that covers some cars and not others. Among other arguments, the groups argued that the higher ethanol blend is not only a problem for cars, but also for fuel pumps and underground tanks not designed for the E15 mixture. It was also argued that the rise in ethanol has contributed to the big jump in corn prices in recent years. In August 2012, the federal appeals court rejected the suit against the EPA. The case was thrown out on a technical reason, as the court ruled the groups did not have legal standing to challenge EPA's decision to issue the waiver for E15. In June 2013 the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal from industry groups opposed to the EPA ruling about E15, and let the 2012 federal appeals court ruling stand.\n\n, sales of E15 are not authorized in California, and according to the California Air Resources Board (CARB), the blend is still awaiting approval, and in a public statement the agency said that \"\"it would take several years to complete the vehicle testing and rule development necessary to introduce a new transportation fuel into California's market\".\"\n\nAccording to a survey conducted by the American Automobile Association (AAA) in 2012, only about 12 million out of the more than 240 million light-duty vehicles on the U.S. roads in 2012 are approved by manufacturers are fully compliant with E15 gasoline. According with the Association, BMW, Chrysler, Nissan, Toyota, and Volkswagen warned that their warranties will not cover E15-related damage. Despite the controversy, in order to adjust to EPA regulations, 2012 and 2013 model year vehicles manufactured by General Motors can use fuel containing up to 15 percent ethanol, as indicated in the vehicle owners' manuals. However, the carmaker warned that for model year 2011 or earlier vehicles, they \"strongly recommend that GM customers refer to their owners manuals for the proper fuel designation for their vehicles.\" Ford Motor Company also is manufacturing all of its 2013 vehicles E15 compatible, including hybrid electrics and vehicles with Ecoboost engines. Also Porsches built since 2001 are approved by its manufacturer to use E15. Volkswagen announced that for the 2014 model year, its entire lineup will be E15 capable. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles announced in August 2015 that all 2016 model year Chrysler/Fiat, Jeep, Dodge and Ram vehicles will be E15 compatible.\n\nIn November 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency opened for public comment its proposal to reduce the amount of ethanol required in the U.S. gasoline supply as mandated by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The agency cited problems with increasing the blend of ethanol above 10%. This limit, known as the \"blend wall,\" refers to the practical difficulty in incorporating increasing amounts of ethanol into the transportation fuel supply at volumes exceeding those achieved by the sale of nearly all gasoline as E10.\n\nA 15% hydrous ethanol and 85% gasoline blend, hE15, has been introduced at public gas stations in the Netherlands since 2008. Ethanol fuel specifications worldwide traditionally dictate use of anhydrous ethanol (less than 1% water) for gasoline blending. This results in additional costs, energy usage and environmental impacts associated with the extra processing step required to dehydrate the hydrous ethanol produced via distillation (3.5-4.9 vol.% water) to meet the current anhydrous ethanol specifications. A patented discovery reveals hydrous ethanol can be effectively used in most ethanol/gasoline blending applications.\nAccording to the Brazilian ANP specification, hydrous ethanol contains up to 4.9 vol.% water. In hE15, this would be up to 0.74 vol.% water in the overall mixture. Japanese and German scientific evidence revealed the water is an inhibitor for corrosion by ethanol.\nThe experiments show that water in fuel ethanol inhibits dry corrosion. At 10,000 ppm water in the E50 experiments by JARI and 3,500 ppm water in the E20 experiments by TU Darmstadt the alcoholate/alkoxide corrosion stopped. In the fuel ethanol this resembles 20,000 ppm or 2 volume% in the case of JARI and 5 x 3500 = 17,500 ppm of 1.75 volume% in the case of TU Darmstadt. The observations are in line with the fact that hydrous ethanol is known for being less corrosive than anhydrous ethanol. The reaction mechanism will be the same at lower-mid blends. When enough water is present in the fuel, the aluminum will react preferably with water to produce aluminum oxide, repairing the protective aluminum oxide layer, which is why the corrosion stops. The aluminum alcoholate/alkoxide does not make a tight oxide layer, which is why the corrosion continues. In other words, water is essential to repair the holes in the oxide layer. Based on the Japanese/German results, a minimum of 2 vol.% or 2.52% m/m water is currently proposed in the revision of the hydrous ethanol specification for blending in petrol at E10+ levels. Water injection has additional positive effects on the engine performance (thermodynamic efficiency) and reduces overall CO2 emissions.\nOverall, a transition from anhydrous to hydrous ethanol for gasoline blending is expected to make a significant contribution to ethanol's cost-competitiveness, fuel cycle net energy balance, air quality, and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe level of blending above 10% (V/V) is chosen both from a technical (safety) perspective and to distinguish the product in Europe from regular unleaded petrol for reasons of taxes and customer clarity. Small-scale tests have shown many vehicles with modern engine types can run smoothly on this hydrous ethanol blend. Mixed tanking scenarios with anhydrous ethanol blends at 5% or 10% level do not induce phase separation. As avoiding mixing with E0, in particular at extremely low temperatures, in logistic systems and engines is not recommended, a separate specification for controlled usage is presented in a Netherlands Technical Agreement NTA 8115. The NTA 8115 is written for a worldwide application in trading and fuel blending. \nE20 contains 20% ethanol and 80% gasoline, while E25 contains 25% ethanol. These blends have been widely used in Brazil since the late 1970s. As a response to the 1973 oil crisis, the Brazilian government made mandatory the blend of ethanol fuel with gasoline, fluctuating between 10% to 22% from 1976 until 1992. Due to this mandatory minimum gasoline blend, pure gasoline (E0) is no longer sold in Brazil. A federal law was passed in October 1993 establishing a mandatory blend of 22% anhydrous ethanol (E22) in the entire country. This law also authorized the Executive to set different percentages of ethanol within pre-established boundaries, and since 2003, these limits were fixed at a maximum of 25% (E25) and a minimum of 20% (E20) by volume. Since then, the government has set the percentage on the ethanol blend according to the results of the sugarcane harvest and ethanol production from sugarcane, resulting in blend variations even within the same year.\n\nSince July 1, 2007, the mandatory blend was set at 25% of anhydrous ethanol (E25) by executive decree, and this has been the standard gasoline blend sold throughout Brazil most of the time as of 2011. However, as a result of a supply shortage and the resulting high ethanol fuel prices, in 2010, the government mandated a temporary 90-day blend reduction from E25 to E20 beginning February 1, 2010. As prices rose abruptly again due to supply shortages that took place again between the 2010 and 2011 harvest seasons, some ethanol had to be imported from the United States, and in April 2011, the government reduced the minimum mandatory blend to 18%, leaving the mandatory blend range between E18 and E25.\n\nAll Brazilian automakers have adapted their gasoline engines to run smoothly with this range of mixtures, thus, all gasoline vehicles are built to run with blends from E20 to E25, defined by local law as \"common gasoline type C\". Some vehicles might work properly with lower concentrations of ethanol, but with a few exceptions, they are unable to run smoothly with pure gasoline, which causes engine knocking, as vehicles traveling to neighboring South American countries have demonstrated. Flex-fuel vehicles, which can run on any type of gasoline E20-E25 up to 100% hydrous ethanol (E100 or hydrated ethanol) ratios, were first available in mid-2003. In July 2008, 86% of all new light vehicles sold in Brazil were flexible-fuel, and only two carmakers build models with a flex-fuel engine optimized to operate with pure gasoline (E0): Renault with the models Clio, Symbol, Logan, Sandero and Mégane, and Fiat with the Siena Tetrafuel.\n\nThailand introduced E20 in 2008, but shortages in ethanol supplies by mid-2008 caused a delay in the expansion of the E20 fueling station network in the country. By mid-2010, 161 fueling stations were selling E20, and sales have risen 80% since April 2009. The rapid growth in E20 demand is because most vehicle models launched since 2009 were E20-compatible, and sales of E20 are expected to grow faster once more local automakers start producing small, E20-compatible, fuel-efficient cars. The Thai government is promoting ethanol usage through subsidies, as ethanol costs four baht a litre more than gasoline.\n\nA state law approved in Minnesota in 2005 mandated that ethanol comprise 20% of all gasoline sold in this American state beginning in 2013. Successful tests have been conducted to determine the performance under E20 by current vehicles and fuel dispensing equipment designed for E10. However, this mandate was later delayed to 2015, and has never taken effect because the federal EPA has yet to authorize the use of E20 as a replacement for gasoline.\n\nA study commissioned by BP and published in September 2013, concluded that the use of advanced biofuels in the UK, and particularly E20 cellulosic ethanol, is a more cost-effective way of reducing emissions than using plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) in the timeframe to 2030. The study also found that the use of higher blends of biofuels is complementary to hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs). Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) can deliver strong CO savings with a decarbonised electric grid, but are expected to have significantly higher costs than internal combustion engine vehicles and hybrid cars to 2030, as the latter are expected to be the most popular models by 2030. According to the study, in 2030 an E20 blend in an HEV can achieve a 10% emission savings compared to an HEV running on E5, for an annual fuel cost premium of compared to an annual cost of for an all-electric car.\n\nE70 contains 70% ethanol and 30% gasoline, while E75 contains 75% ethanol. These winter blends are used in the United States and Sweden for E85 flexible-fuel vehicles during the cold weather, but still sold at the pump labeled as E85. The seasonal reduction of the ethanol content to an E85 winter blend is mandated to avoid cold starting problems at low temperatures.\n\nIn the US, this seasonal reduction of the ethanol content to E70 applies only in cold regions, where temperatures fall below during the winter. In Wyoming for example, E70 is sold as E85 from October to May. In Sweden, all E85 flexible-fuel vehicles use an E75 winter blend. This blend was introduced since the winter 2006-07 and E75 is used from November until March.\n\nFor temperatures below , all E85 flex vehicles require an engine block heater to avoid cold starting problems. The use of this device is also recommended for gasoline vehicles when temperatures drop below . Another option when extreme cold weather is expected is to add more pure gasoline in the tank, thus reducing the ethanol content below the E70 winter blend, or simply not to use E85 during extreme low temperature spells.\n\nE85, a mixture of 85% ethanol and ~15% gasoline, is generally the highest ethanol fuel mixture found in the United States and several European countries, particularly in Sweden, as this blend is the standard fuel for flexible-fuel vehicles. This mixture has an octane rating of 108, however, the Ethanol molecule also carries with it an Oxygen atom, -where-as Octane (A.K.A Gasoline) does not carry an Oxygen atom- effectively requiring the internal combustion engine to ingest less air per unit-volume by its own accord, which reduces pumping losses, and further increases the exo-thermic chemical reaction. Ethanol fuel is considered – although not widely known as – a form of \"chemical supercharging\", similar to that of Nitrous Oxide (N2O) & Nitromethane (CH3NO2).\n\nThe 85% limit in the ethanol content was set to reduce ethanol emissions at low temperatures and to avoid cold starting problems during cold weather, at temperatures lower than . A further reduction in the ethanol content is used during the winter in regions where temperatures fall below and this blend is called Winter E85, as the fuel is still sold under the E85 label. A winter blend of E70 is mandated in some regions in the US, while Sweden mandates E75. Some regions in the United States now allow E51 (51% ethanol, 49% gasoline) to be sold as E85 in the winter months.\n\nAs of October 2010, nearly 3,000 E85 fuel pumps were in Europe, led by Sweden with 1,699 filling stations. The United States had 3,354 public E85 fuel pumps located in 2,154 cities by August 2014, mostly concentrated in the Midwest.\n\nThailand introduced E85 fuel by the end of 2008, and by mid-2010, only four E85 filling stations were available, with plans to expand to 15 stations by 2012.\nA major restriction hampering sales of E85 flex vehicles or fuelling with E85, is the limited infrastructure available to sell E85 to the public, as by 2014 only 2 percent of motor fuel stations offered E85, up from about 1 percent in 2011. , there were only 3,218 gasoline fueling stations selling E85 to the public in the entire U.S., while about 156,000 retail motor fuel outlets do not offer the E85 blend. The number of E85 grew from 1,229 in 2007 to 2,442 in 2011, but only increased by 7% from 2011 to 2013, when the total reached 2,625. There is a great concentration of E85 stations in the Corn Belt states, and , the leading state is Minnesota with 274 stations, followed by Michigan with 231, Illinois with 225, Iowa with 204, Indiana with 188, Texas with 181, Wisconsin with 152, and Ohio with 126. Only eight states do not have E85 available to the public, Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Montana, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont. The main constraint for a more rapid expansion of E85 availability is that it requires dedicated storage tanks at filling stations, at an estimated cost of for each dedicated ethanol tank. A study conducted by the U.S. Department of Energy concluded that every service station in America could be converted to handle E85 at a cost of $3.4 billion to $10.1 billion.\n\nED95 designates a blend of 95% ethanol and 5% ignition improver; it is used in modified diesel engines where high compression is used to ignite the fuel, as opposed to the operation of gasoline engines, where spark plugs are used. This fuel was developed by Swedish ethanol producer SEKAB. Because of the high ignition temperatures of pure ethanol, the addition of ignition improver is necessary for successful diesel engine operation. A diesel engine running on ethanol also has a higher compression ratio and an adapted fuel system.\n\nThis fuel has been used with success in many Swedish Scania buses since 1985, which has produced around 700 ethanol buses, more than 600 of them to Swedish cities, and more recently has also delivered ethanol buses for commercial service in Great Britain, Spain, Italy, Belgium, and Norway. As of June 2010 Stockholm has the largest ethanol ED95 bus fleet in the world.\n\nAs of 2010, the Swedish ED95 engine is in its third generation and already has complied with , without any kind of post-treatment of the exhaust gases. The ethanol-powered engine is also being certified as environmentally enhanced vehicle (EEV) in the Stockholm municipality. The EEV rule still has no date to enter into force in Europe and is stricter than the Euro 5 standard.\n\nNottingham became the first city in England to operate a regular bus service with ethanol-fueled vehicles. Three ED95 single-deck buses entered regular service in the city in March 2008. Soon after, Reading also introduced ED95 double-deck buses.\n\nUnder the auspices of the BioEthanol for Sustainable Transport project, more than 138 bioethanol ED95 buses were part of demonstration trial at four cities, three in Europe, and one in Brazil, between 2006 and 2009. A total of 127 ED95 buses operated in Stockholm, five buses operated in Madrid, three in La Spezia, and one in Brazil.\nIn Brazil, the first Scania ED95 bus with a modified diesel engine was introduced as a trial in São Paulo city in December 2007, and since November 2009, two ED95 buses were in regular service. The Brazilian trial project ran for three years and performance and emissions were monitored by the National Reference Center on Biomass (CENBIO- ) at the Universidade de São Paulo.\n\nIn November 2010, the municipal government of São Paulo city signed an agreement with UNICA, Cosan, Scania and \"Viação Metropolitana\", a local bus operator, to introduced a fleet of 50 ethanol-powered ED95 buses by May 2011. Scania manufactures the bus engine and chassis in its plant located in São Bernardo do Campo, São Paulo, using the same technology and fuel as the ED95 buses already operating in Stockholm. The bus body is a Brazilian CAIO. The first ethanol-powered buses were delivered in May 2011, and the 50 buses will start regular service in June 2011 in the southern region of São Paulo. The 50 ED95 buses had a cost of R$ 20 million () and due to the higher cost of the ED95 fuel and the lower energy content of ethanol as compared to diesel, one of the firms participating in the cooperation agreement, Raísen (a joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell and Cosan), supplies the fuel to the municipality at 70% of the market price of regular diesel.\n\nE100 is pure ethanol fuel. Straight hydrous ethanol as an automotive fuel has been widely used in Brazil since the late 1970s for neat ethanol vehicles and more recently for flexible-fuel vehicles. The ethanol fuel used in Brazil is distilled close to the azeotrope mixture of 95.63% ethanol and 4.37% water (by weight) which is approximately 3.5% water by volume.\nThe azeotrope is the highest concentration of ethanol that can be achieved by simple fractional distillation. The maximum water concentration according to the ANP specification is 4.9 vol.% (approximately 6.1 weight%) The E nomenclature is not adopted in Brazil, but hydrated ethanol can be tagged as E100, meaning it does not have any gasoline, because the water content is not an additive, but rather a residue from the distillation process. However, straight hydrous ethanol is also called E95 by some authors.\n\nThe first commercial vehicle capable of running on pure ethanol was the Ford Model T, produced from 1908 through 1927. It was fitted with a carburetor with adjustable jetting, allowing use of gasoline or ethanol, or a combination of both. At that time, other car manufacturers also provided engines for ethanol fuel use. Thereafter, and as a response to the 1973 and 1979 energy crises, the first modern vehicle capable of running with pure hydrous ethanol (E100) was launched in the Brazilian market, the Fiat 147, after testing with several prototypes developed by the Brazilian subsidiaries of Fiat, Volkswagen, General Motors and Ford. , there were 1.1 million neat ethanol vehicles still in use in Brazil. Since 2003, Brazilian newer flex-fuel vehicles are capable of running on pure hydrous ethanol (E100) or blended with any combination of E20 to E27.5 gasoline (a mixture made with anhydrous ethanol), the national mandatory blend. , there were 17.1 million flexible-fuel vehicles running on Brazilian roads.\n\nE100 imposes a limitation on normal vehicle operation, as ethanol's lower evaporative pressure (as compared to gasoline) causes problems when cold starting the engine at temperatures below . For this reason, both pure ethanol and E100 flex-fuel vehicles are built with an additional small gasoline reservoir inside the engine compartment to help in starting the engine when cold by initially injecting gasoline. Once started, the engine is then switched back to ethanol. An improved flex-fuel engine generation was developed to eliminate the need for the secondary gas tank by warming the ethanol fuel during starting, and allowing them to start at temperatures as low as , the lowest temperature expected anywhere in the Brazilian territory. The Polo E-Flex, launched in March 2009, was the first flex-fuel model without an auxiliary tank for cold start. The warming system, called Flex Start, was developed by Robert Bosch GmbH.\n\nSwedish carmakers have developed ethanol-only capable engines for the new Saab Aero X BioPower 100 Concept E100, with a V6 engine which is fuelled entirely by E100 bioethanol, and the limited edition of the Koenigsegg CCXR, a version of the CCX converted to use E85 or E100, as well as standard 98-octane gasoline, and currently the fastest and most powerful flex-fuel vehicle with its twin-supercharged V8 producing 1018 hp when running on biofuel, as compared to 806 hp on 91-octane unleaded gasoline.\n\nThe higher fuel efficiency of E100 (compared to methanol) in high performance race cars resulted in Indianapolis 500 races in 2007 and 2008 being run on 100% fuel-grade ethanol.\n\nThe use of ethanol blends in conventional gasoline vehicles is restricted to low mixtures, as ethanol is corrosive and can degrade some of the materials in the engine and fuel system. Also, the engine has to be adjusted for a higher compression ratio as compared to a pure gasoline engine to take advantage of ethanol's higher oxygen content, thus allowing an improvement in fuel efficiency and a reduction of tailpipe emissions. The following table shows the required modifications to gasoline engines to run smoothly and without degrading any materials. This information is based on the modifications made by the Brazilian automotive industry at the beginning of the ethanol program in that country in the late 1970s, and reflects the experience of Volkswagen do Brasil.\n\nDisadvantages to ethanol fuel blends when used in engines designed exclusively for gasoline include lowered fuel mileage, metal corrosion, deterioration of plastic and rubber fuel system components, clogged fuel systems, fuel injectors, and carburetors, delamination of composite fuel tanks, varnish buildup on engine parts, damaged or destroyed internal engine components, water absorption, fuel phase separation, and shortened fuel storage life. Many major auto, marine, motorcycle, lawn equipment, generator, and other internal combustion engine manufacturers have issued warnings and precautions about the use of ethanol-blended gasolines of any type in their engines, and the Federal Aviation Administration and major aviation engine manufacturers have prohibited the use of automotive gasolines blended with ethanol in light aircraft due to safety issues from fuel system and engine damage.\n\n\n"}

Instead of being emptied into a bin lorry on site, as a wheelie bin is, a skip is removed, or replaced by an empty skip, and then tipped at a landfill site or transfer station (waste management).\n\nTypically skip bins (skips) have a distinctive shape: the longitudinal cross-section of the skip bin is either a trapezoid or two stacked trapezoids. The lower trapezoid has the smaller edge at the bottom of the skip bin, and a longer edge at the top. The smaller edge on either end is lower which makes it easier to load. Where there is an upper trapezoid, it has the smaller edge at the top. At either end of the skip bin there is a sloping floor or wall. There are usually two lugs on each side of the bin onto which chains can be attached, permitting the heavy skip bin to be lifted onto and off a Skip lorry. A special skip-carrying lorry or crane is used.\n\nOne end of the skip sometimes has a large door that hinges down to allow manual loading and unloading, these Skips are called 'Drop Door Skips'. Skips are usually durable and tough, made to withstand rough use by tradespeople and labourers. The size of skip bins can vary greatly depending on their use, with sizes ranging from small 2 yard mini skips to the very large 40 yard roll-on roll-off skips. Even though these large bins can store many tonnes of waste, most lorries are limited to carrying around of material in the container.\n\nA typical small skip, when empty, weighs about .\n\nThere are several types of skip containers:\n\n\nSkips are commonly used to hold open-topped loads of construction and demolition waste, garden waste or other waste and litter types. The construction debris may originate from a building, renovation, or demolition site; building supplies can be delivered to a site in a skip that is later used to remove waste. Skips are also used for various cleaning-out jobs that need much material to be taken away, and at factories producing large quantities of scrap metal. The material in the skip may be taken to a landfill, recycled or recovered/disposed of in some other way. There are wide range of uses of skip bins including construction building, home renovations, handyman maintenance or repair projects, garden or green clean up.\n\nSkip hire companies typically print 'level fill' on the sides of skips to instruct users that the contents should not fill or have contents showing above the height of the sides of the skip. This is in part for safety so that contents do not fall out posing a risk to passers-by, and is also aimed at maximising revenue for the skip hire company. Many tradesmen and builders will make use of what are termed 'greedy boards', old doors and other scrap sheet based material, to artificially heighten the sides of the skip and thus get more value for money for tradesmen or builders. If they do that, the skip bin hire provider will charge them an extra fee as the skip will be overloaded.\n\n2 yard – Mini Skip \n<br>\n\n4 yard – Midi Skip \n<br>\n\n6 Yard – Builders Skip\n<br>\n\n8 Yard – Large Builders Skip\n<br>\n\nThe origins of calling a rubbish cart a skip (most often found in Australia, New Zealand and the UK) come from the word 'skep', used to refer to a basket. 'Skep' itself comes from the Late Old English \"\", from the Old Norse 'basket'.. While the first recorded use of a rubbish skip dates back to 1922, the practice of using skips to dispose of residential and commercial waste became mainstream over the following century, culminating in the modern skip waste disposal system that is used today.\n"}

It is situated between the towns of Aalten and Winterswijk.\n\nBredevoort has presented itself as \"Bredevoort boekenstad\" (\"Bredevoort book town\"), after the examples of Hay-on-Wye in Wales and Redu in Belgium. There are now more than twenty second-hand book shops in the town.\n\nBredevoort was a herrschaft and a separate municipality until 1818. The villages Aalten, Dinxperlo and Winterswijk included the Fiefdom of Bredevoort when it became a part of Aalten in 1818.\n\nThe name Bredevoort appears for the first time on a list of properties belonging to the archbishop of Cologne in 1188, who owned shares of the castle Bredevoort. When the count of Steinfurt tried to sell his share of the castle to the bishop of Munster and the count of Loon tried to sell his share to the count of Gelderland, a conflict broke out between the bishop and the count of Gelderland. The fight lasted for almost two centuries.\n\nFrom 1326, after 4 years of battle between Reginald II, Duke of Guelders and the Prince-Bishopric of Münster Bredevoort was actual part of Gelderland. Between 1326 and 1697 the municipality of Bredevoort repeatedly changed ownership. The former municipality of Bredevoort was composed of the city, the castle Bredevoort, and the villages Aalten, Dinxperlo and Winterswijk. Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange conquered Bredevoort in the year 1597 on the Spanish occupation. The Spanish reconquered the city in 1606, but Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange liberated the garrison and citizens who had retreated in the Castle of Bredevoort. In 1646, lightning hit the gunpowder tower of the castle, causing an explosion that destroyed parts of the castle and the town, killing Lord Haersolte of Bredevoort and his family, as well as others. Only one son, Anthonie, who was not home that day, survived. In the \"rampjaar\" (\"disaster year\") 1672 Bernhard von Galen reconquered the city and occupied city and herrschaft for almost two years. In 1697 received William III of England the city and herrschaft from the States of Gelderland. From that day until 1795 the city and herrschaft was a personal belonging to the House of Orange-Nassau. King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands is still Lord of Bredevoort. After centuries of war, its fortifications were demolished by its inhabitants. In 1818, the municipality of Bredevoort was dissolved to become part of the city Bredevoort under the newly formed municipality Aalten.\n\n\nAalten railway station is the nearest station.

{"id": "2155325", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2155325", "title": "Northern Italy", "text": "Northern Italy\n\nNorthern Italy ( or just ) is a geographical and cultural region in the northern part of Italy. Non-administrative, it consists of eight administrative Regions in northern Italy: Aosta Valley, Piedmont, Liguria, Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol. As of 2014, its population was 27,801,460. Rhaeto-Romance and Gallo-Italic languages are spoken in the region, as opposed to the Italo-Dalmatian languages spoken in the rest of Italy (while the Venetian language may be considered by some to be part of the Italo-Dalmatian languages; it is important to note that major publications such as Ethnologue (to which UNESCO refers on its page about endangered languages) and Glottolog define it as Gallo-Italic).\n\nFor statistic purposes, the Istituto Nazionale di Statistica (ISTAT) uses the terms Northwest Italy and Northeast Italy for two of Italy's five statistical regions in its reporting. These same subdivisions are used to demarcate first-level Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) regions (\"NUTS 1 regions\") within the European Union, and the Italian constituencies for the European Parliament.\n\nNorthern Italy was called by different terms in different periods of history. During ancient times the terms Gallia Cisalpina, Gallia Citerior or Gallia Togata were used to define that part of Italy inhabited by Celts (Gauls) during the 4th and 3rd centuries BC. Conquered by the Roman Republic in the 220s BC, it was a Roman province from c. 81 BC until 42 BC, when it was merged into Roman Italy. Until that time, it was considered part of Gaul, precisely that part of Gaul on the \"hither side of the Alps\" (from the perspective of the Romans), as opposed to Transalpine Gaul (\"on the far side of the Alps\").\n\nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire and the settlement of the Lombards the name Langobardia Maior was used, in the Early Middle Ages, to define the domains of the Lombard Kingdom in Northern Italy. The Lombard territories beyond were called Langobardia Minor, consisting of the duchies of Spoleto and Benevento.\n\nDuring the Late Middle Ages, after the fall of the northern part of the Lombard Kingdom to Charlemagne, the term Longobardia was used to mean Northern Italy within the medieval Kingdom of Italy. As the area became partitioned in regional states the term Lombardy subsequentially shifted to indicate only the area of the Duchies of Milan, Mantua, Parma and Modena and later only to the area around Milan.\n\nIn late modern period the term \"Alta Italia\" ('High Italy') was widely used, for example by the Comitato di Liberazione Nazionale Alta Italia during the second World War. Starting from the 1960s the term \"Padania\" was sometimes used as geographical synonym of Po Valley. The term appeared sparingly until the early 1990s, when Lega Nord, a federalist and, at times, separatist political party in Italy, proposed \"Padania\" as a possible name for an independent state in Northern Italy. Since then, it has carried strong political connotations.\n\nIn pre-Roman centuries it was inhabited by different peoples among whom the Ligures, the ancient Veneti, who prospered through their trade in amber and breeding of horses, the Etruscans, who colonized Northern Italy from Tuscany, founded the city of Bologna and spread the use of writing; later, starting from the 5th century BC, the area was invaded by Celtic – Gallic tribes. These people founded several cities like Turin and Milan and extended their rule from the Alps to the Adriatic Sea.\nTheir development was halted by the Roman expansion in the Po Valley from the 3rd century BC onwards. After centuries of struggle, in 194 BC the entire area of what is now Northern Italy became a Roman province with the name of Gallia Cisalpina (\"Gaul on the inner side (with respect to Rome) of the Alps\").\nThe Roman culture and language overwhelmed the former civilization in the following years, and Northern Italy became one of the most developed and rich areas of the western half of the empire with the construction of a wide array of roads and the development of agriculture and trade.\n\nIn late antiquity the strategic role of Northern Italy was emphasized by the moving of the capital of the Western Empire from Rome to Mediolanum in 286 and later to Ravenna from 402 until the empire collapsed in 476.\n\nAfter the fall of the Western Empire, Northern Italy suffered heavily from destruction brought about by migration from Germanic peoples and from the Gothic War. In the 570s the Germanic Lombards, or Longobardi, entered Northern Italy from Friuli and founded a long-lasting reign (with its capital in Pavia) that gave the medieval name to the whole Northern Italy and the current name to the Lombardy region. \nAfter the initial struggles, relationships between the Lombard people and the Latin-speaking people improved. In the end, the Lombard language and culture assimilated with the Latin culture, leaving evidence in many names, the legal code and laws, and other things. The end of Lombard rule came in 774, when the Frankish king Charlemagne conquered Pavia, deposed Desiderius, the last Lombard king, and annexed the Lombard Kingdom to his empire changing the name in Kingdom of Italy. The former Lombard dukes were mostly replaced by Frankish counts, prince-bishops or marquises.\n\nIn the 10th century Northern Italy was formally under the rule of the Holy Roman Empire but was in fact divided in a multiplicity of small, autonomous city-states, the medieval communes and maritime republic. The 11th century marked a significant boom in Northern Italy's economy, due to improved trading and agricultural innovations, culture flourished as well with many universities founded, among them the University of Bologna, the oldest university in Europe. \nThe increasing richness of the city-states made them able to defy the traditional feudal supreme power, represented by the German emperors and their local vassals. This process led to the creation of different Lombard Leagues formed by allied cities of Lombardy that defeated the Hohenstaufen Emperor Frederick I, at Legnano, and his grandson Frederick II, at Parma, and becoming virtually independent from the German emperors. \nThe Leagues failed to develop from an alliance to a lasting confederation and subsequently, among the various local city-states, a process of consolidation took place; most of them became lordships ruled by powerful families like the Della Scala of Verona or the Visconti of Milan, and conquered neighboring cities threatening to unify Northern Italy under a single state. In the end a balance of power was reached in 1454 with the Peace of Lodi and Northern Italy ended up divided between a small number of regional states, the most powerful were the Duchies of Savoy, Milan, Mantua, Ferrara and the Republics of Genoa and Venice, which had begun to extend its influence in the mainland from the 14th century onwards.\n\nIn the 15th century Northern Italy became one of the centres of the Renaissance whose culture and works of art were highly regarded. The enterprising class of the communes extended its trade and banking activities well into northern Europe and \"Lombards\", the term that designated the merchants or bankers coming from northern Italy, were present in all of Europe.\nThe Italian Wars between 1494 and 1559 ended the North Italian Renaissance and brought the region to be fought between France and the Spanish and Austrian House of Habsburg. After the war Northern Italy became under direct or indirect control of Spain.\nAt the same time Ottoman control of the eastern Mediterranean and the discoveries of sea routes to Asia around Africa and of the Americas led to the decline of the Venetian Republic.\n\nPestilences, like that of 1628/1630, and the generally declining conditions of Italy's economy in the 17th and 18th centuries halted the further development of Northern Italy. The only polity that managed to thrive in this period was the Savoy's state which, thanks to military and diplomatic victories in 1720, managed to acquire the island of Sardinia, through which the then Dukes gained legitimacy as a proper Kingdom and increased Turin's importance as a European capital.\n\nAfter the French Revolution in the late 18th century Northern Italy was conquered by the French armies, many client republics were created by Napoleon and in 1805 a new Kingdom of Italy, made of all of Northern Italy but Piedmont that was annexed to France, was established with Milan as capital and Napoleon as head of state.\nIn the congress of Vienna, the Kingdom of Sardinia was restored, and furthermore enlarged by annexing the Republic of Genoa to strengthen it as a barrier against France. The rest of Northern Italy was under Austrian rule, either direct like in the Lombardo-Venetian Kingdom or indirect like in the Duchies of Parma and Modena. Bologna and Romagna were given to the Papal State.\nThe Austrian imperial government was unpopular because of their anti-liberal politics and Northern Italy became the intellectual centre leading the Italian unification process. Piedmont and the Kingdom of Sardinia, in particular, was the state that launched Italy's unification in 1859–1861. After defeating the Austrians in 1859 and annexing Northern Italy the new state proceeded to launch a campaign to conquer Southern and Central Italy and Turin briefly became the capital of the almost whole of Italy.\n\nAfter Italian unification the capital was moved from Turin to Rome and the administrative and institutional importance of Northern Italy was deeply reduced. However, from the late 19th century and especially with the economic boom of the 1950s–1960s, Northern Italy and especially the cities of Turin, Genoa, and Milan was the most important region in the Italian industrialization and sharpened its status of richest and most industrialized part of Italy.\nBetween 1943 and 1945, during the Second World War, Northern Italy was part of the Fascist Italian Social Republic and the main theatre of the anti-fascist partisan activity. Between April 19 and 25, 1945 the cities of Northern Italy began an insurrection against Fascist and Nazist forces that led to the liberation of Northern Italy by Allied forces \nEconomic differences between Northern Italy and the rest of the country, as well as the short history of Italy as a single nation, led in the 1990s to the emergence of Padanian nationalism, as Lega Nord promoted either secession or larger autonomy for Padania, the name chosen to represent Northern Italy.\n\nNorthern Italy is made of the basin of the River Po, which comprises the whole of the broad plain extending from the foot of the Apennines to that of the Alps, together with the valleys and slopes on both sides of it, the Venetian Plain and the Ligurian coast.\nNorthern Italy has the Alps as northern and western boundary and the Apennine Mountains as the southern one. In between the two mountain ranges lies a large plain made of the Venetian Plain and the valley of the Po, the largest river in Italy, which flows 652 km eastward from the Cottian Alps to the Adriatic Sea and receives all the waters that flow from the Apennines northwards, and all those that descend from the Alps towards the south. The Po Valley is the largest plain in Italy and held the vast majority of North Italian population.\n\nThe Alps are home to some worldwide-known mountains like the Matterhorn (Cervino), Monte Rosa, Gran Paradiso in the eastern Alps, and Bernina, Stelvio and Dolomites along the eastern side of the Alps. The highest peak in Europe is Mont Blanc, at 4,810 meters above sea level, located at the border with France.\n\nWith the exception of Liguria all of Northern Italy lies in the drainage basin of the Adriatic Sea (with rivers Po, Piave, Adige, Brenta, Tagliamento, Reno) though the waters from some border municipalities (Livigno in Lombardy, Innichen and Sexten in Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol) drain into the Black Sea through the basin of the Danube, and the waters from the Lago di Lei in Lombardy drain into the North Sea through the basin of the Rhine.\n\nOn the foothills of the Alps there are a number of subalpine moraine-dammed lakes, the largest of which is Garda. Other well known of these subalpine lakes are Lake Maggiore, whose most northerly section is part of Switzerland, Como, Orta, Lugano, Iseo, Idro.\n\nThe climate of Northern Italy is mainly humid subtropical (Köppen Cfa), especially in the plains. Winter in Northern Italy is normally long, relatively dry and rather cold. In addition, there is a high seasonal temperature variation between Summer and Winter. In the hills and mountains, the climate is humid continental (Köppen Dfb). In the valleys it is cold but usually with low humidity, while it can be severely cold above 1,000 mt, with copious snowfalls. The coastal areas of Liguria generally fit the Mediterranean climate profile. In the Alpine foothills, characterised by an Oceanic climate (Köppen Cfb), numerous lakes exercise a mitigating influence, allowing the cultivation of typically Mediterranean crops (olives, citrus fruit).\n\nA peculiarity of the regional climate is the thick fog that covers the plains between October and February, especially in the central Po Plain. The east coast, from Romagna to Trieste is occasionally affected by the cold bora winds in winter and spring.\n\nThe coldest month is January: the Po valley's mean temperature is between −1 and +1 °C. Winter morning lows can occasionally reach −30 to −20 °C in the Alps and −14 to −8 °C in the Po valley, with records close to -30°C near Bologna is some of the coldest winters. Summer is usually more stable, althought quite stormy near the Alps, with July temperatures are 22–24 °C north of river Po, like in Milan or Venice, and south of river Po can reach 24–25 °C like in Bologna.\n\nwhile the number of days with lows below 0 °C is usually from 60 to 90 a year, with peaks of 100–110 days in the mainly rural zones. In the colder winters, the Venice Lagoon may freeze, and in the coldest ones even enough to walk on the ice sheet.\n\nPrecipitation evenly distributed during the year, although the summer is usually slightly wetter. is more intense in the Prealpine zone, up to 1,500 to 2,000 mm annually, but is abundant also in the plains and Alpine zones, with an average of 600 to 850 mm annually. The total annual rainfall is on average 827 mm. Regione Lombardia. Retrieved 21 July 2015.\nSnow is quite common between early December and early March in cities like Turin, Milan and Bologna, but sometime it appears in late November or late March and even April. Both the Alps and the Apennine can see up to 500–1,000 cm of snow in a year at 2,000 m; on the highest peaks of the Alps, snow may fall even during mid summer, and glaciers are present.\n\nBecause of high industrialization and the lack of wind due to being closed between mountain ranges air pollution remains a severe problem in Northern Italy. Even if smog levels have decreased dramatically since the 1970s and 1980s, in 2005 a team of researchers at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute reported that Northern Italy was one of Europe's most polluted areas in terms of smog and air pollution due to its climatic and geographic conditions, which cause the stagnation of pollutants.\n\nNorthern Italy is dominated by the Gallo-Italic family of languages, as opposed to the rest of the country where the Italo-Romance languages are spoken, and they include Emilian, Ligurian, Lombard, Piedmontese, and Romagnol. Venetian is considered to be part of the Gallo-Italic group, but it also shares some traits with Italo-Dalmatian.\n\nThe Gallo-Italic languages also reach the north of the Marche region in central Italy (province of Pesaro and Urbino and the city of Senigallia in province of Ancona) and Tuscany (most of the province of Massa-Carrara and the northernmost areas of Garfagnana in the province of Lucca), so these areas are considered linguistically part of northern Italy.\n\nOther Gallo-Romance languages spoken are Occitan, Arpitan spoken in the Occitan and Arpitan valleys in western Piedmont, and the Rhaeto-Romance group which includes Friulian and Ladin.\n\nNon-Romance languages are also spoken: Germanic languages such as \"standard\" German and Bavarian in South Tyrol, small Walser communities in Piedmont and Valle d'Aosta, and Cimbrian and mochenoin Veneto, Friuli and Trentino. Slavic languages are spoken in Friuli-Venezia Giulia: there are Slovenian minorities in the province of Trieste and in the eastern parts of those of Udine and Gorizia.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, mainly between the thirteenth and fifteenth centuries, an illustrious vulgar was in use, by the name of \"Lombard-Venetian koinè\". In medieval sources it was simply called \"written language\" or Lombard, because the toponym \"Lombardy\" was then used to indicate the entire region of northern Italy.\n\nStarting from the fifteenth century, the Lombard-Venetian koiné began to give ground with respect to the Tuscan, a phenomenon that Tagliavini describes as follows: \"Florentine, thanks to (Dante) and other great Tuscans like Petrarch and Boccaccio, to the central position of Florence and to the historical conditions of the time, gradually spread throughout Italy, also resulting in the disappearance of the High-Italian κοινή, which in the thirteenth century had risen to a certain prestige\".\n\nThis literary koiné manifested itself with authors such as Bonvesin de la Riva, Giacomino da Verona, Uguccione da Lodi, Girardo Patecchio, etc..\n\nNorthern Italy is the most developed and productive area of the country, with one of the highest GDPs per capita in Europe. It was the first part of Italy to become industrialised in the last half of the 19th century; the so-called \"industrial triangle\" was formed by the manufacturing centres of Milan and Turin, as well as the seaport of Genoa. Since then, the industrial core of the area has shifted eastward; the current industrial triangle consists of Lombardy, Veneto, and Emilia-Romagna. A similar shift happened for GDP per capita, and the eastern regions (including Lombardy) have since become wealthier than Piedmont and Liguria. With a 2008 nominal GDP estimated at €772,676 million, Northern Italy accounts for 54.8% of the Italian economy, despite having just 45.8% of the population.\n\nThe most populous cities (with over 100,000 inhabitants) as of December 31, 2016, estimates were:\nAosta Valley, Piedmont, Veneto, Trentino Alto-Adige, Liguria, Friuli-Venezia-Giulia and Lombardy are known as the Alpine regions of Italy, consisting of all of North Italy except for Emilia-Romagna.\n\n"}

It is also located 7 (11.4 km) north of Pescadero via Stage Road and 8 miles (12.8 km) west of La Honda via SR 84.\n\nSan Gregorio has a cool summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification Csb).\n\nA National Weather Service cooperative weather station has been in operation in San Gregorio since June 1, 1954. San Gregorio enjoys mild weather throughout the year, except for some remarkably chilly mornings, even in the summer. Fog and low overcast are common in the night and morning hours, too, especially in the summer. The fog usually clears to the shoreline by the afternoon. Temperatures are often much warmer just a few miles inland than on the coast. Most of the rainfall falls from November through April.\n\nNormal annual precipitation is 29.52 inches (74.98 cm). San Gregorio has an average of 92.3 days with measurable rain. The wettest year on record was 1983 when 57.86 inches (146.96 cm) of rain fell.

Franciscan missionary Juan Crespi noted in his diary, \"This is a fine place, with good lands and an abundance of water, where a good mission could be placed\". No mission was ever established here, however. The string of Spanish Missions established over the next 50 years followed a more inland route through San Jose. During the Mexican era, the area was part of Rancho San Gregoria.\nNamed after Pope Gregory I (Saint Gregory the Great). San Gregorio was a booming town in the 1850s, when wealthy San Franciscans would travel to the San Gregorio House by stagecoach to enjoy fishing, hunting, sea bathing, and boat races. The building still stands, but is no longer a functioning hotel. In the nineteenth century, a Chinese community had lived along the creek which runs through San Gregorio however, the buildings of the former community were washed away due to heavy rains. The San Gregorio General Store has been operating since 1889. The original stagecoach stop stands across Highway 84 from the store. In 1915, the community was home to seven cheese factories. San Gregorio has been the site of several film locations and television show episode scenes.\n\n"}

{"id": "2155335", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2155335", "title": "Puttershoek", "text": "Puttershoek\n\nPuttershoek is a town and former municipality in the western Netherlands. It is located on the banks of the Oude Maas, on the island Hoeksche Waard, in the province of South Holland. On January 1, 1984, the municipality of Puttershoek was merged with several others into Binnenmaas. With 6,293 inhabitants (1 January 2005) Puttershoek was the largest settlement in the municipality of Binnenmaas until 's-Gravendeel joined Binnenmaas in 2007.\n\nBefore the St. Elizabeth's flood (1421) a township named \"Hoecke\" was located on the spot of the present-day town. The name \"Hoecke\" (meaning \"Corner\") is probably derived from the sharp angle the dike around the former Grote or Zuid-Hollandsche Waard island took here. After the St. Elizabeth's flood, the land was owned by the Lords of Putten, who loaned it to a vassal lord. The first four vassal lords of \"Hoecke\" were all named \"Pieter\". It remains unclear if the name \"Puttershoek\" is taken from Pietershoeck, or if it is a reference to the Lords of Putten.\n\nUntil the 19th century, Puttershoek was a small and remote village, where reed cutting was the main source of income. However, in 1912 a large sugar beet processing plant was built in the village, bringing not only employment and a sweet odour during fall, but also employees from the Catholic North Brabant province. A thriving Catholic community was founded in the very Protestant village, building one of only two Catholic churches on the Hoeksche Waard island. During World War II, V-1 missiles were launched from the factory by the German occupying forces. The factory was bombed, and was rebuilt after the war. At the end of 2004, the sugar mill closed its doors. Most of its buildings were demolished in 2012.\n\nPuttershoek was partially flooded during the big North Sea flood of 1953. After the flood the dike along the Oude Maas was raised. For this, nearly half of the old town (the Weverseinde dike) was torn down between 1964 and 1966. The monumental 17th-century farm \"Rustenburg\" burnt down in 1997 and was demolished.\n\nPuttershoek retains several recognised architectural monuments, most of which are concentrated around the small river harbour on the Oude Maas and the Schouteneinde dike. The Protestant church was built in 1839, replacing a 15th-century church in the same location. Part of the church tower and the interior date back to the previous structure. The former town hall was built in 1835 in the neoclassicist style. The port is lined with 17th-century houses with characteristic gables. The old post office \"Het Springende Peerd\", with stepped gable and gable stone, dates from 1648. There are several large 18th- and 19th-century farms along the Arent van Lierstraat. The windmill \"De Lelie\", on the Molendijk towards 's-Gravendeel, was built in 1836 and renovated in 1986. In the lower part of town there are several wooden houses, donated by the Norwegian government after World War II. The old pumping station \"Het Hooft van Benthuizen\" was built in 1870 for drainage of the polder Nieuw-Bonaventura and the canal Boezemvliet. It is due to be demolished, to make way for housing development.\n\nThe most renowned inhabitant is Kees Verkerk who won many speed skating medals including a gold medal in the 1968 Winter Olympics. Presently, Verkerk lives in Norway, but his house still hosts the cafe and bar his father owned for many years, \"Het Veerhuis\", found at the harbour-side.\n"}

The NSW RFS is the primary agency for responding to bushfires in the state. In addition, they respond to structural fires, vehicle fires, motor vehicle accidents and wide range of other emergencies, as well as providing preventative advice to local communities.\n\nThe NSW RFS is the world's largest volunteer fire service, with 72,491 volunteer members, although this figure includes many inactive volunteer firefighters and all support volunteers. They are organised into 2,002 brigades (local units). , the service employed 911 paid staff who fulfill senior operational management and administrative roles. The agency attends to approximately 27,000 incidents per annum.\n\nThe agency is led by its Commissioner, presently Rob Rogers, who reports to the Minister for Police and Emergency Services, currently the Hon. David Elliott MP.\n\nMore than 100 years ago, the residents of the small town of in south west New South Wales, banded together as firefighters to protect their community against the ever-present threat of bush fires. They were Australia's first official bush fire brigade.\n\nPrior to 1997, bushfire fighting services in New South Wales were essentially a patchwork of more than 200 separate fire fighting agencies working under a loose umbrella with no single chain of command. The core of the service, then as now, was the volunteer brigades that were organised along council district lines under the command of a locally appointed Fire Control Officer. Fire fighting efforts were funded by the Bush Fire Fighting Fund, established in 1949 and financed by insurance companies, local council and the State Government. A variety of State-run committees and councils oversaw bush fire operations with members drawn from various Government fire fighting agencies and council and volunteer representatives. These groups developed legislation and techniques but in the main responsibility for bushfire management was vested in individual local councils in dedicated bush fire areas as determined under the 1909 Fire Brigades Act. This Act proclaimed the areas serviced by the Board of Fire Commissioners (now Fire and Rescue NSW) and covered the urban areas of Sydney and Newcastle together with most regional and country towns of any significance.\n\nIn January 1994, extreme weather conditions resulted in over 800 bush fires breaking out along the coast of NSW. More than of land and 205 homes were burned. 120 people were injured and four people were killed, including a volunteer firefighter from the Wingello Bush Fire Brigade (seven were also injured). The financial cost of the disaster was estimated at $165 million. The lengthy Coronial Inquiry that followed recommended the State Government introduce a single entity responsible for the management of bush fires in NSW. The 1997 Rural Fires Act was proclaimed on 1 September, with Phil Koperberg announced as Commissioner. As Director-General of the Department of Bush Fire Services, Koperberg had been in command of the fire agencies battling the 1994 fires and was instrumental in developing the legislation that led to the Rural Fires Act.\n\nOrganised control of bush fires began with the establishment of the first volunteer bush fire brigades at Berrigan in 1896. This brigade had been established in response to a series of large fires in northern Victoria and south western New South Wales in the 1890s. These culminated in the Red Tuesday fire of 1 February 1898 in Gippsland that claimed 12 lives and destroyed 2000 buildings.\n\nIn 1916 the Local Government Act provided for the prevention and mitigation of bush fires by authorising local councils to establish, manage and maintain these brigades. The establishment of the Bush Fires Act in 1930 granted local councils the authority to appoint bush fire officers with powers comparable to those held by a Chief Officer of the NSW Fire Brigades. These Fire Control Officers were responsible for bush fire management within their appointed local council districts.\n\nIn September 1939 a conference of fire-fighting authorities was convened to discuss the prevention of bush fires during the summer months. The Bush Fire Advisory Committee was established to prevent and mitigate bush fires. This committee had no statutory powers but publicised the need for the public to observe fire safety precautions and highlighted the role of Bush Fire Brigades. It was also largely responsible for preparing legislation that led to the Bush Fires Act of 1949.\n\nThe Bush Fires Act, 1949 came into effect on 9 December 1949. This legislation consolidated and modernised the law relating to the prevention, control and suppression of bush fires, and gave councils and other authorities wider powers to protect the areas under their control. The system of bush fire brigades manned by volunteers and directed by their officers appointed by their local Councils continued but shire and district councils or Ministers could now appoint group captains to direct brigades formed by two adjoining councils.\n\nThe Act also gave the Governor of NSW the authority to proclaim bush fire districts where none had previously been proclaimed. Essential to the legislation was the establishment of the Bush Fire Fighting Fund. This Fund was financed by insurance companies contributing half the funds with the remainder supplied equally by State and local government. The Act also enabled for the co-ordination of the activities of the Board of Fire Commissioners, the Forestry Commission (now State Forests) and the Bush Fire Brigades. The Minister for Local Government was empowered to appoint a person to take charge of all bush fire operations during a state of emergency.\n\nThe Bush Fire Committee replaced the Bush Fire Advisory Committee and had 20 members representing NSW Government departments, local government, the insurance industry, the farming community, the Board of Fire Commissioners, and the Commonwealth Meteorological Bureau. A Standing Committee composed of a chairman and five others met at least once a month. Based in Sydney, the Bush Fire Committee advised the Chief Secretary and Minister for Local Government on all matters relating to bush fires, and generally co-ordinated the work of volunteer fire fighting groups and was responsible for community education relating to bush fires.\n\nThe most significant bushfire in New South Wales during this period was the Southern Highlands (1965) bushfire.\n\nIn 1970 the Bush Fire Committee was replaced by the Bush Fire Council, with members drawn from the various fire fighting authorities from around the state. A special Co-ordinating Committee was established to oversee the co-ordination of fire-fighting and related resources prior to and during the bush fire season, and particularly during bush fire emergencies. A Chief Co-ordinator of Bush Fire Fighting was also appointed.\n\nIn January 1975, the Bush Fires Branch of the NSW Chief Secretary's department integrated with the State Emergency Service and renamed the Bush Fire Service.\n\nThe Department of Bush Fire Services was established in 1990. Brandon Leyba was appointed Director-General of the Department on 11 May. The Department's main role was in co-ordinating the fire fighting activities of other government agencies such as the National Parks and Wildlife Service, State Forests of New South Wales, Sydney Water and the New South Wales Fire Brigades in emergency circumstances. It was also responsible for the management and control of the NSW Bush Fire Fighting Fund and the co-ordination of the State's 2,500 Bush Fire Brigades, however the brigades still remained under the direct control of local council.\n\nMajor bushfires during this period were in Far West NSW at Moolah-Corinya, Cobar, Balranald, and across other parts of NSW (in 1974–75), Sydney (1979), Waterfall (1980), Grays Point (1983), Western NSW grasslands (1984), Cobar and across other parts of NSW (in 1984–85), and across Australia's eastern seaboard (1994).\n\nThe NSW Rural Fire Service was established by the Rural Fires Act 1997 which was assented to on 10 July 1997 and came into force on 1 September 1997. The Rural Fires Act repealed the Bush Fires Act, 1949 thereby dissolving the Bush Fire Council and its Committees. Members of these bodies ceased to hold office but were entitled to hold office on a replacing body.\n\nThe Rural Fire Service Advisory Council of New South Wales was established. The Council was to consist of nine representatives with a direct or indirect association with bush fire prevention and control; the Commissioner in charge of bush fire fighting services was ex-officio to be the Chairperson of the Council. The task of the Council was to advise and report to the Minister and Commissioner on any matter relating to the administration of rural fire services, and to advise the Commissioner on public education programs relating to rural fire matters, training of rural fire fighters, and on the issue of Service Standards.\n\nA statutory body – the Bush Fire Co-ordinating Committee – also was established. This was to consist of 12 members including the Commissioner who was to act as Chairperson. The Committee was to be responsible for the administration of rural fires management as well as advising the Commissioner on bush fire prevention.\n\nThe Committee was to constitute a Bush Fire Management Committee for \"the whole of the area of any local authority for which a rural fire district is constituted\". Each Management Committee was to prepare and present to the Council a plan of operations and bush fire risk management plan for its area within three months of establishment. The former was to be reviewed every two years; the latter every five years.\n\nSection 102 of the new act established the New South Wales Rural Fire Fighting Fund to replace the New South Wales Bush Fire Fighting Fund. Quarterly contributions from insurance companies, local councils and the Treasury were to continue in the same proportions as under previous legislation – 14% from the State Treasury, 73.7% from the insurance industry and 12.3% from local Councils.\n\nMajor bushfires during this period were at Lithgow (1997), Black Christmas (2001–02), Central Coast (2006), Junee (2006), Pulletop (2006), Australian season (2006–07), Warrumbungles (2013), New South Wales (2013), Carwoola (2017), Tathra (2018), and Black Summer (2019-20).\n\nNSW RFS Headquarters is located at 4 Murray Rose Avenue, Sydney Olympic Park. It relocated to this location in November 2018 and was previously situated at Rosehill until October 2004. Separate directorates within NSW RFS Headquarters are responsible for Infrastructure Services, Membership and Strategic Services, Operations, and Finance and Executive Services.\n\nRegional offices mirror these responsibilities at more centralised locations across the State. The original eight regions were consolidated into four by 2000, with the model changed to be seven Areas in 2019. \n\nThese areas are as follows:\n\n\nFormerly run by council-appointed officers, district Fire Control Centres became State controlled under the Rural Fires Act. District offices manage the day-to-day affairs of local brigades and maintain responsibility for local fire prevention and strategies. With the amalgamation of neighbouring districts over recent years, there are 47 NSW Rural Fire Service Districts.\n\nVolunteer brigades are responsible for hands-on bush firefighting duties. Since the establishment of the Rural Fire Service, the role of brigades has gradually expanded to include disaster recovery, fire protection at motor vehicle accidents, search and rescue operations and increased levels of structural firefighting. There are more than 2,000 firefighting brigades and more than 50 catering and communications brigades providing support.\n\nThe most senior member of the organisation is the Commissioner. The first NSW RFS Commissioner was Phil Koperberg, who was previously the Director-General of the NSW Department of Bushfire Services since its creation in 1990. In 2007 he stepped down as Commissioner after announcing his candidature for the 2007 state election in which he was elected as the Member for Blue Mountains. In September 2007 Shane Fitzsimmons was officially appointed NSW RFS Commissioner.\n\nWithin the NSW RFS, the head of one of the functional area aligned Directorates within Headquarters is given the corporatised designation Executive Director.\n\nTwo of the current Executive Directors are uniformed personnel with a rank of Senior Assistant Commissioner. The Executive Director, Operational Services holds the rank of Deputy Commissioner and the Executive Director, Infrastructure Services holds the rank of Senior Assistant Commissioner. Non-operational Executive Directors do not currently hold operational ranks.\n\nCurrently the Commissioner has determined that certain occupiers of the role of Director have been appointed to the rank of Assistant Commissioner. Previously, subject to the various executive structures in place, the rank of Assistant Commissioner was held by operational Executive Directors / Directors.\n\nFirefighting appliances used within the RFS are all painted white over orange red with undercarriages painted black, equipped with red and blue flashing emergency lights and sirens. These Firefighting appliances are modified commercial trucks. \n\nAppliances are categorised as follows:\nThe most common of these tankers (a tanker is a type of fire appliance) is the dual cab Category 1 Tanker, which is mainly used in a combination of rural and urban/interface roles ('interface' meaning where built-up areas meet bushland). The next most common fire appliances are Category 7 tankers which are used to support heavier appliances in fire fighting operations as well as being a primary appliance themselves. They are also used where rugged terrain prevents heavy tankers access or where it is far too dangerous to take a heavier appliance. Single and dual cab and Category 9 appliances are most often used as rapid intervention vehicles (thus the name 'Striker') to attack small and spot fires quickly before they are able to spread as Strikers are much faster than heavy, medium and light tankers. Strikers are disadvantaged as they carry limited water. Category 9 appliances are also used to patrol an almost extinguished fire for flare-ups and can 'mop-up' small hot spots.\n\nCategory 2, 3 and 4 tankers are less common and are currently being phased out due to the flexibility of a Category 1 tanker. Category 10 and 11 urban pumpers can be found in many brigades with dedicated urban responsibilities, Category 11 being favoured over Category 10 because of its four-wheel drive capability. Category 13 vehicles, or bulk water carriers are usually rented in the event of a major fire campaign, however there are some Districts that maintain Category 13 vehicles where water supplies are almost always limited in rural and remote areas. Category 14 vehicles are often found on farms. The remaining categories are seldom, if ever, used. Technical information on some of these tankers is available in the Tanker Information section of the service's website.\nThere are a number of water-based fire fighting appliances (Category 15) within the NSW RFS; these appliances are generally operated by brigades located in areas where the only available access is via water (e.g. communities along the Hawkesbury River of NSW).\n\nThe NSW RFS uses various support vehicles. These are categorised as follows:\n\nThe NSW Rural Fire Service also operates an Aviation Unit. The NSW RFS owns and contracts a number of aircraft for firefighting waterbombing, reconnaissance, intelligence gathering and transportation. The NSW RFS aircraft continue to be upgraded with additional camera technology and night vision capability.\n\nEach NSW Rural Fire Service member is issued and equipped with the latest safety equipment to undertake the varied roles they are trained for. Examples of such PPE includes the following:\n\n\nFor brigades with strong village roles, that are equipped with CABA – compressed air breathing apparatus, and perform offensive firefighting.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2155356", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2155356", "title": "Adomian decomposition method", "text": "Adomian decomposition method\n\nThe Adomian decomposition method (ADM) is a semi-analytical method for solving ordinary and partial nonlinear differential equations. The method was developed from the 1970s to the 1990s by George Adomian, chair of the Center for Applied Mathematics at the University of Georgia. \nIt is further extensible to stochastic systems by using the Ito integral. \nThe aim of this method is towards a unified theory for the solution of partial differential equations (PDE); an aim which has been superseded by the more general theory of the homotopy analysis method. \nThe crucial aspect of the method is employment of the \"Adomian polynomials\" which allow for solution convergence of the nonlinear portion of the equation, without simply linearizing the system. These polynomials mathematically generalize to a Maclaurin series about an arbitrary external parameter; which gives the solution method more flexibility than direct Taylor series expansion.\n\nAdomian method is well suited to solve Cauchy problems, an important class of problems which include initial conditions problems.\n\nAn example of initial condition problem for an ordinary differential equation is the following:\n\nTo solve the problem, the highest degree differential operator (written here as \"L\") is put on the left side, in the following way:\n\nwith \"L\" = d/d\"t\" and formula_4. Now the solution is assumed to be an infinite series of contributions:\n\nReplacing in the previous expression, we obtain:\n\nNow we identify \"y\" with some explicit expression on the right, and \"y\", \"i\" = 1, 2, 3, ..., with some expression on the right containing terms of lower order than \"i\". For instance:\n\nIn this way, any contribution can be explicitly calculated at any order. If we settle for the four first terms, the approximant is the following:\n\nA second example, with more complex boundary conditions is the Blasius equation for a flow in a boundary layer:\n\nWith the following conditions at the boundaries:\n\nLinear and non-linear operators are now called formula_11 and formula_12, respectively. Then, the expression becomes:\n\nand the solution may be expressed, in this case, in the following simple way:\n\nwhere: formula_15 If:\n\nand:\n\nAdomian’s polynomials to linearize the non-linear term can be obtained systematically by using the following rule:\n\nwhere: formula_19\n\nBoundary conditions must be applied, in general, at the end of each approximation. In this case, the integration constants must be grouped into three final independent constants. However, in our example, the three constants appear grouped from the beginning in the form shown in the formal solution above. After applying the two first boundary conditions we obtain the so-called Blasius series:\n\nTo obtain γ we have to apply boundary conditions at ∞, which may be done by writing the series as a Padé approximant:\n\nwhere \"L\" = \"M\". The limit at formula_22 of this expression is \"a\"/\"b\".\n\nIf we choose \"b\" = 1, \"M\" linear equations for the \"b\" coefficients are obtained:\n\nThen, we obtain the \"a\" coefficients by means of the following sequence:\n\nIn our example:\n\nWhich when γ = 0.0408 becomes:\n\nwith the limit:\n\nWhich is approximately equal to 1 (from boundary condition (3)) with an accuracy of 4/1000.\n\nOne of the most frequent problems in physical sciences is to obtain the solution of a (linear or nonlinear) partial differential equation which satisfies a set of functional values on a rectangular boundary. An example is the following problem:\n\nwith the following boundary conditions defined on a rectangle:\n\nThis kind of partial differential equation appears frequently coupled with others in science and engineering. For instance, in the incompressible fluid flow problem, the Navier–Stokes equations must be solved in parallel with a Poisson equation for the pressure.\n\nLet us use the following notation for the problem (1):\n\nwhere \"L\", \"L\" are double derivate operators and \"N\" is a non-linear operator.\n\nThe formal solution of (2) is:\n\nExpanding now u as a set of contributions to the solution we have:\n\nBy substitution in (3) and making a one-to-one correspondence between the contributions on the left side and the terms on the right side we obtain the following iterative scheme:\n\nwhere the couple {\"a\"(\"y\"), \"b\"(\"y\")} is the solution of the following system of equations:\n\nhere formula_36 is the \"n\"th-order approximant to the solution and \"N u\" has been consistently expanded in Adomian polynomials:\n\nwhere formula_38 and \"f\"(\"u\") = \"u\" in the example (1).\n\nHere \"C\"(ν, \"n\") are products (or sum of products) of ν components of \"u\" whose subscripts sum up to \"n\", divided by the factorial of the number of repeated subscripts. It is only a thumb-rule to order systematically the decomposition to be sure that all the combinations appearing are utilized sooner or later.\n\nThe formula_39 is equal to the sum of a generalized Taylor series about \"u\".\n\nFor the example (1) the Adomian polynomials are:\n\nOther possible choices are also possible for the expression of \"A\".\n\nCherruault established that the series terms obtained by Adomian's method approach zero as 1/(\"mn\")! if \"m\" is the order of the highest linear differential operator and that formula_41. With this method the solution can be found by systematically integrating along any of the two directions: in the \"x\"-direction we would use expression (3); in the alternative \"y\"-direction we would use the following expression:\n\nwhere: \"c\"(\"x\"), \"d\"(\"x\") is obtained from the boundary conditions at \"y\" = - \"y\" and \"y\" = \"y\":\n\nIf we call the two respective solutions \"x-partial solution\" and \"y-partial solution\", one of the most interesting consequences of the method is that the \"x-partial solution\" uses only the two boundary conditions (1-a) and the \"y-partial solution\" uses only the conditions (1-b).\n\nThus, one of the two sets of boundary functions {\"f\", \"f\"} or {\"g\", \"g\"} is redundant, and this implies that a partial differential equation with boundary conditions on a rectangle cannot have arbitrary boundary conditions on the borders, since the conditions at \"x\" = \"x\", \"x\" = \"x\" must be consistent with those imposed at \"y\" = \"y\" and \"y\" = \"y\".\n\nAn example to clarify this point is the solution of the Poisson problem with the following boundary conditions:\n\nBy using Adomian's method and a symbolic processor (such as Mathematica or Maple) it is easy to obtain the third order approximant to the solution. This approximant has an error lower than 5×10 in any point, as it can be proved by substitution in the initial problem and by displaying the absolute value of the residual obtained as a function of (\"x\", \"y\").\n\nThe solution at \"y\" = -0.25 and \"y\" = 0.25 is given by specific functions that in this case are:\n\nand \"g\"(\"x\") = \"g\"(\"x\") respectively.\n\nIf a (double) integration is now performed in the \"y\"-direction using these two boundary functions the same solution will be obtained, which satisfy \"u\"(\"x\"=0, \"y\") = 0 and \"u\"(\"x\"=0.5, \"y\") = 0 and cannot satisfy any other condition on these borders.\n\nSome people are surprised by these results; it seems strange that not all initial-boundary conditions must be explicitly used to solve a differential system. However, it is a well established fact that any elliptic equation has one and only one solution for any functional conditions in the four sides of a rectangle provided there is no discontinuity on the edges.\nThe cause of the misconception is that scientists and engineers normally think in a boundary condition in terms of weak convergence in a Hilbert space (the distance to the boundary function is small enough to practical purposes). In contrast, Cauchy problems impose a point-to-point convergence to a given boundary function and to all its derivatives (and this is a quite strong condition!).\nFor the first ones, a function satisfies a boundary condition when the area (or another functional distance) between it and the true function imposed in the boundary is so small as desired; for the second ones, however, the function must tend to the true function imposed in any and every point of the interval.\n\nThe commented Poisson problem does not have a solution for any functional boundary conditions \"f\", \"f\", \"g\", \"g\"; however, given \"f\", \"f\" it is always possible to find boundary functions \"g\", \"g\" so close to \"g\", \"g\" as desired (in the weak convergence meaning) for which the problem has solution. This property makes it possible to solve Poisson's and many other problems with arbitrary boundary conditions but never for analytic functions exactly specified on the boundaries.\nThe reader can convince himself (herself) of the high sensitivity of PDE solutions to small changes in the boundary conditions by solving this problem integrating along the \"x\"-direction, with boundary functions slightly different even though visually not distinguishable. For instance, the solution with the boundary conditions:\n\nat \"x\" = 0 and \"x\" = 0.5, and the solution with the boundary conditions:\n\nat \"x\" = 0 and \"x\" = 0.5, produce lateral functions with different sign convexity even though both functions are visually not distinguishable.\n\nSolutions of elliptic problems and other partial differential equations are highly sensitive to small changes in the boundary function imposed when only two sides are used. And this sensitivity is not easily compatible with models that are supposed to represent real systems, which are described by means of measurements containing experimental errors and are normally expressed as initial-boundary value problems in a Hilbert space.\n\nAt least three methods have been reported\nto obtain the boundary functions \"g\", \"g\" that are compatible with any lateral set of conditions {\"f\", \"f\"} imposed. This makes it possible to find the analytical solution of any PDE boundary problem on a closed rectangle with the required accuracy, so allowing to solve a wide range of problems that the standard Adomian's method was not able to address.\n\nThe first one perturbs the two boundary functions imposed at \"x\" = 0 and \"x\" = \"x\" (condition 1-a) with a \"N\"th-order polynomial in \"y\": \"p\", \"p\" in such a way that: \"f\"' = \"f\" + \"p\", \"f\"' = \"f\" + \"p\", where the norm of the two perturbation functions are smaller than the accuracy needed at the boundaries. These \"p\", \"p\" depend on a set of polynomial coefficients \"c\", \"i\" = 1, ..., \"N\". Then, the Adomian method is applied and functions are obtained at the four boundaries which depend on the set of \"c\", \"i\" = 1, ..., \"N\". Finally, a boundary function \"F\"(\"c\", \"c\", ..., \"c\") is defined as the sum of these four functions, and the distance between \"F\"(\"c\", \"c\", ..., \"c\") and the real boundary functions ((1-a) and (1-b)) is minimized. The problem has been reduced, in this way, to the global minimization of the function \"F\"(\"c\", \"c\", ..., \"c\") which has a global minimum for some combination of the parameters \"c\", \"i\" = 1, ..., \"N\". This minimum may be found by means of a genetic algorithm or by using some other optimization method, as the one proposed by Cherruault (1999).\n\nA second method to obtain analytic approximants of initial-boundary problems is to combine Adomian decomposition with spectral methods.\n\nFinally, the third method proposed by García-Olivares is based on imposing analytic solutions at the four boundaries, but modifying the original differential operator in such a way that it is different from the original one only in a narrow region close to the boundaries, and it forces the solution to satisfy exactly analytic conditions at the four boundaries.\n"}

Walter Bellingrath was one of the first Coca-Cola bottlers in the Southeast, and with his wealth built the estate garden and home. He and his wife, Bessie, lived in the home which has since been converted into a museum. The gardens opened to the public in 1932. The site was listed on the Alabama Register of Landmarks and Heritage on September 14, 1977, and on the National Register of Historic Places on October 19, 1982.\n\nBellingrath Gardens and Home encompasses approximately along the Fowl River. The gardens feature cabbage palmettos, live oaks, camellias, azaleas, roses, and chrysanthemums year round. Plants featured in winter are tulips, snapdragons, pansies, ornamental cabbage and kale, daffodils, poppies, primroses, and many varieties of narcissus. Plants featured in spring include more than 250,000 azaleas, hydrangeas, Easter lilies, impatiens, salvia, fuchsia, and Pelargonium geraniums. Plants featured in summer are the more than 2,000 roses, allamandas, hibiscus, copper plants, begonias, ornamental peppers, bougainvillea, caladiums, coleus, vinca, and marigolds. Plants featured in fall are over 8,000 bedded, potted and cascading chrysanthemums, hibiscus, and copper plants.\n\nThe property on which the gardens would eventually be constructed were purchased in 1917 as a fishing camp by Walter Bellingrath, president of the local Coca-Cola bottling plant. Bellingrath bought the property to balance his work-life schedule. The transformation from the \"Belle Camp\" fishing post into what is now Bellingrath Gardens and Home is largely thanks to Bessie Mae Morse Bellingrath, who had married Walter in 1906. Mrs. Bellingrath began developing the gardens with architect George Bigelow Rogers in 1927. The home was completed in 1935, encompasses and features hand-made brick salvaged in Mobile from the 1852 birthplace of Alva Smith Vanderbilt Belmont. Ironwork was obtained from the demolished circa 1837 Southern Hotel, also in Mobile. The house design borrowed elements from many traditions and eras. Some of the most obvious are a formal Georgian staircase reminiscent of an English country house, French doors, and a Mediterranean courtyard.\n\nWalter and Bessie Morse Bellingrath opened their gardens to the public for the first time on April 7, 1932. The home opened to the general public as a museum in 1956, after the 1955 death of Mr. Bellingrath at the age of 86, and features all of its original furnishings from Mrs. Bellingrath.\n\nThe Bellingraths had no children, and after Bessie's death in 1943 Walter dedicated the rest of his life to work on the gardens she had worked so hard to create. In 1950, Walter D. Bellingrath founded the Bellingrath-Morse Foundation at the age of 80. The foundation benefits Rhodes College in Memphis, Tennessee, Stillman College in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and Huntingdon College in Montgomery, Alabama, as well as Bellingrath's church, Central Presbyterian, and his wife's family's St. Francis Street Methodist; these institutions receive approximately 80% of the foundation's earnings. Although the gardens receive income from the Bellingrath-Morse Foundation, two-thirds of current operations are financed by admissions, gift shop and restaurant sales, membership, and donations.\n\nBellingrath Gardens celebrates the Christmas season with a display of over 3 million lights that is known as the \"Magic Christmas in Lights\". The light show began in 1995; it runs from the Friday after Thanksgiving through New Year's Eve. It features over 3 million lights with 1,000 set pieces in 13 themed scenes spaced around the estate. \"USA Today\" included Bellingrath's Magic Christmas in Lights on its 2014 list of the \"10 Best Public Light Displays in America\"; votes from online readers put Bellingrath in sixth place.\n\n\nBellingrath Gardens are mentioned in the 1962 film To Kill a Mockingbird by Atticus Finch. The gardens at Bellingrath are referenced as the model gardens at the time the story was set in 1936.\n"}

It has significance as the site of the formal declaration of independence of the Federation of Malaya on 31 August 1957 and the first modern building of the new nation. The stadium was the principal venue in Kuala Lumpur for celebrations and sporting events until 1962 when the Stadium Negara was built. In 2008, the Stadium Merdeka received the UNESCO Asia-Pacific Award for Excellence for Heritage Conservation owing to its cultural significance and embodiment of a unique independence declaration event.\n\nStadium Merdeka was constructed from 25 September 1956 to 21 August 1957, and was designed by architect Stanley Edward Jewkes. It is the site of one of Malaysia's most historically significant events. On 31 August 1957, power was transferred from the British Empire to the newly independent Malayan government. Tens of thousands of people crowded into the stadium, which was built specifically for this occasion.\n\nThe stadium served as the principal venue in Kuala Lumpur for celebrations and sporting events until the mid-1990s, when the Bukit Jalil National Stadium was built.\n\nThe stadium and its land were given to a private company which had intended to redevelop the land into a RM1 billion entertainment and office complex. In exchange, the company was required to build seven other stadiums in other locations. However, the company did not proceed with the redevelopment due to public outcry and the company's financial difficulties due to the late 1990s Asian economic crisis.\n\nThe Stadium Merdeka, operated by Perbadanan Stadium Merdeka, was a venue for many major sporting events. These included the football matches for Selangor FA from 1957 until 1994, the fight between Muhammad Ali and Joe Bugner on 1 July 1975, and the 1977 Southeast Asian Games and the annual Merdeka Football Tournament (Pesta Bola Merdeka). The Malaysia Cup final between Sarawak and Brunei was held there in 1999 which resulted in a Brunei win 2-1.\n\nThe Merdeka Stadium also hosted major concerts. Michael Jackson's HIStory World Tour filled the stadium to capacity (Jackson performed two sold out concerts on 27 and 29 October 1996, respectively, in front of 55,000 people each night.)\n\nIn February 2003, Stadium Merdeka was named a national heritage building. In 2007, Merdeka Stadium underwent restoration to its original 1957 condition as part of Malaysia's 50th anniversary plans to relive the moment when Tunku Abdul Rahman proclaimed independence there. The restoration was completed by December 2009. The restoration received the UNESCO Asia-Pacific 2008 Award of Excellence for Cultural Heritage Conservation.\n\nWith the restoration of the Stadium Merdeka, the 45,000-capacity stadium was reduced to 20,000, which meant that several of the upper terrace blocks built over the years were demolished. The decision to reduced the capacity of the historic stadium was justified to ensure the integrity of the stadium as it was in 1957, with the Stadium Negara and the Chin Woo Stadium having the capacity to hold larger events. In February 2015, Kuala Lumpur FA returned to Stadium Merdeka for the first time in 17 years for the team's opening Premier League match of the season against Sabah. The last international match played at the stadium saw the Malaysian team drawing 1-1 with Cambodia in October 2001.\n\n\nAccess to the stadium is easy since the operation of KL Monorail began. Passengers can stop at Maharajalela Monorail station, next to one of the stadium's west exits. Stadium Merdeka also lends its name, but is not directly served, by the Merdeka MRT station. The MRT station serves the adjacent Stadium Negara instead.\n\n\n At the time of its independence, Malaya excluded Singapore, Sarawak and Sabah.\n"}

It stands on a 13 acre (50,000 m²) site, located on a commanding position on the slope of a hill of Bukit Petaling overlooking the Klang River, along Jalan Syed Putra.\n\nIt was replaced by the new national palace as the official residence of the King in 2011. In 2013, it was converted into The Royal Museum and referred as \"Old Istana Negara\".\n\nThe palace was originally a double-storey mansion called \"The Big House\" built in 1928 by a local Chinese millionaire, Chan Wing. During the Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1945, it was used as the residence of the Japanese Governor. After the surrender of the Japanese on 15 August 1945, the British Military Administration (BMA) commandeered it for a senior military officers mess from the rank of brigadier. With the formation of the Federation of Malaya in 1950, the Selangor State Government rented the residence from the owners for Straits Dollars 5,000 a month until Merdeka or Independence in 1957. It was renovated to become the palace of His Majesty the Sultan of Selangor. In 1957, the owners sold the property of 13 acres to the Federal Government at an agreed valuation of Straits Dollars 1.4 Million.The Federal Government then converted the residence into the Istana Negara for the newly created sovereign post of Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King) of Malaya which was about to achieve independence that August as scheduled. Since then it has undergone several renovations and extensions. But the most extensive upgrading was carried out in 1980, as it was the first time that the installation ceremony of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong was held at the Istana Negara. Prior to this the Installation Ceremonies were held at the Tunku Abdul Rahman Hall in Jalan Ampang, Kuala Lumpur with the first one held in 1957.\n\nAfter the Istana Negara moved to the new palace at Jalan Duta in December 2011, it was later used for a royal exhibition called \"Raja Kita\", in conjunction with the installation of Tuanku Abdul Halim Mu'adzam Shah as the 14th Yang di-Pertuan Agong in 2012. The exhibition started on 15 April 2012 and is later extended on 8 December 2012. Over 314,757 visitors, both local and foreign visited the exhibition between 15 April and 7 December.\n\nIt was decided that starting in 2013, two guards in Malay traditional attire would be stationed at the main gateway of the old Istana Negara to revive the nostalgia and tradition of the Malay Sultanate. Information, Communications and Culture Minister Rais Yatim said the practice will help retain the old palace as a must-visit tourist destination. Several rooms and halls at the old Istana Negara will be open to visitors to learn of their use to the previous thirteen Kings who lived in this old royal palace. An inventory will be drawn up of the collections in the palace in the effort to conserve them. Rais Yatim requested the Royal Malaysia Police and the Department of Museums to collaborate in managing the collections.\n\nThe building is nestled within an 11.34-hectare compound with a variety of plants and flowers, swimming pool and indoor badminton hall. As the palace grounds are not opened to members of the public or tourists, the Main Palace Entrance is a favourite picture spot for tourists.\n\nThe whole area is fenced up and the Royal Insignia of His Majesty is placed on each steel bar between two pillars of the fence. At the front of the Istana Negara, there is the main entrance which resembles an arch. On each side of the arch, are two guard posts to shelter two members of the cavalry in their full dress uniform similar to the ones at Buckingham Palace, London. From 2013 onwards, the full dress uniform will be in Malay traditional attire as it was during the Malay Sultanate era.\n\nIn the grounds of the palace is a guard house for the members of the Royal Malay Regiment, one of the two Household Division units in the Malaysian Armed Forces (the other one is the Malaysian Royal Armoured Corps Mounted Ceremonial Squadron). There is also a six hole golf course, tennis courts and a lake in the far end of the grounds.\n\nThe driveway, lined with cypresses and casuarinas, leads to two entrances – an entrance to the West Wing and the other to the East Wing.\n\nThe \"Balai Rong Seri\" or throne room is located in the East Wing and was used only for official and customary functions. These include ceremonial occasions of taking the royal pledge, the installation rite, and the appointment of a new prime minister and the federal government which included investiture ceremonies and the taking of oaths by the government ministers and state governors. This is also where the presentation and acceptance of foreign diplomatic appointments are held. It sometimes serves as a banquet hall.\n\nThe second hall on the first floor is the \"Dewan Mengadap\" where the King receives honoured guests such as Head of States and foreign dignitaries. This hall doubles as a resting place of Sultans and Governors during the Conference of Rulers. The other rooms are \"Bilik Duta\", \"Bilik Permaisuri\" and \"Bilik Menteri\". \"Bilik Duta\" is where the King grants audience to the Prime Minister and also where honoured guests are received. The Queen receives her guests at the \"Bilik Permaisuri\" while the \"Bilik Menteri\" is the rest room for guests.\n\nMeetings of the Conference of Rulers were held at the \"Bilik Mesyuarat Raja-Raja\" situated in the West Wing.\n\nThe new RM 997 million Istana Negara complex is located near Jalan Duta, Kuala Lumpur. The court moved to new palace in December 2011.\n\nThe construction was commenced in mid-2007 and completed in 2011 at a total cost of RM997 million. Works Minister Shaziman Abu Mansor said the palace is now \"Kuala Lumpur's most amazing architectural achievement, surpassing even the Twin Towers\".\n\n\n"}

Opened in September 1970, it is named after Audrey Bruce Currier, a member of the Radcliffe College Class of 1956 who, along with her husband, was killed in a plane crash in 1967. The area was formerly used as housing for Radcliffe College, and as such the four towers of Currier House are named for distinguished alumnae of Radcliffe, including the author Barbara Tuchman. Along with Cabot House and Pforzheimer House, Currier is part of the former Radcliffe Quadrangle, known colloquially as simply \"the Quad.\"\n\nThe current Faculty Deans are Latanya Sweeney and Sylvia Barrett. The Allston Burr Resident Dean is Laura Johnson. Previous deans have included scholar of Islam and former Dean of Harvard Divinity School William A. Graham, chemist and Nobel laureate Dudley R. Herschbach, and classicist Gregory Nagy.\n\nBecause of its distance from most of the other residential houses, its physical layout (which places most of the house's social space near the entrance), and its small size (it has the smallest population of any house), many Currier residents consider the house to have one of the strongest and most cohesive house communities of Harvard's residential houses. Students routinely rank Currier's dining hall highest among Harvard dining halls in food quality. In 2005, Currier renovated a common space known as the \"Fishbowl\" to create an entertainment center complete with a big screen projector and surround sound system. In early 2006, Currier painted many of its interior walls to produce a more colorful atmosphere.\n\nMost of Currier's bedrooms are single bedrooms connected by a sinkroom or full private bathroom, a rarity at Harvard (where most dormitories date to the 1920s and are now relatively crowded.) The house is also known for the \"Ten-Man,\" a suite of ten single bedrooms surrounding the largest in-suite common room at Harvard College. Additionally, Currier House has a \"Solarium,\" a penthouse balcony suite that houses ten students in ten single bedrooms, atop Gilbert, Bingham and Tuchman towers.\n\nIn 2004–2005, Currier House won the Straus Cup for the first time in over twenty years. The cup is given to the house that scores the most points in intramural athletic competition during the school year.\n\nCurrier House consists of four towers containing mostly single rooms adjoined by a sink room or bathroom. In addition to these rooms, Currier also has some of the most coveted senior living arrangements, including the \"Ten-Man,\" which is a suite of ten singles and three full bathrooms arranged around Harvard's largest common room, and 3 penthouse suites nicknamed \"Solarium rooms.\"\n\nStudent government in Currier House consists of the Currier House Committee, of which all house residents are members. The committee operates separate from the Harvard Undergraduate Council, to organize student events and manage funding. The Currier HoCo, as the other student government organizations in the Houses, are funded by the UC and maintained by an executive council run my students in leadership positions. Elections for the two Chair positions, as well as all other social organization positions, are held every January during the Super Bowl Halftime show, broadcast in the Fishbowl common space. The two HoCo co-chairs are Jacob Miller and Annie Garofalo.\n\nNotable alumni include:\n\nGates and Ballmer met in Currier House, where the two lived on the same floor, and formed a friendship that later led Gates to recruit his college friend to join his budding software company. Gates also described during his 2007 commencement address at Harvard how he initiated one of his first software deals while making a call from his room in Currier House.\n\n"}

{"id": "2155396", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2155396", "title": "Separation of powers in Australia", "text": "Separation of powers in Australia\n\nThe doctrine of the separation of powers in Australia divides the institutions of government into three branches: legislative, executive and judicial. The legislature makes the laws; the executive put the laws into operation; and the judiciary interprets the laws. The doctrine of the separation of powers is often assumed to be one of the cornerstones of fair government. A strict separation of powers is not always evident in Australia; instead the Australian version of separation of powers combines the basic democratic concepts embedded in the Westminster system, the doctrine of \"\"responsible government\"\" and the United States version of the separation of powers. The issue of separation of powers in Australia has been a contentious one and continues to raise questions about where power lies in the Australian political system.\n\nAlthough it is assumed that all the branches under the separation of powers do not overlap - as in the US, for example - there is sometimes a 'common ground' between all three levels. In Australia there is little separation between the executive and the legislature, with the executive required to be drawn from, and maintain the confidence of, the legislature. In Victorian Stevedoring & General Contracting Co Pty Ltd & Meakes v Dignan the High Court of Australia held that a strict division between these two levels was not practical and re-affirmed the Constitution to outline this (German, 2012).\n\nThe first three chapters of the Australian Constitution are headed respectively \"The Parliament\", \"The Executive Government\", and \"The Judicature\". Each of these chapters begins with a section by which the relevant \"power of the Commonwealth\" is \"vested\" in the appropriate persons or bodies. The historical context in which the Constitution was drafted suggests that these arrangements were intended to be connected with federal ideas along American lines.\n\nOn the other hand, the Constitution incorporates responsible government, in which the legislature and the executive are effectively united. This incorporation is reflected in sections 44, 62 and 64 of the Constitution.\n\nCurrently, there is no constitutional system where there is a complete separation of powers. The strict doctrine exists only in a theory – in reality, some overlap is inevitable, though a system of checks and balances has developed. In the Westminster system, ministers (executive) are required to sit in Parliament (legislative). This is to adhere with the concept of Responsible Government. This is also present in the Australian system, being a requirement of section 64 of the Constitution.\n\nThe specific requirement for ministers to sit in Parliament established the connection between executive and legislative, effectively preventing an American-style separation of the two. Strictly speaking, any person may be appointed a Minister, but their appointment lapses if they do not gain a seat in either house of the Parliament within three months. This provision was necessary in 1901, as the first government was sworn in on 1 January but the first parliament was not elected until late March (see 1901 Australian federal election). No non-parliamentarian was appointed a Minister since then, until the appointment of Bob Carr as Foreign Minister in 2012. However, the provision is still relevant. It applies when a minister in the House of Representatives loses their seat at a general election; despite no longer being a member of parliament, the Minister will typically retain their portfolio for some days after the election, until the new government is sworn in. It also applied when John Gorton became Prime Minister in 1968; he was sworn in while a member of the Senate, then he resigned to contest a by-election for a lower house seat, which he won, but between his resignation from the Senate and being elected to the House of Representatives, he remained Prime Minister without holding any seat in Parliament.\n\nIn \"Victorian Stevedoring & General Contracting Co Pty Ltd v Dignan\", the High Court of Australia held that it was impossible, consistent with the British tradition, to insist upon a strict separation between legislative and executive powers. It was found that legislative power may be delegated to the executive, and as a result upheld the validity of delegated legislation. By contrast, in its insistence on a strict separation of \"judicial power\", the High Court has been less willing to compromise. Furthermore, the role of the courts was discussed in \"Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW)\", whereby a NSW statute was invalidated since it purported to confer not-judicial functions to court. The principle that a State Court cannot be assigned powers that are incompatible with its constitutionally protected independence was extended to Territory Courts in \"Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy\" (2000).\n\nThe executive is not only physically part of the legislature, but the legislature can also allocate it some of its powers, such as of the making of regulations under an Act passed by Parliament. Similarly, the legislature could restrict or over-rule some powers held by the executive by passing new laws to that effect, though these could be subject to judicial review.\n\nThe exceptionally strong party discipline in Australia, especially in the lower house, has had the effect of weakening scrutiny of the executive by the legislature since within the lower house, every member of the numerically larger party will almost always support the executive and its propositions on all issues.\n\nOn the other hand, the Senate has had the effect of restraining the power of the executive through its ability to query, amend and block government legislation. The result of the adoption of a proportional system of voting in 1949 has been that the Senate in recent decades has rarely been controlled by governments. Minor parties have gained greater representation and Senate majorities on votes come from a coalition of groups on a particular issue, usually after debate by the Opposition and Independents.\n\nThe Constitution does, moreover, provide for one form of physical separation of executive and legislature. Section 44, concerning the disqualifications applying to membership of Parliament, excludes from Parliament government employees (who hold \"an office of profit under the crown\" (iv)) along with people in certain contractual arrangements with the Commonwealth. This was demonstrated in 1992 after Independent MP, Phil Cleary, had won the Victorian seat of Wills. Cleary, on leave without pay from the Victorian Education Department at the time of his election, was held in \"Sykes v Cleary\" to be holding an office of profit under the Crown and disqualified. The Court noted that that Section 44's intention was to separate executive influence from the legislature.\n\nAs early as New South Wales v Commonwealth (\"The Wheat Case\"), the High Court decided that the strict insulation of judicial power was a fundamental principle of the Constitution. This also applies to tribunals and commissions set up by Federal Parliament which, unlike some of their equivalents in the states, can only recommend consequences. The Federal Parliament itself has the rarely used privilege of being able to act as a court in some circumstances, primarily where it may regard a non-member as acting \"in contempt\" of parliament.\n\nThe reasoning in the \"Wheat Case\" was taken further in \"Waterside Workers' Federation of Australia v J W Alexander Ltd\" where a decisive distinction between judicial and arbitral functions was drawn. The High Court made reference to the separation of powers again in R v Kirby; Ex parte Boilermakers' Society of Australia (\"Boilermakers' Case\"), highlighting that only a Chapter III Court can exercise judicial powers and, that a Chapter III Court is only permitted to exercise judicial power.\n\nA consequence of the Australian version of the separation of powers is its role in encouraging judicial deference to the \"political\" arms of government. The normal propensity of the High Court is to recognise that separation of powers requires not only that the \"political branches\" should not interfere with judicial activity, but also that the judiciary should leave politicians and administrators alone. The importance of deference has been acknowledged in extrajudicial writings, and in decisions such as \"Drake v Minister for Immigration & Ethnic Affairs (No 2)\".\n\nAs a manifestation of the separation of powers, a 'Chapter III Court' cannot make administrative decisions. In administrative law this means that the courts cannot substitute an original decision of the executive, but can only decide on its correctness.\n\nThe doctrine of \"persona designata\" permits non-judicial functions to be conferred on judges in their personal capacity, as opposed to their judicial capacity. However, in \"Hindmarsh Island Bridge case\", it was held that this is subject to the compatibility of the conferred non-judicial function with judicial office.\n\nWhile there are strong textual and structural bases for the independence of the judiciary in the Commonwealth Constitution, the same is not true of the State constitutions. State courts, unlike their federal counterparts, are therefore capable of exercising non-judicial functions. For example, the District Court of South Australia, through its Administrative and Disciplinary Division, conducts merits review of administrative decisions, a function which at Commonwealth level can only be exercised by Executive tribunals. Nevertheless, a degree of judicial independence is maintained at State level by convention.\n\nThe federal separation of powers also has implications for State courts, due to the fact that State courts may be invested with federal judicial power under section 71 of the \"Commonwealth Constitution\". On this basis it was held in \"Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW)\" that a State court could not be given a function inconsistent with its status as a potential repository of federal judicial power. The doctrine was rarely applied in the early years following Kable, leading Justice Kirby to describe it as \"a constitutional guard-dog that would bark but once.\" However, there has been a revival in the High Court's application of the doctrine since 2009. One recent case was \"South Australia v Totani,\" which involved a challenge to the validity of the \"Serious and Organised Crime (Control) Act 2008\" (SA). Section 14(1) of the Act required members of the Magistrates' Court of South Australia to make control orders on application by the Commissioner of Police, provided only that the Magistrate was satisfied that the person subject to the control order was a member of a declared organisation. Even though the functions of the Magistrates' Court under the Act are purely a matter of South Australian law, the fact that the Court is also capable of exercising federal jurisdiction was held to require that it maintain certain standards of independence and impartiality so that it retain the character of a court.\n\nParliamentary scrutiny of the executive and, in particular, by the New South Wales Legislative Council, was tested in the 1990s when Treasurer Michael Egan, on behalf of Cabinet, refused to table documents in the Legislative Council of which he was a member. The Council, determined to exercise its scrutiny of the executive, pressed the issues and eventually adjudged the Treasurer in contempt, suspending him from the house twice. The matters were disputed in three cases in the High Court and the Supreme Court of New South Wales. The results upheld that principle that the Legislative Council does have the power to order the production of documents by a member of the House, including a minister, and can counter obstruction. However, the extent of the Legislative Council's power in relation to Cabinet documents remains unclear.\n\nIn 2018 the High Court held that all matters falling within section 75, and section 76, of the Constitution formed part of the judicial power of the Commonwealth, including a dispute between the residents of different States. It followed that the federal separation of powers meant that a State tribunal was unable to determine a dispute between residents of different States.\n\nOne of the bases for the separation of powers in the Constitution is that the powers of the Parliament are found in Chapter I, executive powers are in Chapter II and judicial powers are in Chapter III. In 1915 it had been held that the separation of powers precluded the exercise of judicial power by the Inter-State Commission, provided for at section 101, in Chapter IV Finance and Trade. The power to make laws for the government of the territories is found in section 122, located in Chapter VI New States. How section 122 relates to Chapter III is \"a problem of interpretation ... which has vexed judges and commentators since the earliest days of Federation\" Three of the six judges in the \"Stolen Generations case\", held that the separation of powers doctrine did not apply to the power to make laws for a territory under section 122 of the Constitution. The High Court went on to hold in 2004 that federal jurisdiction can be invested by the Australian Parliament in a Territory court as well as in a State court. In 2015 the question was again considered by the High Court where Gageler J, and Keane J, held that the power under section 122 was not constrained by the doctrine of separation of powers enshrined in Chapter III of the Constitution. Keane J similarly held . The other members of the Court, French CJ, Kiefel and Bell JJ, and Nettle and Gordon JJ, found it was unnecessary to answer the question.\n"}

He first played for NSW in 1977–78, made his international debut in 1980–81. Lawson made three tours of England, including the 1989 Ashes-winning tour.\n\nFor a few seasons in the early 1980s, Lawson was Australia's leading fast bowler, but his career suffered from poor luck with injury.\n\nLawson received the Order of Australia in 1990 for services to cricket and in 2002 he was given the Australian Sports Medal. He is a qualified optometrist who graduated with a Bachelor of Optometry (BOptom) from the University of New South Wales.\n\nSince his playing retirement, Lawson has been a coach, commentator and writer on the game. He has broadcast for ABC Radio, Channel Nine and Foxsports, and contributed to the \"Sydney Morning Herald\" and other newspapers and magazines in various countries. He has coached the Kochi Tuskers Kerala.\n\nLawson first came to notice in international cricket by bowling a series of bouncers during a brief spell against Geoff Boycott in a tour match between NSW and England in the 1978–79 season. He was called up as a replacement player for the 1979 tour of India, but did not play a Test match. Similarly, he toured Pakistan in 1980 and did not make the Test team.\n\nHe took three wickets during his debut in the first Test against New Zealand at Brisbane in 1980–81, and played the first three ODIs of his career in the World Series Cup. In only his third Test, Lawson returned 7/81 in the first innings against England at Lord's in 1981, which earned him the man of the match award. However, injuries interrupted his progress. He missed the last three Tests of the series with a back injury and played only one Test in the following Australian season, against the West Indies at Melbourne. Chosen for nine preliminary ODIs in the World Series Cup, his total of nine wickets was not enough to earn him selection for the finals against the West Indies.\n\nEstablishing himself as a leading bowler on Australia's tour of Pakistan in 1982, Lawson claimed nine wickets at 33.55 in three Tests on slow wickets not conducive to fast bowling.'Player of the Series' award for his efforts in the 1982–83 Ashes series. In the absence of the injured Dennis Lillee, he became the spearhead of the Australian attack, taking 34 wickets at 20.20 average. This included 5/108 in the second innings at Perth during the first Test (where he scored 50 in the first innings), match figures of 11/134 at Brisbane, and 4/46 and 5/66 at Adelaide. Australia won the series 2–1 and regained the Ashes. Lawson enjoyed a successful World Series Cup tournament, capturing 16 wickets at 15.80 in ten ODIs as Australia defeated New Zealand in the final.\n\nOpting to miss the short tour of Sri Lanka that followed, Lawson returned to the team for the 1983 World Cup. The Australians failed to make the semi-final in a disappointing performance and Lawson's contribution was five wickets in four games. Against Pakistan in 1983–84, he was again Australia's most successful Test bowler in a 2–0 win, taking 24 wickets at 24.16, including 5/59 and 4/48 in the fifth Test at Sydney.\n\nLawson's mediocre figures on the 1984 tour of the West Indies (12 wickets in five Tests) was a primary reason for Australia's heavy defeat in the series, although he performed better on the short one day tour of India later that year. Playing against the West Indies in the Australian season of 1984–85, Lawson returned to form with 23 wickets at 25.60. In the third Test at Adelaide, he claimed 8/112 in a marathon spell on a batting-friendly pitch, then made 49 in the first innings but Australia lost the match, and eventually the series 1–3. During the season, he played 15 ODIs and took 17 wickets, but surprisingly was never chosen for an ODI in Australia again.\n\nLeading an inexperienced bowling attack weakened by player defections to the rebel tours of South Africa, Lawson captured 24 wickets in six Tests against England in 1985 despite suffering bronchial problems throughout the tour. His best was 5/103 in the first innings at Nottingham and a score of 53 in the fifth Test at Edgbaston. However, his wickets were obtained at the expensive average of 37.72, as England compiled a series of high scores and won the series 3–1. The weakened Australian team fared little better in the 1985–86 season, playing New Zealand and India. Injury restricted Lawson to only two Tests against the Kiwis, for five wickets.\n\nAs Australia began rebuilding its team, Lawson was absent for most of the next three years, due to injuries and falling out of favour with the selectors and the captain Allan Border. He played a single Test in both the 1986–87 Ashes series and the 1988–89 series against the West Indies. In the latter match, he took three wickets, but had his jaw broken by a bouncer from Curtly Ambrose while batting. Lawson recovered to make the 1989 tour of England, when his experience and guile contributed to a resurgence in Australia's performances. Forming a potent pace bowling attack with Terry Alderman and Merv Hughes, Lawson finished with 29 wickets at 27.27 as Australia won back the Ashes with a crushing 4–0 victory. His best performance came in the fourth Test at Manchester, where he took 6/72 and 3/81 and was named man of the match. In the second Test at Lord's, Lawson hit a career-best 74 in the first innings in sharing a partnership of 130 with Steve Waugh.\n\nIt proved to be the Indian summer of his career. He played his last ODIs during the Nehru Cup tournament in India that followed the England tour. In the 1989–90 Australian season, he played one Test against New Zealand (for two wickets) and then took a solitary wicket in the first Test against Sri Lanka at Brisbane. Dropped for the next Test, he failed to regain his place although he continued playing for NSW until the end of the 1991–92 season.\n\nIn the Sheffield Shield competition, he captained New South Wales between 1988 and 1992, leading the team to the title in the 1991–92 final, his final first-class game. In all, he captured 395 wickets for NSW. His positive, aggressive captaincy influenced NSW colleagues and future Australian captains Mark Taylor and Steve Waugh. He had a brief playing stint for Lancashire in the English County Championship.\n\nBetween 1995 and 1997, Lawson was coach of the NSW team. On 16 July 2007, he was appointed as coach of the Pakistan cricket team for two years, becoming the third foreigner to take on the role. On 20 October 2008, Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ijaz Butt stated Lawson's contract would not be renewed once his term finishes in April 2009 stating \"We have no utility for Lawson.\" He was subsequently sacked on 24 October 2008.\nHe describes the time he lived as an Australian in Lahore as \"enjoyable.\"\n\nLawson was formally announced as coach of the terminated Kochi Tuskers Kerala on 29 December 2010. The contract will see him coach the franchise for at least two years Lawson confirmed that a deal had been in place much earlier but he couldn't sign because of the minority shareholding conflict. Lawson said he is quite delighted to be the coach of an IPL team. Lawson has confidence that his team will do well during IPL tournament.\n\nIn June 2019, he was named as the coach of the Toronto Nationals franchise team for the 2019 Global T20 Canada tournament.\n"}

{"id": "2155427", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2155427", "title": "Australian bass", "text": "Australian bass\n\nThe Australian bass (\"Macquaria novemaculeata\") is a small to medium-sized, primarily freshwater (but estuarine spawning) species of fish found in coastal rivers and streams along the east coast of Australia. It is a member of the family Percichthyidae and the genus \"Macquaria\" (although some researchers place it in the genus \"Percalates\" instead). Australian bass is an important member of the native fish assemblages found in east coast river systems. It is a predatory native fish and an extremely popular angling species. The species was simply called perch in most coastal rivers where it was caught until the 1960s, when the name Australian bass started to gain popularity.\n\nAustralian bass (\"Macquaria novemaculeata\") are closely related and very similar in appearance to estuary perch (\"Macquaria colonorum\"). Estuary perch however tend to remain in the estuarine reaches or (occasionally) the extreme lower freshwater reaches. Hybridisation between the two species is rare overall but relatively common in the far southern extremities of the Australian bass's range.\n\nIn the 1970s Australian bass and estuary perch were moved into the genus \"Macquaria\" – one of a number of Australian genera in the family Percichthyidae – along with two species of native perch from the Murray-Darling Basin, golden perch (\"Macquaria ambigua\") and Macquarie perch (\"Macquaria australasica\"). Prior to that, Australian bass and estuary perch were in a separate genus, \"Percalates\". (The generic name \"Percalates\" is a compound of the generic names \"Perca\" and \"Lates\", and arose from an early, erroneous taxonomic belief that Australian bass were an old world perch related to barramundi (\"Lates calcarifer\")).\n\nResults from recent research using genetic MtDNA analysis indicate Australian bass and estuary perch do belong in a separate genus to golden perch and Macquarie perch, and has resulted some in researchers resurrecting the genus \"Percalates\" and referring to Australian bass and estuary perch as \"Percalates novemaculeata\" and \"Percalates colonorum\" respectively.\n\nA rather surprising and unexpected finding of this research is that the putative genus \"Percalates\" (i.e. Australian bass and estuary perch) appears to be genetically closer to the genus \"Maccullochella\" (Murray cod and other cod species) than to the remnant genus \"Macquaria\" (golden perch and Macquarie perch).\n\nSteindachner does not explicitly state the reasons behind the surprisingly ambiguous specific name \"novemaculeata\" that he created for Australian bass. There are several possibilities. It may be a Latin rendering of \"new\" (\"novem\") and \"spotted\" (\"maculeata\") and refer to the distinct black blotches juvenile bass are temporarily marked with when very small (i.e. <6–7 cm). It may be a Latin rendering of \"in an unusual manner\" (\"nove\") and \"spotted\" (\"maculeata\") and refer to the specimens he examined being \"spotted\":\n\nThe most likely explanation however is a Latin rendering of \"nine\" (\"novem\") and \"spines/needles\" (\"aculeata\") and refer to the spiny dorsal fin, which is relatively high and sharp and which Steindachner indicates is usually (but not always) composed of nine dorsal spines:\n\nAustralian bass have a moderately deep, elongated body that is laterally compressed. They have a forked caudal (\"tail\") fin and angular anal and soft dorsal fins. Their spiny dorsal fin is relatively high, strong and sharp. They have a medium-sized mouth and relatively large eyes than can appear dark in low light or red in bright light. The opercula or gill covers on Australian bass carry extremely sharp flat spines that can cut fishermens' fingers deeply.\n\nAustralian bass vary in colour from metallic gold in clear sandy streams to the more usual bronze or bronze-green colouration in streams with darker substrates and/or some tannin staining to the water.\n\nAustralian bass are, overall, a smallish-sized species. Wild river fish average around 0.4–0.5 kg and 20–30 cm. A river fish of 1 kg or larger is a good specimen. Maximum size in rivers appears to be around 2.5 kg and 55 cm in southern waters, and around 3.0 kg and 60–65 cm in northern waters. Australian bass stocked in man-made impoundments (where they cannot breed) grow to much greater average and maximum weights than this.\n\nAustralian bass are found in coastal rivers and streams from Wilsons Promontory in Victoria east and north along the eastern seaboard to the rivers and creeks of the Bundaberg region in central Queensland.\n\nAustralian bass are not found in the Murray-Darling system because although the system is extensive, it has only one variable entrance to the Southern Ocean, a feature that appears to be incompatible with the estuarine breeding habits of Australian bass and other aspects of their life cycle.\n\nAustralian bass are primarily a freshwater riverine species, but must breed in estuarine waters. Consequently, Australian bass reside in the freshwater reaches of coastal rivers for the warmer half of the year or slightly more and the estuarine reaches in winter, and are highly migratory in general.\n\nA general description of the typical migratory pattern for adult Australian bass in the central (NSW) portion of their range would be:\n\n\nObviously the timing of these migratory movements varies from the north to the south of their range, with bass in the far south of their range appearing to move and recruit in spring rather than winter, probably because of colder water temperatures. The timing of these migratory movements are also dependent on river flows, particularly freshes and floods that drown out and make larger rapids and cascades passable.\n\nAustralian bass are found at their highest altitude in the freshwater reaches of rivers during the months of December, January and February. Research indicates there is sexual segregation in this non-spawning season for resource partitioning purposes. Males inhabit the lower freshwater reaches of rivers while females travel far into the middle and even upper freshwater (upland) reaches. The distance Australia bass travel upstream appears to be limited only by flows and impassable barriers (historically, waterfalls; today, often, dams). Thus, historically, the effective altitudinal limit for Australian bass has been as high as 400–600 metres in some river systems. For instance, Australian bass originally migrated up to the Dalgety region in the Snowy River, well above Oallen Crossing on the Shoalhaven River and far up the Warragamba River and Coxs River before these rivers were dammed:\n\nIn the freshwater reaches of coastal rivers in the warmer months, Australian bass require reasonable quality, unsilted habitats with adequate native riparian vegetation and in-stream cover/habitat. Australian bass generally sit in cover during the day. However, they are fairly flexible about the type of cover used. Sunken timber (“snags”), undercut banks, boulders, shade under trees and bushes overhanging the water and thick weedbeds are all used as cover. Such cover does not need to be in deep water to be used; Australian bass are happy to use cover in water as shallow as 1 metre in depth.\n\nAustralian bass are strong swimmers at all sizes and can easily traverse rapids and fast-flowing water. However, they generally avoid sitting directly in currents to conserve energy.\n\nAt night Australian bass display pelagic (\"near-surface\") behaviour and actively hunt prey in shallow water and at the water's surface.\n\nWhen aggregated for spawning in the broad reaches of estuaries in winter, Australian bass are less cover oriented, and generally sit in deeper water.\n\nCommon items in the diet of Australian bass are:\n\n\nHowever, Australian bass are fierce predators and any small creature that swims across a bass pool such as (introduced) mice and native lizards or frogs are at risk of being taken by a large Australian bass, and are regularly taken.\n\nFor reasons that are not clear, Australian bass are extremely slow growing. Australian bass continue the trend present in the larger native fish species of SE Australia of being very long-lived. Longevity is a survival strategy to ensure that most adults participate in at least one exceptional spawning and recruitment event, which are often linked to unusually wet 'La Niña' years and may only occur every one or two decades. For many years, the maximum age recorded in wild Australian bass was 22 years. However, a wild bass from the Genoa River system has now been aged at 47 years of age. The same study recorded numerous wild bass aged 19 years of age and 29 years of age (corresponding to two separate years of strong recruitment).\n\nAs with other \"Macquaria\" species, there is sexual dimorphism in Australian bass. Males tend to have an absolute maximum size of 1.0 kg or less, while females regularly exceed 1.0 kg and sometimes reach the maximum size of 2.5–3.0 kg. Males reach sexual maturity at 3+ years of age, females at 5–6 years of age.\n\nAustralian bass spawn in estuaries in winter, generally in the months of July or August. There is uncertainty about the salinity levels that Australian bass spawn in. Estuaries are dynamic habitats with daily fluxes in salinity due to tides, and are also affected by droughts, floods and freshes (minor, temporary rises in flow), making measurements of preferred spawning salinities for wild Australian bass difficult. However, based on capture of recently spawned larval and juvenile Australian bass in estuaries, the species appears to spawn in a salinity range of 8–12 parts per thousand (salt water is approximately 36 ppt). Australian bass sperm have no viability at or below 6 ppt, but are most viable at 12 ppt, the latter probably being the most relevant fact. However, it has been reported that Australian bass spawned in salinities of 12–18 ppt, with this statement based on fishermens' reports of observing wild Australian bass spawnings and some unpublished data gathered by the NSW Fisheries Department.\n\nArtificial breeding of Australian bass is carried out at much higher salinities than natural.\n\nAustralian bass are highly fecund, with a reported mean fecundity (\"fertility\") of 440,000 eggs from the mature wild female specimens examined, and one very large specimen yielding 1,400,000 eggs. The eggs are reported as being demersal (\"sinking\") in natural spawning salinities, in which case estuarine vegetation such as sea grass almost certainly play an important role in \"trapping\" and protecting eggs. Larvae hatch in 2–3 days. Juvenile Australian bass migrate into the freshwater reaches after spending several months in estuarine waters.\n\nDespite spawning in estuaries, Australian bass rely on floods coming down river systems into the estuaries throughout the winter period, both to stimulate migration and spawning in adult Australian bass and for strong survival and recruitment of Australian bass larvae.\n\nAustralian bass adults and larvae may also enter the sea (the latter perhaps involuntarily) during winter spawning in times of flood. It has been reported:\n\"The presence of field-caught larvae of both species on incoming tides in Swansea Channel indicates that the larvae have spent some time in the ocean... \"Macquaria novemaculeata\" adults move downstream into estuaries to spawn in water of suitable salinity. In low rainfall years, the spawning location is further upstream than in wet years, when spawning can occur in shallow coastal waters adjacent to estuaries (Searle, pers. comm.). Mature \"M. novemaculeata\" adults can be found outside of estuaries in wet years (Williams, 1970). This is verified by the collection of mature adults by trawl in July 1995 in 11–17 m of water off Newcastle, NSW (AMS I.37358-001).\"\n\nThis kind of movement leads to some genetic interchange between river systems and is important in maintaining a high degree of genetic homogeneity (\"sameness\") in Australian bass stocks and preventing speciation. However, this movement has not prevented distinct genetic profiles and subtle morphological (\"body shape\") differences developing in different river systems. These findings, along with research showing significant differences in seasonal timing of spawning and migration in far south populations stress the importance of using appropriate regional Australian bass stocks for artificial breeding and stocking projects.\n\nWild Australian bass stocks have declined seriously since European settlement.\n\nDams and weirs blocking migration of Australian bass both to estuaries and to the upper freshwater reaches of coastal rivers is the most potent cause of decline. Most coastal rivers now have dams and weirs on them. If Australian bass are prevented from migrating to estuaries for breeding by an impassable dam or weir, then they will die out above that dam or weir. Some dams or weirs exclude Australian bass from the vast majority of their habitat. It is estimated for example that Tallowa Dam on the Shoalhaven River, once an Australian bass stronghold, currently excludes wild Australian bass from more than 80% of their former habitat (in early 2010 however a \"fish lift\" was fitted to the dam). Dams and weirs also diminish or completely remove flood events required for effective breeding of adult bass and effective recruitment of juvenile Australian bass. A related issue is the myriad of other structures on coastal rivers such as poorly designed road crossings that (often needlessly) block migration of Australian bass.\n\nAnother potent cause of decline is habitat degradation. Unfortunately poor land management practices have been the norm historically in Australia. Complete clearing of riparian (river bank) vegetation, stock trampling river banks, and massive siltation from these poor practices as well as poor practices in the catchment, can severely degrade and silt coastal rivers to the point of being uninhabitable for Australian bass. The Bega River in southern New South Wales is a particularly salutory example of a coastal river so stripped of riparian vegetation and so silted with coarse granitic sands from poor land management practices, that the majority of it is now completely uninhabitable by Australian bass and other native fish.\n\nAs a slow-growing fish, Australian bass are vulnerable to overfishing, and overfishing has been a driver of decline in Australian bass stocks in past decades. However, the situation has improved markedly now the majority of fishermen are practicing catch and release with Australian bass.\n\nHatchery breeding and stocking of Australian bass is used to create fisheries above dams and weirs but these are causing concern over genetic diversity issues, use of bass broodfish from different genetic strains, and introduction/translocation of unwanted pest fish species in stockings. Stockings can also mask and divert attention away from serious habitat degradation and decline of wild stocks in catchments.\n\nFishing for Australian bass is a summertime affair, undertaken during the warmer months in the freshwater reaches of the rivers they inhabit. Australian bass are keenly fished for as they are an outstanding sportsfish, extraordinarily fast and powerful for their size. Their extraordinary speed and power is probably due to their significant, strenuous annual migrations for spawning and a life-style that is migratory in general. Australian bass in their natural river habitats are not to be underestimated; they head straight for the nearest snags (sunken timber) when hooked and light but powerful tackle and stiff drag settings are needed to stop them.\n\nAs mentioned above, during the day Australian bass generally remain close to or in cover (e.g. snags, overhanging trees), and small plug lures and flies cast close to such cover are used. Australian bass will strike at a very large variety of lures from diving minnow-style hard-bodied lures to slowly jigged soft plastic baits, as well as various surface lures such as poppers and surface walkers. In recent years fly fishing for Australian bass using surface flies imitating cicadas has proven to be extremely effective. At night Australian bass are a roaming pelagic feeder and surface lures (which waddle or fizz across the surface of the water) are used.\n\nSome of the best Australian bass fishing is coastal rivers and tributaries where access is difficult. Fishing these more remote locations can be extremely rewarding both for the fishing and the scenery. Fishing the more remote bass water is therefore usually the domain of the hardened backpacking fisherman or the dedicated kayak fisherman willing to drag his kayak over numerous logs and other obstacles.\n\nIt pays for fishermen to remember that wild Australian bass are still a highly migratory when in the freshwater reaches of rivers, and can also be an extremely wary fish in these habitats, much more so than exotic trout species.\n\nAustralian bass fishermen almost exclusively practice catch and release, which is necessary for the preservation of wild Australian bass stocks. The use of barbless hooks (which can be created by crushing the barbs flat with a pair of needle-nosed pliers) is essential as Australian bass hit lures with great ferocity and are consequently almost impossible to unhook on barbed hooks without serious injury to the fish. Conversely, Australian bass are swiftly and easily released if barbless hooks are used.\n\nResponsible fishermen now avoid fishing for wild Australian bass in estuaries in winter, so that this increasingly pressured native fish can spawn in peace. In 2014 the NSW Fisheries Department announced an extended closed season for Australian bass and estuary perch, from 1 May to 31 August.\n\n\n"}

Having established its own local government in 1991, the region's self-declared independence remains unrecognized by any country or international organization. It contains the colors of green, white and red, with a black star located in the centre. On the green stripe, there is the Sunni Shahada in white script. \n\nThe Constitution of Somaliland, as approved on May 31, 2001 by referendum, states at Article 7, that ‘the flag of the Republic of Somaliland shall consist of three horizontal, parallel and equal sections, the top section, which is coloured green and has inscribed in its midst in white in Arabic language \"La Ilaha Ill-Allah, Muhammadan Rasulullah\" (Arabic: لا إله إلاَّ الله محمد رسول الله, “There is no god except for Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah”); the middle section is white and has at its centre a black star; and the bottom section is coloured red.’\n\nThe government set out principles on how to use the flag. It should be treated with respect and used very carefully and sensitivity. Because the Shahada has huge importance in Islam, the first pillar of Islam \"etc\", regulations have specially been made on the usage of the flag.\n\nIt is forbidden for Somalis to fly the flag at half mast because it has the Shahada (which says in Arabic \"There is no other god except God, Muhammad is the Messenger of God\") written on it so it will be an un-Islamic and disrespectful way to treat the flag. Even if the President or someone with a high Somaliland governmental status dies, the flag does not fly at half-mast. When the second President of Somaliland Muhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal died, he received a state funeral and thousands of Somalis flocked to witness his funeral and mourn his death but the flag of Somaliland was raised at full mast instead of the traditional half-mast gesture. Moreover, if a person is seen lowering the flag at half-mast, they might be taken to jail or to court and it would be considered as a criminal offense. Similar rules, for the same reason, also apply to the flags of Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia and Iraq.\n\nAlthough the aforementioned Article 7 clearly states that the bottom of the flag is red, some little versions have been seen with a clear orange color instead. Another variation is the orientation of the star, many Somaliland flags have the star pointing the opposite direction from other flags, this upside-down star version is used quite widely.\nMost Somaliland flags are of the ratio 2:1. It is based on the official ratio of the Union Flag of the United Kingdom, the former colonial power. Pictures of flags on the internet etc. often erroneously show a shorter flag (of ratio 2:3 etc.).\n\nWhen the British annexed and occupied northwestern present-day Somalia in 1903, they established a protectorate and made it part of the British Empire. The British adopted a new flag for the region (officially named \"British Somaliland\"). Like many Commonwealth countries, the flag had a defaced Blue Ensign: a blue field with the Union Flag in the upper hoist quarter of the flag. There was an image of a Kudu (an antelope native to the British Somaliland area) on a white disc. The flag was flown on ships owned by residents of British Somaliland or on government buildings in the territory.\n\nIn 1950 The Protectorate of British Somaliland's badge and flag changed and thus all flags which bore it. The flag still had the Union flag on the quarter-hoist. The Kudu's head and shoulders were retained and taken off to form the most dominant feature on the new arms, although the antelope's face was now looking straight out at the observer. Between its horns, the Royal crown was inserted to symbolize the Royal family and the British Empire in general.\n\nThe badge was changed as well; it consisted of an escutcheon divided vertically into green and blue colours, having a chief with a golden Somali shield in front of two spears in saltire, heads downwards, in natural colours. The green portion contained an image of a white minaret. Moreover, on the blue quarter, an Arabian dhow in full sail on waves of the sea, with a golden anchor in the base. The Kudu's head was facing forward to the observer instead of facing left on the earlier version. Above, the Kudu was the Royal Crown between the horns. Underneath, there was a wreath coloured in green and yellow which formed the Crest.\n\nWhen British Somaliland was granted independence on 26 June 1960 the flag ceased being used.\n"}

Insular Italy encompasses two of the country's 20 regions: Sardinia and Sicily.\n\nInsular Italy occupies one-sixth of the national territory in surface area. Territorially, both Sicily and Sardinia include several minor islands and archipelagoes administratively dependent on the mother islands.\n\nSicily is the largest island in the Mediterranean (25,708 km) and one of the largest of Europe, while Sardinia is only slightly less extensive (24,090 km). The lowlands are generally limited in the geographic region and generally appear as narrow coastal belts. The only exceptions are the Campidano and Nurra in Sardinia and the Plain of Catania in Sicily that extend 1200 km and 430 km respectively. The rest of the area is prevalently hilly, with hills occupying 70% of the territory. Sicily is home to Mount Etna, Italy's highest non-Alpine peak and Europe's largest active volcano. Sardinia is home to the Gennargentu mountain range.\n\nThe population of Insular Italy totals combined over 6.7 million residents. Insular Italy has a population density of less than half the national average mainly because of the scarce population of Sardinia, one of the least densely populated regions of Italy and Europe. Sicily, on the other hand, has in fact a population density five times as high as Sardinia.\n\nOverall, their combined populations total just one-tenth of the national population, making Insular Italy the least populated macro-region of the country.\n\nThe Gross domestic product (GDP) of the region was 123.9 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 7% of Italy's economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 18,500 euros or 62% of the EU27 average in the same year.\n\nThe unemployment rate of Sicily is the highest in the country at 11.9%, while in Sardinia between 2006-07 it dropped for the first time below 10%, reaching 8.6%, the lowest of all the Mezzogiorno regions, excluding Molise and Abruzzo.\n\nThe low level of entrepreneurship in Sicily is tied to the local organized criminal activity, while in Sardinia it results from the rather expensive operating expenses (electricity, transportation, etc.), which are 20-50% higher than other regions due to its peripheral location from the Italian mainland and the lack of a proper territorial continuity (\"continuità territoriale\"). Such condition has been reduced in Sardinia with the development of information technologies, like Tiscali, low-cost carrier, like Ryanair, and some laws regarding fares and routes between the islands and mainland Italy.\n\n"}

Bidwill (born December 6, 1964) is an American businessman, prosecutor, and football executive who is the principal owner, chairman, and president of the Arizona Cardinals of the National Football League (NFL). After practicing law for six years as a federal prosecutor, he joined the Arizona Cardinals organization in 1996 as Vice President/General Counsel.\n\nBidwill inherited the team from his father, Bill Bidwill, who was at least part-owner from 1962 until his death in 2019.\n\nMichael Bidwill grew up the second of five children in his family, and is the third generation of his family to own the Cardinals. His grandfather, Charles Bidwill, bought the Cardinals in 1933, while they were still in Chicago. When Charles died in 1947, his widow, Violet, inherited the team, moving it to St. Louis in 1960. Upon Violet's death, ownership passed to father Bill and uncle Charles Bidwill, Jr., with Bill becoming sole owner in 1971. Only the Chicago Bears (owned by the Halas-McCaskey family since 1921) and New York Giants (owned by the Mara family since their founding in 1925) have been in the hands of the family longer than the Cardinals.\n\nMichael began to enjoy American football when he visited the Cardinals' training camp for the first time in 1969. In 1974, Bidwill's father, Bill, made him one of the team's ball boys including his brothers William Jr., Patrick and Tim. Said Bidwill in 2007: \"I understood at a young age that when you don't win, there will be criticism.\" Michael Bidwill attended Georgetown Prep and later earned a Bachelor of Science degree in finance from Saint Louis University in 1987 where he was a member of Phi Delta Theta. Later, he graduated from the Columbus School of Law at Catholic University in 1990. \n\nMichael followed the Cardinals to Phoenix in 1988. From 1990 to 1996, Michael was a federal prosecutor in Phoenix.\n\nWhile the Cardinals struggled to fill Sun Devil Stadium, Bidwill publicly stated that fans would respond in greater numbers if given a better environment. He additionally emphasized that the team could not compete without the revenue streams a new stadium would bring. The Cardinals have sold out all 100 games played since the stadium opened in 2006. They sold out 12 total games in 18 seasons at Sun Devil Stadium. In nine seasons at State Farm Stadium, the Cardinals have won their conference once, their division three times, earned three playoff berths and finished .500 or better in 6 of 9. They had two seasons of .500 or better in their 18 seasons (1988-2006) since their arrival in Arizona from St. Louis before moving into State Farm Stadium.\n\nIn October 2014, Cardinals general manager Steve Keim called Bidwill \"the glue that holds the organization together.\" Quarterback Carson Palmer said \"It's easy to say it's the head coach or the GM. It's the owner,\" Palmer said. \"And you would never know it. He doesn't want to be here when the media's here. He's not doing interviews left and right, but he's picked the right people to hire and he wants to win. … He doesn't have a hand in every decision, cutting this guy, bringing in this guy. He's hired the right people, and he knows it.\"\n\nIn July 2018, Bidwill announced his support for longtime friend and fellow Georgetown Prep classmate Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court Justice nominee. The move generated controversy, as Bidwill used the Arizona Cardinals website and social media outlets to voice his support. This came just two months after NFL owners voted to restrict NFL players' ability to protest during the national anthem.\n\nAfter his father Bill Bidwill's death in October 2019, Michael Bidwill added the title of chairman of the Cardinals to his role with the team.\n\nIn addition to his role with the Cardinals, Bidwill has been active in the greater Phoenix business community where he has been an advocate for economic growth and development.\n\nFrom 2008 to 2010, Bidwill served back-to-back terms as Chairman of Greater Phoenix Economic Council (GPEC). He is also a board member of Greater Phoenix Leadership (GPL), an organization composed of the region's top business and civic leaders. In July 2011, Bidwill and 16 business leaders in the state were appointed to the Arizona Commerce Authority Board of Directors. Michael is also a member of the board for the Pat Tillman Foundation, which carries on the legacy of the former Cardinals safety killed in Afghanistan in 2004.\n\nIn 2010, Bidwill was selected by the Phoenix Business Journal as one of its 25 \"Most Admired CEO's.\" In 2009, he received the Leader for Tomorrow award from the Boy Scouts of America.\n\nIn 2014, it was announced that Bidwill was named the chair of the league's new conduct committee. Composed of representatives of NFL ownership, the committee will review the league's Personal Conduct Policy at least annually and recommend appropriate changes with advice from outside experts. He also chairs the NFL's Security and Fan Conduct Committee, a group of eight club executives that oversees and develops best security practices for NFL facilities. He also serves on the board of the National Football League Foundation, which in 2013 awarded more than $23 million in grants to support youth and high school football programs, health and safety efforts, as well as community health initiatives. Bidwill has also been a member of the league's Business Ventures Committee since 2007 when Commissioner Roger Goodell appointed him to it.\n\nBidwill serves on Arizona's Super Bowl Host Committee. The group oversaw the successful staging of Super Bowl XLII at University of Phoenix Stadium in 2008. It also brought Super Bowl XLIX, which was played on February 1, 2015 and its half billion dollar economic impact to the state. Super Bowl XLIX was played at University of Phoenix Stadium on February 1, 2015. After the 2015 game, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said, \"Arizona earned it … this community has wrapped their arms around every opportunity and made the Super Bowl even bigger and better for our fans and for the NFL over all,\" Goodell said at his annual Super Bowl news conference. \"We're thrilled about being here, and we look forward to coming back.\"\n\nA January 2014 poll in the Phoenix Business Journal asked \"what business leader had the best 2013?\" Michael Bidwill finished first with 34% of the vote.\n\nBidwill has an airplane pilot's license, which he's had since he was 19.

It is set in on the banks of the River Orwell. Built in 1776 for William Berners by the architect John Johnson of Leicestershire, it is an outstanding example of English Palladian architecture and is a Grade I listed building while associated buildings are Grade II. In the 1950s, it housed Woolverstone Hall School, a boarding school operated by London County Council (LCC).\n\nIt has been speculated that a Viking chieftain named Wulf sacrificed a native villager on a glacial monolithic stone, giving rise to the name \"Wulf's stone\". Domesday Book recorded two manors in the area which were merged in the 13th century and presided over by a succession of families until 1773 when it was purchased for £14,000 by William Berners (died 1783). William Berners owned Berners Street in London, which became known later for the Berners Street Hoax. He erected Woolverstone Hall in 1776. A high obelisk was erected in 1793 to William's memory by his son, Charles Berners (1767–1831), High Sheriff of Suffolk, which was damaged and demolished during World War II. In 1823, alterations and additions were done by Thomas Hoppe, including side wings.\n\nThe estate passed to Charles's brother and, in the 1880s, Henry Denny Berners, LL.B., Archdeacon of Suffolk, resided at Woolverstone Hall. His son John became the next owner, followed in 1886 by John's brother, Hugh Berners (died 1891), a Royal Navy captain. The estate became the seat of Charles Hugh Berners, High Steward for Harwich, Essex, great-grandson of William Berners. The manor was sold to Oxford University in 1937. It was requisitioned as a naval training establishment during World War II and, in 1950, the London County Council took it over as a boys' boarding school--Woolverstone Hall School. In 1992, the property was sold to the Girls' Day School Trust, who relocated Ipswich High School to Woolverstone Hall.\n\nWoolverstone Hall became a Grade I listed building on 22 February 1955.\n\nWoolverstone Hall comprises a central block with flanking wings connected by colonnades. The central block is of three storeys: a rusticated basement, first floor and attic, and has at its front centre a pediment supported by four Ionic columns. The house is built of Woolpit brick, with Coade stone ornamentation. The main living areas were originally in the central block while the wings contained offices, the kitchen, larders, laundry room, and a brewhouse. A 20th-century renovation added two-storey single-bay links to wings, and the attic.\n\nInternally, the building still contains the original Adam style fireplaces and ceilings decorated with gold leaf. The modest staircase has a wrought-iron honeysuckle balustrade. \n\nThe apartments contain a collection of paintings by ancient and modern artists. The music room has been converted to a library.\n\nOriginally situated in a 400-acre wooded park extending to the River Orwell, it sat opposite Orwell Park, and contained a herd of fallow deer. The curved front offers views of the river and the Nacton shore. \n\n"}

This Swedish dish has almost as many variants as households in Piteå, but they have in common a mix of wheat and barley flour (whereas other variants of potato palt may use other flours such as rye, or exclude the barley), and can have either other filling than pork, like minced meat, or none at all, then referred to as flatpalt.\nAll palt is made of raw potatoes, while the dumplings made out of pre-boiled potatoes are referred to as kroppkakor. This gives the pitepalt a darker color in comparison.\n\n\n"}

It is open during daylight hours without admission charge.\n\nThe arboretum was established in 1972 mainly through the efforts of Ernest Bauer, Professor L. R. Quinlan (landscape architect at Kansas State University), and Bill Flynn (nurseryman from Abilene). Quinlan said that they had discussed the idea of a local landscape arboretum for 40 years before it became possible to gain support from the federal government. The United States Army Corps of Engineers project to create Milford Reservoir, the largest man-made lake in Kansas, created an opportunity for the arboretum, and in 1969 an organization was incorporated under the name Kansas Landscape Arboretum, sponsored by the Kansas State Horticultural Society. In 1972, the organization signed a lease with the Corps for 193 acres of land, and began planting native Kansas plants and creating recreational trails. The arboretum was formally dedicated on May 29, 1976.\n\nWhen initially leased, the arboretum contained only 24 varieties of trees, shrubs, and flowers. It now includes about 1,000 species of native and exotic woody plants including green ash, crabapple, honey locust, juniper, maple, oak, osage-orange, pine, American sycamore, and black walnut. More than 260 of these species are identified with plaques along the Memorial Tree Walk. Much of the area is left in native vegetation. To maintain the overall \"naturalness\" of the views, trees with unusual or colorful foliage or particularly distinctive shapes (like \"weeping\" trees) are planted in a special display section. There are three short walking trails available, including a Bird Sanctuary Walk with stumps to sit on for bird-watching. The arboretum includes a view of Milford Lake.\n\n\n"}

The plot follows a deranged man recently released from a psychiatric institution who opens an ice cream factory where he begins using human flesh in his recipes.\n\nThe film had an estimated $2 million budget and was released direct-to-video, and in recent years has developed a cult following among viewers who see it as an unintentional comedy, and enjoy it for its campy production values. Joe Bob Briggs hosted the film on TNT, when it was shown on MonsterVision. Howard himself made an appearance, discussing the film with Briggs. It was released on DVD in 2004.\n\nIn a black-and-white prologue, a young boy witnesses the murder of an ice cream man in a small town.\n\nYears later, the boy, named Gregory Tudor (Clint Howard), returns to the town to become an ice cream man himself, having spent the intervening years in a mental hospital. Gregory is not entirely well after his release, however, and murders a garbage picker who triggers memories of his time in the hospital. He kills some people (and a dog), all while doing his duties as ice cream man, leading to suspicion from local kids and the police. The ice cream man even goes so far as to graphically mix parts of people he has killed into his frozen treats, making his customers unwitting cannibals.\n\n\nOn October 9, 2014, a Kickstarter campaign backed by star Clint Howard was started to fund a sequel entitled \"Ice Cream Man 2: Sundae Bloody Sundae\" to coincide with the film's 20th anniversary. However the campaign was closed on October 30, 2014, after only 70 backers and just over $4,000 was made, nowhere near the $300,000 goal. However, it is stated that the project has not been abandoned and stated that they are looking for a new crowdfunding structure and alternative financing for the film. There is no current news on the filming of the movie.\n\n"}

It was directed by Carpenter, Hooper and Larry Sulkis. It first aired on 8 August 1993. It is notable for its numerous celebrity cameo appearances.\n\nThe first story, \"The Gas Station\", features Robert Carradine as a serial killer, with cameos by David Naughton, Sam Raimi, and Wes Craven. \"Hair\" follows Stacy Keach as he receives a botched hair transplant that infests him with an alien parasite. \"Eye\" is another transplant story, this time featuring Mark Hamill as a baseball player who loses an eye in a car accident and receives a transplant, only to be taken over by the personality of the eye's previous owner, a murderous killer.\n\nA creepy-looking coroner introduces three different horror tales involving his current work on cadavers in \"body bags\".\n\nAnne is a young college student who arrives for her first job working the night shift at an all-night filling station near Haddonfield, Illinois (a reference to the setting of Carpenter's two \"Halloween\" films). The leaving worker, Bill, reminds her that a serial killer has broken out of a mental hospital, and cautions her not to leave the booth at the station without the keys because the door locks automatically. After Bill leaves, Anne is alone and the tension mounts as she deals with various late-night customers seeking to buy gas for a quick fill-up, purchase cigarettes or just use the restroom key, unsure whether any of them might be the escaped maniac. A homeless transient asks to use the restroom, and when a partying couple arrives, she asks the man to check on the bum. He says he's sleeping. After the couple leaves, Annie goes inside the men's restroom, only to find an elaborately grotesque drawing on an evil looking entity carrying beheaded people in the restroom and then the dead body of the homeless man sitting in a pickup truck on the lift in one of the garage bays. She makes a phone call for help which results in her realization that \"Bill\", the attending worker she met earlier, is in fact the escaped killer, who has killed the real Bill and is killing numerous passers-by. She finds the real Bill's dead body in one of the lockers. Serial killer \"Bill\" then reappears and attempts to kill Anne with a machete, breaking into the locked booth by smashing out the glass with a sledgehammer and then chasing her around the deserted garage. Just as he is about to kill her, a customer named Pete returns, having forgotten his credit card, and he wrestles the killer, giving Anne time to crush the maniac under the vehicle lift.\n\nRichard Coberts is a middle-aged businessman who is very self-conscious about his thinning hair. This obsession has caused a rift between him and his long-suffering girlfriend Megan. Richard answers a television ad about a \"miracle\" hair transplant procedure, pays a visit to the office, and meets the shady Dr. Lock, who agrees to give Richard a solution to make his hair grow back. The next day, Richard wakes up and removes the bandage around his head, and is overjoyed to find that he has a full head of hair. But soon he becomes increasingly sick and fatigued, and finds his hair continuing to grow and, additionally, growing out of parts of his body, where hair does not normally grow. Trying to cut a hair off his mouth, he finds that it \"screams\", and, examining it under a magnifying glass, sees that it's alive and resembles a tiny serpent. He goes back to Dr. Lock for an explanation, but finds himself a prisoner as Dr. Lock explains that he and his entire staff are aliens from another planet, seeking out narcissistic human beings and planting seeds of \"hair\" to take over their bodies for consumption as part of their plan to spread their essence to Earth. Soon after this reveal, according to the coroner, he jumps off of the building on top of a moving car and then dragged by a moving train.\n\nBrent Matthews is a baseball player whose life and career take a turn for the worse when he gets into a serious car accident in which his right eye is gouged out. Unwilling to admit that his career is over, he jumps at the chance to undergo an experimental surgical procedure to replace his eye with one from a recently deceased person. But soon after the surgery he begins to see things out of his new eye that others cannot see, and begins having nightmares of killing women and having sex with them. Brent seeks out the doctor who operated on him, and the doctor tells him that the donor of his new eye was a recently executed serial killer and necrophile who killed several young women, and then had sex with their dead bodies. Brent becomes convinced that the spirit of the dead killer is taking over his body so that he can resume killing women. He flees back to his house and tells his skeptical wife, Cathy, about what is happening. Just then the spirit of the killer emerges and attempts to kill Cathy as well. Cathy fights back, subduing him long enough for Brent to re-emerge. Realizing that it is only a matter of time before the killer emerges again, Brent stabs his donated eye with garden scissors, severing his link with the killer, but then bleeds to death.\n\nThe coroner is finishing telling his last tale when he hears a noise from outside the morgue. He crawls back inside a body bag, revealing that he himself is a living cadaver, as two other morgue workers begin to go to work on his \"John Doe\" corpse.\n\n\n\nShowtime Networks planned to create \"Body Bags\" as a television series similar to HBO's \"Tales from the Crypt\". However, shortly after filming began, Showtime decided not to pursue the series. The three completed stories were assembled around John Carpenter's narration segment, and \"Body Bags\" became a horror anthology.\n\nThe film was released on Blu-ray in Shout Factory!'s Scream Factory series in late fall 2013.\n\n\"Body Bags\" was generally well received by critics and holds a 67% approval rating on movie review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 12 reviews with an average score of 5.56/10.\n\nHowever, \"Time Out\" (London, UK) called the film \"an attempt by a pair of one-time horror auteurs to emulate the successful \"Tales from the Crypt\" formula, only now it's nowhere near as happening.\"\n\n\n"}

It is one of only four provincial capitals of Indonesia without a city status. It is also the administrative seat of Manokwari Regency. Majority of Manokwari residents are Christians and the town is one of the seats of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Manokwari–Sorong. \n\nOn 25 October 1793, Captain John Hayes in the merchant ships \"Duke of Clarence\" and \"Duchess\" raised the British flag at Dore Bay, which he called Restoration Bay as he had put in there to restore his crews' health) and claimed it and the surrounding area, which he called New Albion, for Great Britain. The British established a small settlement there to engage in the spice trade, especially in massoy bark and nutmeg. The British erected a small stockade fort, Fort Coronation, named in honour of King George III's coronation. For a variety of reasons the British East India Company, including changing priorities consequent on the outbreak of war with France, did not support the settlement. The settlement was not a success and in 1795 the British abandoned it.\n\nOn 12 April 1942, a Japanese convoy steamed into Dore Bay and began landing approximately 4,000 men. The area was already well known to the Japanese, as the area was the location of a cotton plantation developed by the government-sponsored \"Nan’yō Kōhatsu\" development company from the early 1930s. At the beginning of 1942, the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL) garrison at Manokwari consisted of approximately 125 KNIL troops, which included a number of civilians reservists and home guard who had been called up at the start of February 1942. As the KNIL ground force had no chance of successfully engaging the Japanese invasion force, it withdrew into the interior of Dutch New Guinea and initiated guerilla warfare.\n\nAt 4:43am on 4 January 2009 a magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck Manokwari. Felt as far away as Australia, the 35 km deep earthquake killed four people, injured 19 more and 167,000 people were left without power. Local residents were evacuated to Manokwari Military Academy in order to seek shelter from possible tsunamis and aftershocks that were felt throughout the day. Damage occurred to the Mutiara Hotel, the Naval hospital, and several other buildings. Manokwari Regional Airport had significant damage, being closest to the epicenter, and all four deaths resulted there. The Indonesian government sent a team of seven doctors to Manokwari to assist with the injured. Originally, the team was projected to be ten people, but due to the severe damage of the runway only seven were able to be transported in. This was not unlike the previous quakes on 10 October 2002 when another 7.6 magnitude quake shook the region. In 1996 similar quakes also halted progress in the local region but there is no record of the recorded magnitude.\n\nOn 14 April 2010, Merpati Nusantara Airlines flight MZ 836, a Boeing 737-300 (registration PK-MDF) with 103 persons on board, broke into pieces as it bounced off the tarmac at Rendani Airport near Manokwari after landing in poor weather. The tail of the aircraft broke off and came to rest in the creek off the northern end of Runway 35. All passengers survived, but 21 injured people were admitted to hospital. The flight originated in Sorong, West Papua.\n\nOn 21 August 2019, Manokwari experienced a violent protest which saw the provincial legislature building torched, with the protest being part of the 2019 Papua protests.\n\nManokwari is three meters above sea level on the coast of West Papua.

The annual sunshine hours are 2127; an average of 5.8 hours of sunlight per day. To date, there are no recorded days of frost or snowfall in Manokwari.\n\nThere are over twenty-four different tribal groups living in Manokwari. Each tribe has its own unique language and culture. The most prominent of the tribal groups are the Asmat and the Dani tribes people. The traditional house of Papua is the Honai, a rounded house made of a wood and grass roof covering. Due to the variety of cultures in Manokwari, several different regional instruments have been popularized to include the Atowo, Tifa and the Fu. Manokwari is an urbanized region, but in several of the regencies you can still find traditional garb. A Koteka is a hollowed out gourd used by tribesmen to cover their genitals. These tribal people are well known for their wooden sculptures of virility and beauty. These sculptures are sold both locally and globally and are part of Manokwari's exports. Among the other tribes are Kuri, Simuri, Irarutu, Sebyar, Mascona, Mairasi, Kambouw, Onim, Sekar, Maibrat, Tohit, Imeko, Moi, Tipin, Maya, and Biak.\n\nThe State University of Papua was established on 3 November 2000. This university was created to help with the local education of the people of Papua. Among their achievements is the \"Beccariana\", an academic journal published by the university. This publication contains all the research done by the university in the field of herbalism. The university is strategically located on a hill facing the town, surrounded by a dense tropical rain forest. This allows the researchers instant access to the biological samples and case studies.\n\nSister cities of Manokwari are:\n\nThe land flatworm \"Platydemus manokwari\" was named after the town (where it was found) by French zoologist de Beauchamp in 1962.\n\nOne tourist site is the white, sandy Doreri Bay Beach which has calm, shallow water and is very safe for swimming.\nArfak range nature reserve in the south of Manokwari is a popular tourist destination for visitors who are interested in hiking, birding and wildlife watching. Tropical rainforest that covers most of the mountains is the natural habitat of various species of animals including cuscus possum, lesser birds of paradise, common paradise kingfisher, magnificent riflebird as well as king bird of paradise.

It was released direct to video on 24 March 1993.\n\nPhilip (David Naughton) and Alexandria (India Allen) are a married couple that have decided to spend their vacation at a friend's house in the Arizona desert. Their marriage has hit a rough patch due to Philip's work, which has monopolized his time and left Alexandra feeling lonely. Additionally, Alex is encouraged to cheat on her husband by a close friend, which she considers. She's further dismayed when she finds that Philip is still too busy to pay attention to her and pushes him to go to a night bar.\n\nOnce there the two quickly run into some trouble with a biker, but are saved from harm by Randall (Gary Hudson) and Maggie (Michelle Moffett). They give the two a ride to a trailer park, unaware that Randall is there to get revenge against his ex-girlfriend Celeste (Kathy Shower), who sent him to jail, and that Maggie is a prostitute that Randall has brought along by force. Randall manages to break into the trailer, which terrifies Celeste. Despite his assurances that he is not there to harm her, Randall forces Maggie to kill Celeste.\n\nThe following morning the two arrive at Alexandria and Philip's vacation home, as Randall had promised to help Philip look for plants for his job. The two men leave to look for plants, only for Randall to push Philip off a cliff. Believing the man to be dead, Randall drives off, unaware that Philip survived and has begun walking back in order to rescue his wife. Meanwhile, back at the house, Alexandria has grown increasingly suspicious that Maggie is a wanted criminal, and at one point tries to call the police, but is interrupted by Maggie. When Randall returns without Philip, Alexandria, driven by a desire to survive and a desire to have an extramarital affair with a dangerous, sexy man, tries to turn the couple against one another by having sex with them both. After having sex with Randall, and realizing she really enjoyed it, Alexandra attempts to run away with him, but to no avail.\n\nOn his way back to the house, Philip finds his way to Celeste's trailer park and discovers her dead body. Soon after, he is found by the town's Sheriff Brenner (Paul Gleason), who takes Philip back to the vacation house after hearing his story. They arrive at the house and sneak into it in an attempt to save Alexandria. Maggie, who has decided that she is no longer going to follow Randall, is accidentally shot by the sheriff, who is then killed by Randall. Randall then tries to chase after Alexandria, only for her to later turn the tables on him and shoot him. Finally safe, Philip and Alexandria embrace.\n\n\"TV Guide\" panned the film for its lack of plot and wrote \"Director Jag Mundhra made one of the better direct-to-video sex thrillers, \"NIGHT EYES\", in 1990, but never learned the lesson that a good script is the best aphrodisiac.\" Allmovie also rated the film poorly and gave it one star.\n"}

He spent his entire playing career with AS Monaco, before becoming manager of the club, leading them to the league title in his first full season in charge. He has also managed Lille, Lyon and Nice in Ligue 1, and Southampton and Leicester City in England's Premier League.\n\nPuel started his football career as a youth with Castres FC, where he was spotted by AS Monaco, joining their training centre in 1977. He played his first professional game in the 1979–80 season. He spent his entire career at Monaco, playing 601 official matches in total. During his time at Monaco, he won two championships and three French Cups. He also played under compatriot Arsène Wenger who jovially recalled being on the wrong end of a sliding tackle saying \"Even on the morning of a Cup final he could tackle and even if it was the manager then no problem!\".\n\nBefore being appointed as the manager of Monaco, he was the physical trainer and manager of Monaco's reserve team. He was appointed as the manager in January 1999. He won the French Championship in 2000, with players such as Ludovic Giuly and Marcelo Gallardo. In July 2001, his contract was not renewed and he left Monaco after 24 years at the club as a player and a coach.\n\nIn July 2002, he was appointed manager of Lille, where he became one of the longest serving coaches in the French league, serving for six consecutive seasons.\n\nLille were one of the winners of the 2004 UEFA Intertoto Cup, having defeated U.D. Leiria of Portugal 2–0 in extra time in the final after a goalless aggregate draw.\n\nPuel joined Olympique Lyonnais, the team who had won the last seven French league titles, on a four-year contract on 18 June 2008. In 2010, he helped the club reach the semi-final of the Champions League for the first time in its history. In his final game in charge in May 2011, he defeated his former club Monaco and ended their 34-year spell in the top flight. Lyon terminated his contract on 20 June 2011, although he had just finished third, as he had not won a trophy in his three seasons.\n\nOn 23 May 2012, Puel reached agreement on a three-year deal with OGC Nice.\n\nOn 30 June 2016, Puel was appointed the manager of Southampton on a three-year deal. On 14 June 2017, Puel's contract was \"terminated with immediate effect\". His sacking yielded mixed reactions. In his only season in charge, Southampton reached the League Cup final and recorded an 8th-place finish in the Premier League, albeit with 17 fewer points than his predecessor Ronald Koeman attained the season prior. Puel was particularly criticised for his defensive tactics, with Southampton's scoring record one of the poorest in the league. Sports journalist Paul Doyle called Puel \"a victim of Southampton's admirably unreasonable expectations\".\n\nOn 25 October 2017, Puel was appointed as the new manager of struggling Premier League side Leicester City, replacing recently sacked Craig Shakespeare, on a contract running until June 2020. His first game in charge came on 29 October, when they beat Everton 2–0 in the Premier League.\n\nFrom 31 January 2018 until the end of the season, Leicester recorded only three wins from 14 league games, a dismal run that saw Puel accused of negative football. His decision to block Riyad Mahrez's transfer to Manchester City on deadline day resulted in the player going absent from training for ten days. Puel joined Leicester in 13th place and helped the club climb up the table to finish in ninth position. After the season concluded, it was speculated that Puel would be leaving the club, though he continued as manager.\n\nA shock 2–1 FA Cup third round defeat to League Two Newport County on 6 January 2019, in which Puel was jeered by Leicester fans for fielding an understrength side, was voted by BBC viewers as the biggest upset of the competition. Having gone six league games without a win, Puel was sacked by Leicester on 24 February 2019, following a defeat at home to Crystal Palace the previous day.\n\nOn 4 October 2019, Puel returned to Ligue 1 when he was appointed as AS Saint-Étienne's new manager, on a contract lasting until 2022. Two days later was his first match, the \"Derby du Rhône\" against his former team Lyon, and won 1–0 at home with a last-minute goal by substitute Robert Beric.\n\nPuel's team beat reigning champions Rennes in the semi-finals of the Coupe de France on 5 March 2020, to reach the final for the first time since 1982.\n\nPuel has two sons and a daughter.

In the wake of anti-Jewish pogroms in Poland, his family fled to the United States, settling in New York City in 1907. Davidson received bachelor's and master's degrees at Columbia University in 1919 and 1920 respectively.

Christie.\n\nAll 16 volumes have been published. For the first time an animal class will have all the species illustrated and treated in detail in a single work. This has not been done before for any other group in the animal kingdom.\n\nMaterial in each volume is grouped first by family, with an introductory article on each family; this is followed by individual species accounts (taxonomy, subspecies and distribution, descriptive notes, habitat, food and feeding, breeding, movements, status and conservation, bibliography). In addition, all volumes except the first and second contain an essay on a particular ornithological theme. More than 200 renowned specialists and 35 illustrators (including Toni Llobet, Hilary Burn, Chris Rose and H. Douglas Pratt) from more than 40 countries have contributed to the project up to now, as well as 834 photographers from all over the world.\n\nSince the first volume appeared in 1992, the series has received various international awards. The first volume was selected as Bird Book of the Year by the magazines \"Birdwatch\" and \"British Birds\", and the fifth volume was recognised as Outstanding Academic Title by \"Choice Magazine\", the American Library Association magazine. The seventh volume, as well as being named Bird Book of the Year by \"Birdwatch\" and \"British Birds\", also received the distinction of Best Bird Reference Book in the 2002 WorldTwitch Book Awards This same distinction was also awarded to Volume 8 a year later in 2003.\n\nIndividual volumes are large, measuring , and weighing between ; it has been commented in a review that \"fork-lift truck book\" would be a more appropriate title.\n\nAs a complement to the \"Handbook of the Birds of the World\" and with the ultimate goal of disseminating knowledge about the world's avifauna, in 2002 Lynx Edicions started the Internet Bird Collection (IBC).

AdZU began in 1912 as Escuela Catolica, a parochial school run by Spanish Jesuits. It is the second oldest Jesuit school in the Philippines and the second Jesuit school to be named Ateneo. It initially offered primary and secondary education for boys. It became a college in 1952 and a university in August 2001. It operates on two campuses, La Purisima Street with the tertiary and senior high school divisions and Barangay Tumaga, outside Zamboanga City proper, with the junior high school and grade school units.\n\nThe Ateneo de Zamboanga University began in 1912 as \"Escuela Catolica\", a parochial school run by Spanish Jesuits at the old site of the Immaculate Conception Church across from the Sunken Garden. Fr. Manuel M. Sauras, S.J., was the first director and served in that capacity up to 1926. Escuela Catolica served as the parochial school of the Immaculada Concepcion Parish headed by Fr. Miguel Saderra Mata, S.J. Classes were held on the ground floor of the rectory of the parish, which was adjacent to Plaza Pershing. While the curriculum was similar to that of the public elementary school, the Spanish Jesuits emphasized religious teaching alongside quality education. Catholic education later became a factor in the decision of the Jesuits to open a school that was empowered to issue the \"titulo oficial\" upon completion of studies.\n\nIn 1916, the Escuela Catolica expanded and became the Ateneo Elementary School. Its grade school opened that year with seven grades. The school name was changed to Ateneo de Zamboanga when its high school opened in 1928. High school classes were held on the top floor of the three-story Ateneo building along I. Magno corners P. Reyes and Urdaneta streets. The building was the Mindanao Theater, now the site of the City Theater. Five lay teachers and the Jesuit director made up the faculty. The elementary school occupied the lower floors. The first high school students graduated from Ateneo in 1932. The ten young male graduates belonged to Zamboanga City's crème de la crème, one of whom was Roseller T. Lim who would become the first Zamboangueño senator of the Philippines.\n\nThe American Jesuits took over from the Spanish Jesuits in 1930, with Fr. Thomas J. Murray, S.J., as the first American director. In 1932 the government gave official recognition to the high school.\n\nIn 1938, AdZU opened night classes in commerce and pre-law, thus pioneering its expansion to college, later interrupted by World War II. Pre-war Ateneo expanded with an enrollment of 230 in the grade school and 376 in the high school under Fr. Eusebio G. Salvador, S.J. A Zamboangueño and a product of Escuela Catolica, Fr. Salvador was the first Filipino director of AdZU. In 1938 a library was built on the first floor of the Knights of Columbus building. A façade, an auditorium, and an annex were also built. Fr. John Shinn, S.J., was appointed headmaster of the grade school and Fr. Francis X. Clark, S.J., became the principal and dean of discipline of the high school.\n\nThe school was closed during World War II when the Japanese used it as a public school until it was shelled and bombed by American forces on March 8 and 9 in 1945, before the liberation of the city.\n\nThe high school and intermediate classes (grades 5 and 6) reopened in 1946, in a nipa-sawali building on a new site outside of the poblacion called the Jardin de Chino near Camino Nuevo. It was providential that shortly before the outbreak of the war, Fr. Eusebio G. Salvador, S.J., had bought 18 adjoining lots in Jardin de Chino on Bailen Street (now La Purisima Street). In 1947 he bought an additional 1.5 hectares along Camino Nuevo St. adjoining the Bailen St. property to bring to a total of 4.3 hectares the La Purisima campus. Together with Frs. Kyran B. Egan and Cesar E. Maravilla, he reopened high school classes.\n\nIn 1949, Ateneo became independent of the Jesuit mission in Zamboanga, separating itself from the Immaculate Conception Cathedral. It was officially recognized as a Jesuit school apart from the parish. The post liberation years were a period of rapid physical, curricular, and enrollment expansion of the school. By 1949, AdZU underwent a major make-over. A solid structure of fine wood replaced the nipa-and-sawali classrooms. The gymnasium-auditorium (now Brebeuf Gymnasium) was constructed in 1950, making it the oldest structure on campus today.\n\nA college was established in 1952 and a graduate school in 1976.\n\nIn the years between 1946 and 1952, a total of 2,766 students graduated from high school. The college opened in 1952 with a two-year collegiate program, which offered pre-law courses and a degree in Associate in Arts. The college gradually expanded to include four-year bachelor's programs in the arts, commerce, education, and nursing. In 1956, the college and high school became separate departments.\n\nAdZ experienced a “building boom” beginning with the completion of the Jesuit Residence in 1959, Sacred Heart Chapel in 1961, Gonzaga Hall in 1964, and Canisius Hall in 1967. In 1972, the two one-storey grade school buildings, Berchmans and Kostka halls, were built. By the mid-70s, basic education was well established with an enrolment reaching 381 students in the grade school. In 1976, higher education expanded to include the graduate school which opened an MBA course, the first graduate program in business administration in Region IX. Soon after, other master's degrees followed: public administration, nursing, guidance and counselling, and education. These programs were offered under the guidance of Fr. Ernesto A. Carretero, S.J., the first president elected by the Board of Trustees of AdZ.\n\nIn the years that followed, more changes and developments took place. Campion Hall and Bellarmine Hall were built in 1979 and 1980. The Fr. Jose Ma. Rosauro, S.J., Center was finished in 1986. The Learning Resource Center was inaugurated in 1987 to accommodate the library, book center, audio-visual unit, and various offices. Fr. Carretero, S.J., obtained the PAASCU accreditation of the high school in 1975, the liberal arts and commerce in 1981, and education, nursing, and the grade school in 1982. AdZ attained Level III in the accreditation of these colleges, the highest rank given to tertiary schools in the Philippines at that time.\n\nIn 1984, girls were accepted for the first time in the grade school. Twenty-two girls were part of the grade six graduating class in 1992. They became the first batch of girls to study at the Ateneo High School in 1992.\n\nFr. Carretero, S.J., and after 1989 Fr. William H. Kreutz, S.J., Ateneo presidents, sought university status for the school. By this time and into the mid-90s the school had added undergraduate programs including accountancy, arts and sciences, business management, and computer science.\n\nIn 1994, a group of Zamboanga-based doctors entered into a consortium with the Ateneo de Zamboanga under Fr. Kreutz's presidency to establish a medical school named Zamboanga Medical School Foundation (ZMSF). It was on the La Purisima campus. In 2004, ZMSF was turned over to Ateneo. The medical school became the Ateneo de Zamboanga University School of Medicine. Partnering with the universities of Calgary, Laos, Nepal, and Cambodia, the School of Medicine uses problem-based learning and community-based approach to medical practice with emphasis on serving communities in Western Mindanao.\n\nOn August 20, 2001, AdZ was officially declared a university by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED). In the same year it was granted autonomous status by CHED, making Ateneo de Zamboanga University (AdZU) one of only thirty higher education institutions in the Philippines, and the only one in Western Mindanao, to be granted full deregulation and autonomy. The new College building and the Multi-Purpose Covered Courts were inaugurated in 2001.\n\nOn July 31, 2005, groundbreaking was held for the new high school building in Savanah, Tumaga, Zamboanga City. Fr. Kreutz's 18-year presidency came to a close together with the completion of the new campus in Tumaga, which was later named Fr. William H. Kreutz, S.J., campus. The high school was transferred to this new site in 2006 for school year 2006–2007.\n\nOn October 11, 2006, Fr. Antonio F. Moreno, S.J., was elected as the second president of the University, replacing Fr. William H. Kreutz, S.J. He assumed office on May 21, 2007, and was officially installed on September 22, 2007.\n\nMeanwhile, AdZU and Xavier University – Ateneo de Cagayan launched the Xavier University College of Law – Zamboanga on 25 June 2011. The College of Law is in a new four-storey building named in honor of Fr. Manuel Ma. Sauras, S.J. Sauras Hall is also home to the new university cafeteria.\n\nThe school's Sacred Heart chapel, built in 1961, was replaced after 50 years by a new Spanish-colonial University Church of the Sacred Heart in time for the university's centennial in 2012.\n\nWhen in 2013 Fr. Moreno became Provincial Superior of the Philippine Province of the Society of Jesus, the University Board of Trustees elected Fr. Karel S. San Juan, S.J., as its third president, on February 23, 2013. As Fr. San Juan was in his final year of Jesuit spiritual formation, he did not assume the presidency until October 8, 2013.\n\nGroundbreaking for a new grade school building at the Tumaga campus was held on July 30, 2013; the new building was opened on June 13, 2015. Plans for this campus include construction of an auditorium, an amphitheater, sports facilities, and a chapel which will replace the chapel in the high school building.\n\nOn June 13, 2016, the Senior High School unit was officially inaugurated at the Fr Salvador Eusebio Campus, La Purisima St, Zamboanga City. The unit originally occupied the Kostka and Xavier Halls.\n\nOn April 3, 2017, the Ateneo de Zamboanga University held the groundbreaking and contract-signing ceremonials for the construction of the new Senior High School (SHS) building. This five-story building, later named the Francisco Wee Saavedra (FWS) building, houses classrooms, offices, laboratories, a chapel, prayer room, cafeteria and commercial spaces.\n\nThe FWS building was inaugurated on December 8, 2018, coinciding with the last day of the Ateneo Fiesta that year.\n\nOn July 7, 2017, the historic 67-year-old Brebeuf Gymnasium was razed to the ground; the Sauras, Kostka, and Gonzaga Halls were also affected. The Zamboanga City government estimated the damages to amount to 5 million.\n\nIn response, the University, led by the University Office for Advancement, initiated the RISE Capital Campaign and adjusted its campus expansion plans. The campaign aims to rase PHP 1 billion, allocating PHP 700 million to infrastructure, PHP 200 million to scholarships, and PHP 100 million to research. The Gonzaga Hall was rebuilt, while the Sauras Hall was retrofitted with carbon fiber materials. In the former site of the Brebeuf Gymnasium, a second Multi-Purpose Covered Court was built.\n\nThe former Lantaka Hotel was donated by the Walstrom family to AdZU. The inauguration of the campus was held on March 19, 2019.\n\nAdZU offers academic programs at the kindergarten, elementary, junior high, senior high, undergraduate, and graduate levels. As is the norm in the Philippine education system, instruction is primarily delivered in the English language with the exception of Philippine and foreign language subjects.\n\nConsistent with the liberal arts tradition upon which all Ateneo schools draw from, AdZU's academic programs always have core subjects that educate students from all levels and specializations not only on the nationally mandated areas of history, social studies, and literature, but also on matters that are of importance to Atenean education such as Ignatian spirituality, Catholic theology, and Jesuit philosophy. In spite of this, AdZU welcomes students from differing faiths and traditions.\n\nThe AdZU Graduate School offers Masters-level and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) programs across the disciplines covered by the five undergraduate schools. In addition, AdZU has career-specific professional schools, including the School of Medicine and the College of Law.\n\nThe AdZU undergraduate schools comprise the following:\n\n\nAdZU offers education in the Grade School (GS), Junior High School (JHS), and Senior High School (SHS) units. The Grade School unit offers primary education in the 1st to 6th grade as well as two years of kindergarten (preparatory) education. The Junior High School unit covers the 7th to 10th grade of secondary education, and offers accelerated mathematics curricula to qualified students. Both units achieved the top level of PAASCU accreditation for their education levels.\n\nThe Senior High School offers 11th and 12th grade education. The unit was launched following the K-12 curriculum overhaul project of the Department of Education. It offers the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM); Accountancy and Business Management (ABM); Humanities and Social Sciences (HUMSS); and Information and Communications Technology - 2D Animation (ICT-2DA) strands.\n\nAdZU operates with a selective admissions policy. All of the units of the University require, among other things, passing an entrance examination (which in the case of the Grade School is instead termed an 'assessment test'); past education records are also required for examination. The School of Medicine requires results in the National Medical Admission Test while the College of Law requires results in the PhilSAT; all other units administer their own entrance examinations.\n\nAfter receiving a five-year Level III Accreditation for the Arts and Sciences, Education, Business and Accountancy, and Nursing programs in May 2014, AdZU requested Institutional Accreditation, an evaluation process that looks at the overall quality of the school. In September 2014, the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities (PAASCU) granted Institutional Accreditation to Ateneo de Zamboanga.\n\nThe University has also been declared by the Commission on Higher Education as a Center of Excellence (CoE) in Teacher Education and a Center of Development (CoD) in Information Technology.\n\nIn May 2017, the Junior High School was conferred a Level III accreditation status from PAASCU accreditors.\n\nAdZU operates three campuses. As part of the RISE ADZU capital campaign, the University is currently undergoing a campus revitalization and expansion program.\n\nThe main campus (4.3 hectares) on La Purisima Street, named for Fr. Eusebio Salvador, S.J., houses the undergraduate and graduate schools and the Senior High School unit.\n\nBuildings used as learning spaces include the Bellarmine-Campion building (home to the Bellarmine and Campion halls), the Canisius and Gonzaga halls (collectively colloquially referred to as the C building), the Xavier Hall, the Kostka Hall, and the Francisco Wee Saavedra (FWS) Building. The FWS Building permanently hosts the Senior High School unit, while other buildings are shared by the undergraduate, graduate, and senior high schools.\n\nThe Learning Resource Center on-campus houses the Fr. Jose Bacatan, S.J. library, the University's main library, as well as several important offices and the administration of the Graduate School. The campus also contains two Multi-Purpose Covered Courts, the Backfield, the Bellarmine-Campion Quadrangle, the Jesuit Residences, the Rosauro (JMR) Hall, and the Sauras Hall.\n\nThe second campus (8.3 hectares) in Barangay Tumaga, which is outside Zamboanga City proper, named for Fr. William Kreutz, S.J., is home to the Junior High School and Grade School units.\n\nThe campus initially opened as the home of the Ateneo de Zamboanga University High School, which needed more space to expand than the constraints of the Main Campus could allow. Eventually, the Grade School was moved to this campus too in 2015, and the campus was given purpose as the basic education center of the University.\n\nAside from the junior high school and grade school buildings, the campus also includes a soccer field, a multi-purpose covered court, and a playground.\n\nThe Ateneo de Zamboanga University Lantaka Campus is situated along the historic developed coastline of Zamboanga City. The campus was previously a resort hotel. The University will repurpose the site for educational, spiritual, religious, and social development purposes.\n\nThe University Research Office (URO), formerly known as the Ateneo Research Center (ARC), is the office of AdZU concerned with supervising the research activities of the University. The URO is supervised by the University Research and Publication Council (URPC), a policy-making body that is concerned with setting research agenda and providing mentoring to AdZU academics.\n\nThe Ateneo de Zamboanga University Press is the publisher of the \"Asia Mindanaw: Dialogue on Peace and Development\" journal, which covers research papers and projects that examine Western Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago, as well as the dynamics between MIndanao itself and Asia as a whole.\n\nThe AdZU Social Development Council includes an institute and three centers that provide social and religious outreach to the peoples served by Ateneo de Zamboanga University in Western Mindanao, Philippines.\nThe Council's programs include the following:\n\n\nA center of the University, the Ateneo Center for Culture and the Arts (ACCA), is also home to the SUGPAT Adolescent Development and Participation Program, a youth development and alternative education advocacy supported by UNICEF Philippines and the ING Group.\n\nThe Ateneo de Zamboanga University seal reflects the institution's mission.\nSurrounding the upper half of the seal is the school motto, \"\"Pro Deo et Patria\".\" This Latin phrase literally translates to \"For God and Country,\" but is officially rephrased by the University to mean \"In the Service of God and Country\" to reflect the university's self-defined mission to produce men and women who are both nationalistic and grounded in faith. The name of the school is written on the bottom half.\n\nIn the circular field is the shield. The red and yellow stripes are derived from the coat of arms of the family of Oñaz, the maternal line of St. Ignatius. In the center are two wolves and a food pot. These are of the medallion of the family of Loyola, the paternal line of St. Ignatius of Loyola. This medallion stands for the generosity for which the house of Loyola was well known. The cross on the upper right portion of the shield symbolizes the Christian character of the Ateneo, while the vinta is meant to be representative of the various cultural communities of the South Western Philippines where the school is located. On the bottom left are the book and torch, traditional symbols of education.\n\nAbove the shield is the sunburst, in which the monogram of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) — JHS is positioned with the cross above and three nails below. The \"JHS\" wordmark is derived from the Greek ΙἨΣ, the first letters of Jesus' name. Emanating from the name of Jesus are blue and white rays signifying grace for all.\n\nThe name Ateneo is the Spanish form of \"Athenæum\", which the Dictionary of Classical Antiquities defines as the name of \"the first educational institution in Rome\" where \"rhetoricians and poets held their recitations.\" Hadrian's school drew its name from a Greek temple dedicated to Athena, the goddess of wisdom. The said temple, according to the Encyclopædia Britannica, was where \"poets and men of learning were accustomed to meet and read their productions.\" Athenæum is also used in reference to schools and literary clubs. The closest English translation is academy, referring to institutions of secondary learning.\n\nThe Society of Jesus has established 16 schools in the Philippines since 1590 and named nine of them Ateneo. Ateneo de Zamboanga was the second school named Ateneo in 1916. Over the years, the name \"Ateneo\" has been recognized as the official title of Jesuit institutions of higher learning in the Philippines.\n\nThe units of AdZU together have dozens of student organizations that cater to a wide variety of preferences, ranging from advocacy and humanitarian groups such as institutional chapters of Rotary International's Interact to niche interests such as debate and worship music.\n\nIn addition, the different Schools (including undergraduate, professional, and basic education schools) have \"Academic Organizations\" (AOs) that manage the specific needs of students in a given School. These AOs are instrumental in rallying students from these schools together for matters of interest and importance, as well as organizing teams for sports festivals and other intra-University activities.\n\nThe college varsity teams compete in the Private Schools Athletic Association (PRISAA), and the grade school and high school varsity teams participate in the Private Schools of Zamboanga City Athletic Association (PSZCAA).\n\nAdZU holds a school-wide annual sportsfest called \"Ateneo Fiesta,\" a week-long event beginning in the last week of November. Most of the high school and college competitors in the Fiesta are varsity athletes preparing for competition in sports events on the PRISAA agenda. The Fiesta itself is now considered the most important event of the academic year for student life.\n\nThe Sanggunian ng mga Mag-aaral ng Ateneo de Zamboanga University (SMADZU) was the College unit's student government before 2009. Currently in its place is El Consejo Atenista, which was created with the objective of being a more representative student government. The basic education units also have their own student councils; the junior high school student government is called the \"Council of Leaders\", while the senior high school government is called the \"Ateneo Student Executive Council\" (ASEC). The grade school's council is simply named \"Student Government\".\n\nOfficial student publications are \"The Beacon Magazine\" for the College unit, \"The Oculus Publications\" and \"Vista de Aguila\" for the Senior High School, \"Blue Eagle Publications\" and \"La Liga Atenista\" for the Junior High School, and \"The Quill\" for the Grade School.\n\nThe student publications of the University regularly compete in local, regional, and national journalism competitions.\n\n"}

They specialize in aggregating content from a large range of private and government funded organisations (e.g. Bureau of Meteorology, Environmental Protection Authority, World Meteorological Organisation, Australian Broadcasting Corporation etc.). Weatherzone is the major commercial weather company that provides meteorological services in Australia.\n\nWeatherzone was founded in 1998 by former Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) meteorologist, Mark Hardy, providing graphics, scripts and weather briefings for television weather presentations. In 2008 in response to an increasing demand from industry for more accurate and more frequently updating weather forecasts, Weatherzone developed the Opticast forecast system. This system takes information from over a dozen computer models including variants of the in-house operated Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The Opticast algorithms are run every hour ensuring the forecasts are continually staying abreast of rapid and previously unforeseen meteorological changes. The accuracy of Opticast allowed weatherzone to make a successful foray into the lucrative energy and mining weather forecasting markets. Over subsequent years, many of Australia's major electricity companies commenced using weatherzone's Opticast forecasting products including AGL, Snowy Hydro, Delta Energy, Energex and Tru Energy.\n\nOn 25 June 2008 Fairfax Media acquired a 75% share in Weatherzone (then known as The Weather Company) with 25% still owned by the founder, Mark Hardy who retained the Managing Director role.

{"id": "2155544", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2155544", "title": "Al MacNeil", "text": "Al MacNeil\n\nAllister Wences \"Al\" MacNeil (born September 27, 1935) is a former National Hockey League player and coach. He was the first man from the Maritime region of Canada to be a head coach in the NHL.\n\nHe played parts of eleven seasons in the National Hockey League as a rugged defenceman with the Toronto Maple Leafs, Montreal Canadiens, Chicago Black Hawks, New York Rangers and Pittsburgh Penguins.\n\nUpon retiring as a player, MacNeil turned to coaching with the Montreal Voyageurs of the American Hockey League, top farm club of the Canadiens, for the 1969–70 season. After a successful debut, MacNeil became an assistant coach to Claude Ruel of the NHL Canadiens for the 1970–71 season.\n\nDuring that season, the Habs struggled for a good portion of the season, at one point in danger of missing the playoffs for a second straight year—something that hadn't happened since they missed the playoffs three years in a row from 1919 to 1922. Ruel resigned 23 games into the season and MacNeil took the helm; meanwhile, the club swung a major trade to net top scoring left wing Frank Mahovlich from the Detroit Red Wings. The Canadiens rallied to qualify for the playoffs as third seed in their division, then MacNeil led the team to an unexpected Stanley Cup championship. The Habs stunned the heavily favoured Boston Bruins in the opening round of the playoffs, and then defeated the Minnesota North Stars and Chicago Black Hawks, winning the latter series after having been behind 3–2.\n\nCrucial to the Stanley Cup victory was MacNeil's decision to use rookie goaltender Ken Dryden in the playoffs despite Dryden having played only six regular-season games in 1970–71. MacNeil was presumably impressed that Dryden won all these games, allowing only nine goals (1.65 GAA). Another crucial choice was having rookie Rejean Houle mark the Black Hawks' goalscorer Bobby Hull. Houle was nicknamed the \"shadow of Bobby Hull\" as Hull managed to score only one even-strength goal in the series.\n\nUnfortunately, MacNeil had a frosty relationship with most of the team's francophone players, most notably Henri Richard. He was the first Canadiens coach in recent memory who couldn't speak French at all. When MacNeil benched Richard during the final series against the Black Hawks, Richard publicly criticised the coach, calling him incompetent. In game seven held at Chicago, being tied at 2–2 after the first two periods, the Canadiens scored the winning goal early in the third to take the series and the championship, with Richard scoring both the equalizer and game winner. MacNeil and Richard hugged at the end of the game, but that did little to patch up their differences. Winning the Cup, however, was not enough to save MacNeil's job; he was demoted to head coach of the Canadiens' American Hockey League affiliate, the Nova Scotia Voyageurs, while the fluently bilingual Scotty Bowman succeeded him as head coach of the Habs. MacNeil won three Calder Cup Championships (1972, 1976, 1977) in six years with the Voyageurs.\n\nOn October 10, 2013, it was announced MacNeil had been named to the AHL's 2014 Hall of Fame class, alongside Bob Perreault, John Slaney and Bill Dineen.\n\nHe later returned to the Canadiens winning two more Stanley Cups as Director of Player Personnel in 1978 and 1979.\n\nOn June 7, 1979, MacNeil resigned from his position with the Canadiens to succeed Fred Creighton as the third-ever head coach of the Atlanta Flames. He remained in that capacity through the franchise's move to Calgary and up until his promotion to director of player development and professional scouting on May 31, 1982. MacNeil won his fourth Stanley Cup in 1989 as Calgary's assistant general manager.\n\nOn December 10, 2001, MacNeil returned to head coaching duties after almost two decades when the Flames head coach at the time, Greg Gilbert, was suspended for a period of two games for his role in a brawl in a game with the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. When Gilbert was fired in the next season due to the Flames' poor performance, MacNeil once again assumed interim head coaching duties before Darryl Sutter was hired.\n\nMacNeil has been involved in professional hockey for more than 50 years as a player, coach, assistant manager and director of hockey operations.\n\nAl MacNeil is married, he has two children, daughter Allison and son Allister, and two grandsons from his daughter.\n"}

It is privately owned, and open to the public only upon special request.\n\nThe Arboretum was established in 1910 by Dr. Walter Bartlett, a general practitioner from Belle Plaine, who purchased pastureland to create his own arboretum. In the 1930s the arboretum became an approved test site for the United States Department of Agriculture which provided plants and trees from around the world for hardiness tests.\n\nThe Arboretum now contains massive cypress, oaks and champion Japanese maples. Its steward is Robin Lynn Macy, otherwise known as a founding member of the Dixie Chicks bluegrass and country music group.\n\nIt was developed over many years, from relatively barren land with water only in a slough. Early in the process, Bartlett formed a dam and also built 4 islands in the slough.\n\nAccording to the National Park Service:\n\nThe Bartlett Arboretum is a private fifteen acre park in rural Belle Plaine, Kansas, that evolved in early 20th century from a recreational park and conservation area to an arboretum with formal gardens and experimental plots and nurseries. The arboretum largely reflects the influences of professional landscape architect and horticulturist Glenn Bartlett, his wife and floral expert Margaret Bartlett, and Glenn’s father who first purchased the property in 1910 to be used as a public athletic field for the small community and as a natural reserve complete with water fowl and non-indigenous trees. After years of being under maintained, the Bartlett Arboretum is currently being restored with the goal for it to serve as an educational and events space.\nThe property was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on April 19, 2010. The listing was announced as the featured listing in the National Park Service's weekly list of May 7, 2010.\n\n\n"}

He has also served as a head coach in the NHL for the Los Angeles Kings, Montreal Canadiens, Pittsburgh Penguins and St. Louis Blues.\n\nBorn in Montreal, Quebec, Berry began his junior hockey career with the Peterborough Petes of the OHA before deciding to attend Sir George Williams University (now Concordia University) in Montreal where he would play three years of collegiate hockey in the OQAA (now CIS). In 1966 Berry joined Canada's National Hockey Team and was later signed by the Montreal Canadiens to his first professional contract in 1968 at age 25. With the Canadiens having a deep roster at left wing, Berry would only manage to suit up for two games with the Canadiens in 1968-69. He spent the following year playing in the AHL for the Montreal Voyageurs and the Canadiens eventually sold his rights to the Los Angeles Kings in 1970 giving him a better opportunity to earn a spot on an NHL roster. Berry joined the Los Angeles Kings the following year in 1970-71 and registered 63 points in 73 games in his rookie season, placing him only 9 points back of eventual Calder Trophy winner Gil Perreault of the Buffalo Sabres. In 1972-73 Berry scored a career high 36 goals with the Kings and was selected to play in his first NHL All-Star game on January 30, 1973 at Madison Square Garden in New York. Berry was selected to play in the All-Star game again the following year at the Chicago Stadium. He finished his NHL career with 350 points in 541 regular season games.\n\nAfter retiring as a player in 1978 with the AHL's Springfield Indians, he returned to Los Angeles to become the eighth head coach in Kings history in 1978-79. He led the Kings to the Stanley Cup playoffs in each of his three seasons behind the bench. However, in each of those years from 1978–79 to 1980–81 they were defeated in the opening round of the playoffs. Berry eventually resigned as head coach at the end of the 1980–81 campaign after the Kings posted a 43W–24L–13T record and lost to the New York Rangers in the preliminary round. Despite his lack of success in the playoffs, Berry is credited with giving rise to the famed \"Triple Crown Line\" during his tenure as head coach, putting Marcel Dionne, Charlie Simmer and Dave Taylor on the same line for the very first time in a game at Joe Louis Arena in 1979 vs. the Detroit Red Wings.\n\nHe moved on to take the head coaching assignment in his hometown of Montreal replacing Claude Ruel behind the Canadiens bench to start the 1981–82 NHL season. Despite winning 46 and 42 games respectively in his first two years at the helm, His Canadiens were eliminated in the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs in 1981–82 (by the Quebec Nordiques) and in 1982–83 (by the Buffalo Sabres). This would mark the fifth straight season he would lose in the first round of the playoffs as a head coach. With the team playing below .500 in his third year behind the bench in 1983–84, he was eventually fired by the Canadiens and was replaced by Jacques Lemaire 63 games into the season. To date, he is the last non-interim Canadiens coach who was not fully bilingual in English and French, though he spoke French well enough to have a simple conversation.\n\nHe was named the 9th head coach in Pittsburgh Penguins history on June 4, 1984 a mere 5 days prior to the 1984 NHL Entry Draft that was held at the Montreal Forum in which Pittsburgh Penguins general manager Eddie Johnston selected Mario Lemieux 1st overall from the Laval Voisins of the QMJHL. Even though\nBerry's new team drafted their future franchise player, he inherited a Penguins team that had failed to reach the playoffs the previous two seasons. That streak continued under his guidance for the next three seasons as the Penguins missed reaching the playoffs for the fifth straight year in 1986-87. He was eventually relieved of his head coaching position at the end of the 1986–87 NHL season on April 13, 1987.\n\nHe returned to coaching for the 1988-89 NHL season after a two-year hiatus, this time joining the St. Louis Blues coaching staff as an assistant with Joe Micheletti under head coach Brian Sutter. He finally got a taste of playoff success behind the bench as the St. Louis Blues defeated the Minnesota North Stars in the opening round of the playoffs 4–1. The Blues then faced the Chicago Blackhawks in round 2 but lost that series in five games.\n\nThe Blues qualified for the playoffs in the following 3 seasons. However, they were unable to advance past the second round in either of those years. Berry was appointed assistant GM of the Blues under GM Ron Caron in the summer before the start of the 1992–93 season. The Blues then hired former St. Louis defenceman Bob Plager to take over the head coaching duties. After the Blues got off to a slow start Plager stepped down after a 6–4 victory over Berry's former team the Pittsburgh Penguins on October 30, 1992. He took over the head coaching duties after Plager's departure and from there he helped the Blues reach the playoffs once again in the spring of 1993. The Blues swept the Chicago Blackhawks in the first round, and he finally made it to the second round of the post-season as a head coach in the NHL. However, his post-season success, as well as the Blues,' was short lived as Berry's team was knocked out in the second round by the Toronto Maple Leafs in a hard fought 7 games series that went the distance. He remained on as head coach of the Blues the next season with Ted Sator joining the fold as an assistant. The Blues made the playoffs once again but were swept in the first round by the Dallas Stars. The St. Louis Blues then named Mike Keenan head coach to start the 1994-95 NHL season with Berry and Sator staying on staff as associate coaches. It remained status quo for the Blues with Keenan and Berry behind the bench as they failed to advance past the second round the following two seasons. 1995–96 would be his final season behind the Blues bench.\n\nIn San Jose, his was hired on as an assistant under head coach Darryl Sutter to replace the departed Roy Sommer, teaming up with former Calgary Flame tough guy Paul Baxter who was already in place as Sutter's other assistant. He spent two seasons in San Jose as an assistant under Sutter before retiring as a coach in 1999-2000.\n\nHe currently serves as a pro scout for the Chicago Blackhawks. He has also served as a pro scout in the NHL for the Los Angeles Kings, St. Louis Blues and Ottawa Senators.\n\n\n"}

Later, Perron joined the International Hockey League's San Francisco Spiders as their head coach and general manager for one season, followed by a short stint with the Manitoba Moose.\n\nPerron's tough and often authoritarian coaching style resulted in tumultuous relationships with several of his players and staff, including a long-standing public feud with former Canadiens player Chris Nilan.\n\nAfter his professional coaching career, Perron became a hockey analyst for different media outlets in Quebec and has appeared regularly on TQS's sports talk show \"110%\".

He led both teams to new heights with Israel being promoted to Division I for one year. He left after two seasons but returned in 2011 and led the Under-18 team to a IIHF World U-18 Division II Group B championship in 2013.\n\n"}
{"id": "2155575", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2155575", "title": "Erich Goode", "text": "Erich Goode\n\nErich Goode is an American sociologist specializing in the sociology of deviance. He has written a number of books on the field in general, as well as on specific deviant topics.\nHe is a professor at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.\n\nGoode received a B.A. from Oberlin College (1960) and a Ph.D. in sociology from Columbia University (1966). He has taught at Columbia University, New York University, Florida Atlantic University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Hebrew University in Jerusalem, Israel. He is currently employed as a professor at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. He also teaches at the University of Maryland.\n\nGoode takes a constructionist approach to deviance. In his view, a behavior is deviant if and only if society at large considers it so. The broader social factors that go into the classification of a behavior as deviant are thus considered a valid subject of study. His research focuses on the deviant individuals (and behaviors) themselves, as well as the particular individuals and groups that play a part in classifying the behavior as deviant. \n\nAs a sociologist, Goode makes no judgment about whether a particular is \"bad\" or \"evil\", and considers deviance as a topic to be entirely dependent on whether the society at large considers the behavior deviant. In this view, a particular behavior can be deviant in one society, but normal in another. This is in contrast to the perspective of essentialism, which would say that a behavior either \"really is\" deviant or \"really isn't\", and that it is the task of the sociologist to discover and report on the truth of the matter, and what society at large believes is mostly irrelevant.\n\nAccording to the constructionist framework as espoused by Goode, an instance of \"deviance\" can exist as a social construct exclusively, completely separate from any actual behavior. In other words, \"imaginary deviance\" can exist that causes a frenzy of interesting sociological behavior in response to a non-existence phenomenon. Satanic ritual abuse is an example of this in modern times, and the case of witch hunts is an example from antiquity. These are often called moral panics, and Goode considers them a valid subject (perhaps the ideal subject) for deviance studies.\n\nErich Goode is known for his exploration and exposure of the \"moral panic\" concept. He takes a \"harm reductionist\" approach to studying social deviance. This commitment aims to reduce social harm without engaging in value judgments or essentialist claims about those being studied.\n\n1. Legal instrumental use - Taking prescribed drugs and over the counter drugs to relieve or treat symptoms. \n\n2. Legal recreational use - Using legal (tobacco, alcohol, caffeine) drugs to achieve a certain mental state. \n\n3. Illegal instrumental use - Taking non prescription drugs to accomplish a task or goal. \n\n4.Illegal recreational use - Taking illegal drugs for fun or pleasure to experience euphoria.\n\n\"Marijuana\" (1969) seeks to bring to the reader the whole configuration of this mushrooming problem, which, like the Sexual Revolution and the New Politics, lies at the heart of the alienation felt by many young people and the fears of social breakdown voiced by many of their elders. Atherton Press, Library of Congress Catalog Card Number 68-56981\n\nIn \"The Marijuana Smokers\" (1971), Goode looked at marijuana through a sociological lens.\n\nIn \"Drugs in American Society\", Goode argued that the effect of a drug is dependent on the societal context in which it is taken. Thus, in one society (or social context) a particular drug may be a depressant, and in another it may be a stimulant.\n\n\"Deviant Behavior\" is a textbook intended for undergrad students. In it, Goode takes the position of a weak constructionist.\n\n\"Moral Panics: The Social Construction of Deviance\", written with Nachman Ben-Yehuda, is a book about moral panics, from a sociological perspective. \n\nIn \"Paranormal Beliefs: A Sociological Introduction\" (1999), Goode studies paranormal beliefs such as UFOs, ESP, and creationism using the methods of the sociology of deviance. Consistent in tone with the rest of his works, he takes the position that whether the phenomenon in question is real is not important to a sociologist. Rather, sociologists should be concerned with how the paranormalist is labeled as deviant, and what effect the label has on them and society.\n\nAs a sociologist, Goode relies heavily on informants for his research. For example, Goode consulted with and interviewed actual drug users for his books on drugs. In 1999, Goode admitted through the sociology journal circuit that he had engaged in sexual intercourse with a few of his informants and discussed how this influenced his perspective on the subject he was studying. This caused a firestorm of articles defending or denouncing his work. \n\nAdditionally, in an article in Qualitative Sociology Goode notes that the parents of an informant who became pregnant urged him to move to California and he explained that it was impossible for both personal and professional reasons to do so.\n"}

{"id": "2155579", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2155579", "title": "El-Ouali Mustapha Sayed", "text": "El-Ouali Mustapha Sayed\n\nEl-Ouali Mustapha Sayed (also known as \"El Uali\", \"El-Wali\", \"Luali\" or \"Lulei\"; ; b. 1948 – 9 June 1976) was a Sahrawi nationalist leader, co-founder and second Secretary-General of the Polisario Front.\n\nEl-Ouali was born in 1948 in a Sahrawi nomad encampment somewhere on the \"hammada\" desert plains in eastern Spanish Sahara or northern Mauritania; some sources give his place of birth as Bir Lehlou, a location that is symbolic for the Polisario Front, for being the place of the proclamation of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR). His parents were poor and his father disabled, and with the sum of the severe drought on the Sahara that year, and the consequences of the Ifni War, the family had to abandon the traditional bedouin lifestyle of the Sahrawis, settling near Tan-Tan (nowadays southern Morocco) at the late 1950s. Some sources stated that Ouali's family was deported among others to Morocco by Spanish authorities in 1960.\n\nHe went to Primary School in Tan-Tan in 1962, and then to the Islamic Institute in Taroudannt in 1966 with impressive results, being awarded scholarships to attend university in Rabat in 1970. There he studied Laws & Political sciences, and met other young members of the Sahrawi diaspora, who like him were affected by the radicalism sweeping Moroccan universities in the early 1970s (heavily influenced by May 1968 in France). He was the first alumnus in the history of Moroccan universities on achieving a punctuation of 19 out of 20 in Constitutional law. He travelled to Europe for the only time in his life about this time, visiting Amsterdam in the Netherlands & Paris in France.\n\nEl-Ouali grew increasingly disturbed by the oppressive Spanish colonial rule over what was then known as Spanish Sahara, and although never involved with the Harakat Tahrir, news of the Zemla Intifada made a deep impression on him. In 1972, he returned to Tan-Tan (former Spanish Sahara), where he began organizing a group called the \"Embryonic Movement for the Liberation of Saguia el-Hamra and Río de Oro\". After a Sahrawi demonstration in Tan-Tan in June 1972, a group of 20 participants including Ouali were detained and tortured by the Moroccan police; then he met with other groups of Sahrawis from inside Western Sahara, Algeria & Mauritania, and in 1973 founded with them the Polisario Front. Days after the POLISARIO's foundation, El-Ouali and Brahim Gali led a group of six poorly armed guerrillas in the 20 May 1973 El-Khanga raid, the first armed action of the Polisario Front (El-Khanga was a Spanish military post in the desert). El-Ouali and another fighter were briefly captured, but they managed to escape when the remaining patrol headed by Gali overran the ill-prepared Spanish troops. The Khanga strike was to be followed by similar attacks on isolated targets, in which the POLISARIO gathered weapons and equipment, until they were finally able to enter into full-scale guerrilla warfare.\n\nIn April 1974, El-Uali headed the POLISARIO delegation that took part in the Pan African Youth Movement meeting in Benghazi, Libya.\n\nIn August 1974, El-Uali was elected secretary-general of the Polisario, replacing Brahim Gali on the post.\n\nIn 1974–75 the Polisario Front slowly seized control over the desert countryside, and quickly became the most important nationalist organization in the country. By 1975 Spain had been forced to retreat into the major coastal cities, and reluctantly accepted negotiations on the surrender of power. At this point, the Polisario remained a relatively small organization of perhaps 800 fighters and activists, although supported by a vastly larger network of sympathizers.\n\nAccording to claims by Mehdi Bennouna in his book \"Heroes Sans Gloire\", El-Ouali was the son of a member of the Moroccan Army of Liberation. Allegedly, he was a member of Union National des Étudiants Marocains (UNEM), the students union in Morocco and was recruited by Mohamed Bennouna to join the \"Tanzim\" (The Organisation or the Structure), an Arabic nationalist and socialist organization which was created to overthrow the monarchy under Hassan II and obtained support from Syria, Libya, and Algeria. El-Ouali was supposedly trained in Libya and his mentor was a man named \"Nemri\". Bennouna claims the death of Mahmoud and Nemri, as well as the fluctuating relationship between Tanzim and Algeria led to the creation of the Polisario Front. Bennouna personally views this as part of the armed revolution in Morocco and of the political dissidence against the Moroccan regime.\n\nAfter the joint Moroccan–Mauritanian invasion of Western Sahara in late 1975, and the Moroccan air raids on Sahrawi refugees columns in the desert, El-Ouali escorted them into exile in the refugee camps of Tindouf, Algeria. From there, as the secretary-general of Polisario he presided over the establishing of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. The Sahrawi republic effectively became the government of some 50,000–60,000 people in 1976, housed in the Tindouf refugee camps. At that point, the Polisario Front, backed by Algeria and Libya, reinforced a guerrilla war against Morocco and Mauritania, who had substantially larger forces and armament, mostly from French and Spanish origin. The usual tactic of the Polisario guerrillas consisted in raids (sometimes of hundreds of km) on military objectives like Moroccan military posts on Tarfaya, Amgala or Guelta Zemmur, or economic objectives, as the Bou Craa phosphate conveyor belt, the Zouerat iron mines and the Mauritania Railway.\n\nBy all accounts, El-Ouali was intensely charismatic, and often made public speeches in the refugee camps. He frequently met with foreign journalists visiting the camps, acknowledging the importance of publicizing the Sahrawi struggle. He was widely respected by his compatriots for his habit of fighting at the front line with his troops, although this would ultimately prove a fatal choice.\n\nOn 9 June 1976 El-Ouali was killed by a shrapnel piece through the head returning from a major Polisario raid on the Mauritanian capital, Nouakchott, in which they bombarded the Presidential palace. In the retreat, pursued by Mauritanian troops, armored vehicles and aviation, a group with Ouali separated from the principal column, going to Benichab (about 100 km. north of Nouakchott) with the intention of destroying the water pipeline that supplied the capital. Other sources claim that the subsequent combat took place north of Akjoujt. They were surrounded and cornered by Mauritanian troops with Panhard AMLs and then annihilated. Ouali's body was sent to Nouackchott and buried secretly in a military terrain (in 1996, 20 years after his death, the exact place of his rests was revealed), where it still lies. His position as Secretary-General was briefly assumed in an interim capacity by Mahfoud Ali Beiba, who was then replaced by Mohammed Abdelaziz at the Polisario's III General Popular Congress in August 1976.\n\nA book containing two letters and a speech of El Uali was published in 1978 entitled \"\"Three texts: Two letters and a speech\"\", being reedited in 2010. In 1997, the University of Alicante published the book \"\"Luali: Now or never, the liberty\"\", a joint effort by Spanish writer and prosecutor Felipe Briones and Sahrawi writers Mohamed Limam Mohamed Ali and Mahayub Salek, being the first published biography about El Ouali's life and legacy.\n\n\nSome selected quotes:\n\nEl-Ouali image appears on 2 Gold coins of 40000 Sahrawi Pesetas of Western Sahara minted in 1997. One coin weights 15.5 Grams, purity 900 out of 1000, Mintage: 90 Pieces, the other coin weights 15.52 Grams, purity 999 out of 1000, Mintage: 10 Pieces has a Proof quality. Both coins depict El-Ouali alongside of Simon Bolivar and were minted to commemorate 15 years of friendship between Western Sahara and Venezuela.\n\nThe Sahrawi traditional music group \"\"Shahid El Hafed Buyema\"\" changed their name to \"\"Shahid El Uali\"\" shortly afterwards his death in combat.\n\nEl-Ouali is revered as a Father of the Nation by the Sahrawi refugee population, and there is a simple stone memorial built to his honour in the desert. The day of his death, 9 June, has been declared \"The Day of the Martyrs\", a holiday of the republic that honors all Sahrawi victims in the war for independence.\n\nIn Mauritania, the 9 June was declared by Mokhtar Ould Daddah the day of the Mauritanian armed forces.\n\n"}

Christian metal is regarded more of a concept rather than a genre since it has no specific musical characteristics. It emerged in the late 1970s as a means of evangelization to the wider heavy metal music scene and was pioneered by American bands Resurrection Band and Barnabas, Swedish band Jerusalem and Canadian band Daniel Band. Los Angeles' Stryper achieved wide success in the 1980s. In the mid to late 1980s, extreme metal genres were popularized by bands such as Vengeance Rising, Deliverance, Believer and Tourniquet. In the early 1990, the Australian death metal band Mortification rose to prominence within its country's underground metal scene. At the turn of the 21st century, P.O.D., with two platinum-selling albums, achieved a mainstream commercial success rivaling that of Stryper. The metalcore groups Underoath, Demon Hunter, As I Lay Dying and Norma Jean (dubbed by the magazine \"Revolver\" as \"The Holy Alliance\") also brought some mainstream attention to the movement in the first decade of the 2000s, achieving ranks in the \"Billboard\" 200.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2155588", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2155588", "title": "Alain Vigneault", "text": "Alain Vigneault\n\nAlain Vigneault (born May 14, 1961) is a Canadian professional ice hockey head coach for the Philadelphia Flyers of the National Hockey League (NHL). Vigneault has previously coached the Montreal Canadiens, Vancouver Canucks, and the New York Rangers in the NHL, as well as in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL). During his career with the Canucks, he won the Jack Adams Award as the NHL's top coach of the year in 2006–07 and has become the team's record holder for wins as a coach. Under Vigneault, Vancouver won back-to-back Presidents' Trophies (2010–11 and 2011–12) and made one Stanley Cup Finals appearance (2011). In his first season with New York, he led the Rangers to their first Stanley Cup Finals appearance (2014) in 20 years.\n\nPrior to his coaching career, Vigneault played professionally as a defenceman for six seasons in the NHL, Central Hockey League and American Hockey League (AHL). In the NHL, he played 42 games over two seasons, 1981–82 and 1982–83, for the St. Louis Blues.\n\nAs a youth, Vigneault played in the 1973 and 1974 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournaments with a minor ice hockey team from Hull, Quebec, and then a team from East Ottawa.\n\nVigneault played as a defenceman in the QMJHL for four seasons, beginning in 1977–78 with the Hull Olympiques. He recorded 11 goals and 46 points over 59 games as a rookie, before improving to 13 goals and 54 points over 72 games to rank fifth in team scoring the following season. In his third QMJHL season, Vigneault was traded from Hull to the Trois Rivieres Draveurs. Between the two teams, he accumulated a junior career-high 64 points (11 goals and 53 assists) over 63 games. The following season, his fourth and final in the QMJHL, he tallied seven goals and 62 points over 67 games, before adding four goals and ten points in 19 playoff games. His efforts helped the Draveurs to the QMJHL Finals, where they were defeated four-games-to-one by the Cornwall Royals.\n\nFollowing his QMJHL career, Vigneault was selected in the eighth round, 167th overall, by the St. Louis Blues in the 1981 NHL Entry Draft. He joined the Blues organization during the 1981-82 season where he appeared in 14 games for the club; tallying 1 goal and 2 assists. The remainder of his rookie season was spent in the minor league with the Blues' Central Hockey League (CHL) affiliate, the Salt Lake Golden Eagles. Vigneault was called up to the Blues again the following season where he recorded a goal and three assists in 28 regular season appearances, as well as one assist in four in the playoffs games, while splitting time with the Eagles. The 1983 playoffs were Vigneault's final appearances as a player in the NHL, as he finished his career the following season splitting time between the Maine Mariners of the AHL and the Montana Magic in the CHL.\n\nVigneault began his coaching career at the age of 25 in 1986–87, one season after his retirement as a player. He began in the QMJHL, coaching one season for the Trois-Rivières Draveurs and five for the Hull Olympiques, the same two teams he played junior hockey for. He coached the Olympiques to personal QMJHL regular season bests in 1987–88 with a 43–23–4 record and a playoff championship.\n\nIn the 1992–93 season, Vigneault got his first break in the National Hockey League (NHL) as an assistant coach with the expansion Ottawa Senators. After three-and-a-half years in that position, the Senators' assistant coaches were dismissed during the 1995–96 season and Vigneault returned to the QMJHL to coach the Beauport Harfangs. He led the team to his second QMJHL Finals appearance, where they were defeated by the Granby Prédateurs.\n\nAfter a full season with the Harfangs in 1996–97, Vigneault began his second stint in the NHL and his first as a head coach, with the Montreal Canadiens. Becoming the 20th coach in the history of the Original Six team, he replaced Mario Tremblay. After winning the Stanley Cup in 1993, the team had not advanced past the first round of the playoffs in the four years since. In his first season with the Canadiens, he coached the team to a regular season record of 37 wins, 32 losses and 13 ties to rank fourth in the Northeast Division. They then advanced to the second round with a four-games-to-two series victory over the Pittsburgh Penguins, before being swept in four games by the Buffalo Sabres. The following season, however, the Canadiens failed to make the playoffs with a 32–39–11 record.\n\nDuring his third season with the Canadiens in 1999–2000, he returned to above-.500, despite numerous long-term injuries to key players, just narrowly missing a post-season berth. For his efforts, despite his team failing to make the playoffs for a second-straight year, he was nominated for the Jack Adams Award as the League's coach of the year, ultimately losing the award to Joel Quenneville of the St. Louis Blues. After the Canadiens continued to struggle the following season, Vigneault was fired midway through the campaign and replaced by Michel Therrien.\n\nFollowing his tenure with the Canadiens, he spent two-and-a-half years inactive as a coach. In 2003–04, he was hired to coach the Prince Edward Island Rocket. That season, he coached them to a 40–19–5 record and a second-round appearance in the playoff.\n\nAfter another season with the Rocket, in which the team finished out of the playoffs, Vigneault was hired by the Vancouver Canucks organization to coach their minor-league affiliate, the Manitoba Moose, of the American Hockey League (AHL). Following a successful season in Manitoba, in which the Moose earned 100 points and reached the second round of the playoffs, he was chosen to replace Marc Crawford as the Canucks' head coach ahead of the 2006–07 season. The Canucks had failed to qualify for the playoffs in Crawford's last season with the club and were seen to have underperformed after being considered Stanley Cup contenders after the 2004–05 NHL lockout. In replacing Crawford, who was the Canucks' record holder for all-time wins by a coach, Vigneault became the 16th coach in team history. While Crawford was known for coaching the team under an offence-first mentality, Vigneault had a defensive-minded reputation at the time of his hiring. In addition to letting Crawford go, General Manager Dave Nonis retooled the team considerably. Key offensive players Ed Jovanovski and Todd Bertuzzi departed as stay-at-home defenceman Willie Mitchell and star goaltender Roberto Luongo were brought in.\n\nIn his first season as head coach of the Canucks, Vigneault coached them to a franchise record 49 wins, eclipsing the 46-win season recorded under Pat Quinn in 1992–93. The team won the regular season Northwest Division title before being eliminated in the second round of the playoffs by the Anaheim Ducks. As a result, he received his second Jack Adams Award nomination and beat out Lindy Ruff of the Buffalo Sabres and Michel Therrien of the Pittsburgh Penguins in voting to win the coach of the year on June 14, 2007. The following season, however, the Canucks failed to qualify for the playoffs and GM Dave Nonis was fired. After Nonis' successor, Mike Gillis, was brought in, it was speculated whether or not he would retain Vigneault. After several meetings with Gillis, Vigneault was re-signed to a one-year contract extension to keep him in Vancouver to the 2009–10 season. Vigneault's assistant coaches Barry Smith and Mike Kelly, inherited from Crawford's coaching staff, were both fired.\n\nWith the departure of captain Markus Näslund in the 2008 off-season, Vigneault and team management controversially selected Roberto Luongo as the Canucks' new captain, despite NHL rules forbidding goaltenders to be chosen for the position. Luongo became the first goaltender to captain an NHL team in 60 years, though he was not permitted to wear the captain's \"C\" on his jersey, nor was he permitted to perform the traditional on-ice duties of a captain in the NHL (such as speaking to the referees on behalf of the coach). Under new leadership and management, Vigneault and the Canucks returned to the post-season and won their second Northwest Division title in three years. They were once again defeated in the second round, however; this time by the Chicago Blackhawks.\n\nAbout to enter the final year of his contract in 2009–10, Vigneault was signed to a three-year extension in September 2009. The Canucks matched their franchise-best 49 wins from Vigneault's first season and repeated as Northwest Division champions. Though for a second consecutive year, they were eliminated by the Blackhawks in the second round.\n\nAfter finishing near the top of their conference for the majority of Vigneault's tenure with the team up to the 2009–10 season, the Canucks won their first-ever Presidents' Trophy as the league's best regular season team after a franchise year of 54 wins and 117 points. They advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time since 1994, but lost the championship in seven games to the Boston Bruins. Vigneault earned his third nomination for the Jack Adams Award in 2011, but lost to Dan Bylsma of the Pittsburgh Penguins. The following year, the Canucks repeated as Presidents' Trophy champions. During the season, Vigneault became the most winning coach in Canucks' history with his 247th victory with the team, a 3–0 shutout against the Colorado Avalanche on November 23, 2011. At 427 games, it took him 97 fewer contests than his predecessor, Crawford, to set the mark. Though the league's best regular season team once more in 2011–12, the Canucks were eliminated from the 2012 Stanley Cup playoffs in the first round; losing in five games to the eventual champion, the eighth-seeded Los Angeles Kings.\n\nDuring the 2013 playoffs, the Canucks were swept in the first round by the San Jose Sharks. After the loss, many Vancouver fans voiced the need for a major change among the Canucks coaching staff, mainly Vigneault. After many rumors and much speculation, Vigneault was fired by the Canucks on May 22, 2013.\n\nOn June 21, 2013, the New York Rangers hired Vigneault to be their 34th head coach, replacing John Tortorella, who coincidentally was hired as Vigneault's replacement in Vancouver. He signed a five-year, $10 million contract.\n\nVigneault's Rangers initially struggled in the first half of the 2013–14 campaign, but finished very strong. The Rangers finished second in the Metropolitan Division, qualifying for the post-season and making it to the team's first Stanley Cup Final since they defeated the Vancouver Canucks in the 1993–94 season. The team, however, lost to the Los Angeles Kings in five games in the Final.\n\nIn 2014–15, Vigneault's second season with the team, the Rangers set a franchise record with 113 points in the regular season, winning the NHL's President's Trophy for the first time since the 1993-94 season. In the first round, the Rangers knocked out the Pittsburgh Penguins in five games, winning the fifth and clinching game on an overtime winner from Carl Hagelin. It was the earliest Sidney Crosby and the Penguins had been eliminated from the playoffs since his sophomore season in 2006–07. In the semi-finals the Rangers found themselves facing a familiar foe in Alexander Ovechkin and the Washington Capitals, the fifth meeting between the two franchises since 2009 (each team had won two). The Rangers fell behind 3-1 in the series and were down 1-0 in game five, a mere 101 seconds from elimination, before Chris Kreider broke the shutout. In overtime team captain Ryan McDonagh scored the game winner to send the series back to Washington. In game six Kreider once again sparked the team, scoring in the first minute and final second of the first period as the Rangers withstood a late rally by the Capitals to win 4–3 and force a game 7 at Madison Square Garden. Anticipation was extremely high for this game as prices for a seat reached record prices. Ovechkin opened the scoring on a high glove wrister in the first period but Rangers' rookie Kevin Hayes evened the score on the power play. In the first Game 7 overtime at Madison Square Garden since the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals, Derek Stepan scored the game-winning goal, sending the Rangers to their third conference finals in four years, where they would eventually be eliminated by the Tampa Bay Lightning.\n\nOn April 7, 2018, the Rangers fired Vigneault after the team finished at 34-39-9 and missed the playoffs for the first time since 2010.\n\nOn April 15, 2019, the Philadelphia Flyers hired Vigneault as their head coach.\n\nVigneault lives in Gatineau, Quebec. He is divorced and has two daughters, Andreane and Janie. When he coached the Canucks, Vigneault could often be found on game days jogging around Vancouver's Stanley Park. He is known by the Vancouver media for his sense of humour and for his resemblance to former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev.\n\n\n"}

In June 2017 ReTech made an initial public offering of stock on the Australian Stock Exchange.\n\nIn July 2009, Cheng was appointed to a year term as a Nominated Member of Parliament in Singapore's 11th Parliament. NMPs were supposed to reflect nonpartisan views; the newspaper Today questioned his appointment in light of his membership in Young PAP. Cheng resigned from Young PAP shortly thereafter. His term as an NMP ended after 21 months when Parliament was dissolved due to elections being called.\n\nIn 2012 Cheng was appointed to the newly formed Media Literacy Council (MLC) of Singapore's Ministry of Communications and Information, which was created to \"promote civility and responsibility on the Internet\" He served two two-year terms on the MLC.\n\nCheng often posts his views on socio-political issues in Singapore on Facebook, and is known for attracting controversy at times for his outspoken views and for his personal attacks against people with whom he disagrees.\n\nIn November 2015, while he was on the Media Literacy Council, Cheng wrote provocative comments about killing the children of terrorists on the Facebook page of entrepreneur and commentator Devadas Krishnadas. His comments led to a verbal chiding from Tan Cheng Han, the Chairman of the MLC. In addition, two reports calling for investigation were filed with police, including one by Augustin Lee Tze Shih, organising secretary of the People's Power Party. Cheng apologized to the MLC.\n\nAmos Yee, a teenager who had been previously jailed for comments offensive to the Singaporean government, was convicted and jailed in 2016 for \"hurting religious feelings\" in his online responses to Cheng's Facebook posts. In March 2017, a United States judge granted Yee political asylum, citing the different ways that Cheng and Yee had been treated, where Cheng was not charged, and Yee was charged and convicted.\n\nControversial opinions have included advocating in 2017 that Singapore's arts should not be funded by the government, and supporting the Population White Paper in 2015.\n"}

Therrien formerly coached the Montreal Canadiens and the Pittsburgh Penguins.\n\nPrior to his coaching career, Therrien played professionally for three years as a defenceman in the American Hockey League (AHL), compiling a total of 86 points in 206 games and winning the Calder Cup in 1985 with the Sherbrooke Canadiens, on the same team as eventual Hockey Hall of Famer Patrick Roy. When his playing career ended, Therrien worked for a time as a lineman for Bell Canada, with a sideline as a bodyguard for Quebec singing star Roch Voisine, with whom he had once played hockey, while working his way into a coaching career.\n\nBefore coaching in the professional leagues, Therrien was a coach in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL), first as an assistant with the Laval Titan and later as head coach for the Granby Prédateurs, with whom the club won the Memorial Cup in 1996, ending a 25-year championship drought in the tournament for a team from Quebec. He is a single parent of two children, Elizabeth and Charles.\n\nIn 2000, after stumbling out to a 5–13–2 record, the Montreal Canadiens fired Head Coach Alain Vigneault and hired rookie Michel Therrien. The Canadiens went 23–27–6–6 under Therrien and missed the 2001 Stanley Cup playoffs.\n\nIn his first full season as the Canadiens head coach, Michel led the Habs to an impressive record of 36–31–15, a 16-point improvement from the previous year. In the 2002 playoffs, Therrien's Canadiens upset the top-seeded Boston Bruins in six games before losing to the Carolina Hurricanes.\n\nFor two-and-a-half seasons, Therrien was the head coach of the American Hockey League (AHL)'s Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins. He led the Penguins to the Calder Cup playoffs in 2004 and 2005.\n\nAfter leading Wilkes-Barre/Scranton to a franchise-record start (21–1–2–1) in the 2005–06 season, Therrien was promoted by Pittsburgh on December 15, 2005, as a mid-season replacement for Ed Olczyk. The Pens, however, did not turn their season around, going 14–29–8 under Therrien. The Penguins started the 2006–07 season in mediocre fashion. However, they picked up play in January, going 14–0–2 on one stretch. The streak led the Penguins to a 47–24–11 record and a fifth-place berth in the 2007 playoffs. The Pens, however, fell in five games to the Ottawa Senators.\nDuring the 2006–07 season, Therrien coached the Penguins to one of the most successful single-season improvements in NHL history, finishing with a 47–24–11 record (105 points), a berth in the 2007 playoffs and a nomination for the Jack Adams Award as the NHL's Coach of the Year.\n\nDespite a slow start the next season, in 2007–08, the Pens began to turn things around in November 2007. They would go on to win the 2008 Winter Classic and later clinch the Atlantic Division with a 4–2 win against their state-rivals, the Philadelphia Flyers. In the first round of the 2008 playoffs, the Pens avenged their 2007 playoff series loss by downing the Ottawa Senators in a four-game sweep. They then defeated the New York Rangers and the Philadelphia Flyers each in five games to win the 2008 Eastern Conference Championship and the Prince of Wales Trophy. The Pens eventually lost in the 2008 Stanley Cup Finals to the Detroit Red Wings in six games, finishing the playoffs with a 14–6 record. On July 18, 2008, Therrien signed a contract extension with the Penguins through to the 2010–11 NHL season.\n\nThe next season, the Penguins shot out to one of the best starts in franchise history, only to slow down considerably heading into December. The slide continued, and on February 15, 2009, a day after a 6–2 loss to the Toronto Maple Leafs and with the Penguins struggling to stay in the playoff race, Therrien was relieved of his duties as head coach of the Penguins. Therrien finished two games behind Red Kelly for the second-longest tenure as Penguins' head coach. Dan Bylsma took over as Therrien's replacement. After his termination, he continued to reside in Pittsburgh and followed the team as they advanced to the 2009 Stanley Cup Finals and won the Stanley Cup in Game 7 in Detroit.\n\nOn June 5, 2012, Montreal Canadiens executive vice president and general manager Marc Bergevin announced the appointment of Michel Therrien as the club’s new head coach. His first season was a successful one, leading the Habs to first in the Northeast Division after the team had finished last in the previous season. However, the team ended up losing in the first round to the Ottawa Senators in five games. In his second season, 2013–14, he led the Habs to the Eastern Conference Finals, though the team lost to the New York Rangers in six games. At the end of the season, general manager Marc Bergevin rewarded Therrien with a new contract, a four-year extension. With the contract, he became the highest-paid coach in the history of the Canadiens. In 2015–16, after starting the season with a 19–4–3 win-loss record, the Canadiens collapsed following an injury to goaltender Carey Price, ending the season with a .500 record and failing to make the playoffs. On November 4, 2016, his 53rd birthday, the Canadiens got blown out 10-0 by the Columbus Blue Jackets. On January 7, 2017, Therrien recorded his 400th win as a coach in a 5–3 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs. However, on February 14, 2017, he was once again fired by the Canadiens and replaced as head coach by Claude Julien for the second time. At the time of his firing, the Canadiens were ranked first in the Atlantic Division with a 31–19–8 record. Their season started with a strong 13-1-1 start, but followed with a disappointing run of 18-18-7 which led to his firing.\n\nOn May 5, 2019 Michel Therrien returned to the NHL as an assistant coach to Alain Vigneault of the Philadelphia Flyers.\n"}

In 1946, he and his family returned to the Netherlands. De Groot's father, however, was obliged to return to Indonesia, so De Groot went to stay with his aunt in Haarlem. In 1951, his father came back and in 1952, the family moved, with his new stepmother, to Heemstede. De Groot lived in Heemstede in the same street as one of his future lyricists, Lennaert Nijgh, who was a friend of De Groot's stepbrother.\n\nIn 1960, De Groot met Nijgh at the Coornhert Lyceum in Haarlem. At that time, De Groot was already singing in the style of Jaap Fischer and Jacques Brel. Lennaert Nijgh wrote his lyrics. After their high school-period they both decided to go to a film academy. In their last year, Nijgh made the short movie \"Feestje Bouwen\", for which De Groot wrote two songs. During one of the presentations of the movie, television journalist Ed Lautenslager became impressed with De Groot's talent, and subsequently helped him to get a contract with record label Philips. De Groot's first single, \"Strand\", appeared in 1964 and led to some media attention. He followed it up with \"Elegie prenatale\" and \"De morgen\", and his recurring appearances in the television show \"Kaberet Kroniek\" made De Groot a minor national celebrity. The single \"Noordzee\" in February 1964 was a much bigger hit, but the huge breakthrough came in 1966 with Lennaert Nijgh's adaptation of a song from Charles Aznavour's \"Une enfant de seize ans\", retitled \"Meisje van 16\". This was De Groot's first song to appear in a music chart. He soon quit his job to become a full-time singer. After a while, his first album \"Boudewijn de Groot\", recorded with the Frans de Kok orchestra, was released by record label Decca.\n\nMuch of Nijgh's lyrics included social criticism, so after the release of his first album in 1966 De Groot was labeled as a protest singer, an image confirmed for the mainstream audience by the success of his song \"Welterusten Meneer de President\" (\"Goodnight, Mister President\") on the Vietnam War. De Groot's second album \"Voor de overlevenden\" was released later in 1966. The arranger and conductor for this album, Bert Paige, continued to work with De Groot until the 1970s. However, during carnival 1967, \"Het Land van Maas en Waal\" was released and became De Groot's third hit. Under the name \"Baldwin\", an English version of these songs appeared in the U.K. (\"The land at rainbow's end\"). The next single, \"Onder ons\", just made it into the charts. By this time, De Groot had already recorded songs like \"Verdronken vlinder\", \"Testament\" and \"Beneden alle peil\", which would later become successful but would never enter hit charts. De Groot and Nijgh became influenced by the Flower Power movement during that time and created the album \"Picknick\". The songs sounded a lot like a mix of George Harrison's work on The Beatles albums and their own work. The album was well received, and the single \"Picknick\" was a hit. The duet \"Meester Prikkebeen\" with Elly Nieman entered the charts two months later. Two other songs, \"Waterdrager\" and \"Als de rook om je hoofd is verdwenen\" were minor hits in 1968.\n\nIn 1968, De Groot decided he didn't want to perform live anymore and stopped his collaboration with Nijgh and his band, The Names and Faces. In 1969, De Groot worked with Eelco Gelling, the guitarist of \"Cuby and the Blizzards\" and, under the name Tower, they recorded the single \"In Your Life\", which became a hit. After this, he started working with Lucien Duzee, and they created his fourth album \"Nacht en ontij\". The record didn't sound like De Groot's old work, and the single didn't make it in the charts. The new singles from Tower also failed, and De Groot gave up singing. He moved to a farm in Dwingeloo. After a year, De Groot returned as the producer of Rob de Nijs and Oscar Benton.\n\nIn 1971, his record label released a compilation album called \"Vijf jaar hits\". It sold over 100,000 copies and, subsequently, De Groot frequently reappeared on the radio. Much of his old work was re-appreciated, and \"Als de rook om je hoofd is verdwenen\" became a hit again. Another compilation album called \"Dubbel twee\" was also released. De Groot began working with Nijgh again, and they released the album \"Hoe sterk is de eenzame fietser\" in 1973. The song \"Jimmy\" became his greatest hit in 5 years, constituting a definite comeback. Boudewijn received an Edison and a Gouden Harp (Dutch music awards).\n\nMeanwhile, De Groot en Nijgh had orchestrated the comeback of Rob de Nijs, writing a string of hits for him, including \"Jan Klaassen de trompetter\" and \"Malle Babbe\".\n\nIn 1975, Boudewijn wrote the album \"Waar ik woon en wie ik ben\" with his old classmate René Daalder. The single \"Ik ben Ik\" became a hit. De Groot moved to California a few months later for inspiration, and did not return until 1977. He made no new records in this period, but toured in Belgium and the Netherlands. One of the songs he wrote in California, \"Annabel\", became a hit for Hans de Booy. In April 1980, his new album \"Van een afstand\" was released. It contained (the single of) the title song for the movie \"Tip van de sluier\". Neither the single nor the movie were a success, but the album won an Edison. De Groot quit in 1984 after the release of his 8th album, \"Maalstroom\".\n\nAfter his retirement from music, De Groot wanted to translate, compose film music and perform when asked. He composed the music for the TV series \"De familie Wijntak\" (1986) and for the movies \"Lost in Amsterdam\" (1989), \"Let the Music Dance\" (1990) and a 1987 Dutch adaptation of the hit musical Nunsense. He acted in the musical \"Tjechov\", where he played the lead role of Anton Chekhov and in \"Het dagboek van Anne Frank\" where he played the role of Otto Frank. Under the pseudonym \"Frank de Groot\", he has translated seven Stephen King novels and in 2011 Scott Turow's Presumed Innocent into Dutch.\n\nIn 1996, Boudewijn de Groot released \"Een Nieuwe Herfst\". His new record label Mercury also released an album with old work and newly released work. De Groot started going on tour again and he reappeared in some TV-shows. He started writing non-commercial albums alongside with Nijgh and released \"Een eiland in de verte\" in 2003. Nijgh died in 2002. On 19 January 2007 De Groot issued \"Lage Landen\"; he wrote most of the lyrics, but also used texts of Lennaert Nijgh and Freek de Jonge. The album was recorded in Nashville. On 3 February 2007 \"Lage Landen\" reached the top rankings on hit lists in the Netherlands.\nOn 20 April 2015 De Groot issued \"\" (\"Behind glass\"). During the tour he played songs from his post-comeback-era as well as rare older tracks.\n\nIn 2016 De Groot formed the supergroup Vreemde Kostgangers (Strange Boarders) with Henny Vrienten (bass-player of Doe Maar) and George Kooymans (guitarist of Golden Earring); they successfully released two albums in 2017 and did sold out tours consisting of collective songs and solo-material.\n\nIn 2018, De Groot released \"Even weg\"; he recorded this album with tribute-band The Dutch Eagles.\n\nOn February 6, 2020, De Groot appeared on talkshow \"De Wereld Draait Door\" to announce that he'll retire from performing after one last tour with Vreemde Kostgangers.\n\nBoudewijn de Groot is married to Anja Bak. He has three children with his first wife; Marcel, Caya and Jim, all of whom have music- and acting careers.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He undertook several educational trips to Rome and Paris between 1888 and 1892, having won the Royal Academy Gold Medal and Travelling Studentship in 1889. In the 1890s, he worked as an illustrator, eventually settling in London. In 1891, he married Ida (née Williams), with whom he had a daughter, Yvonne. He died of arteriosclerosis at the age of 56, in his home on Abbey Road.\n\nDraper's most productive period began in 1894. He focused mainly on mythological themes from ancient Greece. His painting \"The Lament for Icarus\" (1898) won the gold medal at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1900 and was later bought for the Tate Gallery by the Chantrey Trustees. He was also responsible for the decoration of the ceiling of the Drapers' Hall in the City of London. Though Draper was neither a member nor an associate of the Royal Academy, he took part in the annual expositions from 1890 on. In later years as the public tastes changed and mythological scenes became less popular he concentrated more on portraits.\n\nDuring his lifetime Draper was quite famous, a well-known portrait painter. In his last years, his popularity faded, though there has recently been a revival of interest in his work on the art market. The sale of his painting \"The Sea Maiden\" by the Royal Cornwall Museum in 2010, to help secure its finances, generated debate about the policy of disposing of art works for this purpose.\n\nSimon Toll's book on Draper, published by the Antique Collector's Club is the only modern study of his work and includes a full catalogue of his drawings and paintings.\n\n\n"}

Located in the south-central part of the Uummannaq Fjord, it is home to the most prominent mountain on the Arctic coast of western Greenland and to Uummannaq, the largest town north of Ilulissat.\n\nThe island is separated from Nuussuaq Peninsula in the southwest by Sarqarput Strait in the southern arm of Uummannaq Fjord. In the east, the island is separated from the Salliaruseq Island by the wide Assorput Strait. To the north, the central arm of Uummannaq Fjord separates it from the large Appat Island and the skerries of Saattut.\n\nThe island has a very undeveloped coast, with a handful of small, rocky bays primarily in the southernmost, inhabited part. The only significant bay is Qasigissat () on the southwestern shore. The weakly indented Iterlak bay is located on the northwestern coast of the island. The sea is the only means of transport to the uninhabited northern part of the island.\n\nThe Uummannaq port occupies a small inlet in the southeastern end of the island. It is not deep enough to service large cruise ships, but sufficiently deep to handle supply and fishing ships of Royal Arctic Line and Royal Greenland, as well as motorboats and lesser fishing boats. There are several small bays between the port and Nuussuatsiaq promontory, in the vicinity of the heliport.\n\nFishermen of Uummannaq town peruse the entire southern coast for anchorage of smaller fishing boats and motorboats. Outside the urbanized part of the island there are several inlets and coves providing protection for fishing nets and, in the summer, dogsleds. During summertime, a small and otherwise economically uninteresting skerry in Qasigissat Bay is used as an observation point for marine life, particularly fish schools migrating alongside the coast.\n\nThere are two significant lakes on the island: \"Tasersuaq\" lake, and the \"Blue Lake\". There are also several tiny ponds on the plateau, south of Uummannaq Mountain.\n\nThe Blue Lake is located in a depression of the south-central plateau, at approximately , to the north of the football pitch. Pipes laid on the ground carry potable water from the lake to the central waterworks installation.\n\nTasersuaq (Greenlandic for \"large lake\") is the largest lake situated in the southern part of the island, at approximately . It is surrounded by small hills from the west and south, and by taller cliffs of the plateau from the east and north. The northernmost houses in Uummannaq are located due west of the lake. Tasersuaq is the main water reservoir serving Uummannaq town, with pipe waterworks leading southwards through a deep gully.\n\nThe entire island is rocky, with the southern half progressively rising in altitude in the northern direction, towards the Uummannaq Twin Peaks mountain. The area south of the geographical center of the island is a plateau of folded granite hills, dotted with tiny ponds. The plateau falls into the surrounding waters with steep cliffs crevassed with couloirs. The northeastern coast under the walls of the mountain features a large cone of loose scree. Movement on the outskirts of the interior is restricted to mountaineering.\n\nUummannaq Mountain entirely dominates the landscape of the island, its base occupying its entire northern half. Formed of granite and basement gneiss, it is the most prominent mountain in the Arctic part of the west coast of Greenland. The mountain is a landmark of Greenland and a tourist magnet, often reproduced in art.\n\nThe mountain has two summits of similar height (the eastern summit being the higher), hence the name \"Uummannaq\", Greenlandic for \"heart-shaped\". Deep chimneys fall to the south and the north from the col between the western and eastern summits. Its eastern wall has no significant depressions, falling in a uniform cliff into Assorput Strait between Uummannaq Island and Salliaruseq Island.\n\nThe only settlement on the island is Uummannaq town, one of the cultural centers of northwestern Greenland. The town occupies approximately 10% of the island area, concentrated around the southern tip of the island.\n\nThe island is well connected with the rest of Greenland. Air Greenland has its regional helicopter hub on the island, serving all settlements in the region. Several daily helicopter flights link the island with the nearby Qaarsut Airport on Nuussuaq Peninsula, from where STOL connections are available to Upernavik, Sisimiut, Ilulissat and further to central and southern Greenland.\n\nUntil 2006, Arctic Umiaq Line had provided ferry services from Nuuk to Upernavik, calling at Uummannaq, Ilulissat, and Aasiaat within the Qaasuitsup municipality. M/S \"Sarpik Ittuk\"−which serviced Disko Bay, Uummannaq Fjord and the Upernavik Archipelago−was sold in 2006 to Nova Cruising, a company from The Bahamas. Since then the ferry services of AUL are available only southwards from Ilulissat, operated with the remaining ship, M/S \"Sarfaq Ittuk\".\n\nThe cargo/passenger boat \"Pajuttaat\" of Royal Arctic Line links Uummannaq with Upernavik. Individual transport and sightseeing boats can be chartered from the Uummannaq Tourist Service. The island is often visited by cruise ships, such as Norway's Hurtigruten.\n\n"}

During World War II, it was occupied by Nazi Germany, who converted the local factory to war-materials production.\n\nThe town received its present status in 1965.\n\n\n"}

It was home of the National Hockey League (NHL) Montreal Canadiens from 1920 to 1926, before moving to the then two-year-old Montreal Forum. It had a capacity of 6,000 seated, 10,000 when including standing room. It was a natural ice rink, without machines to freeze the ice mechanically.\n\nIt opened, partly unfinished, on January 10, 1920 for a game between the Canadiens and Toronto, won by Montreal 14–7. A week later, parts of a balcony broke before a game with Ottawa, and police stopped sales at 6,500. The rink had been built quickly to house the Canadiens who had lost their arena, Jubilee Arena to fire in 1919.\n\nThe Canadiens eventually moved from the arena because of its uneven natural ice surface. The team wanted a mechanically-frozen ice surface but was never able to get one in the rink, as owner Thomas Duggan concentrated on getting American franchises into the NHL, rather than fulfilling his statements that he would install ice-making equipment in the arena. \n\nAfter the Canadiens left, the arena was converted into an auditorium and then into a commercial building. While an auditorium, Enrico Caruso sang there, and Norman Bethune once gave an important speech to rally his supporters. On February 29, 2000, it was destroyed by fire. A Provigo supermarket now stands on the arena's former site.\n\n"}

{"id": "2155645", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2155645", "title": "Montreal Arena", "text": "Montreal Arena\n\nThe Montreal Arena, also known as Westmount Arena, was an indoor arena located in Westmount, Quebec, Canada on the corner of St. Catherine Street and Wood Avenue. It was likely one of the first arenas designed expressly for hockey, opening in 1898. It was the primary site of amateur and professional ice hockey in Montreal until 1918.\n\nOpened on December 31, 1898, it held 10,000 people, 4300 seated. It held a refreshment buffet and smoking rooms, with rugs available for rental to sit on. It is likely the third arena designed expressly for ice hockey, after the St. Nicholas Rink in New York City, and the Dey's Skating Rink in Ottawa, which both opened in 1896.\n\nThe ice rink ends were not squared off but rounded off. The ends were somewhat semi-circular, possibly the first design of its kind. A puck could be shot along the outside rim, slide along the corners, pass behind the goal and come out the other side. That type of shot is common in hockey today and is called \"rimmed around.\" The rounded-corners design spread to other arenas. In 1902, after Ottawa's Dey Rink was demolished due to a storm, it was rebuilt with rounded ends to match the Montreal Arena. The fence along the ice surface was increased in height to , an increase from the Victoria Skating Rink's one foot high boards. The first artificial ice-making plant in Montreal was installed in the Arena in 1915.\n\nThe owners of the Montreal Arena, the Canadian Arena Company, later built the Arena Gardens in Toronto, and operated the Toronto NHL franchise in 1917-18. Principals of the Arena Company, such as William Northey, would later be involved in the building of the Montreal Forum and the founding of the Montreal Maroons.\n\nA fire started in the ice-making plant causing the arena to burn down on January 2, 1918. It began mid-day, when the only people in the building were the superintendent James McKeene and his family, who were eating in their apartment on the north side of the structure; all escaped safely but they lost most of their belongings, as well as a car stored in the annex. Damage was estimated at $150,000, including the uniforms and sticks of the Wanderers and Canadiens, with only a third covered by insurance. The blaze led the Montreal Wanderers, already on shaky grounds, to disband within days and the Canadiens to move back to Jubilee Arena, which itself would be destroyed by fire, the next year. In 1924, the new Montreal Forum was built one block to the east.\n\nThe current arena address is 4055 rue Ste. Catherine St. West. A modern Westmount Arena was first built here in 1957 to serve the residents of Westmount, Quebec. It held a collection of replica Stanley Cup banners to honour the early ice hockey teams that won the Stanley Cup. Stanley Cup banners were not hung in the early days of ice hockey. The banners were removed after it was rebuilt into the Westmount Recreation Centre (Centre des loisirs de Westmount) in 2013. It still serves as a hockey arena with 2 NHL sized rinks underground.\n\nAt first, it hosted the Montreal senior men's amateur hockey teams of the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada, including the Montreal, Shamrock and Victoria hockey clubs. The Wanderers would start play there in 1904. Later, it served as the home rink for the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey Association and National Hockey League from 1911 until 1918.\n\nIn 1907, it was the site of one of hockey's first player brawls. On January 12, 1907, the game between the heated rivals Ottawa Hockey Club and the Montreal Wanderers degenerated into a free for all. Ottawa players Charles Spittal, Alf Smith and Harry Smith each knocked out a Montreal player cold and received game misconducts. Cecil Blachford, Ernest Johnson and Hod Stuart all required hospital treatment. Despite the injuries, the Wanderers won the game 4–2. The ECAHA convened a week later to consider discipline for the Ottawa players and when no agreement was found, league president McRobie resigned. When Ottawa returned for a January 26 against the Montreal Victorias, Spittal and the Smiths were arrested for assault, each eventually paying $20 fines.\n\nThe newly formed NHL played its first game in the Arena on December 19, 1917, with the Wanderers earning a 10-9 win over the newly established Toronto Arenas. A French language newspaper ad re-discovered in 2017 established that the Montreal game started at 8:15 pm, ahead of another game that same night in Ottawa scheduled to begin at 8:30 pm. Wanderers defenceman Dave Ritchie scored the league's first goal early in the game.\n\nThe building was also used for exhibition space. Horse shows, car shows, motor-boat displays, concerts, and bazaars were held. New York's Metropolitan Opera performed at the arena, as well as singers such as Melba, Caruso, Calve and Albani.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2155646", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2155646", "title": "Immigration to Germany", "text": "Immigration to Germany\n\nGermany is the second most popular migration destination in the world, after the United States of America. By UN estimates, as of 2017, 12,165,083 people living in Germany are immigrants, or about 14.8% of the German population. The majority of immigrants in Germany are from Eastern Europe, Southern Europe and Middle East.\n\nThe German Government has been keen to encourage immigration over the past 50 years, to address the low birth rate in the country.\n\nOn 1 January 2005, a new immigration law came into effect. The political background to this new law was that Germany, for the first time ever, was acknowledged to be a destination for immigrants. The practical changes to immigration procedures were relatively minor. New immigration categories, such as \"highly skilled professional\" and \"scientist\" were introduced to attract valuable professionals to the German labour market. The development within German immigration law shows that immigration of skilled employees and academics has eased while the labour market remains closed for unskilled workers.\n\nIn April 2012, European Blue Card legislation was implemented in Germany, allowing highly skilled non-EU citizens easier access to work and live in Germany, subject to certain requirements. According to the federal statistics office in 2016, over one out of five Germans has at least partial roots outside of the country.\n\nTowards the end of World War II,and in its aftermath, up to 12 million refugees of ethnic Germans, so-called \"Heimatvertriebene\" (German for \"expellees\", literally \"homeland displaced persons\") were forced to migrate from the former German areas, as for instance Silesia or East Prussia, to the new formed States of post-war Germany and Allied-occupied Austria, because of changing borderlines in Europe. A big wave of immigration to Germany started in the 1960s. Due to a shortage of laborers during the Wirtschaftswunder (\"economic miracle\") in the 1950s and 1960s, the West German government signed bilateral recruitment agreements with Italy in 1955, Greece in 1960, Turkey in 1961, Morocco in 1963, Portugal in 1964, Tunisia in 1965 and Yugoslavia in 1968. These agreements allowed the recruitment of so-called \"Gastarbeiter\" (\"guest workers\") to work in the industrial sector in jobs that required few qualifications.\nChildren born to 'Gastarbeiter' received the right to reside in Germany but were not granted citizenship; this was known as the \"Aufenthaltsberechtigung\" (\"right of residence\"). Many of the descendants of those \"Gastarbeiter\" still live in Germany and many have acquired German citizenship.\n\nThe German Democratic Republic (GDR) recruited workers from outside its borders differently. It criticized the Gastarbeiter policy, calling it capitalist exploitation of poor foreigners, and preferred to see its foreign workers as socialist \"friends\" who traveled to the GDR from other communist or socialist countries in order to learn skills which could then be applied in their home countries. Most of these came from North Vietnam, North Korea, Angola, Mozambique and Cuba.\nFollowing German reunification in 1990 many foreign workers in the new federal states of the former GDR had no legal status as immigrant workers under the Western system. Consequently, many faced deportation or premature termination of residence and work permits, as well as open discrimination in the workplace.\n\nDuring the 1980s, a small but steady stream of East Germans immigrating to the West (\"Übersiedler\") had begun with the gradual opening of the Eastern bloc. It swelled to 389,000 in 1990. After the immigration law change in 1993, it decreased by more than half to 172,000.\nDuring the same time, the number of ethnic Germans (\"Aussiedler\") -Germans who had settled in German territory sometimes for centuries until WWII, i.e. in present-day Eastern Europe and Russia- began to rise in the mid-1980s to about 40,000 each year. In 1987, the number doubled, in 1988 it doubled again and in 1990 nearly 400,000 immigrated.\nUpon arrival, ethnic Germans became citizens at once according to Article 116 of the Basic Law, and received financial and many social benefits, including language training, as many did not speak German. Social integration was often difficult, even though ethnic Germans were entitled to German citizenship, but to many Germans they did not seem German. In 1991, restrictions went into effect, in that ethnic Germans were assigned to certain areas, losing benefits if they were moving. The German government also encouraged the estimated several million ethnic Germans living in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe to remain there. Since January 1993, no more than 220,000 ethnic Germans may immigrate per year.\n\nAnd in parallel a third stream of immigration starting in the mid 1980s were war refugees, of which West Germany accepted more than any other West European country due to an unqualified right to asylum. From 1986 to 1989, about 380,000 refugees sought asylum, mostly from Iran and Lebanon. Between 1990 and 1992 nearly 900,000 people from former Yugoslavia, Romania, or Turkey sought asylum in a united Germany. In 1992, 438,000 applied, and Germany admitted almost 70 percent of all asylum seekers registered in the European Community. By comparison, in 1992 only about 100,000 people sought asylum in the U.S. \nThe growing numbers of asylum seekers led to a constitutional change severely restricting the previously unqualified right of asylum, that former \"refugees [had] held sacred because of their reliance on it to escape the Nazi regime\". In December 1992, the Bundestag passed legislation amending the Basic Law, in which article 16 was changed to 16a. Persons entering Germany save from third countries were no longer granted asylum, and applications from nationals of so-called safe third countries of origin were refused. , the numbers of asylum seekers had dropped significantly.\n\nDue to the outbreak of the Yugoslav Wars, a rising number of refugees headed to Germany and other European countries. Though only about 5 percent of the asylum applications were approved and appeals sometimes took years to be processed, many asylum seekers were able to stay in Germany and received financial and social aid from the government., the approval rate was about 30 percent, and 127,000 people sought asylum. During 2014 a total of about 202,834 people sought asylum in Germany. Even more asylum seekers will be expected for 2015 with more than 800,000 people.\n\nAs of 2014, about 16.3 million people with an immigrant background were living in Germany, accounting for every fifth person Of those 16.3 million, 8.2 million had no German citizenship, more than ever before. Most of them had Turkish, Eastern European or Southern European background. The majority of new foreigners coming to Germany in 2014 were from new EU member states such as Poland, Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia, non-EU European countries like Albania, North Macedonia, Switzerland and Norway or from the Middle East, Africa, East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, South America, North America, Australia and Zealandia. Due to ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, many people are hoping to seek asylum in the European Union and Germany.\nThe vast majority of immigrants are residing in the so-called old states of Germany.\n\nIn 2014 more than 276,000 people entered illegally into the European Union, an increase of 138% from 2013. The numbers of asylum applications and illegal immigration to Europe and especially Germany rose from 2013 onwards, the refugee camps became overcrowded.\n\nOn 20 March 2015 the Federal Minister of the Interior of Germany stated that the average duration of an asylum application procedure was about months. Because there are often problems with the identification of refugees, finger print scans will be introduced, and individuals will be checked in more detail to identify their true place of origin. Due to the high burden for the several German States, the Federal Minister of the Interior also claims to deport illegals more quickly and individuals with denied asylum applications.\n\nThe original prediction of about 450,000 asylum seekers for 2015 in Germany rose to over 800,000 people, which is almost double the number of the previous prediction for this year and four times the amount of the prior year. In a letter written by the Vice-Chancellor of Germany to his fellow party members, the possible number of 800,000 refugees was raised again to over 1,000,000 refugees in Germany.\n\nThe Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs said that alleged refugees and illegals, especially from the Western Balkans area who have no chance of staying in Germany must be sent back to their country of origin as soon as possible. The number of asylum seekers from the Western Balkans area has dramatically increased during the last year. Migrants from the Western Balkans area especially from Kosovo see that as an opportunity, since they can stay longer and make most of their time, as the application needs more time to be processed.EU Asylum Policy pdf Furthermore, the deportation of illegal residents in Germany has almost doubled in the first 6 months in comparison to the same period in the prior year.\n\nIn 2015, Germany received 900 000 asylum seekers and spent €16 billion (0.5% of GDP) on its migrants that year.\n\nIn 2017 the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees in Germany reported that of the 340,000 migrants who participated in German language courses during 2016, less than half at 113,050 received a passing grade. The authority had no idea why.\n\nIn April 2018 more than half, at 55%, of the recipients of unemployment benefits had a migration background. According to the Federal Employment Agency (German: \"Bundesagentur für Arbeit\") this was due to the migrants lacking either employable skills or knowledge of the language.\n\nThe 2018 Ellwangen police raid, in which residents of a migrant shelter rioted to prevent police from deporting an asylum seeker whose claim had been deemed invalid, sparked a significant political debate.\n\nIn 2015, the majority of Germans were extremely supportive towards the mass migration of immigrants entering into Germany. The prime minister of Germany, Angela Merkel, coined the phrase which most of the country rallied behind, “Wir schaffen das,” which translates into English as, we can do it. In 2015, the brunt of the European immigration crisis was placed on Germany when 890,000 refugees crossed the border and applied for asylum, most of them fleeing from the Syrian War. A 2015 survey shows that 46% of the entire German population was facilitating help in some way for refugees. All over, German citizens were creating initiatives and support groups for asylum seekers as well as donating their time to help on site with refugees. Media helped shape the German attitudes as well as put pressure on the government by covering the victims of immigration and by showing individual stories, which humanized them. After the events in Cologne on New Year’s Eve, there was a drastic change of media coverage, as well as the public opinion of immigrants. The media went from showing women and children who suffered from war crime victims, to Arab men assaulting German women in large groups. The media also highlighted massive groups of immigrants crossing the border into Germany instead of the earlier coverage of individual refugee’s stories. This caused Germans to now fear how expensive all of these immigrants would be, the earlier phrase, “Wir schaffen das” suggested that funding for these refugees was not an issue. The cost to support all of these refugees added up to around 21 billion euros, about the size of Germanys defense budget. \nGovernmental opinion has also shifted over the years. The intake of refugees has consistently dropped over the last few years; however, the number of deportations only continued to increase and leveled out at around 20,000. \n\nThe influx of migrant refugees has had a negative impact on the crime rates of Germany. Since the 1990s, the crime rate has been dropping in Germany until 2014. However, the rate of crime has been increasing over the last few years. From 2014 to 2016, the amount of crime has increased. Violent crimes saw an increase of 7.2% over that period of time. A government backed study of the Lower Saxony Region showed an increase of 10.2% in violent crimes. This region is also one of the regions to take in the most asylum seekers. Asylum seekers are four times as represented in the number of suspects in police investigations compared to the percentage of the total population of Germany. \n\nFrom 2013 to the end of 2014, the economy in Germany was on the rise. Germany’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rose from 3425143.54 Million EUR, with a growth of 0.4% in 2013, to 3568459.19 Million EUR, with a growth of 2.2% in 2014.The unemployment rate was on a slight decline, falling from 5.1 in 2013 to 4.9 in 2014. In regards to price stability, the consumer price index (CPI), or inflation, was also in a decline, increasing by only 0.19 % compared to 1.43% in 2013. \n\nBy the end of 2015, the year the refugee crisis in Germany began, Germany seen a 13.6% decrease in their GDP, which was 3084251.83 Million EUR, with a GPD growth of 1.7%. The welfare for refugees in Germany was increased by 5.3 billion EUR in 2015, a 169% increase from 2014. Despite the increase of refugees, the unemployment rate in Germany continued to drop, as it fell to 4.4 in 2015. The CPI in Germany continued to slow, going up by 0.17 % in 2015. \n\nIn response to the refugee crisis, in 2016 the German federal government allocated 20.5 billion euros to support the estimated 1.3 million refugees that applied for asylum in Germany. In 2016, Germany’s GDP started to climb again as the year ended with a GDP of 3181438.22 Million EUR, with a growth of 2.2%. Germany also had a budget surplus of 6.2 billion EUR in 2016. Germany’s unemployment rate for 2016 went down to 3.9. Inflation, on the other hand, started to increase again for Germany, as the CPI went up by 1.50 % in 2016. \n\nBy the end of 2017, the growth of inflation went back down to a CPI increase of 1.38 %. Germany’s GDP was up to 3361529.23 Million EUR, with a growth of 2.5% and the unemployment rates for Germany continued to decrease to 3.6 in 2017. The German federal government also rose the number of funds allotted to the support of the refugees to 21.2 billion EUR in 2017. \n\nIn 2018, Germany’s GDP fully recovered from the decline that came in 2015 and surpassed the GDP in 2014 with a GDP of 3622825.59 Million EUR, with a growth of 1.5%. The unemployment rate in Germany decreased to 3.3 in 2018, despite an estimated 456,000 of the refugees that arrived in Germany between 2015 and 2016 remaining unemployed. Reportedly, 72% of the estimated 456,000 unemployed refugees were from Syria. Out of the refugees that entered Germany in 2015 and 2016, that had jobs, 372,000 were underemployed and one third only had temporary work, as of 2018.\n\nThe rate of inflation started to go back up again, as the CPI increased by 1.56% in 2018. The German federal government cut the number of funds allotted to the support of the refugees back down again to 20.8 euros billion in 2018. Currently, Germany is predicted to experience a substantial decrease in the German workforce due to the decline in Germany’s population growth. \n\nGermany’s population was recorded at 82.1 million in 2015 and is predicted to fall as low as 67.6 million by the year 2060. With 28% of German citizens already over the age of 60 and retired, top German economists predict that if Germany can successfully integrate the refugees that came to Germany in the 2015 to 2016 time period, the refugees will benefit this future workforce situation.\n\nEuropean Union free movement of workers principles require that all EU member state citizens have the right to solicit and obtain work in Germany free from discrimination on the basis of citizenship. These basic rules for freedom of movement are given in Article 39 of the Treaty on European Union. (see also Directive 2004/38/EC on the right to move and reside freely). However, citizens of Croatia are exempt from the free movement of workers principle for a transition period of no more than 7 years (ending 2020), after the country's EU Accession in 2013. (see for more details 2013 enlargement of the European Union#Post-accession access to free movement in other EU member states)\n\nImmigration to Germany as a non-EU-citizen is limited to skilled or highly educated workers and their immediate family members.\n\nSelf-employment requires either an initial investment of EUR 250,000 and the creation of a minimum 5 jobs.\n\nAccording to a study of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), around 54 percent of foreign students in Germany decide to stay after graduation.\n\nIn 2015, the majority of Germans were extremely supportive towards the mass migration of immigrants entering into Germany. The prime minister of Germany, Angela Merkel, coined the phrase which most of the country rallied behind, “Wir schaffen das,” which translates into English as, we can do it. In 2015, the brunt of the European immigration crisis was placed on Germany when 890,000 refugees crossed the border and applied for asylum, most of them fleeing from the Syrian War.

This caused Germans to now fear how expensive all of these immigrants would be, the earlier phrase, “Wir schaffen das” suggested that funding for these refugees was not an issue.\n\nGerman asylum law is based on the 1993 amendment of article 16a of the Basic Law as well as on the 1951 Convention and 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees.\n\nIn accordance with the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, Germany grants refugee status to persons that are facing prosecution because of their race, religion, nationality or belonging to a special group. Since 2005, recognized refugees enjoy the same rights as people who were granted asylum.\n\nThe distribution of refugees among the federal states is calculated using the \"Königsteiner Schlüssel\", which is recalculated annually.\n\nGermany hosts one of the largest populations of Turkish people outside Turkey. Kurds make up 80 to 90 percent of all Turkish refugees in Germany while the rest of the refugees are former Turkish military officers, teachers, and other types of public servants who fled the authoritarian government following the coup attempt in July 2016. Among Iraqi refugees in Germany, about 50 percent are Kurds. There are approximately 1.2 million Kurds in Germany.\n\nAn institute of forensic medicine in Münster determined the age of 594 of unaccompanied minors in 2019 and found that 234 (40%) were likely 18 years or older and would therefore be processed as adults by authorities. The sample was predominantly males from Afghanistan, Guinea, Algeria and Eritrea.\n\nA person who has immigrated to Germany may choose to become a German citizen. A right to become a German citizen (\"Anspruchseinbürgerung\") arises when a person:\n\nA person who does not have a right to naturalisation may nonetheless acquire German nationality by discretionary naturalisation (\"Ermessenseinbürgerung\"). The applicant must fulfill certain minimum requirements.\n\nSpouses and same-sex civil partners of German citizens may also be naturalised after only 3 years of residence (and two years of marriage).\n\nUnder certain conditions children born on German soil after the year 1990 are automatically granted German citizenship and, in most cases, also hold the citizenship of their parents' home country.\n\nApplications for naturalisation made outside Germany are possible under certain circumstances, but are relatively rare.\n\nAccording to the Federal Statistical Office of Germany in 2012, 92% of residents (73.9 million) in Germany had German citizenship, with 80% of the population being Germans (64.7 million) having no immigrant background. Of the 20% (16.3 million) people with immigrant background, 3.0 million (3.7%) had Turkish, 1.5 million (1.9%) Polish, 1.2 million (1.5%) Russian and 0.85 million (0.9%) Italian background.\n\nIn 2014, most people without German citizenship were Turkish (1.52 million), followed by Polish (0.67 million), Italian (0.57 million), Romanians (0.36 million) and Greek citizens (0.32 million).\n, the most common groups of resident foreign nationals in Germany were as follows:\n\nAccording to Eurostat 47.3 million people living in the European Union in 2010 were born outside their resident country which corresponds to 9.4% of the total EU population.

All ethnic crime gangs are collectively treated as organized crime.\n\nThe profitable activities of Arab clans have been noted by other minorities and Chechens, Albanians, Kosovars have created similar clan-based gangs. The clan-based structure has advantages in the individualised German society where people want to live in peace under the protection of the state. On the other hand, clans do not recognize rule of law and consider it incomprehensible that of police and courts protect people. A modern society only functions when people voluntarily follow its rules, while clan member consider themselves members of a family rather than citizens of a country. As such, they consider all people who follow the laws and rules weak and without protection.\n"}

He attended Monona Grove High School, graduating in 1968. While still in high school, he lost in the final match of the Wisconsin State Amateur Match Play Championship at Merrill Hills Country Club. Two years later, he won the 1969 Wisconsin State Amateur Championship at Westmoor Country Club in Brookfield, Wisconsin by defeating Archie Dadian in the match play final.\n\nNorth accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he played for coach Buster Bishop's Florida Gators men's golf team from 1969 to 1972. He was a three-time first-team All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) selection, and an All-American in 1970, 1971 and 1972. North graduated from Florida with a bachelor's degree in business administration in 1972, and was later inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as \"Gator Great.\"\n\nNorth turned professional in 1972. He had a moderately successful career on the PGA Tour made remarkable by the fact that two of his three wins on the Tour were in the U.S. Open. The first PGA Tour win of North's career came at the 1977 American Express Westchester Classic. He was 28 years old when he won the 1978 U.S. Open at Cherry Hills Country Club in Cherry Hills Village, Colorado. He moved into the lead after the second round, and was one shot ahead going into Sunday, but an erratic final round left him needing to make a five on the last hole to take the championship. He struggled up the 18th, finding the rough twice and then landing in a greenside bunker, but he made a four-foot putt to win by one stroke over J. C. Snead and Dave Stockton.\n\nAt the 1985 U.S. Open, on the South Course at Oakland Hills Country Club in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, North found himself two shots behind Taiwan's Chen Tze-chung going into the final round, but three shots clear of the rest of the field. Chen moved into a four-shot lead early, but threw the tournament wide open by shooting a quadruple bogey eight on the fifth hole. The lead swung between North, Chen, Denis Watson, Payne Stewart, and Dave Barr, who had surged into contention, but North went into the last hole with a two-shot lead, and his bogey five was enough to give him a second major championship.\n\nNorth played on the 1985 Ryder Cup team. In 1990, he won the PGA Grand Slam of Golf. Since turning 50 in 2000 North has played intermittently on the Champions Tour. His best finish at this level is second in the 2001 Emerald Coast Classic.\n\nIn 1993, North joined ESPN as an on-course reporter. In 2004, he was promoted to the lead on-course reporter for ESPN and ABC Sports. He also has been the lead analyst on ESPN's golf studio shows with host Scott Van Pelt since 2003. According to ESPN, his preview shows for major championships have been so in-depth that Tour players have been known to watch them to help with course strategy. From 2003 to 2014, North concluded his U.S. Open preview show by dressing up in a doctor's outfit and using an often modified formula to pick the winner of the tournament. North eliminates groups of players who he believes will not win by writing them on large white placards which he then tosses over the edge of the set. In addition, North occasionally serves as a substitute analyst for Wisconsin Badgers men's basketball radio broadcast. He was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1998.\n\n\n\nChampions Tour playoff record (0–1)\n\nCUT = missed the halfway cut<br>\n\"T\" indicates a tie for a place.\n\n\nCUT = missed the halfway cut\n\"T\" indicates a tie for a place\n\nProfessional\n\n\n"}

Amarapura is bounded by the Irrawaddy river in the west, Chanmyathazi Township in the north, and the ancient capital site of Ava (Inwa) in the south. It was the capital of Myanmar twice during the Konbaung period (1783–1821 and 1842–1859) before finally being supplanted by Mandalay 11 km north in 1859. It is historically referred to as Taungmyo (Southern City) in relation to Mandalay. Amarapura today is part of Mandalay, as a result of urban sprawl. The township is known today for its traditional silk and cotton weaving, and bronze casting. It is a popular tourist day-trip destination from Mandalay.\n\nAmarapura comes from (), which means \"city of immortality.\"\n\nAmarapura was founded by King Bodawpaya of the Konbaung Dynasty. He founded Amarapura as his new capital in May 1783. The new capital became a center of Buddhist reforms and learning. In 1800, Buddhist clergy from Sri Lanka obtained higher ordination in this city and founded the Amarapura Nikaya (Amarapura sect).\n\nIn 1810 the town was estimated to contain 170,000 inhabitants, but in that year it was destroyed by fire. Bodawpaya's grandson, King Bagyidaw moved the Court back to Ava in November 1821 and in 1827 the population of Amarapura was estimated at only 30,000. Bagyidaw's successor King Tharrawaddy again moved the royal capital back to Amarapura in February 1842. In February 1857, King Mindon began building Mandalay as his new capital city, 11 km north of Amarapura. With the royal treasury depleted by the Second Anglo-Burmese War of 1852, Mindon decided to reuse as much material from Amarapura as possible in the construction of Mandalay. The palace buildings were dismantled and moved by elephant to the new location, and the city walls were pulled down for use as building material for roads and railways. Part of the moat is still recognizable near the Bagaya Monastery. The city officially ceased being the capital on 23 May 1859 when Mandalay took over that role.\n\nThe ruins of the city wall show it to have been a square with a side of about three-quarters of a mile in length. At each corner stood a solid brick pagoda about 100 ft. high. The most remarkable edifice was a celebrated temple, adorned with 250 lofty pillars of gilt wood, and containing a colossal bronze statue of the Buddha.\n\nThe indigenous Burmese tradition of \"acheik\" textile weaving originates in Amarapura, and became popular during the Konbaung dynasty, during which sumptuary laws regulated who could wear \"acheik\" clothing. Amarapura, alongside Wundwin, remains a major domestic center of traditional \"acheik\" weaving, although in recent years, cheaper factory-produced imitations from China and India have significantly disrupted Myanmar's traditional cottage industry.\n\n\n\n"}

It was located at the area bounded by rue Alphonse-D. Roy Street (then known as rue Malborough) and rue Ste. Catherine Est. It was used for games of the Montreal Canadiens hockey club of the National Hockey Association (NHA) and National Hockey League (NHL) from 1909 to 1910 and again in 1919, and it was home of the Montreal Wanderers NHA club from 1910. It was originally built in 1908 and held seating for 3,200 spectators.\n\nIn 1918, when the Montreal Arena burned down, the Canadiens moved into Jubilee Arena on a full-time basis. On the afternoon of April 23, 1919, Jubilee Arena also burned down, forcing the Habs to build and move into the Mount Royal Arena which opened in 1920. The site of the old arena is now occupied by industrial tenants bearing no reminder of the former hockey venue.\n\nOwnership of the Jubilee Rink played a significant role in the 1909 formation of the NHA (later becoming the present NHL). In November 1909, the owner of the Eastern Canada Hockey Association (ECHA) Wanderers club announced he would move the team to the Jubilee, which he also owned. As it was smaller than the Montreal Arena, and the other three members of the ECHA would earn less revenues when playing there, these owners dissolved the ECHA, formed the Canadian Hockey Association (CHA) and invited applications from other teams. At a meeting on November 25, the CHA rejected the application of the Wanderers, represented at the meeting by player Jimmy Gardner, as well as the application of Ambrose O'Brien's Renfrew Creamery Kings. Before leaving the building, Gardner and O'Brien decided to form the NHA, which was finalized on December 2. Poor ticket sales collapsed the CHA eight weeks after it was formed, and the popular ECHA/CHA Ottawa Hockey Club (reigning Stanley Cup champion) and Montreal Shamrocks immediately joined the seven-week-old NHA.\n\n\n"}

She was a granddaughter of Captain Josiah Macy, originally of Nantucket, who founded a firm that became New York's first oil refinery in the 1860s (later sold to the Standard Oil Company).\n\nKate's father died in 1876 at only 39 years old, when Kate was still a teenager. Upon her father's death, she inherited an estimated $15 million (). She was plagued by some disease or condition; she was described as \"an invalid\" since her early twenties.\n\nAt twenty years old, she married lawyer and yachtsman Walter Graeme Ladd (1857–1933) on December 5, 1883. Walter won several yachting prizes, including some with his schooner, the \"Etak\" (\"Kate\" spelled backwards).\n\nIn 1925, she received an honorary Master of Arts degree from New Jersey College for Women.\n\nIn 1930, amidst the Great Depression, Ladd created the foundation named for her father with $5 million initial endowment () to be used for \"preventing and curing disease and relieving human suffering.\" The foundation was enormously successful. Within 15 years, its endowment had grown to $7 million and it had given away from $4.5 to $5 million to various causes, primarily to universities and agencies around the world. One of its earliest grants was in 1930, to fund a fellowship for a \"competent collaborator\" for Albert Einstein. The foundation funded research and studies on health topics including the process of aging, endocrinology, nutrition, and convalescent care.\n\nAfter World War II began, the foundation provided aid for war veterans but also launched specific research into treatments for surgical shock and burns, antibiotics such as sulfa and penicillin, and biological studies on the use of heavy hydrogen. In 1943, with the United States fighting in the Pacific theater, the foundation endowed $150,000 to create a five-year research and teaching in program of tropical medicine at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. It also invested $1 million into a research service to distribute medical literature to armies and navies of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.\n\nIn addition to her own foundation, Ladd gave generously to other charities.\n\nShe died in 1945 in Far Hills, New Jersey, and left a further $2.5 million to the Macy foundation.\n\nThe Ladds turned their Peapack-Gladstone, New Jersey estate, Natirar, into a convalescent home, which was used to give free two-week vacations for working class New Yorkers. It was shut down after the war began as it was set aside as an emergency shelter for New York City, which was making preparations for a possible blitz like Britain was experiencing.\n\nOn Walter Ladd's death, and in accordance with his will, Natirar was sold to King Hassan II of Morocco.

Due to its large area and population, first a branch district office of Yan Nawa was set up on 9 March 1989 to serve the people in three \"khwaeng\" of Yan Nawa. And then on 9 November 1989, the Sathon District was established inheriting the area once served by the branch office.\n\nThe district is named after Sathon Road and Khlong Sathon. Khlong Sathon, the older of the two, is a canal (\"khlong\") dug for public transportation by a Chinese company. The Chinese owner was later granted the name \"Luang Sathon Racha Yut\" (หลวงสาทรราชายุตก์) by King Chulalongkorn for his accomplishment. Both sides of the canal later became Sathon Road. Incorrect Thai spelling for Sathon สาธร had been used for very long time, but it was corrected in April 1999.

It has a unique junk-shaped chedi and viharn built by King Rama III. The idea behind the construction was that Chinese junk was quickly disappearing and the pagoda should show present descendants what it looked like. The temple was known as \"Wat Kok Khwai\" (วัดคอกควาย) during the Ayutthaya Kingdom and Wat Kok Krabue (วัดคอกกระบือ) during the Thonburi and early-Bangkok eras before the construction of the chedi.\n\nWat Don (วัดดอน) was built in 1797 during the King Rama I period by people who immigrated from Tavoy, Myanmar. The name \"Wat Don\" is equally well known for the Wat Don Cemetery not far away. The graveyard contains the remains of people of Chinese heritage. In the past, it was rumored to be a haunted place. Next to the cemetery is Wat Prok (วัดปรก), a Mon-styled Buddhist temple.\n\nHindu Dharma Sabha Association (สมาคมฮินดูธรรมสภา), also better known as Wat Vishnu (วัดวิษณุ) is one of Bangkok's oldest and most prominent Hindu temples apart from Sri Mahamariamman Temple in Bang Rak and Devasathan in Phra Nakhon. It is a temple in Vaishnavism established in 1920, considered as the only temple that enshrined the idol of all the major Hindu gods. Located in the same alley of Wat Prok.\n\nSaint Louis Church, or locally known as Wat Saint Louis (วัดเซนต์หลุยส์) is the only Catholic church on the side of Sathon Road.

Next to the shrine is Soi Wanglee (ซอยหวั่งหลี), a traditional community in the part of commercial district from Chinese junk to the steamboat periods. This area was originally filled with docks, various rice mills and also the location of the Chinese port to transport goods and passengers to Singapore, Hong Kong, Shantou, Hainan etc. All of which are joint ventures of Chinese-Thai businessmen during King Chulalongkorn's reign, but later they had conflicts. In the end, they were sold to the Wanglee family.

However, as a manager, he became the first to lead Hull City to the top division in their 104-year history, winning the Championship play-offs in 2008 after a 1–0 win against Bristol City at Wembley.\n\nSince 2011, Brown has appeared as a match summariser on BBC Radio 5 Live as well as the station's sport panel show \"Fighting Talk\", winning for the first time on 5 May 2012.\n\nBorn in South Shields, County Durham and educated in the North East, Brown started his career playing Sunday league football for South Shields side Red Duster in the South Shields Business Houses League, in the same team as Ray Dunbar and Bobby Davison, who went on to play for Derby County and Leeds United.\n\nAs a professional, Brown played at full back for many years with Hartlepool United, followed by a spell at Halifax Town (with fellow north-easterner Billy Ayre at both clubs and under him at the latter), In 1988, he moved to Bolton Wanderers, winning the Associate Members Cup in 1989.\n\nBrown joined Blackpool in 1994, playing under Sam Allardyce until 1996 while also being his assistant manager.\n\nBrown's first coaching role was as assistant to Sam Allardyce at Blackpool.

After taking Hull out of the relegation zone with three wins and a draw in the six matches as caretaker manager, he was appointed as the permanent manager of the club on 4 January 2007.\n\nBrown went on to lead The Tigers to Championship safety and the following season Hull City won promotion to the top level of English football for the first time in the club's 104-year history, by beating Bristol City at Wembley in the Championship play-off final on 24 May 2008. Brown described this as \"\"the best day of my life, without a shadow of a doubt\"\".\n\nBrown was rewarded with a new three-year contract, which he signed on the weekend of Hull City's first ever top-flight match, a 2–1 victory over Fulham on 16 August 2008. On 28 September Brown managed Hull to a 2–1 victory at Arsenal. It was only Arsenal's second-ever defeat at the Emirates Stadium and was described by the Hull press as the greatest victory in the club's history. After a 1–0 victory at bottom of the table Tottenham Hotspur the following weekend, and a 3–0 away victory at the also newly promoted West Bromwich Albion, he was awarded the Manager-of-the-Month award for Hull's performances in September.\n\nThe first nine games Hull spent as a top division club resulted in six wins as they occupied third place in the Premier League and were only being kept off the top by Liverpool and Arsenal having superior goal difference.\n\nThe remainder of the season was not so easy for Brown, as the team struggled to pick up the remaining points necessary to avoid relegation, and he was involved in several controversial incidents. In November 2008 he was fined £1,000 and warned about his future conduct by the FA after he admitted a charge of improper conduct. The charge related to a game against Wigan in August which Hull lost 5–0. On 26 December 2008, following a poor first half performance that saw Hull 4–0 down in a league match at Manchester City, Brown conducted his half-time team-talk on the pitch, in full view of the crowd and at the end of the pitch where the Hull supporters were sitting. He explained, \"I thought it was nice and cold and I thought I would keep the boys alive because they looked as if they were dead. Our 4,000 travelling fans deserved some kind of explanation for the first-half performance and it was difficult for me to do that from the confines of a changing room. We owed them an apology for the first-half performance.\" Hull lost the match 5–1 and Brown was widely mocked for the incident.\n\nBrown was again charged with misconduct for his behaviour in an FA Cup tie against Newcastle United in January. During the match Brown and Newcastle manager Joe Kinnear were both sent to the stands after a confrontation in which Brown verbally abused Newcastle's assistant manager Chris Hughton. Brown admitted the charge and was subsequently fined £2,500 and warned as to his future conduct by the Football Association.\n\nOn 17 March 2009, Brown claimed that he saw Arsenal midfielder and captain Cesc Fàbregas spit at the feet of his assistant manager Brian Horton following Hull's 2–1 FA Cup defeat and elimination at the Emirates Stadium. Fabregas was cleared of the accusation on 22 May 2009. After the game Brown also falsely claimed that Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger had refused to shake his hand at one of their two previous meetings that season. Brown faced his third improper conduct charge of the season in relation to comments he made about referee Mike Riley after the Arsenal match. He denied the offence but was found guilty in a June hearing and once again fined £2,500 and warned about his future conduct.\n\nOn 24 May 2009, despite suffering a 1–0 loss to a second-string Manchester United side, Brown led Hull City to survival in the Premier League due to Newcastle United losing to Aston Villa. Hull finished in 17th place, one point above Newcastle, who also lost. Brown stated that this was the greatest achievement in his managerial career and the club's history. At the end of the game, Brown went onto the pitch with a microphone and started singing (a modified version of) \"Sloop John B\" to the crowd.\n\nIn the summer of 2009, Brown looked to strengthen his side. He attempted to sign former England international striker Michael Owen and former Tiger Fraizer Campbell, but was unsuccessful. Brown did manage to sign Seyi Olofinjana, Jozy Altidore (on loan from Villarreal), Kamel Ghilas, Stephen Hunt, Paul McShane, and he also signed Ibrahima Sonko on transfer deadline day on loan from Stoke City – after the departure of Michael Turner to Sunderland. Steven Mouyokolo also joined after he was initially purchased on 30 January 2009. Free agent Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink signed for the Tigers on 3 September 2009.\n\nBrown's position as Hull manager was thought to be under threat in November 2009 following a poor start to the season, however a run of eight points from four games dampened such speculation. The team's disciplinary problems also continued, with a £40,000 fine levied following a fracas in a 3–0 defeat at Arsenal and Hull also occupying last place in the Fair Play League. On 15 March 2010 Brown was put on gardening leave at Hull after a run of four defeats left the team in the relegation zone. Hull achieved one win in the last fifteen games under Brown, and a total of five in the 2009–10 league season. His final match was a home defeat to Arsenal. His contract as manager was confirmed ended on 7 June 2010, by which time the Tigers had been relegated under new manager Iain Dowie.\n\nOn 6 January 2011, it was announced that Brown would become the new manager of Preston North End, replacing the sacked Darren Ferguson. In his first season at Preston, he was unable to save the club from relegation. He stated that \"I nearly broke down in front of the supporters. I hold myself responsible for relegation, end of story\" however \"Next season we will hit the ground running – one thing is for sure, we'll be able to run\".\n\nBrown oversaw a loss in the first game of the 2011–12 season, a 4–2 loss to Colchester, but after this the club went on a winning streak, with strikers Iain Hume, Neil Mellor and Jamie Proctor in top form. However, all 3 strikers got injured, and the club fell from 2nd in the league to 10th. This led to a club announcement on 14 December 2011, informing the fans that Brown and assistant Brian Horton had left the club with immediate effect, after a run of bad results.\n\nOn 25 March 2013, it was announced that Brown would succeed Paul Sturrock as manager of Southend United, 24 hours after Sturrock's dismissal. Having reached the 2013 Football League Trophy Final under Sturrock, Southend lost 2–0 at Wembley on 7 April 2013 under Brown.\n\nIn the next two seasons, Brown led Southend United to consecutive play-off competitions, eventually seeing the club promoted to League One in May 2015.\n\nOn 17 January 2018, Brown was placed on gardening leave by Southend effectively ending his nearly five-year reign at the club.\n\nOn 12 March 2018, following his spell at Southend, Brown was appointed the manager of League Two side Swindon Town until the end of the 2017–18 campaign. Although Swindon failed to qualify for the League Two playoffs, Brown signed a new two-year deal in May 2018. Brown was sacked in November 2018, with the club lying 17th in the table.\n\nIn December 2018, Brown was appointed as head coach of Indian Super League side Pune City, which soon became Hyderabad FC.\n\nAfter just 1 win in 12 matches in the 2019–20 season, he parted ways with the club in January 2020.\n\nBolton Wanderers\n\nHull City\n\nSouthend United\n\nIndividual\n\nBrown is married to Karen, his third wife, and they have two children, Jamie (born 1985) and Sophie (born 2001).\n\nBrown is a trained electrician, and put his trade to use by carrying out electrical work at Southend's training ground.\n\n"}

Sviatoshyn neighborhood borders the (\"Borshchahivka River\") in the west, that flows through there and falls into the Irpin River of the Dnieper basin. There is the beginning on the opposite side of the Nyvka River.\n\nThe east boundary of the suburb is the Kiev - Kovel railway. There are , and neighbourhoods in the north of Sviatoshyn and Borshchahivka neighbourhood, terrain, village and Petropavlivska Borshchahivka village in the south.\n\nAll Sviatoshyn's adjacent neighbourhoods and suburbs belong to the Sviatoshyn Raion as well, except Petropavlivska Borshchahivka village. That village is in the Kiev-Sviatoshyn Raion (municipality) of the Kiev Oblast (region).\n\nBy roads, the suburb is located:\n\nThe core Sviatoshyn road Peremohy Avenue is a part of European route E40, which is the main highway from Kiev to the most European countries. There is going through the suburb from north to south. It includes and there.\n\nThere are two hypotheses of the name of Sviatoshyn existing.\n\nThe first one comes from a version that there was a \"Saint Grove (Sviatyi, Святий гай)\" in there. That was a sacred place for pagans.\n\nThe second version says that the name is derived from the nickname of the Prince of Chernigov , who lived in the 12th century. His original name was Sviatoslav and he was a son of Davyd Sviatoslavich and a grandson of the Grand Prince of Kiev Sviatoslav II. It is alleged that he owned a land at neighbouring Borshchahivka village. In 1106 the prince Sviatoslav donated all his property to the Kiev Pechersk Monastery and became a monk of it. He took the monk Christian name Nikola (Nikolai, ). Since he had the born name Sviatoslav and was very devout he was given the informal nickname Sviatosha. Sviatosha means a pious, godly religious person.\n\nIn itself the Ukrainian word \"\"Sviatoshyn\"\" means \"\"Sviatosha's\"\", that is, something that belongs to Sviatosha.\n\nIn contrast to English speaking countries, the names of a city's suburbs in Ukraine, that belong to city councils areas, do not have so strict spelling rules, because their name do not play any significant roles in an official city's division to local municipalities (raions) or in the postal system.\n\nThe ethnographer in his work \"\" in 1884 mentioned this place as \"a woodland called Sviatoshyn\". There is a document \"The report of the Committee to facilitate accomplishment of the villa area in the locality Sviatoshyn of the Kiev province and district. Kiev, 1903\" existing. At the beginning of the 20th century the dacha village was called Sviatoshyn (Святошинъ - in the ).\n\nIn the Soviet era there was a trend to change names of settlements, especially small ones, by putting the suffix \"\"-o\"\". So that since the 1930s on all maps of Kiev, both Russian and Ukrainian languages, the suburb was marked as Sviatoshyno (Святошино). Settlement names with the suffix \"\"-o\"\" are more typical of Russian language than Ukrainian, so sometimes the name Sviatoshyne (Святошине) was used in Ukrainian spelling. Despite of that there is Sviatoshyn (Святошин) article included in that was published by the Ukrainian Soviet Encyclopedia editorial office.\n\nSince the station of the Kiev Metro, which is the suburb's landmark, was renamed Sviatoshyn (Святошин) station, this variant of suburb spelling has been started broadly used. Ukrainian linguists insist on using Sviatoshyn (Святошин) as the locality name. In spite of this, sometimes the name Sviatoshyno (Святошино) has still been used, even in official documents of the Kiev City Council.\n\nBefore the Kievan Rus epoch it was a territory of Eastern Polans and approximately 10 kilometres to the west, on the left bank of the Irpin River Drevlians' land began.\n\nAt the time of Kievan Rus and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania the land belonged to the Principality of Kiev.\n\nIt is alleged that in the 12th century the owner of this land was the Prince of Chernigov (Sviatoslav), who donated it to the Kiev Pechersk Monastery. Until the beginning of the 17th century this area belonged to Kiev monasteries.\n\nThe first mention of the area name \"Sviatoshyn\" was in 1619, when this land was a part of the Kiev Voivodeship of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth after the Union of Lublin. At that time the king Sigismund III Vasa determined the metes and bounds of Kiev's burgesses land possession in his charter. In particular it was said that Kiev's citizens boundary went \"through an oak grove to Sviatoshyn side\".\n\nAt the time of the Cossack Hetmanate, the present Sviatoshyn territory belonged to the .\n\nIn the 1780s, at the time when this land was included into the Kiev Viceroyalty of the Russian Empire, the Magdeburg rights of Kiev were revoked so Sviatoshyn area went to the state ownership.\n\nUntil the end of the 19th century, that land had been mentioned like Sviatoshyn wood, grove or forest, and it was a part of the volost of the Kiev Governorate. There were no allusions about any permanent human settlements in there at that time.\n\nIn 1897 the Sviatoshyn land, which had been occupied by a pine grove, was divided into 450 lots and leased for 99 years. Thus а dacha village (summer colony) was set up there.\n\nA grid plan was implemented in the village. That area master plan is typical of dacha summer settlements. The core road of Sviatoshyn was Brest-Litovsky highway, now , that went from east to west dividing the village into two unequal parts.\n\nThe villa projects were created by the Kiev architects and . A lot of powerful, influential and rich people had villas there. In particular, villa owners were Kiev University professors, three Kiev mayors, businessmen including members of the \"sugar magnate\" Tereshchenko family.\nThe popularity of the villa area was growing up because of a pine grove, a pond and a good transport infrastructure. Simultaneously with developing the land area, in 1898 a narrow-gauge railway was laid from Kiev and it was used as a horsecar tram line then steam tram-cars operated there. In 1901 the village was connected to an electricity network so on the 1st of May that year electric trams were launched. In 1902 Kiev - Kovel railway, which goes along the east edge of Sviatoshyn village, was finished up building and was opened.\n\nIn 1911 one of the oldest Kiev's cinemas (\"screen\") was opened at the corner of Brest-Litovsky Highway and the 3rd Prosika.\n\nBetween the village and suburb was Sviatoshyn Airfield where the pilot Pyotr Nesterov introduced his famous aerobatics flights.\n\nIn 1919 the village was included into the Kiev City Council area.\n\nAs a result of the Ukrainian–Soviet War (1917–1921) and the Polish–Soviet War (1919–1921) Kiev City and its suburbs was finally captured by the Red Army. In 1921 Bolsheviks conducted the administrative subdivision reform, so Kiev was divided into 5 raions (districts) and Sviatoshyn was included into the City Council area permanently.\n\nThe Bolshevik government was conducting the nationalisation policy so that many dacha villas were expropriated. The best villas were transferred to state and trade unions sanatoriums, boarding schools and Young Pioneer camps. Some other villas and cottages were converted to communal apartments. In practice it means that a house owner family was left just one bedroom, a rest of bedrooms were given to other families, which usually originated from the working class. A kitchen room and a bathroom were used by all families together, that lived in a house.\n\nIn the 1930s Sviatoshyn's St. Nicholas Eastern Orthodox church was demolished by Bolsheviks. However, on the south-west edge of Sviatoshyn the Roman Catholic parish of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross was existing during the whole time of the Communist rule. It was only one the refuge for Roman Catholics in all Kiev region.\n\nIn 1941 during the Second World War, the general staff of the Kiev Fortified Region was situated in place of present Kiev secondary school No. 140. and next to it, the operational team of the command post of the Southwestern Front was located at the modern address 80 Verkhovynna Street. In 1944-1945 the training centre of Soviet partisans (guerrillas) located in the house at 10 the 2nd Prosika. There are a complex of monuments at Soviet soldiers' graves who killed in battle of Kiev in 1943 at the .\n\nAt the end of the 1940s Sviatoshyn Airfield was passed to ownership of an aircraft serial production plant that since 1952 has been headquarters of Antonov state company. In 1988 the company produced the largest ever aircraft Antonov An-225 Mriya. Together with the aircraft factory development the new village began being built next to the north-east edge of Sviatoshyn. The name Aviamistechko (, ) means \"aviation town\". Sometimes this locality has been called \"Novosviatoshyn\" (\"New Sviatoshyn\") as well.\n\nIn 1947 the clothing factory \"Kashtan\" was launched; it was one of the biggest producer of men's shirts in the USSR.\n\nLate in the 1950s the new housing estate was started building on the land of the former vegetable farm \"Sviatoshyn\", that had been located north of the neighbourhood. Besides residential buildings there have been numerous research institutes of Ukrainian Academy of Sciences situated in there. Therefore, the suburb got the name Akademmistechko (, ), which means \"academic town\".\n\nIn 1971 Sviatoshyn(o) station of the Kiev Metro was opened on the east edge of neighbourhood, next to the same name railway station.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1970s a new housing estate of tower blocks was begun erecting in the north-west part of Sviatoshyn and south-east part of suburbs, for that all existing former dacha houses had been demolished in there. In 1979–1980 the Ukrainian poet and Soviet political prisoner Vasyl Stus was living in apartment building at 13-a in that housing estate.\n\nIn 1982 due to increasing number of traffic lanes of Brest-Litovsky Highway, Sviatoshyn tram line was dismantled. Instead of trams, trolleybuses were launched to the neighbourhood.\n\nThe is located in a landscape park at the intersection of and . The memorial is devoted to people who were killed, injured and suffered because of the Chernobyl disaster in 1986.\n\nThe monument to victims of that tragedy was erected at the initiative of the \"Chernobyl Disabled Union\" on 26 April 1994, with funds of the local budget and private donations. Authors of the monument are the sculptor and architect .\n\nIn 2001 the St church and in 2002 the bell tower museum were built at the monument.\n\nIn 2011 the memorial avenue \"Heroes of Chernobyl\" was created at the initiative of \"Chernobyl Fire-fighters\" NGO. There were erected seven busts of firemen, heroes of Ukraine and the Soviet Union and installed eight memorial plates in memory of died Chernobyl disaster liquidators.\n\n is located at the corner and . It is named after the poet and political prisoner Vasyl Stus, who was one of the most significant members of the Ukrainian cultural movement of the sixtiers. He was living near this place at 62 , since his marriage in 1965 to the first arrest in 1972. The house was demolished in 1979 due to building the road interchange there.\n\nIn 2006 at the initiative of the Ukrainian People's Party and NGO, a local community meeting was conducted, it was decided to establish Vasyl Stus garden square. The initiative coordinator was Viktor Tkachenko. In March 2007 the Kyiv City Council supported this initiative and local volunteers including students of schools 140 and 200, clean up the plot on Earth Day. However, in 2008 the Kiev City State Administration gave a building permit for shopping centre construction here. Thus the building developer cut down more than 100 trees including oaks older than 120 years and pines older than 150 years. The litigations began between parties.\n\nFinally in 2010 the Kyiv City Council assigned \"Vasyl Stus\" name to this plot but in fact the garden square was opened on Kiev Day of 2015 by the mayor of Kiev Vitali Klitschko. There were Vasyl Stus's widow and his sister, who was a refugee from the Donetsk Oblast because of the war in Donbass, granddaughter, friends-sixtiers, public activists and local community residents present in the ceremonial unveiling of the garden square.\n\n is a point which all electric multiple unit trains go through from Kiev towards the North-West direction. Some passenger trains that run to Western Ukraine stop at Sviatoshyn station.\n\nThere is the bus station \"Dachna\" located at 142a Peremohy Avenue. Buses to European countries and Western Ukraine set off from here.\n\nThe Sviatoshynsko-Brovarska Line of the Kiev Metro is laid underground in the neighbourhood. Zhytomyrska Metro station, opened on 24 May 2003, is situated in the centre of Sviatoshyn. Sviatoshyn station, built in 1971, is on the eastern edge of the suburb. Akademmistechko station, opened in 2003, is located at the border Bilychi and Akademmistechko neighbourhoods near the north side of Sviatoshyn.\n\nThe suburb is connected to other neighbourhoods by Kiev's municipal and .\n\nThere is an airfield Sviatoshyn Airfield where is located Antonov Serial Production Plant, formerly Aviant.\n\n"}

The Act for a line from just south of Stockport to Ambergate was passed in 1846.\n\nCurrently, the section north of Millers Dale is open as the Great Rocks freight line, Derby to Matlock still holds passenger services as the Derwent Valley line, Matlock to Rowsley is the Peak Rail heritage line, and Rowsley to Buxton has become the Monsal Trail for cycling, horse riding and walking.\n\nThe initial plan was for \"\"An Act for making a Railway from the Manchester and Birmingham Railway at Cheadle in the County of Chester to or near to the Ambergate Station of the Midlands Railway in the County of Derby, to be called \"The Manchester, Buxton, Matlock, and Midlands Junction Railway\"\" The Bill received Parliamentary Assent in 1846.\n\nThe line opened as far as Rowsley in 1849, but went no further, having run out of money giving its promoters something of a problem.\n\nMatlock Bath had long been a tourist town. Since the station at Ambergate had been opened, tourists had been brought in by coach and canal. Around thirty coaches had passed that way each day, with sixty or seventy thousand visitors going on to Chatsworth House. The aim then was to develop the trade further.\n\nThe Midland Railway had held shares in the line since it had been first proposed in 1845, its interest being an extension onto its route to London. The Manchester and Birmingham had for some time been looking for a route of its own, and had considered a line through the Churnet Valley (later built by the North Staffordshire Railway), but had instead supported the alternative Matlock route with a substantial shareholding. However, in 1846 it had merged with other lines to become the LNWR, which clearly could not contemplate a competing London line. In 1852 the two companies agreed to lease the line jointly for 19 years, In addition, the Midland would work the line and pay a rent on it, and also take over the Cromford Canal.\n\nIn 1853, a junction was made to the southern end of the Cromford and High Peak Railway now LNWR-owned, at High Peak Junction, and with the latter's support, the Stockport, Disley and Whaley Bridge Railway connected Manchester to the northern end. In 1857, with the LNWR's barely concealed support, the SD&WBR then gained permission to extend to Buxton. It did so by a roundabout route along a massive escarpment to the east of the Goyt Valley, such that it could never become a through express route. Despite an LNWR petition against the Bill and opposition from the SD&WBR, the Midland Railway (Rowsley & Buxton) Act of 25 May 1860 authorised a line from Rowsley to meet the SD&WBR at Buxton. Work started in September 1860, under Frederic Campion, the Midland Railway's Southern Division engineer, then under Alfred Andrew Langley (from 1883 Midland's Chief Engineer).\n\nIt was the first time the Midland had built in such difficult terrain, with steep hills and deep valleys, Buxton itself being some above sea level. The line followed the River Wye as far as Bakewell, with the complication of the cut and cover Haddon Tunnel, and reached Hassop in 1862 There then followed two viaducts - at Millers Dale and Monsal Dale - and eight tunnels, reaching Buxton in 1863 at almost the same time as the LNWR reached it from Whaley Bridge. In 1884 John Ruskin complained of the effect on the dales, saying, \"your railway drags its close clinging damnation\".\n\nAll this time passengers were having to change at Ambergate, but in the same year, the Midland added a south-facing junction and moved the station to allow through travel from Derby and the south. However, there was still the problem of the joint control of the line.\n\nFor many years, the town of Wirksworth had been campaigning for a branch line from Duffield. The CH&PR was interested, but had insufficient funds. The Midland was initially unenthusiastic, but then realised that the branch could be extended to Rowsley, avoiding the section to Ambergate, being unsure about what might occur when joint lease expired in 1871.\n\nHowever, the LNWR gave up its share of the line when the lease expired. It was, after all, remote and isolated from the company's main system. The Midland was therefore relieved of the necessity of extending from Wirksworth over a very difficult piece of terrain. The branch opened to Wirksworth in 1867 but was not carried further.\n\nIn the shifting alliances and rivalries between the various companies, the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway also wished to keep the Midland away from the coalmines which it served and, in 1859, was planning a line from Hyde just outside Manchester to New Mills and Hayfield. The company was also being courted by the GNR that planned to run London trains through Retford. Meanwhile, the MS&LR's manager Edward Watkin had his own plans to reach London through Sheffield.\nIt seemed the Midland's only chance was a circuitous route with the help of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, except that it transpired that latter had an agreement with the LNWR not to handle other companies' trains. In 1861, the Midland sent their manager James Allport and some of the directors on a scouting trip around the area, and came by chance upon a party of MS&LR directors riding in a dog cart. The upshot was that Allport who had previously worked for the latter company should arrange a deal. Since it was clear that the Midland was determined to go ahead, it would be better not to have two lines running side by side.\n\nOn 7 November 1861 it was formally agreed therefore that the Midland would join the MS&LR partner's Marple, New Mills and Hayfield Junction line at New Mills, an agreement which was put into statutes, later including the Sheffield and Midland Railway Companies' Committee in the \"Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway Act\" of 6 August 1872.\n\nTo do this, it built a junction at Millers Dale, which effectively left Buxton on a branch. Thus railway politics deprived what was (particularly at that time) the largest town in the Peak District of a through main-line station. The Midland's line proceeded to the east of, but parallel to, the LNWR's line until it reached a summit at Peak Forest. It then plunged under the LNWR through Dove Holes Tunnel with stations at Chapel-en-le-Frith, and joining the MS&LR at New Mills to run into Manchester London Road, opening in 1867. This section of route is still open for stone freight trains serving the Buxton lime industry as the Great Rocks Line.\n\nThe Midland at last had its route into Manchester from London. Over the years it made some improvements. The route from Romiley through Hyde entailed a long detour, so in 1875 a new more direct line was opened through Reddish.\n\nIn 1865 the Midland had become a partner of the Cheshire Lines Committee which opened Manchester Central railway station in 1880. Therefore, the Midland transferred most of its trains there, at first reaching it through Stockport Tiviot Dale. However the route became increasingly congested and was hardly suitable as an express route, so in 1897, the Midland opened a new line from New Mills through Disley Tunnel and Heaton Mersey.\nThe line from Matlock to Buxton was closed in June 1968 by the Labour Minister for Transport, Barbara Castle, not as it is often thought by the Beeching reforms. Continuing support is being given by a heritage group Peak Rail who have restored the section from Matlock to Rowsley. \n\nThe line from Matlock to Ambergate, plus the section of the Midland Main Line to Derby, are now referred to as the Derwent Valley Line. Meanwhile, the Wirksworth branch still exists and is now painstakingly restored as the Ecclesbourne Valley Railway.\n\nAlthough the track has been lifted between Rowsley and Buxton and is now part of the Monsal Trail, plans to re-open it are still proposed from time to time, and the Derbyshire County Council has pledged to keep the trackbed free of development.\n\nPart of the line has been re-opened by the heritage railway organisation Peak Rail who run services from Matlock to Rowsley, at a current distance of in length.\n\nThere are plans to extend to Bakewell via the site of Rowsley railway station and a Proposed Haddon halt as part of the Buxton extension project. It will involve reinstating the whole section and Bakewell railway station to their former use once planning permission has been granted, plus full restoration of the old Haddon Tunnel and both Coombs Road and Rowsley Viaducts (along the way between both Bakewell and Rowsley themselves).\n\nFour tunnels (Headstone, Cressbrook, Litton and Chee Tor) between Great Longstone and Peak Forest and Blackwell Mill were re-opened to walkers and cyclists in May 2011.\n\nIn March 2018, it was announced that a consortium of quarry companies and the heritage railway Peak Rail is investigating reopening the line between Matlock and Buxton.\n\nThis line has been identified by Campaign for a Better Transport as a priority 1 candidate for reopening.\n\n\n"}

An extrasolar planet (designated HD 149026 b, later named Smertrios) is believed to orbit the star.\n\nHD 149026 in the star's identifier in the Henry Draper Catalog. Following its discovery in 2005 the planet was designated HD 149026 b.\n\nIn July 2014 the International Astronomical Union launched a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars. The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names. In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning names were Ogma for this star and Smertrios for its planet.\n\nThe winning names based on those submitted by the Club d'Astronomie de Toussaint of France; namely 'Ogmios' and 'Smertrios'. Ogmios was a Gallo-Roman deity and Smertrios was a Gallic deity of war. The IAU substituted the name of Ogma, a deity of eloquence, writing, and great physical strength in the Celtic mythologies of Ireland and Scotland, and who may be related to Ogmios, because 'Ogmios' is the name of an asteroid .\n\nIn 2016, the IAU organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. In its first bulletin of July 2016, the WGSN explicitly recognized the names of exoplanets and their host stars approved by the Executive Committee Working Group Public Naming of Planets and Planetary Satellites, including the names of stars adopted during the 2015 NameExoWorlds campaign. This star is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.\n\nThe star is thought to be much more massive, larger, and brighter than the Sun. The higher mass means that despite its considerably younger age (2.0 Ga) it is already much more evolved than the Sun. The internal fusion of hydrogen in the core of the star is coming to an end, and it is beginning to evolve towards red gianthood. At a distance of 250 light-years, the star is not visible to the unaided eye. However, it should be easily seen in binoculars or a small telescope.\n\nThe star is over twice as enriched with chemical elements heavier than hydrogen and helium as the Sun. Because of this and the fact that the star is relatively bright, a group of astronomers in N2K Consortium began to study the star. The star's anomalous composition as measured may be surface pollution only, from the intake of heavy-element planetesimals.\n\nIn 2005 an unusual extrasolar planet was discovered to be orbiting the star. Designated HD 149026 b, it was detected transiting the star allowing its diameter to be measured. It was found to be smaller than other known transiting planets, meaning it is unusually dense for a closely orbiting giant planet. The temperature of the giant planet is calculated to be , generating so much infrared heat that it glows. Scientists believe the planet absorbs nearly all the sunlight and radiates it into space as heat.\n\n\n"}

In 1106, the second Icelandic diocese, Hólar, was created in the north of Iceland, and Jón was appointed its first bishop. He served as bishop there until his death.\n\nA religious purist, Jón made it his mission to uproot all remnants of paganism. This included changing the names of the days of the week. Thus \"Óðinsdagr\", \"day of Odin\", became \"miðvikudagr\", \"mid-week day\" and the days of Týr and Thor became the prosaic \"third day\" and \"fifth day\".\n\nJón's names for the days are still in use in Iceland today but despite the success of this cosmetic reform it appears that Jón did not manage to uproot the memory of the heathen gods. More than a century after his death the Prose Edda and Poetic Edda were written, preserving large amounts of pagan myth and poetry.\n\nJón’s relic was translated to the cathedral of Hólar on 3 March 1200, a process called \"translation\" which made him a local saint. His feast day, 23 April (the date of his death) was decreed a Holy Day of Obligation for all Iceland at the Althing in the summer of 1200. These two events are distinguished in the Icelandic annals: Jón was not 'made a saint' by the Althing.\n\nJón never received as much veneration as the first Icelandic saint, Thorlak Thorhallsson. He was venerated primarily in the diocese of Hólar, and also at his birthplace, Breiðabólstaður in Fljótshlíð; relics were preserved at both these places.\n\nA Latin life (vita) about St. Jón was probably written by the monk Gunnlaugr Leifsson of the monastery at Þingeyrar in the early thirteenth century. Composed nearly a century after Jón’s lifetime, its historical value is dubious. It is a classic example of hagiography for a confessor saint, aiming to praise the saintly virtues of its subject rather than record accurate historical information. The Latin original has not survived, but was it translated into Icelandic shortly after its composition and revised on subsequent occasions. The Icelandic texts have been published in:\nA partial translation has been published as: \"Saga of Bishop Jón of Hólar\", in \"Medieval Hagiography: An Anthology\", ed.

A part of Neringa municipality, Juodkrantė is the second largest settlement on Lithuania's part of the spit. Situated in Old Prussian territory it was for centuries a fishing village named Schwarzort, which underwent a tourist boom in the late 19th - early 20th century. After World War I this northern part of East Prussia was severed from Germany and the village became known as Juodkrantė.\n\nJuodkrantė was first mentioned (as \"Schwarzort\") by the Teutonic Knights in 1429 in a letter describing storm damages. It was initially situated along the Baltic Sea shore, about 2.5 km from the present location. In the early 17th century, due to the Black Death, and moving sand dunes threatening to bury the village, it lost almost all of its inhabitants. In the 1680s, the village relocated to its present location along the Curonian Lagoon shore. After 1724, the sources do not mention the village along the Baltic Sea shore any more. The village did quite well in the new location: a tavern was opened in 1673, a school in 1743, and a wooden church in 1795. Until 1740 the village belonged to (Klaipėda County), then from 1740-1795 to Church District (Karvaičiai). It grew in importance after Carwaiten/Karvaičiai/Karwaiten village was swallowed by traveling sand and the seat of the Church District relocated here. The wooden church burned down in 1878 but was soon replaced by a red brick Lutheran church in 1885.\nMajor developments took place in 1860s. In the late 1850s the lagoon waterway was deepened and now ferries could arrive. It was the easiest way to travel. In the course of the work, samples of amber were found. In 1860 the Stantien & Becker company was founded to dig amber just north of the village. During 30 years of operations, it dug out about 2,250 tonnes of amber. At its peak the company employed about 1,000 workers. The company had a positive effect on KAKALAS out was used to reinforce the shore and swampy areas. After the company relocated to Palmnicken (now Yantarny) in 1890, the population of Schwarzort dropped from 851 in 1885 to 423 in 1895.\n\nThe tourist business was started in 1860s by Edward Stellmacher, who turned an old tavern house into a hotel named \"Kurischer Hof\" (Lithuanian: \"Kuršių kiemas\", now \"Gintaras\"). Because of the amber business, a new Juodkrantė was developed north of the old fishermen village. Many villas and hotels were built there. In the beginning of the 20th century there were 5 hotels, 20 villas, and a convalescent home \"Luisenbad\" (Lithuanian: \"Luizės maudykla\"). The new town was considered a luxury resort and attracted about 3,000 visitors a year. World War II destroyed the tourist business. Neringa was a strictly regulated border region. Only in the early 1960s tourists started to come back. However, Nida became a more popular destination for tourists. This allowed Juodkrantė to retain its old business - fishing. Sometimes it is referred to as the \"capital of fishermen\" and holds annual fishermen festival in July.\n\nStantien & Becker would dig up many pieces of amber shaped as amulets or knick-knacks. At first they would give them out as souvenirs, but then started collecting these items from the Mid Neolithic and the Bronze Ages. Richard Klebs, professor at Königsberg University, described 435 items (pendants, buttons, tubular beads, discs, and figurines of humans and animals) in his book \"Stone Age Amber Adornments\" in 1882. These ancient \"Schwarzorter Funde\" are considered to contain the earliest known amber carving finds from the Baltic Sea area (with amber carvings thousands of years older in other locations). About 150 items have detailed images. The collection was exhibited in Berlin, St. Petersburg, London, Chicago. After Klebs' death, Königsberg University purchased his collection. However, during the turbulent times of World War II and the expulsions from East Prussia most of the large collection in Königsberg was destroyed or stolen and only a few items were saved at Göttingen University, previously the sister university of Königsberg. But scientists were able to make replicas from detailed illustrations in Klebs' book.\n\nMost of genealogical information was recorded in Church books \"Kirchenbücher\" when the wooden church was built in 1795. Records are stored in Evangelisches Zentralarchiv Berlin and Bundesarchiv. Some families moved to Juodkrantė from Karwaiten (Karvaičiai) when sand buried this site completely in 1797.\n\nA large collection of wooden sculptures by various artists is displayed on the Hill of Witches (). The sculpture park was started in 1979 and now has more than 70 wooden objects. Most of the figures are based on Lithuanian legends or folk tales. Before the surrounding area was planted with trees, visitors could admire a view of the sea and the lagoon.\n\nAnother sculpture park was finished in 2002. It houses 31 stone and metal sculptures created during an international symposium \"Land and Water.\" The sculptures are located on the recently built quay, 2.4 km in length, along the lagoon shore.\n\nA Weathervane gallery (\"Vėtrungių galerija\") is maintained by Daiva and Remigijus Žadeikiai. The gallery has information on the Nerija cultural heritage. There is also a gallery maintained by the Lithuanian National Art Museum.\n\nOf interest to nature watchers are the large great cormorant (2000 pairs) and grey heron (500 pairs) colonies west of Juodkrantė.\nIt is believed that the herons have nested near Juodkrantė since 17th century, but the cormorants arrived only at the beginning of 19th century. The cormorants were exterminated at the end of the 19th century due to Prussian administration regulations and started to reappear only in the 1970s. The large cormorant colony has damaged the old and fragile forest because the birds' excrement burns tree roots. During last 15 years about 10 ha (25 acres) of forest has died. Fishermen blame the birds for diminishing fish catches, but unlike in Prussia, the regulations now do not allow killing them as both grey heron and great cormorant are protected species in Lithuania.\n\n\nKitesurfing/Windsurfing\n\nJuodkrantė is one of the best kitesurfing / windsurfing spot and kite flying beaches in Lithuania.\nIt is open to all wind directions. The Curonian lagoon side is also great for snowkiteboarding.\n\nSailing\n\nJuodkrantė is on inland waterway from Nida to Klaipėda. There are two piers in Juodkrantė for yachts and boats. A yacht club is under development. Navigation - Juodkrantė Lighthouse (20m) int.no 0049 (C3334) - White rectangle on black square metal framework tower with viewing platform. From sea visible only top part.\n\nParagliding\n\nJuodkrantė is a place of choice for eastern winds. Paragliding sand dune site is south-east from town.

Enterprise, a multi-concept restaurant company that operated or franchised a total of 363 restaurants under three brands: O'Charley's, Ninety Nine Restaurant, and Stoney River Legendary Steaks. In 2012, O'Charley's, Inc. Enterprise was acquired by Fidelity National Financial and became part of American Blue Ribbon Holdings.\n\nCharles (Sonny) Watkins founded O'Charley's restaurant in 1971 on 21st Avenue South in Nashville, across the street from Vanderbilt University. Watkins ran O'Charley's from 1971 to 1984 when he sold the restaurant to David K. Wachtel. David K. Wachtel spent 23 years working for Shoney's where he eventually became president and chief executive officer of the restaurant company. Wachtel resigned from Shoney's in 1982. Wachtel intended to develop the O'Charley's restaurant into a restaurant chain. In mid-1987, the 12th O'Charley's opened in Lexington, Kentucky, occupying a site formerly used by the Bennigan's chain of restaurants. While the Lexington grand opening was under way, Wachtel was working on plans to convert two more Bennigan's units in Huntsville, Alabama and Nashville, Tennessee into O'Charley's. \n\nIn December 1993, Burns and McWhorter announced the formulation of a growth strategy designed to carry the 45-unit chain into the ranks of the country's largest regional dinner-house chains. In 1994, the company planned to open at least eight new O'Charley's restaurants, situating the new units primarily in southeastern markets such as Cookeville, Tennessee; Louisville and Paducah, Kentucky; and Palm Harbor, Florida. There was an expectation of restaurants opening for the year, but as time continued past 1994 other issues hindered this expansion. In February 1994, Wachtel resigned as chairman of O'Charley's, citing his \"pressing commitments\" with other business interests, the most notable of which was the 300-unit Western Sizzlin' budget steakhouse chain he had acquired in 1993. Burns was named chief executive and co-chairman and McWhorter was tapped as president and co-chairman. One month after Wachtel's resignation, the company was advised that four former O'Charley's employees had filed a federal lawsuit charging the restaurant chain with racial discrimination practices against African Americans in the company's hiring, assignment, and promotion procedures. Burns denied the charges \n\nIn 2007, O'Charley's closed its Nashville commissary and distribution center, and began using Performance Food Group to distribute product to all of its locations. In 2013, O'Charley's launched \"Free Pie Wednesday.\" Any dine-in customer ordering an entree on Wednesdays will receive a free slice of pie. In 2014 O'Charley's selected BOHAN Advertising as a marketing partner.\n\nIn April 2019, O'Charley's closed a single location in Florida. Three months later, O'Charley's abruptly closed eight locations in Indiana and Georgia in June 2019.

Imotski, like the surrounding inland Dalmatia, has a generally mild Mediterranean climate which makes it a popular tourist destination.\n\nThe town is located close to the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina, 10 km away from Posušje and 18 km from Grude. It is located 29 km away from the coast (Baška Voda). The nearest coastal town is Makarska, on the other side of the Biokovo massif.\n\nThe town is located on the crossroad of D60 and D76 state roads and 20 km from the Sveti Ilija Tunnel. The A1 motorway is accessed at the Zagvozd Interchange, next to the D76 expressway.\n\nImotski is known for its medieval fortress on the rocks of Blue Lake. Another phenomenon is the Red Lake which looks like an eye in the scenery. Both lakes are said to be connected with underground channels to the Adriatic Sea.\n\nThe region around Imotski has been populated in the Neolithic age. At the time of Illyrians and Romans it was known as \"Emotha\" and later \"Imota\". It was first mentioned by today's name by Byzantine Emperor Constantin Porphyrogennetos in the 10th century. In medieval historical sources it was mentioned as important fortress. The fortress above the town, Topana, was first mentioned in the 9th century, in the times of Croatian sovereigns. \n\nImotski was held by the Turks from the fall of Bosnia in 1492 until 1717 when it was captured by the Venetians. In April 1717, a small church, dedicated to the Lady of Angels, was built in honour of the victory against the Ottomans. The Lady of Angels has since then been honored as patroness of Imotski and Imotski region.\n\nThe Hasanaginica folk ballad was created in the Imotski region in mid 17th century.\n\nIn 1912, a secondary school was built in Imotski when the town was part of the Kingdom of Dalmatia within the Austro-Hungarian Empire.\n\nFrom 1941 to 1945 Imotski was part of the Independent State of Croatia. In April 1944, German forces shot down three American B-24s. The local population saved many of the American personnel despite being bombed by them. One airman/paratrooper, Marion Dropulich (Marijan Dropuljić) who crashed near Imotski, but survived and was taken by Italian Soldiers happened to have been a Croatian American with immediate Imotski ancestry.\n\nThe climate is modified Mediterranean, with the highest air temperature averaging during July and the lowest averaging , in January. Summers are usually very hot during the day, temperature goes up to 40°C.\n\nTemperatures above last for more than 250 days a year.\n\nTwo kinds of wind are common in the area - the northern to north-eastern bora, which usually brings cold and clear weather in winter, and the southern to south-eastern sirocco, which often brings rain.\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, the town proper has a population of 4,757, while the whole municipality has a population of 10,764. The absolute majority are Croats with 96.78% of the population.\n\nThe Town of Imotski administratively consists of following settlements:\n\n\nŽarko Domljan, the first Speaker of the Croatian Parliament, was born in Imotski. The famous poet Tin Ujević spent part of his childhood in Imotski. Politician, poet and Croatian dissident Vlado Gotovac was born and spent his early years in Imotski. The town itself is home to Croatian league football club NK Imotski.\n\nThere are other individuals born in Imotski to have made their names known outside of the local region. In the world of entertainment, there is the singer Neda Ukraden and film director Antun Vrdoljak. Sports stars include female tennis player Silvija Talaja and footballers Zvonimir Boban, Ante Rebić, Tomislav Bušić and Ivan Gudelj. The father of former Canada national men's ice hockey team captain Joe Sakic, Marijan Šakić, is from Imotski. The famous boxer Mate Parlov was born near Imotski in the village of Ričice, and a Croatian emigrant notorious for aircraft hijacking Zvonko Bušić is also from Imotski.

Mobile phones are often referred to as feature phones, and offer basic telephony. Handsets with more advanced computing ability through the use of native code try to differentiate their own products by implementing additional functions to make them more attractive to consumers. This has led to great innovation in mobile phone development over the past 20 years.\n\nThe common components found on all phones are:\n\n\nAll mobile phones are designed to work on cellular networks and contain a standard set of services that allow phones of different types and in different countries to communicate with each other. However, they can also support other features added by various manufacturers over the years:\n\n\nA typical smartphone contains a number of metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) integrated circuit (IC) chips, which in turn contain billions of tiny MOS field-effect transistors (MOSFETs). A typical smartphone contains the following MOS IC chips.\n\n\nIn early stages, every mobile phone company had its own user interface, which can be considered as \"closed\" operating system, since there was a minimal configurability. A limited variety of basic applications (usually games, accessories like calculator or conversion tool and so on) was usually included with the phone and those were not available otherwise. Early mobile phones included basic web browser, for reading basic WAP pages. Handhelds (Personal digital assistants like Palm, running Palm OS) were more sophisticated and also included more advanced browser and a touch screen (for use with stylus), but these were not broadly used, comparing to standard phones. Other capabilities like Pulling and Pushing Emails or working with calendar were also made more accessible but it usually required physical (and not wireless) Syncing. BlackBerry 850, an email pager, released January 19, 1999, was the first device to integrate Email.\n\nA major step towards a more \"open\" mobile OS was the symbian S60 OS, that could be expanded by downloading software (written in C++, java or python), and its appearance was more configurable. In July 2008, Apple introduced its App store, which made downloading mobile applications more accessible. In October 2008, the HTC Dream was the first commercially released device to use the Linux-based Android OS, which was purchased and further developed by Google and the Open Handset Alliance to create an open competitor to other major smartphone platforms of the time (Mainly Symbian operating system, BlackBerry OS, and iOS)-The operating system offered a customizable graphical user interface and a notification system showing a list of recent messages pushed from apps.\n\nThe most commonly used data application on mobile phones is SMS text messaging. The first SMS text message was sent from a computer to a mobile phone in 1992 in the UK, while the first person-to-person SMS from phone to phone was sent in Finland in 1993.\n\nThe first mobile news service, delivered via SMS, was launched in Finland in 2000. Mobile news services are expanding with many organizations providing \"on-demand\" news services by SMS. Some also provide \"instant\" news pushed out by SMS.\n\nMobile payments were first trialled in Finland in 1998 when two Coca-Cola vending machines in Espoo were enabled to work with SMS payments. Eventually, the idea spread and in 1999 the Philippines launched the first commercial mobile payments systems, on the mobile operators Globe and Smart. Today, mobile payments ranging from mobile banking to mobile credit cards to mobile commerce are very widely used in Asia and Africa, and in selected European markets. Usually, the SMS services utilize short code.\n\nSome network operators have utilized USSD for information, entertainment or finance services (e.g. M-Pesa).\n\nOther non-SMS data services used on mobile phones include mobile music, downloadable logos and pictures, gaming, gambling, adult entertainment and advertising. The first downloadable mobile content was sold to a mobile phone in Finland in 1998, when Radiolinja (now Elisa) introduced the downloadable ringtone service. In 1999, Japanese mobile operator NTT DoCoMo introduced its mobile Internet service, i-Mode, which today is the world's largest mobile Internet service.\n\nEven after the appearance of smartphones, network operators have continued to offer information services, although in some places, those services have become less common.\n\nPower supply \n\nMobile phones generally obtain power from rechargeable batteries. There are a variety of ways used to charge cell phones, including USB, portable batteries, mains power (using an AC adapter), cigarette lighters (using an adapter), or a dynamo. In 2009, the first wireless charger was released for consumer use. Some manufacturers have been experimenting with alternative power sources, including solar cells.\n\nVarious initiatives, such as the EU Common External Power Supply have been announced to standardize the interface to the charger, and to promote energy efficiency of mains-operated chargers. A star rating system is promoted by some manufacturers, where the most efficient chargers consume less than 0.03 watts and obtain a five-star rating.\n\nGet to know about the best and fastest phone chargers. \n\nMost modern mobile phones use a lithium-ion battery. A popular early mobile phone battery was the nickel metal-hydride (NiMH) type, due to its relatively small size and low weight. Lithium-ion batteries later became commonly used, as they are lighter and do not have the voltage depression due to long-term over-charging that nickel metal-hydride batteries do. Many mobile phone manufacturers use lithium–polymer batteries as opposed to the older lithium-ion, the main advantages being even lower weight and the possibility to make the battery a shape other than strict cuboid.\n\nGSM mobile phones require a small microchip called a Subscriber Identity Module or SIM card, to function. The SIM card is approximately the size of a small postage stamp and is usually placed underneath the battery in the rear of the unit. The SIM securely stores the service-subscriber key (IMSI) used to identify a subscriber on mobile telephony devices (such as mobile phones and computers). The SIM card allows users to change phones by simply removing the SIM card from one mobile phone and inserting it into another mobile phone or broadband telephony device.\n\nA SIM card contains its unique serial number, internationally unique number of the mobile user (IMSI), security authentication and ciphering information, temporary information related to the local network, a list of the services the user has access to and two passwords (PIN for usual use and PUK for unlocking).\n\nSIM cards are available in three standard sizes. The first is the size of a credit card (85.60 mm × 53.98 mm x 0.76 mm, defined by ISO/IEC 7810 as ID-1). The newer, most popular miniature version has the same thickness but a length of 25 mm and a width of 15 mm (ISO/IEC 7810 ID-000), and has one of its corners truncated (chamfered) to prevent misinsertion. The newest incarnation known as the 3FF or micro-SIM has dimensions of 15 mm × 12 mm. Most cards of the two smaller sizes are supplied as a full-sized card with the smaller card held in place by a few plastic links; it can easily be broken off to be used in a device that uses the smaller SIM.\n\nThe first SIM card was made in 1991 by Munich smart card maker Giesecke & Devrient for the Finnish wireless network operator Radiolinja. Giesecke & Devrient sold the first 300 SIM cards to Elisa (ex. Radiolinja).\n\nThose cell phones that do not use a SIM card have the data programmed into their memory. This data is accessed by using a special digit sequence to access the \"NAM\" as in \"Name\" or number programming menu. From there, information can be added, including a new number for the phone, new Service Provider numbers, new emergency numbers, new Authentication Key or A-Key code, and a Preferred Roaming List or PRL. However, to prevent the phone being accidentally disabled or removed from the network, the Service Provider typically locks this data with a Master Subsidiary Lock (MSL). The MSL also locks the device to a particular carrier when it is sold as a loss leader.\n\nThe MSL applies only to the SIM, so once the contract has expired, the MSL still applies to the SIM. The phone, however, is also initially locked by the manufacturer into the Service Provider's MSL. This lock may be disabled so that the phone can use other Service Providers' SIM cards. Most phones purchased outside the U.S. are unlocked phones because there are numerous Service Providers that are close to one another or have overlapping coverage. The cost to unlock a phone varies but is usually very cheap and is sometimes provided by independent phone vendors.\n\nA similar module called a Removable User Identity Module or RUIM card is present in some CDMA networks, notably in China and Indonesia.\n\nA hybrid mobile phone can take more than one SIM card, even of different types. The SIM and RUIM cards can be mixed together, and some phones also support three or four SIMs.\n\nFrom 2010 onwards they became popular in India and Indonesia and other emerging markets, attributed to the desire to obtain the lowest on-net calling rate. In Q3 2011, Nokia shipped 18 million of its low cost dual SIM phone range in an attempt to make up lost ground in the higher end smartphone market.\n\nMobile phones have a display device, some of which are also touch screens. The screen size varies greatly by model and is usually specified either as width and height in pixels or the diagonal measured in inches.\n\nSome mobiles have more than one display, for example that mobileKyocera Echo, an Android smartphone with a dual 3.5 inch screen. The screens can also be combined into a single 4.7 inch tablet style computer.\n\nMobile phones have central processing units (CPUs), similar to those in computers, but optimised to operate in low power environments. In smartphones, the CPU is typically integrated in a system-on-a-chip (SoC) application processor.\n\nMobile CPU performance depends not only on the clock rate (generally given in multiples of hertz) but also the memory hierarchy also greatly affects overall performance. Because of these problems, the performance of mobile phone CPUs is often more appropriately given by scores derived from various standardized tests to measure the real effective performance in commonly used applications.\n\nOther features that may be found on mobile phones include GPS navigation, music (MP3) and video (MP4) playback, RDS radio receiver, built-in projector, vibration and other \"silent\" ring options, alarms, memo recording, personal digital assistant functions, ability to watch streaming video, video download, video calling, built-in cameras (1.0+ Mpx) and camcorders (video recording), with autofocus and flash, ringtones, games, PTT, memory card reader (SD), USB (2.0), dual line support, infrared, Bluetooth (2.0) and WiFi connectivity, NFC, instant messaging, Internet e-mail and browsing and serving as a wireless modem.\nThe first smartphone was the Nokia 9000 Communicator in 1996 which added PDA functionality to the basic mobile phone at the time. As miniaturization and increased processing power of microchips has enabled ever more features to be added to phones, the concept of the smartphone has evolved, and what was a high-end smartphone five years ago, is a standard phone today.\n\nSeveral phone series have been introduced to address a given market segment, such as the RIM BlackBerry focusing on enterprise/corporate customer email needs; the SonyEricsson Walkman series of musicphones and Cybershot series of cameraphones; the Nokia Nseries of multimedia phones, the Palm Pre the HTC Dream and the Apple iPhone.\n\nNokia and the University of Cambridge demonstrated a bendable cell phone called the Morph. Some phones have an electromechanical transducer on the back which changes the electrical voice signal into mechanical vibrations. The vibrations flow through the cheek bones or forehead allowing the user to hear the conversation. This is useful in the noisy situations or if the user is hard of hearing.\n\nAs of 2018, there are smartphones that offer reverse wireless charging.\n\nMost mobile phone networks are digital and use the GSM, CDMA or iDEN standard which operate at various radio frequencies. These phones can only be used with a service plan from the same company. For example, a Verizon phone cannot be used with a T-Mobile service, and vica versa.\n\nA multi-mode phone operates across different standards whereas a multi-band phone (also known more specifically as dual, tri or quad band) mobile phone is a phone which is designed to work on more than one radio frequency. Some multi-mode phones can operate on analog networks as well (for example, dual band, tri-mode: AMPS 800 / CDMA 800 / CDMA 1900).\n\nFor a GSM phone, dual-band usually means 850 / 1900 MHz in the United States and Canada, 900 / 1800 MHz in Europe and most other countries. Tri-band means 850 / 1800 / 1900 MHz or 900 / 1800 / 1900 MHz. Quad-band means 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900 MHz, also called a world phone, since it can work on any GSM network.\n\nMulti-band phones have been valuable to enable roaming whereas multi-mode phones helped to introduce WCDMA features without customers having to give up the wide coverage of GSM. Almost every single true 3G phone sold is actually a WCDMA/GSM \"dual-mode\" mobile. This is also true of 2.75G phones such as those based on CDMA-2000 or EDGE.\n\nThe special challenge involved in producing a multi-mode mobile is in finding ways to share the components between the different standards. Obviously, the phone keypad and display should be shared, otherwise it would be hard to treat as one phone. Beyond that, though, there are challenges at each level of integration. How difficult these challenges are depends on the differences between systems. When talking about IS-95/GSM multi-mode phones, for example, or AMPS/IS-95 phones, the base band processing is very different from system to system. This leads to real difficulties in component integration and so to larger phones.\n\nAn interesting special case of multi-mode phones is the WCDMA/GSM phone. The radio interfaces are very different from each other, but mobile to core network messaging has strong similarities, meaning that software sharing is quite easy. Probably more importantly, the WCDMA air interface has been designed with GSM compatibility in mind. It has a special mode of operation, known as punctured mode, in which, instead of transmitting continuously, the mobile is able to stop sending for a short period and try searching for GSM carriers in the area. This mode allows for safe inter-frequency handovers with channel measurements which can only be approximated using \"pilot signals\" in other CDMA based systems.\n\nA final interesting case is that of mobiles covering the DS-WCDMA and MC-CDMA 3G variants of the CDMA-2000 protocol. Initially, the chip rate of these phones was incompatible. As part of the negotiations related to patents, it was agreed to use compatible chip rates. This should mean that, despite the fact that the air and system interfaces are quite different, even on a philosophical level, much of the hardware for each system inside a phone should be common with differences being mostly confined to software.\n\nMobile phones are now heavily used for data communications. such as SMS messages, browsing mobile web sites, and even streaming audio and video files. The main limiting factors are the size of the screen, lack of a keyboard, processing power and connection speed. Most cellphones, which supports data communications, can be used as wireless modems (via cable or bluetooth), to connect computer to internet. Such access method is slow and expensive, but it can be available in very remote areas.\n\nWith newer smartphones, screen resolution and processing power has become bigger and better. Some new phone CPUs run at over 1 GHz. Many complex programs are now available for the various smartphones, such as Symbian and Windows Mobile.\n\nConnection speed is based on network support. Originally data transfers over GSM networks were possible only over CSD (circuit switched data), it has bandwidth of 9600 bit/s and usually is billed by connection time (from network point of view, it does not differ much from voice call). Later, there were introduced improved version of CSD - HSCSD (high speed CSD), it could use multiple time slots for downlink, improving speed. Maximum speed for HSCSD is ~42 kbit/s, it also is billed by time. Later was introduced GPRS (general packet radio service), which operates on completely different principle. It also can use multiple time slots for transfer, but it does not tie up radio resources, when not transferring data (as opposed to CSD and like). GPRS usually is prioritized under voice and CSD, so latencies are large and variable. Later, GPRS was upgraded to EDGE, which differs mainly by radio modulation, squeezing more data capacity in same radio bandwidth. GPRS and EDGE usually are billed by data traffic volume. Some phones also feature full Qwerty keyboards, such as the LG enV.\n\nAs of April 2006, several models, such as the Nokia 6680, support 3G communications. Such phones have access to the Web via a free download of the Opera web browser. Verizon Wireless models come with Internet Explorer pre-loaded onto the phone.\n\nAs more complex features are added to phones, they become more vulnerable to viruses which exploit weaknesses in these features. Even text messages can be used in attacks by worms and viruses. Advanced phones capable of e-mail can be susceptible to viruses that can multiply by sending messages through a phone's address book. In some phone models, the USSD was exploited for inducing a factory reset, resulting in clearing the data and resetting the user settings.\n\nA virus may allow unauthorized users to access a phone to find passwords or corporate data stored on the device. Moreover, they can be used to commandeer the phone to make calls or send messages at the owner's expense.\n\nMobile phones used to have proprietary operating system unique only to the manufacturer which had the beneficial effect of making it harder to design a mass attack. However, the rise of software platforms and operating systems shared by many manufacturers such as Java, Microsoft operating systems, Linux, or Symbian OS, may increase the spread of viruses in the future.\n\nBluetooth is a feature now found in many higher-end phones, and the virus Caribe hijacked this function, making Bluetooth phones infect other Bluetooth phones running the Symbian OS. In early November 2004, several web sites began offering a specific piece of software promising ringtones and screensavers for certain phones. Those who downloaded the software found that it turned each icon on the phone's screen into a skull-and-crossbones and disabled their phones, so they could no longer send or receive text messages or access contact lists or calendars. The virus has since been dubbed \"Skulls\" by security experts. The Commwarrior-A virus was identified in March 2005, and it attempts to replicate itself through MMS to others on the phone's contact list. Like Cabir, Commwarrior-A also tries to communicate via Bluetooth wireless connections with other devices, which can eventually lead to draining the battery. The virus requires user intervention for propagation however.\n\nBluetooth phones are also subject to bluejacking, which although not a virus, does allow for the transmission of unwanted messages from anonymous Bluetooth users.\n\nMost current phones also have a built-in digital camera (see camera phone), that can have resolutions as high as 108M pixels.\n\nSound recording and video recording is often also possible. Most people do not walk around with a video camera, but do carry a phone. The arrival of video camera phones is transforming the availability of video to consumers, and helps fuel citizen journalism.\n\n"}

In the U.S., he is often referred to as T.C. Chen. His older brother, Chen Tze-ming, is also a professional golfer. In 1982, T.C. Chen became the first professional golfer from Taiwan to earn a PGA Tour card. He played a total of 132 tournaments on the PGA Tour, making the cut in 78, with 13 top-ten finishes, and over $633,000 in total earnings.\n\nAt the 1985 U.S. Open, he scored the first double eagle in U.S. Open history and tied the record low scores for the championship at that time after 36 holes (134) and 54 holes (203), but he fell away in the final round and finished tied for second, one shot behind Andy North. His fourth round included a quadruple-bogey eight that featured a chip shot that he hit twice in one swing, and became part of the history of disastrous shots in the final round of a major. As a result of this shot, he is sometimes referred to as \"Two Chip\" Chen.\n\nChen finished second twice in his career, at the 1983 Kemper Open, where he lost a five-man playoff to Fred Couples, and the 1985 U.S. Open.

{"id": "2155752", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2155752", "title": "Citizen science", "text": "Citizen science\n\nCitizen science (CS; also known as community science, crowd science, crowd-sourced science, civic science, volunteer monitoring, or online citizen science) is scientific research conducted, in whole or in part, by amateur (or nonprofessional) scientists. Citizen science is sometimes described as \"public participation in scientific research,\" participatory monitoring, and participatory action research whose outcomes are often advancements in scientific research, as well as an increase in the public's understanding of science. Based on Alexa rankings iNaturalist is currently the most popular citizen science website followed by eBird and then Zooniverse in second and third place respectively.\n\nThe term CS has multiple origins, as well as differing concepts. It was first defined independently in the mid-1990s by Rick Bonney in the United States and Alan Irwin in the United Kingdom. Alan Irwin, a British sociologist, defines CS as \"developing concepts of scientific citizenship which foregrounds the necessity of opening up science and science policy processes to the public\". Irwin sought to reclaim two dimensions of the relationship between citizens and science: 1) that science should be responsive to citizens' concerns and needs; and 2) that citizens themselves could produce reliable scientific knowledge. The American ornithologist Rick Bonney, unaware of Irwin's work, defined CS as projects in which nonscientists, such as amateur birdwatchers, voluntarily contributed scientific data. This describes a more limited role for citizens in scientific research than Irwin's conception of the term.\n\nThe terms \"citizen science\" and \"citizen scientists\" entered the Oxford English Dictionary (\"OED\") in June 2014. \"Citizen science\" is defined as \"scientific work undertaken by members of the general public, often in collaboration with or under the direction of professional scientists and scientific institutions\". \"Citizen scientist\" is defined as: (a) \"a scientist whose work is characterized by a sense of responsibility to serve the best interests of the wider community (now rare)\"; or (b) \"a member of the general public who engages in scientific work, often in collaboration with or under the direction of professional scientists and scientific institutions; an amateur scientist\". The first use of the term \"citizen scientist\" can be found in the magazine \"New Scientist\" in an article about ufology from October 1979.\n\nMuki Haklay cites, from a policy report for the Wilson Center entitled \"Citizen Science and Policy: A European Perspective\", an alternate first use of the term \"citizen science\" by R. Kerson in the magazine \"MIT Technology Review\" from January 1989. Quoting from the Wilson Center report: \"The new form of engagement in science received the name 'citizen science'. The first recorded example of the use of the term is from 1989, describing how 225 volunteers across the US collected rain samples to assist the Audubon Society in an acid-rain awareness raising campaign.\"\n\nA \"\"Green Paper on Citizen Science\"\" was published in 2013 by the European Commission's Digital Science Unit and Socientize.eu, which included a definition for CS, referring to \"the general public engagement in scientific research activities when citizens actively contribute to science either with their intellectual effort or surrounding knowledge or with their tools and resources. Participants provide experimental data and facilities for researchers, raise new questions and co-create a new scientific culture.\"\n\nCitizen science may be performed by individuals, teams, or networks of volunteers. Citizen scientists often partner with professional scientists to achieve common goals. Large volunteer networks often allow scientists to accomplish tasks that would be too expensive or time-consuming to accomplish through other means.\n\nMany citizen-science projects serve education and outreach goals. These projects may be designed for a formal classroom environment or an informal education environment such as museums.\n\nCitizen science has evolved over the past four decades. Recent projects place more emphasis on scientifically sound practices and measurable goals for public education. Modern citizen science differs from its historical forms primarily in the access for, and subsequent scale of, public participation; technology is credited as one of the main drivers of the recent explosion of citizen science activity.\n\nIn March 2015, the Office of Science and Technology Policy published a factsheet entitled \"Empowering Students and Others through Citizen Science and Crowdsourcing\". Quoting: \"Citizen science and crowdsourcing projects are powerful tools for providing students with skills needed to excel in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). Volunteers in citizen science, for example, gain hands-on experience doing real science, and in many cases take that learning outside of the traditional classroom setting\".\nIn May 2016, a new open-access journal was started by the Citizen Science Association along with Ubiquity Press called \"Citizen Science: Theory and Practice\" (CS:T&P). Quoting from the editorial article titled \"The Theory and Practice of Citizen Science: Launching a New Journal\", \"CS:T&P provides the space to enhance the quality and impact of citizen science efforts by deeply exploring the citizen science concept in all its forms and across disciplines. By examining, critiquing, and sharing findings across a variety of citizen science endeavors, we can dig into the underpinnings and assumptions of citizen science and critically analyze its practice and outcomes.\"\n\nOther definitions for citizen science have also been proposed. For example, Bruce Lewenstein of Cornell University's Communication and S&TS departments describes 3 possible definitions:\n\nScientists and scholars who have used other definitions include Frank N. von Hippel, Stephen Schneider, Neal Lane and Jon Beckwith. Other alternative terminologies proposed are \"civic science\" and \"civic scientist\".\n\nFurther, Muki Haklay offers an overview of the typologies of the level of citizen participation in citizen science, which range from \"crowdsourcing\" (level 1), where the citizen acts as a sensor, to \"distributed intelligence\" (level 2), where the citizen acts as a basic interpreter, to \"participatory science\", where citizens contribute to problem definition and data collection (level 3), to \"extreme citizen science\", which involves collaboration between the citizen and scientists in problem definition, collection and data analysis.\n\nA 2014 Mashable article defines a citizen scientist as: \"Anybody who voluntarily contributes his or her time and resources toward scientific research in partnership with professional scientists.\"\n\nIn 2016 the Australian Citizen Science Association released their definition which states \"Citizen science involves public participation and collaboration in scientific research with the aim to increase scientific knowledge.\"\n\nIn 2016, the book \"Analyzing the Role of Citizen Science in Modern Research\" defined citizen science as \"work undertaken by civic educators together with citizen communities to advance science, foster a broad scientific mentality, and/or encourage democratic engagement, which allows society to deal rationally with complex modern problems\".\n\nIn a Smart City era, Citizen Science relays on various web-based tools (eg.WebGIS) and becomes Cyber Citizen Science. Some projects, such as SETI@home, use the Internet to take advantage of distributed computing. These projects are generally passive. Computation tasks are performed by volunteers' computers and require little involvement beyond initial setup. There is disagreement as to whether these projects should be classified as citizen science.\n\nThe astrophysicist and Galaxy Zoo co-founder Kevin Schawinski stated: \"We prefer to call this [Galaxy Zoo] citizen science because it's a better description of what you're doing; you're a regular citizen but you're doing science. Crowd sourcing sounds a bit like, well, you're just a member of the crowd and you're not; you're our collaborator. You're pro-actively involved in the process of science by participating.\"\n\nCompared to SETI@home, \"Galaxy Zoo volunteers do real work. They're not just passively running something on their computer and hoping that they'll be the first person to find aliens. They have a stake in science that comes out of it, which means that they are now interested in what we do with it, and what we find.\"\n\nCitizen policy may be another result of citizen science initiatives. Bethany Brookshire (pen name SciCurious) writes: \"If citizens are going to live with the benefits or potential consequences of science (as the vast majority of them will), it's incredibly important to make sure that they are not only well informed about changes and advances in science and technology, but that they also ... are able to ... influence the science policy decisions that could impact their lives.\"\n\nCitizen involvement in scientific projects has become a means of encouraging curiosity and greater understanding of science whilst providing an unprecedented engagement between professional scientists and the general public. In a research report published by the National Park Service in 2008, Brett Amy Thelen and Rachel K. Thiet mention the following concerns, previously reported in the literature, about the validity of volunteer-generated data:\n\nThe question of data accuracy, in particular, remains open. John Losey, who created the Lost Ladybug citizen science project, has argued that the cost-effectiveness of citizen science data can outweigh data quality issues, if properly managed.\n\nIn December 2016, authors M. Kosmala, A. Wiggins, A. Swanson and B. Simmons published a study in the journal Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment called \"Assessing Data Quality in Citizen Science\". The abstract describes how ecological and environmental CS projects have enormous potential to advance science. Also, CS projects can influence policy and guide resource management by producing datasets that are otherwise infeasible to generate. In the section \"In a Nutshell\" (pg3), four condensed conclusions are stated. They are:\n\nThey conclude that as CS continues to grow and mature, a key metric of project success they expect to see will be a growing awareness of data quality. They also conclude that CS will emerge as a general tool helping \"to collect otherwise unobtainable high-quality data in support of policy and resource management, conservation monitoring, and basic science.\"\n\nA study of Canadian lepidoptera datasets published in 2018 compared the use of a professionally curated dataset of butterfly specimen records with four years of data from a CS program, eButterfly. The eButterfly dataset was used as it was determined to be of high quality because of the expert vetting process used on the site, and there existed a historic dataset covering the same geographic area consisting of specimen data, much of it institutional. The authors note that, in this case, CS data provides both novel and complementary information to the specimen data. Five new species were reported from the CS data, and geographic distribution information was improved for over 80% of species in the combined dataset when CS data was included.\n\nIn March 2015, the state of Wyoming passed new laws (Senate Files 12 and 80) clarifying that trespassing laws applied even if the trespasser's intention was to gather data to further a U.S. government science program. This hampered some CS researchers who were collecting data while on other people's land.\n\nVarious studies have been published that explore the ethics of CS, including issues such as intellectual property and project design.(e.g.) The Citizen Science Association (CSA), based at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, and the European Citizen Science Association (ECSA), based in the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, have working groups on ethics and principles.\n\nIn September 2015, the European Citizen Science Association (ECSA) published its \"Ten Principles of Citizen Science\", which have been developed by the \"Sharing best practice and building capacity\" working group of the ECSA, led by the Natural History Museum, London with input from many members of the association.\nThe medical ethics of internet crowdsourcing has been questioned by Graber & Graber in the \"Journal of Medical Ethics\". In particular, they analyse the effect of games and the crowdsourcing project Foldit. They conclude: \"games can have possible adverse effects, and that they manipulate the user into participation\".\n\nIn March 2019 the online journal \"Citizen Science: Theory and Practice\" launched a collection of articles\non the theme of Ethical Issues in Citizen Science. The articles are introduced with (quoting): \"Citizen science can challenge existing ethical norms because it falls outside of customary methods of ensuring that research is conducted ethically. What ethical issues arise when engaging the public in research? How have these issues been addressed, and how should they be addressed in the future?\"\n\nIn June 2019, \"\" (EASTS) published an issue titled \"Citizen Science: Practices and Problems\" which contains 15 articles/studies on CS, including many relevant subjects of which ethics is one. Quoting from the introduction Citizen, Science, and Citizen Science: \"The term citizen science has become very popular among scholars as well as the general public, and, given its growing presence in East Asia, it is perhaps not a moment too soon to have a special issue of EASTS on the topic.\"\n\nIn the research paper \"Can citizen science enhance public understanding of science?\" by Bonney et al. 2016, statistics which analyse the economic worth of citizen science are used, drawn from two papers: i)Sauermann and Franzoni 2015, and\nii)Theobald et al. 2015. In \"Crowd science user contribution patterns and their implications\" by Sauermann and Franzoni (2015), seven projects from the Zooniverse web portal are used to estimate the monetary value of the CS that had taken place. The 7 projects are: Solar Stormwatch, Galaxy Zoo Supernovae, Galaxy Zoo Hubble, Moon Zoo, Old Weather, The Milky Way Project and Planet Hunters. Using data from 180 days in 2010, they find a total of 100,386 users participated, contributing 129,540 hours of unpaid work. Estimating at a rate of $12 an hour (an undergraduate research assistant's basic wage), the total contributions amount to $1,554,474, an average of $222,068 per project. The range over the 7 projects was from $22,717 to $654,130.\n\nIn \"Global change and local solutions: Tapping the unrealized potential of citizen science for biodiversity research\" by Theobald et al. 2015, the authors surveyed 388 unique biodiversity-based projects. Quoting: \"We estimate that between 1.36 million and 2.28 million people volunteer annually in the 388 projects we surveyed, though variation is great\" and that \"the range of in-kind contribution of the volunteerism in our 388 citizen science projects as between $667 million to $2.5 billion annually.\"\n\nWorldwide participation in citizen science continues to grow. A list of the top five citizen science communities compiled by Marc Kuchner and Kristen Erickson in July 2018 shows a total of 3.75 million participants, although there is likely substantial overlap between the communities.\n\nThere have been studies published which examine the place of CS within education.(e.g.) Teaching aids can include books and activity or lesson plans.(e.g.). Some examples of studies are:\n\nFrom the Second International Handbook of Science Education, a chapter entitled: \"Citizen Science, Ecojustice, and Science Education: Rethinking an Education from Nowhere\" by Mueller and Tippins (2011), acknowledges in the abstract that: \"There is an emerging emphasis in science education on engaging youth in citizen science.\" The authors also ask: \"whether citizen science goes further with respect to citizen development.\" The abstract ends by stating that the \"chapter takes account of the ways educators will collaborate with members of the community to effectively guide decisions, which offers promise for sharing a responsibility for democratizing science with others.\"\n\nFrom the journal Democracy and Education, an article entitled: \"Lessons Learned from Citizen Science in the Classroom\" by authors Gray, Nicosia and Jordan (GNJ) (2012) give a response to a study by Mueller, Tippins and Bryan (MTB) called \"The Future of Citizen Science\". GNJ begins by stating in the abstract that the study The Future of Citizen Science: \"provides an important theoretical perspective about the future of \ndemocratized science and K12 education.\" But GRB state: \"However, the authors (MTB) fail to adequately address the existing \nbarriers and constraints to moving community-based science into the classroom.\" They end the abstract by arguing: \"that the resource constraints of scientists, teachers, and students likely pose problems to moving true democratized science into the classroom.\"\n\nIn 2014, a study was published called \"Citizen Science and Lifelong Learning\" by R. Edwards in the journal \"Studies in the Education of Adults\". Edwards begins by writing in the abstract that CS projects have expanded over recent years and engaged CSs and professionals in diverse ways. He continues: \"Yet there has been little educational exploration of such projects to date.\" He describes that \"there has been limited exploration of the educational backgrounds of adult contributors to citizen science\". Edwards explains that CS contributors are referred to as volunteers, citizens or as amateurs. He ends the abstract: \"The article will explore the nature and significance of these different characterisations and also suggest possibilities for further research.\"\n\nIn the journal \"Microbiology and Biology Education\" a study was published by Shah and Martinez (2015) called \"Current Approaches in Implementing Citizen Science in the Classroom\". They begin by writing in the abstract that CS is a partnership between inexperienced amateurs and trained scientists. The authors continue: \"With recent studies showing a weakening in scientific competency of American students, incorporating citizen science initiatives in the curriculum provides a means to address deficiencies\". They argue that combining traditional and innovative methods can help provide a practical experience of science. The abstract ends: \"Citizen science can be used to emphasize the recognition and use of systematic approaches to solve problems affecting the community.\"\n\nIn November 2017, authors Mitchell, Triska and Liberatore published a study in \"PLOS ONE\" titled \"Benefits and Challenges of Incorporating Citizen Science into University Education\". The authors begin by stating in the abstract that CSs contribute data with the expectation that it will be used. It reports that CS has been used for first year university students as a means to experience research. They continue: \"Surveys of more than 1500 students showed that their environmental engagement increased significantly after participating in data collection and data analysis.\" However, only a third of students agreed that data collected by CSs was reliable. A positive outcome of this was that the students were more careful of their own research. The abstract ends: \"If true for citizen scientists in general, enabling participants as well as scientists to analyse data could enhance data quality, and so address a key constraint of broad-scale citizen science programs.\"\n\n\"Citizen science\" is a fairly new term but an old practice. Prior to the 20th century, science was often the pursuit of gentleman scientists, amateur or self-funded researchers such as Sir Isaac Newton, Benjamin Franklin, and Charles Darwin. By the mid-20th century, however, science was dominated by researchers employed by universities and government research laboratories. By the 1970s, this transformation was being called into question. Philosopher Paul Feyerabend called for a \"democratization of science\". Biochemist Erwin Chargaff advocated a return to science by nature-loving amateurs in the tradition of Descartes, Newton, Leibniz, Buffon, and Darwin—science dominated by \"amateurship instead of money-biased technical bureaucrats\".\n\nA study from 2016 indicates that the largest impact of citizen science is in research on biology, conservation and ecology, and is utilized mainly as a methodology of collecting and classifying data.\n\nAstronomy has long been a field where amateurs have contributed throughout time, all the way up to the present day.\n\nCollectively, amateur astronomers observe a variety of celestial objects and phenomena sometimes with equipment that they build themselves. Common targets of amateur astronomers include the Moon, planets, stars, comets, meteor showers, and a variety of deep-sky objects such as star clusters, galaxies, and nebulae. Observations of comets and stars are also used to measure the local level of artificial skyglow. One branch of amateur astronomy, amateur astrophotography, involves the taking of photos of the night sky. Many amateurs like to specialize in the observation of particular objects, types of objects, or types of events that interest them.\n\nThe American Association of Variable Star Observers has gathered data on variable stars for educational and professional analysis since 1911 and promotes participation beyond its membership on its Citizen Sky website.\n\nButterfly counts have a long tradition of involving individuals in the study of butterflies' range and their relative abundance. Two long-running programs are the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (started in 1976) and the North American Butterfly Association's Butterfly Count Program (started in 1975). There are various protocols for monitoring butterflies and different organizations support one or more of transects, counts and/or opportunistic sightings. eButterfly is an example of a program designed to capture any of the three types of counts for observers in North America. Species-specific programs also exist, with monarchs the prominent example. Two examples of this involve the counting of monarch butterflies during the fall migration to overwintering sites in Mexico: (1) Monarch Watch is a continent-wide project, while (2) the Cape May Monarch Monitoring Project is an example of a local project. The Austrian project Viel-Falter investigated if and how trained and supervised pupils are able to systematically collect data about the occurrence of diurnal butterflies, and how this data could contribute to a permanent butterfly monitoring system. Despite substantial identification uncertainties for some species or species groups, the data collected by pupils was successfully used to predict the general habitat quality for butterflies.\n\nCitizen science projects have become increasingly focused on providing benefits to scientific research. The North American Bird Phenology Program (historically called the Bird Migration and Distribution records) may have been the earliest collective effort of citizens collecting ornithological information in the U.S. The program, dating back to 1883, was started by Wells Woodbridge Cooke. Cooke established a network of observers around North America to collect bird migration records. The Audubon Society's Christmas Bird Count, which began in 1900, is another example of a long-standing tradition of citizen science which has persisted to the present day. Citizen scientists help gather data that will be analyzed by professional researchers, and can be used to produce bird population and biodiversity indicators.\n\nRaptor migration research relies on the data collected by the hawkwatching community. This mostly volunteer group counts migrating accipiters, buteos, falcons, harriers, kites, eagles, osprey, vultures and other raptors at hawk sites throughout North America during the spring and fall seasons. The daily data is uploaded to hawkcount.org where it can be viewed by professional scientists and the public.\n\nSuch indices can be useful tools to inform management, resource allocation, policy and planning. For example, European breeding bird survey data provide input for the Farmland Bird Index, adopted by the European Union as a structural indicator of sustainable development. This provides a cost-effective alternative to government monitoring.\n\nSimilarly, data collected by citizen scientists as part of BirdLife Australia's has been analysed to produce the first-ever Australian Terrestrial Bird Indices.\n\nThe concept of citizen science has been extended to the ocean environment for characterizing ocean dynamics and tracking marine debris. For example, the mobile app Marine Debris Tracker is a joint partnership of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the University of Georgia. Long term sampling efforts such as the continuous plankton recorder has been fitted on ships of opportunity since 1931. Plankton collection by sailors and subsequent genetic analysis was pioneered in 2013 by Indigo V Expeditions as a way to better understand marine microbial structure and function.\n\nCitizen science in Coral reef studies developed in the 21st century.\n\nUnderwater photography has become more popular since the early 2000s, resulting on millions of pictures posted every year on various websites and social media. This mass of documentation has great scientific potential, as millions of tourists possess a much superior coverage power than professional scientists, who cannot spend so much time in the field.\n\nAs a consequence, several participative sciences programs have been developed, supported by geotagging and identification web sites (such as iNaturalist.org). The \"Monitoring through many eyes\" project collates thousands of underwater images of the Great Barrier Reef and provides an interface for elicitation of reef health indicators.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) also offers opportunities for volunteer participation. By taking measurements in The United States' National Marine Sanctuaries, citizens contribute data to marine biology projects. In 2016, NOAA benefited from 137,000 hours of research.\n\nThere also exist protocols for auto-organization and self-teaching aimed at biodiversity-interested snorkelers, in order for them to turn their observations into sound scientific data, available for research. This kind of approach has been successfully used in Réunion island, allowing for tens of new records and even new species.\n\nFarmer participation in experiments has a long tradition in Agricultural science. There are many opportunities for citizen engagement in different parts of food systems. Citizen science is actively used for crop variety selection for climate adaptation, involving thousands of farmers.\n\nCitizen science has a long tradition in Natural science. But nowadays, citizen science projects can also be found in various fields of science like Art history. For example, the Zooniverse project AnnoTate is a transcription tool developed to enable volunteers to read and transcribe the personal papers of British-born and émigré artists. The papers are drawn from the Tate Archive. Another example of citizen science in art history is ARTigo. ARTigo collects semantic data on artworks from the footprints left by players of games featuring artwork images. From these footprints, ARTigo automatically builds a semantic search engine for artworks.\n\nNewer technologies have increased the options for citizen science. Citizen scientists can build and operate their own instruments to gather data for their own experiments or as part of a larger project. Examples include amateur radio, amateur astronomy, Six Sigma Projects, and Maker activities. Scientist Joshua Pearce has advocated for the creation of open-source hardware based scientific equipment that both citizen scientists and professional scientists, which can be replicated by digital manufacturing techniques such as 3D printing. Multiple studies have shown this approach radically reduces scientific equipment costs. Examples of this approach include water testing, nitrate and other environmental testing, basic biology and optics. Groups such as Public Lab, which is a community where citizen scientists can learn how to investigate environmental concerns using inexpensive DIY techniques, embody this approach.\n\nVideo technology is much used in scientific research. The Citizen Science Center in the Nature Research Center wing of the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences has exhibits on how to get involved in scientific research and become a citizen scientist. For example, visitors can observe birdfeeders at the Prairie Ridge Ecostation satellite facility via live video feed and record which species they see.\n\nSince 2005, the Genographic Project has used the latest genetic technology to expand our knowledge of the human story, and its pioneering use of DNA testing to engage and involve the public in the research effort has helped to create a new breed of \"citizen scientist\". Geno 2.0 expands the scope for citizen science, harnessing the power of the crowd to discover new details of human population history. This includes supporting, organization and dissemination of personal DNA (genetic) testing. Like Amateur astronomy, citizen scientists encouraged by volunteer organizations like the International Society of Genetic Genealogy have provided valuable information and research to the professional scientific community.\n\nWith unmanned aerial vehicles, further citizen science is enabled. One example is the ESA's AstroDrone smartphone app for gathering robotic data with the Parrot AR.Drone.\n\nCitizens in Space (CIS), a project of the United States Rocket Academy, seeks to combine citizen science with citizen space exploration. CIS is training citizen astronauts to fly as payload operators on suborbital reusable spacecraft that are now in development. CIS will also be developing, and encouraging others to develop, citizen-science payloads to fly on suborbital vehicles. CIS has already acquired a contract for 10 flights on the Lynx suborbital vehicle, being developed by XCOR Aerospace, and plans to acquire additional flights on XCOR Lynx and other suborbital vehicles in the future.\n\nCIS believes that \"The development of low-cost reusable suborbital spacecraft will be the next great enabler, allowing citizens to participate in space exploration and space science.\"\n\nThe Internet has been a boon to citizen science, particularly through gamification. One of the first Internet-based citizen science experiments was NASA's Clickworkers, which enabled the general public to assist in the classification of images, greatly reducing the time to analyze large data sets. Another was the Citizen Science Toolbox, launched in 2003, of the Australian Coastal Collaborative Research Centre. Mozak is a game in which players create 3D reconstructions from images of actual human and mouse neurons, helping to advance understanding of the brain. One of the largest citizen science games is Eyewire, a brain-mapping puzzle game developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that now has over 200,000 players. Another example is Quantum Moves, a game developed by the Center for Driven Community Research at Aarhus University, which uses online community efforts to solve quantum physics problems. The solutions found by players can then be used in the lab to feed computational algorithms used in building a scalable quantum computer.\n\nMore generally, Amazon's Mechanical Turk is frequently used in the creation, collection, and processing of data by paid citizens. There is controversy as to whether or not the data collected through such services is reliable, as it is subject to participants' desire for compensation. However, use of Mechanical Turk tends to quickly produce more diverse participant backgrounds, as well as comparably accurate data when compared to traditional collection methods.\n\nThe internet has also enabled citizen scientists to gather data to be analyzed by professional researchers. Citizen science networks are often involved in the observation of cyclic events of nature (phenology), such as effects of global warming on plant and animal life in different geographic areas, and in monitoring programs for natural-resource management. On BugGuide.Net, an online community of naturalists who share observations of arthropod, amateurs and professional researchers contribute to the analysis. By October 2014, BugGuide has over 808,718 images submitted by more than 27,846 contributors.\n\nNot counting iNaturalist and eBird, the Zooniverse is home to the internet's largest, most popular and most successful citizen science projects. The Zooniverse and the suite of projects it contains is produced, maintained and developed by the Citizen Science Alliance (CSA). The member institutions of the CSA work with many academic and other partners around the world to produce projects that use the efforts and ability of volunteers to help scientists and researchers deal with the flood of data that confronts them. On 29 June 2015, the Zooniverse released a new software version with a project-building tool allowing any registered user to create a project. Project owners may optionally complete an approval process to have their projects listed on the Zooniverse site and promoted to the Zooniverse community. A NASA/JPL picture to the right gives an example from one of Zooniverse's projects The Milky Way Project.\n\nThe website CosmoQuest has as its goal \"To create a community of people bent on together advancing our understanding of the universe; a community of people who are participating in doing science, who can explain why what they do matters, and what questions they are helping to answer.\n\nCrowdCrafting enables its participants to create and run projects where volunteers help with image classification, transcription, geocoding and more. The platform is powered by PyBossa software, a free and open-source framework for crowdsourcing.\n\nProject Soothe is a citizen science research project based at the University of Edinburgh. The aim of this research is to create a bank of soothing images, submitted by members of the public, which can be used to help others through psychotherapy and research in the future. Since 2015, Project Soothe has received over 600 soothing photographs from people in 23 countries. Anyone aged 12 years or over are eligible to participate in this research in two ways: (1) By submitting soothing photos that they have taken with a description of why the images make them feel soothed (2) By rating the photos that have been submitted by people worldwide for their soothability.\n\nThe bandwidth and ubiquity afforded by smartphones has vastly expanded the opportunities for citizen science. Examples include iNaturalist, the San Francisco project, the WildLab, Project Noah, and Aurorasurus. Due to their ubiquity, for example, Twitter, Facebook, and smartphones have been useful for citizen scientists, having enabled them to discover and propagate a new type of aurora dubbed \"STEVE\" in 2016.\n\nThere are also apps for monitoring birds, marine wildlife and other organisms, and the \"Loss of the Night\".\n\nAn Android app Sapelli is a mobile data-collection and -sharing platform designed with a particular focus on non-literate and illiterate users. The SPOTTERON app creates synergy effects for projects by sharing a common feature set.\n\n\"The Crowd and the Cloud\" is a four-part series broadcast during April 2017, which examines citizen science. It shows how smartphones, computers and mobile technology enable regular citizens to become part of a 21st-century way of doing science. The programs also demonstrate how CSs help professional scientists to advance knowledge, which helps speed up new discoveries and innovations. The Crowd & The Cloud is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation.\n\nSince 1975, in order to improve earthquake detection and collect useful information, the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre monitors the visits of earthquake eyewitnesses to its website and relies on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nCitizen science has been used to provide valuable data in hydrology (catchment science), notably flood risk, water quality and water resource management. A growth in internet use and smartphone ownership has allowed users to collect and share real-time flood-risk information using, for example, social media and web-based forms. Although traditional data collection methods are well-established, citizen science is being used to fill the data gaps on a local level, and is therefore meaningful to individual communities. It has been demonstrated that citizen science is particularly advantageous during a flash flood because the public are more likely to witness these rarer hydrological events than scientists.\n\nCitizen science includes projects that help monitor plastics and their associated pollution. These include The Ocean Cleanup, #OneLess, The Big Microplastic Survey, EXXpedition and Alliance to End Plastic Waste. Ellipsis seeks to map the distribution of litter using aerial data mapping by unmanned aerial vehicles and machine learning software. A Zooniverse project called The Plastic Tide (now finished) helped train an algorithm used by Ellipsis.\n\nProjects that use apps include:\n\nExamples of relevant articles (by date):\n\n\nExamples of relevant scientific studies or books include (by date):\n\n\nCitizen sensing can be a form of Citizen science: (quote) \"The work of citizen sensing, as a form of citizen science, then further transforms Stengers’s notion of the work of science by moving the experimental facts and collectives where scientific work is undertaken out of the laboratory of experts and into the world of citizens.\" Similar sensing activities include Crowdsensing and Participatory monitoring. While the idea of using mobile technology to aid this sensing is not new, creating devices and systems that can be used to aid regulation has not been straightforward. Some examples of projects that include citizen sensing are:\n\nResources for computer science and scientific crowdsourcing projects concerning coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can be found on the internet or as apps. Some such projects are listed below:\n\n\nFor coronavirus studies and information that can help enable CS, many online resources are available through open access and open science websites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first Conference on Public Participation in Scientific Research was held in Portland, Oregon in August 2012. Citizen science is now often a theme at large conferences, such as the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union.\n\nIn 2010, 2012 and 2014 there were three Citizen Cybersience summits, organised by the Citizen Cyberscience Centre in Geneva and University College London. The 2014 summit was hosted in London and attracted over 300 participants.\n\nIn November 2015, the ETH Zürich and University of Zürich hosted an international meeting on the \"Challenges and Opportunities in Citizen Science\".\n\nThe first citizen science conference hosted by the Citizen Science Association was in San Jose, California, in February 2015 in partnership with the AAAS conference. The Citizen Science Association conference, CitSci 2017, was held in Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States, between 17 and 20 May 2017. The conference had more than 600 attendees. The next CitSci is in March 2019 in Raleigh, USA.\n\nThe platform \"Österreich forscht\" hosts the annual Austrian citizen science conference since 2015.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2155767", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2155767", "title": "American cheese", "text": "American cheese\n\nModern American cheese is a type of processed cheese made from cheddar, colby, or similar cheeses. It is mild with a creamy and salty flavor, has a medium-firm consistency, and has a low melting point. It can be yellow or white in color; yellow American cheese is seasoned and colored with annatto. It originated in the 1910s and is a common staple in many American dishes.\n\nBritish colonists made cheddar cheese soon after their arrival in North America. By 1790, American-made cheddars were being exported back to England. According to Robert Carlton Brown, author of \"The Complete Book of Cheese\", \"The English called our imitation Yankee, or American, Cheddar, while here at home it was popularly known as yellow or store cheese\".\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" lists the first known usage of \"American cheese\" as occurring in the Frankfort, Kentucky, newspaper \"The Guardian of Freedom\" in 1804. The next usage given is in 1860 by Charles Dickens in his series \"The Uncommercial Traveller\".\n\nIn 1878, the total export of American cheese was 355 million pounds per year, with an expected growth to 1,420 million pounds.\nAfter patenting a new method for manufacturing processed cheese in 1916, James L. Kraft began marketing it in the late 1910s, and the term \"American cheese\" rapidly began to refer to the processed variety instead of the traditional but more expensive cheddars also made and sold in the US.\n\nAccording to the US Standards of Identity for Dairy Products, part of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), to be labeled \"American cheese\" a processed cheese is required to be manufactured from cheddar cheese, colby cheese, washed curd cheese, or granular cheese, or any mixture of two or more of these. The CFR also includes regulations for the manufacturing of processed American cheese.\n\nBecause its manufacturing process differs from traditional cheeses, federal laws mandate that it be labeled as \"processed American cheese\" if made from combining more than one cheese, or \"processed American cheese food\" if dairy ingredients such as cream, milk, skim milk, buttermilk, cheese whey, or albumin from cheese whey are added.\n\nTraditional cheese is ground, combined with emulsifying agents and other ingredients, mixed and heated until it forms a \"melted homogeneous\" mixture. To pasteurize it, the cheese mixture must be heated to a temperature of at least for a minimum of 30 seconds. Composition requirements of processed American cheese control the percentage of milkfat, moisture, salt and pH value in the final product, along with specifications for flavor, body and texture, color, and meltability.\n\nProcessed American cheese is packaged in individually wrapped slices, as unwrapped slices sold in stacks, or in unsliced blocks. Individually wrapped slices are formed from processed cheese which solidifies only between the wrapping medium; these slices, sold as \"singles\", are typically the least like traditional cheese. Blocks of American cheese are more similar to traditional cheese, and are sliced to order at deli counters.\n\nAmericans purchased about $2.77 billion worth of American cheese in 2018, but the popularity was falling, and, according to Bloomberg News, sales were projected to drop 1.6% in 2018. The average price for a pound of American was below $4 for the first time since 2011.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2155773", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2155773", "title": "Voice of the Beehive", "text": "Voice of the Beehive\n\nVoice of the Beehive was an Anglo-American alternative pop rock band formed in London in 1986 by Californian sisters Tracey Bryn and Melissa Brooke Belland, daughters of The Four Preps singer Bruce Belland. They teamed with British musicians Mike Jones, Martin Brett, Mark Bedford and Daniel Woodgate, the latter two of which were former members of Madness. Bedford left after making formative contributions to the band and did not feature again, while Woodgate stayed for most of the band's main period of activity. The band took their name from the Greek meaning of the name Melissa, meaning honey bee.\n\nThe band had five Top 40 singles from two albums in the UK. Their biggest commercial success came with the singles \"I Say Nothing\", \"Don't Call Me Baby\", \"Monsters and Angels\" and \"I Think I Love You\", taken from albums \"Let It Bee\" and \"Honey Lingers\". \"Sex & Misery\", a third album, was released in 1996; by this point sisters Tracey and Melissa were the sole group members. The band reformed in 2003 to play a two-week UK tour.\n\nThe members of Voice of the Beehive have gone their separate ways. Tracey Bryn is a teacher in Laguna Beach, California. Melissa Belland runs her own company Made in Heaven, also in Laguna Beach. Martin Brett runs Brett Dempsey Music Productions in London and joined I, Ludicrous on bass guitar in 2008. In 2011, he released his first solo single \"Lover's Lane\" under his original punk name Brett Martini. He also trained to become a facial hair specialist for film, theatre, and television in 2010. Daniel \"Woody\" Woodgate still plays drums, together with Mark Bedford on bass, in Madness. Mike Jones lives in Norwich, England and still plays guitar.\n\nIn October 2017, Bryn and Belland reformed with the original line-up to play a pair of concert dates in London, including the '80s/'90s revival show Indie Daze 4.\n\n\n\n\nVoice of the Beehive provided harmonies on Bill Drummond's album, \"The Man\" (1986).\n\nAn early version of \"Beat of Love\" was featured on the London Records compilation \"Giant\" (1987).\n\nMelissa and Tracey contributed a cover of \"Three Feet High and Rising\" to the Johnny Cash tribute album \"Til Things Are Brighter\" (1988).\n\nIn 1993, Voice of the Beehive contributed a cover version of \"Gimme Shelter\" with Jimmy Somerville to an EP released to raise funds for the Putting Our House in Order homeless initiative. The single, which contained different duet versions of the song on each format, peaked at No. 23 in the UK, and No. 214 in Australia.\n\n"}
{"id": "2155774", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2155774", "title": "Frampton Cotterell", "text": "Frampton Cotterell\n\nFrampton Cotterell is a village and parish, in South Gloucestershire, South West England, on the River Frome. The village is contiguous with Winterbourne to the south-west and Coalpit Heath to the east. The parish borders Iron Acton to the north and Westerleigh to the south-east, the large town of Yate is away. The village is north-east of the city of Bristol.\n\nThe village has evolved from a once rural Gloucestershire village, to a partial dormitory village for Bristol. The population according to the UK crime statistics was around 9,385 and is increasing. The population was remeasured at the 2011 census and came to 6,520 for the parish alone.\n\nVery little archaeological work has taken place in the Frampton Cotterell area so knowledge of the area prior to the Anglo-Saxon arrival is limited. Local historians tend to use field names and street names to work out the distant history of the village. It is believed from place names that there were two settlements in the area in the Roman times. One centred on the group of shops at the Church Road/Frampton End Road junction, where the name \"Dullage\" survived until the 1940s. The second was in rural farmland west of Cogmill in between Frampton Cotterell and Iron Acton, here several fields held the name \"Chessolds\" from the old English 'ceastel' meaning 'a heap of stones'.\n\nThe name Frampton means 'the settlement (farmstead or village) on the Frome'. Frampton Cotterell was recorded as Frantone in the Domesday Book (1086). All the other local villages (Westerleigh, Stoke Gifford and Winterbourne) also have Old English names, suggesting they were either conquered or resettled between 577 and 1066.\n\nEarly in the 11th century, Frampton may have been under the manor of Winterbourne, a later medieval record refers to 'the Lordship of Frampton and Winterbourne'. This would have included Stoke Gifford. However, at no point after 1066 were these three manors owned by the same person. The name of a lane in the village, 'Harris Barton' also may be of pre-Norman origin, Barton comes from the Anglo-Saxon 'bere' and 'tun' meaning 'place where grain was stored' this suggests there was a farm here prior to Norman conquest.\n\nIn 1086 Frampton was held by Walter the Crossbowman (Balistarius) and then contained 10 villagers and 11 smallholders. Indicating a total population of about 100, to this total should be added slaves and their families. In 1086 there was a church which was not there before 1066 (so under 20 years old) this church was probably on the site of St. Peter's church today. There were also two water mills, probably behind the church (near Mill Lane today) and at Cogmill.\n\nBy 1301 Frampton had a third watermill, probably at 'Frampton Lido' upstream from the church (where remains of a mill could be seen as late as the 1970s), a windmill, on the site of the current one at Brockeridge. and a coal pit, presumably at Coalpit Heath (although this name did not appear until around 1680)\n\nBy the 13th century the village was known as Frampton Cotell. The name Cotell or Cotterell is derived from the Cotele Family, lords of Frampton Manor in the 12th and early 13th centuries. Their manor house was not at modern day Frampton Court, it was probably located behind the church on the east of Mill Lane, here the field names 'Hall Marsh' and 'Hall Marsh Mead' survived into the 19th Century.\n\nThe medieval village was long and rectangular, located on the ridge between (Lower) Stone Close and the River Frome, and between Church Road and Rectory Road. The village was provided for using the open field system. Surrounding the village would have been three big fields; these fields were cultivated by peasants who held scattered strips in the many furlongs which made up the fields, every year one of the fields would be left unploughed and would be fertilised by the manure from the local animals. This system would have provided for the village.\n\nBesides these fields there were also common wastes, Frampton Common, Adam's Land, Brockridge, Goose Green, Woodend Green, and Tovey's Green to name a few.\n\nThis system lasted until about 1550 by which time the big fields had made way for compact farms, cultivated by independent farmers as they saw fit. This boosted the village's economy, providing dairy products, cider, pigs, and turnips.\n\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries, the hamlets of Brockridge, Adam's Land and others joined together with Frampton Cotterell to form the modern village. Since then the modern village has joined with Winterbourne, Watley's End and Coalpit Heath. One notable Industrial Revolution landmark in the village is the hat factory on Park Lane.\n\nFrampton Cotterell Church of England Primary School was established on School Road in the village in the 19th century. It was moved to its present location on Rectory Road in the 1960s.\n\nOrdnance Survey maps from the middle of the 20th century show open land between the three villages of Frampton Cotterell, Coalpit Heath and Winterbourne. Hamlets at Watley's End, Frampton End and Harris Barton, all of which are now part of Frampton Cotterell and Winterbourne, were still separate at this time.\n\nThe most dramatic changes have occurred in the south-east of the village at the boundary with Coalpit Heath, in 1928 Beesmoor Road was constructed through farmland, connecting Badminton Road, the main Yate – Bristol thoroughfare, with the Woodend area of Frampton Cotterell. Since then estates of closes, drives and cul-de-sacs have been built up in the green land between Park Lane and Woodend Road.\n\nIn the 1960s Church Road, the main thoroughfare, was rerouted A field in between Rectory Road and Church Road called 'Benson's Field' was sold for housing becoming the 'Benson's Estate'. This estate comprises Beaufort Road, Foxe Road, Winchcombe Road and Brookside Close. Another field north of School Road was built on becoming Robel Avenue and Western Avenue. Houses on Heather Avenue and Beesmoor Road were built.\n\nIn 1996, an area of farmland to the south of the village was sold in a joint contract with housing estate developers Barratt and Taywood. In the years 1996–2000 they built a large housing estate known as Park Farm, adding an extra 200 3,4 and 5 bedroomed homes to the settlement. There was fierce opposition from local residents, particularly those living on Beesmoor Road. This followed another 20th-century housing development between Woodend Road and Beesmoor Road. In 2011 Barratt Homes began building another large estate on Denny's Field, alongside Park Farm and Heather Avenue, again despite fierce opposition from residents.\n\nFrampton Cotterell is seven miles north east of Bristol City centre, and two miles outside the city's ring road, and lies in the commuter belt. It is joined to the villages of Winterbourne and Coalpit Heath, forming a sizeable settlement with a collective population of around 17,500. It is linked by the A432 to Yate and Chipping Sodbury to the north and Downend to the south.\n\nThere are three takeaways in the village. A Chinese takeaway also sells fish and chips, a fish and chip shop and there is an Indian takeaway all on Lower Stone Close. The Golden Lion Pub on Beesmoor Road was an Indian takeaway with restaurant facilities but has now been demolished for housing despite being one of the oldest buildings in the village. The village has its own Post Office located in the Nisa shop. The village also has a handful of small grocery shops including a Sainsburys which was opened in 2016.\n\nThe A432 is used by residents to travel into nearby Yate and Downend for services.\n\nFrampton Cotterell is twinned with Kelbra, Germany.\n\nFrampton is mentioned in the Monty Python sketch \"Adolph Hitler lives In a guesthouse in Minehead\".\n\nAn electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward stretches from \"Frampton Cotterell\" in the south to Iron Acton in the north. The total population of this ward taken at the 2011 census was 7,327.\n\nCogmill is the name of a historical, and now almost non-existent hamlet in the north of Frampton Cotterell parish in South Gloucestershire. It is located on the B4058 between Frampton Cotterell and Iron Acton, and was possibly the site of a Roman settlement.\nThe name derives from the site of a watermill that was the originally recorded in the 1086 Doomsday census as \"Cock Mill\" and served as a gristmill for \"Cock Mill Farm\". The last known recording of this spelling was in the Appointment Roll of 1841 Tithe Map, from then on it has been known as Cogmill.\n\nThe watermill remained functioning until the early 19th century and was final demolished in 1958 by a compulsory purchase order by South Gloucestershire Council to eliminate a sharp corner on the B4058 road. Cogmill Farm still remains but the only evidence of the watermill is the remains of the tail-race tunnel and spill tunnel each side of the current river bridge. An article describing the mill was published by the Bristol Industrial Archaeological Society in 1981 (BIAS Journal, volume 13, page 2)\n\nIn 2006 near the site of Cogmill, South Gloucestershire Council selected an area of land for a residential site for Gypsies and Travellers called Frampton Park.\n\n"}

Following a year playing in New Zealand either side of two seasons with Nairn County, and a three-year spell with English Football Conference club Yeovil Town, McGinlay returned to the Highland League with Elgin City in 1988.\n\nHe then progressed through English League football, initially playing with Shrewsbury Town then with Bury. After a successful loan spell with Millwall, in which he scored during their unsuccessful participation in the 1991 Football League play-offs, McGinlay moved to The Den permanently for the 1991–92 season. He scored 27 goals in 52 league matches for the London club.\n\nMcGinlay is perhaps best known for his five-year spell with Bolton Wanderers between 1992 and 1997, where his scoring exploits led to him being nicknamed 'Super John'. After his goals eliminated FA Cup holders Liverpool from the competition, he successfully partnered fellow Scot Andy Walker as the \" Trotters\" gained promotion from the third tier in 1993, with McGinlay scoring the match winning penalty in the last fixture against local rivals Preston North End.\n\nFurther cup 'giant killings' over teams such as Everton and Arsenal followed the next year, with McGinlay featuring prominently – he scored 33 goals across all competitions during the campaign, and the team became known in local media as 'white hot' due to the performances. In the 1995 he was in the side which gained promotion to the Premier League via the play-offs, playing all 120 minutes of the dramatic 4–3 victory over Reading (they were relegated in the subsequent campaign), and also started in the League Cup Final (lost 2–1 to Liverpool) in the same season.\n\nIn April 1997, he scored the last goals at Burnden Park, finishing as the club and the division's top scorer with 24 goals from 43 games as Bolton returned to the top level, this time as champions. He scored a hat-trick in a 6–1 cup win over Tottenham Hotspur. He made seven further league appearances for the club at the outset of the next season before joining second-tier Bradford City in November 1997 for £625,000 in what would be an injury-hit move. He later had the Bolton club crest tattooed on his arm.\n\nMcGinlay had short spells with Oldham Athletic and American team Cincinnati Riverhawks before moving into management with non-league sides Ilkeston Town and Gresley Rovers. In 2013, he was also employed as a chief scout by Wigan Athletic,\nappointed by former Bolton teammate Owen Coyle during his spell as manager, after spending time working in similar roles in the US with Cincinnati Kings (where he had also finished his playing career after serving as a manager), and with the Scottish Football Association. In 2014, McGinlay took over the 240-year old Horwich pub the Original Bay Horse. He rejoined Bolton Wanderers in an official ambassadorial role in 2020, in an attempt by the club to strengthen their ties with the sports courses held at the University of Bolton, and to bring former players back into contact with the club.\n\nDuring his time with Bolton, McGinlay earned 13 international caps for Scotland, scoring four goals; his last and most important strike was the only goal of a 1–0 victory over Sweden (which featured a memorable goalkeeping display by Jim Leighton) and helped the national side qualify for World Cup 98, although he did not make the squad for that tournament, nor for the Euro 96 competition. McGinlay lined up for Scotland alongside his childhood friend from Fort William, Duncan Shearer, who also spent much of his career in England – the two never played in the same team at club level. He also featured in the infamous '3-second match' in Estonia and its replay in Monaco, and missed the birth of his daughter in order to travel to Belarus for another qualification game the following year.\n\n\n\n"}

The population as at the 2011 census was 507.\n\nIt is at the point where the River Wye flows into the River Derwent and prospered from mills on both. The border of the Peak District National Park runs through the village west of the River Wye and immediately to the north of Chatsworth Road.\n\nNotable features are the bridge over the River Derwent, St Katherine's Church, Rowsley and the Grade-II*-listed Peacock hotel, originally built in 1652 as a manor house by John Stevenson, agent to Lady Manners, whose family crest bearing a peacock gives it its name. Both Longfellow and Landseer are said to have stayed there. Nearby is Chatsworth House, home of the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire.\n\nIt was the site of an extensive motive power depot and marshalling yard, the first being built by the Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway with a railway station designed by Joseph Paxton in 1849. This was replaced by a new station when the line was extended northwards in 1862. It was frequently used by King Edward VII when he visited Chatsworth House. The original station became a goods depot until 1968, when it was used as a contractor's yard. It then became the centrepiece of a shopping development known as Peak Village.\n\nRowsley South is the current northern terminus of the preserved heritage railway Peak Rail, and is located about a quarter-mile south of the village itself. Running for a length of four miles between Rowsley and Matlock, it is projected that the heritage railway will run into Rowsley proper in the near future. In the long term, the A6 presents the greatest challenge to the organisation, as a new bridge is required to be built over it in order to reach the viaduct which crosses the River Derwent and thence the trackbed that runs through the Duke of Rutland's estate to Bakewell.\n\n\n\n"}

After one season at Millwall, he made a £1 million transfer to Crystal Palace of the Premier League in 1992. In March 1995, he became the first Premier League player to receive a doping ban, testing positive for cannabis. He joined Tottenham Hotspur that June for a club record £4.5 million and was part of their team that won the League Cup in 1999. After a one-game spell at Bolton Wanderers, he returned to Wrexham for the remainder of his career.\n\nArmstrong was tracked by the international teams of Wales, Nigeria and the Republic of Ireland but rejected all three. He earned one cap for England B in 1994 and was called up to the senior side in March 1999 but did not play.\n\nArmstrong was born in Newcastle upon Tyne to an Irish father and Nigerian mother, and moved to London at age three. He was raised by foster parents in Wales, where he began playing as an amateur goalkeeper in local leagues, before leaving school and giving up on football aged 16. A friend reintroduced him to the game by bringing him to Llay Welfare in the Welsh National League, while he packed burgers during the day for £30 a week. He gained the attention of local professional club Wrexham.\n\nAt Wrexham, Armstrong made his professional debut as a teenager during the 1989–90 Football League season in the old Fourth Division, and managed to score three times through the course of the season. In his two-year spell at the club, he went on to play 60 games, scoring 13 times. He took part in the 1990–91 European Cup Winners' Cup, where he scored the only goal of the first round tie against Denmark's Lyngby before elimination by eventual champions Manchester United in the second round.\n\nHe moved to Bruce Rioch's Millwall for £50,000 in August 1991.\n\nAfter one season with Millwall, Armstrong joined Steve Coppell's Crystal Palace for £1 million in 1992, ahead of the inaugural season of the Premier League. He found a home at Selhurst Park, where he was the club's top-scorer with 23 league goals in his first campaign.\n\nIn January 1995, Kevin Keegan's Newcastle United bid £4.7 million to sign Armstrong, but Palace rejected the offer.\n\nIn March 1995, Armstrong tested positive for cannabis, becoming the first Premier League player to fail a drug test, and was banned for four matches. \"The Independent\" sports writer Glenn Moore criticised The FA for punishing Armstrong despite not taking action against Dennis Wise and Vinnie Jones for recent violent offences, adding that cannabis was extremely unlikely to have aided his performance. Armstrong finished the season on 18 goals, not enough to save the Eagles from relegation.\n\nHis 23 Premier League goals for Palace were the club record until Wilfried Zaha surpassed him in August 2018.\n\nAfter interest from FA Cup holders Everton, Armstrong joined Tottenham Hotspur for a fee of £4.5 million in June 1995, replacing Bayern Munich-bound Jürgen Klinsmann. With the funds coming from a new kit deal and the sales of Klinsmann, Gica Popescu and Ilie Dumitrescu, this made him both Tottenham's most expensive signing, until Les Ferdinand for £6 million in 1997. It was also Palace's most expensive sale, until Andrew Johnson joined Everton for £8.6 million in 2006.\n\nArmstrong made his Spurs debut on 19 August in a 1–1 draw at Manchester City, and scored his first goals in the form of a brace on 20 September in a 4–0 win over Chester City in the second round of the League Cup. He totalled 22 goals (15 league) in his first season, including the winner in the North London derby against Arsenal on 18 November at White Hart Lane. At the start of the season, he was criticised by tabloids for a slow start, and was seen as an inadequate replacement for Klinsmann and inferior to Arsenal's new striker Dennis Bergkamp. However, he built up a prolific partnership with Teddy Sheringham; Armstrong's two goals in a 4–1 win over Manchester United on 1 January 1996 brought their combined total to 23 goals.\n\nOn 28 December 1998, Armstrong scored a late hat-trick in a 4–1 home win over Everton, and when he was substituted at the end of the game his teammate David Ginola got in his way to bow down to him. He scored five times in their League Cup run that season, including two in a 3–1 win over Manchester United in the quarter-finals, but was unused in the final at Wembley Stadium which Spurs won over Leicester City.\n\nArmstrong's 2000–01 season was disrupted by frequent groin injuries. Two ankle operations meant he missed the entirety of the following season.\n\nOn 28 August 2002, Armstrong signed for Bolton Wanderers in a deal that would see him earn a low wage until his first-team debut, estimated at two months away due to fitness. His only appearance came on 2 October, in a 1–0 home defeat to Bury in the second round of the League Cup, lasting just 53 minutes before being substituted for Henrik Pedersen.\n\nArmstrong returned to Wrexham aged 32 on 4 July 2003, signing a three-year deal ahead of their return to the Second Division.\n\nTowards the start of his professional career, Armstrong was tracked by Wales, and was called up by Nigeria ahead of the 1994 FIFA World Cup, but turned them down in hope of representing England. Republic of Ireland managers Jack Charlton and Mick McCarthy also tried to enlist Armstrong in the late 1990s; he later revealed that his Tottenham contract said that he could only play for England as to avoid limits on foreign players in European fixtures.\n\nArmstrong played his only international match on 10 May 1994, a 3–2 friendly win for England B over Northern Ireland at Hillsborough. He came on as a 65th-minute substitute for Chris Sutton.\n\nHe received a call up to the England squad by Kevin Keegan to play Poland in March 1999, but was ultimately never capped for the senior side.\n\nIn July 2016, Armstrong was arrested for possession of cannabis, cocaine and ecstasy after a raid in West Kensington. He pleaded guilty to possession of Class A and Class B drugs at Hammersmith Magistrates' Court and was fined £375. He denied having a drug problem.\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIn the 18th century till early 19th Century Spanish Colonial era, the Municipality of Atimonan, Tayabas (now Quezon Province) was suffering from frequent attacks by Pirates and outlaws. A man from this place named Mariano Aguilar thought of moving to a safer place to live and dwell with his family. He asked a good friend and distant relative, Juan Salvador to help him find a nearby peaceful place to settle for good. Along with their immediate families, they walked through the forest south-west bound until they found a clean river. While traversing the riverside, they found a scenic body of water which was best described as ladder-like as the waters run over ladder-like steps. They initially named the place Hagdan-hagdan (ladder-like structure). This majestic scenery nowadays is a local tourist attraction that can be found in Barangay Dayap. As they moved further west, they found a huge, serene and attractive flat land area where they later established the town proper. In this land, they built houses for their families and divided the land area between their family members, relatives and friends. The population in this newly discovered area had increased dramatically and before the end of the 19th century, this place was officially called Agdangan (from the word \"hagdan-hagdan\"), a barrio of the nearby town Unisan, Tayabas.\n\nAs time went by, the two families realized that there was a pressing need to build church, school buildings, marketplace, the government building and other facilities basic to the community. The Salvador family donated the site for the school buildings and the public cemetery while Aguilar family donated the sites for the Roman Catholic Church, the marketplace and the municipal building. The population had increased further as a result of influx of people from nearby municipalities and provinces adjacent to Tayabas (Now Quezon province). The Philippine National Railways established a permanent train station which also contributed to the migration of people to this place. The Aguilar and Salvador families, along with other migrant families such as Garin, Banal, Mapaye, Trinidad and Urgino with the help of local civic organization led by Mr. Pedro Olase, again took proactive efforts to gain independence from Unisan. Their actions led to the foundation of the municipality of Agdangan, Province of Tayabas. The culmination of this endeavor happened on April 1, 1939, when President Manuel Quezon signed into a Law the creation of the Municipality of Agdangan, Tayabas. As of today, April 1 has been commemorated in honor of the town's foundation day and is commonly known as Agdangan Day.\n\nIn that year, the Commonwealth President appointed Roque M. Aguilar, the eldest son of Mariano Aguilar as Mayor until the first election was held the following year where Catalino Aguilar, his youngest brother was elected as Mayor along with Crispin Salvador as Vice Mayor.\n\nThrough the years, without any lucrative source of income and industries, the modern-day Agdangan has already improved in terms of infrastructure. The local revenue has grown fairly well. The resilience, diligence, peacefulness and simplicity of people of Agdangan have been the key factors of its success.\n\nAgdangan is politically subdivided into 12 barangays.\n\nList of Municipal Mayors:\n\n"}
{"id": "2155794", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2155794", "title": "Alabat, Quezon", "text": "Alabat, Quezon\n\n', officially the ', (), is a in the province of , . According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe name Alabat came from the local Tagalog word \"Alabat\", meaning \"balustrade\".\n\nThe town is home to a few speakers of the critically endangered Inagta Alabat language, one of the most endangered languages in the world as listed by UNESCO.\n\nLong before the colonial Spanish, Japanese, or Americans set foot on Alabat Island, the mountains were already inhabited by the “Baluga” (aborigines). Nomadic by nature, they would clean patches of land, plant rice and vegetables and hunt. After harvest, they would migrate to another part of the forest and repeat the cycle. The elder of the community was their leader and adviser. During drought, they made temporary houses near the shore and used fishing as their primary means of livelihood.\n\nLocal folklore says that a Spanish priest from the mainland saw the Island from across the Lamon bay. He was curious as to what lay in that island and its inhabitants. The Spanish priest crossed the bay on the boat and founded a church at what is today barangay Gordon. The church today is underwater but the cross can still be seen.\n\nThe name Alabat which has been used as it is now, came from the word \"Alâbât\" (local Tagalog word for balustrade or balcony). The early inhabitants of this place made balustrades across their doors to prevent small children from walking out of the house or falling from the stairwells.\n\nLocal history says that a platoon of American soldiers came to Lupac after the Philippine independence to conduct a survey. They entered a native’s hut and asked the person what the name of the place was. The owner of the house at that time was holding the balustrade that he was making. Unable to understand the English language, he thought they were asking what he was doing so the native replied \"alâbât\"! The leader took his diary and wrote the word A L A B A T without any accent.\n\nAnother local folklore says that the name 'Alabat' was from Muslim origins where Alabat comes from Allah-bat, and if the word is mixed up actually means bat-ala or bathala which is the local word for god.\n\nBut according to the RA 956, Alabat was founded on Oct. 23, 1903. Meanwhile, the legal basis of creation is May 15, 1900\n\nThe separation of Silangan (now Quezon) as an independent municipality was declared in 1914. This municipality was named in honor of President Manuel L Quezon. In 1929, the inhabitants of Sangirin (now Perez) clamored also for separation from Alabat. By the end of the same year, Sangirin was granted freedom and became an independent municipality named in honor of then Felimon Perez, who was the Governor of the Province.\n\nToday, Alabat island is composed of 3 towns, Perez in the northern tip, Alabat town proper at the center and Quezon in the south. The town of Alabat saw new development in the early 21st century: a modern port was built to replace the old one, more paved roads are being constructed, telephone service, cellphone sites, wireless internet and local government projects to improve the lives of Alabateños.\n\nLocated centrally on the eponymous Alabat Island, It is between the Pacific Ocean and Lamon Bay, with good fishing grounds, fertile soil, wide plains and near to a river and safe landing shore.\n\nAlabat is politically subdivided into 19 barangays, 5 of which are urban and 14 rural.\nAlabat experiences tropical monsoon climate (\"Am\") as the rainfall throughout the year is influenced by the monsoon. There is a significant difference between the driest and the wettest month whereas the driest month is April with rainfall total 81.5 mm, while the wettest month is December with rainfall total 571.4 mm. The rainfall seems increased significantly in October. The mean temperature throughout the year is ranging from the coolest month with average of 26.2 °C of January to the hottest month with average of 29.4 °C on May.\nThe first inhabitants of the town were the indigenous Inagta Alabat people who are Negritos, the earliest settlers in the Philippines. The indigenous people spoke the Inagta Alabat language, one of the most endangered languages in the world.\n\nDuring the Spanish colonial period, Alabat was inhabited by the family of Caparros because of its safe landing shore and overflowing natural resources. Other immigrants from Gumaca came pouring in upon hearing the suitability of this place from human habitation. They named the place \"CAMAGONG\". Perhaps this name was taken from trees which bore edible fruits called Camagong or Mabulo which grow abundantly in Camagong Mountain, the highest mountain in Alabat Island.\n\nIt was said that Rev. Father Jesus, in charge of the parish of Gumaca possessed a telescope. Almost every time he looked through his telescope to see whether Moro Vintas were coming. He reached out a focus on the sandy shore of Ilangin, the present sitio of the barrio of Gordon. It came to his mind that an Ermita should be built in that place. So he summoned the leaders of the settlers to congregate and encouraged them to settle at Ilangin in order to make a vesita and build on Ermita.\n\nThe growth was so abrupt that a village sprang. Father Jesus called this village \"GORDO\" (meaning fat) and afterwards he named it Gordon in memory of his town in Spain.\n\nThen came Don Pedro Pica and his brother Don Nicolas, who wanted to establish a home in Gorden. Upon reaching the place they found out that anchorage was difficult on account of the shallow coral reefs and absence of navigable river. Inquiries were made among the villagers and Don Pedro learned the suitability of Lupac, the present site of Alabat. He ordered Francisco Mercado, Modesto Arcaya, Casimero Caparros, Luciano Caparros, Cayetano Caparros, Pedro Caparros, Juan Caparros, Venancio Mascariña, Valentin Lisardo, Camilo Febrer, Antonio Montañez, Mariano Silva, Eusebio Baranta, Cayetano Olivares, Jose Canata and many others to clean a site in Lupac for a new village.\n\nWhen Rev. Father Jesus heard about this act of Don Pedro Pica, he was neatly infuriated. He accused these two men and by the order of Capitang Totoy of Gumaca, they were taken to prison until Don Pedro Pica secured freedom from the gobernadorcillos of Tayabas. The Gobernadorcillo also pardoned his brother Don Nicolas Pica the following year. The interest of these two brothers in Lupac did not fade away so they returned to the place and established a lumber industry. The Gobernadorcillo learned of their success in their industry and their able leadership to settlers of the place so Don Pedro, the elder, gained influence from the Gobernadorcillo and was appointed sub-Captain of Lupac under Capitan Totoy of Gumaca. Through the order of Father Jesus, Don Pedro Pica changed the name Lupac to BARCELONA in memory of the beautiful coastal town in Spain.\n\nWhen the American Expeditionary forces occupied Tayabas Province and appointed Carpenter as Military Governor, the name BARCELONA was changed to ALABAT.\n\nIn 2010, UNESCO released its 3rd world volume of Endangered Languages in the World, where 3 critically endangered languages were in the Philippines. One of these languages in the \"Alabat Island Agta\" language which has an estimated speaker of 30 people in the year 2000. The language was classified as \"Critically Endangered\", meaning the youngest speakers are grandparents and older, and they speak the language partially and infrequently and hardly pass the language to their children and grandchildren anymore. If the remaining 30 people do not pass their native language to the next generation of Alabat Agta people, their indigenous language will be extinct within a period of 1 to 2 decades.\n\nThe Alabat Agta people live only on the island of Alabat in Quezon province. They are one of the original Negrito settlers in the entire Philippines. They belong to the Aeta people classification, but have distinct language and belief systems unique to their own culture and heritage.\n\nEconomic activities in Alabat are heavily concentrated in the \"poblacion\" and other sub-urban barangays. Improved road network provides access from all towns in the island of Alabat to this partially urbanized town. Well-paved radial routes criss-crossing in and out of the town facilitate the transport of unlimited assortment of merchandise, supplies, and raw materials to and from the town on a round-the-clock basis. The major crops of the town are rice, coconut and calamansi.\n\n\nAlabat is considered one of the most important commercial and trading point in the island and in the whole Lamon Bay Area. This town are nested among a wide expanse of coconut trees, riceland and moderately rolling hills of gross and shrinks for pleasure. It has a rich fishing ground which supplies fish and other seafoods to neighboring towns.\nPort of Alabat is considered one of the longest port in the province.\n\n\n\nMunicipal officials (2019-2022):\n\nAlabat is accessible by land where tricycles are administered by Alabat Tricycle Operators and Drivers Association (ALTODA) and jeepneys travelling in and out of the town; and water transportation via Atimonan-Alabat Route through the Alabat Feeder Port. Traveling around the town proper is no problem since there are hundreds of tricycles circling the Town Proper.\n\nAlabat is served by a landline company like SANTELCOR, while the wireless phones and internet are provided by national communications companies Smart, Globe and Sun Cellular and a postal service is served by PHILPost.\n\nThe Alabat Cable TV System operates and covers most of the town while Quezon I Electric Cooperative provides Electricity to Alabat and nearby-towns. Alabat Municipal Waterworks System provide the waterworks.\n\nAlabat has a public hospital that is capable of providing most common medical services, as well as in handling medical emergencies. Alabat Island District Hospital, the institution which are considered to provide the same standard of healthcare and services, differing mainly with the medical and diagnostic facilities at hand.\n\nThese are staffed with qualified medical practitioners. The doctors are graduates of the many top reputable medical schools in the Philippines. Likewise, the nurses are the products of the many credible nursing schools in the country.\n\nAlabat has one tertiary school and numerous secondary and primary schools, including public and private.\nThe tertiary education system in Alabat provides instruction and training in fields of study, both for baccalaureate degrees and vocational courses. Southern Luzon State University- Alabat Campus - the only university in the island offers degree programs including education, information technology and fisheries.\n\nAside from tertiary school, the town also has an expanse footprint on the pre-school, primary and secondary levels of education, both in private and public schools. There are numerous day-care centers found all over the town.\n\n\n\n"}

The population in 2011 was 136,886, in an area of 318.19 km². Situated on both banks of the Tagus River, 32 km north-east of the Portuguese capital Lisbon, settlement in the area dates back to neolithic times, as evidenced by findings in the Cave of Pedra Furada. Vila Franca de Xira is said to have been founded by French followers of Portugal's first king, Afonso Henriques, around 1200.\n\nThe town is mostly famous for its bull-running festivals in July and October. Bulls are raised in the salty marshlands of the Ribatejo, which is also a notable breeding ground for the magnificent Lusitano horse, esteemed for its quick reflexes and maneuverability. A number of brightly coloured Portuguese bullfighting costumes are on display in the ethnographic museum in the town's bullring, the Praça de Toiros (or Touros) Palha Blanco. Nearby, the town's Misericórdia church features striking 18th-century azulejos (glazed tiles). The town also has a Museum of Neo-Realism.\n\nThree km south of Vila Franca de Xira lies the Lezíria Grande Equestrian Centre, where visitors can watch stylish displays of the impressive Lusitano horses. The centre also stages typical bullfighting spectacles in its outdoor bullring. Visitors can ride Lusitano horses and take dressage lessons at the Quinta de São Sebastião, a sprawling estate at Arruda dos Vinhos, 11 km west of Vila Franca de Xira.\n\nThe municipality contains several forts built during the Peninsular War and forming part of the Lines of Torres Vedras. These include the Fort of Subserra on the first line of defence and the Forts of Serra da Aguieira and the Fort of Casa on the second line. Another place of interest, on the left bank, is the Hermitage of Nossa Senhora de Alcamé, which was built so that farmers on the Tagus floodplain would both have somewhere to pray and also somewhere of safety during floods. An annual pilgrimage is held to the hermitage with participants going by boat from the town of Vila Franca de Xira on the right bank.\n\nThe current Mayor is Alberto Mesquita, elected in 2013 as a member of the Socialist Party.\n\nAdministratively, the municipality is divided into 6 civil parishes (\"freguesias\"):\n\n"}

He went to China in 1868.

Later he turned his attentions to mammals.\n\nWith his remarkable collection of specimens, he helped to set up a museum of natural history at Xujiahui in 1868, the first of its kind in China. (The museum had been known later as Musée Heude, but was incorporated into other museums since the 1950s.) He continued his scientific works until his death at Xujiahui.\n\n\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIt was formerly known as Piris. It is accessible by land via Lopez and Catanauan or by water transportation via Guinayangan from Lucena City.\n\nThe municipality of Buenavista is located in the eastern part of Quezon Province at the base of the Bondoc Peninsula. It is bounded on the northern part by Guinayangan, on the south by the town of San Narciso, on the western part by Lopez and Catanauan, and on the east by the Ragay Gulf facing Bicol Region. The municipality is about southeast of Metro Manila and about southeast of provincial capital, the city of Lucena.\n\nBuenavista is primarily upland municipality characterized by ragged terrain, generally hilly or mountainous with high plains, valleys and swamps. It lies on different slopes from 0-15% and above. There are three (3) types of soil that covers the municipality. These are Faraon Clay, Catanauan Clay loam and Bolinao Clay loam. This is the most extensive upland soil of the province mostly found in Bondoc Peninsula. Faraon Clay loam covers about 13,133.75 hectares which is 85% of the total land area of the municipality, 10%is said to be catanauan Clay loam and 5% of the total land area in Bolinao Clay loam. The greater portion of the soil types is used for grazing. The low-lying hills are planted to coconut and seasonal crops like corn, root crops, and fruit bearing trees.\n\nCatanauan Clay loam is found in the valley is used mostly on paddy rice field, while Bolinao Clay loam is devoted to coconut, bananas and other crops and some part has a mineral deposit like in Barangay Bulo and Cadlit.\n\nBuenavista is politically subdivided into 37 barangays.\nIts climate is classified as type 3 which means the rainfall is evenly distributed throughout the year.\n\nPiris was its former name. It was a mere hamlet of the municipality of Guinanyagan, province of Quezon and remained as such for quite a number of years until it finally became a municipality. Buenavista is now its official name which means beautiful view. Its original name was Piri as engraved in the oldest church bell which was donated by one Don Jose Casal in the year 1866. It used to be located in the Sitio of Pinagbayanan situated in the western side of the Piris River which is about one a half kilometers away from the present town site. This place became the choice of the founders who were a mixture of Bicolanos and Visayans to enable them to easily escape the Moro raids that were prevalent during the olden times. When the raids finally subsided, the barrio of Piris was transferred to its present location. The word Piri was changed to Piris and later re-changed to Piris.\n\nIn October 1936, some civic minded residents launched the proposition of making the place a municipality. They signed a petition for the separation of Piris from the municipality of Guinayangan. A group of seven members was formed and was commissioned to undertake a delegation to the Office of the Secretary of the Interior for the purpose. The group was composed of then Don Feliciano Roldan, Mariano San Jose, Honorio Hutamares, Teodorico Dosto, Ciriaco Parraba, Antonio Pasta and Francisco San Jose. The outbreak of the second global war marked the failure of the offices concerned to convert the place into a regular municipality.\n\nAfter the election of Gaudencio V. Vera to the Office of the Congressman for the second district of Quezon Province, Francisco San Jose, a native and public teacher of the place, was instructed by Congressman Vera to help prepare the necessary papers pertaining to the separation of Piris from Guinayangan. When the papers were prepared, House Bill No. 83 was passed by both houses of Congress and became Republic Act No. 495 under Proclamation No. 201 by President Elpidio Quirino, the corporate existence of Piris in the name Buenavista the 37th municipality of Quezon province, was fixed on 26 August 1950. An inauguration was celebrated by the town people under the leadership of Domingo Reyes and Yao Ching Kio, wealthy businessman of the place, with Congressman Vera as the guest of honor. When the municipality of Buenavista was inaugurated on August 26, 1950, it belonged to the seventh class. Six months thereafter, due to some increase in revenue, it rose to sixth class. Francisco Falqueza was appointed Municipal Mayor and held office beginning August 26, 1950, up to December 31, 1951, and on November 13, 1951, local election Primitivo Pasta Sr. becoming the first elected mayor.\n\nThe main dialect is Tagalog, although the Bicolanos, Visayan and Ilocano dialect are commonly used in the barangays.\n\n\nList of former mayors:\n\n"}

The Daang Maharlika or Pan-Philippine Highway runs at the town after Lopez in Southbound and after Santa Elena at the Northbound or from Manila. At the north end of Quirino Highway, it meets Daang Maharlika in Barangay Tabugon. It also meets the north end of Guinayangan Provincial Road which also meets Daang Maharlika in Barangay Sumulong. It is bounded to the north-west by Calauag Bay, south-west by Lopez, to the east by Guinayangan, and to the north by Basiad Bay and Tinig Bay; it is separated from Alabat Island by a 1 kilometer narrow strait.\n\nCalauag is subdivided into 81 Barangays:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calauag#Disputed_barangays\n\nThe town center (poblacion) consists of 12 barangays and 11 blocks from the PNR Station in the East to Pinagkamaligan ES on the west. Going west from Barangay Pinagtalleran via Quezon Street, there are five blocks of high concentration of shops, groceries, and banks.\n\nThe Government Center is located in the South of the town which consists of Municipal Hall which houses the City Library, Fire Station, Police Station and Precinct, and the Municipal Council building. Quezon Plaza is a well-used spot for programs and events. The Livelihood Center is two blocks away from the Plaza and Quezon Street. Central Park is also located in front of the Plaza and the City Hall.\n\nCalauag has a Tropical Climate like most of the country. Summers are hot and dry while the rainy season is cold and wet . It also falls under the Type IV Tropical Climate which has Rainfall is more or less evenly distributed throughout the year. Rainy season must be expected from end of May to last week of December\n\nAccording to the writings of Valentin Martin in his \"\"Ensayo de una sintesis de los trabajos realizados sos las corporaciones religiosas Españolas de Filipinas\"\", the first record of the establishment of a settlement in Calauag dates as far as the year 1584. However, the formal founding of the town was placed in the year 1851 with the union of the settlements in Apad and Calauag.\n\nThe first elected Captain of the town was Juan Sunog. In 1897 the town was placed the Revolutionary Government and Alipio Declaro became the Municipal President. In 1914 under Municipal President Marciano Roldan, the town was destroyed by fire for the first time in its history. On December 24, 1941, the town was occupied by the Japanese Imperial Army and on January 14, 1942, the town was again destroyed by fire. On April 19, 1945, the United States and Filipino forces liberated the town from Japanese occupation. The general headquarters of the Philippine Army and Constabulary under the Commonwealth regime was built and station in Calauag during and after the war from 1945 to 1946 against the Japanese.\n\nCalauag experienced a big controversy due to a decade long boundary dispute with the town of Santa Elena in the Province of Camarines Norte which resulted in a Supreme Court case, Presidential intervention, and the loss of a quarter of its land area. The disputed barangays were Cabuluan, Don Tomas Morato, Guitol, Kagtalaba, Maulawin, Patag Ibaba, Patag Ilaya, Plaridel, and Tabugon.\n\nOn October 14, 1991, the Provincial Government and Municipal Government of Calauag ordered the demolition of a boundary marker installed by the DENR. In October 1995, then-President Fidel V. Ramos came to Calauag to meet with local officials to resolve the boundary dispute between the two provinces and surveyed the whole disputed area. Calauag retained its jurisdiction, however, the case was elevated to the Supreme Court. The Case of Province of Quezon vs. Province of Camarines Norte eventually ruled in favor of Camarines Norte and Calauag ceased its political jurisdiction on the said barangays.\n\nCalauag has an agricultural-based economy. Most economic activity happens in Municipal Market and its vicinity. Most agricultural products are coconut-based and followed by rice, corn, fish, crabs and other seafoods. It is currently classified as First class-municipality.\n\nThe mayor for the 2019–2022 term is Rosalina O. Visorde, wife of former Mayor Luisito S. Visorde. Leah Dela Cruz is the town's incoming vice mayor. Under the 1987 Constitution, The mayor is restricted to three consecutive terms with three years per term, although a mayor can be elected again after an interruption of one term. The mayor has the direct control of the departments while the Municipal Administrator is indirectly in charge of all departments of the Government while the Vice Mayor is in charge of the Municipal Council which consists of seven Councilors and one Municipal Sangguniang Kabataan/SK (Youth Council) Chairman and a President of Liga ng mga Barangay which are elected every three years and Municipal Administrator is appointed by the mayor.\n\nIn the 18th Congress of the House of Representatives, Calauag is Represented by Helen Tan of the Fourth Congressional District of Quezon province. Representative Tan is now term-limited. The disputed barangays meanwhile are under First Congressional District of Camarines Norte, Represented by Josefina \"Josie\" B. Tallado. However, the disputed barangays still receive funds from some of the board members of Quezon province.\n\nIn the Provincial Board, the 4th District of Quezon is represented by four incoming board members for the 2019–2022 term: Roderick \"Derick\" Magbuhos (NPC), Rhodora \"Dhoray\" Tan (NP) and Isaias Ubana II (NPC).\n\n\nCalauag is accessible by Land Transportation like bus, and train via PNR Hondagua of Bicol Express Service. Calauag Station is currently under renovation due to damages of Typhoons and Storms and the Intercity Service is currently defunct. Traveling around the town proper is no problem since there are thousands of tricycles circling the Town Proper.\n\nQuezon I Electric Cooperative (QUEZELCO 1) provides Electricity to the entire 3rd and 4th congressional districts including Santa Elena, Camarines Norte and Del Gallego, Camarines Sur. Trans-Asia Renewable Energy will be constructed the 10 MW wind energy project soon to cope with the KW demand of the whole town and feed into the grid. Calauag Water District (CWD) provides water to the residents of the Town Proper and nearby barangays (villages). The Yaganak-Mambaling Dam is the source of water for the entire town. The Local, NDD and DSL internet are provided by PLDT which absorbed the local franchise of Santos Telephone Corporation which recently went into bankruptcy. The wireless network and internet are provided by national telecommunications companies PLDT (Smart and Sun Cellular) and Globe. Digital Cable Television is provided by local cable operator (Calauag CATV System) and national satellite television providers (Cignal, G Sat, and SkyDirect). While liquified petroleum gas may be purchased per cylinder tanks in gasoline stations or in local distributors.\n\nPublic Schools are operated by the Department of Education-Quezon and divided by two districts: The East District and The West District. There are also one public high school that operates inside the town proper.\n\n\nCalauag and nearby towns were being served by Radyo Natin 100.9 FM and QuezoNews-FM 94.5\n\n\nHistorically, the sister cities of Calauag are Guinayangan (Settlement started at Guinayangan before moving to Viñas and Apad), Tagkawayan (Daughter town of Guinayangan), and Buenavista (then Piris).\n\n"}
{"id": "2155836", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2155836", "title": "Arab Maghreb Union", "text": "Arab Maghreb Union\n\nThe Arab Maghreb Union (AMU) ( \"\") is a trade agreement aiming for economic and future political unity among Arab countries of the Maghreb in North Africa. Its members are the nations of Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia. The Union has been unable to achieve tangible progress on its goals due to deep economic and political disagreements between Morocco and Algeria regarding, among others, the issue of Western Sahara. No high level meetings have taken place since 3 July 2008, and commentators regard the Union as largely dormant.\n\nThe idea for an economic union of the Maghreb began with the independence of Tunisia and Morocco in 1956. It was not until thirty years later, though, that five Maghreb states—Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, and Tunisia—met for the first Maghreb summit in 1988. The Union was established on 17 February 1989 when the treaty was signed by the member states in Marrakech. According to the Constitutive Act, its aim is to guarantee cooperation \"with similar regional institutions... [to] take part in the enrichment of the international dialogue... [to] reinforce the independence of the member states and... [to] safeguard... their assets.\" Strategic relevance of the region is based on the fact that, collectively, it boasts large phosphate, oil, and gas reserves, and it is a transit centre to southern Europe. The success of the Union would, therefore be economically important.\n\nThere is a rotating chairmanship within the AMU which is held in turn by each nation. The current Secretary-General is the Tunisian Taïeb Baccouche.\n\nDuring the 16th session of the AMU Foreign Ministers, held on 12 November 1994 in Algiers, Egypt applied to join the AMU grouping.\n\n\nThe economy of the AMU combines the economies of four out of five member states. All countries are predominantly Arab & Muslims states. The four out of five AMU countries have a combined GDP (at purchasing power parity; PPP) of US$1.5276 trillions. The richest country on the basis of GDP per capita at PPP is Algeria. On the basis of per capita GDP (nominal), Libya is the richest country, with incomes exceeding US$65.803 per capita.\nThere have been problems of traditional rivalries within the AMU. For example, in 1994, Algeria decided to transfer the presidency of the AMU to Libya. This followed the diplomatic tensions between Algeria and other members, especially Morocco and Libya, whose leaders continuously refused to attend AMU meetings held in Algiers. Algerian officials justified the decision, arguing that they were simply complying with the AMU Constitutive Act, which stipulates that the presidency should in fact rotate on an annual basis. Algeria agreed to take over the presidency from Tunisia in 1994, but could not transfer it due to the absence of all required conditions to relinquish the presidency as stipulated by the Constitutive Act.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the decision to transfer the presidency of the Union, the Libyan leader, Muammar Gaddafi, stated that it was time to put the Union \"in the freezer\". This raised questions about Libya's position towards the Union. The concern was that Libya would have a negative influence on the manner in which it would preside over the organization.\n\nMoreover, traditional rivalries between Morocco and Algeria, and the unsolved question of Western Sahara's sovereignty, have blocked union meetings since the early 1990s despite several attempts to re-launch the political process. Western Sahara, a former Spanish colony south of Morocco that was \"reintegrated\" by the kingdom of Morocco, has declared independence as the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. The latest top-level conference, in mid-2005, was derailed by Morocco's refusal to meet, due to Algeria's vocal support for Sahrawi independence. Algeria has continuously supported the Polisario Front liberation movement.\n\nSeveral attempts have been made, notably by the United Nations, to resolve the Western Sahara issue. In mid-2003, the UN Secretary General's Personal Envoy, James Baker, proposed a settlement plan, also referred to as the Baker Plan II. The UN's proposal was rejected by Morocco and accepted by the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. As far as bilateral attempts are concerned, very little has been achieved, as Morocco continues to refuse any concessions that would allow the independence of Western Sahara, while Algeria maintains its support for the self-determination of the Sahrawis.\n\nIn addition, the quarrel between Gaddafi's Libya and Mauritania has not made the task of reinvigorating the organisation any easier. Mauritania has accused the Libyan Secret Services of being involved in a 2003 attempted coup against President Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya. Libya has denied the accusation.\n\n\n"}

The Wuffingas took their name from Wuffa, an early East Anglian king. Nothing is known of the members of the dynasty before Rædwald, who ruled from about 599 to c. 624. The Viking invasions of the ninth century destroyed the monasteries in East Anglia where many documents relating to the rule of the Wuffingas would have been kept.\n\nThe last of the Wuffingas kings was Ælfwald, who died in 749 and who was succeeded by kings whose lineage is unknown.\n\nThe following family tree includes the Wuffingas kings from Wehha to Ælfwald. They are numbered in order of ruling. Ecgric of East Anglia was also a member of the Wuffingas house, but his exact descent is not decided. He may have been Sigebert's brother, or his step-brother.\n\nThe kingdom of East Anglia was invaded by peoples from northern Europe during the 5th and 6th centuries. Historical sources relating to the genealogy of the East Anglian kings include the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" and Bede's \"Ecclesiastical History\", both compiled many years after the kingdom was formed, as well as a pedigree of Ælfwald contained in the Anglian collection that dates from the 9th century. In the pedigree, Ælfwald is claimed to descend from the god Wōden.\n\nAfter 749, East Anglia was ruled either by the Mercians or by kings whose genealogy is not known.\n\nSam Newton has claimed that the poem \"Beowulf\" may have been composed during the reign of Ælfwald of East Anglia. Before the end of his rule, Ælfwald's kingdom contained a group of ecclesiastical centres, all of which had strong associations with the Wuffingas dynasty. These included the sees at Dommoc and Helmham, St. Botulph's monastery at Icanho, the religious foundations at Ely and Dereham founded by daughters of Anna, the minster at Blythburgh and the monastery founded by Sigeberht prior to his abdication and subsequent death in battle.\n\nAfter comparing Sutton Hoo with archaeological sites in Sweden, Sune Lindqvist suggested in 1948 that the Wuffingas may have been related to the Royal House of Uppsala descended from Wiglaf.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2155853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2155853", "title": "Zeta Geminorum", "text": "Zeta Geminorum\n\nZeta Geminorum (ζ Geminorum, abbreviated Zeta Gem, ζ Gem) is a bright star with cluster components, distant optical components and a likely spectroscopic partner in the zodiac constellation of Gemini — in its south, on the left 'leg' of the twin Pollux. It is a classical Cepheid variable star, of which over 800 have been found in our galaxy. As such its regular pulsation and luminosity (proven in its class to correspond) and its relative proximity means the star is a useful calibrator in computing the cosmic distance ladder. Based on parallax measurements, it is approximately 1,200 light-years from the Sun.\n\nZeta Geminorum is the primary or 'A' component of a multiple star system designated WDS J07041+2034. It bears traditional name Mekbuda, usually anglicised to .\n\n\"ζ Geminorum\" (Latinised to \"Zeta Geminorum\") is the star's Bayer designation. WDS J07041+2034 A is its designation in the Washington Double Star Catalog. The designations of the two components as WDS J03158-0849 Aa and Ab derive from the convention used by the Washington Multiplicity Catalog (WMC) for multiple star systems, and adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU).\n\nZeta Geminorum bore the traditional name \"Mekbuda\", from an Arabic phrase meaning \"the lion's folded paw\" (Zeta and Epsilon Geminorum (Mebsuta) were the paws of a lion). In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN decided to attribute proper names to individual stars rather than entire multiple systems. It approved the name \"Mekbuda\" for the component WDS J07041+2034 Aa on 12 September 2016 and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names.\n\nIn Chinese, (), meaning \"Well (asterism)\" consists of eight stars in Gemini: Zeta, Mu, Gamma, Nu, Xi, Epsilon, 36 and Lambda. Zeta is (, ).\n\nIn 1825, German astronomer Julius Schmidt discovered that Zeta Geminorum varies in brightness with a period of about 10 days, although it had been suspected of variability as early as 1790. It was recognised as being related to the Cepheid class of variable stars, although was often treated as the prototype of its own class, the Geminids, because of its symmetrical light curve.\n\nIn 1899, American astronomer W. W. Campbell announced the star to have a variable radial velocity. (This variation was independently discovered by Russian astronomer Aristarkh Belopolsky, published in 1901.) Based on his observations, Campbell later published orbital elements for the binary. However, he found that the curve departed from a keplerian orbit and even suggested that it was a triple star system to explain the irregularities. The periodic variation in radial velocity of the Cepheid variables was later explained as being due to pulsations in the atmosphere of the star.\n\nThe periodicity of the star is itself variable, a trend first noted by German astronomer Paul Guthnick in 1920, who suspected that the period change was the result of an orbiting companion. In 1930, Danish astronomer Axel Nielsen suggested that the change was instead the result in a steady decrease of about 3.6 seconds per year in the period.\n\nZeta Geminorum has three visible companions known since the 19th century and listed in the Washington Double Star Catalog as B, C, and D. More recently, a possible spectroscopic companion has been listed, further faint stars close by have been catalogued, and a diffuse cluster has been identified as including Zeta Geminorum.\n\nThe brightest nearby star, WDS J07041+2034 C, is the magnitude 7.6 HD 268518, 91.9\" away when discovered in 1779 and 101.3\" distant in 2008. It is a foreground object, only a tenth the distance of Zeta Geminorum and a high proper motion star moving rapidly compared to the more distant stars. It is a G1 main sequence star very similar to the sun.\n\nThe closest visible companion is WDS J07041+2034 D, a 12th magnitude star measured to be 67.8\" away in 2008. It was 80\" distant when first measured in 1905. It appears on the sky between Zeta Geminorum and component C, but is a more distant object than either.\n\nWDS J07041+2034 B is an 11th magnitude star, 76.0\" distant in 1831 and 87.4\" in 2008. It is itself a spectroscopic binary, although little is known about the two components. The combined spectrum is of an F4 main sequence star. It is thought to be physically associated with the supergiant primary and a member of a loose cluster of stars around Zeta Geminorum.\n\nA combination of photometry, spectroscopy, and astrometry has identified 26 stars approximately 355 parsecs away, which are likely to be members of the birth cluster of Zeta Geminorum. The brightest are late B and early A giant stars such as the 7th magnitude stars HD 49381 and HD 50634, while the faintest detected cluster members are 12th magnitude class F main sequence stars including WDS J07041+2034 B.\n\nZeta Geminorum has been reported to be a spectroscopic binary on the basis of lunar occultation observations, but this has not been confirmed by other methods.\n\nZeta Geminorum's primary (WDS J07041+2034 Aa) is a Classical Cepheid variable that undergoes regular, periodic variation in brightness because of radial pulsations. In the V band, the apparent magnitude varies between a high of 3.68 and a low of 4.16 (with a mean of 3.93) over a period of 10.148 days. This period of variation is decreasing at the rate of 3.1 seconds per year, or 0.085 seconds per cycle. The spectral classification varies between F7Ib and G3Ib over the course of a pulsation cycle. Likewise the effective temperature of the outer envelope varies between 5,780 K and 5,260 K, while the radius varies from 61 to 69 times the Sun's radius. On average, it is radiating about 2,900 times the luminosity of the Sun.\n\nMembership of a cluster provides independent validation of distances determined using recent Hubble Space Telescope and Hipparcos parallaxes. This strongly constrains the star's distance: parsecs. Zeta Geminorum is thus an important calibrator for the Cepheid period-luminosity relation used for establishing the cosmic distance ladder. The Gaia Data Release 2 parallax of suggests the distance is towards the top end of this range, and has a comparable margin of error.\n"}

It is a successor to Dolby Digital (AC-3), also developed by Dolby, and has a number of improvements including support for a wider range of data rates (32 kbit/s to 6144 kbit/s), increased channel count and multi-program support (via substreams), and additional tools (algorithms) for representing compressed data and counteracting artifacts. While Dolby Digital (AC-3) supports up to five full-bandwidth audio channels at a maximum bitrate of 640 kbit/s, E-AC-3 supports up to 15 full-bandwidth audio channels at a maximum bitrate of 6.144 Mbit/s.\n\nThe full set of technical specifications for E-AC-3 (and AC-3) are standardized and published in Annex E of ATSC A/52:2012, as well as Annex E of ETSI TS 102 366 V1.2.1 (2008–08), published by the Advanced Television Systems Committee.\n\nDolby Digital Plus is capable of the following:\n\n\nA Dolby Digital Plus service consists of one or more \"substreams\". There are three types of substreams:\n\n\nAll DD+ streams must contain at least one independent substream or legacy substream, which contains the first (or only) 5.1 channels of the primary audio program. Additional independent substreams may be used for secondary audio programs such as foreign language soundtracks, commentary, or descriptions/voiceovers for the visually impaired. Dependent substreams may be provided for programs that have additional soundstage channels beyond 5.1.\n\nWithin each substream, provision is made for encoding five full-bandwidth channels, one low-frequency channel, and one coupling channel. The coupling channel is used for medium-to-high-frequency information which is common to multiple full-bandwidth channels. Its content is mixed in with the other channels in a fashion prescribed by the metadata, it is not reproduced as a discrete channel by the decoder.\n\nDolby Digital Plus includes comprehensive bitstream metadata for decoder control over output loudness (via dialnorm), downmixing, and reversible dynamic range control (via DRC).\n\nDolby Digital Plus is nominally a 16-bit-aligned protocol, though very few fields in the syntax respect any byte or word boundaries. As many syntax elements are optional or variable-length, including some whose presence or length is dependent on complex preceding calculations, and there is little redundancy in the syntax, DD+ can be extremely difficult to parse correctly, with syntactically valid but incorrect parsings easily produced by defective encoders.\n\nA DD+ stream is a collection of fixed-length \"syncframe\" packets, each of which corresponds to either 256, 512, 768, or 1536 consecutive time-domain audio samples. (The 1536-sample case is the most common case, and corresponds to Dolby Digital; the shorter subframe lengths are intended for use in interactive applications like video games where reducing encoder latency is an important concern). Each syncframe is independently decodable, and belongs to a specific substream within the service. A syncframe consists of the following syntax elements (some of which may be elided when a Dolby Digital Plus service is encapsulated into another format or transport):\n\nAt the heart of both Dolby Digital and DD+ is a modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT), which is used to transform the audio signal into the frequency domain; within each block up to 256 frequency coefficients may be transmitted. Coefficients are transmitted in a binary floating-point format, with exponents transmitted separately from mantissas. This allows for highly efficient coding.\n\nExponents for each channel are encoded in a highly packed differential format, with the deltas between consecutive frequency bins (other than the first) being given in the stream. Three formats, or \"exponent strategies\", are used; these are known as \"D15\", \"D25\", and \"D45\". In D15, each bin has a unique exponent, while in D25 and D45, delta values correspond to either pairs or quads of frequency bins. Audio blocks other than the first in a syncframe may additionally reuse the prior block's exponent set (this is required for channels that use the Adaptive Hybrid Transform).\n\nThe decoded exponents, along with a set of metadata parameters, is used to derive the bit allocation pointers (BAPs), which specify the number of bits allocated to each mantissa. Bins which correspond to frequencies in which human hearing is more precise are allocated more bits; bins which correspond to frequencies that humans are less sensitive to are allocated fewer. Anywhere between zero and 16 bits may be allocated for each mantissa; if zero bits are transmitted, a dither function may be optionally applied to generate the frequency coefficient.\n\nDolby Digital Plus, like many lossy audio codecs, uses a heavily quantized frequency-domain representation of the signal to achieve coding gain; this section describes the operation of the base transform as well as various optional \"tools\" specified by the standard, which are used to achieve either greater compression or to reduce audible coding artifacts.\n\nBoth Dolby Digital and DD+ encoder converts a multichannel audio signal to the frequency domain using the modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT), with a switchable block length of either 256 or 512 samples (the latter is used with stationary signals, the former with transient signals). The frequency domain representation is then quantized according to a psycho-acoustic model and transmitted. A floating-point format for frequency coefficients is used, and mantissas and exponents are stored and transmitted separately, with both being heavily compressed.\n\nFor highly stationary signals, such as long notes in musical performance, the Adaptive Hybrid Transform (AHT) is used. This tool is unique to Dolby Digital Plus (and unsupported in Dolby Digital), and uses an additional Type II discrete cosine transform (DCT) to combine six adjacent transform blocks (located within a syncframe) into an effectively longer block. In addition to the two-stage transform, a different bit-allocation structure is used, and two ways of representing encoded mantissas are deployed: use of vector quantization, which gives the highest coding gain, and use of gain-adapted quantization (GAQ) when greater signal-fidelity is required. Gain-adaptive quantization may be independently enabled for each frequency bin within a channel, and permits variable-length mantissa encoding.\n\nAs many multichannel audio programs have high degrees of correlation between individual channels, a coupling channel is typically used. High frequency information which is common among two or more channels is transmitted in a separate channel (one that is not reproduced by a decoder, but only mixed back into the original channels) known as the coupling channel; along with coefficients known as \"coupling coordinates\" that guide the decoder on how to reconstruct the original channels.\n\nDolby Digital Plus supports a more elaborate version of the coupling tool known as Enhanced Coupling (ECPL). This algorithm, which is considerably more expensive to process (both for encoders and decoders) allows phase information to be included in coupling coordinates, allowing for phase relationships between channels that are coupled to be preserved.\n\nDolby Digital Plus provides another tool for high frequencies. As high frequency components are often harmonics of lower-frequency sounds, Spectral Extension (SPX) allows high frequency components to be synthesized algorithmically from lower-frequency components. This tool is also unique to Dolby Digital Plus, and unsupported in Dolby Digital.\n\nStereo programs are typically rematrixed and encoded as an L+R and L-R channel. This is done both to increase coding gain (the L-R channel can typically be heavily compressed, and the subsequent un-matrixing will cause many compression artifacts to cancel), and to preserve phase relationships necessary for proper playback of Dolby Surround-encoded material.\n\nTransient pre-noise processing (TPNP) is a Dolby Digital Plus-specific tool to reduce the resulting artifacts of signal quantization and other compression techniques. Unlike the other tools described above, which operate in the frequency domain and precede the conversion back into PCM samples, TPNP is a tool which essentially performs a windowed cut-and-paste operation on the time-domain signal to erase certain predictable quantization artifacts.\n\nDolby Digital Plus bitstreams are not directly backward compatible with legacy Dolby Digital decoders. However, Dolby Digital Plus is a functional superset of Dolby Digital, and decoders include a mandatory component that directly converts (without decoding and re-encoding) the Dolby Digital Plus bitstream to a Dolby Digital bitstream (operating at 640 kbit/s) for carriage via legacy S/PDIF connections (including S/PDIF over HDMI) to external decoders (e.g. AVRs, etc.). All Dolby Digital Plus decoders can decode Dolby Digital bitstreams.\n\nOne design goal of DD+ is quality playback in a variety of environments, ranging from home theaters and other acoustically controlled environments where high dynamic range playback is feasible, to portable and automotive environments where lots of background noise is present, and dynamic range compression may be necessary to make all parts of an audio program audible.\n\nDD+ provides the following operating modes for different listener/viewer environments.\n\nDolby Digital Plus Decoder Operating Modes:\n\nNote: All of the decoder operating modes (listed above) are available in every Dolby Digital Plus decoder. The default operating mode is governed by device category and application. In some devices, users may also have a choice (via menu) to select an alternate mode that suits their particular taste and/or application.\n\nIn addition, Dolby Digital and DD+ contain additional metadata to permit error-free translation into range-restricted downstream channels, such as RF modulation, where excessive output signal amplitude may result in significant distortion or modulation errors.\n\nIEC 61937-3: defines how to transmit Dolby Digital (AC-3) and Dolby Digital Plus (E-AC-3) bitstreams via an IEC 60958/61937 (S/PDIF) interface. However, the S/PDIF interface has insufficient bandwidth to transport Dolby Digital Plus (E-AC-3) bitstreams at the 3.0Mbit/s datarate specified by HD DVD; lower datarates are possible.\n\nMuch consumer gear, and even some professional gear, does not recognize Dolby Digital Plus as an encoded format, and will treat DD+ signals over a S/PDIF or similar interface, or stored in a .WAV file or similar container format, as though they were linear PCM data. This is not problematic if the data is passed unchanged, but any gain scaling or sample rate conversion, operations which are aurally harmless to PCM data, will corrupt and destroy a Dolby Digital Plus stream. (Older codecs such as DTS or AC-3 are more likely to be recognized as compressed formats and protected from such processing).\n\nDolby Digital Plus may be transmitted across HDMI 1.3 or newer, according to IEC 61937-3.\n\nAs the AES-3 interface is the professional analog to S/PDIF, Dolby Digital Plus streams may be carried over AES-3 connections with sufficient bandwidth, and/or over other interfaces that encapsulate AES-3 (such as SMPTE 259M and SMPTE 299M embedded audio). Additional standards promulgated by SMPTE specify the encoding of Dolby transports, including Dolby Digital, Dolby Digital Plus, and Dolby E (a professional-only codec used in audio/video applications) on an AES interface. The SMPTE 337 standard specifies the signalling and carriage of signals that are not PCM audio over an AES-3 interface, and the SMPTE 340-2008 standard specifies how Dolby Digital Plus and Dolby Digital are to be transmitted over that interface. The combination of SMPTE 340-2008 and 337M allow the Dolby Digital Plus bitstream to be stored and transported within professional production, contribution and distribution workflows prior to emission to consumers.\n\nEither DD+ or Dolby Digital is specified by the Advanced Television Systems Committee as the primary audio codec for the ATSC digital television system, and is commonly used for other DTV applications (such as cable and satellite broadcast) in countries which use ATSC for digital television.\n\nFor broadcast (emission) to consumers, the Dolby Digital Plus bitstream is packetized in an MPEG elementary stream, and multiplexed (with video) into an MPEG Transport Stream. In ATSC systems, the specification for carrying Dolby Digital Plus is described in ATSC A/53 Part 3 & Part 6. In DVB systems, the specification for carrying Dolby Digital Plus is described in ETSI TS 101 154 and ETSI EN 300 468.\n\nDolby Digital Plus is seeing increasing use in digital television systems, particular in cable and satellite systems, as a replacement for Dolby Digital. Many such applications don't take advantage of its higher channel count or ability to support multiple independent programs; instead it is used as a higher-efficiency codec than AC-3.\n\nBoth the now-defunct HD DVD standard, and Blu-ray Disc include Dolby Digital Plus. It is a mandatory component of HD DVD and an optional component of Blu-ray. The maximum number of discrete coded channels is the same for both formats: 7.1. However, HD DVD and Blu-ray impose different technical constraints on the supported audio-codecs. Hence, the usage of DD+ differs substantially between HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc.\nOn HD DVD, DD+ is designated a mandatory audio codec. An HD DVD movie may use DD+ as the primary (or only) audio track. An HD DVD player is required to support DD+ audio by decoding and outputting it to the player's output jacks. As stored on disc, the DD+ bitstream can carry for any number of audio channels up to the maximum allowed, at any bitrate up to 3.0 Mbit/s.\n\nOn Blu-ray Disc, DD+ is an optional codec, and is deployed as an extension to a \"core\" AC-3 5.1 audiotrack. The AC-3 core is encoded at 640 kbit/s, carries 5 primary channels (and 1 LFE), and is independently playable as a movie audio track by any Blu-ray Disc player. The DD+ extension bitstream is used on players that support it by replacing the rear channels in the 5.1 setup with higher fidelity versions, along with providing a possible channel extension to 6.1 or 7.1. The complete audio track is allowed a combined bitrate of 1.7 Mbit/s: 640 kbit/s for the AC-3 5.1 core, and 1 Mbit/s for the DD+ extension. During playback, both the core and extension bitstreams contribute to the final audio-output, according to rules embedded in the bitstream metadata.\n\nGenerally, a Dolby Digital Plus bitstream can only be transported over an HDMI 1.3 or greater link. Older receivers support earlier versions of HDMI, or only have support for the S/PDIF system for digital audio, or analog inputs.\n\nFor non-HDMI 1.3 links, the player can decode the audio and then transmit it via a variety of different methods.\n\nMost receivers and players support S/PDIF. This lower bandwidth digital connection is not capable of transmitting lossless PCM audio with more than two channels, but a player can transmit a S/PDIF compatible audio stream to the receiver in one of the following ways:\n\nShould the player need to decode the audio for a non-HDMI 1.3 receiver, the results should be predictable. The DD+ specification explicitly defines downmixing modes and mechanics, so any source soundfield (up to 14.1) can be reproduced predictably for any listening environment (down to a single channel).\n\n"}

Encouraged by major donors and affiliates, the two organizations merged with the goal of strengthening volunteerism, streamlining costs and services and deepening impact.\n\nThe Points of Light Foundation was created in 1990 as a nonprofit organization in Washington, D.C. to promote the spirit of volunteerism described by U.S. President George H. W. Bush in his 1989 inaugural address, \"I have spoken of a thousand points of light, of all the community organizations that are spread like stars throughout the Nation, doing good.\"\n\nPresident Bush used the \"thousand points of light\" theme frequently, including in his 1991 State of the Union address in which he said:\n\nIn 1991 the National Volunteer Center, which had begun in 1970 as the National Center for Voluntary Action, was merged into it. The merged organization also became known during the 2000s as the Points of Light Foundation and Volunteer Center National Network.\n\nThe Foundation and its expanded network acted as community hubs to connect volunteers to opportunities, work with local nonprofits and businesses to establish and improve volunteer programs, and, overall, bolster the local infrastructure for the volunteering community.\n\nThe Points of Light Foundation received an annual allocation from the Corporation for National and Community Service to manage some of that agency's programs, and administered the President's Volunteer Service Award program, which was created by President George W. Bush in 2003. The group also sponsored conferences, offered training and other assistance to its network of volunteer centers, and recognized volunteers through a Daily Point of Light award.\n\nThe Points of Light Foundation was in fact not a grant-making foundation. It engaged in a variety of tasks, including managing its network of volunteer centers, engaging volunteers in disaster recovery, supporting corporate volunteer councils and more.\n\nAt the same time as the Points of Light Foundation's founding, a group of young professionals in Atlanta started a group to connect volunteers with nonprofit organizations. Michelle Nunn joined this group of co-founders as the first executive director of Hands On Atlanta in 1989. The nonprofit offered a volunteer model with flexible opportunities for people to be involved in their communities through \"hands on\" projects like working in a soup kitchen, food bank or building a house. When the group held its first Hands On Atlanta Day in 1992, around 2,000 people volunteered.\n\nIn 2003, Nunn moved from Hands On Atlanta to become CEO of the national Atlanta-based HandsOn Network to expand the volunteer model to cities around the world.\n\nIn 2007, the Points of Light Foundation began talks with the HandsOn Network to join forces through a merger to make one national organization with local affiliates focused on volunteering and service. They combined forces on August 11, 2007, to become the Points of Light Institute. By late 2011, it changed its name to Points of Light.\n\nPoints of Light has approximately 250 affiliates in 22 countries and partnerships with thousands of nonprofits and companies. In 2012, Points of Light mobilized 4 million volunteers in 30 million hours of service worth $635 million. Points of Light received the highest possible rating (4-stars) on Charity Navigator in 2012, 2011, and 2010.\n\nIn 2013, Nunn took a leave of absence from CEO to pursue an unsuccessful run for Georgia's U.S. Senate seat in 2014. In 2015, Tracy Hoover was named as CEO of Points of Light, with Nunn taking a place on the board of directors.\n\nOn January 10, 1995, the Los Angeles Times published a scathing account of the new foundation, saying \"the lone remnant of the Bush initiative has the look of a wasteful, Washington-dependent operation.\" The article noted the foundation had received $26.6 million in federal funds and had spent $22.3 million \"on glitzy promotions, consultants, salaries, travel and conferences.\" The article said \"only 11 percent of the foundation's budget had been spent to provide grants to volunteer efforts. The foundation has fallen well short of private fund-raising goals and attracted scant scrutiny from Congress.\" In the article, volunteerism expert Susan J. Ellis said, \"There's been tons of money wasted, just wasted... and I don't think they can show a lot of people have volunteered.\"\n\nPresident Bush created the \"Daily Point of Light Award\" in 1989 to recognize ordinary Americans from all walks of life taking direct and consequential voluntary action in their communities to solve serious social problems. The President focused great attention on these individuals and organizations, both to honor them for their work and to call the nation to join them and multiply their efforts. By the end of his administration, President Bush had recognized 1,020 Daily Points of Light representing all fifty states and addressing issues ranging from care for infants and teenagers with AIDS to adult illiteracy and from gang violence to job training for homeless people. The Daily Point of Light continues to be awarded by Points of Light; up until his death, President Bush continued to sign all of the awards.\n\nPresident Bush devoted attention to voluntary service as a means of solving some of America's most serious social problems. In \"The Points of Light Movement: The President's Report to the Nation\", President Bush wrote, \n\nOn July 15, 2013, President Barack Obama welcomed President Bush to the White House to celebrate the 5,000th Daily Point of Light Award. They bestowed the award on Floyd Hammer and Kathy Hamilton of Union, Iowa, for their work founding Outreach, a nonprofit that delivers free meals to hungry children in 15 countries.\n\nDaily Point of Light honorees include:\n\nThe organization manages a number of notable programs including the HandsOn Network, which leads approximately 250 volunteer action centers; generationOn, which helps schools, children and families volunteer in their communities; Community Blueprint, which works with nonprofits to meet the needs of veterans and military families; Billion + Change, which organizes companies to pledge billions of dollars in skills-based volunteer services to nonprofits; and the Civic Accelerator, which invests in civic enterprise start-ups.\n\nThe Extra Mile - Points of Light Volunteer Pathway honors famous volunteers with a series of bronze medallions that form a one-mile walking path, just blocks from the White House in Washington, D.C. There are 33 people recognized, including Booker T. Washington, Jane Addams, John Muir, Clara Barton and Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\nNational Volunteer Week is an annual event designed to thank volunteers for their service and encourage others across the United States to volunteer.\n\nThe HandsOn Network works in partnership with local organizations and schools to create \"hands on\" service projects that produce tangible benefits in communities. The network enlists a corps of hundreds of thousands of volunteers who join forces to address community needs worldwide. The HandsOn Network enables them to choose from a variety of projects that connect community needs with their time and interests. They cultivate and train volunteers to in turn lead other volunteers.\n\nIn 2018, Points of Light worked with Starbucks on a new program. 36 Starbucks employees were selected as Starbucks Service Fellows. For six months, the Fellows worked at least 20 hours per week at Starbucks, and up to 20 hours for a local organization. The program supported employees who wanted to give back to the local community. Points of Light paid the Fellows using a grant from the Starbucks Foundation, which also provided money for the local nonprofits' programs.\n\nPoints of Light paid tribute to President George H.W. Bush and volunteer service on March 21, 2011 at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. Presidents Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush joined President George H.W. Bush to highlight the role volunteer service plays in people's lives. It marked the first time all four former presidents had come together since President Barack Obama's inauguration in January 2009. President Obama was on a trip to South America and taped a video message for the event. The Tribute to the elder Bush — called \"All Together Now: A Celebration of Service\" — featured singers Carrie Underwood, Darius Rucker, and Garth Brooks, and broadcaster Jim Nantz.\n\nOn October 16, 2009, President Obama held a Presidential Forum on Service hosted by former President George H.W. Bush and Points of Light at the George Bush Presidential Library Center on the campus of Texas A&M University. The event celebrated the contributions of more than 4,500 Daily Point of Light award winners and honored President Bush's legacy of service and civic engagement.\n\nAt the Presidential Forum, President Obama said,\n\nSince 1992, leaders from the nonprofit, for-profit, government, Hollywood and military sectors have gathered for Points of Light's annual Conference on Volunteering and Service. In 2012, approximately 5,000 people attended a plenary session featuring former First Lady Barbara Bush, Second Lady Jill Biden, Points of Light CEO Michelle Nunn and actor Kevin Bacon.\n\nMake A Difference Day is the nation's largest day of service, created by \"USA Weekend\" magazine and held in partnership with Points of Light on the fourth Saturday of each October. An estimated 3 million volunteers spent the 22nd Make A Difference Day in 2012 helping their communities in projects ranging from bowl-a-thon fundraisers to beach cleanups.\n\nEach year, Points of Light honors the memory of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. with service projects across the United States as a part of the MLK Day of service. In 2013, Vice President Joe Biden and his family joined 10,000 volunteers at Points of Light's service project at the D.C. Armory to put together 100,000 thank-you \"care kits\" for U.S. military personnel, disabled veterans, and civilian first responders.\n\nIn the USA, the Points of Light Foundation and the Association of Junior Leagues International (AJLI) partnered to convene and lead the International Year of Volunteers 2001 USA Steering Committee. Members of the committee included the National Council of Volunteer Centers, National Council on Workplace Volunteering, Association for Volunteer Administration, National Parents and Teachers Association and Make A Difference Day. The USA's IYV web site, \"www.iyv2001us.org\", was launched in September 2000.\n\nPoints of Light Foundation & HandsOn Network received a \"Fast Company\" Social Capitalist Award in 2008.\n\nA daily Points of Light programme recognising outstanding individual volunteers was developed in partnership with the US programme and launched by Prime Minister David Cameron at 10 Downing Street in April 2014. Since then, the awards have continued under Prime Ministers Theresa May and Boris Johnson, with over 1,300 individuals across the UK recognised.\n\nA Commonwealth Points of Light award series was launched in February 2018 as a continuation of the UK Prime Minister’s Points of Light programme to coincide with the UK hosting the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in London, April 2018. These awards are made by Queen Elizabeth II, as Head of the Commonwealth, to thank inspirational volunteers across the 53 Commonwealth nations for the difference they are making in their communities and beyond.\n\n\n\n"}

It is a part of the Chittagong Division\nand the town of Rangamati serves as the headquarters of the district. Area-wise, Rangamati is the largest district of the country.\n\nRangamati was a contesting ground for the kings of Tripura and Arakan.It was known as Reang/Riang Country before East India Company came.\n\nThe total population is according to 2005 census of which indigenous communities constitute 52% and non-indigenous Bengalis constitute 48%. The number of males is and the females are (Census 2001). The density of population is 83 per square kilometre (Census 2001). The number of household is having the household size 4.8 (Census 2001). The total population is divided into Bangalees and indigenous communities (ethnic minorities): Chakma, Marma, Tanchangya, indigenous Assamese people, Keot(Kaibarta), Tripura, Pankua, Lushai, Khiang, Murang, Rakhine, Chak, Bowm, Khumi.\n\nAs per 1991 census, the religious break up of the population of the district were: Buddhist 53.83%, Muslim 39.28%, Hindu 5.62% and Christian 1.12%. Religious institutions Pagoda 1230, Mosque 1059, Temple 65, Church 16. Genderwise, male constituted 53.59% and female constituted 46.41% of the population.\n\nAs per the 2011 census, there were a total of 386,153 indigenous people in the district (64.79%).\n\nRangamati is located in the Chittagong Division. It is bordered by the Tripura state of India to the north, Bandarban District to the south, Mizoram State of India and Chin State of Myanmar to the east, and Khagrachari and Chittagong Districts to the west. Rangamati is the only district in Bangladesh with international borders with two countries: India and Myanmar.\n\nThe area of the district is 6116 km of which 1292 km is riverine and 4825 km is under forest vegetation.\n\nDistrict Administration is the apex office of a district at the present context of administrative setting of Bangladesh. It is the management of affairs within a district, which is the basic territorial unit of administration in the country. It is at this level that the common man comes into direct contact with the administration. The district falls under the charge of a district officer, called either Deputy Commissioner or District Collector or District Magistrate. This officer acts as the representative of the central government at this level. Like other district administrations of the country, District Administration Rangamati, widely known as the Office of the deputy commissioner is the representative of the cabinet in the Rangamati Hill District.\n\n\nThere are 291 government primary schools, 120 non-government primary schools, 22 junior schools, 6 government high schools, 45 non-government high schools, 2 government colleges, 13 non-government colleges, 61 madrasa, 7 technical schools, Rangamati Medical College and Rangamati Science and Technology University located throughout the district.\n\nThe district of Rangamati consists of 10 upazilas, 1 municipality (9 wards and 35 \"mahallas\"), 50 union parishads, 162 mouzas and 1347 villages.\n\nThe economy of Rangamati is hugely dependent on agriculture with a total of 41.94% of the population employed there. Other occupational percentages are: agricultural labourer 12.06%, wage labourer 4.95%, commerce 8.22%, service 13.04%, fishing 2.02%, industry 4.57%, forestry 3.2% and others 10%. A grand total of 12275 hectares of land is used for cultivation, producing food and non food crops such as rice, potato, corn, mustard seed, cotton and jute among others. Fruits such as mango, jackfruit, banana, pineapple, litchi, black berry are also grown in Rangmati.\n\nNotable cottage industries of Rangamati are weaving, blacksmithing and wood work. Weaving is particularly famous for their woolen and jute rugs and hand loom cloth. Major industries include Chandraghona paper and rayon mill, Plywood Factory, Ghagra Textile and a Satellite Station at Betbunia amongst many others, producing and exporting goods.\n\nKaptai Lake is a man made lake in south-eastern Bangladesh. It is located in the Kaptai Upazila under Rangamati District of Chittagong Division. The lake was created as a result of building the Kaptai Dam on the Karnaphuli River, as part of the Karnaphuli Hydro-electric project. The Kaptai Lake's average depth is 100 feet (30 m) and maximum depth is 490 feet (150 m). This lake was developed by inundating valleys and plain lands between lots of hills.\n\nIn Bengali the name of the Hanging Bridge is Jhulonto Bridge and this is also popular to its visitors. This hanging bridge is established on Kaptai Lake. This is the link way of Kaptai Lake. The total height of this bridge is 335 feet and is the landmark icon of Rangamati.\n\nKaptai National Park cascades between the Karnaphuly and Kaptai Mountain assortments. It was conventional in 1999 and its area is . Prior to announcement of the national park it was Sitapahar Reserve. It is about 57 kilometre from Chittagong city. In this park one can find plenty of old trees which were planted in 1873. In Kaptai National Park, there is various wildlife such as deer, jungle cat, elephant, monkey, etc. Many species of birds may also be of interest to tourists and bird lovers. Kaptai National Park is a safe and sanctuary for birds and other wildlife. The Forest Division founded picnic spots, and restaurants in this park.\n\nShuvolong a place in Barkol sub district, located about 25 kilometres (11 kilometres as the crow flies) away from Rangamati town. There are few waterfalls in Shuvolong area with the largest one falling from as high as 300 feet. In the past several years, this place has turned into a tourist destination due to its waterfalls and nearby market. Shuvolong is accessible by speed boat or motor boats from Rangamati.\n\nSajek is a union at Baghaichari Upazila in Rangamati districts. Basically it is name of a river which separates Bangladesh from India. The river flows into the Karnafuli River in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. Sajek Valley is situated in the North angle of Rangamati, near the Mizoram border boundary area. The valley is 1,800 ft high form sea level. Many small rivers flow through the hills - including the rivers Kachalon and Machalong. The main ethnic minorities on the valley are Chakma, Marma, Tripura, Pankua, Lushai. Marishsha is a name of a place near Sajek Valley. Most of the houses are made with bamboo. There is another place near Sajek, it is Kanlak, and it is known for its orange orchard.\n\nMost attractions of the spot are sun set, rain, morning, evening, and night and aborigine people. Tourists can buy indigenous peoples' products from haat (markets). Roads are like big snake spirals on the mountains. Most of the people are Buddhist and others are Christian here. A new road has been built up to the Ruilui Para by the guidance of Bangladesh army. On the way traveller need to take permission from the army camp. Bangladesh army is very helpful and cooperative. Now mobile network is available here. The valley is in Rangamati but tourists can reach there from Khagrachhari too. The route is Khagrachhori – Dighinala Bazaar – Bagaihat Bazaar – Machalong Haat – then Sajek. It is 62 km from Khagrachhari. Dighinala to Sajek is 40 km. Main transportation is Chander Gari.\n\n"}

She was named for Levi Woodbury.\n\n\"Woodbury\" was laid down on 3 October 1918 at San Francisco, California, by the Union Iron Works plant of the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation; launched on 6 February 1919; sponsored by Miss Catherine Muhlenberg Chapin, the daughter of newspaper publisher W. W. Chapin; reclassified DD-309 on 17 July 1920; and commissioned at the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California, on 20 October 1920, Lieutenant Commander Frank L. Lowe in command.\n\n\"Woodbury\" departed San Francisco on 22 November and reached San Diego, her assigned home port, the following day. \"Woodbury\" moored at the Reserve Docks, where she remained into 1921. The destroyer, like many of her numerous sisters begun during World War I, had entered service at a time when the post-war cutbacks in funds and personnel had seriously curtailed American peacetime naval operations. Accordingly, she was placed in a \"rotating reserve\" established by the Navy to maintain a \"force in readiness.\" In operation, the system required that one-third of a given force remain pierside, maintained by only the minimum number of officers and men, while another third was to be half-manned as it remained berthed at a buoy in the harbor. The last third was fully manned and remained at buoys in the harbor but for periodic operations underway at sea.\n\n\"Woodbury\" departed her mooring at the Reserve Docks on 1 February 1921 and, over the next few days, conducted torpedo practices and made a speed run off the southern California coast. During that brief underway period, the destroyer conducted her operations during the day and returned to her mooring buoy in the evenings. She remained largely port-bound from March to May, but moved to San Pedro, California, on 14 June. There, her crew assisted in preservation and maintenance work on while she lay in drydock at the Los Angeles Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company, San Pedro. \"Woodbury\" then underwent a drydocking herself for the application of anti-corrosive and antifouling paint to her bottom. \"Woodbury\" later returned to San Diego and, but for a run, via Los Angeles harbor, to Seattle, Washington, stayed there for the remainder of 1921.\n\nUnderway on the morning of 14 January 1922, \"Woodbury\" led , , and to sea. She arrived off Goat Island, near San Francisco, at 0820 the following day and lay to, embarking passengers for transportation to the Puget Sound Navy Yard, Bremerton, Washington, before she resumed her cruise up the Pacific coast. The destroyer reached Puget Sound on the afternoon of the 18th, discharged her passengers, and soon commenced her scheduled overhaul.\n\n\"Woodbury\" remained at Puget Sound through March 1922. She got underway for San Diego on 3 April but put into Port Angeles, Washington, when \"Nicholas\" developed a machinery casualty. Upon completion of \"Nicholas\"' repairs, \"Woodbury\" resumed her passage southward and reached San Diego on 8 April.\n\nThe destroyer lay at berth 35, San Diego harbor, into the summer, again as part of the inactive arm of the \"rotating reserve.\" From early July to late September, \"Woodbury\" provided essential maintenance and upkeep services to her sister ships in the decommissioned Destroyer Division 17 moored alongside. There were only two breaks in the ship's routine during that time: a tender upkeep period alongside and her participation in the funeral of the late Rear Admiral Uriel Sebree, USN (Ret.), on 8 August, for which she sent a party ashore to form part of the naval escort for the casket.\n\n\"Woodbury\" got underway on 26 September 1922 and conducted gunnery exercises in company with \"Young\" and \"Nicholas\". After another period of upkeep alongside \"Melville\", the destroyer participated in an intensive slate of gunnery and torpedo drills. Then, late in October, she also performed torpedo recovery chores for the battleships and .\n\nAfter spending the remainder of 1922 in San Diego waters, \"Woodbury\" stood out of San Diego harbor on 6 February 1923, in company with Destroyer Squadrons 11 and 12 and the tender \"Melville\", all ships bound for Mexico, and, ultimately, for Panama. Arriving at Magdalena Bay on the 8th, \"Woodbury\" refueled from before she pushed on for Panamanian waters on the 11th. That afternoon, she rendezvoused with the dreadnoughts of Battleship Divisions 3, 4, and 5 and conducted exercises with them en route to Panama.\n\nOver the ensuing weeks, \"Woodbury\" took part in the first of the Navy's large scale fleet maneuvers, Fleet Problem I. Held in the vicinity of the strategic Panama Canal Zone, Fleet Problem I was designed to ascertain the defensive condition of that waterway, to allow for the formulation of the \"estimate of the situation,\" and to facilitate the study of war plans. \"Woodbury\" took part in the exercises as part of the \"attacking\" forces built around the Battle Fleet. The opposing forces consisted of the Scouting Fleet, augmented by a division of battleships.\n\nDuring one phase of the operation, while the ships lay anchored at Panama Bay, — bearing the Secretary of the Navy, Edwin C. Denby, and the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Robert E. Coontz - stood through the fleet. Later, \"Woodbury\" resumed her operations with the Battle Fleet — conducting gunnery drills, antisubmarine screening, protective screening for the battleships — and serving as a target for Battleship Division 4 during its long-range battle practices.\n\nReturning to San Diego on 11 April, \"Woodbury\" remained there into the summer. Departing her home port on 25 June, however, she sailed for the Pacific Northwest and reached Tacoma, Washington, via San Francisco, on 2 July. There, her landing force participated in the Independence Day parade at Tacoma.\n\n\"Woodbury\" departed Tacoma on 9 July and reached Port Angeles the same day. For nearly two weeks, the destroyer operated out of that port, conducting exercises, tactical maneuvers, and short range battle practices. After that stint of operations, she shifted to Bellingham, Wash., and, later, to Seattle.\n\nUnderway at 0405 on 27 July, \"Woodbury\" departed the fleet's anchorage off Admiralty Head, near Seattle, in company with Destroyer Divisions 32 and 33 to escort \"Henderson\" in which the President of the United States, Warren G. Harding, was embarked. \"Woodbury\" consequently formed part of the presidential escort as the transport sailed through the fleet.\n\nOnce her duties in connection with the Presidential review were completed, \"Woodbury\" returned to the routine of exercises, acting as a target for the gunnery drills carried out by Battleship Division 4. She later conducted tactical exercises while screening the battleships of that division, before she put in at Lake Washington, via the Lake Washington Ship Canal, on 4 August. She remained there for a little over a week before she got underway on the 13th for Port Townsend.\n\nAfter torpedo-firing and gunnery evolutions out of Port Townsend in company with \"William Jones\", \"Woodbury\" got underway for Keyport, Washington, en route back to Seattle and Puget Sound. Reaching the navy yard on the 20th, she embarked the Commander in Chief, United States Fleet (CinCUS), Admiral Robert E. Coontz, his staff, and a party of congressmen at 0840 on the 22nd. With the CinCUS' four-starred flag at her main, \"Woodbury\" cast off from Pier 5, Puget Sound Navy Yard, and sailed for Keyport. There, Admiral Coontz disembarked with his staff and the congressmen and inspected the naval torpedo station.\n\nThe admiral and his party then reembarked in the destroyer, and she returned them to the navy yard, where they left the ship at 1110. At noon, however, the CinCUS returned on board. \"Woodbury\" subsequently arrived at Seattle's Bell Street Dock at 1310 and disembarked the admiral. The next day, the destroyer carried Admiral Coontz to his flagship, the armored cruiser . Over the ensuing days, \"Woodbury\" also carried, as passengers, Rear Admiral William C. Cole, chief of staff for the CinCUS, and Rear Admiral Luther E. Gregory, CEC, the Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks.\n\nAfter completing her tour in the waters off the Pacific Northwest coast of the United States, \"Woodbury\" departed Port Angeles and headed south. She conducted tactical maneuvers and exercises with battleships en route and stood into San Francisco Bay on 31 August.\n\n\"Woodbury\" remained at San Francisco for a week. She got underway on the morning of 8 September 1923 with other destroyers of Squadron 11, bound for San Diego, and while skirting the coast over the ensuing hours, conducted tactical exercises and maneuvers. In addition, the ships were making a speed run.\n\nLed by the leader, , the squadron steamed into the worsening weather. Later that evening, \"Delphy\" - basing her movements on an inaccurate navigational bearing - made a fateful turn, believing she was heading into the Santa Barbara Channel. In fact, she was headed, as were all of the ships astern of her in follow-the-leader fashion, for jagged rock pinnacles and reefs off Point Arguello.\n\nShortly after 2105, tragedy struck Squadron 11's ships, one by one in the Honda Point Disaster. Seven ships, led by \"Delphy\" and including \"Woodbury\", ran hard aground. Some of the destroyers farther astern saw what was happening and managed to avoid disaster by quick-thinking seamanship.\n\n\"Woodbury\" came to rest alongside a small island— later nicknamed \"\"Woodbury\" Rock\"—that she used as a permanent anchor. Volunteers took across four lines and rigged them across the gap of tumbling surf between the destroyer and the rock that would later bear her name. Meanwhile, although water was pouring into the forward boiler room and engine room spaces, Commander Louis P. Davis, the ship's commanding officer, ordered full speed astern. Ensign Horatio Ridout, the engineer officer, and his men worked to try to produce the horsepower necessary to get the ship out of her predicament but their efforts were brought to nought when all power failed, due to the flooding, at 2230.\n\nAs the floodwaters below engulfed and drowned out her power supply and it became impossible to move the ship, Cmdr. Davis turned to his reserve plan. While \"Woodbury\" settled astern, waves struck her with some force, causing her bow to rise and fall rhythmically. The hawsers tenuously connecting the ship with \"\"Woodbury\" Rock\" stretched taut and then sagged with the movement of ship and sea. Nevertheless, one by one, \"Woodbury's\" crew clambered across the chasm, monkey-fashion, in a well-organized operation to abandon ship. Later, men from the stranded sister ship also reached \"\"Woodbury\" Rock.\"\n\nUltimately, all of \"Woodbury's\" crew reached safety, some taken off to by the fishing boat \"Bueno Amor de Roma\", under the command of a Captain Noceti. The rough log entry for \"Woodbury\", dated 9 September 1923, sums up the ship's status as of that date: \"\"Woodbury\" on rocks off Point Arguello, California, abandoned by all hands and under supervision of a salvage party composed of men from various 11th squadron ships.\"\n\nOfficially placed out of commission on 26 October 1923, the ship was struck from the Navy list on 20 November of the same year. She was simultaneously ordered sold as a hulk, but a subsequent sale, on 6 February 1924 to a Santa Monica, California-based salvage firm, the Fryn Salvage Company, was never consummated. Yet another sale, to a Robert J. Smith of Oakland, California, is recorded as having been awarded on 19 October 1925, but whether or not the hulk was scrapped is not recorded. However she, and her wrecked sister ships, were still not moved by late August 1929 for she, and most of the others, may be clearly seen in film footage taken from the German airship \"Graf Zeppelin\" as she headed towards Los Angeles on her circumnavigation of the globe; the film footage is used in the documentary film Farewell (2009).\n\n"}

{"id": "2155900", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2155900", "title": "Maasin", "text": "Maasin\n\n', officially the ' (; ), or simply referred to as Maasin City, is a and capital of the province of , . According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIt has 70 barangays and located on the western part of the province with land area of .\n\nMaasin City is the commercial and religious center of Southern Leyte and the south-western part of Leyte Island. On August 10, 2000, Maasin was converted into a city. The Diocese of Maasin was founded on August 14, 1968.\n\nIn 1521, a Portuguese-born Spanish explorer and navigator, Ferdinand Magellan and his crew came ashore and celebrated the first Roman Catholic Mass on the island. Magellan made peace with two Filipino rulers, Rajah Kolambu and Rajah Siani who subsequently were converted to Christianity. A marker notes the spot on Limasawa where their blood compact of friendship and alliance was sealed.\n\nSouthern Leyte, for centuries, was actually an integral part of the island of Leyte. During the Spanish period, the region was sparsely populated. Continued Moro slave raiding discouraged the establishment and stabilization of other large towns. In the 19th century, immigration from the provinces of Cebu and Bohol increased the population of the region and opened the land towards farming.\n\nOne of the oldest towns in Southern Leyte is Maasin, nowadays called Maasin City. Little is known about its pre-Spanish existence. When the Spanish missionaries became active in their missions, they discovered that the Maasin community was already organized, with its people friendly and interested in embracing the Catholic faith. The community was formally established as a parish by the missionaries of the Society of Jesus in the 1700s and was called \"nipa\". This was authenticated by a piece of stone from a long destroyed convent that bears the inscription: \"Pa. De Tagnipa - año 1776.\"\n\nThe renaming of the town of Maasin is related to the incident when some Spaniards, who needed drinking water, scanned the shorelines and found Canturing River. They asked the natives in Castillan Spanish while gesturing towards the river, \"Que pueblo es este?\" Without hesitation, the natives answered \"Maasin\" (meaning salty), thinking that the Spaniards were asking them how the water tasted. From that time on, the place has been called Maasin.\n\nThe town grew rapidly in the 1700s after the Jesuit priests built the first church of which ruins still exists today between the two districts of Abgao and Mantahan. The Jesuit administration prevailed from 1700 through 1768. Subsequently, Augustinian fathers took over the parish from 1768 to 1843 during which the townspeople, with the guidance of the Spanish ecclesiastical authorities, built the town's second concrete church located approximately one kilometer away from the ruins of the first one. The church stands to this day; although it underwent several repairs and renovations on account of damage wrought by the forces of nature and man-made events. In 1843, Franciscan missionaries took over the parish and managed it until 1896 when they were forced to abandon it due to the revolution. A native clergy took over there after.\n\nDuring the Spanish regime, Maasin evolved and became an organized municipality. It became a busy seaport which maintained trading with nearby islands of Cebu, Bohol, and Mindanao. A historical proof of this account is a document that depicts a record of \"gobernacillos\" in this municipality in 1880 through 1894. By virtue of the Maura Code passed by the Spanish Cortez, the first chosen local executive was changed from Gobernadorcillo to \"Capitan Municipal\". The last gobernadorcillo was Alejo Alcantara who served from 1892 to 1894, followed by Capitanes Municipal Julio Raagas (1894-1896) and Flaviano Aguilar (1897-1898).\n\nThe short-lived Philippine revolution against Spain brought about a change in the local government. During the early part of 1898, General Lukban came to Maasin to install the municipal government under the short-lived Philippine Republic. Even before the fall of the Spaniards to the Americans on August 13, 1898, there had already been established in Maasin a Court of First Instance; the office of \"Promoter Fiscal\" (equivalent to the Provincial Fiscal); and, the office of \"Administrador de Hacienda\" (equivalent to Provincial Treasurer). With the change of sovereign power, the positions were abolished but the Fiscal's which continued to serve cases from distant towns. However, due to the problems emanating from transportation availability for the Tacloban-Maasin span, and the intricate management of governmental affairs in Tacloban, several prominent leaders of the west coast of Leyte began proposing bills that entail the division of the island of Leyte into two distinct provinces.\n\nIn 1919, Representative Ciriaco K. Kangleon presented the first bill but lost in the Senate by one vote.\n\nIn 1922, Tomas Oppus renewed the move with presentation of House Bill No. 254 which became Act No. 3117. Unfortunately, the Act did not take effect because it was not proclaimed by the Governor-General.\n\nThe arrival of the Americans at the beginning of the 20th century and the suppression of all resistance to the American rule stopped all dreams of Philippine independence. However, the epoch-making announcement of President McKinley that the Philippines was not theirs to exploit but to train in the art of self-government and independence brought about new hope for the Filipinos. True to their word, the Americans instituted in this country their democratic institutions. Maasin was one of the beneficiaries of this enlightened American policy. Schools were established; businesses began to rise and prosper; and, Maasin became the most progressive town in south-western Leyte (and still is). Maasin was enjoying the blessings of democracy up until the eruption of World War II.\n\nOn June 3, 1942, the Japanese occupied Maasin and immediately instituted Martial Law. Many townspeople realized that their immediate task was to live and escape the abuses, atrocities, and murderous acts of the Japanese soldiers. They took refuge at the mountains and hills where they lived on the natural provisions of Mother Nature. Many brave ones, including Colonel Ruperto Kangleon, Alfonso Cobile and others, fought the Japanese invaders making the record of the Maasin guerillas one glorious chapter in Maasin history.\n\nMaasin resumed its path to prosperity when the Americans returned in late 1944. It became, once again, a bustling seacoast town trading with the nearby islands of Cebu, Bohol, and Mindanao. Through the initiatives of its leaders, Maasin progressively continued to move forward in its role as the center of commerce and industry in Southern Leyte.\n\nIn 1953, Francisco M. Pajao won the re-presentation of the issue that entails the division of the island of Leyte but could not do anything else to complete the move. Hence, Senator Ruperto K. Kangleon, younger brother of Ciriaco K. Kangleon, presented and passed the move under Senate Bill No. 2140. The House of Representatives carpeted the Bill.\n\nThen in 1957, Congressman Nicanor Espina Yniguez, Jr. filed the House Bill that changed the move's original designation as Western Leyte of Occidental Leyte to \"Southern Leyte\". At 10:00 AM on Friday, May 22, 1959, President Carlos P. Garcia signed the Bill into law as Republic Act No. 2227. Witnesses to the signing, among others, were Congressman Yniguez, Mayor Alfredo K. Bantug of Maasin, Attorney Manuel Enage, Sr., Erlinda Capili, and Attorney Floro Kangleon.\n\nOn July 1, 1960, Southern Leyte was officially inaugurated as a province with municipalities including Maasin (being the capital town and seat of the provincial government), Malitbog, Bontoc, Sogod, Libagon, Pintuyan, San Francisco, St. Bernard, Cabalian (now San Juan), Anahawan, Hinundayan, Hinunangan, and Silago. Three more municipalities were subsequently created, namely, San Ricardo (from Pintuyan), Tomas Oppus (from Malitbog), and Limasawa (from Padre Burgos).\n\nMaasin continued to progressively prosper for decades. On April 8, 1998, Congressman Aniceto G. Saludo, Jr. filed a move under House Bill No. 7201 to convert the municipality of Maasin into a component city of the province of Southern Leyte, thus becoming Maasin City.\n\nMaasin City is politically subdivided into 70 barangays.\n\nMaasinhons and Southern Leyteños speak Cebuano. Their cultural and linguistic affinities tend to differentiate them from those who reside in Cebu, Bohol, and the western coast of the province of Leyte. Most of the people are farmers and fishermen who are noted for their hard work and frugality.\n\nAlthough approximately 50% of the people are adherents of the Roman Catholic Church and the others called themselves the believer of true GOD, traditional folk beliefs and superstition still influence some of them. Some farmers are also known to hold on to pre-and conservative beliefs in making offerings and sacrifices before planting season starts. At times, chickens or pigs are ritually offered in hopes of enticing spirits for a fruitful harvest.\n\nThe terrain of Southern Leyte is characterized by relatively flat lands along the coastal plains where population areas lay, and becomes rugged and mountainous towards the interior. It has numerous small rivers in addition to, at least, eleven major rivers which include Canturing River in Maasin City, Amparo River in Macrohon, Divisoria River in Bontoc, Subang Daku in Sogod, Lawigan and Hitongao Rivers in St. Bernard, Camugao River in Hinundayan, Magcasa River in San Juan, Das-ay and Pondol Rivers in Hinunangan, and Maag River in Silago.\n\nEven though March–May is considered hot and dry with temperatures ranging from 22-32 °C, in general terms, the province actually has no dry season. This is due to rainfall more or less, distributed throughout the year. June to October is mostly rainy; whereas, November to February is cool with temperatures ranging from 22-28 °C. Year round, average humidity is about 76%.\n\nThe existing road networks criss-crossing Southern Leyte consists of major arterial highways that link to the province of Leyte, passing through two major outlets - on the western part, the Maasin-Mahaplag-Baybay route; and, on the central part, the Mahaplag-Sogod route via the Maharlika Highway.\n\nThe province has one existing airstrip located in Panan-awan, Maasin City. This airstrip, which has a runway length of 1200 meters and a width of 30 meters, is simply considered a feeder landing pad. There are regular scheduled flights between Cebu and Maasin and Tagbilaran to Maasin via Air Juan (AO). The runway is suspected to be incapable of supporting aircraft weighing over 12,000 pounds. Controversies of the construction of the airport was found by COA, that lead Damian Mercado dismissed to his position.\n\nWeesam Express fast ferry from Maasin National Port to Cebu takes three hours, 9:00AM daily .\nCokaliong Shipping 'Roll-on' ships make four trips weekly each way, with a sailing time between five and seven hours. Cokaliong ships also carry cargo and vehicles.\nCargo ships regularly make use of Maasin National Port mainly bringing in cement and taking out copra.\n\nThere are five designated bus terminals in Southern Leyte: Maasin, Liloan, Sogod, Hinunangan, and Silago. These terminals are just open spaces used by buses as parking/passenger waiting areas, and not equipped with buildings and other facilities.\n\nThere are at least four bus companies taking the Manila-Maasin route: Philtranco, DLTB, Ultrabus, and CUL. Bachelor takes the Ormoc-Maasin-Davao route.\n\nFrom the Maasin City, by land, it takes approximately five hours to travel to Tacloban City; twenty three hours to Pasay City or Quezon City; and, nineteen hours to Davao City via Liloan ferry boat.\n\nThe principal source of power / electricity in Southern Leyte is the Tonongan Geothermal Power Plant in Ormoc via National Power Corporation through the Southern Leyte Electric Cooperative (SOLECO). The major power transmission lines in the province emanate from 69 kV Tolosa, Leyte which is connected to 69 kV Bontoc, Southern Leyte then to Maasin City, and 69 kV Baybay, Leyte to Maasin City in case of power failure.\n\nA mini-hydro electric power plant in Hinabian, Catmon, St. Bernard was developed with a capacity of 810 KW to serve the Pacific towns particularly St. Bernard and San Juan.\n\nA major breakthrough in power generation is the Southern Leyte Geothermal Project in San Juan with a capacity of 50-100 megawatts commissioning in year 2003. It is anticipated to sustain an estimated economic life of 25 years. Activities involving Pre-operation Phase was already initiated.\n\nPostal communication system is the major means of communication in all municipalities of the province. There are five telephone exchange companies operating in the province to provide domestic and international calls namely PLDT, PT&T, RCPI/Bayan Tel, Evtelco, and the Bureau of Telecommunications (Butel); two AM radio stations - DYSL in Sogod, and DYDM in Maasin City. Other modes of communication include SSB radios for government offices, and cellular phones for government and private entities. TV5, GMA Network and ABS-CBN operate upcoming TV station in the city.\n\nIn 1996, the health and medical needs of the province were provided by eight government hospitals, six private hospitals and clinics, twenty rural health units or municipal centers, ninety three health stations, and ten outpatient private clinics. The total bed capacity of government hospitals is 265 while that of the private is 110. A current tally of health facilities in the province is still being determined.\n\nMaasin City also knowned to be the no-smoking capital city in Eastern Visayas.\n\nOn August 14, 1968, the Diocese of Maasin was canonically erected through a papal decree issued March 23, 1968. In June of the same year, the Most Reverend Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. who was up to then a parish priest of Masbate, Masbate, was appointed as its first bishop. He was consecrated on August 8, 1968, and installed as the First Bishop of Maasin on August 14 at Our Lady of Assumption Parish Church in Maasin, the capital of Southern Leyte.\n\nFrom 1595 to 1910, the area which now comprises the Diocese of Maasin belonged to the diocese of Cebu. From 1910 to 1937 it belonged to the Diocese of Calbayog. From 1937 to 1968 it came under the jurisdiction of the Diocesan of Palo in Leyte. Today it is a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Cebu.\n\nThe diocese comprises the entire province of Southern Leyte, and the towns of Matalom, Bato, Hilongos, Hindang, Inopacan and Baybay in the province of Leyte, with the Maasin Parish Cathedral as the seat of the diocese. Distributed within its 2,505 square kilometers of land are 38 parishes and 1 quasi-parish. To facilitate administration these parishes have been grouped under 6 vicariates.\n\nIn recent years, awareness of their potent role in the local church has been perceived among the lay faithful – a result of diocesan programs designed to awaken the \"sleeping giant\" in the church. There has been a marked increase in the number of lay ministers to assist priests in every parish, as there has been in the number of volunteer catechists.\n\nThe Diocese of Maasin today has started to focus on the vision of the Second Plenary Council of the Philippines. Apart from the usual ministerial and sacramental functions, the clergy has succeeded to penetrate the people's conscience with concern for other issues, such as reforestation, among others.\n\nThe Social Action Center has generously offered help in livelihood projects to those who do not have the necessary capital. This has been successful in the abaca business enterprise. The Center is now in the process of opening up more opportunities for more livelihood projects.\n\nThe Commission on Youth is helping in the formation of the youth in all the parishes of the diocese through youth encounters and leadership training. It has organized three diocesan summer youth camps between 1993 and 1995, attended by more than a thousand delegates.\n\nIn 1993 the Diocese of Maasin marked its 25th anniversary as a diocese.\n\nMaasin Cathedral built in the 17th century is probably not only the biggest, but also the oldest church in Maasin City. It is a diocesan seat since 1968. The church is adorned or embellished with an ornate altar and images of saints, and became a testament to the religious devotion of the people of Southern Leyte.\n\nDon Anatalio Gaviola Plaza, which is dedicated to a then Mayor of Maasin. It still is one of the highly recommended stumping points for tourists as well as for locals.\n\nThe Guinsohotan Cave is a large cave, 15 km from the city center and 276 meters above sea level. Those who do enter the cave by wading or swimming can find small “in-cave” waterfalls, bats and impressive rock formations.\n\nCagnituan Lagoon, the water coming out of Guinsohotan Cave flows down in cascades to form a natural lagoon frequently visited by bathers and patrons of cool therapeutic treatment.\n\nThe two sights (Guinsohotan Cave and Cagnituan Lagoon), which belong more or less together, are placed in Barangay Canitoan and can be reached from Barangay Maria Clara by using a Habal-habal. The last part of the way is a walking part: you pass by small groups of houses, fields and palms. In the background there are the mountains covered by large vegetation.\n\nCamp Danao Forest Park is located 335 m. above sea level and 15 km away from the city proper and the sprawling forested area has a man-made lake. It hosted the 2010 BSP (Boy Scout of the Philippines) National Activity. It is also known as the Maasin City Forest Park and played host to the 2010 Boy Scouts of the Philippines National Activity. It is a good destination for those traveling with children because different animals can be seen in the zoo, such as tigers, crocodiles, lions, camels, snakes, monkeys, and several types of birds.\n\nMaasin Zoo and Adventure Park (soft-opening in early 2012). One of the specialties of this zoo will be that the animals will not be kept in cages but be separated from the spectator by “natural” barricades.\n\nBogo Bird Paradise (private owned), just about 4 km from the city proper is a mountain retreat nestled among flora, fauna and especially rare species of bird.\n\nBusay Falls, where you can find lush vegetation just as well as wildlife cavorting with cascading mountain waterfalls and chirping birds. It can be found in Barangay Combado. \nSadly, this former completely wild and dreamlike part of nature is victim of fast economic expansion, so water quality is not as good as years ago and the former wild lagoon was removed by a pool.\n\nAbiera Museo d’Art, another sight in Maasin City, showing a rare collection of artifacts, antiques, paintings, preserved animals, coins, gems, and historical relics. Although it is privately owned by the Abiera Family, it can be visited by interested ones. It is located in Barangay Tunga-tunga in the heart of the city.\n\nThe Lady of Assumption at the Jalleca Hills is the tallest privately owned shrine in the Philippines. The statue itself and the nearby chapel can be reached by using a stairway with more than 300 steps and is located at 104 m above sea level in Barangay Mantahan. It is one of the most visited religious landmarks in Maasin City and in Southern Leyte. This impressive landmark can be seen from far not only during daytime, but also at night as it is illuminated.\n\nSan Francisco Javier Pilgrims Center, a miraculous chapel 400 meters above sea level which can be found in Barangay Hanginan, 7 km from the city proper. It can be reached by an hour-long trek to the top through a foliage of trees and wild shrubs. It is said that every petition is granted and every prayer spoken is answered.\n\nMonte Cueva Shrine, also known as the Shrine of Our Lady of the Assumption and the Most Precious Blood of Jesus, is a donation by the philanthropists Odong and Loring Chung to the Diocese of Maasin. It offers a refuge to pilgrims and devotees. A 30-foot Marian icon perches from a highland over the Via Crucis and Resurrection. A cathedral within the cave is the coup-de-grace to the natural wonder, situated 2 km from Maasin City.\n\nTransit Bus Companies:\nShipping Companies:\n\n\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe town is home to the Bontoc Campus of the Southern Leyte State University, which offers agricultural and industrial courses.\n\nThe town celebrates their fiesta in honor of the Holy Child Jesus. The Ulang Festival, held annually on January 15, is celebrated by colorful participants dancing in honor of the icon of the Señor Santo Niño (Holy Child Jesus). Some devotees to the Señor Santo Niño said that it can performed miracles that can heal sickness of those who touches the said icon.\n\nThe town is situated on a long stretch of rich alluvial plain, which considered as the greatest farming region in the entire Sogod Bay District, and is drained by the Salog and Divisoria Rivers. Because of its rich soil, there is much rice farming. The town is also the producer of abaca, copra and tobacco in the Bay District.\n\nBontoc is politically subdivided into 40 barangays.\n\nThe name “Bontoc” is derived from an old creek called Bontoc creek near the present Roman Catholic Cemetery where old “pueblo” called Daan Lungsod existed during the early Spanish regime.\n\nBefore the coming of the Spaniards, Bontoc was a wilderness where few natives lived and wild animals roamed. When the Spaniards came, they found scattered warring tribes of primitive Malays who settled in prosperous villages near the mouth and along the fertile plains of the historic Salog river basin. They then successfully subjugated these warring tribes and immigrants and founded a cluster of villages which later on formed the nucleus of the Barrio of Bontoc.\n\nAs far as history could recall the most popular among the ancient warring chiefs, was Mariano Barcelon who was nicknamed as “Tahug”. He was acclaimed to be the bravest of the braves. His name was a terror to the Moro pirates that swarmed Philippine waters during the 16th century.\n\nDuring the Spanish time up to the early part of the American regime, Bontoc was ruled by a succession of native “Cabezas de barangay”, a unit government organization during that time. Bontoc was at that time a tributary “pueblo” belonging to the old town of Libagon which governed the people for many years both in civil and religious matter by a line of “capitanes or gobernadocillos.\n\nThe cabezas de barangay who governed this little pueblo also earned for themselves the honor of being called “capitan” by their own people. The church wielded tremendous power at that time in the affairs of the government. Any person who offends the clergy or disobeys religious order is severely punished.\n\nAmong the well-known capitanes who controlled the reins of the local administration of this barrio were: Hilario Barcelon, Manuel Leyes, Romualdo Tubia, Florentino Flores, Felipe Aguilar and the last well-known cabeza or capitan was Gerardo Faelnar popularly known among the people as Capitan Dadoy whose administration lasted up to the early days of American occupation.\n\nShortly after the coming of the Americans, Bontoc became a unit barrio of Sogod.\n\nDuring the Japanese occupation, the town served as the seat of resistance movement against the Japanese with its general headquarters in sitio Mamingaw, Barangay Banahaw and under the command of Colonel Ruperto K. Kangleon. In one notable raid, an entire truckload of Japanese soldiers on patrol was completely annihilated at Sitio Trece, Barangay Santo Niño. A small monument stands in front of Bontoc motor pool at Sitio Trece commemorates this event.\n\nOn June 15, 1950, it became a regular municipality by the operative provisions of Republic Act No. 522.\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nHinunangan is known as the \"Rice Granary of the Province\" for its vast plain land that is entirely planted with rice. Hinunangan has great potential for tourism because of its beautiful sand beaches and islands. The town is also a producer of rattan and wood-based furnitures, abaca handicrafts items, pineapple, vegetables, other forest products, and bamboo furnitures. It has a potential for mineral water and root crops processing and copper mining.\n\nHinunangan is also known as a major gateway in Leyte because of its near proximity to Tacloban City. The opening of Abuyog–Silago Road cuts travel time from Tacloban by half from the previous 6 hours to less than 3 hours. It is also the place in Southern Leyte with the most immigrants from Europe and North America.\n\nIt has a lot of touristic places, such as Tahusan, Talisay or the twin islands (known as Cabugan Grande and Cabugan Chico as Pigafetta stated in his account during their travel with Magellan).. There are also hotels, inns, a public market and beach resorts.\n\nHinunangan is home to the highest mountain in the province, Mount Nacolod, with an elevation of above sea level.\n\nHinunangan is politically subdivided into 40 barangays, two of which are island barangays located at the east of the town. The twin islands are accessible by motorized boats through Barangay Canipa-an.\n\nIn 1521, Magellan recorded sighting Hunonganan (Hinunangan) during the voyage in Leyte Gulf. As far back in 1750, Hinunangan was a mid-way station of Boholanos trading in Eastern Leyte. They rested overnight at the mouth of Das-ay River where they moored their boats. A shelter was built for the crews and tenders known as \"\"hononganan\"\" or stopover. Hence the name. In 1822, a certain Boholano named Palonoy founded Hinunangan. At this time, Silago to the north and Hinundayan and Anahawan to the south were part of Hinunangan.\n\nIn 1944, in the greatest naval battle in history the blocking warship of the Liberation waylaid the Japanese Fleet near Hinunangan. Thus, the area in Southern Leyte is the natural frontier of historically significant events in Philippine history.\n\nOn July 19, 2007, a strong earthquake hit the town with magnitude 6 on Richter scale and damaged some properties. The partial assessment report of Hinunangan dated July 20, a copy of which was obtained by PIA through Gov. Mercado, placed the estimated cost of damage to properties at P1,650,000.00 broken down as P790,000 for government infrastructure and P860,000 from private infrastructure.\n\nAmong the public properties destroyed were the water system - P 500,000; Das-ay Bridge railguard - P100,000; East Central School Concrete Fence - P80,000; Otama Elementary School - P50,000; Patong Elementary School - P40,000; and Tahusan Elementary School—P20,000.\n\nThe private infrastructure damaged included the Roman Catholic Bell tower - P100,000; Water tank of the Catholic convent - P40,000; Manalog barangay Chapel - P20,000; Santo Nino barangay Chapel - P10,000; a number of houses - P400,000, and various appliances, P290,000.\n\nHigh schools:\n\nUniversities:\n\nOther:\n\n\n\nMobile:\n\nCable television:\n\nInternet:\n\n"}

According to the Hinundayan has a total land area of 6,108 hectares or 61.08 square kilometers, comprising 17 barangays. , it has a population of people.\n\nHinundayan is politically subdivided into 17 barangays.\n\nAmong the seventeen (17) barangays of the municipality, four (4) barangays are considered urban and the remaining thirteen (13) barangays are rural. Based on the Philippine Statistics Authority (NSO), 2007 Census of Population, the municipality's population is dispersed in the rural barangays with a total population count of 7,692 or 66% of the total population while the remaining 34% or the 3,918 population count is concentrated in the urban barangays. \n\nDuring the 17th century, there were Spanish sailors who by chance arrived at our shores in Barangay Sabang. At that time, the fisherfolks and villagers were very busy setting up \"\"handayanans\"\" or resting place for their outrigger canoes. These handayanans were made up of posts with horizontal rails which were a meter high from the ground where the canoes and other sea crafts were laid after use. When the Spanish sailors asked the villagers what was the name of the place, the villagers who were oblivious of the strange language thought that they were asked of what they were doing, so they simply answered in their own dialect, \"\"handayanan among gibuhat para sa among baruto.\"\" The Spaniards noted the first word \"\"Handayanan\"\" as the name of the place, so they refer the place as such, which was later on distorted to \"\"Hinundayan\"\". Since then, this place was called Hinundayan.\n\nBefore Hinunangan became a town, this and Hinundayan were part of the town of Abuyog. But when it was created a town on the 18th century, Hinundayan was part of its jurisdiction.\n\nOn March 21, 1876 the Governor of Leyte Jose Fernandez issued an Executive Order proclaiming Hinundayan a separate town, the first \"“Kapitan Municipal”\" was Don Sotero Tobio. But its townhood lasted only until the Revolutionary Period. When the American came, it became a barrio of Hinunangan again. The \"“Kapitan Municipal”\" at that time was Don Luis Lagumbay.\n\nDue to the petition of some concerned Hinundayanons, Executive Order No. 59 was issued on July 31, 1909 signed by Governor General William Cameron Forbes and Act No. 986 proclaiming Hinundayan a separate town from Hinunangan.\n\n"}
{"id": "2155909", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2155909", "title": "Libagon, Southern Leyte", "text": "Libagon, Southern Leyte\n\n', officially the ', is a in the province of , . According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIt is the home the province's frontier mountain, Mount Patag Daku.\n\nLibagon celebrates its town fiesta every 8th day of December, the feast of Immaculate Concepcion. Another fiesta that is celebrated by the Libagonians is the feast of the Virgin of Mount Carmel every July 16.\n\nThe people's main sources of income are copra, abaca, farming, and fishing.\n\nLibagon is politically subdivided into 14 barangays.\n\n\nIt was said that Libagon got its name from a derivative or distorted word of the dialect, \"libaong\", which means a small depression of the ground. Spanish authorities mistook the reference to the ground fault on the land being tilled as the name of the place. It has since been known by that name, Libagon.\n\nThe Dagohoy revolt prompted more Boholanos to settle the southern towns of Leyte, in particular in Hilongos, Bato, Matalom, Maasin, Macrohon, Malitbog and Hinunangan. Sometime in 1771, seventeen families from the different towns of Bohol migrated in the southeastern coast of Sogod. Led by Marciano Escaño, Agun Espedilla, Fernando Escueta ( Estuita), Mariano Evailar (Yballar), Lazaro Idhaw (now spelled as Idjao), Jose Endriga, Soldiano Arot, Fausto and Agustin Enclona (some families changed their spelling Encluna), Rosendo Evalin (Ybalen), Mauro Escamilla (Escabillas), Laurente Edillo, Domingo Espinosa, Francisco, Felipe and Tiburcio Egina, they founded the visita[satellite barrio with chapel] of Libagon. Andres Espina, a resident of Tamolayag [now Padre Burgos town], Malitbog, was invited to instruct the children how to read and write. Despite of its growing population, Libagon was only recognized as a visita of Sogod sometime in 1850.[13 Gan, Edito. \"Sogod of our Memories: A Special History-Genealogy Account\", Sogod Municipal Hall, Sogod, Southern Leyte]\nThe early known settlers of Libagon were of \"Bol-anon\" ancestry (Boholano people). The settlers' first chosen leader of Libagon was Domingo Mateo Espina. He was the son of Agustin Mateo Espina and Francisca Barbara and the grandson of Pedro Espina of Duero, Bohol. Espina's wife, Potenciana Escaño, was called Capitana Potenciana by townsfolk, in recognition of her role as First Lady of Libagon. The town of Libagon was founded in 1845. At this point in the history of the municipality, the barrios or barangays under Libagon included Sogod and Bontoc at the farthest north and Punta at the farthest south. The Poblacion comprised two barangays: Jubas (at the south) and Talisay (at the north).\n\nBy March 1870, Don Gabriel Ydjao became the chief executive of Sogod and transferred the poblacion [town center] to Libagon. Since Ydjao was a native of that place, and probably because Sogod was far from his residence, he renamed Libagon as Sogod Nuevo (other historical accounts stated that Libagon was renamed Sogod Sur) and Sogod as Sogod Viejo (Sogod Norte). Ydjao also appealed to the parish curate, Padre Logronio, to transfer the parish church in Libagon, a year after Sogod was made a parish.[13] The church in Libagon would remain there until 1924, when a group of concerned Sogodnons plead to the bishop of Calbayog, the Most Reverend Sofronio Hacbang Gaborni, to return the seat of the parish in Sogod.\n\nDon Patricio Tubia, a native of Buntuk, succeeded Ydjao during the 1876 elections as gobernadorcillo until 1878.\nDon Nicolas Idjao won the position of gobernadorcillo in the 1885 elections with Gabino Ellacer as teniente 2, Antonio Reyes as juez de sementeros, Rufino Espina as juez de policia, Ramon Espina as juez de ganados, Vicente Pajuyo as teniente 2 and Catalino Encinas as juez. The alguacils [municipal council or councilors] of Sogod Nuevo, at that period, were Julian Endriga, Raymundo Escabillas, Magdaleno Endriga and Pedro Ermogina(Hermogino). In the visita of Maak, Domingo Javier became the teniente del barrio, Gregorio Deberal as juez and Cirilo Banal and Evaristo Paña as police officers. Eleuterio Faelnar became the teniente del barrio of Sogod Viejo and Hipgasan with Mauro Catajoy and Potenciano Espina as juezes, and Jose Singson and Ariston Meole (now spelled as Miole) as police officers. Florentino Flores became the teniente del barrio of Buntuk with Francisco Cabilin and Fabian Ballena as juezes, and Dionisio Resma and Victor Jomor as police officers.[13] By 1887, Don Eleuterio Falenar, who once served as the teniente del barrio of Sogod, assumed as gobernadorcillo.[13]Borrinaga, Rolando (September 25–28, 2000). \"Leyte: A Forgotten Symbol of Resistance Movements in the Visayas\". http://www.oocities.org. Retrieved May 7, 2014.\n\nDon Cipriano Lebiste (now Leviste, real name Tomas Jabonillo) became the gobernadorcillo of Sogod from 1889 to 1891. The members of the municipal council under Lebiste's administration were Eugenio Destrisa (some families spelled it as Destreza or Destriza), Felix Entino, Magdaleno Dagaas, Catalina Idjao, Pedro Bellesa, Patricio Tubia, Victoriano Godes, Lucio Dagaas and Agustin Ballina.[8]\n\nWhen Don Luis Espina became gobernadorcillo from 1891 to 1893, the municipal council was composed of Buenaventura Gimenes (now spelled as Jimenez), Bernardo Endriga and Damaso Amongan as subalterno tenientes and Anastacio Ylan, Calexto Montanes, Protacio Elejorde and Carlos Ymluna (some families spelled it as Encluna or Enclona) as police officers. During Espina's incumbency, the visita of Maak was reduced to a sitio of barrio Consolacion with Antonio Cañete as the teniente 1, Gregorio Debera (now spelled as De Vera or De Veyra) as teniente 2, Rosales Bonot and Leoncio Cocido as juezes; and Eugenio Demosmog and Pantaleon Dejarme as police officers. With Maak's status being demoted, Sogod Viejo was also placed under the jurisdiction of the visita of Hipgasan with Crispulo Cabales as teniente 1, Domingo Bellesa as teniente 2, Mauro Catajoy as juez 1, Tranquilino Dagohoy as juez 2, and Victoriano Camba and Juan Javier as police officers. In Buntuk, Felipe Aguilar and Felix Entino assumed the position of tenientes 1 and 2 while Graciano Samaño and Antonio Arguelles were designated as juezes and Leoncio Resma as police officer.[8]Gan, Edito. \"Sogod of our Memories: A Special History-Genealogy Account.\" Sogod, Southern Leyte: Sogod Local Government Unit\n\nBy 1893, Sogod was again headed by Don Nicolas Idjao with Crisante Pajuyo, Dimas Yndico (now spelled as Endico), Macario Ylang and Mauricio Sembrano as tenientes, Patricio Tubia as juez de sementeras, Luis Espina became the juez de ganados, Buenaventura Gimenez as juez de policia, and Felipe Paitan, Pedro Ralo (now Rale), Enrique Tiguetigue (now Tikistikis) and Fruto Egina as police officers.[8]Gan, Edito. \"Sogod of our Memories: A Special History-Genealogy Account.\" Sogod, Southern Leyte: Sogod Local Government Unit\n\nAt some point in time, possibly during the years following 1845 until 1885, Libagon was deemed as a barrio of Sogod, together with Bontoc and Consolacion. In 1885, Nicolas Idjao was elected as gobernadorcillo and transferred the poblacion of Sogod to Libagon, from Sogod. Then, he renamed Libagon as Sogod Nuevo or Sogod Del Norte while Sogod as Sogod Viejo or Sogod Del Sur. After twelve years of power, the poblacion was restored to Sogod for a while when Benito Faelnar was appointed as capitan municipal of Sogod. But in 1904, Ladislao or \"Estanislao\" Decenteceo was elected and transferred the poblacion to Barangay Consolacion, a barrio from Libagon. However, in 1912, the poblacion was again transferred to Sogod when Vicente Cariño took office in that year.\n\nOn 16 October 1913, Libagon and Sogod were finally separated into two independent towns – Libagon (14 barrios) and Sogod (45 barrios). The challenges of an increasing population necessitated the division. The new Libagon was under the administration of the new Presidente Municipal, Mariano L. Espina.\n\nThe Cebuano language is either commonly spoken in Libagon or the Boholano dialect (\"Binol-anon\") although there are some slight linguistic variation maybe in form, meaning or context. The Filipino language (or Tagalog) and English are taught in Elementary and High School.\n\nLibagonons (or Libagonians) are predominantly Roman Catholic.\n\nThe town celebrates its annual fiesta in honor of their patron saint, the Blessed Virgin Mary of The Immaculate Conception on December 8. She is also the principal patroness of the Philippines. Other main Catholic holy days, including the local feasts of barangays, are observed throughout the year.\nBesides the main fiesta on 8 December, every 16 July, rain or shine, \"Libagonians\" also celebrate the feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. They have a commending devotion to Mother Mary and a firm belief in Mary's general aid and prayerful assistance. The day after the feast, the traditional \"Pangilis\" is held. \"[Pangilis from the root word \"ilis\" meaning \"change\"].\" On the 17th (July), at the break of dawn, the sounding of a bugle early in the morning to awake people, or \"dayana\" in the dialect, is carried out as a custom observed through the years to start-off the \"Pangilis\" solemnization and festivity. \"[\"Dayana\" etymology: Spanish: diana: reveille]\". The former \"ermano-ermana\" hand over the holy image of the Our Lady of Mount Carmel to the home of the succeeding \"(h)ermano\" or \"(h)ermana mayor\" for the following year's fiesta in a procession joined by townsfolk of Libagon mostly from the poblacion. Before the \"Pangilis\", devotees (\"Carmelitas\" or Carmelites) who pledge for one's support for the coming year's celebration are also enlisted. Then after the street parade, immediately begins a joyous street dancing that ends on or before midnight. This affair is usually led by that year's chosen (\"with solicitation\") or at times designated \"\"King and Queen\" of Pangilis\". In recent celebrations, a \"Pangilis Idol\" is determined in a contest of talents usually in dancing dressed in their own imaginative, artistic, colorful and, at times, bizarre costumes.\n\nSimilarly, these two feasts feature the colorful \"karo\" (carriage) that carries the holy image of the Blessed Virgin Mary on a ceremonial procession after the novena and mass held on the evening before the feast day. Both the \"karo\" and the church's altar are usually adorned with creative floral arrangements.\n\nThe first church and convent built by \"Libagonons\" were of wooden structure. \"The tradition of building wooden churches date back from the Middle Ages until the turn of the 18th century. The skills, knowledge and experience to build an ample log structure were performances out of the ordinary\". (\"See: Wooden Churches of Maramures\"). As commonly practiced in the past, the construction of the church, chapel, convent and the town hall was made possible through bayanihan, a spirit of communal unity or effort to do a particular goal. A resident of proper age can volunteer at least a day in a week to a month to help or work in the construction. Usually on a Saturday, the volunteers ascended the mountains to look for timber for the church's pillars and some wood used in other means, like wood joints, posts, floors, etc. The wood found were Narra trees \"(pterocarpus)\", Molave trees \"(vitex parviflora)\", White Lauan \"(shorea contorta)\" and other rainforest trees in the forested mountains of Libagon. The largest pillars were huge trees bigger than the circumference of a man's (or two men's) outstretched arms. The task of dragging down the trees (with very strong ropes on both ends) from the mountainous jungle on narrow access was indeed a hazardous challenge to the men. In like manner, another group of volunteers brought gongs and drums to tap a repeated rhythmic beat and synchronized the pushing and pulling down of the timber while together they howled, \"\"HIIIIBOOOYYYY...\"\" While on an abrupt slope, restraining the heavy log is crucial to prevent it from running over someone and avoid breakage of the tree. Each of them brought their own food and an ample amount of coconut wine \"(tuba)\" stored in a baler shell or bamboo container to quench their thirst. Despite all these, the bayanihan spirit of the \"Libagonons\" rose above the arduousness of the endeavor and wiped out any exhaustion they felt.\n\nAside from timber, the church's foundation were made of crushed rocks, stones and sand that were hauled and made into tablets of stone and framed as walls. The stone walls stood nearly at 5 to 6 feet tall and laid on top with lumber that continued up to the ceiling. The groundwork for every column was deep and durable. As cement, they used stones and sand daubed with whipped egg whites mixed with lime to reinforce the pillars. The floor tiles were specifically requested from Barcelona, Spain. The belfry stood high with three large church bells. Each piece, when rang, upended and plunged causing a loud sound that can be heard as far as San Isidro, Banday, and areas across Sogod Bay. Unfortunately, during World War II this wooden church was burned down by the Japanese invaders and was rebuilt into its present structure with a more modernized architecture but twice smaller than the original. They tried to reposition the original columns to rebuild it but they were unexpectedly tough to demolish. They instead had to severe the posts from the surface.\n\nThe first ever parish priest of Libagon was Padre Don Tomas Logroño from Inabanga, Bohol. He graduated from \"Colegio-Seminario de San Carlos\" of Cebu (\"presently known as San Carlos Major Seminary of Cebu\"). He arrived in Libagon in June 1870. He was instrumental in the materialization of Libagon's earliest parish and convent. He bought articles, stuff and other religious items needed in the church. He served as Libagon's parish priest for 12 years. In April 1882, he was destined to the town of Macrohon, Southern Leyte until his demise on October 21, 1901.\n\nDuring the early years of the Spanish regime, the town's leader was addressed as the \"\"Capitan\"\" similar to \"Alcalde Municipal\", or \"Presidente Municipal\", and presently, Municipal Mayor. On record, the succession of leaders in Libagon from Spanish to American regimes to Postwar (Philippine Independence) 1946-1965 was as follows:\n\n\nDuring the Japanese occupation of the Philippines (1942–1945), Petronilo \"Liloy\" Ebarle was appointed as the Municipal Mayor from 1942-1944. However, the guerrillas alluded him as a \"puppet mayor\". Though Mayor Ebarle held the Japanese-appointed position, Mayor Gregorio E. Edillo also continued to be the official leader under the authority of the Philippine Commonwealth with the United States. On the other hand, the people also recognized the command of the guerrilla forces of Leyte or the Leyte Area Command under Coronel Ruperto Kangleon, and supported as well the supervision of the Volunteer Guards in the town level. There were only two leaders of the Volunteer Guards in Libagon. The first was Lieutenant Francisco Barros, followed by Francisco \"Dodo\" Espina.\nAnd the only \"Libagonian\" officials of the Leyte Area Command (LAC) were Lieutenant Catalino \"Nongnong\" E. Soledad, Lieutenant Feliciano \"Lily\" A. Espina and Lieutenant Marcelo \"Celing\" E. Espina, who were also officers of USAFFE (U.S. Army Forces in the Far East). These three brave \"Libagonians\" fought in the Battle of Bataan which represented the most intense phase of Imperial Japan's invasion of the Philippines during World War II. Unfortunately, of the three brave men, only Marcelino Espina did not make it back to his hometown, Libagon. His body was left on the battlefield of Bataan. He was the younger brother of Francisco \"Dodo\" Espina who became the town's Mayor for two terms. Like , many valiant guerrillas from Libagon died during the war. A Memorial Stone (\"Ang Bato sa Paghandum\") was built in memory of these heroic men of Libagon. All their names were engraved on granite to honor their lives and monumentalize their memory and courageous deed. The Memorial Stone now stood in the midst of Libagon Rizal Park.\n\nThe Contemporary period includes the final years of the Third Republic (1965–72) and the entirety of the Fourth Republic (1972–86) to the succeeding years following the 1986 People Power Revolution.\n\n\nLibagon is the home of exotic and unique natural areas that are excellent for ecotourism and adventure travel. Perhaps the most defining experience in adventure travel is found in Libagon. However, \"“a walk through the rainforest is not eco-tourism unless that particular walk somehow benefits that environment and the people who live there. A rafting trip is only eco-tourism if it raises awareness and funds to help protect the watershed.”\" (Untamed Path)\n\nPatag Daku is located in Libagon, Southern Leyte, particularly in the upper or mountainside of the poblacion in Talisay.\n\nPatag Daku, in English, means \"big plain\". It is certainly big but is never quite plain. It is actually a valley so dense in vegetation that novice campers and mountaineers will never come in or out without an experienced guide leading the way. But the trek to the valley comes big in every way. In mountaineering parlance, it is a major climb. Not the leisurely stroll that one might expect, the climb is an arduous six-hour journey through a maze of trees, ferns, moss, grass and big trees.\n\nPatag Daku, the mossy forest more than 500 hectares of unexplored, uncharted wilderness, fraught with dangerous tales of huge snakes and wild animals.\n\nUwan-uwanan falls is located in barangay Kawayan, Libagon. The gorge is a world-class adventure wonder. Climbing, swimming and trekking rolled into one. It will take a two-hour trek to the mountains, rappelling and climbing bamboo ladders within cascading falls before you reach the top.\n\nUwan-uwanan, literally means \"resembling a rainfall\" because the two-hour track entails an enchanting encounter of an \"uwan-uwanan \". And at the top, photo enthusiasts are in for a marvelous treat. At exactly 12:00 noon when the sun is directly above the middle of the narrow opening at the gorge, the natural light is awe-inspiring as it dramatically illuminates the whole area resembling a magnificent altar in a cathedral or a place of worship.\n\nHindag-an Falls is a natural wonder found in St. Bernard, Southern Leyte. Just about 1 kilometer away from the roadside. The place displays natural waterfalls with man-made pools. In every waterfall is a pool of particular depth. The deepest was about 10–15 feet wherein you need to jump from above the rocks to get to the pool. There is also a pool for children about 2 ft. and also a water slide.\n\nThe beach in barangay Pangi is of fine black sands usually great for swimming, hiking and ecotourism. Other black sand beaches can also be found in more places than anyone thinks, like the famous black sand beaches of Polynesia, Indonesia, Iceland, the Caribbean islands and the Punaluu Black Sand Beach in Hawaii, were created virtually instantaneously by the violent interaction between hot lava and sea water.\n\nThe suspicion of a volcano close to Libagon may explain the black sand beach formation in barangay Pangi. But there is no exact evidence on this suspicion as verified by the concerned agency.\n\n\"See also: Black sand and Black Sand Beach\"\n\nBiasong Springs is one of the oldest spring in Southern Leyte. It is located in the barangay of Biasong. The clear spring water is collected into a man-made basin or pool.\n\nThe place is a favorite of the locals providing cool mountain spring water. A pool that has been the site of many happy occasions: birthday picnics, homecoming celebrations, etc. It has perhaps the sweetest mineral spring water in the province and most uncontaminated source.\n\nPeter's Mound, a fascinating dive site, is a sea mound located just 200 meter offshore from barrio Otikon.\n\nA sea mound just 200 m. (650 ft.) offshore, is a cleaning station for large pelagics. Animals to see are: wrasse, grouper, sweetlips, surgeons, fusiliers, tuna, and jacks together with other species of reef fish. The deep starts at 10m and drops off to over 40m. The currents can be strong which means that coral life is profuse.\n\nLibagon has a century-old and well-preserved Spanish style municipal hall. The structure gives a glimpse of the town's rich heritage. It is amongst Southern Leyte's premier historical sites and landmarks - the pride of Southern Leyte.\n\nThis is the only memorial left of the \"Lungsod-Daan\" or the original location of the town center of Libagon. It is made of boulders or tablets of rock, limestone and gravel. This structure is made strong and formidable as a defensive fortification against the Moros (Muslim) from the big island of Mindanao. \"See also Moro people (section: Spanish period)\".\n\nStrategically located, the edifice is overlooking Sogod Bay and the two deltas of the islands of Limasawa and Panaon. The Bulwark or \"Balwarte\" at the old town center is near the big river named \"Tubig-Daku\", below and adjacent to the existing cemetery. This is also where the Japanese soldiers camped during World War II.\n\nThe ruins of the old pantalan or seaport still stand along the shores of the Poblacion in Jubas. Recently, the entire seacoast along Sogod Bay is transformed into a \"park by the bay\" also commonly referred to as the \"Boulevard\" in Jubas ideal for walks and for viewing the sunset while fishermen on their lighted \"bancas\" or boats scatter all over the bay. This is seen most specially during peak fish season.\n\nBesides, the beautiful sunset along Sogod Bay, the whale-sharks in Southern Leyte are simply at home in Sogod Bay. Whale-sharks or Rhyncodon typus are popularly known locally as \"iho-tiki\". Recent sightings confirm that whale-sharks actually are all over Sogod Bay. They were spotted in San Francisco, Southern Leyte, as well as in Limasawa, Malitbog, Libagon, Sogod, Pintuyan and even as far as San Ricardo. In fact, they had long been ordinary fare for small fishermen. People have gotten used to them that young boys ride on their backs as they scour for plankton along the village shores. Though, there is no 100 percent guarantee to spot a whale-shark in Sogod Bay. It takes proper timing, good weather, and a huge amount of luck to see one. Patience is the name of the game. The best time to see whale-sharks in Southern Leyte is April and May.\n\nLike most local governments from Luzon to Visayas and Mindanao, a Rizal monument is erected to commemorate the Philippines' national hero, Dr. Jose Rizal, regarded as the foremost Filipino patriot. The Rizal monument stands at the Libagon Rizal Park, a significant landmark of Libagon located strategically in the midst of the poblacion.\n\nLike the old church, several large pillars made the convent strong. The large convent was built beside the church. Unlike the old sanctuary, the old friary was providentially spared from being burned down during the war. The structure defied many strong typhoons, hurricanes, and vigorous quakes—a token of the superior groundwork.\n\nEarlier, the friary being the home of the parish priest and church servants was also used as the house of the first Catholic educational institution of Libagon and the first and only High school. The limited funds to set up a Secondary school moved the founders to appeal to Bishop Manuel Mascariñas (in Palo, Leyte) for his approval to use some of the rooms of the convent. Because Libagon High School was dedicated to be a Catholic institution the Bishop acceded to the request and even allowed the High School to use the church's plaza as well.\nInitially known as the \"Libagon High School, Inc.\", the establishment basically taught Catechism – training for the young Catholic faithful with questions and answers about the essentials of Catholic faith and doctrine so that they could understand easily their faith. Besides the 3 R's (Reading, Writing and Arithmetic), the Spanish language was normally taught at that time. Music, however, was especially instructed. Musicians, songwriters, singers and choirmaster were trained for the church's choir. The same musicians completed the town's band that was well known among other bands in the province.\n\nThe Bureau of Private Schools suggested that the establishment be given another name that would signify it as a non-public school. Thus, the Board of Trustees signed a resolution renaming the High School as, \"Libagon Academy.\" Consequently, they renamed the corporation as, \"Libagon Academy Foundation, Inc.\"\n\nIn another resolution the Board decided to make the Academy a non-profit organization. All proceeds (if there was any at all) were used to improve the schoolhouse. The modest tuition enabled all primary school graduates to continue their education in High school in their own town instead of spending more to attend school in nearby provinces, or stop and work in the farm or simply marry. However, the low tuition prevented the academy to some earnings, thus the resolution. After all, the many professionals – the teachers, doctors, lawyers, engineers, auditors, seamen, nurses, and many other professionals as products of Libagon Academy—became undoubtedly the biggest dividend of a simple and unassuming town, such as, Libagon.\n\nThe Libagon Academy was yet another product of the bayanihan spirit among Libagonians. The forerunners and shareholders, who were also parents and widowed mothers after the war, were driven with the same purpose to give reasonable education to their children. And as donation, they pulled together some of their own personal belongings (like pocket books, magazines, notebooks, etc.) to the academy. These admirable men and women were motivated by the selfless efforts of the founders of the first Libagon High School \"(renamed Libagon Academy)\" despite stiff disapproval from some factions.\n\nThe founding Board of Trustees were:\n\n\nThe pioneer members of the Faculty were:\n\n\nOn June 1949, Libagon Academy opened its doors for its first day of classes. The institution remained to be the only premier Catholic educational organization of the municipality of Libagon.\n\nOrdinarily, the \"habal-habal(s)\" or single motorcycles are used as modes of transportation in crossing Sogod and to other distant and mountainous areas. Sogod is the major terminus in the south central portion in Leyte Island. It is the vital link in connecting Visayas to Mindanao. The buses, jeepneys, and for-hire vans terminate from Sogod to Maasin City, Ormoc City, Tacloban City, Bato-Hilongos, Liloan (\"by way of\" Libagon), Hinunangan and Silago.\n\nThe Libagon Highway is part of the Pan-Philippine Highway, also known as the Maharlika Highway (AH26). It is a 3517 km network of roads, bridges, and ferry services that connect the islands of Luzon, Samar, Leyte, and Mindanao in the Philippines, serving as the country's principal transport backbone. The northern terminus of the highway is at Laoag City, and the southern terminus is at Zamboanga City.\n\nIn addition, traveling to Manila from Libagon approximately takes 24 hours by bus along with ferry from Northern Samar to Matnog. The trip is a scenic interprovincial ride. Philtranco buses are long known to serve this route.\n\nMobile:\n\nInternet:\n\nCable Television:\n\n"}

{"id": "2155914", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2155914", "title": "Macrohon", "text": "Macrohon\n\n', officially known and called as the ', is a in the province of , . According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe municipality is the hometown of former guerilla warrior and Philippine Senator Ruperto Kangleon (Barangay San Roque), world renowned international singer Mike Hanopol (Barangay Ichon), former Southern Leyte Congressman Aniceto \"\"Odong\"\" Saludo (Barangay Ichon) and beauty queen Miss Eco International 2018 Cynthia Magpatoc Thomalla (Barangay Sta. Cruz).\n\nThe Municipality of Macrohon has a total land area of . Of this area, 12,338.08 hectares or 97.61% is occupied by the 27 barangays, with Cambaro having the biggest area. About 301.39 hectares (2.38%) is occupied by the Poblacion, composed of three barangays namely Santo Rosario, San Vicente (Poblacion) and Santa Cruz. Rivers and creeks cross Macrohon; the most prominent ones are the Amparo River and Villa Jacinta River. Along the seacoast are coral reef and sand beaches.\n\nThe town has varying contour elevations. The western portion along the seacoast comprises a level land. The rest of the land area has varying elevations ranging from gently sloping areas, land sloping in one general direction to steeply undulating and rolling land sloping in many directions.\n\nMacrohon's northern portion is bounded by the City of Maasin, the Municipality of Padre Burgos borders the southern portion and the Municipality of Malitbog borders the eastern portion and faces Mindanao Sea on the west. The town center is away from Maasin City, which is the capital of Southern Leyte; and is away from the town of Padre Burgos.\n\nMacrohon is politically subdivided into 30 barangays.\n\nMacrohon since 1895, was named in memory of Spanish Governor-General Manuel MacCrohon, of Irish descent. It was weaned from the jurisdiction of Maasin in 1904. The town of Macrohon holds the distinction of having a son who led the resistance in Leyte and prepared the landing of the Liberation Forces which earned him high posts after the war and posthumous promotion by President Fidel V. Ramos to Brigadier General Ruperto K. Kangleon. Back to ancient times, after the United States took over the Philippines from Spain,\n\nMacrohon became a municipality. However, in 1906, it was reverted as a barrio. When Salvador Demeterio was elected a delegate to the First National Assembly, he made Macrohon a separate municipality in 1907. Demeterio was also elected as governor of Leyte and the Capitol Building of Tacloban was built during his term. A historic edifice that during the naval pre- invasion bombardment, Ruperto K. Kangleon persuaded Gen. Douglas MacArthur on board the USS Nashville to desist the inclusion of Tacloban as target to preserve the capitol building. Thus, Macrohon earned a unique distinction of having great leaders deserving hallowed place in history.\n\nThe town has a land area of 120 hectares. Its coastline has many mangroves, resort beaches and springs. A tiny islet in barrio Molopolo, a vacation home of its owner, continue to attract visitors and the beaches and springs inveigle bathers. The barrios of Aguinaldo (since 1870, named in memory of the 1st Filipino Revolutionary leader, Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo); Amparo (in memory of its Patron Saint and river); Asuncion; Bag-ong Silang; Buscayan, Cambaro, Canlusay, Flordeliz (was named barrio Katung, a name of a revolutionary commander); Guadalupe; Ichon (named in memory of Emilio Ichon, secretary to the Leyte revolutionary commander); Ilihan, Laray; Mabini; Mohon; Molopolo ( barrio since 1845, a name from the abundant mangrove trees along the coast); Rizal ( a barrio since 1858; it was known then as Baliw, it was changed to Rizal to honor the National Filipino Hero and to remind the people of Macrohon the Philippines' struggle for freedom); San Joaquin ( a barrio since 1896, known then as Luuk); San Roque ( a barrio since 1873, known as Panagsaan); San Vicente (Poblacion); San Vicente (Upper); Santa Cruz; Santo Niño; Santo Rosario; Sindangan; Lower and Upper Villa Jacinta and Upper Ichon (also known as Lumbang). These baranggays constitutes the political units of the town of Macrohon.\n\nDistinguished luminaries from Macrohon, who earned renown, are the following: WWII Resistance Hero, Gen. Ruperto K. Kangleon, also assigned as Secretary of National Defense and was also elected as senator; Rep. Ciriaco K. Kangleon and Leyte Governor Salvador Demeterio. Archbishop Mariano G. Gaviola; former Court of Appeals Presiding Justice Ramon G. Gaviola, Jr.;and former Secretary of Education, Culture and Sports Ricardo Gloria, trace their roots from Macrohon. Their exemplary lives inspired others as to append the honor to Macrohon as the fountainhead of successful sons.\n\nThe Municipal Government of Macrohon was organized in 1901 headed by Mr. Felomino Demeterio as the first appointed president. The town was composed only of the following barrios: \"Nipaon\" now Ichon, \"Hingatigan\" now Amparo, \"Maypague\" now Aguinaldo, \"Catong\" now Flordeliz and \"Panasawa\" now San Roque.\n\nIn 1903 a formal grade school was opened which was the most important activity during the period. In the year 1906, Macrohon was reduced to a barrio of Maasin excluding Barrio San Roque, which was part of Malitbog. The new governor-general in accordance with the general reorganization plan instituted this in order to economize government expenditures by fusing small towns and provinces. When Mr. Bautista Kuizon became a member of the Maasin Municipal Council representing Macrohon, he noticed that the administration neglected Macrohon because of its distance from the poblacion. Salvador Demeterio brought a petition signed by only around twenty people who know how to read and write to the governor general. They changed the name of the town to Smith with the hope of getting favorable action from Governor Smith. But it was stipulated in the executive order approving the petition to retain the old name Macrohon.\n\nThe executive order was implemented in 1907. Capitan Gerardo Kuizon was appointed municipal president.\n\nThe next head of the municipality was the first elected municipal president, Mr. Bautista Kuizon. His knowledge on the democratic processes during the student days in Manila made him the most competent person to lay down the foundation of a real democratic government in the municipality. He implemented the separation of power between the church and state reminiscent of the Spanish Regime. He strictly practiced equally under the law and demonstrated it by not averting a fine meted on his own mother who happened to break a provision of an ordinance. He also succeeded to provide religious toleration in the town by extending protection to the propagator of new faiths such as the Protestants and the Aglipayan. By this, he got the ire of the parish priest and the church leaders, but he was able to regain their friendship and cooperation. Mr. Kuizon stayed in the office a little more than a year. He moved out to Mindanao and left the municipality to his vice, Mr. Ponciano Tallo.\n\nDuring the elections in 1912, Mr. Filomeno Demeterio was elected Municipal President of Macrohon. Under his leadership the town was reconstructed after it was hit by the most devastating typhoon in the town’s history. He served two terms from 1913-1919. The period covering the First World War was a period of progress in Macrohon. The price of abaca was high and almost all vacant lots caused by the typhoon of 1912 were planted with abaca. A native son veteran Federico Gaviola, who served under the United States Army in France, represented the town at the war front. Mr. Trinidad Demeterio was elected to succeed his elder brother. He served for three consecutive terms from 1919 to 1927.\n\nThe former Chief of Police, Mr. Felixberto Kuizon, was elected municipal president in 1929 and served the term from 1928 to 1930. Atty. Prisco Bitos occupied the office of the municipal president for two terms from 1931 to 1936. In his incumbency another cooperative marketing association was organized and sponsored by municipal government. It was only short-lived, but during its existence the association affected better price of abaca and copra. During the commonwealth government Mr. Tereso Kangleon became the first Municipal Mayor, starting 1936. He was serving his second term when the war broke out. When he fled in 1942, Mr. Tito Gloria Sr., his vice took over and was the one who met the Japanese occupation army to accept the Japanese sovereignty.\n\nIn 1943, Mr. Tito Gloria, Sr. affiliated himself with the free Leyte government sponsored by the guerillas. The people chose Mr. Vicente Evarretta as caretaker of the town under the Japanese sponsored Independence.\n\nWhen the Second World War ended the elected mayor resumed his unfinished term. Mr. Tereso Kangleon was reelected for another term. He did not serve his term but rather gave the office to his vice mayor, Mr. Rafael Joven. He reconstructed the town, its public buildings, plazas and bridges. Again he was reelected in the next election from 1952 to 1955.\n\nMr. Conrado Compendio was elected and served as municipal mayor for two terms from 1956 to 1963 where the municipal hall was constructed and completed. In 1957, three new barrios were created:\n\nMayor Leonor O. Galdo, M.D. was installed into office by the election of 1963. He was reelected for a second term in 1967 until 1971. He was reelected again for two successive terms from 1988-1995. Dr. Caridad S. Evarretta was elected as mayor from 1995-1998. Mayor Fe Gaviola-Edillo was elected as mayor for three terms from 1998-2007.\n\nHer vice mayor, Manuel Boldo, was elected as mayor from 2007-2010.\n\nFe Gaviola-Edillo won again as mayor in 2010.\n\nThe current mayor is Alan Jose Kuizon Aroy which term will end in 2022.\n\nMajority of the population is Roman Catholic, while others belong to UCCP, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormons), Seventh-Day Adventists, Iglesia ni Cristo, and Aglipayan Church, Hosanna Assembly of God, Assembly of God, among others.\n\nMacrohon, under the Roman Catholic Diocese of Maasin, is divided into three parishes, all under the Holy Child Vicariate of Malitbog, namely:\n\nThere are eight (8) primary schools, eleven (11) elementary schools and four (4) secondary schools in the municipality of Macrohon. In the primary level, Cambaro Primary School with two (2) teachers of which one (1) is teaching Grades I & II and the other is teaching Grades III & IV. It is eight kilometers away from the highway and is not accessible by transportation. San Isidro Primary School is two and one-half (2½) kilometers away from the highway with two (2) teachers. One teacher teaching Grade I while the other is teaching Grades II & III. One can reach the place by riding on a single motorcycle but most inhabitants want to walk because the road is not well developed. Of the Primary schools only two (2) schools are complete namely: Molopolo Primary School and Aguinaldo Primary School. Both have four (4) teachers. The rest of the primary schools are along the highway.\n\nSalvador Elementary School with seven (7) teachers is also eight (8) kilometers away from the highway and is not accessible by transportation. Ilihan Elementary School is four and one-half (4 ½) kilometers away from the highway with six (6) teachers . This is accessible by land transportation. Of the eleven (11) elementary schools only Mabini Elementary School with six (6) teachers is under the supervision and administration of a lead teacher with a sphere/cluster where it belongs. Four (4) elementary schools are under the supervision and administration of a principal, five (5), with teacher and two (2) with teacher in-charge.\n\nIn the Secondary level, two are private schools, one is a national vocational high school and two are public/national high schools. These are:\n\n\nThe Manhaon Festival is the municipality's cultural and historical festival, which used to be celebrated during the Town Fiesta, September 29, but now celebrated during the Founding Anniversary of the Municipality, October 31.\n\nThe name comes from the word \"mang-haon\" meaning \"to remove cooked food\", from the word \"haon\" meaning \"to pick up pots after cooking something\".\n\nMoro raiders, usually arriving at dusk, surprise the coastal dwellers which force them to hide in tall bushes. The Moros would then get their food, thus the name \"Manhaon\". The term thus believed where the name of the town was derived.\n\nThe 2006 Manhaon Festival Contest was celebrated on Sept. 29, 2006, at the spacious Municipal Plaza. Tribu ng Maasin garnered first place, Concepcion National High School (from the town of Malitbog) second and Macrohon Institute (MACI), Inc. third.\n\nDuring the 150th Founding Anniversary of Macrohon, October 31, 2010, the Manhaon Festival Contest took place, again, at the Municipal Plaza. This time around, the five high schools located within the Municipality of Macrohon each sent a contingent to the competition, and the results were:\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe municipality of Malitbog is located in the southern region of the island of Leyte, one of the major islands in the Philippines. It is officially designated as part of Region VIII, or Southern Leyte. It is situated along the coast of Sogod Bay and is bounded on the north-west by the municipalities of Macrohon and Maasin City, the capital town of the province of Southern Leyte, on the north-east by the municipality of Tomas Oppus and on the south by the municipality of Padre Burgos. It is two away from Tacloban City, the regional center of Region VIII. It can be reached by bus and other public utility vehicles and privately owned ones with a travel time of 40 minutes to one 1 hour to and from Maasin City, and 30-40 minutes to Sogod. It takes about 2-4 hours to and from Malitbog to Tacloban City.\n\nMalitbog is politically subdivided into 37 barangays.\n\nThe town of Malitbog, Southern Leyte came into existence in the early part of the 18th century as proven from the inscriptions on the stone walls of the ruins of the watchtowers \"Baluarte\" located equidistant from the Roman Catholic Church. One is found south of the Poblacion in Barangay Caaga and the other in Barangay Abgao north of the Poblacion. Said watchtowers were constructed in the year 1820. The two barangays abovementioned were ruled by their chieftains, called capitanes. No traces could be found as to the names of the capitanes. As absolute rulers of their respective barangays, they tried to established their own kingdoms. Both of the chieftains wanted to rule the other, hence, there was strong and keen rivalry between the two and the pueblo was to be organized by the Spaniards sometimes in the middle part of the 18th century. The inhabitants were very much confused as to where the pueblo be located. Confusion in the local dialect means \"makalibog\". Since that time the Spaniards organized the pueblo, they called it Malitbog, a derivative or distorted word from the dialect \"makalibog\". They built the Town Center midway and equidistant between the two Barrios.\nThrough the intercession of the Roman Catholic Priest who often visited the two warring barangays, a proposal was made to the rival barangays to fuse the two communities and establish a bigger church. Again, trouble arose as to where the church be constructed. A settlement was later on made through the insinuation of the priest that the church be built not in any of the two barangays but in a location that shall serve as boundaries between them. In 1857, the Roman Catholic Church was built up in baroque architecture by forced labor. And in addition to the construction starting from the very portal of the church leading to the shoreline, going east to serve as the demarcation line between the two rival barangays, at the end of the dividing line a watchtower was constructed. This watchtower was constructed in the year 1862 as inscribed in the walls of the said watchtower. The town of Malitbog was created on December 14, 1849, and was later on reorganized under the provisions of the Maura Law of 1893 the territorial limits covered nineteen (19) kilometers to the south of the Poblacion including the island of Limasawa. \n\nIn 1897, a one-storey building in baroque style was constructed at the left side of the demarcation line also equidistant from the Catholic Church and the watchtower. The said building was believed to be the seat of government during the Spanish Regime. No traces could be found as to the name of the first governadorcillo, though at a later time prior to the Spanish–American War, there were capitanes known in the locality by the name of Capitan Tonio Base and Capitan Esteban Piramide. During the American Regime, the town was reorganized under the provision of Act. No. 82 passed by the Second Philippine Commission in 1900. This Act was known as the Municipal Code and the First Municipal President of Malitbog was Francisco Escaño. A house owned by a certain Macabuhay located at the corner of Calle Real and a street now known as Lopez Jaena served as the Municipal Hall and was later transferred to another private house owned by a certain Chinese merchant at the corner of Calle Real and a street now known as Mayor Vaño Street.\n\nThe American Regime in the early 1900 was marked with the establishment of public elementary schools. One of the school buildings was constructed near the old building built in baroque style during the Spanish era. This old building was later on made into a Municipal Hall. When the enrolment in the school increased, the newly constructed house could no longer accommodate until the local government came into agreement with the school authorities to exchange places. And so the Municipal Hall was transferred for the fourth time to the public school building until at present which remain to the seat of the Local Government Unit of Malitbog. In 1957 during the incumbency of President Carlos P. Garcia, several barrios in the southern portion of Malitbog including the island of Limasawa was created into a separate town as the municipality of Padre Burgos by virtue of an Executive Order No. 265. Fourteen (14) years later, the northern portion of Malitbog was declared into another town known as the municipality of Tomas Oppus, previously known as Santiago through the Act of Congress No. 5777 and further amended by Presidential Decree No. 134. Presently, the municipality has 37 barangays; 21 of which are coastal, 4 are inland and 12 are mountain barangays.\nSee also\n\n\n"}

Henry Ross was born in Toronto, Upper Canada, and probably arrived at Melbourne on \"the Magnolia\" in November 1852, along with Charles Doudiet and three other Canadians.\n\nThere is no evidence of who exactly designed the Eureka Flag, but it was Ross who took the design to three women - Anastasia Withers, Anne Duke and Anastasia Hayes - to ask them to sew it and have it ready in time for the meeting taking place at Bakery Hill at 2.00pm on Wednesday the 29 November 1854.\n\nAt Bakery Hill on 30 November 1854 Captain Ross unfurled the Southern Cross and led the march from Bakery Hill to Eureka Stockade; behind him followed about 1,000 diggers, some armed with rifles, many only armed with picks and shovels. Captain Ross was given the command of a division of miners by a meeting of the 7 captains of the rebellion who met at Eureka that afternoon to organise the defence of Eureka.\n\nLater that afternoon Captain Ross raised the flag on the temporary flagpole that had been erected at Bakery Hill. Sword in hand, his division gathered at the foot of the flagstaff, the sun going down behind them. Peter Lalor jumped onto a stump and asked those around him to take an oath to the Southern Cross. He pointed his right hand towards the Southern Cross and delivered the diggers oath.\n\nThe miners shouted 'Amen' and then marched back to the Eureka Stockade and hoisted the Southern Cross on a makeshift flagpole at the centre of their camp.\n\nWhen the first shots rang out at daybreak on Sunday the 3 December 1854, Captain Henry Ross took up his position at the foot of the flagpole. He was mortally wounded during the early phase of the battle and lay dying at the foot of the Southern Cross when trooper King scaled the flagpole and tore the flag down. By some accounts Ross was shot 10 or 15 minutes after he surrendered. Fellow Canadian (Charles) Alphonse Doudiet, who painted earlier Eureka events, recorded that he was among those who carried the Stockade leader to the nearby Star Hotel, and remained with him until he died \"in great pain\" at 2 am on 5 December 1854. Duncan Clark, from the same regiment as Ross, had been out scouting and returned in time to assist his leader to the hotel.\n\nSome 260 mourners followed the funeral procession of Ross to the Ballarat Cemetery. He was eulogised as \"one of the best loved men of those who fell\". The young Canadian digger, Henry Ross, was buried at the bottom of a mass grave at the Ballaarat Old Cemetery, while his beloved Flag of the Southern Cross is owned by the Art Gallery of Ballarat ( which stands on the site of the soldiers encampment), and is displayed at the Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka, the site of the rebellion.\n\n\n"}

On December 9, 1954, President Ramon Magsaysay issued Executive Order No. 84, converting the barrio as a municipality of Saint Bernard. It was through the efforts of Leyte Governor Bernardo Torres that the conversion was made possible in response to the lingering clamour of the inhabitants for an independent and separate municipality from San Juan. As a gratitude to Governor Bernardo Torres, the people unanimously renamed Himatagon as Saint Bernard, with the honorific title \"Saint\" being a translation of the vernacular honorific \"San\" which is given to persons of virtue, wisdom or generosity and the name Bernard being the English version of the name Bernardo.\n\nOn February 17, 2006, a tragic series of mudslides killed over 1100 residents in Barangay Guinsaugon.

They are also referred to as Agricultural ants. Seed harvesting by some desert ants is an adaptation to the lack of typical ant resources such as prey or honeydew from hemipterans. Harvester ants increase seed dispersal and protection, and provide nutrients that increase seedling survival of the desert plants. In addition, ants provide soil aeration through the creation of galleries and chambers, mix deep and upper layers of soil, and incorporate organic refuse into the soil.\n\nAnts may play an important role in the dynamics of plant communities by acting either as seed dispersal agents or as seed predators, or both. During the day, these ants search the savannas for vegetation and plant seeds, and carry them along back to their nest. The two main mechanisms through which ants disperse seeds are myrmecochory, or seed dispersal mediated by the elaiosome, i.e., a lipid-rich seed appendage that mainly attracts non-granivorous ants and provides rewards for seed dispersal, and diszoochory, or seed dispersal performed by seed-harvesting ants that is not mediated by any particular seed structure. While the former has traditionally been recognized mainly as a mutualism, the latter is usually perceived as an antagonism.\n\nHarvester ants foraging in hot, dry conditions lose water, but obtain water from metabolizing fats in the seeds they eat. Positive feedback on foraging activity, from returning foragers with food, allows the colony to regulate its foraging activity according to the current costs of desiccation and the benefits based on current food availability.\n\nIn many harvester ant species, foraging behavior is influenced by the weather. For example, in the ant \"Messor andrei\", recruitment to food bait is higher in more humid conditions. Both humidity and food availability are affected by day-to-day changes in weather conditions. Food is distributed by wind and flooding and rain uncovers seeds in the top layer of the soil. In \"Pogonomyrmex barbatus\", daily changes in conditions such as humidity and food availability produce strong daily trends in the foraging activity of all colonies.\n\nColonies may vary in the relation between humidity and foraging activity. Colonies differ consistently from year to year in how often they forage at all and most colonies forage on days with high humidity and high food availability, such as those just after a rain when flooding has exposed a layer of seeds in the soil. Few colonies forage on very dry days. Colonies also differ in how likely they are to adjust the rate of outgoing foragers to the rate of forager return. While all colonies tend to adjust outgoing foraging rate closely when conditions are good, only some colonies do so in poor conditions.\n\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nIt was formerly known as Cabali-an. \n\nThe Kabalian language, a Visayan language distinct from Waray-Waray and Cebuano, is spoken in San Juan.\n\nSan Juan (Cabali-an) is politically subdivided into 18 barangays.\n\nThere seems to be no consensus on the exact origin of the name Cabali-an. While there are several versions, the most popular one involves Magellan who happened to pass by Cabalian. This account tells of Magellan and his crew attempting to land this settlement after being battered by a heavy storm known locally as “\"subasco\"”. One of his ships had a broken main mast that required immediate repair. The curious natives led by their chieftain, Datu Malitik, gathered on the shore as they closely watched the approaching ships. The natives who were armed noticed the broken mast and shouted “\"gikabali-an\"”. Roughly translated, the word means “to experience a breakage or broken materials”. Magellan and his men interpreted the hostile-surrounding shouts as the name of the place. Not wishing to engage the natives in combat after the battering of the storm, the explorers lifted anchors and sailed away.\n\nOn June 17, 1961, Republic Act 3088, which changed the name Cabali-an to San Juan, was signed into law by the President of the Republic of the Philippines. However, up to this day, the town is still known as Cabali-an. The name simply refuses to disappear on maps, telecommunication directories and in most people’s minds.\n\nOn September 15, 2010, San Juan celebrated its 150th Founding Anniversary.\n\nMunicipal elected officials:\n\nMobile:\n\nCable television:\n\nThe town celebrates its rich Catholic heritage every 24th day of June, the Solemnity of the Nativity of St. John the Baptist, Precursor to the Divine Word, Our Lord Jesus Christ. The \"novemdiales\" or novena in honor of the patron saint commences every 15th day of June, and is referred to as \"jornadas\". \"Jornadas\" in Spanish means \"sojourns\" or \"journeys\", which specifically refer to the translation of the patron saints of all barangays to kiosks or minuscule chapels outside the baroque parish church. In addition to the eighteen patron saints of the 18 barangays of Cabalian, more come from the hill villages of Hinunangan. They remain in those chapels until the 24th day of June, called the kahuyugan, whence they are processed around the town in andas and carrozas.\n\nThe fiesta spans for three (3) days: (1) disperas (Sp. vísperas) which falls on the 23rd day of June, coinciding with the Vespers for the Nativity of St. John the Baptist in the Divine Office; (2) \"kahuyugan\" (lit. the day on which the fiesta falls) on the 24th of June, coinciding with the main celebrations; and (3) \"liwas\" (lit. post-fiesta) on the 25th day of June, when the remaining victuals are served to fiesta-goers who want to avoid the fiesta traffic and hullabaloo.\n\nThe novena is said in the parish church. Preserving the incorruptible tradition of Visayan Catholic identity, the long \"Gozos in honor of St. John\" is sung. The tradition of the gozos goes back to the august cathedrals of Spain and Portugal. The structure of the gozos follows the usual format of the Spanish gozos: an estribillo (couplet) repeated after every estrofa (verse).\n\nAlthough, the Solemnity of the Nativity of St. John the Baptist was traditionally not celebrated with water dousing, sometime in 2000, the LGU launched the Sinabligay Festival, which translates as Water Dousing Festival. The LGU has passed ordinances prohibiting the use of dirty water during this Festival.\n\nAmongst the activities included in the Town and Patronal Fiesta are the following\n\n\n"}

According to the , it has a population of people.\n\nThe name of the municipality originated from the Cebuano word, \"sogod\", meaning \"\"to start.\"\" Founded as a Catholic mission station by the Society of Jesus in 1601, Sogod became a regular municipality on June 10, 1853.\n\nSogod is located along the Southern Leyte section of the Pan-Philippine Highway, 126 kilometers (78 miles) south of Tacloban City, the regional center of Eastern Visayas. Rugged mountains enveloped most of the town's northern terrain with numerous river systems crept throughout the southern lowlands. Known as the center of trade, commerce and industry in the south-central region of Leyte, Sogod is also home to Southern Leyte State University (SLSU) Main Campus and Saint Thomas Aquinas College (STAC).\n\nThe dearth of resource materials brought difficulty in providing a complete historical account of Sogod from the pre-Hispanic era up to today. Most of the references identified in the account were chronicles written by Spanish missionaries – the Jesuits, the Augustinians, and the Seculars (the Franciscans were assigned to parishes of northeastern Leyte and Samar) – who administered the town. At the forefront of colonization, the islands of Leyte and Samar were neglected by the Spanish colonial government which brought short-term revolts and insurrections to the region. In addition, it is worthy to attribute the Catholic Church's influence in the islands which further improved the shaping of cultural, political, economic and spiritual dimension of the people of Sogod.\n\nEarly annals account that Sogod was first located near the mouth of the Subangdaku River. It was then a satellite territory under the domain of \"Seilani\", which comprises the areas from Bontoc and Sogod to the island of Panaon. Around 1544, due to unfavorable winds, a Spanish expedition headed by Ruy López de Villalobos arrived at the eastern town of Abuyog, Leyte where an aged inhabitant informed Garcia de Escalante Alvarado, the chronicler of the expedition, on the presence of trading posts found in the archipelago:\"I asked him [writes Escalante], whether there was a big town anywhere on the island of \"Abuyo\" [mistakenly referred by the Spaniards as Leyte] and he said yes, on the other side of the island to the north-west [south-west?] there was a big town called Sugut whither Chinese junks come every year and where there are resident Chinese who have a house for their merchandise. He said that what they buy there is gold and slaves...\" On September 6, 1571, Leyte was established as an \"encomienda\" with \"Tandaya\" as the command post of the Spanish colony in the island.Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, the first Governador-General of the Philippines, assigned Juan de Trujillo as the first \"encomendero\", or land trustee, of Tandaya. Miguel de Loarca, one of the first Spanish conquistadores to arrive in the Philippines and conducted one of the earliest census in the country, affirmed that Sogod was already drafted to the \"encomienda\" system in 1582. However, the town was pronounced as Tugud or Tugut:\"\"Island of Baybay.\" About three (3) leagues [fourteen (14) kilometers from Camotes] farther east lies the island of Baybay, or Leyte, as it is also called. It is a large and well-provisioned island, although the people dress in \"medriñaque\" [a fiber from the sago palm in the Philippines]. Leyte is thickly settled; it may have a population of fourteen or fifteen thousand (14,000-15,000) Indians, ten thousand of whom pay tribute because that has been a people hard to conquer. There are twelve (12) \"encomenderos\"; but his Majesty owns none of the Indians. This island is about eighty (80) leagues in circumference, and fifteen (15) or sixteen (16) wide. Its principal settlements and rivers are Vaybay, Yodmuc, Leyte, Cavigava, Barugo, Maraguincay [a river and a current village in Tanauan, Leyte (barangay Malaguicay)], Palos, Abuyo, Dulaque, Longos, Bito [a lake bordering the towns of MacArthur and Abuyog in Leyte], Cabalian, Calamocan [the old name of Inopacan, Leyte] and Tugud. This island possesses neither mines nor gold-placers; the only cloth it produces is \"medriñaque\", which, as I have said before, resembles \"calico\", and is made from a kind of wild banana.\"\n\nThe missionaries of the Order of Saint Augustine (OSA) were the first to Christianize Leyte in 1580. But because they were lacking in number, the mission was given to the care of the priests of the Society of Jesus (SJ) in 1595. The Vice-Provincial of the Jesuit mission in the Philippines, \"Padre\" Antonio Sedeño, chose four priests, Pedro Chirino, Antonio Pereira, Juan del Campo, and Cosme de Flores, and one lay brother, Gaspar Garay to reopen the mission of Leyte. Of the five, \"Padre\" Chirino was the superior of the expedition. The missionaries arrived in the town of Carigara on the morning of July 16, 1595, the feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, from Zebu. They introduced themselves to the \"encomendero\" of Carigara, Cristobal de Trujillo, and presided an assembly for the construction of the mission residence there. While the rest of the Jesuits studied Visayan and catechize the natives to the Faith, \"Padre\" Chirino and \"Padre\" Pereira crossed the central Leyte valley towards the eastern Pacific coast and founded the town of Dulac. Within a span of two years, the Sons of Saint Ignatius of Loyola founded five permanent mission stations: Carigara (July 1595), Dulag (September 1595), Palo (October 1596), Alangalang (May or June 1595) and Ogmoc (1597).\n\nFollowing the successful establishment of settlements in northern Leyte, the Jesuits began to move southwards around the early 1600s. One of these pastors was Padre\" Fabrizio Sersali, an Italian Jesuit from Naples and former superior of Carigara and Ormoc. After founding the mission of Cabalian, he and Padre\" Cristobal Jimenez, then parish priest of Palo in 1595, planned to established mission stations in the settlements of Limasawa, Sogod [in some narratives, the name was spelled as Sogor], and Panaon. But on arriving at Panaon in November 1602, the Jesuits found the town deserted. \"Padre\" Sersali assumed that the natives fled to the mountains because they thought that the missionaries were from Cabalian. He also added, in a letter addressed to \"Padre\" Diego Garcia, the vice-provincial of the Jesuits in the Philippines, that the villagers see them as cannibals. After surveying the area, the village temple dedicated to the Mag-anitos was burned and a cross was planted at the site. Only \"Padre\" Sersali continued to Limasawa. However, upon arriving there, the Christian \"datu\", Bancao have already left the island and settled in Sogod.\n\nAfter Bancao accepted \"Padre\" Sersali in Sogod, the Jesuit began catechizing the villagers to Catholic Christianity. In one of his classes, he noticed that two of Bancao's grandchildren were gravely ill. He immediately requested to the \"datu\" that the Last sacrament be administered to them. Seeing the sincerity of the missionaries, Bancao consented and the Jesuits performed the rite to the children. The next morning, Bancao was very pleased to find out that his children were free from their sickness. In gratitude, the family members of the \"datu\" were baptized. Afterwards, an improvised chapel of \"nipa\", bamboo and \"cogon\", located near the shore, was constructed in 1603. Bancao and the leaders of the village wanted the missionaries to stay and live with them, but because of missionary work, the priests refused their offer and proceeded to Cabalian. This significant event laid the foundation of Christendom in the town. [The historians Manuel Artigas and Joaquin Gonzales-Chong put the date 1616 as the founding of the mission and settlement of Sogod].\n\nThe dark years of Leyte started at the middle of the 15th and 18th centuries when the Mindanao Muslims plundered the south-western and northern shores of the island. Most of the victims were sold as slaves in the markets of Sulu and some were held as hostages. As a result, these marauders were able to extract money from the Spanish civil officials and the Leyte Jesuits for their release.\n\nAccordingly, it was around this period that Sogod begot its name. Since the settlement was frequented by \"Moro\" raids, a \"baluarte\" [watchtower] was built to warn villagers against the approach of the raiders. There were no Jesuits stationed in southern Leyte at this time and that all commands came from the \"datu\". In such crisis, Bancao, who was, and until now, revered as Mangkaw, emerged among the populace. The son of a certain Mangaris, his presence in Sogod was explained by some Portuguese chroniclers. Around 1563, some Portuguese from Moluccas raided and depopulated Limasawa, with a fleet of eight (8) praus. Eventually, Bancao and a number of his household managed to escape to Sogod, while his brother fled to Butuan for refuge.\n\nNotorious for his defense against the pirates, Bancao was a known net-fisherman. Already a fishing ground that it is today, Sogod then had houses clustered close to shore around the watchtower. Being an expert in the art of casting the net, Laya, he could send out the casting net in a perfect circle in the sea. As the community grew bigger, the residents agitated for a name for their place. Meetings after meetings were held presided by Mangkaw. But every time a meeting is ongoing, a shoal of fish would form a quick shifting shadow beneath the surface. The eyes of the pondering \"datu\" kept stalking it, interfering with the discussion. Satisfying his unequalled fisherman's instinct, he would leave the session unattended. The body language of the \"datu\", which portrays an artful slide of the feet, the legs and the hips, while getting a perfect hold of the fishes through his \"laya\" would amaze the attendees from the shore. As a father to the community, he shared his catch with the people for the asking, even by strangers. After which, shouts of \"Sogod, sogod!\" (vernacular for \"\"to begin\"\") would reconvene the meeting. Thus the word \"Sogod\" became the name of the town.\n\nAlthough the name \"Sogod\" already existed before the 1600s, the Bancao account remains to be the accepted etymological origin of the name of the town. However, it might be deduced that the first name, which is pronounced as \"(sú.gut.)\" fits the Escalante description of Sogod being a bustling commercial town of the pre-Hispanic era. The major means of initiating trade during those days were done by barter, that is \"\"to comply\",\"\"\" or \"\"to consent\"\" with the suggested value offered by the merchant to the townsfolk of Sogod. Thus, whenever the buyer and the seller came into agreement on the bartered item, the expression was affirmed in Cebuano, \"\"ming-súgut.\"\"\n\nThe term \"Tugud\", on the other hand, seems like a concealed version of the former. The Spaniards, as accounted by many town histories in Leyte [such as the case of the town of Barugo, Leyte], have difficulty reading and pronouncing Visayan.\n\nBefore the Jesuits could speed up the missionary endeavor, the Portuguese came into Leyte through Mindanao, plundering major settlements known to be in alliance with the Spaniards. The Portuguese already sacked vital trading towns in Mindanao, arousing hostility among the \"Moros\" against the Europeans and the newly baptized Visayan Christians. As a result, a fleet of seventy \"caracoas\" [rowboats], under the command of Datu Buwisan, raided Palo, Dulag and the towns of north-eastern Leyte in August 1603. The pirates held the Jesuit, \"Padre\" Sebastian Hurtado, as captive. Fortunately, a storm prevented the onslaught from sacking Sogod and Cabalian.\n\nIn the nearby island of Bohol, a \"babaylan\" [spiritualist] named Tamblot rebelled against Jesuit hamletting around 1622. This revolt would spread to Leyte and influenced Bancao, who welcomed Legazpi to the Philippines in 1565, baptized at the same time and settled in the town of Carigara. Bancao had been having trouble with Muslim onslaughts in his territory, in particular, in Limasawa. He had witnessed the massacre and bloodshed brought about by the raids of the \"Moros\" on his land and kinsmen.\n\nWhen the \"Moros\" gave out a condition that they would stop the plundering if the Christian natives would abandon the Church, Bancao grasped what it meant and returned to his old pagan religion. The \"datu\" then consigned to halt the conversion process undergone by the Jesuits to the Leyteños. With Pagali, his high priest, Bancao solicited the assistance of other chieftains of the neighboring settlements of Baibai, Panaon, and Sogod and easily won his way across the island to the very capital in the north which was Carigara.\n\nThe rebels, as they were divided all over the settlements that revolted, were not equal, however, to the force of fifty (50) Spaniards and one thousand (1,000) Cebuanos that \"Don\" Juan de Alcarazo, the \"alcalde mayor\" [equivalent to a governor] of Cebu, quickly mustered to suppress the rebellion. After refusing to surrender, Bancao and his followers died valiantly in their defense of \"Calanaga\", situated between Limasawa, Panaon and Sogod [local narratives in Carigara, however, claim that the attack was held in a valley between the interior \"barrios\" of Sogod and Hiraan]. The head of Bancao, as ordered by the Spaniards, was publicly exposed on a pike in the town plaza of Carigara.\n\nAfterwards, in 1632, Padre\" Ventura Barcena, a Jesuit administering the towns of Sogod, Cabalian and Hinundayan, was captured in Sogod and died in captivity in Tawi-tawi. Some two years later, around 1634 that a squadron of twenty-two rowboats, with an army of 1,500 Maguindanaos, under the command of Cachil Corralat, devastated and plundered Dapitan, Bohol and Leyte. This dreadful event brought havoc to Baibai, Cabalian, Ogmoc, and Sogor, with members of the clergy held as captives. Fortunately in Sogod, Padre\" Juan Francisco de Luzon, together with a good number of \"Indios\" were able to escape this incident through a mountain pass to Cabalian. However, local establishments, like the chapel and the houses of the natives were not spared. These structures were burned and other precious items were seized.\n\nAround 1643, the Jesuits Padre\" Juan del Carpio, and Padre\" Juan Bautista Laviarri placed Cabalian as the center of the southeastern Leyte mission. Of the three settlements, Sogod was the farthest. [The historian Rolando Borrinaga accounted that the towns of Cabalian, Hinundayan and Sogod were evangelized by these missionaries around the year 1645. The missionaries would go to Sogod through the mountains of Catmon [a village in Saint Bernard town] and Bitanjuan [a mountain in Libagon town). When the \"residencia\" of Carigara increased into ten villages, Sogod had already its own resident pastor, \"Padre\" Antonio de Abarca. However, in 1645, the Jesuits formally grouped the settlements of Cabalian, Hinundayan and Sogod into an ecclesiastical district.\n\nThe Muslims of Jolo sacked the islands of Camotes, Leyte and Samar, in particular the settlements of Poro, Baibai, Sogod, Cabalian, Basey, Bangajon [Gandara, Samar], Gibatan [Guiuan, Eastern Samar], and Capul, around 1663. At that time, the main \"residencia\" in Carigara was then coping from the 1629 raid done by the same pillagers. This dreadful incident prompted the coming of \"Padre\" Pedro Oriol, a Catalan, to Leyte. He entered the society in 1658 as an aspirant. Before taking his assignments in Bohol, Cebu, Iloilo and Cavite, Sogod and Cabalian were his first pastoral posts. During the visit of the Jesuit Provincial in 1675 to the country, the priest was tasked to go to Carigara for his profession of vows. With no questions asked he went to the place on foot, traversing mountains and forests and experiencing unspeakable fatigue. He died peacefully on September 28, 1705, at Catbalogan, in Samar.\n\nOn May 18, 1700, the colonial government of the Philippines established Sogod as a regular \"visita\" [satellite \"barrio\" with chapel]. With this elevation, a concrete church finally stood in the settlement in the year 1718. The construction was made possible through the mandate of the Most Reverend Sebastian Foronda, OSA, bishopric of Cebu. Eventually, more subdistricts in the vicinity of Sogod came into existence such as the \"barrio\" of Maak, which was established on February 3, 1730 while the \"barrio\" of Buntuk was erected on April 10, 1750.\n\nThe structure of the Jesuit church was rectangular in shape and faced towards the west. Two entrances were located at the sides. It measured seventeen (17) yards in length and ten (10) yards. The floor of the altar is a little bit raised, and it had a pulpit and a baptismal font. The thickness of its walls measures two feet. At the side near the main entrance a Christian can see stones which are rectangular in shape.\n\nAside from the church, a watchtower was constructed about twenty-five (25) yards away from the edge of Sogod Bay and around fifty (50) yards from the river of Subangdaku. The thickness of the stonewalls made of hardened limestone deposits measured four (4) to five (5) feet in thickness while the height measured twenty (20) to twenty-five (25) feet. There are four (4) entrances to the tower equidistant to each other. Unfortunately, the church and watchtower were razed to the ground when a battalion of \"Moros\" stormed the \"visita\" in March and July of 1754.\n\nLocal grapevine states that the church and watchtower boasts of a bell made out of pure gold, the \"Kampanang Bulaw\". Moments before the siege, the watcher already signaled the villagers of the impending attack by pealing the bell. In a hurried state, with no resident pastor present, the villagers took the artifact and buried it in the rice fields opposite the present Subangdaku River. However, there are possible accounts that the \"kampana\" was tossed to a nearby quicksand, in what is now the bus station in barangay Zone III, the old site of Sogod \"poblacion\". Until now, the bell has never been recovered.\n\nWith the founding of the town and \"residencia\" of Jilongos in 1737, the Leyte mission was already divided into three residencies. The other two were Carigara and Dagami. Jilongos had then the settlements of Palompon, Poro, Ormoc, Baybay, Maasin, Cabalian, Hinundayan and Sogod as its annex \"visitas\". As a consequence of the 1754 sacking, the \"visitas\" of Buntuk, Sogod and Maak were incorporated to the newly-established municipality of Maasin, which was guarded by a stone fortification equipped with \"lantakas\", from 1755 to 1768. [The historian Manuel Artigas states that Sogod was a premier \"visita\" of Maasin from 1774 to 1785]. Due to its distance from the \"poblacion\", the parish priests of Cabalian and Maasin would take turns in administering the mission station of Sogod. \"Padre\" Joaquin Romeo would be the last Jesuit to administer the mission stations of Hinundayan, Cabalian and Sogod when all the Jesuit missionaries were suppressed from all colonies of Spain in May 19, 1768.\n\nAt the time of their dismissal, the Society of Jesus had founded many settlements patterned after Spanish colonies in the Americas. In every settlement, an organized road system exists, which further divides it into different subdivisions or districts. The main center of these towns was the plaza, with the parish church and rectory, the \"casa real\" [town hall], the market and the \"escuela parroquial\" [parochial school] surrounding it. Upon the return of Augustinians, the entire island province of Leyte had already exceeded to 11,000 \"tributos\" divided among seventeen (17) settlements.\n\nOn their first years of evangelizing, the Calced Augustinians encountered severe problems and evaluated some methods that the Jesuits initiated. At first, there were only three (3) priests administering the eastern and southern sections of the island province and were not well-received in most towns. More Leyteños were inclined to live in the hinterlands where the farming and fishing was better than in the settlements. And lastly, the \"Babaylanes\" spread rumors that the friars were \"royal agents who procured babies to fatten tigers of the King of Spain.\"\n\nBecause of their dislike of the missionary work of the Jesuits in Leyte, the Augustinians transferred the \"poblacion\" of each municipality in Leyte to the \"visitas\". Some \"barrios\" were separated from the town centers and were made independent municipalities. Examples of which were the relocation of the town centers of Carigara to Barugo, Dagami to Burauen, and Sogod and Liloan to Cabalian. The construction of roads and stone churches and the cultivation of farmlands were prioritized by the friars as means of improving the economic lifestyle of Leyte. They also appealed to the Spanish monarch for the building of fortresses and supplying ammunition to the civil guards stationed in the settlements, which was granted by the king. However, owing to the 1754 raid, Sogod was not included on the census conducted by \"Padre\" Agustin Maria de Castro, which reports the condition of churches and fortifications in the towns administered by the Augustinians.\n\nThe order was also responsible for catechizing the Leyteños to the Christian faith through the building of schools. Upon the mandate of the provincial superior, \"Padre\" Joseph Victoria, parochial schools in the towns were established between 1768 and 1804. More friars arrived after the priest requested to the monarch of Spain for additional workers to supervised the parishes and schools in Leyte. These educational institutions flourished in the towns of Abuyog, Alangalang, Barugo, Baybay, Burauen, Dagami, Dulag, Hilongos, Jaro, Cabalian, Maasin, Ormoc, Palo, San Miguel, Sogod, Tacloban, and Tanauan. In Sogod, a number of secondary schools for boys and girls were built and instituted in the \"visita\"s of Sogod \"poblacion\", Buntuk, Hipgasan [now the present-day barangay of San Pedro] and Maak-Consolacion from 1774 to 1785. During this era, the education thrust continued with young girls enjoying privileges in education with boys. Official interest in education mounted as decrees were issued requiring children living within an hour’s walk from these educational institutions to go to school.\n\nThe Dagohoy revolt prompted more Boholanos to settle the southern towns of Leyte, in particular in Hilongos, Bato, Matalom, Maasin, Macrohon, Malitbog and Hinunangan. Sometime in 1771, seventeen (17) families from the different towns of Bohol migrated in the southeastern coast of Sogod. Led by Marciano Escaño, Agun Espedilla, Fernando Escueta, Mariano Evailar, Lazaro Idhaw (now spelled as \"Idjao\"), Jose Endriga, Soldiano Arot, Fausto and Agustin Enclona (some families changed their spelling \"Encluna\"), Rosendo Evalin, Mauro Escamilla, Laurente Edillo, Domingo Espinosa, Francisco Felipe and Tiburcio Egina, they founded the \"visita\" of Libagon. The first appointed \"cabeza de barangay\" of Libagon was Domingo Mateo Espina, which was the son of Agustin Mateo Espina and Francisca Barbara and the grandson of Pedro Espina of Duero, Bohol. Upon the insistence of the settlers, Andres Espina, a resident of Tamolayag [now Padre Burgos town], Malitbog, was invited to instruct the children how to read and write. Despite of its growing population, Libagon was only recognized as a \"visita\" of Malitbog sometime in 1850.\n\nBy 1778, there were only seven (7) priests distributed among the eighteen (18) parishes of Leyte. The island province had a number of 34,054 Catholics. Of the Catholic population, there were 1,702 souls exempted from \"tributos\" and 12,867 souls subject for \"tributos\". The Augustinians administering the mission of Sogod during this period were Padre\" Tomas Sanchez and Padre\" Vicente Rodriguez. The two (2) friars were in charge of the eastern towns of Abuyog, Cabalian, Hinundayan and Sogod, with Dulag as the center of the ecclesiastical district. Under Father Rodriguez, a mission house and a church made of transient materials were rebuilt to facilitate the spiritual needs of Sogod. He served the settlement until 1785.\n\nAround 1843, the missionary priests of the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin (OFM), or he Franciscans, replaced the Calced Augustinians, in accordance to a Royal Decree issued on October 29, 1837. They occupied sixteen (16) parishes in the eastern part of Leyte: Abuyog, Alangalang, Babatngon, Barugo, Burauen, Carigara, Dagami, Dulag, Hinunangan, Hinundayan, Jaro, Leyte, Malibago [now a barangay of Babatngon town], Palo, San Miguel, Tacloban, Tanauan, and Tolosa. With the arrival of the Franciscans and the ceasing of \"Moro\" raids, the provincial population increased, more infrastructures were developed and agricultural output in the \"pueblos\" was maximized. Education was also prioritized, as what the Augustinians started, and more schools were built along the villages. Churches were also remodeled and refurbished. Muslim attacks had practically ceased and the existence of major trade centers spurred the progress among these towns. Large \"barrios\" were becoming independent from the \"poblacion\", and separated as \"pueblos\".\n\nWhile the Franciscans evangelized the northern towns, the diocesan priests from Cebu took the Cebuano-speaking areas of the province as their parochial assignments – Albuera, Baybay, Cabalian, Hilongos, Maasin, Macrohon, Malitbog, Ormoc, Palompon, Quiot, Sogod and Villaba – in the middle of the 19th century. Although Sogod was founded years before Malitbog was made a municipality on December 14, 1849, the latter enjoyed the civil privileges being conferred from Manila. The \"visitas\" of Buntuk, Cabalian, Himay-angan [a barangay in Liloan], Inolinan [the old name of the town of San Ricardo, now a barangay of San Ricardo town], Liloan, Maak, San Francisco and Sogod were inscribed to the municipal and parochial jurisdiction of Malitbog. At that period, \"Padre Don\" Francisco Fernandez held the position as parish priest of Malitbog and Sogod, Liloan, Cabalian and Hinundayan.\n\nA move to create Sogod an independent \"pueblo\" was pushed by the \"tenientes del barrio\" [equivalent to a village chairman] and nobilities of Sogod, Maak and Buntuk. On January 15, 1853, the leaders of the three \"visitas\" met at Sogod and passed a resolution petitioning the creation of a new municipality. They resolved further the location of the \"poblacion\" to be placed at Sogod because of its central location. Signatories to this resolution were: Gabriel Bilisa (now spelled as \"Belleza\") Apolonio Cabeti, Atanacio Cabilin, Martin Cajoles, Francisco Catibag, Angelito Cavales (now spelled as \"Cabales\"), Eulogio Cavales, Juan Cavales, Pedro Cavales, Enero Cegales (now spelled as \"Segales\"), Octabiano Cabog, Eugenio Capoli (now spelled as \"Kapuli\"), Luciano Capoli, Serafin Capoli, German Catajoy, Oliveros Cereso (some families spelled it as \"Tereso\" or \"Teriso\"), Vicente Cereso, Gregorio Cororosa, Firmin Javier, Selverio Javier and Antonio Prima, all from Sogod; Demetrio Balinas (now spelled as \"Vallinas\"), Juan Barcelon, Antonio Coraorao, Anselmo Marguiso, Domingo Paulino and Miguel of Tubia of Buntuk; and Juan Dagaas of Maak.\n\nThe resolution was received by \"Don\" Jose Torres Busquet, the \"Alcalde Mayor\" [equivalent to a present-day provincial governor] of Leyte, who endorsed it for approval to \"Gobernador-General\" Antonio Urbiztondo y Villasis on April 30, 1853. Upon the recommendation of the \"Asesor General de Govierno\", Sogod was erected as a \"pueblo\" on June 10, 1853 by virtue of a superior approbation. Cabalian, which still remained a \"visita\" of Malitbog, was granted the same status only on September 15, 1860, and was made a parish on January 13, 1861. The \"gobernadorcillo\" [equivalent to a town mayor] of Malitbog, was notified by this proclamation through a letter from the \"alcalde mayor\" dated July 11, 1853. With this development, \"Don\" Juan Cavales was appointed as the first \"gobernadorcillo\" [equivalent to a town mayor] of Sogod, which then covers jurisdiction from the present barangay Higusoan, Tomas Oppus town to barangay Punta, Libagon.\n\n\"Don\" Antonio Prima succeeded Cavales as \"gobernadorcillo\" of Sogod during the 1855 elections. Under his administration were Eulogio Cavales as \"teniente\" 1, German Catajoy as \"juez de sementeros\", Vicente Canillo as \"juez de policia y ganados\", Martin Cajoles as \"teniente\" 2, and Francisco Catajoy and Domingo Calago as police officers. Prima and the rest of the council served the municipality until 1857.\n\nBy 1857, Don\" Eulogio Cavales assumed the position as \"gobernadorcillo\". During his time, the \"visita\" of Hipgasan [present-day barangay San Pedro] was established with Selverio Biliza, Victoriano Catajoy and Esteban Rana as \"cabezas de barangay\". Marcelo Baldonar, Domingo Paulino, Cornelio Tuvia and Soriano Udos were appointed \"cabezas de barangay\" of Buntuk. In Maak, the \"cabezas de barangay\" were Juan Dagaas and Manuel Dejarme while Pedro Espina and Gabriel Ydjao were appointed as \"cabezas de barangay\" of Libagon. It was during this period that Padre Don\" Mamerto Balit assisted \"Padre Don\" Apolinario Marecampo as \"cura\" [parish priest] of Malitbog, with residence in the \"visita\" of Banday [now the \"poblacion\" of Tomas Oppus town]. While \"Padre\" Marecampo administered the southern villages of Malitbog – San Isidro [now a village belonging to Tomas Oppus town], Tamulayag [now the \"poblacion\" of Padre Burgos town] and Triana [now the \"poblacion\" of Limasawa town] – \"Padre\" Balit was administering the northern \"visitas\" of Banday, Buntuk, Hipgasan, Sogod, Maak and Libagon.\n\nSogod remained an annex of the parish of Malitbog until May 14, 1866 when Spain approved the parochial position of the town. However, the order was again delayed for almost three years. It was on April 8, 1869, through a Diocesan decree, that the parish of Sogod was acknowledged by the Most Reverend Romualdo Ximeno Ballesteros, OSA, bishop of Cebu. During this period, the parish of Sogod comprises all the territories north of Malitbog excluding the \"visitas\" of Banday and San Isidro. The new parochial district was placed under the intercession of the \"La Purisima Concepcion de Maria\" with \"Padre Don\" Tomas Logroño, a native of Inabanga, Bohol, as the town’s first parish priest. One of the first Diocesan priests assigned in Leyte, he spearheaded the construction of a temporary chapel and rectory atop the ruins of the old Jesuit church. In the 1868 survey of the diocese of Cebu, the records of Sogod were still merged with Malitbog, numbering a total population of 12,262 Catholics, 417 Catholics exempted from taxation and 2,026 \"tributos\".\n\nBy March 1870, Don\" Gabriel Ydjao became the chief executive of Sogod and transferred the \"poblacion\" [town center] to Libagon. Since Ydjao was a native of that place, and probably because Sogod was far from his residence, he renamed Libagon as Sogod Nuevo (other historical accounts stated that Libagon was renamed Sogod Sur) and Sogod as Sogod Viejo (Sogod Norte\"). Ydjao also appealed to the parish curate, \"Padre\" Logronio, to transfer the parish church in Libagon, a year after Sogod was made a parish. The parish church of Sogod would remain in Libagon until January 1924, when a group of concerned Sogodnons plead to the diocese of Calbayog to return the seat of the parish in Sogod. A canonical approval was issued by the Most Reverend Sofronio Hacbang Gaborni, the diocesan bishop of Calbayog.\n\nAfter Ydjao, \"Don\" Patricio Tubia, the former \"teniente del barrio\" of Buntuk, became the new \"gobernadorcillo\" in the 1876 elections. He served the town until 1878. By 1883, the \"sitio\" of Consolacion was created as a \"visita\" of Sogod Nuevo [Sogod Sur] and prospered through the influence of the Veloso family, who settled in the area in the early 1880s. By this time, the number of \"visitas\" of Sogod grew to six (6) \"barrios\": Buntuk, Hipgasan, Sogod Viejo [Sogod \"poblacion\"], Consolacion and Maak with Sogod Nuevo as the seat of government and parish.\n\nDon\" Nicolas Idjao won the position of \"gobernadorcillo\" in the 1885 elections with Gabino Ellacer as \"teniente\" 2, Antonio Reyes as \"juez de sementeros\", Rufino Espina as \"juez de policia\", Ramon Espina as \"juez de ganados\", Vicente Pajuyo as \"teniente\" 2 and Catalino Encinas as \"juez\". The \"alguacils\" [municipal council or councilors] were Julian Endriga, Raymundo Escobillas, Magdaleno Endriga and Pedro Ermogina. In the \"visita\" of Maak, Domingo Javier became the \"teniente del barrio\", Gregorio Deberal as \"juez\" and Cirilo Banal and Evaristo Paña as police officers. Eleuterio Faelnar became the \"teniente del barrio\" of Sogod Viejo and Hipgasan with Mauro Catajoy and Potenciano Espina as \"juezes\", and Jose Singson and Ariston Meole (now spelled as \"Miole\") as police officers. Florentino Flores became the \"teniente del barrio\" of Buntuk with Francisco Cabilin and Fabian Ballena as \"juezes\", and Dionisio Resma and Victor Jomor as police officers. By 1887, Don\" Eleuterio Falenar, who once served as the \"teniente del barrio\" of Sogod Viejo, assumed as \"gobernadorcillo\".\nBrief information of the \"visitas\" under the parish of Sogod was accounted in the 1886 diocesan summary of \"Padre\" Felipe Redondo Sendino. Of the six (6) \"barrios\", three are considered \"visitas\". The chapels in these villages has attached interim rectories constructed out of light materials:\n\n\nThe census also accounted the geographical location of the town, stating the relocation of the town center to Libagon from the original site in barangay Zone III:\"The town of Sogod is located on the shore of the great inlet of Malitbog to the south of the island of Leyte, in the western coast of the said inlet and adjoins Cabalian on the east with the island of Panaon further south, some three hours away. The town of Malitbog in the south-west is two-to-three-hour crossing through the said inlet… The old [site] of Sogod [barangay Zone III]… was situated at the end of a great inlet where the ruins of the walls of coral stone and lime mortar masonry of the \"iglesia\" [church] during the Jesuit period, are still preserved. Presently, the \"poblacion\" of this town [barangays Jubas and Talisay in Libagon town] is transferred some three (3) leagues from that one in the western coast of the same inlet.\"The 1886 parish church in Libagon, dedicated to the \"La Purisima Concepcion de Maria\", was provisional, made out of light materials. Built during the curacy of \"Padre\" Logroño, the structure measured fifty-two (52) \"varas\" [45.36 meters] long, seven (7) \"varas\" [5.88 meters] wide, and four (4) \"varas\" [3.36 meters] high. Like the church, the rectory was of \"nipa\" and bamboo, but in a dilapidated state. It measures twenty-five (25) \"varas\" [21 meters] long and three (3) \"varas\" [2.52 meters] high. Entrenched with live trees as fences, the cemetery has a measurement of forty-eight (48) \"varas\" [40.32 meters] long and forty-seven (47) \"varas\" [39.48 meters] wide. Prior to Father Logroño’s 1882 transfer to the parish of Macrohon, he was replaced by \"Padre Don\" Ramon Abarca in 1882.\n\nThe church was later destroyed after the Japanese Imperial Army burned it during World War II. By the 1950s, the structure was rebuilt in modern architecture, slightly smaller than the original. The parishioners tried to reposition the original columns of the church. The structure was so firm that the workers had to severe the posts from the surface. Presently, much of the church interiors and facade are completely remodeled from the original construction.\n\nA narrative shows the 1886 construction of the church of Libagon:“As commonly practiced in the past, the construction of the church,… convent and the town hall was made possible through \"bayanihan\", a spirit of communal unity or effort to do a particular goal. A resident of proper age can volunteer, at least a day in a week to a month. to help and work in the [community]. [Every] Saturday, the volunteers, or the loggers, would trek the mountains, scouting for timber which will be used for the church pillars, walls... The rainforest mountains of Libagon were then abundant with \"Narra (pterocarpus)\", \"Molave (vitex parviflora)\", White \"Lauan (shorea contorta)\" trees... After which, the volunteers would fasten every end of the logs with ropes and drag them down to the town center. In like manner, another group of volunteers were in charge of guiding the frequency and synchronicity of all those volunteers hauling timber and howled, \"“Hiboy!...\"\" Each of them brought with them their own food and coconut wine known as \"tuba\" stored in a \"baler\" shell or bamboo container... Aside from timber, the church’s foundation were made of crushed rocks, stones and sand that were hauled and made into huge bricks framed as walls. The stone walls stood nearly at five (5) to six (6) feet tall and laid on top with lumber that continued up to the ceiling. The groundwork for every column was deep and durable. As cement, the workers used stones and sand daubed with whipped egg whites mixed with lime to reinforce the pillars. The floor tiles were imported from Barcelona, Spain. The belfry stood high with three large church bells. Each piece, when rang, upended and plunged causing a loud sound that can be heard as far as San Isidro, Banday, and the entire Sogod Bay.\"\nFrom 1889 to 1891, \"Don\" Cipriano Lebiste (now spelled as \"Leviste\") became the \"gobernadorcillo\" of Sogod. The members of the municipal council under Lebiste's administration were Eugenio Destrisa (some families spelled it as \"Destreza\" or \"Destriza\"), Felix Entino, Magdaleno Dagaas, Catalina Idjao, Pedro Bellesa, Patricio Tubia, Victoriano Godes, Lucio Dagas and Agustin Ballina.\n\nWhen \"Don\" Luis Espina became \"gobernadorcillo\" from 1891 to 1893, the municipal council was composed of Buenaventura Gimenes (now spelled as \"Jimenez\"), Bernardo Endriga and Damaso Amongan as \"subalterno tenientes\" and Anastacio Ylan, Calexto Montanes, Protacio Elejorde and Carlos Ymluna (some families spelled it as \"Encluna\" or \"Enclona\") as police officers. During Espina’s incumbency, the \"visita\" of Maak was reduced to a \"sitio\" of \"barrio\" Consolacion with Antonio Cañete as the \"teniente\" 1, Gregorio Debera (now spelled as \"De Vera\" or \"De Veyra\") as \"teniente\" 2, Rosales Bonot and Leoncio Cocido as \"juezes\"; and Eugenio Demosmog and Pantaleon Dejarme as police officers. With Maak’s status being demoted, Sogod Viejo was also placed under the jurisdiction of the \"visita\" of Hipgasan with Crispulo Cabales as \"teniente\" 1, Domingo Bellesa as \"teniente\" 2, Mauro Catajoy as \"juez\" 1, Tranquilino Dagohoy as \"juez\" 2, and Victoriano Camba and Juan Javier as police officers. In Buntuk, Felipe Aguilar and Felix Entino assumed the position of \"tenientes\" 1 and 2 while Graciano Samaño and Antonio Arguelles were designated as \"juezes\" and Leoncio Resma as police officer.\n\nBy 1893, Sogod was again headed by \"Don\" Nicolas Idjao with Crisante Pajuyo, Dimas Yndico (now spelled as \"Endico\"), Macario Ylang and Mauricio Sembrano as \"tenientes\", Patricio Tubia as \"juez de sementeras\", Luis Espina became the \"juez de ganados\", Buenaventura Gimenez as \"juez de policia\", and Felipe Paitan, Pedro Ralo, Enrique Tiguetigue and Fruto Egina as police officers.\n\nThe latter years of Hispanic colonization of Sogod witnessed three (3) nationwide armed struggles: the Philippine revolution (1896–1898), the Spanish–American War (1898) and the Philippine–American War (1899–1902). The \"Katipunan\" movement, which Andres Bonifacio founded, had encouraged Filipino commoners from Luzon, Visayas and northern Mindanao to raise arms for independence. There were anti-Spanish skirmishes in Manila, Cebu, Negros, Ilocos, Batangas and Pampanga after Doctor Jose Rizal's execution on December 30, 1896.\n\nSocial unrest in Leyte was not relatively ferment as in Manila and other provinces in the country. The situation in the island province was that it was generally peaceful and most of the dominating local officials were reluctant to join the revolution. The \"Katipunan\" had only secure autonomy to Leyte when Catalino Tarcela resigned as \"gobernadorcillo\" of Tacloban and replaced Gabriel Galza, a \"peninsulares\" [a Philippine-born Spaniard], as governor of Leyte in 1898.\n\nThe next year, General Ambrocio Mojica replaced General Vicente Lukban as the designated expeditionary chief and governor of Leyte and reestablished the government system in the municipalities. The general also organized guerilla warfare against the Americans and transferred the provincial capital to Palo. The town of Sogod, with Libagon as the functioning town center, was under the fourth military zone which comprises the towns from Maasin to Hinunangan with Lieutenant Mariano Pacheco as the commander of the entire district. A known strategist and pacifier, he was successful in defending Maasin through a naval combat and attacking an American detachment in Malitbog in 1900, which earned him the rank as captain. These accomplishments brought the respect from the revolutionary leaders of Maasin, Malitbog, Sogod-Libagon, Liloan-Panaon, Cabalian and Hinundayan. All guerilla activities in Sogod were headed by Ladislao Decenteceo and the members of the Idjao clan. As a response, the Americans garrisoned the \"barrio\" of Consolacion\".\" However, all these struggles were no match against the superior force of the invaders.\n\nWith the surrender of Mojica and the capture of Lukban, the revolutionary commanders of Leyte finally sided with the Americans in the middle of 1902. The new government delegated \"Don\" Benito Faelnar as \"presidente municipal\" after the mayoral position of Sogod was vacant from 1897 to 1903. During his administration, Faelnar reinstated the \"poblacion\" to Sogod. By this year, Sogod had a total population of 4,055 inhabitants, 1,011 of whom were registered voters while Libagon had 4,642 inhabitants with an electorate of 1,073 voters.\n\nProtestantism came to Leyte in 1903 when Reverend Doctor Charles Rath and a group of American missionaries belonging to the Presbyterian Church acquired a church lot in Tacloban. They began a massive campaign in the island, having a stronghold over the towns of Baybay, Maasin, Padre Burgos, Cabalian and Hinunangan. By the mid-1930s, Reverend Rath and a number of newly-baptized Leyteño Presbyterians made a number of converts from Buntuk, Sogod, Consolacion and from the \"sitios\" of Libagon. These believers would lay the very foundation of the present-day United Church of Christ in the Philippines (UCCP), the first Protestant church to be established in the municipality, and would attract more Protestant sects and denominations to the towns of Sogod bay region.\n\nDon\" Ladislao Decenteceo, who has already pledged his allegiance to the Insular Government of the Philippine Islands, won against the reelection bid of Faelnar during the 1904 elections and transferred again the town center to \"barrio\" Consolacion, his residence. The voting process was done by whispering the name of a candidate of the voter's choice to the municipal secretary. While Don\" Dionisio Labata became the first municipal mayor who won the first election thru balloting in 1905.\n\nDuring the mayoral administration of \"Don\" Gregorio Leviste (1908–1912), the municipal territory of Sogod comprises the \"barrios\" of Bontoc, Buac, Concepcion, Consolacion, Gakat, Hipgasan, Libagon, Libas, Maak, Mayuga, Kawayan, Nahulid, Pandan, San Isidro (Malupao), San Miguel (Batang), Sogod \"poblacion\", Santa Cruz and Union, which were grouped into seven (7) districts. Each district, with its respective \"barrios\" were under the care of a municipal councilor. Education was the main concern of this period and that the municipal government sent Sotero Toting, Ignacio Chavarria and a person named Sumaya to Tacloban to urge teachers from the capital to teach in Sogod. The first teacher to arrive in Sogod was Pelagia Tibay, who arrived in town on April 1911. On May of the same year, Hugo Rojas and Jesus Pedrosa were the first batch of municipal scholars attending the Leyte Normal School in Tacloban. As the number of school children increases, the town officials saw that the only Gabaldon building of the Sogod Central School, located in the present barangay of Zone I, was too small to house them. The municipal council therefore resolved it by voting to make the municipal hall as transient school building for the students.\n\nThe tenure of Leviste also marked the titling of the barangays of Sogod, which occurred on July 1911. In a joint session held at Sogod on September 20, 1911, the boundary between the towns of Sogod and Liloan was fixed by both municipal councils. A boundary marker was fixed at Malaa River and a resolution was signed by the councilors of the two towns. Transportation during this period was through boat since there were no existing road networks in southern Leyte. Vessels like the \"MV Bongao\", \"MV Malitbog\" and \"MV Mindoro\" would ferry passengers from Tacloban to Sogod.\n\nWith the restoration of the \"poblacion\" to Sogod in 1912, the \"barrio\" of Libagon was converted into a municipality on October 16, 1913. The areas from barangay Gakat to barangay Punta formed part of the municipal district of Libagon. The municipal mayor of Sogod during this development was \"Don\" Vicente Cariño (1912–1916). Mariano Espina, who was then a member of the municipal council of Sogod and the main mover of the resolution to make Libagon into a separate township, as appointed as first town executive of Libagon.\n\nDuring the Philippine–American War of 1900s, Don\" Estanislao Flores became one of the guerrilla surrenderrees in 1902. He was also designated as one of the second lieutenants, together with Victor Montederamos of Libagon, of the Leyte southern division which spans from Maasin to Silago. A native of barangay Consolacion, he ran for the mayoral position of Sogod in 1917 and again relocated the town hall to his village for a short period of time. By 1920, Don\" Floro Espina was elected as the chief executive of the town. Flores again regains the position in 1923 and administered Sogod until 1925. From 1926 onwards, the municipality was governed by Don\" Filomeno Mercado (1926–1931) and Don\" Gervacio Cadavos (1938–1940).\n\nFollowing the successful invasions of China, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the Southeast Asian region, Imperial Japan occupied the Philippines from 1942 to 1944. The Japanese military authorities immediately began organizing a new government structure in the Philippines. Although the Japanese had promised independence for the archipelago after occupation, they initially organized a Council of State through which they directed civil affairs until October 1943, when the empire declared the Philippines an independent republic. Most of the Philippine elite, with a few notable exceptions, served under the Japanese. The puppet republic was headed by President Jose Laurel.\n\nThe Japanese did not reinforce the island province of Leyte until 1943 because they saw that it lacked raw materials that would establish a base for their soldiers. This means that the local resistance forces in Leyte were able to establish numerically ahead since the official surrender of the Philippines in April 1942. Nonetheless, the Japanese Army was still able to garrison the municipalities of Ormoc and Tacloban as their bases of operations in Leyte even if the remaining pockets of resistance tactically attacked these localities until 1944.\n\nGeographically, Sogod was hardly accessed through land due to the lack of roads resulting in the scanty presence of Japanese forces in the area. The situation made the guerillas more organized compared to other municipalities in Leyte which were led by the former United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE) members Lieutenant Sergio Nuqui and Captain Francisco, both under the leadership of Colonel Ruperto Kangleon. However, with the Church silent and the absence of a strong centralized civil government, political disputes, corruption and allegiance marred most of the Japanese rule of Sogod.\n\nPrior to the war, Severino Macasocol won the local elections of December 1940 as municipal mayor. against his political rival Cadio, an ex-USAFFE member. The bitter rivalry between the two that continued after the elections brought tragic events in the political situation of Sogod. It was reported that Macasocol, as well as the municipal vice mayor, Pablo Maglinte, were murdered around June 1942. These murders were presumably ordered by Cadio. Since that event happened, Sogod no longer had chief local officials to administer the welfare of the townspeople. To solve this problem, prominent citizens assembled and nominated the former chief of police Hospicio Labata to assume the mayoral office.\n\nThe people of Sogod passed a resolution requesting the Japanese garrison in the town of Malitbog to appoint Hospicio Labata as mayor and Victorino Mercado as vice mayor after consulting Lieutenant Nuqui. According to local historians, this is a strange case of having both the guerillas and the occupying forces agreeing on the appointment of a mayor. In August 1942, Nuqui’s troops successfully expelled the Japanese out of the \"poblacion\" giving them the full support of the civilians. This situation gave the guerillas the opportunity to gather in November 1942 in Inopacan convened by the American officer Chester Peter, which led to a bloody encounter between the troops of Blas Miranda and Ruperto Kangleon due to their personal grudges. The northern and southern guerilla forces attempted to convene another unification talk in January 1943 led by Alejandro Balderian. This event officially made Kangleon the Military Advisor for these groups.\n\nBut after a year, during the celebration of the town fiesta in December 8, 1943, the Japanese returned and reorganized the municipal government. Instead of appointing Labata, they chose Mercado to be the mayor of the town. The reason behind this action is unknown but it can be assumed that the Japanese knew Labata’s connection with the guerillas. According to a 1961 interview of Lieutenant Lapulapu Mondragon, a former guerilla, Mercado and Labata were taken to Tacloban on January 9, 1944, through a motorboat carrying the mayors of southern Leyte, where the Japanese-sponsored provincial governor, Bernardo Torres and acting governor Pastor Salazar persuaded Labata to whole-heartedly cooperate and implement Japanese policies.\n\nDue to their persuasion, Labata fully cooperated with the Japanese and performed his duties to their favor to pacify the townspeople. After the war, Central Intelligence Command (CIC) investigations pointed out in their interview with Geronimo Ruiz, a municipal councilor of Sogod, that Labata was indeed a rascal who only finished third or fourth grade education. Being an unschooled man, he was seen to be an abusive official even during the time when he was appointed as chief of police but was eventually discharged due to bribery. Example of his evildoing during the Japanese occupation was the assassination of Mayor Mercado who made contact with the guerillas. CIC documents stated that Labata killed the mayor by the order of the Japanese in Sogod. Labata gained again the post of mayor but he had numerous enemies in Sogod who attempted to kill him due to his cruelty such as ordering the public execution of Volunteer Guards in June 1944. He also confiscated the fishes of residents and sold these to the Japanese so that they will not be able to aid the guerillas.\n\nAt the end of the war, Mayor Hospicio Labata was charged with (16) counts of treason and was sentenced to life imprisonment. He appealed to the court. After a careful review of the case, Labata was acquitted because of the lack of two witnesses to prove whether he really ordered the arrest of guerillas that led to their execution. In May 1945, the guerilla organizer Francisco Villamor was appointed as the postwar mayor of the town because of his popularity in fighting Labata’s collaboration.\n\nThe newly created municipality was governed by duly elected \"Gobernadorcillos\", \"Presidente Municipales\" and Municipal Mayors like:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe town covered a total land area of 236.4 square kilometers (91.3 square miles) until 1953. Due to the enactment of Republic Act No. 522 on June 15, 1950, which establishes the municipality of Bontoc, the municipal area of Sogod decreased. However, the newly ordained act was proven to be lax in nature. The juridical boundaries of the town of Bontoc were not fully indicated, causing much tension between the two municipalities. After the 1959 promulgation of the Executive Order No. 368, all conflicting areas between the municipalities of Sogod and Bontoc were reorganized and reevaluated. Many complaints and petitions were sent to the Provincial Board of Southern Leyte and to the Regional Trial Court (RTC) to reconcile the disputed villages to Sogod, but all were in vain. As a result, the land area of the municipality was reduced to 19,270 hectares (47,600 acres) in land area.\n\nWith the coordinates of 10°23'10 North Longitude and 124°58'48 East Latitude, Sogod is situated in the northern portion of the province of Southern Leyte and in the south-central side of Leyte Island, facing the Sogod Bay. It is approximately 72 kilometers east from the city of Maasin, the provincial capital of Southern Leyte; 127 kilometers south from Tacloban City, the regional center of Eastern Visayas and the provincial capital of Leyte; 106 kilometers from Ormoc City, a port city on the north-western coast of Leyte.\nThe town is bounded by the municipality of Mahaplag, approximately 38 kilometers northbound via the Maharlika Highway; in the east are the municipalities of Silago, Hinunangan, and Saint Bernard; in the southeast is the municipality of Libagon, about 22 kilometers eastbound via the national highway; facing to the south is Sogod Bay, the only water form that divides the province from west to east; 6 kilometers south-west lies the municipality of Bontoc; in the west are the towns of Bato, Hindang, Hilongos, and Inopacan.\n\nThe Mahaplag-Sogod mountain rim is the boundary line of the two provinces of Leyte and Southern Leyte. Two bridges in \"sitio\" Balintulay, barangay Kahupian serve as markers for the boundary. In the east and west sides of the municipality are much similar to the north. The slopes serve as barricades from the municipalities facing the eastern Pacific region. Every rainy season, frequent landslips would mar the soil condition of upland barangays causing the feeder roads to be impassable. The southern part is bordered by rivers and creeks. The Santa Cruz Creek serves as a demarcation line between the towns of Bontoc and Sogod. Gakat Creek functions as boundary between Sogod and Libagon.\n\nThe municipality has flat-to-rolling plains in the southern part, with rivers crisscrossing the lowland. The rivers of Subangdaku and San Francisco are the major waterways of the town. The headwaters of these rivers are located at the Leyte Cordillera. The rivers flow southward from the villages of Kahupian, Pancho Villa, San Francisco Mabuhay and San Juan to its mouth at the Sogod Bay near the Sogod poblacion.\n\nNumerous springs are located in the town. Some of them are situated in barangay Consolacion, Hibod-Hibod, Kahupian, Lum-an, Pancho Villa, and San Juan. The Magaupas Spring in barangay Pandan and Banat-e Spring in barangay San Pedro supplies the water needs of the Sogodnons.\n\nRugged peaks covered the town’s northern area. These slopes are dotted with thick rain forests which served as habitat for rare species of flora and fauna, like the Philippine Eagle and Tarsier. Of the twenty-four mountains in Southern Leyte province, five are located in Sogod. These are the mountains of Bitanhuan (3,169 feat/966 meters), Cagbano (725 feet/221 meters), Capuloan (2,583 feet/787 meters), Llave (2,583 feet/787 meters) and Panjongon (1,259 feet/384 meters).\n\nRecently, two new species of frogs belonging to the genus \"Platymantis\" were discovered specifically inhabiting the montane and mossy forests of the Nacolod Mountain Range (the Hinunangan-Silago-Sogod corridor of the Leyte Cordillera) in Southern Leyte. Both species differ markedly from other known species of Philippine Platymantis frogs by their body size, coloration patterns, and advertisement calls. The two species are allied to two different species groups, the \"Platymantisguentheri\" group and \"Platymantishazelae\" group. This is the first time that a \"Platymantis\" species belonging to the \"Hazelae\" group has been discovered in Mindanao faunal region, of which the island of Leyte belongs to.\n\nThere are three mountain ranges that separates the municipality from the other towns of the province, these are: Baybay-Maasin Cordillera, the Abuyog-Liloan Cordillera and Mahaplag mountain range.\n\nBeing a coastal town, the bay that divides the province into two regions is named after Sogod. Of all the municipalities comprising the province of Southern Leyte, the municipality has the shortest shoreline.\n\nSubangdaku is the largest river in the province of Southern Leyte that empties into Sogod Bay. Based on the physical description of rivers done by the Ateneo de Naga University, Subangdaku is considered a braided river since there are several channels that divide and reunite forming an alluvial fan with very wide floodplain. Sediments of various sizes are deposited in this floodplain every typhoon season, causing the river to swell. The larger materials are deposited first while the finest materials such as silt and clay are deposited last as the river moves towards its mouth to meet the sea, which is seen as a natural occurrence.\n\nThe town center of Sogod and a number of barangays along the banks of Subangdaku were reportedly affected by a strong flood similar to that experienced with Typhoon Amy in 1951. Typhoon Amy had the strength and volume of water that caused sediments of various sizes to roll downstream sweeping away several villages, vegetation, and farm animals. After the typhoon, logs were seen floating in Sogod Bay together with dead bodies. For months, the people of Sogod and the surrounding villages did not eat fish caught from the bay.\n\nRecent typhoons did not result to the terrible destruction brought about by Typhoon Amy. Flooding happens only every heavy rains. Some of the destroyed agricultural lands were reclaimed by local people when some of the portion of Subangdaku dried out as a result of quarrying and rechanneling activities. The river has been known to meander along its course, ever changing its way over time.\n\nExploitation\n\nFor years, following the floodings of the river, Subangdaku created an issue over the province. The quarrying in the area became rampant and destructive. After many attempts of conserving the site, the issue remained unsolved until today.\n\nThe Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) recommended to the Southern Leyte Governor Oscar Tan, for the rechannelling of the river in order to \"“redirect the flow of water straight to the bridge\" (present Subangdaku Bridge in barangay Suba) \"waterway.”\" A permit was granted to Shemberg with the \"“objective of rechannelling the meandering Subangdaku River, thereby protecting the existing infrastructure, the lives and properties of Sogodnons”\" on July 13, 1993. Rechannelling was commenced shortly after. In 1998, a group of Sogodnons complained about the destruction in the river allegedly due to the quarrying operations of Shemberg. Supporting papers in 1998 backed the continued rechannelling operations of said company, thus quarrying and rechanneling activities were resumed.\n\nShemberg-Rockland Marketing Corporation was granted an Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC) by the Regional Department of Environment of Natural Resources (DENR-8), through the Mines and Geosciences Bureau (MGB-8), to conduct quarrying operations in the river. Although the ECC allowed them to extract 60,000 cubic meters per year (ECC was granted on June 25, 1993), some sectors believed that what was extracted from the river was more than this amount. For instance, it was alleged that small operators and local residents also collect sand and gravel and sell them to Shemberg. By June 5, 1998, MGB-8 issued a renewal of permit (SAG No. IP-98-011) to Shemberg Marketing Corporation (SMC) allowing it to extract 350,000 cubic meters for five years, renewable for the same period and volume. This amount has increased by 10,000 cubic meters annually. Aside from Shemberg, there were also other operators that extracted sand and gravel, such as Reeline Commercial Aggregates and a Gaudencio Ang.\n\nOn December 12, 2001, Typhoon Nanang damaged a road shoulder in barangay San Miguel. Shemberg, however, denies responsibility for the destruction. The company reports that the total concession area of Shemberg is only 19 hectares which occupies about 2 kilometers of the river and that its “upstream boundary is located near the concrete structure, at the bend of San Miguel and is approximately 300 meters downstream of the newly collapsed road pavement.”\n\nThe Save Subangdaku Movement (SSDM) requested for assistance from the people hearing mass at the Immaculate Conception of Mary Parish during the celebration of the patronal fiesta on December 15, 2001. While the local officials blamed the rechannelization project of the government and uncontrolled quarrying of gravel and sand at the side of river as the cause of the flood. At a meeting on March 18, 2002, a government agency alleged that the reason of the incidents of flood and other environmental problems in the river was due to the Philippine Fault System which caused rocks to rumble down. However, the reason was contended because the fault is a geological feature and environmental problems in the province just occurred that time.\n\nIn response, the Institute for Environmental Conservation and Research (INECAR) team visited Sogod in May 20–23 and September 2–3, 2002 to investigate the alleged impacts of quarrying in the river. Some of the local residents, the SSDM in particular, feared that the cause of the destruction of a portion of the road in barangay San Miguel was quarrying. They were also worried that the present destruction is a prelude to a larger destruction that will affect the town of Sogod itself and adjacent villages when the rainy and typhoon season comes.\n\nThe team identified the probable reasons why the roadslip and erosion occurred in barangay San Miguel: a) increased in energy upstream as a result of rechanneling downstream and b) the river has been fragmented by quarrying operations creating channels that are directed towards the area of the barangay concerned.\n\nThe provincial government pushed for immediate rechanneling of Subangdaku considering that the river has been tagged by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR-8) as very susceptible to flash floods. The restoration led to the construction of dikes along the barangays of Suba, San Isidro, San Miguel and Inmaculada Concepcion in 2007.\n\nAn irrigation dam was constructed beneath the Subangdaku Bridge I in Barangay Suba to control the flow of the current to the farmlands in the south-eastern portion of the municipality. However, the dam was destroyed after strong river currents breached the infrastructure in January 2011.\n\nThe Subangdaku Bridge II was inaugurated in March 2013, connecting it to barangay San Miguel and barangay Inmaculada Concepcion. It was seen as a solution to cut the travel time from Maasin City to the rest of the province.\n\nToday\n\nThe provincial government is seeking for the immediate suspension of two-decade-old quarrying operation in the river after numerous violations done by the permit holders. Last August 20, 2013, Governor Roger Mercado told the press that the government is \"\"waiting for the complete assessment report from the Mines and Geosciences Bureau (MGB) and Environmental Management Bureau (EMB).\"\"\n\nThe suspension of sand and gravel extraction of Subangdaku will give way to delineation of the areas as part of the revised rechanneling plan. Extractors are to resume operations after implementing the rechanneling plan, under the supervision of the Provincial Environment and Natural Resources Office (PENRO).\n\nThe governor added that the Cebu-based Shemberg Marketing Corporation \"\"keep on renewing from MGB-8 since 1993.\"\" The quarrying firm never sought an approval from the provincial governor and committed a grave violation under existing environmental laws and the local government code.\n\nRecords of the MGB regional office showed that as of June 2013, there are two existing sand and gravel industrial permits. Shemberg Marketing Corporation has the biggest concession area at 19 hectares. Selena Salas, a permit holder from Cebu City were given go signal to quarry in 12.53 hectares. There are two pending application for sand and gravel industrial permits in the area. These local firms are owned by Emily Chiongbian and Rodolfo Gervacio with a combined proposed extraction area of 13.73 hectares.\n\nDespite of the clarion for suspension, MGB clarified that the provincial government of Southern Leyte has no authority to suspend quarrying operations along Subangdaku. The latter can only recommend for suspension of sand and gravel extraction but it has to be approved by the MGB regional office. The office also added that the permit holders have no violations.\n\nSogod is situated at the head of Sogod Bay. The bay, home to a variety of fishes, provided food and livelihood to the people of Sogod and nearby municipalities.\n\nThe Subangdaku River is a major tributary of the bay, emptying into the bay at the municipality of Sogod. Much of the bay's ecology has been disturbed due to human activity, ranging from quarrying and rechanneling to improper waste management.\n\nThe enactment of the Republic Act No. 522 on June 15, 1950, granted the creation of the municipality of Bontoc, a village situated six (6) kilometers west from Sogod. But it was on July 29, 1950, that Bontoc was formally inaugurated as a fully pledged municipality. In the latter times of the Spanish colonization, Bontoc was already a functioning village of Sogod with a status of a visita (barrio with chapel) around 1886.\n\nThe Republic Act included the villages of Bontoc, Divisoria, Union, Paku, Beniton, Catmon, Hilaan, Taa, Santa Cruz, and Mahayahay, which were under the political jurisdiction of Sogod, to be part of the municipality of Bontoc. The problem was that the boundaries between the two towns were not “well-defined” and the majority of the people residing in Bontoc preferred to have their transactions in Sogod. Much worse when the \"municipio\" (town hall) in Sogod began exacting taxation and jurisdiction from the barangays mentioned in the Republic Act 522 in which falls under the area of the local government unit (LGU) of Bontoc.\n\nIn June 17, 1952, the provincial board of Leyte issued the holding of a plebiscite among the villages of Pangi, Taa, Santa Cruz, Tuburan, Lawgawan and their corresponding \"sitios\" (hamlets). The purpose of such activity is to determine whether the people in these \"barrios\" would like to remain with the municipality of Sogod or with Bontoc. The plebiscite was conducted on August 1, 1952, and the results show that more votes were cast in favor of Sogod than those in favor of Bontoc.\n\nAfter seven years, the controversy was recommended by the provincial board of Leyte to Manila for the amendment of Republic Act No. 522 to include the villages of Baugo, Himakilo, Esperanza, Hibagwan, Pamahawan, Mahayahay, Bunga, Dao and Maoylab to the municipal jurisdiction of Bontoc. At that time, a series of Republic Acts were approved and enacted to make \"sitios\" into barangays in the province of Leyte.\n\nOne interesting feature of the said development is that the provincial board of Leyte recommended to Manila that the villages of Lawgawan, Taa, Tuburan, Santa Cruz and Pangi, equidistant to the \"poblacion\" of Sogod, be annexed to the municipal jurisdiction of Sogod. The proposal got the support of President Carlos Polestico Garcia and approved the move to include the newly established barangays, located in the hinterlands of Bontoc, to be part of the territorial jurisdiction of the municipality of Bontoc. After the 1959 promulgation of the Executive Order No. 368, all conflicting areas between the municipalities of Sogod and Bontoc were reorganized and reevaluated. Many complaints and petitions were sent to the Provincial Board of Southern Leyte and to the Regional Trial Court (RTC) to reconcile the disputed villages to Sogod, but all were in vain.\n\nOn July 18, 1960, the Provincial Board of Southern Leyte permanently suspends implementation of Executive Order 368. The board conducted a plebiscite in the barrios and sitios affected by Executive Order 368 and to finally settle the boundary dispute.\n\nOn June 24, 1970, the municipality of Sogod filed Civil Case No. R-1706 for certiorari and prohibition with the Court of First Instance of Southern Leyte (now Regional Trial Court), to enjoin the provincial board and provincial governor from taking cognizance of the long pending boundary dispute between the two municipalities and to enjoin the municipality of Bontoc from exercising territorial jurisdiction over the barrios of Pangi, Taa, Casao, Santa Cruz, Tuburan and Lawgawan all allegedly belonging to the municipality of Sogod.\n\nOn August 31, 1973, the trial court dismissed the action for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case.\n\nPresidente Carlos P. Garcia promulgated Executive Order No. 368, which approved the recommendation of the provincial board of Leyte and reconstituted the barrios and sitiosunder the territorial dispute between the two municipalities with Granada Creek as its boundary line, on December 28, 1959.\n\nHowever, on July 14, 1960, then Executive Secretary Castillo sent a telegram to the Provincial Board of Southern Leyte which states as follows:\n\nThe Provincial Board of newly established Southern Leyte passed \"Resolution No. 62\" suspending the implementation of \"Executive Order 368\" on July 18, 1960. The board also created a committee to conduct the holding of a plebiscite in the \"barrios\" and \"sitios\" affected by the Executive Order and to finally settle the boundary dispute.\n\nOn June 24, 1970, the municipality of Sogod filed \"Civil Case No. R-1706\" for certiorari and prohibition with the Court of First Instance of Southern Leyte (now Regional Trial Court [RTC]), to enjoin the provincial board and provincial governor from taking cognizance of the long pending boundary dispute between the two municipalities and to enjoin Bontoc town from exercising territorial jurisdiction over the said \"barrios\". However, the trial court dismissed the action for lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case on August 31, 1973.\n\nOn December 17, 1973, the trial court denied petitioner’s motion for reconsideration. Hence, this petition was filed alleging that the respondent judge acted with grave abuse of discretion in dismissing the case.\n\nThe average climate in Sogod presents a low mean seasonality in comparison to similar climates in other parts of the world. This means that, on average, seasons (whether hot or cold or dry or wet) are not marked. The mean monthly temperature ranges from 23.6 °C to 25.4 °C and Precipitation from 147 to 351 millimeters/month.\n\nAccording to the Coronas Classification, the main \nclimate classification system used in the Philippines, \nthe largest part of Sogod falls under Type II, which \ncharacterized by the absence of a dry season and \nmonths with the largest rainfalls between November \nand January. A small part of Sogod, \nthe western part of the province of Southern Leyte, \nfalls under Type IV and has an even more evenly \ndistributed rainfall throughout the year.\n\nThe local populace of Sogod is of Boholano and Cebuano descent with Cebuano as the major language spoken in the municipality. But most native speakers have Boholano \"(Bol-anon)\" intonation because of its proximity to Bohol province. Waray-Waray and Surigaonon are regarded as secondary languages. However, Tagalog is still the lingua franca when conversing to other ethnic groups.\n\nNatives also understood foreign languages such as English and Spanish.\n\nThe population of Sogod exceeded 45,000 during the 2015 Philippine National Census. Of about 3,382 inhabitants, Zone V is the most populous barangay in Sogod, followed by Zone III and Maac with the population of 1,934 inhabitants and 1,869 inhabitants, respectively. But the barangay with the lowest population is Lum-an, having a population of only 90 individuals; followed by Hindangan and Buac Daku with the population of 116 and 119.\n\nPandan, Rizal, San Jose, San Miguel, San Pedro, San Roque, Tampoong and Casao and Santa Cruz in Bontoc are the immigration barangays within the \"poblacion\". Mountain barangays such as Benit, Lum-an, Hindangan, Hipantag, Maria Plana and Santa Maria are experiencing a decline in population. Employment and livelihood lead the people from these villages to settle in the \"poblacion\" and in other urban centers in the province. The lack of road systems and infrastructures linking these villages to the town proper is one of the factors that attribute to this problem. This migratory pattern is called Rural Exodus. It is exacerbated when the population decline leads to the loss of rural services such as business enterprises and schools, which leads to greater loss of population as people leave to seek those features.\n\nThe majority of the population of Sogod belongs to the Roman Catholic Church, with a percentage of about 93%. Other Christian sects such as the Seventh-day Adventist Church, United Church of Christ in the Philippines (UCCP), Iglesia ni Cristo (INC), The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), Members Church of God International, Filipino Crusaders World Army (Moncados), Sogod Fundamental Baptist Church, Jehovah’s Witnesses, Christian and Missionary Alliance Churches of the Philippines (CAMACOP)-Sogod Alliance Church, Assemblies of God and among others, formed the remaining 7% of the census. Considered as one of the largest churches in the province, the Immaculate Conception Parish in barangay Rizal falls under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Maasin.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church is a deeply rooted institution in Sogod introduced and preached by the Jesuit missionaries in the early 1600s. Eventually, the town as made an independent parish through an episcopal decree in April 8, 1869 and was canonically approved by January 1924. Since 1967, the church in Sogod is divided into two parishes, namely:\n\nPresently, the town is the seat of the Vicariate of the Immaculate Conception, which is composed of six parishes.\n\nAccording to a 2008 parish-wide census, the Holy Child Parish of barangay Consolacion, Sogod has a total population of 12,261 inhabitants. The recorded Catholic population in the parish exceeds to 10,658 individuals. The remaining 1,603 individuals belong to other mainline Protestant denominations.\n\nBarangay Consolacion was established as an ecclesiastical district in 1967 by Bishop Teotimo Pacis, diocese of Palo. At present, the parish has maintained a number of mandated religious organizations which are active in the various fields of church apostolates, namely: Catholic Women's League, Legion of Mary, Catholic Charismatic Renewal Movement, and \"cofradias\" (confraternities) like the \"Birhen sa Lourdes\" (Our Lady of Lourdes), \"Sagrada Corazon\" (Sacred Heart), \"Inahan sa Kanunayng Panabang\" (Our Lady of Perpetual Help), San Jose (Saint Joseph) and San Antonio (Saint Anthony of Padua). Other organizations are the Knights of the Santo Niño (established by Father Oliver Edulan), Lay Ministers, Catechists, Catholic Faith Lay Apostolic Movement of the Philippines (CF-LAMP), Parish Emergency Action Team and the Knights of the Altar (KOA).\n\nFrom September 1992 to March 1993, the parish launched an intensive doctrinal and spiritual formation program through the Catholic Faith Lay Apostolic Movement of the Philippines (CF-LAMP), a local group tasked of defending the Catholic faith from proselytizing sects. This program has brought about remarkable conversations especially among the nominal and indifferent Catholics that the effects have been dubbed \"balik-Simbahan\". One of the fruits of this program is that the \"barrio\" faithful have also embarked on renovations and extensions of their respective chapels.\n\nAccording to a 2016 parish-wide census, the Immaculate Conception parish of Sogod has a total land area of 145.27 square miles. With a total population of 31,148 inhabitants, the recorded Catholic population in the parish exceeds to 27,449 individuals. The remaining 3,699 individuals belong to Islam and other mainline Protestant denominations. A proposed mission station, dedicated to Saint Lorenzo Ruiz, will be established at barangay Libas this 2018 to cater the pastoral and spiritual needs of the western villages of the town.\n\nAptly chosen as the patroness of the municipality as well by the community, the Immaculate Conception of Mary Parish of Sogod is the mother-parish of the ecclesiastical districts of barangay Divisoria, Bontoc (1995), Bontoc (1957), barangay Consolacion, Sogod (1967) and Libagon (1869/ reestablished in 1924).\n\nThe chuch structure was once constructed in barangay Zone III, made out of light materials during the time of Father Tomas Logroño. It remained there until the early 1930s, until it was moved to the new town hall site in barangay Zone I. Old parishioners recall that the building was made out of hardwood. Around the 1960s, a lot was donated in barangay Rizal for the construction of a concrete edifice, which is now the present church and rectory of Sogod.\n\nThe Immaculate Conception Parish of Sogod has a total number of forty-seven (47) BEC chapels, fifteen (15) of which are \"sitios\". Recently, the chapel community of \"sitio\" Layog, barangay Benit, has been merged with the mother chapel, Benit, due to the land condition of the hamlet: \n\nAt present, the municipality still relies much on the Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA) from the national government. However, it is worthwhile noting that local revenue collection has been increasing from year to year without passing a new revenue-raising ordinance. Sogod is now classified as a second class municipality.\n\nThe total Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA) share of Sogod for the fiscal year of 2012 was ₱64,820,215.00 and ₱24,200,000.00 for the local-sourced revenues that become one of the fastest growing economies in province.\n\nGaisano Capital Group, one of largest shopping mall chains in the country, opened its first branch in the province during the town’s 158th founding anniversary on June 10, 2011.\n\nManufacturing and trade\n\nManufacturing is small-scale: charcoal (burnt coconut shells or \"uling\"), \"abaca\" products, ceramics, coconut oil, furniture making, hollow block making, and gravel and sand. Export products are \"copra\", \"abaca\", \"abaca\" handicrafts and fiber craft items.\n\nMinerals\n\nAs of 1992, the province of Southern Leyte's metallic reserves totaled 771,830 metric tons. All of the municipalities and one city in the province have mineral deposits including Sogod. The town has magnesite, gold, silver and copper deposits. However, Sogod's mountains are unexplored and the soil is not suitable for mining due to soft clay surface.\n\nMetalworks\n\nExcept for blacksmithing, work is undertaken principally in the \"poblacion\" and in the \"barrios\" of Sogod, turning out working bolos, machete and steel fabrication of window grills and other household needs; metalwork for the past years changed but the old process in molding metals are still being used. The body repairs of vehicles are carried out by small metal shops, doubling as jack-of-all-trade. Metalwork is concerned with an accessory fabrication for pump boats that abound in the town's waters and building construction where steel had replaced the disappearing wood as housing material.\n\nTwo provincial newspapers are circulating in the town, these are the \"Southern Leyte Times\" (English) and the \"Southern Leyte Balita\" (Cebuano). The newspapers are based in the capital city of Maasin and gives accurate and constructive news in the province of Southern Leyte and Leyte. National newspapers such as the \"Philippine Daily Inquirer\", \"The Philippine Star\" and the \"Manila Bulletin\" have reached the town before the establishment of provincial newspaper companies.\n\nThere are two radio stations operating in Sogod: \"Radyo ng Bayan Sogod\" (DYSL-FM 104.7), a branch of the Philippine Broadcasting Service (PBS), and the \"Radyo Natin Sogod\" (DYSC 101.1 FM), one of the radio stations owned by Radyo Natin Network.\n\nThe Maasin Cable TV provides the town concessionaires with forty to fifty channels. Recently, the cable television have expanded its services in the towns of Bontoc and Libagon. Other cable operators operating in the town are Dream Satellite TV and Cignal Digital TV.\n\nThe 2019 general election in the Philippines had appointed seats for the executive and legislative branches for all levels of government – national, provincial, and local, except for the barangay officials.\n\nWith a total of 17,612 votes, Imelda Uy-Tan (LP) retains her position as the municipal mayor of Sogod against incumbent Zone III barangay chairman Nathan Abihay-Gabronino (IND), who only bagged 7,638 votes. Incumbent councilor Atty. Jose Ramil Golo (LP) also won against Greg Regis (IND), having 14,871 votes while the latter with 9,148. The Tans have been active in politics since 2004.\n\nSogod is politically subdivided into forty-five barangays; ten (10) of which compose the \"poblacion\" (town proper): Rizal, San Jose, San Pedro, San Roque, Tampoong, Zone I, Zone II, Zone III, Zone IV and Zone V.\n\nKahupian is the largest barangay in the municipality, in terms of land area. Other large villages such as San Francisco Mabuhay, Hipantag, Kauswagan, Javier, Hindangan and Magatas are only accessible by \"habal-habal\" via feeder roads (with the exception of barangay Javier, which is reachable by jeepney and motorcab plying for Libagon town).\n\nMost of the smaller barangays are found in densely populated areas in the municipality, particularly in the \"poblacion\". These barangays are Zone I, Zone II, Zone III, Zone IV and Zone V, San Jose, Rizal, Mabicay and Consolacion.\n\nThese are the subdistricts that constitute the municipality of Sogod:\n\nThe municipality of Sogod is divided into two school districts: Sogod (Sogod Central School) as the center of the west district and barangay Consolacion (Consolacion Elementary School) as the center of the east district.\n\nSecondary education in the town are provided by four high schools: three National High Schools and a high school administered by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Maasin. Last 2014, Representative Damian G. Mercado filed two house bills, namely: House Bill No. 1743 and House Bill No. 1739, establishing National Vocational High Schools in the barangays of Kahupian and San Isidro. Students from the northern barangays of Benit, Hibod-hibod, Hipantag, Kahupian, Magatas, Pancho Villa, San Isidro, San Juan, San Francisco Mabuhay, San Isidro, San Vicente and Suba would travel to the \"poblacion\" or to barangay Polahongon in Mahaplag for basic High School education. The House Bills are now pending for approbation in the Congress.\n\nTertiary Education is being concentrated in four colleges in the \"poblacion\" with Ormoc City Institute of Technology as the latest addition to the town’s educational facilities.\n\nThe planning and the implementation of health care programs in the municipality are shouldered by the Sogod Rural Health Unit (RHU). The department operates a number of Rural Health Centers (RHC), Barangay Health Stations (BHS) and one municipal-run hospital, the Sogod District Hospital (SDH), with a total bed capacity of fifty. The private sector, mostly medical practitioners from the Sogod District Hospital, operates three hospitals in Sogod. Medical clinics present in the town proper are being serviced by attending doctors from the local health department.\n\nJeepneys, \"habal-habals\" and \"potpots\" are common means of public transportation in the municipality. A converted army jeep outfitted with many decorations, jeeepneys are often used for short trips and plays an integral part of the town’s public transportation system. The following are the existing jeepney routes in town:\"Habal-habal\", a motorcycle modified to seat more than six persons, is used by commuters plying for the interior and far-flung areas of the municipality. Most \"habal-habals\" terminate at:\n\nA \"potpot\" is a type of an auto rickshaw carrying nine to twelve passengers, including the driver. In Sogod, the rickshaws are classified into three color types: blue, white and red. The blue \"potpots\" roam around the vicinity of the \"poblacion\" and the barangays of Santa Cruz, Mabicay, Tampoong, San Pedro, San Roque, Rizal, Pandan and San Miguel. The white \"potpots\" cover the western areas of Sogod Bay, covering from \"barrio\" Casao, passing through Bontoc town proper and \"barrios\" Divisoria and San Vicente, to the \"poblacion\" of Tomas Oppus town. And the red \"potpots\" span the eastern section of the bay, starting from barangays San Miguel and Suba to barangay Nahulid of Libagon town.\n\nThe town of Sogod can be reached via land, air and sea. Sogod is a three-to-six-hour-ride from Cebu City via sea travel (ships dock at the ports of Bato and Hilongos, in the province of Leyte) and a three-day drive from Manila through the Pan-Philippine Highway.\n\nSogod is also accessible by air from Manila through Tacloban City’s Daniel Z. Romualdez Airport. Though heavily damaged by Typhoon Haiyan, the airport remains an important thoroughfare in travelling to other points of Eastern Visayas. From Tacloban Transport Terminal in barangay Abucay, Tacloban City, one can take a Public Utility Van (PUV) or a bus bound for Sogod. Buses from the cities of Baybay, Maasin, Ormoc and Tacloban terminate daily at the town’s Doctor Gonzalo D. Yong Jr. Bus Terminal. The town is a vital link connecting Visayas and Mindanao because of its nearness to the ports of Liloan and Benit in San Ricardo town. These seaports provide daily trips to Surigao City, the gateway of Mindanao.\n\nWater services are managed by the Sogod Water District (SWD), which is presently serving a total of 2,524 concessionaires throughout the town proper. The water district was created pursuant to the Presidential Decree 188 (Provincial Water Utilization Act of 1973) with the approval of the municipal government of Sogod. After the issuance of Conditional Certificate of Conformance No. 188, the SWD was given authority to start its operation to supply and maintain potable water to the residents of the town. Other than the SWD, all the barangay units of Sogod manage and maintain the water services in the rural areas. Chief sources of water supply in the municipality are situated in Magaupas Spring in barangay Pandan, Banat-e Spring in barangay San Pedro and the Buac-Malinao Reservoir in barangay Malinao.\n\nElectricity in Sogod is powered by the Southern Leyte Electric Cooperative (SoLeCo), the only electric power distributor in Southern Leyte. Created under Presidential Decree 269 as a non-stock and non-profit, service oriented cooperative for the purpose of supplying electricity in an area coverage basis, the SOLECO began its operation on December 1, 1975. Electrification efforts in the province was first launched in the towns of Macrohon and Padre Burgos (February 15, 1976), Malitbog (August 2, 1976), Tomas Oppus (January 11, 1977), Bontoc (May 10, 1977) and Sogod (December 26, 1977). The second phase of the electrification started only after the electric company signed into a contract with Engineering and Development Corporation of the Philippines (EDCOP) for the latter's architecture and engineering services in the survey and design of the expansion in Libagon, the Pacific area and Panaon island in 1979.\n\nTelecommunication facilities, broadband and wireless internet connections are provided by Globe Telecoms, Smart Communications and Sun Cellular.\n\nThe main attraction of the town is the Agas-Agas Bridge, the country’s tallest viaduct. Other sites found in the municipality are the Banat-e Spring of barangay San Pedro, the CTL Farms in barangay Concepcion, Dagsa-Pasanon Falls in barangay Dagsa, the Lanao Spring in barangay San Juan, the Calvary Trail of barangays San Roque and Milagroso, the mighty Subangdaku River in the barangays of Suba and San Miguel, the Buac-Malinao Reservoir of barangay Malinao, La Caridad Farms in barangay Buac Gamay, Labong Cave in barangay Javier, the Magapso Fish and Marine Sanctuary of barangay Maac, the Manubsuab Falls in barangay Kanangkaan, the Bagacay Beach of barangay Consolacion and the Prima, Cabadoy and Palanca Pebble Beaches in barangay San Jose. Inns and hotel accommodations are concentrated in the \"poblacion\".\n\nThe Agas-Agas Bridge zipline or what they call \"Zipline Leyte\" is a twin zip line and one of the longest in the country gliding diagonally above the bridge and the riverine below it.\n\nCainting Cave and Falls has been discovered in 2003 by foreign visitors trailing in the northern mountainous area of the town. Undisturbed by human activities, the cave matched with a cascading falls has not yet been fully explored. This site, which forms part of the lush Sogod Rainforest served as meeting point of three (3) rivers which offers a scenic junction of a natural pool. The presence of leeches locally known as \"“limatok”\" thrive on its waters.\n\nThe area can be reached after a five-kilometer walk from the road proper in barangay Pancho Villa to the \"barrio\" of San Francisco Mabuhay. Pancho Villa is a 20-minute \"habal-habal\" ride from Doctor Gonzalo Yong Bus Terminal in the \"poblacion\". It is also accessible via a feeder road in barangay Kahupian which connects it from the \"sitios\" of Lubong Sapa, Silao Bato, Kabernal and Hagna. The latter, which is the farthest of the \"sitios\" and under the territorial jurisdiction of barangay San Francisco Mabuhay, is the location of the cave and falls.\n\nThe 500-hectare forested Magsuhot National Park, located three (3) kilometers from barangay Mahayahay, has a four 20-meter high waterfalls falling into a common basin.

It started as a joint venture between the United Nations Development Programme and Cisco Systems. It became an independent nonprofit organization in 2001. In 2007, NetAid became a part of Mercy Corps.\n\nNetAid began with a concert event on October 9, 1999 with simultaneous activities meant to harness the Internet to raise money and awareness for the Jubilee 2000 campaign. Concerts took place at Wembley Stadium in London, Giants Stadium in New Jersey and the Palais des Nations in Geneva. The Wembley show was at capacity; the U.S. show suffered from very poor ticket sales.\n\nPerformers at Wembley Stadium included:\nEurythmics, The Corrs, Catatonia, Bush, Bryan Adams, George Michael, David Bowie, Stereophonics and Robbie Williams.\n\nPerformers at Giants Stadium included:\nSheryl Crow, Jimmy Page, Busta Rhymes, Counting Crows, Bono, Puff Daddy, The Black Crowes, Wyclef Jean, Jewel, Mary J. Blige, Cheb Mami, Sting, Slash, Lil' Kim, Lil' Cease, and Zucchero.\n\nPerformers in Geneva included: Bryan Ferry, Texas, Des'ree and Ladysmith Black Mambazo.\n\nThe NetAid website, originally at www.netaid.org, received over 2.4 million hits and raised $830,000 from 80 countries. Cisco sponsored the concerts and the web site. Along with Kofi Annan, Keyur Patel, MD of KPMG Consulting spearheaded the technology architecture development of the web site and Anaal Udaybabu (Gigabaud Studios, San Francisco) designed the user experience .\n\nWyclef Jean released a charity single featuring Bono entitled \"New Day\" coinciding with NetAid. The song also has an accompanying music video that premiered on MTV's Total Request Live (USA) on September 21, 1999, although the video never charted.\n\nRobert Piper of UNDP served as a manager of the NetAid initiative for its launch in 1999.. \n\nFollowing the concerts, NetAid was spun out of Cisco as an independent entity and tried various approaches to raising awareness of extreme poverty and raising money for anti-poverty projects undertaken by other organizations, through a variety of different NetAid campaigns.\n\nIn 2000, NetAid launched an online volunteering matching service on its website, in partnership with the United Nations Volunteers programme, then under the direction of Sharon Capeling-Alakija.. The volunteering portion of the web site, managed by UNV staff, allowed non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and UN-affiliated projects serving the developing world to recruit and involve online volunteers in various projects. UNV took ownership of the online volunteering portion of the service in 2004, moving the it to its own URL at onlinevolunteering.org.\n\nIn February 2001, \"Time\" magazine and NetAid announced a pioneering initiative aimed at collecting donations through Palm VII handheld computers, allowing volunteers collect credit card data from friends and input the information into the NetAid web site via these newly-wireless devices. The experiment \"pushes the envelope for Web-based charities, according to analysts, who said the bid to turn handhelds into virtual wallets faces some significant hurdles--for example, guaranteeing the privacy and security of contributors.\"\n\nIn response criticisms regarding its finances, NetAid published a web page in November 2001 citing its record of donations to anti-poverty initiatives to date, such as granting \"$1.4 million to 16 poverty alleviation projects in Kosovo and Africa — well over the $1m that had been raised from the public to that point... the remaining $10.6 million was dedicated to creating an innovative institution that will generate new support for reducing global poverty over the long term. Since January 2000, NetAid has used approximately $2 million to catalyze new support and partnerships for fighting global poverty.\"\n\nAs an incubator for civic technology, NetAid explored the use of videogames for social change, co-founding the Games for Change movement in 2004. NetAid's work with games was initially offline, beginning with the \"NetAid World Class\" board game, which piloted in California, Massachusetts and New York in 2003. In 2004, NetAid co-produced a game with Cisco Systems called \"Peter Packet,\" which addresses how the Internet can help fight poverty, focusing on issues of basic education, clean drinking water, and HIV-AIDS.\n\nBy 2006, NetAid had narrowed its focus to raising awareness among high school students in the USA regarding poverty in developing countries.\n\nThe different campaigns of NetAid are chronicled through archived versions of its web site, www.netaid.org, available at Wayback Machine.\n\nIn 2007, NetAid became a part of Mercy Corps.\n\n"}
